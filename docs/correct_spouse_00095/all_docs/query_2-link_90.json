        "text": "It’s been a decade since The Lyric has shown a Shakespeare play, and in fact Romeo & Juliet was the first, back in 1959, so this latest production of what is undoubtedly The Bard’s best known work is a welcome comeback.\n\nWithout changing the detail and the dialogue of the fifteenth century script too much (except to cut original running time by about an hour), the production team, led by\n\nPhilip Crawford and Dr Anne Bailie, has managed to simultaneously transport us to the fair Verona of the time, but also to a modern day Italian fashion week, with all the accompanying drama (pun intended) of two opposing fashion houses.\n\nAesthetically, the fashion packs a punch, while the set is cleverly and beautifully designed, filling the stage and accompanied by great lighting. Simple things like a great moon and a backlit stained-glass window heighten the sense of place. The iconic balcony takes centre stage – or just off stage right.\n\nBut first, some facts: Did you know that there were two star-crossed lovers in Verona, who lived and died for each other in the name of love, back in 1303? Thus making the original love story a 620 year old one? William Shakespeare is said to have read about Romeo & Juliet in Arthur Brooke’s 1592 poem ‘The Tragic History of Romeo & Juliet’; and the feuding families of the Montagues and the Capitulets were inspired by the opposing families in Dante’s ‘The Divine Comedy’. The play, as it stands, is reputed to have been written in the mid-1590s, so the story as we know it is almost 430 years old. Not bad.\n\nIf you’re an actor stepping into the shoes of any of the play’s characters, it’s bound to be equally daunting and exciting. Juliet is said to be just thirteen, while her Romeo is a good bit older. Nonetheless both are wildly passionate roles, requiring that crazy, rash, lovefool kind of emotion that only teenagers in love (or lust) can understand.\n\nRomeo Montague – played by handsome actor Adam Gillian – captures the impulsive mood perfectly, and at the beginning of the play we learn that his Romeo is in an unrequited love ‘situationship’ with Rosaline Capulet, played (only in static photos in the set’s digital ‘ad campaigns’) by Sophie McGibbon, one of my previous models at fashion week and a future star in the making when she finishes at Guildhall in London.\n\nThe creative elements in the Minions: The Rise of Gru were surprisingly good but could have been better. The characters were well written, but I was expecting better because some of them barely had any screen time, like Dr Nefario who was only seen 2 minutes in the film. I wished they could have explained how he was a villain at some point in his life. Thevillainous 6 was a good concept to add to this film but I feel like the story line was rushed as it didn’t give us enough time to understand why he desired to become a villain and how he was villainous in school or at home. The genre was comedy, adventure, action and animation, the director succeeded in some parts of the film to include humour but at the same time it lacked it as well, it was the same with action. The dialogue was well written and at the end of the film it was all put together and made a heart-warming ending.\n\nTo conclude I enjoyed the film personally and it really brought childhood imagination to life as you were able to laugh and feel hyped for fight scenes as well as you get to experience spectacular animated movie with a good story line filled with character development and surprises. I would most definitely suggest this film to any age as it suitable and it gets you set off for an adventure on how Gru ended becoming a villain and hero by heart.\n\nI’ve seen Hamilton twice now since it arrived in the UK, and could easily watch it ten times. It is the story of America’s founding father, Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant from the West Indies who became George Washington’s right-hand man during the Revolutionary War and helped to shape the foundations of the United States we know today. Aside from his face on the ten dollar bill, he’s the lesser known of the Founding Fathers, and this fantastic piece of musical theatre helps to explain why.\n\nAlexander Hamilton was the first Secretary of the Treasury. His life is played out against the backdrop of the United States, past and present, with the white founding fathers played mostly by black actors. Hamilton was also illegitimate, an orphan, the son of a prostitute, dirt poor, and yet he became a scholar and a hero.\n\nThe score blends hip-hop, jazz, blues, rap, R&B and Broadway and is the story of America then, as told by America now. Created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, it’s a runaway hit, incredibly popular with audiences, and acclaimed by critics as a powerful creation which has given new wings to musical theatre.\n\nThe music fuses so many styles magically, turning the tale of the USA’s founding ideals into a celebration of the melting pot of nations it became.\n\nThe impresario Cameron Mackintosh has brought the show from Broadway in New York to the Victoria Palace Theatre in London’s West End.\n\nThe author, Lin-Manuel Miranda, a former teacher, read Ron Chernow's epic biography of Alexander Hamilton on holiday, and then suggested to the historian that it was the perfect subject for a hip-hop musical. Chernow eventually agreed, and Miranda performed the opening number at poetry jam for President Obama and guests in the White House in 2009 and Hamilton fever began. Miranda also wrote the book, the music and the lyrics and even played the lead on Broadway.\n\nThis epic story about immigration, race, class, love and war examines how strands of morality don’t change and looks at power, its use and misuse. Some people have principles and live up to them; others are dishonest. And we are all flawed to a greater or lesser degree, but equally, each of us can change the world.\n\nThe founding fathers of America are all played by non-white actors, while the old establishment figures, including the king, George lll and his soldiers are white, and full of their own importance. Critics have called it ground-breaking and game-changing, a masterpiece. Jamael Westman plays Alexander Hamilton with verve and skill and makes his character’s transformation from naive teenager to powerful statesman look simple.\n\nHamilton’s frenemy, Aaron Burr, is played convincingly by by Giles Terera; he also narrates the production. George lll is a scene stealing role for Michael Jibson. Rachelle Ann Go as Hamilton’s wife, Eliza, and Rachel John as her sister, Angelica Schuyler also pack a punch with their soulful singing.\n\nWinner of 11 Tony Awards including Best Musical, the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album, critics are calling Hamilton the sort of musical that comes along once in a generation.

Including shutting down dance studios I myself am familiar with across the United States. We are literally constricted from engaging in our field of study that we, as a community, have trained hard for over the years. During these times it’s been difficult for me to mentally stay positive about how the dance scene is changing because of the pandemic. Asking myself, how can I re-approach dance? What are ways to separate myself from other dancers? And How has my re-approach benefitted me?\n\nBringing something unique to the audience is my mission. I think the way for me to perform that task is through dance concept videos. I believe dancers have to rely on social media, especially at a time like this, to build their portfolio. Still performing but just in front of a camera instead of an audience. As long as I still gift the audience with a connection of humanity it works out. Watching videos, I’m sure can be classified as a way to pass the time during quarantine. With this assumption it would only make sense that videos are the best type of content with a favourable ROI (Return on Investment). We all look at dance videos on social media but how I want people to perceive my work is through storytelling. I believe storytelling with dance videos can provoke a feeling or thought in connection with that individual watching. For every video the creating process changes. One way I’ve created a project is by repetition of the song and bringing the lyrics to life with my dancing. On the other hand, I sometimes enjoy letting the special effects in post-production develop and carry the video. Pivoting in this direction with dance will be refreshing as digital marketing evolves.\n\nBrands and establishments are always looking for unique and innovating ways to grasp the audience attention. So, separating myself from other dancers is a must. I recently got interested in filmmaking because of the opportunity I had choreographing for a short dance film at USC. “A Beautiful Nightmare” is the title. Just being in the presence of the director, cinematographer, producer, editor, and of course the cast was inspiring. Seeing how they tackle presenting visual illusions made me realize learning these extra skills behind the scenes can enhance my own work as well as add value. I picked up the skill of filming and editing- still learning and practicing it to this day. Pre-production is a process I have gotten use to. I research unusual ways to film my angle shots. It can affect how the audience perceives the character and shape the video itself. I was taught “shoot to edit”. Meaning keep in mind how you’re going to edit your footage while in the process of filming. A simple concept that can make post-production smoother. There are multiple ways to accomplish task in the editing process so when bringing a certain vision to life I have to discover the best formula to get the results I want. It can also be tedious with all the tweaks to make as I look over my work. Exercising these skill assets helped me build patience in creating my content. Stage performance is in person and opening night is the very first impression. Shifting my focus to digital content, I can take as much time as I need perfecting the performance before anybody sees it. Working behind and in front of the camera may sound like a great deal of work to put in for each video but having more authority on how the creative process goes for my content is a wonderful feeling.\n\nWith my dance videos there are different lanes I can take. From concept videos, to tutorials, or if I dive deep into it enough; give tips and tricks on filming. I enjoy spreading knowledge through visual entertainment. I have made that my marketing strategy. I feel more freedom to experiment and apply my own deadlines to projects as a freelancer. As a freelancer it also means I have to take the initiative and reach out to companies and establishments I see fit. Releasing dance videos just isn’t all that needs to be done. Yes, staying consistent is key but I also believe you have to network. Networking has surrounded me around like-minded individuals. It helps me stay focus, putting in that consistent effort that can give you recognition and appreciation for your talent. Influences that help me with the creative process are the visual effects in movies and tv shows. Building credibility in film work that involves dance is a way I want to add value in the performing arts industry. Presenting a fresh way to unravel the storytelling to the consumer.\n\nReview by Letitia Fitzpatrick\n\nHow many of us have wondered what would have happened if we had made different choices in our lives? From the author of How to Stop Time, Reasons to Stay Alive and The Humans comes this unique, poignant novel about regret, hope and forgiveness, and a library which keeps second chances on its shelves. Matt Haig blurs the lines between genres, blending fantasy and myth with science fiction to create inventive and popular contemporary fiction.\n\nShortlisted for the British Book Awards Fiction Book of the Year 2021, The Midnight Library weaves magic from the first page. When Nora Seed finds herself in the library of the title, she has a chance to make things right by following different careers, undoing old break-ups, pursuing her passions, or travelling the globe.\n\nUp until now, her life has been full of misery and regret. She feels she has let down everyone, including herself, but things are about to change. The books in the Midnight Library allow Nora to live as if she had done things differently. With the help of an old teacher, she can now undo every one of her regrets, as she tries to work out her perfect life. But would any of these other lives truly have been better?\n\nNora finds that things aren’t always what she imagined they would be if she had chosen a different road. Before time runs out, she must search within herself for fulfilment, and find the best way she can to live her one precious life as well as discover what makes it worth living in the first place.\n\nMatt Haig was born in Sheffield in 1975. He writes books for adults and children, often blending the worlds of domestic reality and outright fantasy, with a quirky twist. His bestselling novels are translated into 28 languages.\n\nThe Midnight Library is a warm, funny and uplifting read which is full of enchantment and food for thought.\n\nAfter her fab review of Cruella, lovely Niamh Ferguson is back to review her fave TV show by Marvel, even though the series itself hasn’t finished yet. No mean feat, right?!\n\nOne thing to note though, if you’re a fellow fan - this is your official spoiler warning for both the series and Avengers: Endgame!!! Over to you Niamh:\n\nLoki is perhaps my favourite TV series by Marvel, despite it being unfinished.\n\nIt’s directed by Kate Herron (best known for her work on Sex Education) and its executive producers are Kevin Feige (who is the President of Marvel Studios) , Louis D'Esposito , Victoria Alonso, Stephen Broussard, Tom Hiddleston and Michael Waldron.\n\nI’m a big fan of Loki as a character, due to both his humour and his villainous ways, and I was excited when I saw that he was getting his own series. Tom Hiddleston ( also known for The Avengers, the Thor sagas and Early Man) plays the signature role of Loki.\n\nEpisode 1 starts off with Loki picking up the tesseract (as seen in Avengers: Endgame) and him being teleported into the Gobi desert. As he was never supposed to pick it up in the correct timeline, it caused a nexus event, which is a breach of “The Sacred Timeline.” The Time Variance Authority then arrested him, with Hunter B-15 taking the lead, and he was brought to Judge Ravonna Renslayer for the verdict. As his timeline was about to be reset, a worker named Mobius took him away to ask him a few questions .\n\nThere's a lot I love about Loki, but I do think that the special effects were overpowering everything else. There were a few robots used in one episode, and how smooth their faces moved was surprising to me, you’d think they were real people if you didn’t know the truth!\n\nI think the costumes, designed by Christine Wada, were also amazing, and they fit the theme perfectly! She had to design a genderbent costume too, which is when a designer takes a costume and makes it fitting for the opposing gender. (in this case, it was from male to female) - how cool is that?\n\nI love the choice of filming location too, the location of the TVA headquarters could not fit the theme any better, it looks just like the sci-fi kind of place an organisation like that would reside in.\n\nI also love how Kate Herron decided to make it officially canon* that Loki was genderfluid, which is when on different days, one may feel like the opposing gender.\n\nCasting:\n\nHere is the main cast of episode 1-\n\nTom Hiddleston as Loki\n\nOwen Wilson as Mobius\n\nGugu Mbatha-Raw as Ravonna Renslayer\n\nWunmi Mosaku as Hunter B-15\n\nTara Strong as Miss Minutes\n\nNew characters in episode 2\n\nSasha Lane as Hunter C-20\n\nSophia Di Martino as “The Variant”\n\nWith a special appearance in episode 3 from the famous Richard E. Grant!\n\nI rate this 5/5 and it’s great for any Marvel fans around my age!\n\n*If something is canon , it’s accepted in that fictional universe. (e.g, It’s canon that Double Trouble from She-Ra is non binary)\n\nOne of the most eagerly anticipated and controversial novels of 2020, American Dirt by Jeanine Cummins describes the ordeal of Lydia, a Mexican woman, with a comfortable life, who suddenly has to flee her home, along with her young son, and take the treacherous trip from Latin America to the United States as an undocumented immigrant.\n\nOprah Winfrey chose American Dirt for her book club saying the author “accomplished a remarkable feat, literally putting us in the shoes of migrants and making us feel their anguish and desperation to live in freedom.” However, some Latin American critics slated the book for its inaccurate portrayal of Mexico and Mexicans.\n\nOne called it harmful, appropriating, inaccurate melodrama. Another said it was an insult to Latin- American writers who have toiled - some for decades - to little notice of major publishers and book reviewers, while building a vast collection of breathtaking, authentic literature on shoestring budgets.\n\nDue to widespread criticism, several bookstores cancelled appearances with Cummins, Flatiron Books called off her book tour, and 142 writers signed an open letter to Oprah asking her to reconsider her endorsement.\n\nOprah acknowledged the criticisms but posted two one-hour Apple TV plus episodes focussing on American Dirt. “If one author, one artist is silenced, we’re all in danger of the same. I believe that we can do this without having to cancel, to dismiss or to silence everyone,” she said.\n\nMembers of the She Said Book Club took two completely opposite viewpoints on the novel. The angry nest of people scoring 0-1 stars were full of anguish, exasperation and rage, while the positive pond of die-hards said it was the best book of 2020.\n\nThose in favour found it to be riveting, informative, suspenseful, heartbreaking and hard to put down. They felt the book compelled you to turn the pages while balancing on the edge of your seat, and sat up all night to read more, learn more and ache more, with clenched fists and tears in their eyes. They found the characters very realistically developed with heart-wrenching stories.\n\nOthers found the story over the top, melodramatic and implausible. Some of the negative judgements stem from criticising Cummins for not having the right to tackle Latin issues because she isn’t Latin American. However, positive reviewers emphasis that this is a work of FICTION and the author owes you nada. Any book that shines light on a dark subject is a good thing.\n\nCummins spent four years researching the book and the epilogue left some with even more respect for her. Don’t we need as many voices as possible telling the story? Let the book open hearts and minds and start a civil discussion of the issues.\n\nWhile some of the criticisms of American Dirt are valid, they didn’t diminish the importance of the story. If nothing else, hopefully productive conversations and awareness of immigration issues will be generated. Our advice is: don’t pre-judge the book from the mixture of reviews. Pick it up for yourself and make your own judgement.\n\nCruella is quite a unique 12-rated movie, from what I’ve watched before, with the main character being somewhat of an antagonist.\n\nThe movie starts to properly begin after a traumatic event for Estella, and she wakes up, hat over her head, to a dog licking her face. Two boys accompany the dog, and all three are thieves. One of the two, Horace, tells her to go back to her mother. Estella stays silent, when the other one, Jasper realises that Estella is an orphan. They hear a whistle and the voice of an officer saying “Oi, thieves!” Assuming Estella’s one of them, they start running with Estella tagging along. She follows them to their hideout without them knowing. She falls and lands in their secret lair, not knowing her hat fell off and Horace and Jasper both notice her hair, which is somehow, half black and the other half white. Estella and the boys remain close for the duration of the story as the events unfold.\n\nWhat I love the most about the movie is the creative skill of the costume designers. For a long time I had really wanted to become a fashion designer, but I gave up on that dream. I believe that Cruella has sparked that feeling again. Jenny Beavan is incredibly skilled at costume design and I admire her greatly for it. My favourite costume was either Emma Stone’s costume from the Black and White Gala, being lit on fire to be truly revealed, or her costume from when she came out of the trash lorry. Those two were amazingly skilled and must’ve taken a long time to actually pull from concept to reality.\n\nThe casting was also totally on point, and Emma Thompson, (best known for Sense and Sensibility, Nanny McPhee and her work in Harry Potter) as the Baroness was a great choice. I enjoyed seeing Emma Stone playing the young Cruella.\n\nThe soundtrack was excellent, with the movie being set in the 70’s, and the music was well chosen from that era. I actually knew loads of the songs, with my mum and dad listening to them a lot when I was younger, and watching Stranger Things a few months ago. I love those kinds of songs actually, and I really love the rock genre!\n\nI also loved the chills that this movie gave me around the end of the film, with quite the plot twist. I didn’t find anything I truly dislike about the movie, but in my opinion, there was a bit of a fast pace a high intensity plot resolution close to the end.\n\nIt is directed by Craig Gillespie (Best known for I, Tonya and also another Disney production Million Dollar Arm) and produced by Andrew Gunn (Freaky Friday and Sky High)\n\nOverall, the movie is definitely worth watching if you’re a fan of the live action genre! In my opinion, it tops all the other Disney movies I’ve ever seen! As you can tell from what you’ve read, I definitely rate this 5 stars out of 5!\n\nNiamh Ferguson aged 11 & 5/6!!\n\nIt’s funny and fabulous, and you won’t want it to end. Motherland is a superbly sharp comedy from the pens of Sharon Horgan (Catastrophe) and Graham Linehan (Father Ted), as well as Helen Linehan and Holly Walsh.\n\nThis British sitcom about the ups and downs of parenthood among a bunch of competitive mums in middle-class London ran for three glorious series of half hour episodes and is still available to watch.\n\nMotherhood stars Anna Maxwell Martin who was nominated for a Bafta for the part of Julia, a self-absorbed slummy mummy who gets the shock of her life when her own mother decides to stop providing a free childminding service for her grandchildren. Julia is now forced to pay attention to her children’s schooling, and the concept of middle- class motherhood.\n\nA self-centred, egotistical worrier, Julia wants to do as little parenting as possible and lean on her new friends at the school gate. Anna Maxwell Martin feels the comedy was important in these uncertain times when the world is going through a pandemic. She reckons we are all struggling, and we need something to make us laugh, even just for a few hours.\n\nJulia struggles with juggling work and home life, an absent husband, nanny problems, a nit outbreak and a crush on her builder, among other trials. The actress relishes being an angry, over-the-top person. She was a hit as the grim-faced passive-aggressive DCS Patricia Carmichael in the immensely popular police drama, Line of Duty, which was filmed in Northern Ireland.\n\nAnother of the major characters in Motherland is Amanda (Lucy Punch), a vain yet insecure yummy mummy and social mountaineer who wants everyone to envy her. She is the superficially polite but acerbic leader of the Alpha Mums who are the mean girls at the cafe near the school.\n\nDown-to-earth Liz (Diane Morgan) lives in a council flat and is a chaotic and blunt-talking single parent, who is unpopular with Amanda’s clique, and becomes buddies with Julia, helping her navigate the stormy waters of actually taking care of your own kids.\n\nThe third member of their unlikely trio is Kevin, (Paul Ready) an earnest stay-at-home dad who unsuccessfully tries to ingratiate himself with Amanda’s circle but finds true friendship and lots of laughs with Julia and Liz.\n\nMotherland is excellently crafted and funny as well as poignant, as the characters deal with the ups and downs of life. Motherland is still available on the BBC iPlayer, and it’s addictive!\n\nFancy a bit of light relief from all the doom and gloom around us? Here is a fun, easy read with lots of humour and plot twists by the Sunday Times bestselling author, Mhairi McFarlane.\n\nIf I Never Met You is about Laurie whose partner, Dan dumps her after 18 years, just as she is hoping they will start a family. She is devastated by this turn of events, and to heap on more humiliation, they still have to work together in the same law firm. So when Laurie gets stuck in the lift with her good-looking colleague, Jamie, who is the office heartthrob, they hatch a plan to stage the perfect romance.\n\nHe’s looking for a promotion, but his bosses have indicated that he needs to settle down. Laurie wants revenge to make Dan jealous.\n\n“Laurie had made them a great home and it still wasn’t enough. Or, she wasn’t. She felt so foolish: the whole time he’d been growing colder, quietly horrified, hemmed in and alienated by it. It was such a shallow thing, but Laurie felt so damn uncool for being satisfied by a life that Dan wasn’t.”\n\nIt’s a fauxmance rather than a romance, but things get complicated in this hilarious, touching and well-written tale which will have you turning the pages into the wee small hours.\n\n“I think long-term relationships are the most potent demonstration of Sunk Cost Fallacy you’ll ever see,” Jamie said. “The definition of Sunk Cost Fallacy is a refusal to change something that makes you unhappy. You won’t, because look at the time and money and effort you’ll have wasted if you do. Which of course only means more waste.”\n\nHad this been what Dan decided?’\n\nIf I Never Met You is Mhairi McFarlane’s sixth novel and she says she’d wanted to write the Fake Romance trope for ages: “The social media age is such a rich time to write the wholly performative love affair because there’s so much highlights-reel-showing-off going on already. To counterpoint the high concept romance, I wanted the pain that spurred the protagonist into doing it to feel very real: thus the awful separation and ‘emotional ghosting’ Laurie gets right on the cusp of starting a family and in sight of middle age.\n\nAnd of course at the heart of it all is that romantic comedy mainstay: two people who imagine they’re chalk and cheese.”\n\nEnjoy this classy rom com from a clever, witty writer.\n\nBy Letitia Fitzpatrick\n\nThe writer of this beautiful, uplifting and touching first novel has been a senior civil servant for many years, and has captured the imagination of readers in Ireland where the novel is set, as well as abroad.\n\nLeonard and Hungry Paul by Rónán Hession tells of two friends in their thirties, who seem a bit odd and nerdy, but are good-natured and happy with themselves and their world. Their greatest passion is board games, and they enjoy reading science journals, encyclopaedias and birdwatching.\n\nHungry Paul lives with his mother and father, and the family are content together. Leonard also lives at home, with his widowed mother. Mindfulness is all the rage these days, and we are invited into the two friends’ world where they live in the present, take care of their parents, are kind, and delight in the small joys of life. They remind us that life is precious, even when people are uncelebrated.\n\nThe public response to this book, published in March 2019, has been phenomenal; it became a word-of-mouth bestseller in Ireland and Britain and was the subject of a publishers’ bidding war in America. It was also chosen by Dublin, Unesco City of Literature, as 2019’s One Dublin One Book where everyone in the city reads a designated book during April.\n\nThe book is a positive story, celebrating small acts of kindness which can mean so much, and seems particularly apt in these troubled times where we have come to appreciate friends and family more.\n\nA busy father, Hession wrote Leonard and Hungry Paul in 2017 in the late evenings when his children were in bed. That’s still when he writes, when he has the house to himself. It was his first experience of writing prose and there aren’t any writers in his family. Being chosen for One Dublin One Book has made him realise how rooted he is in the city.\n\nLeonard and Hungry Paul is a celebration of people who live quiet lives, people who “don’t push themselves to the front” and are often either simplified or, worse, rendered grotesque in literature. This is why there are very few physical descriptions, no surnames, no place names. The author didn’t want shortcuts, and believes that if you want to take quiet people and put them in the foreground, you need to prune away the things that normally obscure them.\n\nWhere The Crawdads Sing is a bestselling debut novel by Delia Owens set in North Carolina in the Fifties and Sixties. It has sold more than 4.5 million copies and topped Amazon’s list of Most Sold Books in fiction in 2019. It’s also a favourite of book clubs everywhere.\n\nIt combines a murder mystery, a coming-of-age story and a celebration of the natural world. For years, rumours of the ‘Marsh Girl’ have swirled around Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. In 1969, when a handsome young local man, Chase Andrews, who’s a bit of a celebrity, is found dead, suspicion immediately falls on the Marsh Girl, Kya Clark.\n\nShy and rejected by the townsfolk, she’s a complex individual who has had to survive alone in the marsh she calls home, making friends among the wildlife, and learning an astonishing amount about nature. She’s extremely clever, becoming self-sufficient since she was a young child. As she grows up, navigating her lonely life, she yearns for love, and two young men from the town become fascinated by her.\n\n“Learning to read was the most fun she’d ever had. But she couldn’t figure why Tate had offered to teach po’ white trash like her, why he’d come in the first place, bringing exquisite feathers. But she didn’t ask, afraid it might get him thinking on it, send him away.\n\n“Now at last Kya could label all her precious specimens. She took each feather, insect, shell, or flower, looked up how to spell the name in Ma’s books, and wrote it carefully on her brown-paper-bag painting.\n\n“‘What comes after twenty-nine?’ she asked Tate one day. He looked at her. She knew more about tides and snow geese, eagles and stars than most ever would, yet she couldn’t count to thirty. He didn’t want to shame her, so didn’t show surprise. She was awfully good at reading eyes.\"\n\nHowever, Kya’s new life brings danger, and the gripping plot twists and turns. Kya is a compelling and sensitive character, and the author’s descriptive prose draws you into her life in the wild, evoking the beauty of the marshland and its inhabitants.\n\nWhere The Crawdads Sing draws on themes of survival, of racial and social division, and ecology. The heroine is portrayed sympathetically, and her story examines how isolation affects our behaviour and how abandonment and rejection cast long shadows on our lives.\n\nIt’s a real page-turner, right to the end.\n\nYou might be forgiven for thinking this novel will turn into a cliché at the very beginning: Tess jumps into her car with a few boxes and moves to New York City to make it big. Within a few pages, however, you will quickly become invested in this beautiful story about love, food and belonging. Emphasis on the food! Danler treats us to a wine soaked tour of New York through the perspective of this young woman who suddenly becomes involved in the high pressure world of fine dining. The best part is you will genuinely learn something about fine food, wine and culture in these pages, alongside the beautiful storyline. With a new series adaptation of this gorgeous novel recently released, this novel is the perfect read for some feel good escapism.\n\nWhether you are a keen reader or prefer to dip in and out of a book, try one of these titles with a hot drink and a moment away from the news, giving yourself a minute of downtime! What better way than to keep your spirits up while we wait for restrictions to be lifted?\n\nIf, like me, you also want to continue supporting local and independent businesses while keeping up your book habit, you’re spoilt for choice. If you’re Belfast based, BooksPaperScissors and No Alibis are both still delivering orders over the lockdown, and have a great choice on their websites or can order titles in specifically. If you still can’t find what you’re looking for, bookshop.org is a great alternative to Amazon at similar prices and delivery times.\n\nLouise O’Neill’s latest piece ‘After The Silence’ is set on the island of Inisrun, ten years after the mysterious and brutal murder of Nessa Crowley, one of the island’s legendary Crowley sisters, at a Christmas party. O’Neill takes us back to the island where the Kinsella family, who hosted the fatal party, are hiding a deep secret.\n\nThe novel was initially inspired by the infamous true crime podcast ‘West Cork’ and the investigation into the murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier, and O’Neill wanted to use aspects of this within the novel, so she used flashbacks from Keelin Kinsella, the wife of Henry and mum to Evie and Alex, as well as interviews by a team of Australian film makers with islanders past and present, to tell the story.\n\nFilm makers Noah and Jake come to the island to make a film about “The Crowley Girl” and they use their interviews to show the prolonged hurt and strain among those left behind, especially Keelin Kinsella. Keelin’s husband Henry was always known as a blown in, and definitely doesn’t have the public’s favour since his family had let their money talk years ago when they built a retreat for artists. He is the main suspect in the murder, but O’Neill has written the novel so well that you don’t know exactly what the family is hiding until the very last minute.\n\nThe family lives a quiet and remote life on the island, away from other islanders since Nessa’s death, but when the documentary makers arrive, this all changes and the islanders are hopeful that the boys will uncover some new evidence that would finally convict Henry of the murder of one of their own. No one could get on or off the island the night of her death due to a huge storm, so if it wasn’t Henry Kinsella then they need to know who it was finally as the murderer was (and maybe still is, among them).\n\nThe Kinsella family dynamic is clearly strained and this has a central tie to the whole book which personally I enjoyed. One minute I felt sorry for someone, the next I was questioning why I had felt sorry for them. This ability to evoke emotion around characters is is a great attribute to any writer so big applause to Louise O’Neill here.\n\nThe book is set out to be a murder mystery, but it is clear from the outset that the author is hugely passionate about the story of Keelin and her harrowing experiences with domestic violence - both from a former husband and now in very subtle, but coercive ways with Henry.\n\nOverall it’s a very thrilling read as, right from the outset you know that there is without a doubt more to the story than is being told. The gentle unravelling of the overall plot, both present day and in the past, as well as the setting of the wild and rocky island, make the tale even more thrilling and atmospheric although your mind needs to be fully switched on and engaged to keep up with the back ‘n’ forth nature of the flashbacks. It’s not one to read with a sleepy, pre-bed mind, that’s for sure! But if you like murder mysteries and a notion of quaint island life then this is definitely one for you.\n\nShuggie Bain is a powerful, beautiful first novel by Glasgow-born writer, Douglas Stuart. Winner of the 2020 Booker Prize, it’s set in working-class Glasgow in 1981, where poverty is casting a long shadow as traditional industries die.\n\nShuggie watches his beautiful mother, Agnes, often compared to the film star Elizabeth Taylor, struggle to hold on to her dreams, which include having her own front door.\n\nHer violent, womanising husband abandons the family, and she and her three children end up in a dying mining town. Margaret Thatcher’s policies have led to mass unemployment, and alcohol and substance abuse are never far away.\n\nGround down by life, Agnes takes pride in her good looks, but becomes more dependent on booze to get through, as her older children pull away from her to try to save themselves. Her youngest, Shuggie, a lonely sweet boy, adores his mother, clutching on to the hope of a brighter future for them, but he has to cope with his own struggles. He is bullied for being effeminate, different and not fitting into this brutal world where men dominate. Agnes wants to stand by him, but her addiction means that most of the family’s meagre benefits go on drink, and she gets lost in a haze of alcohol a lot of the time, leaving her vulnerable son to face the world on his own.\n\nAs her alcoholism becomes worse, Agnes is exploited by men and even by neighbours pretending to be friends. Her eldest child, Catherine is the first to get away, escaping to South Africa, then Shuggie’s older brother leaves, telling his brother that Agnes will never change.\n\nBoth are afraid of getting sucked into a hopeless, desperate situation. Shuggie’s deep bond with his mother is heartbreaking, as her decline continues. They are left alone together and things go from bad to worse, but young Shuggie has a huge capacity for love and forgiveness.\n\n“She was no use at maths homework, and some days you could starve rather than get a hot meal from her, but Shuggie looked at her now and understood this was where she excelled. Everyday with the make-up on and her hair done, she climbed out of her grave and held her head high. When she had disgraced herself with drink, she got up the next day, put on her best coat, and faced the world. When her belly was empty and her weans were hungry, she did her hair and let the world think otherwise.”\n\nShuggie Bain is a brilliant, tragic insight into a family beset by secrets, alcoholism, and sexuality against a backdrop of poverty. The author shows huge compassion in this unforgettable novel.\n\nOur good friend Emer Dooris from Emer D blog is back with us, guest blogging this week to bring you her top picks of entertainment from home.

Editor Cathy Martin has been following the #FREEBRITNEY campaign for the last year and was a massive advocate of this documentary when it first came out. Poor Britney was harangued and harassed for abnormal behaviours when actually they were pretty normal reactions to being CONSTANTLY hounded by a press and paparazzi who were unhealthily OBSESSED with every move she made. I mean, poor Britney was on lockdown before any of us even had an inkling of lockdown life as she tried to live her life against the massive wave of pressure among paps to get a money shot (an upskirt pic of her by a paparazzo was rewarded with a $1m fee by People magazine). And then for her father to team up with a crooked lawyer to forcibly become her custodians and decide every tiny thing about her including how and what she was medicated and drugged with?! Aaaaargh!\n\nAnyway, Cathy’s advice: IT’S A MUST-WATCH.\n\nBack to me though, I’ll be honest I'll have to finish Married at First Sight Australia before I tackle any of these as I’m addicted! But whatever you get up to, enjoy!\n\nE x\n\nBy Alison Campbell & Cathy Martin\n\n‘Becoming’ is a beautiful, inspiring and engrossing piece of work from the former First Lady of the USA, Michelle Obama. If you’ve ever wanted to laugh, cry and cheer for someone all at once, I promise you will do it in this. Without a doubt, Michelle Obama has to be one of the most influential women of our time and the way she tells her story (stories, actually) in Becoming shows us just how relatable and down to earth she is.\n\nThe memoir has been divided into three parts, Becoming Me, Becoming Us, and Becoming More - each as captivating as the next.\n\n‘Becoming Me’ talks about her upbringing and childhood struggles in the south side of Chicago as Michelle Robinson. She discussed her father’s fight with MS, as well as an early experience with the police alongside her brother, which would teach her early on how the colour of their skin made them vulnerable. She travelled over an hour every day to get to school, but even then her drive, conscientiousness and ambition was clear. Some say perfectionism is a negative thing, but Michelle wanted to be more than a stereotypical South Side black girl, she wanted to be more and strove to achieve each goal along the way.\n\n‘Becoming Us’ is, as you can imagine, all about meeting Barack. But before deep diving into their love story she talks about feeling isolated as being one of only 9% of black classmates at Princeton. She fought and got into Princeton to join her brother, but it was here that she began to really see the race and class differences, which, instead of fighting against, she strove to beat in a different way, by being better than a black statistic.\n\n‘Becoming More’ is the most personal part of the book, as it talks a lot about the struggles of being the First Lady, and the criticism she dealt with, but also her passion for the varying charities, campaigns and foundations that she supported (and continues to do so). She talks about her pride at raising her children and wanting their lives to be as normal as was possible within the confines of the White House bubble. No mean feat!\n\nAs expected, the book brings a very different perspective to the public persona that is and was an esteemed American First Lady. We often don’t hear of the late night struggles and sacrifices that have to be made, or the worries that her girls wouldn’t make friends because of who they are.\n\nThe book demonstrates further that she is the epitome of a strong woman - and has had to be from an early age - but a lot of it is quiet strength. She has the quiet inner confidence of a lady who is polite and kind, but is not afraid to speak out where she sees wrong. And we all know we need more women like that! Wasn’t it another former First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, who said if you don’t speak up against oppression you stand on the side of the oppressor? Well if it wasn’t her, it was probably something she’d align herself to, as she was a steely First Lady like MO too. Outside of the book, we at The F Words loved how Michelle plain as day called Trump a bully during the Presidential campaign. And it’s great that she (and Barack) continue to do so.\n\nOverall this is a book of inspiration and shows that anything is possible if you put your mind to it and have good people around you. A great read.\n\nGrown Ups is a lively, fast-paced and moving story about a highly dysfunctional (although hilarious at times) Irish family, The Caseys, and all of their complex, entangled stories.\n\nThe three Casey brothers, their wives and assorted children all spend a lot of time together, but tensions are simmering under the surface from old resentments, second marriages, truculent teenagers, step-siblings and fears of insufficiency.\n\nThroughout the book the Casey clan delivers an endless amount of drama peppered by author Marian Keyes’s signature humour, while simultaneously addressing serious, real-life issues such as bulimia, anxiety, depression and alcoholism.\n\nWith the countless characters and their many complex relationships, the book can seem a little confusing at the beginning for some; but stick the pace because it all falls into place and, once finished, most are sad to see the complicated clan go. It’s a bit like arriving into a dinner party and immediately forgetting everyone’s names once you’ve been introduced, but as the stories unfold and the night passes, you put it all together. Personally I didn’t need it, but the family tree at the beginning of the book ought to have helped some!\n\nKeyes brilliantly captures the impossible paradox of being a 21st-century grown-up, furiously trying to keep up, pretending you know what you’re doing, never feeling like you’re enough, parenting children who seem more savvy than you, and sometimes just wishing someone else would sort it all out for you. Told from multiple points of view, Keyes knows best how to bring out her character insecurities and flaws, making them incredibly relatable – and perhaps this is why the book is such a hit.\n\nOverall I found the book witty and engaging in a light-hearted and typically Marian Keyes way - it’s difficult not to become so immersed in the lives of these people that the pages just fly by – but it’s also a page turner for the more serious and powerful themes around the dynamics of family, marriage and body image. There really isn’t a dull moment, and this is tragicomedy at its heartbreaking and witty best…\n\nThis story follows the case of a missing woman, Hannah Greer. She hasn't been seen in 48 hours, and has apparently disappeared without a trace. What follows is a multiple-perspective journey through the eyes of family, friends, strangers and detectives, who are all somehow involved in or tied to the case. However,\n\nwhat is later revealed is darker than it initially seems on the surface.\n\nUnder Your Skin is a suspenseful, dark and intense read right from the start. It has everything a great thriller must have: a disappearance, an in-depth investigation and a plot twist, making it very gripping.\n\nIt’s the type of read that sucks you in from the beginning, and has you guessing who is up to what. The synopsis is all you need going into this one. It gives just enough to question everyone and everything until the reveal.\n\nThe reader is given a full 360-degree view of each situation, with multiple points of views. This really helps the entire storyline to come together, as it is read from each character’s perspective.\n\nThis book is sure to throw many unpredictable twists and turns, and can potentially be uncomfortable at times, as it covers some domestic violence and sexual scenes which readers may be triggered or distressed by. A story to do with domestic abuse is never going to be an easy one but McClelland has written it with sensitivity.\n\nReview by members of the She Said Book Club\n\nWith the insight into Kyle’s abusive behavior written in great detail, it really hits home, because you realise that\n\nit’s something a lot of women suffer every day. There are great dynamics between the characters, so whilst it's a gripping page-turner, at the same time, all the characters stay real, relatable, flawed and grounded.\n\nMcClelland tells a story that will resonate widely. Strong and capable in their professional lives, it’s a different story when it comes to their feelings. Emotionally and sexually, Hannah, Julia and Kerry are fragile and dependent on the approval of their men. This leaves them open to manipulation, exploitation and deathly danger, because all the power in the relationship may lie with someone who is rotten to his very core.\n\nMany reviews note that all of the characters were well- written and believable, so well, in fact, that it feels as if this book was part of a series. From the lively banter and the little quirks in their friendships, this engrossing read delves into the psychological aspects of their relationships.\n\nWe become absorbed in Hannah’s story, drawn into an excellent look into how many women view and handle situations like this. This read should be recommended to anyone who enjoys a fast-paced, captivating and absorbing psychological thriller but also those who love a heartfelt, emotional read.\n\nUnder Your Skin is Northern Ireland writer Rose McClelland’s fourth novel, and her first psychological thriller. It has been an Amazon Number One Bestseller in the UK and the USA/Canada."
