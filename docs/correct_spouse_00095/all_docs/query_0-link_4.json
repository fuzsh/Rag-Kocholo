        "text": "Ray Panthaki (born 20 January 1979) is a British-born actor and film producer.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBorn in London, Panthaki is best known for the role he played on BBC soap opera EastEnders as Ronny Ferreira (2003–2005). He also appeared in the hit British films 28 Days Later, Ali G Indahouse, Tube Tales, Bollywood Queen, Provoked, and the 2006 cult box office hit Kidulthood which he also produced.\n\nIn 2006 he was nominated for \"Best Supporting Actor in a Play\" at the TMA Theatre Awards for his role in Gladiator Games, which was based on the highly-publicised true story of teenager Zahid Mubarek who was beaten to death by his rascist cellmate in Feltham Young Offenders' Institution. Later that year he set up the London-based production company Urban Way.\n\nPanthaki lived homeless on the streets with director Andrew Jones in preparation for his role as a homeless heroin addict in the controversial movie The Feral Generation, which was awarded \"Best UK Feature\" at the Swansea Film Festival 2008. Panthaki is currently filming the lead role in City Rats alongside Danny Dyer, Tamer Hassan and Susan Lynch produced by Urban Way Productions and will make his West End debut in July 2008 in the play In My Name at the Trafalgar Studios. Panthaki has been with his partner, actress Brooke Kinsella, since 2005. The couple live in Islington, North London.\n\n[]"
