I have even seen her on TV talking about the dreadful subject. If she hasn't been already, she deserves to be decorated for her devotion, all done out of love.\n\nShe deserves the best 36th Birthday ever! XXX\n\n5ft for this little diamond. ð\n\nðð°ðð¯ï¸ðð°ðð¯ï¸ðð°ðð¯ï¸ðð°ðð¯ï¸\n\nMiss Sandy Cowell said on 26/Mar/19\n\nWhat a brave girl Brooke is, dealing with the wicked killing of her brother by campaigning against this sort of dreadful violence.\n\nI can't see myself having been so brave if that happened to me.\n\nSmall in stature she may be, but Brooke has the courage and resolve of 10 men. My heart goes out to her for all the good work she has done since the terrible incident.\n\n5ft.\n\nRobert said on 18/Jun/14\n\nSeen her in the street shes 5-1 in heels! No more than 4-11\" id say"
