        "text": "JASMINE WITH JIMMY WALES.\n\nAs they say, life, death and taxes is the one thing that we can be sure will affect us all and when we leave this blessed planet it would be amazing to exit knowing you’ve made a substantial mark on humanity. I relish meeting those that have changed the status quo and the way we live.\n\nNowadays no one uses a print copy of the olde worlde style encyclopaedia but everyone logs onto Wikipedia to find out the basics about anything at all. Wikipedia doesn’t just give us straight facts – its an information tool that anyone globally can and do contribute to and mould for the best most updated, factual accurate information.\n\nThe founder of Wikipedia Jimmy Wales this fortnight took time out to meet the LONDON360 team and talk about his support for TECH4GOOD. The Tech4Good Awards recognise organisations and individuals who use digital technology to improve the lives of others.\n\nUsually when the media interview Jimmy they make a huge deal about the fact that he’s the only world famous Internet entrepreneur who isn’t a billionaire. To which his recent response to a journalist was ‘‘that fact is true, I’m not a billionaire. So? You aren’t either, so are not most people. It’s kind of a stupid thing to bang on about’’. So we didn’t. Here’s how our conversation went.\n\nCan you tell me a bit about what motivated you to start Wikipedia?”\n\nJimmy: “So I had been looking at the growth of software, free software, programmers coming together from all over the world, collaborating, to build all the really great software that runs the Internet. Analytics, Apache, Pearl and HP, all of these fundamental software tools people are using to build the web, which are all open-source projects, all of whom are volunteers and it got me thinking about what else could be built in this way? We got this great opportunity of an Internet where people can communicate on, what else could be built? I hit upon the idea of an encyclopaedia that we could bring people together and give a free encyclopaedia to every person on the planet, in their own language and I was very excited about that idea. Here we are today”\n\nWell today we’re the fifth most popular website with over 500 million users every month so we’ve become part of the infrastructure of the world people are relying on us for anything at a time. For free and with no advertising it’s had a huge impact, for me I’m particularly proud of the impact it is having on the developing world. We seeing a lot of growth in the developing world and that’s where the humanitarian mission of wiki is becoming more important and strong and that a net billion people are coming online and that’s why they’re going from very little information to having the world open to them and we’re pumped to be there helping them find out by their government and learn about their politicians. Whatever it is to me that very exciting.\n\nWikipedia is a freely licenced encyclopaedia written by thousands of volunteers in many languages, the original vision for Wikipedia is for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge, and that’s what we’re doing at Wikipedia\n\nIn terms of the motivation of the people involved, what sort of things would you say about their motivation? What motivates them to do what they do?”\n\nJimmy: “Yeah, I think it’s 2 things. First, you know, imagine a world where every single person is given free access to the sum of human knowledge through what we are doing. That’s our vision, which is very exciting, this big thing and if you are going to spent a lot of time on a hobby, you might as well be doing something that’s historic and important and that’s meaningful to people. But that’s not enough, there a lot of things that can be historically important, but that’s not very fun, this is very fun. People enjoy the process of editing Wikipedia, than you get those people who you agree, disagree and argue with, but in a constructive way. It’s an intellectual hobby, people really like, and people get really passionate about. So I think it’s a combination of those two things. It’s fun with purpose, is what makes the community really work. “\n\nAnd in terms of achieving that encyclopaedia for everybody where do you put yourself on the scale in terms of how far along the line…\n\nA few years ago I formulated in a more precise way to say I want to have at least 250 000 entries in every language that has at least 1 million native speakers because people say that in every popular language there are only three speakers. We probably won’t be able to make a separate encyclopaedia for them but we can have a million speakers. We have some small languages like that, that have been very successful and that’s about 339 languages depending on how you count and we are a long way from that. In the languages of the developing world there is a long way to go in the smaller languages particularly in the smaller languages of Africa there is a lot of work to be done; but in the larger languages, in the European languages, in the Chinese, Japanese we have come a long way towards that goal.\n\nI do think that there are some big leaps happening faster than people realise in terms of Internet access. You know you can find predications from a few years ago when your smart phones become big in Africa and you realize today actually five years ago, three years ago we were probable two years too conservative. In fact it is coming really fast, much faster than people realize. I think that is going to have some sharp impacts in the community. Look at the percentage of people that have access to the Internet in various countries. A lot of places in the developing world are experiencing what we all experienced in the late 90s of sky rocketing access to the internet, sky rocketing participation – it is coming to them now and that is a very exciting time obviously.\n\nAnd using devices that we could never imagine at the time the differences in these things and on the phone and nonetheless computer is a completely different experience…\n\nFor us one of the challenges is excessive building. If people are coming on a device than if it is the smart phone it is easy and its quite a good experience to read Wikipedia on a smart phone but I don’t think you are ever going to really edit Wikipedia from a smart phone…\n\nThat won’t change I think there is room for a bit more video. I always love it when people contribute to high quality photos and illustrations and things like that, those are important but not as important as changing the overall nature of the product Encyclopaedia is texting and that’s fine. There are other things. There is not a lot of demand from the community for video – it is really hard to collaboratively edit a video if someone posts a video and I think ‘oh there is an error there they should have done this differently’. Well there is not much you can do about it after the fact whereas with text you can say ‘oh I can add that or I see a mistake you made there or I can see a way it could be better phrased and I see a dialog along that’. Text is very fluid so it’s easy to continually improve text so I think that’s the nature of it and most of the topics in encyclopaedia text is really ideal. Audio, no in terms of access ability making sure that screen reader software works on our Wikipedia – something that is always a nagging problem because it’s so easy to change something and breaks people’s screen readers and they complain and we have to fix it again but we really try to be as successful as we can.\n\nTurning to tech 4 good I was trying to think of a couple examples that will sit alongside Wikipedia that are not for profit tech-driven globally do you have some examples that you sort of place yourself amongst.\n\nI never think about that question we are so absorbed in doing what we do that we don’t really compare ourselves. I think if you think in a broader way I don’t know if any other organisation are like us but there is a broader movement and spirit around the internet of the users of the Internet so while Youtube is a commercial platform a great a mass of content on Youtube is not commercial it’s just people sharing knowledge and I was just reading about music editing software so creating music and apparently there’s hundreds and hundreds of videos on Youtube explaining details of how to do it. If you have a software saying I want to learn how to make music using software there is an enormous amount of free educational material that people have just posted because it is their hobby and they love it so that is the spirit of Wikipedia that I know something and I’d love to share it.\n\nIf you had a child that is in to Mindcraft you know full well that’s all they do is watch YouTube, Mindcraft is the same thing there’s the same spirit of sharing and developing\n\nI play Mindcraft all the time as does my 17 year old daughter there’s massive amount of Mindcraft in there. I have heard of some cases they spend more time watching Mindcraft on You Tube than they do actually playing which is interesting.\n\nLooking ahead, I know you have been advising the government, UK government for example, what kind of lessons do you think there are about the way that tech can be used for good, social good, even stuff that you have learnt through Wikipedia or just generally.\n\nI think that one of the most important lessons of Wikipedia is that there’s an enormous amount of good will out there and so when we think about designing projects for good, we should be designing around that good will or rather the good people not designing around the very tiny minority of people who are trouble makers and that is a big mistake I see people making. They start thinking what could the bad people do, lets design the system around that to stop them from doing that and there’s consequences that stop the good people from spontaneously doing good, so that kind of approach and design of software, design of communities is really key and something I think we should see a lot more of.\n\nCan government introduce that do you think, is there any role they can play in that?\n\nThey can stay out of the way as much as possible, one of the big mistakes can be made is for politicians to imagine that they know what to do in the world of tech and entrepreneurship in general, and in general they don’t and they cant and it is not the right thing. What they should do is what they should be good at which is make sure that the legal structure is solid, understandable and fair to allow for innovation within that framework, and they get out of the way.\n\nIn five years time what is going to be different about Wikipedia with all the technology, which we’re using?\n\nThe two big changes you’ll see will be one will be visible to you and the other wont. The visible change will be that the editing environment will become a lot more like a word processor much more friendly. Right now when you click on edit you get wiki mark-up language and it’s a bit of a learning curve on how to do it. We want to eliminate the barrier so that is a visible change. The invisible change is what I’ve talked about already which is invisible to me which is the growth of Wikipedia in the developing world. We probably won’t notice when Zulu Wikipedia goes from two hundred entries to two thousand entries but the people who do speak Zulu will notice and that’s a big change.\n\nI know Wikipedia is very assessable to the disabled and the elderly and perhaps those with learning difficulties, was that something built in at the very beginning was that part of your mantra. And if so why?\n\nYeah it’s been core sometimes we’ve had a mixed track record on it. It’s something we are making sure Wikipedia works on screen readers, making sure the site is usable and we follow all the best practises of accessibility. And occasionally we break something and we try and fix it as quick as we can so there are issues on Wikipedia, which we can improve in terms of accessibility. But it is a core value and its part of our mission to say we want a free encyclopaedia in every major language for everyone on the planet. And that’s including for the blind and every other disability, which they may have. We want to make it available.\n\nSo in your view technologies good and technology is moving all the time. Do you have a vision of what the big next vision is going to be?\n\nYeah. In terms of tech 4 good for me one of the biggest things we’ve talked about briefly but its mobile in the developing world. There are phones coming out now the cheapest one I’ve seen so far for an android smartphone is $41. Which is reaching hundreds of thousands millions of people who could never have reached it before. They’re coming online for the first time there joining the global conversation. They’re using twitter or facebook or Wikipedia they’re reading the newspaper. That is a true revolution and I think that’s going to have an enormous impact. In places where people are finally able to get organised over the tyrants that rule over them. The kleptocrats that steal the money form them those sorts of things. They begin to gain the opportunity to gain some power and I think that’s incredible.\n\nWhat was your brilliant moment that caused you to create Wikipedia?\n\nThe interesting question of what was my brilliant moment is one that I really struggled with because I don’t think there was a brilliant moment. I think maybe the brilliant moment which is lost in the sands of time now, was the realisation that I wasn’t going to have a brilliant moment and that I need to allow other people to have lots of brilliant moments. So the creation of Wikipedia and the growth of Wikipedia required a lot of innovations by a lot of people. Developing the community norms and rules and editorial standards umm…. various genius changes to the software, things like that made a big difference. Other than saying I had the idea to create a free encyclopaedia for everyone, maybe that was a brilliant moment, I don’t think that was that important. I think lots of people have great ideas and they never do anything with them so for me I would say I’m a carpenter and architect, I’m a builder I build things, keep things moving forward\n\nWhat impact do you think Wikipedia has had so far?\n\nI think Wikipedia has had an enormous impact on the world. I’m really proud of our community and the things that we have accomplished. We’ve got 550,000,000 readers every month now so that’s a substantial portion of the planet. Were continuing to grow, were really excited for the next five years as we see the next billion people come online in the developing world and join in the global conversation. We want Wikipedia to be there for them to help them in the same way it has helped all of the rest of us so its an exciting time.\n\nThe evolution of Wikipedia has been very minimal actually, its an interesting thing that the original vision, the original concept, the original software, the original look of the site is all very similar today, a few things have changed here and there and obviously its bigger.\n\nBut one of the reasons that Wikipedia has been so successful is that the simple core idea, a free encyclopaedia for everyone has always been the driving force and it has helped us make decisions through the years and as long as we have remained true to that mission we have prospered and so I that sense we were not completely different than we were 7 years, we are pretty much the same as we were 7 years ago just bigger and better.\n\nWhat do you think is the most important lesson you have learnt since you have started that you want to share?\n\nThe single lesson that I have learnt from Wikipedia, the main thing is that there is an enormous number of wonderful people out there, in general if you think that that out of a 1000 people who turn up in the world, there’s probably 10 of them that are really annoying, and only 1 of them is actually destructive. But the 99 can deal with the 10 and the 1 you have to learn to cope with somehow. But in general we should design our systems we should design our societies we should design our software, the tools that we us are around the assumption that most people are good and we should allow the flexibility and ability to do what it is they want to do. Yes we have to deal with difficult people, that’s a piece of it but don’t design things about the difficult people first, don’t think of all of the horrible things people might do, lets lock everything down so they wont do that. Look at all of the great things people might do and lets design for that, and then yes, we have to cope with the trouble.\n\nWhat is your ultimate goal for Wikipedia?\n\nThe goal for Wikipedia is to have a free encyclopaedia for every single person on the planet in their own language, to make that a little more specific, the goal is to have 250,000 articles in every language that has as least 1,000,000 native speakers, so that’s about 330 languages. We are a long way off form that now, there’s a lot of work to be done in the developing world but it is a growing, we are on the way.\n\nJASMINE WITH ACTOR AND FILM MAKER RAY PANTHAKI.\n\nTHE DAILY GRIND ON LONDON LIVE\n\nI started my week as usual at London Live on the breakfast show #WAKEUPLONDON- The Daily Grind slot, which I do every Friday. Tune in to hear the quirkiest, exclusive stories from across the capital. Joining us in the studio are always a number of new exciting documentary filmmakers as well as key influencers and more.\n\nLast week it was my fellow Parsi mover & shaker, former Eastenders actor/ filmmaker Ray Panthaki, who told us about his new hard-hitting film Life Sentence- that highlights the devastating effects on a family of a fatal stabbing.\n\nIt’s a film about knife violence and Ray wants it to be shown to all London’s schoolchildren in an effort to help tackle the culture of youth violence. The film was originally made as a tribute to Ben Kinsella, the brother of former Eastenders actress Brooke Kinsella, after he was stabbed to death in London. Ray used to date Brooke at the time, and told London Live about the devastation caused by the murder on the family of the 16-year-old who was stabbed to death in Islington in June 2008.\n\nHe said:\n\n“You don’t expect anything like that to happen to someone you know, especially someone so close to you. The film reflects what I witnessed; it was a family, one of the most loving families I have ever met, falling apart one by one. “In the film I am trying to get across the effect on that family, that they each lost a part of them that day and they will never be the same again. That is the harsh reality. “Ben was like a brother to me at the time and this was a way of channelling my anger.”\n\nHis film Life Sentence, won the best short film award at the East End Film Festival last year and was long listed for the BAFTA awards earlier this year. Ray also co-produced the Noel Clarke epic, Kidulthood, and said: “It is easy to do a film saying put down your knives but I wanted to tell the story from a different point of view, from the view of someone’s sister or grandmother. “I have seen the reaction the film has on young people and I want it to have a wider audience. I want to get it into schools and in prisons. The film’s ending in particular sparks a lot of debate. At first they say ‘what is going on’ but then they understand.”\n\nLast year 12 teenagers were murdered in London, seven of them victims of knife crime so this film is timely and relevant. Spread the word!.\n\n===============\n\nJASMINE CATCHES UP WITH THE WONDERFUL CHUKA UMUNNA AT MOBOVATION.\n\nMOBOVATION BREAKFAST\n\nNext I popped along to an early morning breakfast event for MOBO called MOBOvation, where MOBO CEO Kanya King was hosting a breakfast gathering for VIPs in media and entertainment, to launch her new brand for unsung acts, and MOBO art exhibition, at Roast restaurant in Borough market. Joining the fancy start to the day were politicians like Chukka Umunna, entertainment impresario Jonathon Shalit, heads of record labels, TV society’s, music acts like Labrinth, Akala, Jahmene Douglas and Jermain Jackman who spoke movingly about the MOBO legacy.\n\n==================\n\nJASMINE WITH FOUNDER OF WIKIPEDIA- JIMMY WALES.\n\nMEETING THE FOUNDER OF WIKIPEDIA\n\nAs they say, life, death and taxes is the one thing that we can be sure will affect us all and when we leave this blessed planet it would be amazing to exit knowing you’ve made a substantial mark on humanity. I relish in meeting those that have changed the status quo and the way we live. Nowadays no one uses a print copy of the olde worlde encyclopaedia but everyone logs onto Wikipedia to find out the basics about anything at all. Wiki doesn’t tell us what’s what- the residents of the world all contribute their knowledge to its content.\n\nThe founder of Wikipedia Jimmy Wales was in town to pick up an award for TECH4GOOD, and sat down and spoke to us about his vision and brilliant moments that inspired his brand. The full report and interview will be put up soon but here are a couple of snippets from our chat;\n\n‘’I had been looking at the growth of software, free software, and programmers coming together from all over the world, collaborating, to build all the really great software that runs the Internet. Analytics, Apache, Pearl and HP, all of these fundamental software tools people are using to build the web, which are all open-source projects, all of whom are volunteers and it got me thinking about what else could be built in this way? We got this great opportunity of an Internet where people can communicate on, what else could be built? I hit upon the idea of an encyclopaedia that we could bring people together and give a free encyclopaedia to every person on the planet, in their own language and I was very excited about that idea. Here we are today”\n\n‘’Imagine a world where every single person is given free access to the sum of human knowledge through what we are doing. That’s our vision, which is very exciting, this big thing and if you are going to spent a lot of time on a hobby, you might as well be doing something that’s historic and important and that’s meaningful to people. But that’s not enough, there a lot of things that can be historically important, but that’s not very fun, this is very fun. People enjoy the process of editing Wikipedia, than you get those people who you agree, disagree and argue with, but in a constructive way. It’s an intellectual hobby, people really like, and people get really passionate about. So I think it’s a combination of those two things. It’s fun with purpose, is what makes the community really work’’.\n\n=====================\n\nRUDOLPH WALKERS INTER SCHOOL DRAMA AWARDS.\n\nRUDOLPH WALKER TAKES THE STAGE AT HIS AWARDS.\n\nAt the weekend, up at Millfield Arts Centre, actor and Eastenders legend Rudolph walker brought together a host of celebrity mates for his annual RWiSDA (Rudolph Walker Inter School Drama Awards) awards.\n\nRWiSDA was first pioneered in the 1970’s with two schools from Brixton by Rudolph to help young people give them a sense of responsibility, to enable to use their spare time in a positive and productive way to offer an alternative to “hanging around” after school and to alleviate the boredom which may lead to anti-social behaviour.\n\nWINNERS AT THE AWARDS 2014.\n\nThe Rudolph Walker Foundation Objectives are:\n\n1. To provide young people with a sense of purpose.\n\n2. To recognise that different people have different talent and skills, which need to be nurtured individually and sympathetically to help them fulfil those talents and skills.\n\n3. To understand that self-esteem is crucial to the development of responsibility and ambition in young people; and to develop self-esteem through teamwork and common objectives and goals.\n\n4. To give participants achievable goals that will be of practical educational value to children, young people and adults in our community.\n\n5. To address a significant gap in provisions.\n\nThe foundation holds an annual Drama Competition (RWISDA) between young people and between schools nationally and internationally in a way that helps young people to use their spare time in a positive and productive way, and to offer an alternative to “hanging around” after school, alleviating the boredom syndrome that can lead to anti-social behaviour.\n\nACTORS AND CELEB FRIENDS MENTOR THE YOUNG PEOPLES DRAMA SETS….SEE WHO YOU CAN SPOT!\n\n‎Retired boxer Michael Watson MBE, Retired former police superintendent Leroy Logan, singer Jermain Jackman (who I was sat next to), practically every Eastenders cast member and more celebrated 6 north London schools that had made the final cut.\n\nMICHAEL WATSON MBE AWARDS A PRIZE!\n\nTV and radio host and the nest man to lead any function with his free-styling entertainment- Kat Boyce ensured we enjoyed a very inspiring afternoon. Michael Watson awarded prizes, Jermain revealed that his solo album coming soon would be titled Genesis and I watched the stars of our future take their first showbiz steps!\n\nHOST WITH THE MOST- KAT BOYCE GRILLS JERMAIN JACKMAN.\n\n==============\n\nJASMINE WITH PREEYA KALIDAS AND JPESQ.\n\nPREEYA KALIDAS IN KHANDAN\n\nFinally I was invited by my friend, actress Preeya Kalidas to go and see her in her latest live stage show of Khandan at the Royal Court Theatre. The rest of the cast included Sudha Bhuchar, Neil D’Souza, Rez Kempton and Zita Sattar.\n\nPreeya last appeared at the Royal Court in Oxford Street. Her other theatre credits include Joseph and the Technicolour Dreamcoat and Bombay Dreams in the West End. Her television credits include Eastenders and Britz. On film her credits include Four Lions and Bend It Like Beckham and this time, as ever, she played the character that shakes things up!\n\nBased around an Indian family- The Gill family- the audience are sat in the round in their intimate living room. The play highlights culture clashes, sibling rivalries and endless cups of chah (tea)…\n\nWidowed matriarch Jeeto (Sudha Bhuchar) has a strong sense of her past and principles. She’s spent her life working hard and making sacrifices for her children. But eldest son Pal (Rez Kempton), isn’t following in her footsteps. He’s struggling with his role at the head of their expanding household. Crumbling under the weight of his father’s legacy, the family business is at risk and the last remaining link to their roots in the Punjab is in jeopardy.\n\nPreeya- is seen like never before (check it out I don’t want to spoil it for you-its on until Saturday). Its a warm and funny play about tradition and ambition and the strong message that we all tend to have everything at our fingertips and sometimes imagining that we always want and need more can lead to our own downfall.\n\nNow I’m off to see Pharrell at his Mastercard private gig- as they say….#priceless!\n\nANDY MURRAY SHOWS HIS POWER AT THE BNP PARIBAS TENNIS CLASSIC WEEK AT THE HURLINGHAM CLUB.\n\nEvery year when tennis season comes around, the usual extra Wimbledon fluff starts appearing in my inbox.\n\nE-mails from PR companies pushing their sports branded clients ‘’Wimbledon whites’’ shoes and sports wear and fashion accessories that are ‘’just perfect to impress the Wimbledon crowd’’. Invitations from tennis themed organisations that create tours of tennis locations like Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum. Fancy party invites themed around your ‘’favourite all time Wimbledon champ’’ and so on.\n\nAlso, leading up to Wimbledon are a number of warm up tournaments to get the players back in their stride and prepare the fans for the big event. The fanciest of these are the warm up games at the BNP Paribas Tennis Classic week at the Hurlingham Club, which takes place at the height of the summer tennis season, the week before Wimbledon, which this year had its strongest line up to date with World No.1 Nadal and Wimbledon Champion Murray.\n\nMurray was be joined by a world-class line-up of tennis legends including: Tim Henman, Goran Ivanisevic, Mark Phillippousis, Pat Cash and crowd pleaser Mansour Bahrami, who also all played throughout the tournament,\n\nJASMINE DOTIWALA AND HELENA MCGEOUGH (HEAD OF TV AT VIRGIN/EMI) AT THE TENNIS!\n\nSet in the beautiful surroundings at The Hurlingham Club (which is an exclusive sports and social club based in Fulham. (So exclusive the waiting list for off peak membership currently stands at 20 years and nepotism reigns here as children of current members are give preference when vacancies arise!). Lords, actresses, politicians and royalty make up its VVVIP list.\n\nIts Edwardian clubhouse, set in 49 acres of Greenland is so elite it offers sports activities that only HNWI usually have access to like clay pigeon shooting, croquet, golf, cricket, skittles, squash, tennis, bowls and swimming. It’s like a country resort, slap bang in the middle of a bustling city. In 1873 the club published the rules of polo, which most of the world still follow today and the following year played their first polo match.\n\nI was lucky enough to find myself attending the event for business last week when our champ- 27 year old Andy Murray- was playing Wimbledon’s 23rd seed – Spain’s Tommy Rodredo. The invitation requested that all guests respect their wishes for ‘’Smart dress code please. No jeans or trainers. We suggest you bring some form of warm clothing if overcast and chilly, or a hat and sunscreen if sunny’’.\n\nTestament to the standard of a facility and its members is their wi-fi policy. At Hurlingham this was ‘’an open wireless system which does not need a password’’. None of the usual #firstworldproblems logging in and giving away all your IP address details here darlings. You can tweet until you’re dizzy.\n\nThe reigning Wimbledon Champion Andy Murray was excited about making his annual pilgrimage this year stating, “Playing at the Hurlingham Club last June was the perfect way for me to warm up for Wimbledon. It’s a great setting and I’m looking forward to playing again this year.”\n\nAndy wasn’t the only excited one. My highflying record industry colleague and I squealed on entry to the main gates as we walked across the picturesque bridge and river setting to the main grounds. Set in the tranquil 42-acre grounds of one of the most renowned members’ clubs in the country, the event showcases some of the current stars of today as they warm up for Wimbledon and a few tennis legends are thrown in for good measure multi tasking as post match interviewers and day hosts too.\n\nPre match we were able to partake in the usual opulent ceremony of blini’s, caviar and champagne tasting before heading off to Centre Court, which seats an intimate crowd of 600. The women look very prim and elegant in their mostly unique outfits.\n\nHowever many times I experience an upper class event I wont ever tire of smiling at the men who turn up in their uniform of pastel blue shirts, navy blazers and sandy trousers and the occasional gent attempts a cad vibe with a tipped straw boater hat.\n\nTHIS HOW CLOSE WE WERE SAT TO ANDY- TOUCHING DISTANCE!\n\nWe were sat right behind the umpire and next to the paparazzi photographers in the photo pit and my heart did feel for Andy’s opponent Tommy Robredo as they snapped away incessantly when Andy served or hit the ball but all was like tumbleweed when the ball was on Tommy’s side of the court. So as our heads panned left to right, the click –click- clicks went wild rhythmically to Andy’s shots.\n\nSimilar focus has come via the newest recruit to Andy’s team. He’s had tennis aficionado’s tongues wagging by signing up a new coach, French former professional tennis player Amelie Mauresmo, who is herself a former singles grand slam title winner – one at Wimbledon and silver in the 2004 Olympics.\n\nWe couldn’t help keeping one eye on the match and the other on Amelie as she studied Andy’s game and smiled as he certainly showed very impressive good grass form. (Impressed? A tennis dictionary jargon phrase I picked up overhearing other convo’s around me on the day darlings!) LOL.\n\nInterestingly, being sat in the front row that close to the action meant we could see every grimace and piercing focus in both players eyes and the tremendous herculean effort every single shot takes. In the end, Andy won with straight-sets; 6-2 7-6 (7-1). (There would’ve been uproar if he hadn’t right?) Tommy just got served! (sorry I couldn’t resist).\n\nLOVED THE BALL GIRLS PINK TENIS OUTFITS!\n\nWith Andy I get the sense he’s very grounded and well rounded with his extra curricular activities that don’t have him turning into a tennis crazed madman the way John McEnroe used to come across. One of his ventures for example is a five-star hotel – the 15-bedroom Cromlix — set in 34-acres of lush Scottish countryside- just minutes from where he grew up in Dunblane, Scotland. Apparently Andy is involved on a regular basis in making sure it all runs smoothly.\n\nAfter Andy and Tommy’s match there was also another match between Berdych vs Dimitrov (who many of the women were drooling over as well as commenting that he was Maria Sharapova’s boyfriend. An awkward moment was when commentator/former player Andrew Castle asked him post match if more people recognized him or Maria when they were out. Eventually he admitted Maria, but I felt his pain.\n\nDIMITROV FEELS THE HEAT.\n\nThe afternoon finished with a fun mixed doubles match which included Mansour Bahrami / Andrew Castle which was the usual entertaining panto-style fun. Post match, tennis players mingled with guests off court, who were chillaxing with the obligatory strawberries and cream or high tea and scones.\n\nA ten-minute press conference where Andy was holding court was heaving with reporters, as he told us his thoughts on Wimbledon and whether he’s under less pressure now he’s finally won;\n\n“To be honest I don’t know, from my side it’s not, because I still want to try to win more if I can. So I’ll be putting pressure on myself to perform well, in terms of the media and public perspective it may be a little less this time, but not from myself. It took me a long time to win the first one. So it may be a bit naïve to think the second could come around so quickly, but I’ll try my best to give myself a chance’’.\n\nOn working alongside his new coach Amelie: “I’ve really enjoyed it so far, I’ve really enjoyed being on the court with her. I’ve enjoyed having her around. She understands the game well obviously; she’s also been in the position before coming back as defending champion at Wimbledon. She’s been very good so far and I’ve enjoyed it. From her side she’s just getting to know me, getting to know the guys that I work with, and how we operate. I’ve enjoyed the practices we’ve had, that’s also a very important part of the relationship with a coach is that you enjoy it and have fun on the court together, And that’s been the case in the last four days’’.\n\n“All coaches are strong in certain aspects and you need help in all sorts of different things, but obviously the tactical side is important. Preparing for tournaments like this isn’t about tactics it’s about getting ready for the pressure of the tournament, how to conserve energy and deal with situations like I’ll have on Monday, something I’ve never experienced before. I’ve got someone there who’s been in that position, who has done it before, and that will help’’.\n\nAndy’s has a stressful 2 weeks ahead of him as the British media mercilessly watch his, his coach, his girlfriend (bet she’s heard all the Love Means Nothing jokes) and families every move and facial expression. Their outfits and conversations will be under scrutiny like no other time, as now he has to defend his title and walk out onto that court this week with a new stance, as the first British male defending singles champion since Fred Perry.\n\n” It’s important at the beginning, when you go out and walk onto the court, to try to enjoy that feeling, because it’s something I’ve never experienced before, it will be a proud moment to come back as defending champion’’.\n\nThe Hurlingham Club is one of the best kept secrets in tennis, with their Garden Party atmosphere and VIP hospitality juxtaposed with the stars of today, but this week at Wimbledon, global players, international fans, pundits and the future generations will all be in attendance and watching eagerly.\n\nIts Andy’s time to carry on shining. You only live once, but lets hope that Andy gets to serve his Wimbledon fans with a win twice.\n\nALL PICS COPYRIGHT JASMINE DOTIWALA JMEnternational AND MOBO.\n\nCHUKA UMUNNA MP, MOBO CEO KANYA KING MBE, JASMINE DOTIWALA, MITCH WINEHOUSE, LABRINTH AND JERMAIN JACKMAN CELEBRATE THE LAUNCH OF MOBOVATION AND UNSUNG MOBO.\n\nThe great and the good from the music industry, gathered on Tuesday morning, at ROAST restaurant in Borough Market, for a fancy champagne breakfast launch for two reasons; MOBOvation- a photography exhibition that celebrates 18 years of MOBO and showcases talent and performances from the annual MOBO Awards ceremonies the exhibition is on display at Roast until November 2014.\n\nA VERY YOUNG CRAIG DAVID FEATURES IN THE MOBOVATION ART EXHIBITION.\n\nThe images selected from the MOBO archives feature acts who have shaped the musical landscape spanning over two decades and various musical genres with iconic photographs and stories of such talent as diverse as a very young Craig David, a fresh Amy Winehouse, the original four piece band that were Destiny’s Child, legend Sade, materialistic hip hop pimp 50 Cent, the uber talented Emeli Sandé, a then new, much less sharp Tinie Tempah and musical whizz Labrinth taken during stage performances and acceptance speeches. The second reason was to launch their annual MOBO UnSung competition.\n\nMITCH WINEHOUSE AND JERMAIN JACKMAN LISTEN TO KANYA’S SPEECH.\n\nThe invite stated a 9.30am start and by 9.35am sharp, punctual media heavy weights and key influencers like former BBC chief creative officer Pat Younge, entertainment impresario Jonathon Shalit OBE, The RTS’s retired chief executive Simon Albury, The Voice newspaper editor George Ruddock, Chuka Umunna MP, The Guardian’s Joseph Harker, Amy’s father Mitch Winehouse and more were sat knocking back strong coffee’s and full English breakfasts. I was sat between former RTS Chief Simon and former BBC Chief Pat both whom were great company.\n\nMOBO CEO Kanya King MBE welcomed industry professionals and distinguished guests and thanked them for their loyal support of her brand for the past 18 years. She reminded us that MOBO had been created to champion young music focused youth and given a platform to urban music acts for the longest time. Founded in 1996, the MOBO Organisation was established by Kanya to recognise the outstanding achievements of artists who perform music in genres ranging from Gospel, Jazz, RnB, Soul, and Reggae to Hip Hop. Over the past 18 years MOBO has played an instrumental role in elevating black music and culture to mainstream popular status in the UK. MOBO has since become Europe’s leading urban music brand supporting urban music talent in various ways.\n\nKanya said, “We are proud to have been supporting music for nearly two decades and to be able to showcase some of the many dynamic acts that have graced the MOBO stage over the years. Every image has a story and we are hoping by sharing these incredible stories of passion and professionalism combined with relentless determination that we will inspire many other acts who are trying to forge a career in music.”\n\nAs well as reminding us about why MOBO exists, Kanya also called upon acclaimed MOBO artists including Labrinth, Akala, Jahmene Douglas (X Factor finalist and a beacon for gospel music) and Jermain Jackman (The Voice Winner) to talk about their own experiences and memories of the MOBO brand.\n\nJASMINE WITH AKALA AND FRIENDS.\n\nAkala reminded us about why the brand was important to all British urban talent both commercial and underground, and told me afterwards that he has a very new exiting 45-minute long running, no break, style concept album coming. Chuka was warm and welcoming to all that approached him and thanked me for my support over the past few years, he too is an incredible advocate for young diverse issues. Jonathan Shalit OBE gave a moving speech about the MOBO brand having supported and championed his own talent like Jamelia and N Dubz over the years when others hadn’t been interested and that he admired Kanya’s tenacity very much. He reminded us that last years MOBO host Sarah Jane Crawford had been given a platform to showcase her TV presenting skills and now had won the Xtra Factor show lead job.\n\nJASMINE WITH JERMAIN AND JAHMENE.- 3 THATS THE MAGIC NUMBER!\n\nStraight afterwards Kanya excitedly told me ‘’ my favourite part about this morning was the content and the passion of the various speeches. Akala (Name is a Buddhist term for immovable and he is) talked about having a sustainable career in music despite the challenges he had overcome whilst being an independent. Jermain talked about his incredible journey so far and his ambitions for the future. Jonathan talked about the context of MOBO and all the artists and hosts that MOBO had been a stepping-stone for. I truly meant it when I said at the end of my speech thank you for listening because everyone truly did. My other favourite bit was that we now have a document of the monumental images of many of the talented acts that have been successful in the urban landscape!’’.\n\nAfter the speeches we were encouraged to walk around the restaurant and look at the beautiful portraits by photographers over the years and it was indeed impressive to be reminded just how many new, young acts had been given a platform in the wider commercial world when no others had been interested. Nowadays of course urban music is the pop music of this generation, but every now and again, like when the BRIT Awards totally snub UK urban acts, you’re reminded why we still and always will need a platform of our own.\n\nMITCH WINEHOUSE, KANYA KING AND ROAST RESTAURANT OWNER IQBAL WAHHAB.\n\nBefore we left we were reminded that the breakfast was also to launch the newly expanded MOBO UnSung competition, which is an initiative, dedicated to identifying and celebrating the next generation of talent in music. The contest offers a once in a life-time opportunity to champion creative individuals who are showing great promise to make it happen – the purpose is to inspire them to push through challenges whilst holding on to their creativity. By providing studio time with producers, year-round mentorship, career guidance and vital contact introductions, they are being well prepared for a potential career in music.\n\nThe project also offers a skills and talent development opportunity to an area of the industry, which generally receives little, support and has had little infrastructure until this year. Now it seems that every government body and funder is setting up new opportunities to get youth into the music industry.\n\nAs I’ve always stated, its not getting their feet in the door that matters, but a long-term career progression route. It’s easy to open a door into the industry for a few weeks or months but the issue with diversity is keeping diverse people in the music game. In any case, learning from the MOBO project will be aired online to be of use to a wider community and the artists will be encouraged to pass their knowledge on and collaborate.\n\nIf you’re an unsigned act or manager then details on how to enter #MOBOUnsung can be found on www.mobo.com/unsung\n\nMOBO is a part of a movement that’s been steadily growing for years. Our generation of key players in the music and media industry weren’t content to sit back, play second fiddle and beg to be invited to the industry consistently. Many of us decided to make a stand. We regularly pool our resources to make new stars, push forwards new brands, help media train new talent, advise and consult and stand strongly together.\n\nWhen you can’t get into the establishment you create your own lane.\n\nTHE STAGE AT HAMPTON COURT PALACE FESTIVAL AT DUSK.\n\nIn recent years various arts genres have been merging, making for incredible one off experiences. Whether it’s free running at 10 Downing Street, hip hop at the Turner Rooms at Tate Britain or film and live music performances of their soundtracks at the Royal Albert Hall, I am a huge fan of a cultural mash-up.\n\nNo longer do we need to settle for music performances at the traditional venues, and summertime means a plethora of outdoor music at prestigious venues, like the Royal Parks, World Heritage Sites, Historic Royal Palaces, Manchester United FC, Corporation of London and the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew.\n\nHowever, these are very niche in their usual audience ‘posh concerts for the hamper set ‘ and those in the know, snap up tickets fast. So if you don’t know about these events you’ll miss out. So how it’s been going for 22 years and this is the first a die-hard music fan like me has heard of it I don’t know. I really need to up my game!\n\nTHE GARDEN LAWN WHERE YOU PICNIC PRIOR TO THE SHOW.\n\nHampton Court Palace Festival is one of music’s best-kept secrets. In a nutshell, the grounds host a pre show picnic, which you can either buy in advance or bring your own. The actual music shows take place in the intimate courtyard of the Palace, which seats 3000 and is flanked by the majestic palace quarters and turrets. People who have previously performed at the Festival include: Cliff Richard, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Liza Minnelli, Frankie Valli, Van Morrison, Russell Watson, James Blunt, James Morrison, Bryan Adams, Caro Emerald, Katie Melua, Andrea Bocelli, Darcey Bussell, Jose Carreras, Joaquin Cortes, The Gipsy Kings, Katie Melua, Bryan Adams, Bryn Terfel, Brian Wilson, Katherine Jenkins, Rufus Wainwright, Tracy Chapman and Art Garfunkel to name a few.\n\nThis year the festival runs from 11th – 25th June, and amongst the line up for this season are ten-time Grammy award-winner George Benson (who will performing hits like Give Me The Night, Lady Love Me (One More Time) and Turn Your Love Around on 23rd June – come on! the perfect date surely?), diva Dionne Warwick, The original boy band- The Beach Boys, legend Van Morrison & the most successful UK jazz artist ever Jamie Cullum.\n\nThis past weekend I attended the classical gala and fireworks evening where The Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra performed a selection of well known pieces of music by masters of classical music like Strauss, Delibes, Debussy, Elgar, Tchaikovsky and more in Henry VIII’s open air courtyard.\n\nWe arrived at 5.30pm for our own meagre pre-packed supermarket special picnic and Proseco, which we bought, on site. Loads of what looked like VHNWI (Very High Net Worth Individuals) were merrymaking and supping champagne in the Palace Gardens before the concert started and time flew as we people watched. It’s a very bourgeois set up but the crowd came from all walks of life and it felt very inviting and inclusive.\n\nYOU CAN BUY WOOD FIRED PIZZA.\n\nWhilst heritage parks may have a certain type of visiting demographic, adding a music element in the grounds opens up a whole new audience and visitor to the beauty of some of the greatest locations in the country. The tickets range between £40-£70 and during the show we were thanked for our support as all proceeds go towards the upkeep of the venue, giving these palaces a future as long and valuable as their past. When you consider that your average pop concert at the 02 and one off Prince tickets sell for hundreds nowadays, the festival package and experience for around seven hours finishing up with a fireworks display seems more than reasonable!\n\nA PRIVATE WATERSIDE GAZEBO.\n\nI noted that if you’re feeling really flush, you can book VIP Packages from £295 p/p, with dining inside the Palace prior to the concert and covered VIP seating, reserve a waterside gazebo table for a private group experience (£200), pre book a luxury picnic (£75), or simply bring your own picnic blanket and scatter yourselves across the immaculately preened lawns. The people-watching is first class! From the loved-up couples sharing a pre-packed picnic, to the families with young kids scarpering around, to the silver haired music fans sharing a bench, time flies when you’re ogling.\n\nCONDUCTOR BEN DOES HIS THING.\n\nThe concert began at 8.30pm and was conducted by Conductor Ben Palmer, who shared wonderful anecdotes and stories about many of the pieces on the night and with his jovial, warm, engaging manner, the breathtakingly beautiful music was mesmerising.\n\nI had initially been concerned at my ability to stay focused and not get bored as I’m so used to have some sort of spectacle performing alongside music gigs, (my friend says this means I’m uncultured LOL). It didn’t take me long to realise that the orchestra were spectacle enough. Just watching them at such close quarters is hypnotising as they work seamlessly together. The solo players catch your attention at every new bar, the flute player who jigs and bobs as he performs, the female drummer commanding our attention or the whole band bringing us to a crescendo! Nothing is rigid and audience walk in and out of the concert in between sets, as they need.\n\nAs soon as the concert finished the audience excitedly rushed back out to the main garden grounds to take their preferred spots for the fireworks display which began 20 minutes later. The fireworks were more quality than quantity and after a quick 15 minutes worth of spectacular colourful aerial displays, which provided a visual fanfare to round off this superb evening, we sauntered back to our cars.\n\nPOST SHOW FIREWORKS OVER HAMPTON COURT PALACE.\n\nHampton Court Festival really is a festival that offers everything – preshow outdoor picnic and drinks in a breath taking setting, a wonderful selection of stalls that sell wood fire pizza and snacks, a diverse line up of music acts, all set within a beautiful and historic setting and if you’re extra lucky – as we were- no rain!\n\nOn 20th June, pop sensations Rick Astley and Jason Donovan are performing a double-header singing all their big hits but readers, even though I like to think I’ve upped my cultural game I don’t think I could handle the cheese fest that is Rick and Jason. Not that it matters- the night sold out ages ago! I shouldn’t scoff. Rick Astley still holds the record of being the only male solo artist to have his first 8 singles reach the UK Top Ten and in 2008 he won Best Act Ever at the MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\nIf you still want to get involved this year it’s all sold out except for a few tickets available for Opera on a Midsummer’s Night on 21st June where the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra will present a special midsummer concert conducted by Renato Balsadonna and featuring the beautiful voices of soprano Deborah Norman and rising star Noah Stewart.\n\nThe best music festivals aren’t necessarily the ones at the biggest concert halls, or at campsites over numerous unwashed days, in car parks or farms. Nor is it imperative to have the biggest musical names or huge lineup. Sometimes they can be a great classic music act, juxtaposed with an unusual location, a classy crowd and dining option. And where else in the world does fancy historic English gardens with an ancient historic setting and the chance to sing along to your favourite music virtuoso like we do? Hampton Court Palace Festival really is in a league of its own.\n\nMy experience was akin escaping to an enchanted garden back in yesteryear and being fed and watered for the best part of the day. An experience, which is like no other and involves dining, horticulture, history, music and fireworks. An adventurous music festival day out, but without any of the usual associated discomforts. If you’re going to do a music festival then this is the one to taste with all your senses.\n\nJASMINE WITH BONNIE GREER.\n\nShe’s the American British playwright, novelist, critic and intellectual who’s acted on Parisian stages, had her plays performed on multi broadcast platforms, produced films, written novels, as well as regular features in The Guardian and Huffington Post, served on boards for universities, opera houses, film schools and more. But in 2009 she flew crashing into a whole new generations psyche when she made BNP’s Nick Griffin look even stupider than usual on BBC’s Question Time, after she stepped into the verbal ring with him and slapped him around until he was trembling. My bad. He was trembling even before Bonnie started on him.\n\nShe’s accomplished much at the age of 65 and clearly the constant campaigning for people to have a voice, diversity in arts and culture and equality for all hasn’t aged her. If anything she looks younger than ever. Black don’t crack isn’t just a saying thrown around. It’s a fact of life.\n\nLast night at the most beautiful bookstore in London’s Mayfair- Hatchards- Bonnie read chapters from her new book, a memoir titled A Parallel Life. Understated in her actors uniform of basic black vest and trousers and her trademark headscarf, Bonnie welcomed an invited audience to hear her read especially chosen chapters from her memoir, in her very distinctive, calm, warm, measured, velvety Chicago drawl.\n\nBONNIE READS CHAPTERS FROM HER BOOK ‘A PARALLEL LIFE’.\n\nStories of her father Ben, a factory worker who took part in the D Day landings and was fascinated by the world war two Jamaican soldiers who fought for Britain. ‘’ My father was a union man. He’d take us to museums and was adamant about education as a way to get yourself up and out. He strongly believed in equal education and culture for everybody. ‘’ And mother Willie Mae, a housewife who in later life suffered with dementia, which meant she spilt all their family secrets to Bonnie in more chatty, rambling moments.\n\nBonnie is cool about it though, not much phases her. Although she began writing plays at the age of 9, she originally set out on a legal career, but dropped out when her professor told her he didn’t think women should have a career in law. Growing up in Chicago means she’s a tough, straight talker and her life in the emotionally open theatrical world means she has no hang-ups. She shrugged ‘’I’m from the theatre so I learned you gotta let stuff go’’.\n\nIn her book, Bonnie is open and honest about her upbringing, her sexual encounters, her struggle with an identity that was constantly quashed and a self-belief that was forever being challenged. She unveils secrets, personal angst and a hugely heroic battle to change what she was ‘supposed to be’ to become what she wanted to be. Her best friends succumbed to AIDS; she watched colleagues die for their beliefs; she saw her city and her dreams torn apart by the Chicago police. Bonnie bares all in this first volume of her memoirs, and you cannot fail to be moved, touched and even angered by what you are about to read. Bonnie’s experiences have driven her firm resolve to fight for civil rights. She was the ‘poster girl’ for the Nigerian schoolgirls long before their plight hit the papers; she is political, controversial, determined but, above all, she’s a woman who believes in equality. This is her story. And just the beginning.\n\nShe explained that once the book publishers had convinced her to write this book, she was extremely grateful to have a voice as a black woman, that hadn’t come from a tragic life story. ‘’I didn’t want to write from the point of view of an emergency. Most of the work we get published (as black women), are like emergency rations. No deaths or tragedies make me journey who I am. I grew up in the era of fascinating movements unfolding and developing around me. The black panther movement, black power movement, arts and theatre were exploding in new ways, the gay movement…. all these are what I talk about from my point of view’’.\n\nIf you Google Bonnie, alongside ‘’husband’’, ‘Nick Griffin’’ and ‘’university’’ is ‘‘racist’’, which uninformed online readers accuse her of being when she defends the black community. Yes, if you take her quotes out of context she probably does sound racist. However, in context you can see and hear the humorous, cutting, sarcastic tone in her voice and it makes sense.\n\nShe’s defended the ‘angry black woman’ stereotype and women’s right to have an equal voice. She sits back and observes academy award winning actress Lupita Amondi’s career with interest. ‘’It’s interesting watching Lupitas career develop. She herself said “I had to play a slave girl to get somewhere”?. This is an accomplished and Harvard educated woman!’’\n\nBonnie touched on something I find my black girl friends lament about often. The idea that their children don’t identify themselves positively with their black skin, and prefer the blonde white doll to the ones that looks more like them.\n\n‘’I had to touch on deep issues about myself in order to write this book that I may not have wanted to face. I had a really huge Shirley Temple obsession at aged 8. Its really hard for me to process that now. I used to draw her face as my face. But in the book it was something I felt I had to say as a lot of non-white girls go through the same thing. One day my dad brought home a black doll and put it in the middle of my blonde dollies. I lost it and freaked out at him and wanted her outta there. I used to put lye on my hair to relax it and used to question why? ‎I saw actress Cicely Tyson on a TV show once with short hair and she gave me the courage to cut all my hair short. So that was hard for me to go into and also other subjects about race. It was hard to be the black power person by day and dating white men at night. I had to deal with that. To face these contradictions in your life is tough. I was called out a couple of times. I talk about it in the book. Cos we black women aren’t afforded contradiction or publicity. You get nervous about lil kids looking up to you in case you say the wrong thing’’.\n\nThe new generation of young black women are of concern to Bonnie.’’ throughout history children are usually taller than their parents, but the generation of black girls born in the eighties are mostly all shorter than their mum’s. This has a lot to do with poverty and giving birth young. ‎I’m a champion of people’s voices-especially black women’’.\n\n‎She’s not just a champion of women of colour. She noted in the audience Q&A session post reading, when asked by a teacher how she could encourage her class of young black boys to aspire to positive TV images like we used to with ‘’fresh prince of Bel Air’’, that this was a new world where anyone could make it, and that the young black boys should make their own content and it would break through, like so much else in the web based new world has.\n\nIn the same breath she noted that even women of every nationality and style have a tough time in the male dominated broadcast world. ‘‘The BBC are getting smaller and smaller and to get onto SKY TV you have to be a woman that wears short dresses with short sleeves’’\n\n‎Bonnie came to the UK in 1986 as part of a production at the Edinburgh Festival and loved it so much she stayed, becoming a British citizen in 1997. She was appointed an OBE in the 2010 birthday honours and has said ‘’ I wouldn’t have accepted board appointments to the British Museum; the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; the Serpentine Gallery; the presidency of the Bronte Society and a seat on the cultural board of the first world war commemoration if I didn’t believe not only that culture belongs to all, but also that there is a duty in a democratic society to make it accessible to all, too’’.\n\nOne audience member asked Bonnie her thoughts on the Birmingham Trojan horse issue. Bonnie stated ‘‘the only Trojan horse is the one that the Tory party is running where Gove is over stepping the mark. The key British value is fairness. ‎We’re in a situation that’s not fair. It should be live and let live. Britain allows you to pretty much get on with things. In the USA you have to get your credentials out there first’’.\n\nBonnie isn’t as militant as she once may have seemed. Talking about her incredible personal experience working with her editor and publishers on her book she admitted ‘’20years ago I would’ve said a white man couldn’t work on anything with me. But in this book I wrote what I wrote. My editor Martin told me what he wanted more and less of and we made it work. There things I was afraid to say but they were coaxed out of me. My parents told me to go see the world and don’t let anyone stop me. So that’s what I did. We need a plethora of voices out there. I hope all of you write about yourselves too’’.\n\nHearing Bonnie read, you can’t help but laugh at her personality full of wise observations and hilarious commentary. I became friendly with Bonnie two years ago, as we are both panelists on Ladies Talk- a panel show featuring women of colour lead by Actress and comedian Angie Le Mar- debating topical and cultural issues. In the short time I have known her I’ve been blessed by her wisdom on issues as wide as love, bereavement and more and she’s genuinely helped me understand life better with her musings in the green room backstage post production. This book breaks her right down warts and all. She’s our very own Maya Angelou and we should treasure her soul.\n\nBonnie was born on Chicago’s west side and says ‘’A Southsider’s motto is: “If I don’t know you, I don’t care what you say.” The expression “tell it like it is” comes from the Southside too’’. And that dear reader , nicely sums this lady up.\n\nGlobal Stars Macklemore And Ryan Lewis, J Cole, Kid Ink Plus African Stars Liquideep, Kwesta, Daara J, Alikiba, Redsan, Keko Announced Amongst Several Other Stars As The First Of Over 150 Artists To Perform At Africa’s Biggest Music Festival, Tribeone Dinokeng\n\nIf you love Glastonbury, SXSW and Coachella, then TribeOne Dinokeng is about to be on your radar!\n\nThe TribeOne Dinokeng Festival, being held from 26-28th September 2014, will be a first of its kind not just for South Africa, but Africa itself.
