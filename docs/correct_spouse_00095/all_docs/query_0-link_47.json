        "text": "Some 44 celebrities and other figures have settled their phone-hacking claims against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN).\n\nMore than 100 are believed to have sued the paper over interception of phone messages which a judge described as being on “a very large scale” at the Mirror titles.\n\nLord Jeffrey Archer and Dame Mary Archer, former footballer Kevin Keegan, former Home Secretary Charles Clarke and actress Patsy Kensit were among the well-known names whose cases were resolved on Tuesday by the payment of undisclosed damages and an apology.\n\nThey were in a long list of individuals who were the subject of agreed statements read out to Mr Justice Mann at London’s High Court.\n\nIt is understood that some of the settlements exceed the £260,250 record damages awarded to actress and businesswoman Sadie Frost following a High Court trial in 2015.\n\nDavid Sherborne, for Clarke, said the activities of MGN in his case had caused “enormous stress” for him and his family.\n\nIt caused them to “drastically adapt” their way of life, he told the judge.\n\nHe received a “sincere apology” and undisclosed damages from MGN.\n\nIn the case of Keegan, the judge heard that MGN had agreed to pay him compensation and to join in a statement to apologise to him for the misuse of his private information.\n\nAfter details of the case were given in court, Keegan’s solicitor, John Newell, said in a statement: “Discovering that his private communications with his family, friends and associates had been unlawfully accessed was a devastating intrusion.”\n\nNewell said: “When Kevin was contacted by the Met Police and informed that his mobile phone had been routinely hacked and that his personal information had been obtained unlawfully, he was shocked and appalled.”\n\nHe said the “full extent of the hacking and the impact that this has had on Kevin’s personal and professional relationships may never be known”.\n\nNewell added: “But Kevin is pleased that Mirror Group have acknowledged their wrongdoing and publicly apologised. He feels vindicated and believes that justice has been done.”\n\nSolicitor Gerald Shamash told the court that the misuse of their private information was extremely damaging to Lord Jeffrey Archer and Dame Mary Archer.\n\nHe said that MGN accepted that its activities caused “significant damage and distress” to them and members of their family.\n\nApart from the payment of damages, MGN offered its “sincere apologies”.\n\nThe judge heard that MGN had paid Kensit a “substantial sum by way of damages to compensate her for the actions which they have accepted and acknowledged should never have happened”.\n\nHer solicitor Callum Galbraith told Mr Justice Mann: “MGN’s actions were wrong and caused unnecessary distress and tension at already difficult times for the claimant, such as the breakdown of her and Liam Gallagher’s marriage, the cancellation of her wedding to Jeremy Healy, and health scares suffered by her and her young son.”\n\nThree Coronation Street actors Tina O’Brien, Ryan Thomas and Jimmi Harkishin were also among those receiving payouts and apologies today.\n\nTheir lawyers Charles Russell Speechlys said in a statement: “Everyone has the right to privacy and confidentiality. Violating that right was simply unacceptable. While our clients have a public profile, their private life is just that – private – and should be respected as such.\n\n“We are pleased that we could assist our clients in resolving their disputes with MGN and that MGN has now offered a public apology to each of our clients for the distress caused to them by hacking into their voicemail messages, obtaining private information about them and using that information.”\n\nTrinity Mirror has estimated that dealing with hacking litigation will cost it more than £50m.\n\nComment: How publish and be damned took on a new meaning at the Mirror.\n\nAll 44 Mirror phone-hacking claimants who have settled their privacy complaints with the publisher:\n\nAngela Bostock, who was once in a relationship with actor Steve McFadden\n\nActor Todd Carty\n\nFormer home secretary Charles Clarke\n\nActress Michelle Collins\n\nFootballer Kevin Keegan\n\nBroadcaster Grant Stott, brother of TV presenter John Leslie\n\nLexia Stott, mother of Grant Stott\n\nSamantha Thomson, ex-wife of actor John Thomson\n\nModel Jo Wood, ex-wife of Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood\n\nDame Mary Archer\n\nLord Jeffrey Archer\n\nActor Rajan Harkishindas, better known as Jimmi Harkishin\n\nActress Patsy Kensit\n\nSinger Lisa Moorish\n\nActress Tina O’Brien\n\nMusic manager Hillary Shaw\n\nFootballer Lee Sharpe\n\nActor Ryan Thomas\n\nClaire Heseltine, the wife of actor and comedian Les Dennis\n\nActor Bruno Langley\n\nActor James Alexandrou\n\nTalent agent Peter Brooks\n\nPublicist Regine Moylett\n\nActor Ray Panthaki\n\nActor James Redmond\n\nActor Colin Salmon\n\nSports lawyer and former football agent Mel Stein\n\nActor Joe Swash\n\nActress Gillian Taylforth\n\nJames Moir, better known as comedian Vic Reeves\n\nModel Nancy Moir, wife of James Moir\n\nSinger Sophie Ellis-Bextor\n\nSheryl Gascoigne, former wife of footballer Paul Gascoigne\n\nActress and campaigner Brooke Kinsella\n\nInterior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife, Jackie\n\nDesigner Pearl Lowe and her musician husband Danny Goffey\n\nActress Louisa Lytton\n\nActress Sarah Manners\n\nActress Laila Rouass\n\nActress Kara Tointon\n\nActress Denise Outen, better known as Denise Van Outen\n\nActor Danny Young."
