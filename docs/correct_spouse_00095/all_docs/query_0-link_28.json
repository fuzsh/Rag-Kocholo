        "text": "Ben had been on a night out with friends at the nearby Shillibeers bar in Islington, north London, when a fight broke out inside.\n\nDetectives believe several youths were ejected from the bar and trouble continued down the street.\n\nHis family, who were supported in court by several friends, were kept separate from more than 15 friends and relatives of the three defendants who filled every seat in the public gallery.\n\nSeveral uniformed police officers were brought into court because of rising tensions between those packed into the small enclosed public gallery area.\n\nKika and Alleyne were arrested late on Monday night at an address in the Chadwell Heath area of east London, while Braithwaite was arrested in Bethnal Green, also east London, on Tuesday.\n\nKika and Alleyne were then brought into the dock. The pair, who also wore casual sportswear, spoke only to confirm their names and dates of birth.\n\nDeputy District Judge Alan Jones said their addresses would not be made public because of fears of reprisal attacks against their families.\n\nSeveral people shouted abuse and threats at Kika and Alleyne as they were taken from the dock by five prison officers.\n\nNo applications for bail were made on behalf of any of the three defendants. All three were remanded in custody until October 13.\n\nBrooke Kinsella, 24, who has made several emotional appeals for information since brother's death, was not in court.\n\nBen's relatives and more than 500 of his school friends went on a march through the streets of Islington in his memory on July 1, dressed in white as a symbol of peace.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference Miss Kinsella, who played Kelly Taylor in EastEnders, thanked members of the public for providing \"significant information\", but added: \"Unfortunately, the police have told us that they know of others who can provide crucial evidence but they have chosen not to tell the police what they know.\n\n\"We always knew Ben would make a special mark in this world and although this is in the worst possible circumstances, hopefully he will be the one that finally puts an end to this.\"\n\nA number of actors and actresses have paid tribute to Ben, who once appeared in ITV drama The Bill, at a makeshift memorial at the spot where he died.\n\nEastEnders stars Joe Swash, who plays Mickey Miller, and Charlie Hawkins, who plays Darren Miller, his half-brother in the show, said they were too upset to talk about the tragedy. Charlie attended the same school as Ben."
