They see me on the other side of the room and stare at me and I'm thinking, 'Come on, come and talk to me then!', but they just don't. They're intimidated.\n\n\"Boys do come up to me when I'm with Michelle though, and they think we're lesbians. Ever since the kiss we get loads of drunk boys coming up and saying, 'Do it again, do it again!'.\n\n\"It's fun to tease them about it but we never actually did the kiss again... can you imagine the papers the next day? Me and Michelle are very close but I definitely prefer men.\n\n\"And I think they'd be disappointed if they knew what the kiss was really like - me and Michelle thought we'd get the giggles but in the end it was so cold and miserable, we just wanted to get it over and done with. It wasn't exactly sexy.\"\n\nBrooke says she has been single since splitting with boyfriend Jamie Brindle in November.\n\nThe pair parted shortly after the Sunday Mirror revealed that Jamie had been convicted of racial assault after hurling foul-mouthed abuse at a traffic warden. Brooke now confesses the relationship was a mistake - and that she only went out with Jamie because she needed a shoulder to cry after breaking up with the love of her life, who she won't name.\n\n\"I was with this guy for three years and he's an amazing guy,\" says Brooke. \"He's the one I won't talk about now because it's sacred. He's always going to be in my life, he's a lovely boy. But it wasn't the right time. I jump into these relationships and put my whole life into it, I'm an all-or-nothing girl. If I hadn't split up with him, I'd probably be married with kids by now. But I know I'm too young for that.\n\n\"I needed a shoulder to cry on after we split up, and because I'd been friends with Jamie since I was 15, I mistook that friendship for something else. I was on the rebound.\n\n\"I'm only 20, I knew I was never going to marry him, and it just fizzled out. We're fine, we still see each other.\"\n\nBrooke says she has stayed single since Jamie to try and concentrate on her career, enjoy acting her age and spending time with her friends.\n\nA self-confessed serial monogamist, she has been having the time of her life partying with fellow single girlfriends. She is enjoying being pampered at her home in North London, where she lives with mum Debbie, stepdad George, and sisters Jade, 18, and Georgia, 10.\n\nBut she says if the right man comes along, she would be happy to be swept off her feet - somebody like her dream man, actor Orlando Bloom.\n\nShe says: \"I've been in relationships since I was 15. Although I've enjoyed being single, I am beginning to think about finding a boyfriend again now. Nobody ever chats me up, though, and I would never approach a bloke - I'm far too shy. I've never really been on a date either. My boyfriends in the past have always been friends first. I'd like to do a bit of Sex And The City-style dating but I'd be so nervous - I'd spill spaghetti down my dress and be totally tongue-tied. But maybe it's time to give it a go.\"\n\nBrooke, a petite 5ft 1in and a size six, has been linked to a string of men, including co-stars Joe Swash (Mickey Miller) and Ray Panthaki (Ronny Ferreira) as well as Hollyoaks actor Andy Newton-Lee and Blue singer Antony Costa. But she insists the rumours are not true, adding: \"Since I've been single, I've been linked to every boy I'm seen talking to. The papers say I must be going out with them because I'm dressed up all glam when I'm with them, but that's just me. I don't wear trainers or tracksuit bottoms - I'm a high heels girl.\n\n\"I feel sorry for the boys I get linked with because some of them have girlfriends. People must think I'm really promiscuous.\"\n\nBrooke - who has been acting since she was six and attended the famous Anna Scher stage school - is leaving the BBC1 soap after two years as Kelly.\n\nIt was rumoured that she had been sacked - but Brooke insists it was a mutual decision between herself and EastEnders' executive producer Louise Berridge.\n\nThe pair decided Kelly had run out of storylines - but the door has been left open for her.\n\n\"It hasn't really sunk in yet,\" she says. \"Because I'm still on screen I feel like Kelly hasn't really gone yet.\"\n\nAnd, while Brooke refuses to say how she is written out, she says it is a happy ending for Kelly, who has been dogged by tragedies including prostitution, her failed relationship with Spencer and a drugs overdose.\n\n\"The ending is very sweet and quite hopeful,\" she reveals.\n\nWith her blonde hair and blue eyes, Brooke always seems to be cast as a minx but post-EastEnders she says she'd love to do something different.\n\nShe says: \"I don't know why I always get these parts as bad girls - I must have that sort of face! But I'd love to do a period drama with a pretty dress, or a horror movie.\"\n\nAs for her fellow cast members, Brooke says she will miss everybody, particularly her \"soul mate\" Michelle Ryan.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the Albert Square boys...She smiles: \"I have more boyfriends than girlfriends in general, and I really get on with the lads from EastEnders.\n\n\"I've had to kiss a few of them in my time as well, which means you get to know them quite quickly.\n\n\"Chris Parker, who plays Spencer, is a nightmare - when we did our first screen kiss I could feel something pushing into my mouth, and I realised he had a mouthful of peanuts. He's always trying to pop his tongue in and he refuses to chew gum first. James Alexandrou, who plays Martin, has got the softest lips so he is probably my best screen kiss.\n\n\"But I'll miss everybody - I know it sounds like a cliche but we're honestly like a family and I've had such an amazing two years. I'm going to miss it so much.\"\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nKISS AND HELL: Brooke says her lesbian scene wasn't at all sexy to film; THUG LOVE: Brooke split with Jamie Brindle; ALONE: Brooke is still single"
