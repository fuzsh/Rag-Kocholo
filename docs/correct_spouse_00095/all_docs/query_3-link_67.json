        "text": "The family of 16 year-old Ben welcomed the conviction of Jade Braithwaite, 20, Juress Kika, 19, and 18-year-old Michael Alleyne at the Old Bailey but called for life sentences to \"mean life\".\n\nThe teenager, who had once written to Gordon Brown calling for action to halt the menace of knife crime, was trying to walk away from the scene of a street brawl which he had not been involved in when he was cornered and stabbed to death.\n\nViolence had erupted outside Shillibeers bar following a minor argument between a friend of Braithwaite and one of Ben's group over a 'dirty look'.\n\nBraithwaite, of Holloway, north London, was humiliated by a group of younger teenagers when they chased him away.\n\nPolice concluded that he then summoned Alleyne, who lived nearby, and Kika to help him exact revenge simply because he felt \"disrespected\".\n\nThe three began to chase a group of teenagers, including Ben, along the road and cornered him when he became separated from his friends.\n\nKika was on the run over an another stabbing 10 days before Ben's murder, while Alleyne had been released from custody for drug dealing three months earlier and had only recently been freed from a curfew and electronic tag.\n\nThe three, who blamed each other for the killing, were each given life sentences with a minimum term of 19 years, including a year already spent on remand.\n\nThey will be in their late 30s when they can seek parole.\n\n\"It is little more than Ben lived, so it is not really enough,\" said Miss Kinsella after the hearing.\n\nHer mother, Deborah, 46, praised the judge, the Common Serjeant of London Brian Barker, for his sensitive handling of the case but added: \"We would have liked it to be longer and life to mean life.\"\n\nPassing sentence, the judge said: \"Your behaviour generates outrage in all right-minded people and your blind and heartless anger defies belief.\n\n\"He had in front of him a lifetime of promise. You have taken all that away from him in a brutal, cowardly and totally unjustified attack. His family will never get over it but he will never be forgotten.\"\n\nThere were angry scenes in court as the three were handcuffed and taken away with shouts of \"bye bye\" from the public gallery.\n\nKika and Alleyne both turned and jeered and made gestures at members of Ben's family, as they were led away."
