        "text": "Paul Mason subjected Brooke Kinsella to a 15-month stalking ordeal Picture: Tony Palmer\n\nBenedict Moore-Bridger|Tony Palmer20 November 2014\n\nActress Brooke Kinsella was hounded by an obsessive stalker who visited the grave of her murdered teenage brother, repeatedly sent her unwanted messages - and said he had bought her a wedding dress, a court heard.\n\nPaul Mason, 40, constantly tried to meet the star and penned numerous fantasy love letters to her during a 15-month ordeal, promising her: “You will be my wife”.\n\nThe former EastEnders’ star, 31, described his behaviour as “scary” and “odd” as he was convicted yesterday for stalking between January 1 and April 4 last year.\n\nMagistrates in Bexley heard how he turned up unannounced at a theatre where she was performing, attended a charity open day she was hosting where he grabbed and hugged her, and threatened to visit the acting school she runs “to see you and the kids”.\n\nHe left a selection of gifts such as CDs, oils, perfume and a ring at the locations. When police searched his home they found a quantity of love letters devoted to the actress.\n\nTargeted: Ex EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella\n\nHe also told her he had already bought her wedding dress for their marriage.\n\nMason, who has a previous conviction for harassment, claims that as a victim of knife crime himself he was simply trying to support the actress’ work with the Ben Kinsella Trust, dedicated to the memory of her 16 year-old brother who was stabbed to death by three young men in June 2008.\n\nMs Kinsella told the court that she first heard the name Paul Mason in 2011 when the Home Office - who the Trust work with - contacted the police about troubling letters they had received about her from him.\n\nGiving evidence from behind a screen, she said: “I was told to be vigilant and was given his description and told to look out for him.\n\n“I was performing at Bromley Theatre and the box office staff told me ‘my friend’ had been looking for me and his name was Paul Mason. I was obviously worried because I’d been told to be vigilant about him.\n\nBrooke Kinsella at her brother's grave\n\nBBC\n\nRead More\n\n'Teach dangers of knife crime in schools': Brooke Kinsella campaigns in memory of brother Ben\n\nKinsella backs teen help project\n\nEx-EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella launches anti-gang initiative\n\n“A couple of days later two actress friends were in the auditorium and he managed to get in and spoke to them, calling me ‘Pumpkin’.\n\n“He contacted me on Facebook and Twitter and I received numerous messages on my phone and he would tell me my wedding dress was ready.\n\n“I blocked him, but he set up new accounts and sent more messages such as ‘You will be my wife’.\n\n“Sometimes they were complimentary and he would always refer to me as ‘Pumpkin’. It struck me as a bit odd and a bit scary and just seemed to escalate.”\n\nThe court heard that she was most concerned about his promise to show up at her True Stars Academy. “He said ‘I’ll come down to see you and the kids.’\n\nBen Kinsella: Stabbed to death in 2008\n\n“I felt threatened from the moment he said he was coming down.”\n\nThe only time Brooke met Mason face-to-face was at the Trust’s open day in August 2013 at Millwall FC.\n\nShe said: “He came up to me and hugged me and said he had presents for me.\n\n“I didn’t look at the presents. I just wanted to get out of there.”\n\nMason’s lawyer Roger Hill told the court: “This is at the bottom end of the scale. His case is that he met the lady when she first auditioned to go on EastEnders at Elstree and was subsequently aware of what happened to her and was supporting her.”\n\nMason, of Catford, was bailed until December 10 for a pre-sentence report and will also be the subject of a prosecution application for a restraining order to prohibit contact with the actress.\n\nDistrict Judge Robert Hunter said: “There are matters here that need looking into. In the light of his previous the court are considering custody.\n\n“The defence have described him as eccentric, which is one way of putting it.”\n\nThank you for registering\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in"
