        "text": "English actress Brooke Kinsella has welcomed her second child with her husband Simon Broadley and his name paid tribute to one of the most special men in her life â€” her late brother.\n\nThe ex-EastEnders actress announced her happy family news on social media and his arrival into the world was bittersweet as he was born on the 14th anniversary of her younger brother Ben's death.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nThe actress' brother was tragically stabbed to death in 2008 when he was just 16.\n\nPosting a black-and-white snap of her newborn son wrapped up snug as a bug in a soft blanket on Instagram, the 38-year-old actress revealed his special name and the day he was born: 'Ben Ross Boardley 29/06/22'.\n\n'A perfect miracle given to us on a day when so much was taken away,' the 38-year-old actress lamented, who played Kelly Taylor in the British soap.\n\nShe poignantly added how her son was 'named after the very best of men'. 'He will do them so proud, I know it already,' the she concluded.\n\nBrooke's brother lost his life after he was stabbed in an unprovoked attack involving a group of older teenagers on June 29, 2008.\n\nThe tragic teen had been out celebrating his GCSEs with his friends near his family home in Islington in London.\n\nWhile walking home they noticed a group of older teens following them, following an unrelated altercation from earlier that evening.\n\nHe died after being cornered and stabbed 11 times in five seconds. The trio involved in the stabbing were convicted of murder in 2001.\n\nBrooke went on to dedicate her life to anti-knife crime, receiving an MBE for her charity work, and her family set up the Ben Kinsella Trust in his memory aimed at educating youths on the dangers of knife crime.\n\nBrooke and Simon, who tied the knot in 2017 in a winter wonderland wedding, already share their 18-month daughter Elsie and she has spoken of sadness that she will never get the chance to meet her uncle.\n\n'Being Elsie's mum is everything I ever wanted but on the other hand I can't help but think about everyone who isn't around to meet her. For me the main person missing out is Ben.'"
