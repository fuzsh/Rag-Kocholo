        "text": "Ben Kinsella, 16, brother of former EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella, was knifed in a north London street on Sunday and died later in hospital.\n\nMiss Kinsella, 24, best known for playing Kelly Taylor in the BBC soap opera, is expected to make a personal statement on Monday.\n\nThe actress, her parents, Debbie and George, and her boyfriend, former EastEnders actor Ray Panthaki, were among more than 50 people who paid their respects at the scene in York Way, Islington.\n\nFormer Birds Of A Feather actress Linda Robson also laid flowers.\n\nScotland Yard said it is believed Ben was stabbed during a row with a group of youths.\n\nTwo 16-year-old boys arrested in connection with the investigation have been bailed to return to a north London police station on a date in late August.\n\nA makeshift shrine set up near the spot where Ben died is covered with more than 100 bouquets, balloons, an Arsenal scarf, and an England flag.\n\nAmong the tributes paid were flowers and a card which read: \"We will always remember you Ben for your loving ways and that great smile. Paul and Louise.\"\n\nAmong the young people paying tribute to Ben were EastEnders stars Joe Swash, who plays Mickey Miller, and Charlie Hawkins, who plays Darren Miller, his half-brother in the show. Both Swash and Hawkins, who went to school with Ben, said they were too upset to speak."
