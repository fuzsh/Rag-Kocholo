        "text": "For two years unemployed Paul Mason, of Farley Road, also sent personal messages to the actress – who he nicknamed ‘pumpkin’ – via Twitter and Facebook, followed her to events and even visited her brother’s grave.\n\nIn texts sent to Miss Kinsella’s phone, 44-year-old Mason, who obtained her number through a website, wrote: “Your wedding dress is ready pumpkin” and “Pumpkin I will be coming down Saturday to see you and the kids” – in reference to the True Stars Academy, her performing arts school for children in Hoxton, north London.\n\nMiss Kinsella, 31, who yesterday (November 19) gave evidence from behind a curtain at Bexley Magistrates’ Court, said she asked for Mason’s messages to be blocked from the Facebook page of the Ben Kinsella Trust which was set up to educate schools on knife crime following the fatal stabbing of her brother in 2008.\n\nBut Mason continuously set up new Facebook accounts which Abigail Kegg, manager of the trust, recognised due to the personal nature of interactions sent.\n\nIn August last year Mason attended the charity offices at the Lions Leisure Centre, adjacent to Millwall Football Club, to give Miss Kinsella gifts of perfume, a ring, oils, a scarf and numerous CDs containing his own recordings.\n\nHe was met by Miss Kegg who confronted him on his relationship with the actress.\n\nShe told Mason: “I don’t think Brooke is expecting you, I don’t think she wants your gift and I don’t think she is your friend.”\n\nGiving evidence, Miss Kegg told the court how at this point Mason lifted his shirt and showed her a “huge scar” on his stomach he claimed was the result of being stabbed several years ago.\n\nMiss Kegg told Mason she would accept the gifts on Miss Kinsella’s behalf on the condition he leaves.\n\nOn another occasion in April, an open day was arranged at Millwall where Mason approached and hugged the actress who subsequently informed a police friend and sought advice.\n\nOn April 10 he was arrested on suspicion of stalking.\n\nAt his home police found a poster of Miss Kinsella on the wall and a series of hand-written love letters on his bed.\n\nDuring the trial, an erratic Mason lifted his shirt to caress his scar, mumbled to himself in the dock and tried to take evidence claiming the love letters he wrote were part of his autobiography.\n\nMason was found guilty of stalking and will be sentenced on December 10."
