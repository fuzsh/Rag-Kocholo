        "text": "EastEnders star Brooke Kinsella has welcomed a baby boy, who she’s named after her late brother Ben.\n\nThe actress, who played Kelly Taylor in the BBC One soap, shared the happy news on social media this afternoon, posting a picture of her newborn.\n\n‘Ben Ross Boardley,’ she wrote on Instagram along the snap, adding two heart emojis – one yellow, one purple.\n\n’29/06/22. A perfect miracle given to us on a day when so much was taken away.\n\n‘Named after the very best of men. He will do them so proud, I know it already.’\n\nBrooke lost her brother Ben in a knife crime attack on June 29, 2008 – 14 years ago today – and has since campaigned against the crime.\n\nShe assisted EastEnders with research and input on a knife crime storyline in 2018 that saw Shakil Kazemi stabbed to death by a member of a gang.\n\nBaby Ben is Brooke and husband Simon Boardley’s second baby, after they welcomed a baby girl named Elsie in 2020.\n\nBrooke first revealed that she was expecting another baby in March of this year, sharing the news with OK! Magazine.\n\n‘It’s all kisses for now… Here we go again @Simonboardley’, she told the publication at the time, as she shared a picture of daughter Elsie kissing Brooke’s bump.\n\nIf you’ve got a soap or TV story, video or pictures get in touch by emailing us soaps@metro.co.uk – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nJoin the community by leaving a comment below and stay updated on all things soaps on our homepage.\n\nMORE : EastEnders spoilers: Big Mo returns as Laila Morse reprises role\n\nMORE : 12 soap spoiler pictures: Coronation Street wedding day outcome, EastEnders Phil ‘dead’, Emmerdale cancer discovery, Hollyoaks exit"
