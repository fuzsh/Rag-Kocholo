        "text": "Brooke Kinsella has given birth to a baby boy and named him after her late brother Ben Kinsella.\n\nThe former 'EastEnders' star took to Instagram to announce the arrival of her and husband Simon Boardley's little one following his birth on Wednesday (29.06.22), the 14th anniversary of her late sibling's death.\n\nShe wrote: \"Ben Ross Boardley 29/06/22\n\nA perfect miracle given to us on a day when so much was taken away.\n\nNamed after the very best of men. He will do them so proud, I know it already.\"\n\nBrooke's brother Ben was just 16 when he was killed in an unprovoked attack in London in 2008, in which he was stabbed 11 times in five seconds.\n\nFollowing Ben's passing, Brooke - who portrayed Kelly Taylor in the BBC One soap from 2001 to 2004 - has dedicated her life to campaigning against knife crime.\n\nBrooke and Simon - who married in 2017 - welcomed their first child, Elsie, into the world in September 2020.\n\nA few months later, the star admitted she finds it \"heart-breaking\" that her daughter will never get the chance to meet her late brother.\n\nShe said: \"It’s a double-edged sword. Being Elsie’s mum is everything I’ve ever wanted, but on the other hand I can’t help but think about everyone who isn’t here to meet her.\n\n\"For me, the main person missing out is Ben. Obviously I love Elsie more than anything and having loved Ben so much as well it’s heart-breaking to know the two of them will never get the chance to meet.\""
