Nana shows no emotion. Alfie is concerned but pulls away from Kat. As Nana looks at her brooch, she breaks down and cries.\n\nThe Ferreiras realise that they are free of their dad, but Tariq barricades the door, angry that they take being a family for granted. The Ferreiras stick together and are evicted. The community rallies round and takes them in.\n\nPauline and Dot continue to bicker. Sonia and Martin put the past behind them.\n\nDen deliberately forgets his keys so Chrissie follows him to his lunch date, who is Ian - a set up by Den.\n\nPat discovers Wilfred has gone."
