        "text": "Former 'EastEnders' star Brooke Kinsella is pregnant with her second child.\n\nThe 38-year-old actress - who played Kelly Taylor for three years from 2001 to 2004 - has announced she and her husband Simon Boardley are to welcome a sibling into their family for their daughter Elsie and they are completely overjoyed.\n\nSharing the happy news with OK!, Brooke said: \"It’s all kisses for now … Here we go again Simon Boardley.\"\n\nBrooke - who married Simon, 43, in 2017 - made no secret that she wanted more kids following the birth of her daughter 18 months ago.\n\nShe told OK! magazine: \"I come from a really big family and I’m so close to my siblings.\n\n“Having someone to go through life with is really important and I’d love to give Elsie that. There’s plenty of room in our home for another little one.\n\n“We’re not getting any younger, so obviously we need to think about these things, but I’m not in a rush.\n\n“I want to enjoy Elsie as a first-time mum and give her all the love and support that she needs. We’ll leave it up to the universe and see what happens.”\n\nBrooke experienced tragedy in her life when her younger brother Ben Kinsella was stabbed to death in 2008 when he was just 16 years old.\n\nThe actress - who founded the Ben Kinsella Trust in his memory and has been awarded an MBE for her charity work - previously admitted that it was \"heartbreaking\" for her that her daughter Elsie would never meet her uncle.\n\nShe said: \"It’s a double-edged sword. Being Elsie’s mum is everything I’ve ever wanted, but on the other hand I can’t help but think about everyone who isn’t here to meet her. For me, the main person missing out is Ben.\n\n\"Obviously, I love Elsie more than anything and having loved Ben so much as well it’s heartbreaking to know the two of them will never get the chance to meet.\"\n\nBack in 2018, Brooke assisted the team on 'EastEnders' during their research for a knife crime storyline which saw the character Shakil Kazemi (Shaheen Jafargholi) stabbed to death by a gang member."
