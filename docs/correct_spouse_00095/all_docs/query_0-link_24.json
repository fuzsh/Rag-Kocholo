        "text": "FILM producer Bal Kumar believes that movies have the ability to make a real difference to our lives.\n\nSo when he was asked to get on board a project tackling knife crime, he jumped at the chance to be involved.\n\nThe film was called Life Sentence and is loosely based on the death of tragic schoolboy Ben Kinsella.\n\nThe 16-year-old was stabbed 11 times when he fled from a fight in June 2008.\n\nThe short film looks at the tragedy of knife crime and the way it impacts on the lives of all those affected by it.\n\nIt is to be shown in schools and colleges across the UK in the hope that it will encourage young people to think hard about the consequences of getting involved in such crimes.\n\nFor Bal, of Lockwood, and others involved in making the film it is a particularly emotional experience.\n\nThe 37-year-old was asked to take part by his friend and frequent collaborator, actor Ray Panthaki, who is the film’s writer and director.\n\nThe star of Kidulthood and City Rats dates former Eastenders actress Brooke Kinsella, the sister of the murdered teen.\n\nSays Bal: “Ray came to me with this film and I told him straightaway that I wanted to get involved.\n\n“For me it is important to make films on issues that matter, that have an impact and this was such an important subject.\n\n“It is a very emotional film for everyone involved, especially Ray and I also know the family.\n\n“It will be difficult for Ray to make, but he said when I got on board he was doing this for Ben and because he wanted to change things.”\n\nThe powerful drama follows the events leading up to Ben’s tragic death.\n\nThe teenager was killed after an argument in an Islington pub spiralled out of control.\n\nBen was the seventeenth young person to be killed by knife crime in London that year and the huge media attention surrounding his death led to a review of UK knife sentencing laws.\n\nIn June last year the three men who murdered him were jailed for life.\n\nThe film Bal is involved with looks at the families of both the victim and aggressors as well as focusing on why young people feel the need to carry knives.\n\nBal explains: “There was a lot in the media when Ben died. People were shocked by the fact that this terrible thing had happened to a young boy who did nothing wrong and was just trying to help out friends.\n\n“What happened had a devastating impact on his friends and family and the film explores this.\n\n“But what this also says is that knife crime affects everybody and can also have terrible consequences for the kids who find themselves serving a life sentence and the both sets of parents who suddenly lose their children.\n\n“Sadly some kids grow up surrounded by crime, but they do have choices about how they live their lives.\n\n“We want these kids to see that violence doesn’t solve any of their problems ever – it only makes them worse.”\n\nThe film is currently being shot on location in South London and is due for release early next year.\n\nIt is produced by Bal and features Layer Cake actor Tamer Hassan and local performers.\n\nOnce complete it will be screened at major national and international film festivals as well as being used for educational purposes, including being taken into problem crime areas.\n\nThe project has the backing of Brooke, who recently set up charity The Ben Kinsella Trust, to tackle the dangers of knife crime and to provide young people with alternatives to violence and anti-social behaviour\n\nBal believes the project can make a real difference to young lives.\n\nHe says: “I am a religious person and it’s my duty to help those in need and to make a difference.\n\n“It’s a project I’m passionate about and I know it will have a strong impact on young people and really make them think about the way they treat others.\n\n“It has the potential to be so positive and life-changing. Brooke is 100% behind us and believes it is going to make a big difference.\n\n“We are hoping something good can at least come out of this terrible thing.”\n\nIt has been a busy 12 months for Bal, who earlier this year saw the release of his debut feature film Cuckoo, starring Richard E Grant.\n\nBal – who has lectured in film at various colleges – currently has several new projects in the pipeline.\n\nThese include his directing debut, crime drama Brothers.\n\nBal is also on a mission to help others break into the difficult film industry, by offering them help or the chance to work on his films.\n\nBal, who lives with his Indian-born mother, brothers and sisters, says: “I’m having a fantastic time and getting the chance to work with some amazing people.”"
