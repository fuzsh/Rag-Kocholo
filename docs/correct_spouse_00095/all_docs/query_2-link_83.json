        "text": "If you haven’t heard, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are fading to a new social media platform called Vine—the world of six-second video clips. As our STEPHEN CHRISTOPHER finds, one of the queens of these shorts is actress Sunny Mabrey, with over half a million Viners (followers). Um, yeah, that’s like a lot.\n\nActress Sunny Mabrey is over Facebook, she’s long past Twitter, and now knee-deep in social media’s latest platform, Vine. Vine, if you haven’t heard, is a new app (the latest in the oligarchical social media world of Jack Dorsey, the genius behind Twitter). Vine allows you to shoot, edit, and upload tiny, six-second video clips that loop ad infinitum on any smartphone. Sunny already has nearly half a million Vine followers (a.k.a. the Viners).\n\nEvery day, the tall Alabama-born blonde works on a new video that takes her anywhere from five minutes to up to two days to produce. She schools me on the importance of this new technology. “Let’s not cast Vine off as some little social media thing that doesn’t mean anything. It’s really helped me in so many ways, both professionally (in getting acting gigs), socially (in meeting new friends), and creatively (in being an outlet for my crazy thoughts).”\n\nLike all social media, getting followers is the game, and Sunny’s doing a damned good job. To give you some perspective, the top Viner is KingBach with 4 million followers, and right behind him is Brittany Furlan with 3.8 million. Sunny shares that her worldwide ranking is 132. “I’ve just been made privy to this website that I should never have been introduced to,” sighs the self-confessed worry wart, “RankZoo.com. I don’t like seeing stuff like that because it messes with my head.”\n\nBy far, Sunny’s most popular Vines are ones featuring her best friend, Lauren German, star of NBC’s Chicago Fire—and they are hysterical. The two play these over-the-top characters from like Minnesota, Pam and Rebecca. Sunny’s also created some other wacky recurring characters. “I play this one eleven-year-old boy with a bad lisp, and this one Russian girl who wants to be a black swan ballet dancer, but she’ll never make it—it’s kind of sad. Sometimes I don’t understand it, but the videos that make no sense seem to have the most likes and revines.”\n\nSunny, who graduated from the University of Mobile, refrains from reading the comments about her Vines. “Sometimes people can be hurtful, and so many are mean-spirited. I’ve gotten a little tougher. Like, they’ll make comments about how I have a big forehead, or they’ll say I’m ugly. I can deal when someone says that I’m ugly…superficial stuff is fine. The worst is when they say things that have some truth to them like, ‘You really didn’t put much time into this one, did you?’ Ouch! That will cut me to the core.”\n\nSunny shares that one of her saddest times was when, at thirteen, her parents divorced. But then, one year later, to her delight, they remarried. Ironically, after her own divorce from actor Ethan Embry a few years ago, the two are now happily dating again. To make everything beautiful, Ethan’s first ex-wife, Amelinda, is now one of Sunny’s closest friends and they’re working on writing a television pilot together.\n\nIf another walk down the aisle with Ethan is in her future, Sunny wouldn’t mind slipping her original wedding ring back on her finger. “I hated taking it off because it’s gorgeous. I honestly love that ring, it’s the most beautiful I’ve ever seen.” Fortunately, after the divorce, this fiery Sagittarius didn’t chuck it in the gutter or hock it for fifty bucks. Now there’s material for her next Vine.\n\nArt Direction: Stephen Kamifuji\n\nPhotographer: Verity Jane Smith / VerityJaneSmith.com\n\nStylist: Lisa Cera / LisaCStyles.com\n\nHair: Jeremy Clark for Jeremy Clark Salon / AimArtist.com\n\nMakeup: Kirsten Simitzi / KirstenSimitzi.com using FACE atelier\n\nManicure: Denise Bourne / SiriusArtists.com\n\nPhoto Assistants: Ian Barling, Jolie Kinga\n\nLocation: Aesthesia Studios / Culver City / AesthesiaStudios.com\n\n‘Driven’ is one of the words Katheryn Winnick, the beautiful star of the History Channel’s Vikings, uses to describe herself. But, as our STEPHEN CHRISTOPHER finds, for this five-degree martial arts–wielding expert, that’s an understatement.\n\nIt’s 9:45 a.m. and Katheryn Winnick, who’s been up for about half an hour, is at home in her Venice loft. She jumps on a call with me, takes a sip of her morning coffee, and tells me she’s trying to figure out what to have for breakfast. She’s just arrived back in town, so her fridge is bare—save for that leftover steak from her dinner at Boa. The first thing I ask her for is the five words that best describe Katheryn Winnick.\n\n“Five words? Okay, how about driven, caring, hardworking, fun, and, hmmm…adventurous.” By most accounts, Winnick, who portrays Lagertha, the badass sword, shield, and axe-wielding young warrior and mother on the History Channel’s very authentic and raw original series, Vikings, was made for the role. The show, penned by Emmy-winning screenwriter Michael Hirst (Elizabeth, The Tudors) tells the tale of Ragnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel), a Viking warrior on a mission to explore and conquer distant shores. It’s a story of warfare and pours out its share of ratings-getting bloodshed, but it’s also a touching story of family and brotherhood. Winnick and the show are catching fire.\n\nIn real life, Winnick, who is blonde and generally photographed in a sexier light, doesn’t look anything like her warrior role. Truth is, she thrives on physical challenges and Vikings certainly brings them on. “You’re either training on a horse or stunt coordinating, or battle-training with sword and shield—it’s a very intense show for that. Then there’s the challenge of shooting in the weird weather of the mountains in Ireland. It can change on a dime, from sunny – to raining – to hailing – to freezing cold and windy – and back to sunny, and all within an hour and a half. It’s crazy. It’s tough shooting those battle sequences in the rain.”\n\nLike Lagertha, Winnick comes from a strong, close-knit family, and, like Lagertha, she’s someone who can fend for herself. Since the age of 7, she’s been involved in martial arts and holds a third-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and a second-degree black belt in Goju-Ryu karate. “I’ve owned my own dojos and have been teaching women’s self-defense for many, many years,” Winnick says. “It’s a passion of mine to see women transform their inner strength—to see them walk more confidently and be able to protect themselves. It’s really empowering.”\n\nThe 36-year-old Ukranian-Canadian Winnick was born Katerena Anna Vinitska. She grew up speaking Ukranian as her first language until she was 8. She keeps up with the current politics and recent upheaval in Ukraine and hopes to come face-to-face with the country’s imprisoned ex-president, Yulia Tymoshenko—one of her heroes. “It’s encouraging to see that she is enduring…her strength, how she’s inspiring\n\nthe people—even when she’s still behind bars. She was wrongfully imprisoned, and right now Ukraine is going through a revolution. Hopefully she gets out, and hopefully Ukraine survives what’s happening.”\n\nShrinking from fear is not on this girl’s radar. Besides her martial arts expertise, she’s also sky-dived a few times and wouldn’t mind trading places with an astronaut. “It sounds crazy, but I’ve been fascinated about space for a very long\n\ntime. I know it’s the wave of the future and I’d love to be able to go up in space and see the world. I think that would be a magical moment.” Crazy as it sounds, somehow we believe her.\n\nWinnick’s Favorite Things:\n\nRestaurant: Capo in Santa Monica\n\nGetaway: Napa Valley\n\nColor: Blue\n\nHoliday destination: Europe, Italy\n\nMarket: Farmers Market, Santa Monica\n\nFruit: Asian pear\n\nPizza topping: Everything\n\nIce cream: Baskin Robbins\n\nMint Chocolate Chip\n\nWeather: Right before a storm\n\nSong: ‘Hotel California’\n\nMovie: Shawshank Redemption\n\nVANDERPUMP RULES\n\nLisa Vanderpump is out to prove that life begins at 50. She stars on two reality shows, owns two madly successful restaurants with Ken, her hubby of 31 years, and, if that weren’t enough, this year the beauty cha-cha’d her way into America’s hearts on Dancing with the Stars. As our STEPHEN CHRISTOPHER finds, Lisa’s definitely not your typical reality star.\n\nIt’s no secret that luxury fashion brands would no sooner dress high-profile reality stars than, say, the ring girls of the WWE. These brands are all about preserving their image, so they carefully select the models, celebrities and the top fashion magazines they’ll lend their collections to. We know, because we’re one of those magazines.\n\nSo when our stylist went to borrow fashion for this cover shoot with Lisa Vanderpump (who happens to appear on not one, but two reality shows), the brands that are usually thrilled to lend to Genlux suddenly recoiled with trepidation. Emails suddenly stopped being returned, and worse, some publicists just flat out said no. Ouch. But to be truthful, even Genlux has been guilty of shying away from reality stars. The fact is, most of them are prone to bad behavior—especially those on the Housewives franchise. Fortunately, we found this wasn't the case with Lisa.\n\nWhen I mention this blockade to Lisa over lunch at the Luxe Hotel on Rodeo Drive she looks puzzled. \"My reality is certainly very different from a lot of reality people,\" she insists, \"And also, how I conduct my life is certainly not as a trashy reality star. People who know me—even the audience—know I have a strong work ethic. I've also got a sense of humor which is imperative to carry you through this kind of hazardous terrain.\"\n\nLisa’s reality is, indeed, different. She and husband Ken Todd are bona fide business owners with two wildly successful restaurants, Villa Blanca and Sur, and a third, Pump, is on the way. Sur is the subject of a spinoff reality show, Vanderpump Rules, produced by, who else, Lisa Vanderpump. “We really showcase eight of the crazies,” she says smiling, “These kids were always interacting with each other; it isn’t like six degrees of separation—it’s more like two. This one had lived with that one, and this one is seeing that one, and this one is related to that one, and on and on. The kids seem to love the show, and it’s done really well. I’m proud of it.” To which she adds the punch line, “Don’t get me wrong, I’m not proud of their behavior.”\n\nToday Lisa is wearing a tight-fitting size-two Miu Miu dress, white Saint Laurent pumps, and is carrying a pink Louis Vuitton handbag (her signature color) that she claims—pointing to the LV logo with a wink—sports her initials. “For my birthday I really wanted a VIP trip to the San Diego Zoo, and Ken took me. I fell in love with this absolutely delightful panda. He took a liking to me, as I did to him. It was an incredible experience.”\n\nAnyone familiar with Lisa and Ken knows their passion for animals—especially one named Giggy, the ever-present Pomeranian who has appeared on Dancing with the Stars and Ellen, and has a Facebook page with over 14,000 followers. Sadly, Giggy has alopecia. “When we were asked if we wanted to keep him because of the disease, we said, ‘Listen you don’t send your kids back when they’re imperfect, otherwise none of us would have any.’ It affects me so deeply when I see dogs that are being put down. It breaks my heart.” The couple has struggled to find a cure, but unfortunately, they’ve been unsuccessful.\n\nLisa, who just turned 53, admits that it’s been an emotional year for her. There have been moments on Housewives when she’s felt “blindsided” by her cast mates, and then there are the spurious comments on the internet. “I remember the first time something was written about me on an absolutely trashy website, and I remember thinking, ‘Oh, my God!’ and bursting into tears because it was something that I hadn’t said or done. But now I’ve learned not to pay attention to what’s written. It goes with the territory. Listen, if I didn’t want this, I wouldn’t have signed up for it.”\n\nLisa also cha-cha'd her way into America's hearts on Dancing with the Stars. Her dance partner was heartthrob Gleb Savchenko. “There was such a strong feeling. It wasn’t so much an attraction—even though he’s flippin’ gorgeous. I feel we clung to each other for dear life because it was a new experience for both of us. It was terrifying. When you’re dancing with somebody, the physical attraction is there. I had such a strong emotional connection with him, and when we finished dancing after eight weeks of being together all day, every day, I found it was quite difficult to break away. But that was because we went through that experience—almost in isolation. I’m not sure people understand that. Dancing with the Stars is really a young man’s game. I can barely stand for eight hours, much less dance for eight, but I kept up with him.”\n\nAll of which begs the question: Was her husband of 31 years jealous? “Is he jealous? If he’s jealous, he’s done a damn good job of not showing it. Listen, if I saw me dancing with Gleb on Dancing with the Stars—virtually making out with him…all physical barriers are broken down—no way could I watch Ken do that. Oh, I’m jealous! Luckily, he doesn’t give me reason to be jealous. Listen, if he ever gave me a real reason to be jealous, I would kill him,” Lisa says laughing, “If I ever found out he was being unfaithful, I would chop his nuts off and serve them as a special at Villa Blanca.”\n\nAs if she didn’t have enough on her plate, she’s overseeing her daughter, Pandora, and her husband, Jason, who has an MBA in marketing, in the launch of LVP Sangria in two markets this December. “Sangria is so underplayed here in America. It’s a beautiful drink using fresh fruit that’s so refreshing.”\n\nBack to the luxury fashion houses placing reality show security tags on their collections. Well, in the biggest turn of luxury-meets-reality-TV events, Karl Lagerfeld photographed Kim Kardashianfor the cover of Carine Roitfeld’s new magazine, CR. Carine, for those of you who don’t know, is the former editor of French Vogue—the pinnacle of the fashion legitimacy chain. Kim, Kanye West and Carine were also spotted hanging out together at Paris Fashion Week. Gasp. Yes folks, the luxury brands just caved.\n\nArt Direction: Stephen Kamifuji\n\nPhotographer: Tracey Morris / TraceyMorris.com\n\nStylist: Amy Astar / AmyAstar.com\n\nMakeup and Hair: Patrick Tumey / CelestineAgency.com\n\nManicure: Elisa Wishan / TheRexAgency.com using CHANEL\n\nStylist Assistant: Guido Morales Jr.\n\nDigital Tech: Robert Morris\n\nPhoto Assistant: Christian Shenouda\n\nBehind-the-Scenes Video: Ana Maria Manso\n\nArt Director: Stephen Kamifuji\n\nPhotographer: Yoshi Ohara / yoshiohara.com\n\nStylist: Sarah Najafi / sarahsophia.co\n\nHair: Sascha Breuer / Starworks Artists\n\nMakeup: Kristee Liu / Starworks Artists\n\nManicure: Elisa Wishan / The Rex Agency using CHANEL\n\nLocation: Special thanks to Michael Lin and\n\nStephen Bianchi / Camerich LA / camerichla.com\n\nWatch out! Angela Sarafyan can turn on you. One moment she gives photographer Yoshi Ohara coy, cute insouciance—the next she’s the smoldering, sexy seductress. For this up-and-coming actress it’s all in a day’s work.\n\nWhat’s your passion? Acting is my first passion. It’s a part of my growth. I have to express certain things, and with acting I have permission to do that. I love to act because for me it’s actually stepping into the unknown. With each character I grow and learn something new, and it helps me deal with things. In life, we try to get away from what hurts the most, but in acting you get to understand why it hurts, and why this happens, and how you’re going to reach that understanding.\n\nLatest roles? I’m in Paranoia, opposite Gary Oldman, Liam Hemsworth, Amber Heard and Harrison Ford. Also, The Immigrant, the James Gray–directed romantic drama in which I play the younger sister to Marion Cotillard’s burlesque dancer in distress. Oh, and I played Tia in Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn.\n\nWhat are you wearing? I usually wear a dress. Just put it on and go! I prefer vintage clothing because I’m a 50s girl with a small waist. I like finding one-of-a-kind vintage pieces because nobody else will be wearing them.\n\nWhere are you shopping? There’s a place called Cherry Vintage. It’s right on Franklin and Vermont. There’s also a spot called Squaresville.\n\nWhat are you dreaming about? Last night I dreamed about drinking coffee and eating chicken. I really wanted to eat chicken in the middle of the night, so I guess that’s why. And I love coffee. There’s this place called The Oaks Gourmet. They have a dark roast called Graveyard Shift.\n\nWhat are your hobbies? I’m knitting some purple, lavender, and dark blue socks right now for my 8-month-old cousin. But before I say they’re a gift, let’s see how they come out. I also enjoy painting. Whenever I travel, even on the plane, I’m always painting. I was just doing a pilot in Vancouver called I Am Victor with John Stamos, and on the way back I painted these cherries that I’m going to give to him as a gift.\n\nWho’s your ideal mate? It’s got to be a person who is honest, first and foremost, and respectable and loving, and has all the best intentions in the relationship. I try to give those things that I expect from a partner, though it’s not about what I’m getting from the person, but rather what I like to offer: devotion, loyalty, love and sincerity. Hopefully, I’m someone they can trust, and they’re someone I can trust as well. And that’s all. The relationship should make you stronger and happier and more joyous. It should open you up to great possibilities and not stifle you.\n\nWhat’s your fondest memory? When I was six years old and in the first grade, my mom and dad, who were these hippies, really, lied to my school and told them I had this important doctor’s appointment and took me out of class to go to Disneyland. It was the most magical time. I remember it was a Tuesday and it was completely unexpected. They were smirking at each other as we left the school and we all went to Disneyland! I love Disneyland! It’s still by far one of my favorite places to go!\n\nFavorites: Color: Green Movie: Rear Window Number: 47 Restaurant: Figaro on Vermont Composer: Rachmaninoff\n\nErika Christensen bounces into Café Rodeo at the Luxe Hotel dressed casually chic. Her hair is pulled up on her head, and, like a magnet, her engaging smile draws everyone near. She has a sweet cherub-like face that looks much younger than her 30 years—lucky her. The staff begins to notice her as that actress—you know the one—and the buzzing begins.\n\nThe Seattle-born star, who plays Julia Braverman-Graham on NBC’s Parenthood, is dressed in a Steven Alan men’s heather gray button-up, a pair of vintage Chloe sling-back platforms, and a loose-fitting Riller and Fount skirt (that she unashamedly wrestles completely around to read the label). She waxes lyrical of the shows extremely diverse viewership, “That’s one of the most rewarding and amusing things about it. It seems that no matter who you are, you can relate to some part of his group of characters. The actors are so damn talented it’s a joy and major source of pride to work with everyone from Craig T. to Dax and Sam Jaeger to the remarkable Monica Potter and Mae Whitman.”\n\nI ask what's in her Tory Burch handbag and pulls items out one by one, editing as she goes. “Here are some YSL sunglasses, airplane pretzels, receipts, L’Oreal lip-gloss (in Cardinal Plume), and L’Oreal Voluminous mascara. There’s a packet of Justin’s peanut butter, an afro-pick, and some Truvia sweetener.”\n\nMost know Erika from her spot-on performance as Caroline Wakefield in the 2000 crime drama Traffic. In one unforgettable scene, her father, played by Michael Douglas, catches a hooked-on-heroin, drugged-out Caroline in a seedy flat about to do the deed for drug money. The 17-year-old Erika nailed it, like she really was on heroin, or at least extremely drunk. “I did research. I spoke to an ex-user who spent his life overseeing the Narconon drug rehab. I had a lot of questions. If I do a line of coke, how long does it take before I feel it? What does it feel like? What does it look like? How long does it last? When I come down, what does that feel like? What does that look like? It’s funny because it is sooo far from my reality. To me, Tylenol is a drug—which I only did once, when I crashed on my bicycle.”\n\nYou also won’t catch this starlet with a Bellini in her hand or any OTC drugs in her medicine cabinet. She attributes not drinking and staying in the Los Feliz area—far from Robertson and Rodeo Drive—as the reasons you won’t find TMZ cams stalking her.\n\nChalk Erika’s beautiful, clear skin up to a lot of nothing—just good genes. “I do absolutely as little as possible. I wash my face with water. I used the products you gave me today [at the shoot we gifted her with some Sircuit Cosmeceutical products]. The cleanser and the scrub and dry oil. It was all very nice. I also wear very little makeup.”\n\nLike all young women who don’t need Botox—yet—and talk of growing older gracefully (yeah, okay, let’s revisit this in ten years). “I feel like I’ve looked 12 my whole life. So hopefully, some day I won’t look like an old 12-year-old, I’ll look like a woman.”\n\nWhen asked for her most embarrassing fashion moment, she perks up like she’s been waiting for this question all afternoon. She drops her fork, claps her hands and says, “I have it! So I was wearing a bikini top and a skirt, and Jacob the Jeweler was there with all his crazy bling. So I was joking around and I put them on—all of them. I had all these chains down to my belly button—and bracelets, watches and rings,” she says, fanning her hands as if all are covered in jewels. “What was really the nail in the coffin, was when I started making gang signs,” she says cringing, “And then this story comes out about ‘white people who think they’re black.’” The photo, by the way, is still on the internet to haunt poor Erika in perpetuity.\n\nThe lucky man in Erika’s life is Cole Maness, a bit of a celebrity in the cycling community. An avid cyclist herself (yes, she’ll admit to wearing the full-nerd Lycra getup), the two met at a bike race. “He knew who I was, and I knew who he was, so both of us were playing it cool and wouldn’t talk to each other.” So, as any modern relationship goes nowadays, Erika got in touch with Cole via Twitter. Long story short, it took him about three weeks to finally ask her out. Trouble was, she was in New York. Finally, while back in California, she pulls a pretty ballsy texting move. She messages Cole, referring to him in the third person with, “I wonder if I can trick Cole into asking me out to dinner.” Erika attributes the text to one thing: “Being willing to get hurt in love. I’ve been very willing to put myself out there. I’ve even given my number out to strangers. I’ve pursued people.” Cole got the message and the pair has been together for two years since—recently they moved in together.\n\nErika says she owes her dauntless attitude toward vulnerability to her lifelong Scientology training. Both her parents have been involved since they were young. “I knew with my religion that I could fix myself up no matter how badly I got hurt. If I got my heart broken I would be able to fix it and go on. So that allows for a kind of fearlessness artistically, and in love, and in life in general.”\n\nSo what is the deal? With all the good it’s done for Erika and her family, why does her controversial religion get such a bad rap? “Fear of the unknown. It’s so funny because you can go to Barnes and Noble and read Dianetics for like eight dollars. But if you don’t care to learn about it, then you’re left with this unknown. Also, it’s fashionable to make fun of things.”\n\nNot knowing much about it myself, I’ve wondered if Scientology is based on faith, but Erika quickly sums it all up with a food analogy. “My understanding of the word ‘faith’ is ‘belief without proof,’ so then I would say no, Scientology is not a faith. Scientology is like baking a soufflé. Here’s the recipe, check it out, you’ve made a soufflé—good for you. If you ruin the soufflé, then go back and check the recipe. But otherwise, it’s not like I believe that there will be a soufflé—there’s nothing theoretical about it. So then people can hold whatever beliefs they choose about their views on God. I know there are Christian Scientologists, Jewish Scientologists, and a lot of Muslim Scientologists.”\n\nOn the joy of cooking, this vegetable-loving girl takes it up a notch. “The fantasies I would have about men would be cooking for them. Here’s one: I’m making French toast in ‘his’ New York City apartment with pomegranate arils and maple syrup on top. We must assume I’ve spent the night there, since I’m making breakfast. And of course, he loved it. I don’t want to say who he is—I would be too embarrassed. It would be hilarious, but it would be too soon. So give me ten years. We’ll do this interview again when I’m 40. We’ll revisit Botox and my cooking fantasy, okay?” Okay.\n\nErika's Favorites:\n\nFood: This is too practical an answer, but…eggs. I can eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Poached, over-medium, hard-boiled, soft-boiled, scrambled, frittatas, omelets, and tarts, with savory goat cheese. I love eggs!\n\nRestaurant: The Gorbals. Founded and chefed by Ilan Hall. It’s really creative and adventurous. If you’re looking for something light or vegan, this isn’t the place. It’s Scottish-Jewish, but I don’t know what that means. It’s comparable to Animal.\n\nCandy: Dark chocolate.

Tonight is the semifinals of Dancing with the Stars, and amidst the chaos, the former reigning champion and current co-host is poised calmly in a soft vintaget-shirt, Monroe sweats and a trucker hat with “California is for lovers” splashed on the front. Brooke is in pre-Stars mode, before the lights come up and the cameras start rolling, “But in the next five hours,” she quips, “I will be transformed into a princess.”\n\nWhen I think of ‘sexy’ in today’s world, my needle tends to land somewhere between Brigitte Bardot and Beyoncé—beautiful, strong and intelligent, with a fire...someone who can take on life’s challenges and discover unexpected new meaning. And that’s all in a day’s work for this sexy forty-one-year-old mother of four.\n\nBetween hosting a hit show, her two million followers on Facebook and Twitter, blogging for Modern Mom, her developing fitness line, and weekly class in Malibu, the Connecticut-born beauty is at the top of her game. Brooke appeared on season seven of Dancing With The Stars, waltzing her way to TV fame. She received three perfect scores before taking home the coveted mirror-ball trophy in the season finale. “In a funny way, the obnoxious mirror-ball trophy I got for winning was a huge accomplishment, because it represents a lot of things for me,” she says. “It really was about challenging myself, doing something that I’d never done before, learning how to train like an athlete, seeing it through, and then changing my point of view. I don’t think I’ve ever worked so hard at anything, besides raising children.”\n\nWhen asked how she finds balance between her career and being a good mother, spouse and role model, she credits the times when she puts herself first. “I think it’s allowing yourself to be equally important. As a younger woman, that seems like a very selfish concept, but I think a lot of women put themselves last when they become mothers. I really feel that if we make ourselves equally important, and allow ourselves to be a priority in the bigger picture, we’re better women for it.”\n\nShe carves out time with her friends and romantic date-nights with her husband. “I make sure that I take care of the woman inside of me as well.” Because when Brooke isn’t on the dance floor or the red carpet, she’s a jeans girl. She’s a boho-chic, well-worn vintage tee and great pair of shoes girl. And while her stylist on the show, Justin Ducoty, pulls jewels, diamonds and ball gown after ball gown for her, she prefers to spend her off-hours in Helmut Lang. It’s all part of her formula as an icon for the sexy, modern woman. It’s a testament to the idea that ‘being sexy’ goes beyond having a prime-time-worthy body or appearances in Maxim and Health Magazine. It’s about confidence, strength, and femininity defined by a unique sense of self. Feeling sexy at any age requires the commitment to your own happiness at its core. “I think it comes from a very deep place within,” Brooke reflects. “It takes a huge effort, actually, to allow yourself to be sexy, to dress sexy, to smell sexy, to feel sexy.” It’s an important message that she promotes in her fitness classes, as well as her work with the Modern Mom community. “It’s been really rewarding for me to help other women, watch their bodies change, and see them get their self-confidence back. It’s something I really enjoy and believe in. The best gift we can give to ourselves is health, exercise, and confidence.”\n\nFor Brooke, confidence was found not only in her career, but in her family, which continues to be her driving force. “My greatest achievement? Well for sure my four beautiful children. No matter what I ever do in life, nothing will be as great or as important as creating life, nurturing my kids, and raising them to be quality people.” She says her husband, Baywatch alum David Charvet, was her ‘rock’ during one of the most difficult episodes of her life, her scare with thyroid cancer last year. The diagnosis and treatment hit her family hard, but she found strength in their bond, and after surgery made a bold, full recovery. “I’m grateful every single day for my family. And at the top of the list, I’m grateful to have love in my life, to be able to give and receive love.”\n\nWith her life firmly set in overdrive, Brooke maintains a grasp on what’s most important: health, family, and a love of self that’s only earned through time and enduring experience. As she moves forward, facing new challenges on and off the dance floor, she takes stock of where she’s come from in the last few years. “I feel more powerful in my forties, because I understand my wants and my needs, and I have a more grounded voice. I know what I want now, so it’s a totally different experience for a woman.” She explains, “Like the twenties, you’re kind of clueless; the thirties, you’re trying to figure it out; and the forties are sort of like, ‘this is me.’\n\nIt’s definitely a more fulfilling, more powerful, and, well, a sexier time.”\n\nCover Photo Credits:\n\nArt Director: Stephen Kamifuji\n\nPhotographer: Geoffrey Ragatz / RagatzPhoto.com\n\nStylist: Amy Astar / AmyAstar.com\n\nMakeup: Camille Clark / AimArtist.com\n\nHair: Randi Peterson / ArtistsbyTimothyPriano.com\n\nManicure: Anna Stimson / AnnaStimson.com\n\nAssistant: Guido Morales, Jr.\n\nLocation: Special thanks to Ken Todd, Lisa Vanderpump,GZ and Nathalie Zapata Sur Restaurant, WeHo / surrestaurant.com"
