        "text": "London, when he was just 16 years old. That night, Brooke’s life was set on a trajectory she never expected it to take. She founded the Ben Kinsella Trust and began pouring her time and energy into anti-knife crime campaigning, earning herself an MBE for her work in the field.\n\nDuring our heartbreakingly honest conversation, she opens up about what a wonderful uncle Ben would have been, as well as the close bond she’s formed with Linda, who she describes as “a second mum”. And despite the sadness Brooke carries following her brother’s death, her new bundle of joy has given her the biggest reason to smile."
