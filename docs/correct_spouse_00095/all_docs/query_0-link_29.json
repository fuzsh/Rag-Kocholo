        "text": "The producer and director has performed on the stage and big screen as well as in TV series, and he starred in the West End play In My Name in 2008.\n\nHe directed the film Life Sentence which earned him Best UK Short at the East End Film Festival back in 2013.\n\nThe following year Panthaki, 41, was named one of 18 BAFTA Breakthrough Brits and he has since gone on to star in lead roles in many popular TV series.\n\nThe star is on Instagram and he has been sharing plenty of behind the scenes photos from the Away Netflix series.\n\nHe posted a photo with co-stars Vivian Wu, Mark Ivanir and Ato Essandoh with the message: \"Jâ€™adore these people! first ever photo taken of us together, shoot day one (just missing our wonderful Hilary!).\"\n\nPanthaki is known to have dated EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella between 2005 and 2010.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Studios, Panthaki explained what drew him to the role of Ram in Away.\n\nHe said: \"The first page of the script has a list of all the people involved on it...these are incredible storytellers.\n\n\"You immediately know you are in safe hands, these guys know how to tell a story. Then you open up the script...for me personally I'm not particularly a fan of sci-fi, but I love drama.\n\n\"This is a character-driven family drama set in this epic world, it was taking the ordinary in terms of the intimacy and putting the characters into the extraordinary.\""
