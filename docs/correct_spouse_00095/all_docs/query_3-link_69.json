Named after the very best of men. He will do them so proud. I know it already.\"\n\nFriends and family congratulated the couple on Instagram. One post said: \"A perfect gift to ease the pain of a day that took so much from you.\"\n\nBen Kinsella was killed in Islington, north London, as he celebrated finishing his GCSEs. His death led to stricter sentences for knife crime.\n\nThree men were jailed for life in 2009 for his murder."
