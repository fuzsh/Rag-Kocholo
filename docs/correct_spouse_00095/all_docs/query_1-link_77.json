        "text": "COASTAL CLUB  All the Things You Said (wearecoastalclub.bandcamp.com)\n\nCoastal Club is an Ohio band formed in 2017, about a year after The Happy Fits and eleven years after Vampire Weekend, the two bands that most come to mind when listening to this, the bands latest release. While the band has released a few EPs and a handful of singles, and despite the PR materials calling this an EP, Im going to declare its the bands sophomore full-length. At seven songs and 31 minutes, it meets that metric. Their first LP was an expanded version of the EP, I Get Nervous Sometimes. Coastal Club makes joyous pop music with an indie flare, the same sort of songs that endeared me to The Happy Fits when I was first introduced to them during the pandemic. They sound so sunny and warm, even when theyre being a little more introspective, like on Are You There. The song is pulled back in intensity from most of the rest, and you can hear the feelings being expressed. But the synths, drums, guitar, and bass are still bright and bubbly. Its like when youre sad, but youre also happy and know good things are coming, and you cant contain your excitement. Speaking of excitement, Cigarettes, the song that opens the album, is filled with it. Its a song about youthful exuberance, and the song has that in spades. I love the production, mixing solo singing with harmonized backing vocals, and the cuts from quiet parts to massive ones. With songs like this, the band will surely be on a fast rising trajectory, should they want that. Alex Hirlingers lead vocals croon with vibrato, giving the songs a romantic feel and a devil-may-care swagger. When he sings like this, he reminds me a lot of The Happy Fits Calvin Langman. When his vocals smooth out theyre more like Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend. Besides sounding euphoric, the songs on this record seem breezy. You can practically feel the sun on your skin and the ocean breeze blowing through your hair when you listen. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the subtle Too Close, which feels more like watching the sun setting in a city than the beach day of many of the songs. The throbbing in the bass and synths and the mechanical guitar riffs give the song that urban hubbub effect. The lyrics even mention sunlight fades away, which I caught after the music had already given me that vibe. Of all the songs on the record I think my favorites are the first and the last. I already mentioned Cigarettes, but the albums closer, Lost My Head, has the feel being out of time. Its got the atmosphere of a 1920s or 1930s pop tune, but with modern production techniques and instrumentation. I love the way the synths are used to provide a mix of strings and flutes and how the track shimmers with romance, like the pop songs of a century ago. What a bright, fun record!\n\nSAMMY KAY  July 1960 (sammykaynj.bandcamp.com; Sell the Heart Records/Engineer Records)\n\nTake a large spoonful of Americana and another of Tom Waits. Mix together in the studio. Sprinkle liberally with acoustic and steel guitars, mix in some upright bass, and occasionally dust with harmonica. Serve with heartfelt lyrics. Youve now got the recipe for Sammy Kays latest solo LP. The world has changed quite a lot since Kays last LP, civil/WAR. That LP was little livelier and more raucous, even though it was stripped back from earlier efforts. In comparison, July 1960 is softer, gentler, and more introspective. Theres a sense of loss and melancholy in the songs, and in Kays vocals you can feel weariness from bearing the weight of the world. Its a delicate record that, despite the palpable sadness, has a sense of hope. The opening track, How Fast to Run, sings of the slim, slim chance that youll say yes, and offers the time to try. Its acknowledgement of lifes difficulties, but dares to dream of something better. You can hear the loneliness of the road in Greyhound Bus, a song featuring just acoustic guitar, vocals, and harmonica, and you can hear the pensive remembrance of better days in Lovesong. Dont Like Surprises is even more stripped back, to just acoustic guitar and vocals, yet its got the sound of a spiritual. Kays guitar work is simple yet transcendent, and his vocals have the quality of a devotional. Another favorite is the gorgeous waltz, Meet You in Mexico, the steel guitar weeping, dripping tears, and the upright bass providing a deep rumble underneath. Theres a hidden track at the end after A Better Way. Its a wonderful dirge with morose brass choir with the sound of a desperate plea, Kays vocals crying out in a forlorn appeal. Youve seen my past reviews of acoustic material ad I know its not for everybody. But this is a beautiful record.\n\nPALM GHOSTS  \"Façades 2: Masks\" EP (palmghosts.bandcamp.com; Sweet Cheetah Records/Poptek Records)\n\nMasks is the second EP in Palm Ghosts ambitious plan to release four EPs this year, culminating in a double LP collection of all four. Like the first installment, Façades 1: Escape, this installment features five new tracks, but while Escape featured a genre-hopping ride, Masks has more consistency, with a mixture of bright pop and dark brooding post-punk pop. Theres a comparison to The Smiths to be made, with songs sounding brighter than the vocals and lyrics. Joseph Lekkas lead vocals are similar to those of Ian Curtis, the late front man of Joy Division, with a deep baritone croon. That croon borders on lounge singing (in a good way) on the wonderful Hush the Beggars of Love, as Lekkass singing effortlessly glides through the lyrics. Wild in Every Way is a standout for its huge anthemic quality, synths ringing out like bells, even as the vocals are more subtle than on other tracks. Guitars are pulled back in the mix, and have an Americana quality with sliding notes. Another solid effort from Palm Ghosts.\n\nSMUG BROTHERS  Another Bar Behind the Night (smugbrothers.bandcamp.com; Anyway Records/Just Because Records)\n\nThe last time I reviewed a Smug Brothers release it was the Emerald Lemonade EP, at the end of 2022. In that review I commented that they were clearly influenced by power pop and British Invasion pop, that the music was enjoyable, but that the songs were awfully short and seemed to be fragments rather than fully realized songs. Several months after that, they released a full length LP, and nearly a year after that we have a new 6-song EP. The power pop and British Invasion influences are still there, but so are others. And though some of the songs are still quite short, at right around the one-minute mark, they feel more fleshed out, more complete. Javelina Nowhere opens the EP with a delicate pop tune that has a definite retro sound, with guitars jangling and a flute providing embellishment. The flute is particularly lovely, and the injection of surf guitar licks provides a Southern California beach sound. We get psych-glam pop in Seamus and the Younger, and Alexander for Two uses acoustic guitar and keyboards playing a rising chord progression to create something well suited for a stage production. But its Shedding Polymer thats the biggest departure from the bands usual sound. Though its still a power pop song, it has a grittier sound, mixing garage and grunge elements in. Good stuff.\n\nCARE AGAIN  Sit Outside (careagainmusic.com)\n\nThis is a precious record. Its simply adorable. Its the work of Brandon Kerrigan (Kerrigan  Care Again. See what he did there?) and the dozen songs on the album feature charming psychedelic folk pop songs layered with ambient sounds, synths, tape loops, and other miscellaneous sounds. From the very start, in the song Stoic, we can hear the sounds of water dripping alongside a swirling guitar, and the vocals start out pulled way back in the mix, drawing closer to the forefront until the bouncy pop song begins in earnest with harmonized multi-tracked singing. The tune is drenched in reverb, and it slows considerably at the hallway mark, taking on a more wistful feel. In Allergies, its the synths turn to swirl, layering on top and beneath the simple guitar, bass, and drums, while the vocals take on the mien of an old lounge pop song. Coo starts as a collection of various sounds, including what appears to be rubbing of plastic on plastic (and sounding like flatulence), then ukulele comes in with a bright melody, joined by sparkling synths and upbeat vocals. Understood is a short transitional piece with the sound of a melancholy dirge that leads into the ethereal folk song, Slipping, which sounds lie something that could have been written for the late Julee Cruise to sing in a David Lynch film. Then we get Stay the Night, which channels a twisted lullaby, and Concentrate, a delicate breezy tune played with ukulele, guitar and various bits of percussion. REM is a pretty acoustic folk tune with the soft sounds of a dream (REM, of course, being Rapid Eye Movements, the dreaming stage of sleep). The track even ends with the distant sounds of classical music as if from a dream. Visions of a Hand begins with less of a dream and more of a nightmare, with mechanical sounds, cold vocals, and an ominous scraping. Piano comes in playing a waltz and harmonized vocals dance on it. Waiting on Them is another waltz, this time with an old piano giving the song that feel of an old run down circus. Muddy Melancholy is a unique one; it sounds like a pagan folk song mixed/alternating with a Victorian dance tune. And the album appropriately closes with The End. The sounds of sloshing water give way to a quiet ukulele tune. I love the experimental nature of this album. I love the soft tones. I love the romanticism of it. And I love the playful spirit of adventure clearly evident throughout the songs.\n\nTHE CHALLENGED  Exposed (thechallenged.bandcamp.com)\n\nThe Challenged describe themselves as Your favorite 90s punk records eaten by a wild hog and excreted into a Brooklyn alley. Its a humorous description for a band thats been around for the better part of two and a half decades, but I would more kindly describe them as 90s punk mixed with indie rock. The songs are crunchy enough to fit into the punk camp, but also melodic and tight enough to be described as indie rock. The songs sound bright, too, but the lyrics are dark. For example, the title track has a strong rhythm and a huge epic sound, but lyrics detail hurt and betrayal in an intimate relationship. Remains has a great poppy punk sound, but the lyrics deal with dying of cancer. I hear hints of Hüsker Dü's in Bedhead, though the song has harmonized vocals and is less gruff and softer around the edges. Other songs are about breakups, dragging around the baggage of past mistakes, and throwing out the good things in life as we try to shed the bad. The band even gives a nod to ska punk with Losing Control, a song that swings back and forth between 90's indie rock and 3rd wave ska punk. But its What We Deserve that hits the spot the most for me. Its the most raucous track of the album, singing about overthinking things and neglecting to enjoy the moments that will soon be gone, never to come again. The Challenged isnt just the sound of 90's nostalgia, theyve got a vital sound played with enthusiasm.\n\nCLOWN SOUNDS  Par for the Curse (recessrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nClown Sounds had its genesis in some songs front man Todd Congelliere (or Todd C, as hes known from FYP, Toys That Kill, and Underground Railroad to Candyland) had written that didnt quite fit with any of his bands. Even though theyre mostly made up of the same people, each band has its own sound. So he released them solo with the title Clown Sounds. Because Todd C hates playing solo, Clown Sounds became yet another band, featuring some familiar and some new members. It now features Todd C on guitar and vocals, Jimmy Felix on drums, Isaac Thotz playing bass and singing some vocals, Jacob Gaxiola, also playing guitar and singing, and Trevor Rounesville on drums and additional percussion. Thotz is best known from The Arrivals and his band Treasure Fleet, which plays music that splits its time between psych and indie/punk. Clown Sounds has a similar vibe, but ranges a little more widely in its influences. Even Todds other bands influence these songs. Cut It Off, for example, which opens the record, has the same sort of loping rhythm and repetitive riffs URTC is known for. But the there are nice indie touches through the song, with sections that are noisy and distorted like Treasure Fleet and others that are quiet and clean(er) with an introspective feel. I really like Primetime Recount, with a more raucous garage-punk-grunge feel and lyrics that bounce around in a call and response. It sort of mixes the garage grunge of TTK with Treasure Fleets bright pych punk feel. Deeper into both grunge and psych is Tuck Belly Up, and its got some retro wah-wah guitar solos going on, bouncing back and forth between the speakers. Its minimalist melody is very Treasure Fleet-like. Most of the tracks are like this, with a mix of garage punk, grunge, indie rock, and psych. But a couple of them are very different. Beyond Control features reggae rhythms, deep bass, and dub-like production, but the melody and fuzz-filled vocals and guitars are very non-reggae. And Chicken on the Lamb is an odd jam, a funk-rock instrumental with occasional heavily processed shouting about chicken. This track confused the hell out of me, and it feels completely out of place. Even more so than Beyond Control. Clown Sounds has a much looser feel than Todd C or Isaacs other bands, and I dont mean sloppy. The band members all play very solidly. Its just that they seem to be having a hell of a lot of fun, more like friends playing together and having a blast.\n\nLORD BUFFALO  Hocus Bolus (Blues Funeral Recordings; lord-buffalo.bandcamp.com)\n\nBlues Funeral Recordings is a label that says it focuses on heavy stoner doom psych metal, and past reviews of the band seem to all be from metal media outlets. But I hear no metal and no stoner rock in Hocus Bolus, Lord Buffalos third full-length LP. Nor do I hear anything that could be called heavy. I do hear a foreboding sense of doom, though, and the dustiness of the lonely, dark backcountry, places where the unwary meet an untimely fate. In this sense, I hear strong influence from Swans. The darkness through these tracks is palpable, and the use of strings, sometimes risky in rock music, is absolutely spot-on here. They add to the eeriness, and the massive distortion in the guitars and bass lays down a thick layer of noise. Slow Drug has a slow deliberate pace, guitar harmonics creating a sinister sound, and what may be brass instruments or processed vocals introduce a nightmarish guttural sound. The rhythm comes from a low note on a piano, and the entire effect is supernatural and chilling. I love Malpaisano, a lament that starts out thinly arranged, with single note bass lines leaving plenty of space, weeping synths and guitar, and pleading vocals. Past the halfway mark, we get some emphatic, rich minor chords with deep bass. Its truly spine chilling stuff. I Wait on the Door Slab is very different, still dark, but with a twisted pop sensibility. Violins and ambient noise permeate the track as the rhythm section tries desperately to maintain a song structure and beat, but the song tries to tear itself apart in noisy mayhem. The closing track is the instrumental, Rowing in Eden, and it may be my favorite among an album full of outstanding tracks. Theres a droning tentative quality to it from the strings, and a misty supernatural essence in the track. Lord Buffalos Hocus Bolus is a jaw-dropping masterpiece.\n\nUNICORN DOGS  Age Typical Junk Behavior (unicorndogs.bandcamp.com)\n\nI love band bios, because theyre usually unrealistic hyperbole, but when Unicorn Dogs asks us, What if Dillinger Four had stayed on Mutant Pop Records? What if the Copyrights and Dear Landlord had a secret love baby with Hospital Job and Houseboat? I can honestly answer it would probably end up sounding a lot like Unicorn Dogs. The Baltimore band (hey, Insub fans!) play short, fun pop-punk songs (only one songs makes it past the two minute mark) that are noisy, chaotic, and exciting. The opening blast, We Seek Revenge, is a song about holding grudges for all the wrongs done to us, the name calling, and all the times weve been left out of fun. Going along with this theme is Loved, about wanting to belong, wanting to be heard and understood, and, yes, wanting to be loved. The song is simple, but poppy in the best pop punk way. I adore the lovely guitar riffs of Multitudes, and Office Job is something we can all relate to, about the daily grind and the boredom of mindless work. The song is darker than most, and more grating, just like that jay-owe-bee job we all hate. I like the bouncy Screwed Together, a song about sticking with each other through all the awful things that always happen. Again, its a very simple melody, but its like all those great pop punk songs you always heard at Insub Fest or Awesome Fest. Theres nothing groundbreaking on this album, but damn, it makes me miss those fests. The noisy lo-fi production is perfect for this band, adding to the pandemonium. If youre a fan of raucous rackety pop punk, youre gonna love this one.\n\nTHE DRIN  Elude the Torch (Feel It Records,thedrin.bandcamp.com)\n\nThe Drin play music that feels noisy and loose, with psych meets Joy Division sounds. Its part experimental, part pagan ritual, part psychedelic (both music and substances), part blues, and part indie alternative. Songs often have recorded field sounds mixed in or as intro/outro. The songs are always drenched in reverb and are full of drones and trance-inducing repetition. There are hints of the retro, too, with sounds of 60s Bob Dylan sometimes showing up. The title track mixes Revolution Summer DC emo with droning psych and, especially toward the end of the track, as the guitar tone takes on the sound of bagpipes. A favorite track is Tomorrows Just Laughin, which has the sound of an ancient folk tune with flutes, violin, acoustic guitar, and a tribal rhythm. The repeated beats and riffs are truly hypnotic. I like, too, Scars of Places. It opens with mysterious sounds, and then a rhythm starts and the track becomes an ancient dance with 80s deadpan drone vocals. With a more melodic song structure, Lease on Life has a 60s mod pop sort of sound, but the repetitive droning is still ever present. ?e? e?sa?, e?t??e? is a song in Greek, the title of which translates to You Are Not OK. Its got a spare sound, with loads of reverb and vaguely Greek sounding strummed instruments. Youll feel like youre in an underground punk taverna. The final track has two pieces, No One Knows For Sure and Prato della Valle (Valley Meadow), the latter of which is beautiful ambient sounds with a piano thats been processed to sound soft and muffled. Its a calming way to end a tumultuous LP. Inventive and fascinating.\n\nOLIVER IGNATIUS  Elf Army (oliverignatius.bandcamp.com)\n\nElf Army is a stylistically wide-ranging LP with lots of different sounds and genres represented. Theres an air of experimentalism through the songs, too, pushing the boundaries of what an album can be. Many of the songs are about death, loss, and grief, as Ignatius has experienced much of it in recent years. The opening track, The Harmonies, for example, starts with mysterious chanting and a cacophony of instruments before resolving into an ethereal song featuring heavenly harmonized vocals singing about the totality of existence. Every single side of the story / Anything less is a lie / Everything sits perfect in harmony / Ground is just the absence of sky, the song declares, as if to admonish us to end bias, to consider everything in context and be at peace with the world. Dan McLane Blues is a honky-tonk piano blues ode to a close friend who passed away. Dan was one of the most beautiful and inspiring beacons of light I've ever known, says Ignatius, like a cross between Johns Lennon and Belushi, truly the best of us, and it breaks my heart to realize he may not have known it. I needed to give him his hymn.\" Theres the Beatles-inspired track, Treason, and theres a smooth relaxed cover of Teenager in Love, the 50s doo-wop hit, blending country twang, dreamy soul, and easy listening. And theres a twisted blues song, I Keep On Singing the Death Cult Blues, another song reflecting loss and dealing with grief. Theres also a reference in the song to the fact that Ignatius grew up in a family of journalists, something that led to his living in various places around the world as a child. You can trust me! Ignatius shouts. After all, my family were journalists / And as a journalist / Its just my duty to tell the news. The song speaks to the deterioration of true journalism in our day and age. If you like folk-rock and love songs youll adore She Waits for Me, with acoustic guitars plucking an accompaniment to the harmonized vocals, as strings swell in the background. The vocal harmonies and pretty melody remind me a lot of Simon and Garfunkel. Violence by a Man Against a Woman is a lyrically disturbing song, and its sonically unbalancing, about domestic abuse and women who feel trapped in such relationships. Pacific Ocean Blues is pure funk, but processed through reverb, the instrumentals sounding compressed and the vocals sounding distant. And I Will Walk is the ultimate reminder that the deaths of close friends and family brings that our turn comes, too. And pretty soon Ill be gone, the refrain sings. But the song is also an admonishment to make the most of our limited time on earth, as it delicately tell us Every moment counts / Every bit of it matters! The album closes with the sort retro psychedelic title track that tells us that, despite the hardships hes endured, Ignatius will keep on making music. Whether Im wrong, whether Im right / Oh, Lord, here comes the bite / Ill do it in song, Ill sing when I write / Oh, Love, Ill do it in spite. I will look forward to it.\n\nSTEVEN LEE LAWSON  \"Help Is On the Way\" EP (Snappy Little Numbers Quality Audio Recordings, www.snappylittlenumbers.com)\n\nSteven Lee Lawsons new four-song EP is a wide-ranging one, featuring songs ranging from folk to country to indie. Sometimes more than one of these genres influences a single song, though folk seems to predominate. All four have a relaxed vibe with a delicate feel. The first track, Mist Between the Stops, has the strongest indie rock content, with full electric band, but also with acoustic guitar and twangy moments that meld country and rock. Lawsons vocals are a clear and smooth croon, and despite the easy mien to the song, its got energy. Crate the Sea is countrified folk, with acoustic guitar and fiddle. Lawsons singing is perfect for the song, with lyrics reflecting a feeling of loss of control, likening ones life to both a dog in a crate or being trapped in a boat drifting off shore. Its delicately played, reflecting the ending of the story, in which love is found despite lifes hardships. Ramblin Prince is a breezy folk-rock tune that warms up with electric organ, and the prominent acoustic guitar riffs sound great. The end of the track features a dark electric instrumental version of the song that seems somewhat out of place. And Aint Good Enough is pure folk, with Lawsons vocals the biggest and boldest of the EP, accompanied just by acoustic guitar and subtle backing vocals. This is a quietly gorgeous EP.\n\nWILD POWWERS  Pop Hits and Total Bummers Vol. 5 (Nadine Records, nadinerecords.com)\n\nWild Powwers is an excellent example of how you can do more with less. The Seattle band is a mere trio, consisting of Lara Hilgemann (vocals, guitar), Jordan Gomes (bass), and Lupe Flores (drums, vocals). Yet they sound so much bigger. The bands sound ranges from tough and noisy to lush and poppy to ethereal and dreamy, so the sounds are disparate, but theyre all compelling. Looper, the album opener, for example, features prominent bass with rapid strumming, fuzzed guitar, manic drums, and powerful lead vocals. The result is ordered chaos centered around a unifying melody. The variety continues with Wild Reprise, which blends grunge and indie pop, while Sams Song has a lovely pop melody but the production, filled with reverb and echoes of drum and guitar noise, gives it a cool hollow sound. Listen to the bass growl ferociously on Gossamer, even as the vocals belt out a sweet pop tune. Those sweet vocals turn hard and cold on Guided, a song with a lonely angry tone. Theres a sense of resignation, too, with a chorus that has lyrics like This house is burning down, but whatever. The final pair of tracks, Space Given and Baby Teeth may be my favorite of all. Space Given starts out much like the other tracks, with a loping pace, noisy instrumentals, and gorgeous crooning vocals, but the ending is filled with otherworldly ambient sounds. Baby Teeth is the most relaxed song of the album, with a very calming sound, hushed tones, and a melancholy feel. The song rises and falls, like waves or the tide. At the halfway mark you hear those waves come crashing down as the music swells. Everything settles down at the end, the waters calm, everything is serene. You can tell Wild Powwers is a trio, because you can sense the empty spaces between instruments. But the nine songs on this LP also sound richer and thicker than they have any business doing. And the contrasts between hard and soft, tough and gentle, noisy and smooth are amazing.\n\nZATOPEKS  Loitering & Sauntering (Stardumb Records, www.stardumbrecords.com)\n\nAfter a decade of recorded silence, Zatopeks, one of Britains greatest musical exports, returns with a new full-length LP. The Zatopeks fit into the broad category of Ramones-core, with simple chord changes and frantic playing. But theyre more than that. The music has influences as disparate as retro doo-wop and 80s Oi. The lyrics are insightful and intelligent, focusing on politics and economics. Such as the opening track, the damning Kings of the Hotel Mile. The song references the hope for change coming out of the punk movement of the 1980s, and its dismal failure. We were left with gentrification, stagnant minimum wages, the dual fascism of the market economy and Christian Nationalism, and censorship that has left the population ignorant and subservient. Fine Sunny Day has a melody as bright as its title, but it sings a dark song of a perverted justice system that imposes harsh punishment for minor infractions. I love the dark garage punk of Central European Time and the folksy doo-wop ballad about urban decay and high unemployment of Blueprints of an Unlived Life. Then theres the raucous cover of the anti-fascist song of the Spanish Civil War, Jarama Valley. It was originally adapted as a folk song by Pete Seeger decades ago, but in the Zatopeks hands its turned into a rousing anthem thats just as applicable today is it was over a hundred years ago. At the Stadium is a shiny ska-influenced dance-hall tune, with the added brightness and warmth of an electric organ. Doo-wop and ska rhythms mix for a great skankin time. The strongest punk tune of the album is The Hairstyles of Mieczyslaw Rakowski, a rowdy Dead Kennedys-like tune that likens the changes of politics to changes in hairstyles, and how capricious and arbitrary both seem to be. Rakowski, for those who dont know, was a Polish politician who served a term as Polands prime minister and was involved in the suppression of the Solidarity movement. Over his career he often changed his politics, sometimes siding against censorship and other times for suppression of popular movements meant to increase freedoms. The closing track, Angel of the Old Town, is dramatically different from the rest. It starts as a lithe ballad before turning into a loud crunchy ballad. The lyrics are a bit cryptic, but what I take away is that its about always feeling out of place, no matter where you are. Its something I can relate to. Its great to have Zatopeks back, especially with such an excellent reintroduction as this album is.\n\nTHE DROLLS / GENTLEMEN ROGUES  Split (Snappy Little Numbers Quality Audio Recordings, www.snappylittlenumbers.com)\n\nEach band contributes an original and a cover for their side of this 7 EP. The Drolls have a great garage meets power pop sound, and on this split their original is Burned Out, a solid tune with a powerful edge and perfect power pop melody. Their cover is Happy Hour, originally recorded by The Housemartins back in 1986. Its edgier and more energetic than the lighter pop original. On the B-side, Gentlemen Rogues start out with Young Til We Die, their original contribution. Its power pop meets pop punk with a crunchy yet breeze sound. Their cover is The Rolling Stones Connection. Its an early stones song from way back in 1967, when they were much more R&B influenced than in later years. Gentlemen Rogues take bears little resemblance to the original other than the melody and lyrics. The arrangement is much thicker and raucous, full of growling guitars, thumping bass, and pounding drums. The four songs are all enjoyable.\n\nCHASER  Small Victories (Thousand Islands Records, thousandislandsrecords.com)\n\nChaser are a Southern California band that play 90s era melodic punk music. Songs are sung with plenty of harmonized backing vocals, the guitars and bass are crunchy as hell, and the songs have melodies halfway between punk and pop punk, so theyve got plenty of tunefulness. And the band plays like theyve got something to prove. The result is an album chockfull of explosive energy and passion. The title, according to the band, is how many people struggle through life and beat themselves up when they dont achieve goals. Chaser want us to, instead, celebrate those small victories in life, because over time they add up to a lot. Indeed, many of the thirteen tracks of this LP have a big feeling of joyousness, commemoration, and even solemnity. The opening track, Brand New Enemy is a call to action, as they sing, to take back control of our lives and change the world for the better. Its a clarion call, and a fiery way to begin. I enjoy the poppier melody in Flying High, a glorious track with plenty of whoa-ohs in the backing vocals and an uplifting sound. Sugar Pills, too, has a sweet poppy melody, even as its got aggressive playing, making it an instant favorite. The band obviously sees Bad Religion as an influence, as evidenced in songs like the title track and Control the Bleed, speedy crunchy tracks with simple melodies and positive lyrics. The closing track, A Revel Song, is well named, because it sounds like a celebration. The whole record should be celebrated. Chaser may think they have something to prove, but in my book theyve proven it over and over. If youre a fan of the 90s melodic punk sound you need to listen to this record, because its at the top of the genre.\n\nEXEDO  The Body Remembers (Dirt Cult Records, dirtcultrecords.com)\n\nDirt Cult is once again branching out into new territory. Their latest release features a Chicago area band that plays a mix of goth and post punk. This is an album with a dark vibe to match the topics they sing about. The bands name, Exedo, is a Latin word that means, to eat up, or devour. The band sings songs about the wastefulness of people, the overconsumption of resources, and the resulting destruction. Vocalist Christine Wolf has a big dynamic range, able to move from a quiet whisper to huge roar. Her vocals contribute greatly to the sense of distress and ardor in the songs, as do the modality of the chords and the cutting guitar tone. Often these sorts of bands tend to sound the same song-to-song on an album, and Exedo does seem to fall into this trap for the most part. They do have a song like Signs of You, though, that though it has the same modal dark tone, its done in waltz time, and Wolfs vocals seem to glide and soar, making this a real standout. The way her vocals are pulled back in the mix with added reverb make the song feel very mysterious and spiritual, too. Credit to whoever produced that. And the title track has more of a chugging forward motion to it than the other songs, with hints of surf and garage, particularly in the guitar sound. Future Danger has a punker vibe than the rest of the album, too, with some angular chord changes. I like the bands sound, and theyre very proficient at it. But its the sort of sound I enjoy sparingly, and eleven songs in a row of the same sound gets to be a bit much for me. The differences even in the standout tracks are fairly subtle.\n\nSLITASJE  Mandag Morgan (Dirt Cult Records, dirtcultrecords.com)\n\nAnother new release from Dirt Cult that sounds different from past releases! Slitasje hail from Norway, though vocalist Sushila is Swedish, and had been living and working in Trondheim. She and bassist Karl-Martin had been discussing making music together, and the pandemic closures allowed them the time to do so. So Slitasje is a fairly new band, and as far as I can tell, Mandag Morgan is their debut EP. As a new band, they may still be exploring what they want their sound to be, because there are a variety of sounds in the six songs here, ranging from post-hardcore to indie rock to poppy punk. The opening track, En Slags Love, which I think translates to A Kind of Love, is hard and crunchy with shifting rhythms in a post-hardcore sort of way. Its exciting and energetic, and though its got non-English lyrics, Im still moved by it. Taggarna (The Tags) has a mid-80s DC Revolution Summer proto-emo sound, which I adore, with Sushilas singing much more tuneful than most of the genre. The instrumental break in the middle of the track, with guitar and bass, is gorgeous. Ett (One) is another DC style song, but a little poppier than expected. And Iskyla continues the EPs evolution toward a more poppy punk sound. Starkare (Stronger) features aggressive pop punk, while Bruksslitasje (Wear and Tear) is a full on indie song, less aggressive, more tuneful, with a relaxed loping tempo and a sense of fun. Given my idolization of the DC scene, those middle tracks are my favorites, but the band do a fantastic job here. Recommended.\n\nHUNGRYTOWN - Circus for Sale (Big Stir Records, bigstirrecords.com)\n\nCircus for Sale is the perfect title for this LP, because, as there is with many circus folk, theres a sense of melancholy in this bands music, even as some of these songs try to be outwardly bright. I hear influences from folk, psych, and movie soundtrack music of the 70s in the dozen songs on this LP. The songs are delicate and gentle, Rebecca Halls vocals sweet and sorrowful. Theres an almost spiritual feel to the songs, as if theyre coming from another plane of existence, ethereal and unreal. Man of Poor Fortune is a favorite track here, with a vaguely Celtic melody and featuring violin as counterpoint to guest vocalist Rachael Birkins singing. What sounds like a concertina blends with a heavenly chorus of backing vocals to provide a lush setting for the song, as a guitar plucks quietly. Theres a distinct sadness to the song, appropriate for the murder ballad subject matter. Likewise, the Bert Jansch song, Morning Brings the Dew, which blends electric and acoustic guitars with Halls angelic vocals, has hints of Celtic folk. Its got an otherworldly feel, with the hushed sound of daybreak when sometimes it seems like youre the only person alive and awake in the world. I also adore the title track, which has a real feel of an ancient run-down circus. You can hear the hurdy-gurdy playing and get a sense of the better days the circus has seen, before it fell out of favor and into disrepair. The song was inspired by an actual circus for sale, as described to Hall and her husband and musical partner, Ken Anderson on a trip to the north of England. Later in the album is an epilogue to this song, Gravity, speaking of the skill and showmanship of the man on the flying trapeze, but how there is no longer anyone to see his daring feats, and a reminder that the circus is for sale. You can hear both the sadness and the pride, as a cello gently weeps along to the waltz time rhythm that tries desperately to sound bright. A hammered dulcimer provides just the right texture to revive images of past glory from long ago. Hungrytowns fourth LP is beautiful and charming.\n\nNO TEETH  Decadence in Breeding (Post Post Music, no-teeth.bandcamp.com)\n\nMixing orchestral brass instruments, rock and roll guitars, bass, and drums, quirky synths, art house vocals, and an immense amount of chaos, No Teeth is here to confound you. The Newcastle UK band play music like no one else, and either youre going to get it or you wont. There is no in-between. This is challenging stuff, and I love it. Experimental, angular songs loaded with noise and chaos are par for the chorus, with a post punk meets jazz meets industrial attitude. The album opens with a short instrumental fanfare of sorts, Concordia (Is It Chin). It sounds like a post-apocalyptic processional of the future, when tribalism has taken over the world and superstitions reign supreme. It gives you a taste of whats to come, as you traverse this musical landscape. The vaguely jazz-funk Stealing for My Own Gain comes next, with brass playing a repeating line that climbs while vocals rap-sing and the bass and drums chug along. A Horse Named Panty Raid reminds me of a bold sassy strip tease number, but loaded with dissonance and chaos. I Am Not an Officer is a real favorite, with its sharply angular melodic line and powerful bass. Life Without Meaning sounds like NOMEANSNO dropped acid and had a panic attack, with a snarling prominent bass and frantic guitars and synths. Canon McCoy is a twisted lounge tune that morphs into insane ethnic folk, while Feed the Ducks is a crazy bluesy tune with a dusty western underpinning. This is just a sample of whats in store for you on this LP. The music rocks, it shimmers, it howls, scrapes, and screams, and the lyrics are poetry, delivered with sardonic vocals. It harkens back to a massively creative period of music in the late 70s and early 80s, when musical genres were being torn apart and reconstructed, when rules no longer applied. This is nothing short of brilliant.\n\nSMOKERS  The Rat That Gnawed the Rope (Mouth Magazine Records, mouthmagazine.bandcamp.com)\n\nAfter about a decade of touring up and down the west coast and releasing a handful of EPs and singles, Oaklands Smokers now have their proper full-length debut LP. The quartet consists of Andy Asp (formerly of Nuisance and The Pattern), Cyrus Comiskey (of Black Fork and Drunk Horse), Jim Nastic (Talk is Poison and Year Future), and Omen Starr (St. James Infirmary). They call what they play Oakland pub rock, and thats a pretty on point description. The fifteen tracks here are hyped up rock and roll with an indie/punk resume. Many of the songs have a pressing insistence, as if theyre imparting the most important information of the moment. One of the best tracks of the album is the hopping Silver Tongue, a quick-paced track with a big bounce and a jazzy mien. Tremolo picking in the guitar is particularly effective at adding urgency to the song. Many of the songs are just plain old rock and roll, albeit played with a nice gritty greasy attitude. A good example of this is Forest Queen, sound like something out of the 70s that would be at home sharing the stage with Motorhead. And there are songs with more of an early punk vibe, like Kalifornia Kampground, from the vocals to the bass and guitar tone to the chord progression. Most tracks fall somewhere between those two poles. Theres certainly plenty of energy on this LP. But tempos rarely vary, rhythms barely stray, and the tone doesnt change much. I wonder if theres too little variance from song to song to hold ones interest past a few songs.\n\nSUBB & MUDIE  Cat Songs (Thousand Islands Records, thousandislandsrecords.com)\n\nTwo of the bright lights in Montreals punk scene team up on this benefit and memorial EP. Subb and Mudie join forces to pay homage to the late Kim Shattuck, covering The Muffs Outer Space and End It All. A portion of proceeds from the sale of this EP will be donated to The ALS Foundation. Their version of Outer Space is a bit quicker in pace and smoother in texture, compared to the original, so it comes out like a power pop tune. And the cover of End It All trades the jangly indie of the original for folksy acoustic. Theyre both interesting new takes. The other half of the EP features each covering the other. Subb covers Mudies Post Pyong, with a cool punk meets smooth jazz meets dub track. Mudie returns the favor, with a rendition of Subbs Rodney Dangerfield. Its a great nerdy pop punk meets grunge track, with poppy melody, harmonized backing vocals, power pop melody, and gritty guitars and bass. It all adds up to a unique EP for a good cause.\n\nWILD YAKS  Monumental Deeds (Ernest Jenning Recording Company, www.ernestjenning.com)\n\nEven without the PR materials telling me that The Wild Yaks hail from Rockaway Beach, New Jersey, I could tell they were from the greater New York City metro area. In fact, they come from Rockaway Beach in Queens. Their songs have a distinct urban feel and a many have a general vibe of triumph, with elements of funk, jazz, and garage rock and more than a dab of retro attitude. Some songs use a heavy and dirty guitar tone, imparting a garage surf sound. All of the songs have a cool sense of urgency, and are worthy listens, but a few stand out to me. The opener, Crazy People grabbed me right away, channeling the pulse of the city, a melting pot of sounds and thoughts. See the Light is a bright broad folk-rock anthem, while Love/Liar best encapsulates the Wild Yaks sound, with a pulsing Latin beat, garage rock feeling from the farfisa, and some incredible funky bass and guitar riffs. While all of the band members participate in some massive backing vocals, Rob Bryns persuasive lead vocals demand your attention for some life and death matter. That quality really makes Desperado, which has a pleading quality, strictly from those vocals, even as the keyboards provide a fluttering ethereal quality. But its the franticly dark See that Girl that I love the most. Its a garage punk song out of a mod horror film about sour grapes over the unattainable. See that girl? Like that girl? What makes you think youre the only one? the chorus queries. All that glitters aint gold, the song declares, as if to say if you cant get the girl, she probably wasnt good anyway. The song also mentions a variety of things one might want to be but cant. Its a wild ride of a song. And its a wild ride of an album. Recommended!\n\nAERIAL  Activities of Daily Living (Kool Kat Musik; aerial.bandcamp.com)\n\nHailing from misty Scotland, Aerial sing songs that are bright and sunny, in direct contrast to their homelands reputation for clouds and drizzle. This new LP comes an entire decade after their last release, 2014s Why Dont They Teach Heartbreak at School? The eleven tracks here are loaded with earworms thatll stick in your brain, with most of the tracks being bright upbeat power pop. The title track, for example, uses sparkling keyboards and close harmony in the backing vocals to add a sparkle to a somewhat melancholy melody. I really like Pixelated Youth, which has a powerful pop punk feel, but with a poppier power pop melody, plus those great harmonized backing vocals. And Bad Tattoo, about having an embarrassing tattoo that you try to keep covered, is a fun one that many can related to. A few tracks are more ballad-like and dont do much for me. Hollywood Ghosts comes across as an AM radio bubblegum tune, and is a bit too slick to my ears. Run These Lights sounds like the dreaded adult contemporary genre. And in unfortunate album tracking, Debutante comes immediately after. Its another quiet ballad, featuring piano, cello, and strings (or string synth). This ones pretty enough, but coming right after another ballad gives the album a long lull in the action. The album ends with another pair of ballads, Silversand Beach and Far Away July. Overall the album is a mixed bag for me. When Aerial focuses on upbeat power pop theyre a lot of fun to listen too. But too much of this album is filled with dull AM pop ballads for my tastes.\n\nANNABEL  Worldviews (Tiny Engines, www.tinyengines.net)\n\nAnnabel is another band thats returned to activity after nearly a decade on hiatus. The Ohio band has a core of brothers Ben and Andy Hendricks (and, as the PR materials say, as long as they have each other well always have Annabel). This new LP, coming nine years after their last, explores how the world has changed during their absence. The dozen tracks on offer generally have an indie-emo sound, indie rock with a dreamy yet emotional aura. Vocals are delivered with passion while the instrumentals present an ethereal wall of sound. The opening track, Another World, explains that the band has A new start yet they still feel young at heart, that I fear what I am, but not enough to change, and that the changes around them make them feel like Im from another world. The songs are lush, with wonderfully ambient shimmering background to the jangly guitars that swell and fill the speakers, the bass providing a simple yet profound punctuating sound. Songs are sometimes urgent, like All the Time, giving a harried frantic feel. Others are more subdued, like We Are Where We Are, a commentary on the numbing and isolating qualities of mass media and social media. I love the quietly gorgeous Every Home Needs a Ghost. The delicate song features scratchy guitar tone, giving the song the sound of aching age, while the lyrics speak to the need for us all to have voices that tell us when its time to move on and make changes in our lives. A ghost lives in my home / And told me I should leave / Youve been here long enough / And I agree. The upbeat Dog is about how many of us are like the infamous dog in the fire meme, always saying everything is fine while everything is collapsing around us. If you were a fan of the indie-emo sound from the late 1990s and early 2000s, this is for you. Its quite lovely.\n\nHOTLUNG  In Spite Of (Sell the Heart Records; hotlung.bandcamp.com)\n\nHotLung are a band from the seaside community of Santa Cruz, in Northern California, and In Spite of is their debut LP. The band calls themselves post-hardcore, but theyre more than a simple 90s genre tag. Their music is more melodic than such a simple category would imply, and has more varied textures. Theyve got the angular rhythms and crunchy aggressive instrumentals, to be sure, but the tracks are more tuneful than the prototypical post-hardcore bands like Quicksand or Refused. And the general tone has a wider dynamic range, too, from brutally hard to smooth and silky. There are elements of grunge in here, too, as well as pop punk and indie rock, making HotLungs sound somewhat unique. You can hear this right off the bat in the opening track, Never Home, which has a pop punk melody over some smooth yet aggressive instrumentals, and has a heavy powerful post-hardcore breakdown toward the end of the track. El Dorado has a rich, thick, bass-heavy tone right out of the grunge playbook, but also has a creamy indie melody, providing a tranquil contrast to the gritty instrumentals. 520 Taylor goes deeper into grunge territory with the dark heavy vibe, while Sweet Warm is a lovely indie ballad with growling grungy bass underneath a poppy melody. At the end of the LP, after the final song, Vines completes, theres a luscious hidden track, an experimental piece thats dreamy, chaotic, noisy, and provides a sense of confusion. Its a masterpiece to cap a nice debut.\n\nMARCEL WAVE  Something Looming (Feel It Records; marcel-wave.bandcamp.com)\n\nNo, this isnt a record about a 1920s hairstyling technique, its a UK that band play quirky pop music that mixes German minimalism (think Neu! and their repeated musical riffs) with the indie pop of Stereolab (think lithe French-style pop) and with a heavy dose of English post-punk tossed in. Guitar bass, drums, and a prominent synth mix with Maike Hale-Jones lead vocals that are equally sung and spoken. Bent out of Shape is a bubbly way to open the LP. The guitar and bass have a Devo-like angular refrain, as the song bounces between bright and dark. Barrow Boys uses deeply buzzy synths as the base for a rip on gentrification, speaking about city boys moving into a neighborhood thats undergoing rehab, pushing out the titular barrow boys  the working class folks who sell fruits and vegetables from a wheelbarrow for a living. Youve never heard a protest song this bouncy, though. I love the frantic sounds of Mudlarks, which uses buzzy synths and dramatically dissonant sounds and angular melodic lines. Its the most punk track of the album. Where There's Muck There's Brass has a great deadpan spoken word storytelling sound in the vocals with jumpy instrumentals behind, while Discount Center has the same vocals but bight bell-like synths. In Where Theres Muck Theres Brass, muck refers to a fucked up situation and brass refers to fat cat corporate executives. It tells the stories of redevelopment plans that go wrong, like plans to build a shopping mall in the center town, but after excavating a giant hole in the ground it never gets built. Or building cheap houses that end up collapsing and killing their inhabitants. Its an old story, rich people screwing everyone else and getting away with it. Idles of March is another raucous one thats a favorite, using a quicker pace, plenty of noise, and dissonance to great effect. The song is very simple, with a chorus shouting Beware the Ides of March, and I dont know the intent of the meaning of the song, but its a great one. Its also the shortest track at under a minute and a half, alas. Original and unique barely scratch the surface when trying to describe this band. Good stuff.\n\nTHE RATCHETS  \"Hurricane Condition\" EP (Pirates Press Records, piratespressrecords.com)\n\nThe Ratchets are back with the third installment in their series of standalone singles, each accompanied by a unique remix of the song. Each time has felt like a different band is recording the music, with one single sounding like New Age era Blitz and another sounding like swaggering street punk/Oi. This time out, The Ratchets give us an 80s new wave meets post-punk tune with subtle hints of funk beneath the song. While I loved the previous two singles instantly, this ones taking me a little longer to warm up to. The remix on this outing is provided by Strawberry Zaiquiri and is noted as the Washout Party remix (the name coming from lyrics in the songs chorus). Its got a nice chill vibe on top of a solid dance beat, taking the funky new wave guitar riff of the original and making it a prominent feature, adding synth flourishes and drum machine rhythms. Vocals take awhile to come in, and are lifted directly from the original recording but pulled back in the mix, sometimes adding vast amounts of reverb on the repeated line from the chorus, Gonna be a washout tonight. This is first of the three where I like the remix more than the original version.\n\nWALT DISCO  The Warping (Lucky Number, www.luckynumbermusic.com; waltdisco.bandcamp.com)\n\nThis is my first exposure to Walt Disco, and I am floored. This is, perhaps, one of the most unique albums Ive ever heard. It defies simple categorizations, but its certainly very theatrical. Listening to this album is like going to see a stage musical. You get beauty, you get tragedy, you get love, and you get heartbreak. Its everything you need in good story-telling music. The album opens with a short overture called Seed, a minute-long instrumental thats absolutely gorgeous, with full orchestral introduction: strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion playing a lovely fluttery melody. It rolls right into Gnomes, the first proper song. Jocelyn Sis lead vocals are ready-made for off-Broadway, and theyre joined by a full choir of backing singers. The song goes from introspective to bold and triumphant and back again in the space of three and a half minutes. Following this is the 80s new wave disco funk tune, Come Undone, about unexpectedly falling for a one-night stand. The title track brings in influences as disparate as ABBA, Duran Duran, and David Bowie, while You Make me Feel So Dumb is a breezy tune that speaks to the awkwardness of one-sided relationships and unrequited love. We get a lounge-like song of loneliness in Pearl, in which were told that its known ahead of time that a relationship wont work out and Im gonna end up living on my own. I think my favorite track of the album, though, is The Captain. Its just plain glorious. Its a huge epic number, starting out with the sound of a big folk tune, and, in defiance of expectations, it gets bigger and bigger, with trumpets joining in, giving the feel of a huge Broadway showstopper or finale. The actual finale, though, is Before the Walls, and its got an exotic tone to it, and its perhaps the most experimental track of the album. Its interesting, but sort of fizzles out at the end, rather than ending with a bang. Maybe thats because its what life really is like. The common theme that seems to run through these songs is the constancy of change in our lives, and the need to deal with those changes head on, wherever they lead us. Its certainly the most fascinating record Ive heard this year.\n\nBODY FARM / DRY SOCKET  Body//Socket Split LP (blindragerecords.com)\n\nTwo hardcore bands with somewhat different sounds share the stage on this new split LP. Body Farm are an East Coast band, split between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Columbus, Ohio, while Dry Socket are a West Coast group out of Portland, Oregon. Body Farm plays speedy, angry hardcore with song topics including trans and gay rights and the evils of Western capitalism. Their side of the LP opens with a clip of Tucker Carlson saying, Respect my pronouns or I will stab you. Thus starts Trans Day of Vengeance, a chaotic track with vocals that channel the late Poly Styrene, angrily shouting with a high pitch. The drums pound furiously, as do the guitar and bass, with little organization holding it together until the song slows down. It all coalesces into a tribal rhythm, with a throbbing bass and screeching guitar, punctuated by lyrics like We can burn it all down. This is righteously angry stuff. I Was Born Into Capitalism is a spoken word piece with guitar harmonics and a weary monolog about daily life in a country in which laws are constantly being passed against us and people we love, while were expected to face every day with a smile and subservience, and while fascism becomes more real every day. Daydreaming about the future we want is the only way to make it through. I love the angular riffs of Endless Psychosis, and the anarchic pandemonium of Fuck You Pay Me, the latter of which opens with a clip asking, Whats the most attractive language a man can speak? Money comes the reply. The song decries our societys obsession with material things and wealth at the expense of the well-being of all of us. Dry Sockets music is thicker, heavier and grungier, with more rhythmic shifts between slow loping sections that are almost metallic and breakneck, crunchy hardcore. One of my favorites of their tracks is Abomination, which starts out with a slow bounce in the drums, bass, and guitars, and vocals that are a high-pitched frightening growl. Then, suddenly, the song speeds up by like three or four times and all the instruments and vocals join in a frenzy for this bridge, before the slower tempo returns to finish things out. And Banking Hours is frantic for its first half, then slowing with a riff that reminds me of a Mission Impossible film with Tom Cruise as a headbanging spy. The tracks on this LP are short, as all good hardcore songs are. Not a one even reaches two minutes long, with most around a minute and many even shorter. The entire split is 17 bitter tracks in 21 anger-filled minutes. This is modern hardcore, kids.\n\nBIG LIFE  If You Like Bad Ideas, Its a Very Exciting Time (Setterwind Records, www.setterwindrecords.com)\n\nAstute readers of Jersey Beat will be aware of my love for all things Dischord Records and all things DC music. They will also be aware of my review of Big Lifes recorded debut last year, and how I likened it to the 1980s Dischord output of bands like Gray Matter, Dg Nasty, The Faith and more. Well, this Midwestern band which includes Ryan Allen, better known for his excellent power pop records under the name Extra Arms, returns with their sophomore offering, a six-song EP, and damn this stuff scratches my DC punk itch like few bands have done outside of that place and that time. This time out the band gets even harder and tougher, channeling the likes of Government Issue, Swiz, and Ignition. Especially on the a couple of the tracks, like Bias for Action and What Doesnt Kill You. These hit hard, with powerful lyrics and instrumentals, and vocals that are shouted as if theyre a vital message that has to be conveyed urgently. And so it is; Here for a Moment, for example, demands that we live for now, because Were only here for a moment and then were gone. Adds Up to Nothing is almost as edgy as the other tracks, but its a little more melodic, more like some of those Revolution Summer bands started doing, still with a hardcore sensibility mixed in. The only other band I can think of that comes this close to the 80s DC sound is Chicagos Wrong War. Wouldnt a tour with these two bands be perfect? I love this stuff.\n\nCOUCH POTATO MASSACRE  Died of Dysentery (Outloud! Records, outloudrecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nCouch Potato Massacre are a pop punk band from Minneapolis and they say that they sing songs about movies, TV shows, and video games. And that indeed, is what we get. Even the title and cover art are a reference to an old video game, The Oregon Trail, in which dying of dysentery was a very real possibility (just like in real life). Sound clips from the movies and TV shows are used liberally throughout this, the bands debut full-length LP (they previously released a pair of EPs). The music here isnt breaking any new ground, but the band play it proficiently and enthusiastically, which is was really counts. And its all tongue in cheek stuff, which makes it a lot of fun. The album opens with a song referencing the Nightmare on Elm Street movie franchise, called Never Sleep Again. After a clip from the film we get a bouncy song about using every stimulant readily available to stay awake and avoid a run-in with Freddy. Guitar, bass, drums, and keyboards join together in a frantic ruckus behind urgent vocals. We get songs about the movie Candyman: (The Hook Brings You Back), the TV sit-com That 70s Show (Down in the Basement), Teen Wolf (Michael J. Teen Wolf), Law and Order SVU (Benson and Stabler), and more. The audio clip that starts Benson and Stabler is particularly hilarious. And especially relevant lately (due to a recent film release) is Do, Re, Egon, the title coming from the Ghost Busters clip that opens the track. This track is harder and edgier rock and roll than most of the songs, with less pop and more down and dirty rocking out. Another song that differs from the rest is Ned Ryerson. Its a solemn acoustic tune with sad lyrics about being stuck in a rut (as in the movie, Groundhog Day). It opens with one of the best lines of the movie, in which Phil, played by Bill Murray, tells Ned, played by Stephen Tobolowsky, Ill give you a winter prediction. Its gonna be cold, its gonna be grey, and its gonna last you the rest of your life. Its an amazing poetic metaphor for the daily struggle through life, and this song conveys the depressing feelings of desperation. It may actually be my favorite track of the album. In one sense, Couch Potato Massacre remind me of Vista Blue, another pop punk band that do a lot of theme-based tongue-in-cheek tunes. CPM are less buzzy, though, and a little bouncier. CPM are certainly a lot of fun, especially for fans of pop culture.\n\nHOTBODS (Loud Circles Vinyl, www.loudcirclesvinyl.com)\n\nHotbods have been around awhile, but not very active. Thats changing now, with their debut LP. Featuring musical luminaries of the Sacramento, California area, Hotbods play a brand of music that mixes grunge, indie, and pop punk. The resulting ten songs on this LP are driving, gruff, yet quite melodic. Its a compelling sound. Right out of the gate, with Insects, you can hear the power, with vocals belted out with gritty determination, the drums pounding furiously, and the guitar and bass playing with a frenzy. Beneath this rough exterior are smooth silky backing vocals, making for quite a start contrast. Disorder has some Nirvana in its DNA, but its incredibly bouncy and reminds me somewhat of Awesome Fest style pop punk, making it an instant favorite. Another favorite is Bend and Bow, with the rhythmic and melodic feel of a Rocket from the Crypt song (minus the horns), The rasp of the vocals and instrumentals is again countered by those angelic backing vocals. Bread of Heaven is the lone ballad of the LP, and its a quiet affair with vocals and piano. Its recorded to sound old and scratchy, and its fine, but feels out of place. Nothing, which immediate follows, is the opposite; its loud and raucous, grunge-filled, melodic, and with some cool call-response vocals reminding me of NOMEANSNO. Hotbods demonstrate some very disparate influences, then blend them together into something new and gripping. Solid.\n\nLATE SLIP  I Love You (Party Mermaid Records, www.partymermaidrecords.com)\n\nLate Slip presents their debut recording, but is it an LP or an EP? It has eight tracks but lasts only 22 minutes. Who cares, lets talk about the music! If the songs sound somewhat familiar, thats intentional; Late Slip reach back in time for inspiration. Theres a vaguely retro rock and roll quality to the songs here, sometimes with hints of country twang, sometimes deeply in doo-wop territory, sometimes with a whisper of surf, always with a sense of fun. Late Slips lead vocalist Chelsea Nennis, vocals are crystal clear, very pretty, and have plenty of swagger. The opening track, Ill Be Okay, will bring up memories of sock hops with The Shangri-Las or The Ronnettes, and so will the title track, a song of heartbreak and sorrow. Tidal Wave has the feel of a surf tune of the 60s, but the Beach Boys were never like this! This tidal wave is gonna kn-n-n-n-n-nock you out with its sassiness and toughness. You aint even gonna see it coming, babe! Mind Your Business reaches even further back in time and mixes the sound of head bobbing 50s pop with even earlier honkytonk and Tin Pan Alley music. We get Love Me True, an old timey honkytonk tune that twangs with an oompah bass and the tinkling of piano. The record ends with a cover of Blondies hit, Heart of Glass, and its unlike any cover youve heard before. In place of the new wave meets disco intensity of the original we get a fun countrified version worthy of the Grand Ole Opry. You can almost hear Reba McEntire in those vocals. The thumpity thump of the drums, the simple twang of the bass, and the hillbilly guitars will get you up and stomping a two-step in no time. Late Slip? Better late than never! This is a hell of a fun record.\n\nMATT HUNTER & THE DUSTY FATES  Reindeer Soul (Dromedary Records, dromedary-records.com)\n\nThe Dusty Fates is a fairly new project, formed just before the pandemic. It was envisioned as a vehicle for Matt Hunter to begin making music again, and it features a rotating cast of other members, because, as Hunter says, I love the idea that a bands dynamic can constantly be in flux, based on whoevers around, who wants to play at a given time, and who might be best for a particular song. It means that your songs can be completely different every time theyre performed, and you have to be ready for that. I find that thrilling. This is Hunters first release under the Dusty Fates moniker, and features an interesting blend of the odd, the dreamy, and the indie. The opening track, for example, Sandcastle Row, is sparsely arranged, but sounds huge and epic, nonetheless. Theres big reverb and the gently jangling guitar gets louder and richer, become almost a clarion that demands our attention, particularly when the chords go incongruously minor and sinister. I really like this sort of sound, though Hunters hushed vocals are barely sung and sometimes veer off key. Morning Light, on the other hand, is a lovely light indie tune with a dusty sound. Acoustic and electric guitars mix, again in a minor key that shifts to major, the acoustic guitar taking the lead and a violin joining in to provide a hint of Americana. It gives the feeling of the darkness of night giving way to the joyful light of morning. In these tracks are various versions of indie rock, sometimes with quirky cool bits of songwriting. The arrangements are subtle and thin, but sometimes sound lusher than they have any right to be. Franz is a favorite for driving rhythm, alternating dark and bright vibes, and cool arrangement with fun backing vocals and synths. Night Cattle is another that sounds so much bigger than it is, with only guitar, bass, and vocals. The reverb provides a quite expansive sound, and the fiddle returns to interject some lines. The song is dreamy and gorgeous. Speaking of dreamy and gorgeous, the instrumental track, Weed Garden, is just that, and may be my favorite track of the album. Overall, the songwriting, arranging, and variety are spot on in this album. The one part I have a hard time with is those shaky lead vocals.\n\nSKYWAY  Never Disappear (www.skywaypunk.com)\n\nSkyway are a punk trio out of Buffalo, Mew York (although there are a number of Skyway bands around the world, so an internet search is made difficult). And though Never Disappear is only the bands second EP, they sound like seasoned veterans; the performances are tight and cohesive. This is a band that knows who they are. And thats a 90s style pop punk band that focuses on the songs, not on theatrics. There are five songs here, and theyre at once crunchy and poppy, aggressive and bouncy. The opening track is a good example of this, with a great pop melody accompanied by ferocious instrumentals. Lead vocals have the perfect sort of nerd-punk tone and are backed up on the chorus by harmonized whoa-ohs. Swear Jar is the bands nod to skate punk, with a speedier pace in the rhythm section and soaring vocals, the closest the band gets to stereotypical 90s pop punk. For that reason its my least favorite track here, though the band avoids the metallic vibe a lot of that genre is guilty of. The lyrics, though, are something we can all relate to: its an exhortation to be yourself and not let the haters win. The Longest Line has more of a loping pace, loads of bounce, and sentimental lyrics about the journey that is life. I especially like the traded lead vocals at one point in the song when the topic turns to the importance of the company we keep along this journey, and how the things we do and see together are what give meaning to the journey. The EP is rounded out by Misplaced and Rediscovered and Dont Want to Party. The latter is a particularly fun, combining powerful gruff instrumentals with a pop melody and lyrics about aging punks who want to stay home and going to sleep early instead of going out with younger friends. Plenty of us relate to that! Solid release.\n\nULTRABOMB  Dying to Smile (DC Jam Records, app.dcjamrecords.com)\n\nUltrabomb, for those not in the know, is a punk rock power trio, featuring Greg Norton (best known from Hüsker Dü), Finny McConnell (of The Mahones), and Jamie Oliver (from the mighty UK Subs). Theyve been together a while now, and Dying to Smile is their second full-length LP, their debut having come out last year. And Greg might get a little miffed by this, but to me, a lot of the songs sound similar to his more famous band. But thats a great thing, because Hüsker Dü is one of my all-time favorite bands. From the guitar tone to the rhythms to the sort of backing vocals used, and even in the chord progressions, this reminds me so much of that beloved band. McConnells lead vocals are grittier and scratchier than Bob Moulds, but the bulk of these songs are a little bit frantic, loaded with pop melody and treble-heavy guitar, and backing vocals singing ahhhhhs that follow the chords, just like many Hüsker songs. Doggo is one such track, and it opens the LP with a bang. Its a fairly simple song, but its glorious. Its Now, too, has the same great sound. I love Sleep Tight, too. Its got that frantic Hüsker sound, simple melody, broadly sung backing vocals, trebly guitar, and big lead vocals that are a bit pulled into the mix. Nortons simple bass line hearkens back to early hardcore days. West in the Summertime is another, and except for the lead vocals and guitar solo you would be excused if you thought you were listening to a lost Hüsker Dü track. My favorite track of the album, though, has to be the manic Rage Bomb. The guitar jangles furiously, while the rhythm section propels the song forward at a quick and deliberate pace. Now, dont get me wrong, there are songs different from the Hüskers, too. Never Better has more of a rock and roll jam feel, complete with guitar solo. And though Isolation has some of these elements, its a ballad with a completely different feel from the rest of the album. McConnells vocals are much more prominent in the mix and the guitars sound dreamy. Woke Wars has more of a garage rock feel. And Just Cut is a solid indie rock anthem. The whole album is certainly solid, and evokes more than just nostalgia. Excellent stuff here.\n\n45 ADAPTERS  Unstoppable (Pirates Press Records, piratespressrecords.com)\n\nNew Yorks 45 Adaptors proudly call themselves Oi & B, a melding of street punk and R&B, I guess I dont get that. I do hear street punk vibes pretty heavily, and bits of power pop and rockabilly. Sometimes I even hear Bad Religion influence. But R&B? Nah. As I commented in my review of their previous release, the 12 EP Now or Never, the band are a lot more melodic than most Oi bands, with more jangly guitars and less tough guy attitude. And now, after some fifteen years releasing EPs, singles, and splits, 45 Adapters are finally releasing their first full-length LP. The opening title track is, perhaps, the most punk and the most Oi, with the most attitude and the biggest gang vocals. And its fine, but the next track, Coming Up Empty, is miles better to my ears. Its a little smoother, a lot more melodic, but no less energetic. The guitars jangle more, the beat has a lot more bounce, and this one blends in loads more power pop than street punk. If youre a fan of Bad Religion, youre going to enjoy 86400. This song has a strong BR vibe mixed in with street punk gang vocals and a dark sound. And right after this is the bright poppy Save the Day, with a retro rock rhythm thats sure to get your head bobbing and your toe tapping. I love the jangle of Guilty by Participation, and especially the power pop meets garage rock sound of Colder. And Refuse to Die has a hint of Madness-style two tone to it, with song lyrics about skinhead culture, making it a fun one. Did I say fun one? Hell, its fun twelve for the number of tracks here! After a fifteen-year wait, this is one hell of a debut LP.\n\nBATS & MICE  PS: Seriously (Lovitt Records, www.lovitt.com)\n\nOriginally formed more than 20 years ago by three of the members of Sleepytime Trio, Bats & Mice last released music in 2010 after several line-up changes and before life took over and the band went into hiatus. Children were had and families raised, but now the band is back with a brand new full-length LP, only the second of their career. There are seemingly two very different bands on this LP  not literally, but stylistically. Some songs are loud, raucous, and very punk influenced. Others are quiet, relaxed, and subtle, very unpunk but very indie. For example, Out of Line, which opens the album, is smooth and a little dreamy, full of reverb and vocal harmonies. Buried Just Beyond, too, has a relaxed indie feel, with a lovely melody and nice jangles in the instrumentals, though the harmonized vocals sometimes get a little insistent and the guitar tone gets a little grittier partway through the track. But then there are loud raucous tracks like Space Race, the guitars screaming out, the drums and bass pounding away more insistently, though the vocals are still smoother and harmonized. Never Break Again is even more on the punk side of the scale, with not just furious instrumentals, but with angry shouted vocals. The melody is more straightforward, too, like a good punk song should be. Toward the end of the album, the two bands start to merge with songs the blend the two disparate styles together. Staring Straight has a sense of urgent alarm in its opening, and the song seems to try to bridge the two sounds on the album, with smooth vocals and a lush melodic line, but with loud buzzy guitars, bass, and drums. And Wash Our Bones Out has a dirtier guitar tone and insistent gang vocals shouting out, but the melody glides dreamily. The album took me on a wild ride between two extremes, and everything meets in the middle by the end. Welcome back, Bats & Mice. Its nice to listen to ya!\n\nBED MAKER (Dischord Records, dischord.com)\n\nBed Maker are a newer Dischord band and that immediately gets me excited. More than any single label, Ive been obsessed with the music coming out of the DC scene, and in particular with the bands on Dischord Records. Bed Maker features Amanda MacKaye (formerly of Desiderata and Routineers), along with veterans of multiple bands Jeff Barsky, Arthur Noll, and Vin Novara. The eleven tracks on this LP have a recognizable DC post-punk sound, but one unique aspect is that some of the instrumentals are a little bit jazzy, with a nice groove, sometimes heavy, sometimes breezy. MacKayes vocals, too, are instantly recognizable, with her way of emphatically both singing and speaking the lyrics at the same time. One of those heavier tracks is Two Left Feet, the opening track. The heaviness comes from the prominent bass and its veritable growl to match the growl of MacKayes vocals. The guitar lines in many of these tracks are minimalist, with short repeating phrases, sometimes shifting key, sometimes not. You can hear this featured in a track like Artful Dodger. I love how at one point of that song, the instrumentals are used in a chime-like way, with the bass quietly playing the four beats of a measure, then the guitars and drums loudly striking four in the next measure. Loops/Holes features arty angular minimalist lines in the bass and guitar and MacKayes emphatic spoken-singing vocals, making it a favorite. I love the jazzy drum lines in Candy Stripers Confession, even as the guitar, bass, and vocals are very post-punk minimalist. It gives the track a cool pulse. Sometimes the guitars go off script into some free-form noise, which gives the songs a nice tension. This is evident on Ballad of Tokitae, a lead single released before the LP. Tokitae may refer to a captive female orca that died of renal failure before she could be released back to the wild. But its the first track the band ever released as a single, two years ago, Miss Dickens, that really hits the sweet spot. It reveals Bed Maker and Amanda MacKaye to be our generations Beat poets, with crazy free-jazz music and stream of consciousness-like poetic lyrics. Some punks of the past have been experimenting with playing music with fewer constraints. Mike Watt is one, and Bed Maker is another. It makes for exciting listening.\n\nTHE COVIDS  Banned from the USA (Wap Shoo Wap Records, www.wapshoowaprecords.com)\n\nThe COVIDS were supposed to go on a US tour. I was planning to see their show at San Diegos Tower Bar. But there were visa problems for two of the members, and not only were they refused entry, they were banned from even trying again. The two members who were allowed in used the their time here to sulk, drink, and plot with Nestter Donuts, the Spanish-born one-man band and friend. They found themselves at LAs Savannah Studios, and wrote and recorded the blistering attack on mindless bureaucracy Banned from the USA. After returning home, they excitedly went back to the studio with the rest of the band and recorded the song again. The two tracks are presented now on a 7 single, the A-side containing the full-band version and the B-side having the Nestter Donuts version. The full-band version, of course, has better production quality and a fuller sound, but both are gritty driving garage rock and roll with an appropriate bluesy chord progression. The lyrics are simple, with cries of I wanna go to the USA, I wanna go to LA, and I want to do it. The B-side is thinner and tinnier sounding, and its also a little more relaxed. I think the bitterness of the experience comes through better in the full-band version, but both are excellent examples of the modern garage rock movement, from Amsterdams finest.\n\nDISTANTS (distants.bandcamp.com)\n\nAfter several years of kicking around and releasing a handful of EPs and singles, Distants are at long last releasing their debut full-length LP. The band was originally from Chicago, though over the years theyve slowly spread out among various Midwestern states. Nevertheless, their Chicago roots are still worn with pride, with a tough muscular guitar sound. That theyre scattered around the upper Midwest is noted in the title of the first track, Great Lakes Paving Company. Distants music is best described as broad, soaring pop punk. Their songs have distinct indie rock melodies, but rather than being rooted in simple bouncy power pop, these tracks are huge and emotionally charged. That first track is about getting tired of being stuck following the previously paved paths of others, the same old questions that lead to the same old answers. It celebrates those who still got a thirst for more and blaze their own path. Its an upbeat hopeful song in an album of songs that mostly deal with more depressing topics. For example, shit jobs are the topic on Jolly Good. Front man Alex Angus sings of staring at a blank white wall, dealing with a seven hour struggle. And on Grinding he sings of low-paying work, the existential dread of a month-long sleepwalk, and that the paychecks a middle finger. Isolation is the topic in Mirror Year, a gruff, gritty song with harmonized vocals that sings about losing yourself in loneliness. It asks if you barely speak over a long period of time, Will I remember how to sing? With the end of the song comes realization that its all self-imposed, and that its been a waste of time, Ive got forever to stay alive. I love Heuristic, especially the gorgeous bass on the opening of the song. When the guitars come in, theyre very insistent. And the closing track, Plateaued, seems to speak of aging and illness, and of trying to make the best we can in the face of oncoming oblivion. Throughout the record, the counterpoint of solid rhythm guitar and bobbing and weaving in the lead guitar are emblematic of a melodic emo style that originated in the Midwest in the late 80s and early 90s, a sort of mixing of west coast pop punk and east coast early emo. Its a style Ive loved for a long time, and hearing it on Distants LP makes me happy.\n\nMANTAROCHEN  In The Badgers Cave (Its Eleven Records, www.itseleven-records.de)\n\nMantarochen hails from Leipzig, in former East Germany. And after a series of digital single releases over the past year and a half, this mini-LP (six songs in sixteen minutes), this is their debut release. The name translates to manta ray, but dont fear their sting. Theyre a throwback to the 1980s, goth post-punk with a strong dance beat and a dark mysterious aura. The music is synth heavy, with a prominent rapid-fire bass complementing the simple drum (or is it a drum machine?), and the keyboards provide plenty of spaced-out ambience for the anguished yet dreamy vocals. The guitar is subtle, adding texture more than melody, and its tone is very trebly, such as was common in goth post-punk back in the day. Many of the songs tend to sound somewhat alike, with little variance in tempo or tone. One exception is Jaguar, which opens with a catty meow, and has a bit more aggressive of a garage-goth sound, the vocals being a little more emphatic, too. If youre into that dark nervous sounding German synth-punk from the 80s, check this out. Its a little too same-same for me, though.\n\nPOLKADOT - to be crushed (Count Your Lucky Stars Records, www.cylsrecords.com)\n\nPolkadot is a new band for Count Your Lucky Stars. The bands earlier releases have been digital EPs, and their debut full length was a cassette available from Lava Socks Records. Hailing from San Francisco, the band are proponents of the indie pop sound of the 90s, with lovely twee melodies and sincere lead vocals. The guitar and bass tones are loud and fuzzed out, providing a nice contrast to the crystal clear vocals. Theyve got wonderful dynamic range, with quiet touching moments that give way to explosive power and back again. But its not emo, its lovely indie pop. The opening track, Left Behind, starts out with just bass and lead vocals, and then harmonized backing vocals come in, and the result is absolutely beautiful. The full band doesnt come in until halfway through, the gorgeous bass tone joined by jangly guitars, piano, and lithe drums. The song finishes out as a pretty instrumental. The next track New Friends, couldnt be more different, with a loud wall of fuzzed guitar, bass, and drums against those sparkling lead vocals. The ferocity in the instrumentals is something to behold and unusual for indie pop, but it works magnificently. Some songs, like If Theres Nothing left to Say or Crushed, hew more toward the traditional indie pop sound, with pretty jangly guitars and charming vocals. These songs are perfectly fine and I enjoy them, but the songs that are a little different with those bigger contrasts and dynamics are the ones I really love. I especially love the dark closing track, This Year. It features dissonant guitars that provide palpable tension amidst the hazy melody and pained vocals. This is a solid sophomore LP that I heartily enjoy.\n\nRAD OWL  Rage Gracefully (Sell the Heart Records, www.selltheheartrecords.com / Engineer Records, www.engineerrecords.com)\n\nRad Owl have been around for several years, but the Minneapolis band is new to me. Apparently the band features former members of bands such as Samiam, Jon Snodgrass, Align, and more. Their music is strongly influenced by 90s west coast melodic punk, such as played by ALL, Big Drill Car, and the like. They would have fit in perfectly on the Cruz Records roster back in the day. The songs are speedy, eminently melodic, but with a nice aggressive edge. Close harmony is generously used throughout the songs, and the musicianship is top notch. Jeremy Jessens vocals are belted out with power and the instrumentals from the guitars (Jessen and Ryan Tate), bass (Jeremy Bergo) and drums (David Jarnstrom) are tight. One dangerous trap of 90s melodic punk too many modern bands fall into is getting too metallic with too many technical licks. Thankfully Rad Owl dont fall into that trap, and their songs are still raw, yet tuneful, energetic, and compelling. Right out the gate this album comes on strong and never lets up. Doppler is one of the strongest tracks, with very Descendents-like chord changes and the most awesome epic bridge. Checkers is played at a more leisurely pace than many of the tracks, but its a favorite for its relaxed feel and gorgeous melody and harmonies. Bergo gets to start the track with a cool solo bass line, and he does a bang-up job with a line that meanders around throughout the track. I love Bock Szn for its wonderfully angular chord changes and its hardcore power and urgency. I love the indie rock sound of Always Eyes, with the lyrics bouncing around between lead and backing vocals. Its cool hearing a more relaxed indie rock tune played with that buzzy trebly guitar tone and the ALL-like bass line. The closing track, Quiet While Youre Ahead, just sounds so bright and hopeful, too. The melody is poppy, the pace is quick, and the whole track just feels so optimistic. So many bands try to play 90s melodic punk these days, and end up sounding like a metal caricature. Rad Owl are the real deal and bring back so many fond memories. Aces!\n\nRAISED ON TV  Make Time to Make Time (Sell the Heart Records, www.selltheheartrecords.com)\n\nRaised on TV, hailing from Los Angeles San Fernando Valley, are not typical Sell the Heart Records fare. I said as much when I reviewed their previous LP, 2023s Strangers in Pictures. The band doesnt play the emotional sort of punk more familiar to label followers, instead playing breezy jangly indie rock. This time out the band drives more toward a power pop sound than a dream pop feel, perhaps due to the production. Theres less reverb and more focus on the jangle. It gives the nine songs an edgier feel, which I appreciate. Keaton Rogers vocals are a smooth and lush baritone, a welcome respite from gruff or screechy singing in many punk or punk-influenced bands these days. And though the band plays indie rock, theyre definitely punk-influenced. Listen to the noisy guitars on Without a Care for a good example. Back in the Sun is a perfect title for this next track, because its got a bright, pretty indie pop sound, the guitars jangling with a cleaner tone, and the melody is so bright and bouncy. Raised on TV change things up, too, with Road Dogs, a grittier, darker tune with more of a garage rock and roll sound. Theres more fuzz in the guitars, and you can almost smell the dust in the air from cruising down the back roads. And the track immediately following could not be more different; The Wonder of Things is soft and delicate, reminding me of French indie-pop. Take Me Home, which closes the LP, has the gorgeous sound of singer-songwriter fare, with a lovely somber storytelling feel. While I enjoyed and recommended their previous LP, I like Make Time to Make Time even more  so this gets another strong recommendation from me.\n\nDRUNK UNCLE  O, Brittle Weather (drunkuncleatx.bandcamp.com)\n\nWhen last I encountered Drunk Uncle, they were preparing to release their excellent debut full-length LP, Look Up, just about two years ago. In the interim since that LP, they isolated themselves in an East Texas cabin to work on this follow-up. O, Brittle Weather, and the resulting songs are lusher yet more subtle. The band displays plenty of 90s Midwest emo influence from bands like Braid, and Capn Jazz, featuring a huge dynamic range, mathy meandering guitar lines, and impassioned vocals. Some unique touches include keyboards on some songs, and sometimes adding trumpet into the mix. In particular, the song Thundercloud makes good use of keyboards and gang vocals to give the song a feeling of intensity. The song ends with some lovely guitar strums and the sounds of friends talking and laughing, lending a relaxed feel to it. And the trumpet makes a strong appearance on Cabin, the opening of which has a powerful jazzy vibe. I love how the two guitars wind around each other and I adore the gigantic dynamic shifts the track makes, from massive and fully charged to nearly silent and introspective. Knees (Buckling) is very pretty, making generous use of guitar harmonics and hushed simple guitar and bass lines that play against each other. Vocals are whispered as much as sung, with a sense of emotional pain coming through. The song builds and builds as it evolves, getting bigger, grinding harder. Before the song ends, we hear the sound of a Bugs Bunny cartoon in the background. Then everything goes quiet again as the track ends. Its one of my favorite tracks of the album. And the pair of tracks, Shell and Piano Song roll one into another, joined by a particular riff on the electric piano. The former has lovely delicate vocals and instrumentals, and the latter is a brighter indie song. The debut LP was recommended. This sophomore LP is even better.\n\nFVRMN  Back to the Whip (fevermoontokyo.bandcamp.com)\n\nFVRMN is the new moniker for a Tokyo-based band previously known as Fever Moon. I guess theyre allergic to vowels. But in any case, the bands lineup rotates through the nine tracks here and includes Chris Broach (of Braid fame) and Mike Watt (of The Minutemen, fIREHOSE, Mike Watt and the Missingmen, and more), as well as Motoharu Fukada (formerly of Soil), Christian Madden (of the Liam Gallagher Band), and many others. The band is fronted by Jay Holmes, who reportedly wrote the songs on this album after falling ill. His vocals are rough and scratchy, an interesting match for the instrumentals, which are lush and airy, but at the same time recorded with plenty of distortion. Its almost as if The Jesus and Mary Chain were playing songs with a stronger beat and more bounce. This unique sound makes the band a real standout, with poppy melodies and a melancholy essence. The title track, which opens the LP, is a great example of this. The melody and beat are bright, but the arrangement and production cast a pall over that. Raleigh will appeal to a lot of fans of pop punk, because its got the sound of one of those slower pop punk story-telling songs, but its also got the same thick distortion; you can hear the guitars shimmering beneath the static and it just sounds so cool. Into the Earth is a gritty doo-wop song, theatrical in its execution and arrangement, with plenty of interesting sound effects and instrumentation. Its quirkiness makes it a favorite and its sure to be a favorite among others. I adore Wig, which has the sound of something from the child of Dinosaur Jr. and Jesus and Mary Chain. The melody shines triumphantly while the fuzzy production softens and saddens it. Its a beautiful contrast. This album is so good and so different from anything else out there today. I strongly recommend it.\n\nGOLDENBOY  Qualmbum (peerecords.bandcamp.com)\n\nNow this is a truly international effort, released by five different labels in different markets around the world. Goldenboy is a pop punk band from Norway who have been around quite awhile  twenty-five years, in fact. Theyve teamed up with labels from Norway, the UK, the US, Canada, and Australia to release this, their fourth full-length LP. The album is an emotional rollercoaster, with many of the songs having been written in the wake of the death of singer Torkels newborn son due to fatal hospital mistakes. The opening track, My Name is Dad, is so very different from the rest of the LP, with acoustic guitar, piano, and strings. Its a song to his son, about all the things he had been looking forward to as a father, and how all he wanted was to be called dad. Its very melancholy and very moving. As a bookend, Qualm ends the track and also references the deep sadness of losing a child. Every other night I cry, the song begins, trying not to stay awake. But ultimately its a song of the slow, bumpy process of healing, as in the chorus we hear, Yes, there will be rainy days / And the sorrow fades away but also references wounds not healing and not being able to carry on. The music slowly builds throughout the track, representing the emergence from depression, and ends feeling quite triumphant. Beside sadness, another emotion that arises is anger, directed at those who caused the pain. Please Hold addresses this, and its an aggressive track, with a big wall of guitars and irate lyrics about the uncaring nature of those who hold peoples lives in their hands. The musicianship and songwriting on this LP are top notch, with songs having the perfect balance of melody and power, punk and pop, always sounding tight, but never sounding overproduced. There are a couple of other standout tracks to note. I love the use of the circle of fifths chord progression used in parts of Empty Handed. And Rain On My Parade is a solid song that gets better toward the end, as theres a big emotional swell of strings. And I love the bounciness of In That Bottle. The fact is, actually, that there isnt a bad track on this album, which I highly recommend.\n\nLAVA FANGS  Sub Auroram (lavafangs.bandcamp.com)\n\nYoull be forgiven if you arent familiar with Lava Fangs; theyre an Australian band that rarely plays live, let alone tours. But the members of the band are apparently veterans of the Melbourne music scene. That shows in the level of musicianship on display and in the quality songwriting. The band plays a mix of power pop, pop punk, and garage pop, with some songs leaning more heavily one way or another. The result is bouncy fun, especially when the band plays around with edgier fare in the punk and garage sides of the mix. Anticippointment is one such great track, with a quicker pace and Buzzcocks meets Ramones vibe. The song is poppy but powerful, bright musically, darker lyrically (the song about looking forward to being let down yet again). Some tracks are heavily Beatles influenced, such as the loping power pop tune, Photograph. Other tracks are more tongue in cheek, like the novelty tune Dancing for Satan, with its mock garage pop music with organ and surf guitar, and silly lyrics. Or 60s AM pop like Take Him Apart, with trumpets in the mix giving the song the feel of mixing in some Herb Alpert, with cool bass tone and a strong backbeat. Make Up Your Mind has a tougher garage sound, but tempered with plenty of power pop and a 60s Beatles-like melody. To continue demonstrating their disparate influences and styles, Want Me Need Me Love Me is more classic rock like, with both latter period Beatles and Rolling Stones influence and a bluesy rock and roll sound. This is one of those something for everybody sorts of records.\n\nMODERN SHAKES  A Bolt from the Blue (fondoflife.bandcamp.com)\n\nModern Shakes are a newer band, hailing from the UK and formed just seven years ago. A Bolt from the Blue is the bands debut full-length LP, and its filled with a particular brand of emotionally packed pop punk. Theres a lot of technicality, too, in the guitars, and in this aspect the band reminds me somewhat of San Diegos late lamented Caskitt, particularly their later material. Check out the guitar lines in Ask the Dust, as the two guitars trade off lead lines and weave around each other. Even as they do this, the songs are eminently melodic and tuneful, and the vocals are sung in a heartfelt baritone, clean and clear rather than gruff and gritty. They cant be described as bright; theyre not bouncy and happy sounding. But neither are they dark and gloomy. I guess that means theyre more modal? Definitely played with passion. Well, I take that back a little bit  Lucky Shoes is certainly a brighter song, both in melody and in words. It has lyrics about looking to the future: Tie your lucky shoes, it sings, Welcome to the future, one step at a time. Its a glorious time to be alive, I wish you well. Its not often you hear punk bands singing songs with optimistic outlooks, but the music and words here sound so hopeful. Overall, while Modern Shakes style does sound similar to what many other bands are doing, they play with proficiency and with passion, making them stand out from the crowd. Solid debut.\n\nVARIOUS  Acoustic Revolt Dreadnought: Live Sessions Vol. 1 (acousticrevolt.bandcamp.com)\n\nAcoustic Revolt has been a long-running series of shows in San Diego, put on by Kevin White, himself an acoustic performer. The shows have occurred in various clubs around town, but most frequently can be found on a Friday night every month or two at Rosie OGradys in the citys Normal Heights neighborhood. Its often hard for touring solo acoustic performers to find shows, but White has provided an opportunity for them, and a chance for locals to see these acts where they might not otherwise. And these showcases also provide a space for local musicians, often who play in bands, to play some songs that might not fit with their group, as a solo performer. Whites developed quite a reputation supporting acoustic performers, and decided it was time to put out a compilation of some of the acts hes worked with. One really nice thing about this comp is how it was recorded. These are all studio sessions, but recorded live, with songs being done in one take with minimal editing to preserve the integrity of the performance. These are all just as you would hear them at Rosies. And for this first volume, White called on a number of locals and a few out-of-towners who were coming through to provide tracks. Some people dont get acoustic, because its not punk enough or because theyre expected to pay attention instead of chatting (shouting) with their friends over the loud music at a typical show. But to me, acoustic shows are awesome. Stripping away all the other instruments allows me to hear the lyrics and to hear the musician, the person, what theyre trying to tell us, and what emotions theyre trying to convey. Acoustic performances can be more passionate and intense than a full band show. And you can hear that in this comp. San Diego local Jonny Wagon opens the comp with a pair of tracks, Take Me Home and Ride, that have plenty of twang revealing his Tennessee roots. The former is a down home lament about moving away and drifting from those roots and longing for the comforts of family and familiar surroundings. The latter is a quieter and more delicate song of searching that gets more and more passionate as it evolves. San Diegos Johnny Giles offers a pair of songs, as well, Lottery and Moral Treatment. Coming from the DIY punk world, Giles songs are a little more frantic and his vocals are appropriately gravelly. I am always astounded when I listen to the solo songs of Cameron Flynn, who goes by the moniker Plants. Hes another San Diego local, and the first of his two songs is gorgeous. Counting Days has a softer indie sound, and his vocal dynamic range is fantastic, the anguish palpable. And in particular, on his second track, Better Man, you can hear the frustration with trying to be the person others expect him to be, both in his playing and his singing. Next up is a pair of tracks from LAs Bradley Riot. His songs are among the most raucous of the comp, with Like a Fire speaking to loneliness and isolation.
