        "text": "Paul Mason, of Stonecross Road, told Brooke Kinsella that he had bought her a wedding dress, and penned fantasy love letters over the course of two years.\n\nHe even visited the grave of the star’s murdered brother, Bromley Magistrates Court heard.\n\nOn Monday Mason, 40, was jailed for 26 weeks.\n\nHe was also given an indefinite restraining order, banning him from contacting the actress, who played Kelly Taylor in the BBC1 soap.\n\nMiss Kinsella described Mason’s behaviour as “odd” and “scary”.\n\nShe told magistrates he said he had bought her wedding dress for their marriage and vowed to show up at the acting school for children she runs.\n\nMason claimed that as a victim of knife crime, he was simply trying to support the actresses in her work with the Ben Kinsella Trust, dedicated to her 16-year-old brother, who was stabbed to death in 2008.\n\nFor the full story, see this week’s Welwyn Hatfield Times, on sale now"
