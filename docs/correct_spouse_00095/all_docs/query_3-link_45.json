        "text": "Ben was stolen from us, 15 years ago today. \"I was lucky enough that my brother was one of my best friends. I could never put into words what Ben meant to us as a family and what was taken from us that night. He was only here for a short while but he was so very special to us and I am grateful for every day that I got to spend with him. It’s unbelievable to me that I haven’t seen my little brother for 15 years, as it sometimes feels like just yesterday I heard him laugh or make a cheeky comment. We will love and remember Ben forever and I am so proud of the legacy he has left behind. 15 years on I am still so heartbroken at the violent and unnecessary loss of such a beautiful boy and the ripple effect it had on so many. My family, Ben’s friends, the wife he might have loved, the children he might have had. I am more heartbroken still that we haven’t succeeded in making this world a safer place, a place where sixteen year old boys can make it home to their beds. It can be hard to keep going but I made a promise to my brother all those years ago and I will do all I can to keep it. We will never give up in the fight against knife crime.” - Brooke Kinsella MBE Help us to stop knife crime. Donate at benkinsella.org.uk/donate or text BEN to 70450 to donate £5. #ItsBeen15"
