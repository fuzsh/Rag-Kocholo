        "text": "FORMER EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella got married today in a romantic Christmas ceremony.\n\nThe actress and anti-knife campaigner tied the knot with her fiance Simon after becoming engaged in July.\n\nHer manager shared a lovely picture of Brooke on social media, posing with her loved ones in a beautiful white lace gown.\n\nHowever her big day was touched with sadness as Brooke took a moment to remember her half-brother Ben Kinsella, who was stabbed to death in 2008.\n\nSharing a picture on her Instagram page of the sunny sky above her wedding venue, she wrote: \"There was never any doubt my little angel would bring the sun out for me today.\"\n\nBrooke's followers were quick to congratulate her, with one writing: \"Have an amazing day.Your brother looking down with so much pride.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Brooke enjoy your special day as your brother Ben would having so proud of his older sister walking down the aisle.\n\n\"Ben is sending his love with sunshine.\"\n\nA third agreed, writing: \"perfect ...how lovely ...enjoy your day , and know he is with you...congratulations to you both.\"\n\nLater in the day, close family friend and Loose Women star Linda Robson shared videos on her Instagram page of Brooke's wedding.\n\nThe first saw the star walking down the aisle in her gown, beaming as she headed towards her future husband.\n\nThe second then saw the happy couple having their first dance as man and wife, with Simon picking Brooke up and twirling her round at one point before they held each other close.\n\nBrooke has shared regular updates in the run up to her wedding, posting a picture of her wedding rings next to her Christmas tree last week.\n\nShe wrote: \"One week to go...\" before revealing the efforts her family were putting in to get the nuptials ready around the busy festive period.\n\nWhen one asked how she had managed it, Brooke replied: \"Well, I actually have a mumma whoâ€™s a godsend. Her house is like Blue Peter at the moment. We are making our own gin and everything... #DIYWeddings.\"\n\nBrooke - who played Kelly Taylor in the BBC 1 soap - was left devastated in June 2008 when her half-brother Ben was murdered at the age of just 16.\n\nFollowing his death, she campaigned to prevent knife crime, and her efforts saw her receive an MBE from the Queen in 2011.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220."
