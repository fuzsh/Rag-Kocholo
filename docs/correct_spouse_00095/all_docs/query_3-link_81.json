        "text": "Former EastEnders star Brooke Kinsella has announced the birth of her baby boy. The actress, who played Kelly Taylor in the long-running BBC soap, welcomed her second child with husband Simon Boardley today (Wednesday, June 29).\n\nShe announced the happy news on Instagram and revealed they had chosen a very poignant name for their new arrival, who was born on the same day Sophie's brother Ben was stabbed to death. Ben Kinsella was 16-years-old when he was attacked by a gang of three youths on a London street.\n\nHe died in hospital a few hours later. Brooke and her family have dedicated time since to educate youngsters on the dangers of knife crime, launching the Ben Kinseall Trust anti knife crime charity.\n\nRead morePeaky Blinders and Hollyoaks stars expecting baby together\n\nBrooke shared a sweet black and white photo of her little bundle of joy fast asleep. She wrote alongside the snap: \"Ben Ross Boardley 29/06/22.\n\n\"A perfect miracle given to us on a day when so much was taken away. Named after the very best of men. He will do them so proud, I know it already.\"\n\nThe 38-year-old actress and her husband of five years already share one-year-old daughter Elsie.\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nEastEnders star to be killed off with brain tumour inspired by Tom Parker\n\nCoronation Street star buys first home aged 20\n\nBBC EastEnders legend returning to soap after years away\n\nJacqueline Jossa praised for swimwear snap as she strips off"
