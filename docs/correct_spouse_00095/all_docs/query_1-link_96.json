        "text": "Canada’s earliest diplomatic relations were all conducted through the British imperial diplomatic system. Canada opened an office of the Department of Immigration in Hong Kong in 1923, coinciding with the passage of Canada’s Chinese Immigration Act, severely limiting the number of Chinese persons who could immigrate to Canada. As one of the few classes of Chinese people exempt from exclusion were merchants, trade between China and Canada continued apace, and a Trade Commission office was opened in Kong Kong in 1927.\n\nFollowing the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in July 1941, Canada suspended friendly relations with Japan, and began to seek closer relations with China as an ally in case of war. Canada got in contact with the Nationalist Chinese government under Gen. Chiang Kai-shek, and an exchange of diplomatic missions was agreed to August 1941. The establishment of these missions suffered delay: the Chinese envoy, Dr. Liu Shih-Shun, arrived in Ottawa in February 1942, and the Canadian envoy, Maj.-Gen. Victor Odlum, was appointed that November, but it was not until April 1943 that Odlum arrived in China opening the Canadian mission at the Chinese temporary wartime capital at Chongqing (Chungking). In November 1943, Canada and China agreed to elevate each other’s envoys to the rank of Ambassadors; Dr. Liu presented his credentials to the Governor-General of Canada in February 1944, and Maj.-Gen. Odlum did the same to Gen. Chiang in March. Once the war was over, the embassy moved to the permanent Nationalist capital of Nanjing (Nanking) in 1946. The Chinese Immigration Act was then repealed in 1947.\n\nCommunist troops took control of Nanjing in April of 1949. The Canadian ambassador was replaced by a chargé d’affaires that July, but Canada recognized the Communist government of the People’s Republic of China. Negotiations to re-establish representation at the level of Ambassador were cut off by the outbreak of the Korean War, however, and the Canadian Embassy in Nanjing was closed in February 1951. Canada continued to recognize the Nationalist government of the Republic of China, but did not send diplomatic representation to its new capital at Taipei; instead, all relations were maintained through the ROC’s embassy in Ottawa, at 301 Wurtemburg St. (The addresses of Wurtemburg St. have since been reassigned; the site is now a private home at #223.)\n\nCanada recognized the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China in October 1970, and, after the appointment of a new Canadian Ambassador in April, a Canadian Embassy was opened in Beijing in June 1971, at 19 Dongzhimenwai Dajie, Chaoyang District, Beijing. The new Chinese embassy was opened in Ottawa in 1972 at 515 St. Patrick St., in a former convent of the Sisters of Good Shepherd. Canada also maintains consulates at Chongqing, Guangzhou (Canton), Shanghai and Hong Kong. There is also the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei, which is Canada’s de facto embassy in Taiwan; it was originally opened by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in 1986, but its operation was taken over by the Canadian government in 1991.\n\nThe Trade Commissioner at Hong Kong was also assigned the office of Consul-General to Macao in 1980; after the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the trade commission there was upgraded to a consulate, but the Consul-General to Kong Kong and Macao, owing to the special administrative status of those two cities in China, reports directly to the Department of Global Affairs in Ottawa, rather than to the Ambassador to China.\n\nThe Canadian Ambassador to China has also been concurrently the Ambassador to Vietnam from 1973 to 1979, the Ambasador to Mongolia from 1992 to 2008, and the Ambassador to North Korea from 2001 to 2005.\n\nCanada’s representatives to China have been:\n\nMaj.-Gen. Victor Wentworth Odlum CB CMG DSO (1880-1971), 1942-1946. Born in Coburg, Ont., Odlum’s father, the historian Edward Odlum, moved the family to Japan for four years when Victor was a child, returning to Canada in 1890 and settling in Vancouver. Odlum served in the Boer War with the Royal Canadian Regiment and, on his return, found a job as a reporter with the Vancouver Daily World, working his way up to editor-in-chief of the newspaper by the age of 25. He signed up for the Army at the outbreak of World War I and commissioned as a major, seeing action at the Second Battle of Ypres, and becoming known in the trenches as “Pea-Soup Odlum” for his teetotaling. The commanding general of the Canadian Forces, Sir Arthur Currie, took a shining to Odlum, especially as Odlum loaned Currie a large sum of money to cover some cash he “borrowed” from regimental funds before the war, thus avoiding a court-martial for embezzlement. By the end of the war, Odlum was a brigadier-general. He retired to private life in Vancouver, starting up an investment firm (Odlum Brown, which still operates to this day) and serving in the provincial legislature as a Liberal from 1924 to 1928. He also bought the Vancouver Daily Star and used it as a mouthpiece for his reactionary pro-temperance, anti-Bolshevik opinions, as well as using yellow journalism to stir up anti-Chinese sentiments in 1924 by baselessly insinuating a Chinese houseboy had murdered a Scottish housemaid in the household of a well-to-do family. Odlum shut down the Star in 1932 after the employees unionized and refused to accept a pay cut. Odlum then sat on the Board of Governors of the CBC from its founding in 1936 to the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Upon the start of the war, Odlum was commissioned as a major-general and placed in command of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, where he proceeded to waste time doing things like designing badges and organizing marching bands instead of arranging to train his soldiers in modern warfare tactics. Eventually Odlum was shuffled out of active military command and made High Commissioner to Australia in 1941, then Envoy to China from 1942 to 1946, upgraded in title to Ambassador to China in 1944. He then served as Canada’s first Ambassador to Turkey from 1947 to 1952. He retired to Vancouver, donating his personal library of over 100,000 volumes to the University of British Columbia in 1963.\n\nGeorge Sutton Patterson (acting) (Chargé d’affaires a.i.) 4-24 October 1946\n\nThe Hon. Thomas Clayton Davis (1889-1960), 1946-1949. Davis was born in Prince Albert, Sask., and studied at Osgoode Hall Law School. He was mayor of Prince Albert from 1921 to 1924 and a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from 1925 to 1939, in which position he convinced the federal government to found Prince Albert National Park. He was appointed to serve as a judge of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal from 1939 to 1948, although he did not actually serve on the bench from 1940 to 1948, as he was serving as the federal Deputy Minister of War Services from 1940 to 1943, then as High Commissioner to Australia from 1943 to 1946 before becoming Ambassador to China from 1946 to 1949. He was thereafter Ambassador to West Germany from 1949 to 1954 and Ambassador to Japan from 1954 to 1957; he then retired to Victoria.\n\nChester Alvin Ronning CC AOE (1894-1984), 1949-1951. Chester Ronning was born to Norwegian-American Lutheran missionaries in China in the city of Fancheng, in Hubei province (since absorbed into the neighbouring city of Xiangyang [Siangyang]). Ronning moved to Canada when his father, Halvor Ronning, became involved in the establishment of an all-Norwegian settlement in northwestern Alberta, Valhalla Centre. Ronning studied at the University of Alberta and returned to China as a missionary from 1922 to 1927, returning to Alberta to become Principal of Camrose Lutheran College. Ronning also served in the legislature of Alberta from 1932 to 1935 as a member of the United Farmers of Alberta, then became leader of the Co-Operative Commonwealth Federation of Alberta in 1940. In 1942, Ronning left his positions with the College and the CCF to serve in the decryption unit of the RCAF Intelligence DIvision, then was asked to join the staff of the Canadian embassy in Chongqing in 1945. Ronning took control of the Canadian embassy at Nanjing as a chargé d’affaires from Davis’s departure in 1949 until the embassy’s closure in 1951. He then served as Ambassador to Norway from 1954 to 1957 and High Commissioner to India from 1957 to 1964. Ronning officially retired from the diplomatic service in 1965, but in 1966 he was chosen to lead Operation Smallbridge, a special mission to Hanoi by the Canadian government to bring the US and North Vietnam to the negotiating table to end the Vietnam War, which was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n(No representative 1951-1971)\n\nJohn MacLeod Fraser (acting) (Chargé d’affaires a.i.)

He served as Ambassador to South Africa from 1964 to 1965, then headed negotiations with Beijing for Canada’s recognition of the Communist government before being appointed by Pierre Trudeau as Canada’s first ambassador to the People’s Republic of China, serving only about a year before a serious problem with his circulatory system forced him into an early retirement.\n\nCharles John Small (1919-2006), 1972-1976.
