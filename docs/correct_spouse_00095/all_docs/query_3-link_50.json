        "text": "As we know from the troubling statistics on this issue, theirs are far from the only families who now have an empty place at the dinner table because of the rise in knife crime over recent years. This is not for lack of trying.\n\nThose of us involved in the Ben Kinsella Trust, set up shortly after his death in 2008, have been working tirelessly to keep others from having to repeat our experience and the charity has had many successes.\n\nIn September 2008 we took a leading part in The People’s March where hundreds turning out to demand changes to knife crime laws. In March 2010 we had a major breakthrough when then justice secretary Jack Straw announced the introduction of “Ben’s Law,” raising the mandatory minimum sentence for a knife murder from 15 years to 25 years.\n\nFor a while, efforts to tackle knife crime seemed to be working, and until 2014 figures showed that it appeared to be falling. Since then it has been a very different story culminating last month in the release of statistics that showed the highest number of fatal stabbings on record.\n\nThe fact is that politicians got distracted. When knife crime started falling they convinced themselves that Britain had become a less violent society and their focus shifted.\n\nMinisters stopped looking for new ways to drive the numbers even lower and began to cut back or replace some of the schemes and initiatives that had helped to bring them down in the first place.\n\nCuts to youth services took frontline workers out of circulation and led to the closure of youth clubs - even though those workers were often a major role model for young people with turbulent home lives and the closure of clubs has been a boon for gang recruitment. Meanwhile, the police moved on to other priorities.\n\nThere’s no quick fix to reverse this trend. Properly resourced policing and appropriate sentences for offenders have a role to play. Stop and search, for example, is a useful tactic for containing or diverting knife crime.\n\nHowever, it is short-sighted to think the justice system alone is capable of solving this crisis. We also need long-term investment in a range of measures that tackle underlying issues of inequality, deprivation and childhood trauma as well as focusing on education and prevention work.\n\nFor this to work and end the cycle of knife violence, we need a commitment from politicians that lasts beyond the duration of the current crisis. Otherwise in another ten years we’ll just be back here again, laying more flowers, lamenting the loss of another promising young life, and wondering how and why we ever let it come to this."
