        "text": "Congratulations are in order for Brooke Kinsella who has given birth to her second child.\n\nThe former EastEnders star, 38, took to Instagram to reveal that she’d welcomed a baby boy on the 14th anniversary of her brother Ben's tragic death.\n\nThe actress, who revealed her second pregnancy with husband Simon Boardley back in March, took to Instagram to announce the news.\n\n“Ben Ross Boardley. A perfect miracle given to us on a day when so much was taken away,” she wrote as she posted an adorable snap of the little tot.\n\n“Named after the very best of men. He will do them so proud, I know it already.”\n\nAs the family-of-three becomes a family-of-four, little Ben will join older sister Elsie, one, at their doting parents’ stunning home.\n\nSo, let’s take a peek inside the property…\n\nBrooke previously shared a glimpse inside her and Simon's abode while pregnant with Elsie in 2020.\n\nIn the snap of the nursery Brooke showed that she had gone for a neutral grey and beige colour scheme, with clouds carefully painted on the walls with smiling faces.\n\nThe former soap star kept things simple with a white crib, as well as a cute little cloud light hanging above, and beige blinds at the window.\n\nAlso in the picture was a hospital bag ready for when she gave birth: \"Little one’s bag all packed ready for the ultimate adventure. Thank you for the beautiful gift @pacapod #FinalCountdown #36weeks\".\n\nBrooke, who married her husband in a winter wonderland wedding at a Surrey country estate in 2017, has also given fans a glimpse inside her stunning living and dining room.\n\nThe space is filled with adorable family pictures, and features an enormous white and brown dining table surrounded by white chairs.\n\nA grand piano is located in one corner beside a large houseplant, while a quirky piece of art hangs on another wall.\n\nBrooke shared only three more snaps of her growing bump during her first pregnancy, with one giving a glimpse into her bedroom.\n\nStanding in profile in the black and white picture, Brooke cradled her baby bump, taking a selfie while looking away from the camera.\n\nIn it her dresser was in the foreground, which was stocked full of toiletries and make-up including Jo Malone perfume bottles.\n\nIn another snap from her bedroom back in August, Brooke posed in a sports bra with her growing bump on show: \"Not quite sure where the rest of it is going to go... #32Weeks #WeebleWobble\".\n\nIn the background of the photo taken in the gold framed full-length mirror, Brooke's bed could be seen, featuring a grey velvet headboard which matched the plush grey carpet.\n\nAnother snap from her pregnancy with Ben showed off the same room and its lavish gold mirror and decor.\n\nDressed in a stunning black ball gown, she wrote: “6 inch heels whilst 7 months pregnant? Wasn’t my very cleverest idea…”.\n\nBrooke was appointed an MBE in The Queen's 2011 Birthday Honours for services to the prevention of knife crime.\n\nThe actress returned to EastEnders in 2018 to collaborate with writers to form their harrowing knife crime storyline, which saw character Shakil Kazemi killed.\n\nShe made a cameo appearance as herself in the episode of Shakil's funeral, which saw the families of real life victims pay tribute as they stood outside the service holding photos of their lost loved ones.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
