        "text": "British actress\n\nBrooke Kinsella (born 17 July 1983) is a British actress. A graduate of the Anna Scher Theatre School, Kinsella has been acting since childhood. She has had various roles on television and in film. Her most notable role is that of Kelly Taylor, who featured in BBC's long-running soap opera, EastEnders, between 2001 and 2004. She has her own drama school called True Stars Academy.\n\nKinsella's family made headlines in the British press in 2008 following the murder of her half-brother, Ben, who was stabbed to death in June 2008.[3] After his death, hundreds of people protested along with Kinsella over knife fatalities in London.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nKinsella attended the Maria Fidelis RC Convent School in Camden. Prompted by her mother, who wanted to encourage her to take up a hobby she enjoyed, Kinsella attended the Anna Scher Theatre School at the age of 6, and stayed there until she was 16.[citation needed]\n\nShe made her television debut at the age of 7 in the BBC children's series Mud and has appeared in a variety of other TV productions, including Coming Home. As well as appearing in an episode of the BBC series Sunburn in 2000, she has also appeared in the entirely unrelated music video \"Sunburn\" by British rock band, Muse.\n\nFilm credits include the Channel 4 film Kid In The Corner (1999), about a child with ADHD, and the controversial ITV film No Child of Mine (1997), in which she played a young girl subjected to systematic sexual abuse.\n\nIn 2002, Kinsella appeared as Liz Chambers in ITV1's cop show The Bill, playing a teenage runaway. Her character is later the first victim of the original Sun Hill Serial Killer.\n\nHer stage credits include School Play at Soho Theatre (2001) and a rehearsed reading of Skyvers by Barry Reckord at the Royal Court Theatre in 2006.\n\nBefore securing the role of Kelly Taylor in EastEnders, Kinsella had auditioned for the parts of Zoe Slater, Janine Butcher and Sonia Jackson, but was unsuccessful. Kinsella completed the first year of a degree in English, Media and Drama at Buckinghamshire New University before joining the cast of EastEnders. She joined the show for a brief stint in 2001, before returning as a full-time cast member from 2002 to 2004. During her time on the soap opera, Brooke's character weathered prostitution, relationship break-ups and confusion over her sexual identity prompted by a lesbian kiss with Michelle Ryan's character, Zoe Slater. The kiss was criticised in the British media as cheap sensationalism and branded as a ratings-stunt.[4] Louise Berridge, the one-time executive producer of EastEnders, made the decision to axe Kinsella's character in 2004 to allow further character development of her on-screen best friend, Zoe Slater; however, Kinsella maintains it was a mutual decision between herself and Berridge. In March 2008, Brooke said in an interview with Woman magazine that she would love to return to EastEnders at some point. In 2018, she helped the writers of EastEnders with a stabbing storyline involving the characters, Shakil Kazemi and Keegan Taylor.\n\nKinsella and her real-life partner Ray Panthaki (who played Ronny Ferreira in EastEnders) played a heroin-taking couple in director Andrew Jones's film The Feral Generation, which was shot during the period of December 2006 and January 2007 and premiered at the 2007 Portobello Film Festival.[5] Her debut novel, Friendship Is A Funny Thing is awaiting publication. She was made an MBE for her work on knife crime in the Queen's Birthday Honours 2011.[6]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nKinsella's father left the family when she was four years old and she was subsequently raised by her mother Debbie and stepfather George, who Kinsella has described as her \"real dad\".[7] She lives in Islington, north London and is the eldest of five children; she has two sisters, a half-sister and had a half-brother.\n\nKinsella married her long-term partner Simon Boardley on 28 December 2017.[8] On 22 September 2020, Kinsella gave birth to their first child, a daughter.[9] On 29 June 2022, Kinsella gave birth to their second child, a boy.[10]\n\nMurder of brother\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Murder of Ben Kinsella\n\nOn 29 June 2008 at 02:00 BST, Kinsella's 16-year-old brother, Ben Kinsella was stabbed to death by a gang of three youths in a London street.[11] Ben, the seventeenth teenager killed in London in 2008, died in hospital a few hours later. Kinsella said she was \"devastated\".\n\nFollowing his death, Kinsella and her family led hundreds of people in a march to protest against London's knife and gun crime. On 3 July 2008, three people were charged with Ben's murder, for which they were later tried and convicted.[12] The Kinsella family launched the Ben Kinsella Trust in Ben's memory, in a bid to end knife crime.[13][14] In the run up to the 2010 general election, Kinsella announced her support for the Conservative Party and revealed she would head a panel deciding how grants were distributed to voluntary groups tackling youth crime.[15]\n\nOn 23 and 25 February 2011, an anti-knife campaign, funded by the Kinsella trust was run in Birmingham's New Street Station, in conjunction with the British Transport Police and Great Barr School's drama department from its Sixth Form centre. A play was performed to the public throughout each of these days in the station's concourse, to raise awareness of the effects of knife crime.[16]\n\nKinsella was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to the prevention of knife crime.[17]\n\nIn December 2018, Kinsella appeared in an episode of the BBC One series Defenders UK to talk about the murder of her brother, Ben.[18]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 2011 London Town Kate 2007 The Feral Generation Nikki 2001 Just Like My Dad Unknown Role 1998 Candy Sandra\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear TV Show Role Notes 2011 Law & Order: UK Tina Episode: Tick Tock Holby City Emma Kerrigan Episode: Too Much Monkey Business 2009–2011 Loose Women Herself 2 episodes 2010 Missing Leanne Hallam Series 2, Episode 1 2009 The Wright Stuff Herself - Guest Panelist 1 episode My Brother Ben: Brooke Kinsella's Story Herself - Narrator 2006 Vital Signs Mandy Series 1, Episodes 1, 2 and 5 2005 Jericho Dawn Masters Episode: A Pair of Ragged Claws Rose and Maloney Lola Shore Series 2, Episode 1 EastEnders Revealed The Growing Pains of Zoe Slater Herself 2001–2004 EastEnders Kelly Taylor Series Regular 2004 Big Brother's Big Mouth Herself - Guest Panelist Series 1, Episode 18 Big Brother's Little Brother Herself Series 4, Episode 10 This Morning Herself 1 episode 2003 EastEnders: Christmas Party Herself 2002 The Bill Liz Chambers Episodes 023 and 024 NCS: Manhunt Pauline Kowatowski Series 1, Episode 1 2001 The Vice Inez Episode: Into the Night 2000 Killers Unknown Role Sunburn Sally Prince Series 2, Episode 6 1999 Kid in the Corner Lucy Letts unknown episodes Hope and Glory Marina Series 1, Episodes 1, 3 and 4 1998 Maisie Raine Sarah Episode: Happy Families Coming Home Jess 1997 Original Sin Daisy Reed 3 episodes : Series 1, Episodes 1, 2 and 3 No Child of Mine Kerry 1996 Jack and Jeremy's Real Lives Unknown Role Episode: Consumer Watchdogs No Bananas Janet Episodes: Escape, Sitzkreig and Christmas 1994–1995 Mud Ruby Series 1, Episodes 1-6\n\nSeries 2 Episode 2\n\n2018 Defenders UK Herself Series 1, Episode 15\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
