I wish you all the best for today and a future filled with love and happiness because you certainly deserve it\"\n\nLast week, Brooke shared a snap of hers and Simon's rings nestled in their Christmas tree alongside ornaments in the shape of their initials.\n\n\"One week to go,\" she wrote, clearly excited to marry her partner.\n\nBrooke, who played Kelly Taylor in the BBC soap, was devastated when her brother was murdered in June 2008, when he was just 16.\n\nSince his death, she's campaigned tirelessly to prevent knife crime. She was awarded an MBE from the Queen in 2011."
