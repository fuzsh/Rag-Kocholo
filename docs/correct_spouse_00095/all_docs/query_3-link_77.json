        "text": "EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella has revealed that she believes she received a message from her brother, Ben, who was murdered in 2008.\n\nThe actress, who played character Kelly Taylor for three years, has shared the emotional story of how she found out she expecting, sharing that she believes her pregnancy test carried a special message from Ben.\n\nSpeaking on Loose Women, Brooke shared her shock at reading the name 'Ben' written on her test, which soon turned out to be positive.\n\nShe says \"I've done a few tests over the years. But on this one, as soon as I opened it on the packaging I saw BEN. It seemed so silly because I'm sure the company will tell me there are millions of test out there that have those letters on them.\"\n\nBrooke and her baby daughter Elsie appear on Loose Women (via ITV)\n\nBrooke remembers \"Brooke remembers \"It was just what I needed at that time. I just knew straight away - I just thought: 'I've got a really good feeling about this.' It went positive immediately.\"\n\nShe says \"To me, it was him making his presence known.\"\n\nBrooke was shocked to read the letters B, E and N on her pregnancy test. (via ITV)\n\nOn the 29th June 2008, Ben Kinsella was stabbed to death in an unprovoked attack.\n\nBen, who was just 16-years-old at the time, was walking home with his friends after celebrating the end of his GSCE's. The group soon realised they were being followed by a group of older teenagers, who had been involved in some sort of altercation earlier in the night.\n\nAlthough Ben was not involved in the altercation earlier in the night, the group of older boys cornered him and stabbed him to death.\n\nBen Kinsella was just 16-years-old when he was stabbed to death while out celebrating the end of his GCSEs. (via Getty)\n\nBen's family went on to form the Ben Kinsella Trust, an organisation set up to educate young people on the dangers of knife crime and help them to make positive choices to stay safe.\n\nIt also campaigns for justice for those whose lives have been by impacted by knife crime."
