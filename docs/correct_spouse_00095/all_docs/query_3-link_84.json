        "text": "EASTENDERS star Brooke Kinsella has revealed she felt her murdered brother was watching over her - after his name appeared on her positive pregnancy test.\n\nBen Kinsella tragically lost his life in 2008 when he was stabbed to death on a night out in north London aged 16.\n\nSpeaking on Loose Women today Brooke, who played Kelly Taylor in EastEnders for three years, spoke about her shock as finding the word 'Ben' on her pregnancy test.\n\nAppearing alongside daughter Elsie, who was born in September, she said: \"I've done a few tests over the years.\n\n\"But on this one, as soon as I opened it on the packaging I saw BEN.\n\n\"It seemed so silly because I'm sure the company will tell me there are millions of test out there that have those letters on them.\n\n\"But it was just what I needed at that time. I just knew straight away - I just thought: 'I've got a really good feeling about this.'\n\n\"It went positive immediately. To me it was him making his presence known.\"\n\nBrooke gave birth to Elsie three weeks early last year - explaining that her arrival had sparked \"utter chaos and magic\".\n\nShe also praised her husband Simon writing: Feeling so very lucky to have this guy. Best husband and daddy there ever was.\"\n\nBrooke and her family set up the Ben Kinsella Trust in the wake of his death, which campaigns to reduce knife crime.\n\nThe actress, was appointed the MBE in 2011 for services to the prevention of knife crime."
