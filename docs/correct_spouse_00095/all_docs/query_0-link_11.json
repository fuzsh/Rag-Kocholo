        "text": "A TV soap actress picking up an MBE at the age of 28 is an amazing ­honour – but one Brooke Kinsella would ­rather have lived without.\n\nThe former EastEnders star, who will come before the Queen on Wednesday, will be there not for her good performances but for tirelessly campaigning against knife crime.\n\nBehind it was the heartbreaking loss of her brother Ben Kinsella, 16, who was stabbed to death in the street in 2008.\n\nThanks to Brooke and her family, laws on blades have been strengthened.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The People she told of her pride and how the family is learning to move on after their devastating tragedy.\n\nShe said: “I would rather still be doing what I was over three years ago and have Ben than an MBE.\n\n“But I do think he would be proud of me and of our family. We tried our hardest to have dignity and to find some positivity and ­goodness in what happened. I hope he can see that.\n\n“An MBE is the most wonderful ­honour your country can give you. When I opened the letter telling me about it I thought it was my dad playing a joke.\n\n“I had to run around to my mum’s house to check that it was real.\n\n“I still don’t feel very deserving ­because there are a lot of people out there who have done what I have done and for a lot longer. I will feel humbled to accept it for myself. But I’m ­accepting it for my family and Ben.\n\n“After all, if it wasn’t for him none of this would have happened.”\n\nBrooke’s mum Debbie, stepdad George and sisters Georgia and Jade are equally deserving of recognition.\n\nJumping\n\nTogether they launched the Ben Kinsella Trust, a charity devoted to protecting the teenager’s memory and fighting blade crime. Their campaign for Ben’s Law ­had a success in March 2010 when the minimum jail tariff for this type of murder was raised from 15 to 25 years.\n\nBrooke was also ­appointed a Government advisor on knife crime. Her work ­secured ­£18million for at least 200 ­voluntary projects dedicated to educating young people or providing opportunities to keep them out of gangs.\n\nTalking of going to the Palace, Brooke said: “It will be a lovely day though I’m a bit ­worried I’ll trip over and fall down in front of everyone. I’ll wear a beautiful silver-grey Bruce Oldfield suit. I’m not allowed to wear fake tan in case it rubs off on the clothes.\n\n“I can’t wait to take my mum and my dad and my little nan to Buckingham Palace. Nan was jumping up and down for joy when she heard.\n\n“She is a very trendy nan and loves everything sparkly and glitzy. We’ve asked her to tone her outfit down for the Queen.”\n\nBrooke is clearly close to her family. She lives two minutes from her mum’s house in Islington, North London, and the two speak at least four times every day about “anything and everything”.\n\nAs she talks about them, she brightens, and pulls out a photo of her parents’ marriage ­blessing in Cyprus earlier this year.\n\nSupport: Parents Debbie and George in Cyprus\n\nThe leather jacket slung across the back of her chair belongs to sister Georgia, who also loaned her the eye-popping pink polish on her nails.\n\nBrooke ­today is very ­different from the steely but exhausted ­woman we ­spoke to last year. This Christmas Day the Kinsella family will do as they have done for the past three years – visit Ben’s grave, where they have planted a tree.\n\nWhen Brooke remembers Ben she is emotional but not tearful. And she is thinking more of ­what lies ahead. She said: “There wasn’t really a ­turning point. For every good day there are five bad days. But I now think about the ­future.\n\nTragic: Ben, 16, who died in 2008\n\n“For a long time after Ben died I didn’t want to be happy because I felt guilty about him.\n\n“Once you accept it is always going to hurt, that’s when you can let yourself laugh.\n\n“There will always be those bad days. But you just find yourself laughing a bit more and ­remembering without crying so much.\n\n“Now if I think I’d love to be happy, get ­married and have a baby, part of me thinks, ‘Oh that’s good, Brooke, that you’re looking ahead.’\n\n“We had Ben’s 18th birthday and three Christmases without him. You’d think we would get used to missing him but we never have. It has got a bit easier. We are laughing more. It is Ben’s 21st next year and I know that will hit hard. So I’m planning a fundraising trek with my sisters and about 20 celebrities so far.\n\nTribute: On Ben's 20th birthday\n\n“Angellica Bell, Natalie Cassidy and Louisa Lytton are all coming. I’d love to get Professor Green or Chipmunk to come too.”\n\nBrooke, who was EastEnders’ Kelly Taylor from 2001 to 2004, spent six years dating Ray Panthaki, 32 – Albert Square’s Ronny Ferreira. They split in June 2010, 12 months after Ben’s three killers were ­sentenced to life.\n\nShe said: “This year has been about me ­getting back to work and making a bit of time for myself. After I split up with Ray I saw a few different people but most of this year has been just me. I hadn’t been single since I was 15 but I haven’t even been going out on dates or anything. I’m a worrier so if I’m in a ­relationship I spend the whole time ­looking after that ­person and worrying about them.\n\n“It was nice to think about me a bit. I did ­struggle at times ­because if you have a bad day and you’ve always had a boyfriend you just want someone to lean on. But whenever I felt like that I rang my mum or sisters and they cheered me up. They are wonderful like that.”\n\nBrooke told me about her work: “On TV I tend to be playing mums lately, which worries me slightly ­because in my head I’m still 16. Recently I played a girl who was ­pregnant and I spent half the time ­thinking I looked fat and the other half thinking I want a bump.”\n\nSo does Brooke feel ready to start dating again? She smiled: “I’m ready to get back out there. That can be my New Year’s resolution. I’ve ­never really been a Bridget Jones but I hope I haven’t jinxed it by staying single this long and that I will be able to find a ­boyfriend. I don’t really have a type but I’d like someone who makes me laugh, who looks after me and who gets on with my dad.\n\n“Maybe I’ll meet the love of my life. Maybe I’ll be ­married next year. I don’t know. But I like not knowing, because I’m excited. I wouldn’t have been before.”\n\nBrooke has a great deal to look forward to. Next week she will ­appear in Channel 4 ­docudrama London’s Burning, about the ­summer riots in which Brooke plays shop ­owner Rixy. And next year she will tour the UK for four months with a new play All the Single Ladies, which co-stars Leslie Ash.\n\nTalking points: Brooke reveals all to People's Laura\n\nBrooke said: “I was worried last year that people would think all I was ­doing was campaigning and I wouldn’t get called for any acting jobs.\n\n“But it is picking up a bit now and I’m getting roles that are different.\n\n“I never thought I’d be given ­anything other than ‘typical North London girl’ parts. So it was great to be offered London’s Burning.\n\n“In All the Single Ladies, starting in January, I’ll playing a young widow from the North who has just lost her soldier husband. I’m really looking forward to ­playing a normal girl.\n\n“I usually play ­prostitutes or drug-takers.” Brooke laughed and added: “Mum says I have that kind of face. I don’t know what she means by that.”\n\nlaura.armstrong@people.co.uk\n\nLondon’s Burning, Channel 4, Thursday, December 22, at 9pm."
