        "text": "THE brother of a former EastEnders actress has been stabbed to death.\n\nBen Kinsella, 16, whose sister Brooke played Kelly Taylor in the soap, died after a row with youths.\n\nBrooke, 24, and her boyfriend, ex-EastEnders actor Ray Panthaki, were among those who paid their respects at the scene yesterday.\n\nPolice said Ben was stabbed in Islington, London, about 2am yesterday.\n\nMore than 50 people, including Birds Of A Feather star Linda Robson, gathered at the scene yesterday.\n\nOne of the dead teenager's friends said he had received a desperate phone call for help from Ben shortly before the stabbing.\n\nDavid Dugdale, 17, said: \"He called me on the phone and just said 'help'. He sounded really scared and then it just clicked off.\"\n\nAnother friend, who did not want to be named, said: \"He was a really bright kid. He has appeared in The Bill once and his sister Brooke was in EastEnders.\"\n\nAnother described Ben as a \"gentle boy\". She said: \"He wouldn't hurt you, he wouldn't even shout at anybody.\n\n\"He was the sort of boy that was a role model for everyone else. He was a good boy.\"\n\nBen was thought to have been at a party in a nearby pub, Shillibeers, earlier in the evening.\n\nAfter the stabbing, he was taken by ambulance to hospital where he died.\n\nOne witness said he saw Ben lying on the ground in a pool of blood. He said: \"There were ambulancemen putting an oxygen mask on him and trying to help him.\n\n\"Somebody told me they resuscitated him a couple of times while he was lying on the floor.\"\n\nScotland Yard said two 16-year-old youths were arrested nearby and taken to a north London police station.\n\nThey were still in custody yesterday as officers searched for a weapon near the scene.\n\nA spokesman said: \"We are keeping an open mind regarding the motive.\"\n\nBen was the 17th teenager to die as a result of violence in London this year.\n\nBob Hamlyn, Ben's headteacher at Holloway School, paid tribute to the popular student who came from \"a lovely family\".\n\nHe said: \"He was a bright kid, very high-achieving academically and would have had some very good results to look forward to this summer. He was also very sporty and had everything to live for but that has been taken away from him.\n\n\"They say there have been 17 teenagers killed this year and it's 17 too many.\n\n\"People know what they have to do, they have to stop carrying the knives and put them away.\"\n\nA spokesman for Brooke confirmed the victim was her younger brother.\n\nHer parents Debbie and George also have another daughter."
