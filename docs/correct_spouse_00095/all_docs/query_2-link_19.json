        "text": "One of my biggest blogging pet peeves is when someone says something like, “Something big is happening! But I can’t tell you what it is yet.”\n\nTHEN WHY DID YOU EVEN MENTION IT????\n\nAhem. I’m okay.\n\nAnyway, something big is happening over here. And it’s been in the works for quite a while, but until everything was settled, I didn’t want to talk about it much (by which I mean at all).\n\nWe are moving to North Carolina.\n\nBart’s been accepted to Duke’s MBA program (a top ten program! What’s a blog for if not to brag about your smarty-pants spouse? No point at all), and so in a few weeks, we’ll pack up all our belongings and drive ourselves out to Durham, where we’ll spend the next (almost) two years.\n\nBart has wanted to do an MBA for nearly our entire marriage. Last year, he applied to BYU’s MBA program and was accepted and we came very close to going, but at the last minute, we decided we’d rather defer and have Bart try to get into a higher-ranked school if he could.\n\nIn the weeks before Ani was born, we spent a lot of nights working on his applications together. The day after we brought Ani home from the hospital, he flew to North Carolina to interview (I am so so grateful my mom was here). In April, Landen and Adam kept Ella for the weekend, and Bart, Ani, and I visited Durham for Blue Devil Weekend.\n\nUntil that weekend, I’d continued to have reservations about the MBA, but when we were there, I was completely sold. I’m thrilled about this new adventure for our family and for all the opportunities ahead for Bart.\n\nHe’ll be quitting his job and attending full-time, which means I’ll be the sole breadwinner over here. If you’ve noticed an uptick in sponsored posts over the last few months, that’s why. So we can buy groceries and possibly turn on the lights in our house until May of 2015.\n\nWe’re renting a little house (a house! You guys, I’m so so excited – I haven’t lived in a house since we sold ours back in 2009. The idea of having a garage is making me a little sick with excitement. Also a hall closet. I might possibly not have to store my vacuum in the pantry), and we haven’t seen it yet, so cross your fingers it turns out to be decent.\n\nI’m ignoring the horrifying “boxing up our entire lives” and the heartbreaking “leaving all my friends in Austin” bits of the equation and just getting excited about a new chapter in our lives.\n\nIt’s pretty fun to move somewhere knowing exactly how long you’ll be there, since it really is encouraging to make the most of that time. I already have a very long spreadsheet of things I want to do while we live in North Carolina.\n\nAnd of course, there is lots to look forward to after the MBA as well, including paying off mountains of debt (wait. . . I’m not really looking forward to that part), moving somewhere new (again!), buying a minivan (oh yes, I have no doubt I’ll be a minivan mom once we have three kids), and settling into a house (assuming we move somewhere that a normal person can purchase a house).\n\nAlso, I’m feeling happy that Duke’s color is blue, rather than the deeply unflattering burnt orange of UT-Austin."
