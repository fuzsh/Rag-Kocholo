A warrant has been issued for his arrest after he hurled foul-mouthed abuse at a black woman traffic warden in the street.\n\nBrooke, 20, who plays bad girl Kelly Taylor, has been dating Jamie Brindle for more than a year but is rarely seen in public with him.\n\nAs well as subjecting the warden to a sickening tirade of racial abuse, Brindle, 23, has made his living trading in hardcore pornographic videos and magazines. And when Brooke had a storyline as a prostitute last year brazen Brindle was laughing to cronies: \"Brooke is playing a hooker on the telly and I'm working in a sex shop!\" Flashy Brindle was convicted of racially abusing and threatening the warden in August last year.\n\nHe exploded into a rage after she put a ticket on his Volkswagen Golf in Islington, North London, because he'd parked on a yellow line.\n\nHe was later fined pounds 300 by Highbury Magistrates Court and ordered to pay his victim pounds 100 compensation plus pounds 50 prosecution costs.\n\nBut arrogant Brindle has failed to pay up. He was ordered to return to court to explain why, but didn't bother turning up. Last month the court issued a warrant for his arrest - and he faces jail unless he hands himself in.\n\nThe news will infuriate the BBC1 soap's management, who hate stars getting bad publicity for mixing in the wrong company. And it's a major worry for Brooke's friends.\n\nLast night one close pal said: \"A lot of us are very concerned about her and this guy. He's a bit of a rough diamond, but she's been seeing him for a long time and it's very serious. He regularly spends nights around at her house and vice-versa.\n\n\"But he's a total Flash Harry who was cocky before he met her and now thinks he's untouchable because his girlfriend is a celebrity.\n\n\"It has all gone to his head. If he carries on the way he is going he will end up in jail.\n\n\"No one knows what on Earth he was thinking when he had a go at the traffic warden. The woman was only doing her job and he gives her a load of abuse. It's disgusting.\"\n\nThe revelation comes as Brooke stars in a high-profile plotline fighting with her on-screen best friend Zoe for the attentions of Ronny Ferreira (Ray Panthaki) from the soap's new Indian family.\n\nA BBC source said: \"To have the boyfriend of one of the actresses involved with the Ferreiras outed as a racist will cause a lot of annoyance.\"\n\nBrindle, who lives with his parents in their pounds 250,000 North London flat, got a job at posh estate agents Hugh Grove Associates in Islington last year.\n\nHe left after five months and signed on the dole. He then began working at the XYX sex shop in Soho, selling sex toys, hardcore videos and porn magazines. Brindle left a month ago after the shop was taken over, renovated and renamed Spankarama.\n\nHe has now got another job - starting in three weeks - at estate agents Friar selling exclusive homes in North London.\n\nBrooke, who made her TV debut when she was just nine, earns pounds 60,000-a-year on EastEnders. Before joining the show she appeared in The Bill and The Vice after attending the famous Anna Scher Stage School in Islington.\n\nShe made her name playing characters from life's seedier side. At 13 she played a girl sold into prostitution in No Child Of Mine and also played a prostitute in The Vice.\n\nBrooke lives with her mum Debbie and cab-driver stepfather George a few streets from Brindle. Her real father, Gary Reid, split from her mother more than 10 years ago and she has adopted her stepfather's surname.\n\nShe said of her boyfriend recently: \"Jamie keeps my feet on the ground. He takes me away from the fame and glamour of all this TV stuff.\n\n\"He does get a little bit wound up when boys try to touch or pinch my bottom but he understands that it's a different world.\"\n\nLast night Brindle claimed he was \"just a mate\" of Brooke.\n\nHe put the phone down when we confronted him with his racist conviction.\n\nr.hamer@ sunday mirror.co.uk\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nDIRTY WORK: Jamie Brindle recently left his job at a Soho sex shop; BEST FRIENDS: Kelly on screen with Michelle Ryan as Zoe; SECRET LOVERS: Soap star Brooke is coy about her relationship with former sex shop worker Jamie Brindle"
