        "text": "Former EastEnders star Brooke Kinsella has announced the happy news that she is expecting her second child. The 38-year-old actress already shares 18-month-old daughter Elsie with husband Simon Boardley, 43, who was born in September 2020 - and now a second baby is on the way.\n\nTaking to Instagram yesterday (March 22), Brooke shared an adorable image with her followers of Elsie kissing her new baby bump. She captioned the picture: \"It’s all kisses for now … Here we go again Simon Boardley.”\n\nBrooke and Simon tied the knot in 2017, and the EastEnders star has made no secret of the fact she wanted a little brother or sister for Elsie, who was born in September 2020. Brooke is best known for appearing as Kelly Taylor in the BBC soap between 2001 and 2004.\n\nREAD MORE: EastEnders fans spot massive blunder as Jean Slater talks to Harvey Monroe\n\nShe previously told Ok Magazine: \"I come from a really big family and I’m so close to my siblings. Having someone to go through life with is really important and I’d love to give Elsie that. There’s plenty of room in our home for another little one.\n\n\"We’re not getting any younger, so obviously we need to think about these things, but I’m not in a rush. I want to enjoy Elsie as a first-time mum and give her all the love and support that she needs. We’ll leave it up to the universe and see what happens.\"\n\nAside from her success in the world of acting , Brooke is also well known for founding the Ben Kinsella Trust, which she set up in memory of her younger brother who was tragically stabbed to death in 2008 when he was just 16.\n\nThe actress has been awarded an MBE for her charity work and has previously spoken of her heartache that Elsie will never have a relationship with her uncle: \"It’s a double-edged sword. Being Elsie’s mum is everything I’ve ever wanted, but on the other hand I can’t help but think about everyone who isn’t here to meet her. For me, the main person missing out is Ben.\n\n\"Obviously, I love Elsie more than anything and having loved Ben so much as well it’s heartbreaking to know the two of them will never get the chance to meet.\"\n\nLittle Elsie is also a reminder of Ben, as Brooke said during an appearance on Loose Women last year that her little girl resembled her late uncle: \"As soon as I bought the Clearblue packet, I saw the word BEN. It was him making his presence known.\n\n\"Losing a sibling... who was one of my best friends... was hard. The thought of losing a child is utterly horrendous. Now I know what there is to lose, it broke my heart all over again.\"\n\nIf you have a story you think we should be covering, email sylvie.wilkinson@reachplc.com."
