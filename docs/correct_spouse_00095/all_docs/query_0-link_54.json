        "text": "Ex-EastEnders TV favourite Brooke, 25, led mourners at a colourful, fancy-dress funeral.\n\nThe church is less than a mile from where Ben was brutally stabbed to death. Many mourners arrived in bright clothes and multi-coloured wigs, while others wore anti-knife crime T-shirts.\n\nTV favourites Gillian Taylforth, 52, Michelle Ryan, 24, James Alexandrou and Mohammed George, 26, Elaine Lordan and Joe Swash, 26, were among those at the Roman Catholic service.\n\nTearful Brooke wore a bright yellow, sequinned dress and was comforted by actor boyfriend Ray Panthaki, 29, who played Ronny Ferreira in Eastenders.\n\nThe family wrote personal notes to Ben with the flowers they brought, including a giant pair of floral red shades.\n\nBrooke wrote: “Benjamina I love you, you were a beautiful star and now you will shine even brighter. I’ll miss you so much, I love you even more. B.” Ben’s mum Debbie, 46, and dad George, 48, wrote that their “hearts are truly broken and they will never repair”.\n\nThe tribute from Brooke and his two other sisters was a rectangle of white roses with three black stars through the middle – like the tattoo on Ben’s leg which repres-ented his three sisters.\n\nOther friends carried single white and red roses while Alexandrou, 23, who played Martin Fowler in the soap, carried a wreath of white roses.\n\nSchoolboy Ben, 16, was killed during a late-night brawl that spilled out of a north London bar on June 29 and it is believed he was trying to stop the fight.\n\nBirds Of A Feather actress Linda Robson, 50, whose son Louis cradled Ben as he died on the street, was also at the service at St John the Evangelist, Islington.\n\nSix members of Ben’s family, thought to be cousins, carried his coffin into the church as Michael Jackson’s song Ben was played and a poem Ben wrote was included in the order of service.\n\nIt read: “So what comes next for me? God knows, I don’t. This is my home now and I have never felt better. There’s no weight on my shoulders, no struggle. Let’s just see what the future here brings. But at the moment this is living.”\n\nSince Ben’s death Brooke, who played Kelly Taylor in the TV soap, has campaigned to try to stop knife crime.\n\n* Three youths have been charged with Ben’s murder.\n\nJuress Kika, 18, Michael Alleyne, 18, and Jade Braithwaite, 19, are due to appear at the Old Bailey in October.\n\nA fourth man has been released on bail.\n\ngemma.wheatley@dailystar.co.uk"
