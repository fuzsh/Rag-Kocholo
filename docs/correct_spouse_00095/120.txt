Ben Kinsella, 16, brother of former EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella, was knifed in a north London street and died later in hospital.

Ms Kinsella, 24, best known for playing Kelly Taylor in the BBC soap opera, is expected to make a personal statement.

The actress, her parents Debbie and George and her boyfriend, former EastEnders actor Ray Panthaki, were among more than 50 people who paid their respects at the scene in York Way, Islington. Former Birds of a Feather actress Linda Robson also laid flowers.

Scotland Yard said it is believed Ben was stabbed during a row with a group of youths.

Two 16-year-old youths were arrested nearby and taken to a north London police station. They remain in custody.

A makeshift shrine set up near the spot where Ben died is covered with more than a hundred bouquets, balloons, an Arsenal scarf and an England flag.

Among the tributes paid were flowers and a card which read: "We will always remember you Ben for your loving ways and that great smile. Paul and Louise."

Among the young people paying tribute to Ben were EastEnders' stars Joe Swash, who plays Mickey Miller, and Charlie Hawkins, who plays Darren Miller, his half brother in the show.

Both Mr Swash and Mr Hawkins, who went to school with Ben, said they were too upset to speak.
