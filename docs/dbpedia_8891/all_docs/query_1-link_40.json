        "text": "Beloved and respected vocalist, songwriter and artist Rebecca Lynn Howard delivers “I Am My Mother,” a new song she wrote with Jamie Floyd, Rachel Thibodeau and Carolyn Dawn Johnson, on Friday May 12. Releasing ahead of Mother’s Day weekend, it’s a perennial song connecting mothers and daughters, whose sentiment translates across many iterations of family relationships.\n\nIn a city named for its world class musicians, two-time GRAMMY winner (The Apostle soundtrack and Livin’, Lovin’, Losin’: Songs of the Louvin Brothers) Howard is in a class of her own — revered by musicians, songwriters and artists alike for her expert vocals, songwriting and multi-instrument prowess, with artists and award winning peers like Patty Loveless, Lee Brice, Charlie Worsham and more already sharing their love for “I Am My Mother.”\n\n“‘Becca, your voice still slays me,” says Patty Loveless. “I LOVE ‘I Am My Mother.’ You sing it from a daughter’s heart. And I cried.”\n\nLee Brice says, “Rebecca Lynn Howard is one of the most talented humans I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with. She has a voice that has been touched by God and I cannot wait for the world to get the chance to hear her new music.”\n\nCharlie Worsham adds, “‘I Am My Mother’ feels like Rebecca Lynn Howard walked into the forgotten rooms of my heart, and turned on the lights. It’s a poignantly raw portrait of a mother and her daughter. Feels like she wrote the song about me. Perfectly written, sung and produced. Classic Rebecca Lynn. I don’t want the song to end.”\n\nRicky Skaggs says, “Incredible song and performance. It’s so great. Made me think of mom and daddy and their sweet weather beaten faces.”\n\nFor the artist herself, Howard says “I Am My Mother” is “one of the most important songs” she’s ever written. “Never has a song brought me to tears the way this one has,” she adds. “When you love and adore your mom so much, it’s an honor to write your feelings down and put them to music for the whole world to hear. This message far reaches beyond any one day where we celebrate our mothers. A mother‘s love is never ending and all year round! I love you mom.”\n\n“I Am My Mother” is the debut track from Howard’s upcoming album releasing later this year via Pump House Records, produced by Howard, Elisha Hoffman, and Lee Brice"
