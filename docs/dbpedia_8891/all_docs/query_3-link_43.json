The melody is enchanting. The production shines like crystal beads. Her soprano-leaping vocal is a delight. The songwriting is stellar: “I never want to see you again, until I see you again,” she warbles as she contemplates an up-and-down relationship while notes sparkle like glitter around her. A lovely record.” CMT.com featured the single’s official music video, along with the video for her follow up summer single “Sad Summer.” “Sad Girls Do,” her latest single and the music video, are out now.
