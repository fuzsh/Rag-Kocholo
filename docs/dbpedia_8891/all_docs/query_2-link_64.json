Thank for all you did.\n\nSteve Blow\n\nI was happy with the organization, I thought the visit was scheduled nicely; and Princess seemed relaxed; this was our first visit in this office and staff. I felt very comfortable with the new staff; I noticed not all the staff was new. We had been coming to Hometown since our first puppy, around 2000 or thereabouts!\n\nPatsy Neff\n\nIt was my first time meeting the new vet and, based off of past experiences with new vets at the office, I was pleasantly surprised. I won’t be so hesitant to make an appointment when Dr. Drish is out in the future.\n\nJenny Talley\n\nThanks for the service you provide, it’s always a pleasure to to see the care taken with my dogs.\n\nRobert Huddleston\n\nThe staff is so friendly and helpful.

Had previously gone to another vet and was not happy with service or how they treated my dog. HVC was amazing in taking care of us.
