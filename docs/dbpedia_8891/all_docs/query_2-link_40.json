        "text": "Coastal vibes of Montauk, NY. Embarking on your musical journey at age 4. What first drew you to music?\n\nMy mom would say that at a very young age, even before I could talk, I would hum along to music playing on the radio. I can vividly recall driving to school with my mom and singing along to melodies on the radio before I could even form coherent sentences. I was able to effortlessly memorize song lyrics and melodies. My parents are from Ireland, and my family spent a lot of time at my grandparent’s farm, where I was surrounded by music, storytelling, and dancing. My grandparents did not have a television, so we would sit by the fire and make our own entertainment. My parents immersed my two brothers and me in traditional music, playing Irish instruments like the fiddle, button accordion, and bodhrán. I find that Irish and country music are like distant cousins, sharing stories through lyrics and getting folks tapping their feet to the same beat.\n\nMusical heart of Nashville, TN. Traditional and contemporary music. Who were your biggest musical influences as a young artist?\n\nWell, right now, I have The Chicks playing on my speaker. I love The Chicks because their sound is a beautiful blend of country twang with a rock ‘n roll edge. Their harmonies are magical as well. I also love Kim Richey, as her sound was a real inspiration and influence on how I wanted my EP to sound. She is a master storyteller with just the right blend of folk, country, and rock-infused attitude. Mary Black is, hands down, my favorite Irish singer. I love her voice, her storytelling, and how listening to her always reminds me of being in Ireland.\n\nActor, model and championship Irish step dancing on national and international stages. Front woman of the renowned New York City Irish Band Celtic Cross. Can you tell us about a pivotal moment in your early career that shaped your approach to music?\n\nFor as long as I can remember, music has been the heartbeat of my family. We were influenced by the tunes on the radio and soaked in everything from rock and roll to country and folk music. Slowly but surely, we started melding these sounds into our own brand of music, a fusion of Celtic melodies and contemporary music. We called our band “Celtic Cross” as a nod to our diverse influence on the core of our band’s identity.\n\nWhat are five things you wish you knew when you were first starting out in the music industry?\n\nFirst off, it’s not always glitz and glam. There have been plenty of times I would change in the back of a car to get ready to get onstage. There are going to be moments when it feels like an uphill battle, but as long as that fire is in your bell, keep at it. It’s also good to get uncomfortable. Embrace the discomfort, as growth happens when you step outside the cozy bubble, and that’s when you can soar. Not everyone is going to root for you and be your cheerleader. That’s just the way of the world. As long as you have your own back and keep believing in your dreams, you will be golden! Success comes when you work hard and put in the hours. Grind like there’s no tomorrow. Nothing good comes easy; otherwise, everyone would be doing it. Last but not least, trust your gut and instincts. At the end of the day, no one knows your path better than you do.\n\nNational Anthem, NFL games, Fox & Friends, The Fox News Network, The Theater at Madison Square Garden, New York, PNC Bank Arts Center, The Museum for Television & Radio, New York, and many more. Where would you like to sing the Anthem next?\n\nI would be honored to sing the National Anthem at a sporting event in Ireland, especially when a team from the US competes against an Irish team. Representing the US and singing our anthem in Ireland would feel like a ‘full circle’ moment for me.\n\n“The Morning After the Night Before,” penned by Elisha Hoffman, Rebecca Lynn Howard, and Dan Davidson. “I absolutely love this song because it perfectly captures my struggle of never wanting to say goodbye to an awesome night out. You see, I have been accused of having my own three stages of saying goodbye. First up, we’ve got ‘The Prelude — when I drop subtle hints that it’s time to hit the road, setting the stage for the exit. Then comes the ‘Farewell Round’ — when I make the rounds, saying goodbye to each of my friends. But it doesn’t end there. Finally, there’s ‘The Exit’ — the moment when I’m practically being dragged out the door with someone saying, “We have to go, Kathleen,” waving goodbye, but not really wanting to leave.” How does the video capture the song’s message for fans?\n\nWorking with Elisha Hoffman and Rebecca Lynn Howard on this recording project has been an incredible privilege. Their expertise, guidance, and unwavering support have been one of the greatest experiences of my life. Collaborating with such talented and wonderful people has been invaluable, and I couldn’t ask for better mentors and friends on this journey.\n\nI’m absolutely thrilled about the upcoming release of the video for “The Morning After the Night Before” on May 10th. I believe it perfectly captures the essence of the song, which celebrates a modern, independent woman enjoying a night out on the town. Shooting the video in Printer’s Alley, one of my favorite spots in downtown Nashville, has been a dream come true. Having Rachyl LaGrone and Nathan Wallace in my video was not only a joy, professionally but personally as well, as they are dear friends in addition to being beautiful individuals.\n\nWhat are your aspirations for the future? Are there any specific goals you’re working towards in the next year?\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, I am excited to release my EP, Glitter Gold, on July 17th. I can’t wait to celebrate with friends and music enthusiasts at the release party in both Nashville and NYC. Additionally, I’m excited to share my new music live! Of course, I am planning to return to the studio to work on some fresh new tracks.\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nThreads\n\nSpotify\n\nYouTube"
