        "text": "Two time Grammy Award winning country music singer-songwriter, Rebecca Lynn Howard has written songs for many of her musical heroes, including Martina McBride and Trisha Yearwood, among many more. She has also enjoyed chart topping hits as a solo artist. Best known for her smash hit “Forgive”, Rebecca is held in high esteem among her fans and peers, and delivers a stunning performance every time! Her performances are more of a broken-down acoustic vibe. You’ll enjoy her original songs as well as some wonderful cover tunes, as she plays guitar along with her accompanying guitar player, Elisha Hoffman. Her voices literally soars, as she has one of the most powerful voices in the business. Be sure to book her now!"
