        "text": "has always been musical, singing since she was a toddler and teaching herself the piano. She sang in school and church, and toured with the Kentucky Opry Variety Show. She begged her mother to take her to the mecca for country singers, Nashville, a trip which she later recounted in a track on her debut album, \"Tennessee In My Windshield.\" Her break came when she recorded \"Softly and Tenderly\" for the soundtrack of the acclaimed Robert Duvall movie, “The Apostle,” in 1997. In common with many contemporary country artists, her debut album revealed a mixture of styles, not least her love of big-voiced singers such as Celine Dion. The singles \"When My Dreams Come True,\" \"Out Here In The Water” and 2002’s major hit \"Forgive,\" meanwhile, were tailor made for a crossover into the pop charts."
