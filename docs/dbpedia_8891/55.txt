Crossover artist and Two-Time Grammy Award Winner, Rebecca Lynn Howard grew up in Salyersville, KY, and moved to Nashville in 1997, where she began a career as a songwriter. Her writing style varies from deep-rooted, front porch bluegrass and mountain music, to country, to pop, to heavy power punk rock, and most everything in between. Her compositions have been recorded by major artists across all genres, ranging from Martina McBride, Patty Loveless, Reba McEntire, Trisha Yearwood, and John Michael Montgomery, to Clay Aiken, and New Medicine. She is best known for her smash hit Forgive, which is still a favorite among fans and critics alike.

Martina McBride recently cut Rebecca's song, "Whatcha Gonna Do" for her latest album. This special song moved Martina enough to go back into the studio even though she had already finished her album!
