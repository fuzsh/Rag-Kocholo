        "text": "Sue Ogrocki/Associated Press\n\nAlthough he went scoreless in 13 minutes of play during Wednesday's 112-101 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Derek Fisher passed former teammate Robert Horry as the NBA's all-time leader in career playoff wins with 156, according to ESPN Stats & Info.\n\nAt 39 years old, Fisher ranks behind only Los Angeles Lakers point guard Steve Nash as the NBA's oldest active player. Both Fisher and Nash entered the league as first-round picks in the 1996 NBA draft.\n\nFisher was selected 24th overall by the Lakers as a 22-year-old from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Nash, out of UC-Santa Clara, went 15th overall to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nIn eight seasons with the Lakers, Fisher reached the postseason every year, including a span of three consecutive NBA championships from 2000-2002.\n\nHowever, in light of coach Phil Jackson leaving the Lakers ahead of the '04-05 season, Fisher spent two years with the Golden State Warriors, failing to reach the playoffs in either campaign.\n\nThe left-handed point guard joined the Utah Jazz for the '06-07 campaign and made the Western Conference Finals in his only season in Salt Lake City.\n\nFisher rejoined the Lakers the following season and made the NBA Finals in three straight years. While he was part of the '07-08 team that ultimately lost to the Boston Celtics, Fisher earned his fourth and fifth championship rings with titles in '08-09 and '09-10, defeating the Celtics in the latter season.\n\nBy then a long-time fan favorite in Los Angeles, Fisher was painstakingly traded from the Lakers to the Rockets during the '11-12 season. However, a contract buyout prevented Fisher from ever playing for Houston.\n\nInstead, he signed with the Thunder to finish the season and made a remarkable eighth career finals appearance, eventually falling to the Miami Heat.\n\nAt 38 years old, Fisher agreed to a contract with the Dallas Mavericks for the '12-13 season, but he played just nine games before a knee injury led to his release.\n\nLater in the season, he once again signed with Oklahoma City, where he currently fills a reserve role.\n\nIn all, Fisher has made the playoffs in 15 of 17 professional seasons, with career postseason averages of 8.6 points and 2.4 assists, not to mention five championships."
