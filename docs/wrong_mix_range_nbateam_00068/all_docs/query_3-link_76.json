        "text": "LOS ANGELES — The two-time NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers' most important free agent this summer is a 64-year-old former forward with two bad knees, two artificial hips and two more championships than any coach in NBA history.\n\nWhen Phil Jackson reveals his plans for the future next week, presumably some time after the Lakers' parade down Figueroa Street on Monday, the 16-time champions can get to work on the smaller details of their upcoming run at a three-peat.\n\nAmid the confetti and cacophony of their 83-79 victory over the Boston Celtics in Game 7 of the NBA finals on Thursday night, many Lakers took a moment to consider their charmed lives. They all seem to realize they're lucky to come together around Kobe Bryant, whose sublime talent is at the center of their back-to-back titles.\n\n\"I've been openly blunt about how much I want him back,\" Bryant said about Jackson.\n\nWhile he knows some roster turnover is inevitable, Bryant also believes the Lakers have a core capable of contending for another title, even if some combination of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Joe Johnson and other free agents gets together to form that long-anticipated, Justice League-style superteam.\n\nAfter winning his 11th championship in 13 finals appearances during just 19 seasons on an NBA bench with Chicago and the Lakers, Jackson claimed Thursday night he had \"no clue\" whether he would return next year, saying he hadn't invested the time and energy necessary to determine whether he's up for another season.\n\nYet Jackson has vacillated and equivocated for nine months when asked about his plans for next season. The Lakers are thought to want Jackson to take a cut from the $12 million to $14 million he made this season, depending on various bonuses.\n\nJackson, who has claimed his pay isn't an issue, said he'll announce his future before Thursday's draft. The cautious assumption in Lakerland is that Jackson won't turn down the chance to hobble toward a fourth threepeat, since that pursuit would be a natural endpoint to his unmatched career.\n\nBut not even the Lakers brass — except maybe his girlfriend, Lakers executive Jeanie Buss — apparently knows for sure just yet.\n\n\"It does improve my chances,\" Jackson said with a grin when asked about winning another title.\n\nJackson also knows his championship team will have most of its big pieces back next season. Bryant and Gasol are under contract through 2014 after signing extensions over the last few months, while Andrew Bynum and Lamar Odom still have three more years on their deals. Ron Artest also has contract options through 2014 after signing a five-year deal as the only new addition to the Lakers this season.\n\nStarting point guard Derek Fisher is the Lakers' most prominent free agent. While the 35-year-old struggled at times during the regular season, the five-time NBA champion repeatedly delivered big baskets in the postseason.\n\nHe also inspired the Lakers with an animated speech when they headed into the fourth quarter facing a four-point deficit in Game 7.\n\n\"He's our emotional leader and our verbal leader,\" Bryant said. \"He said, 'Guys, we've got 12 minutes to dig down, get back into this game. Everything that we've worked hard for, we've got 12 minutes to put it back together.' ... That's D-Fish. That's just who he is. There's not enough words of praise that I can use to describe him.\"\n\nFisher would make an outstanding backup point guard and reserve sparkplug for the Lakers, but they don't currently have a better choice as a starter. That's the downside of the Lakers' long-term contracts: There's not a tremendous amount of flexibility to add another key component, even in a trade.\n\nJordan Farmar, Fisher's inconsistent backup, will be a restricted free agent, while improving guard Shannon Brown could opt out of a $2.1 million contract for next season in search of a pay raise.\n\nThe Lakers will spend the first weeks of their break from a 105-game season getting rest and rehabilitation — and surgery for Bynum, who played the last two months with a partially torn ligament in his right knee. Bryant has played with a broken finger, a sore back and an injured knee that was drained of fluid earlier in the playoffs, but isn't anywhere close to full strength.\n\n\"It felt good enough to get through the playoffs,\" Bryant said. \"I'm obviously going to have to look at the knee and figure some things out. I can't play a whole entire season the way it is now. Same thing with the finger. You know, without the tape, I can't grip a basketball.\""
