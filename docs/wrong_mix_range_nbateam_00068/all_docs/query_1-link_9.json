        "text": "The histories of the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers are forever intertwined via the greatness both ball clubs honed against one another over the decades of their storied rivalry. Lakers legends and Celtics greats have taken their on-court battles to the league’s biggest stage as both have fought to lead the league in titles won, now tied at 17 each.\n\nIconic Lakers have since helped contemporary Celtics find their way as NBA players as was the case with Kobe Bryant and Jayson Tatum — and former Celtics Hall of Famers now do a tidy business with a different sort of green the basis for the enterprise with Paul Pierce working with Derek Fisher and his wife and partner Gloria Govan.\n\nThat ancient rivalry still echoes in the present, and could even see the two old foes square off for Banner 18 in the 2024 NBA Finals if everything breaks right.\n\nWhich makes Govan and Fisher ideal guests to explore the state of affairs between the two teams, where they stand to start the season, and what Fisher, Govan, Pierce, Gary Payton Sr., and other Boston alumni are doing with those Los Angeles ties for the latest episode of the CLNS Media “Celtics Lab” podcast.\n\nThis episode of the Celtics Lab Podcast is brought to you by FanDuel Sportsbook, the exclusive wagering partner of the CLNS Media Network.
