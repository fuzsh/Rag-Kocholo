        "text": "Editor’s note: Lakers film analyst Pete Zayas is revisiting each game of the 2010 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. Pete began the series with his memories of June 17, 2010 and then broke down the Lakers’ Game 1 victory and the Celtics’ Game 2 win.\n\nDerek Fisher and Kobe Bryant joined the Lakers as part of the heralded 1996 draft class, but their respective journeys to get there were quite different. Kobe had all the hype of a future star with the swagger to match, entering the league at 17 years old as its first preps-to-pros guard. Fisher had just completed a four-year college career in relative anonymity at the Arkansas-Little Rock, and already possessed the NBA-ready physical build that Kobe lacked.\n\nYet despite their contrasting paths to the league, they earned each other’s respect during a rookie season in which neither played very much. Deep rotation players often have intense scrimmages at the end of practice as a means of staying sharp, and Kobe used to fondly recount stories of their bloody, full-court, 1-on-1 battles, in which neither player would cede to the other’s unrelenting competitiveness.\n\nNever was Fisher’s lack of deference to Kobe more important than it was in Game 3 of the 2010 Finals.\n\nThis is the “Derek Fisher game” in Lakers lore, legendary for his 10-point fourth quarter, capped by a game-clinching layup that’s forever part of the franchise’s historical highlight reel. Yet he made perhaps his most significant impact on this game how he often did throughout his career — in the unglamorous moments that go unnoticed by most, but are recognized and appreciated by his peers.\n\nBoston’s most common half-court action to this point of the series was built around Ray Allen’s ability to shoot off screens. Celtics head coach Doc Rivers provided Allen a menu of options from which the shooter could determine where open looks would come from, based on how the Lakers were defending him.\n\nPhil Jackson and Fisher countered by effectively cutting that menu in half in Game 3.\n\nAllen is at the top of the key in the video below, with a double flare screen to his left (Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce) and a single flare screen to his right (Rasheed Wallace). It’s up to Allen to decide which direction is most advantageous, and Rajon Rondo’s job to deliver the pass in Allen’s shot pocket at a moment that maximizes the separation that Allen has created. Fisher counters by face-guarding Allen while sitting on his left shoulder, effectively funneling him toward Wallace’s single flare screen. The Lakers’ defense can’t take both options away, but influencing Allen in a particular direction allows every defender to understand what their individual responsibilities will be in advance of the action.\n\nInstead of reacting to Allen as they did in Game 2, the Lakers were now making him react to them.\n\nAllen takes what Fisher is giving him and cuts toward Wallace’s screen, and Fisher wins the guessing game that ensues. This is the point of any off-ball screen in which the shooter must read the route that his defender is taking, and use it against him. If the defender is “locking and trailing” — staying attached to his hip while pursuing him from behind — the shooter should curl around the screen. If the defender “shoots the gap” — going under the screen while hoping to beat the shooter to the spot he wants to get to — the shooter should break off his route and flare out to the wing, where an open 3-pointer awaits.\n\nFisher chooses to shoot the gap, but Allen makes the wrong decision and still chooses to curl, playing right into Fisher’s hands. But that isn’t the end of the play, as Garnett sets a weakside pindown screen for a potential 3-point opportunity on the opposite wing. Fisher locks and trails this time, avoiding contact from KG while staying attached to Allen, who doesn’t have much of a curl opportunity due to lackluster spacing.\n\nBy funneling Allen in a predetermined direction and correctly navigating lock and trail vs. shoot the gap decisions, Fisher has flipped the possession on its head. Running around off-ball screens is where Allen is at his best, but ball screen defense is Fisher’s territory, and he has forced Allen into the uncomfortable position of being his own shot-creator. Fisher ices the side ball screen attempts of Garnett and Wallace, sending Allen away from the screen, before shooting the gap and beating Allen to his spot after he receives the handoff from KG. Allen then forces a wild attempt to beat the shot clock, and the Lakers gain possession.\n\nFisher’s Game 3 performance is remembered for his fourth-quarter scoring outburst, but his stellar defense on Allen was even more impactful. It neutered Boston’s go-to offensive action in half-court situations and left them scrambling for alternatives.\n\nYet as the Lakers neutralized one crucial component of Boston’s offense, another began to emerge. Garnett averaged just 11 points per game in the first two contests. He’d tried to push Pau Gasol around in the post as he did for much of the 2008 finals, but a sturdier base allowed Pau to hold his ground.\n\nA different approach to those same possessions allowed Garnett to find more success against Pau in Game 3. At 34 years old, Garnett no longer had the explosive first step of his youth, but he still had a quickness advantage over Pau that he began to exploit by facing up on his post catches.\n\nBelow, Garnett received the post entry pass from Paul Pierce on the opening possession of Game 3 after receiving a cross screen from Ray Allen, and KG immediately faces up. Pau is playing up on KG as not to allow a lightly contested 17-foot jumper. KG fakes a rip through middle, changes his pivot foot from his left to his right without drawing a whistle, and then drives baseline. Pau slides his feet but gets his hips slightly turned. KG spins off of him at the moment of contact, creating separation at the basket. Pau desperately tries to recover, and KG uses that to his advantage, executing a shot fake and an under-and-under combination move for the layup.\n\nGarnett changes directions at three different points during this sequence, and Pau is a half-step slow on each of them, culminating in an open layup. The Celtics under-utilized KG’s face-up game throughout the rest of the series, but it was a quality option for them when they went to it.\n\nThe Lakers altered their offensive approach in Game 3 as well.\n\nBryant was featured as a pick-and-roll ball-handler more often in the first two games than usual, which was a strategic decision that occupied multiple defenders 20 feet from the rim and allowed the Lakers to overwhelm the Celtics with their size in 4-on-3 situations. But the Lakers often lacked the requisite spacing or shooting to exploit Boston’s collapsing defense from the perimeter, and Kobe was prone to make late or incorrect passing reads as well.\n\nJackson adjusted by putting Kobe in more conventional wing situations in Game 3. Pinch-post touches and off screen actions allowed Kobe to operate without the immediate double team that came with Boston’s blitzing pick-and-roll coverage.\n\nRon Artest sets the pindown screen for Kobe on the play below. Kobe plants his right foot in between Allen’s feet and explodes toward the wing, an action known as a “v-cut.” Pierce is late on his switch, and Kobe puts on a clinic on how to maintain and improve upon an earned advantage. He attacks Pierce’s closeout with a dribble drive middle, before stepping back off of his right foot to create the final degree of separation and drilling the 20-footer.\n\nBoston countered by putting Tony Allen, one of the great perimeter defenders of his generation, on Kobe. These isolation possessions were more conducive to Allen’s talents as a 1-on-1 defender than the ball-screen situations from previous games, and he applied his familiarity with Kobe’s tendencies to prevent him from getting the separation he was achieving against other defenders.\n\nAndrew Bynum and Lamar Odom set a pair of screens for Kobe on this play, giving him the option to make a flex cut along the baseline, or pop out to the perimeter. Kobe uses Odom’s screen and eludes Allen, but Luke Walton misses that opportunity for long enough for the advantage to be eliminated. Allen was less dominant as an off-screen defender, but once he got locked into an isolation possession, he was the best in the business. Kobe tries to drive left and step back just as he did against Pierce, but Allen is ready for it and forces the jumper to beat the shot clock.\n\nKobe struggled in the second half, shooting just 5-for-16 from the field, so Jackson decided to use him as a decoy down the stretch, in an action that’s significantly more common in 2020 than it was in 2010.\n\nThe Lakers come out of a timeout with a sideline out-of-bounds play that involves all five players. Gasol and Artest set a stagger screen for Odom, which serves the purpose of occupying help defenders should Fisher or Bryant drive to the rim within the two-man game they’re running on the other side of the court. Bryant sets the ball screen sending Fisher to his left, putting Allen in the unfamiliar defensive position of having to hedge. Kobe’s gravity makes Allen reticent to leave him, while Rondo can’t fight over his screen, leaving Fisher with a wide-open, pull-up jump shot, which he buries.\n\nThe Lakers ran a variation of that same play on five consecutive possessions down the stretch, scoring six crucial points. Jackson, master of the Triple Post Offense, looked to win a pivotal Game 3 in the NBA Finals with his shooting guard setting ball screens for his point guard. And it worked.\n\nFisher’s iconic layup came with the Lakers up by four points and with 54 seconds left, after he gathered a defensive rebound underneath Boston’s hoop. Conventional wisdom dictated that the Lakers should milk the clock and get a last-second attempt — the type of possession that’s tailor-made for Kobe — but Fisher had other plans. He pushed his dribble in transition, sprinting past a surprised Garnett. Fisher was careening toward the basket by the time he crossed half court, and it was a race between him, Garnett, Allen and Glen Davis to see who would get there first. He gathered his dribble and planted his right foot on the left lane line, floating the ball just out of Allen’s reach as Davis crashed into him.\n\nFisher’s game-clinching play was indicative of the leadership and assertiveness that he brought to the Lakers throughout his two tenures with the team, and was a testament to the years of trust and respect that he earned with Kobe. Kobe was always the superior basketball talent, but Fisher never bowed to his will as many others did. And he’s the only player to share in all five of Kobe’s championships because of it.\n\nThe Lakers now had a crucial 2-1 advantage in the series, but their fortunes would turn in the next two games in Boston.\n\n(Photo: Andrew D.
