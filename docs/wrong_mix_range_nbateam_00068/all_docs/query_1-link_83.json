        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Derek Fisher and Kobe Bryant were fresh-faced rookies when they walked into the Lakers locker room for the first time in 1996.\n\nThey grew old together, competed alongside each other for 14 years and won five NBA championships wearing purple and gold.\n\nAfter stints with Oklahoma City and Dallas, Fisher left the game to younger players in 2014, when injuries took their toll and recovery took too much time. Bryant, however, played on, until his body couldn’t do it anymore.\n\nBryant played his final NBA game Wednesday against the Utah Jazz, calling it a career 20 years after that first game with Fisher.\n\n“I knew at some point (he would retire),” Fisher said from his courtside seat Wednesday. “I knew he couldn’t play until he was 75. But still, even though you know the end has to come at some point, you don’t ever expect it. It’s still bittersweet.”\n\nFisher, who coached the New York Knicks for one season before being fired, said his favorite memory was Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals when the Lakers beat the Boston Celtics for their fifth and final title together.\n\n“He wanted to win that game so badly, he was literally shaking,” Fisher said. “During a timeout (early in the game) he found a way to settle himself down.\n\n“Actually, Vanessa (Bryant) came over to the bench and somehow got him to settle down, and he slowly did calm down. That was a very powerful moment for me. Just to see one of the greatest players ever still need to calm himself down and compose himself … it was one of the most powerful moments for me.”\n\nFisher said he understood why Bryant was so amped up in that game. The Lakers weren’t just playing any team. They were playing the Celtics and 40 years of history.\n\n“I just know that as a Laker legend, you have to beat the Celtics at some point, and he probably knew at that point in his career, it was going to be the last opportunity to do that,” Fisher said. “That’s probably why he wanted to win it so badly.”\n\nFisher marveled at Bryant’s competitiveness as he scored 15 first-quarter points Wednesday and had 22 by halftime.\n\n“It looks like he still has the same mentality that he always brings to a game,” Fisher said. “I think as far as the guys on the Lakers, he’s taking it (game) more seriously than anybody.”\n\nFisher wasn’t the only former teammate at Staples Center for Bryant’s final game. James Worthy, Rick Fox, Shaquille O’Neal, and A.C. Green were among those in attendance.\n\nMany others were shown during one of three video tributes.\n\n“Kobe, old man, welcome to our new life. It was a pleasure playing with you,” O’Neal said.\n\nPau Gasol developed a close bond with Bryant during their title runs of 2009 and ’10. The Chicago Bulls center said in the tribute that “I am so proud of you. … and I look forward to our endeavors and friendship for the rest of our lives.”\n\nAnother player on those teams, Lamar Odom, said, “I just wanted to tell you that I love you, and I’m proud to have been right there with you.”\n\nKareem Abdul Jabbar, Jerry West, Phil Jackson and Bill Bertka were among other Lakers notables who bid Bryant farewell in the tributes."
