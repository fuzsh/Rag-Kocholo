        "text": "NEW YORK — Derek Fisher can’t hide the fact that he appreciates how the Celtics have gathered themselves through numerous key changes in what is a rebuilding year to still make a run at the postseason.\n\nBut that feeling doesn’t necessarily connect through some of his career wiring.\n\n“I wish them a lot of luck, other than tonight,” said the Knicks coach before taking on the Celts here last evening.\n\nFisher then grinned and added, “I know that’s hard to hear, coming from a former Laker, to wish the Celtics any luck at all. But I like Brad (Stevens), so I wish him good luck, and then he can spread it around to everybody else.”\n\nThe Knicks are obviously in the midst of a hideous season, but the fact the Celts have been able to get their act reasonably together offers encouragement here.\n\n“I think our situations are different in terms of the composition of their team and who they are and where they’re trying to go,” Fisher said. “(But) I think for our players, you always should look at other examples of other teams, other individuals, other groups that show a certain level of, you know, kind of stick-to-itiveness and not giving up on themselves or on the process because things don’t maybe go well early or they’re not going as well as they expected.\n\n“And I think they’ve done a good job with their group considering all the changes. To still be in playoff contention, I think it says a lot about Brad and what he’s doing with their team.\n\n“I think Brad has done a great job in his transition from being a college coach to an NBA coach and having a lot of question marks about how that transition would go.”\n\nAsked if he’s tried to take anything from Stevens’ style, Fisher said, “Yeah, just being quiet as much as possible.”\n\nWhile Stevens arrived with collegiate questions, Fisher took the Knicks job this season with no bench experience on any level.\n\n“That’s totally different, and I’m sure it comes with its own set of challenges,” Stevens said. “I do think that experience in this league is a huge, huge deal as you move into the coaching realm, just because I think it’s so different. It’s so different than coaching college.\n\n“But I will say that he’s done a really good job from everything I can tell, and I watch the execution, the way they’re trying to do things offensively and defensively, how hard the guys are doing those within their schemes — and then obviously his demeanor and the way that he’s gone about it in a tough situation. I think he’s handled it great, but I’m sure there are challenges that I don’t know about just being a first-time head coach and just being the first time on a bench as a coach.”\n\nYoung: Maine man\n\nJames Young remains with the Celts’ D-League affiliate, Maine, and there is no specific plan to bring him back to the NBA club just yet.\n\n“The plan is to just continue to get him opportunities,” said Stevens, “whether those opportunities are in the D-League or, if we have a situation with injuries or he plays great and he works his way back into that rotation, here. But we want to make sure he’s getting as many reps as possible.”\n\nOne to grow on\n\nThe Celtics were still smarting from Wednesday’s loss to a Heat group playing without Dwyane Wade, Hassan Whiteside and Chris Bosh. The talk has been that the Celts may have overlooked their undermanned opponent.\n\n“That’s got to be something they’ve got to get over,” said Stevens. “And I don’t think that’s been something that’s been an issue in the past, but if you don’t learn from all of the experiences you have in this league, then you’ve got to change your approach. It really doesn’t matter who’s playing; it matters what happens on that given night.\n\n“You can never forecast how somebody is going to come into a game when they’ve got a chip on their shoulder, they’ve got opportunity and they know it, and it’s their living to make.\n\n“If you have to talk about that stuff too much, then you’ve got a problem. If it happens occasionally or rarely, then you call it a mistake and move forward.”"
