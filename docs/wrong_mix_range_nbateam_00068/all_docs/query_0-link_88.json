        "text": "It's the players fault we're having this lock out. Dudes want more money, while 22 of the teams can't even manage to break even...\n\nCan't stand lock outs, I can understand the NFL, cause the players are getting fucked real good but the NBA players are little jerk offs in comparison.\n\nWhat is this ridiculousness?\n\nYou know in the NFL, the owners are asking for money right. Players aren't getting fucked at all.\n\nIn the NBA, the owners want to cut the percentage that the players get by 40% which is crazyyyyyyyy.\n\nWhat is this ridiculousness?\n\nYou know in the NFL, the owners are asking for money right. Players aren't getting fucked at all.\n\nIn the NBA, the owners want to cut the percentage that the players get by 40% which is crazyyyyyyyy.\n\nThe fuck am I reading?\n\nIn the NBA the average pay is 5Million, players are trying to boost that shit to 7Million, they're the best paid athletes in American pro-sports and most of the teams aren't even making a profit.\n\nHere's where I see shit as being pointless and greed based. Most of these dudes are some poor ass bastards coming in to the league and now that they got some money they can't take a pay cut? You're still getting paid millions bitches... to fucking stay in great shape and play a fucking game. These dudes can't sacrifice some money for the betterment of the league? Fuck them dudes.\n\nI'm not taking the owners side mind you but if taking a pay cut is the only way to help a company out, you fucking take a pay cut, it's simple.\n\nThe fuck am I reading?\n\nIn the NBA the average pay is 5Million, players are trying to boost that shit to 7Million, they're the best paid athletes in American pro-sports and most of the teams aren't even making a profit.\n\nHere's where I see shit as being pointless and greed based.

Fuck them dudes.\n\nI'm not taking the owners side mind you but if taking a pay cut is the only way to help a company out, you fucking take a pay cut, it's simple.\n\nWhat? Players have already agreed to a paycut.\n\nThey agreed to cut their share from 57% to 53.5%. The owners want it to be 37.5%.\n\nYou really have no idea what's happening.\n\nI have no idea where this players want raises came from. It simply isn't true.\n\nI am calm. Just sometimes I like to add some swear words, it sounds better, it makes it sound like I'm more passionate about my point.\n\nYou are still wrong or we've just been getting comepletely different info.\n\nWhere did you get this players want an increase in pay from? I'm curious\n\nPretty much everyone knows the players will lose money. Players know that. The question is how much\n\nWhat? Players have already agreed to a paycut.\n\nThey agreed to cut their share from 57% to 53.5%. The owners want it to be 37.5%.\n\nYou really have no idea what's happening.\n\nI have no idea where this players want raises came from. It simply isn't true.\n\nC'mon man, that's not enough, that's like getting paid 5Mil and I'm like, \"alright fine, just pay me 4.7Mil... derp\". That shit don't help none. (I didn't do any math for my numbers by the way, just what ever... but you get the point)\n\nIt's just like the economy, the country is going to shit but the government doesn't want to cut spending on Military Defense and doesn't want to tax the super rich more... it's fucking retarded and nothing is going to get fixed by cutting education programs and things that help the poor and middle class.\n\nC'mon man, that's not enough, that's like getting paid 5Mil and I'm like, \"alright fine, just pay me 4.7Mil... derp\".

I'm not defending it though.\n\nIMO, they're like actors. Very few people who can do what they do and I appreciate it.\n\nThe league could stop giving Joe Johnson 120 million dollar contracts.\n\nAlso, the owners are all pretty much billionaires and being an NBA owner is like owning a yacht. It gives prestige and apparently opens doors for more business.\n\nCan't say anything about the about the military since I COMPLETELY agree with you there.\n\noh dear it's really simple actually.\n\nunder this cba the players get 57% of the revenue while the owners get 43%. However, big market owners are still profitable due to their huge tv deals. The owners that are hurt by this cba are those of the small market teams who see very little of the overall revenue which is overwhelmingly in the hands of the players and big market owners. The big market owners are very much guilty of the current situation since they don't have to redistribute much of the revenue they gain under the current cba to small market teams, which is the case in the MLB and NFL. As a result and unlike in those two sports, 22 teams are losing money under the current cba.\n\nOf course, big market owners being greedy, tell the small market owners that they will go and get the money from the players. Of course the players are super pissed about that, and hence we have our lockout.\n\nNo NBA for a year?\n\nWell fuck my life then.\n\nHow else are we going to troll each other around june next year?\n\nWell expect this thread to die down.\n\nUnder a lockout, ALL nba activities cease.\n\nThat includes all NBA videos commentary players all of it will fade to black. Players and their organisations can have no contact. And this lockout is worst than the one that happen 13 yrs ago."
