        "text": "He might ultimately decide to jump on the next palatable offer that presents itself, but I’m told that both Fisher and the Lakers have a level of interest in reuniting down the road if the circumstances are right, suggesting that the tension stemming from L.A.’s decision to discard the 38-year-old last spring is fading.\n\nPlenty of dominoes still have to fall before Fisher, who finished last season with Oklahoma City, actually winds up back at Staples Center in purple and gold. Fisher, for starters, will have to decide how long he’s willing to wait for the Lakers to open up a slot in their backcourt rotation for him. They currently have too many point guards and too high a payroll to sign him now, which account for two of the reasons that L.A. — as ESPN.com reported Friday — is shopping Steve Blake and Chris Duhon.\n\nSources briefed on the discussions told ESPN.com on Monday that Fisher has, indeed, been verified by the league office as eligible to re-sign with the Lakers since July 1, which runs counter to the widely held assumption that Fisher had to wait at least one year from the date that the Lakers dealt him to Houston in March before a reunion with Kobe Bryant would be permissible.\n\nAnd while it’s hardly surprising that Bryant would support Fisher, a friend with whom he has won five championships, union member No. 24’s refusal to so much as throw Hunter a benefit-of-the-doubt lifeline was awfully telling. “I support Fisher 100 percent,” Bryant told CBSSports.com. “I mean, he’s the head of our [union] and you have to trust — and I know just from knowing him — that he does everything in his power to help the players out, 110 percent, even to his own detriment. So I think it’s important for us as players to always stick together in that situation.”\n\nThe public scrutiny has been on allegations of nepotism stemming from union relationships with a financial firm where Hunter’s son, Todd, is a partner; the employment of Hunter’s daughter, Robyn, and daughter-in-law, Megan Inaba, on the union staff; and payments to a Washington, D.C., law firm that employs another of his daughters. Union president Derek Fisher raised questions about those and other issues after the lockout ended, but was rebuffed by the rest of the executive committee and asked to resign. He refused, and has no intention of stepping down with two years left on his term, sources said. But the issues being examined by the law firm conducting the business review go beyond Hunter’s rift with Fisher and the charges of nepotism, a person familiar with the probe told CBSSports.com. Hunter’s salary, and the structure of the union constitution and bylaws that resulted in its approval, are among the other issues being examined, the person said."
