        "text": "— BASKETBALL Rockets waive Fisher\n\nThe Houston Rockets have waived point guard Derek Fisher, less than a week after acquiring him in a trade with the Los Angeles Lakers. Houston picked up a 2012 first-round pick from the Lakers and sent Jordan Hill to Los Angeles in the deal. Jamie Wior, Fisher’s representative, said in an e-mail that Fisher and the Rockets have negotiated a buyout of his contract, scheduled to expire this season. Wior said Fisher’s “desire to win a sixth championship is what drives him and will continue to drive him as he moves forward.” Fisher (Little Rock Parkview, UALR) confirmed late Sunday night he had reached the buyout agreement.The 37-year-old point guard gave no indication of his plans for the future. The eighth-place Rockets acquired Fisher from the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday, and the team was eager to put Fisher into its lineup, even planning to pick up his $3.4 million option. Los Angeles made the move partly to clear playing time for Ramon Sessions, acquired earlier in the day from Cleveland, but also to avoid paying significant salaries to three point guards. If Fisher clears waivers Wednesday, he would become a free agent capable of signing with any team other than the Lakers. Fisher had played in 537 consecutive NBA games and had made 371 consecutive starts over the past five seasons for the Lakers, but the NBA players’ union leader was averaging just 5.9 points - his lowest average in 13 years - and 3.3 assists this season.\n\nBoston Celtics forward-center Jermaine O’Neal will have surgery on his left wrist and miss the remainder of the season. O’Neal, in his 16th NBA season, already has missed 13 games with the sprained wrist. Celtics spokesman Jeff Twiss says no date has been set for the surgery. The O’Neal, 33, has averaged 5 points and 5.4 rebounds in 25 games, including 24 starts, this season.\n\nFOOTBALL Missouri QB to have surgery\n\nMissouri quarterback James Franklin will undergo surgery on his right shoulder and miss the rest of spring practice, but he’s expected to be ready for the start of next season. The junior passed for 2,865 yards and 21 touchdowns and ran for 981 yards and 15 touchdowns as a first-year starter in 2011. Franklin was injured last Tuesday during practice when he jumped on a fumble at the end of a play and a defender landed on his outstretched throwing arm. The surgery is scheduled for Friday and a timetable for Franklin’s return will be determined following the procedure. The school had initially hoped Franklin would heal without surgery, but after further evaluation it was decided that repairing the damage would be in his best interest long term. “We’re disappointed for James, naturally,” Missouri Coach Gary Pinkel said in a statement. “But this is absolutely the right thing to do, and we all know he’ll be in great hands. We expect him to be 100 percent and ready to go for the season.” Redshirt freshman Corbin Berkstresser started in place of Franklin for the team’s first scrimmage on Saturday and was 10 for 25 for 105 yards.\n\nSOCCER Muamba awake\n\nEnglish soccer player Fabrice Muamba began breathing independently and responding to family members Monday, showing significant signs of recovery in intensive care two days after suffering a cardiac arrest during a game.The 23-year-old Bolton midfielder collapsed on the field just before halftime at Tottenham on Saturday. Initial attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful, and his heart started beating on its own again only later in the hospital. For two days, Muamba remained in critical condition in intensive care in a heart attack unit, and his long-term prognosis was uncertain. But the Congo-born player made progress throughout Monday, with medics no longer describing his condition as “critical” by the evening. “He is continuing to show signs of improvement this evening,” Bolton and the London Chest Hospital said in a joint statement. “These are all positive signs of progress. However, his condition remains serious and the medical staff in intensive care will continue to monitor and treat him.”\n\nMOTOR SPORTS\n\nBristol changes considered\n\nBristol Motor Speedway owner Bruton Smith is considering about $1 million worth of changes to return his Tennessee track to the way it was before a 2007 reconfiguration. “We are going to take a very hard look at it this week,” Smith told The Associated Press on Monday. “We have everything in our computers that shows us what the track used to be and what it is now, and we started working on that last night. I’ll have an answer for you next week on if we’ll alter the track.” But Smith insisted it was the rain, not fan apathy over the current style of racing at Bristol, that contributed to Sunday’s poor crowd. The rain began late Saturday night and continued until about two hours before Sunday’s scheduled start. The speedway says it seats 160,000, and NASCAR’s listed attendance was 102,000. Smith said 8,120 sold tickets went unused. The .533-mile bullring was long one of the most popular venues in NASCAR because of the aggressive style drivers had to adopt to be competitive on the tight track.\n\nMEDIA\n\nLongtime writer Bisher dies\n\nLongtime sportswriter Furman Bisher, who covered the Masters, Kentucky Derby and the Georgia-Georgia Tech football game more than 50 times each, along with most of the Super Bowls, died of a heart attack Sunday. He was 93. “He put more quality words on newsprint than any other writer in the last half of the 20th century,” said Jim Minter, former editor of The Atlanta Journal and the Atlanta Constitution. “He never wrote a bad column.” Bisher spent 59 years with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution before retiring in 2009. He wrote his final column on the same typewriter he used when he started in 1950 as a reporter for the Atlanta Constitution. Bisher continued to write occasionally for the newspaper and covered the Masters, the PGA Championship and the Tour Championship. One of the biggest stories of his career occurred in 1949, when “Shoeless” Joe Jackson gave Bisher and Sport Magazine his only interview since 1919, the year Jackson was ousted from baseball in the “Black Sox” scandal."
