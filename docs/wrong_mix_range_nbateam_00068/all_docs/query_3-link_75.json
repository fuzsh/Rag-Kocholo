        "text": "Derek Fisher won five NBA titles as a player, but his career as a coach continues to be markedly less successful.\n\nThe Los Angeles Sparks announced on Tuesday that they have parted ways with Fisher, who had been serving as their head coach and general manager. Assistant coach Fred Williams will take over as Sparks interim coach for the rest of the WNBA season.\n\nThis was Fisher’s fourth season as coach of the Sparks after being hired in 2018. He also took on GM responsibilities for them in 2020. Under Fisher’s leadership, the Sparks went 54-46 (.540) and made the playoffs twice.\n\nThe Sparks entered the 2022 season with higher expectations after signing four-time All-Star center Liz Cambage to a star-studded roster that already featured the likes of the Ogwumike sisters (Chiney and Nneka) and Kristi Tolliver. But the Sparks have opened the year just 5-7, which is currently fourth in the Western Conference."
