        "text": "Derek Fisher might don a uniform — rather than a suit — the next time he roams an NBA sideline.\n\nFisher, fired as head coach of the New York Knicks back in February, posted a workout video Tuesday night that kicked off speculation the former NBA point guard is considering a return to the hardwood as a player. Sources told ESPN on Wednesday that Fisher, who turns 42 next week, indeed has been “exploring options and expressing interest in playing again.”\n\nThis is surprising news, to say the least. But at the end of the day, it might be nothing more than weird offseason chatter, though Fisher didn’t rule out a comeback Wednesday when clarifying his situation on Twitter.\n\nIn other words, Fisher isn’t actively pursuing an NBA comeback, but he’d consider the idea if the right opportunity came along. Given that he hasn’t played since the 2013-14 season, however, it’s hard to envision a scenario in which he plays again for an NBA franchise. Perhaps his best bet would be to play overseas — a source told ESPN that Fisher also was looking into playing in the Chinese professional league — but he didn’t give any indication in his tweets that such was a consideration.\n\nFisher played 18 seasons in the NBA before hanging up the sneakers in favor of dress shoes. Most of those came as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he won five NBA titles.\n\nThumbnail photo via Noah K. Murray/USA TODAY Sports Images"
