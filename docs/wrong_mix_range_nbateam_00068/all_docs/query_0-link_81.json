        "text": "Pierce scores 42 points, but Fisher powers the Lakers to a comeback win in the 2nd half.\n\nLOS ANGELES - Derek Fisher, playing his first game of the season, had career-highs of 26 points and six steals along with eight assists last night as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Boston Celtics 112-107.\n\nFisher scored seven straight Los Angeles points, capped by a jumper with 3:32 remaining that snapped a 98-all tie, and the Lakers led the rest of the way. The Celtics weren't closer than three points after that.\n\nFisher, sidelined since undergoing surgery to repair a stress fracture in his right foot Sept. 20, also had five rebounds while playing 37 minutes.\n\nHe scored 12 points in the final period, capped by a pair of game-clinching free throws with 10.9 seconds left.\n\nShaquille O'Neal had 28 points and 11 rebounds, and Rick Fox had 21 points for the Lakers, who won for the ninth time in 12 games despite the absence of Kobe Bryant, who missed his second straight game because of a viral infection.\n\nHorace Grant added 16 points, and Brian Shaw had eight points, 12 rebounds and seven assists before fouling out with 10:03 remaining.\n\nThe Celtics lost their sixth straight road game and ninth in 12 games overall despite Paul Pierce's 42 points, equaling his career high. Antoine Walker had 23 points, eight rebounds and 12 assists for Boston.\n\nO'Neal, Mark Madsen and Fisher made two free throws each in the final minute to keep the Lakers safely ahead.\n\nA three-point play by Eric Williams, who scored 14 points, capped a 13-5 Boston run to start the second half, putting the Celtics on top 67-54.\n\nThen, with Fisher, Fox and O'Neal leading the way, they outscored the Celtics 26-11 to finish the third period for an 80-78 lead.\n\nFisher was inserted into the starting lineup and helped the Lakers get off to a fast start.\n\nWhen he came out for the first time after playing 71/2 minutes, he had four points and three steals and the Lakers led 21-10.\n\nThe Celtics then went on a 19-4 run to finish the first quarter and start the second for a 29-25 lead.\n\nFisher returned and played the final 8:40 of the first half, which ended with the Celtics on top 54-49.\n\nNOTES: The win snapped a two-game losing streak for the Lakers, who haven't lost three straight regular-season games since April 1999. ... The Lakers also avoided their first three-game homecourt losing streak since January 1994. They were coming off overtime losses to San Antonio and Seattle at Staples Center. ... The Lakers had only 10 players in uniform for the second straight game because Isaiah Rider was suspended for five games last week for failing to comply with the NBA's drug policy. ... Bill Russell, who led the Celtics to 11 championships in a 13-year span starting in 1957, attended the game. ... Lakers' forward Devean George fouled out with 8:35 left after playing a total of only seven minutes.\n\nThe Celtics play three games this week, and last night's opener in Los Angeles marked the first time this season the Celtics met up with the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nBoston plays in Phoenix tomorrow night and in Denver on Friday. The Celtics beat both teams earlier this year at the FleetCenter."
