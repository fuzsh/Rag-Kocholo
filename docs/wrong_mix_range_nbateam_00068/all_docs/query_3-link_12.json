        "text": "One of the things we always practiced in LA was taking the direct line. Take the most direct path to the basket, or wherever you’re trying to get to on the court, until somebody stops you. I saw a direct line to the basket and reacted. It was the natural basketball play, attacking the basket until somebody gets in front of you. But nobody ever did.\n\nAs I got closer, I knew I could get the shot off, and that contact was going to come because there were so many guys chasing. But I was able to finish the play. To help secure that game, to help my team that way, it was just a great feeling.\n\nAfter the game, I surprised myself with some of the additional emotion that came flowing out. It wasn’t something that I felt building up or starting to happen. It just kind of happened. I actually remember having a bit of a letdown after that going into Game 4 because whatever I was feeling after Game 3 kind of emotionally wiped the slate clean.\n\nBut I’m glad we were able to respond as a team and finish that series out the right way. That entire series was an emotional one, and it took everything we had to win in seven games.\n\nThat Finals sticks out as much as if not more than any of the other ones I’ve ever been in.\n\nREGGIE’S RISE\n\nAs a player, you’re constantly trying to prove things to yourself and even sometimes to your teammates and your coaches. You want to make sure everybody knows you’re capable of getting the job done.\n\nWe’re seeing an example of that now in Oklahoma City with Reggie Jackson.\n\nReggie is having a phenomenal season so far, and he’s continued to get better on an almost daily basis. He’s a guy who works hard at his job and his game every single day. He gets to practice early, stays after practice and has really been working at his craft by doing the things that he needs to do to sustain that high level of performance. He’s shown that he can do whatever it is the team needs him to do, whether it’s as a starter or coming off the bench.\n\nThat’s an important trait for guys to showcase in this league every time they get a chance.\n\nI’m very happy for Reggie, and we have a great relationship. He’s always very open minded about the things that we discuss, talking about the game and the team. He wants to learn. He wants to get better. You can’t ask for a better teammate than that from that perspective. I think he’s going to continue to get better at a fast rate because of how hard he likes to work.\n\nOne thing that helped prepare Reggie for the season he’s having is having that experience in the playoffs last year without Russell in the lineup.\n\nWhen you get an opportunity like that, you have to make the most of it. You also have to come back the next season, and sustain some of the glimpses of greatness that you showed previously. I’m sure that factored into the way that Reggie approached this past offseason.\n\nMy first year with the Thunder, Reggie didn’t get the opportunity to play a lot down the stretch, so I didn’t get to see him play much. Last year was kind of a similar thing. I came to the team after the trade deadline. I saw a little bit more from Reggie than the year before, and he played great in the playoffs.\n\nBut the level he’s playing at now — and the consistency with which he’s playing — I can honestly say that I didn’t see it coming.\n\nWhat he’s done has been remarkable. He’s really done it the old fashioned way of just getting better a little bit each day. It seems like it happened fast, but it’s the years of work that he’s put in already that are leading to these great moments he’s having now."
