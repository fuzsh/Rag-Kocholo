        "text": "After losing five straight games and going 1-9 in their last ten, the Knicks have fired coach Derek Fisher, Knicks president Phil Jackson announced in a statement Monday.\n\nFisher, 41, was in his second season as head coach of the Knicks. New York is 23-31 this season after going 17-65 in Fisher’s first season at the helm, second-worst in the NBA.\n\nFisher, who played point guard and won five championships under Jackson with the Los Angeles Lakers, was hired by the team president with no prior coaching experience to take the reigns of a struggling Knicks franchise. He took over for Mike Woodson, who went 109-79 in parts of three seasons, but only won one playoff series during his time as head coach.\n\nAssistant coach Kurt Rambis, who was an assistant to Jackson in Los Angeles, will serve as the interim head coach. Rambis played 14 seasons in the NBA, winning four titles with the Lakers over that span.\n\n33 awesome Larry Bird photos you won’t remember\n\n[bdc-gallery id=”146679″]"
