Unlike Pierce, however, Tatum would later become a friend and mentee of the Los Angeles guard who made The Truth’s life hard in the NBA finals on more than one occasion.\n\nIt is not hard to see a bit of Bryant in the St. Louis native’s step-back daggers in the midrange, especially when Tatum clicks into takeover mode, his hyper-focused attack reminiscent of what Pierce had to try to contain during his and Kobe’s heyday."
