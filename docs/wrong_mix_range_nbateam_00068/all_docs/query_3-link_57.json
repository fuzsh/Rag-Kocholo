        "text": "By: Joshua Martin\n\nDerek Fisher, a key member of the early 2000’s Los Angeles Lakers dynasty, has made a return to the sidelines after a brief hiatus from the coaching profession. The starting point guard for one of the greatest NBA dynasties of all time, has returned but not to the rigorous task of leading old and grizzly vets through an 82 game season. This time he instead finds himself on the amateur level leading Encino Crespi High School’s boys basketball team as their new head coach.\n\nSimilar to current Lakers star Austin Reaves, Fisher made a name for himself in his native Arkansas where he laced up his sneakers for Little Rock University. Fisher played all 4 seasons there and was also named the Sun Belt Conference’s Player of the Year in 1996 as a senior.\n\nFisher was later selected in the first round of the star studded 1996 NBA Draft, where Laker Legend Kobe Bryant was also drafted. The two immediately formed a partnership that would soon bear fruit in terms of championships.\n\nThough primarily a reserve player during his early years with the Shaq/Laker dynasty, D Fish consistently started for the Lakers during the post Shaq era, briefly making stops in Golden State and Utah. His second stint with the squad was just as successful. The Lakers with Fisher as their starting point guard made 3 consecutive Finals, winning two.\n\nAfter a brief “ring chasing” phase with Western Conference contenders, The 18 year NBA veteran quickly transitioned to a coaching career with both the Knicks and L.A. Sparks. Fisher coached the Knicks during the 2014-15 season and part of the 2015-16 campaign before he was fired in February 2016. He went 40-96 during his time as coach in New York. He led the Sparks from 2019 through the early part of the 2022 season."
