        "text": "Former Los Angeles Lakerspoint guard Derek Fisher has re-entered the world of basketball coaching, this time at the high school level. Fisher, a five-time NBA champion, is set to lead the Crespi Carmelite High School boys' basketball program, located in the bustling basketball hub of greater Los Angeles. The announcement of Fisher's appointment was made by school officials on Monday, injecting excitement into the local basketball scene.\n\nThis move marks Fisher's return to the realm of Xs and Os, following his departure from professional coaching. After parting ways with the Los Angeles Sparks in June 2022, Fisher has found his way back to the bench with this new venture, his third coaching position overall.\n\nBasketball enthusiasts might recall Fisher's previous coaching endeavors. He initially stepped into the coaching arena as the head coach of the New York Knicks from 2014 to 2016. However, his tenure with the Knicks was marred by challenges, culminating in his departure after managing a win-loss record of 40-96.\n\nFisher later embraced a role with the Los Angeles Sparks in December 2018, initially as their head coach and eventually taking on the additional responsibilities of a general manager. Despite his ups and downs in the coaching world, Fisher's passion for the sport remains unwavering.\n\nFisher's new challenge in High School basketball: Nurturing talents and facing renowned rivals\n\nNow, the 48-year-old former Laker is set to helm the program at Crespi Carmelite High School, an institution with a history of fostering NBA talents. Notable players such as guard De'Anthony Melton and forward Brandon Williams have emerged from this program, showcasing its ability to nurture future stars.\n\nFisher's new squad, dubbed the Celts, is slated to compete in the competitive Mission League. Their opponents will include renowned teams like Sierra Canyon, which has seen the likes of Bronny James, Marvin Bagley III, and Brandon Boston Jr. grace its roster. Additionally, Fisher's team will face off against Notre Dame, a school that has garnered attention due to reports of LeBron James' second-eldest son, Bryce, contemplating enrollment for the upcoming year."
