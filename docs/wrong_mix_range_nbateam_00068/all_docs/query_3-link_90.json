        "text": "Let’s face it, the Knicks’ improved play in recent games isn’t going to mean much in the big picture of things given the roster will undergo an overhaul at the end of the season, when team president Phil Jackson gets to spend his mucho millions in cap space.\n\nThis isn’t college where the underdog team laden with mostly freshman and sophomores will grow into mature juniors and seniors and lead the program back to respectability. While it can be inspiring to see someone like Langston Galloway go from the D-League to the Knicks’ starting lineup, not a whole lot of what’s going on now will impact what happens next season.\n\nYet the Knicks’ recent surge, having won five of their last eight games after a 108-97 loss to the Celtics on Tuesday night at the Garden, can’t be completely discounted, especially when discussing its relevance to Derek Fisher’s development as a head coach.\n\nFisher won’t be coaching many of these players next season, but in the midst of a 10-39 record, he has shown the ability to get the most out of someone like Galloway and at least temporarily stall the climate of negativity that was starting to engulf the team. These are baby steps toward his long-term prospects as a head coach.\n\nTeaching and motivating are the cornerstones of being a good coach. For much of this season, we weren’t sure if Fisher could do either very well. Teaching the triangle offense was going about as well as herding cats and there appeared to be pockets of doubts about whether the offense and the coach could succeed. Nothing looks good when a team loses 16 straight games as the Knicks did.\n\nBut thanks to a kinder schedule and the addition of players desperate to establish themselves, the Knicks are at least playing hard and winning a few. After capturing four straight at the Garden, the Knicks came out flat against the Celtics. The hosts were down by 16 points early. A few weeks ago, they would have folded and offered no competition. Instead, they stayed persistent and cut their deficit to as low as four points in the fourth quarter before Boston regained control with torrid shooting.\n\n“We didn’t start the game with a purpose and an energy and the Celtics did,” Fisher said. “They brought the game to us right from the start and we never really could get the game back under control.”\n\nHard-fought defeats aren’t going to get Fisher into the conversation for the Coach of the Year Award, but at least he has kept everyone from abandoning a sinking ship. Trading away J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert may have lightened the resistance to change and allowed Fisher to focus on being more of a teacher than a motivator, which is something he appears to enjoy doing.\n\n“If you don’t enjoy [teaching], maybe this isn’t where you want to be,” he said. “I’m enjoying that aspect of it. That’s where the relationships with your players are truly built, in the teaching and in helping guys evolve and see the game a certain way.”\n\nIt sometimes helps when the salaries and the accolades are still part of the dream. It’s why you’re hearing the Knicks talk more about not necessarily spending the bulk of their cap space on signing one or two superstars, but spreading the wealth to acquire players still trying to pay their bills.\n\nJackson keeps attempting to shield Fisher by repeatedly accepting blame for the way the season has gone. It’s too early to tell whether he or Fisher will ever be able to fix the Knicks. At least Fisher is showing the first signs he might be a decent coach. Baby steps."
