        "text": "Very few people know the games of Hall of Fame Boston Celtics forward Paul Pierce and Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant better than five-time NBA champion Derek Fisher, who famously battled the former alongside the latter during the battles between the two rival ball clubs in the latter years of the first decade of the new millennium.\n\nNow Fisher and his wife and partner Gloria Govan are in the cannabis business with Pierce as a client as Fisher watches Kristaps Porzingis — a player he helped develop as head coach of the New York Knicks — find a great fit in Boston while star Celtics forward Jayson Tatum draws on Bryant’s unflappability to lead Boston to the top of the NBA standings early in the league’s 2023-24 season.\n\nGovan and Fisher joined the most recent episode of the CLNS Media “Celtics Lab” podcast to talk all things post-NBA business building, the Lakers-Celtics rivalry, and what he sees in a couple of key players on the Boston roster of today.\n\nThe Celtics Lab podcast is sponsored by FanDuel.\n\nListen to the “Celtics Lab” podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ"
