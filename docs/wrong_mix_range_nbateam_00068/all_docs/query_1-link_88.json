        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Derek Fisher is back.\n\nAfter 18 years playing, and a couple more coaching in the NBA, the former point guard still has a basketball in his hands, heâs still running practices, but heâs got a new squad as head coach of the Los Angeles Sparks.\n\nItâs been almost 10 years since purple and gold confetti fell on his shoulders.\n\nBut this five-time champion is stepping onto the Staples Center floor again.\n\nHeâs got the city he loves on his chest, but this huddle looks a little different that what he's used to.\n\nâItâs hard to put into words what this city means to me, it was definitely one of the three factors that led to me saying yes to this job,â said Fisher.\n\nThe season is young, and while the game is the same, Coach Fisher is still learning.\n\nAt practice heâs constantly communicating. Heâs always smiling and heâs sometimes participating in team punishments.\n\nThis is a building where Fisher helped hang history in the rafters, his players sense it, but Chiney Ogwumike knows this is a new quarter in Fishâs game.\n\nâThis is a fresh identity for him, this is a fresh outlook of basketball and I donât know if itâs like you, but heâs very much like this, and I think he knows he belongs here, he belongs as our coach. So I think walking in here will be a cool new journey for him,â said Ogwumike.\n\nSo Derek Fisher is back in the city that raised him. Heâs back in purple, gold, and now some teal.\n\nAnd The Sparks are ready to hopefully, raise another banner in Staples Center."
