        "text": "One era ended and another began when the Lakers traded veteran point guard Derek Fisher to the Houston Rockets and acquired youthful point guard Ramon Sessions from the Cleveland Cavaliers in a pair of deadline-day trades today.\n\nSessions is expected to replace Fisher as the team’s starter, although it could be that Steve Blake moves into the starting role temporarily while Sessions learns the Lakers’ offensive and defensive schemes from coach Mike Brown.\n\nIn addition, the Lakers acquired backup center Jordan Hill from the Rockets and forward Christian Eyenga from the Cavaliers. They sent Dallas’ 2012 first-round pick to Houston and traded forwards Jason Kapono and Luke Walton and their own 2012 first-round pick and future considerations to Cleveland.\n\nPower forward Pau Gasol, whose name was linked to several potential deals, remained with the Lakers, as did fellow 7-footer Andrew Bynum.\n\nGasol was considered to be the Lakers’ most valuable trading chip, but they did not move him.\n\nFisher, 37, played in his 538th consecutive game Wednesday, the longest active streak in the NBA. He hit a key basket that gave the Lakers the lead for good during their 107-101 overtime victory over the New Orleans Hornets.\n\nHis name will live in the franchise’s lore for a string of clutch shots he sank over the years, including one with 0.4 seconds remaining in a playoff game against the San Antonio Spurs and a pair of 3-pointers in the 2009 Finals against the Orlando Magic.\n\nHis emotions boiled over and he broke down in tears during a live TV interview after a fearless driving layup helped the Lakers defeat the Boston Celtics in Game 3 of the 2010 Finals en route to their second consecutive championship.\n\nFisher is averaging 5.9 points and 3.3 assists per game this season, and has averaged 8.7 points and 3.1 assists in his 16-year career – of which 13 seasons were spent with the Lakers.\n\nHowever, the Lakers had been looking for an upgrade at Fisher’s position for several seasons. They tried and failed to acquire point guard Chris Paul from the Hornets in December, only to have the deal blocked by NBA commissioner David Stern.\n\nSessions averaged 10.5 points and 5.2 assists as a backup to rookie Kyrie Irving this season, and the Cavaliers were said to have wanted nothing more than a draft pick for him. Sessions is making $4.2 million this season and $4.5 million in 2012-13.\n\nWalton battled numerous injuries and had fallen out of the rotation in recent seasons. The Lakers had hoped to find a taker for Walton without success. He has one season and more than $6 million remaining on his contract.\n\nKapono, a former UCLA standout, has played in only 27 games. His contract expires at the end of the season.\n\nIn an interesting twist, it was Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert who was so upset by the prospect of the Lakers acquiring Paul that he reportedly prompted Stern to nix it while acting in his role as owner of the league-owned and -operated Hornets.\n\nGilbert sent a strongly worded email to Stern protesting the trade, which would have sent Lamar Odom to the New Orleans Hornets and Gasol to the Houston Rockets. A package of players would have gone from Houston to New Orleans.\n\nThe Lakers would have acquired the point guard they coveted in Paul, who instead went to the Clippers in a revised swap that sent Eric Gordon and Chris Kaman from Los Angeles to New Orleans and altered the makeup of the Western Conference power base."
