        "text": "Derek Fisher is out of a job, and Matt Barnes appears to be relishing every second of it.\n\nFisher is now the former New York Knicks head coach after the team fired him Monday following a 40-96 record over his one-plus seasons at the helm in New York.\n\nDespite the dismal record, Fisher certainly had an eventful first foray into the NBA coaching fraternity. And his most notable incident involved Barnes, his former teammate with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nBarnes, now with the Memphis Grizzles, recently was suspended two games by the NBA following his reported altercation with Fisher in October. Barnes drove roughly 90 miles to his estranged wife Gloria Govan’s house, where Fisher, who reportedly was dating Govan, was visiting.\n\nSo after news of Fisher’s firing went public, Barnes posted a simple Instagram photo of himself with no accompanying text. But he said it all by not even writing a single word.\n\nThumbnail photo via Justin Ford/USA TODAY Sports Images"
