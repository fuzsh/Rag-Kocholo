Jackson says that “it has come clear to me” that he and Fisher can form a great partnership again.\n\nThe 39-year-old Fisher is respected among players around the league as was the president of the Players Association during the 2011 lockout.\n\n[protected-iframe id=”09feb59c835c65ec8afb979fa13082de-38215605-63561222″ info=”http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isSlim=1″ width=”640″ height=”390″]"
