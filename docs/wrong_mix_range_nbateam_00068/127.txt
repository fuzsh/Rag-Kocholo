Derek Fisher lost his coaching debut with the New York Knicks when Jared Sullinger scored 23 points to lead the Boston Celtics to a 106-86 preseason win on Wednesday night.

Fisher played 18 seasons in the NBA before he replaced the fired Mike Woodson in June. The Knicks went 37-45 last season and missed the playoffs, just a year after winning the Atlantic Division and advancing to the Eastern Conference semifinals.

Tim Hardaway Jr. led the Knicks with 18 points. Carmelo Anthony added 10 points on 3-for-9 shooting.

Kelly Olynyk and Marcus Thornton had 12 points apiece for the Celtics, who beat Philadelphia 98-78 on Monday night in their preseason opener. Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart each scored 11.

Boston shot 48 percent from the field and made 11 of 22 3-point attempts.

Sullinger scored eight points in the fourth period as the Celtics pushed their lead as many as 27.

Smart, who missed all eight of his field-goal attempts in his team's preseason opener, was 4 for 8 from the field and had six assists. He was selected by Boston with the sixth overall pick in this year's draft.
