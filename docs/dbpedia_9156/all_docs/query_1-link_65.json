        "text": "Roy Acuff's influence on Country Music was so great that he was the first person to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame while still living.\n\nThe scion of a respected Tennessee family, Acuff dabbled in music as a child, singing with his family and in the church choir. However his love was sports, especially baseball. He even earned a tryout with the Major leagues, but a severe case of sunstroke ruined his health to the extent that he decided to follow a career in entertainment.\n\nIn the early 1930's, he worked the Medicine show circuit. This is where he learned to play fiddle, how to entertain, and how to put on a show. One skill that was very necessary for the medicine show business was to be able to be heard singing above the din of the crowd. This ability would serve him well in the early days of radio, when his voice could be heard through the accompanying string band. In 1938, Acuff's band, The Crazy Tennesseans, auditioned for the Grand Ole Opry. Although the first audition was less than impressive, their second audition was good enough that Opry founder George D Hay offered them a contract. However he did ask for a name change, and Acuff and his band became known as the Smoky Mountain Boys.\n\nThese broadcasts sponsored by Royal Crown Cola feature country, bluegrass, and gospel music joyously played side by side. We are treated to the RC theme, a great selection of songs, and comedy from the Duke of Paducah. Whether you're a fan of Country and Bluegrass Music or not, these shows are just plain fun!"
