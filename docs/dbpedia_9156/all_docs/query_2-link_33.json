        "text": "By Morgan Simmons\n\nThe spruce top has darkened with age, and around the f-holes some of the varnish has rubbed off the wood.\n\nThe fiddle has traveled many miles. Now, it's coming home to Knoxville.\n\nIn early July, the instrument will be displayed at the Museum of East Tennessee History's \"Voices of the Land\" exhibit, where it will take its place among such iconic country music artifacts as the red dress Dolly Parton wore on stage early in her career, and Chet Atkins' original album covers.\n\nThe fiddle once belonged to Country Music Hall of Fame member Roy Acuff. He played it as a young man.\n\nIn 1975, Acuff gave the fiddle to his friend Charlie Collins, a 25-year member of the Smoky Mountain Boys, Acuff's band. This January, Collins died at his Nashville-area home after suffering a stroke. He was 78 years old.\n\nThe downtown Knoxville museum recently acquired the instrument from Collins' widow, Mary Agnes Collins, who said she likes the idea of it returning to East Tennessee, where her husband ? as well as Acuff ? had deep roots.\n\n\"I wanted it in some place where people could enjoy it ? not stuck in a vault,\" Mary Agnes Collins said in a recent phone interview. \"I think more people will be interested in that fiddle in Knoxville than anywhere else.\"\n\nConsidered \"The King of Country Music,\" Acuff was born in Maynardville in Union County. He grew up in Fountain City. He died in Nashville in 1992, just one year after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nCharlie Collins, the son of a coal miner, grew up in Clinchmore, Tenn., in Campbell County. When he was around 10 years old, the family moved to nearby Caryville, where Collins began developing his skills on fiddle and mandolin as well as guitar.\n\nAccording to Mary Agnes Collins, her husband played guitar to make a living, but the fiddle was his favorite instrument.\n\n\"He fiddled a lot at home,\" she said. \"He played the Grand Ole Opry on a Saturday night, came home and played the fiddle till midnight. I found him 7:30 the next morning. He had had a massive stroke.\"\n\nCollins joined the Smoky Mountain Boys in 1966 and remained in the band until Acuff's death. Acuff might have been Collins' boss, but the two enjoyed a deep friendship based on mutual respect. Collins served as Acuff's driver and confidant. As Mrs. Collins recalls, there were very few days when the two men weren't together.\n\n\"Mr. Acuff was demanding, but he was a good man to work for,\" she said. \"Before going out on the road, he always paid in advance. He'd tell the band members to go home and take their wives to the grocery store. He made sure we had money while our husbands were gone.\"\n\nCharlie Collins liked to comb through flea markets. One day he bought a fiddle at a flea market in Nashville, and when he got home, he covered up the scratches with iodine. The fiddle had a nice tone, and Acuff liked it, so Collins gave it to him as a gift.\n\nTwo weeks later, on June 3, 1975, Acuff reciprocated by giving Collins the fiddle that now belongs to the East Tennessee Historical Society Museum. The fiddle was accompanied by a short letter from Acuff that states it had \"belonged to John and Aunt Mary Johnson,\" and was given to him by Aunt Mary's son, Clifford.\n\nAcuff also states in the letter that he had played the fiddle for many years while living in Knoxville and Fountain City in the mid-1920s to the mid-1930s ? a time frame that would have made it his first professional instrument. That timing is consistent with the fact that in 1929 Acuff suffered severe sunstroke during spring training while trying out for the Knoxville Smokies, a minor-league baseball team. Following that setback, he gave up professional baseball and began practicing the fiddle.\n\nThe violin is stamped \"Hopf,\" and is believed to be a German commercial grade instrument circa 1890-1910.\n\nRobert Cogswell, director of the folklife program for the Tennessee Arts Commission, said such an instrument would have been held in high esteem in East Tennessee during the Great Depression.\n\n\"A slick European fiddle was a step up from the homemade fiddles that were generally available in this part of the country,\" Cogswell said. \"In that day, it was probably an instrument to be proud of.\"\n\nTo verify the fiddle's authenticity, Acuff had several witnesses co-sign his letter to Collins. One of the signatories was Smoky Mountain Boys band member Peter Kirby Oswald, known to millions as \"Bashful Brother Oswald.\"\n\nThe fiddle and Acuff's letter to Collins offer tantalizing clues pertaining to Acuff's formative years in Knoxville.\n\nA label inside the Acuff fiddle reads: \"Alburn Watson, violin maker and restorer, Knoxville, Tenn.\" Michele MacDonald is curator of collections with the East Tennessee Historical Society, and during her research she found that Watson shows up in the city directory from 1925-1930 as an employee of Southern Railway.\n\nMacDonald discovered that Acuff also is listed as being employed by Southern Railway as a machinist in 1929, the same year he suffered heatstroke.\n\nCherel Henderson, director of the East Tennessee Historical Society, said that when she looks at Acuff's fiddle, she thinks of the lives it affected.\n\n\"So many early performers got their start in Knoxville,\" Henderson said. \"That fiddle is a symbol of what this city contributed to country music.\""
