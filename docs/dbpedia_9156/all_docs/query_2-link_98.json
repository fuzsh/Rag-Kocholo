        "text": "This story pains me in various ways.\n\nFirst, and foremost the Ryman Auditorium is a most special place in the history of radio and country music. It was from this building constructed in the early 1890s by riverboat captain Thomas Ryman that first housed the Union Gospel Tabernacle, and later the world-famous Grand Ole Opry. So it is easy to see why I feel upset when rancid ‘comedy’ that spews from the likes of Tracy Morgan are able to stand on the stage that many rightly consider a most special place.\n\nIn 1952 a photo of real talent was taken from the Opry stage. I use this photo for a reason, in spite of it being almost impossible to make out the faces. That there were so many notables that could gather at the Opry nearly sixty years ago, and still be known today by their musical successes underscores the reverence people have for this stage.\n\nBy the time you get to the end of this post it will be clear that Tracy Morgan is not worthy to even sneak a glance into the Ryman Auditorium, let alone take the stage!\n\nNow the Ryman Auditorium is in the news again. This time however not because of memories about Roy Acuff and Minnie Pearl, or the music shows that fill the famed pews. No, this time the Ryman Auditorium is in the news for trash talk thanks to bigoted comic Tracy Morgan who ‘performed’ there on June 3, 2011.\n\nDuring the show Tracy Morgan said if his son was gay he better come home and talk to him like a man and not (he mimicked a gay, high pitched voice) or he would pull out a knife and stab that little (and then used the N word.)\n\nThat is only part of the anti-gay and racist rant. People who were at the show have reported that the demeanor of being a ‘comic’ left Tracy Morgan’s face, and he took on a hateful look. Hard to smile when you are talking about carving up your child.\n\nThere is more….FAR MORE…concerning the sewage that pumped out of Tracy Morgans mouth, but what I posted above is enough for CP. I am certain most of America finds this totally out-of-bounds, as I do.\n\nThe hate and rage exhibited by angry people such as Tracy Morgan astounds me. We all shake our head at the pathetic sight of Fred Phelps and think his bigotry is because he is a backwoods hick. Then we see a supposedly ‘hip’ black man like Morgan Tracy acting as bat-shit crazy as the Kansas pastor and wonder what is wrong with these people.\n\nMorgan was never funny on Saturday Night Live, but at least he was kept in check by (thankfully) the limits of television. Morgan seems to have no real talent at true comedy so makes for the most outlandish statements and that is supposed to make ticket sales increase at future venues. A most absurd business plan!\n\nI suggest the rancid Morgan consider how the stars who stood on the Opry stage made a welcoming name for themselves. Though not in the picture above, Porter Wagoner is one example Tracy Morgan might consider.\n\nWhile working in a meat shop in West Plains, Missouri Wagoner delivered his hopes via music over KWPM. His small band played over the airwaves from the store!\n\nUnlike the slick promotions or well-heeled promoters that Morgan has, stars of the early Opry had to make it on real talent! A concept more might think about. With talent and ambition along with a dose of luck many made music history. With limited money, but boundless desire, Porter moved to a radio station in Springfield, Missouri where an RCA recording contract soon followed. Even then sales were sparse, and it was not until 1957 that he first stepped on the stage at the Ryman Auditorium.\n\nSadly when Tracy Morgan made his first appearance on the Opry stage the only thing he left behind was a national mess.\n\nLets hope someone opened the glass windows in the building and let the stench out!\n\nAnd let us never allow it to happen at the Ryman Auditorium again!"
