        "text": "Roy Acuff, the singer and fiddler who was known to millions of Grand Ole Opry listeners as the King of Country Music, died yesterday at Baptist Hospital in Nashville. He was 89 years old.\n\nHe died of congestive heart failure, a hospital statement said.\n\nMr. Acuff, in his six decades as an entertainer, became known for his virtuosity on the yo-yo, his collection of handpainted ties and his ability to balance a fiddle bow on his nose. But he was first and last a \"hillbilly music\" traditionalist.\n\nHe performed his best-known songs, \"Wabash Cannonball,\" \"The Great Speckled Bird\" and \"The Precious Jewel,\" with an acoustic string band and sang in the white-gospel tenor style he had learned while listening to Baptist services performed by his father in the mountains of Tennessee. Co-Founder of a Company\n\nThe climb of Mr. Acuff, particularly after he joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1938, also coincided with country's shift from string-band and vocal-harmony music to a style dominated by solo singers with bands.\n\n\"I like to think I was the first person to bring voice to the Opry,\" Mr. Acuff once said. \"I was one of the first fellows who reared back and hit a microphone with a strong voice.\"\n\nMr. Acuff was a power in the country-music business; the character played by Henry Gibson in Robert Altman's film \"Nashville,\" Haven Hamilton, was said to have been modeled in part on Mr. Acuff's career. He was the host on weekly Grand Ole Opry broadcasts, and he founded the Acuff-Rose Publishing Company, the world's leading country-music publisher, with the songwriter Fred Rose in 1942.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
