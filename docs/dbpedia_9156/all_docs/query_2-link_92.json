        "text": "Liar – Jelly Roll Written By Max Buondonno\n\nFollowing the release of “I Am Not Okay” nearly two months ago, Jason Bradley DeFord (better known as Jelly Roll) is back with another new single called “Liar.” We’re all aware that Jelly can deliver songs with massive commercial appeal while offering enough depth to give listeners something to latch onto. This track, written by Jelly, Ashley Gorley, Ben Johnson, and Taylor Phillips, follows a similar trajectory. By detailing the struggle of recognizing and facing your demons head-on, the track is easily relatable to anyone with similar life experiences. The production is similar to what we’re used to hearing from Jelly, with each key change making the track feel anthemic and empowering. The problem lies with Mr. Roll himself; his vocals don’t deliver the same energy, prowess, or mystery as the instrumentals. It makes him seem like a fish out of water as if he wrote the song for someone else but cut a demo anyway. It’s a strange sensation, too, because the lyrics and production align perfectly with Jelly’s brand. It would make more sense if he was just a feature, but being the only credited artist leaves much to be desired.\n\n7.3\n\nHeart Like a Hometown – Keith Urban Written By Max Buondonno\n\nKeith Urban has strayed far into the pop-country genre lane for years, and it’s evident by his past few releases that his next album, HIGH, won’t be any different. But the latest song from the project, “Heart Like a Hometown,” calls back to Urban’s earlier days of crafting modern country tunes with soul and character. Written by Casey Brown, Matt Roy, and Parker Welling, the song uses a hometown as a metaphor for a man’s heart, reminding his past flame that despite him not being perfect, he loves her the same and is always welcome back. It’s a fresh take on well-written faded romances and feels like a solid fit in Urban’s immense catalog. However, production-wise, the song feels repetitive to the point that you’d swear you’ve heard this exact song from Urban in the past. The instrumentals are hardly as creative as the lyrics, and even after a few spins, the déjà vu still hangs in the air. It’s a fine song that’ll blend well on the album, but it could’ve used more imaginative production.\n\n7.1\n\nLeadfoot – Billy Strings Written By Adam Delahoussaye\n\nFrom the first time Billy Strings picked up a guitar, he’s been all gas and no brakes. The fast-fingered rabble-rouser out of Lansing, Michigan, keeps a busy schedule, and “Leadfoot” feels like he’s coming to terms with that lifestyle. The music video shows a version of Strings that’s gained a few wrinkles; contrasted with his racecar-riding alter-ego in “Leadfoot,” you get the sense the character is only an extension of himself. A long list of tour dates and most of the work here being a solo effort say the same thing: This guy does a lot. Aside from the drums, he’s credited on every instrument here, which includes a 1972 Chevrolet Chevelle. This track is an immediate jolt, ripping from zero to sixty before you’ve had time to acclimate and get a sense of this person or persona whose days seem to be behind it. Maybe Leadfoot is a part of Strings he’s leaving behind, or it could be that this track emphasizes a “warts and all” mentality to the guitar picker’s turbulent existence. Whatever the case, it’s clear that for Billy Strings, self-reflection has to bleed into the professional as much as it does the personal.\n\n8.4\n\nVegas – Midland Written By Max Buondonno\n\nMidland’s upcoming album Barely Blue is shaping up to be a solid project laced with unique production, and their latest single is no different. “Vegas,” written by Jeff Hyde, Jeremy Spillman, Ryan Beaver, and Ryan Tyndell, matches the same hazy-lazy aesthetic as “Old Fashion Feeling” and “Lucky Sometimes,” thanks to producer Dave Cobb. Retelling a story about finding true romance in Sin City, the track thoughtfully argues against the old saying, “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.” The trio’s signature harmonies and vocal delivery are entwined beautifully throughout the track, while the vintage aesthetic can easily send your mind to a smoke-filled casino floor. While it’s still unclear how this new sound will perform commercially for the band, it’s at least refreshing to see them commit to such a different sound, one that seems to pair perfectly with the identity they’ve developed over the years.\n\n8.5\n\nGood in This World – Muscadine Bloodline Written By Jack Humphrey\n\nAfter so many half-hearted kumbayahs from the likes of Garth Brooks, Tyler Hubbard, and Thomas Rhett, it’s understandable for country fans to be skeptical of a song called “Good In This World.” However, any preconceptions about Muscadine Bloodline’s plaintive appeal for common decency should be promptly checked at the door. “Good In This World” is not a preachy anthem but a thought-provoking little parable about the difference one’s attitude can make in another’s life. Written by Gary Stanton and sung by Charlie Muncaster, the song unfolds like a short storybook, sharing a few humbling encounters that remind our narrator that there’s still some “good in this world.” Gary’s nylon-stringed guitar plucking conjures up the simple texture of an old-school Willie Nelson ballad, serving as an ideal backdrop to this no-frills narrative. Together, the Alabama duo consistently proves that their brand of detailed world-building is inimitable in today’s country music landscape; with songs that sound this good, they still stand out as one of the most talented acts working today.\n\n9.0"
