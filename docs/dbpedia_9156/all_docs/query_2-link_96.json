        "text": "Jimmie Allen\n\nNet Worth: $2 million\n\nVenture: Bettie James Music and Publishing\n\nWhen Jimmie Allen made it, he had only $21 in his pocket. Now he can boast he’s done a Diet Coke commercial with Taylor Swift. Allen is famous worldwide for his tunes. Once he was homeless, living in his car in Nashville, but now he has chart-topping songs like “Best Shot,” “Mercury Lane,” “Make Me Want to,” and “Down Home.”\n\nThe multi-platinum country singer signed with Broken Bow Records and now serves as a producer on his albums. Allen won the CMA New Artist of the Year Award in 2021, making him the second black artist to do so. He also received a string of awards, including a Grammy nod in 2022. He’s collaborated with top names like Elton John, Lady Gaga, Brad Paisley in “Freedom Was a Highway,” and Noah Cyrus in “This Is Us.”\n\nLainey Wilson\n\nNet Worth: $1 to $5 million\n\nVenture: BBR Music Group\n\nThis southern girl from small-town Louisiana wrote a song about her personal experience. In her 2019 song “LA,” she sings that she’s from LA, but no one believes that. Especially with her long drawl of an accent. With two No. 1 songs under her belt, it’s no surprise that Wilson hit the charts like a locomotive with her third single “Heart Like a Truck.”\n\nIt’s about what she’s been through emotionally and how she has persevered. Wilson is truly a small-town girl.\n\nCam Net\n\nWorth: $5 million\n\nVenture: Record sales\n\nCamaron Marvel Ochs, as she was born, loved music at an early age, sang in the church choir, and grew up with the music of country greats like Patsy Cline, Willie Nelson, and Bonnie Raitt filling the house at her grandparents’ ranch. The California-based artist got her start in the music industry by writing music for the likes of Miley Cyrus and Sam Smith.\n\nSony Music signed her in 2015 and she released “Welcome to Cam Country.” Cam’s third album delivered her greatest hit “Burning House.” It went double Platinum and got a Grammy nomination. The song remains the best-selling country single by a female solo artist. She took a risk by leaving Sony for a smaller label Triple Tigers. In college, Cam studied psychology which she finds central to songwriting. She spoke about this at her TEDx Talk.\n\nMarty Robbins\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: NASCAR\n\nGrowing up in Arizona in the 1920s and 1930s, Marty Robbins was part of a large musical family of nine children. His grandfather had a way with storytelling and much of Robbins’ music tells those stories. “Singing the Blues” in 1956 was Robbins’ first No. 1 single. In 1959, he released “Gunfighter Ballads” which contained his greatest hit, the Grammy-winning, “El Paso.”\n\nHe got his own radio show, “Chuck Wagon Time,” and later, his own TV show. He was a regular on the Grand Ole Opry stage for 25 years. This country singer had a love of racing too and rose to the top racing division. Robbins was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1982. He died that same year.\n\nBilly Joe Shaver\n\nNet Worth: $3 million\n\nVenture: Record sales\n\nOutlaw country music singer Billy Joe Shaver was born in Texas and raised by his mother and grandmother. He was introduced to country music by accompanying his mother to work in Waco, at a nightclub. Soon enough, Shaver hitchhiked to Nashville and got paid to write songs.\n\nHis first album, “Old Five and Dimers Like Me” came out in 1973. Shaver has been honored for his songwriting with the Poet’s Award by the ACM and by collaborations with artists like Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash. Bob Dylan even gave him a nod singing, “I’m listening to Billy Joe Shaver, and I’m reading James Joyce.” He starred in several films, but his career was cut short in 2020 when he died at 81.\n\nRoy Acuff\n\nNet Worth: $61 million\n\nVenture: Acuff-Rose Music\n\nRoy Acuff is a legend. He played his songs on the Grand Ole Opry, the nation’s top radio show. He is the fourth-ever Country Music Hall of Famer, but the first to be inducted while he was still alive. Known as “The King of Country Music” he played the fiddle and was actually instrumental in inventing hillbilly music.\n\nHis influence was so great, that a 1940s Tennessee governor blamed Acuff for causing the state to be the “hillbilly capital” of the nation. He was an enterprising man who had the vision to build a very lucrative publishing house with partner Fred Rose — Acuff-Rose Music.\n\nTownes Van Zandt\n\nNet Worth: $1 to $5 million\n\nVenture: Record sales\n\nTownes Van Zandt is considered country music’s best songwriter, as well as a derelict and a rambler. An old tale goes, Bob Dylan once arranged a meet-up with Van Zandt to get one of his songs. And though it is rumored he had a soaring IQ, Van Zandt’s career was racked by self-destructive behavior and early death because of it, leaving the world in 1997.\n\nBut like Johnny Cash, a renaissance of the artist is being celebrated — his work is emulated by rock musicians, gaining a wider appreciation, but this is long past his death. Since, Van Zandt’s songs were featured in “The Big Lebowski,” “Breaking Bad,” True Detective,” and “Deadwood,” to mention a few. And this compliment: Bob Dylan covered his song “Pancho and Lefty” in 2004.\n\nChris LeDoux\n\nNet Worth: $15 million\n\nVenture: Record sales\n\nBesides being a great musician, LeDoux was also a rodeo champion, before he got into music, retiring in 1980. His first album is, “Sing Me a Song, Mr. Rodeo Man.” The Wyoming native was also a bronze sculptor. In music, he’s gone gold twice and his album, “20 Greatest Hits,” went platinum. He pumped out 36 studio albums during his shortened lifetime.\n\nHe was 56 when he died. When Chris LeDoux died, Garth Brooks performed “Good Ride Cowboy,” a song he came out of retirement to pen for the fallen country music star, at the Country Music Awards in 2005. A year earlier, LeDoux lost a battle with a rare type of cancer, and everyone in country music mourned him greatly.\n\nGranger Smith\n\nNet Worth: $6 million\n\nVenture: The Iron Council\n\nThis native Texan, also known as Earl Dibbles Jr., made it big in 2016. Granger Kelly Smith, which is his given name, was born in Dallas on September 4, 1979. He was just 19 years old when he sealed a Nashville contract. Two years later, Smith signed with Wheelhouse Records, a division of Broken Bow Records.\n\nHe has hit songs, “If the Boot Fits” and “Backroad Song.” His fans like to call him Earl Dibbles, Jr., and he calls his fans, “Yee Yee Nation,” which they identify with. He is on his way up, but on his way, he has played at the White House three times and performed for the troops in Iraq and Kuwait.\n\nSteve Earle\n\nNet Worth: $5 million\n\nVenture: Twangtrust\n\nGrowing up in San Antonio, Texas, Steve Earle dropped out of school by age 14 and went to work in various jobs like construction. Singer/songwriter Townes Van Zandt took him in and taught him how to make a living playing guitar. The hard-drinking Van Zandt was a bad role model but a “real good teacher.” Earle became a hard drinker too. Earle would go on to identify with the outlaw country genre.\n\nIt was in 1975 that he arrived in Nashville. Elvis Presley wanted to buy one of his songs, but the King never showed up to record it. Johnny Lee sang one of Earle’s songs in 1982, and Earle was signed by LSI Records. He debuted with the album “Guitar Town” and recorded 20 more. The Grammy-winning artist appears on television and in film. He is also an author.\n\nConnie Smith\n\nNet Worth: $8 million\n\nVenture: Record sales\n\nRolling Stone Magazine ranked Connie Smith as one of the top 100 greatest country music artists of all time. She’s in her eighties now, but she’s still working. She released her 37th studio album at 80. She grew up in the Midwest, one of 14 children, and struck her own path after winning a 1963 talent contest in Ohio.\n\nBill Anderson, impressed by her performance of “I Thought of You,” took Smith to Nashville and made her a star. Known as the “Queen of Broken Hearts,” Smith’s music comes from her emotional struggles.\n\nWynonna Judd\n\nNet Worth: $12 million\n\nVenture: Alii spokesperson\n\nWynonna Judd became a country music sensation with her mother, Naomi Judd. In fact, the Judds were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in May of 2022, approximately a month after Naomi died.\n\nBut Wynonna’s solo career has been just as successful. She struck out on her own in 1991 and it was a significant moment when Wynonna scored three No. 1 hit singles. Wynonna’s fame was so great she was invited to the White House in 2019 to support prison reform.\n\nJennifer Nettles\n\nNet Worth: $20 million\n\nVenture: American West Jewelry\n\nPlaying music in church is almost an unwritten rule for country music success and Jennifer Nettles is no different. This artist, who is also an actress, lived her life on a musical path taking classes and attending a music college, always working hard, and focused on her career.\n\nNettles has said that the big day came when she and her five-guy band got Luke Lewis to show up at a gig. As head of Universal, MCA, Mercury, it was a thrill when he asked, ‘Do you want to be signed by MCA or Mercury?’ at the end of their show. She’s the proud owner of three Grammy Awards and four CMAs.\n\nKellie Pickler\n\nNet Worth: $7 million\n\nVenture: USO Global Ambassador\n\nOne of singer/songwriter Kellie Pickler’s latest gigs is hosting SiriusXM’s, “The Highway.” Pickler, who is also an actress, made her breakthrough on “American Idol.” She starred in Hallmark Channel’s most popular movies and co-hosted the talk show “Pickler & Ben.” Plus, she won the Mirrorball Trophy on “Dancing With the Stars.”\n\nShe has a gold album, “Small Town Girl,” and a Platinum single, “Best Days of Your Life.” She won a CMT for “Red High Heels” and her song, “I Wonder,” plus a CMA nomination for the best new female singer.\n\nJamey Johnson\n\nNet Worth: $8 million\n\nVenture: BNA record deal\n\nHeavily inspired by Hank Williams, Jamey Johnson kicked off his own career by signing with BNA Records in 2005. His song “The Dollar,” a heart-wrenching song about a little boy and his father, went to No. 14 on the country music charts.\n\nHis top three most popular songs are “In Color,” “The Dollar,” and “High Cost of Living.” The country music crooner made it big after dropping out of college. He was pulling straight-As at Jacksonville State University but quit and joined the Marines as a reserve. Johnson penned songs for Willie Nelson, George Strait, Merle Haggard, and Trace Adkins.\n\nKelly Clarkson\n\nNet Worth: $45 million\n\nVenture: Wayfair brand ambassador\n\nKelly Clarkson has sold more than 25 million albums. She is one of the most successful country singers to win “American Idol.” She won the first season in 2002. A year later, Clarkson had a song on the Billboard 200. The singer/songwriter, author, and television personality became the best-selling country artist of 2002 with “A Moment Like This.”\n\nIn 2004, Clarkson won two Grammys and sold 12 million copies of her album “Breakaway,” which veered into pop music. Now, she’s a leading contender on the daytime talk show circuit with two Emmy Awards for her eponymous show.\n\nJosh Turner\n\nNet Worth: $17 million\n\nVenture: “Man Stuff”\n\nJosh Turner graduated from a musical college before winning a contract at Music Row, which led to his signing with MCA Nashville Records. His first album, “Long Black Train,” made a splash in 2003 with the title single, selling over a million copies.\n\nHe became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 2001, making him the youngest male singer to be invited. He performed “Long Black Train,” which was inspired by listening to a box set of songs by Hank Williams. His song “Time Is Love” was 2012’s biggest country song. In 2014 he moved into the niche of motivational authors with his book, “Man Stuff.”\n\nRandy Houser\n\nNet Worth: $4 million\n\nVenture: Movie career\n\nLearning the guitar early in life, Randy Houser started a band at the age of 10. It would be many years later when he hit success. In 2008, Universal South Records signed him.\n\nHis single, “How Country Feels,” made it to No. 1. Broken Bow Records produced the album of the same name, “How Country Feels,” and it was his third album. Talking to “Taste of Country,” Randy Houser dished about his gradual move into the film industry but shot down any thoughts of doing reality TV.\n\nRodney Atkins\n\nNet Worth: $5 million\n\nVenture: Rod + Rose\n\nRod + Rose Rodney Atkins discovered a love for music in college. He packed up and moved to Nashville and got signed by Curb Records. That was in 1996, although he didn’t get a No. 1 hit until 2006, with “If You’re Going Through Hell.”\n\nFive other No. 1 singles followed, including the very successful “Watching You.” Atkins has released five studio albums. Today he is still making music, but he is forging a new path. After his record company gave him the suggestion, he made an album with his songwriting wife. Their debut together is called, “Rod + Rose.”\n\nThe Band Perry\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: Crossover to pop\n\nThe Band Perry is a trio of siblings. Kimberly Perry sings lead vocals and plays guitar while Reid Perry is on bass and Neil Perry plays mandolin and bouzouki. When Garth Brooks’s manager discovered them, things got hot quickly. They’re first single, “Hip to My Heart,” landed on the Billboard Hot Country chart.\n\nTheir single “If I Die Young” went to the very top of the country music chart. Apparently not satisfied with country music stardom, the band released “Live Forever” in 2015, presenting their crossover to pop music.\n\nThompson Square\n\nNet Worth: $1.4 million\n\nVenture: Stand-Up\n\nIt all started when Shawna Thompson met Kiefer Thompson. They weren’t married yet; they had met at a songwriting competition and had been songwriting separately as solo acts. The two launched a team effort called Thompson Square but they would not make it big for 15 years.\n\nThey released an album in 2011 and the single, “Are You Gonna Kiss Me or Not,” put them on the charts. It went double platinum. As a couple, they’ve been successful too. The duo has been married just over 20 years and have a son named Rigney Cooper.\n\nDan + Shay\n\nNet Worth: $1 to $3 million\n\nVenture: The Garage\n\nYou may think Dan + Shay made it big on “The Voice,” but actually they got their foot in the door touring with Blake Shelton. Shelton invited the pair on his world tour as an opening act before he invited them to “The Voice.” Dan + Shay is Dan Smyers and Shay Mooney, two guys who met in Nashville and sparked an instant and lasting bromance.\n\nThey started writing songs together and their self-titled album came out in 2018. They’ve been raking in the cash with hit songs like “You,” “Speechless,” and “Tequila.” The latter, “Tequila,” won a Grammy Award.\n\nChris Young\n\nNet Worth: $4 million\n\nVenture: Chris Young Cafe\n\nCountry music heartthrob Chris Young scored big with his second album, “The Man I Want to Be.” The 2009 release produced three No. 1 hits, including the title song. The single, “Getting You Home (The Black Dress Song),” was a big hit. It was the second single on the album, and it was nominated for a Best Song Grammy Award.\n\nYoung got his foot in the door after winning the title of a singing competition TV show, “Nashville Star.” He became a proud member of the Grand Ole Opry in 2017. His philanthropy efforts include donations to music programs for kids, St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital, Hurricane Harvey relief, and the Chris Young Café at his alma mater in Nashville.\n\nMerle Haggard\n\nNet Worth: $40 million\n\nVenture: The Colorado Weed Co.\n\nMerle Haggard is a country music legend who left us in 2016 on his 79th birthday. He grew up hard in the dusty middle of central California in Bakersfield. His father was in and out of prison several times before he died when Merle was 9.\n\nHaggard followed his dad’s footsteps, and it landed him in San Quentin several times, mostly for robbery. Upon his latest release, a soulful reflection found him making music. He wrote, “Sing Me Back Home,” a song about being in jail, and recorded it in 1967. In his life, he achieved the Country Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nPatsy Cline\n\nNet worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: Ten million records sold\n\nCline is one of the most influential, celebrated, and beloved musical recording artists of the 20th century, renowned especially for her vocals. She was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, becoming the first female to do so.\n\nShe was both a pioneer for being a female country music star and for creating the Nashville sound. A couple of her biggest hits are, “Crazy” and “I Fall to Pieces.” In 2005, her greatest hits album sold 10 million copies. She did not live to see massive success, like becoming a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1960. Patsy Cline was only 30 years old when a tragic plane crash took her life.\n\nGeorge Jones\n\nNet Worth: $35 million\n\nVenture: Possum Holdings LLC\n\nGeorge Jones is revered in country music circles. He was born in Texas, grew up in a large musical family, and got his first guitar at nine. He was influenced by Hank Williams, who was his idol, and even collaborated on a song with him. Jones found fame in 1955 with his single, “Why Baby Why.”\n\nNicknamed “The Possum” for his facial features, Jones sent more than 160 singles to the charts. He was an award-winning country singer who lived to be one of country music’s greatest until his death in 2013. He married country music great Tammy Wynette and the two made hit duets together like, “The Grand Tour.”\n\nHank Williams Jr.\n\nNet Worth: $45 million\n\nVenture: Popcorn Sutton’s Tennessee White Whiskey\n\nHank Williams Jr. grew up immersed in country music as his famous father’s sidekick. By age 17, he made his debut singing “Long Gone Lonesome Blues,” a Hank Williams Sr. song. When he was 14, he played his dad’s hits on “The Jimmy Dean Show.”\n\nWilliams Jr. became much more lucrative than his father with his mix of blues, rock, and country. He put out 21 albums with 30 Top Ten singles. His accolades are many and he is loved for songs like, “Your Cheatin’ Heart,” “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry,” and “Hey Good Lookin’.” Since 2010, Williams has been making moonshine.\n\nHank Williams\n\nNet Worth: $1 million ($8.8 million in today’s dollar)\n\nVenture: “Take These Chains from My Heart”\n\nHank Williams is one of the most influential American singer/songwriters of all time, not just in country music, but generally in US music. He is a Hall of Famer in both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nWilliams managed to get 55 of the singles he recorded to land in the top 10 of country western charts. This astounding talent struck gold, but he did not live long enough to reap his reward as sadly a heart attack took his life in 1953. Four months after he died his song “Take These Chains from My Heart” hit No. 1 on the country charts.\n\nRandy Travis\n\nNet Worth: $32 million\n\nVenture: Actor\n\nVeteran country music star Randy Travis has had astounding success since he debuted in 1995.

The chart-topping song, “I Hope” stayed at the top for many weeks. She also hit the top with the single, “Pick Me Up.” She gave the song a significant bump by performing it on “American Idol.”\n\nBarrett is a two-time Billboard Music Award Winner. She is no flash-in-the-pan; she has been performing music since she was 11 years old. Her album “Goldmine” opened with the largest streaming week ever for a female country artist. Barrett’s success is unstoppable.\n\nOld Dominion\n\nNet Worth: $33 million Venture: Old Dominion\n\nOld Dominion is Matthew Ramsey, Trevor Rosen, Whit Sellers, Geoff Sprung, and Brad Tursi.

The Old Dominion boys have been rocking together since 2012.\n\nWith 13 singles, seven made it to No. 1. Their first No. 1 song, “Break Up With Him,” is a heartache ballad about a drunken call to a girl and begging her to leave her boyfriend. Old Dominion’s hard work has been paying off. The five-man band won the CMA Group of the Year award for four consecutive years, plus it’s been nominated for a slew of awards.\n\nBill Anderson\n\nNet Worth: $6 million\n\nVenture: Radio station owner and restaurant chains spokesperson Bill “Whispering Bill” Anderson III is a country music legend. His songs are so famous George Strait and Ray Price covered them, to name a few. The singer/songwriter from Columbia, South Carolina grew up in Decatur, Georgia made his mark with the song “City Lights” way back in 1958. A few weeks later he won a recording contract with Decca Records.\n\nHe continued to write popular country songs for six decades. In all, he made 45 studio albums. By 2001, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. With 37 top ten country music songs, he surely deserves it.\n\nFrank Ray\n\nNet Worth: $2 million\n\nVenture: BBR record deal\n\nFrank Ray is a rising country star. He is a New Mexico native and a Latin man whose music is loved for his bilingual tunes. He signed with BBR Music Group in 2021, but he had to give up his day job first. Ray was on the Las Cruces police force serving as a police officer when his music career took off.\n\nThere is no end in sight for the “Different Kind of Country” singer now. In 2022, it was a special day for Ray when he got to debut at the iconic country music venue, the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nIngrid Andress\n\nNet Worth: $3 million\n\nVenture: Amazon’s “A Lady Like That”\n\nIngrid Andress is a singer/songwriter from Colorado. In her first two years, her meteoric rise has found her nominated for three Grammys, two CMAs, and a CMT. In her third year as a country music star, she toured with Keith Urban. Andress got her start in 2010 on NBC’s “The Sing-Off” teaming up with such stars as Alicia Keys, Sam Hunt, and Charli XCX.\n\nHer debut album, “Lady Like” was nominated for Best Country Album. Andress is clearly just getting started!\n\nPriscilla Block\n\nNet Worth: $1 to $5 million\n\nVenture: GoFundMe\n\nIn 2020, Priscilla Block went viral on TikTok with her song “Just About Over You” before record labels took notice. The Nashville recording artist then signed to Mercury that same year. Getting a label was thanks, in part, to a TikTok fan who created a GoFundMe. The goal was to raise enough money to make available a recorded copy of the song.\n\nAfter succeeding, “Just About Over You” rose to No. 17 on the charts. There’s nowhere but up for this North Carolina native who sings songs about relationships that her folks totally relate to.\n\nSam Hunt\n\nNet Worth: $30 million\n\nVenture: Record-breaking album \"Montevallo”\n\nSam Hunt has had incredible success as a country music singer/songwriter. His debut album “Montevallo” beat records set by Billy Ray Cyrus and Clint Black, and he set his own.\n\nBefore ruling the country music charts, Hunt was writing songs for country greats, Kenny Chesney, Keith Urban, and Reba McEntire. He’s won a Grammy, a CMT Music Award, an AMA, and Billboard awards. In his college days, Hunt was a star quarterback at his Georgia high school and made the cut to play quarterback at college. When his football dreams came up empty, he learned to play guitar, to kill time, as he says it. Next, he moved to Nashville.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nNet Worth: $1 million\n\nVenture: The Trash Guys\n\nDylan Scott has been making hit songs since 2013 with the single “Makin’ This Boy Go Crazy.” He got noticed on social media. His song “Can’t Have Mine (Find You a Girl)” blew up on TikTok. His No. 1 hit, “Nobody” and single “New Truck” hit the charts by conventional release via recording company Curb Record.\n\nSuccess is sweet for this boy from rural Louisiana. Also, Scott started a more traditional business venture filling a need in the city of Union Parish, his hometown. He runs it with Jordan Powell and the business partners call it The Trash Guys.\n\nJackson Dean\n\nNet Worth: $4 million\n\nVenture: TikTok popularity\n\nFamous from nothing, Jackson Dean rose to fame on TikTok and Instagram. He was shacking up on his grandfather’s property which consisted of a concrete slab paired with no running water or electricity. It was his song, “Don’t Come Lookin’” that put him on the map.\n\nHis music has the freewheeling vibes of a rambling lifestyle with an upbeat tempo. He’s come a long way. His country music is on the soundtrack of the Netflix series, “The Ice Road.” In an interview with Entertainment Focus, Dean shared the meaning behind \"Greenbroke,\" his album title. A green broke is a horse that is not quite tame. He says broke horses are docile, but a green broke “has a mind of its own.” Perhaps a bit of his own spirit.\n\nTyler Hubbard\n\nNet Worth: $25 million\n\nVenture: Big Machine Label Group\n\nTyler Hubbard has made more money in a decade than most people expect. He got famous with Florida Georgia Line, a country duo. Hubbard shared the stage with Brian Kelley, and they hit No. 1 with their 2012 single, “Cruise.” The band’s wild success has put the wind under his financial wings, and now he lands his aircraft on the expansive grounds of his family’s Nashville mansion.\n\nThe so-called “bro-country” collaboration blew up in just the petty drama you’d expect. Hubbard “unfriended” his bandmate Kelly and the bromance broke up. Hubbard’s solo career kicked off with, “5 Foot 9,” and the single rose in the charts immediately. “Way Home” is his second release, a song he claims takes him back to his roots. He calls it “honky-tonk” and “church” worthy.\n\nJelly Roll\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: Music Row\n\nNashville rapper Jelly Roll evolved his musical inspiration from hip-hop to country music. The Tennessee-born musical artist started out making mixtapes and ended up being so big that the corporate restaurant chain Waffle House took note. His album from 2013, “Whiskey, Weed & Waffle House” had to be changed, as per a cease-and-desist order by the restaurant.\n\nSo, now it’s, “Whiskey, Weed, and Women.” The whole scuffle ended up bringing him a publicity windfall. He came from hard times but overcame multiple addictions, depression, going to jail, and being shot. Jelly Roll’s appeal is credited to his storytelling style. Life experiences fill his songs like, “Sober” and “Son of a Sinner.”\n\nJohn Denver\n\nNet Worth: $60 million\n\nVenture: The Hunger Project\n\nJohn Denver’s music was so embraced by Americans that he was the best-selling musical artist in 1974. One of those most famous ballads is, “Country Roads,” a tune about going home. Denver’s song “Back Home Again,” from the album of the same title, won the 1975 Country Music Song of the Year Award. It was his first hit song to make the country music charts.\n\nDenver had a giving heart. His efforts to combat hunger were honored by two U.S. presidents and Windstar Foundation, his wildlife preservation effort in Colorado, saved 1,000 acres of forests. John Denver died tragically in 1997 while attempting to land his small plane near Monterey, California.\n\nCody Johnson\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: Warner Music Nashville 50/50 partnership\n\nFew get more country than this chap. Cody Johnson is a former semi-pro rodeo rider who hails from Texas. His plan was to ride bulls, but instead, he got famous singing. His first album was called, “Black and White Label.”\n\nCody Johnson has released eight albums, six of which were self-released, a much more lucrative deal, and he was able to retain ownership of the material. His first was “Ain’t Nothin’ to It.” That album debuted at No. 1 and finished by scoring gold: two gold albums and one platinum. His latest song to go platinum is “Til You Can’t.” People everywhere listen to his good ol’ country music. He’s streamed one billion songs.\n\nWalker Hayes\n\nNet Worth: $4.5 million\n\nVenture: Proto Walker\n\nHayes and his family are just regular folks. To give you a taste, this is his Instagram bio: “17 years, 7 kids, 4 dogs, 2 gerbils, 3 record labels, 4 publishing deals, 3 managers, 1,000 heartbreaks, and 1 number one song.” After his success with the song “AA,” he followed up with “Drinking Songs.”\n\nThe Nashville singer comes from Mobile, Alabama. His first chart-topper was “Pants.” Now, he’s the first artist to perform shows via hologram with the new Proto technology. Pretty fancy!\n\nZac Brown\n\nBand Net Worth: $50 million\n\nVenture: Southern Ground\n\nThe Zac Brown Band’s first hit song that made it to radio, “Chicken Fried,” came out in 2008. It’s been a rushing river of success for the boys ever since with 16 chart hits. However, before that windfall, the band struggled for 10 years.\n\nThe Zac Brown Band even got to open for The Rolling Stones, a once-in-a-lifetime chance with a 78-year-old Mick Jagger. Their success doesn’t stop there. The band’s business venture, the Zac Brown Collective, originally called Southern Ground, sells fashion, food, design services, and gear.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nNet Worth: $120 million\n\nVenture: Sold 90 million albums\n\nThere are few names in country music (and outside of country music), that bring such appreciation as Johnny Cash. His career life was a bumpy one, but his fans are forever endeared. With nearly five decades of making music, Cash has a claim to CMAs, Grammy Awards, and No. 1 hits. He is a Hall of Famer in five different institutions. Cash first signed a record contract in 1955.\n\nSome of his best-liked songs are, “I Walk the Line,” “Folsom Prison Blues,” and “Ring of Fire.” The Man in Black sold 90 million records and won 13 Grammys and nine CMAs. In the 1960s, substance dependencies derailed his success, temporarily. June Carter talked him into treatment, they married, and he came blazing back. He even got his own variety TV show.\n\nAlabama\n\nNet Worth: $400 million\n\nVenture: Tennessee River Music, Herefords & Angus\n\nThis award-winning, No. 1 song-making band was huge in the eighties. Alabama put out 21 new singles — in a row — that went to No. 1. The country band’s success was unprecedented. So, it’s no surprise Alabama is called the most successful country music band ever. This band racked up 30 career No. 1 hits.\n\nSome of those are “Feels So Right,” “Old Flame,” and “Take Me Down.” Lead man Randy Owen formed the band in Alabama in 1969. His cousins Teddy Gentry and Jeff Cook helped him kick it off. They gained attention by appearing on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.” The Southern rockers bring together folk, bluegrass, pop, and gospel and it appealed to a lot of people. Randy Owen’s side business is cattle ranching.\n\nVince Gill\n\nNet Worth: $40 million\n\nVenture: JWS Publishing\n\nVince Gill’s father, an appellate court judge who played country music on the side, taught young Vince to play the banjo. Growing up in Norman, Oklahoma, he was drawn to other string instruments and then joined a bluegrass band. Finally, in 1989 Gill broke into the big leagues with his album, “When I Call Your Name.”\n\nGill is a 22-time Grammy winner. It’s a record that makes him the top male country music singer ever, according to the Recording Academy. He’s also won 18 CMA Awards and five Vocalist Awards and has been a Grand Ole Opry member since 1991. Since his first hit, Gill has put over 50 songs on the Top 40 and he has sold 26 million albums. “I Still Believe in You” has been his biggest winner with more than 5 million copies sold.\n\nBrooks & Dunn\n\nNet Worth: $100 million\n\nVenture: Perfect Pitch Publishing\n\nRonnie Dunn and Kix Brooks were a pair of singer/songwriters who teamed up to make the band Brooks & Dunn. Their collaboration came together in 1990 with each leaving a solo career behind. Together they moved mountains. They were named Vocal Duo of the Year more times than you can shake a stick at, almost every year until 2006.\n\nTheir album “Brand New Man” went platinum six times — sextuple platinum! It was their debut recording that was released in 1991. They’re still at it. They put their song “Neon Moon” on TikTok, and it went viral. Dunn, however, has made it known that TikTok was certainly not his idea, he’s never used it, but agreed to put out the song. He was not impressed, that is until he saw the number of clicks their TikTok got.\n\nThe Carter Family\n\nNet Worth: $3 to $5 million\n\nVenture: Music copyright\n\nFrom 1927 to 1941, The Carter Family was highly influential and musically productive. They recorded hit song after hit song and developed some of the standards-to-be of country music. For instance, the guitar plucking style that became typical in the genre was created by Maybelle Addington Carter.\n\nMaybelle is one part of the trio and is related as a cousin. Rounding it out is, married couple Sara Dougherty Carter and Alvin Pleasant “A.P.” Carter. The family members hail from Virginia. The Carter Family is known for their hit, “Keep on the Sunny Side,” which shows up on the “O Brother, Where Art Thou” soundtrack. This trio of musicians is reverently called the “First Family of Country Music.”\n\nChad Brock\n\nNet Worth: $100,000\n\nVenture: TCN\n\nIf you’re a veteran WCW fan, you’ll probably recognize Chad Brock from his old wrestling days in the mid-'90s. The wrestler was always a singer at heart and moved from Florida to Nashville to try and become a popular country singer. His wrestling career was quickly dispatched due to an injury that prevented him from wrestling. This was just the push he needed to return to music, as Brock went on to release several albums.\n\nHe released three albums which have seen moderate success. His strongest single to date was \"Yes!\" which reached first place on the country music charts. Since then, he has left the music scene to co-host a morning show in Tampa, Florida.\n\nSawyer Brown\n\nNet Worth: $9 million\n\nVenture: Beach Street Records\n\nIf you've heard of the popular country singer Don King who ruled the '70s and '80s with more than fifteen hit singles on the Billboard charts, you probably remember that he had a band of musicians that toured with him across the US. When the popular singer retired, those musicians chose to stick together and in 1981 they formed Sawyer Brown, the popular country-pop band that was founded by Mark Miller, Gregg \"Hobie\" Hubbard, Bobby Randall, Joe \"Curly\" Smyth, and Jim Scholten.\n\nThe band’s country, rock and pop musical style was an instant hit. The band went on to release eighteen studio albums and had over fifty songs appear on the Hot Country Songs charts. Their most successful songs to date are \"Step That Step,\" \"Some Girls Do,\" and \"Thank God For You\".\n\nKip Moore\n\nNet Worth: $4 million\n\nVenture: Slowheart\n\nMany fans of the hip Kip Moore don’t know that the singer never really set out to develop a musical career, and to some extent, stumbled into it. When he was younger, Moore would travel as a backpacking nomad and spend most of his time after college surfing in Hawaii while living in his tiny Hut. In 2004, after what we imagine were some really great days of tanning and working on his beach bod, Moore decided to try his luck at singing and moved to Nashville, where he met the successful producer Brett James, who helped him get a label deal with MCA Nashville.\n\nMoore would go on to receive critical and commercial acclaim for his first album, “Up All Night,” which was the best-selling first album of any male country star for both 2012 and 2013, and achieved platinum status by the RIAA shortly after its release.\n\nLee Ann Womack\n\nNet Worth: $20 million\n\nVenture: CMT Crossroads\n\nWhen Lee Ann Womack first appeared in the country scene, she was instantly recognized as a modern mix of Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. When Ann Womack debuted in 1997, she instantly received fame and acclaim for her music. She is best known for the title song “I Hope You Dance” from her debut album, and has managed to achieve quite a lot with a relatively small discography.\n\nThe traditional country singer took a break in 2008 and only returned to the music scene six years later with the album “The Way I’m Livin”, which sold over six million copies in the US. Ann Womack has definitely built a very impressive career with a relatively low amount of work, compared to other country singers, and currently boasts a net worth of around $20 million.\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nNet Worth: $25 million\n\nVenture: Willie’s Reserve\n\nYou may recognize Willie Nelson from various films and TV shows. Despite looking like your favorite uncle during the time he rebelled against your aunt and to prove his independence, Nelson has built a substantial following of fans and a net worth of around $25 million. He is actively involved in poetry and activism, mostly focusing on the topic of legalizing the use of Cannabis.\n\nNelson has also been around for a long time now, and originally signed his first label deal in 1973 with Atlantic Records after growing his fame through folk music. The singer has since changed his tune and focused more on outlaw country music rather than classic American folk, with his most famous album being “Wanted! The Outlaws.” Nelson currently spends his time and wealth on his business which sells marijuana-related products, as-well-as various activism efforts for legalization.\n\nJana Kramer\n\nNet Worth: $2 million\n\nVenture: \"Dancing with the Stars\"\n\nWhile you may know Jana Kramer as one of the stars of ABC’s American dance competition, \"Dancing with the Stars,\" Kramer decided to fully embrace the country path and debuted her musical career in 2012.\n\nSo far, the young actress and singer's albums received very favorable sales and reviews, and have both reached high spots in the charts, with seven singles also reaching the charts. She’s most recognizable as an actress for her role as Alex Dupre on \"One Tree Hill.\"\n\nBlanco Brown\n\nNet Worth: $500,000\n\nVenture: The Git Up\n\nThe singer has managed to combine the two most unlikely genres of rap and country into some of the most engaging and unifying forms of music that we’ve heard in the last few years. Brown brilliantly manages to take the best rap and hip-hop have to offer and distill them into an extremely positive country musical experience.\n\nThis young artist from Atlanta appears to be doing exactly the right moves since his works have led him to sell over twenty million records in his very short career so far.\n\nBillie Jo Spears\n\nNet Worth: $1.9 million\n\nVenture: The Estate of Billie Jo Spears\n\nBillie Jo Spears was a popular country star from back in the ‘60s, who was mostly known for her hit song “Mr. Walker It’s All Over.” Widely regarded as the “Queen Mother” of country music by fans and critics alike, Spears had a wonderful streak of singles that became hits on the charts. Her musical career began stagnating and was eventually paused for a few years due to personal reasons — and fans were demanding a comeback.\n\nFollowing a few years of hiatus, Spears managed to surprise everyone when she released her most famous and successful song to date, \"Blanket on the Ground,\" which came out in 1975 and became an instant hit. She continued releasing albums into the '80s but her fame and popularity began to fade in the United States, although she was still very popular in the UK and even recorded albums that were almost exclusively released in Britain. Spears eventually passed away in 2011 leaving her wonderful music behind for the world to enjoy.\n\nJuice Newton\n\nNet Worth: $4 million\n\nVenture: Los Angeles Equestrian Center\n\nOver the years, Juice Newton’s musical style has changed from the focused tunes of classic country music to a more general style of country-pop that many crossover artists engage in these days to reach a broader audience. This caused audiences to label her as a crossover star, a title that some classic country musicians criticize and avoid at all costs.\n\nNewton has received many awards throughout her career which began in 1975. Amongst her proudest musical achievements and recognitions are five Grammy nominations with one win, an Academy of Country Music Award, and two back-to-back Billboard artist awards. Her albums have consistently reached platinum and gold status, with the most successful one being her Greatest Hits compilation.\n\nJon Pardi\n\nNet Worth: $8 million\n\nVenture: Heartache Medication\n\nEven at a young age, Jon Pardi proved his musical and business skills were valuable assets when he formed his own band back when he was still just in high school.

The two country stars, Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry decided to kick things together and formed a classic duo in 1991. The successful country-rock band gathered a small audience that combined the influence of both singers and also collaborated with other artists like the Allman Brothers and Charlie Daniels. Their success led to a combined net worth of roughly $10 million.\n\nThe band was signed with Columbia Nashville and released six albums during a decade starting from the late ‘90s. The country duo was quite successful and managed to release twenty different singles that have appeared on the country charts. In 2007, the band was hit by a sudden tragedy when Troy Gentry was involved in a fatal helicopter crash. Despite Gentry’s tragic death, Eddie Montgomery still tours under the name of the band to this day.\n\nRonnie Milsap\n\nNet Worth: $14 million\n\nVenture: WB4KCG\n\nWhat happens if you combine Elvis Presley, Elton John, and Johnny Cash into a musical country genius?
