        "text": "Today on my \"spin down all the pictures on your phone's gallery and write about the picture that you stop on\" article topic, we find ourselves at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nI tagged along with my dad in 1989 when he was headed down there to do a bunch of interviews for his \"Grass Roots Gold\" radio show. The show is still running in several states in what is now its 50th year.\n\nBack in 1989, when you went to a show at the Opry, you could watch it from the back of the stage. Which also meant that you could wander around before the show from dressing room to dressing room and visit with the performers. And that's how I got my picture taken with Roy Acuff.\n\nI'm assuming that you can't wander around, unsupervised, at the Grand Ole Opry these days in our post covid world.\n\nBut Nashville is different now. The town has changed to appeal to a younger demographic. Sure, you can still swing by the Country Music Hall Of Fame. But now you can have dinner and drinks at Dierks Bentley bar, Whiskey Row.\n\nOr any of the other celebrity-owned joints like A.J's Good Times Good Time Bar owned by Alan Jackson. Or any of the others owned by Florida Georgia Line, John Rich or Kid Rock.\n\nAnd Nashville even went and got themselves an NFL team so that when you visit, you can make an entire weekend of it.\n\nJust might have to get back there."
