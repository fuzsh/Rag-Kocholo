        "text": "The Liberal Democratic Party faces a fresh headache tied to the political comeback of former Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka: What should be done about her LDP member husband?\n\nNext summer, Naoki Tanaka will seek re-election to the House of Councilors, contesting a Niigata constituency on the LDP ticket.\n\nYet his defiance of party rules in supporting his wife's independent campaign for November's House of Representatives election has provoked anger among some LDP members seeking blood.\n\nThis in turn has prompted concern among others that any punitive action would merely spur Makiko Tanaka to step up her verbal offensive against the LDP and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi."
