        "text": "The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has sacked two gaffe-prone ministers in an attempt to win opposition support for the tax rises he says are needed to rein in public debt, which has been compounded by the recovery effort following last year's tsunami disaster.\n\nNoda replaced five cabinet members including the defence minister, Yasuo Ichikawa, who drew criticism for describing the 1995 rape of a Japanese schoolgirl by three US servicemen on the southern island of Okinawa as an \"orgy\".\n\nThe new defence minister, Naoki Tanaka, is the husband of the former foreign minister Makiko Tanaka and the son-in-law of Kakuei Tanaka, who was Japan's prime minister in the 1970s.\n\nThe Liberal Democratic party, the biggest opposition party, had threatened to boycott tax debates unless Noda removed Ichikawa and the consumer affairs minister, Kenji Yamaoka, who had voiced support for a pyramid investment scheme and compared the collapse of the euro to the tsunami disaster.\n\nNoda, Japan's sixth leader in five years, appointed Katsuya Okada – regarded as a fiscal hawk – to the newly-created position of deputy prime minister.\n\nOkada, previously the secretary general of the governing Democratic party of Japan, has held senior government posts and is expected to initiate talks with opposition parties over reforms that include a controversial doubling of the consumption (sales) tax.\n\nNoda has proposed a two-stage doubling of the 5% consumption tax by 2015, a move many believe is inevitable if Japan is to address its national debt, which is at about 200% of GDP.\n\nHe had initially resisted, but appears to have accepted that sacking the pair represented his best chance of mollifying the opposition with only days before the reopening of parliament.\n\nEven with Ichikawa and Yamaoka gone, Noda cannot be certain that the reshuffle will have the desired effect. Opposition groups can use their control of the upper house to block the reforms, and have repeated calls for an early general election.\n\nNoda's support rating has dropped in recent weeks amid opposition to the tax rises among the public and inside his own party. A Kyodo poll, released last week, showed public support for the cabinet at 35.7%, down from 44.6% in December.\n\nThe finance minister, Jun Azumi, conceded that public confidence in Japanese politicians had been weakened by their response to the 11 March tsunami disaster and the almost ritual annual change in national leadership.\n\n\"However, we need some rules to create consensus between the ruling and opposition parties,\" Azumi told reporters before the reshuffle.\n\n\"We have to strengthen our organisation and work hard to approve the sales tax hike in what is sure to be a difficult parliament session.\"\n\nKoichi Nakano, a professor of politics at Sophia University, told Reuters: \"Maybe Okada can add a certain gravitas to the cabinet. But the opposition want an election this year, so it's almost a lost cause.\""
