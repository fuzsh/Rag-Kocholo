        "text": "If you were Junichiro Koizumi, about now you might be wishing you weren’t so damned prophetic. During campaigning for parliamentary elections in July, the Japanese Prime Minister won over voters by giving them bad news, straight-up: the country’s ailing economy would get a lot worse before it got better. Well, last week lived up to Koizumi’s predictions, in spades. The benchmark stock market index sank to its lowest level in 17 years, new numbers showed that industrial output and retail sales are slowing more dramatically than expected and, in the unkindest cut of all, credit rating agency Moody’s said it might downgrade Japanese government bonds to the same level as Slovenia’s. Slovenia’s!\n\nIt was a reality-check week for the Prime Minister, and for the people who believe he is the man who can pull the country out of its economic doldrums. The unremitting bad news rattled Koizumi into tracking back, ever so slightly, from his promises of speedy, painful reform. That pledge he made in July to limit government borrowing this year to $8.25 billion? Now he says that’s just a target, not written in stone. Those big-spending supplementary budgets he derided in his stump speeches? Koizumi now thinks one will be necessary this year, after all. The three-year deadline for cleaning up banks’ bad loans? Hmm, that might actually take longer. This doesn’t add up to a major policy retreat, but Koizumi’s waffling amid looming economic catastrophe raises some critical questions: Is he up to the task? And what does Koizumi really want for Japan? The fact is, no one really knows. Since becoming Prime Minister, Koizumi has carefully avoided the microscope even as he has basked in the spotlight.\n\nMost people seem to like the Koizumi they see. What’s not to like about this touchy-feely New Age leader who is the antithesis of the stiff old pols who preceded him? Economists at home and abroad laud the clear-eyed reformer who recognizes that the system stinksand says he will take a sledgehammer to it. Fellow world leaders wish they had his approval ratings, which stand at about 70%. “Whatever you’re doing,” George W. Bush told Koizumi during his July visit to Camp David, “I envy those numbers.” The Japanese can’t get enough of him. Youngsters, particularly female ones, rave about his hip, wavy hairstyle. A record label released a CD of his favorite Elvis hits, with Koizumi posing next to a life-size statue of “the King” on the cover. (They share the same birthday.) There’s a mint-flavored chewing gum named after him. Millions of people tune in to watch him on televised parliamentary debates. His posters outsell those of pop stars and baseball heroes. Last week, a glossy photo book about him hit the stores, with a blurb from Koizumi that says, “Everything you want to know about me is in here.”\n\nNot quite. In reality, much of the Koizumi storyand a sizeable chunk of his personahas been carefully airbrushed out of his public profile. Few realize that the effervescent election campaigner is in fact a loner, isolated from all but a tight-knit circle of longtime advisers; or that the New Age reformer is an old-fashioned nationalist at heart, influenced by some of the country’s most extreme right-wing politicians; or that the man with the seemingly natural empathy for people is, in his private life, aloof and cold, prone to putting career before family. And only his closest friends realize that this consummate politician deeply despises Japanese politics, for reasons that are as much personal as they are philosophical.\n\nAn understanding of the inner Koizumi is crucial: his chances of resuscitating the world’s second-largest economy may depend on which aspects of his complicated character govern his decisions and actions.\n\nKnow first that Koizumi the maverick is very much a product of the Establishment. His father, Junya, was a member of parliament and Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) stalwart who helped draft Japan’s security agreement with the U.S. When he died in 1969, Junichiro was studying in London. He hurried back home and, while sorting through Junya’s papers, discovered that his future had been laid out for him. “Certain victory, Junichiro-kun,” read a note written in his father’s script. In Japan, political inheritance is common: about a third of the seats in parliament are passed from one generation to the next. So Koizumi’s election should have been a slam dunk. Instead, he suffered an embarrassing defeat in Yokosuka, his family’s parliamentary district. “His political base was fragile, because a lot of new people were moving into the urban areas,” says Naoki Tanaka, an economist who now heads a Prime Ministerial advisory panel. “And at first, his speeches were not very good. He was very shy.”\n\nAfter that electoral defeat, Koizumi signed up as an assistant to an LDP heavyweight, Takeo Fukuda. The job involved answering the phone, greeting guests, running errands and even dusting Fukuda’s shoes. It was Koizumi’s political boot camp. His antiestablishment streak developed under Fukuda, himself a bright, squeaky-clean policy wonk who frequently took on the LDP’s most powerful clique, headed by Kakuei Tanaka and filled with politicians with cozy ties to special interest groups like construction bosses, farmers and war veterans. This is the faction most dependent on pork-barrel politics, campaign war chests and the obtaining of government largesse and protectionism in exchange for votes. “Fukuda was insulated from all the pork-barreling, and that had an effect on Koizumi,” says Naoki Tanaka. Under Fukuda’s tutelage, the future Prime Minister came to understandand loathethe corrosive influence of money in politics. He watched with mounting disgust as LDP bosses doled out jobs, contracts and favors to their friends and supporters. It was no coincidence that the first institution he attacked as a young politician was the post office, which sits on a huge treasure chest of Japanese personal savings and is linked with the kinds of officials his mentor so despised. “When Koizumi says ‘reform’ he means to destroy that faction,” says Katsuyuki Yakushiji, a journalist who has known the Prime Minister for many years. “The fact that reforming might also be good for Japan is secondary.”\n\nUnder Fukuda, Koizumi also learned the importance of developing a personality. For as clean-cut as Fukuda was, he was unable to connect with the masses and thus lacked the power base from which to do battle with the Old Guard. Koizumi carefully cultivated the image of the Outsider. He avoided the restaurants where politicians lived it up and cut their backroom deals. “Faction bosses would go out with their underlings, drinking and singing,” says Takao Toshikawa, a political analyst in Tokyo. “But they would all look around the restaurant, and someone would say, ‘Where’s Koizumi?’ He never went along. They all thought him strange.”\n\nBeing a maverick and an iconoclast in an ossified political culture helped Koizumi’s career. But being a loner can be a huge handicap when you’re trying to tear down that cultureand have powerful, entrenched forces fighting you every step of the way. The LDP conservatives, led by the formidable Ryutaro Hashiimoto, want no part of Koizumi’s reform agenda and are determined to preserve the business-politics relationships the Prime Minister has sworn to destroy. They are waiting to pounce: at the first sign of vulnerability, they will surely come after Koizumi as they did with previous reform-minded Premiers. “They’ve been waiting years to dig up some scandal on Koizumi,” says his longtime aide, Isao Iijima. “But there is no scandal. So they’ll have to come after us on ideas, but you know what? They don’t have any.”What Koizumi needs to do is win himself some allies in parliamentfrom among younger LDP legislators, perhaps, or even from the opposition. He was smart to sign up the young, hard-charging Nobuteru Ishihara to head up administrative reform in his Cabinet, and there are dozens of other younger pols, inside and out of the LDP, that he would be wise to court. But his natural aloofness makes it hard for him to reach out. And the few friends he has in politics are more likely to get him into trouble than out of it. Koizumi is close to right-wingers like Shintaro Ishihara, the Tokyo governor and Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former Prime Minister, and it was apparently on their advice that he made his first political gaffe: on Aug. 13, he paid his respects at Yasukuni, the Shinto shrine where Japan’s soldiers, including indicted war criminals, are honored. The right-wingers supported him as pacifists and even mainstream politicians objected. The gesture infuriated Japan’s neighbors, notably China and South Korea, who viewed the Prime Ministerial visit to the shrine as condoning Japan’s wartime aggression. Koizumi’s efforts to get back in Beijing and Seoul’s good graces have thus far been snubbed.\n\nHis enemies at home let that misstep pass: his approval ratings are still too high for them to try anything drastic. But popularity is only a temporary shield. The voters who were so impressed by Koizumi’s campaign candor might well feel differently if they have to endure many more weeks like the last one. And once his ratings fallbelow 40% would start to make him squirm, according to analyst Toshikawait will be open season on Koizumi.\n\nIf he needs a cautionary tale about the impermanence of popularity, Koizumi need only call on former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. In 1993, Hosokawa was a proto-Koizumi: a young, telegenic maverick, who promised to mend Japan’s then newly burst bubble economy and reform old-style politics. And yes, he too had a youthful, blow-dried haircut. Hosokawa bolted from the LDP, cobbled together a coalition and became Prime Minister with Koizumi-like approval ratings. True to his word, he opened the protected rice market and introduced campaign-finance reform. But a minor scandal and an unwieldy coalition deflated Hosokawa. Eight months later, he resigned.\n\nToday, Hosokawa spends most of his time making clay pots in his studio in Atami, a beachside city 100 km south of Tokyo. “I tried to break the system from the outside,” he said recently in an interview at his home. “Koizumi is trying to do it from the inside.” Now 63, the former Prime Minister concedes he bit off more than he could chew. “I look back and realize how strong this system is, how very deeply rooted in Japanese culture it is,” he says. But he betrays no bitterness toward his adversaries or regrets about his all-too-brief run of power. “If we hadn’t done what we did, Koizumi couldn’t exist now.”\n\nAfter his stint in Fukuda’s office, Koizumi took another stab at his father’s seat in 1972, and won. By now, he was a more self-confident public speaker and was learning to shed his congenital aloofness, at least when on the campaign trail. “He started to get more comfortable with the public side of politics, and was sounding more like his father,” says Teruo Nakagomi, an old family friend. (Nakagomi, a barber, is the man who gave Koizumi his trademark haircut.)\n\nThe tight-knit core of advisers who would guide him for three decades was already in place, led by his elder sister, Nobuko, who ran his Diet office; his younger brother, Masaya, who runs his Yokosuka home office; and Iijima, the political operative who takes care of his media and campaign strategies. What Koizumi lacked was the vital player in every politician’s entourage: there was no Mrs. Koizumi. In 1977, the inner circle presented him with dozens of photos of potential spouses, which he stacked high on his parliamentary office desk. The one that caught his eye was of a kimono-clad beauty, a 21-year-old university student named Kayoko Miyamoto. Her family was from Kamakura, an upper-class town of bamboo-shaded temples and hydrangea gardens, not far from Yokosuka, in Koizumi’s legislative district. Her grandfather had founded a large pharmaceutical company, and she grew up in a wealthy, though not ostentatious, environment. On their first date, Koizumi and Miyamoto dined at a French restaurant in Akasaka, a high-rent nightclub district favored by Japanese pols. The next day, Koizumi proposed marriage. She accepted. Problem solved.\n\nSix months later, they were wed in a large ceremony at the Tokyo Prince Hotel, with 2,500 guests, many of them constituents of Koizumi’s bused in from Yokosuka. His political mentor, Fukuda, was Prime Minister at the time, and he and his wife flanked the wedding couple, toasting them before a big cake shaped like the granite, fortress-like Diet building. Miyamoto moved in with the Koizumi family in their large, yet modest, two-story home in Yokosuka, where she was expected to cook meals and clean not only for her husband, but also for his mother and his sisters. This is not unusual in Japan, where the wife of the eldest son typically moves in with the extended family. But she was also expected to campaign. “Sometimes there would be 1,000 people, and they would show me to a stage to make a speech,” she recalls. “The first time I had to speak, I was so nervous I started to cry.” Within three years, Miyamoto had given birth to two sons. “My life was like this: campaign, have baby, campaign, have baby,” she says. It wasn’t to last.\n\nAfter four-and-a-half years of marriage, the couple divorced. Koizumi has never talked publicly about what happened, and Miyamoto remains discrete, saying only that it was a “situation between a husband and wife.” The one person who will talk about the divorce is Koizumi’s longtime aide, Iijima. “It was a political decision to end the marriage,” he says. Iijima claims Miyamoto simply didn’t cut it as a political wife. “If you marry a politician in Japan, you can either stay home and be a good wife, or if you want to get involved in the political life, you have to be committed.” At first, Iijima says, Miyamoto played the part, but she soon wanted out. “Supporters work for him 24 hours a day,” says Iijima, “and then there is this wife who comes in and leaves whenever she likes. It was completely disrespectful to his supporters. I told Koizumi: ‘Choose between your family and your political career.’ It was decided that they would divorce.” Koizumi got custody of their two sons; as is common practice in a Japanese divorce, the boys have never since seen or spoken to their mother. Miyamoto, pregnant at the time of the divorce, has a third sonwhom Koizumi has never tried to meet. Touchy-feely? Not in his private life, he isn’t.\n\nThat ruthless streak will come in handy as Koizumi pursues his ambition to destroy old Japan. His ideological role model is Margaret Thatcher, the former British Prime Minister, whom he escorted around the Diet when she visited Japan back in the 1980s. Her mantras are his: privatize, cut government spending and stop mollycoddling loser companies. It’s the opposite of his predecessors’ prescription for Japan’s woes. They spent more than $1 trillion over the past decade trying to rev up the moribund economy; Koizumi has promised to end this profligate spending, starting with a 10% cut in next year’s budget, and to shift funding from old-style, pork-barrel projectsbuilding unnecessary roads, bridges, airportsto things like education, job training, information technology, environmental cleanup. At the same time, Koizumi wants to privatize, or destroy, state-owned companies and begin to sweep away the bad debts that burden Japan’s tottering banks.\n\nThis master plan, if carried out to its logical conclusion, will yield a special bonus for Koizumi: it will end patronage politics, and effectively destroy the traditional LDP. That’s exactly why the Old Guard will resist his reforms. It’s a matter of survival. For now, they’re playing their cards close to the chest. Their few attempts at publicly berating Koizumi have backfired; those who dared have been inundated with hate mail and nasty phone calls. Instead, they’re poised to start chipping away at Koizumi’s program. Already, the bureaucrats, many of them allied with the conservatives, have resisted going along with Koizumi’s plan to privatize dozens of state-controlled corporations. The Establishment has pushed for another stimulus package this year. They complain that curbing government spending could push a deflationary economy over the edge. When Koizumi’s ratings start to fall, which they surely will, they will turn up the heat and wait for his fragile power base of mass appeal and political outsiders to crumble.\n\nTherein lies the Prime Minister’s dilemma. To push through his agenda and crush his political enemies, he must retain his only weapon, his popularity. To do that, he has to ensure that the economy doesn’t deteriorate any further, alienating his supporters. And yet, as he has himself predicted, reforms probably will make things worse. If you were Junichiro Koizumi, about now you’d be wishing your prophesies turn out just plain wrong."
