About the temple

It is also referred to as Keshava, Kesava or Vijayanarayana Temple.

Chennakesava is a form of the Hindu god Vishnu.

It is reverentially described in mediaeval Hindu texts, and remains an important pilgrimage site in Vaishnavism.

It was commissioned by King Vishnuvardhana in 1117 CE, on the banks of the Yagachi River.
