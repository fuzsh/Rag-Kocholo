The Chennakeshava Temple, located in Belur, Karnataka, is a testament to the Hoysala dynasty’s architectural brilliance and cultural richness.

Historical Background Of Chennakeshava Temple

King Vishnuvardhana commissioned the temple to commemorate his victory over the Cholas. Construction began in 1117 CE and lasted over a century, involving contributions from successive rulers. The Hoysala empire, renowned for its patronage of art and architecture, saw the temple as a symbol of its power and devotion. Despite suffering damage during invasions, particularly by Malik Kafur in the 14th century, the Vijayanagara Empire restored and maintained the temple.

The temple complex continued to expand over 100 years with contributions from various rulers. Notable contributions include the construction of the Chennigaraya temple by Queen Shantaladevi and additional structures for the temple’s maintenance by Narasimha I and Ballala II​​. The Vijayanagara Empire added several new features, including granite pillars and a seven-story gopuram​​.
