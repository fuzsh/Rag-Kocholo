        "text": "‎‎‎‎ ‎‎As a fan of architecture, I have enjoyed writing blogs on this platform about many forgotten architectural wonders of medieval period. But this time I’m writing about a very recently built, modern art which has raised to stardom in very short time frame with its amazing stature and scenic location. This is a place where human creativity meets the mighty artistry of mother nature. This is a place where even the lord of destruction seems to enjoy serenity, this is Azhimala Shiva Temple. A small temple on the southern coast of Kovalam beach, oozing divinity on a stunning seashore through a breath-taking grandeur of Sri Gangadhareshwara Statue.\n\nLocation: Azhimala is a small hamlet located in the Vizhinjam region on Kerala state capital Thiruvananthapuram. Though it’s a small coastal area it has got good connectivity through public transport with good roads.\n\nWhile on public transport, Thiruvananthapuram is the nearest town with bus, rail and flight connectivity. From there, one can take a bus towards Kovalam which runs frequently and get down at Kovalam or Balaramapuram. From Balaramapuram it’s a 5min ride on auto rickshaw right to the temple.\n\nOn your own vehicle, travel further south from Thiruvananthapuram for 25KMs on SH66 to reach Balaramapuram. With left deviation at Balaramapuram it’s a drive on 2.5KMs to reach the temple and beach. Parking facility available for LMVs & HMVs in temple premises.\n\nAzhimala Shiva Temple: The ancient temple on picturesque backdrops of verdant blues and greens, enjoys rich history of 1200 years. Having said to be built in 8th century during the Pandya’s rule, the place was once considered to be a major hub of Shaivism. Temple’s architecture captures your sight showcasing a splendid amalgamation of the traditional Kerala style and the Dravidian style, blended in perfect harmony.\n\nWhile temple walls and gopuram have been reinstated and repainted making it look lot newer structure, centuries old intricate carvings depicting the stories of Hindu mythology have been preserved in temple’s sanctorum. These carvings are a testament to the artistic excellence of the artisans from the past and serve as a visual representation of the temple’s rich cultural heritage. One of the most interesting features of the temple is a natural spring that flows through it. The water is believed to have healing properties, and many people come to temple to take a dip in the spring’s refreshing waters.\n\nSri Gangadhareshwara Statue: Even with a historic significance, the charm of Azhimala temple revolves around mighty statue of Sri Gangadhareshwara. As you approach the temple, an impressive 58 feet tall statue’s towering presence beholds your attention. Lord Shiva, in the form of Gangadhara, sits on a rock in the backgrounds of roaring seashore with his hair windswept and Maa Ganga on his head lending a magnificent appeal to the entire scene. The sheer grandeur and majesty of the statue leave visitors in awe and inspire a sense of reverence and devotion towards Lord Shiva.\n\nThe fame of building this marvellous piece of sculpture goes to Devaduttan, a local architect from Thiruvananthapuram. It took nearly 6 years to complete this structure. One has to agree that meticulous planning and intellect is invested in bringing this grandeur plan into reality. Constructed about 20 feet above sea bed, topography and climate of the place is thoroughly analysed. As a result, the statue is just not aesthetically pleasing but stands as a solid engineering structure!\n\nThis statue stands as a true embodiment of the raw, primal character of Lord Shiva, as described in our puranas. Maa Ganga, the goddess of the river, is depicted as being trapped in Shiva’s matted hair, which seems to be gently swaying in the sea breeze while he sits nonchalantly with a serene smile on his face. The handsome muscular body is covered with nothing but tiger skin while he adorns himself with the sacred rudraksha beads on his neck and arms. The trident he holds symbolizes his control over the three aspects of existence – creation, preservation, and destruction. In a word, the sight of this statue is as powerful as Shiva himself.\n\nA rush of blood through your veins is guaranteed when you stand in front of this majestic structure. If the raw beauty of Shiva isn’t just enough there is a thunderous sea in the background. And just like Shiva, the place holds a sense of calmness on a rough edge. Evenings, in particular, can be an incredibly soothing experience for one’s mind and soul, as the tranquil ambiance of the temple and the stunning view of the sea come together to create an atmosphere of peace and serenity.\n\nAs the sun begins to dip below the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow across the sky, the sea stretches out before you like a vast, shimmering canvas. In the midst of this tranquil scene, the majestic statue of Shiva form a silhouette against the brilliant hues of the sunset. Shiva’s four arms are outstretched, his hands holding a trident, a drum and Goddess Ganga, symbols his power and mastery over the various elements of universe.\n\nAnd right after the sunset, the skies glow with twilight, making the sea to spread that glow on land. Standing there, bathed in the warmth of fading light, it is easy to feel a sense of wonder and awe at the natural beauty of the world, and to feel a deep connection to the timeless power of the divine.\n\nVisiting Timings: Temple visiting timings to offer pooja and sevas are from 5.30 AM to 11.00 AM and from 5.00 PM to 8.00 PM. Anyhow, the temple main entry remains open through out the day along with access to Sri Gangadhareshwara Statue.\n\nBest time to visit: Temple is good to be visited through out the year. But visiting during post monsoon and winter months can make your journey much satisfactory as the beaches are clean and weather is pleasant.\n\nTo the temple, it is best advised to visit during sunrise or sunset to enjoy serenity of the place to its fullest.\n\nNearby Places to Visit: Are there any good places to visit nearby? What do you think? Its Kerala! Every part of it is a treat. Here are few good places nearby.\n\nKovalam Beach: This popular beach destination of Kerala is just a short drive from the Azhimala Shiva Temple. It’s a great place to relax, sunbathe, and enjoy the sea breeze.\n\nVizhinjam Fishing Harbour: Located about 5 km from the temple, this fishing harbour is a fascinating place to observe the local fishing industry in action.\n\nPadmanabhapuram Palace: This magnificent palace complex is located about 40 km from the temple, and is one of the most impressive examples of traditional Keralan architecture.\n\nNeyyar Dam: This scenic dam is located about 20 km from the temple, and is a popular spot for picnicking, boating, and wildlife watching.\n\nPoovar Island: This picturesque island is located about 25 km from the temple, and is accessible by boat. It’s a great place to relax on the beach, take a stroll through the mangrove forests, and even go on a backwater cruise.\n\nTake away: There is Sea, there is Shiva & there is Solace what else does a human soul require? The blend of raw beauty to the calmness of shiva shall put your heart to satisfaction anytime.\n\nAs you gaze out at the vast expanse of sea, you can feel the stresses and worries of everyday life melting away, replaced by a sense of calm and serenity. The sound of waves and gentle rustle of the palm trees overhead create a soothing rhythm that lulls you into a state of deep relaxation."
