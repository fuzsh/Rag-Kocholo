        "text": "Somanathapura, the town was founded by a general named Somanatha Dandanayaka in the 13 century, while he was in the service of Hoysala King Narasimha III. After that, he sought the king's permission and granted lands and resources to Brahmins to build and maintain the temples in the town, Somanathapura (known after the name of the patron). In the heart of this new town, General Somanatha built the Kesava temple and consecrated it in 1258 CE. Additionally, several other Hoysala style temples were also built in the city but all these except the Lakshmi Narasimha temple has disappeared or are in ruins after the wars between the Hindu kingdoms and Muslim sultanates ravaged the region.\n\nAccording to inscriptions, the Chennakesava Temple also suffered huge damage due to the war in the 14th century but was repaired a century later by the grants and financial aid given by the Vijayanagara Empire kings. The difference in the color of stones and quality of work in the verandah and some parts of the northern tower and platform of the main temple is the evidence of these repairs. Once again, the beautiful temple suffered another bout of damage in the 19th century and was again repaired in the early 20th century by the colonial era Mysore government.\n\nThis intricately carved and tastefully architectured temple was built in the 13 century on the banks of the beautiful river Kaveri. Unique and beautiful Hoysala architecture is one of the many features of the place that has made it famous all around the world. The whole temple complex, its gates, mandap and inscription stones are carved out of soapstone that enabled the artists to carve out the beautifully intricate artwork.\n\nOutside\n\nThe Chennakesava Temple is enclosed in a walled courtyard that has the ornate main gate or Mahadwar. Outside this Mahadwar stands a tall pillar having a statue of the Garuda on top, that was considered as Lord Vishnu's vaahan (vehicle). The Garuda statue is now missing. As one enters from the Mahadwar, an open public courtyard, with the main three-towered temple in the centre, comes into view. The walls of the courtyard are frames a rectangular verandah with an array of 64 shrines.\n\nMain Temple\n\nThe main temple is built on a jagati, symbolizing a worldly platform, with the idol of Lord Vishnu on top. It is about 3 feet high and is shaped in the form of a star with stairs for climbing up on the east end. Near the stairs are the shrines of two dwarpals (gatekeepers), which are now damaged. Around the jagati is a narrow pradakshina patha (circumambulation path). While doing the parikrama, one can read pictorial stories of Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavata Purana legends in the correct sequence.\n\nOuter Walls\n\nThe outer walls of the Somanathapura Temple have horizontal patches of artwork carved into them divided into three major sections. The lowest section showcase a row of elephants, marching in the clockwise direction. Above the elephants is a row of armed riders mounted on horses or camels. The band further above represents flowers, fruits and occasionally some peacocks and wildlife. Another band above it is the mythology frieze depicts the legends and spiritual capturing stories found in the Ramayana, the Bhagavata Purana and Mahabharata. The upper level of the wall has nearly 200 relief carving showing the life of the people. Most of them are defaced or damaged. Apart from that, there are various other carvings of deities, predominantly Vishnu in his various aspects and avatars.\n\nNavranga\n\nAs one enters the wooden door to the inside of the temple, there is a Navranga with its usual nine squares as mentioned in ancient Hindu texts. There are three ankanas and jagali platforms for the visiting devotees to sit. The interior here and the Navranga suggests that the temple was designed per Panchayatana puja architecture found in Smarta Hindu tradition.\n\nPillars and Ceiling\n\nThe colossal mandap hall is supported by various posts. The four centre pillars portray common life themes stacked in sequence: disc, bell, pot, wheel and umbrella. The four central square pillars yakshas and brackets that are either damaged or have disappeared. Two other pillars on the east are in the shape of 32 pointed stars."
