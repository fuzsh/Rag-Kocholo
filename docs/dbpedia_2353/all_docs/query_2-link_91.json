        "text": "Hey guys, Today I am going to show you some solid evidence of ancient technology in Chennakeshava Temple. When you see this, you immediately realize that it is not possible to make this without advanced technology. We can see a complex set of gear like structures on this pillar. I have already shown you smooth lathe turned pillars, which look like this, but the pillars I am showing you today are even more complicated. And we can make these pillars only by using advanced lathe operations like Milling, Chamfering, knurling and Gear Cutting. Archeologists agree that these pillars can be made only using lathe machining technology, but they also confirm that these pillars are at least 900 years old. But we are not going to question HOW ancient builders made these pillars 900 years ago. But we are going to look at WHY? Why did they make these complex pillars?\n\nBut, are they just pillars? What do I mean by this? A pillar, by definition is a supporting structure for a monument. But are these pillars just supporting structures? Or were they made for a different purpose?\n\nLet us examine these 4 pillars in a row. We are only going to focus on the ring like structures at the top of these pillars, where the light is shined. Listen to what the tour guide says.\n\nSo, the ring on the first pillar has 8 sides, the ring on the second pillar has 16 sides, the third ring has 32 sides and the fourth has 64 sides. These are not rings but are gears with a gear ratio of 1:2:4:8, I mean what is going on here? So, were these 4 pillars aligned with this specific ratio, by accident? The probability of having 4 pillars in one row, with such exact ratio is nearly zero. But these are just carvings on a solid stone pillar, they cannot rotate, right? No, according to archeologists, these pillars are not made of one stone, in fact each ring, is a separate stone ring, that can be rotated. I have already shown you the rotating ring in another temple, just 150 miles away. So, the rings in Chennakeshava temple must also be rotatable, but they are not rings at all. They are Gears. Yes, they are actual, rotatable Gears and when they are all connected to by a Belt or a Chain, each gear will rotate at a different speed, this is why these gears are in this 1:2:4:8 ratio.\n\nToday, we use the same technology in many machines, like a bicycle, there is a smaller gear with x number of teeth, connected to a larger gear with 2x number of teeth and we use this mechanism by just connecting the gears with a chain.\n\nBut did ancient builders use chains to connect these gears? If so, can we find some evidence of it, in the same temple? Just above one of these pillars in the Chennakeshava temple, we can see a strange figure, and it is holding a connecting chain. What is remarkable is that, we can see the details of this chain very clearly, it is not just similar, it is almost identical to a modern-day connecting chain, or a toothed belt. Today, we use the exact same technology to connect multiple gears. More interestingly, experts confirm that, yes, this carving is also at least 900 years old. So, there is no doubt that ancient builders were using chains or toothed belt to connect these gears on these pillars. And each gear would have rotated at a different speed, for some scientific purpose. In fact, there is a specific name for this mechanism today, it is called a timing belt and pulley system, and we use it for a variety of purposes.\n\nBut the rotation is not only limited to the top gears, other parts of the pillars would also be rotatable. I have already shown you the ancient rotating pillar in the same temple, which was completely rotating from top to bottom, like a giant spindle or shaft. Archeologists confirm that each of these pillars is not made of single stone, but every pillar is made of 5 different parts and assembled like a machine.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at this pillar. The connecting chain or toothed belt will perfectly fit on these depressions and bumps, this was done specifically so that the chain will not slip on this surface. If they had used a smooth, circular groove like a regular smooth pulley, the chain will slip, so the design was carefully planned and executed. This explains why such complex pillars were made using lathe technology and then installed in this temple, because their primary function is not to support the structure, they were used for some other purpose. This must all be rotated together to perform some important function.\n\nBut do we find only carvings of chains? Or do we find evidences of other devices and tools? On top of every pillar, we can see carvings of ancient builders supporting the temple. They are shown holding the ceiling, symbolically supporting the temple, but they are also shown holding other devices and tools.\n\nHere is a strange figure on top of the rotating pillar. The tour guide says this is lord Vishnu, holding a chakra in one hand and a conch in the other hand. But this doesn’t look like a chakra, this doesn’t look like a conch and Vishnu is not a woman, so this explanation is wrong! What is she actually holding? On her right hand, she is holding a tool like a modern-day ratchet wrench, we can clearly see the circular hole in the centre. Today we use the ratchet wrench for many purposes and on the other hand, we can see a tool very similar to countersink drill bit.\n\nThe same tools are shown as a combo in another carving. On one end we can see the hole, it looks exactly like today’s advanced ratchet wrench. On the other side, there is a sharp pointed end, looking very similar to modern day drill bits. Of course, you can argue that this is pointless, you can say there is no such tool today, but I am sure we will develop such combination tools in the next 10 years. I mean think about it, we are only able to understand these carvings as useful tools, because we have invented the chain and ratchet wrench in the last 100 years, people who saw these carvings 100 years ago, would have just dismissed them as flowers or weapons, because most humans lack the imagination to see what things can be.\n\nBut why would they need such drilling tools? What were they drilling? There are hidden details in these pillars, you may marvel at these extraordinary pillars, but what about these patterns? They seem easily doable, right? No, these are not 2d etchings on the face of the pillar, these are 3d projections, even better, there are holes in between. I am struggling to show you these holes because there is no light here, and it is very dark, but when I put my finger through, you can see that my finger comes out here. Without drilling and engraving tools, you cannot make these kinds of fantastic patterns. Why would they put these intricate holes on this pillar, in a dark corner where no one can see them? This is like putting the painting of Monalisa in the dark basement of the Louvre Museum.\n\nBut this gets even better, some holes are so small, even your little finger won’t go in, only rays of light can pass through, you can only see them when you use a flashlight, you can see light, shining through these tiny holes.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that today, even with a modern drilling machine, you cannot make these holes. You cannot access these locations using a regular drilling machine like this one. If we have to make holes in these difficult locations, we have to use an advanced connecting device called a flexible shaft, this is basically a small flexible device that connects to the drill bit, and then we will be able to put holes in these inaccessible locations.\n\nBut remarkably, there is a carving in the Chennakeshava temple that also shows the exact same features. In one hand, we can clearly see the flexible shaft, see how it is shown as a twisted shaft, and what is even more strange is the tool in the other hand, there is even a drill bit, with a pointed top, and a long base, just like a modern drill bit. Did ancient builders use flexible drilling technology? If not, what does this carving show? More importantly, how did they make these tiny holes in these impossible locations?\n\nBut there are strange stories about the Mohini carvings in this temple. I have already told you about the Mohini statue outside and its connection to gravity. But some people tell an even more fantastic story about this Mohini, located inside the temple.\n\nAccording to them, this temple has at least 10,000 carvings and several other thousands of stone blocks. But not even a trace of binding material has been used to connect any two blocks in the ceiling or the walls. This means originally, there was no cement, no mortar or any type of glue used to build this temple. Yet, no one can dismantle the Gods, the Giant Madhanika statues, the ceiling and the pillars, unless we have this Mohini’s permission. But how is a stone Mohini going to speak and give us permission to dismantle the stone blocks? According to some, she will not speak, but her left foot will magically touch the ground, which is the signal or permission to dismantle the blocks.\n\nThis story seems quite fantastic, right? You can see the Mohini’s legs are roughly about 2 feet high from the ground level, so how can the Mohini’s left foot, magically come down and touch the ground? This seems like a meaningless old folklore, with no logic. But look below, at her left foot, it is deliberately carved hanging outside, as though she wants to touch the ground. Now, look above, do you see these slots on the top of the pillar? Yes, these rectangular slots are all evenly cut on the rotating gear.\n\nThis is a Screw Jack system, where you can insert levers in these slots, and rotate this stone block. Think about what you do when you have a flat tire, you insert levers in the slots of the jack and rotate it, to raise or lower the car. The rotating motion will be converted into linear motion, making the car move up or down. This system can be easily achieved by using just a few gears in combination. Look at how the Mohini is connected to the pillar, it is actually externally mounted on the pillar, and must be able to move up or down, if the gear on top is rotated. Once the Mohini’s left foot touches the ground, maybe it unlocks the joints of the nearby stone blocks, and then we may be able to slowly dismantle the entire temple, piece by piece, by removing the interlocked stone blocks.\n\nSo, we can clearly see there are so many evidences of advanced technology in this temple. The Gear Ratio of 1:2:4:8 in the pillars, the rotating nature of the gears, the connecting chain or belt depicted by ancient builders, other tools that are similar to modern tools, very advanced drilling technology, screw jack system and many other details. So, what do you think? Did ancient builders use advanced Machining technology? How else can we explain all these evidences?\n\n–Praveen Mohan"
