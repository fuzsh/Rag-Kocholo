        "text": "1. The Chennakeshava Temple\n\nThe Channakeshava temple is one of the most sought after tourist attraction in Belur. This grand temple is dedicated to Lord Vijayanarayana, who is considered to be one of the 24 incarnations of Lord Vishnu. It was built in the 12th century by Vishnuvardhana, the then Hoysala king, as a way to celebrate their victory over the Cholas in the battle of Talakad. The temple is adorned with beautiful sculptures and carvings that portray celestial nymphs and a few scenes from the Upanishads, Mahabharata and Ramayana.\n\n2. Madanikas\n\nIn different corners of the Channakeshava temple, 42 Madanikas or Celestial Nymphs are carved out of soapstone. It is said that Shantala Devi, Queen of Vishnuvardhana inspired these intricate carvings and depict the different postures of Bharatnatyam.\n\n3. Veeranarayana Temple\n\nDedicated to Veeranarayana or Lakshmi Narayana, another name for Vishnu, this Vaishnava temple is famous for its artistic interiors. This trikuta or three-shrined temple was built by King Veera Ballala II of the Hoysala dynasty and depicts the various forms and avatars of Lord Vishnu. The central shrine is a great image of Narayana with four hands, the southern shrine is a big image of Venugopala (Krishna playing the flute), and the northern shrine is a tall image of Yoganarasimha.\n\n4. The Gravity Pillar\n\nThe emergence of the Vijayanagar dynasty has also had its effect on Belur, and especially on the Channakeshava temple. The Gravity Pillar, or more commonly called the Mahasthamba or Kartika Deepotsava Sthamba is a 42 feet tall pillar installed during the reign of King Devaraya in 1414. What makes this granite pillar so unique is the fact that the post stands without a base to it. It is made of a single stone and stands on a stone platform, held there by gravity.\n\n5. Kappe Chennigaraya Temple\n\nErected by Shantala Devi during the Hoysala period, this small temple is located in the Veeranarayana Temple complex, to the south of the Channakeshava temple. The interiors of the temple are striking with beautiful sculptures and carvings. Other than this, there are other shrines dedicated to Veeranarayana, Ranganayaki, Bhoodevi, Sridevi and Soumyanayaki situated in the temple premises.\n\n6. Vishnu Samudra\n\nThe Big Tank, or in other words, widespread among the locals as Vishnu Samudra, was constructed during the reign of Narasimha Raya. After the Vijayanagar Empire took over, Basappa Nayaka built the north end of the quadrangle and added steps on all the three sides of the tank. The water from this tank is still used in the temple rituals.\n\nBelur is a town packed with great architectural wonder, displaying some exclusive carving and sculpture works. Built in typical Dravidian style architecture, the intricacy with which the architectures here are built is splendid. The Chennakesava temple is one of the classic examples of Hoysala architecture. The entire facade of the temple is covered with detailed stonework such that no portion is left blank.\n\nSculptures of birds, elephants, lions, horses and other animals can also be seen. Apart from that, you will be fascinated with intricate carvings on the temple that depicts the scenes from the Mahabharata, Ramayana and the Upanishadas. The sculptures inside the temple are built using ivory and sandalwood. With its delicate carving and stunning sculptures, the Belur temples are often compared with those at Khajuraho. Belur along with its twin town Halebid once served as a capital of Hoysalas and Shravanabelagola, form the Golden Triangle of Karnataka Tourism.\n\nKappe Chennigaraya temple which was built by Shantaladevi is also situated in Belur. It is said that Shantaladevi herself danced in front of the main shrine during its installation and her dance-inspired the figurines that adorn the temple walls. Two more temples are situated in the complex along with the Pushkarni or stepwell, which are astonishing architectures in their own right.\n\nHoysalas were a hill tribe hailing from the Western Ghats and served as in charge of Chalukyas' land ownings. The rose in their ranks under Tinayaditya who became a prominent leader during the period ranging from 1047 - 1078. Erstwhile known as Velapuri, Belur along with Halebid was once the centre of the vast empire ruled by the Hoysalas during the 12th century. The greater ruler that came to be in the Hoysala Dynasty was Vishnuvardhana, the capital was shifted to Halebid. After the invasion by Delhi Sultanate, Belur became the second capital of the Hoysala Empire. The remarkable temples of the place are believed to be constructed to mark the victory of King Vishnuvardhana over Cholas in 1117 and took about 103 years to complete."
