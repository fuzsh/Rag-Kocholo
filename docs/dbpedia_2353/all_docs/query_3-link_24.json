        "text": "The Hoysala empire is named after a legend from Kannada folklore, which narrates the tale of a brave young man named Sala who courageously defeated a lion (or tiger) to protect his Master Sudatta. In Kannada language, “Hoy, Sala” translates to “Strike Sala,” which eventually became the moniker of the dynasty he established. This heroic event is symbolized in the emblem of the Hoysala empire. Visitors are greeted by a statue depicting Sala’s battle with the lion at the entrance of the Chennakesava temple in Belur.\n\nThe construction of the temple took place under the reign of Vishnuvardhana from the Hoysala dynasty in the 12th century AD. As per the myth, the main architects of Chennakeshava Temple were ‘Amarashilpi Jakanacharya’ and his son ‘Dankanacharya’. For more information on the history of Belur & Halebid, please refer to my comprehensive article by clicking here.\n\nThe Chennakesava temple is renowned for its intricate carvings, sculptures, and motifs that embellish the outer walls. Among these, the most famous and exquisite are the 42 well-crafted bracket figures known as Madanikas (Chaste Maidens or Salabhanjikas). While 38 of these figures are positioned outside the temple, the remaining 4 can be admired within its sacred walls.\n\nShantala Devi, the Queen of Vishnuvardhana, was celebrated for her unparalleled beauty, serving as the inspiration for the Madanika sculptures. She excelled in music and BharatNatyam dance, each Madanika statue embodies a BharatNatyam stance with intricate details of attire, cosmetics, and jewelry. It is important to highlight that the Queen exhibited a remarkable level of freedom of expression in the conservative society of that era.\n\nPlease take a moment to appreciate these exceptional works of art. I possess a vast array of intricate visuals that are suitable for commercial purposes. Should you be interested in obtaining a license for these high-quality images, please feel free to reach out to me.\n\nDarpana Sundari (Lady with the mirror) is distinguished among all the Madanikas for its exquisite beauty and flawless perfection. Upon closer examination of her anatomy, proportions, and features, it becomes evident that this sculpture is truly a masterpiece of art.\n\nThe Mohini statue, showcasing an impeccable dance pose, exemplifies the exquisite craftsmanship of the Hoysala dynasty. Crafted with precise symmetry, a drop of water falling from the extended right hand above her head would gracefully touch her nose, left breast, left hand tip, and eventually land on the toe of her left foot.\n\nThe exceptional beauty and quality of these intrinsic works of art have earned them the title ‘Poetry in Stone’. Several of these sculptures are so realistic that it is difficult to believe they were actually carved from stone.\n\nThe soapstone (steatite or talc-schist) used to carve these masterpieces provides them with an exceptional finish. Unlike granite or marble, the soft nature of soapstone allows it to be shaped even with our fingernails. When it comes to pillars, instead of the typical hammer and chiseling process with stones, they were crafted using lathe turning or scraping motion of the tools. A touch of polishing with oil would bring out a lifelike appearance in them.\n\nThe Madanikas have been named based on their postures viz., Darpana sundari (Lady with mirror), Shuka sundari (Lady with parrot), Vasantha sundari, Sundari and Kapi (Lady with monkey), Bedithi, Keshabandha, Adhbhuta Nritya, Durga Nritya, Davane Nritya, Venuvadana (Flutist), Geethe, Mohini Nritya, Rudraveenadhari, Keshapasha, Parnashabari, Poornamohini Nritya, Vrishchika Mattu Yuvathi, Dwibhuja Sharada, Vyajana Nritya, Nagaveena, Lasya Nritya, Thribhangi Nritya, Kesha Shrungara, Gandharva Dance, Shantaladevi, Fortune teller, Songstress, Arch dancer, Lady with make-up, Kite dancer, Pony-tale haired lady, Drum dance, Nagaveena Dance, Gypsy girl, Bhasma Mohini dance, Huntress, Divine Dancer, Masculine woman, Violinist, Bewitching beauty, Musician, etc.\n\nThe Hoysala artisans were known for their practice of leaving inscriptions on their works, providing valuable information about their lives, families, and more. Stone and copper plate inscriptions have revealed that over 40 sculptures were crafted by Ruvari Mallitamma. Additionally, craftsmen like Dasoja and his son Chavana from Balligavi were responsible for creating multiple Madanikas. Malliyanna and Nagoja specialized in crafting animals and birds, while Chikkahampa and Padari Malloja were credited with some temple sculptures. Other names mentioned include Masada and Nagoja. Further investigation confirmed that the construction was meticulously supervised, following strict project planning and coordination.\n\nKing Vishnuvardhana and Queen Shantala initially followed Jainism, but later converted to Hinduism and became devoted Vaishnavites. Unfortunately, Queen Shantala tragically took her own life by leaping from a hill due to her inability to conceive a child.\n\nThe Hoysala Empire exerted its influence over the Deccan Plateau area in Southern India from the 10th to the 14th centuries. During this time, they crafted a unique architectural style and constructed numerous remarkable structures throughout their kingdom, leaving a lasting cultural legacy in the region. Many of these impressive architectural marvels can still be found in Karnataka, with the most notable ones listed below in chronological order:\n\nClick the name of a temple to go through a photo tour."
