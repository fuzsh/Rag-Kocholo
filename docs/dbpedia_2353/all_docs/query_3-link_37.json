The ancient temple has been renovated several times, especially leaving imprints of 16th and 19th centuries. The temple stands on a small hill accessed by 50 plus steps, with heavily sculptured walls that cocoon the sanctum with the main Krishna idol. Around the complex lie other smaller shrines. The walls have intricately carved mythical characters and legends. The impressive 43 m high spire is topped with a flag made from 52 yards of cloth that flutters in the soft breeze from the Arabian Sea behind the temple. There are two doors (swarg and moksh) for the entry and exit of the temple. A bridge called Sudama Setu (7am‚Äì1pm, 4‚Äì7.30pm) at the base of the temple takes one across the Gomti creek towards the beach. Brief History: Dwarka on the western tip of the Kathiawar Peninsula is clubbed with the holiest sites in India ‚Äì the Char Dhams that include Badrinath, Puri and Rameshwaram. It is believed that Lord Krishna arrived here from Braj in Uttar Pradesh to build the city. The temple was established by his grandson. It is at the cusp of the Gomti River and the Arabian Sea, providing a scenic backdrop to the spiritual site. It is said that Dwarka was submerged under the sea six times and what we see now is its seventh avatar. The temple itself has a fascinating legend. Destroyed by Islamic Invader: The original structure was destroyed by Mahmud Begada in 1472, and subsequently rebuilt in the 15th-16th century. It was also feted by Adi Shankaracharya, the 8th century Hindu theologian and philosopher. Best time to visit: The best time to visit is between November and February, and during Janmashtami which is celebrated grandly here.

SOMNATH TEMPLE The Somanath temple (IAST: somanƒÅtha) or Deo Patan, is a Hindu temple located in Prabhas Patan, Veraval in Gujarat, India. It is one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus and is the first among the twelve jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva. It is unclear when the first version of the Somnath temple was built, with estimates varying between the early centuries of the 1st millennium and about the 9th century CE. The temple is not mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism as Somnath nomenclature, but the \"Prabhasa-Pattana\" (Prabhas Patan) is mentioned as a tirtha (pilgrimage site), where this temple exists.[4] For example, the Mahabharata in Chapters 109, 118, and 119 of Book 3 (Vana Parva), and Sections 10.45 and 10.78 of the Bhagavata Purana state Prabhasa to be a tirtha on the coastline of Saurashtra. The temple was reconstructed several times in the past after repeated destruction by multiple Muslim invaders and rulers, notably starting with an attack by Mahmud Ghazni in the 11th century. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, historians and archaeologists of the colonial era actively studied the Somnath temple because its ruins showed a historic Hindu temple that was turning into an Islamic mosque. After India's independence, those ruins were demolished, and the present Somnath temple was reconstructed in the MƒÅru-Gurjara style of Hindu temple architecture. The contemporary Somnath temple's reconstruction was started under the orders of the first Deputy Prime Minister of India, Vallabhbhai Patel after receiving approval for reconstruction from Mahatma Gandhi. The reconstruction was completed in May 1951, after his death. #beautiful Bharat has a rich #heritage.

These ancient temples, ranging from the majestic Brihadeeswara Temple in Tamil Nadu to the intricate Sun Temple in Odisha, reflect the devotion of the era, artistry, and creativity. The structure of a temple is an important step before taking the darshan of the deity in the garbhgriha. It helps align the thoughts of the devotee with the immense underlying information. However, most Indians visit the temples without being aware of the temple itself. Very few seem to be interested in looking at the temple and its surroundings. Ancient temples are institutions in itself, they educate people for many aspects of life. Temples have their expression; each temple element has a vocabulary and regional variety. If the temple is visited with complete awareness, it will surely add to the experiences of the devotees. This 2-day seminar will decode the meaning, concepts & thoughts behind the temples to develop a better understanding of the temples, sculptures and stories on the temple for their socio-cultural background. Most importantly, an underlying message of the temples put together which our ancestors have encapsulated in an architectural form. Do join us to learn more about our heritage!
