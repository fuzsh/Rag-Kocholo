        "text": "If there has ever been a weekend where my mind was occupied by the Kings, legends, myths of yester years – it has to be the last weekend.\n\nA long pending trip plan (plan laid out – I guess some 10 years ago atleast) with family came to fruition. We visited Belur, Halebidu & Shravanabelagola (all of them in Karnataka). These places are about 800-1200 years old. A time when I had not taken my first step into this world (bad luck… not legendary enough, yet. lacks the punch).\n\nI have been a big fan of history ever since I left school (seriously) & managed to find a love for these ancient remains a few years later (I remember well – it all started at Hyderabad from Golconda fort in the year 2005).\n\nBelur & Halebidu blew me away with their marvelous architecture & sculptures. The ancient temples at both these locations were constructed by the Hoysala Kings.\n\nThe Belur temple took 103 years to complete. I could hardly find a vacant space on the outer walls of the temple. Each inch of it was covered with some splendid sculptures. The details of which cannot be explained or captured in images – but needs to be felt and seen. The master sculpturers of these surely had a great understanding of their art.\n\nThe main deity at Belur is Lord Chennakeshava (handsome Vishnu – here Vishnu is prayed to in his female form: Mohini).\n\nShall post the pics of Halebidu on a different post. With immense pain I had to select these few pics from my vast collection of Belur pics (over 150).\n\nSome general info on Belur (videos taken during my earlier trip to Belur & pics taken during my recent visit).\n\nGopuram of Belur Temple (added later by Vijayanagar Kings)\n\nA Closer view of Temple Gopuram\n\nBelur Chennakeshava Temple\n\nThe Star shaped structure was a trademark of Hoysala Architecture\n\nEmblem of the Hoysala Kingdom\n\nKannada folklore tells of a young man, Sala, who saved his Jain guru Sudatta by striking dead a tiger he encountered near the temple of the Goddess Vasantika at Sosevur. The word “strike” literally translates to “hoy” in Hale Kannada (Old Kannada), hence the name “Hoy-sala”. This legend first appeared in the Belur inscription of Vishnuvardhana (1117), but owing to several inconsistencies in the Sala story it remains in the realm of folklore. The legend may have come into existence or gained popularity after King Vishnuvardhana’s victory over the Cholas at Talakad as the Hoysala emblem depicts the fight between the mythical Sala and a tiger, the emblem of the Cholas.\n\nPillar at Belur Temple – Supported on 3 points\n\nThe pillar is supported on 3 points. The 4th point doesn’t touch the ground.\n\nScience plays its role here – the center of gravity is such that the 3 points balance the pillar.\n\nIt is interesting to think of how this pillar was put up in the first place – about 800 years ago. And quite a good scientific method used to have the pillar built (monolithic structure) which ensures the center of gravity rests on 3 points.\n\nBellur – Pillar on 3 points (left – the corner in air)\n\nCarvings on one of the entrance to the main temple\n\nCarvings on another entrance to the temple\n\nCarvings on the ceiling of the main temple complex\n\n3 desired characteristics represented\n\nFrom the Bottom:\n\n=> Bala (Strength)\n\n=> Shourya (Vigor/Courage)\n\n=> Vega (Speed)\n\nKannada inscriptions in Hale Gannada (Old Kannada/Hale Kannada)\n\nInscription in Kannada\n\nDarpana Sundari – The Lady with the Mirror\n\nProbably the most famous shila-balika/sculpture at Belur. The intricate details in this sculpture is amazing – even the eyebrows & face of “this” – conveys the thoughts/feelings of the sculpture.\n\nDarpana Sundari\n\nHighly flexible – aint she (forgot the name of this sculpture)\n\nShilabalika at Belur\n\nTime plays its role – the Missing Legs\n\nOld is Gold\n\nThe carvings in front (right) were placed during the renovation carried out about 100 years ago; and the one behind (left) is the one carved out 800 years ago.\n\nYou know which of these carvings is of better quality – don’t you 🙂\n\nA scene from the Mahabharata – Arjuna at Draupadi’s Swayamvara\n\nPillar within the temple\n\nPillar within the temple – love the polished finish"
