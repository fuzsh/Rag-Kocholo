        "text": "India is replete with majestic ruins that are now heritage sites. Karnataka, the state I live in, is known for its gorgeous ruins — some other examples are Belur, Halebid, Lepakshi, etc.\n\nToday, I am taking you to the breathtakingly beautiful Chennakesava Temple in Somanathapura, Karnataka, India, built in the 13th century. Kesava is another name for Lord Vishnu.\n\nNow grab a coffee (or the beverage of your choice) and sit back for the story of this temple. This Vaishnava Hindu temple sits on the banks of River Cauvery and is protected under The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, of 1958.\n\nHere is the entrance to the temple — bounded by high stone walls. Little would you expect the sight inside.\n\nSomanathapura is a small village on the banks of the river Cauvery and about 130 kilometers from Bangalore which makes for a great day trip. This trip was a picnic from our condo. We hired a bus and about forty of us set off at 6 am in the morning with three destinations in mind.\n\nSomanathapura is best known for the Chennakesava Temple, a grand representation of the Hoysala architecture — built around 1258 A.D. Now, the Hoysala Empire is known for its grandeur as evidenced by the gorgeous temples at Belur and Halebid in Karnataka.\n\nSo anyway — the powerful King Narasimha III (1254–91 A.D.) ruled South India (fun fact: his full name is really a paragraph and I dare you to read it quickly! “Sri Vishnuvaradhana, Pratapa Chakravarti, Hoysala Bhujabala, Sri Vira Narasimha, Maharajadhiraja, Raja Paramesvara, Sanivarasiddhi, Giridurgamalla” etc.). Imagine how they must have announced his arrival! He ruled at the time when his army commander, Somnath built the Kesava temple.\n\nThis commander created a village and called it Somnathpur after himself. All this is written on a stone slab in the old Kannada script just inside the entrance of the temple. Look at the symmetry!\n\nThe temple stands on a raised platform and represents a “Universe” and there are scenes on the walls depicting Gods, Goddesses, animals, and lots more. The sculpture is unique and perfectly symmetrical. These are made of soapstone. The guide told us that they were carved on panels and then fitted together — interlocked — just like Lego. The detail in the carvings is stupendous and it takes more, much more than the four hours we spent gazing at the interiors and exteriors of the temple.\n\nI could go back and gaze at the sculptures all day. I might actually do that. I had a tough time picking photos to post. As it is, I think this may be an overload. What to do? I have more than two hundred to choose from. Sigh."
