Built over 100 years in the 11th Century, this Chennakesava Temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu. This splendid Chennakeshava temple was believed to have been built by King Vishnuvardhana and the Hoysalas to commemorate the victory of the Hoysalas over the Cholas in the battle of Talakadu.\n\nThe construction of this spectacular Chennakeshava temple was commenced in 1116 A.D. by the greatest ruler of this empire the Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana Raya, furthered by his son Narasimha Raya and later on completed by his grandson- Veera Ballala. The temple is active since its inception. The puja is performed every day in the morning and evening.\n\nThis incredible temple is famous for its architecture, sculptures, murals, unmatchable carvings as well as its iconography, inscriptions and history. The temple’s artwork depicts scenes of secular life in the 12th century, dancers and musicians and a pictorial narration of Hindu texts from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas through numerous friezes. The Chennakeshava temple in Belur is a testimony to the artistic, cultural and theological perspectives in 12th century South India and the Hoysala Empire rule. The Hoysala period began about 1000 CE and continued through 1346 CE. In this period, they built around 1,500 temples in 958 centres. Belur was the early capital of the Hoysala kings.

The bottom part of the temple has seven bands. The lowest band is carved with elephants depicting the strength for taking the weight of the entire temple structure. Intricately carved frescos on the outer wall of the main Chennakesava temple depicts the stories from Ramayana, Mahabharata, dancing women, stories of Lord Shiva – Parvati, Vishnu, Brahma, Ganesha, Goddess Durga, Ravana and many other murals way ahead of their time. The artistic skills of women dressing up, playing, dancing, musician, drummers and instrumentalists. The incredible creativity and imagination in creating themes, and stories with animals and birds is something one should not miss out on.\n\nIn the outer circle of the main temple, you will see massive footprints in a square box on the floor. It is believed to be that Vishu’s footprints were unearthed during the excavation. People believe in and pray there.\n\nThe Stepwell Tank or Vishnu Samudra\n\nInside the temple complex is a big stepwell water tank called Vishnu Samudra. The tank has the steps to reach the water source or Pushkarni for the devotees to use the sacred water for their daily offerings or prayers.\n\nDue to Covid protocols, the tank is temporarily closed for the public to reach the water. However, the top view is open.\n\nLORD VISHNU’S FOOTPRINT\n\nInterior of the temple\n\nThe temple has three entrances ornated with life-size beautifully carved sculptures of either women, dwarpalaks ( doorkeepers) or Ganeshas. The centre hall has an idol of Lord Vishnu where every morning and evening puja is offered. The hall has pillars and a ceiling carved to the precision. It surprises architects and mathematicians how it was possible to make something so unique in that era to that perfection without any knowledge of or applying any science to it. The beautifully carved square-shaped ceiling of the main temple is assisted with pillars. The intricate carvings on single stone pillars with animals, birds and other stories.\n\nBelur is an exquisite example of imagination, architecture, workmanship and craftsmanship of the bygone era.\n\nHow to reach\n\nBelur can be reached by road from its district headquarters Hassan.
