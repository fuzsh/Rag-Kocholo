OBITUARY OF MAGDALINE STEIGER

Mrs. Magdaline Steiger, formerly Anderegg, was born Oct. 1, 1854, in Bern, Switzerland.

In 1866 she and her parents came to this country where they settled near La Crosse. She was united in marriage with August Steiger March 17, 1883.

In 1884 they move to Kansas where they lived for seven years. From 1891 1896 they resided at La Crosse. Then they came to Clark County and lived for a year near Loyal. In 1897 they came into this community and at the same time joined the West Side Church, of which she was a loyal member until her death.

Deceased passed away Friday, June 22, 1928, at the ripe age of 73 years, 8 months and 21 days, after an illness of a few years.

She leaves to mourn her loss three sons, John of St. Paul, William of the town of Eaton and Edwin of the Town of Warner, also 8 grandchildren and one brother, Casper Anderegg of La Crosse, Wis. Her husband, one brother and one sister preceded her in death.

Deceased was of an affectionate disposition, bright and winning in her ways, so that friendship's circle was to her a very large one. Indeed, it may be said of her, that none knew her but to lover her. Among us all she ranked always as a woman of culture, refinement, sympathy, a kind neighbor and true friend.

Funeral services were held at the West Side Church Tuesday afternoon, Rev. O. Vriesen officiating. The body was laid to rest in the West Side Cemetery.
