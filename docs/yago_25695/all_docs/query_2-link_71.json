        "text": "Clinton Eastwood Jr. was born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, to Clinton Eastwood Sr., a bond salesman and later manufacturing executive for Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and Ruth Wood (née Margret Ruth Runner), a housewife turned IBM clerk. He grew up in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. In 1949, the year he is said to have graduated from high school, his parents and younger sister Jeanne moved to Seattle. Clint spent a couple years in the Pacific Northwest himself, operating log broncs in Springfield, Oregon, with summer gigs life-guarding in Renton, Washington. Returning to California in 1951, he did a two-year stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation and later enrolled at L.A. City College, but dropped out to pursue acting.\n\nDuring the mid-1950s he landed uncredited bit parts in such B-films as Die Rache des Ungeheuers (1955) and Tarantula (1955) while digging swimming pools and driving a garbage truck to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show Tausend Meilen Staub (1959) with Eric Fleming. Although only a secondary player the first seven seasons, he was promoted to series star when Fleming departed--both literally and figuratively--in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.\n\nEastwood's big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: Für eine Handvoll Dollar (1964), Für ein paar Dollar mehr (1965), and Zwei glorreiche Halunken (1966). The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with Enrico Maria Salerno providing the voice of Eastwood's character, finally getting American distribution in 1967-68. As the last film racked up respectable grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from a barely registering actor to sought-after commodity in just a matter of months. Again a success was the late-blooming star's first U.S.-made western, Hängt ihn höher (1968). He followed that up with the lead role in Coogans großer Bluff (1968) (the loose inspiration for the TV series Ein Sheriff in New York (1970)), before playing second fiddle to Richard Burton in the World War II epic Agenten sterben einsam (1968) and Lee Marvin in the bizarre musical Westwärts zieht der Wind (1969). In Ein Fressen für die Geier (1970) and Stoßtrupp Gold (1970), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.\n\n1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a sleazy Union soldier in Betrogen (1971) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller Sadistico (1971). His role as the hard edge police inspector in Dirty Harry (1971), meanwhile, boosted him to cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies thereafter: the westerns Sinola (1972), Ein Fremder ohne Namen (1973) and Der Texaner (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love Sondra Locke), the Dirty Harry sequels Calahan (1973) and Dirty Harry III - Der Unerbittliche (1976), the action-packed road adventures Die Letzten beißen die Hunde (1974) and Der Mann, der niemals aufgibt (1977), and the prison film Flucht von Alcatraz (1979). He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with Der Mann aus San Fernando (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, Im Auftrag des Drachen (1975) notwithstanding, the 1970s were nonstop success for Eastwood.\n\nEastwood kicked off the 1980s with Mit Vollgas nach San Fernando (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, Dirty Harry IV - Dirty Harry kommt zurück (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase: \"Make my day.\" He also starred in Bronco billy (1980), Firefox (1982), Der Wolf hetzt die Meute (1984), City Heat - Der Bulle und der Schnüffler (1984), Pale Rider - Der namenlose Reiter (1985) and Heartbreak Ridge (1986), all of which were solid hits, with Honkytonk Man (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988, he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, Das Todesspiel (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs like Pink Cadillac (1989) and Rookie - Der Anfänger (1990), it seemed Eastwood's star was declining as it never had before. He then started taking on low-key projects, directing Bird (1988), a biopic of Charlie Parker that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing Weißer Jäger, schwarzes Herz (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of John Huston (both films had a limited release).\n\nEastwood bounced back big time with his dark western Erbarmungslos (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in In the Line of Fire: Die zweite Chance (1993), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received Perfect World (1993) with Kevin Costner. Next was a love story, Die Brücken am Fluss (1995), where Eastwood surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than Meryl Streep. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. Absolute Power (1997) and Space Cowboys (2000) did well enough, while Ein wahres Verbrechen (1999) and Blood Work (2002) were received badly, as was Mitternacht im Garten von Gut und Böse (1997), which he directed but didn't appear in.\n\nEastwood surprised again in the mid-2000s, returning to the top of the A-list with Million Dollar Baby (2004). Also starring Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. His next starring vehicle, Gran Torino (2008), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, Back in the Game (2012), as well as a reality show, Mrs. Eastwood & Company (2012).\n\nBetween acting jobs, he chalked up an impressive list of credits behind the camera. He directed Mystic River (2003) (in which Sean Penn and Tim Robbins gave Oscar-winning performances), Flags of Our Fathers (2006), Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), Der fremde Sohn (2008) (a vehicle for Angelina Jolie), Invictus - Unbezwungen (2009) (again with Freeman), Hereafter - Das Leben danach (2010), J. Edgar (2011), Jersey Boys (2014), American Sniper (2014) (2014's top box office champ), Sully (2016) (starring Tom Hanks as hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger) and 15:17 to Paris (2018). Back on screens after a considerable absence, he played an unlikely drug courier in The Mule (2018), which reached the top of the box office with a nine-figure gross, then directed Der Fall Richard Jewell (2019). At age 91, Eastwood made history as the oldest actor to star above the title in a movie with the release of Cry Macho (2021).\n\nAway from the limelight, Eastwood has led an aberrant existence and is described by biographer Patrick McGilligan as a cunning manipulator of the media. His convoluted slew of partners and children are now somewhat factually acknowledged, but for the first three decades of his celebrity, his personal life was kept top secret, and several of his families were left out of the official narrative. The actor refuses to disclose his exact number of offspring even to this day. He had a longtime relationship with similarly abstruse co-star Locke (who died aged 74 in 2018, though for her entire public life she masqueraded about being younger), and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women in an unending string of liaisons, many of which overlapped. He has been married only twice, however, with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions.\n\nHis known children are: Laurie Murray (b. 1954), whose mother is unidentified; Kimber Eastwood (b. 1964) with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis; Kyle Eastwood (b. 1968) and Alison Eastwood (b. 1972) with his first ex-wife, Margaret Neville Johnson; Scott Eastwood (b. 1986) and Kathryn Eastwood (b. 1988) with stewardess Jacelyn Reeves; Francesca Eastwood (b. 1993) with actress Frances Fisher; and Morgan Eastwood (b. 1996) with his second ex-wife, Dina Eastwood. The entire time that he lived with Locke she was legally married to sculptor Gordon Anderson.\n\nEastwood has real estate holdings in Bel-Air, La Quinta, Carmel-by-the-Sea, Cassel (in remote northern California), Idaho's Sun Valley and Kihei, Hawaii.\n\nThe archetypal screen tough guy with weatherbeaten features--one film critic described his rugged looks as \"a Clark Gable who had been left out in the sun too long\"--Charles Bronson was born Charles Buchinsky, one of 15 children of struggling parents in Pennsylvania. His mother, Mary (Valinsky), was born in Pennsylvania, to Lithuanian parents, and his father, Walter Buchinsky, was a Lithuanian immigrant coal miner.\n\nHe completed high school and joined his father in the mines (an experience that resulted in a lifetime fear of being in enclosed spaces) and then served in WW II. After his return from the war, Bronson used the GI Bill to study art (a passion he had for the rest of his life), then enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse in California. One of his teachers was impressed with the young man and recommended him to director Henry Hathaway, resulting in Bronson making his film debut in You're in the Navy Now (1951).\n\nHe appeared on screen often early in his career, though usually uncredited. However, he made an impact on audiences as the evil assistant to Vincent Price in the 3-D thriller Das Kabinett des Professor Bondi (1953). His sinewy yet muscular physique got him cast in action-type roles, often without a shirt to highlight his manly frame. He received positive notices from critics for his performances in Vera Cruz (1954), Sperrfeuer auf Quadrat 7 (1955) and Hölle der tausend Martern (1957). Indie director Roger Corman cast him as the lead in his well-received low-budget gangster flick Revolver-Kelly (1958), then Bronson scored the lead in his own TV series, Der Mann mit der Kamera (1958). The 1960s proved to be the era in which Bronson made his reputation as a man of few words but much action.\n\nDirector John Sturges cast him as half Irish/half Mexican gunslinger Bernardo O'Reilly in the smash hit western Die glorreichen Sieben (1960), and hired him again as tunnel rat Danny Velinski for the WWII POW big-budget epic Gesprengte Ketten (1963). Several more strong roles followed, then once again he was back in military uniform, alongside Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine in the testosterone-filled Das dreckige Dutzend (1967).\n\nEuropean audiences had taken a shine to his minimalist acting style, and he headed to the Continent to star in several action-oriented films, including San Sebastian (1968) (aka \"Guns for San Sebastian\"), the cult western Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod (1968) (aka \"Once Upon a Time in The West\"), Der aus dem Regen kam (1970) (aka \"Rider On The Rain\") and, in one of the quirkier examples of international casting, alongside Japansese screen legend Toshirô Mifune in the western Rivalen unter roter Sonne (1971) (aka \"Red Sun\").\n\nAmerican audiences were by now keen to see Bronson back on US soil, and he returned triumphantly in the early 1970s to take the lead in more hard-edged crime and western dramas, including Die Valachi-Papiere (1972) and the revenge western Chatos Land (1972). After nearly 25 years as a working actor, he became an 'overnight\" sensation. Bronson then hooked up with British director Michael Winner to star in several highly successful urban crime thrillers, including Kalter Hauch (1972) and Ein Mann geht über Leichen (1973). He then scored a solid hit as a Colorado melon farmer-done-wrong in Richard Fleischer's Das Gesetz bin ich (1974). However, the film that proved to be a breakthrough for both Bronson and Winner came in 1974 with the release of the controversial Ein Mann sieht rot (1974) (written with Henry Fonda in mind, who turned it down because he was disgusted by the script).\n\nThe US was at the time in the midst of rising street crime, and audiences flocked to see a story about a mild-mannered architect who seeks revenge for the murder of his wife and rape of his daughter by gunning down hoods, rapists and killers on the streets of New York City. So popular was the film that it spawned four sequels over the next 20 years.\n\nAction fans could not get enough of tough guy Bronson, and he appeared in what many fans--and critics--consider his best role: Depression-era street fighter Chaney alongside James Coburn in Ein stahlharter Mann (1975). That was followed by the somewhat slow-paced western Nevada Pass (1975) (with wife Jill Ireland), the light-hearted romp (a flop) Zwischen zwölf und drei (1976) and as Soviet agent Grigori Borsov in director Don Siegel's Cold War thriller Telefon (1977).\n\nBronson remained busy throughout the 1980s, with most of his films taking a more violent tone, and he was pitched as an avenging angel eradicating evildoers in films like the Ein Mann wie Dynamit (1983), Der Liquidator (1984), Der Mordanschlag (1987) and Kinjite - Tödliches Tabu (1989). Bronson jolted many critics with his forceful work as murdered United Mine Workers leader Jock Yablonski in the TV movie Local 323 (1986), gave a very interesting performance in the Sean Penn-directed Indian Runner (1991) and surprised everyone with his appearance as compassionate newspaper editor Francis Church in the family film ...und den Weihnachtsmann gibts doch! (1991).\n\nBronson's final film roles were as police commissioner Paul Fein in a well-received trio of crime/drama TV movies Eiskalte Wut (1995), Family of Cops 2 - Der Beichtstuhlmörder (1997) and Family of Cops (1999). Unfortunately, ill health began to take its toll; he suffered from Alzheimer's disease for the last few years of his life, and finally passed away from pneumonia at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in August 2003.\n\nBronson was a true icon of international cinema; critics had few good things to say about his films, but he remained a fan favorite in both the US and abroad for 50 years, a claim few other film legends can make.\n\nBlue-eyed and well-built Italian actor in international cinema, Franco Nero, was a painting photographer when he was discovered as an actor by director John Huston. He has since appeared in more than 200 movies around the world, working with Europe's top directors, such as Luis Buñuel, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Claude Chabrol, Sergey Bondarchuk, Michael Cacoyannis, Elio Petri, Marco Bellocchio, Enzo G. Castellari, among many others.\n\nNero was born in Parma (Northern Italy), in the family of a strict police sergeant. His inclination for acting had already become obvious in his teenage years, when he began organizing and participating in student plays. After a short stint at a leading theater school, he moved to Rome, where he joined a small group of friends for the purpose of making documentaries. Still unsure of his ultimate vocation, he worked various jobs on the crew. He studied economics and trade in Milan University, and appeared in popular Italian photo-novels. This gave him a chance to gain a little role in Carlo Lizzani's La Celestina P... R... (1965).\n\nA year later, the handsome face of Nero was noticed by Huston, who chose him for the role of \"Abel\" in Die Bibel (1966) (aka La Bibbia). But success came after he got the role of the lonely gunfighter, dragging a coffin, in one of the best spaghetti-westerns; Sergio Corbucci's Django (1966). Nero then filmed a few other westerns of that style as Ferdinando Baldi's Django, der Rächer (1966) and Lucio Fulci's Django - Sein Gesangbuch war der Colt (1966).\n\nIn 1967, Joshua Logan cast him in the film version of the musical Camelot: Am Hofe König Arthurs (1967) (Warner Bros.), opposite Vanessa Redgrave, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award. During filming of Camelot, he met actress Vanessa Redgrave, who become his long-time partner (they married decades later). He played with Catherine Deneuve in Luis Buñuel's Tristana (1970) and was directed by Sergey Bondarchuk in the war drama Die Schlacht an der Neretva (1969). Later, director Bondarchuk cast Nero for the role of famous American reporter \"John Reed\" in two-part \"Krasnye kolokola II\" (1982). In the late 60s and during the 70s, Nero played many different roles, but most of them connected with political and criminal genre, which criticized the Italian justice system.\n\nIn the early 80s, Nero was chosen for the role of the white ninja, \"Cole\", in Ninja - Die Killer-Maschine (1981) and in 1990 as terrorist \"Gen. Esperanza\", opposite Bruce Willis, in Renny Harlin's Stirb Langsam 2 (1990). He has also payed the roles of leading national heroes, such as \"Garibaldi\" (Italy), \"Arpad\" (Hungary), and \"Banovic Strahinja\" (Yugoslavia). In the USA, he has been in successful mini-series, such as \"The Pirate\" (Warner Bros), \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" (CBS), \"Young Catherine\" (TNT), \"Bella Mafia\" (CBS), \"The Painted Lady\", \"Saint Augustine\", and movies such as \"The Legend of Valentino\", \"21 Hours to Munich\", \"Force 10 from Navarone\", \"Enter the Ninja\", \"The Versace Murder\", and Briefe an Julia (2010).\n\nHe worked with the top European directors from Carlo Lizzani, Damiano Damiani, Luigi Zampa, Luis Buñuel, Elio Petri, Michael Cacoyannis, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Claude Chabrol, 'Vatroslav Mimica', Marco Bellocchio, etc. At the beginning of the 80s, he also began producing, writing and directing. Between films, he participates in various theatrical events.\n\nApart from his cinematographic work, Nero also works for charitable organizations. Over the last 45 years, he has been a benefactor of the Don Bosco orphanage in Tivoli. He has received many awards and, in 1992 for his artistic merits, a knighthood of the Italian Republic was bestowed on him by the President of Italy. In 2011, he was honored by Brunel University of London with the honorary degree of doctor of Letters honoris causa and, in Toronto, with a star on the Walk of Fame.\n\nThe mighty, musclebound actor Richard Harrison was one of a slew of handsome American pectoral hunks whose 1950's career in Hollywood amounted to little more than brawny bits but, after, being lured to Italy, became a popular sword-and-sandal star of the early 1960's. Unlike many others, Harrison managed to sustain his action star status, making over 100 European/Asian films due thanks to his impulsive trek abroad.\n\nBorn on May 26, 1936 in Salt Lake City, Richard relocated to sunny Southern California in his late teens where his blond, tanned, chiseled good looks (he was sometimes mistaken for handsome actor Guy Madison) landed him modeling work both on runways and in beefcake magazines such as \"Body Beautiful,\" \"Adonis\" and \"Physique Pictorial.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for Richard to be noticed by Hollywood casting agents. At first cast in he-man bit roles wearing a uniform (or less), he can be obscurely seen in Ein Herzschlag bis zur Ewigkeit (1957), his film debut starring Kim Novak, Kronos (1957) with Jeff Morrow, Ihr Leben war ein Skandal (1958) starring Dorothy Malone, Süd Pazifik (1958), in which he can be glimpsed as a co-pilot, and Den Letzten beißen die Hunde (1959) with Scott Brady and a young Robert Blake. While filming another minor role in Robur - Der Herr der sieben Kontinente (1961), he met producer James H. Nicholson's daughter, Loretta (actress Loretta Nicholson) and married her within six months. The couple produced three children.\n\nFrustrated at not being able to secure meatier roles in Hollywood, Richard jumped at the chance when offered the lead role in the peplum spectacle Der unbesiegbare Gladiator (1961) which filmed in Europe. He wound up settling in Italy for the next two decades. His first role, of course, immediately typed him as another Steve Reeves mythological hero type and it was followed by other warriors such as Darius in Die sieben Gladiatoren (1962), Perseus in Perseus - Der Unbesiegbare (1963), Glaucus in Der Letzte der Gladiatoren (1964), Crassus in Kaiser der Gladiatoren (1964), Rufo in Der Aufstand der Prätorianer (1964) and Claudius in Die Giganten von Rom (1964).\n\nOnce the Herculean craze waned in the mid 1960s, Richard sought other starring parts in both Italian \"spaghetti\" westerns (100.000 Dollar für Ringo (1965), Countdown für 3 Millionen Dollar (1967), Fünf blutige Stricke (1968), Anche nel west c'era una volta Dio (1968), Von Django - mit den besten Empfehlungen! (1968)) and crime/spy intrigue (Bob Fleming hetzt Professor G. (1965), Bob Fleming - Mission Casablanca (1966), Die Doppelgänger (1967), La donna, il sesso e il superuomo (1968)). He then maintained a sturdy steadiness into the 1970's with title roles in Lo sceriffo di Rockspring (1971), Ein Halleluja für zwei linke Brüder (1972) and L'amico del padrino (1972).\n\nAs work thinned out, Richard managed to dig up work outside Italy -- with low-budget features in Hong Kong (Marco Polo im Reiche des Kublai Khan (1975), Der Aufstand von Peking (1976)), Turkey (Anasinin Gözü (1974), Yankesici (1975), Sahit (1978)), Germany (Natascha - Die tödliche Masche (1977) (Natascha: The Deadly Drop)), and Yugoslavia (Alpha Beta (1974)). In the 1980's, Richard found a profitable market in Hong Kong with his series of \"Ninja Master\" films (as Ninja Master Gordon) in such representative actioneers as Ninja Terminator (1986), Ninja Dragon (1986), Ninja Operation: Licensed to Terminate (1987), Der schwarze Tiger (1987), The Ninja Showdown (1988), Thunderbolt Angels (1988).\n\nOccasionally delving into writing, producing and directing as he did with Terror Force Kommando (1986), Richard's status as a European action star continued with lead roles as renegade cops in both Terminal Force (1989) and Highway zur Hölle (1990). As he aged, he then began turning more and more to featured parts for other stars such as Dan Haggerty in The Channeler (1991) and Erik Estrada in Angel Eyes (1993). He retired by the millennium.\n\nAfter his divorce from Loretta, Richard married actress Maria Francesca in 1978. They had one more child. Two of Richard's sons went into film acting -- Robert Harrison and Sebastian Harrison.\n\nFrom 1955, Fabio Testi's home town Peschiera del Garda was also home to Bertolazzi Film, a motion picture studio which specialised in the production of colourful pirate movies. Lake Garda was merrily used as the ersatz Caribbean. At Bertolazzi, young Fabio began his career first as an extra, then as a stunt man and body double. As a stunt man, he appeared in the classic westerns Zwei glorreiche Halunken (1966) and (as one of Henry Fonda's minions in Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod (1968). He started getting small film roles from 1967 and this helped to finance his architectural studies at the Antòn Maria Lorgna Institute in Verona. After graduating, Testa did not became a surveyor as originally planned, but made commercials for Coca Cola and proceeded to further studies at Verona's Academy of Fine Arts to improve his acting. For several years, he appeared in genre films, often lesser spaghetti westerns like Quel maledetto giorno d'inverno... Django e Sartana all'ultimo sangue (1970). As a bona fide action hero, his athletic prowess and imposing physique became a definite asset. Nonetheless, still dissatisfied with the roles he was getting, Testi attended diction classes in Cambridge to improve his English and went to London for acting lessons.\n\nUpon his return to Italy, he finally made his breakthrough after being picked by Vittorio De Sica for the role of the ill-fated Giampiero in the Oscar-winning historical drama Der Garten der Finzi Contini (1970). In the wake of the picture's success, Testi has alternated between performing in art films by directors like Claude Chabrol and Denys de La Patellière, and genre films of the giallo (Edgar Wallace: Das Geheimnis der grünen Stecknadel (1972)) or poliziotteschi/crime variety (Camorra (1972), Die perfekte Erpressung (1973), Die Rache der Camorra (1974)). Over the years he has acted alongside international stars like Oliver Reed, Anthony Quinn, Robert Mitchum (in Der Ambassador (1984)), Eli Wallach and David Hemmings. By the mid-1980's, Testi was seen more often in television productions. In the 90's, he also turned his attention towards the theatre with a role in a stage adaptation of Federico Fellini's Das Lied der Straße (1954).\n\nThough still very active on the screen, Testi has had the time to sideline as a kiwi farmer, an enterprise which grew from a hobby into a lucrative business (Italy, as a result, becoming Europe's first producer of kiwi fruit). In 2006, Testi ran for political office as Mayor of Verona, representing the conservative Cattolici Liberali Cristiani.\n\nAs an unapologetically self-confessed Latin lover type, Testi has made headlines in the press (particularly the Italian gossip press) not only for the work in his chosen profession, but also for a series of well publicized romantic entanglements with actresses Ursula Andress, Edwige Fenech, Jean Seberg and Charlotte Rampling. He was married to the Spanish fashion designer and make-up artist Lola Navarro from 1984 to 1996. His second wife has been art gallery curator Antonella Liguori.\n\nBud Spencer, the popular Italian actor who starred in innumerable spaghetti Westerns and action-packed potboilers during the 1960s and 1970s, was born Carlo Pedersoli on October 31, 1929, in Naples. The first Italian to swim the 100-meter freestyle in less than a minute, Spencer competed as a swimmer on the Italian National Team at the Olympic Summer games in both Helsinki, Finland, in 1952 and Melbourne, Australia, in 1956. He was also an Olympic-class water polo player.\n\nEducated as an attorney, he was bitten by the acting bug and appeared as a member of the Praetorian Guard in his first movie, MGM's epic Quo vadis? (1951) (which was shot in Italy) in 1951. During the 1950s and first half of the 1960s he appeared in films made for the Italian market, but his career was strictly minor league until the late 1960s. He changed his screen name to \"Bud Spencer\" in 1967, as an homage to Spencer Tracy and to the American beer Budweiser. Spencer allegedly thought it was funny to call himself \"Bud\" in light of his huge frame.\n\nAfter the name change, Spencer achieved his greatest success in spaghetti Westerns lensed for a global audience. Teaming up with fellow Italian Terence Hill, the two made such international hits as Vier für ein Ave Maria (1968) and Die rechte und die linke Hand des Teufels (1970) (\"They Call Me Trinity\"). Their dual outings made both stars famous, particularly in Europe. In all, Spencer made 18 movies with Hill.\n\nHe became a jet airplane and helicopter pilot after appearing in Zwei Himmelhunde auf dem Weg zur Hölle (1972) and owned an air transportation company, Mistral Air, which he founded in 1984. However, he terminated his business interest in Mistral and entered the children's clothing industry. After 1983 Spencer's movie career slowed down, though he did have a big success in the early 1990s with the TV action-drama series \"Extralarge\". A man of many talents, Spencer wrote screenplays and texts for some of his movies. He also has registered several patents.\n\nSpencer married Maria Amato in 1960 and they have three children, Giuseppe (born 1961), Christine (1962) and Diamante (1972).\n\nIn 2005 Spencer entered politics, standing as regional councillor in Lazio for the center-right Forza Italia party. He became a politician specifically at the bequest of then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. According to Spencer, \"In my life, I've done everything. There are only three things I haven't been - a ballet dancer, a jockey and a politician. Given that the first two jobs are out of the question, I'll throw myself into politics.\"\n\nBerlusconi, who was a media tycoon in the vein of Rupert Murdoch before he entered politics, recruited Spencer as he was \"still a major draw for the viewer, alias the voter.\" Critics of Berlusconi--who tried to retain power by launching a campaign to portray his allies as the embodiment of \"good\" and the leftists of the opposition as \"evil\"--was derided as an example of \"politica spettacolo\" (\"showbiz politics\").\n\nSpencer announced his new career at a \"Felliniesque\" press conference at a Rome hotel, at which he hardly moved and had little to say except homilies about upholding family values. Spencer sat between two Forza Italia handlers, and according to one major Italian newspaper, \"From one moment to the next, you expected this mountain of a man to grab the heads of the two presenters and smack them together in his usual style, as he has been seen doing countless times on the big screen and television.\" The audition proved to be a flop: Spencer lost the seat, and Berlusconi's party was swept from power in 2006.\n\nLanky, charismatic and versatile actor with an amazing grin that put everyone at ease, James Coburn studied acting at UCLA, and then moved to New York to study under noted acting coach Stella Adler. After being noticed in several stage productions, Coburn appeared in a handful of minor westerns before being cast as the knife-throwing, quick-shooting Britt in the John Sturges mega-hit Die glorreichen Sieben (1960). Sturges remembered Coburn's talents when he cast his next major film project, Gesprengte Ketten (1963), where Coburn played the Australian POW Sedgwick. Regular work now came thick and fast for Coburn, including appearing in Sierra Charriba (1965), the first of several films he appeared in directed by Hollywood enfant terrible Sam Peckinpah.\n\nCoburn was then cast, and gave an especially fine performance as Lt. Commander Paul Cummings in Arthur Hiller's The Americanization of Emily, where he demonstrated a flair for writer Paddy Chayefsky's subtle, ironic comedy that would define his performances for the rest of his career.\n\nThe next two years were a key period for Coburn, with his performances in the wonderful 007 spy spoof Derek Flint schickt seine Leiche (1966) and the eerie Immer wenn er Dollars roch (1966). Coburn followed up in 1967 with a Flint sequel, Derek Flint - hart wie Feuerstein (1967), and the much underrated political satire Jagt Dr. Sheefer (1967). The remainder of the 1960s was rather uneventful for Coburn. However, he became associated with martial arts legend Bruce Lee and the two trained together, traveled extensively and even visited India scouting locations for a proposed film project, but Lee's untimely death (Coburn, along with Steve McQueen, was a pallbearer at Lee's funeral) put an end to that.\n\nThe 1970s saw Coburn appearing again in several strong roles, starting off in Peckinpah's Pat Garrett jagt Billy the Kid (1973), alongside Charles Bronson in the Depression-era Ein stahlharter Mann (1975) and as a disenchanted German soldier on the Russian front in Peckinpah's superb Steiner - Das Eiserne Kreuz (1977). Towards the end of the decade, however, Coburn was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, which severely hampered his health and work output for many years. After conventional treatments failed, Coburn turned to a holistic therapist, and through a restructured diet program, made a definite improvement. By the 1990s he was once again appearing regularly in both film and TV productions.\n\nNo one was probably more surprised than Coburn himself when he was both nominated for, and then won, the Best Supporting Actor Award in 1997 for playing Nick Nolte's abusive and alcoholic father in Der Gejagte (1997). At 70 years of age, Coburn's career received another shot in the arm, and he appeared in another 14 films, including Snow Dogs - Acht Helden auf vier Pfoten (2002) and Ein Mann für geheime Stunden (2001), before his death from a heart attack in November of 2002. Coburn's passions in life included martial arts, card-playing and enjoying Cuban cigars (which may have contributed to his fatal heart attack).\n\nExotic leading man of American films, famed as much for his completely bald head as for his performances, Yul Brynner masked much of his life in mystery and outright lies designed to tease people he considered gullible. It was not until the publication of the books \"Yul: The Man Who Would Be King\" and \"Empire and Odyssey\" by his son, Yul \"Rock\" Brynner, that many of the details of Brynner's early life became clear.\n\nYul sometimes claimed to be a half-Swiss, half-Japanese named Taidje Khan, born on the island of Sakhalin; in reality, he was the son of Marousia Dimitrievna (Blagovidova), the Russian daughter of a doctor, and Boris Yuliyevich Bryner, an engineer and inventor of Swiss-German and Russian descent. He was born in their home town of Vladivostok on 11 July 1920 and named Yuli after his grandfather, Jules Bryner. When Yuli's father abandoned the family, his mother took him and his sister Vera to Harbin, Manchuria, where they attended a YMCA school. In 1934 Yuli's mother took her children to Paris. Her son was sent to the exclusive Lycée Moncelle, but his attendance was spotty. He dropped out and became a musician, playing guitar in the nightclubs among the Russian gypsies who gave him his first real sense of family. He met luminaries such as Jean Cocteau and became an apprentice at the Theatre des Mathurins. He worked as a trapeze artist with the famed Cirque d'Hiver company.\n\nHe traveled to the U.S. in 1941 to study with acting teacher Michael Chekhov and toured the country with Chekhov's theatrical troupe. That same year, he debuted in New York as Fabian in \"Twelfth Night\" (billed as Youl Bryner). After working in a very early TV series, Mr. Jones and His Neighbors (1944), he played on Broadway in \"Lute Song\" with Mary Martin, winning awards and mild acclaim. He and his wife, actress Virginia Gilmore, starred in the first TV talk show, Mr. and Mrs. (1948). Brynner then joined CBS as a television director. He made his film debut in Rauschgiftbrigade (1949). Two years later Mary Martin recommended him for the part he would forever be known for: the King in Richard Rodgers' and Oscar Hammerstein II's musical \"The King and I\". Brynner became an immediate sensation in the role, repeating it for film (Der König von Siam (1956)) and winning the Oscar for Best Actor.\n\nFor the next two decades, he maintained a starring film career despite the exotic nature of his persona, performing in a wide range of roles from Egyptian pharaohs to Western gunfighters, almost all with the same shaved head and indefinable accent. In the 1970s he returned to the role that had made him a star, and spent most of the rest of his life touring the world in \"The King and I\". When he developed lung cancer in the mid 1980s, he left a powerful public service announcement denouncing smoking as the cause, for broadcast after his death. The cancer and its complications, after a long illness, ended his life. Brynner was cremated and his ashes buried in a remote part of France, on the grounds of the Abbey of Saint-Michel de Bois Aubry, a short distance outside the village of Luzé. He remains one of the most fascinating, unusual and beloved stars of his time.\n\nThough it can be said that he only gained fame as an actor because he bore such a heavy resemblance to Italian actor Franco Nero, Maurizio Merli was a very versatile and charismatic leading man in Italian cinema throughout the 1970's. His first appearance was in the Luchino Visconti film Der Leopard (1963) as an uncredited extra. Throughout the 60's and early 70's, the young Merli kept a low profile and remained a fairly minor player in the Italian films. His major breakthrough came with director Tonino Ricci, who was to direct an unofficial sequel to Lucio Fulci's Wolfsblut (1973) without the benefit of its star, Franco Nero. Ricci realized that casting Merli in the lead would fool the viewing audience into thinking they were seeing Nero and hence an authentic White Fang adventure. The subsequent film Wolfsblut greift ein (1975) worked well enough for Marino Girolami and Fabrizio De Angelis to cast Merli as the lead in the crime drama Verdammte, heilige Stadt (1975) a year later. Much like before, Merli was cast because the film vaguely resembled the Franco Nero Film Tote Zeugen singen nicht (1973) (\"High Crime\"). Verdammte, heilige Stadt (1975) turned out to be a huge success both in Italy and abroad and Merli found himself inexplicably catapulted to international stardom. Very similar to how Terence Hill found his niche in comedies after being discovered out of the crowd of Nero stand-ins, Maurizio Merli established himself as the leading man in the Italian crime film genre of the period. Over the brief span from 1975-1979, Merli starred in no less than a dozen crime films from the likes of noted Italian directors Umberto Lenzi, Stelvio Massi, and Fernando Di Leo including such classics as Camorra - Ein Bulle räumt auf (1976), Cop Hunter (1976), and _Da Corleone a Brooklyn (1978)_. Merli also followed Nero's footsteps once again in the Keoma-inspired Mannaja - Das Beil des Todes (1977). Merli's brief busy period saw him hopelessly typecast in the same role as the hard-nosed detective in practically every film he starred in. Merli was said to get so into these roles that he would frequently go overboard during the fight scenes and hurt the stuntmen. In both _Roma a mano armata (1976)_ and Die Gewalt bin ich (1977), Merli was cast opposite Cuban actor Tomas Milian, with whom he did not get along in real life. The tension between the two made for some very good on-screen chemistry for the few scenes they had together. Merli's \"tough cop\" performances ranged from so-so to nearly brilliant at times with him angrily shaking his fists and grinding his teeth when the script would rarely call for such things. However, it was this type-casting which led to the demise of his career when Italian filmmakers began to focus less on crime films and more on fantastic films in the early 80's such as horror, action, and post apocalyptic films in which Merli simply had no place. He had a brief role in Giorgio Bontempi's spy thriller Geheimkommando C.I.A. (1983) but by then his level of work was but a fraction of what it once was. A devout health-nut in his later years, Merli collapsed after overexerting himself in a tennis match and died of Myocardial Infarction at the age of 49."
