        "text": "Jay Steiger, 83, of Carmel, passed away Saturday, May 5, 2018. He was born on May 21, 1934 in Cleveland, OH, son of Clarence and Leonarda Nickels Steiger.\n\nOn August 11, 1956 he married the love of his life, Rosemary Ann Rogers. In their life together, they demonstrated what true love and a great partnership is all about. They could often be seen sitting together holding hands and there wasn’t a day that went by that they didn’t say I love you to each other.\n\nJay received his Bachelor’s Degree from Baldwin Wallace College and Master’s from Bowling Green State University. After more than 30 years he retired from General Motors as a well-respected contributor in Human Resources. Jay had a passion for photography and excelled in woodworking. His enthusiasm for sailing led him to build his own boat. For more than two decades, vacations with his wife Rosemary were spent on the shores of northern Michigan where they enjoyed the serenity of the nautical landscape. Jay was devoted to his family and loved spending time with his wife, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren telling stories and entertaining everyone with his unique sense of humor. His family will never forget the laughter shared around the dining room table, especially during the holidays. Jay will be greatly missed by those who knew and loved him. He was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, brother and friend.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Jay was preceded in death by his sisters, Meryl Steiger Jacobson, Laurene Steiger Kelley and brother, Dan Steiger.\n\nSurvivors include his devoted wife of 61 years and best friend, Rosemary Steiger; children, Kathy Steiger, Mark (Anna) Steiger, Terri Steiger, Laurie (Dan) Allen, Susan (Tim) Carey, Carol (Prescott) Osterbrock and Molly (Tyler) Knapp; grandchildren, Kristin, Kimberly (Kyle), Dick, Bradley, Abby, Rosie, Caroline, David, Anna, Isabel and Eliana; great-grandchildren, Benjamin, Tyler, and Derek.\n\nFamily and friends will gather on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 from 2-5 pm in Our Lady of Mt Carmel Catholic Church and Wednesday, May 9, at 10 am. The Mass of Christian Burial will be conducted at 11 am.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests in memory of Jay, donations be given to the Trinity Free Clinic, 14598 Oakridge Road, Carmel, IN 46032 or the Merciful H.E.L.P. Center, 1045 W 146th Street, Carmel, IN 46032. Envelopes will be available at the service.\n\nBussell Family Funerals is privileged to assist the family in arrangements."
