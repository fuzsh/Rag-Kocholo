That pride increased when his judicial career became a model of how a judge at that lofty level should behave and perform: quietly, judiciously, scholarly, eloquently.\n\nAt the time of his death on December 21, 1987, the nation was gripped by an acrimonious effort to identify the qualities that members of the federal judiciary should possess. The search could have stopped with Carl McGowan. An editorial in TheWashington Post made this clear: \"How refreshing ... to find on a deeply divided court during deeply divisive times . . . the moderating influence and persuasive intellect of a conscientious jurist. His common sense, coupled with a gentle demeanor and kind humor, made Carl McGowan an important figure on this important court.\"\n\nCarl came to Dartmouth from Paris, I11. A member of DKE and Dragon, he graduated magna cum laude, then earned a degree from Columbia Law School. He engaged in many parts of the legal profession: private practice; teaching (at Northwestern Law School); government service (in the Navy Department and State of Illinois); politics (Adlai Stevenson's presidential campaign); and ultimately the judiciary.\n\nCarl was the principal speaker at the memorial service for Adlai Stevenson, and each speaker at Carl's own memorial service appropriately quoted from his moving tribute to that earlier ornament of the legal profession.\n\nThose of us who knew Carl for over half a century will miss him grievously.\n\nSurviving are Carl's wife, Josephine, a son, and two daughters—including Hope '77. May proud and loving memorials console them.\n\nMICHAEL H. CARDOZO '32\n\nADRIAN JESUP NITSCHELM died on January 11 after a short illness.

Then he and his wife, Terry, purchased and operated Glenwood-on-the-Saco in Glen, N.H., their first of three inns. In 1942 they purchased the Cranmore Inn in North Conway, N.H.\n\nAde retired in 1970 and spent much of the time since in traveling, entertaining friends, and staying in touch with his family, to which he was devoted. He was a gentle man and a caring man who enjoyed the opportunity of giving assistance to a number of young people.\n\nHe was an active alumnus, serving as class agent for both the Alumni Fund and for Tuck School. He and Terry became \"regulars\" on his class reunion committees.\n\nAde leaves his wife; four children, Ruth, George, Martha, and Fred; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\n\nRICHARD W.

A granddaughter, Elizabeth Pike, will graduate with Dartmouth's class of 1988.\n\nOn August 3, 1987, DONALD ALEXANDERTHOMPSON died at the Mesurck Home in Baltimore. Don matriculated with our class but transferred to M.I.T. after his freshman year. He married in 1935, worked for a time in Peabody Book Shop and the Yale University Press, then joined Arthur Thompson & Company, color lithographers, becoming president in 1940.\n\nDon is survived by his wife, Betty, and three children, Peter, David, and Amanda.\n\n1933\n\nWILLIAM RICHMOND JONES died suddenly of a myocardial infarction, November 25, 1987, in Exeter, N.H.\n\nHe entered Dartmouth from the Friends School of Brooklyn, majored in French, and spent his junior year at the Sorbonne.

High School, was a psychology major, and a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. After graduation, he worked in a Colorado gold mine in which his father had an interest.

He retired in 1977.\n\nHe was active in the Masons, and was a member of the Dartmouth Club of Baltimore. The Page family had a strong association with Dartmouth. His father, William Sr., was graduated in the class of 1906, his brother John was '39, and a nephew, Jonathan, was '68. Memorial gifts were suggested for the Page Worthington Scholarship Fund, a fellow Baltimorian and '32 whom Bill knew over the years.\n\nDANTAN WINSLOW SAWYER died November 19, 1987, in a convalescent home in South Carolina of progressive cerebral failure.\n\nHe entered Dartmouth from Saugus, Mass., and though a history major had an underlying interest in art. He belonged to the Zeta Psi fraternity, and was a member of the Arts Council.\n\nAfter graduation Dan studied architecture in France and opened his own office in Hamilton, Mass., in 1935. This was interrupted by service as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy from 1941 till 1946.\n\nDan's chief interest was in period architecture and in historic restoration of houses and towns, Bedford, Mass., being one. His knowledge and expertise were recognized by Who's Who, and by Arts and Artists, where he served as an editor.

He closed his office and moved to Charleston, S.C., where he was a consultant on the restoration of that beautiful and historic city.

Along the way he got his B.A. at Central YMCA College in Chicago and a B.S. at Oklahoma City U. He was active with Toastmasters International and a member of Sigma Chi.\n\nJack is survived by his wife, Helen, their son Gregory, and daughter Julie Ann.\n\n1935\n\nROBERT LYNN BUSEY died of throat cancer on December 4, 1987, in the Bryn Mawr Medical Center.

He wrote, directed, and produced plays that traveled, -on the power of the stars in their casts, to summer stock theaters around the country. They always contained a comic role for the playwright.\" He met with some success in film roles in the fifties.\n\nHis communications with the College in recent years were limited. There are no survivors to the best of our knowledge.\n\n1938\n\nRAYMOND HENRY BERQUIST died January 3 in Naples, Fla. He came to Dartmouth from Melrose (Mass.)
