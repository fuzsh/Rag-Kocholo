Rs362691 Polymorphism in RELN Gene Modulates the Detrimental Effect of Alzheimer's Disease Risk Genes on Hippocampal Function\n\nQiang Chen*, Ena Y. Xiao, Aaron L. Goldman, Rahul Bharadwaj, Kaitlin Healy, Brad Zoltick, Saumitra Das, Karen Berman, Daniel R. Weinberger, Venkata S. Mattay\n\nLieber Institute for Brain Development, Baltimore, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) is one of the most common debilitating causes of dementia worldwide with heritability estimates ranging from 50 – 70%. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 20 genetic loci in addition to APOEɛ4 that are associated with increased risk for LOAD. While most of these genes have weak effects, using a polygenic risk profile score (RPS) approach – a method that allows exploration of the influence of the cumulative effect of risk alleles - we and others have shown the negative influence of LOAD risk genes on brain structure (Chauhan et al., 2015) and function (Xiao et al., 2015 HBM) even in healthy volunteers. Identifying mechanisms, particularly genetic mechanisms that confer resilience to the detrimental effect of LOAD related risk genes on brain structure and function could provide a viable avenue to identify novel therapeutic targets for LOAD. To that end, in the current study, we explored the role of polymorphisms in the gene encoding Reelin (RELN), a glycoprotein that has been shown to be critical for neuronal development and synaptic plasticity (Kramer et al. 2011), on the detrimental effect of LOAD RPS on hippocampal function. Studies have shown that normal RELN levels are necessary to prevent abnormal phosphorylation of tau (Ohkubo et al., 2003) and beta-amyloid-induced suppression of long term potentiation and NMDA receptors (Durakoglugil et al., 2009).\n\nMethods: BOLD functional MRI images (GE 3 T MRI scanner, TR/TE = 2000/28ms, flip angle = 90 deg, FOV = 64x64, 24 axial slices, 170 volumes) were collected for 265 right-handed Caucasian healthy volunteers (116 male, 149 female) from the age of 18 to 86 years (SD = 14.17) while they performed a simple declarative memory task (SDMT). Images were motion-corrected, normalized to MNI space, and spatially smoothed (8mm FWHM) using SPM5. Odd's ratios of 22 independent SNPs, with P<1 × 10-5 in Hollingworth's meta-analysis1 comprising four Alzheimer's disease GWAS datasets (GERAD1, EADI1, TGEN1, ADNI), spanning the regions of ABCA7, APOC4, APOE, BCAM, BCL3, BIN1, C16orf88, CDK1, CEACAM1E, CLPTMI, CLU, CNTN5, CR1, CR2, CUX2, EXOC3L2, IQCK, LRRC68, MS4A4A, MS4A4E, MS4A6A, PICALM, PVR, PVRL2, and TOMM40 genes, were used to calculate the RPS for each individual subject using the approach described by Purcell et al.3. Association between RPS and hippocampal activation during the neutral encoding phase of the SDMT was tested using SPM12. To control for population stratification, 5 MDS components based on 8M SNP genotypes from a GWAS analysis extracted with EIGENSOFT5.01 were included in the analysis as covariates along with age, gender, SNAV, and genotyping batch labels. A region of interest analysis was performed using bilateral hippo-parahippocampal masks from the Anatomical Automatic Labeling Atlas. Influence of RELN on association between LOAD related AD RPS and hippocampal activation was examined separately for five independent Reelin polymorphisms (rs736707, rs362691, rs7341475, rs6943822, and rs4298437.) previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease or Autism Spectrum Disease using flexible factorial analysis in SPM12.\n\nResults: fMRI analysis showed a significant negative correlation between LOAD RPS and hippocampal activation (left: PFWE_corrected = 0.005, MNI coordinates x =-39, y =-24, z =-12, right: PFWE_corrected = 0.139, Puncorrected<0.001, MNI coordinates x = 39, y = -18, z = -18) during the neutral encoding phase of SDMT. There were no significant positive correlations. In addition, there was a significant interactive effect (left: PFWE_corrected = 0.076, MNI coordinates x =-30, y =-30, z =-6, right: PFWE_corrected = 0.368, Puncorrected=0.002, MNI coordinates x =27, y =-33, z =-9) of rs362691 genotype (a G-C missense variant) and LOAD RPS on activation. Furthermore, in the left hippocampus, minor allele C carriers (N=56) showed a significant negative relationship (r=-0.47, p=0.0002, post-hoc analysis in R) between RPS and hippocampal activation, while the major allele G homozygotes (N=208) showed no such relationship (r=0.0071, p=0.9186). None of the other RELN polymorphisms tested showed a significant effect.\n\nConclusions: Our results, while showing a cumulative deleterious effect of several LOAD related risk genes on hippocampal function in healthy volunteers, also illustrate that this relationship is modulated by a missense SNP (rs362691) in the RELN gene. In particular, only the minor allele C carriers show a significant negative relationship between RPS and hippocampal function suggesting that homozygosity for the G allele in this polymorphism could potentially confer a protective effect.\n\nKeywords: Polygenetic Risk Score, Alzheimer's Disease, fMRI/imaging genetics, Hippocampal Function, Cognitive Resilience\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW2. Subtypes of Prefrontal Cortical NMDA Receptors in Working Memory and Normal Aging\n\nJoseph McQuail, B. Sofia Beas, Kyle Kelly, Kailey Simpson, C. Jason Frazier, Barry Setlow, Jennifer Bizon*\n\nUniversity of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida, United States\n\nBackground: Working memory involves the ability to briefly maintain context-specific information in mind and to use this representational knowledge to guide current and future action. This form of short-term memory is supported by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and is believed to rely on the ability of selectively tuned pyramidal neuron networks to persist in firing even after a to-be-remembered stimulus is removed from the environment. Ionotropic glutamate receptors of the NMDA subtype are expressed on pyramidal neurons in the PFC, and altered activity at these receptors has been implicated in working memory deficits associated with both psychiatric disorders and normal aging. NMDA receptors are biochemically diverse heterotetramers comprised of an obligate NR1 subunit and variable NR2A or NR2B subunits, the latter of which can influence both the channel kinetics and localization of the receptor to synaptic versus extrasynaptic sites. These receptor properties conferred by the NR2 subunit suggest that NMDA receptor subtypes may differentially influence normal working memory and the decline of working memory abilities across a variety of pathological conditions. The current study was designed to assess the individual contribution of PFC NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptor subtypes to working memory abilities, and, further, to determine which subunit is most relevant to the well-characterized decline of working memory abilities in normal aging.\n\nMethods: Subjects in all experiments were young (4-6 mo.) and aged (22-24 mo.) male F344 rats. In Experiment 1, acute slices from young rats were prepared and patch clamp electrophysiological methods were used to assess the relative contributions of NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptors to evoked NMDA currents recorded from layer II/III PFC pyramidal neurons. In Experiment 2, four cohorts of young rats (n=6-8 rats/cohort) were surgically implanted with guide cannulae directed at the medial PFC (mPFC) and trained to perform a mPFC-dependent delayed response working memory task. After acquisition of stable baseline performance, rats in each cohort received acute intra-mPFC microinjections of drugs that preferentially target either NR2A (NVP-AM077 or TCN-201) or NR2B (ifenprodil or Ro25-6981) subunits. Three doses of each drug and vehicle were administered immediately prior to testing in the delayed response task, using a randomized, within-subjects design with a 48 h washout period between successive doses. In Experiment 3, Western blot methods were used to determine expression of NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A, and NR2B) in mPFC homogenates prepared from young (n=8) and aged (n=15) rats that were first characterized on the delayed response task. Finally, in Experiment 4, using similar methods as in Experiment 2, the effects of NMDA receptor modulation on aged rat working memory abilities were assessed using two different drugs (D-cycloserine (DCS) and 3-methylpyrazole-5-carboxylic acid (MPC)) that target the NMDA receptor co-agonist serine.\n\nResults: In Experiment 1, blockade of both NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors attenuated evoked NMDA receptor currents recorded from pyramidal neurons in young rat mPFC; however, the contribution of NR2A to the total evoked current was significantly greater than that of NR2B. Consistent with this more predominant role of NR2A in NMDA-mediated currents on pyramidal neurons, both of the NR2A-preferring antagonists administered into the mPFC of young rats in Experiment 2 significantly attenuated working memory performance. In contrast, neither NR2B-specific antagonist affected young rats' working memory performance. In Experiment 3, Western blot analysis revealed a significant reduction in expression of all NMDA receptor subunits in aged rat mPFC, but only loss of the NR2A subunit strongly predicted working memory decline. Data from Experiments 1-3 suggest that NR2A-containing NMDA receptors in PFC are particularly critical for supporting working memory abilities. The preferred role of NR2A-containing receptors in working memory may be attributable to the fact that these receptors preferentially comprise the synaptic pool of NMDA receptors that enable the persistent firing of pyramidal neurons. In Experiment 4, intra-mPFC microinjection of the well-known NMDA receptor co-agonist d-cycloserine, which non-selectively targets both synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, did not improve working memory in aged rats. In contrast, 3-methylpyrazole-5-carboxylic acid, a d-amino acid oxidase inhibitor that more selectively enhances activity at synaptic NMDA receptors by preventing degradation of endogenous serine, significantly improved aged rats' working memory performance.\n\nConclusions: The present experiments specifically implicate NR2A-containing NMDA receptors in normal working memory. The results further suggest that a decline in NR2A receptor expression may be a causal factor for working memory impairments in aging. Our working hypothesis is that NR2A-containing NMDA receptors are particularly important for working memory given that these receptors are preferentially localized to synaptic sites whereas NR2B-containing receptors are preferentially localized extrasynaptically. Consistent with this hypothesis, pharmacological modulation of synaptic NMDA receptors (presumptive NR2A-containing receptors) can significantly improve working memory in aged rats.\n\nKeywords: aging, NMDA Receptor, prefrontal cortex, working memory\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW3. A Mitochondrial Role of SV2A Protein in Alzheimer's Disease: Studies with Levetiracetam\n\nWalter Mueller*, Carola Stockburger, Kristina Friedland\n\nBiocenter Niederusel, University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany\n\nBackground: Hyperexcitability of cortical and hippocampal structures has recently been identified as one of the mechanisms of cognitive deficits in human aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as in animals Models of AD. As underlying cause dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons rather than general neuronal overactivity has been proposed probably associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In line with these findings, out of several antiepileptics which all reduce neuronal excitability only levetiracetam was able to reduce neuronal hyperexcitability and to improve the associated cognitive defects\n\nMethods: Because of its close relationship to the metabolic enhancer piracetam we speculated that levetiracetam similarly improves neuronal function by enhancing mitochondrial function in a cell model of aging, AD, and the interplay of both conditions.\n\nResults: Our findings are fully in line with these assumptions as levetiracetam showed substantial improvement of disturbed mitochondrial paraments as ATP production, mitochondrial dynamics (fission and fusion balance), mPTP pore opening, as well as impaired neuritogenesis due to mitochondrial defects. While these data are quite clear, we still were puzzled in respect of a possible mechanism of action of levetiracetam for these effects, as its primary target, the SV2A protein, seems to be closely related to brain synaptic membranes. However, we could clearly identify substantial levels of this protein also at the mitochondrial level.\n\nConclusions: As SV2A works in the brain as a regulator of vesicle fusion we speculated on the basis of our findings that levetiracetam reduces mPTP opening that it might be involved in the complex mechanisms regulating mPTP function which also involve complex fusion mechanisms at the level of the mitochondrial membrane\n\nKeywords: levetiracetam, mitochondrial function, SV2A protein, aging and dementia\n\nDisclosures: Research support by UCB, Schwabe, speakers honoraria by UCB, Lunfbeck, Schwabe.\n\nW4. Positive Allosteric Modulation of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 Reverses Deficits in Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity and Cognitive Function in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease\n\nJerri M. Rook*, Ayan Goshal, Jonathan W. Dickerson, Gregory N. Roop, Craig W. Lindsley, P. Jeffrey Conn\n\nVanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States\n\nBackground: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by the progressive decline in cognitive function, with deficits in hippocampal-mediated learning and memory. In recent years, a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase termed cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) that is activated by the p25 protein has been increasingly implicated in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders and p25 overexpression in forebrain neurons (CK-p25 mice) induces neuropathology and cognitive impairments that are strikingly similar to those observed in patients suffering from AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Resembling the human condition, CK-p25 mice demonstrate decreased brain mass, decreased neuronal density, neurodegeneration, increased tau phosphorylation and aggregation, accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, as well as elevated levels of A-beta protein (Aβ) and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing enzyme, β-secretase (BACE1). These neuropathological changes are associated with striking impairments in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, and behavioral assays demonstrate severe impairments in learning and memory in CK-p25 mice. This provides an excellent model for identification of novel approaches that could be used to reverse deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognitive function that occur in neurodegenerative disorders associated with these hallmark neuropathological changes that occur in patients suffering from AD and related disorders.\n\nGlutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS and plasticity at glutamatergic synapses is thought to be critical for learning, memory and cognition. Over the past decade, highly selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5) have emerged as a promising new approach for improving cognitive function in schizophrenia and other non-degenerative CNS disorders. As opposed to direct activation of mGlu5, PAMs dramatically potentiate the response of the receptor to its endogenous ligand, glutamate, and offer high selectivity while avoiding unwanted side-effects seen with direct activation of the receptor. Interestingly, mGlu5 PAMs enhance specific forms of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, as well as hippocampal-dependent forms of learning and memory in wild-type animals that are impaired in CK-p25 mice. In addition, previous studies suggest that mGlu5 activation can increase synaptogenesis in forebrain regions in which synaptic density is reduced in AD patients and in CK-p25 mice. Finally, recent studies suggest that proteins important for mGlu5 function are lost and that mGlu5 signaling is impaired in tissues from AD patients and some preclinical animal models of AD. Taken together, these studies raise the exciting possibility that mGlu5 PAMs may offer an exciting new therapeutic strategy to enhance cognitive function in patients suffering from AD and other age-related cognitive deficits.\n\nMethods: All animal studies were approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. CK-p25 mice were maintained on doxycycline diet for 6 weeks following birth to maintain normal p25 levels in the forebrain during development. Subsequently, CK-p25 mice were switched to normal chow to allow p25 induction for 6 weeks. A subset of littermate control mice were maintained continually on doxycycline diet throughout the studies to inhibit p25 overexpression. At 12 weeks of age, mice underwent electrophysiology studies assessing hippocampal synaptic plasticity at the SC-CA1 synapse or behavioral studies evaluating cognitive function in the presence or absence of mGlu5 PAMs.\n\nResults: Hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) is a form of synaptic plasticity essential for learning and memory. CK-p25 mice displayed significant deficits in LTP at the SC-CA1 synapse. In addition, profound hippocampal- and cortical-mediated cognitive deficits were observed in these mice.\n\nInterestingly, bath application of mGlu5 PAMs restored deficits in LTP in CK-p25 mice to levels similar to control mice. Moreover, mGlu5 PAMs demonstrated dose-dependent reversal of cognitive deficits in contextual fear conditioning, novel object recognition task, as well as the pairwise discrimination task using touch screen technology in the CK-p25 mouse model of AD.\n\nConclusions: Utilizing the CK-p25 mouse model of AD, these studies demonstrate that selective potentiation of mGlu5 can reverse not only deficits in hippocampal neurotransmission but also severe cognitive deficits. These results provide critical data in validating the potential utility of mGlu5 PAMs as a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of cognitive impairments associated with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nKeywords: Alzheimer's Disease, mGlu5-PAM, Cognition, Synaptic Plasticity\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW5. Deconstructing Serotonin Circuits that Mediate Aversion\n\nCatherine Marcinkiewcz, Chris Mazzone, Giuseppe D'Agostino, Lindsay Halladay, Claudia Cristiano, Andrew Holmes, Tamas Kozicz, Lora Heisler, Thomas Kash*\n\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States\n\nBackground: Serotonin has long been thought to be involved in a variety of behaviors, however given the complexity of this system, it has been difficult to clearly delineate the circuits involved in various aspects of behavior. This is critical, as understand the circuits involved in the aversive actions of 5HT can lead to more effective drug treatment.\n\nMethods: Genetically modified mice were used in combination with a variety of cutting edge tools to probe 5HT circuits in the brain.\n\nResults: Using in vivo recordings during fear conditioning, we found that fluoxetine exposure during fear learning lead to alterations in neuronal firing in the BNST. This supported previously published results that the BNST is a critical site of action for the negative effects of acute SSRI. We next explored the impact of both optically evoked and bath applied 5HT on BNST neurons in a ex vivo slice preparation. Interestingly, we found that 5HT lead to recruitment of a local inhibitory circuit that suppressed outputs to both the hypothalamus and the ventral tegmental area. We then performed a series of in vivo experiments using chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to demonstrate that this circuit is required for 5HT induced aversion.\n\nConclusions: These results define the circuitry required for acute SSRI induced potentiation of fear. Moreover, we provide a pharmacological mechanism for mitigating this effect, suggesting new treatment modalities to minimize side effects of SSRI.\n\nKeywords: Serotonin, Fear conditioning, CRF\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW6. Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Activates Different Circuits in Male and Female Rats\n\nDebra Bangasser*, Kimberly Wiersielis, Sarah Cohen, Gerard Van Buskirk, Dominique Losen, Hamidou Keita, Joy Bergmann, Nausheen Baksh, Brittany Wicks\n\nTemple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States\n\nBackground: Stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression, occur twice as frequently in women as men. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) orchestrates the stress response and is hypersecreted in these disorders. Thus, sex differences in responses to CRF could contribute to the sex bias in disease prevalence. We previously identified sex differences in CRF1 receptor signaling and trafficking in the locus coeruleus (LC) that render LC neuronal responses to CRF greater in female than male rodents. However, the extent of sex differences in CRF sensitivity has not been systematically explored. Here we begin to address this question by examining how the central administration of CRF differentially activates stress-related brain regions in adult male and female rats.\n\nMethods: Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were surgically implanted with cannulas aimed at the lateral ventricle and allowed at least one week to recover during which vaginal cytology was collected to identify estrous cycle stage in females. Either vehicle (artificial cerebral spinal fluid) or ovine CRF (0.3 μg) was administered to females in the proestrus phase of the estrous cycle (higher estrogen and progesterone levels), females in the diestrus phase (lower estrogen and progesterone levels), and gonadally intact males. One hour later, tissue was collected and processed using standard immunohistochemical approaches to visualize the immediate early gene, cFOS. cFOS was quantified by a rater blind to the condition in regions known for their high levels of CRF receptor expression and/or their involvement in stress responses.\n\nResults: ANOVAs were used to reveal the effects of infusion and hormonal condition on the number of cFOS positive profiles in select brain regions. In several areas, including the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, medial prefrontal cortex, septum, dorsal hippocampus, and anterior-dorsal nuclei of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), the central CRF infusion increased the number of cFOS profiles compared to vehicle, regardless of sex {[F(1,49)=13.7, p=0.001], [F(1,42)=36.5, p<0.001], [F(1,46)=79.7, p<0.001], [F(1,35)=54.1, p<0.001], and [F(1,39)=80.6, p<0.001], respectively}. In comparison, a sex difference was observed for the locus coeruleus and oval nucleus of the BNST, such that CRF increased cFOS profiles in females relative to males {[F(1,25)=6.7, p<0.013] and [F(1,25)=4.3, p<0.048], respectively}. Surprisingly, in several brain regions, cFOS activation was altered in different estrous cycle phases in females and, in particular, diestrus females were distinguished from other groups. Specifically, diestrus females were the only group with increased cFOS profiles following CRF administration in the periaqueductal gray, ventral medial dorsal raphe, and lateral dorsal tegmental area {[F(2,39)=6.0, p=0.005], [F(2,45)=4.4, p=0.021], and [F(2,48)=3.73, p=0.031], respectively}.Conversely, in the nucleus basalis of meynert and nucleus accumbens, diestrus females were the only group with cFOS profiles unaffected by central CRF administration {[F(2,52)=5.9, p<0.01], [F(2,49)=3.7, p=.03], respectively}.\n\nConclusions: Collectively, these findings indicate that central CRF administration activates different circuits in males and females, and that differences are further revealed across the female estrous cycle. Surprisingly, although cFOS has been widely used, previous studies were almost exclusively conducted with male rats. Thus, sex differences in the activation of brain circuits by stressors, neuropeptides, and other stimuli, may be an important, but underexplored, determinant of sex differences in behavior and perhaps even pathology.\n\nKeywords: stress, sex difference, anxiety\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW7. Effects Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on Brain and Behavior During Fear Extinction Learning in Humans: A Combined Psychophysiological-fMRI Study\n\nStephanie Gorka*, Christine Rabinak, Mohammed Milad, Israel Liberzon, Stephen Maren, K. Luan Phan\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States\n\nBackground: Cannabinoid agonists such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may facilitate context-mediated learning and retention of fear extinction memories via their actions on hippocampal function. However, studies in humans have exclusively examined the effects of THC on responding to discrete fear cues (i.e., conditioned stimuli; CS) and it is unknown whether THC's target effect is on the memory for discrete cues and/or the environment that surround those cues (e.g., visual-spatial context). This question of specificity is important, especially in light of evidence suggesting that animals, including humans, rely heavily on context when appraising potential sources of danger.\n\nMethods: The current study examined the effects of THC on brain (i.e., blood-oxygen-level dependent [BOLD] signal) and behavioral fear responses (i.e., skin conductance response [SCR]) during a standard fear acquisition and extinction paradigm involving discrete conditioned fear cues (i.e., CS) viewed within a visual-spatial/environmental context (colored lights in front of a school or forest). Forty healthy adult volunteers completed four experimental sessions over the course of 10 days. On Day 1, subjects completed a fear acquisition (ACQ) paradigm within a specified visual-spatial context (Context A/school). On Day 2 (24-hours later), conditioned fear was extinguished (EXT) in a novel visual-spatial context (Context B/forest). Two hours prior to EXT, participants randomly received an oral dose of THC (n=18) or placebo (n=22). Recall of the extinction memory was tested 24-hours (RECALL1; Day 3) and 1-week (RECALL2; Day 10) after EXT in visual-spatial Context B. BOLD signal (assessed via functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) and SCRs were simultaneously collected during presentation of the visual-spatial context and CS across all four sessions. Self-reported expectancy of the unconditioned stimulus (i.e., US; brief, mild electric shock) was collected after presentation of every CS.\n\nResults: We confirmed that participants expected the US to a greater extent during presentation of the CS+ compared with the CS-, and during ACQ compared with EXT, RECALL 1, and RECALL 2. Thus, participants were able to accurately discriminate between the CS+ and CS-, and shock versus no-shock sessions. There were no effects of drug on US expectancy ratings. As for the CS+, results indicated that although there was a main effect of session for right amygdala activation (MNI peak: [28, 0, -24], Z=3.83, k=1640mm3, p<0.05; ACQ > EXT = RECALL 1 = RECALL 2), there were no main effects of drug or drug by session interactions for fMRI BOLD or SCRs. For the visual-spatial context, however, there was a main effect of session and a main effect of drug on bilateral hippocampal activation that was qualified by a significant drug x session interaction relatively specific to the hippocampus (right: MNI peak [20, -34, 6], Z=3.40, k=1472mm3, p <0.05, corrected; left: MNI peak[-14, -34, 10], Z=3.69, k=1072mm3, p <0.05, corrected). During EXT and both recall phases, the THC group exhibited greater hippocampal activation relative to the placebo group (ts >2.5, p < 0.05). Behaviorally, results also indicated an effect of drug on SCRs to the visual-spatial context such that individuals in the THC group exhibited lower SCRs to Context B during EXT and RECALL1 (ts>2.1, p<0.05), and RECALL 2 at a trend-level, compared with the placebo group.\n\nConclusions: Administration of THC did not impact responding to discrete cues but did enhance hippocampal response while dampening SCRs to repeated presentations of the visual-spatial context during EXT, RECALL 1, and RECALL 2 when the previously feared cue was re-represented in the absence of aversive stimuli (i.e., shock). This adds to a growing literature implicating the hippocampus in contextual memory processes and more importantly could suggest that THC, and potentially other CB1 agonists, facilitates and sustains the appraisal and recognition of safe environments via enhancement of hippocampal engagement. This mechanism holds promise for the treatment of individuals with anxiety and stress-related disorders as CB1 agonists may prove to be a useful cognitive enhancer adjunct to behavioral therapies that rely on extinction learning (to effectively discriminate danger from safety) and its retention across contexts.\n\nKeywords: Fear extinction, THC, Context, conditioned cue\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW8. Effects of Insulin and Diet-Induced-Obesity on Glutamatergic Transmission in the Nucleus Accumbens and Anxiety-Like Behaviors\n\nCarrie Ferrario*, Max Oginsky, Yanaira Alonso-Caraballo, Aaron Chadderdon, Peter Vollbrecht, Emily Jutkiewicz\n\nUniversity of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States\n\nBackground: Epidemiological data suggest that body mass index and obesity are strong risk factors for depression and anxiety. In rodents, diet-induced obesity produces depression-like behaviors in the forced swim, and sucrose preference tests, but the mechanism underlying this effect is poorly understood. Alterations in glutamatergic prefrontal cortical and amygdalar inputs to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are thought to contribute to depression and anxiety. Furthermore, obesity is accompanied by elevations in circulating insulin, and insulin receptor activation decreases excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus and the ventral tegmental area. However, no studies have examined the effect of insulin or the development of insulin resistance on NAc glutamatergic transmission, nor has the role of insulin-resistance in anxiety or depression been examined. Thus, we have begun a series of experiments to determine whether NAc glutamatergic transmission is affected by insulin, and to determine whether development of insulin-resistance contributes to depression- and anxiety-like behaviors.\n\nMethods: Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from medium spiny neurons in the NAc core during bath application of insulin (25, 50, 100, and 500 nM) and evoked excitatory post-synaptic potentials (eEPSCs) and spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs; 100 nM) were measured. The contribution of insulin receptors and insulin-like growth factor receptors (IGFR) to insulin's effects on EPSCs were determined using pharmacological approaches. For behavioral studies, male and female selectively bred obesity-prone and obesity-resistant rats were used. Anxiety-like behaviors were measured after spontaneous development of obesity in prone rats and after consumption of a high-fat diet in obesity-resistant and obesity-prone rats (60% high fat, 3 or 6 weeks). Food intake and weight gain were monitored throughout. Depressive-like behaviors were evaluated using the forced swim test at two different water depths after spontaneous weight gain in obesity-prone rats. Fasted plasma levels of insulin were used to determine metabolic dysfunction and body composition was determined using NMR.\n\nResults: Electrophysiological data showed that insulin reduced the eEPSC amplitude in medium spiny neurons of the NAc core. This effect was completely reversed after insulin wash out. Furthermore, insulin produced a marked reduction in sEPCS frequency, suggesting that its effects are mediated by reducing presynaptic glutamate release. In addition, when the IGFR antagonist picropodophyllotoxin (0.5 μM) was co-applied with insulin, the eEPSC amplitude increased. This suggests that reductions in glutamatergic transmission induced by insulin are mediated by the IGFR and that insulin receptor activation may produce opposing effects on excitatory transmission in the NAc. Ongoing studies are examining these effects of insulin after diet-induced obesity and the development of insulin resistance. In behavioral studies, obesity-prone rats gained substantially more weight and fat mass than obesity-resistant rats when maintained on standard lab chow, as expected. Anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze and open field tests were enhanced in obese male and female rats. Furthermore, the magnitude of these anxiety-like behaviors was positively correlated with weight gain. No pronounced differences in depressive-like behaviors were found between groups. Consumption of a 60% high-fat diet produced weight gain in obesity-resistant rats that was comparable to that of obesity-prone rats fed standard chow. Preliminary results suggest that diet-induced obesity may enhance anxiety-like behaviors even in obesity-resistant rats.\n\nConclusions: Current results suggest that insulin bi-directionally influences glutamatergic transmission in the NAc, with IGFR activation producing reductions in excitatory transmission and insulin receptor activation producing increases. These effects of insulin were reversed by insulin wash out, suggesting that insulin can dynamically regulate excitatory transmission in the NAc. This is in contrast to the VTA where insulin produces longer lasting reductions in excitatory transmission. Anxiety-like behaviors increased with the development of obesity in obesity-prone and obesity-resistant rats. Ongoing studies are examining the relationship between insulin-resistance and enhanced anxiety.\n\nKeywords: nucleus accumbens, glutamatergic transmission, anxiety, obesity, insulin\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW9. An Avoidance-Based Rodent Model of Exposure with Response Prevention Therapy\n\nJose Rodriguez-Romaguera, Benjamin Greenberg, Steven Rasmussen, Gregory Quirk*\n\nUniversity of Puerto Rico School of Medicine, San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\nBackground: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is treated with exposure with response prevention (ERP) therapy, in which patients are repeatedly exposed to compulsive triggers but prevented from expressing their compulsions. Many compulsions are an attempt to avoid perceived dangers, and the intent of ERP is to extinguish compulsions. Patients failing ERP therapy are candidates for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS), which facilitates patients' response to ERP therapy. An animal model of ERP would be useful for understanding neural mechanisms.\n\nMethods: Using a platform-mediated signaled avoidance task, we developed a rodent model of ERP called “extinction with response prevention (“Ext-RP”), in which rats are given extinction trials while blocking access to the avoidance platform. Following 3 days of Ext-RP, rats were tested with the platform unblocked to evaluate persistent avoidance. We then assessed if pharmacological inactivation of lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) or DBS of the ventral striatum reduced persistent avoidance.\n\nResults: Following Ext-RP training, most rats showed reduced avoidance at test (Ext-RP success), but a subset persisted in their avoidance (Ext-RP failure). Pharmacological inactivation of lOFC eliminated persistent avoidance, as did DBS applied to the VS during Ext-RP.\n\nConclusions: DBS of VS has been previously shown to inhibit OFC activity. Thus lOFC, which is known to be hyperactive in OCD, may be responsible for impairing patients' response to ERP therapy. This rodent model may be useful for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of ERP therapy.\n\nKeywords: OCD, Fear extinction, compulsion, DBS, orbitofrontal cortex\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW10. Anxious Temperament Related mRNA Expression Revealed by Sequencing RNA from the Central Nucleus of the Amygdala of 46 Non-Human Primates\n\nAndrew Fox*, Tade Souaiaia, Jonathan A. Oler, Jae Mun Kim, Joseph Nguyen, Patrick H. Roseboom, James A. Knowles, Ned Kalin\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States\n\nBackground: Anxious temperament (AT) during childhood is a risk factor for the later development of anxiety, depression, and comorbid substance abuse disorders. Children with an extremely anxious temperament (AT), react to novelty with increased behavioral inhibition and increased levels of physiological arousal. Our group has extensively validated a nonhuman primate model of early-life AT. We found that AT is stable over time, across contexts, and predicts inhibited social behavior naturalistic settings. Here, we combined RNA sequencing of targeted brain tissue, with brain imaging and behavioral assessments to investigate the molecular underpinnings of AT in the primate.\n\nThe non-human primate is an ideal model to investigate the molecular underpinnings of AT, because it allows researchers to leverage techniques that are possible in rodents alongside techniques that are more commonly used in humans. Our large-scale FDG-PET imaging studies of 592 young rhesus monkeys revealed a brain-wide network of regions to be associated with AT, which include the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce). The Ce is of particular interest because mechanistic studies demonstrate that damage to the Ce is sufficient to decrease the expression of AT. Moreover, as part of the extended amygdala, the Ce is connected, directly and indirectly, with regulatory and evaluative cortical regions, as well as the regions required to initiate defensive behavioral and physiological responses.\n\nMethods: To understand the molecular processes in the Ce that give rise to extreme AT and associated neural alterations, we assessed gene expression by sequencing the RNA from the Ce of 46 periadolescent male rhesus monkeys (mean age=3.3 years old). Gene expression is an ideal method for examining the molecular underpinnings of AT because it reflects the combination of genetic and environmental influences that underlie an anxious brain.\n\nWe examined Ce gene expression using RNA-seq in combination with assessments of behavior, physiology, and multi-modal brain imaging. AT was assessed in response to the potentially threatening no-eye-contact (NEC) condition of the human intruder paradigm, using a composite of increased behavioral inhibition, decreased vocalizations, and increased cortisol. Brain function and structure were assessed using NEC-related 18FDG-PET, rsfMRI and DTI. RNA-Seq was performed using NuGEN Ovation RNA-Seq v2 libraries on Illumina DNA sequencers with ∼30 million 100bp reads per animal. Using regression techniques, we examined variation in Ce mRNA expression in relation to individual differences in AT, as well as structural and functional imaging measures. Building on our previous work, in this study we examined transcript features, such as exons, introns, and splice junctions in relation to AT. To optimize the reliability of our analyses, initial analyses were restricted to features where we mapped an average of at least 50 reads with at least one read in each animal.\n\nResults: Results demonstrated that AT was associated with Ce expression levels of 142 features at a p<.005 threshold, where we mapped over 50 reads. These features represent 119 different genes, where expression of all or part of the transcript was associated with individual differences in AT. Consistent with our prior work suggesting an important role for Ce neuroplasticity in AT, AT-related transcripts encoded molecules involved in mechanisms associated with neuroplasticity and synaptic restructuring (e.g. MAP kinase pathway). For example, we found that a feature of ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 90kDa, polypeptide 3 (RPS6KA3, also known as RSK2), as well as multiple features of amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein (APP) and tropomyosin 3 (TPM3), all of which are involved in synaptic remodeling, were negatively associated with AT. Interestingly, additional analyses revealed differential relationships between the levels of these transcripts and metabolism throughout the AT-neural network. For example, increased TPM3 feature expression was negatively associated with AT-related brain metabolism in the brainstem (p<.005), whereas increased APP feature expression was negatively associated with AT-related prefrontal/insular metabolism and intra-amygdala functional connectivity as assessed with rsfMRI (p's<.005).\n\nConclusions: Understanding the molecular functions that give rise to heightened dispositional anxiety is an important step toward developing novel behavioral and pharmacological treatments for early-life anxiety. In particular, insights into the Ce molecules that give rise to dispositional anxiety and its associated brain alterations will provide novel information about both the cellular composition and behavior of neurons within the Ce of highly anxious individuals. The current data provide evidence for novel mechanisms underlying neuroplastic processes within the Ce that may mediate the early-life risk to develop anxiety, depression, and comorbid substance abuse disorders. A refined understanding of these mechanisms will provide a framework for developing novel treatments aimed at preventing children with an extreme dispositional anxiety from the life-long suffering that is associated with stress-related psychopathology.\n\nKeywords: Anxiety, RNA-seq, Positron emission tomography, fMRI resting state, Nonhuman Primates\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW11. Atypical Salience-Default Mode Network Interactions in Pediatric Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: A Compensatory Role?\n\nKate Fitzgerald*, Yanni Liu, Robert Welsh, Gregory Hanna, Stephan Taylor\n\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States\n\nBackground: The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral anterior insula (aI), represent a key nodes within a salience network that activates in response to cognitively relevant events (e.g., interference between competing response options), but remains connected even at rest. Previous functional neuroimaging work in pediatric and adult OCD has found atypical interactions between the salience network and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region known to mediate the affective valuation of external stimuli that is incorporated within a widely distribute network for internal mentation or “default mode” function. At present, however, it remains unknown whether atypical interaction between salience and default mode networks represents a marker for pathology (e.g., etiologic) or compensation (e.g., adaptive) in OCD. To address this gap in knowledge, we tested the relationship of OCD symptom severity with connectivity between salience network and vmPFC. We reasoned that a pathologic role would be supported if OCD severity was positively associated with atypical salience network-vmPFC interactions, whereas a compensatory role would be supported if atypical connectivity and OCD severity were negatively associated.\n\nMethods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was collected in 69 patients with pediatric (13.9 +/- 2.8 years, range 8-19) during the Multi-Source Interference Task. Correct incongruent and correct congruent trials were contrasted to derive functionally defined seeds in dACC (12 mm sphere centered at -3, 8, 49) and bilateral aI (12 mm spheres centered at 45, 17, -5 on right, -30, 17, 4 on left). To examine intrinsic functional connectivity, the time series from these seeds were extracted from a general linear model that regressed out task condition, yielding a residual time series used as a covariate (as well as movement parameters and age) in a separate model that again included all task event regressors to examine positive and negative correlations between seed regions and other voxels in the brain. These correlations are described as intrinsic connectivity because this method identifies interregional coupling that is independent of and linearly superimposed upon event-related activity. Finally, OCD severity, as rated on the Child Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS), was regressed onto connectivity maps for each seed.\n\nResults: Consistent with prior literature, positive connectivity maps for dACC and bilateral aI seeds defined the salience network, whereas negative connectivity maps showed anti-correlations between these seeds with vmPFC and posterior cingulate cortex (i.e., default mode network). Bilateral aI connectivity with vmPFC (-6, 44, -8; k = 99, Z = 3.40) was inversely correlated with OCD severity. Inverse correlation of OCD severity and dACC connectivity showed a similarly located, but much smaller vmPFC cluster (-3, 41, -17; k = 15, Z = 3.01). There were no other inverse and no positive associations of OCD severity and SN seed connectivity with vmPFC or any other default mode network region (e.g., PCC). Of note, activation of the left aI seed region to the interference task was associated positively with aI-vmPFC connectivity (r = .25, p = .04), and inversely associated with OCD severity (r = -.24, p = .05). A Sobel test suggested aI-vmPFC connectivity to mediate the inverse relation of left aI response to interference and OCD severity (Sobel statistic 1.7 +/- 0.60 p = .09).\n\nConclusions: Pediatric OCD has been previously characterized by atypical interactions between the salience and default mode networks. In this sample, greater connectivity of salience network, particularly the bilateral aI, with the vmPFC default mode region was associated with lower OCD symptom severity. This finding suggests that atypical aI-vmPFC connectivity in OCD may enable young patients to more effectively resist obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges. Studies of young patients before and after treatment are needed to establish whether increases in salience-default mode network connectivity drive reduction in symptom severity.\n\nKeywords: salience network, obsessive compulsive disorder, default mode network\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW12. Heightened Sensitivity to Emotional Expressions in Generalized Anxiety Disorder Compared to Social Anxiety Disorder and Controls\n\nEric Bui*, Eric Anderson, Elizabeth Goetter, Allison Campbell, Lisa Feldman Barrett, Naomi Simon\n\nHarvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: Few studies have examined potential differences between social anxiety disorder (SAD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in the sensitivity to detect emotional expressions. The present study aims to compare the detection of emotional expressions in SAD and GAD.\n\nMethods: Participants with a primary diagnosis of GAD (n=46; Mean (SD) age = 40.5 (14.2); 45.7% (n=21) females), SAD (n=70; Mean (SD) age = 33.8% (12.3); 38.6% (n=27) females), and controls (n=118; Mean (SD) age = 40.4 (13.0); 49.2% (n=58) females) were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (First, 1994), and the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (Montgomery and Asberg, 1979), and completed a morph movies task. The task presented faces expressing increasing degrees of emotional intensity, slowly changing from a neutral to a full-intensity happy (20 trials), sad (20 trials), or angry (20 trials) expression (Niedenthal, et al. 2000). Participants are instructed to use a slide bar to view the movie frames from left to right, and to stop at the first frame where they perceive an emotion. Their decision is recorded on a scale of 1-100 (1=fully ‘neutral' to 99=fully ‘emotional' expression). The frame selected thus indicates the intensity of emotion required to identify the facial expression.\n\nResults: We conducted a mixed-model repeated measures ANOVA, with expression (angry, happy, sad) as the repeated measure, diagnosis as the between subjects factor, and the frame at which the movie was stopped as the dependent variable. Because sphericity assumptions were not met (Mauchly's W=0.658; p<.001), Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied. After inclusion of age, race, and depressive symptom severity as covariates, both the main effect of diagnosis, F(2, 402)=3.0, p<.05, and the main effect of expression in the movie, F(2, 402)=623.5, p<.001 were significant, while the interaction between the two factors was not, F(4, 402)=1.65, p=.18. Bonferroni post-hoc tests revealed that all groups required the smaller number of frames to detect happy expressions, followed by angry expressions, and the greatest number of frames to detect for sad expressions. The GAD group also detected faces at a lower frame than SAD (p=.002) and controls (p=.039).\n\nConclusions: Because our design did not allow differentiation of sensitivity to emotion or more simple differences in facial information, we cannot rule out that participants may have rated visual changes in general (i.e., merely detected facial contrasts). However, findings suggest that individuals with GAD exhibit greater sensitivity to perception of facial emotions than those with SAD or controls.\n\nKeywords: Emotion Perception, social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW13. From Relief to Safety: Omission-Induced Activation of the Nucleus Accumbens in Fear Conditioning and Extinction\n\nBram Vervliet*, Marie-France Marin, David Song, Mohammed Milad\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: Unexpected omission of an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) gives rise to a relief prediction error signal (RPE) that promotes safety learning, like fear extinction. Despite numerous studies on the neurocircuitry of fear extinction learning and recall in the human brain, few studies have looked at neural correlates of RPE. Based on theories that link relief to reward, we expected to find reward-related activations to unexpected US omissions during non-reinforced conditioning trials (partial reinforcement), as well as during early extinction trials (when US omission is surprising) but less so during later extinction trials (when US omission should be fully expected).\n\nMethods: Data from healthy control participants from two separate studies were combined to examine RPE-related activations (N = 33). All participants were clinically screened for current or past psychiatric diagnosis (exclusion criterion), and underwent a well-validated fear conditioning and extinction protocol in the fMRI scanner. Conditioning comprised 10 CS+/US trials, 6 CS+/noUS trials and 16 CS-/noUS trials; the extinction phase comprised 16 CS+/noUS and 16 CS-/noUS trials. In order to detect RPE-related activity, we contrasted nonreinforced CS+ offset versus CS- offset during conditioning and early extinction (first four trials). As control comparisons in which no RPE-related activations were expected, we contrasted CS+ onset versus CS- onset during conditioning, and CS+ offset versus CS- offset during late extinction (last four trials).\n\nResults: The CS+ offset versus CS- offset contrast revealed significant activation of the right nucleus accumbens (NAc) during nonreinforced conditioning trials and significant activation of the left NAc during early extinction trials. The control comparisons revealed no NAc activations, as predicted.\n\nConclusions: Our conditioning and extinction data show augmented NAc activation during unexpected US-omissions, but not during expected US-omissions nor during US-anticipations. Together, these data suggest a role for the NAc in RPE processing, a putative teaching signal for fear extinction learning. These results add to a growing body of evidence on the involvement of the reward neurocircuitry in fear extinction, both in pharmacological and lesioning studies in animals as well as in pharmacological and neuroimaging studies in humans. This spotlights the reward neurocircuitry as a potential target for interventions that are aimed at enhancing fear extinction learning, and ultimately exposure-based treatments of clinical anxiety.\n\nKeywords: Fear conditioning, fear extinction, reward prediction error, Nucleus Accumbens\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW14. Genetic Influences on Resting EEG Alpha Power in an American Indian Tribe\n\nMary-Anne Enoch*, Colin Hodgkinson, Pei-Hong Shen, Qiaoping Yuan, David Goldman\n\nNational Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholisms, Bethesda, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: The electroencephalogram (EEG) records the rhythmical, electrical activity of the brain that is constantly changing depending on mental activity, relaxation, drowsiness and sleep. This dynamic process is therefore an index of cortical activation, cognitive function and consciousness. Resting EEG phenotypes are highly heritable, stable traits. In the healthy awake adult two rhythms, alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) dominate the resting EEG. The alpha rhythm is maximal posteriorly under conditions of eyes-closed relaxation and mental inactivity. Higher alertness attenuates or suppresses the alpha rhythm which is then supplanted by desynchronized low voltage fast activity. Because the resting EEG is an indicator of cortical activation it may be regarded as an intermediate phenotype for complex behaviors in which arousal is implicated, such as anxiety, depression and addiction. Therefore candidate genes for the resting EEG are likely to include stress-related genes influencing arousal-related behavior.\n\nMethods: Male and female participants were recruited from a Plains Indian tribe living in rural Oklahoma. The resting EEG was recorded from six scalp electrodes: FZ (frontal-central), P3, PZ, P4 (parietal central, left and right), and O1 and O2 (occipital left and right). All results are for eyes closed, normalized (log10 transformed) resting EEG spectral power. This study focused on alpha power recorded at the PZ electrode where it was maximal. Stress-related genes implicated in the HPA axis, GABAergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and cannabinoid systems were selected with an emphasis on common, functional polymorphisms and haplotype analyses. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina GoldenGate platform. EEG and genotyping data was available for 312 Plains Indians.\n\nResults: Alpha power decreased significantly with age (p < 0.005) therefore age was included as a covariate in all analyses. There were significant CRHBP SNP and haplotype effects on alpha power; minor homozygotes were associated with increased alpha power. There was no effect of CRHR1. Within the GABAergic system, the functional GPHN SNP rs3784075 predicted alpha power but the GABRA2 splice variant rs279827 did not. Analyses are underway for GAD1, GAD2, GABRG2 and GABBR1 SNPs / haplotypes. Within the serotonergic system, the functional SLC6A4 SNP rs3813034 and the functional HTR3B missense variant rs1176744 both predicted alpha power. The cannabinoid system FAAH rs324420 functional missense variant was also significantly associated with alpha power. In all cases, the minor allele / homozygote was associated with increased alpha power. These genetic variants together accounted for 13% of the variance in alpha power at PZ.\n\nConclusions: Our preliminary results confirm the hypothesis that variation in stress-related genes predicts resting EEG alpha power that is an indicator of cortical activation and an intermediate phenotype for arousal related behaviors.\n\nKeywords: CRHBP, GPHN, SLC6A4, HTR3B, FAAH\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW15. Chemogenetic Elucidation of the Role of the Orexin System in Panic-Associated Behavior and Physiology\n\nPhilip Johnson*, Cristian Bernabe, Lauren Federici, Stephanie Fitz, Asmaa Mahoui, Andrei Molosh, Seema Bhatnagar, Anantha Shekhar\n\nIndiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States\n\nBackground: Discovered in 1998, the neuropeptide orexin (AKA hypocretin) is critical for arousal, but orexinergic neurons are concentrated in the perifornical hypothalamus (PeF) region, which when stimulated elicits panic-associated behavior and cardiovascular responses in rodents and self reports of \"panic attacks\" in humans. A number of studies support a role for the orexin system in coordinating defensive behavioral and physiological stress responses. This is based on evidence in rodents that orexin neurons are highly reactive to anxiogenic stimuli; have strong projections to anxiety and panic-associated circuitry; selective pharmacological blockade or gene silencing of orexin neurotransmission block stress-induced panic-like responses; and patients with panic responses show increased CSF levels of orexin. However, no study has selectively excited this subset of orexin neurons in conscious, behaving animals while assessing panic-associated behaviors and physiology.\n\nMethods: Here we used chemogenetic techniques to stimulate PeF orexin neurons using DREADD technology [Designer Receptor (an inert Muscarinic 3 receptor coupled to a Gq protein, Musc3Gqr) Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (inert clozapine-n-oxide, CNO)]. We injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) under the orexin promotor into the PeF, which selectively induced expression of the excitatory M3GqR with a mCitrine fluorescent reporter on ∼80-90% of local orexin neurons.\n\nResults: Using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology we verified that bath applications of CNO induced long lasting membrane depolarization and action potentials on Musc3GqR positive neurons in the PeF. In subsequent experiments we then repeated the AAV injections into the PeF and determined that rats systemically treated with CNO displayed robust activation of flight and escape associated behaviors accompanied by panic-associated cardioexcitation. CNO treated rats also had dramatic increases in cellular c-Fos responses in orexin immunoreactive neurons and resulted in activation of key efferent targets implicated in panic and anxiety (e.g., noradrenergic locus ceruleus and serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons).\n\nConclusions: Chemogenetic excitation of orexin neurons mobilizes an integrative panic response, further supporting that orexin receptor antagonists could represent a novel therapeutic target for treating emotional and physiological symptoms associated with severe anxiety disorders (e.g., panic attacks).\n\nKeywords: orexin, panic, pharmacogenetic, DREADD, Anxiety\n\nDisclosures: This research was made possible in part by a NIA K01 award (1K01AG044466) to PLJ as well as a KL2 and pilot grant award to PLJ from the Indiana CTSI (UL1 RR025760 and RR025761, respectively); and a NIMH R01 MH52619 and R01 MH65702 to AS.

A Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor, SNRI, Improves Reproductive Function in Anxious, Stress-Sensitive Female Monkeys with Stress Induced Infertility\n\nKevin Todd, Sarah Burns, Tina Liu, Matthew Ragoza, Neal Ryan, Cynthia Bethea, Judy Cameron*\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States\n\nBackground: In response to everyday life stresses, some women stop ovulating and are infertile (i.e., are stress-sensitive, SS), while others retain normal ovulatory reproductive function (i.e., are stress-resilient, SR). Female cynomolgus monkeys who have monthly menstrual cycles like women, are also SS or SR. SS animals exhibit a greater number of anxious behaviors compared to SR animals. SS animals also have lower serotonin mRNA levels and lower serotonin secretion in nonstressed conditions. As both SSRI's and SNRI's are common medications used to treat anxiety, here we examined whether the SSRI escitalopram (CIT) or the SNRI reboxetine (REB) would improve fertility. We also explored whether there were sleep differences in SS vs. SR animals and whether CIT or REB treatment would alter sleep.\n\nMethods: Twenty-seven female cynomolgus monkeys were given daily CIT (20 mg, B.I.D.) through a non-stressed menstrual cycle and two cycles of stress exposure. The experiment was then repeated with daily REB (2 mg, B.I.D.) treatment. The stress paradigm involved the psychosocial stress of moving to a new housing room + the metabolic stresses of mild diet + mild exercise, to model the type of everyday life stresses experienced by women who display stress-induced infertility. Monkeys also wore collar-mounted activity monitors (Actical, Philips Respironics Inc., Bend, OR) to monitor sleep patterns. A standardized anxiety test, The Human Intruder Test (HIT) was performed to assess levels of two anxious behaviors: agitation and reactivity, for each monkey.\n\nResults: Five monkeys were categorized as SS and 18 were categorized as SR, with 4 remaining monkeys showing characteristics of both categories. SS animals had significantly lower levels of the reproductive hormone, progesterone, in the luteal phase of a control menstrual cycle with no stress (SS: 0.65±0.18 ng/ml; SR: 4.99±0.72 ng/ml; p=0.01). CIT treatment did not improve reproductive function under stress conditions. However, REB treatment led to a significant increase in progesterone secretion in control conditions of no stress (SS: 5.75±1.4 ng/ml, p=0.036) and prevented stress-induced suppression of progesterone secretion in SS animals (SS: control cycle vs. stress cycle, p=0.552). No significant differences in nighttime sleep were apparent in SS vs. SR monkeys. However, there was a significant correlation (R=-0.484, p=0.019) between reactivity and time awake before light, such that monkeys showing the characteristic of low reactivity (a trait associated with anxious characteristics) had significantly earlier morning waking, as well as a trend toward falling asleep later (R=-0.385, p=0.07). The relationships between anxious behaviors and sleep indices were not apparent after REB treatment.\n\nConclusions: REB treatment is highly effective in improving reproductive hormone secretion in SS animals both in control conditions and during stress. We conclude that SNRI's hold promise for the treatment of stress-induced infertility in anxious, stress-sensitive patients.\n\nKeywords: sleep disturbance, anxiety disorders, infertility\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW17. Prospective Study of Conditioned Fear and Extinction Learning Performance as a Risk Factor for PTSD in Active Duty Marines\n\nVictoria Risbrough*, Dean Acheson, Dewleen Baker, Caroline Nievergelt, Mark Geyer\n\nUniversity of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States\n\nBackground: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a major public health concern. To develop effective prevention and treatment strategies, identifying the underlying biological mechanisms contributing to risk for PTSD and symptom development will be critical for the advancement of treatment and prevention strategies. PTSD patients exhibit disruptions in fear conditioning processes, including increased fear expression, reduced discrimination between threat cues and safety cues (safety-signal learning) and reduced fear extinction. We have previously shown that safety-signal learning and fear extinction are disrupted in participants currently endorsing PTSD symptoms but not general anxiety or depressive symptoms (Acheson et al. 2015). Whether these disruptions in learned fear processes are preexisting risk factors or develop only after trauma is still unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that conditioned fear, safety-signal learning and fear extinction performance are pre-existing factors associated with risk of development of PTSD.\n\nMethods: The “Marine Resiliency Study II” (MRS-II; Oct 2011-Oct 2013) Neurocognition project is a prospective, longitudinal study of behavioral and biological markers of PTSD risk in Marines deployed to Afghanistan. As part of this investigation, Marines and Navy corpsmen underwent a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm using fear potentiated startle and psychiatric symptom assessments prior to deployment and again 4-6 months after returning from a 7-9 month deployment. PTSD, general anxiety and depression were measured by the clinician administered PTSD scale (CAPS) and Beck Anxiety or Depression Indexes respectively. To test the hypothesis that safety-signal learning and fear extinction are pre-existing risk factors for development of PTSD, we limited our analyses to participants that endorsed minimal PTSD, anxiety and mood symptoms at pre-deployment (N=694).\n\nResults: Participants that developed PTSD symptoms after combat deployment (N=33) had significantly less safety-signal learning at their pre-deployment assessment compared to those that did not develop PTSD symptoms after deployment (N=644; F(2,690)=5.79, p<.004). Participants that developed PTSD symptoms after deployment showed no differences in pre-deployment measures of fear conditioning or extinction learning compared to those that remained healthy after deployment.\n\nConclusions: Poor discrimination between threat and safety-signals may be a risk factor for development of PTSD symptoms after combat trauma. These findings support future research exploring training approaches to enhance safety vs. threat discrimination as a prophylactic strategy for those at risk for PTSD. Second, these prospective data are consistent with twin studies showing that decreased fear extinction and increased fear conditioning are not pre-existing risk factors for PTSD. Overall these findings indicate that there are dissociable fear-learning processes that are preexisting risk factors vs. indicators of symptom state for PTSD which can inform our understanding of the etiology of this devastating disorder.\n\nKeywords: PTSD, Fear extinction, Fear conditioning, acoustic startle, at-risk\n\nDisclosures: This work was supported by a grant from Navy BUMED.

Decrease in Thalamic Volumes of Refractory Patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder who Were Submitted to Gamma Ventral Capsulotomy\n\nDouglas Costa, Marcelo Batistuzzo, Fabio Duran, Benjamin Greenberg, Miguel Canteras, Roseli Shavitt, Andre Gentil, Euripedes Miguel, Antonio Lopes, Marcelo Hoexter*\n\nUniversity of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil\n\nBackground: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic condition and has a lifetime prevalence of 2% to 3% in the general population. A small proportion of patients with OCD have severe and disabling symptoms, despite all available conventional treatments. For such individuals, psychiatric neurosurgical procedures are an alternative. In particular, gamma ventral capsulotomy (GVC) has shown promising results. However, few studies have assessed whole brain morphometric changes after GVC for the treatment of refractory OCD. Thus, the aim of this study is to describe cerebral volumetric changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from patients before and after this procedure, using a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach.\n\nMethods: Pre- and 1-year postoperative structural MRI data from 11 refractory OCD patients (mean age ± standard deviation: 32.4 years ± 9.3) submitted to GVC were collected. Structural MRI was also collected from 22 healthy controls (mean age ± standard deviation: 31.1 years ± 7.7). Gray matter volumes were assessed with a 1.5-T MRI scanner, spatially normalized, and segmented with VBM. Between and within-group statistical comparisons were performed with the general linear model. Findings in a priori predicted regions (orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, caudate/putamen and thalamus) were reported as significant if surviving family-wise error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons (p<0.05) over the respective ROI, with voxel clusters comprising at least 20 voxels. For unpredicted findings in other grey matter regions, we used the FWE-corrected p < 0.05 level over the whole brain. MNI gray matter voxel coordinates were transformed into the Talairach and Tournoux system.\n\nResults: Preoperative OCD patients presented greater GM volume in the right orbitofrontal cortex compared to controls (47 voxels, peak coordinates x= 18, y=34, z=-20, peak voxel p<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons over the region of interest). One-year after surgery, postoperative OCD patients showed smaller GM volume in the bilateral thalamus (438 voxels, peak coordinates x= 4, y=-12, z= 4, peak voxel p=0.028, corrected for multiple comparisons over the entire brain). Within-group comparisons (pre- versus and 1-year postoperative) revealed that GM volume in the bilateral thalamus decreased (left thalamus: 172 voxels, peak coordinates x= -6, y=-10, z= 6, peak voxel p=0.006; right thalamus: 208 voxels, peak coordinates x= 8, y=-12, z= 6, peak voxel p=0.001, both corrected for multiple comparisons over the region of interest).\n\nConclusions: Our results support the current theory of frontal-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuitry involvement in OCD physiopathology. GVC is associated with neurobiological changes in the thalamus in refractory OCD patients.\n\nKeywords: Human Neuroimaging, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, voxel-based morphometry (VBM), neurosurgery\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW19. Myo-Inositol Reduction in Medial Prefrontal Cortex of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: A Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Study\n\nMarcelo Batistuzzo*, Marcelo Hoexter, Fabiana Costa, Roseli Shavitt, Antonio Lopes, Carolina Cappi, Alice de Mathis, Natasha Senço, Anke Henning, Bruno Pastorello, Claudia Leite, Euripedes Miguel, Maria Otaduy\n\nPsychiatric Institute HC-FMUSP, São Paulo, Brazil\n\nBackground: Recent studies indicate that patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) present abnormal levels of glutamate (GLU), glutamine (GLN) and γ–aminobutyric acid (GABA) in frontal and striatal regions. These abnormalities could be related to deficits in cortico-striatal circuits described in neuroimaging literature. But there is still no consensus about the role of the glutamatergic cycle in OCD, since other studies did not observe any differences in GLU (GLX) concentrations in OCD. GLU, GLN and GABA are metabolites of very difficult detection by conventional proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS), given its low signal and partial overlap with other metabolites. In this study we propose to use a two-dimensional JPRESS 1H MRS sequence, that allows the discrimination of overlapping metabolites by observing the differences in J-coupling (second dimension of the spectrum), leading to a higher accuracy of all metabolites in the brain, including GABA, GLU and GLN. The objective of this study is to use 2D-JPRESS sequence to identify the alterations of neurometabolism present in OCD.\n\nMethods: Twenty one OCD patients (mean age 34.7y [range 19-58y]) and 14 healthy controls (HC, mean age 31.9y [range 18-47y]) were evaluated with a 3T Achieva Philips MRI scanner. Symptom severity of OCD was measured with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). All participants also filled the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. We used ProFit 2.0 Matlab program to quantify creatine (Cr), N-acetyl-aspartate, glutathione, myo-inositol (MI), lactate, GABA, GLN, and GLU. The voxel was situated in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and varied from 2x2x2cm3 to 2.5x2.5x2.5cm3. We used FSL routines to segment voxel content into percentages of gray matter (GM%), white matter (WM%), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF%) and metabolite concentrations were corrected for different voxel composition. Statistics were performed with SPSS: each metabolite was entered as a dependent variable in an univariate linear model with group as the fixed factor and age, and sex as covariates. For correlation analysis, we used Pearson correlation and Pearson partial correlation, controlling for CSF% (two-tailed). Comparisons of demographic data (age and sex) were performed with student t-test and chi-squared.\n\nResults: Groups did not differ for sex (patients: 12 male / 9 female; HC: 8 male / 6 female), age, GM%, WM% or CSF% (all p-values > 0.05), but significantly differ in terms of depression and anxiety symptoms (both BDI and BAI p-values < 0.002). All patients were free of medication at the time of the scan and the mean Y-BOCS score was 27.9 + 6.1.\n\nThere were no between-group differences regarding GLU, GLN or GABA, but OCD patients showed lower levels of MI (p = 0.006, corrected for Bonferroni multiple comparisons correction). Moreover, we did not observe any correlation between levels of the metabolites evaluated and clinical data (Y-BOCS, BDI or BAI) in the OCD group.\n\nConclusions: We did not find differences in absolute values of GLU, GLN or GABA between OCD patients and HC. On the other hand, MI was decreased in the mPFC of OCD patients. Our findings are in line with other negative studies in the literature on regards to GLU, GLN and GABA levels that have used different 1H MRS sequences to measure these metabolites. Even measuring isolated levels of GLU we could not find evidences that support the glutamatergic hypothesis for OCD. Regarding MI, our results also corroborate previous investigations of the involvement of MI in the physiopathology of OCD: one study presented MI decreases in childhood and adolescent OCD in a brain region similar to ours (anterior cingulate cortex) and the other showed a negative correlation between MI levels in the orbitofrontal cortex and symptom severity. Together, these findings highlight the importance of inositol in the neurobiology of OCD. An important limitation was the relative small sample size of groups, in particular the HC group. Future studies with larger sample sizes should investigate the role of inositol in OCD, whether it could be a good treatment predictor or if it could play a role in OCD symptoms improvement.\n\nKeywords: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, MRS, myoinositol\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW20. Early Emergence of Fear Learning in the Selectively-Bred Anxious Rat Phenotype\n\nDa-Jeong Chang, Joanna Hider, Regina Sullivan, Huda Akil, Jacek Debiec*\n\nMolecular & Behavioral Neuroscience Institute/University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States\n\nBackground: Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood affecting around 10% of youth (Kessler et al., 2005). Maladaptive anxiety emerges early in life and disturbs child's psychosocial functioning and development. It is generally accepted that anxiety disorders are caused by a combination of inborn/hereditary and environmental factors. One of the best studied inborn risk factors for anxiety disorders in youth is anxious temperament whereas one of the best known environmental risk factors for anxiety disorders is a history of emotional trauma in childhood. Fear conditioning is the most commonly used experimental model of emotional trauma. In fear conditioning a neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS), such as neutral sound or odor is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), typically a mild electric shock. As a result, an organism expresses threat responses such as freezing upon subsequent exposures to the CS. Previous studies show that fear conditioning in rodents is naturally attenuated until postnatal day (PN) 10 (Landers & Sullivan, 2014). However, the ontogeny of fear learning in phenotypically anxious animals is mostly unknown.\n\nMethods: To study the ontogeny of fear conditioning in the anxious phenotype, we used a selectively-bred anxiety-prone rat model, in which spontaneous anxiety-like behaviors emerge as early as at PN 11 (Maras et al., SFN Abstracts, 2014). Sprague-Dawley (SD) PN 4 rat pups selectively-bred for anxiety received 11 US electric shocks (0.4 mA, 1 s) to the tail, either paired with a CS peppermint odor (30 s) (Paired), or unpaired (Unpaired). Additional control group included selectively-bred anxious PN 4 pups that received 11 CS presentations (CS Only). Other controls were wild-type SD pups matched for age and experimental conditions (Paired, Unpaired and CS Only).\n\nResults: At PN 11, all pups were re-exposed to 3 CSs and their behavior was videorecorded and scored for freezing. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant differences in freezing among the wild type animals (p>0.05), a finding consistent with previous studies using similar training parameters (Landers & Sullivan, 2014). However, the anxiety-prone Paired pups showed significantly higher levels of freezing as compared to the control groups (Unpaired and CS Only pups expressed comparable levels of freezing) (ANOVA: F(3,46)=16.51; p<0.0001; post hoc: p<0.05).\n\nConclusions: This pattern of results demonstrates that fear conditioning in phenotypically anxious pups occurs very early in life, before they spontaneously express anxious behaviors at PN 11, and before the emergence of adult-like fear conditioning in wild-type rats at PN 10. In subsequent experiments we characterized the neuroendocrine mechanisms of infant fear learning in phenotypically anxious rats. Elucidating the mechanisms of early fear learning will contribute to the development of novel preventive and treatment interventions.\n\nKeywords: Fear conditioning, anxiety, developmental\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW21. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Common Genetic Variants Affect Subcortical Brain Volumes in Recent Military Veterans\n\nSarah Lancaster, Melanie Garrett, Courtney Haswell, Mid-Atlantic MIRECC Workgroup, Christine Marx, Michael Hauser, Allison Ashley-Koch, Rajendra Morey*\n\nDuke University, Durham, North Carolina, United States\n\nBackground: To date, several studies have performed whole genome association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic markers related to PTSD. Other groups have utilized GWAS to identify genetic markers that affect brain volumes in healthy subjects as well as some psychiatric groups, such as schizophrenia. However, GWAS of regional brain volumes in PTSD has not been previously examined.\n\nMethods: Participants included 157 military veterans of recent US conflicts who were recruited from the Mid-Atlantic Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC) Repository for the Study of Post-Deployment Mental Health. The cohort consisted of 74 non-Hispanic black (NHB) and 83 non-Hispanic white (NHW) participants. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) was administered to assess presence of Axis I disorders. The patient group included Veterans with PTSD with or without comorbid Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The control group consisted of Veterans with no Axis I diagnoses or with MDD alone. There were 91 subjects in the control group and 66 in the patient group. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS) was administered to 152 participants. Exposure to childhood trauma was assessed with the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ).\n\nStructural MRI was acquired on one of two scanners: GE MR750 3T or GE EXCITE HD 3T. T1-weighted images were automatically segmented into 16 subcortical regions with Freesurfer 5.3. The protocol established by the ENIGMA Consortium was used for processing and quality control of imaging data. GWAS data have been described previously (Ashley-Koch et al., 2015). Briefly, genotypes were assayed using one of three platforms: Illumina HumanHapMap650 Beadchip, Illumina Human1M-Duo Beadchip and Illumina HumanOmni2.5 Beadchip. The 1000 Genomes Project was used to impute missing genotypes for a concordant set of probes in the dataset. Samples were pre-phased with SHAPEIT, and IMPUTE2 was used to impute genotypes. Linear regression assuming an additive genetic model was carried out controlling for age, sex, intracranial volume (ICV), population substructure, dichotomous PTSD diagnosis, and childhood trauma as covariates.\n\nResults: Genome-wide significance was achieved for several SNPs in four regions: right lateral ventricle, right caudate, right pallidum, and right accumbens. The right lateral ventricle was associated with SNPs in a region near translocation associated membrane protein 1-like 1 (TRAM1L1), which has previously been linked to alcohol dependence. One downstream variant within 500 base pairs of TRAM1L1 was significant (rs12152563). The right caudate was associated with intergenic SNPs on chromosome 6 as well as an intron-variant within NKAIN3 (rs34720850). The right pallidum was associated with an intron variant in Transmembrane Protein 132D (TMEM132D) on chromosome 12 (rs55685119). The right accumbens was associated with LINC01522, a non-coding RNA on chromosome 20 (rs55886168), intron variants in transmembrane protease, serine 15 (TMPRSS15) on chromosome 21 (rs2824791 and rs2824788), and intergenic SNPs on chromosomes 4, 6, 11 and 20.\n\nThere was no difference in age (p=0.51), gender (p=0.27), or ICV (p=0.96) between the control and PTSD groups. The total categories of childhood trauma was greater in the PTSD group than the control group (p=0.04) prompting its inclusion as a covariate.\n\nConclusions: Despite a small sample size, genome-wide significance was achieved. Intermediate phenotypes from neuroimaging may be more powerful for examining PTSD and other psychiatric diagnosis than clinically assessed diagnostic phenotypes alone. Replication of our findings is required.\n\nKeywords: PTSD, GWAS, Human Neuroimaging, brain volumes, combat veteran\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW22. A Genotype Variant in the Promoter Region of the CRH Gene Interacts with Early Rearing Experiences to Influence Anxiety-Like Behavior: A Nonhuman Primate Model\n\nAndrew Aston, Patrick O'Connell, Stephen Lindell, Melanie Schwandt, Christina Barr, Stephen Suomi, J. Dee Higley*\n\nBrigham Young University, Provo, Utah, United States\n\nBackground: Studies show that dysregulation of HPA axis activity is associated with anxiety disorders, and that early maternal absence often leads to HPA Axis dysregulation and increased risk for anxiety disorders. Studies by Barr and colleagues show that early maternal absence interacts with genotypic variation in the CRH gene to increase this risk for HPA axis dysregulation and anxiety-like behavior. New research indicates that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of the rhesus macaque CRH gene, CRH-248 C>T, interacts with adverse rearing conditions, leading to dysregulation of the HPA axis. We proposed investigating this novel CRH SNP and its influence on anxiety-like behavior using rhesus monkeys reared either in species normative groups or without parents in peer-groups and genotyped for a recently characterized CRH genotype (i.e., a CRH-248 SNP).\n\nMethods: Prior to the study, blood was obtained from 209 infant rhesus monkeys and the extracted DNA was assessed for a recently characterized CRH-248 C>T SNP—(heterozygous C/T, or wild type homozygous C/C). Subjects were raised for the first six months of life either with their mothers and fathers and same-aged peers in species normative social groups (mother-reared – MR) or without adults in peer-only rearing groups where they had constant access to 3 other same-aged peers (peer-reared – PR). All other procedures were identical between groups. At six months of age, subjects' stress reactivity was measured using a separation paradigm. Infants were separated from their mothers (MR) or peers (PR) for 4, four-day separations, and anxiety-like behaviors were recorded twice a day using 5-minute observations by trained observers.\n\nResults: Repeated measures, mixed design ANOVAs showed significant main effects for rearing (p<.0009), and genotype (p=.003), as well as a rearing-by-genotype interaction (p=.003) for self-directed behavior, and a separation stressor-by-rearing-by-genotype interaction (p<.0009) for stereotypic behavior. MR animals exhibited essentially no self-directed behaviors and very little stereotypic behavior. PR animals exhibited significantly higher levels of both behaviors with PR C/C animals exhibiting the highest levels of self-directed behavior and PR C/T animals exhibiting the highest levels of stereotypic behavior. These effects were exaggerated by separation stress.\n\nConclusions: Our findings parallel a growing body of research that suggests that anxiety-like behavior is likely mediated, at least in part, by CRH. They also indicate that variants in the CRH gene modulates anxiety-like behavior. Our results also indicate that CRH effect on anxiety-like behavior was not uniform across subjects, but instead was mediated by a gene-by-environment interaction (early maternal absence/presence).\n\nKeywords: CRH, anxiety disorders, primate model, stress\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW23. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Modulates Neural Activity during Threat-Induced Anxiety and Goal Distraction\n\nChelsea Swanson, Courtney Haswell, Avani Vora, Christine Marx*, Rajendra Morey\n\nDuke University Medical Center & Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, United States\n\nBackground: The primary goal of this study was to investigate differences in neural activation in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that are associated with maintaining cognitive control while anxiety is evoked by conditions of impending threat. The consequences of anxiety on one's ability to stay focused can be meaningfully measured by observing neural responses to emotional stimuli under cognitively demanding conditions. This type of cognitive control is thought to be impaired in PTSD, particularly under conditions of threat. We sought to investigate the neural differences associated with PTSD while maintaining cognitive control in the context of threat-induced anxiety.\n\nMethods: Participants (n=46) with PTSD (n=22) and trauma-exposed controls (n=24) engaged in a computerized visuospatial tracking task (similar to the “Pac-Man” arcade game) while undergoing functional MRI. Across all trials, subjects manipulated a joystick that controlled an avatar. Participants attempted to maximize rewards that were accrued by capturing prey, while minimizing losses incurred by capture of the avatar by a predator. The task was performed under two conditions modeled with a block design: (1) in the threat condition, subjects were informed they may receive an electrical shock, which was randomly delivered on one-third of the threat trials; (2) in the non-threat condition, subjects were informed they would never be shocked. Tracking behavior of the subject (avatar) was monitored in both the presence and absence of threat-induced anxiety.\n\nResults: There were significant behavioral differences between threat and non-threat conditions. In particular, participants reported greater anxiety during the threat than the non-threat condition. We found no between-group or group * condition interactions.\n\nThere was greater activation in the control compared to the PTSD group for the threat vs. non-threat contrast in the superior temporal lobe, temporal pole, right amygdala, posterior cingulate gyrus, fusiform cortex, right hippocampus, right caudate, insula, right IFG, and vmPFC. There was greater activation in the PTSD group compared to the control group for the threat vs. non-threat contrast in the right hippocampus, left orbital frontal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and bilateral parahippocampal gyri.\n\nConclusions: Anxiety can be induced by the presence of threat when combined with significant cognitive demands. In the fMRI environment, this approach has enabled observation of neural changes associated with PTSD. Despite comparable levels of anxiety evoked in the PTSD and matched control subjects, we observed differential activation in neural circuits related to monitoring safety, threat, context, and conflict. Future functional connectivity analyses will provide important insights about the relevant circuit dynamics in PTSD.\n\nKeywords: PTSD, Human Neuroimaging, fMRI, anxiety, threat, Threat of Shock, cognitive control\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW24. Hoarding Behaviours among Users of Online Classified Advertisements\n\nMichael Van Ameringen*, Keren Grosman Kaplan, Zahra Khalesi, Jasmine Turna, William Simpson, Beth Patterson\n\nMcMaster University, Hamilton, Canada\n\nBackground: Hoarding disorder (HD) is a mental disorder that has been newly included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition. It is estimated that 2-6% of adults in the general population suffer from clinically significant hoarding symptoms. HD problems typically begin during adolescence and become worse as people age. The symptom burden associated with HD is broad. HD often has significant social and economic consequences to the individual, and contribute to family dysfunction. The cardinal feature of HD is persistent difficulty in discarding or parting with possessions, however, persons fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for hoarding disorder are further categorized according to additional features, or “specifiers”, including excessive acquisition. This may involve taking free items, buying items in excess, or less frequently, and stealing items that are not needed or for which there is no space available. Approximately 80 to 90% of individuals with hoarding disorder engage in excessive acquisition; these people typically experience distress if they are unable to acquire items or are prevented from acquiring items. Little research has examined the excessive acquisition component of this disorder, however one study revealed that buying and obtaining free things were markers of HD severity. With the recent shift towards Internet-based media, new venues for selling goods have emerged. Classified ad networks on the web provide a way to list items for sale, often for free, with a focus on selling locally in the community. Almost half (49%) of internet users say they have used online classified sites. On any given day about a tenth of internet users (9%) visit online classified sites. HD is a condition where research is newly emerging. Many individuals who suffer from HD have limited insight into their condition and are reluctant to seek help, making prevalence estimates difficult to obtain. We elected to examine the prevalence of hoarding behaviours among users of online classified advertisements.\n\nMethods: A link to an online survey was posted on the following Canadian classified ad sites: Kijiji, Craigslist, Locanto and postad.ca. The ads were posted in communities across Canada from June 26, 2015 to August 14, 2015. Following acknowledgment of a disclosure statement, participants were asked to complete a short demographics questionnaire and general questions regarding their use of online classified advertisements; no personal identifiers were collected. They were then provided with the 5-question Hoarding Rating Scale (HRS). If the score indicated clinically significant hoarding (score of ≥ 3 on items 1,4 and 5; ≥ 4 on item 2, and ≥ 2 on item 3), participants were also asked to complete the Saving Inventory-Revised and the Clutter Image Rating. After completing the entire survey, participants were provided with feedback on their hoarding behaviours (based on the HRS). Those with significant hoarding were advised that they may have problematic hoarding behaviours and that they may wish to contact a health professional for further assessment.\n\nResults: At the time of this analysis, 284 had completed the survey. The sample was 66% female (n=186), with a mean age of 40.5 ± 14.4 years; 53% were married, 35 % were single, 10% were divorced and 2% were widowed. Clinically significant hoarding behavior was identified in 12.7% (n=36) using the HRS (x□ 24.5 ± 5.2 versus x□ 9.7 ± 7.2 in those without significant hoarding, p < .0001). Individuals with significant hoarding reported visiting more non-online sources of used or free items such as garage sales: x□ 2.5 ± 1.6 sources versus x□ 1.9 ± 1.6 sources (p = .03). No significant differences were found between hoarders and non-hoarders in the amount of time spent visiting online advertising sites, with 30% of both groups reporting spending ≥ 20 hours per month visiting these sites. The hoarding group (n=36) also had scores indicating significant hoarding on the SI-R (x□ 47.8 ± 13.7) but not on the Clutter Image Rating.\n\nConclusions: Individuals visiting online classified ad sites have high rates of clinically significant hoarding behaviours. The rates of hoarding in this sample were double that found in the general population. The amount of time spent on online classified sites does not appear to be associated with hoarding behaviour. Online classified ad sites may respresent a unique medium to study individuals with hoarding behaviours.\n\nKeywords: Hoarding Disorder, prevalence, internet\n\nDisclosures: Dr. Van Ameringen has received grant/research support from the Hamilton Academic Health Sciences Organization (HAHSO), Janssen-Ortho Inc., and Pfizer Inc.

High-Reactive Infant Behavior Predicts Reduced Amygdala Volume in Young Adults\n\nCarl Schwartz*, Pratap Kunwar, Douglas Greve, Stefanie Block, Rachel Franklin, Jane Viner, Lyndsey Moran\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical Schol, Charlestown, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: About 20% of human infants at 4 months of age demonstrate a distinctive behavioral profile that is characterized by vigorous limb activity, arching of their back and crying to unfamiliar visual, olfactory, and auditory stimuli. Such infants are classified as high-reactive (HR). Low reactive (LR) infants show both low motor activity and low vocal distress to the same experimental stimuli. High-reactivity in infancy predisposes to behavioral inhibition at two years of age. Studies indicate that both a high-reactive temperament at 4 months and an inhibited temperament at two years of age are risk factors for the development of multiple anxiety and mood disorders in adolescents and young adults. Functional imaging studies in longitudinal cohorts have demonstrated that the HR infant phenotype is associated with greater amygdalar reactivity to novel faces later in life. However, the structure of amygdala in young adults who had been high reactive infants has not been examined. Although reductions in the volume of the amygdala have been reported in both anxiety and mood disorders, the origin of this reduction is not well understood. Using high resolution structural MRI, we investigated the volume of the amygdala in a longitudinal cohort of 135 young adults who had been high-reactive infants at 4 months of age.\n\nMethods: The Massachusetts General Hospital IRB approved the experimental protocol. Informed consent was obtained after the nature and possible consequences of the study were explained. High-resolution MRI was used to determine the volume of the amygdala in 135 late adolescents (age 18.20 ± 0.07, 72 males and 63 females) enrolled in a longitudinal study who had been assessed for infant reactivity at 4 months of age. Fifty-five of the young adults (age 18.19 ± 0.1, 30 males and 25 females) had been high-reactive infants and 80 subjects (age 18.21 ± 0.08, 42 males and 38 females) had been low-reactive (LR) infants. Each subject underwent two 3D MPRAGE structural scans on a 3T Siemens TrioTim scanner (128 sagital slices; 1.3x1.3x1 mm; TR=2530 ms; TE = 3.39 ms; flip angle 7°, bandwidth 190 Hz/Px). The two 3D MPRAGE structural scans from each subject were averaged, after motion correction, to create a single high signal-to-noise volume. This volume was analyzed using Freesurfer (www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos) to calculate left and right amygdala volumes in cubic millimetres. Each scan was manually inspected by an investigator (PK) who was blind to the subject's infant status to ensure accurate segmentation. The effects of infant reactivity classification (HR, LR) on left and right amygdala volume in adulthood were analyzed with a MANOVA (SAS v9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), with for age, sex, handedness, and ICV as covariates.\n\nResults: The volume (mean ±sem) of the left amygdala in young adults who had been high-reactive infants (1652 ± 20 mm3) was smaller than in those subjects who had been low-reactive infants at 4 months of age (1720 ± 25 mm3; F(1,118) = 4.7, p=0.03). The difference in the right amygdala was in the same direction (HR 1741 ± 24 mm3 vs LR HR 1784 ± 20 mm3) but the difference did not reach statistical significance F(1,118) = 1.99, p=0.16).\n\nConclusions: In this longitudinal study, an infant phenotype observed in the first months of life predicted differences in amygdala volumes in the brains of young adults 18 years later. Reduced amygdala volumes have been reported in generalized social anxiety and major depression. Infant high-reactivity and behavioral inhibition have been shown to be risk factors that predispose to those same psychopathological outcomes. The present finding raises the possibility that the volumetric differences that have been reported in cross-sectional studies of anxiety disorders and depression could be attributable to a shared intermediate phenotype rooted in early infancy that cuts across traditional diagnostic categories.\n\nKeywords: Brain development, infant, Amygdala, individual differences, behavioral inhibition\n\nDisclosures: Nothing to disclose.\n\nW26. Brain Dynamics of Ongoing Attentional Fluctuations in ADHD\n\nAaron Kucyi, Michael Hove, Michael Esterman, Joseph Biederman, Eve Valera*\n\nHarvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are characterized by frequent, ongoing fluctuations in attention to their external and internal environments. Moment-to-moment behavioral variability may serve as a marker of ongoing attentional fluctuations, with periods of high variability purported to reflect attentional lapses. The brain dynamics underlying ongoing behavioral variability in ADHD have not been explored. Brain networks involved in attentional fluctuations, including the default mode network (DMN), salience network, and dorsal attention network (DAN), have previously been shown to be disrupted in ADHD. We therefore hypothesized that behavioral variability would be associated with different p"
