        "text": "Max Steiger, 62 of Philadelphia, PA and Margate City, NJ departed this world on February 28, 2024 surrounded by his family and loved ones. Born on June 7, 1961 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Max was the beloved son of the late Jacob Steiger and Fern Steiger (nee Reed).\n\nMax is survived by his loving wife, Lisa Zoks, and their cherished daughter, Hannah Steiger. He is also remembered fondly by his sister, Robyn Graul (Jason) and his sister-in-law Michele Gosselin (John) and brother-in-law Matthew Zoks (Gita) and his nieces and nephews: Lindsay (Rich) Umberger, Alyssa Devine, Derek Dierkes, Aaron Kopecki, Zach Kopecki, Dev Zoks and Meena Zoks.\n\nA proud graduate of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Max was a fraternity brother of Sigma Nu and forged a successful career as a sales executive. His wit, vibrancy, and compassionate nature endeared him to friends and colleagues alike.\n\nMax found joy in life's simple pleasures, from the melody of music to the pages of literature and the soothing waves of the beach. His love extended to his furry companions, Caleb, Johnny, and Lucy, whom he cherished and often accompanied to the dog beach/park.\n\nHis untimely departure leaves a profound void in the lives of those who knew him, but the memories of Max's stories, laughter, and kindness will forever resonate in our hearts.\n\nA celebration of life memorial service to celebrate Maxâ€™s life will be announced in the coming weeks. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests those who desire to remember him to please make a contribution in his memory to the American Brain Tumor Association online at https://give.abta.org/maxsteiger or via mail:\n\nThe American Brain Tumor Association 8550 W. Bryn Mawr Ave. #550 Chicago, IL 60631, or to\n\nOr Wags Rescue, https://wagsrescue.org/donate/ or via mail: P.O. Box 1514 Southampton, Pennsylvania 18966\n\nMay Max Steiger rest in eternal peace, his spirit forever remembered, and his legacy carried on by those fortunate enough to have shared in his warmth and love.\n\nArrangements entrusted to Roth-Goldsteins' Memorial Chapel"
