        "text": "There are the basic Steiger Craft 255 DV Miami packages and there are those that are somewhat tricked out, but few of these can compare to The Fisherman’s new 2024 Steiger “project boat” – it’s truly second to none, with just about every conceivable option, including some that even aren’t on the menu.\n\nThe Fisherman’s Mike Caruso, Alan Steiger and I have been chatting up his planned Steiger 25 DV Miami project boat for the past 18 months, discussing what options made sense and which didn’t. As Mike and I traversed up and down the aisles at both the Fort Lauderdale and Miami Boat Shows letting our imaginations roam freely, Mike considered preferred power, comfort and convenience items, along with state-of-the-art fishing and electronics features that would make “The Fisherman” one-of-a-kind among its peer group. As per Mike’s wish list, the mission was “a true three-season, inshore/offshore, weather-protected fishing boat that offered every latest state-of-the-art comfort, performance and fishing feature.” This short list included an integrated Humminbird/Minn Kota Quest Instinct electric trolling motor system; twin Humminbird Apex 16 and Solix 10 MFDs; a new Yamaha F350 4.3L V6/Helm Master EX/Vetus bow thruster setup; plus the Seakeeper One mounted underdeck in the mid-ships cockpit.\n\nBut that was just the first course! Some other neat add-on options included a built-in Sionyx Nightwave night vision camera; custom Aquatraction flooring; a Humminbird radar sitting atop a Scanstrut tower; a Fusion marine stereo, booster amp and JL Audio speakers; ICOM M510 VHF radio; classy Edson steering wheel; a Lithium Pro battery; plus a Venture Commander 8800 trailer to make this platform eminently portable.\n\nMike took delivery of his own dream boat back in early May and has been getting some valuable wheel time breaking in the new Yamaha F350 while experiencing the nuances of docking against the wind with the integrated Yamaha Helm Master EX. The Helm Master’s single joystick control ties together the transom bracket-mounted, on-motor electric steering, outboard with the forward-mounted variable speed bow thruster to create the ultimate in single engine maneuverability for a cabin boat that offers mother nature a huge target to toss around in an afternoon sea breeze when bringing her dockside.\n\nIt’s no secret that 255 DV Miami is Steiger’s best-selling boat. It features everything you need for a fun and efficient day on water, with excellent speed and range, and none of the superfluous gingerbread that looks nice in the showroom but only adds cost to the boat and is rarely used on your trips. The deep-vee hull measures 25-1/2 feet LOA (not counting the outboard bracket) and is supported by a trailerable 8-1/2-foot beam. Tipping the scales at a burly 5,900 pounds her built-in 150-gallon fuel tank offers canyon range, top speeds in the low-to-mid 40s with her upgraded, lightweight, Yamaha F350, plus the inherent comfort and stability of the Seakeeper One gyro, combined with a spacious cockpit and true three-season functionality.\n\nThe unique feature of the DV Miami flavor of the 255 hull (vs the full cabin walled Chesapeake layout), is to offer the benefit of a weather-protected package that can flex with existing conditions. So on those hot windless days, you can roll up the aft drop curtains and get some fresh air at the helm.\n\nOther notable standards include dual batteries with a four-way switch; a six-pack of cleats; marine compass; fiberglass bow pulpit w/rail; full fiberglass swim platform and ladder; handrails; hose trays; an in-deck fishbox under the cockpit sole; LED interior cabin lights; marine head; opening front windows and port holes; port and starboard windshield wipers; a cushioned port side bench in the cabin with under seat storage; raw water washdown; recessed trim tabs; a six-rod overhead rocket launcher in the hardtop; a quartet of gunwale-mounted rodholders with horizontal rod racks and sinker trays down under; spreader lights; a 40-gallon transom livewell; a vee berth with cushions and more.\n\nAnd if that weren’t enough to get you in the mood to head offshore or over to your family’s favorite beachside hideaway, you can power this Steiger 255 DV Miami with a variety of single and twin power setups, along with each kicker motor setups for the ultimate in get-home capability.\n\nIf you see Mike and his wife Joyce out there bending the rods, head on over and say “hi”, just don’t mug their fishing spot (lol!)\n\nsteigercraft.com\n\nYamaha Marine\n\nMinn Kota\n\nHumminbird\n\nAquatraction\n\nSeakeeper\n\nFusion\n\nVenture Trailers\n\nVetus\n\nScanstrut"
