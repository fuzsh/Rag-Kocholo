Zeke is very distressed to overhear Karl insisting to Susan that Katya shouldn't return home,to protect Zeke, who can't cope with the news, even from his sister herself. Karl appeals directly to their semi-paternal bond when Zeke bags even on Christmas, when he also lost his late dad. Janelle rejects even shirtless Ned as distraction for family-disapproved Steiger and decides to shop for a mansion, with Toadie just to rub the new-found Timmins wealth in a Rebecci, but decides to stay in Ramsay Street where they stick out as richest by far. Pepper tricks her parents into a lunch, they decide to try getting together. Ned wisely dumps snake Katya but still feels rotten about it.",
