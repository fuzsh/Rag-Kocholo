        "text": "Arnold Eugene Steiger, “Butch”, passed away peacefully in the comfort of his home in Libby, MT on February 20th, 2024 at the age of 73, surrounded by loved ones. Butch was born on September 3, 1950 in Bismarck, North Dakota to Wilbert and Irene Steiger. Butch was one of seven children.\n\nButch spent his childhood in Bismarck, ND. He married Joleen Holzer in 1968. Butch and Joleen moved to Troy, Montana to be closer to his parents. Butch and Joleen had their first child Jackie; she was born in Libby, MT in 1968. Butch and Joleen decided to move back to Bismarck and had their other two children Gayla in 1972 and Glen in 1974. In 1975 Butch moved their family back to Libby, MT. Butch worked for St. Regis and then Champion mill for 18 years. After the mill changed operations and laid many workers off, Butch started in the Logging industry. He had a small logging company and later started driving logging truck. Butch was a hard working family man.\n\nButch and Joleen raised their own beef, pigs and chickens. Butch hunted wild game and processed his own meat and loved making sausage. He looked forward to hunting camp every year. He again packed up his family and took them along. He had many fond memories of hunting camp. Many friends and family hunted out of that camp.\n\nButch enjoyed hunting, berry picking, getting firewood and just being in the Mountains. Most weekends Butch would load his family up in the truck and head out into the woods. Butch also enjoyed playing cribbage and won many cribbage tournaments. Butch was always a family man, his family, and especially his grandkids were the light of his life.\n\nIn 1997 Butch was in a serious logging accident that left him permanently disabled and unable to work. His devoted wife Joleen (his angel), always took very good care of him and stood by his side. Butch and Joleen were married for 55 years at the time of his death.\n\nButch was preceded in death by his parents, Wilbert and Irene Steiger, and his sister Evelyn (Steiger) Peterson, his brothers Dale Steiger and Terry Steiger.\n\nButch is survived by his wife Joleen Steiger of 55 years, their three children, Jackie (Chad) Espinoza, Gayla (Alex) Sweet, Glen (Brandy) Steiger.
