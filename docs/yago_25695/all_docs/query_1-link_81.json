        "text": "The secret of Elliott Gould’s talent as an actor, his empathy and wisdom as a human being, and his star power as an iconic screen veteran should never be taken for granted. With a vast career that has seen the Academy Award-nominated actor in memorable films such as “Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice” (1969), “M*A*S*H” (1970), “Little Murders” (1971), “The Touch” (1971), “The Long Goodbye” (1973), “Capricorn One” (1977) and, another one of my all-time favorites, “The Silent Partner” (1978, his first of two films with actress Susannah York), he has also been one of the most reliable actors of his generation in supporting and character roles.\n\nJust take a look at his work in his prolific list of credits, including Warren Beatty’s “Bugsy” (1991) or “American History X” (1998), or Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean Trilogy franchise with “Ocean’s Eleven” (2001), “Ocean’s Twelve” (2004) and “Ocean’s Thirteen” (2007), along with its delightful spin-off “Ocean’s 8” (2018)—or Soderbergh’s medical thriller “Contagion” (2011), undoubtedly seen by many more during the past year—to really unravel the secret of Mr. Gould’s versatility. Bottom line is this very accomplished actor will never stop amazing his audience. Give him a part—any part, really—and he delivers a powerhouse performance you won’t forget.\n\nHe also has the distinction to have appeared on the cover of TIME Magazine, on September 7, 1970. “There were two covers,” Mr. Gould remembers, “it was the same edition and the same story, but the cover in Europe and Canada was a picture of me from “M*A*S*H” wearing sunglasses, and they said, ‘The Man from “M*A*S*H”’ while the cover in the United States was a painting and said ‘Star for an Uptight Age’ that had to do with “Getting Straight” [1970] which I did with [director] Richard Rush and [co-stars] Candice Bergen and Harrison Ford. That was a great privilege.” Quentin Tarantino says his role in “Getting Straight” as a Vietnam vet who returns to college to get his master’s degree is ‘maybe his most iconic role.’\n\nTo this day, Mr. Gould (b. 1938) still acts, and to this day, nearly fifteen years after we first met at his Los Angeles home, it still is a unique and enriching experience to talk with him though this conversation was not a one-on-one. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, this was a transatlantic telephone interview and a follow-up to our previous conversation.\n\nNot only is he a skillful actor; Mr. Gould is very creative with words as well, and as he reminisces about his work in films, he loves to quote and refer to artists, scientists, and philosophers like Orson Welles, Jacques Brel, Albert Einstein, or Viktor Krankl, the Austrian-born Holocaust survivor who wrote his autobiography and bestseller “Man’s Search for Meaning” (1946) over a nine-day period. Thirty years ago, the Library of Congress listed this book as one of the ten most influential books in the United States. CNN’s news anchor Anderson Cooper says, ‘This is a book I reread a lot… it gives me hope… it gives me a sense of strength.’\n\nWhen you talk with Mr. Gould, his thoughts are always very precise and detailed, and what a thrill it is to listen to his baritone voice that has graced the screen over and over again. During our previous interviews, he talked about his work in films, the characters he played, and the directors he worked with. Yet, just like Clark Gable or Humphrey Bogart, Mr. Gould has been a star for many years as well. Fifty years ago, he was hot. He was a box office sensation and a box office attraction, and made three or even four films a year. He was a household name who appeared in several masterpieces, and he became the first American actor to work with Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman.\n\nSo why not focus this time on his life as a star? Yet, as it turns out and as I could expect, he doesn’t look back at his work and his professional career from that angle. He’s very humble, modest, respectful, and considerate when it comes to his work that has been admired by several generations now. But first, the Coronavirus pandemic which has affected all of us.\n\nMr. Gould, we’ve been going through an awful lot during the past year. How have you been doing?\n\nI have no complaints. It’s part of life, I guess, I just must adapt to the truth and reality of how things are. It’s very challenging, but I believe that we all have the same story in our own way. So no matter what the nationality, or the language, this is all about human life on earth. So I do as well as I can, and as always, I am very devoted and committed to my family.\n\nYou’re not only a family man, but you’re also a star. You have been a star for more than fifty years now. That’s amazing, isn’t it?\n\nI find that peculiar. Everybody is a star. I am gratified, grateful and appreciative to have been able to continue to work through all of this in relation to my purpose, in relation to what I would hope would be the purpose of all of us. What does it feel like to be alive? What does it feel like to function and have a purpose? What does it feel like to participate and to contribute? It’s a privilege, it’s very humbling, and I believe in true humility—by which I mean, ‘No one of us can be any more than the least of us.’\n\nHollywood has always been this glittering place, but it’s also a very hard-working place where people go early to bed and wake up early in the morning to make pictures, isn’t it?\n\nIt’s an illusion. As a matter of fact, I was told by a 106-year-old colleague whose name is Norman Lloyd that Orson Welles—the great Orson Welles—is quoted as having said that, ‘If every film that has ever been made, had to be destroyed, the only one that we should keep, would be “Grand Illusion” [1937] by Jean Renoir.’\n\n“Grand Illusion” (1937, trailer) by French film director Jean Renoir\n\nDo you agree with that?\n\nI think everything is an illusion, and when it goes, everything will go. We won’t even know that we were here. So I don’t disagree: there are beautiful works of art, but I prefer nature, you know. I like trees, birds—the birds and the bees. Someone asked me who my favorite philosophers are, and I said, ‘The birds and the bees.’\n\nYet, people who watch films or go to the movies or those who grew up with your films always like this notion or this concept of a ‘star.’ What does it take to make you, or Natalie Wood or Barbra Streisand a star? Is it possible to explain or define that?\n\nSure. Hard work, talent, education, and opportunity. It takes persistence, devotion, and dedication, and for me—for me myself—it takes a great deal of love.\n\nLove for the work that you do?\n\nYes, and love for what it is that we are. That’s one of the things that The Beatles said, ‘All You Need Is Love.’\n\nIs it easy to handle stardom when you have all this fame and this notoriety?\n\nWe should have a great sense of humor and not take ourselves too seriously. But I also think it’s important to be responsible for what we do, and it’s essential to share thoughts, feelings, and perspectives. And respect is very important if you have a universal audience that identifies, participates, and follows what we do. It’s very important and very valuable to understand that we’re seen through other eyes, and others can have their own interpretation of what it is that we are and what it is that we do. And therefore, I believe that it is a responsibility, but it has taken me a long time to understand myself so I can be the same with all of us. I’m very grateful to be able to communicate and share what I am in relation to what we are, which is everything. All I care about is us, it’s all about us, and I’m just one of us.\n\nHow important has your stage work been in your career?\n\nI feel that I’ve neglected my stagecraft. Ingmar Bergman published me as being tragic for not doing classical work in relation to my natural gifts; he quoted and referred to Shakespeare, Ibsen, Strindberg and Molière in an article in Life Magazine. I was very flattered, but I felt I didn’t come here to repeat what anyone did. I came here to find myself, to understand who I am. So I am very grateful, although it’s dangerous at times: the world is such an abstract political place for people, and for me to see that we as a species don’t seem to yet be capable of making peace, of eliminating nuclear armaments, of eliminating war and be here all together and learn from one another… Because that’s what the work is about. And that touches me deeply because we’re so vulnerable.\n\nWhen directors or casting directors offer you a role, has it ever caused you any pressure to make sure you picked out the right part that’s perfect for you?\n\nSometimes I’ve exhibited no judgment, sometimes I’ve had poor judgment, and sometimes I worked for money because families needed me to be a breadwinner, put food on the table, and a roof over our head. That’s why it’s also so essential to take responsibility for what you do and to be honest. I said to my 21-year-old grandson Henry, whose family has Dutch blood, ‘Is there anything you’re afraid of?’ And he said, ‘I’m afraid to fail.’ I told him, ‘Henry, so long as you’re honest with yourself, you’ll never fail.’ Continue to learn, continue to stay interested, develop understanding, and not get swept away by superficial, materialistic things.\n\nDo you remember when you decided to become an actor?\n\nI never decided to become an actor. I used to listen to the radio—this was before television—when my parents took me to some movies, and movies frightened me. I was a tap dancer and I thought, ‘If I memorize routines, perhaps I’ll be able to communicate through that, which I’ve memorized.’ And I did. When I was a chorus boy, I did musicals, and once they cast me, they cast Barbra [Streisand] to be my secretary in the stage musical “I Can Get It For You Wholesale” [1962]. Then the first film director I worked with was William Dieterle, who had directed Paul Muni in “The Life of Louis Pasteur” [1936] and Charles Laughton in “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” [1939]; he also directed a picture called “Juarez” [1939] in which Bette Davis was magnificent. My second director was William Friedkin when he made “The Night They Raided Minsky’s” [1968], and on my third film, which was Paul Mazursky’s first film as a director, I discovered the camera, and I realized that the camera didn’t give me problems. I gave me problems. The camera would never lie to me, would never manipulate me, it would just report who I am, and it saved my life. And then I was able to make a life for myself in and with film. So when Ingmar Bergman chose me to be the first one of us—of we, Americans—to work with him, with Bibi Andersson, Max von Sydow, [cinematographer] Sven Nykvist and the entire crew and family, he said to me in 1970 outside of a 2,000-year-old church that we were filming at, ‘You’ve gone beyond your limits, you’ll have to live more to understand what you’ve done.’ At that moment, I was secure in playing him. He had studied my work, and he chose me, but I didn’t understand myself. Nor did I have an inkling of how deeply insecure this was—and is.\n\nYou just mentioned veteran filmmaker William Dieterle who was your first film director [“Quick, Let’s Get Married,” 1964]. What was he like on the set?\n\nWell, I had a very small part, I played the deafmute. His assistant Victor Stoloff showed me how to play the part; the other actors were Ginger Rogers, Ray Milland and Carl Schell—Maximilian and Maria Schell’s brother. William Dieterle was known to be quite a character; he came to America with Max Reinhardt, and they collaborated on directing a film here of William Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” [1935] with James Cagney and Mickey Rooney. I loved working with him—I love everyone I work with, and I learn from everyone I work with. Richard Dreyfuss said to me, ‘I know you, and I know Norman Lloyd, but I’ve never known the two of you together. Will you have lunch with me?’ So I said, ‘Okay.’ I came and brought Norman for lunch at a place called A Votre Santé. Richard said, ‘Sometimes I’m smarter than my directors.’ I said to Richard, ‘Richard, I made that mistake too, and it cost me a lot. But we are just actors, and it’s our job to be able to work to fulfill whatever the director’s vision is and what the director is working for.’ Then Richard said to me, ‘You mean you would go down with the ship?’ And I said, ‘Give me a moment Richard, this is my first time.’ And then I said, ‘If you truly care, absolutely. Something to live for, and something to die for, I would go down with the ship.’\n\nHow important has it been for you to have an agent, a publicist, or a manager that you can rely on?\n\nI don’t have a publicist. I have an agent. I think it’s important to work with business people. I’m not a business person, but I’m learning. I’m also not political, but I’m studying. So it’s important to understand what people are in relation to what the world is, and learn to work with people. If we’re all going to learn together, we have to learn to work together.\n\nHas there ever been a time in your life when you were a struggling actor?\n\nYes, oh God yes. I was a struggling person, a struggling human being. There’s this amazing scientist Viktor Krankl, he’s great. He wrote “Man’s Search for Meaning” [1946], he was in Auschwitz, and he came to America… So struggling, are you kidding? That’s part of being alive. Here we are, and to be able to be in the movies and to play roles, that’s great. I believe that there’s nothing of value other than what we have to share. It’s one thing to share goodness and accomplishment, and it’s another thing to share a problem. Once people are willing and capable of communicating directly like this, we can then see that no one of us can have a problem that one of us didn’t have before. Because on this level, we’re all the same. One of the reasons I have worked a little bit in Belgium is Jacques Brel. He is one of my most favorite people, I love the work and the art of Jacques Brel. He’s great.\n\nAs a major star, it’s very difficult to get on the A list, and it seems to be even more difficult to remain on the list. Is that true, and did you ever experience that as well?\n\nI don’t know. If there is a list—an A list—that’s economic. That has to do with the business and with financing, so don’t take it too seriously. Just keep working. Sometimes I’ll just be on the B list or not on any list, and I just keep working. Stay interested and keep working.\n\nRobert Altman’s “The Long Goodbye” (1973, trailer), starring Mr. Gould as Philip Marlowe\n\nSo stay interested and keep working. Is that also the secret of still being in films after more than fifty years?\n\nThere is no secret. The idea is to stay interested and to participate, just to be here.\n\nWhen we met last time, you mentioned the idea of writing your autobiography. Do you still think about it?\n\nI think about it… It has to be loving and fun, positive and joyful. I don’t want to be boring, I don’t want to be pretentious. One of my greatest fears is to be misunderstood or misinterpreted. Being that, I only mean well. But sometimes we can be misinterpreted, and that hurts. So I have to be somewhat careful, and I want to be really considerate, not knowing what people make of me. I was also asked to direct. I have nothing to prove, but I’m interested. Ingmar Bergman had told me that I would direct. He said that when I direct, I shouldn’t act. But we’ll see, it remains to be seen. I have to be economical with my large growing family. I mean, school, education—we’re never too old, and we never can know enough to be open-minded and educated. To continue to learn is the key to life, that’s the key to liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nSpeaking about happiness, is that what Hollywood was like in the late 1960s, joyful and carefree when all those young, promising actors and new film directors began making their first films?\n\nThat’s an illusion. Look at Stanley Kubrick’s film “2001: A Space Odyssey” [1968] as a metaphor: life is what people make of it. We didn’t invent life, it’s something we didn’t create. Everything else we invented, like Hollywood or movies. But we didn’t invent nature and life, and that’s what we’re doing here. I heard a quotation of Albert Einstein that I have never heard before, ‘Coincidence is God’s way of staying anonymous.’ There’s another one of his which is, ‘The distinction between past, present and future is only an illusion, even if a stubborn one.’ I played him once in a Canadian production [TV series “The Genius,” 1998]. Many actors have played Albert Einstein, but there was only one Albert Einstein. He was also quoted as having said, ‘It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I take more time with problems.’\n\nDo you recognize yourself in that quote?\n\n[Laughs.] Of course!\n\nDid you ever have problems with paparazzi, photographers, overenthusiastic fans…?\n\nIt took me a long time to be able to come to terms with that. Once you put yourself on screen when they are going to sell you, you’re going to be sold as a part of a presentation and a business. One must know that the images belong to the business and to the public.\n\nFor most of your adult life, you have been a celebrity. Have you ever been able to go to the supermarket?\n\nAbsolutely. I’m just one of us. I think it’s really important to be aware, and sensible and respectful. Be honest and true to what we are because we’re all the same. And I believe in the present, in the here and now, and we’re all the same age, just some of us have been here longer than others.\n\nIf you could start all over again, would you change anything?\n\nWe’re starting all over again every moment of our existence, and that’s called evolution. And that’s how we learn. We’re here for nature; we have to allow nature to take its course. We’re conceived, we’re born, we live, and we perish.
