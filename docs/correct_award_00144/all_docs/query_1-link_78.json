        "text": "Luigi Pirandello’s extraordinary final novel begins when Vitangelo Moscarda’s wife remarks that Vitangelo’s nose tilts to the right.\n\nThis commonplace interaction spurs the novel’s unemployed, wealthy narrator to examine himself, the way he perceives others, and the ways that others perceive him.\n\nAt first he only notices small differences in how he sees himself and how others do; but his self-examination quickly becomes relentless, dizzying, leading to often darkly comic results as Vitangelo decides that he must demolish that version of himself that others see.\n\nPirandello said of his 1926 novel that it “deals with the disintegration of the personality. It arrives at the most extreme conclusions, the farthest consequences.” Indeed, its unnerving humor and existential dissection of modern identity find counterparts in Samuel Beckett’s Molloy trilogy and the works of Thomas Bernhard and Vladimir Nabokov.\n\nLuigi Pirandello (1867-1936) was an Italian author, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1934 for his “bold and brilliant renovation of the drama and the stage.” Pirandello’s works include novels, hundreds of short stories, and plays. Pirandello’s plays are often seen as forerunners for the theatre of the absurd.\n\nOne, No One, and One Hundred Thousand\n\nLuigi Pirandello\n\nTranslated by William Weaver\n\nPublisher Spurl Editions\n\nFormat Paperback\n\n218 pages\n\nISBN-10 194367907X\n\nISBN-13 9781943679072\n\n2018\n\n$18.00\n\n# new books\n\nTitle One, No One, and One Hundred Thousand\n\nAuthor Luigi Pirandello\n\nTranslated by William Weaver\n\n• fleursdumal.nl magazine"
