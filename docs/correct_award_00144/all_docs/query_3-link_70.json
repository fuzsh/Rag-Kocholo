And what is “reality”…? And what is appearance…?\n\nIndeed, his life was often chaotic… and so the frontier between “reality” and appearance was blurred, in his work.\n\nOn the occasion of his 150th birthday, on June 28th this year, we ask you to imagine THE HOUSE OF CHAOS or THE HOUSE OF LIMINALITY, on the very plot of land where his own birth house is, on the Southern edge of Sicily, facing the Mediterranean Sea and, beyond it, Africa.\n\nLet’s imagine THE QUINTESSENTIAL HOUSE OF CHAOS, OR HOUSE OF LIMINALITY.\n\nIt would only be appropriate, considering the meanings of his work.\n\nAnd the theme should concern us all.\n\nThat area where Pirandello’s birthplace is infused with an ancient history, since the Valley of Temples is not far… but we don’t believe any longer in the gods, nor do we seriously build temples any longer.\n\nBut maybe now it is a good occasion, reflecting on the work of Luigi Pirandello, to imagine THE HOUSE OF CHAOS… ambitiously, in a way, to imagine a \"temple\" dedicated to chaos, or to liminality.\n\nThe House of Borders.\n\nThe House of Thresholds.\n\nThe House of In-betweenness.\n\nThe House of Twoness.\n\nThe House of Doubt.\n\nThe House of Chaos.\n\nThe House on the Fringe.\n\nThese themes, we feel, are very important, maybe more today than at any other time in the past.\n\nWe could very well identify with the problems and themes described in Pirandello’s works. We suggest the links below for further readings on this subject:\n\nMarco’s Sicily – Agrigento, Luigi Pirandello and Kaos (Chaos)\n\nhttps://lareviewofbooks.org/article/consolation-from-chaos-on-luigi-pirandello/#!\n\nThe site for your proposal should be the one within the red square, in the picture above. In the picture below it is within the yellow circle on the left, on the right side, with a yellow perimeter line you can see the Valley of Temples... interesting proximity... on the left, Modernity, with its lack of faith, on the right, the physical proof, still standing after more than 2,000 years, of what we call \"the Ancient times,\" when human beings believed in the gods and built for them. This antithesis makes this place remarkable and we would like to explore its full potential.\n\nThe deadline to submit your work is August 10th, 2017.
