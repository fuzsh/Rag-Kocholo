        "text": "Girgenti fSicfly) |\n\nin 1867. His early\n\nwritings met with\n\nl<rtle success, but\n\nhe gained some\n\nnotice as a clever\n\nwriter of gruesome\n\n.stories. It was not\n\nuntil 1922 that his\n\nplays attracted\n\nattention abroad,\n\nbut from that time\n\nhis international\n\nreputation was as\n\nsured. His most\n\nfamous play, \"Six\n\nCharacters in\n\nSearch of an Au\n\nthor,\" has been\n\npronounced by Mr.\n\nGeorge Bernard\n\nShaw, whom he is\n\nsaid to resemble, to be the strongest\n\nand most original work for the stage\n\never written. In 1930 Pirandello sold\n\nhis villa in Rome, divided everything\n\nhe possessed among his three children\n\nand went to the United States \"in\n\nsearch of a spirit of ycuthfulness.\" He\n\nsaid that youth had disappeared from\n\nEurope, where '\"even the babies are\n\nborn old.\"\n\nPerhaps one of the best known and\n\nmost original of Pirandello-'s plays is\n\n\"Shoot.\" a tragedy told by a cinema\n\noperator. Another outstanding Dlay is\n\n\"Cope Tv Mi Vuoi\" C'As You \"Desire\n\nMe\"), which is based on the famous\n\nBruneri-Cannella case of undecided\n\nidentity that puzzled the Italian legal\n\nworld for so long. This was made into\n\na talking film, in which Greta Garbo\n\nplayed the leading part. Others of his\n\nmore widely known plays are \"Laz\n\nzaro,\" \"And That's The Truth.\" \"The\n\nVice.\" \"The Mock Emperor.\" \"The Man\n\nWith a Flower in His Moata,\" \"The life\n\nI Gave You.\" and \"lT\"cvarsi.'\"l"
