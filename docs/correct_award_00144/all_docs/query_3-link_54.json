        "text": "The birthplace of Luigi Pirandello is located in the \"Caos” country district. Overlooking the sea, the house is on the border between the territory of the municipality of Agrigento (4 km) and that of the municipality of Porto Empedocle. It can be reached by taking road SS 115 in the direction of Villaseta.\n\nThe house was originally a rural building from the end of the 18th century, given to the family Ricci Gramitto, the writer's maternal ancestors. Here, Caterina Ricci Gramitto, Luigi’s mother, had taken refuge to escape the serious cholera epidemic that raged in Sicily in 1867. After having been passed to other owners following the economic downfall of the Pirandello family, the building was damaged in 1943 by the explosion of a nearby ammunition depot. It was declared a national monument in 1949. After the acquisition by the region of Sicily in 1952, renovations were undertaken that gave the place its current appearance.\n\nThe rooms of the upper floor with views of the surrounding countryside house personal objects, photographs, awards, reviews, letters, manuscripts and first editions of autographed books with dedications, posters of the most famous works of the great writer from Agrigento and the Greek vase that was used to transport his ashes from the Verano cemetery in Rome to Agrigento. The ground floor periodically hosts temporary exhibitions dedicated to the Maestro.\n\nSince 1987, the birthplace forms one institution together with the Luigi Pirandello library that is based in Agrigento (Via Imera).\n\nThe final resting place: A nearby path crosses the countryside and leads to the place of Pirandello's pine tree, which unfortunately no longer exists because it was severely damaged by a storm in 1997. Here, fulfilling the desire expressed by the writer in his will, a rock that was shaped by the sculptor Marino Mazzacurati houses the urn with the ashes of Luigi Pirandello.\n\nLuigi Pirandello House:\n\nAddress: Contrada Caos; Strada Statale 115; Localita Villaseta; Agrigento; Sicily\n\nFrom 9:30 am to 1:30 pm and from 2:30 pm to 7:30 pm\n\nTomb of the writer: Visit possible from 9:30 am to one hour before sunset\n\nLuigi Pirandello Library:\n\nAddress: Via Imera; Agrigento; Sicily\n\nOpen from Monday to Friday from 9:30 am to 1:30 pm, Wednesday and Thursday also from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm.\n\nClosed on January 1\n\nTicket Office: Last access half an hour before closing.\n\nPlease note: The explanations for items exhibited are in Italian.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Immediately after submitting an order, you will receive two email.
