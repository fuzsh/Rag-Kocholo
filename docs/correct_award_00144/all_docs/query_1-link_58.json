        "text": "Staging – Adaptation: Katerina Evangelatos\n\nPerformed by Nikolas Papagiannis (in Greek)\n\nAccordion: Thanos Stavridis\n\nThe great Italian Nobel laureate for literature Luigi Pirandello has left an indelible mark, not only in theater but also in short story writing. “The Jar” is a comic story written in 1917, set in the Italian South.\n\nQuarrelsome landowner Don Lollo Zirafa commissions a large jar to store olive oil. The enormous jar breaks, mysteriously, only a few hours later, and Don Lollo asks old Dima for help in mending it. The landowner’s temper gets old Dima into an impasse: In his effort to stitch the jar, he is trapped inside – yet Don Lollo refuses to break it to set him free.\n\nA characteristic example of Pirandello’s incisive realism and social critique, “The Jar” takes us back to the Italian South in the early 20th century, transforming a seemingly simple tale into a celebration of absurdism.\n\nThe short story is published in Luigi Pirandello, Διηγήματα, Roes Editions, 2008), transl. into Greek by Mara Theodoritsi.\n\nSunday 17/03 | 17.00"
