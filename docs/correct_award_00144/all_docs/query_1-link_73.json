        "text": "Luigi Pirandello gives the world of his play Henry IV a vivid antiquarian texture, endowing the carefully recreated throne room, prop swords and costumes of the Holy Roman Emperor with the aura of fact. As the audience comes to learn, however, its scenic truth claim is provisional, dependent on frames of reality established by characters who are themselves actors in an elaborate charade. When “mad” Henry enters, everyone behaves according to the social codes and performed identities the visual space demands. When Henry leaves, his guards light cigarettes; his family speaks openly about his madness; the throne room flickers between authenticity and manifest falseness. Eventually Henry, the only spectator whose belief in this world is supposed to be genuine, reveals that he has been merely playing the madman for many years, choosing to embrace the illusion recreated for his benefit though he also recognizes its factual unreality. As Pirandello’s characters unpack the implications of their relative commitment to this metatheatrical scenography, they wrestle with questions about what it means to be a subject. In particular, Henry and his psychoanalyst tease out how consciousness arises in what philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty might call the horizon of perception. What they articulate, however, is only a representation of a philosophical inquiry already performed visually. The dialogue replays the metaphysical metatheatrics the spectators have just experienced directly. We “willingly suspend our disbelief” in scenic verisimilitude but then again must suspend that very suspension, faced with the twice-removed duplicity of an inauthentic madman and his uncanny refraction of both acting and spectatorship. This essay develops Henry IV’s implications for attempting to represent the ways consciousness and especially the sense of a continuous self arise in the perceptual field. Drawing from ideas about subjective experience and sensory phenomena from Merleau-Ponty and Bert States, I dwell particularly on the doctor’s idea of a “cure,” which involves animating the anachronistic portraits of Henry and Marchioness Matilda of Tuscany by replacing the paintings with the costumed younger generation who has grown up to resemble perfectly their former selves. Hinging on the conflation of static self-image with the medium of portrait painting (and its corollary opposite: the conflation of selfhood’s mutability with the medium of live performance), this attempted cure probes the ontological status of identity through the juxtaposition of mediums.\n\nThe book, in addition to offering a contribution to the studies about Pirandello, proposes a reading of the \"stage fact\" through a documentary and philological route constituted of unpublished material that winds within the notebooks jealously guarded by the Master since 1938 until his death, and now preserved in the Costa Archive in Florence. Founder of Piccolo Teatro di Roma (1948-1954), Orazio Costa brings to the stage the plays written by Pirandello during that time: through a transcoding process of the literary texts of Six Characters in Search of an Author and Right You Are (If You Think So), we are witnessing a new dramatic writing that, while remaining philologically faithful to Pirandello's text, increases its poetic potential.\n\nPaolo and Vittorio Taviani’s latest film, Cesare deve morire (Caesar Must Die, 2012), extends many of Luigi Pirandello’s questions identity and individual fragmentation, authenticity, and art’s relationship to freedom. The film takes place within Rome’s maximum-security prison at Rebibbia, and casts its inmates as interpreters for Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. Outside the English playwright’s formal script, a prisoner pronounces a haunting statement: “Da quando ho conosciuto l’arte questa cella è diventata una prigione.” This both chilling declaration is emblematic of Pirandello’s Orestes in the moment he locates the tear in the paper sky. As Pirandello’s allegory originates on the theatrical stage, the directors transpose it onto the cinematic from within the penitentiary. A consequence to the convicts’ exposure to art, the prison walls metaphorically materialize, dilating the space of the remote world beyond them and shrinking that of their cells. The awareness of confinement and isolation—a meta/physical imprisonment—is a conundrum Pirandello engaged with throughout his career as an author. My paper explores the ways in which the film references a number of Pirandello’s oeuvre and how the directors grapple with Pirandellian themes. The directors, however, perpetuate the same sense of aporia and do not resolve Pirandello’s existential puzzles. Rather, they reboot the same questions over one century later through the cinematic medium. Ultimately, the same unanswerable questions remain, and new answers remain questionable.\n\n\"In 2005 Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre Company (PICT) commissioned and produced Thomas Kilroy's Henry, an adaptation of Luigi Pirandello's Enrico IV [Henry IV]. Following Kilroy's success with Six Characters in Search of an Author, at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, his Irish-American Henry, opened new roads of reception of Pirandello's classic on both sides of the Atlantic. This paper will compare Kilroy's adaptation against Pirandello's original both in terms of plot development and technical originalities, emphasizing those aspects that made this play accessible and enjoyable to a mixed audience at the turn of the 21st century. While the theatrical aspects of Henry's madness were underlying in Pirandello¿s original, Kilroy explicitly takes these features and transforms the protagonist in a famous Hollywood actor of the golden age of American cinema, seemingly directing a play with four young actors passionate about Shakespeare and Pirandello as well as Henry's old movies, playing his \"privy counsellors\", and his nephew, Carl acting like the stage manager, unaware that Henry has hidden the truth behind the screens upstage. Using TV screens and photographs instead of mirrors and paintings, Kilroy underlines the multimedia-like qualities of the play, creating a parallel dimension led by Henry and mostly visible only to him, that afterwards moves downwards including the rest of the cast. Finally, I will underline Henry's superior position in leading most of the action, as noted by Kilroy's stage directions, as a 'revengeful and dark Prospero', and we will see how Shakespeare's plays as well as Kilroy's own Talbot's Box, could have been influential in Kilroy's shaping of Henry.\"\n\nLuigi Pirandello's play, Six Characters in Search of an Author (1921, Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore) portrays numerous significant and functional characteristics of metatheatre, a concept coined by Lionel Abel. By drawing on such metatheatrical features and the play within a play technique, Pirandello's play presents six characters that are in search of an author. This study will, therefore, explain the concept of metatheatre and present a critical analysis of the play, Six Characters as a self-reflexive play. In this critical engagement with the text through specific references from the play and relevant secondary sources, important themes in the play such as reality and illusion, life, art, and the representation of the family in the play will be analysed. This analysis will ultimately demonstrate that Pirandello presents six characters that are self-conscious of their position as dramatic characters that manage to act out their roles, which actually reveal the family relationships between the characters."
