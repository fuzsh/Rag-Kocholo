        "text": "(1867–1936). The Italian dramatist, novelist, and short-story writer Luigi Pirandello became famous as an innovator in modern drama with his creation of the “theater within the theater” in the 1920s. Pirandello’s plays reflect his compassionate, yet despairing, view of the world as a place where there is no objective reality. (See also drama, “The Beginning of Modern Drama.”)\n\nPirandello was born on June 28, 1867, in Agrigento, Italy. He attended several schools in Italy before receiving a doctorate from the University of Bonn, Germany, in 1891. In 1894 he married the wealthy Antonietta Portulano. For a while this gave him the financial independence to devote his time to writing. Then a landslide shut down the factory in which his wife’s money was invested, and he was forced to earn his living by teaching.\n\nPirandello published several short stories and novels, beginning in 1894. He achieved success with his third novel, The Late Mattia Pascal, published in 1904, but it was not until the 1920s that Pirandello published the plays that brought him world attention. In Six Characters in Search of an Author (1921) and Henry IV (1922), Pirandello deals with the relativity of truth and the contrast between art and life. In Six Characters the characters of a play confront and interact with the author of the play and the actors portraying them."
