That is, he gave literature a certain social strength because he broke the code of silence which had kept Sicily and the entire world in chains for centuries. He expressed his legacy to the world in one of his final books, La Sicilia Come Metafora (Sicily as Metaphor)\n\n“I am rather an Italian writer who knows the Sicilian reality well.

(Cited in Montante, “Leonardo Sciascia: The Intellectual Writer,” p. 337)."
