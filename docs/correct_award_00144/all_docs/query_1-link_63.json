        "text": "Having spent the week here writing about fiction written by Ôe Kenzaburo has solidified my skepticism that he deserved a Nobel Prize for literature. I think that the first Japanese to receive the honor. Kawabata Yasunari (1899-1972), was a plausible candidate for the honor in 1968, though were it my choice of a Japanese writer alive during the 1960s I would have chosen Tanizaki Junichiro (who had died before the 1968 award went to Kawabata) or Mishima Yukio. In contrast, I don’t have a stronger contender among Japanese writers, ca. 2018 (not having read the Japanese-German Tawada Yoko). The Japanese writer recurrently mentioned more recently as a possible candidate, Murakami Haruki (1949-) had published some books that received international attention (A Wild Sheep Chase, Norwegian Wood) but did not have a large body of work.\n\nFrom the Japanese contenders, I went to look at the list of all the winners. I have split the ones I have read enough of to have an opinion into three classes (each listed in the chronological order of their award):\n\nChoices I consider plausible or better (inclusion in this category is far from being an endorsement of all of their work, however!)\n\nRudyard Kipling\n\nSelma Lagerlöf\n\nRabindranath Tagore\n\nKnut Hamsum\n\nW.B. Yeats\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw\n\nThomas Mann\n\nSinclair Lewis\n\nIvan Bunin\n\nLuigi Pirandello\n\nEugene O’Neill\n\nRoger Martin du Gard\n\nHerman Hesse\n\nAndré Gide\n\nT. S.

Forster, W. H. Auden, Elizabeth Bishop, Anna Akhmatova, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, R. K.
