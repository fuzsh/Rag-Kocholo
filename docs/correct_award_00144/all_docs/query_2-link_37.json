        "text": "2.  Family  Education  Marriage  Selected works  Quotes  Memory  Award\n\n3. Luigi Pirandello , an Italian dramatist, novelist, poet and short story writer, was born on the 28th of June 1867 in Girgenti (now Agrigento) on the island of Sicily.\n\n4. Pirandello was born into an upper- class family. His father was a sulfur dealer. His mother was also of a well-to-do background, descending from a family of the bourgeois professional class of Agrigento. Pirandello received his elementary education at home. In 1880, the Pirandello family moved to Palermo, where Luigi completed his high school education.\n\n5. His father expected his son to take up his trade, but Luigi excelled in his academics and was allowed to pursue a literary schooling. He entered the University of Rome in 1887,later transferring into Bonn University where he completed a doctoral thesis on his native Sicilian dialect.\n\n6. Following his father's suggestion, in 1894 he married a shy, withdrawn girl of a good family Antonietta Portulano. His wife suffered from severe mental illness, which gave him a deeper insight into the working of the mind. But despite of this fact they had two sons (Stefano and Fausto) and a daughter (Lietta).\n\n7.  His was inspired by his Own life. Throughout his life he wrote more than 350 stories, most of which contained themes ground in reality and everyday life\n\n8. Novels 1902: Il turno (The Turn) 1904: Il fu Mattia Pascal (The Late Mattia Pascal) 1908: L'esclusa (The Excluded Woman) 1911: Suo marito (Her Husband) 1913: I vecchi e i giovani (The Old and the Young) 1925: Quaderni di Serafino Gubbio (Serafino Gubbio's Journals) 1926: Uno, nessuno e centomila (One, No one and One Hundred Thousand) Plays 1917: Così è (se vi pare) (So It Is (If You Think So)) 1917: Il piacere dell'onestà (The Pleasure of Honesty) 1918: Il giuoco delle parti (The Rules of the Game) 1921: Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore (Six Characters In Search of an Author) 1922: Enrico IV (Henry IV) 1922: L'imbecille (The Imbecile) 1922: Vestire gli ignudi (Clothing The Naked) 1923: L'uomo dal fiore in bocca (The Man with the Flower In His Mouth) 1923: La vita che ti diedi (The Life I Gave You) 1924: Ciascuno a suo modo (Each In His Own Way\n\n9. Most of his plays are staged in different countries all over the world even nowadays.\n\n12. He is still remembered not only in Sicilia, where he is considered as a national hero. You can see a bust of Luigi Pirandello in the public park in Buenos Aires. You can also find monuments in the Giardino in Palermo, and in front of the Luigi Pirandello's House Museum.\n\n13. Pirandello was nominated Academic of Italy in 1929 Moreover, he has ,perhaps, the highest award in the world literature and drama: the Nobel Prize.
