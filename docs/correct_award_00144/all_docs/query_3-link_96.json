        "text": "Pirandello's birthplace is located in a district called \"the Caos,\" an area halfway between Agrigento and Porto Empedocle, in the southern part of Sicily. It is set on a hill facing the Mediterranean sea, in a natural setting full of olive trees and centuries-old oaks. Here you will instantly feel to go back in time.\n\nWe recommend you to drop by this place so important in Pirandello's life. You will find yourself enveloped in the atmospheres in which the author recounted the malaise of the petty-bourgeois class of his time.\n\nOver the years he established himself as an internationally renowned playwright. In 1934 his talent was rewarded with the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nOn the hill in front of Pirandello’s house is the forecourt of the funerary monument containing his ashes. You can reach it by a picturesque scenic path that faces the sea.\n\nHis last will reads out: «Please burn me. And may my newly burned body be scattered or walled up in some rough stone in the countryside of Girgenti, where I was born.»\n\nAndrea Camilleri - the renowned author of the Commissario Montalbano's novels - is also personally linked to this will: he personally helped moving the ashes from Rome to Agrigento.\n\nThis evocative corner was chosen as his burial place, at the foot of the centuries-old pine tree where Luigi used to chat with friends or reflect in solitude. Today only part of that tree remains – it was uprooted by a storm in 1997 - but the atmosphere within this place is still intact.\n\nDrop in and you will experience the same feelings as the young Pirandello.\n\nIn 2021 the house-museum experience was completely revamped. Now visitors can refer to many multimedia accesses with audio-visual content about Pirandello's life and works.\n\nIt’s a brand new way to embark on an emotional journey through the wonders of the writer’s poetics.\n\nA free Android and IoS app is also available to follow the tour with in-depth content, 3D augmented reality images, and audio podcasts.\n\nThe entire visiting experience is divided into conceptual levels that recall the main themes of Pirandello's poetics: masks, madness, the three strings, humour and relativism.\n\nThe house-museum also displays a selection of original documents that chronologically follow the writer's life.\n\nThe available audioguides provide in-depth content for everyone willing to deepen into each specific text and manuscript.\n\nMoreover the house collection hosts a series of authentic paintings made by some members of the Pirandello’s family, including his sister Lina and son Stefano.\n\nThey depict scenes of life and landscapes typical of Sicily at the time, so dear to the writer.\n\nVisiting Pirandello's house-museum in Agrigento is a first step in getting closer to the life and works of one of the greatest representatives of Italian literature. Works such as Il Fu Mattia Pascal, Il Berretto a Sonagli and Uno, nessuno e centomila are excellent examples to better understand our identity and our living in the world.\n\nLuigi Pirandello is waiting for you here, in his home in Agrigento. He’ll show you his life as a Sicilian who conquered the world through the power of his own words."
