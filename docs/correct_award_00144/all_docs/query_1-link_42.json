Sanders Auctions (http://www.NateDSanders.com).\n\nFree Appraisal, Auction or Sell Your Luigi Pirandello Signed Photo\n\nLuigi Pirandello (Italian: [luˈiːdʒi piranˈdɛllo]; 28 June 1867 – 10 December 1936) was an Italian dramatist, novelist, poet, and short story writer whose greatest contributions were his plays. He was awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature for “his almost magical power to turn psychological analysis into good theatre. He was an Italian nationalist and supported Fascism in a moderate way, at one point giving his Nobel Prize medal to the Fascist government to be melted down as part of the 1935 Oro alla Patria [it] (“Gold to the Fatherland”) campaign during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Pirandello’s works include novels, hundreds of short stories, and about 40 plays, some of which are written in Sicilian. Pirandello’s tragic farces are often seen as forerunners of the Theatre of the Absurd.\n\nBelow is a recent realized price for a Luigi Pirandello signed photo. We at Nate D. Sanders Auctions can obtain up to this amount or more for you:\n\nLuigi Pirandello Signed Photo. Sold for over $1,000.\n\nHere are some Nobel Prize medals we have sold in the past:\n\nNobel Prize Awarded to Physiologist Alan Lloyd Hodgkin in 1963 — Won for His Revolutionary Research on the Central Nervous System\n\nThe 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to physiologist Alan Lloyd Hodgkin for establishing the propagation mechanism of nerve impulses called action potentials — consequently helping to understand the mechanism behind disorders such as multiple sclerosis, seizures and Parkinson’s disease. Hodgkin is also responsible for identifying the Hodgkin Cycle and, along with colleagues Andrew Fielding Huxley and John Carew Eccles, hypothesized the existence of ion channels on cell membranes, a concept which took over 20 years to confirm; that confirmation earned Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann the 1991 Nobel Prize. This Nobel Prize medal is made of 23k gold and features the relief portrait of Alfred Nobel, with his name and the years of his birth and death. Verso features the words, ”INVENTAS VITAM JUVAT EXCOLUISSE PER ARTES”, which translates from Latin to, ”Inventions enhance life which is beautified through art”. A.L. Hodgkin’s name and the year 1963 in Roman numerals are engraved on a plaque below the relief, framed by the words, ”REG. UNIVERSITAS MED-CHIR-CAROL”. On the right side is the name ”E LINDBERG”, who designed the prize. Comes with 6 original photographs of Hodgkin (at least 4 of which are from the ceremony in Oslo on 10 December 1963), a New York Times article on Hodgkin dated 18 October 1963, a portion of a 1976 issue of ”The Journal of Physiology” featuring an essay by Hodgkin, and the official 1963 English edition of the Nobel Prize publication, featuring Hodgkin and partner Huxley on the cover. Medal is housed in the maroon leather presentation box with a white satin lining and Hodgkin’s name printed on the front. Box measures 5.5” x 5.5” x 1”. Medal measures 6.5 cm or 2.56” in diameter, and weighs 196 g or 6.9 oz, consistent with the original Nobel Prizes awarded in 1963. Presented in near fine condition. With an LOA from the daughter of Dr. Alan Hodgkin. Sold for $795,614.\n\nNobel Prize Awarded to Physicist Leon Lederman in 1988 — Won for His Groundbreaking Discovery of a New Atomic Particle — One of Only 10 Nobel Prizes Ever to Be Auctioned\n\nThe 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics, awarded to particle physicist Leon Lederman for his discovery of the muon neutrino, a particle 200 times the size of an electron. Lederman, along with colleagues Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger, found the muon neutrino in 1962 while using a high energy particle accelerator. They discovered that in some cases a muon (rather than an electron) was produced, illuminating the existence of a new atomic particle. Lederman was also instrumental in the discovery of the bottom quark in 1977, and was the champion of the Superconducting Super Collider. His popular 1993 book ”The God Particle: If the Universe is The Answer, What is The Question” was released to critical acclaim. This Nobel Prize is made of 18kt gold, plated in 24k gold, as were all Nobel Prize medals awarded after 1980. Medal features the relief portrait of Alfred Nobel to front, with his name and the years of his birth and death. Verso features a relief of the Goddess Isis, whose veil is held up by a woman who represents the genius of science. Encircling the medal are the words ”Inventas vitam juvat excoluisse per artes”, translating to ”And they who bettered life on earth by their newly found mastery”. Lederman’s name and 1988 in Roman numerals are engraved on a plaque below the relief of the two women, with ”Reg. Acad. Scient. Suec.” also written, an abbreviation for The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Etched upon the medal is the name of Erik Lindberg, designer of the Nobel medal. Housed in the original red leather case with Leon Lederman’s name gilt stamped. Medal weighs 173 grams or just over 6 oz. and measures 2.5” in diameter, consistent with the original Nobel Prize awarded in 1988. Case measures 5.5” x 5.5” x 1”. Presented in near fine condition, and with an LOA from Leon Lederman. Sold for $765,002.\n\nNobel Prize Won by Walter Kohn, One of the Children Saved by Kindertransport During World War II\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry won by Walter Kohn in 1998, unique not only for the scientific impact of Kohn’s work, but also for his life experience as one of the children rescued from Nazi-occupied territories in World War II through the Kindertransport program. Kindertransport was established by the United Kingdom in 1938 immediately after the ”Night of Broken Glass” pogrom in Germany, authorizing the safe passage of almost 10,000 children into the UK. The children were placed in homes throughout the British empire, with Kohn ultimately finding a home in Canada after both his parents were killed in the Holocaust. In addition to his Nobel Prize, lot also includes three science books that Kohn purchased at the temporary internment camp in Canada, all still housed in their well-worn homemade dust jackets: ”A Course of Pure Mathematics”, ”Dent’s Modern Science Series”, and ”Properties of Matter”.\n\nThe books are a foreshadowing to the incredible achievements that Kohn made to the world through his Nobel Prize-winning work. As the architect of density functional theory (DFT), Kohn devised the computational quantum mechanical modelling system that has allowed scientists to understand the nuclear structure of microscopic matter. Though the underlying structure of NFT is complex, the actual equations are now commonplace among scientists, with countless practical results deriving from it – from discovering trace impurities in chemicals to modeling planetary systems.\n\nNobel Prize is made of 18kt gold, plated in 24kt gold, consistent with the 1998 medals. Medal features the relief portrait of Alfred Nobel to front, with his name and the years of his birth and death. Reverse features a relief of the Goddess Isis, whose veil is held up by a woman who represents the genius of science. Encircling the medal are the words ”Inventas vitam juvat excoluisse per artes”, translating to ”And they who bettered life on earth by their newly found mastery”. Kohn’s name and 1998 in Roman numerals are engraved on a plaque below the relief of the two women, with ”Reg. Acad. Scient. Suec.” also written, an abbreviation for The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Etched upon the medal is the name of Erik Lindberg, who designed the Nobel medal. Medal weighs 173 grams or just over 6 oz. and measures 2.5” in diameter. Near fine condition. With an LOA from the Kohn family. Sold for $457,531.\n\nNobel Prize Awarded to Chemist Heinrich Wieland, the Founder of Modern Biochemistry — The Only Nobel Prize in Chemistry Ever to Be Auctioned\n\nThe 1927 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, awarded to Dr. Heinrich Otto Wieland, considered the father of modern biochemistry. This Nobel is the only Prize in Chemistry to ever be auctioned. Wieland spent his life’s work investigating the oxidation processes in living cells, and has been credited with unifying the disciplines of organic chemistry and biochemistry, which had been split since the work of chemist Justus von Liebig in the 1870’s. Wieland’s research into bile acid was used as the basis for the manufacture of drugs for the treatment of a wide variety of cardiovascular diseases, underpinning his recognition as the founder of modern biochemistry. As a result of his groundbreaking work in the field of chemistry, the Heinrich Wieland Prize was established and endowed in his honor in 1964, awarded to leading scientists for their work in the fields of biochemistry, chemistry and physiology, and counting four Nobel Laureates among its recipients. Wieland was also a strident opponent of the Nazi party; he employed and hid several Jews and supporters of the White Rose Nazi resistance movement in his laboratory at the University of Munich, which was given the nickname ”The Ghetto Room”. Wieland even courageously defended his student Hans Leipelt in court, who was convicted for collecting money for the widow of Kurt Huber, Wieland’s colleague who moonlighted as a White Rose resistance leader. Huber and Leipelt were both tried and executed in 1943.

Donnall Thomas for his use of bone marrow transplants to treat leukemia and other blood cancers. Awarded the Nobel Prize in 1990, Thomas first published his theory on BMT treatments in ”The New England Journal of Medicine” in 1957, and then worked methodically throughout the 1960s and 70s to turn the theory into a clinical treatment, despite it being dismissed at the time as implausible and experimental. In the latter half of the 20th century, the treatment slowly gained acceptance, with approximately 60,000 transplants now occurring each year, bringing the survival rate for some cancers from zero to near 90%. Bone marrow transplants are now considered one of the greatest success stories in cancer treatment.\n\nNobel Prize is made of 18kt gold, plated in 24kt gold, consistent with the 1990 medals.

Snell for his scientific discovery that directly led to saving lives through organ transplantation. Snell – known as the Father of Immunogenetics, won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, the genetic foundation of a body’s immunological response to tissue and organ transplants, determining whether an organ is accepted by the body or rejected as a foreign invader. Prior to Snell’s work, organ transplantation was entirely dependent on chance as to whether a genetic match would allow an organ to be accepted; afterwards, the only impediment was the availability of organs. Nearly 150,000 organ transplants are now performed each year, with millions of lives over the course of 40 years saved as a result.\n\nNobel Prize is made of 18kt gold, plated in 24kt gold, consistent with the 1980 medals.

Schelling, the foremost expert on game theory as it applies to nuclear weaponry and international relations, and whose theory is particularly relevant now. Schelling is famously credited with the concept of ”uncertain retaliation”, expressed in his 1960 book, ”The Strategy of Conflict”, in which he argued that unpredictability, a higher tolerance for risk, and a willingness to feign irrationality in decision making can lead, if performed correctly, to a superior position over one’s opponents — especially with nuclear weapons. This so-called ”Madman Theory” was used by Richard Nixon in his negotiations with the Soviet Union and North Vietnam, and many experts have stated that both Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un are currently using the strategy in negotiating with each other. Schelling was also one of the “founding fathers” of the modern, leadership-oriented John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and made wide-ranging policy contributions helping to curtail smoking, confront racial segregation, and address climate change.\n\nNobel medal, made of 18K gold, prominently bears the image of Alfred Nobel upon the obverse, with ”Sveriges Riksbank Till Alfred Nobels Minne 1968” applied in raised letters, encircling the medal. ”T.C.
