        "text": "Pulsar Content has secured worldwide sales on Michele Placido‘s “Eternal Visionary,” a film about the life of Luigi Pirandello, the Italian playwright, novelist and poet who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1934.\n\nPirandello is played by Fabrizio Bentivoglio, one of Italy’s best known actors whose credits include “Loro,” “The Invisible Boy” and “Human Capital.” Bentivoglio stars opposite filmmaker and actor Valeria Bruni Tedeschi (“Anaïs In Love,” “The Divide”) who stars as Pirandello’s wife. Federica Luna Vincenti completes the cast.\n\nThe movie opens in 1934 as Pirandello is traveling to Stockholm, where he is about to receive the Nobel Prize. He starts reliving the drama and magic of the loved ones who have populated his life and inspired his art. He reminisces about the madness of his wife, his stormy relationship with his children, his controversial stance towards fascism and his love for Marta Abba, the young actress who became his muse.\n\nNow in post-production, the film boasts an ambitious budget (by Italy’s standards) of €12.5 million. It marks Placido’s follow up to “Caravaggio’s Shadow,” which sold worldwide and was a critical hit. “Eternal Visionary” is produced by Goldenart Production (Placido’s “7 Minutes”) and Rai Cinema, with Gapbusters (“Freaks Out”) co-producing. Pulsar Content will introduce an exclusive promo-reel to buyers at the European Film Market in Berlin.\n\n“‘Eternal Visionary’ is a journey into a genius’ mind and heart, as well as his dark sides, obsessions and ambitions,” said Marie Garrett, Pulsar Content co-founder. “The footage we’ll reveal at the EFM is absolutely stunning and promises another great film in Michele Placido’s impressive track record.”\n\nThe film will be distributed by 01 Distribuzione in Italy."
