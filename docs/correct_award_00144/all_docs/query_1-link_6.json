Souls have their own needs and their own ambitions, which the body ignores when it sees that it’s impossible to satisfy them or achieve them.” ― Luigi Pirandello\n\n“Whatever is a reality today, whatever you touch and believe in and that seems real for you today, is going to be, like the reality of yesterday, an illusion tomorrow.” ― Luigi Pirandello\n\n“If only we could see in advance all the harm that can come from the good we think we are doing.” ― Luigi Pirandello, Six Characters in Search of an Author\n\n“Inevitably we construct ourselves. Let me explain. I enter this house and immediately I become what I have to become, what I can become: I construct myself. That is, I present myself to you in a form suitable to the relationship I wish to achieve with you. And, of course, you do the same with me.” ― Luigi Pirandello\n\n“For man never reasons so much and becomes so introspective as when he suffers ; since he is anxious to get at the cause of his sufferings, to learn who has produced them, and whether it is just or unjust that he should have to bear them. On the other hand, when he is happy, he takes his happiness as it comes and doesn’t analyse it, just as if happiness were his right.” ― Luigi Pirandello, Six Characters in Search of an Author\n\n“It is so.When YOU think so” ― Luigi Pirandello\n\n“…my real love has always been the sleep that rescued me by allowing me to dream.” ― Luigi Pirandello\n\n“I present myself to you in a form suitable to the relationship I wish to achieve to you.” ― Luigi Pirandello"
