        "text": "Two years ago, I visited my sister for a week in Rome, where she was studying abroad. From Bernini sculptures to plates of carbonara, I found much to love about Italian culture, art, and cuisine. As a college freshman, I knew I wanted to study abroad, and my week in Italy had been dreamy and indulgent. Rome seemed like the perfect place to escape for a few months, so upon returning to Rice University, I signed up for an Italian class.\n\nLast summer, I then interned at a Rome-based political think tank, in what I thought would be my one and only study abroad stint. But as I practiced interacting with locals in Italian and explored the European approach to global politics at my internship, I realized I would not be able to stay away from Rome for long. Temporarily leaving America’s entrenched cultural and political environment had expanded my understanding of the world to dimensions I never expected, sparking my interest in international relations and diplomacy.\n\nBetween my love of Italian culture and my desire to discover the broader world, I knew I had unfinished business in Rome. As an ancient cradle of democracy, the heart of a once-vast empire, the center of one of the world’s most influential religions, and the birthplace of fascism, Rome is a nexus of interwoven historical threads and political themes, making it ideal for my academic interests. So, last semester, I returned as a student in an international relations program\n\nThrough courses on Machiavelli, fascism, and Italian immigration, I was able to dive headfirst into Italian political and historical topics that I only got a taste of the previous summer. My professors led field trips to important sites in the Eternal City, including the Altar of the Fatherland, Castel Sant’Angelo, the Roman Forum, and the EUR district. My favorite class of all was a course on Ancient Roman history taught entirely in Italian. By combining Italian comprehension practice with a topic I am passionate about learning, I deeply enriched my language skills and my understanding of Roman history through the course."
