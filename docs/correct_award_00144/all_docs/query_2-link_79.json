        "text": "This article examines the major biographies of the Italian modernist writer Luigi Pirandello and documents their striking practice of interpreting Pirandello's fictional texts through the prism of autobiography. It argues that the non-literary or paraliterary status traditionally accorded to biography as a form has prevented an examination of the implications for criticism of the role of biography, and therefore this habitual slippage between biography and fiction has been neglected. The article analyses the overlap between biography, fiction, and criticism which characterizes much writing on Pirandello and suggests a critical approach which might take these slippages into account, as well as contribute, in a broader context, to the critical reassessment of biography as a form.\n\nLuigi Pirandello (1867-1936) was an Italian modernist writer and playwright who enriched literature with questions of modern identity as it relates to the contradiction between human consciousness and reality. Pirandello pondered questions of art and reality, mask and essence, life and form, and the fragmentation of a personality. In his works, he also foresaw what would later constitute the base of existential philosophy.\n\nPirandello&#39;s Six Characters in Search of an Author was an innovative juncture in theatre with its avant-garde dramatic devices. Pirandello has presented the idea of the relation between the author and his creation and highlighted the disappearance of the subject in the narrative. The present study employs Foucault&#39;s idea of the author function in the play to explore the effort of the characters to present their narrative while the author has disappeared. The unexpected entry of six self-conscious characters illustrates and emphasizes the creative process and the continuity of the artistic works. The study finds that Pirandello has skillfully handled the theatricality resulting in a novel perspective of the theatre and shed light on the freedom of the characters that symbolizes the text, and drafted their story as they like. It, further, pinpoints their quest and success in mastering authority over their discourse in the absence of their creator.\n\nDuring the 20th century many questions and doubts were raised about almost everything. People started to doubt everything about human life and thinking, as Freud and his followers discovered and studied the unconscious, breaking down the belief in human beings having a single and plain personality. In addition to Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity and other scientific discoveries, it seemed that human beings did no longer exist in a rational and clear universe. That fact led to forms of arts and literature that dealt with fragment images, beliefs and ideas of their time. Artists of modernism as a response to this new and bewildering sense of a world consisted of unreliable and constantly shifting pieces, they experimented with new forms to express and reflect the new vision of the reality.\n\nThe book, in addition to offering a contribution to the studies about Pirandello, proposes a reading of the \"stage fact\" through a documentary and philological route constituted of unpublished material that winds within the notebooks jealously guarded by the Master since 1938 until his death, and now preserved in the Costa Archive in Florence. Founder of Piccolo Teatro di Roma (1948-1954), Orazio Costa brings to the stage the plays written by Pirandello during that time: through a transcoding process of the literary texts of Six Characters in Search of an Author and Right You Are (If You Think So), we are witnessing a new dramatic writing that, while remaining philologically faithful to Pirandello's text, increases its poetic potential."
