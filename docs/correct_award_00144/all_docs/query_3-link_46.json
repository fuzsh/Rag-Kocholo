        "text": "Alicia Upano\n\nFrom Taormina, a trendy city on the eastern coast of Sicily, Italy appears as a haze in the distance, like a mountain transparent but undeniable in presence, like islands staring at one another across the expanse of water, made from the same fury, same passion but separate entities nonetheless. Sicily remains disconnected from Italy by more than the channel that both the Sicilians and Italians refuse to bridge. It is the creation of Lady Etna, erupting only an hour south of Taormina, spreading her ashes and telling her story.\n\nLady EtnaÕs land and tales were a muse to many a writer. Sicily, it is said, has produced more writers than any other region in Italy, notably with the awarding of two Nobel Prizes for Literature to Sicilians in the 20th century, the first, to novelist and playwright Luigi Pirandello in 1934 and the second to poet Salvatore Quasimodo 25 years later. Sicilian writers were the leaders of verismo, a refined version of French naturalism, a genre to which Giovanni Verga belonged. In their lifetimes, these writers had left their native Sicily for writing careers and fanciful lives in Italy, but they lived haunted by the island, returning in late life, or at least, death.\n\nThe eastern coast was home to both Verga and Quasimodo and, at one time, saw the influx of the wealthy and the famous. Some came seeking sun for their health. Some were film stars, some were artists, some were writers. All were foreign. Bequeathing a written record of a romanticized, beautiful Sicily were the older Guy de Maupassant, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, and Lord Byron to the more recent Tennessee Williams and D.H. Lawrence, who completed Women in Love in the same Taormina villa which Truman Capote finished The Grass Harp in 30 years later.\n\nThey were writers enchanted by the island and its charm, but the islandÕs kin Ð the Sicilians, that is, notably Pirandello, Verga and Quasimodo Ð remained distinct, in a class of their own, and delved straight into the heart of Sicily, to its pain, its madness, its history and its beauty unashamed and unforgiving.\n\nOn the plane to Palermo, my first stop in Sicily, I wondered exactly how the island differed from the mainland. From a volcanic island myself, I could easily recognize the dissimilarities between the American mainland and my native Hawaii, floating in the middle of the Pacific as the most geographically isolated place on earth. There is a six-hour plane ride and a world of difference between Honolulu and Los Angeles and I questioned what distinction was lost and gained in each passing minute on the hour-long plane ride from Rome? I suspected that had I been able to answer that question that I would, then, be able to decipher why Sicilians stories held such urgency and why the pen as a catalyst for voice prevailed against the brush, platform or countless other forms of communication.\n\nI was seeking answers like a reporter on vacation, lazily curious. Flipping through the in-flight magazine, I began to find them. In an article titled ÒSicily Again (Finally)Ó by Antonio Calabro, he writes, ÒItÕs as though even time had changed, as though the purely southern sense of time as reflection, extravagant curiosity and storytelling had given birth to another aspect of itself Ð that of people wanting not only to understand and tell their own story, but also to build it.Ó\n\nI had come as a foreigner, a traveler, an observer and knew that I would not find in ten days the aspects of Sicily that compelled these writerÕs own stories, for those were tales known only by those who knew their land and loved it too well. I did know, however, that I would be easily awed by the island and I was. Sicily is winding roads amongst hills of green, dotted with wild flowers, cities emerging on mountain ridges with slender houses and cathedral bells echoing in the valley below, Casbah-inspired marketplaces, window shopping for faith, and boats sleeping lazily in the harbor, dreaming Odyssey myths and eternal Springs. Sicily, simply, was dancing circles around me.\n\nÒIn my voice / there is at least a sign / of living geometry,Ó Quasimodo wrote, and I wondered, where in QuasimodoÕs living geometry did the tour buses not dare to go and where in my Sicily travels had QuasimodoÕs voice rang unequivocally clear: This is Sicily.\n\nSicilian history is a tale of the conquered. In 2,000 years, the Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans and Spanish dominated the island. Today, the streets of Sicily still exhibit remnants of its tumultuous history, gently mixing contradictory symbols into a product that is whole-heartedly Sicilian.\n\nFor example, in Monreale, near to Palermo, there is a cathedral built by the Norman king in the 1100s. This cathedralÕs architecture, much like the cathedral in Palermo, has Muslim palm trees, eight-pointed stars, and Arab-inspired arches and a Baroque floor. Restaurants serve Italian dishes with couscous, the North African dish, with fresh fish from one of its three shores, the Tyrrhenian, Mediterranean and Ionian seas.\n\nÒSicily is a strange place,Ó Giusy said as we drove down the windy streets from Mount Etna. She is my queen of Sicily, my guide on this brief journey. ÒWeÕve never been given a chance to speak up, weÕve always been conquered and you find a way to speak up. Sometimes thatÕs through literature, through writing.\n\nÒItÕs a Sicilian voice, rising up,Ó she said.\n\nSicilyÕs capitol, Palermo, lies on its northern shore centered on the island. However, it is the eastern shore that is considered the most beautiful, according to Giusy. Is it because of its proximity to Italy? I ask her. Giusy, a native of Catania on the eastern shore, looks at me and smiles, ÒItÕs practically Italy, but itÕs Sicily first.Ó\n\nOn the eastern coast, Quasimodo was born in Modica, south of Syracuse and Verga came from Catania and a small village near Catania, called Vizinni. Although Pirandello was from the southern shore, he shared many of the same qualities of the modern Sicilian writers. Most were men from wealthy families whose wealth afforded them the education and funding needed for a person to survive on writing, though many worked as journalists on Òthe continent,Ó as Sicilians refer to Italy.\n\nFrom Taormina, where I rode gondolas and watched women in bright polyester A-dresses chat in the streets, where restaurants set up tables on their terraces in the mid-morning shade, where gelato is the only cure for heat besides dropping in and out of air-conditioned shops where orange and red ceramics are displayed as the colors of Etna and blunt shopkeepers wait on unassuming customers. From posh Taormina, we headed to Catania, home of Verga, with a detour in the Mercato della Pescheria, one of CataniaÕs famous markets.\n\nOn the eastern shore, Mount Etna watches over the roads, seeming to follow each car just as we thought, as children, that the moon was inescapable, following our car on long road trips. Etna fills my window, she is erupting, slow and silently and I imagine the cities that fatalistically live on her slopes, the people who are drinking their morning caffe and saying, ÒBuon Giorno, Mother Etna,Ó as they hang their freshly washed white sheets on their balconies, knowing full well that by night fall they will be covered with ash. ÒShe never stops,Ó Giusy said.\n\nCatania is the second oldest colony of Greece, rebuilt nine times like a multi-story cake. Giusy is talking about the unemployment rates and Sicilians on strike, Cyclops and Ulysses, followed by an explanation of the differences between squid, octopus, and calamari. Yet, they all combine to what Catania is, a port town shrouded in myth and history but a real city, dirty and crowded and charming, unlike Taormina, which is too perfect and anything too perfect always seems to make me feel uncomfortable. The streets are lined with lights, homeless men slink into doorways with their pets, and the great architecture Ð churches, museums, universities Ð pass by as we head toward the fish market.\n\nFisherman in beanies and yellow aprons sell swordless swordfish, hold squirming octopus in their hands, removing ink sacs that splatter over their aprons. Many are milling around in the crowded piazza and I am making my way to the alleyways, the side sections specialized like open-air aisles in my imaginary supermarket.\n\nA commotion. A short man wearing a red leather jacket runs over to a butcher and snatches a knife. I remembered him, he was in the crowd, dark and handsome, and he smiled. Now, he is running toward a taller man sporting a yellow and white windbreaker, knife in hand, blockades of men between the two. Giusy refuses to translate. There is fear in my eyes and curiosity in the marketÕs clients as if this is sport, this is natural and I envision American supermarkets where the fruit looks like plastic and the meat appears as the farthest thing from a living, breathing animal Ð boneless, skinless neatly cut pieces in Styrofoam and shrink wrap. I feel like a sheltered American girl, yanked from air-conditioned supermarkets where the most exciting thing that happens is the cashier might charge me too much.\n\nThe men seem to be appropriately separated by now and seeing as how I do not desire to find myself between two angry Sicilian men, one of whom has a sharp, dangerous object, I walk out of the fish market and into the more tranquil Ð knifeless Ð cheese section, on to the meat section where carcasses hang in the market air from the stalls as if inspired by long Kashgar days, and on to the fruit section, where blood oranges are proudly displayed. Through the alleys I have finagled myself back onto a city street and by consulting a map, find that I am only two blocks from to the home of Giovanni Verga on Via SantÕAnna.\n\nVerga, born in 1840, lived for nearly 20 years in Milan, Florence and Naples to write and Òfulfill his thirst for glory by having love affairs with elegant ladies,Ó said DH Lawrence, who translated his Cavalleria Rusticana. Verga was a novelist and short story writer, author of Eros, The House by the Medlar Tree and Little Novels of Sicily.\n\nHe returned from the continent with a mistrust for the sophisticated and disgusted with the elite he had once embraced. He began writing about Sicilians, focusing on fisherman, farmers and craftsman, particularly in the towns and villages of his childhood. Some, such as Lawrence, say that he produced his best work after he returned from Italy.\n\nVerga spent his childhood and final years until his death in 1922 in the second floor home of a 19th century palace on Via SantÕAnna. With only one grunting and smiling but essentially speechless conversation with a Sicilian man and a map, I located VergaÕs home. I strolled into the palace courtyard to find middle school-aged children tormenting each other by teasing, pulling on backpack straps and segregating into groups of boys and girls, whispering loudly and pointing. It was relieving, I suppose, to find that the agony of middle school was a universal experience.\n\nThe group was obviously on a school field trip and teachers conducted head counts while some kids talked on their cell phones (I guess it is true that everyone in Sicily has a cell phone and is always using on it. GiusyÕs phone never stops and in brief moments of silence, I continue to hear her phoneÕs jingle play in my head).\n\nVerga is a household name in Sicily, and especially in Catania so I am not surprised to see the kids milling in the courtyard who lack the enthusiasm of, first of all, not getting lost and secondly, to be at the home of a man I had read so much about. In the drawing room of his home, there is a brass plate on white marble inscribed with a dedication to Verga from the townÕs citizens on his 80th birthday.\n\nIn his bedroom, luggage still sits aging in his closet. One box is marked ÒMilan Grand Hotel Continental,Ó appearing as if it had no intention of being used since he returned to Catania. His coats and hats Ð all in a mid-20th century fashion, all black Ð remain in dainty order.\n\nI feel like I am floating in negative space, like dancers imagining themselves from afar Ð this is the space Verga once inhabited, there are his books, his photographs of one-toothed grandmothers, his windows corrugated with age. ItÕs as if a maid, or perhaps a historical society, had cleaned up too well and all we were left with were things, tangible and empty, but a legacy of words extending far beyond these walls.\n\nLike Quasimodo and Pirandello, Verga does not shy away from the reality of Sicilian history. Lawrence, in the Cavalleria Rusticana preface, wrote, ÒThe greedy and the vulgar win all the time: which, alas, is only too true, in Sicily as everywhere else. But Giovanni Verga certainly doesnÕt help them, by preaching humility. He does show them the knife of revenge at their throat.Ó\n\nI think of the man in the market, knife in hand and passionate, a crowd curious and me, strolling through with VergaÕs ghost, riveted.\n\nThe road to Agrigento, birthplace of Pirandello, seems long. From the inland lush hills of central Sicily, the southwest region appears drier, as if waiting for rain and neglected, as if waiting to be recognized. The houses appear to be newer but in worse condition, industrial plants loom on the outskirts of cities and smoke stacks pierce the skyline. Africans, the only Africans IÕve seen in this week of coming and going, are hawking their wares on the road, sitting beside a flag and a blanket of trinkets. An African woman in particular catches my attention as we zoom by, her hair in beautiful braids kissing the small of her back. Besides the flag and trinkets, I saw no car or bicycle beside her and wondered where on this long expanse of road and country does she go when the day is over and how does she get there?\n\nThis is one of the poorest areas of Sicily, Giusy explains, in the 1970s and 1980s farmers had abandoned this region for larger cities, such as Palermo. Bunkers from the war sit on passing hills, they are old iron clunks cluttering the landscape otherwise left to fava bean and artichoke fields. From the quaintness of Cefalu to the mountaintop towns of Erice, I feel that as if everything not beautiful about Sicily has been stashed here. This town, on this road that the bus does not stop, reminds me of dirty Shanghai streets, Soviet-style housing, concrete and overbearing, with trash littered on sidewalks. Is the beautiful and not beautiful so carefully separated in all of Sicily? Everywhere?\n\nOne minute later, on the road out of town, fields of vibrant green greet our entourage, there is a castle on a hill in a distance and fields of crops uninterrupted for miles. There is a cement shed, painted red, that stands beside the road. In large, white spray painted letters, I read, ÒI AM CRAZY FOR YOU.Ó I immediately think of who could have spray painted the message. Was it a tourist who bought a can of spray paint while selecting salami and cheese for a picnic on the beach? A teenage Sicilian passing by on his bicycle? Was it a Madonna lyric they couldnÕt get out of their head? Was it young love in the countryside? I am suddenly bombarded with more pleasant if not mischievous images and realize that only minutes ago I had wondered about some nameless town, demanding not to be forgotten, not to be an insignificant part of Sweet Sicilia, not to be a long blink for the dreamer.\n\nPirandelloÕs backyard is the Sicilian channel. Porto Empedocle, beside Agrigento, lies beneath the cliff of PirandelloÕs birth, the site where he requested to be buried when he died of pneumonia in 1936.\n\nPirandelloÕs ashes were placed in a rock beneath a pine tree, an image that has stamped itself into Agrigento lore, a symbol equated with Pirandello himself. At its base, mother-in-law tongues are spliced with graffiti (perhaps, ÒI am crazy for youÓ in Italian? Again, Giusy refuses to translate, but winks coyly). The branches from the gray tree beckon to the sky. The trunk twists and turns beautifully, a body unto itself.\n\nThe farmhouse of his birth was built at the end of the 18th century in a village that originally belonged to the aristocracy of Agrigento. In PirandelloÕs youth, the town had survived on mining, as did his family. Today, smoke stacks purge the air in the distance, a city developed, buildings clumped together as if by demand with little thought to beauty. In this same city, the Greeks had built magnificent temples, the Valle dei Templei, in the 6th century BC and that remains intact today.\n\nBorn in 1867, Pirandello wrote his first play at the age of 12 and in his late teens, moved to Italy. He became a playwright, novelists, essayist, poet, and short story author. His work includes Six Characters in Search of an Author, Right You Are if You Think You Are, The Oil Jar and Naked Masks.\n\nKnown for his infidelities that drove his wife to madness (ÒA Latin lover,Ó Giusy jests), Pirandello specialized in the theme of Òmetaphysical madnessÓ and created protagonists who were Òpseudo-insane.Ó Unlike Verga and his fellow verismo writers such as Luigi Capuana and Federico De Roberto, Pirandello was a fatalist. Fatalism, Giusy says, is a legacy that Sicilians inherited from the Greeks. In Shoot, Pirandello wrote, ÒI satisfy, by writing, a need to let off steam which is overpowering. I get rid of my professional impassivity, and avenge myself as well; and with myself avenge ever so many others, condemned like myself to be nothing more than a hand that turns a handle.Ó\n\nWriting during the Mussolini era, Pirandello was outspoken in his opinions regarding fascism and its effect on literature. Mussolini had awarded him the title Academician of Italy but Mussolini also specifically requested that Pirandello not receive the Nobel Prize. Despite MussoliniÕs requests, Pirandello was granted the prize several years later. Pirandello endorsed VergaÕs Ònaked and strongÓ literary style, which also clashed with MussoliniÕs literary preferences, and shared QuasimodoÕs desire to speak for the conquered.\n\nÒ... A poet is a poet when he does not renounce his existence in a given country, at a particular time, defined politically. And poetry is the liberty and truth of that time, and not abstract modulations of sentiment,Ó Quasimodo wrote in The Poet and the Politician. Considered a hermetic poet in his early career, his later works exhibited a much more political nature.\n\nQuasimodo, 1901-1968, wrote about landscape and solitude in his earlier words such as And Suddenly, ItÕs Evening. Later works, such as Debit and Credit, deal with religion, political issues and Europe, but Sicilian landscape and history continue to prevail in his work. This is obvious in his poem Lament for the South, ÒÉBut anywhere man will cry the fate of his homeland É / The south is tired of dragging its dead / on the banks of malarial swamps, / tired of solitude, tired of chains, / tired of the curses in its mouth / of all the races that have howled / death in the echo of its wells, / drunk the blood of its hearts.Ó\n\nÒIt seems as if Sicily, in some way, under all her amazing forms of sophistication and corruption, still preserves some flower of pure candor,Ó wrote D.H. Lawrence over half a century ago. Now, I am watching Italy breathe through the haze and Lady EtnaÕs passions are quiescent at my observations. After ten days, I feel I have arrived at my original conjectures about the divide between Italy and this island. But on the way out, I have Giusy, philosophizing beside me."
