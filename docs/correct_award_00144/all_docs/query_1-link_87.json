        "text": "When we talk about Primo Levi’s return home, we are generally speaking of La tregua and the meandering path of switchbacks and setbacks that Levi endured on his trek from Auschwitz to his native Italy. We are also speaking, in the simplest terms, of a hopeful return to familiarity — beyond the Babel of Auschwitz, where translators are not required for the simplest of tasks. In essence, we are talking about the moment in which Levi can speak Italian and expect to be understood. And yet, Levi’s return home to Turin in 1946 is not marked by linguistic comfort. Rather, he is plagued with the incommunicable nature of the Shoah and a problematized linguistic identity as a Jew. In this paper I address just one small aspect of this problematized linguistic identity demonstrated in \"Argon\", the first chapter of Il sistema periodico — that is, Levi’s proffered experience and account of a highly localized and nearly-dead dialect of Piedmont, Judeo-Piedmontese.\n\nPlease contact me if you wish to read any of this work directly. Presented as part of 'Playing With Source Materials: Alterations and Shakespeare's Creative Fabric' at the NeMLA 'Global Spaces, Local Landscapes, and Imagined Worlds' conference, Omni William Penn Hotel, Pittsburgh, PA, April 12, 2018. This paper considers Shakespeare’s use of non-Anglophone sources and dialect within 'Hamlet'. Beneath the question of this play’s three texts and their chronology is a question of origin, which is made more interesting in light of the play’s narrative source, the Amleth myth. This is most likely to have reached Shakespeare via a French translation of a Latin collection of tales by a Danish academic: 'Les Histoires Tragiques' by François de Belleforest. Putting aside any questions about an ‘ur-Hamlet’, the Shakespearean \"translation\" of this tale exists in multiple iterations that appear to respond to a second francophone source: the 'Essais' of Michel de Montaigne. Only a hundred or so years earlier, Anglo-Norman was still a widely-spoken dialect on English soil. In light of Ardis Butterfield’s extensive work on Chaucer’s multiple vernaculars, this paper conceptualises Shakespeare’s English as a French dialect of the language. English worked – and perhaps still works – as a language between languages “based on a system of double derivation…at once Germanic and Romance” (George Watson, ‘Shakespeare and the Norman Conquest’, 617). Furthermore, the Renaissance printing industry is testament to the ways in which dialectical aspects of English were not limited to Shakespeare’s work. If 'Hamlet' is a translational act, then Shakespeare’s \"Englishness\" can be somewhat decentralised. Instead, his \"French English\" contributes an example along the continuum of English, both then and now.\n\nCollecting and art market studies of the eighteenth-century period, which saw the rise of an international art market, used to focus mainly around the circulation of Old Masters’ painted canvases. But the historiography has significantly expanded its scope in the last decades, to include the study of modern drawings. Our paper proposes to recreate the networks and practices of modern drawing collecting, and its disruption on the already well-established French art market, by a detailed study of the collection of drawings bequeathed to the Fabre Museum of Montpellier by Antoine Valedau (1777-1838), a former Parisian stockbroker. These drawings, now preserved in a museum, were originally gathered in portfolios – the practice was traditional for prints or Old Masters drawings, but assembling works from living artists remained unusual. Easily displayed and circulated, they were praised for being the enterprise of a “man of the world, friend of the arts,” who had thus created “a real portable museum which has nothing in common with the album of the lady of fashion, but which presents a real interest, that of assembling for display the worthy productions of our most distinguished artists.” Le Miroir des spectacles, des lettres, des mœurs et des arts, December 11, 1821. This collection, which we confront to other contemporary ensembles such as the Valedau and Chenard collections, as well as the collection of Alexandre du Sommerard, founder of the Cluny Museum, testifies to an emerging market and a growing consideration for modern art. This paper first presents the disrupted context in which this practice appeared at the very end of the 18th century when artists had to adapt to a market in crisis. We will also touch upon the methodological difficulties of retracing collecting practices often founded on gift or exchanges arising from studio sociablity. Provenance search, auction studies and inventory upon decease – the traditional documents of collecting studies – are often unavailing in the case of modern drawing collections. On the other hand, drawing collections, because they are evidence both of intimate links and of aesthetic choices that were less scrutinized and codified, give us unprecedented access to the networks of sociability of eighteenth-century collectors.\n\nIn 1855 the Kingdom of Sardinia, the predecessor State of today's Italy, sent an expeditionary corp of 18.000 soldiers to side with French, British and Ottoman forces during the Crimean War against Russian Empire. The Italian soldiers who died in that war are, since then, buried in the Pangaltı Roman Catholic Cemetery of Istanbul. The cemetery is one of the symbolic landscapes of the Italian heritage of the old Ottoman capital. Between the 19th and the 20th century, the Italian Levantine community in Ottoman Empire lived what the authors defined as its «apogee». During that time the community, whose number was around 30.000 people, had its own institutions such as schools, chamber of commerce, charity associations, churches and newspapers. After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of the republic of Turkey there started the alienation of the non-muslim citizens due to a series of laws and policies addressed to the «turkification» of the society, from commerce to education. For those communities that remained in the country, there were only two options: the assimilation or the conservation of a series of symbols linked to the Italian past in the city. This paper aims to expose this event as a community cohesion symbol by an historical study of the documents kept in the archives of Istanbul. Eventually I hope to analyze the reports of the Pangaltı Roman Catholic Cemetery of Istanbul, edited by François Alphonse Belin, a French historian on the Latins in Ottoman Empire who was the Consul of France in Istanbul from 1868 to 1877. This study will also focus on the aforementioned war memorial, by an interpretation of the articles published in the Italian newspapers printed in Istanbul. A bibliography in French, Italian, Turkish and English, on the Italian Community in Istanbul will then follow. Its cosmopolitan character will also help in contextualizing the urban ambient."
