        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe book we are presenting is called \"Guerra\" (War), in which the Italian writer Luigi Pirandello tells a number of stories where he brings up different aspects of war in the lives of individuals in an extremely sensitive way, drawing inspiration from his war experiences. In the stories of War, through which Pirandello makes a devastating critique of the consequences of war concerning the lives of individuals, the author seems to be more concerned, rather than criticize the political and social aspects of the war, in presenting new ways for proposing man's individuality, his affections and his needs considered not in relation to the war, but in the way they are reflected by the same. For this, Pirandello was able to present a very wide and differentiated group of human beings in War (the novel has more than a hundred characters), creating sensitive and brilliant stories where he gets touched by the most simple characteristics of the spirituality of people, bringing forward his intention of going far beyond the stage of pure condemnation of the war as being inhuman.\n\n1.1. Background of Luigi Pirandello\n\nSection 1: Background of Luigi Pirandello Count Luigi Pirandello (born June 28, 1867, in Ceriacopoli di Girgenti, Italy—died Dec. 10, 1936, in Rome) was an Italian playwright, short-story writer, and novelist who combined a sensibility of psychological observation with a flair for the dramatic. He was a leading figure of early 20th-century European theater. His influence on later playwrights was considerable: Between 1925 and 1965, more than 160 of his plays were staged in France alone. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1934. He moved to Rome during the 1930s and was a severe critic both of fascist dictatorship and of contemporary society. In his last writings, he views human life as meaningless, since every available belief system has proved inadequate to the task of imbuing it with meaning. Pirandello won international acclaim in the 1920s and 1930s with his dramatic scene and play \"Six Characters in Search of an Author.\" It is symbolic of his complexity of thought and technique, incorporating the irrational, involuntary processes of human consciousness (such as daydreaming, fantastic images, and the phonic element of words, etc.), and the play of chance and accidents in character creation. Character realization, his highest technical aim as a technician in the creative domain of literature, when reached, would mean, in his own opinion, the greatest possible respect for life, \"the problem which grips me all the way down to the roots of my hair.\" He settled to live in Lucca, then entered the war shortly after. He fought tenaciously but later fell into an unknown mental state as a result from which he died in 1936.\n\n1.2. Overview of the Story \"War\"\n\nThe story \"War\" by Luigi Pirandello has a very simple and coarse construction, a round plot, and vividly drawn characters. The story takes place in the third year of World War I, which, at the beginning, seemed like a triumphal march of mutual national approval and the highest moral excitement. The plot of the story is typical for this period. War raises heroism and abnegation, but it also awakens the worst human passions, which have no development in peaceful times. The most important psychological effect of voluntary decisions to become war heroes risks at war are hidden. They hoped for the war for Augusto Drusò and for his relatives too. The town in which Augusto Drusò has lived has been roused during all of August, smothered by heat, and while the colored flags and the orders of the day exalted the young people, the old people exchanged worried glances with one another. \"Our boys are going to be war heroes, and they have also become intoxicated by their own courage.\" The columns of the Gazzetta called attention to the great figures of the battles, at the forefront of the movement of troops and at the skirmishes. \"Augusto Drusò, with his general command of the nameless battalion, moved relentlessly from one side to another, spreading enthusiasm and balance everywhere and joy among the villagers.\" I believe it is unnecessary to describe the feelings of the hero who has killed a human being for the first time. The excitement of the first human massacre is a great excitement, and the more successful the murder, the greater and also the more pleasurable it is. However, in Augusto's appearance, the excitement of the murder did not last for a long time, and a feeling of embarrassment and disgust were not slow to arrive. At the forefront of every information was the fact of going back home in a while.\n\n2. Major Characters\n\nThe Barangule (protagonist): He is an ordinary, uncomplicated individual who, despite his clumsiness, is quite honest and serious. He is at a loose end upon arriving in Milan. The same lack of serious occupation prompts his visit to the Countodolo family. The novelty of going to war inclines him to propose to Tilde with the emboldened firearm in hand. Unlike all the other characters in the story, he always behaves as expected. Tilde (Barangule's brother's betrothed): She is a kindly, simple, amiable, somewhat heavy peasant woman, who does not excel in any particular direction. It is implied that she has not much beauty about her. It should also be noted at this stage that she alone among all the characters does not tell a lie but is completely honest and frank in her manner. She fails to immediately recognize Gusmano and describes him as \"a commanding officer, all moustaches and frogged coat\". Gusmano: He is a tall, attractive, and powerfully built peasant with \"muscles two inches thick on his arms\". He is the Bethlehem inheritance intended for Tilde. He fails to recognize the Barangule in the uniform and shoots into the threshold. He then spends the balance of the evening smoking and partying with the Barangule.\n\n2.1. Captain Blunt\n\nHe is a major in the English army and is one of the best English families. He is not very tall, with tight features, has a somber look and has aristocratic hands. Even when he is resting, he tries to convey the tense courage of a soldier. Like the other characters, Captain Blunt feels the vision of reality changing within him. Here, in the beginning, it is observed in the fact that he feels the world transformed into something absurd, accumulation, like handcuffing, everything that before seemed valuable to him. In other passages he wonders about his existence, his head is invaded by unusual questions, feels in a situation as unknown as disturbing. On other occasions, he speaks of bitterness in life because of the laws of war. It is a situation untried, new and disturbing. However, Captain Blunt does not distance himself from this situation; he, like the others, applies his intuitions of being and lets everything happen to him passively.\n\n2.2. Lieutenant D'Andrea\n\nLieutenant D'Andrea is the character who appears most often in Pirandello's \"War\". In part, this is due to his role as a letter writer bringing news to the Countess Silia about her brother and the way in which his letters supply a running commentary on the war situation outside the villa. Like the others, he never goes far or sees action in the story, and most of what we learn about his activities is given by him in his letters. This means that, in the best of detached narrators' fashion, we are given mostly what he wishes us to know. And most of it seems to contain the psychological consolations and confusions of the aristocratic soldiers, with their self-importance, their love of titles, service to the country and the king, their deep discouragement, and wish to die in comfort, preferably near female comforts. Everything we learn about him is based on his letters to the Countess Silia and, to a lesser extent, the lieutenant's commander, Major Leo Guarino. Nothing is said about the lieutenant's background, but we gather that he has little daily work to do, and part of an officer's task in peacetime was maintaining the morale of the privates. In a wartime setting, where most characters engage in prodigious feats of inactivity, we do feel that the officer has little to keep him occupied in the leisure society of the Italian army units. But the Lieutenant D'Andrea who emerges from these written communications is a genuinely nice and thoughtful character.\n\n2.3. The Narrator\n\nBeing a kind of god for the main characters in \"War,\" the narrator becomes a very specific persona with a complex inner world of its own. The combinations of two basic forms of narrative communication are very much alike. The composition of these components is based on the typical concept of outer being, character or participant. The narrator becomes a very complex character due to the development of its inner essence. Edified in the context of underlying and accompanying contents, protagonist's belongings details, debilitated inner life of the narrator naturally attracts a particular interest. He becomes a typical character. The desire to penetrate into his inner world involves the audience in the literary text. The shadows in his deepness, his characteristics and individual expressions are of great significance for the further understanding of the text and are desired by the class participants. The interpretation of the narrator's specifics in \"War\" was achieved on the basis of Luigi Pirandello's routine. Due to the author's unconventional innovations, the protagonist becomes a template of the contemporary verbal understanding of the narrator. The latter serves as a kind of supporting speech genre unit. The deepening of the role of the character in the thematic statement and presenting a literary text is easily applicable. The main characters' dedication constitutes the text with plot. The narrator's inner thoughts, desires and beliefs are very deeply intertwined with the extra-textual reality. The position of the narrator is based on the individual and the collective, revealing the contrasting \"whole\" nature and antithesis.\n\n2.4. The Soldiers\n\nThe soldiers took their places on the dry dirt of the ground, in the shadow of the wagon that had been left standing in one corner, with the little jib hanging on the iron spike. There was nothing to do while waiting for the corporal to come out with the soup. The corporal was hurrying the water along, cursing. From behind the trees along the roadside, a fire of heavy rifle fire, well decided as to pace and noise, passed. A single regular fire, without a change of rhythm. That is how our arms fired. Colt accidentally dropped the round he always carried in his left pocket. It slipped and executed a little rotation of about three meters in the air. He thought that it looked pretty. Then he was in a good humor. He wanted to recapture the bullet by flying, but he missed it. Then he made a jump in the dust to try to catch it. Baldo at that moment called him from behind. They were to go seek water for the canteens in a wood that was seen in the bend of the road.\n\n3. Character Analysis\n\nThe protagonist is undoubtedly Captain Gennaro Cegnor. With admirable energy, he continues his uninvited war against everyone. He remains in the barracks even two days on leave, whenever his wife experiences difficulties with the pregnancy; from time to time, the news sweetens him with a letter or a message, especially the one where he is told that the truck with all the suitcases and the packed-up blanket has left. He devours her activities, opens her letters, cuts the suit-pictures sent by his wife and shows them to everyone. The recommendations written in French left him cold, he urged: \"The kiss, the kiss to my chest; no jewel or flower, nothing, no. Trust in your strength, in the strength of your love, in the strong right of the sincere man who says to you: 'I will never be able to die for you, I will never be ashamed of you.' Or of me! No! If he's the masculine!\" His cruel ferocity; \"a sort of terrible desire of retribution, so ferocious that besides my love for you, that's why I feel my son born.\" - This, the whole tortured and brutalized being, has created Gennaro Cegnor in himself, with that story, with that ideal and with his fate of war.\n\n3.1. Captain Blunt's Leadership Style\n\nLeadership doesn't always have to do with being in charge. Stephen Adly Guirgis said something that we liked so much and that had to do with political leaders, which is \"Our job is to make things better, but we know all too often they just make things worse. But it's our job to still keep on trying, for doing otherwise is a surefire way of making things worse than before... Hell, we might as well profit from the experience and from our frustration and from the frustration of others, because as decadent as it might sound, and as easy as it has been these last several weeks and months, the truth is \"It is easier to roll a boulder down a hill than it is to push it up a hill.\" We believe that the deepest respect and best rewards lie with those who stand shoulder to shoulder with us each day. These are leaders we admire most: team leaders, people who have the humility to put themselves and the good of the team before anything else. In the next page, we will speak of an extraordinary leader and important character of the story. Captain Blunt is the character we put first of the three topics we will try to develop to speak of. That is because he represents the military, like the Colonel represents the Livornese people. His leadership when he falls into the Italian arms is quite clear; he is determined and brave, and he shows all the qualities that one like him should have. But it is with his continual attempts to intimidate the Italian Captain that he annoyed so much. In any case, as Italians, we believe that Captain Blunt can teach a lot about military tactics and cold blood. With his assertive ideas and his thoughtful expressions, he shows to be the character that leads the other soldiers when it is very difficult. When finally Captain Blunt fights against the Italians, he really thinks that he is doing right. How he dies at the end is revealed only at the end of the story. The realization of his own death happens after he decides to give the watch to the Italian Captain.\n\n3.2. Lieutenant D'Andrea's Moral Dilemma\n\nThe lieutenant is a contradictory character whose personality splits in two every time he is near the sick man, whose train he has been ordered to guard. His passion for gambling leads him to ask the old woman to secure the epileptic's ticket and then claim compensation for an illness similar to the sick man's. However, he is a good person. Never after his confession is a gentiluomo to act, does the lieutenant remember about his plan to ensure free access to the sick man. He felt he was under an obligation not to abuse his privileged position. A chivalrous instinct prevented him from revealing what lay behind the ironic diplomatic expressions the Lieutenant General always used in order to avoid revealing his true situation and, hence, getting the VIP saloon. Well aware of his tender-heartedness, the lieutenant had asked the Marquis not to give him the conditions for the detention. I don't have the urge to kill in me right now. He meant he did not want to be touched by weakness. What would a poor old woman do in the forward part of the colonel, far removed from all amenities? he replied to the Marquis' question. He could not help himself or get away if he was treated as a gallant officer. By simply giving a fleeting glance at him, and no more should anything befoul him. The other part of his consciousness is angry with the chaplain after he reveals the truth about the old woman. Deputy Monza's protest, Gerace's ironic expressions, and the persuasive prayers of others who wanted to get access to the sick man, impaired the lieutenant's good mood. The soul split into two halves. Finally, the humiliations suffered by the colonel caused by the acts of the shameless trickster, to quote D'Andrea, made an indelible impression on the orderly.\n\n3.3. The Narrator's Perspective\n\nWe showed that, strictly speaking, no unique \"opposition\" is fully developed in \"War\" with only 41 lines creating a special mood of hatred or looming interdivision related to the concept of state or inter-war rivals as such. But we also noted that the military theory of \"transforming enemy to an abstract object\" might be the key to understanding military conflict as a whole. Based on these observations (as well as on the original work by L. Pirandello), a plausible solution could be to search for a super-main character who would occupy the highest level of antagonist scale. After all, our narrator might seem similar to such a character as he denies fixedness, permanence, and comparability, which are requisites in order to have fixed and temporarily fixed opponents, stages, and meanings of mutual destruction. In the case of our short story, the narrator seemed hardly identifiable, and the absence of reliable references for this figure presents unique opportunities for the researcher, in particular, authorial characterization and ability to follow the set techniques of development of a monological superior authority. At the same time, only stylistics and narrative prism and ability to change the rhetorical persuasiveness are observed in the internal content of the text with the initial temporal contrast. Nevertheless, the presence of substantial disagreement is evidenced also by the direct conflict-related content.\n\n4. Character Relationships\n\nThe theme of war cuts through the connections between the protagonists. In this aspect, it is worth reflecting on how, when a war symbolizes an extreme circumstance, it can even succeed in revealing a subtext of almost secret connections. In social families or spheres characterized by the lack of communication, war constitutes that link which reconciles and highlights the values that are able to spiritually reconnect persons, communities, and nationalities. Family, social nucleus, city, nation: in all these escalating worlds, human values and the underlying person resume meaning in a drama, albeit common, of a planet which up to then was crossed only by the negative values of corruption caused by time. Thus, by bringing out applicable, discernible moral reliefs most veritable of mankind's love, the story of war dialogues with Pirandello's work and, above all, with his constant need to give an ever new sense to the definition of drama. These fervent trials are reflected and are an integral part of the texts and plots of his literary work.\n\n4.1. Captain Blunt and Lieutenant D'Andrea\n\nBoth Captain Blunt and Lieutenant D'Andrea are related to the military service environment; therefore, the author does not have much freedom to describe the story, despite the fact that there are no references to specific physical appearances. As the officer in command of the barracks, it is plausible that Blunt is the person whom Polite would have to address before shooting the first wave of his revolver, a revolver that Acerbo borrowed (in fact, he asks for notice, but receives a negative response and consequently has to \"shoot as his patience decided\"). Consequently, nothing is mentioned about Blunt in the barracks table game being present in their conversation. Moreover, according to what is mentioned, it is concluded that it had already been anticipated and analyzed by the characters present, but their respective responses were not developed at any point in the story. The fact that the Lieutenant has taken Acerbo's revolver indicates anything but disapproval. He is portrayed as a very active and energetic person, who must have great pleasure in being surrounded by people. When the adjutant offers to help Polite, the lawyer qualifies the intervention as \"too easy advice, tongue, easy words – real, official words – of Emilio D´Andrea (as the author of War mentions) in the peaceful hours of barracks card game – Not even disdain at the meeting\". When he learns that Polite really intends to carry out his purpose regarding the injustice! That imposed assassin, the lieutenant as a soldier, professionally proposes that he be the intermediary, and sends his to the captain, also. The boy, on the other hand, frightened, flees \"from this anguished assembly\", as the reactions of the characters present were very intense and extremely facilely overreacted to the news. The young man asks: \"there are other serious people to whom you owe Comose\". The soldier replied that he had not spurned him at the meeting, but the boy ran away unable to even respond with his eventual availability.\n\n4.2. The Soldiers' Camaraderie\n\nThe soldiers' camaraderie. When we first meet the soldiers of the twenty-fourth battalion, they are insulting and tampering with the worthy chaplain who is the butt of their jokes. These are rough soldiers who are able to joke about God Himself. Intending to offend him, they treat the priest with familiarity, though they clearly have nothing against him personally. They seek his company and his advice, as we realize in the episode with Giacone. However, they make it evident that they are not afraid of him and have no awe or respect for the cassock. This is due to a lack of religious feeling. These soldiers have never been taught what religion means and are living with the morality inculcated in them by their mother and the religious instruction of the elementary school. They are almost all peasants who left the idyll of the fields to go to war; they have received only the august sacrament \"once in a poor way\" and they do not even know what a novena is. Their ideas are blond and they laugh at the commander's scarlet breeches. At ordinary times they are untidy and camped around their captain during the wake they behave there as if it were a tavern, doubtless out of friendship and camaraderie with Salvatore. The term describes their behavior exactly. There is no morality, nothing of the spirit of the race or of patriotism in their minds, embittered and exasperated from the useless slaughter of the trenches. In the captain they only see a man with whom they can be on familiar terms, a true comrade because he treats them as equals, making himself one of them. And they feel the attraction of spiritual ties that are the more attractive because they overlook totally the ties between fatherland, mother and family, family-style toasts that are heart-rending, dii and lares who wait for their return from battle, old companions whom they will see no more.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe characters in War follow their own predetermined lines, unaffected by the secret inner motives that might have animated a completely imagined character like that created by Pirandello. In other words, the neutral fact of being, as opposed to that other world of the \"I think, therefore I am,\" does not exist for them. It is for this reason that the reader never succeeds in becoming involved in their human drama, ever since he learns from right at the start, as if by a tragic mistake, that in the final scene, when the curtains come down on the play which each will be playing ad libitum every day as from that moment, they will each pay for battle with their own doves. Finally, a word of praise for Pirandello, the thoughtful poet who finally understood the tragic—and at the same time perhaps grotesque—incapacity of the human \"I\" in transcending the impersonality of life. In the faces of the men who had become those clay fighters, who never gave into the explosive, earth-shaking rattle of the death-giving steel elephants but were instead swept away each day to the hypnotic beat of their doves struggling, Pirandello sensed an omnipresent Platonic shadow, deluding their already spiritless beings with the image of a life similar to that of the imprisoned prisoners of the Republic, convinced that they are free by dint of a harmony made possible only by the power of chance, the most extraordinary and implacable of caprices of inanimate existence, before whom the human \"I\" who is born and dies through his own will can do no more than be resigned."
