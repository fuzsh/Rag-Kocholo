        "text": "A Biography of Luigi Pirandello\n\nLuigi Pirandello was born on the 28th of June 1867 in Agrigento, Sicily into an upper-class family. His family was heavily involved in the unification and democratization of Italy, which would later appear as a theme in some of Pirandello's poetry. Pirandello was homeschooled and was exposed to a variety of legends and fables told to him by a servant, which inspired him to write his first tragedy at the age of 12. When he was old enough, he attended a secondary school to study humanities despite his father's insistence he attends a technical school. Pirandello and his father had a strained relationship, and Pirandello was much closer to his mother.\n\nPirandello and his family moved to Palermo in 1880, which became a time of inspiration for Pirandello. There he began to read poems by Arturo Graf and Giosue Carducci and began writing poetry. Some of his poetry revealed the love he had for his cousin who the family encouraged him to marry—as long as he went into the sulfur business. This did not happen, but a visit to the sulfur mines inspired some of Pirandello's later work. In 1887, Pirandello went to the University of Palermo in the Department of Letters and later transferred to the University of Rome. While in Rome, Pirandello had the opportunity to begin visiting theaters.\n\nHis stay in Rome did not last long. After a dispute with his professor, Pirandello transferred to the University of Bonn. The city of Bonn turned out to be beneficial to Pirandello, who was exposed to German Romanticism and particularly the works of Goethe. He was also introduced to humorism.\n\nHumorism in literature refers to the art of humor for the purpose of making an audience laugh. In 1908, Pirandello wrote an essay titled L'umorismo (Humorism) (1908). In the essay, Pirandello examines his work and how humor is a product of overcompensating for insecurity. In this way, humor is not simply a means of entertainment but humor is also a way of analyzing the mask people wear that distorts their reality.\n\nPirandello graduated in 1891 with a degree in Romance Philology. Pirandello returned to Rome and became involved in a literary circle made up of journalists and writers, including Luigi Capuana. He encouraged Pirandello's writing and in 1893 Pirandello began writing Marta Ajala (1901) and published his first short story collection, Amori senza Amore in 1894.\n\nIn 1894, Pirandello married Maria Antonietta Portulano, and they had two children. His married life and artistic friends encouraged Pirandello to keep writing fervently. In 1895, due to his connections with journalists he was able to publish part 1 of Dialoghi tra Il Gran Me e Il Piccolo Me in La Tavola Rotonda. In 1897, Pirandello began teaching at the Istituto Superiore di Magistero di Roma and in 1898, he founded a weekly titled Ariel. In Ariel, he published a one-act play titled, L'Epilogo (later changed to La Morsa and performed in 1910). He also wrote many novellas including Lumie di Sicilia (1900) and poems, including a poetry collection titled Zampogna (1901). In 1902, he published his second novel, Il Turno (1902).\n\nIn 1903, Pirandello and Antonietta lost a substantial portion of their capital when the sulfur mines they invested in flooded over. Due to the financial collapse, Antonietta began to struggle with severe mental illnesses, and Pirandello had to look over her. All the while, he continued writing his next novel, but due to the familial turmoil, he released the novel as a series in a magazine called New Anthology. The novel is semi-autobiographical about Pirandello's current situation and is titled Il Fu Mattia Pascal (1904). Once the novel was translated into German, Pirandello's fame shot up, and he began to publish with more notable publishing houses.\n\nPirandello's fame kept growing with the publication of the novellas Mondo di Carta (1909), Non e una cosa Seria (1910), and Pensaci, Giacomino! (1910). In 1911, Pirandello finished his fourth novel titled, Suo Marito (republished 1941). Pirandello kept working tirelessly producing some of the most famous pieces of Italian literature between 1913 and 1914, including La Vendetta del Cane (1913) and Filo d'aria (1914). When World War I broke out, Pirandello continued to write numerous plays in the year 1917. These plays include Cosi e (se vi pare) (1917), Ma non e una cosa seria (1917), and Il Giuoco delle parti (1918).\n\nIn the 1920s, Pirandello kept writing plays some of which divided public opinion such as Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore (1921). After joining the National Fascist Party under the rule of Benito Mussolini, Pirandello was assigned as the owner and director of the Teatro d'Arte di Roma in 1925.\n\nPirandello sent Mussolini a personal letter in 1924 requesting membership into the National Fascist party. Despite being a loyal member of the National Fascist Party, Pirandello considered himself to be apolitical. He left the party in 1927 and was placed under secret surveillance by the National Fascist Party. Scholars have often analyzed Pirandello's desire to join the National Fascist Party and some have concluded it was an act of self-defense in a tumultuous time.\n\nIn 1926, Pirandello published his greatest and final novel, Uno, Nessuno e Centomila. In 1934, Pirandello was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Two years later, on December 10, 1936, Pirandello died, and his cremations were buried in Sicily.\n\nThe Writing Style of Luigi Pirandello\n\nThe writing style of Luigi Pirandello sets him apart as a unique writer from the early 20th century. His writing style went on to influence literary movements such as existentialism and absurdism. Pirandello's writing style is sometimes called \"Pirandellian\" and is based on the principle of blurring reality and a created reality. Pirandello does this by contrasting the spontaneous, ever-changing aspects of life with the unchanging nature of art. Therefore, in a majority of Pirandello's plays and novels, characters often have many identities that shift as an illusion until the mask is uncovered on the character. Pirandello also uses metatheatre to bring attention that the activities happening on stage belong to a play and that the characters are simply actors creating a new reality.\n\nAn example of how Pirandello blurs reality and reveals the unreliable nature of characters is by invalidating a truth with a newly discovered truth. For example, in Pirandello's play Cosi e (se vi pare), as the investigation of Mrs. Ponza plays out, each new piece of evidence found in the investigation invalidates a piece of evidence found prior. In this way, the reader is unsure of what the truth is. In addition, the reader sees the madness found in the play mirrored in the riddling plot of the play.\n\nThroughout the plays of Pirandello, there are instances in which characters are created by both the author (Pirandello) and the actor playing the character. In this way, the character devised by the author will sometimes be interpreted differently by the actor. This becomes a metaphor for the nature of human life. Human life is ever-changing and is never in a fixed state, just as the characters are ever-changing and are never in a fixed state. The best example of this comes from Pirandello's play Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore.\n\nQuotes by Luigi Pirandello\n\nThe works of Luigi Pirandello can be complex and confusing. Let's take a closer look at some quotes by Luigi Pirandello to better understand his work as an author.\n\nWe have this illusion of being one person for all, of having a personality that is unique in all our acts. But it isn't true. We perceive this when, tragically perhaps, in something we do, we are as it were, suspended, caught up in the air on a kind of hook.\"\n\n(Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore, Act I)\n\nIn this quote from the play Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore, a character known as the Father is contemplating his role as the one who brings about the tragic elements of the storyline being written within the play. He is an unfinished character being written by the Director in a play written by Pirandello, and he becomes self-aware momentarily that he will never have a fixed personality. However, after he is caught engaging in inappropriate behavior in the back of a shop, he is fixed into the role of a perverted man. However, this fixed role is only one perception of him that has been observed by another character and the audience.\n\nI dressed as a penitent, today; he, as prisoner tomorrow! But woe to him who doesn't know how to wear his mask, be he king or Pope ! --Perhaps he is a bit too cruel! No! Yes, yes, maybe!\"\n\n(Enrico IV, Act II)\n\nIn this quote from Enrico IV, the aristocrat who believes himself to be Henry IV is musing on the perception of people by others. He is touching on a concept found in many of Pirandello's plays. The concept is that characters, like humans, wear multiple masks that blur the line between the multiple versions of their characteristics and personality. Henry is stating that to appear in one singular truth, a person must know how to wear the mask they have chosen to present. In the play, Henry reveals he's been playing along the whole time and knows he isn't Henry IV, but his actions and speech sound odd. In this way, even the audience is unsure when a character is wearing a mask and shifting between truths.\n\n\"…because, if you were to do that, they would all tell you that you are completely wrong. But, you see, you are really right; because I am really what you take me to be; though, my dear madam, that does not prevent me from also being really what your husband, my sister, my niece, and Signora Cini take me to be—because they also are absolutely right!\"\n\n(Cosi e (se vi pare), Act I)\n\nIn this quote from Pirandello's play, Cosi e (se vi pare), the theme of reality and perception of reality is explored. The character Laudisi brings up the point that people can never be right about a person because some will have one perception of that person, such as Laudisi saying who he is; however. there will be others who have a different perception of that person, such as when Laudisi states that Sirelli's husband, sister, niece, and Signora Cini will have their version of the truth. This being the case, truth becomes a meaningless concept because there will never be a definite, absolute truth for everyone to agree on.\n\nLuigi Pirandello - Key takeaways\n\nLuigi Pirandello is a Sicilian-born, Italian playwright, novelist, and short story writer from the early 20th century.\n\nHis modernist plays are early examples of absurdism and metatheatre, and his most famous play is Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore.\n\nHe wrote numerous novels that are examples of modernist literature, and his most renowned novel is Uno, nessuno e centomila.\n\nHis writing style is sometimes called \"Pirandellian\" and is based on the principle of blurring reality and a created reality.\n\nLuigi Pirandello won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1934."
