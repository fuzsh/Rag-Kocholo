        "text": "Visiting the Museum of the great Italian writer\n\nPirandello House in Agrigento during the #italiagrandsketchingtour.\n\nOn my way back to town, I stopped in the native house of Luigi Pirandello, one of the great masters of Italian literature. The house is now a museum that collects and represents the life and the work of the writer that has always been for me a big influence.\n\nPirandello was born here in 1867 and he is particularly important for Italy because he revolutionized the theatre writing and produced very important and disputed works. In particular in ‘Six Characters Searching for an Author’ he created something new since the characters and the actors interchange their roles, bringing the literature in the real world and the real world on the stage. Pirandello was also recognized internationally and in fact in 1934 he won the Nobel Prize of Literature.\n\nPirandello works and life\n\nThe work of Pirandello that mostly influenced me is ‘One, Nobody and Hundred Thousand’ with the concept that we all wear masks to hide ourselves. Now I realize that this work talked to me because I tended to search approval in society through adapting myself to people that surrounded me. Finding my balance has been the path that I have been following in those years and every day more this is bringing me to a better knowledge of myself, to more strength and more joy, because I am more able to be aligned with myself and with my journey in this life.\n\nEven if Pirandello lived long part of is life in Rome and there he died, his tomb is here, near his house, in a secluded area in the middle of the trees, as he requested. This is what I have chosen to paint, as a sign of recognition of his importance for me and for arts. Also, I found interesting that the cinerary urn has been embedded in this stone and it became part of the earth with which the writer had a great connection.\n\nTitle of the painting ‘Pirandello House in Agrigento’\n\nThis is a painting from the Italia Grand Sketching Tour Collection, a series of original ink and watercolor paintings done on location during my tour to discovery the marvelous Italian heritage. All paintings are also available as numbered and originally signed prints.\n\nThe painting is also featured in the book about my motorbike Italian tour. By acquiring this work you will get to know better Italy also thanks to a personalized story about this place that I will include in the package.\n\nPainting information:\n\nWatercolor and ink on white paper\n\nSize 19 x 28.5 cm (7.5 x 11.2 inches)\n\nShipped in a box\n\nCertificate of authenticity will be sent with the painting\n\nWrite me!\n\nIt is available for sale. Please let me know which subject you are interested in."
