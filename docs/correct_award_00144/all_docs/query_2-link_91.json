By suggesting that going over the same old thing repeatedly could be labeled as living, Pirandello acknowledges the importance of routine and familiarity in our lives. However, he asserts that true living lies in the embrace of change, the exploration of different paths, and the appreciation of diverse scenery. To merely tread the same journey with no variation or inspiration, according to Pirandello, is to deprive oneself of the essence and beauty of life itself. Thus, he urges his audience to embrace the inherent curiosity within us and seek out novel experiences, for it is in these ventures that we truly live.",
