In this day and age the literary tourism is booming and that conductive to the nation’s revenius. This kind of writer is Luigi Pirandello.(Manola,2019)\n\nLuigi Pirandello1 had the opportunity to change his misfortune to achievement. His family infelicity made him to stay next to his mentally disturbed wife. By that incident he managed to have a different sight of life and the way who confront his daily life. Pirandello was so prolific and talented so most of Greeks are both involved and influenced by him. Nikos Kazantzakis and Matesis, two of the most talented writers, are affected by Pirandello and wrote some artworks based on his way of write. (Manola,2020a) His performances have a huge interenting both in Greece and Globally.(Manola,2020b) His philosophy is a timeless tourism product.

In this tomb there is a big pine tree which in its foothills is placed his burial vessel, in which he contained his ashes.After a natural disaster, the tree suffered from irreparable damage in 1997. (Manola,2019)But beyond the pine, its tomb consists of a stone designed by sculptor Marino Mazzacurati, which is said that it is moving!\n\nThe house where Pirandello lived , he was awarded the Nobel Prize and died it was the Casa di Pirandello.It is located at 13b Avia de Antonio Bosio in an apartment building at 1910.
