Luigi Pirandello

Author, Italian

Luigi Pirandello (1867–1936) was an Italian dramatist, novelist, poet, and short story writer whose greatest contributions were his plays. He was awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature for “his almost magical power to turn psychological analysis into good theatre.” Pirandello’s works include novels, hundreds of short stories, and about forty plays, some of which are written in Sicilian. Pirandello’s tragic farces are often seen as forerunners of the Theater of the Absurd. (Photo credit: image courtesy of Risparmio Libro)
