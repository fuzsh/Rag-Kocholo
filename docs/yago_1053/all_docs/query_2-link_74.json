        "text": "Dudley Moore, the multitalented British actor, comedian and musician noted for his performances in the 1960's stage revue ''Beyond the Fringe'' and the films ''10'' and ''Arthur,'' died yesterday at his home in Plainfield, N.J. He was 66.\n\nA spokeswoman for the actor said that the cause of death was pneumonia as a complication of progressive supranuclear palsy, a disease that attacks various neurological functions.\n\nA diminutive man, Mr. Moore was renowned for his affinity for tall women, usually blonde -- he was married and divorced four times -- and a versatility that carried him from the stage in the 1960's to Hollywood movies in the 70's and 80's and finally to the concert stage as a pianist in the early 90's. But the big career predicted for him after his movie successes evaporated in a string of bad roles, misconceived projects and stormy personal relations that in recent years often landed him front and center in the British tabloids.\n\nMr. Moore's climb to prominence began with ''Beyond the Fringe,'' a comic revue he created with three other young performers: Peter Cook, with whom Mr. Moore had a 15-year professional relationship; Alan Bennett, a fellow Oxford graduate of Mr. Moore's, and Jonathan Miller.\n\nA savagely hilarious lampoon of deadly serious public issues, the show had its origins at the Edinburgh Festival in 1960, moving on to London and then to Broadway, where it played from 1962 to 1964 and had a brief revival in 1965.\n\nWhen it opened in New York, the country was in the throes of the Cuban missile crisis, and audiences were nervous. Cook and company showed no mercy. ''Get out of the danger area,'' Mr. Cook warned. ''That's where the bomb drops.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
