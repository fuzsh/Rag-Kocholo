        "text": "He was married for 13 years to Tuesday Weld, who played the perpetually unattainable Thalia Menninger on the Dobie Gillis TV show (1959-60) and starred in some of SooToday.com's all-time favourite films including Sex Kittens go to College (1960) and Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977).\n\nIf being Tuesday's third husband (her second was Dudley Moore) doesn't make you want to rush out to see Pinchas Zukerman this weekend at the Kiwanis Community Theatre Centre, you need to know that he's achieved a smidgeon of secondary fame as one of the world's three greatest living violinists.\n\nAnd Zukerman (shown) likes to play with inflatable lobsters (also shown), which makes him perfect material for Chris Belsito's Five-Day Arts and Entertainment Forecast in SooToday.com's Arts section."
