When her father, Lathrop Motley Weld, died three years later at the age of 49, the cute little girl, whose name by then had somehow been transmogrified into \"Tuesday\", took over the role of the family breadwinner.

        "text": "She was director Roman Polanski's first choice for the leading role in Rosemaries Baby (1968) because he thought her pure American looks would contrast well with the film's dark undertones. The studio preferred Mia Farrow, however, who had become a star on the enormously popular nighttime soap opera Peyton Place (1964). A few years later Polanski wanted her to star in his film version of Roman Polanskis Macbeth (1971). She lost the part when she refused to do a nude sleepwalking scene. The role was eventually played by Francesca Annis.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter what drove her into seclusion after having such a public adolescence, she answered, \"I think it was a Buick\".\n\nOften estranged from her son, who was homeless as of 2005. He got his life together after receiving an inheritance from father Dudley Moore's estate on his 30th birthday.\n\nIn Tiny Tim's recording of George M. Cohan's song \"Then I'd be Satisfied with Life\" (on his 1968 album \"God Bless Tiny Tim\"), he changes the line \"If Hettie Green would only be my wife\" to \"If Tuesday Weld would only be my wife\".\n\nBegan smoking and drinking at age 10 and attempted suicide at 12 with an overdose of pills and gin after her love for a gay man didn't work out. She also claimed that she had her \"first real affair\" at 11. By 16 she'd totaled half a dozen cars and was dating men three times her age, most notably John Ireland which caused a scandal but did not lead to statutory rape charges.\n\nWas considered to play Mrs. Lovett in a film version of the musical \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\", but she passed on the role as time went on. When it was finally made in the 2000s, the role went to Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nAs of June 2010 she was living in the Aspen (CO) area and has turned down work for over ten years. Her major agents still send her scripts weekly, but she is writing and close to her daughter and granddaughter. She is offered \"mother roles\" on hit series, but looks better than her years.\n\nFourth cousin of ex-Gov. Bill Weld of Massachussetts and both their lineages precede the Founding Fathers. The Weld name is on buildings at Harvard in honor of her family establishing the University and is one of the most important family lineages in America.\n\nIn the mid-'80s she began telling people her mother was dead, even though she was still alive. Aileen Weld (a/k/a Yosene) didn't pass away until 2001.\n\nShe has Scottish ancestry on her mother's side of the family, and is distantly related to the inventor of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell.\n\nDonald Fagen mentions her in his song \"New Frontier\" on the album \"The Nightfly\": \"Introduce me to that big blonde/She's got a touch of Tuesday Weld.\".\n\nAttended professional children's school in New York with fellow child models and future actresses Sandra Dee and \"Carol Lynley. The three girls, along with another top New York child model at the time, Lorna Gilliam, frequently appeared in \"The American Girl\" magazine and even appeared together in an ad for Canada Dry ginger ale.\n\nWith the death of Dwayne Hickman on January 9th 2022, she along with Darryl Hickman, and Sheila Kuehl are the only living cast members of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959)."
