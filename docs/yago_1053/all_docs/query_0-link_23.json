        "text": "His two-year marriage to Brogan Lane, aspiring actress and 25 years younger than him, ended in 1990. Moore had already had several affairs with, among others, long-time lover Nicole Rothschild.\n\nNicole became Moore's fourth and last wife in 1994. She was almost 30 years his junior and at least four inches taller than her husband. They first met at the peak of his career when she flung herself across the bonnet of his car and demanded an autograph.\n\nSex, drugs and violent outbursts\n\nMoore and his fourth wife were addicted to each other but their relationship was peppered with violent outbursts. Just before their marriage, Nicole had Moore arrested for attempted murder after an Oscars night argument.\n\nHe spent a night in jail after which she dropped the charges - but not before sporting alleged choke marks on her neck to reporters outside their home.\n\nTheir bizarre lifestyle and often violent relationship was bread and butter to gossip columnists in the US and Britain.\n\nNicole's ex-husband, Charles Cleveland - an HIV-positive drug addict - lived with the couple and was even present at the birth of their son, Nicholas, in 1995.\n\nIn December 1996, the couple were pictured again at the balcony of their home, Nicole hugging and kissing a forlorn Dudley with scratch marks on his swollen face - reunited after another violent row.\n\nIn June 1997, Nicole sued her husband for millions, claiming he had terrorised her, forced her to take drugs and hired prostitutes to service his needs at their home.\n\nThe full extent of Dudley's extravagance - some might call naïve generosity - was revealed in documents produced by Nicole's lawyers, in April 1998.\n\nHe allegedly spent more than £34,000 on a separate house for Nicole not far from his mansion in Marina del Rey, as well as thousands more on gifts and cosmetic surgery for his wife, clothes for her friends, houses and holidays for her ex-husband and his family.\n\nAlimony demands\n\nAfter their divorce earlier this year, he was paying £3,000 a month in child support but Nicole wanted more.\n\nHis lawyers said he could not afford to increase the payments because his wife's allegations about him had ruined his career and the job offers had dried up.\n\nIn May, Moore was due to appear in a Santa Monica court over maintenance for his ex-wife and son, but he was too ill to attend.\n\nHe was suffering from a mysterious brain disorder and being cared for at the New York University Medical Center. Moore was no stranger to serious illness: one year earlier he had undergone open-heart surgery after a check-up showed he had a hole in the heart.\n\nBut friends of the actor said years of \"hard living\", bouts of depression and the strain of his last relationship had finally taken their toll. They said he had lost his will to live.\n\nAsked on a BBC TV chat show \"Esther\" what he would write for his own obituary, he had said: \"I hope that a few people liked me and loved me and I hope that I learned to recognise that, to really feel it.\""
