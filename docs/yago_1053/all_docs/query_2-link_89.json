        "text": "Tuesday Weld (born August 27 1943) is an American movie and television actress. She began her acting career as a child. She has acted in many television programs and movies.\n\nQuick Facts Born, Occupation ...\n\nClose\n\nWeld was born Susan Ker Weld in New York City. After her father died, her mother put her to work as a child model. Weld's first acting job was on television at age 12. She was in a movie the same year with a small role in the 1956 Alfred Hitchcock crime drama, The Wrong Man. The pressures of her career, however, resulted in a nervous breakdown at age nine, alcoholism by age 12, and a suicide attempt around the same time.[1]"
