        "text": "Tuesday Weld (born August 27 1943) is an American movie and television actress. She began her acting career as a child. She has acted in many television programs and movies.\n\nWeld was born Susan Ker Weld in New York City. After her father died, her mother put her to work as a child model. Weld's first acting job was on television at age 12. She was in a movie the same year with a small role in the 1956 Alfred Hitchcock crime drama, The Wrong Man. The pressures of her career, however, resulted in a nervous breakdown at age nine, alcoholism by age 12, and a suicide attempt around the same time.[1]\n\nWeld's mother did not like her teenage daughter's affairs with older men, such as actor John Ireland. In 1961, she had an off-screen romance with Elvis Presley, her costar in Wild in the Country.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[change | change source]\n\nWeld has been married three times.\n\nShe was married to screenwriter Claude Harz, from 1965 until their divorce in 1971. They had a daughter, Natasha, in 1966.[2]\n\nShe married British actor, musician, and comedian Dudley Moore in 1975. In 1976 they had a son, Patrick. He is now an actor, director, and editor. They divorced in 1980. In 1985 she married Israeli concert violinist and conductor Pinchas Zukerman. They divorced in 1998."
