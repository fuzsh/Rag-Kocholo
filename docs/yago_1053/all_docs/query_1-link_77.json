Her childhood, however, was anything but glamorous. Her dad died when she was three, and from the age of three she supported her family as a professional model. The enormous stress put upon her by professional and family demands precipitated her first nervous breakdown at the age of nine. By the next year, she was drinking heavily and, at 12, she first attempted suicide with aspirin, sleeping pills and gin. At 16 she began to break away from her mom, flaunting her drinking and affairs with older men.\n\nSeven years later, in 1966, she married for the first time, having a daughter in September 1972. After a divorce, she married actor Dudley Moore in 1975 for a very stormy relationship. Although their marriage was a rocky one, they had a son, Patrick, in 1977. Her marriage with Moore eventually ended and she married the violinish Pinchas Zuckerman on 18 October 1985. They divorced in 1998.\n\nOn 22 March 2005 her older brother Lothrop died; he was 82, many years her senior.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nlover relationship with Beymer, Richard (born 21 February 1939)\n\nlover relationship with Gere, Richard (born 31 August 1949).
