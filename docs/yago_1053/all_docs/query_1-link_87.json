        "text": "A diminutive man, Dudley Moore was renowned for his affinity for tall women, usually blond — he was married and divorced four times — and a versatility that carried him from the stage in the 1960s to Hollywood movies in the '70s and '80s and finally to the concert stage as a pianist in the early '90s.\n\nBut the big career predicted for Moore after his movie successes evaporated in a string of bad roles, misconceived projects and stormy personal relations that in recent years often landed him front and center in the British tabloids.\n\nThe multi-talented British actor, comedian and musician most famous for his performances in the 1960s stage revue \"Beyond the Fringe\" and the films \"10\" and \"Arthur,\" died Wednesday morning at his home in Plainfield, N.J. He was 66. A spokeswoman for Moore said he died of pneumonia as a complication of supranuclear palsy, a progressive disease that attacks various neurological functions.\n\nMoore's climb to prominence began with \"Beyond the Fringe,\" a comic revue he created with three other young performers: Peter Cook, with whom Moore had a 15-year professional relationship; Alan Bennett, a fellow Oxford graduate of Moore's; and Jonathan Miller.\n\nA savagely hilarious lampoon of deadly serious public issues, the show had its origins at the Edinburgh Festival in 1960, moving on to London and then to Broadway, where it played from 1962 to 1964 and had a brief revival in 1965.\n\nWhen it opened in New York, the country was in the throes of the Cuban missile crisis, and audiences were nervous. Cook and company showed no mercy. \"Get out of the danger area,\" Cook warned. \"That's where the bomb drops.\"\n\nMoore planted himself in the audience at the John Golden Theater and fired questions at his three co-players onstage. \"Please, panel,\" he asked, \"following the holocaust, when will public services be resumed?\" Cook responded that all was provided for but added that at first it may be only \"a skeleton service.\"\n\nWhile his colleagues concentrated on political commentary, Moore took to the keyboard for a wild rendition of \"Colonel Bogey's March,\" which rattled on thunderous chord after thunderous chord while he desperately tried to come up with an ending.\n\nAfter the show closed, Moore collaborated on various projects with Cook, who died in 1995. The pair performed as a two-man group and in the late 1960s made albums, a moderately successful BBC series called \"Not Only . . . but Also\" about two working-class fellows, and several films.\n\nBut there was friction. \"I always enjoy Peter on my own, but if I'm with somebody else, we always get into an argument,\" Moore told an interviewer. Cook, he added, would become irritated at Moore's nitpicking. Moore said he had trouble with what he called Cook's lack of directness with people.\n\nThroughout his career, Moore's fortes were clowning and a physical humor reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin. Years after he had become a star in \"10\" and \"Arthur,\" he felt that his brand of comedy annoyed his more erudite \"Beyond the Fringe\" colleagues.\n\n\"Peter says, 'I can't understand Dudley's success,' \" he said in an interview, \"and Jonathan says, 'I think he can do better.' I think they feel I'm a lightweight, doing lightweight material, having a lightweight life.\" Miller once described Moore as a \"grubby cherub.\"\n\nA combination of circumstances seemed always to put Moore on the defensive. He was born on April 19, 1935, in the East London suburb of Dagenham, the son of a railroad electrician and a secretary. Suffering from a club foot and small stature, his boyhood was marred by abuse from his peers.\n\n\"I think most comedians start off defending themselves with comedy,\" he once said. \"They feel inferior in some way. I certainly did feel inferior. Because of class. Because of strength. Because of height. If I'd been able to hit someone in the nose, I wouldn't have been a comic.\"\n\nMusic was always a consolation. As a youngster he studied the violin and played the organ at church weddings. After attending Oxford on a music scholarship, graduating in 1957, he developed into an accomplished jazz pianist and toured England and the United States.\n\nIn 1966, Moore made his first movie, \"The Wrong Box,\" about a family's riotous, no-holds-barred scramble for an inheritance. He was teamed with Cook in the film, which starred Michael Caine, John Mills, Ralph Richardson and featured Peter Sellers in a cameo.\n\nOver the next decade, Moore made several unremarkable films. In 1973, he returned to Broadway with Cook in a revue called \"Good Evening,\" which was a hit and won a special Tony Award.\n\nIn 1978, he co-starred with Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase in the film \"Foul Play,\" about a woman accused of murder in San Francisco. Moore drew attention as a swinger obsessed with sex.\n\nA good-looking man of 5 foot 2, he attracted women, most of whom towered over him. \"Whether women wanted to mother him or smother him, I don't know,\" Cook once said.\n\nA year after \"Foul Play,\" the director Blake Edwards made Moore a major movie star in \"10.\" On a ceaseless, feverish search for perfect-looking women, a composer named George (Moore) finds one in the person of a tall blonde named Jenny (Bo Derek). Like Moore himself, George feels inadequate, especially in Southern California, a land of magnificent physical specimens forever jogging. George is at his best when in physical or psychological peril. \"The movie belongs very much to Moore, who manages to be funny without ever having to appear stupid,\" Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times.\n\nIn 1981 came \"Arthur.\" Moore starred opposite Liza Minnelli and won a Golden Globe Award for his performance as a rich, lonely drunk who caroms around New York in a raucous manner somehow made tolerable by his openness and the fact that he eventually will be worth $750 million. Canby wrote in The Times that Moore was \"if possible, more uninhibitedly comic\" than he was in \"10,\" adding, \"His Arthur is a satyr, a sprite, an overage waif and a consistently endearing showoff. . . . His timing is magical.\"\n\nIt was the high point of Moore's film career, which deteriorated into a succession of bad movies. In 1988, for example, came \"Arthur 2: On the Rocks,\" with Moore as a not-so-lovable drunk the second time around. \"Arthur has become a clamorous bore,\" Canby wrote.\n\nThe one bright spot was another Blake Edwards comedy, \"Micki and Maude\" (1984), in which Moore played a television newsman who impregnates both his wife and his mistress. Again he won a Golden Globe.\n\nOver the years, Moore's love life became something of a legend, even by Hollywood standards. A four-year marriage to the actress Suzy Kendall ended in 1972. In 1975 he married the actress Tuesday Weld. They had a son, Patrick, and were divorced in 1980. For several years, Moore's companion was Susan Anton, who was 9 inches taller than he. In 1988, he married the model Brogan Lane. They were divorced in 1991.\n\nMoore's fourth marriage was in 1994 to Nicole Rothschild, who was 29 years his junior. The couple had a son, Nicholas, but it was an explosive union. The year before they married, Moore was charged with \"cohabitational abuse.\" He and Rothschild separated, were reunited but parted again in 1997, with Rothschild suing Moore for domestic violence.\n\nAs his movie career gradually dried up in the early 1990s, Moore tried television. Because he was still a big name, producers were eager to back him, but two series, \"Dudley\" in 1993 and \"Daddy's Girls\" in 1994, were failures.\n\nBy then, though, he had turned to the concert stage. This time, the music was classical. In 1982, he had performed Bach and Mozart at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. \"All in all, he fought the concert stage to a draw,\" one critic wrote.\n\n\"It's sort of like there are two women in my life, music and acting,\" he said in an interview in Newsday. \"I always want to do music when I'm acting, and I want to act when I'm doing music.\"\n\nIn 1991, having performed at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl, Moore collaborated with the conductor Sir Georg Solti on \"Orchestra!,\" a series for Channel 4 in Britain. The demanding Hungarian-born Solti, who died in 1997, and the small comic actor made a memorable pair.\n\nMoore is survived by his sons, Patrick and Nicholas, and his sister, Barbara Stevens."
