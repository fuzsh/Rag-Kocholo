Brittany Howard has signed to Island Records, as she’s announced today. She has new music on the way, too, but has not yet shared details about its release. Along with the update, Howard has announced a handful of tour dates with L’Rain. See those below.

After two LPs with the roots-rock outfit Alabama Shakes, Howard released her debut solo album, Jaime, in 2019. The album picked up Grammy nominations for Best Rock Performance, Best R&B Performance, Best American Roots Performance, and Best Alternative Music Album, with “Stay High” winning the trophy for Best Rock Song. Howard followed it with Jaime Reimagined, which featured contributions from Childish Gambino, Bon Iver, BadBadNotGood, and more.

Between her own records, Howard joined Herbie Hancock to celebrate Joni Mitchell’s Kennedy Center Honors with a take on “Both Sides Now.” She also covered Earth, Wind & Fire’s “Shining Star” for the Jack Antonoff–produced Minions movie soundtrack. More recently, she joined violinist Rob Moose on the song “I Bend But Never Break” for his first solo EP.
