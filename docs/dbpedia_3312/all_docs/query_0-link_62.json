        "text": "LA-based alt-R&B trailblazer FREX returns with her latest single ‘Postcards’, released via Island Records. Textured, intimate and self-reflective; ‘Postcards’ is a delicate diary entry that sees her reminiscing over a fading relationship while deciding whether to move on and give up hope on it ever getting better.\n\nSpeaking on the single, frex said: “I wanted to keep being vulnerable during my process. Before you decide to move on, you’re deciding whether or not to give up all hope. Even though it’s a bad situation, you’re reminiscing.”\n\nKnown for her unique melodies and candid storytelling, frex is an artist to watch that is carving her own path and putting human connection at the forefront of her genre-blending artistry. Pulling inspiration from R&B, pop, jazz, classic rock, and more, frex uses her music to process her feelings and experiences, and push boundaries with the hope that her artistry helps others embrace their own vulnerability and overcome what they’re going through. Raised in a small town in Pennsylvania and now residing in LA, the rising talent is ready to bring her sound to a global stage.\n\nThe new single arrives on the heels of ‘Hoodie Back,’ an unbothered vibe that flips the script on the classic story of someone keeping a memento following the end of a relationship. Speaking to frex’s unique perspective on love and allowing yourself to be broken-hearted but not a victim with lyrics that cut deep, ‘Hoodie Back’ received acclaim from Billboard (calling her their “freshest find”), UPROXX, and more. The song followed frex’s breakthrough, viral hit ‘Oxford Circus’ – which debuted in the Spotify Viral 50 upon release and has racked up over 17 million streams on Spotify alone – and recent single ‘Forever Thing,’ a dreamy, breathy confession whose synths murmur through a glitchy beat which heralded her new chapter.\n\nfrex is fresh from supporting Alina Baraz on her US tour this Autumn and made her UK live debut this summer performing at All Points East Festival and a headline show at London’s ‘Folklore’, with support from the likes of Spotify, Billboard, Wordplay Magazine and more – stay tuned for more from this bubbling talent. but for now, listen to ‘Postcards’…\n\nFollowing a string of sold-out headline shows earlier this year and the launch of his ‘More of HER’ playlist which featured tracks such as ‘Hi Grade’ ft Protoje, ‘Road Closed’, ‘Crud’ and ‘No Days Off’, the dynamic UK R&B singer ANGEL continues his unstoppable ascent with the release of his new single ‘Take You Home’, the first track to be taken from his forthcoming album ‘WOMAN’.\n\nPaying homage to iconic 90s R&B and hip-hop jams including Foxy Brown ft Blackstreet – ‘Get Me Home’ and SWV’s ‘I’m So Into You’, ANGEL once again drops his signature mix of addictive throwback influences combined with his distinctive, soulful vocals and unparalleled songwriting and production talents on the new track – the perfect introduction to his highly anticipated full length project which is expected next year.\n\nLast year ANGEL released the massively popular ‘HER’ EP which has amassed over 3 million combined streams and featured the Harmony Samuels produced ‘Fvxk With You’ that saw west London meeting America’s ‘dirty south’, delivered courtesy of an explosive 16 bars from Atlanta, Georgia’s Rich Homie Quan and made a huge splash across both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nSigned in the US by Motown records VP, Ezekiel Lewis (also responsible for forming the group The Clutch who have gone on to write and produce hits for Beyonce, Justin Bieber, Neyo and more), alongside Island Records, ANGEL continues to reinforce his position as one of the UK’s hottest R&B talents…. so it goes without saying that the new album is going to rock both sides of the shore, making 2018 and beyond his for the taking….\n\nII DIMENSIONZ stolen today’s hotspot with debut single ‘Closer’ taken from their upcoming debut EP ‘Love From Above’ out this month.\n\nFeaturing special guest vocals from Mark Asari and rapper Nick Brewer (Island Records) ‘Closer’ is a smooth slice of soulful R&B with plenty of old school vibes including a big nod to Rosie Gaines classic ‘Closer than Close’.\n\nWhilst inviting special guests in for vocals all song writing, instrumentation and production is done by the boys themselves, and they’re keen to keep control of all aspects of creativity, something they’ve learned from their dads – who were both in the music business.\n\nII DIMENSIONZ are cousins Nathan and Jermaine Williams, born and raised in East London. Their dads played with the likes of Luther Vandross, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Chaka Khan and LL Cool, so the boys were brought up with music in their blood. “We were taken to watch band rehearsals and gigs and sharing the excitement of watching our fathers perform live was a huge inspiration. It laid the foundations to our own musical journey.”\n\nDebut 4-track EP ‘Love From Above’ is described by the duo as a modern-day take on classic 80’s soul with 90’s R&B. Alongside the single, ‘Closer’ the EP also includes the tracks ‘Waiting Room,’ ‘Coming Together’ and a deep house edit of ‘Closer.’\n\nCheck out the live performance of the single.\n\nAfter riding high on previous single ‘Hi Grade’, which has been streamed over 300,000 times, ANGEL continues his unstoppable ascent with the release of track ‘Road Closed’, taken from his EP ‘Her’.\n\nThe addictively slick R&B number is expected to continue the success previous releases: ‘Hi Grade’ was described as ‘groovy reggae meets R&B hit’ by The Fader. Harmony Samuels produced ‘Fvxk With You’, which featured Georgia spitter Rich Homie Quan, made a huge splash across both sides of the Atlantic. ‘Her’ EP has been streamed over 2.5 million times globally.\n\nHis recent hype stems from 2016 which saw ANGEL collaborating with rising UK rapper Stefflon Don on the sultry throwback sounds of ‘Hop On’ and Haile from WSTRN on the powerful ‘Rude Boy’, which along with the remix – where he joined forces with JME (Boy Better Know), Wretch 32 and Tally – collectively amassed over 2 million combined streams and garnered support from Radio 1Xtra and Rinse FM.\n\nSigned in the US by Motown records VP, Ezekiel Lewis (also responsible for forming the group The Clutch who have gone on to write and produce hits for Beyonce, Justin Bieber, Neyo and more), alongside Island Records, ANGEL continues to reinforce his position as one of the UK’s hottest R&B talents. With Kehlani, Mila J, Pop and Oak (known for their work with the likes of Chris Brown, Kehlani and Nicki Minaj), Grammy award-winning producer Swiss Beatz, Neff U and Prince Charlez (who recently collaborated with Rihanna on ‘Anti’) on the list as just some of the credible names, ANGEL has recently worked with and more new music and live shows coming, there is no doubt that Angel’s debut album is going to rock both sides of the shores, making 2017 and beyond his for the taking…have a listen to this incredible talent-on-the-rise.\n\nHot on the heels of a hugely successful 2016, which saw him bring his mesmerizing vocals and must-see stage performance to sold-out headline shows at London’s Bush Hall over two nights and a date at Birmingham Academy 3 plus gigs at Wireless and V Festivals and the release of his ‘HER’ EP, which has been streamed over 2 million times globally, the dynamic UK R&B singer-songwriter ANGEL is back with his brand new track ‘Hi Grade’, the first release from his forthcoming project (out this spring on Island Records).\n\nWritten and produced by the newcomer and a nod to his own musical upbringing, having a father who played around the world with legendary reggae artists such as Bob Marley, Misty in Roots, Dennis Brown and his own band Zabandis, ‘Hi Grade’ mixes reggae and R&B vibes with Angel’s stellar vocals to create a stunning, fresh sound that fans old and new will find impossible to get out of their heads or off their stereos.\n\nThe track follows the massively popular ‘HER’ EP which featured the Harmony Samuels produced ‘Fvxk With You’ that saw west London meeting America’s ‘dirty south’, delivered courtesy of an explosive 16 bars from Atlanta, Georgia’s Rich Homie Quan and made a huge splash across both sides of the Atlantic. The forthcoming project will see Angel building on the waves he created last year, whilst continuing to showcase his incredible songwriting ability and flair for hypnotic hooks and earworm melodies.\n\nSo here’s your chance to get some insight into the upcoming project; listen to ‘Hi-Grade.’"
