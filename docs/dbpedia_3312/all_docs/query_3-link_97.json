        "text": "Revue are vocalist Emma Loudon & multi- instrumentalist Martin Price, ably assisted by Sean McCann on bass, Ioannis Tsioulakis on keys and Josh McCullough on drums. The sound is inspired as much by folk, roots, jazz and blues as it is updated sounds of ethereal indie pop, modern grooves and alternative rock.\n\nThe Arts Council (NI) had confidence in their material and funded a full live band and recording sessions for their debut album “Why Can’t You Stay” in 2022. The song-writing was as heavily inspired by the natural world as it was by themes of loss. Loss comes to us all in life but sadly Emma lost both her brother and her father in the space of a year. Comfort was found in local forests and beaches, where the pair walked their two dogs and so these inspiring natural locations found their way into the material for the album. As did a sense of joy and appreciation of being together with those we love and of strength and growth in the face of adversity.\n\n2023 saw a third successful tour of Brittany, a second stint at the How The Light Gets In festival (the world’s largest festival of philosophy and music), other festival dates and shows in UK & Ireland, and lots of time spent both in their cosy home studio and the wild beauty of forests, coasts and cliffs that continue to inspire them and their music.\n\n‘Downhill’ is the second release from Revue’s debut album ‘Why can’t you stay’. In a fusion of indie folk and indie rock, this powerful track captures the essence of a moment forever linked with a place. The song weaves a tale set on Downhill beach on the mesmerizing North Coast of Ireland, serving as both a backdrop and a metaphor. The lyrics reflect the experience of associating a location with a life-altering event and the emotional freeze frame that can create. It begins gently, reminiscent of folk traditions, and gradually morphs into an indie rock anthem, mirroring the intensity of the emotions it portrays. The track again makes stirring use of layered backing vocals, which is becoming a trademark of Revue’s sound.\n\nDownhill strand – with Mussenden Temple perched on its rugged cliffs – provides a dramatic backdrop for the song’s story. Well-known in Ireland, it became famous internationally after being featured in an episode of Game of Thrones.\n\n‘Heartfelt vocals and evocative instrumental textures beckon listeners into a world where vulnerability battles against self-preservation, showcasing the band’s ability to blend profound themes with hypnotic melodies.’\n\n– The Beat\n\n‘Evocative instrumentals and passionate vocals intertwine with the group’s intricate storytelling, creating a sound that is as haunting as it is captivating.’\n\n– Hot Press\n\nRevue on Social Media:\n\nRevue (@wearerevue) • Instagram photos and videos\n\nFacebook\n\nrevue band (@band_revue) / X (twitter.com)"
