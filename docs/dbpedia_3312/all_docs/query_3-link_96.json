        "text": "Artists aren’t obligated to do much. Let’s get that out of the way. Like, if you buy a ticket to a concert, they’re obligated to perform. If you pay for an album, they’re obligated to make sure you get it. But that’s about where it ends. If an artist wants to take their sweet time in getting a new album together (like Lorde) or inexplicably retire after one album (looking at you, Postal Service), then that’s their right.\n\nThat said, come on, people. We are all literally starving out here. And while the first half of 2024 has been a great year for new music, with terrific offerings from the likes of MGMT, Real Estate, Bleachers, Kacey Musgraves, Taylor Swift, Beyonce and so on, we’re still hungry. And the only thing that can satiate our mighty need is some long, long, long-awaited new music from a few artists who are overdue for a new album.\n\nNeon Trees\n\nNeon Trees burst onto the scene with infectious energy and catchy hooks with hits like “Animal” and “Everybody Talks.” However, since the release of their last album, I Can Feel You Forgetting Me, in 2020, fans have been left craving more. The band has been busy touring over the last few years, and they’ve announced a single is on its way later this summer, but no word of an accompanying album yet. Hopefully, this will end the years-long hiatus.\n\nSky Ferreira\n\nSky Ferreira’s Night Time, My Time released in 2013, promptly set the world on fire and has more or less left it there, with Ferreira getting involved in a vast array of other projects (collabing with Charli XCX, acting in Baby Driver) and constantly teasing a follow-up. The new album even has a name, Masochism. A single dropped in 2019 and the full thing is rumored to land sometime “soon”, but we’ll believe it when we see it. And we’ll be grateful too.\n\nThe xx\n\nFew bands have cast a longer shadow over the last decade of pop music than The xx, even if they never reached quite the same household name recognition as many of the acts indebted to their influence. Rihanna, Drake and Lorde have all cited them as inspiration, and they’ve written for pop stars like Halsey and Dua Lipa. But where are The xx now?\n\nWorking hard, according to them, and prepping some new music. There’s no whisper of a release date or anything, but word is it’ll be a bit more colorful than the sparse, monochromatic sounds that put them on the map. Can’t wait.\n\nFrank Ocean\n\nNobody on this list does things on their own time or in their own way like Frank. channel ORANGE changed the game in 2012 in a way few albums have, drawing a bright line in the sand that makes it easy to tell now whether the pop song you’re listening to came before or after Frank Ocean made his presence known. He followed it up with Blonde in 2016, which had nearly as big of an impact — but slower, more like a creeping vine than a firecracker. He’s been releasing regular singles ever since and they’ve all been good, but we’re ready for another collection.\n\nHillsong UNITED"
