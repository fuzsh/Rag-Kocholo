        "text": "Sam Smith is gearing up to celebrate the tin anniversary of their debut studio album with In the Lonely Hour 10 Year Anniversary Edition. The collection due out on Capitol Records on August 2 will include the original’s 10 songs, as well as the exclusive new track, “Little Sailor.”\n\nA collector’s edition of the refreshed LP will feature 25 songs on four LPs and two CDs, including live versions of the some of album’s original songs and special features with Mary J. Blige, A$AP Rocky and John Legend.\n\nThe six-times-platinum original album that was originally released on June 17, 2014 — and which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart — featured Smith’s breakthrough Billboard Hot 100 No. 2 hit “Stay With Me,” as well as the No. 5 hit “I’m Not the Only One” and Lay Me Down” (No. 8) and fan favorites “Money On My Mind” and “Like I Can.” The collection garnered six Grammy nominations, including bids in the “big four” categories, with Smith snagging gold for best new artist, best pop vocal album, song of the year (“Stay With Me”) and record of the year (for the Darkchild remix of “Stay With Me”).\n\n“This year marks a decade since the release of my debut album. I feel so incredibly lucky to be celebrating this milestone with you,” Smith wrote on X. “My team and I have created this beautiful anniversary edition for us all, and for the last 10 years. Today is only the beginning ‘Sailors,’ we have so much to celebrate with you between now and August. I can’t wait to look back on In The Lonely Hour together.”\n\nSmith debuts their first podcast, The Pink House, today (June 13), with each episode promising a sit-down between the singer and friends/queer icons sharing how they “all found their own places in the world and share stories of belonging, chosen families, and the journeys we take to become who we’re destined to be,” according to a statement. The Lemonada Media-produced show named after Smith’s childhood home in Great Chisill, England will feature guest appearances from Elliott Page, Joel Kim Booster, Ben Platt, Gloria Estefan and others, who will explore their own Pink Houses on the pod, explaining how they “navigated early struggles and ultimately found their place in the world.”\n\nThe first two episodes are available now, with a new ep dropping every week.\n\nSee Smith’s announcement and the full track list below.\n\nIn the Lonely Hour 10 Year Anniversary Edition Collector’s Edition Tracklist:\n\nVinyl 1\n\nSide A\n\n1. “Good Thing”\n\n2. “Stay With Me” (Re-record)\n\n3. “Leave Your Lover”\n\nSide B\n\n4. “I’m Not The Only One”\n\n5. “I’ve Told You Now”\n\n6. “Like I Can”\n\n7. “Not In That Way”\n\nVinyl 2\n\nSide A\n\n1. “Make It To Me”\n\n2. “Lay Me Down”\n\n3. “Little Sailor”\n\nSide B\n\n4. “Money On My Mind”\n\n5. “Life Support”\n\n6. “Restart”\n\nVinyl 3\n\nSide A\n\n1. “Safe With Me”\n\n2. “Nirvana”\n\n3. “I’ve Told You Now” (Live at St Pancras Old Church, London)\n\nSide B\n\n1. “Latch”\n\n2. “La La La”\n\n3. “How Will I Know”"
