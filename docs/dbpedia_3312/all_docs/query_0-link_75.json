        "text": "Robert Palmer’s nine albums for Island Records have been newly remastered and collected in a forthcoming deluxe set called The Island Records Years 1974-1985.\n\nPalmer’s back catalogue has been criminally under exploited over the years, with rumours of ‘complications’ with his estate causing licensing roadblocks for third parties and even rights’ holders unwilling to commit to anything significant. Indeed, boutique label Hidden Masters, who did such great work with Jess Roden and Chris Wood’s back catalogue a few years ago, were forced to cancel a full scale retrospective at the request of Robert Palmer’s estate when they were 18 months into the project! Apart from a Collected greatest hits and a cheapo Classic Albums Series package, it has been very quiet.\n\nThis changes in February next year with this new deluxe set from Edsel. The same label came in for some criticism a decade ago when they first tackled Robert Palmer’s Island output via a series of CDs that combined albums. Fans were not happy with what sounded and looked like MP3s and while that was never really properly resolved, SDE did its own investigation.\n\nWe should stress here that this new package features brand new remasters by Phil Kinrade at AIR Mastering “using digital sources provided by the Universal archive” so no one is expecting a repeat of what came before.\n\nThroughout his long and varied career with Island, Palmer worked with an incredible array of musicians and producers. His 1974 debut album of blue-eyed and New Orleans soul, Sneakin’ Sally Through the Alley, featured The Meters, Art Neville, Steve Winwood and Little Feat’s Lowell George (whose ‘Sailin’ Shoes’ he covered), amongst other stellar musicians.\n\nLittle Feat were the backing band on many of the songs on Palmer’s second album, Pressure Drop, and 1976’s follow up Some People Can Do What They Like was self-produced by Palmer and featured Chuck Rainey on bass. Double Fun was a joint production with remix producer Tom Moulton and features ‘Every Kinda People’ which was written by former Free bassist Andy Fraser and became Palmer’s first hit record, reaching number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nHis next album, Secrets reached number 19 in America, whilst the single ‘Bad Case of Loving You (Doctor, Doctor)’ reached #14. 1980’s Clues introduced a rockier, more new wave sound and features one of Palmer’s best songs, ‘Johnny and Mary’, a song used by Renault in its long-running TV advertising which must have helped Palmer pay a few bills!\n\n1983’s Pride was heralded for its brilliant blending of mainstream pop with black music rhythms and elements of American funk and Robert hit the mainstream big time with 1985’s hugely successful Riptide which spawned the US-chart-topper ‘Addicted To Love’ and the Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis-penned transatlantic top ten hit ‘I Didn’t Mean To Turn You On’. The album was produced by Chic’s Bernard Edwards.\n\nPalmer left Island and signed with EMI shortly after this, but he never again repeated the commercial success of Riptide. Heavy Nova from 1988 came closest with its ‘Addicted to Love’ soundalike ‘Simply Irresistible’ nearly getting to the top of the US singles chart (it peaked at #2).\n\nThe new 9CD deluxe set contains all the Island albums, including Maybe It’s Live which features live tracks and some studio numbers. Some of the albums contain bonus tracks although closer inspection reveals that these are identical to the bonus tracks from the Edsel CDs issued in 2013.\n\nSo nothing new, as such, but with upgraded mastering and much better presentation this should be a tempting package for the reissue-starved Robert Palmer fan.\n\nThe Island Records Years 1974-1985 will be released on 17 February 2023, via Edsel."
