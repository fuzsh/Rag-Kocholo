        "text": "History highlight:\n\nToday in 1994, Weezer released their self-titled debut (aka The Blue Album). The album produced three singles: \"Undone - The Sweater Song,\" \"Buddy Holly\" and \"Say It Ain't So,\" which brought Weezer mainstream success. The album debuted at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 and became certified triple-platinum, selling over 3 million copies in the U.S. Fun fact: While prepping for the studio sessions for this album, the band focused on their vocal interplay by practicing barbershop quartet-styled songs, which helped both Cuomo and Sharp achieve a newfound collaborative comfort during rehearsals.\n\nAlso, today in:\n\n1964 - Bob Dylan arrived in the U.K. for his first major U.K. tour, which kicked off at London's Royal Albert Hall on May 17.\n\n1969 - The Moody Blues topped the U.K. album chart for the first time with “On the Threshold of a Dream,” which spent two weeks on top.\n\n1969 - The Turtles gave a special performance at the White House as guests of Tricia Nixon.

Among the first to be honored were James Brown, Michael Jackson, Smokey Robinson and Ella Fitzgerald.\n\n2018 - Scottish singer, songwriter, guitarist Scott Hutchison from Frightened Rabbit was found dead near South Queensferry, Scotland.\n\n2019 - The #FreeBritney movement gained traction as supporters gathered outside the Los Angeles courthouse where Britney Spears spoke to a judge about her conservatorship.
