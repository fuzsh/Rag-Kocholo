        "text": "24-year-old American rapper Flo Milli launched her career in the late 2010s with infectious tracks like \"In The Party\" and \"Beef FloMix,\" which catapulted her to mainstream fame through their viral success on TikTok. With her signature yet fiercely charismatic flow, Flo Milli's music consistently explores themes of empowerment, self-confidence and femininity.\n\nFlo MIli's Ho saga started four years ago with her mixtape \"Ho, Why Is You Here?\" and its standout single \"Like That Bitch.\" It's when the Alabama-born rapper boldly proclaimed to her competition,\" even if I broke my leg and used a crutch, I walk around like that bitch.\" Two years later, her new single \"Conceited\" was streamed over 75 million times on Spotify and established her “Hottie” sound firmly in the mainstream, and while becoming rap’s new favorite artist, she’s also paid homage to her influences along the way.\n\nAfter releasing sophomore album \"Fine Ho, Stay\" on March 15, it's become more apparent than ever that we, the audience, are the hoes that just cannot leave Flo Milli alone. Featuring a collaboration with SZA and Cardi B, the album truly feels like a victory lap after four years of surviving a competitive female MC field — and, let's be real, a pandemic.\n\nPremiering the song at the SXSW Rolling Stone's Future Of Music showcase earlier this month, hundreds of cellphones illuminated the stage while the young MC worked through her set. After years of hard work, it's gratifying to see Flo Milli receive the recognition she deserves. She has set herself up as rap's most fitting modern heir to the dynasty created by Nicki Minaj in the 2010s — and established by legends like Lil Kim in the decades prior.\n\nAs an album, a few additional standouts alongside the \"Never Lose Me\" remix include \"Not Sorry,\" a perfect burner of a track for anyone who's worn out from the breakup season that is spring, and \"Edible,\" which makes for a perfect addition to your cool-down gym playlist. However, the stand out on the album is \"Can't Stay Mad,\" which, as the title suggests, serves as a great rebound song for bouncing back from that failed cuffing season romance.\n\nLike her Gen Z following, Flo Milli is complex; in this album, she reveals her sensitivities while still exuding the fierce and confident persona her fans know and love. In many ways, this album encourages acceptance of the poor decisions we make in the name of love, and celebrates the empowerment that comes from later learning to uphold your standards. When it comes to music, Flo Milli has certainly raised her own standards through the album's pivot to intimate lyrics and flows."
