        "text": "Brittany Howard, the Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter and guitarist who rose to fame as a part of Alabama Shakes and as a soloist, has signed with Island Records. The move was announced today by Justin Eshak, Co-CEO of Island Records.\n\nHoward has also announced new music coming ahead of select headline dates that start Nov. 6 which will include stops at the iconic Ryman Auditorium in Nashville and the Corona Capital Festival in Mexico City.\n\nHoward’s last solo album was released in September 2019, “Jaime,” which included hit singles “Stay High” and “History Repeats.” The latter subsequently received Grammy Award nominations for best rock song and best rock performance. “Jaime” was named for and dedicated to her sister who died of retinoblastoma as a teen and explored Howard’s personal history and beliefs on subjects such as prejudices, poverty, and struggles with religious faith.\n\n“I cannot wait for the world to hear my new music and to start touring again,” said Howard. Eshak added, “I’m a huge admirer of Brittany. She’s already solidified herself as one of the great talents of her generation and is just getting started. Her artistry fits perfectly with Island’s unique legacy, and I’m delighted we get to play a role in her career moving forward.”\n\nSince her launch to fame with the Alabama Shakes in 2012, Howard’s successful run as a solo artist has won her a total of five Grammys, and she has sixteen nominations under her belt.\n\nHoward most recently played at the Evolution Festival at Forest Park in St. Louis; Wonderbus in Columbus, OH; and Bumbershoot in Seattle, WA and will deliver her next performance at Bourbon and Beyond on Sept. 15 in Louisville, KY before she kicks off her headlining tour on Nov. 6 with support from L’Rain through all U.S dates."
