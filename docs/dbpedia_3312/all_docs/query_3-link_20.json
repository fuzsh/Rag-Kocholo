The Watcher\n\nChicago prog rockers District 97 have announced that they will release their brand new studio album Stay For The Ending through Spirit Of Unicorn Records on October 20.\r\n\r\nThe album is the follow-up to 2019&#39;s Screens and has been recorded, mixed and mastered by Noam Wallenberg, who has worked with Alan Parsons. You can watch a video trailer for the new album below.\r\n\r\n&quot;After 15 years of leading District 97 I&#39;m thrilled that we continue to push ourselves to new heights in every realm of music making,&quot; says drummer Jonathan Schang of the new album. &quot;This is the strongest collection of sings we&#39;ve ever assembled.&quot;\r\n\r\n“This record presents us at our most collaborative and dynamic.,&quot; adds singer Leslie Hunt. &quot;We tried some new things and chased different aesthetics than we have in the past and I think the result is our best sounding album to date with some of our strongest compositions.&quot;\r\n\r\nStay For The Ending has also impressed prog royalty, with former Yes and King Crimson drummer Bill Bruford stating, &quot;Quality, expertise and passion - Stay For The Ending is a massive piece, of which District 97 should feel justly proud.&quot;",

STAY… ‘CAUSE… I’ve got a spoiler for ya STAY… FOR… THE… END… ING\n\n2.\n\nMirror 08:28\n\nMirror (Seisser/Hunt) Turn to me, open to see What once was will always be Visions changing your insight Refracted back in the light The mirror’s in control Streaming you your picture show Reflecting truth you see The inner workings laid to be Blinded by this familiar light You take up arms and fight the sight Of your exposure vanity The mirror will have its way, you’ll see Turn to see, open to me What is now can always be Bathing your visions in light Retracting your last insight The mirror’s in control Streaming you your picture show Reflecting truth you see The inner workings laid to be Blinded by this familiar light You take up arms and fight the sight Of your exposure vanity The mirror will have its way, you’ll see Gaze in me, unlock your mind When we’re intertwined It’s hard to separate us from What the mirror made us Blur your eyes, remove the lines Those are yours and these are mine For just a minute ‘cause None of this is infinite The mirror always shows The one who’s really in control\n\n3.\n\nMany New Things 05:29\n\nMany New Things (Tashjian) I have changes to enact when I come back With flames and everything packed, fully detached - sorrys in sacks. I’ll take offers for a pound… the best that I’ve found… and I’ve looked around. Life changes in a snap. problems unpack, worries intact I’m learning many new things That I’m really dying to show you Everything we tell ourselves Of the world around us Too similar to ignore Simple kind so you won’t put up a fuss With so much to tell I’ll never have enough courage to tell you Everything you ever loved... Has it really loved you? Everywhere you put your trust... Have you made it safer or more valued? It’s too much to ask I could never ask you Such a tale to tell No courage to turn to With so much to ask I could never ask you With a tale to tell I’ll never have enough courage to turn to I’ve learned so many new things That I’m really dying to show you\n\n4.\n\nCrossover 05:22\n\nCrossover (Schang/Hunt) One step at a time ’til it’s a new design … in the sand, a line don’t crossover to my side One line at a time If you deserve it, fine I’ll make your reasons rhyme But that don’t mean they’re mine One step over the line It happens all the time … with a changing mind you’ll crossover to my side Once you realize That all the water’s fine I’ll wash away that line And take your hand in mine I’m not the first and I won’t be the last to Fall prey to you Can’t deny and Can’t refuse you, though I Keep trying to Legs buckle under me Eyes roll up in my head You hold my insides So safely in your hands Walk wherever you like This is a new design … ‘cause I saw your side It’s not so different than mine I have seen the light Without a line, there is no fight All we want is a good life … Not …just for me and mine\n\n5.\n\nDivided We Fall 04:53\n\nDivided We Fall (Seisser/Hunt) Caught in the wake of the claim you stake Cannot break out till it’s broken Terms and conditions apply But it’s been awhile since anyone has spoken And all your takeaways perpetuate the same truth ‘Cause you only hear what’s best for you But it grows in corners And creeps up the walls It’s closing in until No light can get in at all And the only way out Is to look within Or grab another lens And look for a while through it More than what’s best for you Now you poked a hole or two Now you see the whole view Not just what is best Grab a hold and don’t let go Even though you’re gonna wanna throw It far away from here Keep it near for moments the Fearful blind folded try to steer It is bone-on-bone friction within you It’s a life-or-death question That you haven’t thought through And I’m beginning to understand the ways You’re stuck in a loop ‘Cause you only hear what’s best for you But it’s growing stronger It’s hard to ignore Cannot identify the wolf at the door no more Split down the middle This is do or die Seems like the same number of states do and don’t unite Grab a hold and don’t let go Even though you’re gonna wanna throw It far away from here Keep it near for moments the Fearful blind folded try to steer And all your takeaways perpetuate the same truth ‘Cause you only hear what’s best for you\n\n6.\n\nLife Cycle 06:43\n\nLife Cycle (Schang) Drifting down silently To black out the sunlight Every day they assured us, their only aim: Show us how to live in harmony, peacefully Everything began anew Ghostly memories fade Of past lives no longer Relevant to the new world they opened wide What drives them to give so openly So endlessly? When will be the time to know? It's a question for all Have they answered our call? Or are we just nothing but a means to an end? No more spending our days Watching time slip away The only thing that we may lose is our humanity We have all we could dream And still we grow restless Waiting to feel the passion that used to burn There must be a force that's waiting to collide with us Children know but they can't say It's a question for all Have they answered our call? Or are we just nothing but a means to an end?
