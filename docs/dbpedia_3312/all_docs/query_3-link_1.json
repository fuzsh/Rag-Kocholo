        "text": "2021 single by the Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber\n\n\"Stay\" is a song by Australian rapper and singer the Kid Laroi and Canadian singer Justin Bieber. It was released through Grade A Productions and Columbia Records on 9 July 2021, as the lead single (sixth overall) from Laroi's reloaded mixtape, F*ck Love 3: Over You. Laroi and Bieber wrote the song with Haan, FnZ members Finatik & Zac, and producers Cashmere Cat, Charlie Puth, Omer Fedi, and Blake Slatkin. The song marks the second collaboration between the two artists, following Bieber's song, \"Unstable\", a track from his sixth studio album, Justice (2021).\n\n\"Stay\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Laroi's first chart-topping single and Bieber's eighth, and additionally topped the Billboard Global 200. Furthermore, it reached number one in 21 other countries, including their respective natives Australia and Canada, along with Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, and Sweden. It also peaked within the top ten in 18 other countries. At the 2021 ARIA Music Awards, the song won the ARIA Award for Best Pop Release, which resulted in Laroi and Bieber both winning the ARIA Award for Best Artist.[1] At the APRA Music Awards of 2022, the song won the award for Song of the Year.[2]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 20 September 2020, Laroi shared a snippet of the song on an Instagram live stream, followed by a longer snippet in better quality that was previewed on a live stream from Rolling Loud on 29 October 2020. Bieber's contribution to the song was revealed on 31 May 2021. The song leaked in full on a Discord server on 2 June 2021.[3]\n\n\"Stay\" marks Laroi's first major single release as a lead artist in 2021 and Bieber's first major single as a lead artist since the release of his second extended play, Freedom, which was released in April 2021. On 3 June 2021, Scooter Braun, who has been Bieber's manager from the start of his career, also became Laroi's manager, until Laroi left and joined Adam Leber at Rebel Management on 27 September 2021.[4]\n\nLaroi had the song for about a year before its release. He created the song while spending time with producers Charlie Puth, Omer Fedi, and Blake Slatkin at Slatkin's house. Puth played the melody of the song on the keyboard, but Laroi ended up liking it and wanted to get it in production software Pro Tools to use it to create a song. He felt that \"it was probably the most organic way of making a song I've ever done – ever\". Laroi thought Bieber \"would sound perfect\", so he went to the studio at which Bieber records; they finished recording the song, but Bieber was hesitant about whether his vocals sounded good or not.[5]\n\nComposition and lyrics\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Stay\" is a fast-paced electropop,[6][7] pop rap,[8] pop rock,[9] and synth-pop song.[10] It is set in the key of D♭ major and incorporates piano keys, heavy drums, and \"splattering\" synths.[6][9][11] The upward-darting keyboard riff, made on a Roland Juno-60 synthesizer owned by Slatkin, serves as the song's spine and eventually becomes the chorus melody.[12][13] Over a repeated melodic cell, Laroi and Bieber switch between head voice and chest voice on a minor sixth.[14] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described the track as a \"hyper-slick\" hybridisation of new wave and pop-punk.[15] Some critics found similarities between it and the music from Bieber's sixth studio album, Justice (2021). Justin Curto from Vulture compared the song's sound to Justice single \"Hold On\" and album tracks \"Die for You\" and \"Somebody\".[16][17] Stereogum's Chris DeVille characterised it as \"[p]ost-SoundCloud pop-rap as effervescent Justice-style '80s pop\".[18]\n\nThe \"heartbreak-fueled\" lyrics to \"Stay\" enforce Laroi's toxic behaviour as he sets up a story about a troubled relationship where he is at fault.[19][20] In the chorus, he sings about his broken promises before begging for his partner to stay with him: \"I do the same thing I told you that I never would / I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could.\"[14][20][21] Robert Rowat of CBC Music interpreted the lines as \"an admission of weakness, if not a promise to be better\".[14] Bieber's verse echoes similar sentiments as he belts out lyrics about being unable to live without his loved one: \"When I'm away from you, I miss your touch / You're the reason I believe in love.\"[9][21][22] The song reaches its climax as Laroi and Bieber's voices join in the last chorus.[23]\n\nRelease and promotion\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 16 June 2021, Laroi and Bieber hinted at another collaboration. Leading up to its release, the two artists both teased the song multiple times on their respective social media accounts by posting snippets and teasing the lyrics.[24][25] Laroi also had previously stated on social media that Ron Perry, the label boss of Columbia Records would not release the song, to which Laroi asked his fans to repeatedly spam Perry on Instagram, which would hopefully change his mind into releasing it.[26][27] Laroi posted a picture of him at a basketball game on Instagram on 27 June 2021, holding a piece of paper that wrote the song title and the then-questionable release date, to which Puth teased his involvement of the song by commenting \"Yessssssssss\".[28] Three days later, Laroi shared a pre-order link in order to reveal the cover art, which would be posted the following day.[29]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe song has received generally positive reviews. Caramanica found \"Stay\" to be \"[b]racingly effective\", considering it a more effective pairing of Laroi and Bieber than their previous collaboration on \"Unstable\" from the latter's sixth studio album, Justice.[15] Tyler Jenke from Rolling Stone Australia wrote that \"the slick new tune\" is \"undoubtedly one that lives up [to] the hype\".[30] Jordan Rose of Complex believed that the track has Laroi and Bieber \"leaning into their strengths\".[31] Alex Zidel from HotNewHipHop felt that the song is \"every bit as infectious as [one] would expect\" and thought of it to be \"a solid pop offering for the summer\".[19] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard opined that the song \"sounds like it should push [Laroi] to a new level\" of stardom.[32] Uproxx contributing writer Carolyn Droke stated that the \"buoyant track['s]\" combination of \"a euphoric chorus and a driving beat\" will make it \"the next song of the summer\".[33] Rowat commended Laroi and Bieber's partnership as \"one of the year's best surprises\" and said that the song \"capitalizes on both singers' skills as falsettists\".[14] DeVille described the song as \"maniacally catchy\" and thought it musically feels like Laroi \"blasting off into a new frontier of crossover success\".[12] Curto called the track \"a high-energy, synth-filled pop banger\".[17] However, he later criticised the song for being \"some of Laroi's most anonymous work yet\" and concluded that \"it could just as easily be a hit for the Weeknd or Post Malone\".[16]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAwards and nominations for \"Stay\" Year Organization Award Result Ref. 2021 MTV Video Music Awards Song of Summer Nominated [34] ARIA Music Awards Best Artist Won [35] Best Pop Release Won 2022 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards Favorite Music Collaboration Won [36] APRA Music Awards Song of the Year Won [37] Billboard Music Awards Top Hot 100 Song Won [38] Top Streaming Song Won Top Radio Song Nominated Top Collaboration Won Top Billboard Global 200 Song Won Top Billboard Global (Excl.
