        "text": "September 15, 2010\n\nA colorful, accurate and essential volume in the half-century history of rock’n'roll.\n\nBefore the multi-nationals took over the record business, there were a handful of entrepreneurs whose personalities and determination created impressive and unique bodies of musical work. David Geffen (first with Asylum and then his own moniker, Geffen Records) Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss with their famed A&M Records and Chris Blackwell’s Island Records were three of the music world’s leading progenitors.\n\nIt was the Island enterprise that was easily the one whose musical output was most defined by the taste and interests of its owner, Chris Blackwell. Beginning in the late 50’s in his native Jamaica, and later upon arrival in the UK, it was Blackwell who was widely credited with bringing reggae music to the world stage. From his small base of operations, Blackwell began licensing Jamaican singles until he fortuitously had a worldwide hit with Millie Small’s “My Girl Lollipop.” The success of that record, lead to a series of even bigger successes with both English rock (Traffic, Cat Stevens, Roxy Music, King Crimson) and reggae music (Jimmy Cliff, Toots & the Maytals and of course the act that put Island into the stratosphere, Bob Marley & the Wailers.)\n\nIn this fitting visual history of the label, longtime Blackwell associate Suzette Newman and British rock author Chris Salewicz, take us on a journey of one of the most distinctive, powerful and successful independent record labels of the last 50 years. With essays contributed from those who were there as well as a chronological photo archive capturing most of the groups, single sleeves and album covers of the company’s five decades of output, “The Story of Island Records” is a colorful, accurate and essential volume in the half-century history of rock’n'roll.\n\nIf Island was known for anything, it was the distinctive edge of its artist’s style. Musicians from Mott the Hoople to Ultravox, Nick Drake to Brian Eno, and Grace Jones to P.J. Harvey all called Island home. But it was the world of reggae where Island had no peer. Not just the big stars, but somewhat lesser knowns like Aswad, Black Uhuru, Steel Pulse and Third World all had thriving careers on the label as well.\n\nThe history of Island Records is so robust, so colorful and this 222 page book captures the aura with perfect energy, detail and balance. And did I mention they signed a band called U2? Oh look, Blackwell changed the world… again."
