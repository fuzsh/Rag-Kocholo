        "text": "A beautifully illustrated celebration of one of the most influential pop music record labels of all time. Mixing cultures and influences from reggae to pop, hip hop, and punk, Island has shaken up artistic tastes and introduced new categories to mainstream music. This spectacularly illustrated book, published to celebrate the label’s fiftieth anniversary, moves from Island’s origins in founder Chris Blackwell’s pioneering mission to bring Jamaican reggae to the mainstream to the label’s continuing presence in the music industry. Accompanying essays by ten contemporary music critics—including Chris Salewicz, Jon Savage, and Joe Boyd—are photographs, artist portraits, and album art from such legendary acts as Bob Marley, U2, Steve Winwood, Brian Eno, Grace Jones, Tom Waits, Eric B & Rakim, Tricky, Keane, Amy Winehouse, and many others."
