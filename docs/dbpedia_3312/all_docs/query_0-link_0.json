        "text": "Although released in most areas as the first 'traditional' single from Zooropa, Stay was actually the third single released from the album, following Numb and Lemon. Stay would reappear throughout the years on other material released by U2. In 1993, an alternate version of the track was featured on the Faraway So Close soundtrack. A remix, titled the Underdog Remix appeared on the fan club only compilation CD, Melon, in 1995. In 2002 the track was featured on Craig Armstrong's album, As if to Nothing, and it featured vocals rerecorded by Bono in the summer of 2001.\n\nThe single actually contained two titles on the sinle for many releases making it a double A-Side with \"I've Got You Under My Skin\". The track was recorded as a duet by Bono and Frank Sinatra and was released at the same time as Stay. Both were climbing the charts at Christmas of 1993. The duet between Bono and Frank Sinatra was released on Sinatra's Duets album."
