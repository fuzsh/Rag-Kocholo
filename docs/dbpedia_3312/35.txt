"Stay Stay Stay" is the ninth track from the standard edition of American singer and songwriter Taylor Swift's fourth studio album, Red, released on October 22, 2012, through Big Machine Records. It is also the ninth track from her second re-recorded album, Red (Taylor's Version), released on November 12, 2021, through Republic Records.

Background[]

On the album, "Stay Stay Stay" follows "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". Swift has said "I went through a few roller coasters. Trying to chronicle each step of the way was challenging, because you go to some really dark places with the lyrics. Then in the next track, you're talking about how amazing it is to meet somebody new." She also told MTV News how she transforms her emotions into songs. "When I'm writing a song, I'm so in that zone that it's really sort of a trance I go into," she explained, "and I'm just kind of thinking about what I would say to this person that I'm writing the song about if I could just say whatever I wanted to them right now; that's kind of where I go in my head. And then the next thing is, I edit the song for a couple of days in my head and make sure that every line is as tight as I want it to be."

Hidden message[]

Hidden message: Daydreaming about real love.
