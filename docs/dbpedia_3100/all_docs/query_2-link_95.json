        "text": "I was always searching for what books to read to my kids. I liked to read to them, and they liked to listen, even after they learned to read books on their own. But this time, I hadn’t carefully screened a book before I started reading it to them, and I realized too late that the main character solved his problem by lying, without facing any consequences for his decision. When the book ended, we had a good conversation about how the ends don’t justify the means, and I began to consider how I could be more proactive in choosing quality books for my kids.\n\nWhat books to read to my children\n\nTo start a list of books to read to my children, I wrote down titles that made an impact on me, along with the age I was when I read them. To that, I added recommendations from family members, trusted friends and my children’s teachers. Then I verified age and content appropriateness through book review websites such as PluggedIn.com/book-reviews. Here are a few other ideas:\n\n• Challenges. When children go through changes, such as a move to a new school, it’s wise to find books that focus on similar situations. Otherwise, look for books to read to children with realistic characters who appear to use reason or logic to overcome challenges. These character-driven stories can help kids learn to solve their own challenges.\n\n• Worldviews. Research the publisher and author to uncover a book’s worldview. A publisher’s mission statement or an author’s biography gives clues. (Even lesser-known authors have brief biographies or links to achievements.) This helps to better understand why Philip Pullman (The Amber Spyglass) depicts Christianity poorly and George MacDonald (The Princess and the Goblin) represents it well; or why Frances Hodgson Burnett’s earlier books (Sara Crewe) did not have the same Christian Science subtleties as her later work (The Secret Garden). You shouldn’t necessarily avoid all books that have a different worldview from yours, but it is important to discuss the books’ worldview with your kids if there is one. Unfortunately, a book written by someone with a biblical worldview doesn’t guarantee that a book is written well. So use your common sense as you find books to read to your kids.\n\n• Book reviews. Read a book review from a trusted source, and then consider the appropriateness of the genre and plot for your children (age, developmental stage, current life challenges). Once you decide on a book that will work with your children’s personalities, interests and developmental stage — physically and spiritually — read it to them. When done, discuss the book through free tools such as the parent-child discussion questions at FocusOnTheFamily.com/discuss-books.\n\nReading to 4- to 7-year-olds\n\nBook titles listed below have been reviewed by Focus on the Family, though not all books published by Focus on the Family have reviews because they are wholly approved by Focus on the Family. Those that don’t have reviews are linked to an online bookstore where you can read descriptions about the books. The titles below are intended to help parents create their own list of books to read to their children. There is some overlap of book titles between the age groups because of the wide variety of differences in children at each age and stage. Remember that PluggedIn.com book reviews are not endorsements and cover only the content and theme of a book, not its literary merit.\n\nAdventure\n\nBible Kidventures: Stories of Danger and Courage*\n\nKids remain engaged as you read them four Bible stories in this choose-your-own Kidventure.
