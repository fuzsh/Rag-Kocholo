        "text": "IMPORTANT NOTICE TO GUESTS\n\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT ISSUED BY CARNIVAL CRUISE LINE TO, AND ACCEPTED BY, GUEST SUBJECT TO THE IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPEARING BELOW.\n\nTHE ATTENTION OF GUEST IS ESPECIALLY DIRECTED TO SECTIONS 1, 4, AND 12 THROUGH 15, WHICH CONTAIN IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON THE RIGHTS OF GUESTS TO ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST CARNIVAL CRUISE LINE, THE VESSEL, THEIR AGENTS AND EMPLOYEES, AND OTHERS, INCLUDING FORUM SELECTION, CHOICE OF LAW, TIME LIMITATIONS FOR FILING SUIT, ARBITRATION, WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n\nIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT - READ CAREFULLY!\n\nIn consideration of the receipt of the total cruise price and/or boarding and lodging on the vessel to which this Ticket Contract applies (the “Vessel”), Carnival Cruise Line (“Carnival”) and Guest agree that the booking of the cruise and the cruise are subject to the following terms and conditions:\n\n1. DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE OF CONTRACT\n\n(a) Whenever the word “Carnival” is used in this Contract it shall mean and include the Vessel, and all its owners, operators, employees, agents, charterers, and water shuttles. The term “Guest” shall include the plural where appropriate, and means all persons or entities booking or purchasing passage and/or traveling under this Contract, including heirs, representatives, and any accompanying minors. The masculine includes the feminine. “Guest” shall have the same meaning as “Passenger” in this Contract.\n\n(b) “Cruise Fare” or “Fare” means the amount paid for the cruise which includes full board, ordinary ship’s food during the voyage, but not charges or expenses for goods or services voluntarily or incidentally incurred by Guest, including, but not limited to, for spirits, wine, beer, soft drinks or mineral waters, shore excursions, salon and spa services, room service or dining in specialty restaurants, charges for any medical services received onboard, or Service Gratuities (as described below). “Required Cruise Fees and Expenses” means the amount of mandatory and third-party fees and expenses associated with the Cruise Fare for services on board and in port (which are subject to penalty). “Government Taxes and Fees” means taxes and government-imposed fees for the performance of the cruise and related purchases, such as port head taxes, value-added taxes, air and hotel taxes, and similar fees and taxes assessed on the transaction and associated with the Cruise Fare. “Cruise Charges” means the Cruise Fare and Required Cruise Fees and Expenses, combined. The “Total Cruise Price” means the Cruise Fare, Required Cruise Fees & Expenses and Government Taxes and Fees, combined.\n\n(c) The Total Cruise Price shall be deemed to be earned when paid and not refundable except as stated on Carnival’s website applicable to the voyage and as provided in Section 7 herein. For your convenience, a “Service Gratuity” will be automatically added to the onboard account for each guest, except for children under the age of 2, to recognize the efforts of a wide variety of crewmembers in various departments who contribute to the experiences of all our guests. Service Gratuities, which are subject to adjustment at your discretion, are pooled and distributed in the form of added wages, bonuses and/or crew benefits. A Service Charge will be automatically added to optional purchases for beverages, specialty dining and other voluntary purchases during the cruise.\n\n(d) This ticket is valid only for the person(s) named hereon as Guests and cannot be transferred or modified without Carnival’s written consent. The acceptance or use of this ticket by the person(s) named hereon as Guests shall be deemed acceptance and agreement by each of them to all of the terms and conditions of this cruise Contract.\n\n(e) All rights, exemptions from liability, defenses and immunities of Carnival under this contract shall also inure to the benefit of Carnival’s facilities, whether at sea or ashore, servants, agents, managers, affiliated or related companies, suppliers, shipbuilders and manufacturers of component parts and independent contractors, including, but not limited to, shore excursion or tour operators, ship’s physician, ship’s nurse, retail shop personnel, health and beauty staff, fitness staff, video diary staff, and other concessionaires, who shall have no liability to the Guest, either in contract or in tort, which is greater than or different from that of Carnival.\n\n(f) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this contract constitutes the entire agreement between Carnival and Guest and supersedes all other agreements, oral or written. Any alteration to any term of this contract must be in writing and authorized by Carnival. In the event of a direct conflict between a provision of this contract and a provision of the Cruise Industry Passenger Bill of Rights (“PBOR”) in effect at the time of booking PBOR controls. Guests purchasing, spa services or shore excursions through Carnival are subject to the additional terms and conditions which are incorporated by reference. VIFP Members agree to the additional terms and conditions of VIFP membership which are incorporated by reference. Except as provided in Section 14 below, should any provision of this contract be contrary to or invalid by virtue of the law of the jurisdiction in which this contract is sought to be enforced or be so held by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision(s) shall be deemed to be severed from the Contract and of no effect and all remaining provisions herein shall be in full force and effect and constitute the Contract of Carriage.\n\n(g) Onboard charges and additional expenses charged to Guest’s Sail and Sign® account will be made in the functional currency of the Vessel, which may differ from the type of currency used to secure the booking.\n\n2. TRAVEL DOCUMENTATION AND GUEST OBLIGATIONS\n\n(a) Proper travel documentation and eligibility to travel is required at embarkation and throughout the cruise. In addition to immigration and customs requirements, the U.S. government and others place restrictions on the carriage of Guests whose names appear on government watch lists or who are deemed legally ineligible to travel. It is the Guest’s sole responsibility to ensure his/her legal eligibility to travel and to bring and have available at all times all required travel documents. Guests are advised to check with their travel agent and with the appropriate government authorities to determine the necessary documents and travel eligibility requirements for their particular cruise destinations, including the port of embarkation. Carnival assumes no responsibility for advising Guest of what travel documents are required for the requested itinerary and it is recommended that Guest travel with a valid government issued passport at all times. Carnival may cancel the booking of any Guest who is or becomes ineligible to travel for any reason, or who is traveling without proper documentation. Any such Guest, or any Guest who fails to board the ship at embarkation, shall be ineligible to board the ship thereafter without Carnival’s consent, and shall not attempt to do so at the same or another port. Under these circumstances the Guest shall not be entitled to a refund or compensation of any kind. Guest is responsible for all related costs and fines, including without limitation travel expenses and for proper travel documentation for any port, or for departure from or arrival to their final destination. Under no circumstances shall Carnival be liable for any costs, damages or expenses whatsoever incurred by any Guest as a result of such failure, cancellation or denial of boarding.\n\n(b) Guest acknowledges receipt of Carnival’s applicable website and travel information and agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of not just this Contract, but also the information contained on Carnival’s website, including but not limited to the information contained in the “Frequently Asked Questions” and “Embarkation Information” sections.\n\n(c) Guest acknowledges that, for a voyage commencing in a United States port for a round-trip voyage via one or more United States ports, Guest must complete the voyage and disembark at the embarkation port. Failure to do so may result in a fine or penalty being imposed by the United States Customs Service or other governmental agency. In consideration for the Cruise Fare paid, Guest agrees to pay any such fine or penalty imposed because of Guest’s failure to complete the voyage.\n\n(d) Carnival shall refuse boarding to any Guest under the age of twenty-one (21) unless: (1) the Guest is traveling in the same stateroom with an individual twenty-five years or older; (2) traveling in the same stateroom with their spouse; or (3) traveling with a parent or guardian in an accompanying stateroom; or (4) is a qualified member of the U.S. military. Adult Guests agree to be responsible at all times for the safety and behavior of their minor Guests who are traveling with them and Guests agree to properly supervise and monitor all minors traveling with them and to prevent such minors from engaging in hazardous horseplay or any other dangerous behavior. Proof of age and/or proof of marriage are required. Carnival shall not be liable to make any refunds or for any damages with respect to any Guest’s failure to provide proper proof of age or marriage or otherwise comply with this provision.\n\n(e) Guests must attend the mandatory safety briefing once onboard at the commencement of the cruise and any subsequent briefing ordered by the ship’s officer during the cruise. Guests shall comply with all onboard health, environmental and safety policies and procedures (including but not limited to those specified in Sections 5 and 6 below and on Carnival’s website(opens a new window)), and shall familiarize themselves with the nature and character of the ship, as well as, all emergency exits, to assist with safe evacuation in the event of an emergency.\n\n(f) Guests must comply with all pre-embarkation, onboard and shore excursion rules and policies including, but not limited to, all environmental and public health policies and procedures, and shall familiarize themselves with the nature and character of the ship, onboard waste /recycling receptacle stations, and Guest agrees to comply with all such policies and procedures, as well as environmental laws and regulations.\n\n(g) Carnival may deny boarding to any persons with certain enumerated crimes on their record, which include but are not limited to aggravated assault (including aggravated domestic violence), murder, robbery, sexual assault, and other sexual offenses. Carnival reserves the right to access public records containing information about any criminal convictions and/or crimes to which Guest has pleaded guilty as part of its Guest screening process, including obtaining a consumer background report showing such criminal pleas and convictions from a credit reporting agency and to deny embarkation at any time to any person who has been convicted of any of or pleaded guilty to any of the crimes enumerated above. Carnival may also deny boarding to any persons who have violated Carnival’s Code of Conduct in the past or persons whom Carnival deems to be a concern for the safety or wellbeing of other guests or crew. Guest hereby consents to Carnival’s accessing public records concerning Guest and obtaining a consumer background report regarding Guest from a credit reporting agency regarding criminal conviction/s and conduct as part of its screening policy. In the event a denial of boarding: 1) the reservation of the Guest who is denied boarding because of a criminal record, past violation of Carnival’s Code of Conduct, or because of a concern for the safety or wellbeing of other guests or crew, shall be deemed to have been cancelled by the Guest who is denied boarding on the date of the booking of such Guest’s reservation, and subject to the standard cancellation penalties in Section 7 below and 2) the booking, reservation and ticket contract of any Guest travelling with any person denied boarding due to this screening policy (including, but not limited to, the booking, reservation or ticket contract of those in the same travel party as Guest, whether or not such person was to stay in the same cabin or another cabin with the individual denied boarding) shall be unaffected and cancellation by any of these other Guests will be subject to the standard cancellation penalties in Section 7 below.\n\n(h), Guests must arrive on time at the port and at their designated arrival appointment time. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Carnival’s Cancellation and Refund Policy, no refunds will be made in the event of “no shows”, unused tickets, lost tickets, partially used tickets, or cancellations received late or after the start of the cruise. Guest further acknowledges and agrees that they must debark the vessel as instructed by the crew and at their designated time slot for debarkation. Guests will not be permitted to delay the debarkation process or request late debarkation.\n\n3. YOUR TRAVEL AGENT; CONTACT INFORMATION AND RELEASE\n\n(a) Any travel agent, sales agent, or third party travel company utilized by the Guest in connection with the booking of the cruise, or this contract, is solely the agent of the Guest and not Carnival. Carnival is not responsible for the financial condition or integrity of any travel agent utilized by Guest. In the event that an agent shall fail to remit to Carnival any monies paid to the agent by Guest, Guest shall be and remain liable for any fare or other amounts due to Carnival, regardless of whether liability is asserted before or after embarkation. Issuance and validity of ticket contract is conditional upon final payment being received by Carnival prior to sailing. Any refund made by Carnival to an agent on behalf of Guest shall be deemed payment to Guest, regardless of whether the monies are delivered by the agent to Guest. Receipt of this ticket contract, any other documentation or notification pertaining to the cruise by Guest’s travel agent shall constitute receipt by Guest.\n\n(b) Guest agrees that any email address, telephone number, or mailing address provided to Carnival during the booking or per-cruise process by or on behalf of such Guest (“Provided Contact Information”) may be used by Carnival as the email address, telephone number, or mailing address for such Guest, whether or not the Provided Contact Information in fact includes Guest’s individual email address, telephone number, or mailing address. Guest consents to and agrees that Carnival may use the Provided Contact Information to give any notice or information relating to Guest’s reservation, booking, or ticket contract and that Carnival’s sending of any notice or information by use of the Provided Contact Information shall constitute notice to Guest. Guest further consents to and agrees that Carnival may communicate with any person contacting Carnival from any Provided Contact Information concerning Guest’s reservation, booking, or ticket contract.

PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES; UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTANCE OF RISKS\n\nGUESTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO DISCUSS THE ADVISABILITY OF TRAVEL WITH THEIR PHYSICIAN AND TO REVIEW THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (“CDC”) WEBSITE FOR UPDATED INFORMATION. GUEST ACKNOWLEDGES, UNDERSTANDS AND ACCEPTS THAT WHILE ABOARD THE VESSEL, IN TERMINALS AND BOARDING AREAS, OR DURING ACTIVITIES ASHORE AND/ OR WHILE TRAVELING TO OR FROM THE VESSEL, THE GUEST OR OTHER GUESTS MAY BE EXPOSED TO COMMUNICABLE ILLNESSES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COVID-19, INFLUENZA, COLDS AND NOROVIRUS. GUEST FURTHER UNDERSTANDS AND ACCEPTS THAT THE RISK OF EXPOSURES TO THESE COMMUNICABLE ILLNESSES AND OTHERS IS INHERENT IN MOST ACTIVITIES WHERE PEOPLE INTERACT OR SHARE COMMON FACILITIES, ARE BEYOND CARNIVAL’S CONTROL, AND CANNOT BE ELIMINATED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. GUEST KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY ACCEPTS THESE RISKS AS PART OF THIS TICKET CONTRACT, INCLUDING THE RISK OF SERIOUS ILLNESS OR DEATH ARISING FROM SUCH EXPOSURES, AND/OR ALL RELATED DAMAGES, LOSS, COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER.\n\n6. NATURE OF CRUISE; FITNESS TO TRAVEL; SPECIAL NEEDS; PREGNANCY AND INFANTS; DISEMBARKATION\n\n(a) The Guest admits a full understanding of the character of the voyage and the Vessel and assumes all risks incident to travel and transportation and handling of Guests and cargo. While at sea or in port the availability of medical care may be limited or delayed. Guest acknowledges that all or part of their voyage may be in areas where medical care and evacuation may not be available. Guest agrees to indemnify and reimburse Carnival in the event Carnival elects to advance the cost of emergency medical care, including medical care provided ashore as well as transportation and/or lodging in connection therewith. Guest acknowledges that their own health insurance will not cover or be applicable to any medical services received on board and that such charges may not be eligible for reimbursement from Guest’s own insurance. Guest acknowledges and agrees that they are solely responsible for all charges related to medical services received onboard and/or at a port of call. Carnival strongly encourages all guests to obtain travel insurance prior to the cruise that can help offset such medical expenses. Guest further acknowledges and agrees that all charges for delivered onboard medical services will be automatically applied to the Guest’s shipboard Sail and Sign® account. Guests who embark in violation of the Ticket Contract terms assume all associated risks and agree to indemnify and reimburse Carnival for all resulting losses, costs and expenses, including without limitation those related to the Vessel’s deviation from its scheduled route, and other expenses attributable to disembarkation of such Guests. Guests are further advised to refer to Sections 5 and 11 which specify their responsibilities and obligations in these situations.\n\n(b) Carnival’s vessels visit numerous ports in a number of countries. Guests assume responsibility for their own safety and Carnival cannot guarantee Guest’s safety at any time. The United States Department of State, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other governmental and tourist organizations regularly issue advisories and warnings to travelers and Carnival strongly recommends Guests obtain and consider such information when making travel decisions. Carnival assumes no responsibility for gathering said information.\n\n(c) Guest warrants that Guest and Guest’s travelling party are physically and emotionally fit to travel at the time of embarkation, and further warrants that such Guests have no medical or emotional condition that would endanger any Guest or crewmembers or result in a deviation of the voyage. Any Guest with special medical, physical, or other needs requiring medical attention or special accommodation during the voyage is requested to notify Carnival in writing at the time of booking of such special need. Upon booking the cruise, Guests who have special needs are requested to contact Carnival’s Guest Access Desk (305-599-2600 ext. 70025) to discuss the details of their special needs. Carnival recommends that any Guest who is not self-sufficient travel with a companion who shall take responsibility for any assistance needed during the voyage. Carnival does not provide one-on-one personal care assistance, and all Guests must be able to provide such care for themselves (e.g., performing personal tasks such as eating, dressing, toileting, bathing, and getting around the ship). Once on board, our crew will not provide any assistance with such personal tasks. Guests are encouraged to contact their treating physician to discuss their health concerns, including pregnancy, before traveling. (See Clause 6(d) below for pregnancy restrictions).\n\n(d) Carnival and the Master each reserves the right to adopt and implement public health protocols, refuse boarding or passage, disembark, or confine to a stateroom any Guest who violates the terms of this ticket contract or Carnival’s policies or any Guest whose physical or mental condition or behavior would be considered, in the sole opinion of the Captain in consultation with the ship's physician, a risk to any Guest or crew member. Guest understands and acknowledges that in addition to the limitations on medical care described in Clause 6(a), prenatal and early infant care, in particular, may require specialized diagnostic facilities and/or treatment that are not available or obtainable during the cruise on board the ship and/or ashore in ports of call. Therefore, any Guest that is unfit to travel, and any Guest who will at any time during the cruise enter her 24th week of estimated gestational age, agrees not to book a cruise or board the ship. Infants must be at least 6 months of age at the time of embarkation in order to sail, however children must be at least 12 months of age at the time of embarkation to sail on the following itineraries: Transoceanic voyages and remote itineraries, where there are more than 2 consecutive sea days. Carnival and the Master reserve the right to disembark any unfit Guest or any Guest whose behavior affects the comfort, enjoyment, safety or wellbeing of other Guests or crew members. Guests disembarked in such circumstances shall be liable as set forth in Sections 2, 9 and 11. Carnival reserves the right to debark, deny boarding, or cancel the reservation without refund, compensation, or payment of any Guest who is unfit to travel and/or who will be in excess of their 23rd week of gestation at time of sailing, except as set forth in Carnival’s cancellation policy described in Section 7 below, based on the timing of such cancellation.\n\n7. CANCELLATION BY GUEST, REFUNDS\n\n8. CARNIVAL’S RIGHT TO INCREASE FARES, INCREASE OR ESTABLISH CHARGES FOR GOODS AND SERVICES, CANCEL OR CHANGE VOYAGE, AND CHANGE STATEROOM ASSIGNMENTS AND TO PERFORM CONSTRUCTION OR REPAIRS, LIMITATIONS ON VACATION PROTECTION PRODUCTS\n\n(a) Subject to applicable laws, Carnival reserves the right to increase published fares and air fare supplements without prior notice. However, fully paid or deposited Guests will be protected, except for fares listed, quoted, advertised or booked in error, other changes to deposit, payment and cancellation terms/conditions, which are subject to change without notice at any time prior to the Guest receiving a confirmed booking. In the event that a cruise fare listed, quoted or advertised through any website, Carnival sales person, travel agent or any other source is booked but is incorrect due to an electronic error, typographical error, human error or any other error causing the fare to be listed, quoted or advertised for an amount not intended by Carnival, Carnival reserves the right to correct the erroneous fare by requesting the Guest to pay the correct fare intended (and associated fees, expenses and taxes), or by canceling the cruise in exchange for a full refund, but in no event shall Carnival be obligated to honor any such booking resulting from the error or otherwise be liable in such circumstances.\n\n(b) Carnival reserves the right to offer promotional cruise fares that require a minimum occupancy requirement per cabin. When the booked cruise fare is contingent on a minimum occupancy requirement per cabin, cancellation by one or more Guests in a cabin may cause an adjustment to the remaining Guests booked cruise fare based on the prevailing and available rate at the time of the cancellation (“recalculated fare”). Final payment in full of the recalculated fares (and associated fees, expenses and taxes) for all remaining Guests in a cabin is due by 11:59:59 p.m. EST on the eve before the start of the cancellation penalty period. Failure to make timely final payment in full of the recalculated total price by all remaining Guests in a cabin will result in automatic cancellation of the reservation for the entire cabin.\n\n(c) Carnival has the right, without previous notice to the Guest, to cancel this contract at the port of embarkation or at any time during the voyage. In the event a voyage is canceled or terminated early due to a mechanical failure of the Vessel, Guest is entitled to their Total Cruise Price, or a proportional share thereof as determined by Carnival, in addition to transportation to the Vessel’s scheduled port of disembarkation or Guest’s home city, at Carnival’s discretion and expense, as well as necessary lodging at the unscheduled port of disembarkation, if required, at Carnival’s expense. In the event a voyage is canceled or shortened for any reason other than a mechanical failure of the Vessel, Guest shall be entitled to a Future Cruise Credit or an Onboard Credit equal to their Total Cruise Price paid or a proportional part thereof, as determined by Carnival, and Carnival shall have no further liability for damages or compensation of any kind.\n\n(d) Carnival may change the duration and/or itinerary of the cruise at any time. The Vessel shall be entitled to leave and enter ports with or without pilots or tugs, to tow and assist other vessels in any circumstances, to return to or enter any port at the Master’s discretion and for any purpose, and to deviate in any direction or for any purpose from the direct or usual course, and to omit or change any or all port calls, arrival or departure times, with or without notice, for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to health and safety, security, adverse weather, hurricanes, tornadoes, strikes, tides, hostilities, civil unrest, port closings, emergency debarkations of Guests or crew, late air, sea, car or motor coach departures or arrivals, mechanical breakdowns, declared pandemics, public health emergencies or outbreak of communicable disease, quarantines, national or regional emergencies, US or foreign governmental advisories or travel warnings, all such deviations being considered as forming part of and included in the proposed voyage. Except as provided in Clause 8(c) with respect to mechanical failures, as provided in Carnival’s change of itinerary policy in effect when the Guest or Guest’s agent accepts the terms of this Ticket Contract, or as required by federal regulations, Carnival shall have no liability for any compensation or other damages in such circumstances for any change in itinerary, ports of call, ports of embarkation and debarkation, and/or duration of the cruise (including a longer than planned duration of the cruise due to port closings) (Carnival’s change of itinerary policy can be found at Carnival's Website (opens a new window) or at Carnival's FAQs(opens a new window) Page).\n\n(e) Except as provided in Clause 8(c) with respect to mechanical failures, or as required by federal regulations, if the performance of the proposed voyage is hindered or prevented (or in the opinion of Carnival or the Master is likely to be hindered or prevented) by war, hostilities, blockage, ice, labor conflicts, adverse weather conditions, strikes on board or ashore, restraint of Princes, Rulers or People (including but not limited to orders by governmental agencies restricting travel due to declared pandemics, public health emergencies or outbreak of communicable disease, quarantines, national or regional emergencies) seizure under legal process, breakdown of the Vessel, congestion, docking difficulties or any other cause whatsoever or if Carnival or the Master considers that for any reason whatsoever, proceeding to, attempting to enter, or entering or remaining at the port of Guest’s destination may expose the Vessel to risk or loss or damage or be likely to delay her, the Guest and his baggage may be landed at the port of embarkation or at any port or place at which the Vessel may call, at which time the responsibility of Carnival shall cease and this contract shall be deemed to have been fully performed, or if the Guest has not embarked, Carnival may cancel the proposed voyage without liability to refund passage money or charges or fares paid in advance.\n\n(f) Carnival and the Master shall have liberty to comply with any orders, recommendations or directions whatsoever given by the Government or Department of any nation or by any person acting or purporting to act with the authority of such Government or Department or by any Committee or person having under the terms of the War Risks Insurance on the Vessel the right to give such orders, recommendations or directions, and if by reason of, and in compliance with any such orders, recommendations or directions anything is done or is not done the same shall not be deemed a deviation or a breach of this contract. Disembarkation of any Guest or discharge of baggage in accordance with such orders, recommendations or directions shall constitute due and proper fulfillment of the obligation of Carnival under this Contract.\n\n(g) Specific stateroom assignments are not guaranteed. Carnival reserves the right to move Guests to a comparable stateroom for any reason, including but not limited to, instances in which a stateroom is booked with fewer than the maximum number of Guests the stateroom can accommodate; or when a partial Guest cancellation occurs and the remaining number of Guests do not match the maximum number of Guests the stateroom can accommodate.\n\n(h) Guest agrees and acknowledges that Carnival may, at any time and without notice, impose charges for, increase charges for and/or eliminate goods and services voluntarily purchased by Guest, other than what is included in your Cruise Fare, without liability to the Guest. These additional charges are exclusive of your Cruise Fare. The goods and services offered or available during the cruise, may differ from goods and services previously offered or available on prior cruises and/or what was advertised on prior versions of Carnival’s website (Carnival.com), commercials, in other printed media, and/or in prior verbal discussions.\n\n(i) Carnival reserves the right to periodically perform repairs to the Vessel and/or perform construction on the Vessel to alter, amend or remove any appurtenance, amenity, or facility on the Vessel. Guest acknowledges that such repairs, alterations, amendments or removal of any appurtenance may occur during the cruise and agrees that Carnival shall not be liable to Guest for a refund, of any portion of the Total Cruise Price, full, partial or otherwise, nor shall Guest have any legal or equitable cause of action relating thereto.\n\n(j) Guest hereby acknowledges and agrees that Carnival’s “Great Vacation Guarantee” program has been suspended and that Guest is not entitled to any benefit thereof.\n\n9.

Guest further agrees to abide by all shipboard rules and policies. Guests shall not solicit anyone on the Vessel for any commercial, professional, illegal, or illicit purposes. Guest agrees that any violation of this or any Clause in the ticket contract may subject Guest to disembarkation with no refund to the Guest and any such actions may cause Guest to be prohibited from sailing with Carnival in the future.\n\n(b) Guest acknowledges that smoking is only permitted in designated areas. Guest agrees to refrain from smoking in non-designated areas and agrees that Carnival has the right to assess up to a $500 charge, per violation, and to disembark the Guest for failure to observe Carnival's Tobacco and Marijuana Smoking Policy (\"Smoking Policy\")(opens a new window) with no refund to the Guest.\n\n(c) Any and all forms of smoking, including but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, pipes, vaporizers, and electronic cigarettes are strictly prohibited on board Carnival’s vessels except in specific designated exterior deck areas and designated casino/night club spaces. All staterooms and suite accommodations, including the outside balconies, are NON-SMOKING. In accordance with Carnival's Smoking Policy(opens a new window) any marijuana possession or use is strictly prohibited on all Carnival ships at all times, regardless of local, state, or other laws which might permit use or possession of marijuana. Carnival abides by U.S. Federal Law which prohibits the possession or use of marijuana on its ships for any reason. Any Guest who brings marijuana or any illegal controlled substances on board, in violation of Carnival’s policy or U.S. or international law, including any law of a port or the flag state, will be reported to local and/or Federal authorities and U.S. Customs & Border Protection for possible detainment and/or enforcement action. Carnival may deny boarding or disembark any Guest who brings or attempts to bring marijuana or any illegal substance on board with no refund to Guest and at Guest’s own expense for repatriation and travel. Guest agrees to strictly comply with Carnival’s Smoking Policy. Guest further agrees that any violation of Carnival’s Smoking Policy would also cause Carnival to incur damages, including but not limited to, loss of Guest goodwill, revenue, cleaning, maintenance, fines and/or other costs. Any evidence of smoking in a stateroom or balcony, e.g.; smoke smell/residue, butts, ashes, upholstery/furniture burns, tampering of the smoke alarm, will constitute a violation of Carnival's Smoking Policy(opens a new window). Guests who violate our Smoking Policy will be assessed a $500 charge, per violation, on the Guest’s Sail & Sign® account, and may also result in the disembarkation of all Guests in the stateroom. Fines will be assessed in the functional currency of the Vessel which might be different than the currency used to secure the booking. Such Guests will be solely responsible for all resulting financial penalties and expenses to return home, and no portion of their Total Cruise Price will be refunded. Guest further acknowledges and agrees that any violation of this policy shall, in the sole discretion of Carnival, constitute a material breach of this cruise contract. In the event of such breach, Guest forfeits all rights hereunder, including the right to remain on board. Carnival reserves the right to disembark Guest(s), at any port, as determined by Carnival. Carnival shall not be liable for any refund or other compensation or damages whatsoever to any Guest disembarked pursuant to this provision, or who disembarks because another Guest is so disembarked. Such Guests may also be prohibited from sailing with Carnival in the future.\n\n(d) Guest agrees, in all ports of call, to return to the Vessel or pre-boarding location in accordance with instructions given by the Vessel’s Master or his authorized officer. Guest further acknowledges that shipboard and shore side clocks may have different times, but it is Guest’s responsibility to return to the Vessel or pre-boarding location so as not to miss Vessel’s departure. Any costs associated with transporting Guest to rejoin the Vessel including, but not limited to, governmental fees, visa fees, subsistence, lodging, air fare, launch fare, car hire or agency fees shall be for the account of Guest. The Guest shall be liable to and shall reimburse Carnival or the Master for any fines or penalties imposed on Carnival by any government, governmental or regulatory agency, entity, or official, port or port official, or for expenses or losses caused or incurred for Guest’s intentional or negligent act or omission, including but not limited to, criminal or disruptive behavior by the Guest onboard or Guest’s failure to board the ship prior to the scheduled departure time at any port.\n\n(e) Carnival has a “zero tolerance” policy toward any illegal activity or behavior by Guests or crew aboard. Guest agrees to comply with this policy and further acknowledges that it is Carnival’s policy to report incidents of illegal activity or behavior to the appropriate law enforcement authorities. Carnival will cooperate with relevant authorities in any civil or criminal proceedings sought by those agencies. For the safety of the Vessel and of other guests and crew, Carnival reserves the right to confine any Guest who commits a crime on board until law enforcement authorities can be contacted and/or board the Vessel.\n\nFor safety reasons, Guests are prohibited from bringing alcoholic beverages on board with the following exception: At the beginning of the cruise during embarkation day, Guests (21 years of age and older) may carry on in their hand luggage, one 750 ml bottle of sealed/unopened wine or champagne per person. A $15 corkage fee (a charge exacted at a restaurant for every bottle of wine served that was not bought on the premises), per 750 ml bottle, will be charged should Guests wish to consume their wine or champagne in a main dining room, steakhouse or bar. Guests are also prohibited from bringing water, sodas and other non-alcoholic beverages on board that are packaged in bottles. A small quantity of non-alcoholic beverages (i.e., sparkling water, sodas, juice, milk) packaged in cans or cartons may be brought on board on embarkation day, only if carried on in Guests’ hand luggage (not in checked luggage). A small quantity is considered a maximum of 12 sealed, unopened cans/cartons of 12 ounces each or less per person. Any hard liquor, beer, other forms of alcoholic beverage, and non-alcoholic beverages, outside of the exceptions referenced above, are strictly prohibited (in both carry-on and checked luggage) and such items will be confiscated and discarded, and no compensation will be provided. Alcoholic beverages purchased in the Vessel’s gift shops or at a port of call will be retained by Carnival until the end of the voyage. Carnival reserves the right to refuse to serve alcohol to any passenger. Guest acknowledges that the minimum age permitted for the purchase, possession, or consumption of alcoholic beverages aboard Carnival’s vessels is twenty-one (21). Guest agrees to supervise all persons under age twenty-one (21) under Guest’s charge to ensure that they do not violate this, or any other, shipboard regulation. Guests who attempt to purchase alcohol by using false identification or the Sail & Sign® card of a Guest who is twenty-one or older will be deemed in violation of this policy. Any Guest twenty-one or older who attempts to or purchases alcohol for any Guest under twenty-one will also be deemed in violation of this policy. Guest agrees that Carnival has the right to disembark any Guest who violates this policy and as well as any adults traveling with minors who violate this policy or any other shipboard regulation.\n\n(f) Compliance with APHIS regulations: To protect U.S. agriculture and natural resources from the introduction and spread of foreign plant and animal pests and diseases please be advised that agricultural products including seeds, soil, live insects, food such as fresh fruit, vegetables and animal products including meat, milk, and eggs must not be brought back to the United States.

Specifically, items worn during the cruise should not contain any message that may be considered offensive or contain nudity, profanity, sexual innuendo/suggestions. In addition, clothing/accessories should not promote negative ethnic or racial commentary, or hatred or violence in any form. Violation of this policy may result in Guest’s disembarkation with no refund of any portion of their Total Cruise Price.\n\n(i) All guests must adhere to Carnival’s environmental policy as follows: Any dumping or pollution of any kind including discharge of any item into the ocean and/or waterways is strictly prohibited. Guest will be strictly liable for any illegal dumping or pollution. Any willful or negligent act of discharging or releasing any unauthorized item overboard, without the express permission of the ship's staff may result in a $500 charge, per violation, posted to Guest’s Sail & Sign® account. Fines will be imposed using the functional currency of the Vessel, which may be different than the form of currency used to secure the booking. Additionally, Guest will be charged the reimbursement cost of any unauthorized discharged property belonging to Carnival and such charge will be posted to Guest’s Sail & Sign® account. Guest shall also be responsible for any fines or penalties imposed on Carnival by any government, governmental agency or official, port or port official, or for expenses or losses caused or incurred for Guest’s violation of this policy. Violation of this policy may result in the disembarkation of all guests in the stateroom. Guests who are disembarked for violating our environmental policy will be responsible for all financial charges and expenses to return home, and no refund of any portion of their unused Total Cruise Price will be provided. Additionally, they may be prohibited from sailing with Carnival Cruise Line in the future.\n\n(j) Consistent with our commitment to safety and our “zero tolerance” policy set forth in Section 9(e) above, any illegal activity or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated. Any Guest whose conduct affects the comfort, enjoyment, safety, or well-being of other guests or crew will be detained onboard and/or disembarked at their own expense and will be prohibited from sailing with Carnival in the future. Any violation of our “zero tolerance” policy is a breach of the Ticket Contract, for which Guest agrees to pay Carnival liquidated damages of $500, to be charged to the Guest’s Sail and Sign® account without further notice or consent, representing the reputational and goodwill damages and injury to Carnival for Guest’s violations. In addition, Guest or Guest’s estate agrees to defend and indemnify Carnival and the Vessel, their servants and agents against liability which Carnival or the Vessel or such servants or agents may incur towards any person, company, or Government for any damage to property, personal injury, or death caused directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by any illegal activity or disruptive behavior of Guest and those minors traveling with Guest.\n\n(k) Carnival may impose a curfew for minors by requiring Guests under 18 years of age to be clear of all public areas by 1:00 a.m. ship’s time unless they are accompanied by an adult in their traveling party, 21 years of age or older, or they are participating in a Carnival youth program activity.\n\n10.

Arrangements by CARNIVAL: If you are participating in our FLY2FUN program, or FLY2FUN and Tour package, Carnival will arrange for air transportation from the select home cities offered to an airport near the departure point of your Cruise or Cruise tour and return air transportation from an airport near the termination point of your Cruise or Cruise tour to the home city from which you departed. Please refer to Carnival’s web page for additional information on our FLY2FUN program and destinations. Carnival reserves the right to add or withdraw an air city at any time but will attempt to accommodate those Guests under deposit or final payment. Air bookings are not guaranteed and are subject to air carrier’s availability and restrictions. Guest who purchased the FLY2FUN program will be responsible for securing their own hotel accommodations and will be responsible for hotel, taxes, porterage and transportation between the hotel and the airport/pier.\n\n31. Schedule Changes/Air Delays: Carnival strives to accommodate each Guest on flights that will ensure timely arrival and boarding of your ship. In the event that weather conditions or other flight changes delay the Guest’s arrival to the ship, Carnival, at its own expense, will make alternate flight, hotel and/or ground transportation arrangements to get the Guest to the port of embarkation in time to board the ship or to the first port of call, without violating the Jones Act. If no viable options are available to join the ship, Guest will be given a Future Cruise Credit to apply towards a future cruise. Carnival reserves the right to change or alter, without notice, flight arrangements in order to meet our ship departure and/or arrival times. Guest will be notified of flight re-accommodations. If tickets have already been issued, Carnival will adjust your itinerary or air carrier accordingly and will notify Guests of any price adjustments that may be necessary. If you choose to cancel your flight arrangements or alter your airline schedule in any way once your tickets have been issued you will be responsible for any additional cost or fees resulting from the cancellation or change, which can total up to the full cost of the ticket. If you request Carnival’s assistance with a change in airline arrangements, within 60 days of departure and you purchased FLY2FUN Flexible Fare program, a service fee of $200 USD, or its equivalent in foreign currency, will be levied in addition to any charges imposed by the airlines. If you purchased the FLY2FUN Restricted Fare program and you chose to make a change, all airline-imposed change fees will be levied regardless of when the change is made. If your flights are delayed, refer to the Fly2Fun Page(opens a new window).\n\n32. Refunds/Seat Assignments/Special Services/Fares/Lost Tickets/Baggage Charges: Failure to use your FLY2FUN airline ticket/s results in a waiver of its value and any compensation; unused airline tickets are only refundable to Carnival. Please note that because of changing airline tariffs, your actual air ticket may reflect fares higher or lower than the air add-on or cruise only credit amounts originally quoted. If so, the difference is neither chargeable nor refundable to you; you will be charged the amount originally quoted. Carnival reserves the right to pass on to the Guest any cancellation or change penalties, which may total up to the amount originally quoted. It is your sole responsibility to re-confirm flight arrangements, within 48 hours of flight departure. Please note that although Carnival Cruise Line can pass requests for seat assignments, special meals and special assistance to the airlines, we cannot guarantee that such requests will be honored. For the best travel experience, we recommend that Guests or their travel agents contact the airlines directly to confirm these requests. Carnival is not responsible for airline schedule changes. Guests are responsible for luggage fees, excess luggage charges as well as any other charges imposed by airlines or airports. For additional information on airline’s baggage charges and fees please refer to the Airline Baggage FAQs page(opens a new window), reference against the Travel Information page you received along with your cabin confirmation or the Travel Information page in your cruise document accessed through Manage My Cruise.\n\n33. Liability and Relationship with Airlines: If Carnival is unable to arrange for air transportation for any cause beyond Carnival’s control, such as airline capacity controls, air transportation arranged is no longer available, or otherwise fails to materialize, Carnival’s sole liability will be limited to refunding the air add-on paid or cruise only credit. Carnival acts as an independent travel agent, and it is not affiliated with the airline carriers. Carnival books air as a convenience for the Guests. Carnival assumes no liability for any of the airlines’ acts or omissions, including, without limitation, those involving cancellation of flights, schedule changes, re-routings, damage to or delay or loss of baggage, flight delays, equipment failures, accidents, pilot or other staff shortages, overbooking or clerical/system errors. Your rights against the airlines are controlled and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the airline’s ticket and tariffs, and any and all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIMPORTANT ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR CARNIVAL EASY PAY OPTION\n\n34.

Guest authorizes Carnival to charge each payment to the credit card associated with Guest’s Carnival.com account that was used to make the initial payment or, if Carnival is unable to complete a charge using such credit card, to any other credit card Guest has on file in Guest’s Carnival.com account. Guest agrees to maintain in their Carnival.com account at least one valid credit card that expires no earlier than 20 days after the last payment due date.\n\n40.
