        "text": "\"Come Dream With Me\"\n\nOriginal dance-theater created by campers ages 9 & up and director/choreographer Taryn Noelle inspired from George Méliès - pioneering film-maker, illusionist, \"grandfather of science fiction\" and the inspiration for Martin Scorsese's 2011 blockbuster \"Hugo\".\n\nThe work of George Méliès is filled with an endless supply of magic & imagination.\n\nJoin us as we endeavor to create magic out of thin air ... or rather... with athletic adagio, contemporary modern dance, storytelling, and fantastical minimalist design!\n\n\"My friends, I address you all tonight as you truly are; wizards, mermaids, travelers, adventurers, magicians... Come and dream with me\"\n\nPerformances: Friday March 1st @ 5:30pm & Saturday March 2nd @ 11am\n\nanticipated run time: 30 minutes\n\n(This show was formerly entitled Man in the Moon)"
