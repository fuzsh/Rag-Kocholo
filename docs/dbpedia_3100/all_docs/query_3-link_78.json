        "text": "#10: “The World Is Not Enough” (1999)\n\nIf he’s true in what he says, then just what is enough for James Bond?? It may be one of the less memorable movies within the franchise, but this has to be one of Bond’s best comebacks! 007 isn’t exactly a stranger to the odd title-drop, although the words don’t always come directly from his mouth, but this one is delivered particularly well! As Elektra proves more dangerous than desirable, what better way to shut her up than with the Bond family mantra?? Brilliant! Yah, we know, this isn’t the first Bond film to make the title a catchphrase...\n\n#9: “Do the Right Thing” (1989)\n\nThere was a nice set-up to our first entry, but in “Do the Right Thing” we’re taken a little by surprise - in a good way! Mookie’s going about his daily pizza business when he’s pulled to the side by Da Mayor for a short and sweet heart-to-heart! The guy doesn’t have to say too much, because the little that he does say is heard loud enough! It’s worldly wisdom at its purest and best! You probably didn’t think that movie titles made good philosophies - until now!\n\n#8: “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” (2004)\n\nIn terms of words and syllables, this is the longest title to make our countdown! So burdensome was the potential for this poetic sentence it might’ve needed a crowbar to get it on the script - but instead it was built-in beautifully! Kirsten Dunst is blessed with an especially attractive accent, and as she recites a part of the Alexander Pope poem on which the title is based, the audience is treated to a tingle or two down their spine!\n\n#7: “The Aviator” (2004)\n\nA simpler title next, but an equally emotionally affective use of it within the film! Leonardo DiCaprio plays Howard Hughes in this Martin Scorsese movie, and in this particular scene things are starting to take a turn for the worse! Hughes was on top of the world before his fortunes quite literally plummeted... A plane crash over Beverly Hills creates a warzone like setting for DiCaprio to squeeze out his identity before being set upon by a photographer... It’s fame in all its fickleness!\n\n#6: “Pineapple Express” (2008)\n\nMost of us knew the premise of this movie before we took our seats in the cinema to see it, but not so many of us had a clue about the title reference. It wasn’t a big reveal, but when James Franco explains ‘Pineapple Express’ as an out of this world variety of weed, we feel about as satisfied as its smoker - which is very satisfied! The reproductive description of the drug that follows is enough to strike a craving in almost anybody! Smell-o-vision would’ve been good right about now!\n\n#5: “Brokeback Mountain” (2005)\n\nAnother emotionally charged entry as we ascend to top spot, as Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger try to make sense of their love within the very shadow of the place that has seen it! Brokeback Mountain would once have been thought of with fondness by Gyllenhaal’s character, Jack, but in this scene it only breeds frustration. The switch from it being everything that he and Ennis have, to ‘all that they’ve got’ is a heart-breaking turning point, and an expert title-drop!\n\n#4: “Hot Tub Time Machine” (2010)\n\nHere we have a line that almost every cinema-goer has heard, even if you haven’t seen the movie! The ‘hot tub time machine’ concept is so ambiguous an oxymoron that you only need to have seen the trailer for this film’s title to stick in your head! Craig Robinson delivers it perfectly, as he sums up the confusion felt by everyone else in the room, and becomes the ‘asshole’ that Clark Duke’s Jacob didn’t want to be! As ridiculous as it is, we’re with him 100%!\n\n#3: “Full Metal Jacket” (1987)\n\nPrivate Pyle may have lost his mind more than a little in our next scene, but he’s remembered to title-drop, and he does so spectacularly! Here, the soldier snaps and he takes his problems into the bathroom, as is typical in a Stanley Kubrick film! Perfectly drilled but drilled to insanity, he’s locking, loading and laying down the law! ‘Full metal jacket’ is just one of many memorable lines in this sequence, as we see the very whites of the guy’s eyes and Sergeant Hartman badmouths his last!\n\n#2: “Face/Off” (1997)\n\nSome of our title-drops are a singular event, but not this one! As John Travolta and Nicolas Cage run us all around in circles by trading one another’s faces, the call to end this madness is repeated a fair few times! Cage (or Travolta, depending on how you best understand the movie) wants out... He wants ‘off’! On the one hand, the title is muttered too many times to be natural, but on the other it’s an indication of the madness behind the mask! It’s almost full marks to “Face/Off”!\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\n- “Kill Bill: Vol. 2” (2004)\n\n- “The Departed” (2006)\n\n- “The Shining” (1980)\n\n- “This Is England” (2006)\n\n- “I’m Gonna Git You Sucka” (1988)\n\n#1: “Back to the Future” (1985)\n\nOur winner is a title scripted into its series on multiple occasions, with each utterance as satisfying as the one that preceded it! The concept of going ‘back to the future’ is so brilliantly just beyond our everyday understanding of time, that whenever Doc Brown says it out in the open, we can’t help but be thrilled! It’s one of the more dynamic movie titles, and it makes for some memorable moviemoments! It would top this podium in any temporal dimension – and as far as title-drops go, it’s exemplary!\n\nDo you agree with our list? Which movie title drop is your favorite?
