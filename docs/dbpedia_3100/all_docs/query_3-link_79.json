        "text": "Not exactly a name, but there does seem to be a trope for what you describe. I found Small Role, Big Impact on tvtropes.\n\nSmall Role, Big Impact is when a minor character (an \"Under-Five\" line player, as they used to say) who, through his or her actions or words, has an impact on the story far, far beyond what such a minor character ought to have normally.\n\nReading your comment to the other answer, I thought this might be an example of Stunt Casting\n\nHiring of a big-name actor to play a supporting role (or even a leading role, but usually the former). The idea is usually that the actor's fame will draw in viewers, as it normally would if you put them prominently on the advertising; but you don't have to pay them as much if they only have to do a few days' work.\n\nAlternatively, it could be considered Billing Displacement\n\nThe tendency of a film to be retroactively linked in the public mind with the biggest name in the film or be marketed as \"starring\" the biggest name, even if that actor is not the main character (at least from the filmmakers' point of view), and occasionally even if his or her character is very minor indeed.\n\nHowever, the two aren't mutually exclusive"
