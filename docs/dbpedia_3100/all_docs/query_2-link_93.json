He is the King of Ithaca, a hero of the Trojan War and a loving father and husband.\n\nOdysseus is trying to return home after ten years of war. His determination and cunning get him out of many dangerous situations but he also brings danger upon himself by angering the god Poseidon and failing to communicate properly with his men so they do not trust him.\n\nPenelope\n\nPenelope is the Queen of Ithaca and Odysseusâ wife. She is devoted to Odysseus and is waiting for his return. Penelope is under pressure to marry again and must use her intelligence to come up with reasons to delay choosing a new husband.\n\nTelemachus\n\nTelemachus is Odysseusâ son. He has grown into a young man without his father.\n\nPolites\n\nPolites is a close friend of Odysseus.\n\nEurylochus\n\nEurylochus is one of Odysseusâ men. He disobeys Odysseus more than once.\n\nZeus\n\nZeus is the ruler of the gods. He can throw thunderbolts to punish anyone who disobeys him.\n\nPoseidon\n\nPoseidon is the sea god. He is angry with Odysseus for blinding his son, the cyclops Polyphemus.\n\nAthene\n\nAthene is the goddess of war. She loves Odysseus and tries to help him.\n\nHelios\n\nHelios is the sun god. He is angry when Odysseusâ men kill one of his precious red-backed cattle.\n\nHades\n\nHades is the god of the dead and the Underworld.\n\nLotus-eaters: The lotus-eaters are people who feed the deadly lotus fruit to their visitors. The fruit is addictive, weakens their minds and makes them not want to leave the island.\n\nPolyphemus: Polyphemus is the son of Poseidon and a cyclops, which is a one-eyed giant. Odysseus and his men are captured by Polyphemus. To escape, they get him drunk, blind him with a sharpened stake and cling to the underside of his sheep.\n\n**King of Aeolia:**The King of Aeolia tries to help Odysseus by giving him a bag of winds to blow his ship home. When Eurylochus wonders what is in the bag and opens it, he sets all the winds free at the wrong moment and the ship is sent into further danger.\n\nKing Lamus of Laestrygonia: King Lamus of Laestrygonia is the king of giants who eats Odysseusâ men.\n\nCirce: Circe is a sorceress with the magical ability to turn men into pigs. She loves Odysseus and tries to help him.\n\nTeiresias: Teiresias is an Oracle, which means he can tells the future. He warns Odysseus not to kill or eat the sun godâs cattle.\n\nThe Sirens: The Sirens are women whose beautiful songs lure men to their deaths. Odysseus is so desperate to hear their songs that he plugs his menâs ears with beeswax and ties himself to the mast of his ship when they sail past them.\n\nScylla: Scylla is a six-headed monster who eats some of Odysseusâ men.\n\nCharybdis: Charybdis is a monstrous whirlpool that destroys boats and drowns sailors.\n\nCalypso: Calypso is a sea nymph who wants to marry Odysseus.
