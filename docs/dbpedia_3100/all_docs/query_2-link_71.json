        "text": "Le Voyage Dans la Lun (A Trip to the Moon) by Georges Méliès (1902)\n\nGeorge Melies's `A Trip to the Moon' welcomes a change in film making of the twentieth century. Combined with live action as well as models, the movie tells a story about astronauts who take a trip to the moon. The moon, having a human face captures the astronauts after they crash into its eye. They later escape the moon and it's moon-men and make it back to earth safely. Melies wrote, directed and starred in this movie. He used many important techniques in his films to make them successful. Not only did he develop editing skills and superimposed images, he also used double exposure to complete the magic behind his films. Still used today, Melies's special effects, small models, painted backgrounds, weird makeup and costumes were just some of the important things used in the movie `A Trip to the Moon.' - by uoi_chick\n\nTrivia: While on the moon, the astronomers watch the Earth rise over the horizon. To a person on the moon, the Earth never moves. It does not rise or set.\n\nCredits"
