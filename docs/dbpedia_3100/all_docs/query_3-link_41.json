        "text": "In this post of the Making an Animated Film series I’ll tell you why I’m changing the title of my film, the process I went through with name finding and my result.\n\nWhy the change?\n\nWhen I picked the name Geometry Exercise, I didn’t know much about my film.\n\nI came up with the idea of a cube and a ball in a geometrical world only because I wanted to have the simplest characters I could create, and get the most out of them. After establishing the basic idea for the story of a cube and a ball trying to move forward until reaching an obstacle (the hill), I thought Geometry Exercise was an appropriate name. It captured what the film was about for me at the time.\n\nHowever, while in production, the film developed depth. It was more than just about a ball and a cube trying to get somewhere. It was about the relationship between the two, about helping someone without expecting anything in return, about friendship, and so on. The name Geometry Exercise just didn’t seem relevant anymore. Plus, it was a bit complex and dry. I needed more emotion.\n\nFinding a new name\n\nNot an easy thing to do. I wanted something creative, but not corny. Cute but not too cute. I wanted something that reflected their journey of helping each other, and maybe incorporate the hill and going up a slope somehow. A good system to finding names is choosing an idea, and going to town on it as much as you can, and then moving on to another idea.\n\nFor example, lets say we want something with a square or a cube, since we have a cube as a character. I would just make a list like that:\n\nSquared Away\n\nSquared\n\nWe’re Square\n\nRectangled\n\nCubism\n\nRounding Corners\n\nSharp Edges\n\nThen I would focus on a different element, maybe the ball:\n\nBounce\n\nBounced\n\nBouncing\n\nIn the Ball Park\n\nRound and Round\n\nUp and Down\n\nRolling\n\nThen maybe something about the hill, or moving up:\n\nUp the Hill\n\nMoving Forward\n\nOver the Hill\n\nPath\n\nHill Side\n\nOver the Hump\n\nLift Up\n\nThen you pick the ones you liked:\n\nUp and Down\n\nMoving Forward\n\nRectangled (one of my favorites, but too complex)\n\nLifted (taken by a Pixar short)\n\nLift Up\n\nRounding Corners (again, a geometry joke. Irrelevant)\n\nBounce\n\nOver the Hill\n\nSquared Away\n\nCubism\n\nThe reason it’s a good system is that it lets you focus on a single idea and get the most out of it, instead of looking at a white canvas and trying to come up with something. It’s similar to the Restriction Method I wrote about in a previous article.\n\nSo I looked at the list. They were all cute, but with names, just like with love, when it’s right you just know it. And only one of them was right. All the other names I found either lacked emotion or were too emotional and cutetsy.\n\nAnd the winner is…\n\nReveled here for the first time, Bloop’s next animated short film – LIFT UP.\n\nThe name is good because it captures the emotional journey the characters go through, and the physical one as well. They both ‘lift’ each other up during that journey, and the double meaning of course is an emotional lift up (like cheering someone up). It’s short and sweet."
