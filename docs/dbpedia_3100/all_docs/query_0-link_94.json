        "text": "Impossible Journey is a film based on a true story, and each of the 3200 film frames is painted by hand, requiring nearly 40 artists, and 1500 hours of painting time.\n\nEach frame is meticulously crafted, with the backgrounds and environments rendered by the artists in vivid, brushstroke-laden detail.\n\nThe purpose of this film was about enacting real change. Our reliance on hand-painting was intentional, to take the film out of the digital space and into the real world. The issue becomes more real and tangible with each frame filled with the intentions of the artist who painted it.\n\n• In the US, Black women are 3X more likely to die from pregnancy-related issues.\n\n• 85% of those pregnancy related deaths could be preventable.\n\n• Black women face systemic discrimination in healthcare settings, including unequal access to appropriate healthcare, providers dismissing their concerns, lower-quality care, and biased treatment from healthcare providers.\n\nThe disparities in Black maternal health outcomes in the US can be attributed directly to racism. From historically experiencing a discriminatory system that deliberately prevents access to healthcare services, to direct racial biases exhibited by health workers toward Black women, the incidence of racism in medicine is well documented.\n\nThe Momnibus (Black Maternal Health) act has one final hurdle to becoming law. The US Senate can impact this crisis by signing into law the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act, which could potentially save the lives of Black mothers and babies. But tragically, it has sat without a vote for years.\n\nRacial disparities in maternal health care represent a major inequality that needs to be addressed by promoting justice and addressing systemic biases and discrimination in institutions like healthcare.\n\nIn the US, Black women are 3X more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than White women. The pregnancy journey of Black women has been marked by persistent challenges and systemic barriers, creating a nearly impossible journey for Black mothers seeking safe and equitable childbirth experiences. Aster, a maternal health company, teamed up with Ashé Birthing Services. They have joined forces to expand community-based maternal health programs and increase funding for pregnancy and doula programs. By promoting the Momnibus Act through the Impossible Journey film they can drive Congress to the changes necessary that could improve Black maternal health outcomes and potentially save lives.\n\nThe characters were created by a team of 40 women artists, predominantly Black mothers. Each one brought a unique detail to the final version of our characters.\n\nThe film was created with 3200 hand-painted frames. Each frame was carefully sketched, vectorized, digitally-painted, printed out, then, using acrylics and chalk, meticulously painted by hand. The hand-painting took over 1,500 hours.\n\nThe purpose of this film was about enacting real change and hand-painting the frames allowed each one to be filled with the intention of the artist who painted it. We selected 700 of the hand-painted frames to send as direct mail postcards to members of Congress during the 2024 Black Maternal Week. Each mailer was an invitation via QR code taking them to watch the film, hear personal stories, and read information about the Momnibus act.\n\nWith the 2500 frames remaining, our outreach will continue to OB/GYNs and maternal health influencers."
