In Ecuador, such events are accountable for\nnegatively impacting the economy, infrastructure, and population. Spatialâtemporal\ndynamics of precipitation anomalies from various types of extreme El\nNiÃ±o events are analyzed and compared. Results show that for eastern Pacific (EP) and coastal Pacific (COA) El NiÃ±o types, most precipitation extremes occur in the first half of the second year of the event. Any significant difference\nbetween events becomes more evident at this stage. Spatially, for any event, 50â% of all extreme anomalies occurred at elevations <â150âm. The difference between events was significant when considering the altitude when reaching 80â% of all extreme anomalies: the eastern Pacific (EP) El NiÃ±o from 1997/98 (EP98) at 500âm, the El NiÃ±o from January to April 2017 (COA17) at 800âm, and the EP El\nNiÃ±o from 1982/83 (EP83) at 1000âm. Nevertheless, in some sectors of the Andean Cordillera, the El NiÃ±oâSouthern\nOscillation (ENSO) signal could be detected at 3200â3900âm.

        "text": "El NiÃ±o is the positive (warm) phase of the El NiÃ±oâSouthern Oscillation (ENSO), characterized as a complex phenomenon of variable extent and intensity and contrasted impacts, from regional to global. It originates from the unusual warming of sea surface temperature (SST) from the center of the equatorial Pacific Ocean to the coasts of Peru and Ecuador, bringing anomalously heavy rainfall to this region (Gelati et al., 2014; Zambrano-Mera et al., 2018), and is associated with substantial socioeconomic impacts (Cai et al., 2020). Because of the different locations of maximum SST anomalies and associated atmospheric heating, El NiÃ±o events are classified as eastern Pacific (EP) and central Pacific (CP) warming events (Wang et al., 2016). Eastern Pacific El NiÃ±os tend to have a stronger effect than central Pacific El NiÃ±os, linked to the anomalous SST and convection (Cai et al., 2020). According to Cai et al. (2020), during an eastern Pacific El NiÃ±o, anomalously warm waters (+1.5â3.0ââC) are often observed adjacent to the equatorial South American Pacific coast. Through transferring heat from the ocean to the atmosphere, this anomalous warming elevates air temperatures in the coastal region, triggering localized atmospheric convection and heavy rainfall.\n\nBut, such atmosphericâoceanic coupling at the South American Pacific coast is not exclusive to eastern El NiÃ±o events. The coastal event is the least frequent type of El NiÃ±o event but has a proven capability of generating extreme precipitation in Ecuador and Peru (e.g., the coastal El NiÃ±o of 2017). This type of extreme event is very rare and, until 2017, only two coastal El NiÃ±os were previously reported in 1891 and 1925 (Takahashi and MartÃ­nez, 2017). While recent attention has been brought to the central Pacific and the eastern Pacific El NiÃ±o events, the coastal El NiÃ±o represents another facet of ENSO that requires further study (Takahashi et al., 2018a, b). The coastal El NiÃ±o of 2017 was an exceptional marine heat wave that did not last very long (only 3Â months) but exhibited SST anomalies higher than any other extreme El NiÃ±o event (+7ââC) (Pietri et al., 2021). Differently from the eastern Pacific El NiÃ±os, which are formed by the downwelling of equatorial Kelvin waves, the coastal El NiÃ±o of 2017 seemed to have been formed by a marine heat wave generated by a local decrease in the winds in the eastern Pacific, close to the coast of Ecuador and Peru (Echevin et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019).\n\nBefore 1972, and more specifically before 1982, the 20th century was dominated by rather mild El NiÃ±o events. Thus, El NiÃ±o was viewed as a regional phenomenon that interested mainly climate specialists. It was after learning from their devastating effects from the occurrence of two of the most extreme El NiÃ±o events in history (i.e., 1982/83 and 1997/98 events) that the term El NiÃ±o not only became familiar to the general public but also was seriously brought to the attention of governments and policymakers worldwide (Glantz, 2015; Hameed et al., 2018).\n\nExtreme El NiÃ±o events have a proven capacity not only to severely affect the local climate but also to have an impact at a global scale through oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections (Dewitte and Takahashi, 2019). Extreme El NiÃ±o events stand out not only for their powerful impacts but also for their significant differences from other El NiÃ±os (Hong et al., 2014; Hameed et al., 2018). Now, the main difficulty in the investigation of extreme El NiÃ±o dynamics has been related to the fact that, by definition, these occur rarely and very few have been observed comprehensively, and there is still not a clear picture of the extreme El NiÃ±o teleconnection complexity (Dewitte and Takahashi, 2019). In the satellite era, only three strong El NiÃ±o events (excluding the coastal type) have been observed (1982/83, 1997/98, and 2015/16). Nevertheless, and despite their limited number, extreme El NiÃ±o events may share some common features (Hong, 2016). Therefore, the group study of extreme El NiÃ±o provides an excellent starting point to understand the complexity of the El NiÃ±o phenomenon.\n\nWith a current population of around 18Â million and a continental surface of 248â540âkm2, Ecuador is located between 1.5ââN and â5.0ââS, comprising an important extension of both the tropical South American Pacific coast and the Amazon Basin. These two geographical regions are separated by the Andean Cordillera which crosses the country from north to south and constitutes a substantial topographic barrier (MorÃ¡n-Tejeda et al., 2016). Regarding the presence of the Andean mountain chain, this most certainly modifies the ENSO signal (Vuille et al., 2000; MorÃ¡n-Tejeda et al., 2016; Tobar and Wyseure, 2017; Quishpe-VÃ¡squez et al., 2019). However, there is no clear explanation of how far into the Andes the effects of ENSO are perceived (MorÃ¡n-Tejeda et al., 2016). Detailed basin-wide assessments of the influence of ENSO in the transition from the coastal plain toward the western Andean Cordillera are also very scarce (Pineda et al., 2013). Various studies have considered precipitation in Ecuador (Rossel et al., 1999; Bendix and Bendix, 2006; Buytaert et al., 2006) or have focused on precipitation in specific areas of the country (Mora and Willems, 2012; Thielen et al., 2015, 2016). In general, a strong connection between ENSO and precipitation in Ecuador has been found, but none of the previous studies analyzed stations throughout the entire country (MorÃ¡n-Tejeda et al., 2016). According to MorÃ¡n-Tejeda et al. (2016), a study of trends and variability in precipitation, based on up-to-date data for the entire country, is still lacking â a situation that is especially true when considering the different effects on spatial and temporal precipitation dynamics resulting from the occurrence of various types of extreme El NiÃ±o events (Thielen et al., 2021a).\n\nIn Ecuador, historical extreme El NiÃ±o events are accountable for generating very important, direct or indirect, negative effects on the economy, infrastructure, and population (OPS and OMS, 1999). Most economic costs are related to losses of agricultural production and damages to infrastructure (USDâ640.6Â million in 1982/83 and USDâ2882Â million in 1997/98). Around 60â% of the population of Ecuador may have their living conditions altered, directly or indirectly, by the occurrence of an extreme El NiÃ±o event. They have been responsible for generating major migratory waves (CEPAL, 1998). For instance, over 1 million Ecuadorians fled the country after Ecuador's economy was impacted due to El NiÃ±o in 1972/73 and 1982/83 (BernabÃ© et al., 2014), as well as in 1997/98 (OPS, 2000). Extreme El NiÃ±o events in Ecuador have also been accountable for important epidemics of diverse vector-transmitted and infectious diseases such as cholera, leptospirosis, dengue, chikungunya, zika, malaria, etc. (Gabastou et al., 2002; World Bank Group, 2011).\n\nNow, in response to greenhouse warming, extreme El NiÃ±o events are projected to double their occurrence, while a less pronounced increase is projected for moderate El NiÃ±o events (Gulizia and Pirotte, 2022; Cai et al., 2014). Likewise, climate model projections also indicate an increase in the frequency of extreme coastal El NiÃ±o (Peng et al., 2019). Of course, these impacts on climate extremes as well as the associated socioeconomic impacts would also take place much more frequently (Gulizia and Pirotte, 2022; LÃ³pez et al., 2022).\n\nTaking into account the implications for Ecuador of such a forecast, the main objective of the present study was to analyze and compare, based on up-to-date data for the entire insular and continental territory, the dynamics of precipitation anomalies resulting from the various types of extreme El NiÃ±o events, including the coastal El NiÃ±o. The results were discussed regarding the spatial and temporal variability generated by the topographic gradients of the dorsal of the Andes at both the Pacific slope and the Amazon slope, as well as in terms of their principal basins or hydrological systems. The results provide solid and opportune evidence that can be used at different decision-making levels for identifying, in the context of global climate change scenarios, the most appropriate practices for reducing vulnerability and risks from a potential increase in extreme El NiÃ±o frequency and intensity.\n\n2.1âStudy area\n\nThe study area was defined as the totality of the continental and insular (offshore) territory of Ecuador. As for the continental territory, this was first divided into two main and distinctive zones: the Pacific slope (116â592âkm2) and the Amazon slope (131â948âkm2). Delineation of these zones was defined by the dorsal of the Andes, a dominant orographic barrier determining if runoff from rainfall is to be drained to the Pacific shore or the Amazon Basin. Following the CNRHÂ (2002) classification system, each of these two continental zones was further divided into hydrographic systems or basins regarding their climate and spatial homogeneity. Through GIS applications, data from HydroSHEDS (https://www.hydrosheds.org/, last access: 20Â April 2023) were used to delineate each basin. This resulted in 23 hydrographic systems for the Pacific slope and 7 for the Amazon slope (see Fig.Â 1). Finally, regarding the insular territory, a unique hydrographic system was established encompassing all offshore islands, specifically the Galapagos Islands (8233âkm2).\n\n2.2âData\n\nPrecipitation data were obtained from the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS V2.0, https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps/, last access: 19Â April 2023). CHIRPS V2.0 is a quasi-global gridded rainfall time series dataset spanning 50ââSâ50ââN from 1981 to the near present, with 0.05â resolution satellite imagery, in situ station data, and great applications for monitoring precipitation extremes (Funk et al., 2015). Precipitation layers derived from interpolations of data from climate gauge networks have proven to have some limitations (Deblauwe et al., 2016). CHIRPSÂ V2.0 provides reliable precipitation observations with high accuracy and is particularly suitable for areas with few rainfall gauges (Paredes-Trejo et al., 2016; Beck et al., 2017), especially over montane (LÃ³pez-Bermeo et al., 2022) or arid regions (Paredes-Trejo et al., 2017; Ramoni-Perazzi et al., 2021) where extreme events may be rather common. According to Beck et al.Â (2017), in a global-scale evaluation of 23 precipitation datasets, CHIRPS V2.0 tends to perform the best in the hydrological modeling of tropical regions, specifically in Central and South America. As for Ecuador, Thielen et al.Â (2021a) successfully tested its applicability in the spatialâtemporal analysis of hydroclimatological extreme events in one of the most important and extended basins of the Ecuadorian Pacific slope. For the present study, monthly data for the time series January 1981/December 2018 were obtained from 456 rasters. Monthly and annual mean, as well as some other basic precipitation parameters, were obtained through GIS applications.\n\n2.3âCalculation of the Standardized Pluviometric Drought Index â SPDI\n\nIn this study, the precipitation spatialâtemporal dynamics were analyzed by the Standardized Pluviometric Drought Index (SPDI) developed by PitaÂ (2001). The SPDI is a monthly rainfall index that is based on the calculation of cumulative monthly rainfall anomalies, similar to the well-known Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) of McKee et al.Â (1993), more specifically, the 12-month SPI. As in this index, values ranging from +1 to +1.5 and +1.5 to +2.0 are associated with moderately humid and very humid episodes, respectively, and values exceeding +2 are representative of extremely humid episodes. Moderately dry, very dry, and extremely dry spells are characterized by the same ranges with a negative sign (see TableÂ 1). One of the main advantages of using the SPDI is that it reflects precisely the beginning and end of each extreme precipitation event and gives continuous information about its duration and intensity (Sanchez-Toribio et al., 2010). This ability makes it particularly suitable for characterizing long-lasting extreme events such as ENSO. Differently than the SPI, the SPDI does not require its application at multiple timescales to reflect the different durations of extreme events (PeÃ±a-Gallardo et al., 2016). The SPDI curves sometimes explain wet and dry periods not indicated by the SPI curves (Mega and Medjerab, 2021). The SPDI is calculated as follows:\n\nFirst stage, Eq.Â (1)\n\n(1) AP i = P i - P MED ,\n\nwhere APi is the monthly precipitation anomaly, Pi is the monthly precipitation, and PMED is the median precipitation of the month for the series. As for this study, the series is 1981â2010.\n\nSecond stage, Eq.Â (2).\n\n(2) APA i = â AP i from i = negative AP to i = positive AP ,\n\nwhere APAi is the accumulated precipitation anomaly of the month.\n\nThird stage, Eq.Â (3).\n\n(3) SPDI = APA i - APA â¾ / Ï APA ,\n\nwhere APAâ¾ is the average value of accumulated precipitation anomalies of all the months of the series, and ÏAPA is the standard deviation of accumulated precipitation anomalies of all the months of the series.\n\nIn short, the first stage estimates the rainfall anomaly for each of the months of the series. The second stage allows us to identify and calculate the accumulated rainfall anomalies from the first month in which there is a (positive or negative) rainfall anomaly until â as a result of the accumulations â an opposite accumulated anomaly is detected. Finally, in the third phase, these accumulated anomalies were standardized by converting them into zÂ scores. Such standardization allows for obtaining universally valid and comparable values for different precipitation indexes, such as the SPI.\n\nGIS applications allowed us to apply these equations to the 456 aforementioned CHIRPSÂ V2.0 rasters and to generate SPDI products such as images of 0.05â resolution or monthly zonal values and at different space and/or time criteria. In the present study, monthly values of SPDI were estimated, based on the 1981â2010 climatology, for the three main zones: the Pacific slope, Galapagos, and Amazon slope, as well as for each of the 30 continental hydrological systems (see Fig.Â 1). Analysis of monthly SPDI dynamics was performed in the 2-year series comprising each extreme El NiÃ±o event. The significance of the statistical difference between monthly precipitation and/or SPDI values for any pair of extreme events, in each of the three zones, was identified by two-tailed paired t tests and an Î±=0.05, while similarities in the spatialâtemporal dynamics of SPDI between the 30 hydrological systems were identified through cluster analysis (K-means clustering using Euclidean distance). Gong and RichmanÂ (1995) noted that nonhierarchical methods, such as the K-means algorithm, outperformed hierarchical methods (Ward's and the average linkage methods) when tested with precipitation data, as well as with SPI series (Santos et al., 2010).\n\n2.4âAltitudinal dynamics of SPDI\n\nAs for continental Ecuador and through geoprocessing tools available from GIS software, results from SPDI estimations for each extreme El NiÃ±o event were combined with rasterized altitude data obtained from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 1Â Arc-Second Global (approx. 30âm resolution and freely available at https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/, last access: 19Â April 2023) and then resampled at CHIRPS resolution (i.e., 0.05â). The frequency of pixels with SPDIââ¥â2.0 was determined along the entire altitudinal gradient for both the Pacific and the Amazon slope and for each extreme El NiÃ±o event. The significance of the statistical differences between any pair of such SPDI spatial dynamics was identified by two-tailed paired t tests and an Î±=0.05.\n\n2.5âSeasonality index (SIâ¾)\n\nThe seasonality of precipitation in continental Ecuador was estimated by the Seasonality Index (SIâ¾ ) (Walsh and Lawler, 1981), which quantifies the variability in monthly precipitation throughout the year. It is estimated by the sum of the absolute deviations of mean monthly precipitation from the overall monthly mean divided by the mean annual precipitation, as shown in Eq.Â (4):\n\n(4) SI â¾ = 1 R â¾ â N = 1 n = 12 x â¾ n - R â¾ / 12 ,\n\nwhere xâ¾n is the mean precipitation of month n, and Râ¾ is the mean annual rainfall. The SIâ¾ can vary from 0 (if all months have equal precipitation amounts) to 1.83 (if all the rainfall occurs in a single month). Thus, the higher the SIâ¾ , the more seasonal or concentrated the precipitation is. The relationship between the resulting seasonality index and the anomalies of precipitation (as SPDI) was evaluated at a basin level.\n\n2.6âDefinitions of extreme El NiÃ±o events: the mega El NiÃ±o and the coastal El NiÃ±o\n\nThe Oceanic NiÃ±o Index (ONI) is NOAA's primary indicator for monitoring ENSO. It is based on the monitoring of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the central Pacific Ocean and is used to identify the onset of an above-average SST threshold that persists for several months, encompassing both the beginning and end of an El NiÃ±o episode (Glantz and Ramirez, 2020). The ONI tracks the running 3-month average SSTs in the east-central tropical Pacific (5ââSâ5ââN, 120â170ââW), specifically in the NiÃ±oÂ 3.4 region. El NiÃ±o occurs when the anomalies exceed +0.5ââC for at least 5 consecutive months. The threshold is further broken down into weak (with a +0.5 to +0.9 SST anomaly), moderate (+1.0 to +1.4), strong (+1.5 to +1.9), and very Strong (â¥â2.0) events. As for very strong or mega-El NiÃ±o events, the SST anomalies may be +2.0ââC for several months (Chen et al., 2017). According to these parameters, three mega-El NiÃ±o events were identified since 1951: 1982/83, with a mean ONI from October 1982 to February 1983 of 2.09ââC; 1997/98, with a mean ONI from September 1997 to February 1998 of 2.20ââC; and 2015/16, with a mean ONI from October 2015 to February 2016 of 2.22ââC. (data source http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/oni.ascii.txt, last access: 19Â April 2023). Additionally, regarding where the SST anomalies peak, El NiÃ±o events can be classified as eastern Pacific (EP), involving the easterly NiÃ±oÂ 1+2 region, and as central Pacific (CP), mainly NiÃ±oÂ 3.4 (Larkin and Harrison, 2005; Ashok et al., 2007; Kug et al., 2009). Although all aforementioned mega-El NiÃ±o events have been EP El NiÃ±o events, the 2015/16 event should be considered a mixed regime of both EP and CP El NiÃ±o (Santoso et al., 2017; L'heureux et al., 2017; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020), mainly due to an erratic response of SST peaking (Xie and Fang, 2019). As for the present study, the three mega-El NiÃ±o events are referred to as follows: EP83, for the EP El NiÃ±o event from 1982/83; EP98, for the EP El NiÃ±o from 1997/98; and MIX16, for the mixed CP/EP El NiÃ±o event from 2015/16.\n\nBesides tropical Pacific El NiÃ±o events (EP or CP), the study area is also affected by a more local type of El NiÃ±o event: the coastal El NiÃ±o, a very rare and unique event which develops differently from either CP or EP El NiÃ±o events. To distinguish the coastal El NiÃ±o from the warm ENSO phase, ENFENÂ (2012) operationally defines the coastal El NiÃ±o based on the seasonal NiÃ±o 1+2 SST anomaly as having a 3-month-running mean NiÃ±o 1+2 SST above 0.4ââC for 3 or more consecutive months. A strong coastal El NiÃ±o developed off the coast of Peru from January to April 2017 (ENFEN, 2017; WMO, 2017a, b; Takahashi and MartÃ­nez, 2017; RamÃ­rez and Briones, 2017; Garreaud, 2018) (hereafter COA17) and has been the strongest on record, and it developed rather fast and unexpectedly from the warming of SST specific to the far eastern tropical Pacific.\n\nIn this study, the application of the SPDI was most appropriate when analyzing and comparing temporal and spatial dynamics of precipitation extremes among different extreme El NiÃ±o events. Likewise, CHIRPSÂ V2.0 was confirmed to be a valuable source of monthly precipitation data for monitoring extreme events and contributed to the understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of monthly rainfall in Ecuador, as demonstrated for other extended South American regions (Paredes-Trejo et al., 2016; Baez-Villanueva et al., 2018; Rivera et al., 2019; Thielen et al., 2020, 2021b).\n\nFor any of the considered regions (the Pacific slope, Galapagos, and Amazon slope) and for any of the extreme El NiÃ±o events, EP83, EP98, MIX16, and COA17, precipitation during the first year (YearÂ 1: 1982, 1997, 2015, and 2016, correspondingly) was not significantly different from that of the historical annual mean (series 1981â2010) (Fig.Â 2). On the other hand, for both the Pacific slope and the Galapagos, it is during the second year of EP83, EP98, and COA17 (YearÂ 2: 1983, 1998, and 2017, correspondingly), and more specifically during the first half of these years, coincidentally encompassing the rainy season, when most precipitation extremes occur. According to Cai et al.Â (2020), the rainfall impacts on the coast of Ecuador and Peru occur mainly in the rainy months of February, March, and April when regional SSTs are seasonally at their highest, and the threshold for deep convection is more likely to be reached. As for YearÂ 2 of MIX16 (2016), there was no evidence of any significant precipitation anomaly generated on Ecuadorian territory by the occurrences of the mixed (EPâCP) type of extreme El NiÃ±o.\n\nRegarding overall SPDI dynamics (series 1981â2020) at both the Pacific slope and the Galapagos, 85.7â% of the months showed any degree of positive precipitation anomaly (SPDIâ>â1.0), and 100â% of the months showed an extremely wet condition (SPDIââ¥â2.0), which were associated with YearÂ 2 of an extreme El NiÃ±o event (Fig.Â 2). Such extreme rainfall conditions were concomitant, with a lag of 0 months, to the presence of warm SST temperatures in the easternmost NiÃ±o region (i.e., NiÃ±oÂ 1+2) and for both the EP El NiÃ±os (Thielen et al., 2015; de Guenni et al., 2017; MorÃ¡n-Tejeda et al., 2016; Quishpe-VÃ¡squez et al., 2019) and the coastal El NiÃ±o (Thielen et al., 2021a; Rollenbeck et al., 2022). Through transferring heat from the ocean to the atmosphere, this anomalous warming elevates air temperatures in the coastal region, triggering localized atmospheric convection and heavy rainfall (Cai et al., 2020). Based on SSTs at NiÃ±oÂ 1+2 dynamics, Thielen et al.Â (2016) predicted that precipitation anomalies in the Ecuadorian coast generated by the mixed-type El NiÃ±o of 2015/16 would not be as significant as those from the El NiÃ±os of 1982/83 and 1997/98, a forecast that was fully corroborated in the present research. This lack of response in coastal and insular precipitation is most certainly true for CP El NiÃ±o events, as well as for the mixed (EPâCP) El NiÃ±o type, such as MIX16. As for the Amazon slope, even though the number of months showing any degree of positive precipitation anomaly (SPDIâ>â1.0) was double that of the coastal and insular zones, less than 4â% of the months occurred during an extreme El NiÃ±o event, from which none reached the extremely wet condition (SPDIââ¥â2.0). According to Kiefer and KaramperidouÂ (2019), during EP and COA warm events, the coastal region is prone to extreme precipitation associated with convective bursts originating from the Pacific, while during a warm CP El NiÃ±o, as well as during a cold La NiÃ±a, moisture originates from the Atlantic and may reach the area as broader-scale less-intense precipitation.\n\nAt the Pacific slope, there are no significant differences (pâ>â0.05) in SPDI values resulting from EP83 and EP98 when considered on annual bases. For both of these eastern Pacific mega-El NiÃ±o events, precipitation anomalies lasted 10Â months, reaching mean SPDI values of 2.09 for 1983 and 2.39 for 1998 (TablesÂ 2 and 3). Differences between these two events become extremely significant when comparing the first 6Â months, precipitation anomalies during EP98 occurred sooner and reached faster maximum SPDI values during the first 6Â months of 1998 than during 1983, or any other extreme El NiÃ±o event. SPDI dynamics for the first 6 months of YearÂ 2 between EP83 and COA17 tended to be similar (pâ>â0.01) (TablesÂ 2 and 3).\n\nRegarding how far the extreme El NiÃ±o events' influence extends in the Pacific slope, the present study identified three of the most relevant facts:\n\nFor any extreme El NiÃ±o event, over 50â% of all extreme anomalies occurred at elevations under 150âm (Fig.Â 4). This represents over 40â% of the Ecuadorian coastal surface and involves the most strategic zone for Ecuador, since it comprises almost all lowland agriculture and aquaculture, which after petroleum oil production represent the main activities generating export products. This zone also holds, besides a high density of rural population as well as numerous small- to medium-sized towns, the largest city in Ecuador: Guayaquil, with a little more than 2.5Â million inhabitants.\n\nThe difference between extreme El NiÃ±o events was more significant (pâ<â0.05) when considering how far into the Andes the precipitation anomalies are perceived. For instance, during the long-lasting EP98, 80â% of all extreme anomalies (SPDIââ¥â2.0) occurred at elevations up to 500âm, while for the relatively less-lasting extreme events, such as COA17 and EP83, this value was reached at altitudes much higher: at 800âm and 1000âm, respectively (Fig.Â 4).\n\nThe difference between the three extreme El NiÃ±o events disappears at around 3000âmâa.s.l. when reaching the accumulation of 97â% of all extreme anomalies (SPDIââ¥â2.0). At an altitude of 4000âm, all extreme El NiÃ±o events reach the mean (series 1981â2010), which is a little before all reach 100â% at the maximum height of 4300âmâa.s.l. (Fig.Â 4).\n\nSeveral authors have also investigated the ENSO influence extends inside continental Ecuador. Bendix and BendixÂ (2006) and Kiefer and KaramperidouÂ (2019), for instance, showed that positive rainfall anomalies during ENSO mainly affect the coastal plain of Ecuador to the western slope of the Andes at altitudes <â1800âm, while Pineda et al.Â (2013) observed ENSO signals at locations as high as 2700âm. Regarding the presence of ENSO signals at high altitudes in the Pacific slope, relief plays a twofold role in the control of oceanâatmospheric forcing: it can modulate the atmospheric circulation, leading to a dissipation of the signal, or it can favor meteorological processes, leading to an enhancement of orographic precipitation (Pineda et al., 2013). There is no easy answer to the difference between the results from such studies regarding how far the extreme El NiÃ±o events' influence extends on the Pacific slope.\n\nPreexisting studies have limited their analysis to specific areas of Ecuador or may have confronted severe data limitations due to discontinuities in space and in time. Such limitations were overcome in the present study. FigureÂ 5 is the spatial representation, for the entire territory of Ecuador, of the mean annual (YearÂ 2) precipitation anomalies (as SPDI) generated by the most important extreme El NiÃ±o events since 1981, that is the mega El NiÃ±os EP83 and EP98 and the coastal El NiÃ±o COA17. From this figure, it is evident that the ENSO signal is variable not only along the lowlands of the Pacific slope but also along the highlands and the dorsal of the Andes. From north to south, the first half of the 1030âkm of the dominant orographic barrier of the dorsal of the Andes does not show any effect or signal from ENSO â that is, no precipitation anomalies are generated by extreme El NiÃ±o events at the highest sections of the hydrographic systems Mira, Esmeraldas, and part of Guayas. From this point on, and for 320âkm along the dorsal of the Andes, the highest sections of the systems Guayas, CaÃ±ar, Naranjal Pagua, and Jubones showed moderate to high precipitation anomalies (SPDIÂ 1.0â1.5) during an extreme El NiÃ±o event. But then again, in the last 165âkm of the dorsal of the Andes, which corresponds to the highest sections of the southernmost hydrographic system, CHIRA, any ENSO signal disappeared. At this point, there is no clear pattern regarding extreme El NiÃ±o events and the generation of precipitation anomalies in the highest sections of the Andean Cordillera. In any case, the ENSO signal was observed at mean altitudes ranging from 3200 to 3900âm. Other physical determinants such as the distance to the coastline and the steepness of the Cordillera may play an important role in determining the degree of the ENSO signal. Coincidentally, the aforementioned 320âkm transect that did reach precipitation anomalies was located at a distance from the seashore of 120âkm or less, also showing a dominant steep relief (Figs.Â 1 and 5).\n\nNow, from the results of the spatialâtemporal analysis of precipitation dynamics it is evident that the degree of seasonality also conditions the magnitude of the ENSO signal in the entire continental Ecuador. FigureÂ 6, for instance, shows that it is in the most extremely seasonal regions (SIâ¾ Â 1.0â1.2) where precipitation anomalies are the strongest, while regions with low or no seasonality (SIâ¾ Â 0.0â0.6) show no precipitation anomaly during the event of an extreme El NiÃ±o. According to CarrÃ©ric et al.Â (2019), the strong EP El NiÃ±o event peak in boreal winter is extended by 2 months, which results in significantly more events peaking in FebruaryâMarchâApril, the season when the climatological intertropical convergence zone is at its southernmost location. The Pacific slope shows strong seasonality, while the Amazon slope exhibits mild to no seasonality and the Sierra a moderate seasonality (Tobar and Wyseure, 2017).\n\nFrom Figs.Â 5 and 6 a list of the most vulnerable hydrographic systems regarding affectation in the event of an extreme El NiÃ±o becomes easily identifiable. Besides the insular system of the Galapagos, the other 13 are continental systems from the Pacific slope that show the highest seasonality in their precipitation: Arenillas (SPDIÂ 2.47 and SIâ¾ Â 1.18), Jama (2.31 and 1.19), Santa Rosa (2.31 and 1.11), Chone (2.25 and 1.23), Zapotal (2.23 and 1.33), Naranjal Pagua (2.22 and 1.10), Isla PunÃ¡ (2.22 and 1.27), Jipijapa (2.19 and 1.27), Zarumilla (2.17 and 1.19), Puyango (2.16 and 1.19), Portoviejo (2.11 and 1.29), Taura (2.09 and 1.29), and Guayas (1.87 and 1.15).\n\nAshok, K., Behera, S.
