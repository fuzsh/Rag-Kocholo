        "text": "Are you planning on visiting the Azores in January and wondering if it is the right time to come? If the weather in the Azores in January is worth it? Well, there is no wrong season to explore our 9 beautiful islands. The Azores are an amazing destination all year round with each season offering a unique atmosphere and natural beauty.\n\nEvery month is a great time to come to our lost paradise. The Azores are temperate yet unpredictable. It never gets too cold and the weather is constantly changing. We say that we have the four seasons in one day and that is 100% true. It can be rainy, hot, windy, and sunny on the same day.\n\nIn this article, we will tell you everything about the Azores islands in January. From what to do to what to pack. Also, we will provide a detailed description of the weather in January in the Azores. So, keep reading!\n\nHow is the weather in January in the Azores\n\nAlthough we have our famous anticyclone (high-pressure area) to ensure nice weather in Western Europe and the Mediterranean, we don’t always have a big bright sun. January is the wettest month of the year, but not the coldest (February). It is usually a bit cool although temperatures in our archipelago never drop too low. The wind can also be quite strong in January, but the usual storm period is between October and December.\n\nIt is estimated that in January there are between 16 and 19 precipitation days for an average of 135 mm rainfall.\n\nAlso, note that western islands (Flores and Corvo) get more rain and severe wind than central and eastern islands.\n\nNow that we have said that, don’t worry, there are still some good days and when it rains, it doesn’t last all day usually. There are only 7mm of rain expected to fall on each of the rainy days, which means that the rain never lasts for too long. January is rainier than springtime, but late fall is also very rainy. On average we have 5 hours of sunshine in January, which is better than December.\n\nAbout clouds and wind, the median cloud cover for January is 41%. The speed of the wind can vary from 17km/h up to 24km/h. It is quite moderate compared to late fall.\n\nAir Temperatures\n\nIn the Azores, we are blessed with a mild climate. This means that it is never too hot and never too cold. Because the Azores are in the middle of the ocean, we don’t really get heat or cold waves. Our subtropical oceanic climate makes the Azores the perfect getaway from the grey and cold days on the American and European continents.\n\nUnlike the European continent where temperatures can be negative, our temperatures never really go down. The average in January is 14ºC (57ºF). The highest temperature for January is 16ºC (61ºF) and the lowest is 11ºC (52ºF). In January of 1989, temperatures in the Azores reached 20ºC (68ºF), a high record for this part of the world.\n\nIt can get a bit chillier at night but it never frosts or snows, unless on top of Pico Mountain, the highest peak of Portugal located on Pico island.\n\nThe Azores are a region with high humidity. In January, the average level of humidity is 82%. This is higher than the rest of the year although our islands are humid in general all year round.\n\nWater temperatures\n\nIt is possible to swim in the beautiful Atlantic Ocean at all times in the Azores if the weather allows it. Ocean temperatures in January are about 17ºC (63ºF). It is the coolest sea temperature of the year and it only warms up in May. You can still go for a swim if the waves are kind. Preferably use a wetsuit but many people go every day to the swimming pool in a normal swimsuit.\n\nThe wind of January can be great for surfing, windsurfing, sailing, and many aquatic sports. On calm days, you can even enjoy snorkeling or spearfishing in the clear coastal waters.\n\nSunrise and Sunset Times\n\nJanuary is one of the darkest months with fewer hours of daylight, like in other northern hemisphere countries.\n\nThe shortest day of January is on the 1st as the sun rises at 7:59 am and sets at 5:34 pm, offering 9 hours and 35 minutes of daylight.\n\nOn the other hand, the longest day of the month is on the 31st with the sun rising at 7:49 am and setting at 6:04 pm, for 10 hours and 15 minutes of daylight. So the day is gradually getting 40 minutes longer throughout January.\n\nThe best spot to watch the sunrise in São Miguel island is the viewpoint of Ponta da Madrugada in Nordeste. On the other hand, for sunset lovers, go to Mosteiros and have a barbecue on the several picnic areas equipped with grills, while the sun is disappearing.\n\nAlthough you only have about 10 hours of daylight, at night there are plenty of things to do like going to the hot springs or enjoying a drink in the city center of Ponta Delgada.\n\nNature in the Azores in January\n\nWhile São Miguel is called the green island, all islands are pretty green, and this is mostly due to our weather. Indeed, without rain, the vegetation and landscapes wouldn’t be so beautifully bright. It is estimated that in the Azores, it rains 188 days of the year.\n\nFlowers are also quite impressive as there are always some colors in our nature every month of the year. Flowers are so abundant that the island of Flores (‘flowers’) was named this way due to those natural beauties growing all over.\n\nIn January in the Azores, trails can be a bit wet and mud can appear on dirt paths. It is necessary to be careful while going on an adventure outdoors. But January is also a great month to see and photograph rainbows. They are all over the place!\n\nDid you know that on São Miguel island we grow pineapples? You can visit the plantations all year round.

The sun can make you feel warm, especially if you are walking, so it is essential to have other clothes underneath your jacket to adapt to the temperature difference.\n\nThe perfect combination is a t-shirt, a polar sweater, and a rain jacket.\n\nIf you are planning on hiking and discovering the islands on foot, then a pair of good waterproof hiking shoes is a must-have. Pants are preferable over shorts for visiting the Azores in January. It can get colder in altitude and on the coast with more wind than inland. But don’t forget your bathing suit for the hot springs!

It all depends on your idea of a holiday and your plans. Each season is special and offers advantages.\n\nFor instance, if you want to spend your days getting tanned on the beach and natural swimming pools, then summer is the best season. If your dream is to see the biggest whales in the world in their natural habitat, then your best chance is to come during the springtime, from March to June. But if you want to enjoy the hot springs fully, then the wintertime is just perfect to relax in hot waters. To avoid the crowd but still have a nice temperature, fall is a great time to come to the Azores.\n\nThere are no big temperature differences during the year (average monthly temperatures only vary 8.1ºC/14.6ºF). The average temperature all year round is 17ºC (63ºF).\n\nSo, let’s see each season in detail so that you can choose your best season to come to the Azores.\n\nHolidays in the Azores Islands in January, February & March (Winter Season)\n\nThe biggest advantage of visiting the Azores during the wintertime is that it is not crowded. It is the least busy time of the year and you can often have touristy places just for yourself.\n\nPrices for accommodations off-season are lower and you can easily find good deals. On average for January 2019, Airbnb accommodations in São Miguel island were about 50 euros a night, although you can find cheaper ones like local accommodations for about 30 euros a night. A luxurious hotel room would be around 100 euros a night in January. If you are on a budget, hostels are a great option. There are also more choices because of the lower demand.\n\nIt is not necessary to book in advance but it is still recommended for activities and restaurants.\n\nAlso, winter is the time for Carnival, a happy time of the year with dancing, singing, and celebrating all dressed up in the streets.\n\nOther months might be warmer and sunnier but January is a great time for tight budgets but also for last-minute getaways. Plus, the perfect time to relax in hot springs is definitely the wintertime.\n\nHolidays in the Azores Islands in April, May & June (Spring Season)\n\nSpringtime gives the islands mild and pleasant weather. Flowers start to bloom and color the sides of the roads. The biggest religious festival in the Azores – Santo Cristo – takes place at the end of May. This is a time when Azoreans from all islands, as well as many travelers from around the globe, come together in São Miguel and celebrate.\n\nAlso, Spring is the best time to see the biggest whales in the world such as blue whales, fin whales, and sei whales as they pass by our archipelago during their annual migration. From March to June, there are usually the greatest chances to see those sea giants, although we see whales all year round.\n\nJune can already be very warm in terms of temperatures and there are more and more people on the beach. Hortensias start to bloom, turning all landscapes blue.\n\nHolidays in the Azores Islands in July, August & September (Summer Season)\n\nFrom June to September, it is the sunniest and warmest time of the year. Visiting the Azores during the summertime means the highest chances of good weather. But during summer, there are more travelers on the islands. Popular spots can get a bit crowded so if you wish to visit the famous landscapes of the Azores during summertime, keep in mind that you will probably not be alone there. July and August are the busiest months.\n\nJune and September are not so crowded as July and August, and it is still nice in terms of temperatures to enjoy outdoor adventures.\n\nAlso, due to the high humidity in our islands, temperatures can feel hotter. August is actually the warmest month (22ºC/72ºF). However, temperatures are still lower than in most countries on the European continent.\n\nThe heat can make it hard to enjoy the hot springs. But the beach is the place to be on hot days. Water temperatures are about 22ºC (72ºF) in July and 23ºC (73ºF) in August and September. It is the perfect temperature to swim in the Atlantic heated by the Gulf Stream.\n\n👉 Post related Best Beaches in the Azores Islands.
