The Mauritius Meteorological Services (MMS) has mentioned about it since this morning. But, the Weather Bulletin states the following:\n\n{{{Supplementary Information:\n\nDuring the day, observations indicate that the tropical disturbance to the North-East of the Mascarenes islands is weakening gradually.\n\nIt is not influencing weather over the region. However, its evolution is being monitored closely.}}}\n\nHowever, Observations from the Ground of Mauritius indicate that Rains and a Cyclonic System is approaching Rodrigues, Mauritius and Reunion Islands. Refer to the pictures. The Temperature felt in Mauritius during the last ten days varies between 32 and 36 0 Celsius. The whole population is experiencing a very uncomfortable and unprecedented state. Drought Spells have also influenced the Weather since November, the beginning of the Summer Season 2019-2020. Water shortage was also felt throughout the Island. Fortunately showers were also seen on Thursday 21 November with 41mm as maximum; with 77 mm on Sunday 24 November; with a maximum of 38 mm on Wednesday 27 November and 54.8 mm on 17 December.\n\nBesides, the System is evolving in an environment of 27-290 Celsius Sea Surface Temperature. Humidity is on the High side: 60-74% as at date and Wind, helped by the Anti-Cyclone, is blowing at about 22 to 35 k/ph.\n\nThe MMS has released its Supplementary information and Current Storm/Cyclone this afternoon:\n\n{{{Supplementary Information:\n\nDuring the day, observations indicate that the tropical disturbance to the North-East of the Mascarenes islands is weakening gradually.\n\nIt is not influencing weather over the region. However, its evolution is being monitored closely.}}}\n\n{{{Movement: General West South Westerly 10 km/h…\n\nThe Tropical Disturbance is evolving in an unfavorable environment for further intensification.\n\nHowever, its evolution is being monitored closely.}}}\n\nRemarks.\n\nIt is absolutely ridiculous that the MMS continues to state that the System “is not influencing weather over the region”. Such statements are contrary to the principles of the Early Warning Systems (EWS). Cyclones do not only mean leaves and trees falling. The Forecasters forget that the Ocean should right now be generating high waves around the Tropical Disturbance. The Surface Winds are estimated at 27 to 32 Knots (57 km/h), according to JTWC. So, the fisheries section and maritime traffic are at risks, apart from the Aviation Department.\n\nKeep watch for updates.\n\nPKANHYE. 22.56 hrs THURSDAY 19 DECEMBER 2019.\n\nEarly Warning Systems and Inconsistent MMS\n\nOn one side, the Mauritius Meteorological Services (MMS) persists in stating on its website, since 12 December 2019, that the Low Pressure and or Tropical Disturbance “It is not influencing weather over the region.”\n\nHowever, the Weather System continued to evolve by causing Sea Swells, Strong Winds and Rains almost without appropriate Forecasts of the MMS. There are many families, including children, who have been “pic-nicking” at the sea sides. They have understood that the MMS has stated that the System will “not influence the weather over the region”. As a governmental and a responsible Authority, the MMS a better Early Warning should have been Alerted to the public.\n\n{{{Special Weather Bulletin\n\nFri, Dec 20, 2019\n\nWeather Outlook for Mauritius and Rodrigues for the period 21 to 25 December 2019 issued at 16h00 on Friday 20 December 2019\n\nGeneral Situation\n\nThe combined effect of a low pressure area evolving to the north of the Mascarenes and an anticyclone far to the South of our region will cause windy conditions to prevail over Mauritius and Rodrigues during the week-end.\n\nThe low pressure is expected to move towards the West.

Refer to pictures below.\n\nCyclone Warning Class 2 for Mauritius and Class 1 for Rodrigues.\n\nOn the other hand, 96 S INVEST (JTWC)-the Tropical Disturbance intensified into a Tropical Depression on Saturday 28 December 2019 and Cyclone Warning Class 1 for both Mauritius and Rodrigues was issued during the night.\n\nThe status is still a Tropical Depression, but it should be named as Moderate Tropical Storm CALVINIA soon. Finally, a Cyclone Warning Class 2 for Mauritius and Warning Class 1 for Rodrigues have been issued by the MMS at 10.10 am Sunday 29 December 2019.

It was named CALVINIA by the Mauritius Meteorological Services at 1500 hours.\n\nAt 1600 hours, the Moderate Tropical Storm CALVINIA was centred at about 275 km to the east-north-east of Mauritius in latitude 19.0 degrees south and longitude 60.0 degrees east. It is moving towards the south-south-west at about 20 km/h.

At the same time Strong Wind and High Waves Warnings were issued regarding Rodrigues after waiving the Cyclone Warning Class 1. The bands of Clouds around Mauritius and Rodrigues continue to shower Rains.\n\n{{{Fifth cyclone bulletin for Mauritius issued at 0430 hours on Monday 30 December 2019.\n\nCALVINIA has intensified during the night and is now a severe tropical storm.\n\nAt 0400 hours the Severe Tropical Storm CALVINIA was centred at about 120 km almost to the east of Mahebourg in latitude 20.7 degrees south and longitude 58.8 degrees east. It is moving towards the south-south-west at a slower speed of about 15 km/h.\n\nOn this trajectory it continues to approach Mauritius while intensifying.\n\nA slight recurvature of its trajectory towards the south west will bring its centre still closer to Mauritius and cause a further deterioration of the weather.\n\nA cyclone warning Class II is in force in Mauritius.\n\nThe public in Mauritius is advised to maintain all preliminary precautions.\n\nActive cloud bands asociated with CALVINIA are influencing weather over Mauritius causing intermittent rain.

It is strongly advised not to ventures at sea.}}}\n\nThe MMS upgraded the warning status of CALVINIA Severe Tropical Storm as Cyclone Warning Class 3 in its 6th Bulletin of 9.00 am of Monday 30 December 2019. As CALVINIA STS stayed quasi-stationery 120 East of Mahebourg coast, there were lots of uncertainties for its trajectory.\n\nUnfortunately, as mentioned about the inconsistency of the MMS, the release of Cyclone Warning Class 3 raised lots of complaints, panic and uproars in public. By the time that there were almost all workers, private and public servants were already at their respective workplace. The authorities ordered everyone to return home. As a result, some bus companies stopped operating before noon, which was the time frame. Inevitably, there were various persons who did not get a public transport for returning home.\n\nAll routine activities stopped throughout Mauritius during midday of this Monday 30 December 2019. The whole population, except those working in the utilities departments, stayed indoors and kept an attentive watch on the evolution of Severe Tropical Storm CALVINIA. Rains, Thunder and Lightning continue to prevail.\n\nMMS Records as at today Monday 30 December 2019:\n\nRainfalls: Mon Bois-141.2 mm; Vacoas (MMS station)-134 mm; Quatre Bornes-97.5 mm and Plaisance (airport)-83.6 mm, mainly.\n\nWind Speed maximised at 43-91 kph; Maximum Temperature reached 280 C. and Humidity was between 88% and 99%.\n\nRodrigues Autonomous Island recorded in Plaine Corail- 98.5 mm; Patate Theophile- 90.2 mm and Pointe Canon- 78.6 mm.\n\nGusts: Pointe Canon-108 kph; Patate Theophile- 93 kph and Plaine Corail -78 kph.\n\nThe Director of the MMS intervened in the national television station (MBC) to explain the reasons for maintaining the Cyclone Warning Class 3 for Mauritius. Refer to the 8th Cyclone Bulletin below.\n\n{{{Eighth cyclone bulletin for Mauritius issued at 1610 hours on Monday 30 December 2019.\n\nAll the observations indicate that the severe tropical storm CALVINIA has remained almost stationary at about 90 km off the coast of Mahebourg. At 1600 hours, it was centered near the point 20.5 degrees South and 58.3 degrees East.\n\nCALVINIA is a severe tropical storm of small diameter. Gusts of the order of 130 km/h are expected in a radius of 40 km around the centre. A movement towards the West could bring the centre closer to Mauritius and cyclonic conditions, that is gusts of the order of 120 km/h, could be felt over the island. Thus, CALVINIA remains a threat for Mauritius.\n\nA cyclone warning Class III is in force in Mauritius.\n\nActive cloud bands associated with CALVINIA continue to influence the weather over Mauritius with intermittent rain. The rain will be moderate to heavy at times with thunderstorms and may cause water accumulation and localised flooding.\n\nThe public in Mauritius is advised to maintain all precautions.\n\nThe sea will be high.\n\nVentures at sea is strictly not advised.\n\nA cyclone warning class III is in force in Mauritius.}}}\n\nPKANHYE. 17.57 pm MONDAY 30 DECEMBER 2019.\n\n{{{Thirteenth cyclone bulletin for Mauritius issued at 0710 hours on Tuesday 31 December 2019.\n\nAt 0700 hours, severe tropical storm CALVINIA was centred around the point 21.3 degrees South in latitude and 58.0 degrees East in longitude, at about 80 km to the south-east of Blue Bay. It was quasi-stationary but, however, latest radar and satellite imageries indicate that CALVINIA began to move slowly towards the south.\n\nCALVINIA remains a severe tropical storm of small diameter. Gusts of the order of 130 km/h exist in a radius of 40 km around the centre. CALVINIA is still evolving in a favourable environment and may intensify further. Given its proximity with Mauritius, a recurvature towards the west will bring the centre closer to Mauritius and cyclonic conditions, that is gusts of the order of 120 km/h, could be felt over the island. Thus, CALVINIA remains a threat for Mauritius.\n\nA cyclone warning Class III is in force in Mauritius.}}}\n\nPKANHYE. 08.37 am TUESDAY 31 DECEMBER 2019.\n\nThe MMS released its 14th Cyclone Bulletin at 10.10 am Tuesady 31 December 2019 as follows:\n\n{{{No cyclone warning is in force in Mauritius.\n\nNo cyclone warning is in force in Mauritius.\n\nFourteenth and last cyclone bulletin for Mauritius issued at 1010 hours on Tuesday 31 December 2019.\n\nDuring the last three hours, the severe tropical storm CALVINIA has maintained its movement towards the south at around 10 km/h. On this trajectory, it is moving away from Mauritius and taking into consideration its small diameter, the risks of having cyclonic conditions over the island have considerably decreased. Therefore, the cyclone warning Class III has been waived for Mauritius at 1010 hours.\n\nAt 1000 hours, it was centered around the point 21.6 degrees South in latitude and 58.2 degrees East in longitude, at about 130 km to the south-east of Blue Bay.\n\nNo cyclone warning is in force in Mauritius.\n\nWeather will be cloudy to overcast with intermittent rain. The rains will be moderate at times with thunderstorm. There will be water accumulation in certain regions. It is strictly advised not to venture along banks of flooded rivers and other water courses.\n\nWind will blow from the western sector 30 to 40 km/h with gusts reaching 100 km/h.\n\nThe sea will be high.\n\nVentures at sea are strictly not advised.}}}\n\nWatch LIVE from MMS\n\nKeep watch for an Assessment Report soon.\n\nPKANHYE. Updated: 10.20 am TUESDAY 31 DECEMBER 2019.\n\nBrief Assessment-Disaster Resilience\n\nIt has been mentioned repetitively, above and in various articles, that the MMS issues contradictory advisories. Most of the time, they give the information that the Weather System “will not influence the region” and eventually issue Sea Swells, High Waves and Heavy Rain Warnings. This is a demonstration of BAD and LATE Early Warning System (EWS), in view of providing Safety and Protection to the population: ‘dissemination of timely and authoritative warnings’ see below.\n\nThe Early Warning Systems (EWS) are considered by WMO as ‘critical life-saving tools’. The EWS are defined by WMO to include four components:\n\ndetection, monitoring and forecasting the hazards;\n\nanalysis of risks involved;\n\ndissemination of timely and authoritative warnings and\n\nactivation of emergency preparedness and response plans.\n\nSuch unprofessional information reaches the public who decide to go spending a day at the sea-side together with their family or friends. It is in such contradictory information that 2 young boys went to spend some time at the sea-side in the South of Mauritius on 29 December 2019. They both encountered difficulty in the dangerous wavy waters. While one of them was able to struggle and reach the shore safely, the other one was drown and his body was never seen.\n\nThe most deplorable situation was highlighted in the fact that the Advisories of Météo-France-Réunion, which is the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) was not activated timely and effectively. MFR mentioned at 06.59 hours on Saturday 28 December 2020 about the forecast made when CALVINIA was still a Tropical Depression and was not yet baptised. MFR stated that the Weather System would reach Moderate Tropical Storm on Monday 30 December 2019 and influence Weather near Mascarene Islands- Reunion, Mauritius and Rodrigues during Monday and Tuesday. It was also stated by MFR that the Weather System would decrease in evolution on Monday and even make a ring near Mauritius.\n\nThe MMS tried to raise an Alert. At 15.00 hours Sunday 29 December 2019, the Tropical Depression was named as CALVINIA Moderate Tropical Storm. At the same time, Cyclone Warning Class 2 (directly) was in force in Mauritius at 16.30 hours on same Sunday 29 December.\n\nCALVINIA intensified into Severe Tropical Storm at 4.00 am on following Monday 30 December and he same Cyclone Warning Class 2 was maintained for Mauritius. Furthermore, the MMS released “Strong wind and High wave warning for Rodrigues valid from 0400 Hours on Monday 30 December 2019 to 1000 hours Tuesday 31 December 2019.”\n\nIt was, 5 hours later, that is at 9.00 am on Monday 30 December 2019 that the Mauritius Meteorological Services upgraded and issued Cyclone Warning Class 3 for Mauritius. Usually, all schools from kindergartens to university levels are kept closed as soon as Cyclone Warning Class 2 is in force. Public and private activities are not closed and routine work is carried on. Since the Cyclone Warning Class 3 was activated at 9.00 am on Monday 30 December 2019, evidently everyone was on duty. So, such Late Warning was therefore the root of all types of social and economic disturbances and complaints. This means that the MMS failed in its duty in launching a real Early Warning System (EWS) as specified above.\n\nTechnically speaking, when a Weather System becomes stationary it can dissipate or intensify further. Given that, CALVINIA was already upgraded to Severe Tropical Storm it was evident that CALVINIA would stay intensified. In fact, the MMS failed to consider the slowing down and the Ring formation mentioned by the Advisories of MFR on Saturday 28 December. As result, the MMS maintained the Cyclone Warning Class 2 at 4.00 hours on Monday 30 December 2019. The MMS committed the blunder.\n\nMoreover, Observations of the Atmosphere and Clouds from the Ground indicated, since 12 December 2019, that CALVINIA would be disastrous, especially with the Heavy Rainfalls recorded as mentioned above.\n\nMétéo-France-Réunion-RSMC Advisories:\n\n<<< WTIO31 FMEE 280659\n\n0.A NUMERO DU BULLETIN : 1/4/20192020\n\n1.A ZONE PERTURBEE 4\n\n2.A POSITION A 0600 UTC LE 28/12/2019 :\n\nDANS UN RAYON DE 20 MN AUTOUR DU POINT 13.0 S / 58.7 E\n\n(TREIZE DEGRES ZERO SUD ET CINQUANTE HUIT DEGRES SEPT EST)\n\nDEPLACEMENT: SUD-EST 6 KT.\n\n1.B PREVISIONS:\n\n12H: 28/12/2019 18 UTC: 14.8 S / 59.1 E, VENT MAX= 030 KT, DEPRESSION TROPICALE\n\n24H: 29/12/2019 06 UTC: 16.7 S / 59.6 E, VENT MAX= 030 KT, DEPRESSION TROPICALE\n\n36H: 29/12/2019 18 UTC: 19.0 S / 59.5 E, VENT MAX= 030 KT, DEPRESSION TROPICALE\n\n48H: 30/12/2019 06 UTC: 20.2 S / 59.1 E, VENT MAX= 035 KT, TEMPETE TROPICALE MODEREE\n\n60H: 30/12/2019 18 UTC: 20.7 S / 58.6 E, VENT MAX= 040 KT, TEMPETE TROPICALE MODEREE\n\n72H: 31/12/2019 06 UTC: 21.2 S / 58.2 E, VENT MAX= 045 KT, TEMPETE TROPICALE\n\nMODEREE\n\n2.B TENDANCE ULTERIEURE:\n\n96H: 01/01/2020 06 UTC: 22.4 S / 59.8 E, VENT MAX= 040 KT, TEMPETE TROPICALE MODEREE\n\n120H: 02/01/2020 06 UTC: 26.6 S / 62.6 E, VENT MAX= 030 KT, DEPRESSION POST-TROPICALE\n\n2.C COMMENTAIRES:\n\nAU COURS DES DERNIERES 24H, LA CONVECTION A PRESENTE DES SIGNES D'ORGANISATION AU SEIN D'UNE LARGE ZONE DE ROTATION PREFERENTIELLE S'APPARENTANT A UNE DEPRESSION DE MOUSSON.
