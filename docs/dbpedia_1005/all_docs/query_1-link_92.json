        "text": "The longest days in Rodrigues Island are in December, with an average of 13.3 hours of daylight per day. June has the shortest days with an average of 10.9 hours of daylight per day.\n\nThe sunniest days in Rodrigues Island are in January which has the most hours of sunshine per day. The sunshine percentage is 51% making it quite sunny but with occasional periods of cloudy and overcast skies. There are 6.8 hours of sunshine per day.\n\nMay has the least sunshine. The sunshine percentage is 44.2% making it quite sunny but with regular periods of cloudy and overcast skies. There are 4.9 hours of sunshine per day.\n\nThe ultraviolet index is the highest in January when it reaches 15.6 and lowest in June when it reaches 6.4.\n\nAn ultraviolet index reading above 11 indicates an extreme risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Unprotected skin risks burning in less than 10 minutes. Take all precautions because unprotected skin and eyes can burn in minutes. Tanning will be safest before 10am and after 4pm but only with a good application of sun screen. For those with sensitive skin stay in the shade and wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and UV-blocking sunglasses. Generously apply broad spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen every 2 hours, even on cloudy days. Watch out for relections from water that may increase ultraviolet exposure.\n\nThe most humid month in Rodrigues Island is February with a dew point (an indicator of humidity) of 25째C (77째F) which is very uncomfortable and fairly oppressive unless you are on a beach. At night you would most likely require airconditioning.\n\nThe least humid month in Rodrigues Island is August with a dew point of 19째C (66째F) which is somewhat uncomfortable for most people in cities but fine on a beach."
