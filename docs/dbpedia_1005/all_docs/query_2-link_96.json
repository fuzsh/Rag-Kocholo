However, they are not spread uniformly across the globe, and different parts of the world experience impacts differently. An average warming of 1.5°C across the whole globe raises the risk of heatwaves and heavy rainfall events, amongst many other potential impacts. Limiting warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C can help reduce these risks, but the impacts the world experiences will depend on the specific greenhouse gas emissions ‘pathway’ taken. The consequences of temporarily overshooting 1.5°C of warming and returning to this level later in the century, for example, could be larger than if temperature stabilizes below 1.5°C. The size and duration of an overshoot will also affect future impacts.\n\nHuman activity has warmed the world by about 1°C since pre-industrial times, and the impacts of this warming have already been felt in many parts of the world. This estimate of the increase in global temperature is the average of many thousands of temperature measurements taken over the world’s land and oceans. Temperatures are not changing at the same speed everywhere, however: warming is strongest on continents and is particularly strong in the Arctic in the cold season and in mid-latitude regions in the warm season. This is due to self-amplifying mechanisms, for instance due to snow and ice melt reducing the reflectivity of solar radiation at the surface, or soil drying leading to less evaporative cooling in the interior of continents. This means that some parts of the world have already experienced temperatures greater than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nExtra warming on top of the approximately 1°C we have seen so far would amplify the risks and associated impacts, with implications for the world and its inhabitants. This would be the case even if the global warming is held at 1.5°C, just half a degree above where we are now, and would be further amplified at 2°C of global warming. Reaching 2°C instead of 1.5°C of global warming would lead to substantial warming of extreme hot days in all land regions. It would also lead to an increase in heavy rainfall events in some regions, particularly in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, potentially raising the risk of flooding. In addition, some regions, such as the Mediterranean, are projected to become drier at 2°C versus 1.5°C of global warming. The impacts of any additional warming would also include stronger melting of ice sheets and glaciers, as well as increased sea level rise, which would continue long after the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations.\n\nChange in climate means and extremes have knock-on effects for the societies and ecosystems living on the planet. Climate change is projected to be a poverty multiplier, which means that its impacts are expected to make the poor poorer and the total number of people living in poverty greater. The 0.5°C rise in global temperatures that we have experienced in the past 50 years has contributed to shifts in the distribution of plant and animal species, decreases in crop yields and more frequent wildfires. Similar changes can be expected with further rises in global temperature.\n\nEssentially, the lower the rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels, the lower the risks to human societies and natural ecosystems. Put another way, limiting warming to 1.5°C can be understood in terms of ‘avoided impacts’ compared to higher levels of warming. Many of the impacts of climate change assessed in this report have lower associated risks at 1.5°C compared to 2°C.\n\nThermal expansion of the oceans means sea level will continue to rise even if the increase in global temperature is limited to 1.5°C, but this rise would be lower than in a 2°C warmer world. Ocean acidification, the process by which excess CO2 dissolves into oceans and makes them more acidic, is expected to be less damaging in a world where CO2 emissions are reduced and warming is stabilized at 1.5°C compared to 2°C. The persistence of coral reefs is greater in a 1.5°C world than that of a 2°C world, too.\n\nThe impacts of climate change that we experience in future will be affected by factors other than the change in temperature. The consequences of 1.5°C of warming will additionally depend on the specific greenhouse gas emissions ‘pathway’ that is followed and the extent to which adaptation can reduce vulnerability. This IPCC Special Report uses a number of ‘pathways’ to explore different possibilities for limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. One type of pathway sees global temperature stabilize at, or just below, 1.5°C. Another sees global temperature temporarily exceed 1.5°C before declining later in the century (known as an ‘overshoot’ pathway).\n\nSuch pathways would have different associated impacts, so it is important to distinguish between them for planning adaptation and mitigation strategies. For example, impacts from an overshoot pathway could be larger than impacts from a stabilization pathway. The size and duration of an overshoot would also have consequences for the impacts the world experiences. For instance, pathways that overshoot 1.5°C run a greater risk of passing through ‘tipping points’, thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures are brought back down later on. The collapse of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets on the time scale of centuries and millennia is one example of a tipping point.\n\nES\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nShare\n\nThis chapter builds on findings of AR5 and assesses new scientific evidence of changes in the climate system and the associated impacts on natural and human systems, with a specific focus on the magnitude and pattern of risks linked for global warming of 1.5°C above temperatures in the pre-industrial period. Chapter 3 explores observed impacts and projected risks to a range of natural and human systems, with a focus on how risk levels change from 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming. The chapter also revisits major categories of risk (Reasons for Concern, RFC) based on the assessment of new knowledge that has become available since AR5.\n\n1.5°C and 2°C Warmer Worlds\n\nThe global climate has changed relative to the pre-industrial period, and there are multiple lines of evidence that these changes have had impacts on organisms and ecosystems, as well as on human systems and well-being (high confidence). The increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST), which reached 0.87°C in 2006–2015 relative to 1850–1900, has increased the frequency and magnitude of impacts (high confidence), strengthening evidence of how an increase in GMST of 1.5°C or more could impact natural and human systems (1.5°C versus 2°C). {3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, Cross-Chapter Boxes 6, 7 and 8 in this chapter}\n\nHuman-induced global warming has already caused multiple observed changes in the climate system (high confidence). Changes include increases in both land and ocean temperatures, as well as more frequent heatwaves in most land regions (high confidence). There is also (high confidence) global warming has resulted in an increase in the frequency and duration of marine heatwaves. Further, there is substantial evidence that human-induced global warming has led to an increase in the frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation events at the global scale (medium confidence), as well as an increased risk of drought in the Mediterranean region (medium confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, Box 3.4}\n\nTrends in intensity and frequency of some climate and weather extremes have been detected over time spans during which about 0.5°C of global warming occurred (medium confidence). This assessment is based on several lines of evidence, including attribution studies for changes in extremes since 1950. {3.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4}\n\nSeveral regional changes in climate are assessed to occur with global warming up to 1.5°C as compared to pre-industrial levels, including warming of extreme temperatures in many regions (high confidence), increases in frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation in several regions (high confidence), and an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions (medium confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, Table 3.2}\n\nThere is no single ‘1.5°C warmer world’ (high confidence). In addition to the overall increase in GMST, it is important to consider the size and duration of potential overshoots in temperature. Furthermore, there are questions on how the stabilization of an increase in GMST of 1.5°C can be achieved, and how policies might be able to influence the resilience of human and natural systems, and the nature of regional and subregional risks. Overshooting poses large risks for natural and human systems, especially if the temperature at peak warming is high, because some risks may be long-lasting and irreversible, such as the loss of some ecosystems (high confidence). The rate of change for several types of risks may also have relevance, with potentially large risks in the case of a rapid rise to overshooting temperatures, even if a decrease to 1.5°C can be achieved at the end of the 21st century or later (medium confidence). If overshoot is to be minimized, the remaining equivalent CO2 budget available for emissions is very small, which implies that large, immediate and unprecedented global efforts to mitigate greenhouse gases are required (high confidence). {3.2, 3.6.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter}\n\nRobust global differences in temperature means and extremes are expected if global warming reaches 1.5°C versus 2°C above the pre-industrial levels (high confidence). For oceans, regional surface temperature means and extremes are projected to be higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). Temperature means and extremes are also projected to be higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C in most land regions, with increases being 2–3 times greater than the increase in GMST projected for some regions (high confidence). Robust increases in temperature means and extremes are also projected at 1.5°C compared to present-day values (high confidence) {3.3.1, 3.3.2}. There are decreases in the occurrence of cold extremes, but substantial increases in their temperature, in particular in regions with snow or ice cover (high confidence) {3.3.1}.\n\nClimate models project robust differences in regional climate between present-day and global warming up to 1.5°C, and between 1.5°C and 2°C (high confidence), depending on the variable and region in question (high confidence). Large, robust and widespread differences are expected for temperature extremes (high confidence). Regarding hot extremes, the strongest warming is expected to occur at mid-latitudes in the warm season (with increases of up to 3°C for 1.5°C of global warming, i.e., a factor of two) and at high latitudes in the cold season (with increases of up to 4.5°C at 1.5°C of global warming, i.e., a factor of three) (high confidence). The strongest warming of hot extremes is projected to occur in central and eastern North America, central and southern Europe, the Mediterranean region (including southern Europe, northern Africa and the Near East), western and central Asia, and southern Africa (medium confidence). The number of exceptionally hot days are expected to increase the most in the tropics, where interannual temperature variability is lowest; extreme heatwaves are thus projected to emerge earliest in these regions, and they are expected to already become widespread there at 1.5°C global warming (high confidence). Limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C could result in around 420 million fewer people being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves, and about 65 million fewer people being exposed to exceptional heatwaves, assuming constant vulnerability (medium confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter}\n\nLimiting global warming to 1.5°C would limit risks of increases in heavy precipitation events on a global scale and in several regions compared to conditions at 2°C global warming (medium confidence). The regions with the largest increases in heavy precipitation events for 1.5°C to 2°C global warming include: several high-latitude regions (e.g. Alaska/western Canada, eastern Canada/ Greenland/Iceland, northern Europe and northern Asia); mountainous regions (e.g.,Tibetan Plateau); eastern Asia (including China and Japan); and eastern North America (medium confidence). Tropical cyclones are projected to decrease in frequency but with an increase in the number of very intense cyclones (limited evidence, low confidence). Heavy precipitation associated with tropical cyclones is projected to be higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). Heavy precipitation, when aggregated at a global scale, is projected to be higher at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence) {3.3.3, 3.3.6}\n\nLimiting global warming to 1.5°C is expected to substantially reduce the probability of extreme drought, precipitation deficits, and risks associated with water availability (i.e., water stress) in some regions (medium confidence). In particular, risks associated with increases in drought frequency and magnitude are projected to be substantially larger at 2°C than at 1.5°C in the Mediterranean region (including southern Europe, northern Africa and the Near East) and southern Africa (medium confidence). {3.3.3, 3.3.4, Box 3.1, Box 3.2}\n\nRisks to natural and human systems are expected to be lower at 1.5°C than at 2°C of global warming (high confidence). This difference is due to the smaller rates and magnitudes of climate change associated with a 1.5°C temperature increase, including lower frequencies and intensities of temperature-related extremes. Lower rates of change enhance the ability of natural and human systems to adapt, with substantial benefits for a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater, wetland, coastal and ocean ecosystems (including coral reefs) (high confidence), as well as food production systems, human health, and tourism (medium confidence), together with energy systems and transportation (low confidence). {3.3.1, 3.4}\n\nExposure to multiple and compound climate-related risks is projected to increase between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming with greater proportions of people both exposed and susceptible to poverty in Africa and Asia (high confidence). For global warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, risks across energy, food, and water sectors could overlap spatially and temporally, creating new – and exacerbating current – hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities that could affect increasing numbers of people and regions (medium confidence). Small island states and economically disadvantaged populations are particularly at risk (high confidence). {3.3.1, 3.4.5.3, 3.4.5.6, 3.4.11, 3.5.4.9, Box 3.5}\n\nGlobal warming of 2°C would lead to an expansion of areas with significant increases in runoff, as well as those affected by flood hazard, compared to conditions at 1.5°C (medium confidence). Global warming of 1.5°C would also lead to an expansion of the global land area with significant increases in runoff (medium confidence) and an increase in flood hazard in some regions (medium confidence) compared to present-day conditions. {3.3.5}\n\nThe probability of a sea-ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer is substantially higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). Model simulations suggest that at least one sea-ice-free Arctic summer is expected every 10 years for global warming of 2°C, with the frequency decreasing to one sea-ice-free Arctic summer every 100 years under 1.5°C (medium confidence). An intermediate temperature overshoot will have no long- term consequences for Arctic sea ice coverage, and hysteresis is not expected (high confidence). {3.3.8, 3.4.4.7}\n\nGlobal mean sea level rise (GMSLR) is projected to be around 0.1 m (0.04 – 0.16 m) less by the end of the 21st century in a 1.5°C warmer world compared to a 2°C warmer world (medium confidence). Projected GMSLR for 1.5°C of global warming has an indicative range of 0.26 – 0.77m, relative to 1986–2005, (medium confidence). A smaller sea level rise could mean that up to 10.4 million fewer people (based on the 2010 global population and assuming no adaptation) would be exposed to the impacts of sea level rise globally in 2100 at 1.5°C compared to at 2°C. A slower rate of sea level rise enables greater opportunities for adaptation (medium confidence). There is high confidence that sea level rise will continue beyond 2100. Instabilities exist for both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which could result in multi-meter rises in sea level on time scales of century to millennia. There is (medium confidence) that these instabilities could be triggered at around 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming. {3.3.9, 3.4.5, 3.6.3}\n\nThe ocean has absorbed about 30% of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide, resulting in ocean acidification and changes to carbonate chemistry that are unprecedented for at least the last 65 million years (high confidence). Risks have been identified for the survival, calcification, growth, development and abundance of a broad range of marine taxonomic groups, ranging from algae to fish, with substantial evidence of predictable trait-based sensitivities (high confidence). There are multiple lines of evidence that ocean warming and acidification corresponding to 1.5°C of global warming would impact a wide range of marine organisms and ecosystems, as well as sectors such as aquaculture and fisheries (high confidence). {3.3.10, 3.4.4}\n\nLarger risks are expected for many regions and systems for global warming at 1.5°C, as compared to today, with adaptation required now and up to 1.5°C. However, risks would be larger at 2°C of warming and an even greater effort would be needed for adaptation to a temperature increase of that magnitude (high confidence). {3.4, Box 3.4, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}\n\nFuture risks at 1.5°C of global warming will depend on the mitigation pathway and on the possible occurrence of a transient overshoot (high confidence). The impacts on natural and human systems would be greater if mitigation pathways temporarily overshoot 1.5°C and return to 1.5°C later in the century, as compared to pathways that stabilize at 1.5°C without an overshoot (high confidence). The size and duration of an overshoot would also affect future impacts (e.g., irreversible loss of some ecosystems) (high confidence). Changes in land use resulting from mitigation choices could have impacts on food production and ecosystem diversity. {3.6.1, 3.6.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in this chapter}\n\nClimate Change Risks for Natural and Human systems\n\nTerrestrial and Wetland Ecosystems\n\nRisks of local species losses and, consequently, risks of extinction are much less in a 1.5°C versus a 2°C warmer world (high confidence). The number of species projected to lose over half of their climatically determined geographic range at 2°C global warming (18% of insects, 16% of plants, 8% of vertebrates) is projected to be reduced to 6% of insects, 8% of plants and 4% of vertebrates at 1.5°C warming (medium confidence). Risks associated with other biodiversity-related factors, such as forest fires, extreme weather events, and the spread of invasive species, pests and diseases, would also be lower at 1.5°C than at 2°C of warming (high confidence), supporting a greater persistence of ecosystem services.\n\n{3.4.3, 3.5.2}\n\nConstraining global warming to 1.5°C, rather than to 2°C and higher, is projected to have many benefits for terrestrial and wetland ecosystems and for the preservation of their services to humans (high confidence). Risks for natural and managed ecosystems are higher on drylands compared to humid lands. The global terrestrial land area projected to be affected by ecosystem transformations (13%, interquartile range 8–20%) at 2°C is approximately halved at 1.5°C global warming to 4% (interquartile range 2–7%) (medium confidence). Above 1.5°C, an expansion of desert terrain and vegetation would occur in the Mediterranean biome (medium confidence), causing changes unparalleled in the last 10,000 years (medium confidence). {3.3.2.2, 3.4.3.2, 3.4.3.5, 3.4.6.1, 3.5.5.10, Box 4.2}\n\nMany impacts are projected to be larger at higher latitudes, owing to mean and cold-season warming rates above the global average (medium confidence). High-latitude tundra and boreal forest are particularly at risk, and woody shrubs are already encroaching into tundra (high confidence) and will proceed with further warming. Constraining warming to 1.5°C would prevent the thawing of an estimated permafrost area of 1.5 to 2.5 million km2 over centuries compared to thawing under 2°C (medium confidence). {3.3.2, 3.4.3, 3.4.4}\n\nOcean Ecosystems\n\nOcean ecosystems are already experiencing large-scale changes, and critical thresholds are expected to be reached at 1.5°C and higher levels of global warming (high confidence). In the transition to 1.5°C of warming, changes to water temperatures are expected to drive some species (e.g., plankton, fish) to relocate to higher latitudes and cause novel ecosystems to assemble (high confidence). Other ecosystems (e.g., kelp forests, coral reefs) are relatively less able to move, however, and are projected to experience high rates of mortality and loss (very high confidence). For example, multiple lines of evidence indicate that the majority (70–90%) of warm water (tropical) coral reefs that exist today will disappear even if global warming is constrained to 1.5°C (very high confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}\n\nCurrent ecosystem services from the ocean are expected to be reduced at 1.5°C of global warming, with losses being even greater at 2°C of global warming (high confidence). The risks of declining ocean productivity, shifts of species to higher latitudes, damage to ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs, and mangroves, seagrass and other wetland ecosystems), loss of fisheries productivity (at low latitudes), and changes to ocean chemistry (e.g., acidification, hypoxia and dead zones) are projected to be substantially lower when global warming is limited to 1.5°C (high confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}\n\nWater Resources\n\nThe projected frequency and magnitude of floods and droughts in some regions are smaller under 1.5°C than under 2°C of warming (medium confidence). Human exposure to increased flooding is projected to be substantially lower at 1.5°C compared to 2°C of global warming, although projected changes create regionally differentiated risks (medium confidence). The differences in the risks among regions are strongly influenced by local socio-economic conditions (medium confidence). {3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.4.2}\n\nRisks of water scarcity are projected to be greater at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming in some regions (medium confidence). Depending on future socio-economic conditions, limiting global warming to 1.5°C, compared to 2°C, may reduce the proportion of the world population exposed to a climate change-induced increase in water stress by up to 50%, although there is considerable variability between regions (medium confidence). Regions with particularly large benefits could include the Mediterranean and the Caribbean (medium confidence). Socio-economic drivers, however, are expected to have a greater influence on these risks than the changes in climate (medium confidence). {3.3.5, 3.4.2, Box 3.5}\n\nLand Use, Food Security and Food Production Systems\n\nLimiting global warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, is projected to result in smaller net reductions in yields of maize, rice, wheat, and potentially other cereal crops, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America; and in the CO2-dependent nutritional quality of rice and wheat (high confidence). A loss of 7–10% of rangeland livestock globally is projected for approximately 2°C of warming, with considerable economic consequences for many communities and regions (medium confidence). {3.4.6, 3.6, Box 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}\n\nReductions in projected food availability are larger at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming in the Sahel, southern Africa, the Mediterranean, central Europe and the Amazon (medium confidence). This suggests a transition from medium to high risk of regionally differentiated impacts on food security between 1.5°C and 2°C (medium confidence). Future economic and trade environments and their response to changing food availability (medium confidence) are important potential adaptation options for reducing hunger risk in low- and middle-income countries. {Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}\n\nFisheries and aquaculture are important to global food security but are already facing increasing risks from ocean warming and acidification (medium confidence). These risks are projected to increase at 1.5°C of global warming and impact key organisms such as fin fish and bivalves (e.g., oysters), especially at low latitudes (medium confidence). Small-scale fisheries in tropical regions, which are very dependent on habitat provided by coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass and kelp forests, are expected to face growing risks at 1.5°C of warming because of loss of habitat (medium confidence). Risks of impacts and decreasing food security are projected to become greater as global warming reaches beyond 1.5°C and both ocean warming and acidification increase, with substantial losses likely for coastal livelihoods and industries (e.g., fisheries and aquaculture) (medium to high confidence). {3.4.4, 3.4.5, 3.4.6, Box 3.1, Box 3.4, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}\n\nLand use and land-use change emerge as critical features of virtually all mitigation pathways that seek to limit global warming to 1.5°C (high confidence). Most least-cost mitigation pathways to limit peak or end-of-century warming to 1.5°C make use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR), predominantly employing significant levels of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and/or afforestation and reforestation (AR) in their portfolio of mitigation measures (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter}\n\nLarge-scale deployment of BECCS and/or AR would have a far-reaching land and water footprint (high confidence). Whether this footprint would result in adverse impacts, for example on biodiversity or food production, depends on the existence and effectiveness of measures to conserve land carbon stocks, measures to limit agricultural expansion in order to protect natural ecosystems, and the potential to increase agricultural productivity (medium agreement). In addition, BECCS and/or AR would have substantial direct effects on regional climate through biophysical feedbacks, which are generally not included in Integrated Assessments Models (high confidence). {3.6.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in this chapter}\n\nThe impacts of large-scale CDR deployment could be greatly reduced if a wider portfolio of CDR options were deployed, if a holistic policy for sustainable land management were adopted, and if increased mitigation efforts were employed to strongly limit the demand for land, energy and material resources, including through lifestyle and dietary changes (medium confidence). In particular, reforestation could be associated with significant co-benefits if implemented in a manner than helps restore natural ecosystems (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter}\n\nHuman Health, Well-Being, Cities and Poverty\n\nAny increase in global temperature (e.g., +0.5°C) is projected to affect human health, with primarily negative consequences (high confidence). Lower risks are projected at 1.5°C than at 2°C for heat-related morbidity and mortality (very high confidence), and for ozone-related mortality if emissions needed for ozone formation remain high (high confidence). Urban heat islands often amplify the impacts of heatwaves in cities (high confidence). Risks for some vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever are projected to increase with warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, including potential shifts in their geographic range (high confidence). Overall for vector- borne diseases, whether projections are positive or negative depends on the disease, region and extent of change (high confidence). Lower risks of undernutrition are projected at 1.5°C than at 2°C (medium confidence). Incorporating estimates of adaptation into projections reduces the magnitude of risks (high confidence). {3.4.7, 3.4.7.1, 3.4.8, 3.5.5.8}\n\nGlobal warming of 2°C is expected to pose greater risks to urban areas than global warming of 1.5°C (medium confidence). The extent of risk depends on human vulnerability and the effectiveness of adaptation for regions (coastal and non-coastal), informal settlements and infrastructure sectors (such as energy, water and transport) (high confidence). {3.4.5, 3.4.8}\n\nPoverty and disadvantage have increased with recent warming (about 1°C) and are expected to increase for many populations as average global temperatures increase from 1°C to 1.5°C and higher (medium confidence). Outmigration in agricultural- dependent communities is positively and statistically significantly associated with global temperature (medium confidence). Our understanding of the links of 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming to human migration are limited and represent an important knowledge gap. {3.4.10, 3.4.11, 5.2.2, Table 3.5}\n\nKey Economic Sectors and Services\n\nRisks to global aggregated economic growth due to climate change impacts are projected to be lower at 1.5°C than at 2°C by the end of this century (medium confidence). {3.5.2, 3.5.3} The largest reductions in economic growth at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of warming are projected for low- and middle-income countries and regions (the African continent, Southeast Asia, India, Brazil and Mexico) (low to medium confidence). Countries in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere subtropics are projected to experience the largest impacts on economic growth due to climate change should global warming increase from 1.5°C to 2°C (medium confidence). {3.5} Global warming has already affected tourism, with increased risks projected under 1.5°C of warming in specific geographic regions and for seasonal tourism including sun, beach and snow sports destinations (very high confidence). Risks will be lower for tourism markets that are less climate sensitive, such as gaming and large hotel-based activities (high confidence). Risks for coastal tourism, particularly in subtropical and tropical regions, will increase with temperature-related degradation (e.g., heat extremes, storms) or loss of beach and coral reef assets (high confidence). {3.3.6, 3.4.4.12, 3.4.9.1, Box 3.4}\n\nSmall Islands, and Coastal and Low-lying areas\n\nSmall islands are projected to experience multiple inter- related risks at 1.5°C of global warming that will increase with warming of 2°C and higher levels (high confidence). Climate hazards at 1.5°C are projected to be lower compared to those at 2°C (high confidence). Long-term risks of coastal flooding and impacts on populations, infrastructures and assets (high confidence), freshwater stress (medium confidence), and risks across marine ecosystems (high confidence) and critical sectors (medium confidence) are projected to increase at 1.5°C compared to present-day levels and increase further at 2°C, limiting adaptation opportunities and increasing loss and damage (medium confidence). Migration in small islands (internally and internationally) occurs for multiple reasons and purposes, mostly for better livelihood opportunities (high confidence) and increasingly owing to sea level rise (medium confidence). {3.3.2.2, 3.3.6–9, 3.4.3.2, 3.4.4.2, 3.4.4.5, 3.4.4.12, 3.4.5.3, 3.4.7.1, 3.4.9.1, 3.5.4.9, Box 3.4, Box 3.5}\n\nImpacts associated with sea level rise and changes to the salinity of coastal groundwater, increased flooding and damage to infrastructure, are projected to be critically important in vulnerable environments, such as small islands, low-lying coasts and deltas, at global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C (high confidence). Localized subsidence and changes to river discharge can potentially exacerbate these effects. Adaptation is already happening (high confidence) and will remain important over multi-centennial time scales. {3.4.5.3, 3.4.5.4, 3.4.5.7, 5.4.5.4, Box\n\n3.5}\n\nExisting and restored natural coastal ecosystems may be effective in reducing the adverse impacts of rising sea levels and intensifying storms by protecting coastal and deltaic regions (medium confidence). Natural sedimentation rates are expected to be able to offset the effect of rising sea levels, given the slower rates of sea level rise associated with 1.5°C of warming (medium confidence). Other feedbacks, such as landward migration of wetlands and the adaptation of infrastructure, remain important (medium confidence). {3.4.4.12, 3.4.5.4, 3.4.5.7}\n\nIncreased Reasons for Concern\n\nThere are multiple lines of evidence that since AR5 the assessed levels of risk increased for four of the five Reasons for Concern (RFCs) for global warming levels of up to 2°C (high confidence). The risk transitions by degrees of global warming are now: from high to very high between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC1 (Unique and threatened systems) (high confidence); from moderate to high risk between 1°C and 1.5°C for RFC2 (Extreme weather events) (medium confidence); from moderate to high risk between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC3 (Distribution of impacts) (high confidence); from moderate to high risk between 1.5°C and 2.5°C for RFC4 (Global aggregate impacts) (medium confidence); and from moderate to high risk between 1°C and 2.5°C for RFC5 (Large-scale singular events) (medium confidence). {3.5.2}\n\nThe category ‘Unique and threatened systems’ (RFC1) display a transition from high to very high risk which is now located between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming as opposed to at 2.6°C of global warming in AR5, owing to new and multiple lines of evidence for changing risks for coral reefs, the Arctic and biodiversity in general (high confidence). {3.5.2.1}\n\nIn ‘Extreme weather events’ (RFC2), the transition from moderate to high risk is now located between 1.0°C and 1.5°C of global warming, which is very similar to the AR5 assessment but is projected with greater confidence (medium confidence). The impact literature contains little information about the potential for human society to adapt to extreme weather events, and hence it has not been possible to locate the transition from ‘high’ to ‘very high’ risk within the context of assessing impacts at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming. There is thus low confidence in the level at which global warming could lead to very high risks associated with extreme weather events in the context of this report. {3.5}\n\nWith respect to the ‘Distribution of impacts’ (RFC3) a transition from moderate to high risk is now located between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, compared with between 1.6°C and 2.6°C global warming in AR5, owing to new evidence about regionally differentiated risks to food security, water resources, drought, heat exposure and coastal submergence (high confidence). {3.5}\n\nIn ‘global aggregate impacts’ (RFC4) a transition from moderate to high levels of risk is now located between 1.5°C and 2.5°C of global warming, as opposed to at 3.6°C of warming in AR5, owing to new evidence about global aggregate economic impacts and risks to Earth’s biodiversity (medium confidence). {3.5}\n\nFinally, ‘large-scale singular events’ (RFC5), moderate risk is now located at 1°C of global warming and high risk is located at 2.5°C of global warming, as opposed to at 1.6°C (moderate risk) and around 4°C (high risk) in AR5, because of new observations and models of the West Antarctic ice sheet (medium confidence). {3.3.9, 3.5.2, 3.6.3}\n\nX\n\nCitation\n\nShare\n\nThis chapter should be cited as:\n\nHoegh-Guldberg, O., D.

It interacts with information presented in Chapter 2 via the provision of specific details relating to the mitigation pathways (e.g., land-use changes) and their implications for impacts. Chapter 3 also includes information needed for the assessment and implementation of adaptation options (presented in Chapter 4), as well as the context for considering the interactions of climate change with sustainable development and for the assessment of impacts on sustainability, poverty and inequalities at the household to subregional level (presented in Chapter 5).\n\nThis chapter is necessarily transdisciplinary in its coverage of the climate system, natural and managed ecosystems, and human systems and responses, owing to the integrated nature of the natural and human experience. While climate change is acknowledged as a centrally important driver, it is not the only driver of risks to human and natural systems, and in many cases, it is the interaction between these two broad categories of risk that is important (Chapter 1).\n\nThe flow of the chapter, linkages between sections, a list of chapter-and cross-chapter boxes, and a content guide for reading according to focus or interest are given in Figure 3.1. Key definitions used in the chapter are collected in the Glossary. Confidence language is used throughout this chapter and likelihood statements (e.g., likely, very likely) are provided when there is high confidence in the assessment.\n\nThe underlying literature assessed in Chapter 3 is broad and includes a large number of recent publications specific to assessments for 1.5°C of warming. The chapter also utilizes information covered in prior IPCC special reports, for example the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX; IPCC, 2012)1, and many chapters from the IPCC WGII Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) that assess impacts on natural and managed ecosystems and humans, as well as adaptation options (IPCC, 2014b)2. For this reason, the chapter provides information based on a broad range of assessment methods. Details about the approaches used are presented in Section 3.2.\n\nSection 3.3 gives a general overview of recent literature on observed climate change impacts as the context for projected future risks. With a few exceptions, the focus here is the analysis of transient responses at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, with simulations of short-term stabilization scenarios (Section 3.2) also assessed in some cases. In general, long-term equilibrium stabilization responses could not be assessed owing to a lack of data and analysis. A detailed analysis of detection and attribution is not provided but will be the focus of the next IPCC assessment report (AR6). Furthermore, possible interventions in the climate system through radiation modification measures, which are not tied to reductions of greenhouse gas emissions or concentrations, are not assessed in this chapter.\n\nUnderstanding the observed impacts and projected risks of climate change is crucial to comprehending how the world is likely to change under global warming of 1.5°C above temperatures in the pre-industrial period (with reference to 2°C). Section 3.4 explores the new literature and updates the assessment of impacts and projected risks for a large number of natural and human systems. By also exploring adaptation opportunities, where the literature allows, the section prepares the reader for discussions in subsequent chapters about opportunities to tackle both mitigation and adaptation. The section is mostly globally focused because of limited research on regional risks and adaptation options at 1.5°C and 2°C. For example, the risks of 1.5°C and 2°C of warming in urban areas, as well as the risks of health outcomes under these two warming scenarios (e.g. climate-related diseases, air quality impacts and mental health problems), were not considered because of a lack of projections of how these risks might change in a 1.5°C or 2°C warmer world. In addition, the complexity of many interactions of climate change with drivers of poverty, along with a paucity of relevant studies, meant it was not possible to detect and attribute many dimensions of poverty and disadvantage to climate change. Even though there is increasing documentation of climate-related impacts on places where indigenous people live and where subsistence-oriented communities are found, relevant projections of the risks associated with warming of 1.5°C and 2°C are necessarily limited.\n\nTo explore avoided impacts and reduced risks at 1.5°C compared with at 2°C of global warming, the chapter adopts the AR5 ‘Reasons for Concern’ aggregated projected risk framework (Section 3.5). Updates in terms of the aggregation of risks are informed by the most recent literature and the assessments offered in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, with a focus on the impacts at 2°C of warming that could potentially be avoided if warming were constrained to 1.5°C. Economic benefits that would be obtained (Section 3.5.3), climate change ‘hotspots’ that could be avoided or reduced (Section 3.5.4 as guided by the assessments of Sections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5), and tipping points that could be circumvented (Section 3.5.5) at 1.5°C compared to higher degrees of global warming are all examined. The latter assessments are, however, constrained to regional analyses, and hence this particular section does not include an assessment of specific losses and damages.\n\nSection 3.6 provides an overview on specific aspects of the mitigation pathways considered compatible with 1.5°C of global warming, including some scenarios involving temperature overshoot above 1.5°C global warming during the 21st century. Non-CO2 implications and projected risks of mitigation pathways, such as changes to land use and atmospheric compounds, are presented and explored. Finally, implications for sea ice, sea level and permafrost beyond the end of the century are assessed.\n\nThe exhaustive assessment of literature specific to global warming of 1.5°C above the pre-industrial period, presented across all the sections in Chapter 3, highlights knowledge gaps resulting from the heterogeneous information available across systems, regions and sectors. Some of these gaps are described in Section 3.7.\n\n3.2\n\nHow are Risks at 1.5°C and Higher Levels of Global Warming Assessed in this Chapter?\n\nShare\n\nThe methods that are applied for assessing observed and projected changes in climate and weather are presented in Section 3.2.1, while those used for assessing the observed impacts on and projected risks to natural and managed systems, and to human settlements, are described in Section 3.2.2. Given that changes in climate associated with 1.5°C of global warming were not the focus of past IPCC reports, dedicated approaches based on recent literature that are specific to the present report are also described. Background on specific methodological aspects (climate model simulations available for assessments at 1.5°C global warming, attribution of observed changes in climate and their relevance for assessing projected changes at 1.5°C and 2°C global warming, and the propagation of uncertainties from climate forcing to impacts on ecosystems) are provided in the Supplementary Material 3.SM.\n\n3.2.1\n\nHow are Changes in Climate and Weather at 1.5°C versus Higher Levels of Warming Assessed?\n\nEvidence for the assessment of changes to climate at 1.5°C versus 2°C can be drawn both from observations and model projections. Global mean surface temperature (GMST) anomalies were about +0.87°C (±0.10°C likely range) above pre-industrial industrial (1850–1900) values in the 2006-–2015 decade, with a recent warming of about 0.2°C (±0.10°C) per decade (Chapter 1). Human-induced global warming reached approximately 1°C (±0.2°C likely range) in 2017 (Chapter 1). While some of the observed trends may be due to internal climate variability, methods of detection and attribution can be applied to assess which part of the observed changes may be attributed to anthropogenic forcing (Bindoff et al., 2013b)3. Hence, evidence from attribution studies can be used to assess changes in the climate system that are already detectable at lower levels of global warming and would thus continue to change with a further 0.5°C or 1°C of global warming (see Supplementary Material 3.SM.1 and Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4 and 3.3.11). A recent study identified significant changes in extremes for a 0.5°C difference in global warming based on the historical record (Schleussner et al., 2017)4. It should also be noted that attributed changes in extremes since 1950 that were reported in the IPCC AR5 report (IPCC, 2013)5 generally correspond to changes in global warming of about 0.5°C (see 3.SM.1)\n\nClimate model simulations are necessary for the investigation of the response of the climate system to various forcings, in particular to forcings associated with higher levels of greenhouse gas concentrations. Model simulations include experiments with global and regional climate models, as well as impact models – driven with output from climate models – to evaluate the risk related to climate change for natural and human systems (Supplementary Material 3.SM.1). Climate model simulations were generally used in the context of particular ‘climate scenarios’ from previous IPCC reports (e.g., IPCC, 2007, 2013)6. This means that emissions scenarios (IPCC, 2000)7 were used to drive climate models, providing different projections for given emissions pathways. The results were consequently used in a ‘storyline’ framework, which presents the development of climate in the course of the 21st century and beyond for a given emissions pathway. Results were assessed for different time slices within the model projections such as 2016–2035 (‘near term’, which is slightly below a global warming of 1.5°C according to most scenarios, Kirtman et al., 2013)8, 2046–2065 (mid-21st century, Collins et al., 2013)9, and 2081–2100 (end of 21st century, Collins et al., 2013)10. Given that this report focuses on climate change for a given mean global temperature response (1.5°C or 2°C), methods of analysis had to be developed and/or adapted from previous studies in order to provide assessments for the specific purposes here.\n\nA major challenge in assessing climate change under 1.5°C, or 2°C (and higher levels), of global warming pertains to the definition of a ‘1.5°C or 2°C climate projection’ (see also Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter). Resolving this challenge includes the following considerations:\n\nThe need to distinguish between (i) transient climate responses (i.e., those that ‘pass through’ 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming), (ii) short-term stabilization responses (i.e., scenarios for the late 21st century that result in stabilization at a mean global warming of 1.5°C or 2°C by 2100), and (iii) long-term equilibrium stabilization responses (i.e., those occurring after several millennia once climate (temperature) equilibrium at 1.5°C or 2°C is reached). These responses can be very different in terms of climate variables and the inertia associated with a given climate forcing. A striking example is sea level rise (SLR). In this case, projected increases within the 21st century are minimally dependent on the scenario considered, yet they stabilize at very different levels for a long-term warming of 1.5°C versus 2°C (Section 3.3.9).\n\nThe ‘1.5°C or 2°C emissions scenarios’ presented in Chapter 2 are targeted to hold warming below 1.5°C or 2°C with a certain probability (generally two-thirds) over the course, or at the end, of the 21st century. These scenarios should be seen as the operationalization of 1.5°C or 2°C warmer worlds. However, when these emission scenarios are used to drive climate models, some of the resulting simulations lead to warming above these respective thresholds (typically with a probability of one-third, see Chapter 2 and Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter). This is due both to discrepancies between models and to internal climate variability. For this reason, the climate outcome for any of these scenarios, even those excluding an overshoot (see next point, C.), include some probability of reaching a global climate warming of more than 1.5°C or 2°C. Hence, a comprehensive assessment of climate risks associated with ‘1.5°C or 2°C climate scenarios’ needs to include consideration of higher levels of warming (e.g., up to 2.5°C to 3°C, see Chapter 2 and Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter).\n\nMost of the ‘1.5°C scenarios’, and some of the ‘2°C emissions scenarios’ presented in Chapter 2 include a temperature overshoot during the course of the 21st century. This means that median temperature projections under these scenarios exceed the target warming levels over the course of the century (typically 0.5°C–1°C higher than the respective target levels at most), before warming returns to below 1.5°C or 2°C by 2100. During the overshoot phase, impacts would therefore correspond to higher transient temperature increases than 1.5°C or 2°C. For this reason, impacts of transient responses at these higher warming levels are also partly addressed in Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter (on a 1.5°C warmer world), and some analyses for changes in extremes are also presented for higher levels of warming in Section 3.3 (Figures 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 3.10, 3.12 and 3.13). Most importantly, different overshoot scenarios may have very distinct impacts depending on (i) the peak temperature of the overshoot, (ii) the length of the overshoot period, and (iii) the associated rate of change in global temperature over the time period of the overshoot. While some of these issues are briefly addressed in Sections 3.3 and 3.6, and in the Cross-Chapter Box 8, the definition of overshoot and related questions will need to be more comprehensively addressed in the IPCC AR6 report.\n\nThe levels of global warming that are the focus of this report (1.5ºC and 2ºC) are measured relative to the pre-industrial period. This definition requires an agreement on the exact reference time period (for 0°C of warming) and the time frame over which the global warming is assessed, typically 20 to 30 years in length. As discussed in Chapter 1, a climate with 1.5ºC global warming is one in which temperatures averaged over a multi-decade time scale are 1.5°C above those in the pre-industrial reference period. Greater detail is provided in Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter. Inherent to this is the observation that the mean temperature of a ‘1.5°C warmer world’ can be regionally and temporally much higher (for e.g., with regional annual temperature extremes involving warming of more than 6°C; see Section 3.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter).\n\nThe interference of factors unrelated to greenhouse gases with mitigation pathways can strongly affect regional climate. For example, biophysical feedbacks from changes in land use and irrigation (e.g., Hirsch et al., 2017; Thiery et al., 2017)11, or projected changes in short-lived pollutants (e.g., Z. Wang et al., 2017)12, can have large influences on local temperatures and climate conditions. While these effects are not explicitly integrated into the scenarios developed in Chapter 2, they may affect projected changes in climate under 1.5°C of global warming. These issues are addressed in more detail in Section 3.6.2.2.\n\nThe assessment presented in the current chapter largely focuses on the analysis of transient responses in climate at 1.5°C versus 2°C and higher levels of global warming (see point A. above and Section 3.3). It generally uses the empirical scaling relationship (ESR) approach (Seneviratne et al., 2018c)13, also termed the ‘time sampling’ approach (James et al., 2017)14, which consists of sampling the response at 1.5°C and other levels of global warming from all available global climate model scenarios for the 21st century (e.g., Schleussner et al., 2016b; Seneviratne et al., 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017)15. The ESR approach focuses more on the derivation of a continuous relationship, while the term ‘time sampling’ is more commonly used when comparing a limited number of warming levels (e.g., 1.5°C versus 2°C). A similar approach in the case of regional climate model (RCM) simulations consists of sampling the RCM model output corresponding to the time frame at which the driving general circulation model (GCM) reaches the considered temperature level, for example, as done within IMPACT2C (Jacob and Solman, 2017), see16description in Vautard et al. (2014)17. As an alternative to the ESR or time sampling approach, pattern scaling may be used. Pattern scaling is a statistical approach that describes relationships of specific climate responses as a function of global temperature change. Some assessments presented in this chapter are based on this method. The disadvantage of pattern scaling, however, is that the relationship may not perfectly emulate the models’ responses at each location and for each global temperature level (James et al., 2017)18. Expert judgement is a third methodology that can be used to assess probable changes at 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming by combining changes that have been attributed to the observed time period (corresponding to warming of 1°C or less if assessed over a shorter period) with known projected changes at 3°C or 4°C above pre-industrial temperatures (Supplementary Material 3.SM.1). In order to assess effects induced by a 0.5°C difference in global warming, the historical record can be used at first approximation as a proxy, meaning that conditions are compared for two periods that have a 0.5ºC difference in GMST warming (such as 1991–2010 and 1960–1979, e.g., Schleussner et al., 2017)19. This in particular also applies to attributed changes in extremes since 1950 that were reported in the IPCC AR5 report (IPCC, 201320; see also 3.SM.1). Using observations, however, it is not possible to account for potential non-linear changes that could occur above 1°C of global warming or as 1.5°C of warming is reached.\n\nIn some cases, assessments of short-term stabilization responses are also presented, derived using a subset of model simulations that reach a given temperature limit by 2100, or driven by sea surface temperature (SST) values consistent with such scenarios. This includes new results from the ‘Half a degree additional warming, prognosis and projected impacts’ (HAPPI) project (Section 1.5.2; Mitchell et al., 2017)21. Notably, there is evidence that for some variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation extremes), responses after short-term stabilization (i.e., approximately equivalent to the RCP2.6 scenario) are very similar to the transient response of higher-emissions scenarios (Seneviratne et al., 2016, 2018c; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Tebaldi and Knutti, 2018)22. This is, however, less the case for mean precipitation (e.g., Pendergrass et al., 2015)23, for which other aspects of the emissions scenarios appear relevant.\n\nFor the assessment of long-term equilibrium stabilization responses, this chapter uses results from existing simulations where available (e.g., for sea level rise), although the available data for this type of projection is limited for many variables and scenarios and will need to be addressed in more depth in the IPCC AR6 report.\n\nSupplementary Material 3.SM.1 of this chapter includes further details of the climate models and associated simulations that were used to support the present assessment, as well as a background on detection and attribution approaches of relevance to assessing changes in climate at 1.5°C of global warming.\n\n3.2.2\n\nHow are Potential Impacts on Ecosystems Assessed at 1.5°C versus Higher Levels of Warming?\n\nConsidering that the impacts observed so far are for a global warming lower than 1.5°C (generally up to the 2006–2015 decade, i.e., for a global warming of 0.87°C or less; see above), direct information on the impacts of a global warming of 1.5°C is not yet available. The global distribution of observed impacts shown in AR5 (Cramer et al., 2014)24, however, demonstrates that methodologies now exist which are capable of detecting impacts on systems strongly influenced by factors (e.g., urbanization and human pressure in general) or where climate may play only a secondary role in driving impacts. Attribution of observed impacts to greenhouse gas forcing is more rarely performed, but a recent study (Hansen and Stone, 2016)25 shows that most of the detected temperature-related impacts that were reported in AR5 (Cramer et al., 2014)26 can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change, while the signals for precipitation-induced responses are more ambiguous.\n\nOne simple approach for assessing possible impacts on natural and managed systems at 1.5°C versus 2°C consists of identifying impacts of a global 0.5°C of warming in the observational record (e.g., Schleussner et al., 2017)27 assuming that the impacts would scale linearly for higher levels of warming (although this may not be appropriate). Another approach is to use conclusions from analyses of past climates combined with modelling of the relationships between climate drivers and natural systems (Box 3.3). A more complex approach relies on laboratory or field experiments (Dove et al., 2013; Bonal et al., 2016)28, which provide useful information on the causal effect of a few factors, which can be as diverse as climate, greenhouse gases (GHG), management practices, and biological and ecological variables, on specific natural systems that may have unusual physical and chemical characteristics (e.g., Fabricius et al., 2011; Allen et al., 2017)29. This last approach can be important in helping to develop and calibrate impact mechanisms and models through empirical experimentation and observation.\n\nRisks for natural and human systems are often assessed with impact models where climate inputs are provided by representative concentration pathway (RCP)-based climate projections. The number of studies projecting impacts at 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming has increased in recent times (see Section 3.4), even if the four RCP scenarios used in AR5 are not strictly associated with these levels of global warming. Several approaches have been used to extract the required climate scenarios, as described in Section 3.2.1. As an example, Schleussner et al. (2016b)30 applied a time sampling (or ESR) approach, described in Section 3.2.1, to estimate the differential effect of 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming on water availability and impacts on agriculture using an ensemble of simulations under the RCP8.5 scenario. As a further example using a different approach, Iizumi et al. (2017)31 derived a 1.5°C scenario from simulations with a crop model using an interpolation between the no-change (approximately 2010) conditions and the RCP2.6 scenario (with a global warming of 1.8°C in 2100), and they derived the corresponding 2°C scenario from RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 simulations in 2100. The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Integration and Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (ISIMIP2; Frieler et al., 2017)32 extended this approach to investigate a number of sectoral impacts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In most cases, risks are assessed by impact models coupled offline to climate models after bias correction, which may modify long-term trends (Grillakis et al., 2017)33.\n\nAssessment of local impacts of climate change necessarily involves a change in scale, such as from the global scale to that of natural or human systems (Frieler et al., 2017; Reyer et al., 2017d; Jacob et al., 2018)34. An appropriate method of downscaling (Supplementary Material 3.SM.1) is crucial for translating perspectives on 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming to scales and impacts relevant to humans and ecosystems. A major challenge associated with this requirement is the correct reproduction of the variance of local to regional changes, as well as the frequency and amplitude of extreme events (Vautard et al., 2014)35. In addition, maintaining physical consistency between downscaled variables is important but challenging (Frost et al., 2011)36.\n\nAnother major challenge relates to the propagation of the uncertainties at each step of the methodology, from the global forcings to the global climate and from regional climate to impacts at the ecosystem level, considering local disturbances and local policy effects. The risks for natural and human systems are the result of complex combinations of global and local drivers, which makes quantitative uncertainty analysis difficult. Such analyses are partly done using multimodel approaches, such as multi-climate and multi-impact models (Warszawski et al., 2013, 2014; Frieler et al., 2017)37. In the case of crop projections, for example, the majority of the uncertainty is caused by variation among crop models rather than by downscaling outputs of the climate models used (Asseng et al., 2013)38. Error propagation is an important issue for coupled models. Dealing correctly with uncertainties in a robust probabilistic model is particularly important when considering the potential for relatively small changes to affect the already small signal associated with 0.5°C of global warming (Supplementary Material 3.SM.1). The computation of an impact per unit of climatic change, based either on models or on data, is a simple way to present the probabilistic ecosystem response while taking into account the various sources of uncertainties (Fronzek et al., 2011)39.\n\nIn summary, in order to assess risks at 1.5°C and higher levels of global warming, several things need to be considered. Projected climates under 1.5°C of global warming differ depending on temporal aspects and emission pathways. Considerations include whether global temperature is (i) temporarily at this level (i.e., is a transient phase on its way to higher levels of warming), (ii) arrives at 1.5°C, with or without overshoot, after stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations, or (iii) is at this level as part of long-term climate equilibrium (complete only after several millennia). Assessments of impacts of 1.5°C of warming are generally based on climate simulations for these different possible pathways. Most existing data and analyses focus on transient impacts (i). Fewer data are available for dedicated climate model simulations that are able to assess pathways consistent with (ii), and very few data are available for the assessment of changes at climate equilibrium (iii). In some cases, inferences regarding the impacts of further warming of 0.5°C above present-day temperatures (i.e., 1.5°C of global warming) can also be drawn from observations of similar sized changes (0.5°C) that have occurred in the past, such as during the last 50 years. However, impacts can only be partly inferred from these types of observations, given the strong possibility of non-linear changes, as well as lag effects for some climate variables (e.g., sea level rise, snow and ice melt). For the impact models, three challenges are noted about the coupling procedure: (i) the bias correction of the climate model, which may modify the simulated response of the ecosystem, (ii) the necessity to downscale the climate model outputs to reach a pertinent scale for the ecosystem without losing physical consistency of the downscaled climate fields, and (iii) the necessity to develop an integrated study of the uncertainties.\n\n3.3\n\nGlobal and Regional Climate Changes and Associated Hazards\n\nShare\n\nThis section provides the assessment of changes in climate at 1.5°C of global warming relative to changes at higher global mean temperatures. Section 3.3.1 provides a brief overview of changes to global climate. Sections 3.3.2–3.3.11 provide assessments for specific aspects of the climate system, including regional assessments for temperature (Section 3.3.2) and precipitation (Section 3.3.3) means and extremes. Analyses of regional changes are based on the set of regions displayed in Figure 3.2. A synthesis of the main conclusions of this section is provided in Section 3.3.11. The section builds upon assessments from the IPCC AR5 WGI report (Bindoff et al., 2013a; Christensen et al., 2013; Collins et al., 2013; Hartmann et al., 2013; IPCC, 2013)40 and Chapter 3 of the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX; Seneviratne et al., 2012)41, as well as a substantial body of new literature related to projections of climate at 1.5°C and 2°C of warming above the pre-industrial period (e.g., Vautard et al., 2014; Fischer and Knutti, 2015; Schleussner et al., 2016b, 2017; Seneviratne et al., 2016, 2018c; Déqué et al., 2017; Maule et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2017, 2018a; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Zaman et al., 2017; Betts et al., 2018; Jacob et al., 2018; Kharin et al., 2018; Wehner et al., 2018b)42. The main assessment methods are as already detailed in Section 3.2.\n\n3.3.1\n\nGlobal Changes in Climate\n\nThere is high confidence that the increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST) has reached 0.87°C (±0.10°C likely range) above pre-industrial values in the 2006–2015 decade (Chapter 1). AR5 assessed that the globally averaged temperature (combined over land and ocean) displayed a warming of about 0.85°C [0.65°C to 1.06°C] during the period 1880–2012, with a large fraction of the detected global warming being attributed to anthropogenic forcing (Bindoff et al., 2013a; Hartmann et al., 2013; Stocker et al., 2013)45. While new evidence has highlighted that sampling biases and the choice of approaches used to estimate GMST (e.g., using water versus air temperature over oceans and using model simulations versus observations-based estimates) can affect estimates of GMST increase (Richardson et al., 2016;46 see also Supplementary Material 3.SM.2), the present assessment is consistent with that of AR5 regarding a detectable and dominant effect of anthropogenic forcing on observed trends in global temperature (also confirmed in Ribes et al., 2017)47. As highlighted in Chapter 1, human-induced warming reached approximately 1°C (±0.2°C likely range) in 2017. More background on recent observed trends in global climate is provided in the Supplementary Material 3.SM.2.\n\nA global warming of 1.5°C implies higher mean temperatures compared to during pre-industrial times in almost all locations, both on land and in oceans (high confidence) (Figure 3.3). In addition, a global warming of 2°C versus 1.5°C results in robust differences in the mean temperatures in almost all locations, both on land and in the ocean (high confidence). The land–sea contrast in warming is important and implies particularly large changes in temperature over land, with mean warming of more than 1.5°C in most land regions (high confidence; see Section 3.3.2 for more details). The largest increase in mean temperature is found in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (high confidence; Figure 3.3, see Section 3.3.2 for more details). Projections for precipitation are more uncertain, but they highlight robust increases in mean precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes at 1.5ºC global warming versus pre-industrial conditions, as well as at 2ºC global warming versus pre-industrial conditions (high confidence) (Figure 3.3). There are consistent but less robust signals when comparing changes in mean precipitation at 2ºC versus 1.5°C of global warming. Hence, it is assessed that there is medium confidence in an increase of mean precipitation in high-latitudes at 2ºC versus 1.5ºC of global warming (Figure 3.3). For droughts, changes in evapotranspiration and precipitation timing are also relevant (see Section 3.3.4). Figure 3.4 displays changes in temperature extremes (the hottest daytime temperature of the year, TXx, and the coldest night-time temperature of the year, TNn) and heavy precipitation (the annual maximum 5-day precipitation, Rx5day). These analyses reveal distinct patterns of changes, with the largest changes in TXx occurring on mid-latitude land and the largest changes in TNn occurring at high latitudes (both on land and in oceans). Differences in TXx and TNn compared to pre-industrial climate are robust at both global warming levels. Differences in TXx and TNn at 2°C versus 1.5°C of global warming are robust across most of the globe. Changes in heavy precipitation are less robust, but particularly strong increases are apparent at high latitudes as well as in the tropics at both 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming compared to pre-industrial conditions. The differences in heavy precipitation at 2ºC versus 1.5ºC global warming are generally not robust at grid-cell scale, but they display consistent increases in most locations (Figure 3.4). However, as addressed in Section 3.3.3, statistically significant differences are found in several large regions and when aggregated over the global land area. We thus assess that there is high confidence regarding global-scale differences in temperature means and extremes at 2°C versus 1.5°C global warming, and medium confidence regarding global-scale differences in precipitation means and extremes. Further analyses, including differences at 1.5°C and 2°C global warming versus 1°C (i.e., present-day) conditions are provided in the Supplementary Material 3.SM.2.\n\nThese projected changes at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming are consistent with the attribution of observed historical global trends in temperature and precipitation means and extremes (Bindoff et al., 2013a)50, as well as with some observed changes under the recent global warming of 0.5°C (Schleussner et al., 2017)51. These comparisons are addressed in more detail in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3. Attribution studies have shown that there is high confidence that anthropogenic forcing has had a detectable influence on trends in global warming (virtually certain since the mid-20th century), in land warming on all continents except Antarctica (likely since the mid-20th century), in ocean warming since 1970 (very likely), and in increases in hot extremes and decreases in cold extremes since the mid-20th century (very likely) (Bindoff et al., 2013a)52. In addition, there is medium confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to increases in mean precipitation at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere since the mid-20th century and to global-scale increases in heavy precipitation in land regions with sufficient observations over the same period (Bindoff et al., 2013a)53. Schleussner et al. (2017)54 showed, through analyses of recent observed tendencies, that changes in temperature extremes and heavy precipitation indices are detectable in observations for the 1991–2010 period compared with those for 1960–1979, with a global warming of approximately 0.5°C occurring between these two periods (high confidence). The observed tendencies over that time frame are thus consistent with attributed changes since the mid-20th century (high confidence).\n\nThe next sections assess changes in several different types of climate-related hazards. It should be noted that the different types of hazards are considered in isolation but some regions are projected to be affected by collocated and/or concomitant changes in several types of hazards (high confidence). Two examples are sea level rise and heavy precipitation in some regions, possibly leading together to more flooding, and droughts and heatwaves, which can together increase the risk of fire occurrence. Such events, also called compound events, may substantially increase risks in some regions (e.g., AghaKouchak et al., 2014; Van Den Hurk et al., 2015; Martius et al., 2016; Zscheischler et al., 2018)55. A detailed assessment of physically-defined compound events was not possible as part of this report, but aspects related to overlapping multi-sector risks are highlighted in Sections 3.4 and 3.5.\n\n3.3.2\n\nRegional Temperatures on Land, Including Extremes\n\n3.3.2.1\n\nObserved and attributed changes in regional temperature means and extremes\n\nWhile the quality of temperature measurements obtained through ground observational networks tends to be high compared to that of measurements for other climate variables (Seneviratne et al., 2012)56, it should be noted that some regions are undersampled. Cowtan and Way (2014)57 highlighted issues regarding undersampling, which is most problematic at the poles and over Africa, and which may lead to biases in estimated changes in GMST (see also Supplementary Material 3.SM.2 and Chapter 1). This undersampling also affects the confidence of assessments regarding regional observed and projected changes in both mean and extreme temperature. Despite this partly limited coverage, the attribution chapter of AR5 (Bindoff et al., 2013a)58 and recent papers (e.g., Sun et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2018)59 assessed that, over every continental region and in many sub-continental regions, anthropogenic influence has made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century.\n\nBased on the AR5 and SREX, as well as recent literature (see Supplementary Material 3.SM), there is high confidence (very likely) that there has been an overall decrease in the number of cold days and nights and an overall increase in the number of warm days and nights at the global scale on land. There is also high confidence (likely) that consistent changes are detectable on the continental scale in North America, Europe and Australia. There is high confidence that these observed changes in temperature extremes can be attributed to anthropogenic forcing (Bindoff et al., 2013a)60. As highlighted in Section 3.2, the observational record can be used to assess past changes associated with a global warming of 0.5°C. Schleussner et al. (2017)61 used this approach to assess observed changes in extreme indices for the 1991–2010 versus the 1960–1979 period, which corresponds to just about a 0.5°C GMST difference in the observed record (based on the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP) dataset, Hansen et al., 2010)62. They found that substantial changes due to 0.5°C of warming are apparent for indices related to hot and cold extremes, as well as for the Warm Spell Duration Indicator (WSDI). In particular, they identified that one-quarter of the land has experienced an intensification of hot extremes (maximum temperature on the hottest day of the year, TXx) by more than 1°C and a reduction in the intensity of cold extremes by at least 2.5°C (minimum temperature on the coldest night of the year, TNn). In addition, the same study showed that half of the global land mass has experienced changes in WSDI of more than six days, as well as an emergence of extremes outside the range of natural variability (Schleussner et al., 2017)63. Analyses from Schleussner et al. (2017)64 for temperature extremes are provided in the Supplementary Material 3.SM, Figure 3.SM.6. It should be noted that assessments of attributed changes in the IPCC SREX and AR5 reports were generally provided since 1950, for time frames also approximately corresponding to a 0.5°C global warming (3.SM).\n\n3.3.2.2\n\nProjected changes in regional temperature means and extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming\n\nThere are several lines of evidence available for providing a regional assessment of projected changes in temperature means and extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming (see Section 3.2). These include: analyses of changes in extremes as a function of global warming based on existing climate simulations using the empirical scaling relationship (ESR) and variations thereof (e.g., Schleussner et al., 2017; Dosio and Fischer, 2018; Seneviratne et al., 2018c65; see Section 3.2 for details about the methodology); dedicated simulations of 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming, for instance based on the Half a degree additional warming, prognosis and projected impacts (HAPPI) experiment (Mitchell et al., 2017)66 or other model simulations (e.g., Dosio et al., 2018; Kjellström et al., 2018)67; and analyses based on statistical pattern scaling approaches (e.g., Kharin et al., 2018)68. These different lines of evidence lead to qualitatively consistent results regarding changes in temperature means and extremes at 1.5°C of global warming compared to the pre-industrial climate and 2°C of global warming.\n\nThere are statistically significant differences in temperature means and extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming, both in the global average (Schleussner et al., 2016b; Dosio et al., 2018; Kharin et al., 2018)69, as well as in most land regions (high confidence) (Wartenburger et al., 2017; Seneviratne et al., 2018c; Wehner et al., 2018b)70. Projected temperatures over oceans display significant increases in means and extremes between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming (Figures 3.3 and 3.4). A general background on the available evidence on regional changes in temperature means and extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming is provided in the Supplementary Material 3.SM.2. As an example, Figure 3.5 shows regionally-based analyses for the IPCC SREX regions (see Figure 3.2) of changes in the temperature of hot extremes as a function of global warming (corresponding analyses for changes in the temperature of cold extremes are provided in the Supplementary Material 3.SM.2). As demonstrated in these analyses, the mean response of the intensity of temperature extremes in climate models to changes in the global mean temperature is approximately linear and independent of the considered emissions scenario (Seneviratne et al., 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017)71. Nonetheless, in the case of changes in the number of days exceeding a given threshold, changes are approximately exponential, with higher increases for rare events (Fischer and Knutti, 2015; Kharin et al., 2018)72; see also Figure 3.6. This behaviour is consistent with a linear increase in absolute temperature for extreme threshold exceedances (Whan et al., 2015)73.\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.3.1, there is an important land–sea warming contrast, with stronger warming on land (see also Christensen et al., 2013; Collins et al., 2013; Seneviratne et al., 2016)74, which implies that regional warming on land is generally more than 1.5°C even when mean global warming is at 1.5°C. As highlighted in Seneviratne et al. (2016)75, this feature is generally stronger for temperature extremes (Figures 3.4 and 3.5; Supplementary Material 3.SM.2 ). For differences in regional temperature extremes at a mean global warming of 1.5°C versus 2°C, that is, a difference of 0.5ºC in global warming, this implies differences of as much as 1°C–1.5°C in some locations, which are two to three times larger than the differences in global mean temperature. For hot extremes, the strongest warming is found in central and eastern North America, central and southern Europe, the Mediterranean, western and central Asia, and southern Africa (Figures 3.4 and 3.5) (medium confidence). These regions are all characterized by a strong soil-moisture–temperature coupling and projected increased dryness (Vogel et al., 2017)76, which leads to a reduction in evaporative cooling in the projections. Some of these regions also show a wide range of responses to temperature extremes, in particular central Europe and central North America, owing to discrepancies in the representation of the underlying processes in current climate models (Vogel et al., 2017)77. For mean temperature and cold extremes, the strongest warming is found in the northern high-latitude regions (high confidence). This is due to substantial ice-snow-albedo-temperature feedbacks (Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4, middle) related to the known ‘polar amplification’ mechanism (e.g., IPCC, 2013; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013)78.\n\nFigure 3.7 displays maps of changes in the number of hot days (NHD) at 1.5°C and 2°C of GMST increase. Maps of changes in the number of frost days (FD) can be found in Supplementary Material 3.SM.2. These analyses reveal clear patterns of changes between the two warming levels, which are consistent with analysed changes in heatwave occurrence (e.g., Dosio et al., 2018)79. For the NHD, the largest differences are found in the tropics (high confidence), owing to the low interannual temperature variability there (Mahlstein et al., 2011)80, although absolute changes in hot temperature extremes tended to be largest at mid-latitudes (high confidence) (Figures 3.4 and 3.5). Extreme heatwaves are thus projected to emerge earliest in the tropics and to become widespread in these regions already at 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). These results are consistent with other recent assessments. Coumou and Robinson (2013)81 found that 20% of the global land area, centred in low-latitude regions, is projected to experience highly unusual monthly temperatures during Northern Hemisphere summers at 1.5°C of global warming, with this number nearly doubling at 2°C of global warming.\n\nFigure 3.8 features an objective identification of ‘hotspots’ / key risks in temperature indices subdivided by region, based on the ESR approach applied to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations (Wartenburger et al., 2017)82. Note that results based on the HAPPI multimodel experiment (Mitchell et al., 2017)83 are similar (Seneviratne et al., 2018c)84. The considered regions follow the classification used in Figure 3.2 and also include the global land areas. Based on these analyses, the following can be stated: significant changes in responses are found in all regions for most temperature indices, with the exception of i) the diurnal temperature range (DTR) in most regions, ii) ice days (ID), frost days (FD) and growing season length (GSL) (mostly in regions where differences are zero, because, e.g., there are no ice or frost days), iii) the minimum yearly value of the maximum daily temperature (TXn) in very few regions. In terms of the sign of the changes, warm extremes display an increase in intensity, frequency and duration (e.g., an increase in the temperature of the hottest day of the year (TXx) in all regions, an increase in the proportion of days with a maximum temperature above the 90th percentile of Tmax (TX90p) in all regions, and an increase in the length of the WSDI in all regions), while cold extremes display a decrease in intensity, frequency and duration (e.g., an increase in the temperature of the coldest night of the year (TNn) in all regions, a decrease in the proportion of days with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile of Tmin (TN10p), and a decrease in the cold spell duration index (CSDI) in all regions). Hence, while warm extremes are intensified, cold extremes become less intense in affected regions.\n\nOverall, large increases in hot extremes occur in many densely inhabited regions (Figure 3.5), for both warming scenarios compared to pre-industrial and present-day climate, as well as for 2°C versus 1.5°C GMST warming. For instance, Dosio et al. (2018)85 concluded, based on a modelling study, that 13.8% of the world population would be exposed to ‘severe heatwaves’ at least once every 5 years under 1.5°C of global warming, with a threefold increase (36.9%) under 2°C of GMST warming, corresponding to a difference of about 1.7 billion people between the two global warming levels. They also concluded that limiting global warming to 1.5°C would result in about 420 million fewer people being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves, and about 65 million fewer people being exposed to ‘exceptional heatwaves’ compared to conditions at 2ºC GMST warming. However, changes in vulnerability were not considered in their study. For this reason, we assess that there is medium confidence in their conclusions.\n\nIn summary, there is high confidence that there are robust and statistically significant differences in the projected temperature means and extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming, both in the global average and in nearly all land regions (likely). Further, the observational record reveals that substantial changes due to a 0.5°C GMST warming are apparent for indices related to hot and cold extremes, as well as for the WSDI (likely). A global warming of 2°C versus 1.5°C would lead to more frequent and more intense hot extremes in all land regions , as well as longer warm spells, affecting many densely inhabited regions (very likely). The strongest increases in the frequency of hot extremes are projected for the rarest events (very likely). On the other hand, cold extremes would become less intense and less frequent, and cold spells would be shorter (very likely). Temperature extremes on land would generally increase more than the global average temperature (very likely). Temperature increases of extreme hot days in mid-latitudes are projected to be up to two times the increase in GMST, that is, 3ºC at 1.5ºC GMST warming (high confidence). The highest levels of warming for extreme hot days are expected to occur in central and eastern North America, central and southern Europe, the Mediterranean, western and central Asia, and southern Africa (medium confidence). These regions have a strong soil-moisture-temperature coupling in common as well as increased dryness and, consequently, a reduction in evaporative cooling. However, there is a substantial range in the representation of these processes in models, in particular in central Europe and central North America (medium confidence). The coldest nights in high latitudes warm by as much as 1.5°C for a 0.5°C increase in GMST, corresponding to a threefold stronger warming (high confidence). NHD shows the largest differences between 1.5°C and 2°C in the tropics, because of the low interannual temperature variability there (high confidence); extreme heatwaves are thus projected to emerge earliest in these regions, and they are expected to become widespread already at 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). Limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C could result in around 420 million fewer people being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves, and about 65 million fewer people being exposed to exceptional heatwaves, assuming constant vulnerability (medium confidence).\n\n3.3.3\n\nRegional Precipitation, Including Heavy Precipitation and Monsoons\n\nThis section addresses regional changes in precipitation on land, with a focus on heavy precipitation and consideration of changes to the key features of monsoons.\n\n3.3.3.1\n\nObserved and attributed changes in regional precipitation\n\nObserved global changes in the water cycle, including precipitation, are more uncertain than observed changes in temperature (Hartmann et al., 2013; Stocker et al., 2013)95. There is high confidence that mean precipitation over the mid-latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere has increased since 1951 (Hartmann et al., 2013)96. For other latitudinal zones, area-averaged long-term positive or negative trends have low confidence because of poor data quality, incomplete data or disagreement amongst available estimates (Hartmann et al., 2013)97. There is, in particular, low confidence regarding observed trends in precipitation in monsoon regions, according to the SREX report (Seneviratne et al., 2012)98 and AR5 (Hartmann et al., 2013)99, as well as more recent publications (Singh et al., 2014; Taylor et al., 2017; Bichet and Diedhiou, 2018;100 see Supplementary Material 3.SM.2).\n\nFor heavy precipitation, AR5 (Hartmann et al., 2013)101 assessed that observed trends displayed more areas with increases than decreases in the frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation (likely). In addition, for land regions where observational coverage is sufficient for evaluation, it was assessed that there is medium confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to a global-scale intensification of heavy precipitation over the second half of the 20th century (Bindoff et al., 2013a)102.\n\nRegarding changes in precipitation associated with global warming of 0.5°C, the observed record suggests that increases in precipitation extremes can be identified for annual maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1day) and consecutive 5-day precipitation (RX5day) for GMST changes of this magnitude (Supplementary Material 3.SM.2, Figure 3.SM.7; Schleussner et al., 2017)103. It should be noted that assessments of attributed changes in the IPCC SREX and AR5 reports were generally provided since 1950, for time frames also approximately corresponding to a 0.5°C global warming (3.SM).\n\n3.3.3.2\n\nProjected changes in regional precipitation at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming\n\nFigure 3.3 in Section 3.3.1 summarizes the projected changes in mean precipitation at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming. Both warming levels display robust differences in mean precipitation compared to the pre-industrial period. Regarding differences at 2°C vs 1.5°C global warming, some regions are projected to display changes in mean precipitation at 2°C compared with that at 1.5°C of global warming in the CMIP5 multimodel average, such as decreases in the Mediterranean area, including southern Europe, the Arabian Peninsula and Egypt, or increases in high latitudes. The results, however, are less robust across models than for mean temperature. For instance, Déqué et al. (2017)104 investigated the impact of 2°C of global warming on precipitation over tropical Africa and found that average precipitation does not show a significant response, owing to two phenomena: (i) the number of days with rain decreases whereas the precipitation intensity increases, and (ii) the rainy season occurs later during the year, with less precipitation in early summer and more precipitation in late summer. The results from Déqué et al. (2017)105 regarding insignificant differences between 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios for tropical Africa are consistent with the results presented in Figure 3.3. For Europe, recent studies (Vautard et al., 2014; Jacob et al., 2018; Kjellström et al., 2018)106 have shown that 2°C of global warming was associated with a robust increase in mean precipitation over central and northern Europe in winter but only over northern Europe in summer, and with decreases in mean precipitation in central/southern Europe in summer. Precipitation changes reaching 20% have been projected for the 2°C scenario (Vautard et al., 2014)107 and are overall more pronounced than with 1.5°C of global warming (Jacob et al., 2018; Kjellström et al., 2018)108.\n\nRegarding changes in heavy precipitation, Figure 3.9 displays projected changes in the 5-day maximum precipitation (Rx5day) as a function of global temperature increase, using a similar approach as in Figure 3.5. Further analyses are available in Supplementary Material 3.SM.2. These analyses show that projected changes in heavy precipitation are more uncertain than those for temperature extremes. However, the mean response of model simulations is generally robust and linear (see also Fischer et al., 2014; Seneviratne et al., 2016)109. As observed for temperature extremes, this response is also mostly independent of the considered emissions scenario (e.g., RCP2.6 versus RCP8.5; see also Section 3.2). This feature appears to be specific to heavy precipitation, possibly due to a stronger coupling with temperature, as the scaling of projections of mean precipitation changes with global warming shows some scenario dependency (Pendergrass et al., 2015)110.\n\nRobust changes in heavy precipitation compared to pre-industrial conditions are found at both 1.5°C and 2°C global warming (Figure 3.4). This is also consistent with results for, for example, the European continent, although different indices for heavy precipitation changes have been analysed. Based on regional climate simulations, Vautard et al. (2014)111 found a robust increase in heavy precipitation everywhere in Europe and in all seasons, except southern Europe in summer at 2°C versus 1971–2000. Their findings are consistent with those of Jacob et al. (2014)112, who used more recent downscaled climate scenarios (EURO-CORDEX) and a higher resolution (12 km), but the change is not so pronounced in Teichmann et al. (2018)113. There is consistent agreement in the direction of change in heavy precipitation at 1.5°C of global warming over much of Europe, compared to 1971–2000 (Jacob et al., 2018)114.\n\nDifferences in heavy precipitation are generally projected to be small between 1.5°C and 2°C GMST warming (Figure 3.4 and 3.9 and Supplementary Material 3.SM.2, Figure 3.SM.10). Some regions display substantial increases, for instance southern Asia, but generally in less than two-thirds of the CMIP5 models (Figure 3.4, Supplementary Material 3.SM.2, Figure 3.SM.10). Wartenburger et al. (2017)115 suggested that there are substantial differences in heavy precipitation in eastern Asia at 1.5°C versus 2°C. Overall, while there is variation among regions, the global tendency is for heavy precipitation to increase at 2°C compared with at 1.5°C (see e.g., Fischer and Knutti, 2015116 and Kharin et al., 2018117 , as illustrated in Figure 3.10 from this chapter; see also Betts et al., 2018)118.\n\nAR5 assessed that the global monsoon, aggregated over all monsoon systems, is likely to strengthen, with increases in its area and intensity, while the monsoon circulation weakens (Christensen et al., 2013)119. A few publications provide more recent evaluations of projections of changes in monsoons for high-emission scenarios (e.g., Jiang and Tian, 2013; Jones and Carvalho, 2013; Sylla et al., 2015, 2016120; Supplementary Material 3.SM.2 ). However, scenarios at 1.5°C or 2°C global warming would involve a substantially smaller radiative forcing than those assessed in AR5 and these more recent studies, and there appears to be no specific assessment of changes in monsoon precipitation at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming in the literature. Consequently, the current assessment is that there is low confidence regarding changes in monsoons at these lower global warming levels, as well as regarding differences in monsoon responses at 1.5°C versus 2°C.\n\nSimilar to Figure 3.8, Figure 3.11 features an objective identification of ‘hotspots’ / key risks outlined in heavy precipitation indices subdivided by region, based on the approach by Wartenburger et al. (2017)121. The considered regions follow the classification used in Figure 3.2 and also include global land areas. Hotspots displaying statistically significant changes in heavy precipitation at 1.5°C versus 2°C global warming are located in high-latitude (Alaska/western Canada, eastern Canada/Greenland/Iceland, northern Europe, northern Asia) and high-elevation (e.g., Tibetan Plateau) regions, as well as in eastern Asia (including China and Japan) and in eastern North America. Results are less consistent for other regions. Note that analyses for meteorological drought (lack of precipitation) are provided in Section 3.3.4.\n\nIn summary, observations and projections for mean and heavy precipitation are less robust than for temperature means and extremes (high confidence).
