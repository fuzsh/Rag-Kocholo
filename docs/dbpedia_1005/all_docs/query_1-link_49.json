Forecast of changes in water temperature for the next 10 days. Statistics by months for recent years. Information about the neighboring resorts. Weather forecast in Rodrigues for a week.\n\nWater temperature in Rodrigues right now\n\ndata updated 9 minutes ago\n\n23.1°C\n\nyesterday: 22.9°C\n\na week ago: 23.3°C\n\nTrend: slow drop\n\nToday water temperature in Rodrigues is 23.1°C. It is the most comfortable swimming water in any body of water, especially on a hot day. This temperature range is recognized as the most optimal for prolonged bathing. In any case, the general weather is also important. So, the air temperature at the same time will reach 21°C.\n\nAnalysis and forecast\n\nThe water temperature today roughly corresponds to the average value on this day in recent years. Its value has rise over the last week, but has drop compared to 20 days ago. Exactly a year ago, on this day, the water temperature in this location was 23°C. Water temperature range in Rodrigues in August is from 21 to 25 degrees.\n\nAccording to our forecast, in the coming days, the water temperature value in Rodrigues will slightly drop and in 10 days it will be 22.1°C.\n\nTable of water temperature values in Rodrigues\n\nDayFact*Average**Forecast***\n\nAug 324.1°C23.3°CAug 424.4°C24.3°CAug 523.9°C24.0°CAug 622.9°C23.5°CAug 723.4°C23.3°CAug 823.7°C23.3°CAug 922.9°C23.5°CAug 1023.1°C23.8°CAug 1124.0°C23.3°CAug 1223.0°C22.3°CAug 1323.3°C22.6°CAug 1423.3°C22.6°CAug 1523.8°C23.1°CAug 1623.5°C22.8°CAug 1723.5°C22.8°C\n\n* Fact - Actual value of water temperature\n\n** Average - Average water temperature on this day in past years\n\n*** Forecast - Our forecast for the water temperature\n\nActual nearshore temperatures may vary by several degrees from the indicated values. This is noticeable after heavy rain or after prolonged periods of strong winds. Some downstream winds cause cold, deep waters to replace surface waters that have been warmed by the sun.\n\nTo develop a forecast, we use our own mathematical model, which takes into account the current change in water temperature, historical data and the main weather trends, wind strength and direction, air temperature in each specific region. We also take into account data for other resorts in Mauritius.\n\nVelika, Greece | © Moja Grcka\n\nAnnual graph of average water temperature change in Rodrigues\n\nWater temperature in Rodrigues by month\n\nRodrigues is located in the Arctic Circle, at latitude 19 degrees.
