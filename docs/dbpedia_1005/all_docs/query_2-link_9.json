        "text": "Channel your inner fish and jump into Rodrigues’ clear blue waters – you won’t be disappointed. This is the perfect place for snorkelers and divers of all abilities to soak up everything on offer underneath the island’s lapping waves. For those who just want to strap on a mask and flippers,Trou d’Argent is a popular snorkelling spot, complete with coral gardens, angel, parrot and butterfly fish, as well as gorgeous rock formations.\n\nFor those who prefer to go a little deeper, the outer reefs of Rodrigues are a haven for divers. Keep an eye out, too – this is where you’ll have your best chance to tick off some of our ocean’s bigger occupants from the bucket list. Our founder, Ludo, dived at the Cathedral on the east coast and saw turtles, rays and reef sharks. He lost a few air bubbles when he spotted the sharks. There are other sites, too, where you can see barracuda, eels and dolphins, all easily accessible from anywhere on the island: Diable, Passe l’Hermitage and St. François to name just a few.\n\nPrefer diving at night? Or at a wreck? You can do both on Rodrigues, sometimes at the same time. We stuck to the days but visitors have told us about encounters with lobsters, crabs and octopuses, all of which tend to come out from their hiding places when the sun goes down. We’re sure you know this, but diving requires proper training and certification. There are a number of centres on the island that offer courses and guiding – for whatever type of diver, at whatever level.\n\nRodrigues’ natural beauty isn’t confined to its waters, though. The hiking available on the island is another way for visitors to drink in their surroundings and gawp at the diversity of landscapes on offer – whatever their level.\n\nOne of our favourite trails is Mount Limon, the highest point in Rodrigues. In order to get there, you walk through lush shaded forests, before emerging to panoramic views of the surrounding countryside and coastline. You’ll probably be puffing by the time you reach the top – our founder, Ludo, certainly was – but it’s more than worth the effort.\n\nThere are other, more sedate options as well. The trail along the southern coastline from Port Sud-Est to Trou D’Argent is another lovely spot, traversing cliffs, beaches and lagoons. Don’t worry about overheating, either, as you’ll have the option to refresh yourself with a dip at any number of swimming spots along the way. There’s also a nature reserve stuffed full of endemic flora and fauna at the Vallée de Ferney, and a steep, challenging hike up the rugged slopes of the Grand Montagne trail. Trust us, though, only take this one on if you’ve not over-indulged at the cocktail bar the night before.\n\nWhatever you’re after from your hiking adventures, Rodrigues will have the answer. Its unspoiled environment, continually wonderful views and diversity of trails make it a paradise for anyone who wants to venture into the outdoors – just make sure to be prepared!\n\nRodrigues has been pioneering conservation techniques for years, creating a series of nature reserves and implementing policies with the island’s natural environment at their heart. The result? A wildlife paradise where a number of remarkable creatures roam freely – we’ve drawn up a list of some of our favourites below.\n\nThe Rodrigues Warbler is a small songbird with a big pair of lungs. We heard it before we saw it, its melodious song unmistakable in the island’s thick forests. Easier to spot is the brightly coloured Rodrigues Fody, often visible in the fields that dot the landscape. You’ll no doubt see some of the island fruit bats, too, which hang upside down from the trees by day, before dispersing pollen and seeds by night. Away from the skies, the Rodrigues Giant Tortoise is a critically endangered member of the species that is endemic to the island and often over a century old. There’s no shortage of lizard species, either, with the excellently named Rodrigues Skink leading the charge with its unique sheen and bright blue tail – this is the only place on earth where you’ll be able to see it. There are geckos and a non-venomous Round Island Boa snake, too, as well as everything underwater that we’ve mentioned before. Seeing these creatures in their natural habitat really is a sight to behold – we can’t wait for you to do the same.\n\nLike some of its Indian Ocean neighbours, Rodrigues’ cuisine is a reflection of its geographical location and cultural diversity. The island’s main dishes blend flavours from Africa, Malagasy, India and Europe to produce food that’s often like nothing we’ve ever eaten before – and always delicious.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Rodrigues’ seafood is a bit of a show-stealer. Fish, octopus, crab and shrimp are often found on the menu, with the island’s tomato-based seafood stew, rougaille, as one of our favourites. If it’s turf you prefer to surf, though, Rodrigues is curiously famous for its sausages, which are smoked with a distinctive flavour and often added to stews and rice. These little “saussices fumées” are delicious; so much so that, when our founder, Ludo, visited the island, there was almost a national pork shortage. Poultry and meat are often added to curries, with a number of treats available for those with a sweet tooth.\n\nAs with Rodrigues’ older brother across the water, Mauritius, street food and stalls play a huge part in island life. Dholl puri is our personal highlight, served as a flatbread with split peas to accompany curries, pickles and chutneys. The gateau piment – meaning chilli cake – is another taste of authentic island life, its deep-friend lentil ingredients perfectly balanced with local spices.\n\nAs you can probably tell, we often still think about Rodrigues’ food at Love To Explore HQ and, for any foody travellers out there, we think you’ll understand why."
