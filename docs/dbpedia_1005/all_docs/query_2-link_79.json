        "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Neighborhoods in Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro state remained flooded Monday more than a day after torrential rains that killed at least 12 people.\n\nThe heavy downpour wreaked havoc over the weekend, flooding peoples’ homes, a hospital, the metro line in the city of Rio and a main freeway section, Avenida Brasil.\n\nSome people drowned and were killed in landslides, while at least three died after being electrocuted. Eighteen towns across the state remained at “high” risk of landslides, according to civil defense officials.\n\nThe floods were particularly devastating in Rio’s northern peripheries, some of the metropolitan’s poorest areas.\n\n“We feel like animals. It’s not normal to live like this,” Heloisa Regina, 55, said as she surveyed her flooded bar and home in Duque de Caxias, a city to the north of Rio where more than 100 millimeters (3.9 inches) of rain fell in 24 hours.\n\nRegina spent the night trying to sleep on a pool table, wondering how she was going to pay to repair the damage to the bar she has owned for 30 years. “We’ve lost everything,” she said.\n\nResidents waded through waist-high water Monday to navigate streets in Duque de Caxias. Others climbed on roofs and called for help as helicopters flew overhead, according to video footage from Brazil’s Globo television network.\n\nFirefighters were searching for a woman who disappeared after her car fell into the Botas River in Rio’s Belford Roxo neighborhood.\n\nAround 2,400 military personnel from Rio’s firefighters corps were mobilized over the weekend and used ambulances, boats, drones and aircraft to rescue residents and to monitor affected areas.\n\nAuthorities intervened in over 200 incidents due to the flooding across the state, according to a statement from Rio’s civil defense. But some people accused authorities of negligence.\n\n“We are completely abandoned,” Duque de Caxias resident Eliana Vieira Krauss, 54, charged. “Nothing has improved” since similar floods more than a decade ago, the nursing assistant said.\n\nKrauss carried her 80-year-old disabled father-in-law to her sister-in-law’s home herself. “The water was almost reaching his bed. If he had turned around and fallen, he would have drowned,” Krauss said.\n\nRio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes on Sunday declared an emergency and urged people to not force their way through flooded areas and to avoid disrupting rescue and recovery efforts.\n\nModerate to heavy rain, lightning and gusts of wind were forecast Monday afternoon. Rio’s civil defense advised people not to swim in lakes or the sea, and when at home to stay away from sockets, windows and metal doors.\n\nFloods in the basement of the Ronaldo Gazolla Municipal Hospital led to power cuts that were resolved by Sunday, but all appointments at the hospital have been delayed by 15 days, Rio Health Secretary Daniel Soranz said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nBrazil’s National Institute of Meteorology had warned Thursday of the potential for heavy rain in Rio, Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais due to a combination of heat, humidity and areas of low pressure in the atmosphere.\n\nIn February 2023, heavy rain caused flooding and landslides that killed at least 48 people in Sao Paulo state. In September, flooding from a cyclone in southern Brazil killed at least 31 people and left 2,300 homeless.\n\nAt the same time, the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has faced severe drought. Scientists say extreme weather is happening more frequently due to human-caused climate change, and 2023 was the hottest year on record.\n\nNízia Maria Geralda Francisco, 70, spent Saturday night on the roof where she was taken by neighbors to escape the flooding of her home in Belford Roxo.\n\nWhen she returned the next morning, she found her belongings drenched in muddy water, including a wardrobe and her documents. “It’s hard to stay in this place, but it’s ours. We don’t have any money to leave,” Geralda Francisco said, crying.\n\n“Humans are destroying nature, so this is what we’re getting in return,” she added.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of climate issues and the environment: https://apnews.com/climate-and-environment"
