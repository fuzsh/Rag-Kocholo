        "text": "Mauritius is a group of islands in the Indian Ocean and is located east of Madagascar and around 2200 km south of the equator. The tropical climate is very warm with an annual average of 27 degrees, but has only a few really tropical and humid months. The climate is significantly influenced by its exposed location, as warm water and the trade winds contribute to warm temperatures and a humid climate all year round. At the same time, cooler breezes are brought in from the Indian Ocean. This results in a pleasant and relatively stable climate, which is particularly attractive for tourists.\n\nTemperatures are constant and moderate, with noticeable but not too great differences between the seasons. The average daily maximum temperatures are between 23 and 29 degrees Celsius all year round, with the summer months from December to April being slightly warmer than the winter months from May to November. This also gives rise to the two main seasons: the warm and humid season from December to April and the cooler and drier season from May to November. During the warm season, occasional cyclones can occur, which can bring strong winds and heavy rainfall. It is therefore noticeably more pleasant for tourists towards the middle of the year.\n\nThe amount of precipitation varies only slightly depending on the region, with the coastal areas tending to receive more rainfall than the interior or the plains in the lee of the mountains. The number of rainy days is only significantly lower in October and November, but from May to November the rain showers are much shorter. At higher altitudes, such as the Massif Central, there is also more rainfall.\n\nHours of sunshine per day\n\nRain days per month\n\nPrecipitation in mm/day\n\nWater temperature\n\nRelative humidity in %\n\nAbsolute humidity in g/m³\n\nThe tropical climate also favors diverse and lush vegetation, including rainforests, mangroves and fertile plantations. The rich biodiversity and picturesque landscapes with pleasant summer temperatures make Mauritius a popular destination for nature lovers and beach vacationers alike. The average water temperature of 25 degrees is also ideal for swimming all year round. The best time to visit is from September to November.\n\nThe warmest and rainiest part of the country is the remote island of Rodrigues. Pamplemousses in the north of the main island is the coolest.\n\nTemperature records of the last 70 years\n\nThe hottest temperature measured from 1954 to February 2024 was reported by the St. Brandon Raphael Island weather station. In January 2020, the record temperature of 35.6 °C was reported here. The hottest meteorological summer from December to February, based on all 4 weather stations in Mauritius , was recorded in 2016 with an average temperature of 28.6 °C. This average temperature will normally be measured every four to six hours, thus also including the nights. Normally, this value is 27.2 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe coldest day in these 70 years was reported by the Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Airport weather station. Here the temperature dropped to 12.4 °C in September 2013. Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Airport lies at an altitude of 57 meters above sea level. The coldest winter (June to August) was in 1968 with an average temperature of 22.2 °C. In Mauritius, it is usual to have about 1.0 degrees more at 23.2 °C for this three-month period.\n\nThe most precipitation fell in February 1987. With 26.7 mm per day, the Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Airport weather station recorded the highest monthly average of the last 70 years.\n\nRecord months last year\n\nWe compared the record values of the past months with those of the same months in previous years. We used the same criteria to examine the respective maximum and minimum values in the categories of average temperature, precipitation, hours of sunshine and the maximum and minimum temperatures measured throughout the country. We have listed all measured values that have not been reached in Mauritius for 10 or more years. However, with only 3 long-term extremes, there are remarkably few outliers in Mauritius. There are far more anomalies in many other countries.\n\nWith 10.67 liters of precipitation in 2024, February was the wettest in 17 years (15.08 l/m² in 2007).\n\nWith 7.53 hours of sunshine per day in November 2023, there was less sunshine than in any November in the last 17 years (5.93 hours in 2006).\n\nWith just 0.85 liters of precipitation in 2023, September was drier than it had been for 29 years (0.78 l/m² in 1994).\n\nThe most recent months after February 2024 are not yet available here. We only calculate climatic comparisons after a large number of weather stations on a continent have checked and published their data.\n\nLong-term development of temperatures from 1997 - 2023\n\nIn contrast to single record values, long-term development cannot simply be brought about by all weather stations in the country. Both the number and the locations are constantly changing. An average value would give a distorted result. If several measuring stations in particularly cold mountain or coastal regions are added in one year, the average would decrease as a result of this alone. If a station fails during the summer or winter months, it does not provide any values and distorts the average again. The subsequent long-term development was therefore reduced to only 2 measuring points in order to have comparable data over as long a period as possible.\n\nIn the years 1997 to 2023, there were only these 2 weather stations in the whole country, which reported continuous temperature values (Seewoosagur Ramgoolamort, Rodrigues Island). From these weather reports, we have created a long-term development that shows the monthly average temperatures. The hottest month in this entire period was March 2016 at 28.0 °C. August 2005 was the coldest month with an average temperature of 21.3 °C.\n\nThe average annual temperature was about 24.2 °C in the years after 1997 and about 25.0 °C in the last years before 2023. So in less than 27 years, it has increased by about 0.8 °C. This trend only applies to the selected 2 weather stations in Mauritius. A considerably more comprehensive evaluation of global warming has been provided separately.\n\nData basis and methodology\n\nThe data from the individual measuring stations are based on the archives of the German Weather Service, individual values averaged and supplemented by own elements. In order to determine a representative national average, average values were first calculated for each part of the country, which were then summarized at the national level."
