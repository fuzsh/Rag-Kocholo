        "meta_description": "Abstract In this study, observations and numerical simulations are used to investigate how different El Niño events affect the development of SST anomalies in the Atlantic and how this relates to the Brazilian northeast (NE) precipitation. The results show that different types of El Niño have different impacts on the SST anomalies of the equatorial and tropical South Atlantic but a similar SST response in the tropical North Atlantic. Strong and long (weak and short) El Niños with the main heating source located in the eastern (central) Pacific generate cold (warm) anomalies in the cold tongue and Benguela upwelling regions during boreal winter and spring. When the SST anomalies in the eastern equatorial and tropical South Atlantic are cold (warm), the meridional SST gradient across the equator is positive (negative) and the ITCZ is not allowed (allowed) to move southward during the boreal spring; as a consequence, the precipitation is below (above) the average over the NE. Thus, strong and long (weak and short) El Niños are followed by dry (wet) conditions in the NE. During strong and long El Niños, changes in the Walker circulation over the Atlantic and in the Pacific–South Atlantic (PSA) wave train cause easterly wind anomalies in the western equatorial Atlantic, which in turn activate the Bjerknes mechanism, establishing the cold tongue in boreal spring and summer. These easterly anomalies are also responsible for the Benguela upwelling. During short and weak El Niños, westerly wind anomalies are present in the western equatorial Atlantic accompanied by warm anomalies in the eastern equatorial and tropical South Atlantic; a positive phase of the South Atlantic dipole develops during boreal winter. The simulations highlight the importance of ocean dynamics in establishing the correct slope of the equatorial thermocline and SST anomalies, which in turn determine the correct rainfall response over the NE.",

        "text": "b. Model and experiments\n\nThe atmosphere model used in this study is the Simplified Parameterization Primitive Equation Dynamics (SPEEDY) model (Molteni 2003) with a vertical resolution of seven layers and a triangular spectral truncation at total wavenumber 30 (T30). The model has simplified physics based on a spectral primitive equation core and a set of simplified parameterization schemes, which makes it computationally inexpensive. The parameterization processes include large-scale condensation, convection, clouds, shortwave and longwave radiation, turbulent surface fluxes, and vertical diffusion. The climate simulated by SPEEDY is comparable to that by more complex AGCMs (Molteni 2003). In particular, SPEEDY proved to be a reliable tool for simulating the dominant patterns of variability over the tropical and South Atlantic (Haarsma et al. 2005; Hazeleger and Haarsma 2005), which is vital for this study.\n\nTo test whether SPEEDY is able to reproduce the main features of the ENSO teleconnection for both DRY and WET conditions (Pacific and Atlantic SST anomalies), we designed a set of ensemble runs of 20 members where the SPEEDY model is integrated for 2 yr with prescribed SST anomalies and climatological SST. SST anomaly time series are extracted from the composites for DRY and WET conditions for each month of the El Niño years starting from January of the El Niño onset year to December of the El Niño decay year. The following experiments are conducted: 1) a CONTROL run with prescribed climatological SST in both the Pacific and Atlantic; 2) a DRY run with prescribed SST anomalies in both the Pacific and Atlantic for DRY conditions; 3) a WET run, same as the DRY run, except for WET conditions.\n\nSPEEDY is also integrated with prescribed SST anomalies and climatology in the Pacific while predicting the SST anomalies in the Atlantic using a slab ocean from 45°S to 60°N. These experiments are conducted to investigate if the El Niño predetermines the SST anomalies in the tropical Atlantic. Three sets of ensemble runs are performed: 1) a CONTROL run with prescribed climatological SST in the Pacific; 2) a DRY run with prescribed SST anomalies in the Pacific for DRY conditions; and 3) a WET run with prescribed SST anomalies in the Pacific for WET conditions. Each ensemble consists of 20 model integrations that are initialized with slightly different conditions to represent internal atmospheric variability. All ensemble runs use a slab ocean in the Atlantic basin starting from a climatological state and are integrated for a 2-yr period starting from January of the El Niño onset year to December of the El Niño decay year.\n\nTo investigate the role of ocean dynamics, we perform the same set of ensemble runs using SPEEDY fully coupled to the Miami Isopycnal Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM). The ocean model is configured for the Atlantic basin from 45°S to 60°N with 19 isopycnal layers and a horizontal resolution of 1° [for more details see Hazeleger and Haarsma (2005)] The ocean initial state is obtained from a 100-yr climatological run. SPEEDY–MICOM realistically reproduces the climatology and variability of the tropical Atlantic, including the east–west tilt of the thermocline along the equator and the variability of the cold tongue and meridional SST gradient.\n\na. Atlantic and Pacific SST variability\n\nRecords of precipitation over the NE dating back to 1900 show that during moderate-to-extreme El Niño years (Fig. 1), there are as many episodes of rainfall below the average as those of rainfall above the average in MAM (“DRY” and “WET” NE cases, respectively). We first examine the 25 El Niño years (1900–2005) for SST conditions in the Atlantic and Pacific that distinguish the 14 DRY cases from the 11 WET cases. Then we examine 7 DRY cases and 7 WET cases for the 1957–2002 period. The SST anomaly composites for DRY and WET cases extracted from the 1900–2005 period are very similar to those from the 1957–2002 period (Fig. 2). Therefore, we decide to use the shorter period composites from now on for two reasons: 1) the SST data are more reliable for 1957–2002 and 2) the atmospheric dataset used here is only available for 1957–2002, which ensures consistency throughout our analysis.\n\nThere are statistically significant differences between DRY and WET SST composites in the Pacific during the El Niño mature phase [December–February (DJF)] and the NE rainy season MAM (Figs. 2c and 2f, respectively). The Pacific warming is stronger for the DRY El Niño years, particularly east of 120°W in DJF, where the SST difference reaches 0.7°C. In MAM, the eastern Pacific warming is still present for the DRY El Niño years; however, it is replaced by cold SST anomalies for the WET El Niño years. To investigate the time evolution of the SST anomalies during DRY and WET El Niño years, we construct Hovmöller diagrams of the SST and near-surface wind composites along the equator (Figs. 3a and 3b, respectively). Not only are the Pacific SST anomalies warmer in DRY El Niño years but also last longer than those in WET El Niño years. In February, the positive SST anomalies disappear near the coast of South America in WET El Niño years. In addition, the maximum SST anomalies occur in the eastern Pacific for the DRY El Niños and in the central Pacific for the WET El Niños. The Pacific subtropical cold anomalies are stronger for the DRY events than the WET events. Thus, the meridional SST gradient between the warm tropical anomalies and the cold subtropical anomalies is strongest for the DRY cases. Throughout the paper, strong and long (weak and short) events with maximum SST anomalies in the eastern (central) Pacific as well as strong (weak) meridional SST gradient will be referred to as “long and strong” (“weak and short”) events.\n\nFor both DRY and WET cases, SST anomalies are positive in the tropical North Atlantic in DJF (Figs. 2a and 2b). There, the differences between the two cases are not statistically significant (Fig. 2c). The contrasting SST anomalies in DJF occur in the equatorial and tropical South Atlantic, with weak negative anomalies during DRY El Niño years and strong positive anomalies during WET El Niño years. This explains the weak correlation between Niño-3 and SST anomalies in the equatorial and tropical South Atlantic found in previous studies (Zebiak 1993; Enfield and Mayer 1997). The meridional SST gradient in DJF is strongly determined by the tropical South Atlantic, with the greatest SST anomaly differences reaching up to 1°C there (Fig. 2c). During the following season (MAM), the SST anomalies are enhanced in both the north and south tropical Atlantic for the DRY El Niño years and damped for the WET El Niño years (Figs. 2d and 2e, respectively). The enhanced warming of the tropical North Atlantic and cooling of the tropical South Atlantic in MAM during DRY El Niño years establish the positive meridional SST gradient, preventing the ITCZ from moving southward and reducing precipitation in the NE. The greatest SST anomaly differences occur in the cold tongue and Benguela Current–upwelling regions (Fig. 2f). It is worth mentioning that the equatorial cold tongue develops only during DRY El Niños and earlier in MAM. In neutral years, the Atlantic cold tongue peaks during boreal summer [June–August (JJA)] (Keenlyside and Latif 2007). Moreover, eastern Atlantic cold (warm) SST anomalies and western Atlantic easterly (westerly) wind anomalies are present as early as November during the DRY (WET) El Niños’ mature phase (Fig. 3). These coupled anomalies characterize the first element of the Bjerknes feedback. The 1997/98 event is a partial exception to the rule that strong and long El Niño events are generally accompanied by cold SST anomalies in the equatorial and tropical South Atlantic. In this case, there was a warming of the equatorial Atlantic. However, cold anomalies were present in the Benguela upwelling region, and the positive anomalies in the tropical North Atlantic were greater than those in the South Atlantic in MAM; therefore, the meridional SST gradient was still positive in MAM.\n\nAnother important factor to be considered is the existence of a positive phase of the South Atlantic SST dipole mode during WET El Niño years in September–November (SON; not shown) and DJF (Fig. 2b). This is the dominant mode of variability in the South Atlantic and is characterized by SST anomalies of opposing signs about a nodal line running approximately along 30°S (Venegas et al. 1997; Sterl and Hazeleger 2003; Haarsma et al. 2003, 2005). The South Atlantic dipole peaks in boreal winter, coinciding with the ENSO mature phase. Haarsma et al. (2003) have shown that the response of the atmosphere to a positive South Atlantic dipole results in a southward displacement of the ITCZ with a weakening of the trades in the western equatorial Atlantic in January–April (JFMA; WET El Niño years). Concurrently, during DRY El Niño years there is no apparent South Atlantic dipole mode in DJF; however, the SST anomalies show a tripole pattern in MAM, which resembles the second leading mode of variability in the South Atlantic according to Sterl and Hazeleger (2003).\n\nb. Atmospheric circulation variability\n\nWe have seen that Pacific and Atlantic SST anomalies vary considerably from one El Niño event to the other. Here we explore the differences in the atmospheric circulation for both types of El Niño identified in the previous section (DRY and WET). In particular, we analyze the main known mechanisms of the tropical ENSO teleconnection: the anomalous Walker circulation (the zonal circulation change associated with the anomalous zonal displacement of equatorial Pacific convection) and the tropical–extratropical PNA stationary wave.\n\nFor DRY El Niño years in JFMA, the Pacific Walker circulation cell is the typical anomalous cell with a reverse sign during the mature phase (Wang 2002a): the air rises in the equatorial eastern Pacific, flows westward aloft, sinks into the equatorial western Pacific, and returns to the east in the lower troposphere (Fig. 4a). Associated with this anomalous cell is the presence of a lower (upper)-tropospheric convergent inflow (divergent outflow) in the equatorial eastern Pacific and a lower (upper)-tropospheric divergent outflow (convergent inflow) in the far western Pacific (Figs. 5a and 5b). Ascending air dominates the central-eastern Pacific east of the date line (Figs. 4a and 5c). Anomalous upper-troposphere divergence from the equatorial Pacific to the tropical North Atlantic is consistent with the PNA wave train mechanism.\n\nConversely, for WET El Niño years in JFMA, the Walker circulation does not present the reverse sign typical of El Niño years (Fig. 4b). Weak centers of upper-tropospheric divergence and lower-tropospheric convergence are characterized by a weak upward velocity around the date line (Figs. 5d–f). The atmospheric circulation resembles that from the decay to the neutral phases. These results are consistent with the time evolution of the SST anomalies in the Pacific (Fig. 3): the Pacific Walker circulation in JFMA resembles the mature (decay) phase for DRY (WET) El Niños because they are long (short)-lived events.\n\nIn the Atlantic for the DRY El Niño years, the center of lower (upper)-tropospheric convergence (divergence) over the Amazon migrates northward, weakening the upward motion there, which now only occurs west of 70°W along the equator (Figs. 4a and 5a–c). The anticipated presence of cold SST anomalies in the ATL3 region (3°N–3°S, 20°W–0°) in MAM (Fig. 3a) results in a descending motion around 0° and easterly winds in the western equatorial Atlantic (west of 10°W). The weakening of the upward motion of the Atlantic Walker circulation in the west and the strengthening of the downward motion in the east is consistent with what would only occur later in JJA in neutral years (Wang 2002b). The cooling of the equatorial Atlantic and the warming of the tropical North Atlantic weaken the Hadley circulation in MAM, as shown in Fig. 4c. In addition to the weakening, there is a northward shift of a few degrees during MAM when the Hadley circulation is normally at its southernmost position. As a consequence, there is a deficit of rainfall over the NE.\n\nThese results corroborate the discussion in section 3a (Figs. 2 and 3). Strong and long El Niño events are generally accompanied by cold SST anomalies over the ATL3 region, producing subsidence there and easterly anomalies in the western equatorial Atlantic, enhancing the typical El Niño response that generates droughts in the NE. For the weak and short-lived WET El Niño years, there is a strong ascending motion associated with warm SST anomalies over the tropical South Atlantic that weakens the Atlantic Walker cell with westerly wind anomalies in the western equatorial Atlantic (Figs. 4b and 5d–f). This warming also strengthens the Hadley circulation and shifts the ITCZ slightly southward (Fig. 4d), bringing more rainfall over the NE.\n\nAnother known ENSO teleconnection is the Pacific–South American (PSA) wave train, which is more active in SON and corresponds to the second and third leading patterns of circulation variability in the Southern Hemisphere (Karoly 1989; Kiladis and Mo 1998; Mo 2000; Mo and Hakkinen 2001). The second (third) leading PSA pattern is associated with the low-frequency (high frequency) part of ENSO variability with periods of 40–48 (28–32) months, and it has its heating source in the eastern (central) Pacific (Rasmusson et al. 1990; Mo 2000; Mo and Hakkinen 2001).\n\nFor DRY El Niño years in SON, when the wavelike response is more conspicuous (Vera et al. 2004), the PSA wave train is similar to that described in the literature as typical of El Niño events. This is depicted in the map of eddy streamfunction at 200 hPa (Fig. 6a). The upper troposphere is typically characterized by a pair of anticyclonic (cyclonic) anomalies straddling the equator in the Pacific (Atlantic); the PSA wave train extending from the central equatorial Pacific poleward to South America, turning north into the Atlantic; a cyclonic anomaly at the southern tip of South America; and an anticyclonic anomaly over the subtropical South Atlantic, in agreement with Grimm (2003), Vera et al. (2004), and Magaña and Ambrizzi (2005). As expected, this PSA pattern resembles the second leading pattern of ENSO variability since our DRY cases are longer El Niños with maximum anomalies in the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe DRY wave that goes around the tip of South America and into the equatorial Atlantic places an upper-level anticyclonic circulation over the South Atlantic (Fig. 6a). Associated with that, an anomalous anticyclonic circulation develops at lower levels since the response there is essentially barotropic. This anticyclonic circulation is represented by positive sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies in SON (not shown) and DJF (Fig. 6d) over most of the South Atlantic between 0° and 30°S. This circulation is associated with an intensification of the South Atlantic subtropical anticyclone, whose center is located around 30°S, 5°W (Venegas et al. 1997), which leads to easterly wind anomalies in the western equatorial South Atlantic (Fig. 6d). This atmospheric response has a minor impact on the SST anomalies over the South Atlantic, but the easterly anomalies are perhaps partially responsible for cold ATL3 anomalies in October–December (OND; Fig. 3a). One could also argue that the easterlies in DJF for the DRY case are caused by the El Niño response in the tropical North Atlantic, however, the SLP anomalies are only significantly different in the South Atlantic (Fig. 6f), and the zonal wind anomalies are practically the same in the tropical North Atlantic for both DRY and WET events at this time of the year (Fig. 7).\n\nConversely, during WET El Niño years, the pair of anticyclones in the equatorial Pacific is considerably weaker and the cyclonic anomaly at the southern tip of South America is not present (Fig. 6b). The PSA wave train resembles the third leading pattern. This is also corroborated by the results of Silva and Ambrizzi (2006), who show that the PSA pattern of a strong El Niño event (1997/98, DRY case) has a higher amplitude and a more defined wave structure than a weak event (2002/03, WET case). There are two wave paths: one across South America into the equatorial Atlantic and another one around the tip of South America across to South Africa (Fig. 6b). The latter places an upper-level cyclonic circulation over the South Atlantic that leads to the development of an anomalous low pressure center at 15°S–50°S, 40°W–10°E, represented by negative SLP anomalies (Fig. 6e). This is related to a weakening and north–south displacement of the climatological subtropical high in SON (not shown) and DJF (Fig. 7).\n\nThe SST and SLP patterns in DJF are similar to the first leading mode of variability in the South Atlantic (South Atlantic dipole mode) with a SLP monopole centered at 15°W, 45°S associated with a SST dipole (SST anomalies of opposing signs about a nodal line along ~30°S). The SLP and SST anomalies for the WET case have the same order of magnitude of those in Sterl and Hazeleger (2003, cf. our Figs. 2b and 6e with their Fig. 3a.) Over the South Atlantic, the change in the atmospheric circulation caused by the WET PSA wave train is similar to that reported by Sterl and Hazeleger (2003) as being the cause for the establishment of the SST dipole. According to those authors, the SST anomalies are induced by wind anomalies mainly through the latent heat flux and vertical mixing in the mixed layer with a minor contribution from the Ekman transport. With a simple linearized barotropic model, Hoskins and Ambrizzi (1993) showed the existence of preferable waveguides associated with the subtropical jets. A local forcing placed at 90°W in the equatorial Pacific generated a wave train similar to our DRY case (cf. our Fig. 6a with their Fig. 6b). Conversely, a local source placed at 105°W gave rise to two wave trains over the Atlantic—similar to our WET case (cf. our Fig. 6b with their Fig. 9a).\n\nThe aforementioned observational evidence suggests that the inter–El Niño variability of the NE precipitation is dictated by SST and atmospheric circulation anomalies in the equatorial and tropical South Atlantic. We hypothesize that the inter–El Niño variability causes changes in the Walker circulation (direct route), which leads to wind anomalies in the western equatorial Atlantic and SST anomalies in the eastern equatorial and tropical South Atlantic. These SST anomalies determine the meridional SST gradient across the equator, the position of the ITCZ, and thus the NE precipitation in MAM. The observational results also suggest that the inter–El Niño variability of the PSA wave trains (extratropical indirect route) causes changes in the atmospheric circulation over the South Atlantic, which in turn can lead to SST anomalies in the tropical South Atlantic in DJF. These SST anomalies can reinforce or hinder the El Niño direct route response in the western tropical Atlantic in MAM.\n\nThe crucial role of ocean dynamics\n\nDuring El Niño years, the cold (warm) events in the equatorial Atlantic in MAM are associated with anomalous easterlies (westerlies) in the western tropical Atlantic in JFMA (Figs. 8j and 8k) and are achieved mainly by means of the Bjerknes feedback (Chang et al. 2006). According to Keenlyside and Latif (2007), the Bjerknes mechanism is active mainly during boreal summer (JJA). Comparing to neutral years, DRY El Niño events seem to anticipate the cold tongue mode in both observations and MICOM results. The wind changes, remotely caused by the ENSO teleconnection, lead to an earlier cooling in the eastern equatorial Atlantic in MAM. This establishes a positive meridional SST gradient that prevents the ITCZ from moving southward in MAM, causing droughts in the NE. The eastern equatorial cooling in turn enhances the wind in the western equatorial basin that causes further cooling in the eastern equatorial basin in JJA (locally generated). For the WET El Niño events, the cold tongue does not develop in MAM and JJA as a consequence of westerly anomalies. Thus, the ITCZ is allowed to move southward, bringing rainfall to the NE.\n\nThe strong relationship between the eastern equatorial Atlantic SST anomalies and the western Atlantic zonal winds represents only the first element of the Bjerknes feedback (Keenlyside and Latif 2007). The second element involves the link between western Atlantic zonal winds and eastern Atlantic thermocline depth (Figs. 13d–f). The easterly anomalies are associated with a decrease (an increase) of the thermocline depth in the eastern (western) equatorial Atlantic in MAM for the DRY run. For the WET run, the thermocline is practically flat along the equator. The third element of the Bjerknes feedback is the coupling between ocean dynamics and SST variability, and the dominant term in this coupling is the mean vertical advection of temperature (Neelin et al. 1998). The main contribution to the cooling of the eastern Atlantic is due to the increase in vertical entrainment for the DRY run (negative values in Fig. 13g). For the WET run, the warming is associated with a reduction of entrainment along the equator (Fig. 13h).\n\nThe wind anomalies in the western equatorial Atlantic are also responsible for creating SST anomalies in the Benguela Current–upwelling region. Florenchie et al. (2003, 2004) have shown that Benguela Niños, which peak in March and April, are remotely generated by wind anomalies in the equatorial west-central Atlantic in January. These wind anomalies generally trigger Kelvin waves that propagate eastward along the equator, reaching the African coast and inducing coastal-trapped waves that propagate southward. Shallower (deeper) thermocline and enhanced (reduced) entrainment are present off the coast of Africa, mainly south of 15°S for the DRY (WET) run (Figs. 13d–i). Since the SLAB run does not contain ocean dynamics, it is incapable of simulating the cooling in the eastern equatorial Atlantic and Benguela upwelling.\n\nBesides the eastern part of the basin, there is another region in the South Atlantic where ocean dynamics seems to play a role. According to Foltz and McPhaden (2006), the horizontal oceanic heat advection is responsible for damping the surface-flux-forced changes in SST, mainly between 0° and 35°W and 10° and 20°S. In this region, the MICOM run presents a warming in DFJ and MAM (the middle pole of the South Atlantic SST tripole pattern), in agreement with the observations (cf. Figs. 11d and 2d). This is also absent in the SLAB run (Fig. 11a).\n\nFinally, SST changes in the equatorial and south tropical Atlantic due to the ocean dynamics have an indirect impact over the tropical North Atlantic, where the surface heat flux is supposed to drive the SST changes. In both the SLAB and MICOM runs, the tropical North Atlantic presents a warming for the DRY and WET runs in DJF (not shown) and MAM (Fig. 11). This is consistent with the typical ENSO atmospheric bridge, that is, the PNA wave and tropospheric warming mechanisms. Contrary to the South Atlantic, the net surface heat flux and the mixed layer SST anomalies have the same sign in the tropical North Atlantic for both DRY and WET runs in DJF (not shown) and MAM (Figs. 13a,b, and 2a,b, respectively), suggesting that they are generated by the atmosphere. According to Lee et al. (2008), only long El Niño events (our DRY case) cause a further warming in MAM in the tropical North Atlantic. Our results (Fig. 11) corroborate Lee et al. (2008) findings. However, only in the MICOM run (Figs. 11d–f) is this warming (DRY case) statistically significantly different from that caused by the short El Niños (WET case). For the DRY case, the cooling of the equatorial Atlantic weakens the Hadley circulation (not shown), decreasing even further the northeastern trades (cf. Figs. 8g and 8j). For the WET case, the warming of the equatorial Atlantic enhances the Hadley circulation, counteracting the reduction in the northeastern trades, particularly in the eastern tropical North Atlantic. This explains why short-lived El Niños (WET) do not warm up as much as the long-lived ones (DRY). Note that the results from section 4 have shown that changes in the Hadley circulation are more sensitive to the equatorial and tropical South Atlantic SST anomalies than the tropical North Atlantic SST anomalies (Figs. 10e and 10f). Moreover, if the further warming of the tropical North Atlantic is caused exclusively by the WES feedback, it should have been reproduced satisfactorily in the DRY SLAB run (Fig. 11a)."
