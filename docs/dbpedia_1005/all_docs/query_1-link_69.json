The developed KpanÂ function was validated for the same period inÂ 2017 and yielded an R2Â value ofÂ 0.68.\n\nThis study proposes an applicable method for calculating evaporation based on pan measurements in Alqueva Reservoir, and it can be used to support regional water management. Moreover, the methodology presented here could be applied to other reservoirs, and the developed equation could act as a first evaluation for the management of other Mediterranean reservoirs.\n\nReservoirs and water storage are essential in the Mediterranean region for securing urban and industrial water supply, irrigation, and energy generation due to the huge challenges presented by water scarcity in this region (Hoekstra et al.,Â 2012; Alcon et al.,Â 2017; Tomas-Burguera et al.,Â 2017; Rivas-Tabares et al.,Â 2019). Reservoir evaporation is one of the most important components of the water balance, and thus it should be accurately evaluated (Liu et al.,Â 2016). This is particularly important in southern Europe as large investments have been made in the irrigation sector here. For instance, in southern Portugal, the Multipurpose Alqueva ProjectÂ (MAP) with almost 70Â reservoirs is the most important example of such an investment. The MAP contributes to sustainability in southern Portugal and has an important impact on the entire country. Alqueva Reservoir is the largest surface water reservoir in southern Europe, with a submerged area of 250âkm2 and a total storage volume of 4150Ã106âm3 at full capacity. Each 10âmm of evaporation represents a water loss of 2.5Ã106âm3, which is sufficient to irrigate almost 8.5âkm2 of land containing olive trees and, therefore, corresponds to an estimated annual return of EURâ1.1Â million.\n\nThe methodology of Kohli and Frenken (2015), used to estimate evaporation for artificial reservoirs, is based on crop evapotranspiration; it assumes a crop coefficient equal toÂ 1.0, which means that reservoir evaporation is equal to the reference evapotranspiration. Most reservoir managers in the MAP estimate evaporation based on the reference evapotranspiration. Some water system managers use 1000âmm as the reservoir annual evaporation for simplification. In the case of Alqueva Reservoir, with an average reference evapotranspiration of â¼1270âmmâyrâ1 (calculated by the PenmanâMontheith method), the evaporation can be 325Ã106âm3, or 10â% of the total usage volume. This means that the local water budget balance has to be well studied to guarantee the sustainability of this important upstream reservoir. An increased accuracy in the evaporation estimation for Alqueva Reservoir is required because of the projected increase in the irrigation area of the MAP and the importance of regional socio-economic development. A previous study on evaporation from Alqueva Reservoir used indirect methods, including the energy budget approach, aerodynamic methods, a combination of approaches, and a lake modelÂ (âFLAKEâ) (Rodrigues,Â 2009). This work was based on measurements from a Class A evaporation pan, located on a floating platform in Alqueva Reservoir, betweenÂ 2002 andÂ 2006, and its comparison with evaporation values obtained by the energy budget approach to establish monthly pan coefficients. However, there has not been a systematic analysis of the governing factors relating to pan evaporation and reservoir evaporation in Alqueva Reservoir. Accordingly, the current study reports on direct evaporation measurements using eddy covarianceÂ (EC) equipment installed on the existing floating platform in Alqueva Reservoir, which is a part of the framework of the ALEX project (http://www.alex2014.cge.uevora.pt/, last access: 29Â MayÂ 2020). Offshore measurements were conducted from June to SeptemberÂ 2014, as this is the most representative period of the year for the evaporation volume in a Mediterranean climate, representing â¼60â% of the total reference evapotranspiration. This period is also very important for irrigation and is, therefore, the most problematic period of the year for the management of Alqueva Reservoir.\n\nThe turbulent fluxes over the water surface, which can be obtained with direct and continuous measurements, evaluate the exchange of water and energy between the surface and the atmosphere (Arya,Â 2001; Potes et al.,Â 2017). The EC method is usually applied in research because it is a non-invasive technique and provides the most accurate and reliable method for estimating evaporation (Stull,Â 2001; Allen and Tasumi,Â 2005; Tanny et al.,Â 2008; Rimmer et al.,Â 2009). The method is theoretically based on the correlation between the vertical wind speed and air moisture content fluctuation and is a reliable and accurate method to measure open-water evaporation in a location where it is installed (Blanken et al.,Â 2000; Tanny et al.,Â 2008; Nordbo et al.,Â 2011; Richardson et al.,Â 2012; Vesala et al.,Â 2012; Liu et al.,Â 2015; Ning et al.,Â 2015; Ma et al.,Â 2016). However, it requires sophisticated instrumentation that is capable of accurately recording the minimum variations in wind speed, air temperature, and humidity with a high sampling frequency. Furthermore, the equipment is quite expensive and requires continuous maintenance, which means that it is not possible to perform regular measurements. Several studies using ECÂ measurements to evaluate reservoir evaporation have been conducted in various places worldwide (Blanken et al.,Â 2000; Nordbo et al.,Â 2011; Zhang and Liu,Â 2014; Metzger et al.,Â 2018; Jansen and Teuling,Â 2020). Another technique to estimate the actual reservoir evaporation based on direct measurements is the pan evaporation method (Riley,Â 1966). The World Meteorological Organization suggests pan evaporation as the standard method for measuring open-water evaporation (Gangopadhyaya,Â 1966). However, the relationship between evaporation and meteorological parameters in the pan and in open-water bodies differs. Pan measurements generally overestimate evaporation from large water bodies because, in contrast to a lake, a pan receives large quantities of energy through its base and sides and thus becomes much hotter than a lake. Moreover, the surface area of the water in the pan is much smaller than that of a lake, thus allowing a greater air renewal over the free surface (Jacobs et al.,Â 1998; Lim et al.,Â 2013; Yu et al.,Â 2017). The measured pan evaporation rates are generally 30â% higher than that of lake evaporation at the annual scale. The monthly pan coefficients can differ from the commonly used coefficient ofÂ 0.7 by more than 100â% (Kohler et al.,Â 1955; Linsley et al.,Â 1982; Ferguson et al.,Â 1985). It is expected that the relationship between pan evaporation and lake evaporation should be a function of meteorological parameters through the modelledÂ Kpan. The pan evaporation method remains the cheapest and simplest method; hence, this evaporimeter remains the most commonly used instrument to quantify reservoir evaporation. The application of a pan coefficient to convert measured pan evaporation to reservoir evaporation is a method frequently applied in reservoir studies, and this pan coefficient could be calculated as a function of meteorological parameters (Allen et al.,Â 1998; Pereira et al.,Â 1995; Pradhan et al.,Â 2013).\n\nThe Portuguese public company (Empresa de Desenvolvimento eÂ Infraestruturas do Alqueva â EDIA) that is responsible for the construction and operation of the MAP has a meteorological station with a ClassÂ A evaporation pan. The parameterisation of a pan coefficient to convert the measured pan evaporation to reservoir evaporation would provide the MAP with an expeditious reservoir management tool.\n\nAccordingly, the aims of this study were as follows: (i)Â to evaluate the actual evaporation rates from Alqueva Reservoir at the ECÂ and ClassÂ A pan evaporation locations and to then analyse their variability with meteorological parameters (i.e.Â air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and radiation); (ii)Â to estimate the pan coefficient, Kpan, for the reservoir as an indirect multivariable function and assess the efficiency of pan evaporation in retrieving the evaporation component when ECÂ measurements are unavailable. The study used daily data for the period from June to SeptemberÂ 2014 and was validated using data from the same period inÂ 2017.\n\nThe paper is organised as follows. SectionÂ 2 presents the measurement site, instrumentation, and data. The methodology used in this study is detailed in Sect.Â 3, and the results are presented and discussed in Sect.Â 4. Finally, Sect.Â 5 summarises the major conclusions.\n\nThis section describes the methodology used to estimate evaporation from Alqueva Reservoir based on the measurements taken at Alquilha station. It is proposed that the actual evaporation from the reservoir could be estimated using the relationship between the ClassÂ A pan evaporation measurements (at Alquilha station) and a pan coefficient multivariable function, as determined by Allen et al. (1998), but for reference evapotranspiration. Although the conditions surrounding a site can influence the pan coefficient, this aspect is not considered here as the fetch in the wind direction was irrelevant, as mentioned in Sect.Â 2.2. Processed data of pan and ECÂ evaporation (Sect.Â 2.2) were used to develop a multivariable pan function.\n\nFirst, relationships between the ECÂ measurements and meteorological parameters (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation) measured at Alqueva-Montante station were determined. These four meteorological parameters were selected primarily because they are the factors governing evaporation, as usually described in the literature (e.g. Allen et al.,Â 1998), and are the parameters measured in Alquilha meteorological station. The daily cycle of evaporation and normalised meteorological parameters were analysed to assess their behaviours during the day. A sensitive analysis at the hourly scale was also performed for the factors governing evaporation from Alqueva Reservoir.\n\nSecond, the relationships between pan evaporation measurements and the same meteorological parameters, but as measured at Alquilha station (at hourly and daily scales), were determined.\n\nThird, the correlation between ECÂ evaporation and pan evaporation was determined and the daily cycles of the normalised pan evaporation and normalised ECÂ evaporation were compared.\n\nFourth, a sensitivity analysis was performed, calculating the correlation of the daily pan evaporation and daily ECÂ evaporation with air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.\n\nFifth, the daily multivariable pan coefficient series was calculated by dividing the daily values of ECÂ evaporation by the corresponding daily values of pan evaporation.\n\nSixth, a function was fitted to this series based on the physical relationships among the different meteorological parameters measured at Alquilha station (at the daily scale). Several functions were attempted, and the one with the best determination coefficientÂ (R2) was chosen. To determine the optimal parameter estimates, the generalised reduced gradientÂ (GRG) method (Lasdon et al.,Â 1974) was used with the aid of the Excel solver tool. The best parameter estimates were those that minimised the residual sum of squares.\n\n4.1âEddy covariance evaporation\n\nThe total ECÂ evaporation measured from June to SeptemberÂ 2014 was 450.1âmm. The mean daily ECÂ evaporation in June, July, August, and September wasÂ 3.7, 4.0, 4.5, and 2.5âmmâdâ1, respectively. The correlations between the hourly ECÂ evaporation and wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, and incoming solar radiation are presented in Fig.Â 4. At the hourly scale, a positive correlation was observed between the ECÂ evaporation and (i)Â wind speed (R2=0.50) and (ii)Â air temperature (R2=0.20), whereas a negative correlation was observed between open evaporation and relative humidity (R2=0.30). There was no correlation between open-water evaporation and incoming solar radiation.\n\nThe daily cycles of evaporation and the meteorological parameters allow the variation during an average day to be analysed. The normalisation of the mean values of the meteorological parameters was performed to unify the scale of the parameters. The daily cycle of evaporation and the four normalised meteorological parameters measured at Alqueva-Montante station are presented in Fig.Â 5. As expected, the air temperature and relative humidity exhibited opposite trends. There was a slight variation in the wind speed during the morning and a considerable increase after 10:00âLT, which induced a variation in evaporation. After 06:00âLT, evaporation increased continuously until 21:00âLT, along with increases in radiation and wind speed but decreasing relative humidity. Incoming solar radiation contributed to evaporation with a delay that could be explained by the variation in the energy stored in the water column. The increase in solar radiation may lead to an increase in the stored energy in the water column (Potes et al.,Â 2017; Nordbo et al.,Â 2011). The air temperature subsequently decreased compared to the water temperature, and the energy was released into the air, thereby increasing evaporation. An evaporation inflexion point occurred at 14:00âLT, when the incoming solar radiation began to decrease. Accordingly, evaporation began to decrease at 21:00âLT, when there was no solar radiation.\n\n4.2âClassÂ A pan evaporation\n\nThe total pan evaporation measured from June to SeptemberÂ 2014 was 797.9âmm. The mean daily pan evaporation in June, July, August, and September wasÂ 6.9, 7.7, 7.3, and 4.3âmmâdâ1, respectively.\n\nSuch as for the ECÂ evaporation, a positive correlation was observed between the hourly pan evaporation and air temperature (R2=0.55), whereas a negative correlation was found between the hourly pan evaporation and relative humidity (R2=0.53). In contrast, a positive correlation was observed between the hourly pan evaporation and incoming solar radiation (R2=0.35), and a weak positive correlation was evident between the hourly pan evaporation and wind speed (R2=0.05). The daily cycle of evaporation and the four normalised meteorological parameters (wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation) measured at Alquilha station are presented in Fig.Â 6. In the morning period, the solar radiation begins at 08:00âLT and with that an increase in air temperature and a decrease in relative humidity. At 11:00âLT wind speed starts to increase, and around 12:00âLT occurs the trigger of the evaporation pan. The trend of the pan evaporation followed the trend of solar radiation but with a delay of about 3âh, whereby the maximum value was at 16:00âLT when the relative humidity was at the minimum. Pan evaporation reduced as the air relative humidity increased.\n\n4.3âCorrelation between ECÂ evaporation and pan evaporation\n\nThe correlation between daily eddy covariance evaporation and daily pan evaporation was determined for the study period (JuneâSeptember) and is shown in Fig.Â 7. FigureÂ 7a shows a poor linear correlation between the ECÂ evaporation and pan evaporation during the entire study period (R2=0.37). This was also the case when observing the plots for each month: R2=0.1882 in June (Fig.Â 7b), R2=0.0458 in July (Fig.Â 7c), R2=0.3345 in August (Fig.Â 7d), and R2=0.4693 in September (Fig.Â 7e). These results show that the relationship between both evaporations could not be considered linear and reveal the importance of finding a non-linear function to correlate ECÂ evaporation and pan evaporation. The daily cycles of the normalised pan evaporation and normalised ECÂ evaporation are compared in Fig.Â 8. The two evaporations exhibited different behaviours: pan evaporation varied widely over the day, with zero evaporation at 09:00âLT and the maximum at 16:00âLT. The maximum mean daily pan evaporation was 2.75-fold that of the mean daily value. In contrast, the daily cycle of the EC evaporation fluctuated comparatively little over the day. During the night and early morning, ECÂ evaporation was â¼80â% of the daily mean value, with the minimum at 06:00âLT. During the late afternoon, the ECÂ evaporation increased due to the increased wind speed (Fig.Â 5). The maximum daily mean evaporation occurred at 21:00âLT, and it was 125â% of the daily mean value.\n\nThese results agree with a previous study by Salgado and Le Moigne (2010) for the same reservoir, wherein the authors observed an absolute minimum and maximum at 06:00Â and 21:00âLT, respectively. Although both types of evaporation measurements used similar times for calculating the mean daily value (between 12:00Â and 13:00âLT), the significant dissimilarities over the day resulted from the large difference between the size of the pan and the size of the reservoir as these may lead to different heat storage capacities. Owing to the reduced water height in the pan, the amount of energy it would have received through radiation and conduction through the walls of the pan is incomparably higher than that received by the reservoir water. Moreover, the reduced area of the pan would have tended to enhance the loss of water through evaporation because it facilitates the removal of air-saturated layers at the waterâair interface.\n\n4.4âSensitivity analysis of pan evaporation and ECÂ evaporation versus meteorological variables\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the daily pan evaporation and daily EC evaporation with air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation was carried out, and the results are presented in Fig.Â 9. FigureÂ 9a shows a non-linear correlation between evaporation (ECÂ and pan evaporation) and wind speed. It can be observed that both evaporations have a positive linear correlation with air temperature (Fig.Â 9b) and radiation (Fig.Â 9d). FigureÂ 9c shows a negative correlation between evaporation and air relative humidity. The value ofÂ R2 of pan evaporation with air temperature, air relative humidity, and radiation is greater than the R2Â of the ECÂ evaporation with the same parameters. In contrast, the R2Â of ECÂ evaporation with wind speed is greater than the pan evaporation with the wind speed parameter.\n\nBased on this sensitivity analysis, it was inferred that the four parameters influence both ECÂ evaporation and pan evaporation and strengthen the ability to establish a relationship between the open ECÂ evaporation and pan evaporation on a daily scale as discussed in Sect.Â 4.5.\n\n4.5âPan evaporation coefficient model\n\nThe pan evaporation coefficientÂ (Kpan) was calculated as a function of the four meteorological parameters measured at Alquilha station because this station will be used in the future to obtain data to support water management and decision-making. Consequently, the reservoir evaporationÂ (ERes) is estimated by multiplying the Alquilha ClassÂ A pan evaporationÂ (Epan) measurement (at Alquilha) by the modelledÂ Kpan.\n\nThe pan evaporation coefficient model was expressed by a multivariable function as shown in Eq.Â (1):\n\n(1) K pan = a U + b T a + c LN ( RH ) + d LN ( Rad ) + e T a LN ( Rad ) + f ,\n\nwhere aâfÂ are specific constants; UÂ is the average daily wind speed at a height of 2âm at Alquilha stationÂ (mâsâ1); TaÂ is the average daily temperature at Alquilha stationÂ (âC); RHÂ is the average daily relative humidity at Alquilha stationÂ (%); and RadÂ is the total daily radiation at Alquilha stationÂ (Wâmâ2).\n\nBy using an objective function to minimise the residual sum of squares, the parameterisation of the specific constants was performed by optimisation using the GRG method; thus, Eq.Â (1) becomes\n\n(2) K pan = 0.0925 U + 0.1531 T a - 0.2558 LN ( RH ) + 0.2593 LN ( Rad ) - 0.0308 T a LN ( Rad ) + 0.3489 .\n\nThe daily mean modelledÂ Kpan wasÂ 0.59, 0.57, 0.57, and 0.64Â for June, July, August, and September, respectively. These values are slightly larger than those obtained directly by the ratio of the ECÂ evaporation to pan evaporationÂ (0.54). Rodrigues (2009) reported monthlyÂ Kpan values betweenÂ 0.70 andÂ 0.90 for the same summer period and reservoir but using a different approach; he estimatedÂ Kpan values by relating pan evaporation, measured from a floating pan at the Alqueba-Montante platform, and reservoir evaporation obtained by the energy budget approach.\n\nFigureÂ 10 presents EResÂ determined from the pan evaporation coefficient model and the measured ECÂ evaporation. The R2Â value ofÂ 0.74 indicates that this model can estimate theÂ ERes quite well. The total modelledÂ ERes for the period from June to September was 455.8âmm, which corresponds to 101.3â% of the ECÂ evaporation and 76â% of the site reference evapotranspiration calculated by the PenmanâMonteith equation (Allen et al.,Â 1998). The modelled daily meanÂ ERes in June, July, August, and September wasÂ 3.9, 4.2, 4.5, and 2.7âmmâdâ1, respectively.\n\nThe ability of the model was tested for the period from June to SeptemberÂ 2017 (Fig.Â 11; R2=0.68); thus, the model could estimate theÂ ERes despite high measured evaporation rates and a reduced number of available daily pan evaporation measurements.\n\nThe study aimed to develop a method to evaluate the evaporation from Alqueva Reservoir, located in south-eastern Portugal, based on ClassÂ A pan measurements, thus providing an evaluation tool for water management within the Multipurpose Alqueva ProjectÂ (MAP) and for other reservoirs with a Mediterranean climate.\n\nWater fluxes were continuously measured from June to SeptemberÂ 2014 using the ECÂ method at Alqueva-Montante station to obtain accurate reservoir evaporation measurements. The total ECÂ reservoir evaporation from June to SeptemberÂ 2014 was 450.1âmm, and the mean daily evaporation in June, July, August, and September wasÂ 3.7, 4.0, 4.5, and 2.5âmmâdâ1, respectively. Considering the most important atmospheric factors controlling evaporation, a positive correlation between the ECÂ evaporation, wind speed, and air temperature, a negative correlation for the relative humidity, and no correlation between ECÂ evaporation and solar radiation were observed at an hourly scale.\n\nThe ClassÂ A pan installed at Alquilha station provided hourly and daily pan evaporation values. The total pan evaporation from June to SeptemberÂ 2014 was 797.9âmm, and the mean daily evaporation in June, July, August, and September wasÂ 6.9, 7.7, 7.3, and 4.3âmmâdâ1, respectively. Positive correlations were observed between the hourly pan evaporation and air temperature and solar radiation, whereas a negative correlation was found between the hourly pan evaporation and the relative humidity. A weak correlation existed between the hourly pan evaporation and wind speed.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the daily pan evaporation and daily ECÂ evaporation with air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation strengthens the ability to establish a relationship between the open ECÂ evaporation and pan evaporation at the daily scale.\n\nWe found that the daily pan evaporation coefficient could be expressed by a multivariable function of wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation measured at Alquilha station. Further, model validation was performed for the same four summer months inÂ 2017. The modelled pan coefficientsÂ (Kpan) wereÂ 0.59, 0.57, 0.57, and 0.64Â in June, July, August, and September, respectively; the modelled daily meanÂ ERes wasÂ 3.9, 4.2, 4.5, and 2.7âmmâdâ1 for June, July, August, and September, respectively. The total modelled evaporation was 455.8âmm, remarkably similar to the total output from ECÂ measurements, and corresponds to 101.3â% of the measured ECÂ evaporation from the reservoir.\n\nThe evaporation model proposed in this study can assist and improve water management in the MAP. Moreover, the methodology could also be applied to other reservoirs, and the equation developed for Alqueva Reservoir could act as a first evaluation for the management of other reservoirs in the region.\n\nAlcon, F., GarcÃ­a-Bastida, P.
