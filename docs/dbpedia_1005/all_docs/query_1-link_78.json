        "text": "If you have visions of yourselves lazing in hammocks in your over-water villa, while your butler brings you a Martini by boat, then the Maldives is the honeymoon destination for you.\n\nEvery year the resorts of the Maldives out-do each other with increasingly opulent and romantic experiences – candlelit dinners for two on your own private sandbank; rambling wooden suites on stilts out to sea, which can only be accessed by boat. The only difficult decision you'll have to make is choosing the right island to suit you. Almost all of them offer the kind of dreamy, laid-on-luxury holiday fit for a honeymoon, surrounded by the bluest of blue scenery that never, ever loses its sparkle.\n\nWhen to go\n\nGo for a hit of winter sun between November and April.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nSome of our favourites include the designer good looks mixed with relaxed boho vibes at Joali, and Soneva Jani, a dazzling hangout that has some of the biggest villas with huge private pools. For more recommendations, see our edit of the best hotels in the Maldives or our guide to Maldives honeymoons.\n\nCloser to home but with the promise of ethereal charm, Italy’s Amalfi Coast is widely considered one of the world’s most breathtaking coastlines, beloved for its chocolate box towns, white-washed villages and the shimmering Mediterranean Sea. You’ll be hard-pressed to find one spot here that isn’t a photo opportunity, but the Amalfi is much more than the sum of its biscuit-hued beaches and hidden coastal caves. This romantic area offers a slower pace of life, and easy charm that lulls even the most highly-strung newlyweds (table planning will do that to any couple) into a pervading calm. Dotted with forests, mountains, small fishing villages and ample opportunity for island-hopping, it’s not hard to see how this no-stress destination makes it onto the list of best honeymoon destinations. For maximum romance, rent a vintage, open-top car and drive yourselves around the 50km stretch of road between the port city of Salerno and clifftop Sorrento, winding past grand villas, terraced vineyards and cliffside lemon groves.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe best time to visit the Amalfi Coast is in the spring and fall, specifically May and September.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nNestling in one of the most beautiful corners of the Amalfi Coast, Hotel Santa Caterina is well-known, and loved, for its beach club. The late 19th-century liberty-style villa has a seawater pool and a view from the lofty rock face it sits on that is second to none. Newcomer Borgo Santandrea is another standout spot, perched high in the cliffs and built into the rock face overlooking the sea. All rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows and sea views, but for an extra special stay request an infinity-pool option. For more options, see our pick of the best hotels on the Amalfi Coast.\n\nBeloved by party-goers and gap year students, Thailand can end up often being overlooked as a honeymoon destination, but Krabi, at the tail end of the west coast, tends to be less crowded, making it ideal for couples after a taste of The Land of Smiles’ calmer side. Blue waters lap at grass-covered limestone stacks just offshore, best viewed via private boat tour, or from the secluded beaches that pepper the area. Fill days here with tours through Krabi’s ethereal mangroves, scuba diving around the coral reef and lethargic afternoons around the pool or on the sands.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe weather is most even between December and March, with the latter being the hottest month here.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nOne of Thailand’s most luxurious hotels, Phulay Bay, A Ritz-Carlton Reserve sprawls across a natural sanctuary of tropical gardens, manicured lawns and intimate private dining and relaxation spots.\n\nThere's something so utterly captivating about Greece and the Greek islands. The simple beauty, the rich history and mythology, the scrubby wildernesses scented with wildflowers, the perfect clash of blue and white. All that light! Dazzling on little whitewashed church domes and fishermen's cottages built into the rock. And the unbelievable blue of the sea and the skies in long, hot summers that seem to last most of the year.\n\nHow remote do you want to be? Hundreds of islands, their names like gods and monsters – the Cyclades, the Ionians; Thassos and Zakinthos and Spetses - each with their own distinct character. One of the most photogenic of them is Santorini, a honeymooner's paradise. It is absurdly beautiful, but thanks to the natural amphitheatre of its caldera, anyone staying in the whitewashed villages that tumble down its steep hillsides gets an uninterrupted view of the volcano and the deepest blue sea. At sunset the setting sun paints the villages pink and honey-gold.\n\nWhen to go\n\nSpring or early summer will be sunny without too many crowds, while most of the islands stay warm well into autumn, too.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nOne of Paros' more recent additions, Summer Senses Luxury Resort, is a get-away-from-it-all haven where rooms range from deluxe hideouts to suites with private pools. On Santorini, each villa at Andronis Arcadia has its own private balcony and pool. F Zeen on Kefalonia is an earthy adult-only retreat with a wellness focus. There are plenty more options – see more on our guide to the best Greek Island hotels.\n\nLand of pirates, and dragons, of a million islands, misty, mythical mountainous stacks. Land, too, of some of the most beautiful places to stay in the world – and most of them are on Bali. It seems almost unfair, just how many heavenly hotels Bali has; and still more keep opening. Those deep-green infinity pools, jungle-cloaked and inviting, so classy after all that ubiquitous turquoise.\n\nYet however many five-star hotels open up, Bali is no homogenized island resort. It's a magical, spiritual place, which manages to retain its authenticity and culture, as well as its unspoilt beaches and green tropical landscapes. And there are places to stay for all budgets from backpacker beach-huts (full-moon parties can be found) to super-sexy designer retreats.\n\nWhen to go\n\nDry season is April to September, although July and August are the busiest months. A visit in spring or autumn will be quieter.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nComo Shambhala Estate is the most relaxing spa in Bali's hinterland. For a jungle stay, Capella Ubud is a luxe tented camp where the 22 one-bedroom suites have sprawling outdoor decks and private plunge pools. At Bulgari Resort Bali in Uluwatu, all 59 villas come with private plunge pools, and everything is as splendid as you could expect from a brand known for its diamonds and gold. For more, see our roundup of the best hotels in Bali.\n\nFrom June to August, when Santorini and St Lucia are swarming with brides hot in their frothy frocks, when every terrace in Venice and Ravello is clinking with newlyweds, Scotland might very well be the smart choice for honeymooners.\n\nTrue, Edinburgh in August is full of festival mayhem. But beyond the capital: miles and mountainous miles of astoundingly beautiful landscapes, some of Britain's loveliest beaches – on sunny days compared to those of the Caribbean – and the sweet rivers and murmuring streams of Burns's love poems brought to life. And how many places in the world are just as spectacular in winter, even while stormclouds roll across gigantic skies?\n\nWhen to go\n\nIn August, when the weather is fair for exploring.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nStay at the arty Fife Arms in Braemar, or maybe Perthshire's Gleneagles, the most famous hotel in Scotland.\n\nChic and discreet, Comporta is the back-to-nature, beach-shack type of exclusive: a pristine idyll that’s drawn everyone from Louboutin to Sarkozy. It is only an hour’s drive from Lisbon, on Portugal’s blustery west coast, and the strict preservation laws and stewardship by an elite banking group have been key to keeping it spotless and secluded. Singular scenery ranges across bright-green rice fields, scented cork forests and 12km of thrillingly elemental beaches, all icing-sugar sand and thundering surf. Endlessly compared to pre-fame Ibiza or St Tropez, it’s in fact far less glitzy – and better for it. Kick off your flip-flops for sunset dining at a handful of unshowy restaurants on sun-bleached boardwalks, icy jugs of white sangria aside fresh, garlic-steeped clams and coriander-spiked local arroz.\n\nWhen to go\n\nStill warm but less crowded in shoulder seasons: April to May or September to October.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nAt Quinta da Comporta, where bedrooms have a beach-house feel and the spa is a standout.\n\nBora Bora in French Polynesia is well-known for its vast volcanic views, aquamarine lagoons and sieved-flour sand. Adding to the tropical bundle are the luxurious overwater villas that pepper the perimeter of the island, just offshore, and complete the textbook honeymoon image. In short, it’s a tried-and-tested formula that’s proved itself perfect for couples basking in the post-wedding glow (and fatigue).\n\nAway from the crowds of other traditional honeymoon destinations such as Hawaii and the Caribbean, resorts here favour those on post-nuptial getaways and are known for pulling out all the stops. Expect private island picnics, intimate snorkelling excursions and elaborate spa packages.\n\nIf you’re feeling a little more adventurous, Bora Bora is surrounded by sand-fringed Motus (islets) and a turquoise lagoon protected by a coral reef, making it a prime spot for scuba diving. There are no direct flights to Bora Bora from the UK, but, with the most popular stopover en route being Los Angeles, see it as an opportunity to tack some green-juice-wielding Hollywood glamour onto your trip.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe best time to go to Bora Bora is between November and April, when temperatures are still warm. The high season runs from May to October, and though rain showers become less frequent during this time, the number of visitors swell and rates rise.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Four Seasons Resort Bora Bora is loved by travellers the world over for its unrivalled collection of overwater bungalow suites, beachfront villas and fine dining options. It can also claim fame as the backdrop for several films over the past few decades.\n\nCall it the capital of good taste. Foodies, drinks snobs, design buffs and culture nuts: you’ve found Shangri-La. More Michelin stars than any other city. (Yep, Paris comes second – and by a stretch.) Architecture doubles for art, from those all-glass Prada and Dior stores to Tadao Ando’s minimalist-concrete shopping mall, Omotesando Hills. Mixologists blend craft cocktails with laser precision at intimate 10-seater bars; sumo wrestlers scuffle in stadiums and kabuki performers peacock around theatres. Narrow back streets bristle with slow-drip coffee bars, indie fashion boutiques, traditional tatami workshops and eighth-generation noodle counters. Everything artisanal, long before it was cool. And then, when that’s quite enough sophistication, neon-soaked thoroughfares thrum with restaurants staffed by robots and cafés filled with goats.\n\nWhen to go\n\nSunny days and autumn colours in October and November lend a certain romance.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nAman Tokyo is the most spoiling stay in the city.\n\nThough misleading to still refer to Grenada as the Caribbean’s best-kept secret, it’s fair to say that the island still enjoys a more comfortable flow of tourists than some of its other, busier siblings. The tiny island – known as the Spice Isle of the Caribbean – boasts a landscape that seems to outweigh its size in terms of sheer diversity, mixing black and white sand beaches with jungle-clad waterfalls and a singular city, St. George’s, with an 18th-century fort that looks out across the waters of St. George’s Bay. Many honeymooners opt to sail around the island, stopping off at its various beaches and fishing villages.\n\nWhen to go\n\nTo avoid the rainy season, visit between mid-December and mid-April.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThough not a budget option by any stretch of the imagination, Spice Island Beach Resort is the creme-de-la-creme of the island’s hotel scene. Fringing the sands of Grand Anse and its white-washed, low-rise buildings peppered among seagrapes, the property is smart yet unpretentious and airy.\n\nA long beloved backdrop for proposals, the city of Rome is also a hit with culture-loving couples and food-fixated honeymooners alike. Combining 28 centuries of rich history - from world-renowned architecture (including the Colosseum and the Trevi Fountain) to priceless paintings - with sophisticated piazzas, centuries-old trattorias and photo opportunities at every turn. Known as the Eternal City, the centre is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and home to the iconic Pantheon and Roman Forum, as well as the Vatican. Private tours of the grandest sites here are an easy way to add an extra dose of intimacy to the bustling city experience so too are the myriad cooking masterclasses that can be booked for two.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe best time to visit Rome is between October and April, though the temperature can fluctuate, the crowds have dissipated and finding a good deal is much easier.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nA member of the world-renowned Rocco Forte Hotel Group, the Hotel de la Ville sits at the top of the Spanish Steps and envelopes its guests in a mix of 17th and 18th-century inspired decor, along with achingly cool modern touches, like the sprawling spa and open-air lounges and bars.\n\nKnown for its steamy cloud forests, gorgeous surf beaches and multicoloured wildlife, this country is the stuff of travel legend. Those looking to indulge should look no further than Peninsula Papagayo. Think of it as your own exclusive corner of Costa Rica: 21 powder-soft beaches, eight miles of scenic sea cliffs and 600 square miles of protected rainforest and mangroves to explore. There’s also a team of expert naturalists to help guests tailor adventures into the wilderness, from paddling through bioluminescent plankton to mountain-biking rainforest trails. Swiftly followed by some serious poolside cabana time, of course – you wouldn’t want to work up too much of a sweat.\n\nWhen to go\n\nJanuary and February fall comfortably within the dry season, and all but guarantee perfect beach weather.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nSome of the best hotels in Costa Rica are eco-friendly stays. We love Aguas Claras in Puerto Viejo, a boutique bolthole with Victorian-style bungalows and a tiny beach club. For a dreamy melt-into-the-horizon pool scene, check in to Kura in Uvita.\n\nMauritius is the Indian Ocean paradise with a pulse. No fear of getting bored here; this spice island has incredible national parks; its interior soars up into mountain ranges, where tropical forests harbour amazing wildlife; and it has an astonishingly rich coastline and marine parks to explore, by boat or underwater (watersports are quite the thing here). The neighbouring islands of Réunion and Rodrigues offer their own riches – and feel off-the-beaten-track even by Mauritian standards; while hundreds of tiny islets dotted around the coastlines three have breathtaking scenery\n\nIt's not just about the beaches, but the beaches are superb. And if that's the kind of holiday you want – to lie on a cabana and be handed cocktails on the hour, every – Mauritius is the place for it. Many beachfront resorts here tend towards high-octane glamour; but it is also possible to find under-the-radar, more laid-back places to stay to suit independent travellers.\n\nWhen to go\n\nJune-September. The cool winter, when temperatures average around a balmy 20ºC, runs through June, July, August, September. Perfect for a post-summer-wedding de-stress.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nMaradiva offers the ultimate less-is-more escape where roomy pool villa dwellings are wonderfully discreet and the beachside location is one of the best. Foodie couples should book into One&Only Le Saint Géran, while LUX* Grand Baie is beloved for its sun-drenched high glamour. For more, see our pick of the best hotels in Mauritius.\n\nWe often think of a honeymoon destination as a far-flung place, but it doesn’t need to be. Sometimes, all the romance and downtime you need is just a short Eurostar trip away. Enter: Paris, a city for lovers, where cafés spill out onto pavements, nestled in the profile of imposing architecture, and cobblestone streets lead to chic boutiques and a sparkling evening scene. A forever favourite of poets, songwriters, artists and, of course, the hopelessly in love, it makes the perfect post-wedding stop-off for couples who are either short on time or keen to minimise the air miles.\n\nWhen to go\n\nA trip between October and April offers both balmy climes and fewer crowds.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe former address of a certain Oscar Wilde before his death (which, yes, took place in one of the rooms here if you’re wondering), L’Hôtel has often dubbed the most romantic hotel in Paris. Arranged around a circular atrium, the rooms and suites are decadent but comfortable and the spa and pool lend themselves to ultimate relaxation in the midst of the city’s buzz.\n\nStraying from the traditional biscuit-hued beaches of a more ‘traditional’ honeymoon, Napa Valley ties together a European feel with Californian climes and a bucolic pace. Known for its hundreds of hillside vineyards, the wine country of the USA is a food-focused getaway that can easily be paired with the urban buzz of San Francisco or the rugged expanse of the Big Sur.\n\nAnd when you’re not sipping world-class Sauvignon Blanc (the region is famous for it) with views across the valley, there are a string of enchanting towns to meander at leisure, including Calistoga (well-known for its hot springs and mud baths) and St. Helena (home to Beringer Vineyard – considered the oldest continually operating winery in the Valley).\n\nIn the middle sits Yountville, famed for its high concentration of Michelin-starred restaurants, while a more low-key dining experience can be enjoyed at Oxbow Public Market in Downtown Napa itself.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe best time to visit Napa is August through October or March through May.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nA place that feels as though it was plucked straight from the heart of rural France and dropped into the middle of the dramatic Californian landscape, the five-star Auberge du Soleil is an adults-only hotel nestled within a terraced, sun-kissed hillside.\n\nIf you’re more about hunkering down by the fire than lolling around at the pool, a romantic winter-weather adventure in Finnish Lapland could be for you. The Finns’ national pastime of spa and sauna also gives honeymooners ample opportunities to get cosy. Kakslauttanen’s log cabins have private hot tubs for getting steamy in an otherwise frigid forest; just imagine clinking glasses of Champagne as the warm fog roils around you under a crystal-clear night sky. Add to that moonlit sledge rides, crackling fires and frozen landscapes, and suddenly that tropical-island trip seems basic.\n\nWhen to go\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, autumn and spring are the most active seasons for Northern Lights activity in Finnish Lapland – and, owing to the region’s position above the Arctic Circle, visiting outside of winter doesn’t mean missing out on the snow. It does, however, mean skipping the Christmas crowds. The very clearest skies can be banked on in March.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe region offers no end of luxurious ways to spot the Northern Lights without leaving bed: be that from a glass igloo at Kakslauttanen, or from Hotel Iso-Syöte’s two-storey Eagle View Suite, with its wraparound glass walls and roof.\n\nSt Lucia and its sky-piercing Pitons have long been a favourite of honeymooners looking to pair bare-foot luxury with the opportunity to explore a rich tapestry of history and culture. Dive sites are teeming with marine life, natural harbours (like that of Marigot Bay) carved into the island create ample opportunity for wonder and the hiking is second-to-none (Trails in the interior rainforest lead to waterfalls like the 15m-high Toraille, which pours over a cliff into a garden). Castries, the lively capital, has an eternally bustling market and Pigeon Island, now no longer estranged from the mainland, will enchant history lovers with its tales of the colonial era and fort remains.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe best time to visit Saint Lucia is between February and May, when rain showers are almost non-existent.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nSugar Beach sits on a former sugar plantation sandwiched between the Pitons and certainly wins the award for the most immersed hotel on the island. A forest spa with treehouse treatment gazebos completes the romantic experience. For more inspiration, see our edit of the best hotels in St Lucia.\n\nThough Morocco is perhaps best known for its fourth largest city, Marrakesh, and their surrounding Atlas mountains, away from the sensory overload of the bustling markets and town squares here, the quieter west coast area of Oualidia is ideal for those seeking a laid-back honeymoon with a dose of culture. Visitors delight in outdoor activities, from surfing or swimming in the saltwater lagoon to quad biking, all surrounded by pink flamingos and oyster farms.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe best time to visit Morocco is September-November or March-April.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nA Moorish fortress with sustainability at its heart, they don’t come much more exclusive than La Sultana Oualidia, made up of 12 unique bedrooms and suites. As well as endeavouring to be as eco-friendly as possible in its design and daily workings, the property runs a programme of tours and initiatives to immerse guests in their ethos, too - their Bird Safari is only one such example.\n\nSoaring peaks, tranquil lagoons and crystalline waters have drawn honeymooners to Tahiti’s South Pacific shores for years. More remote than islands of similar stature, the off-grid appeal helps to add to the feeling of being fully immersed in island life. Shaped like a figure of eight (or an infinity symbol if you want to get romantic, which of course we do), Tahiti is the largest island in French Polynesia, with black-sand beaches and two extinct volcanoes among its charming collection of rugged scenery. Though relatively unexplored by British tourists, those who do venture here rave about Papenoo Valley, in the heart of the island, with its luxuriant jungles and string of waterfalls, perfect for cooling off in after a warm-weather hike.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe best time to visit Tahiti is between June and August when the climate is at its driest and the weather is balmy.\n\nWHhere to stay\n\nNot all hotels can boast a natural aquarium, but the InterContinental Tahiti Resort can. With lush gardens, views across the volcanic peaks of Moorea Island and an overwater gourmet restaurant, this five-star hotel is a safe pair of hands for any couple looking to push the boat out.\n\nThe Austrian capital is the ultimate in cultured luxury; an urban honeymoon destination steeped in old-world romance. This is a place for waltzing across shining marble, with neoclassical palaces lining leafy boulevards, opulent Renaissance-style opera houses and coffee shops that are less salvaged wood, more crystal chandeliers. It’s strolling arm-in-arm by the Danube and stealing kisses in stately courtyards. Where you might spend your days floating around art galleries and evenings hogging the best seats at the ballet. Better still, the city has its own urban vineyards, where you can try a crisp white among the vine rows, with views stretching across Gothic cathedrals and imperial residences to the river.\n\nWhen to go\n\nSeptember is an excellent time to enjoy the wine harvest, paired with warm temperatures in the 20s.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nAt newcomer Rosewood Vienna in the heart of Vienna’s 1st district, the grandest opening in the city in almost a decade.\n\nJust an extra little nudge away from the United States, Mexico is a long-loved honeymoon destination in its entirety. However, Los Cabos, located on the very tip of the Baja California Peninsula, is a particularly entrancing stop for recently-espoused lovers. Between December and March, whale watching is firmly on the agenda, though the rich tapestry of marine life here is on hand all year-round (think: sea lions, turtles and myriad tropical fish). The area comprises two old towns, San Lucas and San José del Cabo, linked by a 32km corridor of beach-front properties and championship golf courses. Secluded? No. Romantic? Yes.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe best time to visit Los Cabos is from May to June, and after October once the bigger rain showers have passed.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Waldorf Astoria Los Cabos Pedregal has continually cropped up in our Conde Nast Traveller Readers’ Choice Awards, and it’s easy to see why. Mediterranean village vibes, paired with a rustic beach and elevated Mexican details combine to create a truly heady atmosphere.\n\nThis Balearic beauty’s more glamorous side has always been an A-lister secret – it’s the sort of place you’ll find Kate Moss sipping sangria in a honey-hued, stone-hewn hilltop village, or Michael Douglas wandering his vineyard on a remote coastal cliffside, and all at a suitably refined distance from the better-known, built-up resorts. A honeymoon here still promises glorious seclusion: Mallorca has more than 260 beaches, many of them tucked into secret coves, so you and your amor are all but guaranteed a private roll-around in the surf. Plus, along with the dreamy scenery – sweeping white-sand crescents, pine-peppered cliffs, golden citadels – there are some seriously out-of-this-world hotels.\n\nWhen to go\n\nAvoid the stiflingly hot and busy summer months and opt for the serene seclusion of shoulder season: May and September temperatures average around 22°C.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nFinca Serena, a white-washed spa sanctuary, is spread across 40 hectares of orchards and farmland; Cap Rocat, a former fortress turned private retreat, is set on the coast; and Predi Son Jaumell, a forested 16th-century estate, has a Michelin-starred restaurant, aromatic gardens and yoga classes. See our guide to the best hotels in Mallorca for more.\n\nWhen it comes to honeymoon destinations, St. Kitts (and her sister island, Nevis) is often overlooked in favour of some of the Caribbean’s more eminent islands, offering those who choose to shun some of the bigger names a quieter, often more affordable, getaway. The island’s laid-back vibe is immediately infectious and the rainforest-coated mountains invite immersive day trips that lead visitors along a path that feels much less trodden.\n\nFamous for its white, grey, and black sand beaches and volcanic terrain that offers memorable hiking scenery, St. Kitts is also home to freshwater pools for forest bathing and Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park, which was built in the 18th century and has panoramic Caribbean views.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe best time to visit St. Kitts is between May and June, when hotels lower their rates. However, during peak season – December to April – the island hosts a six-week carnival.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Park Hyatt St. Kitts Christophe Harbour on Banana Bay houses spacious rooms and suites (ideal if you don’t plan on stepping outside it very much), contemporary architecture and unobstructed views across the Caribbean Sea.\n\nKnown as the ‘birthplace of reggae,’ a honeymoon in Jamaica is certainly not going to be a quiet one. But in place of a sleepy atmosphere is a vibrant tapestry that envelops travellers in a landscape that is just as colourful and rich as its culture. Tree-cloaked mountains, vast rainforests, meandering rivers and fish-fringed reefs are all open to exploration during your time here, while the manmade side, with many historic plantations, where you can sample tropical fruits and tour the grand great houses, offering its perspective of the island. It’s worth touring around during your trip as each area offers its take on island life: lively Montego Bay (the country’s capital city) is one of the most popular resort towns, while Ocho Rios is the island's major port, and Negril is famous for its long, languishing beach, trimmed by coconut palms.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe best time to visit Jamaica is from November to early December — hurricane season has ended, and the hotels and restaurants are all open, but you'll be able to enjoy the island without the high volume of visitors that arrive in mid-December.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Trident Hotel sits just outside of Port Antonio on Jamaica’s wilder Northeastern coast and offers villa-only accommodation, an intimate feel and a private, protected lagoon just beyond your infinity pool.\n\nYes, yes, Iceland is the destination du jour – the number of visitors has rocketed threefold in the past few years. But you won’t see many folks in the far north’s Troll Peninsula. A rugged hinterland of emerald valleys, snow-cloaked mountains and chilled teal waters, it’s just as otherworldly as it sounds. Deplar Farm is the isolated, high-spec lodge at the heart of it: formerly an actual farm and now a 13-suite stunner with a living grass-covered roof, indoor-outdoor geothermal pool (a hell of a place to see the Northern Lights) and a spa with isopod flotation tanks, it offers the ultimate in de-stressing calm. But the end-of-the-world epicness isn’t just for looking at – this adventure is hands-on. Heli-skiing offers runs that literally no one on Earth has skied before, stretching from peak to sea; summertime spells fat-biking untouched mountain trails. Honeymooning on a remote island? Ha. Deplar Farm is another planet.\n\nWhen to go\n\nYou're most likely to see the Northern Lights between October and February.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nAt Deplar Farm, of course – a blow-the-budget, once-in-a-lifetime escape.\n\nFor those yearning to be marooned on a desert island but who perhaps can’t quite hack an off-grid lifestyle, Aruba is the ideal honeymoon destination. Having long-lured loved-up travellers to its clear jade waters, the Caribbean islet is within easy reach of the United States, enjoys more predictable weather than its neighbours and, due to the year-round arid climate, offers crystal clear viewing conditions underwater (perfect for anyone wanting to explore the peppering of shipwrecks that lie just offshore). UTV tours are popular here, often involving an opportunity for cliff-diving as you explore the more rocky rubble of the island’s Northeastern side, while animal-lovers will enjoy the focus on caring for nature here, from the butterfly farm to the animal sanctuary.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe best time to visit Aruba is between April and August when the island hits a sweet spot of more affordable rates paired with good weather.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Aruba offers, among a smorgasbord of luxury amenities, direct access to a private pristine beach, an adults-only pool and an expansive spa that puts focus on using indigenous ingredients like aloe.\n\nA popular destination to mix and match with one of the sleepier Indian Ocean Islands, South Africa merits inclusion on our best honeymoon destinations list all on its own. Known worldwide for its Big Game safaris (hello, eco-friendly lodges and infinity pools that double as water holes for the surrounding wildlife), the rest of the country is equally as fascinating, from the bustling V&A Waterfront in Cape Town, lorded over by the flat-topped Table Mountain, to the vine-woven valleys of the Winelands onto the penguin spotting at Boulders Bay (though colonies can be found from southern Namibia around the South African coast to Port Elizabeth). Many honeymooners hire a car, or better yet, a private tour guide, and head down to the Garden Route or Route 62 along the Western Cape.\n\nWhen to go\n\nThe best time to visit South Africa is from May to September, especially if you plan to head out on safari, as the cooler winter months in the northern regions conjure ideal conditions for viewing big game.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThough the country offers myriad privately-owned guest houses and lodges that all boast their unique charm, the One&Only Cape Town is somewhat of an institution among honeymooners here. Holding a prime position on the city’s lively harbourside, the hotel is framed by the majestic peak of Table Mountain, which makes for pretty magical viewing at sundown.\n\nTime was Colombia would have been a less obvious honeymoon destination. But Caribbean-side Cartagena’s deep-rooted romance has proven irresistible, helping tourism to grow more than an incredible 300 per cent in the past 12 years. The old, walled town woos with sun-yellow colonial villas and cathedrals, balconies with billowing bougainvillea, and slow ambles through cobbled streets to arcaded squares. But it also bubbles with a contemporary energy, brought by freshly experimental kitchens (now rivalling Lima’s), and a savvy fashion crowd drawn to the colourful brew of old and new. Beyond the old-town walls, glitzy Bocagrande beckons with swimming beaches and upscale bistros; at Donjuán, chef Juan Felipe Camacho fuses Basque and Colombian flavours, influenced by years at Michelin-starred San Sebastian restaurants. (President Juan Manuel Santos is a vocal fan.) Things get steamier still in late-night salsa bars, or an hour’s boat ride away at the protected Rosario Islands – ideal for a castaway canoodle.\n\nWhen to go\n\nJanuary to March, when an evening sea breeze dials down humidity.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nAt Hotel Casa San Agustín.\n\nVerdant wine regions and Venetian villages; fairy-tale castles and sparkling marinas: romance is sewn into Slovenia’s fabric – you can even cycle a heart-shaped road in its Špičnik winelands. The country’s name has ‘love’ in it, for goodness sake. Compact enough to explore widely, yet varied enough to thrill at every turn, Slovenia has been hailed the best of Europe in miniature, with its snow-capped mountains, Adriatic coastlines, cobbled old towns and teal-green Alpine lakes. But this enchanted land won’t remain the continent’s best-kept secret: its selection as the European Region of Gastronomy 2021 speaks to a new excitement buzzing around the farm-to-table food scene. A raft of freshly sophisticated offerings such as Pikol Lake Village, where floating wooden villas sit amid the Brda vineyards and are served by a dedicated Michelin-approved restaurant, are opening too. When it’s time to turn in, you can go big at Hotel Gredič, a castle with a Champagne temple, or understated at Hiša Franko, where Hemingway wrote A Farewell to Arms and renowned Slovenian chef Ana Ros has her restaurant.\n\nWhen to go\n\nAutumn brings the harvest – ideal for food and wine fans – and vibrant colours.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nGo off-the-charts indulgent at Chocolate Village for riverside glamping on the site of an organic chocolate factory. Or – it’s your honeymoon, after all – all three.\n\nThe Seychelles archipelago is the ultimate castaway-island fantasy. It's out-of-this-world beautiful, the archetypal Indian Ocean paradise: palm-fringed beaches shelving gently into a dreamy-turquoise sea. And there's a romantic wildness to it which certain others lack; the islands of the Seychelles are less groomed; there's adventure to be had and curious wildlife – a wildlife so rich it is comparable to the Galápagos – to be found among its virgin forest and coral reefs. It's not hard to happen upon a beach where you can leave the first pairs of meandering tracks in the powder-white sand.\n\nWhen to go\n\nMay to October - perfectly timed for the wedding season - when the trade winds blow in refreshingly cool, dry weather. Temperatures are fairly constant year-round at 24-31ºC, though certain islands have their own microclimates, so check first.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nStay at North Island, the super-natural, ultra-private island where William and Kate (reportedly) spent their honeymoon. Or on Six Senses Zil Pasyon, where the villas are the closest thing to super-smart, minimalist tree-houses. See our guide to the best Seychelles hotels for more.\n\nSurely there is nowhere more exotic and far-flung than Polynesia, the islands of the South Seas. Thousands of miles from anywhere, Fiji is a castaway fantasy: empty beaches washed by spectacular surf, waterfalls splashing into deep green pools in the jungle, blue lagoons where couples can swim alone amid shoals of rainbow-coloured fish – Blue Lagoon was actually filmed here, as was Cast Away and, less romantically, Shipwrecked. But those who wash up here get a warm welcome, smiley locals proffering hibiscus flowers.\n\nFiji is made up of hundreds of islands, and no small number of them have been turned into private-island resorts. Laid-on luxury, no-expense-spared resorts, or stylish eco-lodges where nature is king - and the best are a mix of both. Set sail for a dreamy honeymoon with a conscience.\n\nWhen to go\n\nMay-November. Fiji has a warm and wet tropical climate all year round, though from May until November the temperatures drop and there is less rain.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nFor the ultimate castaway adventure, stay at The Brando, French Polynesia, an elegant, low-impact hideout.\n\nIf you’re looking for something really unique, a honeymoon in this Himalayan hermit kingdom won’t disappoint. The tiny nation of Bhutan is perhaps best known for keeping the outside world at bay – thank the hefty daily tariff the government levies on foreign visitors – and the result is a literal breath of fresh air: a land of pristine peaks, rushing rivers and mysterious, forest-cloaked valleys. Where getting away from it all might entail a trek to the famously precipitous Tiger’s Nest Monastery, followed by a soak in a Himalaya-facing plunge pool. A serene sanctuary of incense and gongs; mindfulness and monks.\n\nWhen to go\n\nOctober is the best time of year to visit, with cool mountain air and clear skies offering ideal conditions for exploring the Himalayas.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe sublimest stay for couples here is undoubtedly Six Senses Bhutan. A series of five luxury lodges spread across the country’s most spectacular landscapes, it offers unparalleled views, purifying spa treatments and incredible itineraries where private guides take you hiking and biking into the heart of this special country, connecting with communities as much as the land.\n\nThe spice islands of Tanzania – Zanzibar, Pemba, Chole, Mafia – are the stuff of fantasy. Extraordinarily clear, blue waters and remote white-sand beaches, empty but for a salt-harvesting local in the distance, perhaps; or a single pair of sunloungers set out just for you.\n\nHere you can really go off-radar. And these islands are but drops in the ocean compared with the vast wildernesses of the rest of the country. Tanzania is a giraffe's head and shoulders above other countries when it comes to wildlife and landscapes: the highest mountains; the greatest lakes; a quarter of it given over to national parks and game reserves, thrumming with great numbers of birds and beasts.\n\nSo it's no wonder that the bush-and-beach honeymoon is becoming increasingly popular - two weeks or more, split between two or more of Tanzania's extraordinary lodges, from the plains to the coast. Two out-of-this-world honeymoons in one.\n\nWhen to go\n\nJuly to March. Avoid the rainy season from April to June.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nCheck into Zuri Zanzibar for a socially-aware, blissed out beach break.\n\nDenmark’s capital city is a rich smorgasbord of cultures, cutting-edge design has woven itself around historical landmarks, modern culture bubbles around grand castles and hygge hideaways are tucked away behind bustling cobbled streets. In short, this is a honeymoon destination where you’d be hard-pressed not to find a slice of society that feels synonymous with your own values and interests. Dine out on Michelin-starred food at one of the 15 star-awarded eateries peppered around the Danish hotspot, explore the regal history of the land at Rosenborg Castle – built in 1601 – or immerse yourself in a real local pastime, diving into the refreshing harbour waters before spending the rest of the morning lazing around on the docks with a drink.\n\nWhen to go: From June to August, you can expect long, bright days and nights, low humidity and comfortably warm temperatures.\n\nWhere to stay: The eco-savvy love birds among us have likely already heard of the cutting-edge hotel Manon Les Suites. A former factory, the space is now home to six floors of suites, each with its own balcony, all centred around a courtyard. The piste-de-resistance here? The indoor pool, seemingly a climate all of its own, encircled by tropical greenery and day beds.\n\nA firm favourite of animal lovers and those looking to steer away from more traditional honeymoon destinations, Rwanda’s wildlife offering is second to none. And the primary draw here? Gorilla trekking. Visitors can get within a few feet of these giant beasts as they hike through the volcanic landscape of the National Parks. Newlyweds can also head out to see lion pride and the rare black rhino, as well as take part in nighttime safaris to see the animal kingdom in a different, dwindling light.\n\nWhen to go: The best time to visit Rwanda, both in terms of weather and wildlife spotting chances, is during the dry period from June to September.\n\nWhere to stay: You’ve likely seen photos of Bisate Lodge, one of Rwanda’s most luxurious resorts, without even knowing it, as the award-winning lodge has been singled out for its sustainable (and stunning) ethereal pods, which seem to rise naturally out of the rainforest. Like giant birds’ nests tucked into the trees, the Forest Villas offer a well-balanced blend of pampering and trekking, all while naturally immersed in the landscape.\n\nOozing glamour, there is something of a honeymoon on the French Riviera that whispers syrupy sweetness in your ear, suggesting romance around every intimate corner. From well-documented harbourfront restaurants to lesser-known enclaves, renting an open-top car and weaving your way through Cannes toward Menton, stopping at the enchanting towns and cities on the way is the best way to cover as much ground as possible. Popular Antibes, an old town enclosed by 16th-century ramparts with the draw of its distinctively star-shaped Fort Carré is a good option for history buffs, while extroverted Monte-Carlo – home to the world-famous Place du Casino and the Boulevard des Moulins – has a name which precedes it. It’s all enchanting from start to finish.\n\nWhen to go: May through to early July is the best time to visit to enjoy warm weather without the summer crowds.\n\nWhere to stay: Perched above the rocky coast of Cap Ferrat, Grand Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat, is protected from the sea winds by 14 acres of faultlessly groomed gardens. Everything here can be personalised, from private, candlelit dining amid the pines to in-room spa treatments, making it a popular choice for honeymooners looking for a unique luxe experience.\n\nThough little in the Caribbean can be classed as a ‘secret’, in honeymoon terms, Turks and Caicos probably comes the closest. Widely believed to be two islands – ‘Turks’ and ‘Caicos’ – it is actually an archipelago of 40 low-lying, coral-connected islands. Sparsely populated, the idea of ‘alone time’ is easily achievable here, and boat excursions, nature walks and leisurely days spent stretched out on one of the swathes of honey-hued sands are the norm. The waters here are also a diver’s paradise, with the 14-mile barrier reef of Providenciales’s north shore or the dramatic underwater wall stretching some 2,000 metres off the shore of Grand Turk just two of the highlights.\n\nWhen to go: Though Turks and Caicos merits a visit all year round, the warmest, driest weather can be found between December and March.\n\nWhere to stay: Amanyara, built on the rocky coves of Providenciales, encircled by tropical forest and overlooking the coral reefs of Point Marine National Park, feels entirely detached from the rest of the world. The price tag can be eye-watering but so too is the sheer natural beauty around which the luxe resort has immersed itself, and the level of personalised service here is second to none. Villas are vast, many with sweeping private pools, the wellness offering is cutting edge and the daily diving sessions (included in your stay) a real highlight.\n\nDefinitely a consideration for lovebirds who are keen to not take their honeymoon lying down – quite literally – Montana offers a plethora of adrenaline-activating activities, from canoeing down the Yellowstone River and carving lines down the slopes of Big Sky to canyon treks and forest camping. And top of many mooners’ Montana must-dos? A trip through the arresting scenery of the 52-mile highway, which winds into Glacier National Park, which crosses the Continental Divide at Logan Pass. And if you’re keen to cover more ground, visitors to Montana often couple it with a trip to Salt Lake City, Seattle or Denver, with daily flights scheduled.\n\nWhen to go: Montana is a year-round destination, but the weather (and the crowds) are certainly mellower during September, though keen skiers are more likely to find the power quality they’re after in February or March.\n\nWhere to stay: No trip to Montana would be fully authentic without staying at one of the romantic lodges peppered throughout the varied terrain, and Sage Lodge – along the banks of the Yellowstone River – is one of the best. This luxe resort is just five miles from Camel Discovery and six miles from Chico Peak."
