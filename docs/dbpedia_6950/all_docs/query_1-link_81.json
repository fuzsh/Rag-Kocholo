        "text": "The financial news coming out as I write this, 3/30/23, is getting more and more alarming. I posted only two weeks ago, that we don’t have much time left, before the financial house of cards that the American economy is, comes tumbling down. In other words, the collapse is imminent.\n\nI can now say with certainty that the collapse is in progress, now. The Western central banks have all pooled their resources to stop cash outflows from different banks around the Western world, to plug holes that appear, and keep the banks solvent. But it’s too much; the dam has too many cracks, too many holes, and there aren’t enough fingers available to stop the leaks.\n\nThink about it this way; FTX collapsed, with some $30 billion and cryptocurrencies vaporized. That in turn pulled in Signature Bank, Silvergate and Silicon Valley banks, in classic bank runs. It would appear that regulators are set to limit withdrawals from banks, to prevent future bank runs. In other words, your money is safe in the bank… until you want to withdraw it.\n\nThe shock waves from SVB pushed Credit Suisse, the 2nd largest bank in Switzerland, over the edge, after suffering from numerous scandals in recent years, including a spying scandal, the collapse of two investment funds in which the bank was heavily involved, and a rotating group of executives. The dominos have clearly started to fall, and there are roughly 200 other banks read to collapse, in the same way that SVB did. It is abundantly clear that the American financial system is teetering on the edge of the abyss; the only thing that has kept it from already doing so is the US Treasury promising to stabilize the system via bail-outs. But the FDIC is already tapped-out from the SVB debacle; additional funds will have to be created from thin air, newly created money via the digital printing press.\n\nThis translates into continued inflation, as there are roughly $17 trillion in US bank deposits. M2 money supply is roughly $21 trillion, so the money supply (and prices for everything) would roughly double, if the US government were to bail out everyone.\n\nFor countries and people outside the USA who use the dollar for international transactions, this means that their 2%/month inflation rate would now almost double, in a very short time. You can’t effectively save money, wealth, future purchasing power, in a currency that is intentionally being devalued by the issuing government; it’s a complete loser. So producer countries have long had the desire to switch to an alternative currency, which is more stable, issued by a country not run by insane egomaniacs like we now have in the USA.\n\nEnter Operation Sand Man, a rumor propagated for over a year by Steve Quayle. The first video I can find of him describing this is 9/21/21, here. I have not been able to find any other sources for this story, much less documentation. But that should be no surprise, Steve Quayle has LOTS of hidden sources. I have no secret-squirrel sources to give me inside information, I’m just another guy having to rely on publicly available sources, and extrapolate from there using my understanding of economics, experience and common sense. In a nutshell, he says:\n\n“Information that came to me…is that, [on October 15th?] at the 11:38AM mark on Wall Street, there will be a declaration by the Fed, itself, declaring Force Majeur. And that simply means, because of a situation beyond control, in this case, there’s too much debt and nothing to pay it back, that the American dollar becomes worthless.\n\n“And what Janet Yellen has done, in my opinion is telegraph to the entire world that the United States dollar is coming to an end and as further proof of that, there’s an operation called ‘Sandman’, based on the Petrodollar, Saudi Arabia and the oil-exporting countries are going to basically refuse to take the US dollar.\n\n“Most people don’t know but up until…a couple of years ago, all of the oil that was bought and sold was in US dollars. Well, that day’s coming to and end, because there’s an agreement of 130 nations to abandon the US dollar concurrently and simultaneously when the go signal is given…\n\n“That means the money in your account denominated in dollars goes away. It means your credit cards no longer work. It means all the benefits, whether it’s EBT, whether it’s Social Security, whether it’s all these things – and look, I’m not trying to scare anybody – but this is the plan they have, to starve out America. This is the equivalent, in my opinion of Stalin’s Holodomor, where 5 million Ukrainians were starved to death. So, that’s what’s at stake.”\n\nObviously his prediction did not come true. But predictions for exact timing of events are a dangerous thing; suppose you predict a criminal act, and your prediction pushes authorities to take appropriate action, and the criminal act is prevented. Does the fact that the act was prevented and lives saved, make you wrong? No. This is the double-edged sword of this sort of thing. Do we sometimes predict things that turn out NOT to be, at all? Sure. But again, that doesn’t mean that the plan isn’t still in play, or still sitting on the shelf, ready to deploy at some point in the future.\n\nTo be honest, I’d forgotten about it, Operation Sand Man.\n\nUh-Oh…\n\nAnd then a buddy, Luke, sent me this clip, key point from 58 seconds to 1:18… :\n\nPresident William Ruto: For the people who work numbers, I am giving you free advice, those who are holding dollars, you might soon go into losses. Do what you must do because this market is going to be different in a couple of weeks.\n\nAnother blogger posted a summary which, to be honest, sums it up as well as I could, so I’m posting his comments in their entirety:\n\nThis stunning announcement gives credibility to a RUMOR that has been circulating for over a year, that 142 countries around the world have secretly agreed to what they call “Operation Sandman.”\n\nAccording to the RUMOR, Operation Sandman will “put the US Dollar to sleep” by having all 142 countries repudiate the currency on the same day, and refuse to continue accepting it for payment in Trade.\n\nCountries around the world began planning this when they witnessed the then-Democrat-Controlled US Congress, go on a spending spree of several TRILLION Dollars in Omnibus Bills. Those countries realized there is nothing backing the value of US Dollars and they saw that the US Congress has no plans at all to reign-in spending.\n\nOne country’s Finance Ministry recently told the US, “We are no longer willing to accept ones and zeros in a bank computer as actual payment for real goods.”\n\nThe countries agreed that holding US currency was becoming foolish because it was becoming worthless on its face, thanks to all the rampant over-spending by the US Government.\n\nNow, it appears those countries may actually take action “within a couple weeks.”\n\nIf countries around the world repudiate the Dollar as payment for goods in trade, then they would halt providing manufactured goods or raw materials unless paid in some currency OTHER THAN DOLLARS.\n\nSince the U.S. barely does any manufacturing at all anymore, thanks to the business nitwits who thought it was a good idea to convert the US economy to a “service economy” then products we buy in stores will simply run out and we will be unable to re-stock because no one will want our money.\n\nAmong the business nitwits are also those who pushed for “Free Trade” claiming it would improve sales of American-made goods overseas if America agreed to halt Tariffs on all imported items. The government bought-into the idea, not realizing – or not caring – that these very businessmen weren’t at all interested in selling more American goods overseas. What they were interested in was shipping American JOBS overseas, taking advantage of cheap labor, then shipping those exact same products back to the USA to sell at the same high prices . . . . while pocketing the profit from the new, foreign, cheap labor without having to pay Tariiffs.\n\nThe Businessmen, their corporate Boards of Directors, and Commerce Organizations who touted “Free Trade” were the ones who moved American jobs overseas and now, the country barely manufactures anything, anymore.\n\nSo here we are, years later, and thanks to those businessmen, and the federal politicians who foolishly believed their lies about “Free Trade,” we have almost no manufacturing. Countries around the world seem to be actually planning to stop accepting the US dollar as payment, so we won’t be able to buy anything because it’s all made overseas now!\n\non the manufacturing side the sames happened here…\n\nThe speech by President Ruto was given on March 22, 2023.\n\nHe stated a “couple of weeks,” 14 days, takes us to April 5.\n\nThe observed Easter weekend starts at the end of the next day, April 6.\n\nThis came out four days later:\n\nSuddenly it doesn’t seem like a “conspiracy theory” anymore, does it? Indeed, for the last several days in my corporate office building, where MSNBC is constantly blaring their disgusting feed in the lobby, every time I walked by, they were discussing what would happen if the US dollar “dominance” were to end.\n\nOne thing I’ve picked up on, is that MSM will deny, deny, deny, until it is decided to admit the truth, usually well after it has become obvious to anyone with a functioning brain. The fact that MSM is now openly admitting what’s coming, tells me that we’re close to the end of the road for the dollar.\n\nThe writing is on the wall, that de-dollarization is a real thing, and countries are moving fast. Yesterday, Brazil just announced a $200 billion trade deal with China while bypassing the dollar. Saudi Arabia is taking the hint from China to also join BRICS, and just signed two deals for oil refineries. And all the economic sanctions against Russia to prevent them from selling oil, have simply compelled them to find new customers, and their exports are back up to previous levels.\n\nThe American empire is dead. All the power-plays that have kept the dollar as the worlds’ reserve currency have collapsed. The world is pivoting away from the dollar at a very rapid speed.\n\nComing back to Operation Sand Man…\n\nThe current conflict between Ukraine and Russia leaves some serious issues on the table, to be addressed.\n\nFirst of all, the insane levels of support for Ukraine are both a gravy train for the corrupt politicians and weapons manufacturers, and an emptying of the US treasury. Basically everyone’s on the take, in some fashion or other.\n\nBut there’s another problem; how to end the war, before Russia is sitting at the border of Poland and Romania? If the US economy collapses, there will be no political will, no stomach for any politician sending so much as a dime to a country that nobody reals give a crap about, anyway. The support for Ukraine will evaporate, and the conflict will quickly- VERY quickly- be over.\n\nPunchline:\n\nI think there is a strong possibility, say 50-75% chance, that Operation Sand Man will go live on Thursday, April 6, 2023, late at night (early the next morning for most other countries), +/- 12 hours. I came up with this date based on the fact that the USA will be going into a national holiday weekend, and be shut down for 3 days for Easter observance. As a sneak-attack, it would prevent the US government from formulating a rapid response to the situation, for at least four calendar days, by which time it would be a “done deal.”\n\nIt would also follow that many globalist elites- who’ve been pushing for the “Great Reset,” to collapse the American (and European) economies in a catastrophic manner, would actively choose one of the most holy days of the year to make it happen: Easter. They have overtly expressed their disdain for Christians, and this would be the ultimate slap in the face, to the “bible-thumpers” with their “God and their guns.” They have a weird, twisted sense of humor; this would amuse them greatly, just due to the timing alone.\n\nSo the punchline is, I’m guessing that Easter weekend will be THE time for them to pull the plug on the dollar. Everything I’m seeing fits.\n\nI hope I’m wrong… I truly do. We’ll see soon.\n\nRAMIFICATIONS\n\nForgive me for quoting myself from an earlier post, but it’s the same information, so here we go:\n\n“When that happens- and it will- the price of imported goods will go through the roof almost overnight, as every country will attempt to get rid of their dollars while they still can, and use some other currency for international trade.\n\nThe dollar will be dumped as the worlds’ reserve currency, in a cascade as other countries holding dollars run for the exits. When this happens, the price of products that are imported will go up by 4-5 times, almost overnight (my best guess). This is the logical result of the Cloward-Piven strategy writ large.\n\nThe price of oil- when no longer priced in dollars- will have ripple effects that will cause suffering on a scale never before seen in America. Consider the trucking industry, in a very real way, feeds the country. The food you eat, the clothes you wear, the furniture in your house… even the building materials for the house itself, were all delivered by truck. As the price of fuel skyrockets, trucking companies will attempt to pass on the costs to their customers (stores like Wal-Mart, for example), who will in turn pass it on to the consumer. Will the consumers pay so much more?\n\nConsider that while those desperate people who live on the dole might still get their checks (or “deposits” on their EBT cards), it will no longer be able to buy anything, because the prices of everything have gone up 500% almost overnight. What will happen in the inner cities, when people realize they can’t put food on the table, much less put gas in their cars? Gerald Celente summarized it best: “when people lose everything, and they have nothing left to lose, they lose it.” And they will.”\n\nNotice, I said above, that the non-productive welfare citizens might get their payments, but there’s historical precedence which indicates this might not be the case. A very close friend told me about her experiences in Russia, during the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n“One night, we went to bed, and everything was fine. You had, say, 2000 rubles in the bank- enough to buy a car. We woke up in the morning, all the banks were frozen, no transactions allowed. This stays for about two months, while they devalued the currency. When they finally opened and allowed us to get our money out, 2000 rubles was enough to buy a T-shirt.”\n\nI believe that is EXACTLY what will happen to us. It’s not question of if, only when. And I don’t think it’s going to be long, at all… In the Soviet Union, they didn’t announce it (of course, the high-up politicians knew)’ it was a sneak attack. Even the crooks- who we now call “oligarchs”- didn’t know.\n\nIn effect, the initial devaluation made the cost for everything go up by 100x. Try to imagine buying a loaf of bread for $500; how long before you run out of money to feed your family?\n\nLater, the government switched to a new ruble to replace the old one, again devalued. Every family was allowed to convert, say, $10,000 worth of currency. Any excess of the limit they set, which couldn’t be converted, automatically became worthless after a certain date. I remember seeing photos of pallets of cash dumped in the woods, rubles that couldn’t be converted… My Russian friend predicts that the USA will do the same here, to prevent the trillions of cash dollars used to bribe people all over the world from returning to the USA and exacerbating the hyperinflationary collapse we’re already in.\n\nIt’s also important to keep in mind, there are laws now on the books where the banks can- and will- confiscate your money, during a financial crisis, to keep themselves afloat. Legally, when you put your money into a checking or savings account, it’s not your money anymore; you’re an “unsecured creditor.” And if they want to, they’ll take your money, and the FDIC will not cover the loss, because your money wasn’t stolen, as it wasn’t your money anyway. See how that works?\n\nAnd do you see why Biden signed an executive order to facilitate digital currencies? If your money is digital, it can be confiscated or they can at least stop you from transacting any more (cryptos).\n\nIt’s actually quite simple; anything you don’t have in your physical possession, you don’t own. If it isn’t physical cash in your hand (or under your mattress, or whatever) you don’t own it, and it can be stolen from you in the blink of an eye (think of everyone who donated to the Canadian truckers).\n\nHow to maintain your wealth, or whatever purchasing power you have saved up? Buy gold or silver, as much as you can, as FAST as you can. If that’s not available to you, store up extra food for trade/barter, later, as everyone needs to eat. Buy chickens, build a coop out of an old shed or any scrap building materials you can get your hands on (but make sure you can protect them from thieves of the four (or two)-legged variety. Buy a few 100# bags of chicken feed from your local farm supply or co-op. Eggs will be worth a LOT. Anything physical is better than the paper notes which will soon be worth nothing.\n\nFOOD\n\nDue to the Russia-Ukraine conflict which NATO incited (and exacerbates to this day), Russia was kicked out of the SWIFT financial transaction system by all of America’s poodle countries. As a result, there will be no potash shipped out to most of the world- a necessary ingredient for high crop yields around the world. Food shortages, famines and starving to death are now a foregone conclusion, as the prices of food go up beyond what literally hundreds of millions will be able to pay.\n\nRussia has been stockpiling food, and last week Putin announced to his people on Russian TV that the country had five years of food stockpiled, so they need nothing from the USA- or frankly, anyone else. China has stockpiled 18 months of wheat to feed their people, but their agents are busily moving around America buying any stored wheat they can get their hands on- by the trainload, at whatever price they have to pay- and sending it on cargo ships back to China.\n\nThe results here will be food prices going steadily up in the USA for the foreseeable future. I’m seeing 15-20% increases in the grocery stores, on a month-to-month basis, right now, and those increases will get much steeper. With no potash and already exorbitant prices for natural gas- both absolutely required to produce fertilizer for high crop yields- we’re going into a period of not just “food shortages,” like Brandon said, we’re going to be facing our own version of the Holodomor famine of 1933. Think of this starving woman with her son…\n\nOr this family starving in their own yard:\n\nFood prices will eventually go exponential, and finally won’t be available at any price, since fuel won’t be available for trucks, there simply won’t be any food available and even if there was, nobody wants to make a delivery to a place where there as likely to get shot as paid with the worthless money. The blue cities- hives of humanity more parasitical than productive- will face escalations of violence, famine, starvation and eventually cannibalism, as a result.\n\nKeep in mind, this is going global. The only countries that’ll make it through reasonably “ok” will be Russia and- maybe- China. But I’m not holding my breath about the latter. The 2nd and 3rd-world countries will be the leading edge of the misery, as their populations live closest to poverty, and any significant price swings of food automatically mean they starve to death. But it will still hit here, HARD, and if you aren’t ready, there’s a good chance you’ll be relying on Brandon to save you… and then you’ll become a statistic.\n\nMy advice is to get as much food as you can get your hands on immediately. Understand, it really doesn’t matter how much food you have in your pantry, it ain’t enough. Make sure to get things that you and your kin will really eat, not stuff that will technically keep you alive, but your kids will refuse to consume because it doesn’t taste perfect. If you can get a YEAR of food stored away, you’ll be ahead of 95% of the crowd, who doesn’t have more than a weeks’ worth of food in their whole house. If you’re on city water, find a way to store it (plenty of videos on this sort of thing out there). If you have an electric well, find a way to power it if the utilities go off, or get a hand-pump if possible.\n\nVIOLENCE\n\nAfter the food completely runs out, the city parasites will start foraging out into the countryside, basically as far as the remaining gas in their cars will carry them. And with deteriorating mental capacity brought about by hunger, they’ll have lost their inhibitions about killing you for a can of Dinty Moore beef stew.\n\nPolice will too busy with attempting to “maintain order” of millions of hungry people, to worry about minor annoyances like rapists and murderers; they’ll roam freely among the weak and the desperate, predators amongst prey.\n\nWhich leads into our next subject…\n\nWEAPONS\n\nIf you have no weapons at this point, it’s almost too late for you. Find weapons in common calibers. This means .38 Special for revolver, 9mm for semi-auto pistol, 5.56mm AR-15 rifle, .30-30 lever gun or a .30-06 bolt gun if you can find it. Stick with common calibers, get as much ammunition as you can. Even a good hunting rifle is better than nothing. Be familiar with it, know how to use it, understand gun safety protocols so you don’t accidentally shoot a loved one.\n\nAnother aspect that people don’t think about, is edged weapons. Amazon has some amazing deals on Wakizashi-type swords (like miniature samurai swords) made of 9260 spring steel, which can be wielded one-handed by an adult or two-handed by kids, if needed. They can be made razor sharp, don’t require ammo, and are quiet. Finally, they don’t require background checks. Check out K-bar knives, as well. A good knife is useful not only as a weapon, but a tool. Get one, get used to carrying it all the time.\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\nI’ll keep this short and sweet: The old cliché remains true; no man is an island. You’re NOT going to stand watch over your home 24×7 forever, you’ll need help and a community to work with, for mutual defense. The Civil Defense Manual by Jack Lawson will help you get started on this aspect, and you need to move with a purpose, right now. (And no, I don’t make any money mentioning the manual.) Move quickly, because if you don’t, there’s a very real possibility that you won’t survive this.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAn old Japanese proverb applies: “preparation does not guarantee success, but the lack of preparation guarantees failure.”\n\nI will tell you straight up, the global famine is coming, there’s no way to stop it. It WILL happen, I am 100% certain of this. Do you remember when COVID hit, everyone finally realized they needed to hit the local CostCo or Walmart or whatever, and stock up on food and toilet paper? People punching each other out for a bottle of hand-sanitizer or a 4-roll package of butt-wipe? Or even better, the buyer behavior of people trying to get ‘deals’ on Black Friday, right after Thanksgiving? Riots, shootings, the whole shebang of crazy behavior…? Multiply that by 100, for everyone wanting to get FOOD. I figure the crowds will start to figure it out by mid-May… earlier if we’re unlucky, later if we are lucky… but the mob-mentality of people trying to buy food before the shit hits the fan, will cause the shit to hit the fan… Food riots, all of it.\n\nI also will state with absolute certainty, that the dollar collapse in imminent. … IF the dollar collapse happens more or less at the same time people are scrambling to stock up on food, it will get to a level of ugliness that people haven’t seen since at least WW2. And not just Americans, but everyone in the Western world- having lived a life of relative prosperity- are in for a brutal awakening to reality.\n\nDo whatever you can to prepare, while you still have time. Food, water, storing your purchasing power, and weapons to defend your loved ones. Remember, your mental fortitude will be the biggest determinant on whether you make it or not. MENTALLY prepare yourself."
