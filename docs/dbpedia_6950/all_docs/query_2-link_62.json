        "text": "Guest Post by\n\nFord Madox Brown King Lear and Cordelia c1851\n\nAn evil man will burn his own nation to the ground to rule over the ashes. – Sun Tzu\n\nAprès moi, le déluge – Louis XV\n\nWhat I think we see happening in the past few years, and you can go back as far back as you like and look for the signs, is that the American elites, plus their UK brethren (the EU are just followers), have shifted towards an attitude of “if we can’t control the world, we will set it on fire”. That’s the light in which I think you need to see Ukraine and Gaza, as well as their upcoming move vs China. Ukraine is vs Russia, Gaza is vs Iran, the fight vs China might be Taiwan. That’s their three main goals, and they may well be intent on tackling them all at once. After all, what do you have to lose if you want to set the world on fire?\n\nThere are no American losses in all this, just some old equipment “sold” to countries, paid for by American and European taxpayers. No American soldiers or civilians are lost, well, at least officially, only Ukrainians and Palestinians (and soon, Taiwanese?). Even if there are 500,000 of them, the US doesn’t care. The term “collateral damage“ was invented for just this occasion. And they intend to cause much more of it. Already, we see Boeing expanding its arms production facilities. Raytheon and General Dynamics et al are sure to follow suit, soon. That is money. That is our future. We’re gearing up for war. They’re going to burn it all down for profit.\n\nUkraine, since 2014 (or before, if you will) has been the first test case. Gaza is the second. They lost Ukraine in humiliating fashion. So bad, in fact, that they still won’t admit defeat. Instead, they have people in Kiev saying the conflict will take another 5 years. As there are hardly 5 weeks of cannon-fodder soldiers left there, and their average age is 45. Did the US miscalculate the strength of the Russian army or did they just not care?\n\nI’d go for both. The situation there, they can blame Zelensky and other Ukrainians for the losses. Anyone but DC. “They don’t understand the “sophisticated” US armory, they don’t understand the “sophisticated” US/NATO battle plans, they just die. We had no idea. We thought they were as smart as us, or something.” They will get rid of Zelensky, send him either to Monaco or Elysium, and bring in probably Zaluzhny. Though why would he want the job? To be painted a loser?\n\nIn the middle East, they have Netanyahu doing their bidding. And while they’re prodding him for more corpses, they tell you they’re trying to stop, or pause, Bibi, but “he’s gone berserk”. Well, the US cares as much about Palestinians as they do about Ukrainians. And they’d care exactly as much about Americans if there were no homefront or no elections. Which they’re pretty close to cancelling as well.\n\nBibi’s been dreaming about the position he’s in today for 50 years. He doesn’t care about people, or bloodshed, or dead children, he’s seeing his life long dream come true: get rid of all Palestinians. Create the promised land. This is not the world of the 1970’s, however. But Bibi doesn’t see that. He only sees his old dream. And the US elites are more than happy to help him try to achieve it. Because it means profits. And sure, also because there’s a large, and very powerful Jewish lobby in US politics. Who are as blind to today’s world as he is.\n\nIt suits the guys behind the curtain very well, thank you, that everyone blames Bibi for the atrocities in Gaza, and they never get mentioned. But he’s a puppet the same way Zelensky is, Want to kill -young- people? Here’s your tools. Our taxpayers already paid the bill.\n\nIn the US, UK, EU, the idea is that if you have enough firepower, you can do anything. What they missed, is that they no longer have that kind of firepower. Or, rather, they do, but the other side, Russia,Iran etc., has five times as much by now.\n\nMeanwhile, the US elites have set Europe on a road to perdition. Helped along by agents such as von der Leyen, Michel and Borrell, they managed to completely destroy the continent’s future. In just 2-3 years. Remarkable. Europe could still be part of a multipolar world, but they don’t make their own decisions. Europe buys American LNG at 3-4 times what it would cost on the world market, and they refuse to say a single word about the US blowing up the vital Nordstream pipelines. No future.\n\nSo what future does the rest of the world have? Well, with the US dead-set on setting it on fire if they can’t control it, that is not an easy question. In any “conversation” where one of the parties is suicidal, odds are off. Should we move to Russia?"
