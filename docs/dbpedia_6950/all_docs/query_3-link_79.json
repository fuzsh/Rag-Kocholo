        "text": "Why are allegedly pro-White boards and forums still full of statements that Rudolf Hess was half-Greek. It's a total falsehood, yet lies are more desirable than truth to the majority of assorted \"Whites\" who frequent these sites.\n\nDavid Irving, in his biography of Hess, writes:\n\nFritz Hess was thirty; he had inherited an import business founded by his father, Christian, and was a respected member of the German colony in Egypt. Thus the boy Rudolf spent his first fourteen years amid the silks and ceramics and servants of a palatial villa. Every two years the family left these patrician surroundings for a six-month stay at the family’s hunting estate at Reicholdsgrün in the Fichtelgebirge mountains of central Germany.\n\nHis mother was Klara Münch, daughter of a textile manufacturer in Thuringia.\n\nNow, it could be that some of the less sophisticated Whites mistake the name \"Thuringia\" for Greek. Anything is possible!\n\nDavid Irving has his faults, but he certainly researched this information and is more reliable than anonymous posters and commenters at Stormfront and Daily Stormer.\n\nIn addition, Hess' parents were buried in Wunseidel, Germany and Hess and his wife were buried next to them in the same plot. That is, until the cemetery authorities decided to dig them up and remove/destroy the beautiful headstone, for fear the grave was becoming a \"shrine for neo-nazis.\"\n\nWhat's with all the silly people in denial in the comments?\n\nNo, 7 out of 10 Spanish do not have blue eyes. The person claiming this must have had a very selective bias and ignored all of the people that didn't have that feature. All of the big studies on blue eye occurances in Europe have blue eyes being less than a majority in southern Europe, in Spain being quite low around 20%, which is far from the 7 out of 10 anecdote claim on here.\n\nAnyone can easily type in \"Spanish crowd\" and see that you 7 out of 10 claim it BS, same goes for hair colour. Anyon can see from large crowds of Spanish people that blonde hair is not that common there. Why can't you accept this?\n\nAs far as the partial white supremacist type woman that wrote this page, well technically you are right that Hitler's hair was brown and it wasn't black. In fact proper black hair is quite rare among Europeans, only usually very far southern and south eastern Europeans can have what could look like proper black hair.\n\nThis claim by some in the replies here that blonde hair or blue eyes = being pure white is also retarded and unscientific. There are people who are literally like 25% black and they have blue eyes. Do you honeslty believe they are more white than someone like Colin Firth who has dark brown eyes?\n\nYou are being retards, eye colour doesn't = your race. Even hair colour doesn't mean you are pure or not, many melanesians have blonde and red hair from another mutaiton.\n\nBut there are even mixed white people who still have blonde hair, and then clearly less mixed white people who have brown hair. Having blonde hair doesn't = being pure.\n\nBeing relatively pure only depends on one thing, that is if you are a European and your genetic test shows very little mixture with Africans and Asian people. You will find the most pure Europeans actually exist in north western Europe, these are the people who are the most far away from all other racial groups.\n\nMost southern Europeans have small amounts of African black mix, south eastern Europeans have some Asian mix and mixture with middle eastern people which introduces trace amounts of African mix in turn.\n\nAnd many in just eastern Europe have Asian mix and Russians have a significant Asian mix.\n\nThese are just facts, genetic studies prove this. Of course a lot of emotional and juvenile people on here want to feel good about themselves based on fantasy.\n\nMany siblings even have different coloured eyes, doesn't make one sibling white and the other magically mixed, they come from the same parents and the reason is genetic recombination. If by magic you had the sperm cell and egg cell that created you and you fertilized them with each other, believe it or not the individual produces would vary slightly every time, it wouldn't come out looking identical to yourself.\n\nSorry that most of you are uneducated.\n\nI already know I will get ignorent people commenting who are emotional and will start spurting BS, that is the nature of white supremacists, they are just as stupid and illogical as Afrocentrists.\n\nI just finished looking at photo after photo of Hitler and a few things don't seem real, like some of the pictures of very long shots are all in focus. They didn't have the cameras and lenses back then like we have today. There would be great areas of those long large pictures that would be out of focus. But they are not! Also, there are pictures of huge crowds in these massive statiums, how did the people know they were to go there? The average household didn't have phones in those days. Did the SS officers go door to door telling people to go there? And how would have the people been able to get there, most people didn't own a car. Did the SS officers go around town picking people up? I don't deny that Hitler killed many people, but I do not believe it's as we have been told. Look down the rabbit hole you'll be surprised at what you find."
