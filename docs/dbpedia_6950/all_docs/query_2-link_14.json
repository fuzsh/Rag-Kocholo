        "text": "Pioneering organic farming with Demeter certification\n\nDuring July and August, the tanks, presses and fermenters are more or less abandoned, with just one colleague operating the label machine nearby. The rest of the workforce is out in the vineyard, tending to the vines. “Everything’s growing like crazy at the moment,” says Patrick Müller. And you can tell that he’s itching to get his hands on those Palatinate vines. His colleagues on the farm at Kleinsägmühlerhof all have a lot on their plate during the sunny summer months too. The farm is located in the Eckbach valley, around a 20-minute drive from Bad Dürkheim. Since the 1980s, eco-pioneers have been injecting their passion and working hard to transform what was once a conventional farm into an operation guided by a social and sustainable strategy. In fact, the Lebenshilfe farm now has the prestigious Demeter certification awarded to sustainable farms, support from private individuals and donations from well-known institutions.\n\nHappy pigs with ideal living conditions\n\nIt’s unusual to find a farm with livestock around these parts. That’s why the 120 cows (including 40 for milking), 30 pigs and almost 1,000 chickens at Kleinsägmühlerhof get plenty of attention from visitors and locals alike in a region where the main focus is wine and vegetables. The pigs are so used to people stopping by that they don’t bother waking up from their slumber. They can snuggle up in the straw, always free to roam around outdoors as they please – just like all the animals kept here on the farm. Sustainability is at the heart of it all, with resources being used carefully and nothing going to waste. Shrivelled potatoes are fed to the pigs. Leftover eggs are used to make pasta for community catering. Grains that don’t make the cut for bread become chicken feed. “We throw next to nothing away – there’s a worthwhile use for everything,” says Maria Burgmaier-Danner.\n\nFarmyard expansion with new building\n\n38 people with disabilities work at Kleinsägmühlerhof. Married couple Maria Burgmaier-Danner and Richard Danner have been in charge since the very beginning. And they’re supported by half a dozen volunteers, the odd trainee and 17 employees too. There’s always plenty of work to do and duties are shared between the team – milking the cows, helping out in the barn, farm shop or bakery, perfecting the living conditions, processing milk, providing transportation, taking care of admin, supporting workers with disabilities... The list goes on! The cowshed was extended recently in line with the EU standards for organic farming. And now there’s another crane on site, as the farm prepares to move the bakery, milk processing facilities and farm shop to a new building for 2022. As it stands, the bakery team performs the miraculous feat of baking 300 loaves in just 58 square metres every day of the week (except Sunday). And the bread is nothing short of divine, with its delicious crust and soft, squishy centre. The new building will open up opportunities, making it possible to produce more pasteurised dairy products to sell and creating new jobs for people with disabilities. Lebenshilfe Bad Dürkheim opened up its own Leprima organic supermarket so it would have somewhere to sell the food it produces. To start with, the shelves were just stocked with the organisation’s own products like wine, baked goods, milk, eggs and meat, with many of the items for sale boasting Demeter certification. Over time, products were added to the range, sourced from other organic suppliers within the region and organic brands from further afield in Germany. For example, you can buy products here from community-supported agriculture in nearby Ungstein. Supermarket Manager Moritz Knipser is keen to point out how important it is that everyone can work together in a laid-back environment. This is important for the team and also the customers who love the personal interaction they get in store. According to Moritz Knipser, a second shop in the town centre has been well received too. Expect to see more premium organic produce grown locally!"
