        "text": "“There are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen.” [Soviet leader, Vladimir Lenin]. Looks like this is one of those weeks.\n\nThe Power Behind the Throne and the Bankers’ Forever Wars. We must take a stand or let our children fall, it’s that simple. Recently, former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss gave us a stonker of a revelation, which I believe deserves to be set to the record. Truss appeared in Steve Bannon‘s War Room and said this:\n\n“What I found out when I got into No. 10 is, I thought that if I got to the top of the tree, I would be able to implement those conservative policies… What I discovered was that I was not holding the levers. The levers were held by the Bank of England, by the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), they weren’t held by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor…”\n\nTruss goes on to point out the obvious problem with this: you can sack the Prime Minister, but you can’t sack the BoE officials who hold the levers of power. Around the same time as this revelation, Glenn Beck dropped a similar clue. In his interview with Tucker Carlson published on February 21, 2024, he shared a story of his encounter with George W. Bush:\n\n“I thought of something George Bush told me in the Oval Office. I was asking about the policies and how they were going to change, and he said, “Glenn, don’t worry, whoever sits behind this desk, in that chair, is going to have the same advice given by the same advisors and they’ll realize, the President’s hands are tied.” “I walked out of that room horrified… Why do we even have elections?” [AP Note: We have elections to anaesthetise the electorate to believe that they have the power to change policy – they can’t, and they don’t. Britain is an oligarchy and has been for centuries.\n\nIn untangling the causal factors behind the many crises we face today, the trail of breadcrumbs always leads to the transnational banking cartel, led by the BIS, which has the determining influence in shaping the system of governance under which our societies operate. This network likely constitutes the very “monolithic and ruthless conspiracy” that President John F. Kennedy had warned about.\n\nAs a famous member of that cartel proclaimed, “Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!” At the money power’s receiving end, Napoleon Bonaparte understood that relationship all too well: “When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation.” This is how it is today.\n\nIn his 1965 book “Tragedy and Hope,” Carroll Quigley warned us that, “The powers of financial capitalism had [a] far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. … The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control and use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and direct injury of all other economic groups.” That world system of financial control is what today has been promoted as the “rules-based global order.” Now it is The New World Order (NWO) driven by the UN. WEF, et al.\n\nIn the recent past, Ukraine was militarised and Nazified to strike against Russia with the same powers behind the throne pulling the levers. As the US-installed Prime Minister of Ukraine, Arseniy Yatsenyuk spoke appreciatively in 2014, “… international bankers are ready to help us. … We would not have survived without their international assistance.”\n\nFew historical details have made it into our history curriculum, but the whole point of militarising and Nazifying Germany was to invade and subjugate Russia. In 1935, Lord Lothian assured a delegation of visiting ministers from Germany that, “they would cut through Russia as through butter.”\n\nIt’s about collateral, not about “Democracy”. All the money in circulation represents debt. Debt represents assets on the bankers’ balance sheets. To conjure up more debt, they need to control the collateral: it directly boosts their wealth and power over us. To the rest of us it’s all the same: whether we pay money to Gazprom for our gas or to Royal Dutch Shell, we still have to pay.\n\nThat’s a LOT of collateral to turn into financialised flows for the banks if only they could get at it! Lord Acton prophesied long ago that, “the issue which has swept down the centuries, and which will have to be fought sooner or later, is The People versus the Bankers.” The battle is now upon us. The “monolithic and ruthless conspiracy” is waging an undeclared war on humanity, which may be the ultimate struggle between our emancipation and our enslavement. Source\n\nThe Power Behind the Throne and the Bankers’ Forever Wars https://www.globalresearch.ca/power-behind-throne-forever-wars/5851240\n\n[These are edited extracts from an article in the Daily Reckoning]. The Western financial system, having operated globally over the past 80 years, is coming to an end, and in its place, the bankers will attempt to introduce a new global financial system based upon Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC), Digital ID, and Universal Basic Income (UBI). The system will facilitate surveillance of the most intimate aspects of our lives and demand our absolute compliance. There is more to CBDCs than meets the eye:\n\nGovernments worldwide will soon be encouraging citizens to use CBDCs by applying the bait of free money known as UBI. A universal basic income of £1,600 a month is being trialled in England for the first time in a pilot programme that began nine months ago.\n\nCBDCs can have an expiration date, like some airlines’ frequent flyer miles, forcing people to spend them, for example, before the end of the month when they become worthless.\n\nCBDCs will enable devious social engineering by punishing and rewarding people in new ways. CBDCs can be programmed to work in restricted geographical areas, like 15-minute Cities.\n\nCBDCs, can deposit money into the accounts of those who comply with mandates, like the Vaxx, and deduct it from those who do not comply. Governments and global corporations will undoubtedly pair CBDCs with a form of social credit system.\n\nCBDCs are undoubtedly an instrument of enslavement. They represent a quantum leap backward for human freedom. However, the good news is that CBDCs are destined to fail.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean governments, corporations, and bankers won’t try implementing CBDCs, with immensely destructive consequences for many people who are unprepared to deal with the developing situation.\n\nIt’s important to remember the wise words of Ron Paul, “What none of them [politician]) will admit is that the market is more powerful than the central banks and all the economic planners put together. Although it may take time, the market always wins.”\n\nNo matter what edicts, decrees, or laws politicians pass, they will never be able to fully extinguish people’s desire to use alternatives to CBDCs.\n\nConsider that Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Lebanon, and many other countries restrict the use of US dollars. However, it creates a thriving black market—or, more accurately, a free market for US dollars and a parallel financial system.\n\nWe can expect the same kind of dynamic if governments impose CBDCs. I have no doubt significant parallel systems and underground markets will naturally emerge. Anyone who wants to avoid CBDC enslavement must adapt to live without access to bank accounts or traditional bankers’ money. [I shall be writing next time about how to do this because it has happened many times in the past.]\n\nThe central bankers and those behind them understand what will happen and this is why they aim to corral people into an Orwellian system that monitors and controls every penny of earnings, savings, and spending.

As the US is losing its hegemony we can follow the desperate actions that a failing superpower experiences.

Who Started the War?’ “The immediate trigger [for the start of a Special Military Operation [SMO]] was the refusal of Ukrainian authorities to implement the Minsk agreements,”\n\nVladimir Putin said in an interview with journalist Pavel Zarubin, “The only thing we can regret is that we did not take active action earlier, believing that we were dealing with decent people.” [tass.ru]. He said he did not “fully enjoy” the interview with Tucker Carlson, claiming that he was surprised that Carlson didn’t ask tougher questions. Putin described Tucker’s “patient” manner as a “tactic” uncommon among Western journalists. [tass.ru]\n\nOn the other hand, according to Joe Biden, “The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity.” (Joe Biden’s, Press conference, February 24, 2022). What is important to underscore is that NATO’s Secretary General, in a formal statement to the European Parliament, contradicts the official Biden narrative. He unequivocally confirms that the War started in 2014.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the SMO will be successfully completed despite the military operation taking longer than anticipated. “The special military operation began as an operation against Ukraine, over time it took the form of a war against the collective West, a war when the countries of the collective West, led by the United States, are directly involved in this conflict,” Peskov said. He added that even though the SMO “may last a little longer” than expected; the extended timeframe “will not change the course of things.” [rbc.ru]. “What is at stake,” the US President said, “We need to continue to fund Ukraine so that Ukraine can defend itself.” [svpressa.ru] Source\n\nBombshell: NATO Confirmed that the Ukraine “War Started in 2014”. Who Started the WAR?\n\nSO WHO IS AT FAULT? As in most conflicts, there is never only one party to blame – it takes two to tango. I researched by reading about the philosopher Alexander Dugin’s work, and he is calling attention to ‘The Great Awakening.’ Dugin is only alive because our good Lord decided so, but for that, he has paid an unimaginable price, and I’m sure he would much rather be dead when a Ukrainian terrorist car bomb aimed at him killed his daughter Daria Dugina.\n\nIn the aftermath of the historical Vladimir Putin interview with Tucker Carlson, Dugin wrote a short text that convinced me that there’s common ground to be found between Americans and Russians. Slavyangrad reported on ‘Tucker, Putin, and the Apocalypse – by Alexander Dugin,’ where ‘Putin’s mentor’ deeply connects with the looming American Conservative Revolution in a mind-blowing way. Here’s the text in a slightly abridged version below.\n\n“Why is Tucker Carlson’s interview considered pivotal for both the West and Russia?\n\nLet us start with the simpler part: Russia. […] For patriots, Tucker Carlson is simply ‘one of us’. He is a traditionalist, a right-wing conservative, and a staunch opponent of liberalism. This is what twenty-first-century emissaries to the Russian tsar look like. Thus, Russian patriots and Russian Westernisers (increasingly more Russian and less Western) come to a consensus in the figure of Tucker Carlson.\n\nIn the West, everything is even more fundamental. Tucker Carlson is a symbolic figure. He is now the main symbol of the America that hates Biden, liberals, and globalists and is preparing to vote for Trump. Trump, Carlson, and Musk, plus Texas Governor Abbott, are the faces of the looming American Revolution, this time a Conservative Revolution. To this already powerful resource, Russia connects.\n\nNo, it is not about Putin supporting Trump, which could easily be dismissed in the context of war with the United States. Carlson’s visit is about something else. Biden and his maniacs have effectively attacked a great nuclear power through the hands of Kiev’s unleashed terrorists, and humanity is on the verge of destruction. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe globalist media continue to spin a Marvel series for infants, where Spider-Man Zelensky magically wins with superpowers and magical pigs against the Kremlin’s ‘Dr. Evil’. However, this is just a cheap, silly series. In reality, everything is heading towards the use of nuclear weapons and possibly the destruction of humanity. Tucker Carlson conducts a reality check: does the West understand what it is doing, pushing the world towards the apocalypse?\n\nThere is a real Putin and a real Russia, not these staged characters and settings from Marvel. Look what the globalists have done and how close we are to it! It is not about the content of the interview with Putin. It is the fact that a person like Tucker Carlson is visiting a country like Russia to meet a political figure like Putin at such a critical time. Tucker Carlson’s trip to Moscow might be the last chance to stop the disappearance of humanity.\n\n[…] The world can only be saved by stopping now. For that, America must choose Trump. And Tucker Carlson. And Elon Musk. And Abbott. Then we get a chance to pause on the brink of the abyss. Compared to this, everything else is secondary. Liberalism and its agenda have led humanity to a dead end. Now the choice is this: either liberals or humanity. Tucker Carlson chooses humanity, which is why he came to Moscow to meet Putin. The whole world understood why he came and how important it is.” (Article by Paul Serran republished from ThePeoplesVoice.tv)\n\nAND the puzzle from last month: Comments from insider Edward Slavsquat. “As even anti-Kremlin liberals admit, Navalny was basically out of the picture by 2021, and he posed no meaningful threat to the upcoming elections. It would be strange for Putin to announce that he was ready to negotiate with Washington, and then a few days later order a murder that would likely make negotiations impossible. The timing of Navalny’s death is incredibly suspicious. There’s no way around that.\n\nHowever, if the West is able to kill Russia’s most high-profile political prisoner, this means Russian intelligence/security services are clearly compromised. Some have even suggested that pro-war hardliners in the Russian government ordered Navalny’s death to prevent a negotiated settlement in Ukraine, which would have likely involved unpopular compromises from both sides. Who knows? One thing is for sure, though: This is bad news for the peasants. Most news is bad news for the peasants. Sorry about that.”\n\nAnd the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko has warned that the world “has again come to the brink of the abyss” and that there are legitimate concerns that WW3 could erupt. Vladimir Putin‘s top ally said “we must be prepared as much as possible to neutralise risks and threats” as he spoke at a meeting with senior officials in Minsk. Lukashenko also announced that his army has received a new arsenal of weapons, including two missile divisions of the S-400 system and two divisions of Iskander missile systems. From a geopolitical perspective, the U.S. today has never been weaker than since the post-Vietnam era. Remember the images of U.S. helicopters taking off from its South Vietnamese embassy in 1975, loaded with refugees trying to escape the country? It was a national humiliation. So was also the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2022. Desperate Afghans, eager to escape Taliban rule, clung to American transports leaving Kabul.

The destruction of an entire country was then “privatised” in the early 1990s. Source – Ukraine, what is the end game?

The status of Taiwan, one of the strongest democracies in Asia, is among the most sensitive issues between the two superpowers, and focus will now turn to any potential show of force from Beijing in response.\n\nInstability is a word that you are going to hear a lot this year, because order is breaking down all over the planet.

He is one of France’s last independent thinkers, a category that has become a rarity… while we used to have so many.\n\nHe has just published a new book: “The Defeat of the West”.
