        "text": "“Only the victors have stories to tell. We, the vanquished, were all cowards and weaklings by then, whose memories, fears, and enthusiasms should not be remembered.”\n\nThe Forgotten Soldier\n\nGuy Sajer\n\nEditions Robert Laffont, 1967; translation copyright 1971 by Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc.\n\nAudible edition\n\nThe other side was bitter beyond belief.\n\n* * * *\n\nBy the spring of 1945, Germany was reduced to a smoldering ruin. One of the most advanced countries in the world saw every one of its cities obliterated into rubble and fire. Basic infrastructure such as water, sewage, electricity, transportation, and communication all but disappeared. Starvation reigned for three years after the Allies occupied Germany in what can only be described as a punitive famine designed for German prisoners of war (POWs) and German civilians alike. The death toll for Germany as a proportion of her population was staggering. For a country of approximately fifty million in 1939, some five million men were killed during the war, and civilian deaths from Allied bombing are estimated at another half a million. Up to two million more were forced into murderous labor in the Soviet Union’s notorious archipelago of prison camps with only a tiny fraction ever returning home.\n\nIn the West, the Allied forces committed their form of genocide against German POWs at the little-acknowledged Rheinwiesenlager camps, in which German and Axis prisoners were held in conditions that rivaled the notorious Confederate prison camp at Andersonville. In what was a criminal violation of the Geneva Convention, General Eisenhower’s staff decided that German soldiers should not be classed as POWs, but under a new and fictitious designation of “disarmed enemy forces” (DEFs). As DEFs, rather than POWs, the men were deprived of the Geneva Convention’s protections — they were starved, denied medical attention, and even rudimentary shelter. Although the precise number will never be available, some estimates put one million German POW deaths in Allied post-war concentration camps. German women, especially in the east, suffered the greatest phenomenon of mass rape in history at the hands of the Red Army. Some estimates are that two million German women were raped repeatedly — and almost a quarter of a million died as a result. And it wasn’t simply the Soviets, the U.S. Army is alleged to have raped almost 200,000 German women. And all of this says nothing of another crime against humanity: the ethnic cleansing of Germans through the forced expulsion of some sixteen million ethnic Germans in the former eastern territories of Germany (lost during either the First or Second World War — Austria-Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Czechoslovakia).\n\nMost of this is not known — or certainly ever talked about — by even those with a passing knowledge of World War II.\n\nBut all of this happened: what is shown cumulatively is that very few nations were destroyed to the extent that the German nation was destroyed during and after World War II. Wars often result in a terrible toll for the vanquished: what happened to Germany after World War II rivals almost anything in history. Nevertheless, what I have written would strike many as curious in the latter-day West; after all, who cares? Why would anybody bother with cataloging the suffering of Germans — especially after the Second World War? The implied but overwhelming sentiment is that if terrible things happened to German people during and after the war, Germany was egregiously culpable, and empathy should be our last concern. After all, they were “Nazis,” and the mere incantation of “Nazis” implicitly excuses any atrocity committed against Germany during or after the war. Popular albeit dubious books have been written such as Hitler’s Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust by Daniel Goldhagen, which argued in 1996 that the vast majority of ordinary Germans were “willing executioners” in the Holocaust because of a unique and virulent “eliminationist antisemitism” in German political culture. This type of sentiment is widely shared and widely disseminated such that the word “Nazi” has obtained a currency of almost demonic, sub-human proportions.\n\nIf this sounds like an idea alien to a Catholic ethos, it most certainly is.\n\nTo be interested or even empathetic to the enormous scale of German suffering is to invite suspicion that the humanizer must himself suffer from the same type of moral degeneracy as the Nazis themselves. Simply stated, taking stock of German wartime or post-wartime suffering — whether it be, for example, allied war crimes like the Dresden firebombing or the appalling treatment of German POWs by the Allied forces in the west or by “Uncle Joe” and the Soviet Union in the east — is verboten in polite Western company. Not, of course, as strictly verboten as questioning the scale or extent of the Holocaust, but verboten, nonetheless. For “conservatives” who now clutch their pearls at the excesses of contemporary “cancel culture,” the mirage of “free speech,” and the destruction of individuals for the espousal of unpopular or unconventional opinions, they do not seem to realize that “cancel culture” has been around for a very, very long time in the United States.\n\nAlas, it doesn’t matter much to me anymore.\n\nGermanic blood — along with that of the Celtic and Nordic peoples — courses through my veins. Far from being ashamed of it, I honor it. As I have gotten older — and less Americanist — I have come to appreciate my ancestry and the history of my people. The first principle of deracination is to uproot a man from his family and the communitarian aspect of his heritage — so, it follows, the first remedy against the deracinating impact of Americanism is to re-root me within my people and culture. For the sake of the obvious, such a reflowering of affection for a people and culture is not tantamount to a supremacist notion. My family and my heritage aren’t better than anyone else’s; it is just my own. Thus, I deny no man the right to glory in his heritage and ancestors, but I refuse to countenance those who would deny me the same. I do not have to justify the sympathy that I feel acutely for the plight of my extended kin, and yes, my kin are Europeans.\n\nAs a Catholic by spirit and a European by blood, it is enough for me to lament the horrors of World War II, which, like the First World War, was an unmitigated killing field for the people who made up Western Civilization — my birthright. I feel for the sufferers no matter where they lived or to what European nation they belonged. More to the point, as a Catholic, vengeance is not mine; I do not carry it against my enemy and I certain do not carry it against my kin. We all know that Germany lost and paid an horrific price in blood, soil, and reputation. And yet look at the dystopia which we have inherited. The Anglo-American world order of internationalist bankers, war profiteers, and industrialists won, and that order was imposed the world over. It is only now when the wretchedness and moral depravity at the heart of that order is being exposed are some — really a few — Americans waking up to a different narrative altogether. But here too the rabbit hole extends much deeper than we might imagine.\n\nMuch of what we “know” and believe about the Second World War is the overhang of grotesque anti-German propaganda manufactured in London, Washington, and Moscow during the war. It is hard to separate fact from fiction in this regard. Indeed, it is amazing how such propaganda can lose its palpable absurdity and morph over time into axiomatic “reality” — and a reality that cannot be questioned without suffering enormous consequences. The undeniable fact is that there are wide swaths of “history” that are morally beyond question, and which have obtained a quasi-religious status of an orthodoxy that can only be scrutinized if we are comfortable with the status of a secular heretic. What we must accept as unquestionable “fact” as it relates to German war crimes is therefore problematic on several levels. The issue is that even questioning the veracity, or the extent, of German war crimes is to expose oneself to the charge of “denialism,” as if critical scholarship itself that serves to find the truth is somehow dangerous. The problem becomes all the more acute when those who are defamed are in no position to rebut the absurdities because they are, well, dead. But then again much of what we know about most of U.S. history is so slanted that it borders on fabrication if it is not in fact a fabrication. It is incredible that most American “conservatives” still believe reflexively that Americans have always been the “good guys.” It is even more unbelievable for American Catholics to believe it. For my part, it is a childish naiveté and credulity that I find it more and more difficult to stomach the older I become. It is a testament to our brainwashing and conditioning that we lack even the rudiments of curiosity. At least since the Trump presidency, many Americans realize that the press and media are complete shills and liars. Seemingly the only good development in recent years has been the catastrophic loss of trust in American institutions of every variety. Such trust was always misplaced. Yes, the time will come for a reevaluation of everything that we were taught, but that time is not now — our cultural censors will not allow it, and the vast majority of our people are, to put it bluntly, too stupid to seek it.\n\nNow, some eighty years after the war, I feel no incentive to continue moral leprosy attributed to Germany when I stare now into the abyss of the American leviathan. Indeed, I have never been more estranged from the country of my birth than I am today. Moreover, even if I contextualize it, the horror of Stalin’s Soviet Union was much worse than Hitler’s National Socialism. That sentiment alone puts me in a category of the grossly immoral — a thought criminal by any conventional standard. Even if I concede their equality (which I do not), the support of the United States and Great Britain enabled the U.S.S.R. to continue enslaving millions of Russians and enslaving millions more other Europeans after WWII. Where is the “Truth & Reconciliation” committee for those crimes? If all Germans are responsible for Nazism, who then is responsible for the murderous monstrosity of the Soviet Union? Where is their commensurate excommunication? Whatever Germany did — or was alleged to have done — she paid for it richly. To use a Yiddish expression that I learned from an Orthodox Jew, it is time for rachmones, which means four things in one: mercy, compassion, forgiveness, and empathy. Typically, rachmones is something Jews only afford to other Jews based upon ties of blood and faith; here, I do the same for those whom I am tied to by blood and faith.\n\n* * * *\n\nWhen I was a young man, I raised my right hand and repeated the oath of enlistment to join the United States military. To preserve my obscurity, I will not belabor the details. That said, the act strangely stays fixed in my memory. It was not in a fit of patriotism that I did it although that played a small role. I was in the middle of college — home for Christmas break. At the time, and as mediated through a nineteen-year-old brain, I joined the military because, at least then, I wanted to become a history professor. My surmise was that having some facility and familiarity with the military and its culture would be helpful to that future career. The G.I. Bill would also help me finish college. I viewed myself as something akin to an academic observer of the military who would learn of it on-the-job, as it were. While I did not enlist to write a story, like George Plimpton’s Paper Lion, I joined to learn about the military more than to ever be in it — almost as if it were a sociological experiment. Only later, in the midst of it, did I realize how ridiculous that sentiment was, and only then did I think I should have joined because it was good in its own right.\n\nMy interest in history and my experience in the military, however, has never meant that I had an interest in the military or military life per se. Truth be told, the passions of my intellectual life have always vacillated between history, religion, politics, and philosophy. Stories of war for the sake of thinking about war held little appeal to me. As a boy at heart, bright, shiny metal things always grab my attention, so I occasionally find myself looking up pictures of armor, planes, tanks, jets, ramparts, or missiles but even this is ephemeral. Now, I have read seemingly hundreds of books on various wars, but I always read them in the context of movements of history, religion, and ideology. I have worn out all the titles I could find on the U.S. Civil War, WWI, and WWII. I have read book after book on the Crusades, the Reconquista, and other European wars. I have read Thucydides and Xenophon. I have read about Carthage and Actium. I have read about Malta and Lepanto. While some of them involve the unique suffering and trauma of being a warrior or a soldier, I never read them for that purpose. To put it bluntly, the “soldier’s story” genre of writing never interested me much, and neither did the strategy or tactics of war or the implements of war used. Indeed, I usually gloss over the pages of maps in such war books marked by arrows and troop movements.\n\nMy opinion of this genre, however, may change. In recently reading Guy Sajer’s memoir of a German soldier’s experience on the Russian front, The Forgotten Soldier, I must admit that I have found a book that moved me as few books of any genre have. It is as powerful as it is devastating — from start to finish — as anything that I have read, which is no small feat. When I take it all in, it is not the genre per se that makes this book what it is — no, it is a story of a soul subjected to suffering and deprivation that is almost incomprehensible coupled with an ability to communicate that suffering. As an inveterate reader, I say the following with some experience: sometimes a book “hits” a reader at a particular point in which the book was exactly what the reader wanted. Such moments in a reader’s life are relatively rare but the pure serendipity of finding something that you were looking for is similar to finding the pearl of great price. And, for whatever reason, I wanted to read this book. So, I realize that my praise of the book is flavored by the serendipitous time in which I read it. But all the same, I loved The Forgotten Soldier. Like any story, anguish is all too human and all too humanizing — in one way or another, it marks our time as fallen men. That type of story, which can take place in war but need not, is something if honestly presented by a sensitive soul that has the power to change us. But the reality is, however, that this is a consummate war book — and a war book that chronicles some of the most beastly modern warfare ever fought. And as the resting place for so many fallen comrades, it is a book that Sajer insists that we treat venerably as if we are walking hallowed literary ground. He tells us so bluntly in the beginning that this is no ordinary story:\n\nToo many people learn about war with no inconvenience to themselves. They read about Verdun or Stalingrad without comprehension, sitting in a comfortable armchair, with their feet beside the fire, preparing to go about their business the next day, as usual. One should really read such accounts under compulsion, in discomfort, considering oneself fortunate not to be describing the events in a letter home, writing from a hole in the mud. One should read about war in the worst circumstances, when everything is going badly, remembering that the torments of peace are trivial, and not worth any white hairs. Nothing is really serious in the tranquility of peace; only an idiot could be really disturbed by a question of salary. One should read about war standing up, late at night, when one is tired, as I am writing about it now, at dawn, while my asthma attack wears off. And even now, in my sleepless exhaustion, how gentle and easy peace seems!\n\nTruth be told, I understood from the beginning that Sajer was also no ordinary writer. But even if it is a book of death and war, a great book such as this one can be likened to a romance — a fit of love in a life otherwise ordinarily led. Such a book need not be a romance — all it needs to do is make us take stock of our lives and see the world through another’s eyes. If that is at least one test of a great book, The Forgotten Soldier is truly a great book. And I can say now that The Forgotten Soldier is a book that I will read again — and again — and that is something I can say of very few books.\n\n* * * *\n\nThe Forgotten Soldier is the memoir of Guy Sajer (pseudonym of Guy Mouminoux). It was written about twenty years after the war in a style that reads very much like a novel — Sajer reconstructs dialogue that it is difficult to imagine that he remembered with precision. Dates and places are often obscure — and it is implicit that the “fog of war” enveloped and excused his inability to tell something akin to a dispassionate narrative of his history in the Wehrmacht. His style of writing, perhaps in translation from French, can be repetitive at times, at least in terms of the frequent use of certain descriptors over and over again. That said, it has the feel of someone who was there, and I found authenticity in the arc of his descriptions. While some have accused Mouminoux of inventing The Forgotten Soldier out of whole cloth, the book never struck me as something that even hinted at fraud. The book indeed recounts so many near-misses of death — so many close encounters — that one is almost incredulous that anyone could have survived what he describes. Indeed, some critics of the book claim that it reads like the recounting of every soldier’s tale of woe in the east stitched together for drama and effect. To that I would respond the if someone survived the successive retreats from near the Volga to the Baltic Sea over three years, the account is more or less what I would expect. The incredulity is not in the account but that anyone survived. Moreover, the men that did survive would tell similar stories to what Sajer writes. The fact of their survival necessarily means that they were “lucky” compared with the hundreds of thousands who did not. The incredible nature of his survival then is not an argument against the book. We would not have had it otherwise.\n\nMouminoux was born in 1927 in Lorraine to a French father and German mother, whose maiden name was Sajer. He died in his mid-nineties in 2022 and found fame as a cartoonist and artist in France — and as a writer of The Forgotten Soldier. His mixed Alsatian ancestry looms large throughout the book. In 1942, as a young teenager, Mouminoux joined the Wehrmacht under his mother’s maiden name evidently to accentuate his German ancestry. In the beginning, he offers a glimpse of who he thought he was alongside portents of what was to follow:\n\nGuy Sajer … who are you?\n\nMy parents were country people, born some hundreds of miles apart — a distance filled with difficulties, strange complexities, jumbled frontiers, and sentiments which were equivalent but untranslatable. I was produced by this alliance, straddling this delicate combination, with only one life to deal with its manifold problems. I was a child, but that is without significance.\n\nThe problems I had existed before I did, and I discovered them. Then there was the war, and I married it because there was nothing else when I reached the age of falling in love. I had to shoulder a brutally heavy burden. Suddenly there were two flags for me to honor, and two lines of defense — the Siegfried and the Maginot — and powerful external enemies. I entered the service, dreamed, and hoped. I also knew cold and fear in places never seen by Lilli Marlene. A day came when I should have died, and after that nothing seemed very important. So I have stayed as I am, without regret, separated from the normal human condition.\n\nIt was not clear to me whether he enlisted or was conscripted. What is clear is that he volunteered for the Luftwaffe but was not accepted. After his initial training, Sajer was sent to a logistics/transportation unit (the Rollbahn) to load and drive trucks bringing supplies to the front in southern Russia. In the Rollbahn, he met several other men who would become his close companions throughout the war. He chronicles the war from his training through the destruction of the German army in the East to his brief sojourn and surrender in the West. The three years he recounts, almost all of which take place in the East, are the most gut-wrenching account of the war that I have ever read. Even though the book is virtually an uninterrupted story of privation, death, suffering, and misery, I was crestfallen to leave Guy Sajer — and for me, the sorrow at finishing a book is one of the telltale signs of its quality and poignancy.\n\n* * * *\n\nPart One (Autumn, 1942). The Forgotten Soldier starts in earnest with Sajer’s mission to supply the German front in Russia as a member of the Rollbahn. It seems clear, although unstated, that teenagers, older men, and disabled veterans were assigned to these logistics and supply support units at this point in the war. Sajer, as a teenager probably still baby-faced, was assigned to this unit. The dangerous trek of supplies and war matériel, which were shipped by train, truck, and beast of burden, was made over an incredible distance with the ultimate destination being the Sixth Army in Stalingrad. Most of the journey was made in the company of his new companions: Lensen, Olensheim, Neubach, and Hals, who spoke French.\n\nThe journey made during the late fall of 1942 into the early winter is itself a demonstration of the sheer logistical nightmare of what an invasion and occupation of a country the size of Russia meant. Warsaw to Stalingrad on the banks of the Volga River is more than 1,500 miles in distance — and this distance was traversed using 1940s diesel trucks on practically non-existent Soviet roads in cold that rivals the Artic circle. Sajer is candid in his view that he was not ready for the privations that the war was already imposing on him; he writes, “I can remember crying out between bursts of sobs: I’m too young to be a soldier.” The immensity of the logistical problems associated with just Sajer’s description of the small part he played in supplying troops along the far-flung Soviet front is a microcosm of why, even after success after success in the beginning, Germany’s defeat of the Soviet Union was always so precarious. The theme of the sheer and unforgiving expanse of Russia is played out over and over again throughout the book.\n\nHis unit faced considerable difficulty in managing to remain supplied and the transportation situation—grave to begin with—was seriously hampered by the freezing temperatures and constant snow. Temperatures that plummeted to twenty degrees below zero, diesel trucks that would not start, inadequate clothing and the accompanying frostbite, inadequate shelter, and wool gloves that became filled with holes from constant shoveling of snow were only part of the misery that was the Russian winter for the ill-prepared Sajer. He recounted the effect that the first dead body — a Soviet soldier — had on him on his initial trip east. The irony is not lost on the memoirist in Sajer — he would see many, many more. The soldiers suffered much from the cold and their freezing is a major preoccupation of this part. The Russian cold remained a thematic element throughout the book considering that Sajer went through three more winters before the end of the war, but the maddening cold is a constant refrain initially. It seems to me that the cold takes center stage early because it was Sajer’s first true enemy and he was ill-prepared to face it — later, combat, death, illness, exhaustion, and hunger would become enemies in a degree proportionate to the punishing cold. But here, it is one page after another of what, for example, a midnight watch is like in conditions of thirty-five degrees below zero.\n\nToward Stalingrad, Sajer’s traveled from Bialystok to Minsk, on to Kiev, and finally to Kharkiv. Surviving a few firefights, Sajer reached the eastern front to resupply fighting units only to learn that the Sixth German Army commanded by Field Marshall Paulus had been encircled and captured at Stalingrad. As if to anticipate what will come, Sajer foreshadowed the expected brutality that he can expect forthwith in the words of a desperate message from a trapped soldier in Stalingrad that a German officer reads to the assembled men as proof of German valor; it is:\n\nWe are the last seven survivors in this place. Four of us are wounded. We have been entrenched in the wreckage of the tractor factory for four days. We have not had any food for four days. I have just opened the last magazine for my automatic. In ten minutes the Bolsheviks will overrun us. Tell my father that I have done my duty, and that I shall know how to die. Long live Germany! Heil Hitler!’\n\nSajer recounted the horrors of the fighting that followed the fallout from the Wehrmacht’s defeat at Stalingrad and the first retreat from the Don. After Stalingrad, Sajer introduces a theme that will play a larger role as the book progresses and the German prospects deteriorated: namely, defeatism. As the war began to turn against Germany and the slow retreat westward was ordered, Sajer notes how a change occurred in the attitudes of German soldiers from staunch patriotism towards the will to survive regardless of ideologies and leaders. He notes after Stalingrad how the “older men were, generally speaking, defeatist, while the younger ones were determined to liberate their comrades,” probably because the younger soldiers had yet to witness the horrors of war.\n\nThere is an irony here that has application beyond Sajer’s observation; the young are almost always more instinctively heroic than the old — and the old cling to life much more tenaciously than the young. Sajer, as a very young man, exemplified anti-defeatism early on in the war, which was evident by his anger at an older soldier for feeling relieved about the surrender at Stalingrad, although his attitude later changed as he and his comrades became battle-hardened and battle-scarred veterans. It is not surprising to me that an older German soldier might have expressed relief at the prospect of not having to relieve Stalingrad with its building-to-building fighting — but it is cowardly all the same, i.e., better than a half million soldiers are annihilated than I face death to help them. Later the war would chasten his enthusiasm; Sajer said he and his comrades, fighting on the Second Dnieper Front against a superior Russian army, that they “no longer fought for Hitler, or National Socialism, or the Third Reich. … We fought from simple fear … for reasons which are perhaps shameful, but are, in the end, stronger than any doctrine.”\n\nDuring this first retreat, Sajer’s first true friend in the army, Ernst Neubach, was killed by Soviet strafing in a truck driven by Sajer filled with seriously wounded men. If the first dead body witnessed by Sajer shocked him with almost morbid curiosity and wonder, this death, while far from the last, broke him. During this first retreat and Neubach’s death, we catch a glimpse of Soviet air superiority and the havoc that it wreaked over German supply lines. Part of the terror of the book is that the men looked to the sky with dread because the Soviet planes always meant death for some of them. The Luftwaffe, while almost always superior to the Soviet air force when it was available, was outnumbered by a factor of 10 by the time Sajer and his compatriots began their retreat from the environs of Stalingrad. Later in the war, the German planes would be outnumbered by a factor of 100 and the buzz of planes in the sky always portended death from above. Neubach’s death, which took place in Sajer’s arms, was awful. He refused to accept the death of his friend and stopped the convoy with manful moxie to demand that someone treat his mortally wounded friend. The men of the convoy, which had to make good time to simply survive were incredulous that one more dying German amid so many wounded and dying men (who suffered without any care) should stop their progress. The entire episode was a brutal juxtaposition of personal anguish with the general insensitivity to great suffering. In the end, Sajer’s will prevailed; his demands were met and Neubach’s body was “buried” in a shallow grave while Sajer looked on in stupefied disbelief. Even in the mortars and shells, in the cold and hunger, the war became real for Sajer through the death of a friend in his arms. The progression of the memoir is one devastating blow after another for Sajer and his companions. The account itself is a testament to the incredible limits of human suffering and the capacity for finding some reason — really any reason — to put one foot in front of the other in the face of truly horrendous circumstances.\n\nAppendix: The Historical Context of The Forgotten Soldier.\n\nSajer’s account from 1942 to 1945 requires some historical context to appreciate his situation. The German Empire was cobbled together from varying German-speaking principalities and independent states under the leadership of Prussia in 1871. Coincidentally, Italy completed its national unification in the same year. The union of Germany was hastened by the stunning success of the Prussians in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–71. In the final days of the war, with German success all but assured, the German union was proclaimed as the German Empire under the Prussian King Wilhelm I and Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Except for Austria, almost all German speakers were united in a nation-state for the first time. Parenthetically, the word Reich is almost always translated into English as “empire,” but this definition, which has its imperial baggage, is not quite accurate. The word conveys meaning more akin to realm or domain — as in the Reich is the realm of the Germans. While Reich could be expansive and imperial, it need not be. The Treaty of Frankfurt that ended the Franco-Prussian War gave most of Alsace and parts of Lorraine, the Franco-German borderland between both countries, to Germany. It would remain under German sovereignty for the next fifty years until it was returned to France after the First World War. Alsace-Lorraine and its uniquely fused Franco-German character figure prominently in The Forgotten Soldier.\n\nWithout getting into the particulars of the causes of the First World War that began in August 1914, it is one of the few wars for which culpability is difficult to assign. For a war that ruined a continent (Europe) and destroyed a race (Europeans), it is disconcerting that such a war and carnage of untold proportions lacks a villain. It was simply a suicidal slaughter of epic proportions for no reason at all — yet the modern world as we know it was largely born in the aftermath of the First World War. Four empires ceased to exist and were carved up after the war (Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Ottoman) and many new sovereign countries were born out of their carcasses. Marxism-Leninism was first implemented at the level of a sovereign state in the husk of the former Russian Empire in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, which unleashed untold sorrows for the world. Even today, as it relates to the intersection of borders and ideology, the Ukrainian-Russian conflict has its antecedents in the aftermath of World War One.\n\nAfter four years of bitter fighting, a staggering death toll (on all sides), the entry of the United States against Germany in 1917, and the mass starvation of the German population in which some half a million civilians died of hunger brought about by the British naval blockade, the German government capitulated to an armistice famously signed on the eleventh day of the eleventh month (11/11/1918) or what we now know as Veteran’s Day in the United States. Armistice Day, as it used to be known, concluded in the infamous Treaty of Versailles in which much of the German Empire was dismembered, impoverished, and degraded. For a country that surrendered without ever being occupied and without being at fault for the war in any meaningful sense, Versailles was viciously and stupidly one-sided.\n\nTo compare the borders of the German Empire to its borders today (or its borders after Versailles) is to see the sheer extent of diminution of the German state. Millions of Germans were left outside of the newly shrunken Germany in 1919 — and left in new sovereign countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia. Prussia was carved up in particular. The cutting up of the German Empire to form new countries led to certain geographic anomalies: one of the larger German cities, the ancient port city of Danzig in East Prussia (now the Polish city of Gdansk), where some half million Germans lived as some 90% of its population, was cut off completely from the post-WWI German state and administered under Polish rule as a “free city-state.” To look at a map today is to see how far inside Poland Gdansk is — or, stated differently, how far Germany once extended. The famous “Sudetenland Crisis” in 1938, which concluded in the Munich Conference and Germany’s reabsorption of the Sudetenland (and its some three million ethnic Germans) from Czechoslovakia, was prompted by Versailles’s removal of those same Germans from the post-WWI German state. For a war that brought the world horrendous misery and destruction without sensible culpability, the grossly unfair obligations, terms, and national dismemberments of Versailles imposed by the victors (the Allied French, Germans, Americans, and Italians) at the expense of the vanquished (Germany, Austria-Hungry, and Ottomans) were, in hindsight, idiotic and immoral. If an honorable peace had been struck, there is little doubt that World War II would have never been fought.\n\nAmong many other reasons, Adolf Hitler’s rise to power is difficult to imagine without the humiliating specter of Versailles haunting Germany. Similarly, the rise of Marxism-Leninism in the Soviet Union and the threat that the Reds represented to Germany and other western European countries was another enormous factor as well. To make this point, it is worthwhile to revisit the party platform of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (the “NSDAP” or “Nazis”) that eventually swept the Nazis into power. Like all political parties, the Nazis put forward a program based on values, grievances, and vision. To read it now — or at least parts of it — almost a century later is to understand its appeal. It is noteworthy that the first three and a subsequent one of that platform deal expressly with Versailles (1–3, 22).\n\nWe demand the union of all Germans to form the Greater Germany on the basis of the people’s right to self-determination enjoyed by the nations.\n\nWe demand equality of rights for the German people in its dealings with other nations; and abolition of the peace treaties of Versailles and St. Germain.\n\nWe demand land and territory (colonies) for the sustenance of our people and colonization for our superfluous population.\n\n….\n\nWe demand abolition of the mercenary troops and formation of a national army.\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the importance of the Treaty of Versailles in the rise of the Nazis in Germany. And from a foreign policy perspective, everything that Germany pursued during the interwar period after the accession of Adolf Hitler in 1933 involved the reversal of the injustice done to Germany at Versailles and the restoration of Germany on terms similar to any other country. It is important to note that many non-Germans agreed that Germany’s grievances were legitimate. What is often overlooked is the success by hook or crook of the Third Reich’s attempt to reconstitute the extent and domains of Germany following Versailles: the reoccupation and remilitarization of German territory in the Rhineland (March 1936); German annexation of Austria or Anschluss (March 1938); German annexation of the Sudetenland following the Munich Conference (September 1938); and the return of the former Prussian territory of Memelland (now Klaipėda) (March 1939). (The siege of Memel in late 1944 and early 1945 figures prominently in The Forgotten Soldier.)\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Hitler’s final attempt to reconstitute Germany from its dismemberment following World War One ultimately led to World War Two. The precipitating factor was a diplomatic crisis over Danzig. Point 13 of President Woodrow Wilson’s infamous “14 Points” demanded that: “[a]n independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant.” By “access to the sea,” Wilson meant that Danzig, a thoroughly German city, and its deep-water port, should be ceded to Poland after the war. During the post-war negotiations, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George opposed Poland’s demand to take Danzig because its population was almost exclusively German. In a compromise, the Great Powers agreed that Danzig would become a “Free City” that would belong to neither Germany nor Poland, but both would have special rights in the city. The interwar status of Danzig was never clear: no one could agree whether it was a sovereign state, a state without sovereignty, a protectorate of Poland, or a protectorate of the League of Nations. The loss of Danzig — the so-called “Amsterdam of the East” — significantly wounded Germany’s national pride during the interwar period. It is not an exaggeration to compare it to wrenching Venice from Italy, Calais from France, or Manchester from England. For more than a year before the outbreak of World War Two in September 1939, negotiations over returning Danzig to Germany continued in what can only be described as a haphazard way: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Poland navigated German demands and Polish refusals intermixed with threats of war and war guarantees.\n\nPolish intransigence over Danzig proved its — and eventually Germany’s — catastrophic downfall. The invasion of Poland is inextricably tied to its refusal to return Danzig, an overwhelming German city both demographically and historically, to Germany. Considering the misery endured by the Poles and the Germans — and considering further that World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history with, by some estimates, some seventy million people perishing, was such intransigence worth it? While it is beyond absurd to blame Poland for World War II, I have often wondered if Poland knew her fate in defying what was to many at the time as reasonable German demands. If she knew that she would be smashed and occupied by the Soviets and Nazis and then subjected to almost fifty years of iron-fisted Soviet rule thereafter, would she have acted as defiantly over Danzig?\n\nGiven the cataclysm that was World War II, the anti-war phrase, “Why die for Danzig?, popularized on the eve of World War II in a Parisian newspaper, proved to be more than prophetic. It reflected a widespread view that Danzig, as a historically German city, ought to be returned to Germany, and, in any event, a dispute over Danzig ought not to serve as the impetus for World War II. Setting aside German colonies seized after WWI and some scattered Germans living throughout Poland, Danzig represented the last major enclave of Germans left outside of the Reich that was cut off as a result of Versailles. Perhaps Hitler would have made yet still more demands for Germany if Poland had capitulated on the question of Danzig’s return to the Reich, but we will never know.\n\n* * * *\n\nWorld War II began on September 1, 1939, with the German invasion of Poland. Only ten days earlier, the Soviet Union and the Third Reich signed the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact on August 23, 1939 — the public part of the pact provided for non-aggression between the powers; the non-public protocols divided up eastern Europe in Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence following the expected defeat of Poland. Two and a half weeks after the German invasion began from the West, the Soviets invaded Poland from the east on September 17, 1939, and the two powers essentially split the former country into two. Notably, France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany for its invasion on September 3, 1939, but remained remarkably circumspect when the Soviets invaded Poland just weeks later. Without an eastern flank to worry about compliments of the German-Soviet Pact, Hitler took the step to launch the war without hesitation. In less than nine months following, Hitler would smash the Allied forces in the West in May 1940 — driving the British into a perilous and crushing retreat from Dunkirk and the French into a humiliating armistice after overrunning the country. By the summer of 1940, Hitler controlled or was allied with, virtually all of Western and Central Europe except the British Isles. The British, now fighting Germany alone, valiantly defended her home islands during the fall of 1940 in the Battle of Britain but continued to lose battles and ground to the Axis forces throughout the various theaters of the war. The success of the Germans pushed the British to the brink; had the war not broken out between the Germans and the Soviets during 1941 and had the Axis powers pivoted instead towards Persia and the lifeblood of oil for the British Empire, it is more than possible that Britain would have sued for peace given its perilous position. But Hitler’s monumental decision to invade the Soviet Union in June 1941 strengthened Churchill’s resolve to continue the fight now that Germany would be engaged on two fronts. More than that, Germany’s decision decided the fate of Europe — and the world — for generations to come.\n\nBut even the step to attack the U.S.S.R. taken by the Germans is little understood. As a sidebar, one book that describes the Soviet-German conflict in a way that is both convincing and controversial is The Chief Culprit: Stalin’s Grand Design to Start World War II by Viktor Suvorov, a former Soviet intelligence officer. Suvorov describes Operation Barbarossa as a preemptive defensive war by the Germans in response to an imminent invasion by the Soviets. Suvorov discredits the theory that Stalin was duped by Hitler or that the Soviet Union was a victim of Nazi aggression. Instead, he argues that Stalin neither feared Hitler nor mistakenly trusted him. He shows how Hitler’s intelligence services detected the Soviet Union’s massive preparations for war against Germany. This detection, he argues, led to Germany’s proactive war plan and the launch of an invasion of the Soviet Union. He argues that the reason the Soviets performed so poorly at the beginning of the war was because they were assembled, in mass with enormous numbers of troops and amounts of war material, on the Western border in preparation for an invasion. Hitler’s largely unexpected attack enveloped a massive force unprepared for a defensive war that was promptly encircled and annihilated. Suvorov goes so far as to claim that had the Germans not attacked and pushed the Soviets back as far as they did, all of Western Europe up to the Atlantic Ocean would have been behind the Iron Curtin.\n\nOperation Barbarossa was the largest invasion force ever assembled and it initially demonstrated again the successes of the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe — pushing the Soviets back to Moscow and Leningrad in the north and Stalingrad in the south. Belarus, Ukraine, and the Baltic countries were completely occupied by Axis forces. By the end of 1941, some 700,000 square miles of Soviet territory and almost six million Soviet POWs were in German hands. By the end of 1941, even with the American entry into World War II, a decisive German victory over the Soviet Union seemed not merely likely but almost certain.\n\nFor many reasons, not the least of which was the intoxicating spirit of victory and the opportunity to fight the menace of communism and the diabolical Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht in 1941 was an attractive prospect for young men throughout much of Western Europe — and hundreds of thousands of non-Germans joined and fought either in Wehrmacht or the Waffen SS. In addition, it is estimated that more than a million Soviet citizens fought in the German forces against the Soviet Union when allowed to escape the Soviet yoke. Parenthetically, the current crisis in Ukraine is, at least by some measures, a continuation of the resistance of the Western Ukrainians against the Russo-Soviets. Much as Vladimir Putin likes to point out, it is a fact that Stepan Bandera, leader of the Ukrainian nationalists during World War II, was a committed ally of the invading Germans and fought side-by-side with them against the Soviet Union. On January 22, 2010, Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko honored Stepan Bandera by posthumously bestowing on him the state honor, “Hero of Ukraine.” To describe Bandera as a blatant Nazi sympathizer is to put it mildly indeed.\n\n===\n\nPart Two (Spring, 1943–Summer, 1943).\n\nThe retreat culminated in a reorganization of German units and lines beyond the Don River. Parenthetically, much of the book is organized around the various retreats to rivers and then eventually to the sea. They formed natural front lines to be held only to see the Germans pushed back until they reached the terminus of their retreat in East Prussia on the Baltic Sea (at which the body of water was behind them). At the point that they reached relative and momentary safety beyond the Don, Sajer and his compatriots were still affiliated with fragmented support units. Several hundred men are organized into a parade ground and asked to volunteer for the Gross Deutschland Division (or Großdeutschland, an elite infantry regiment). First, a few men volunteer but the recruiting officer vacillates between shaming those who do not volunteer to offering sweeteners. Finally, when a two-week leave home is offered for volunteers, Sajer and his companions agree.\n\nAfter initial training in June 1943, the men received their leave and Sajer traveled back to Germany with Hals by train. The slow journey was delayed several times by bombardment and the soldiers were enlisted to clear wreckage. Finally, Hals and Sajer reached Berlin and parted ways. Sajer decided to visit Neubach’s parents before continuing to Alsace, which Hals sought to dissuade him from doing. Hals was proven right — Sajer’s detour into Berlin ended up eating up his entire leave. The bombardments were bad enough that Sajer never was allowed to leave Berlin as the Allied bombing campaigns created civilian havoc and the soldiers still in Berlin were keelhauled into assisting the recovery crews. Sajer walked through Berlin, his first time there, and was surprised to see both the precise order of the city coupled with the devastation of the Allied air raids. It is a reminder that not only was Sajer young, but he was also a wide-eyed country boy from a village. That he was impressed with the efficiency and order of Berlin is a theme that runs throughout the book — he was generally impressed with German order and contrasts it with the relative lack of it that he had seen in France. It is something that endears Germany to him.\n\nUpon calling on the Neubach family, who have now lost two sons in the war, Sajer meets the family’s neighbors including a teenage girl named Paula. Sajer and Paula enjoy an intense two-week romantic relationship in which they are effectively betrothed. Paula is every bit the stereotype of a young German woman — modest, pretty, steadfast, patriotic, intelligent, virtuous, and noble. Out of all of the characters in the book, she is the easiest for me to picture in my mind’s eye as if “Paula” was drawn from central casting. It is hard to assess the reliability of a soldier in his description of a woman, especially when that soldier is both very young and has been separated from women for a long time. After what he had been through, any reasonably friendly teenage girl would have seemed like heaven to him. That said, Sajer’s description of Paula appeared to justify his affection. She was a remarkable young woman. The relationship which takes place in the middle of the book, more or less, is like an interlude of relative normality. It is the stuff of young beating hearts and the ineffable swoon of love for the first time — in fair weather no less. Here is a young man who fell head over heels for a pretty young girl, and his obsession with her was probably accentuated by the privations he had suffered over the previous year. Unlike other young lovers in any other context, they spent much of their time digging out men, women, and children out of the ruins created by Allied bombing and tending to the wounded, and burying the dead. The specter of little children being pulled from the debris only to be left as crying orphans is a reminder of the toll.\n\nOne vignette still sticks with me regarding Sajer’s time in Berlin: Sajer and Paula escaped for a picnic on the outskirts of Berlin. It is a perfect June day, and the love of spring is intoxicating among these young people. Their park-like location was not far from a German air force base, which is visible in the distance. Their picnic was interrupted by a bombing raid that took place very nearly over their heads — enough for Sajer, who was experienced enough to know what to do during a bombing raid — to make Paula run for cover. The ruin of the picnic is a metaphor for the relationship between Sajer and Paula — the war and the times refused to allow them an opportunity to be with one another and no matter the fire of their affection, it was doomed.\n\nHis father’s surprise visit to him in Berlin was seen by Sajer as depriving him of precious time to see Paula. In addition to the reversals in the east and the bombing raids in the west, it was through his father that Sajer comes to grips that the war was going badly for the Germans. The looming defeat for the German foot soldier was something that was doled out in chunks — even after the German defeat at Stalingrad and the retreat to the Don, Sajer still had not grasped the perilousness of the German position. His father’s remarks struck him like a thunderbolt and the prospect of defeat hit him for the first time. His father’s visit was an interlude within an interlude within an interlude — Sajer is confronted by someone who palpably disapproves of the Germans and who exhibits something between disappointment and disillusion that his son was serving in the Wehrmacht. His father’s silent censure was yet one more psychological pressure applied to this teenager’s psyche in what was a crucible of enormous proportions.\n\nIf his father’s news of the declining fortunes of Germany came as a surprise to Sajer, these pressures are magnified when the war becomes more and more lost on the ground in front of him. This collective disillusionment of the foot soldiers compared with the propaganda that they are fed is also a theme that works itself throughout the book. Disillusionment here is something different from defeatism; if the latter is a moral defect in a soldier, the former is a psychological condition of constantly fighting a losing war. Disillusionment cuts against a necessary and universal sentiment needed for the morale of any army — hope — and all soldiers are told that they are righteous warriors, and every soldier is told that his cause is not lost until it is lost. The twilight between the knowing that vanquishment is coming, and actual vanquishment is something that is explored in the psychology of Sajer and his companions. The mental toll of defeat — especially in total war — is staggering. It is clear that Sajer himself never quite recovered and The Forgotten Soldier is an exhibition of the toll that defeat took upon him etched in five hundred pages. For Sajer, the anxiety was magnified because of his compromised “Germanness.” Much of the book is about Sajer’s vacillations between attempting to prove his “Germanness” to discouragement that he could not.\n\nAfter Sajer’s two week leave, he painfully separated himself from Paula and boarded a train east for Großdeutschland training. Notwithstanding that they corresponded regularly during the war — or at least while the German military postal service continued to function — he never saw her again. Left unstated is her fate, which given what the Soviets did to German women and girls (from the ages of eight to eighty), it is stomach-churning to think of her fate if she had survived the Allied bombing raids. It is horrifying enough to say abstractly that so many German women in the east were subjected to repeated and systematic mass rapes — it is quite another to say that someone we know — i.e., Paula — was subjected to them by Soviet animals.\n\nAfter his leave, Sajer and his friends rejoined the Großdeutschland and underwent “brutal” training with Hauptmann (Captain) Fink for about three weeks as a full initiation into the Großdeutschland. Sajer credited this training as transitioning him from a Rollbahn man into a fighting soldier. He noted that a few of his fellow initiates were killed during the training, which involved physical punishment and sometimes the use of live ammunition that put the lives of the trainees at serious risk. It is hard to know how true to life his description was — at least part of it strikes me as potentially spurious. On one hand, the most valuable commodity an army has is its men, and training — even for elite divisions — may be exceedingly difficult and physically demanding but it is not something that subjects men to unnecessary dangers (like firing live ammunition over their head to make a point). On the other hand, by this point — the summer of 1943 — Sajer and his fellow trainees were far from the best men to be considered for elite training units like the Großdeutschland — men like these would have never been considered in the earlier stages of the war. But after suffering enormous casualties, the bar for admission was presumably lowered based upon necessity. Men who were on the bubble of being Großdeutschland soldiers might have required training that was harsher than more conventional training. The other point to consider is that intense military training is designed to replicate, as much as possible, the conditions of war without wanton dangers. In that, the best training would make trainees feel as if their lives were in danger so it is possible that Sajer, as a then seventeen-year-old recruit, might have surmised incorrectly that his life was in fact in danger. He might have been told that Fink was firing live ammunition when he in fact was not, in order to heighten the training experience. From what I understand, there are no records of Sajer’s Großdeutschland unit number, which indicates that it was created later in the war to make up for the division’s crippling losses. It is a section like this, among other things, that has seen many critics criticize Mouminoux as attempting to pass off a Roman à clef, or a realistic novel passed off as a memoir. There are many ulterior motives why critics have attacked Mouminoux for writing this book, which are touched upon later in this review, but suffice it to say that his description of his Großdeutschland training is part of the critique of the authenticity of this account. Ironically enough, Sajer viewed the brutal training administered by Hauptmann Fink for his later survival through the hellhole that was the constant German combat under nonstop Soviet attacks.\n\n* * * *\n\nPart Three (Autumn 1943). Following his training and initiation in the Großdeutschland, Sajer and his compatriots were assigned to a unit under Hauptmann Wesreidau to defend a new front against the Russian effort to recapture Kharkiv. In addition to Wesreidau, Sajer introduced another pivotal character, August Wiener, who is almost exclusively referred to as “the Veteran” throughout the book. The Veteran was older and fought in Russia since the beginning of the German invasion. He was a skilled machine gunner who was seldom without his Maschinengewehr 42, or “machine gun 42”. Unlike all of the other German soldiers, the veteran had picked up the Russian language. The Veteran and Sajer met on the Belgorod front, where they were assigned to the same assault unit. Sajer initially found the Veteran’s cynicism unbecoming. Within a few hours of heavy fighting, however, Sajer comes to trust the Veteran’s instincts for battle and sense of self-preservation during combat. In particular, Sajer and his compatriots were saved by the Veteran who disobeys an officer’s order to hold a position because it is about to be overrun — in the retreat that the Veteran ordered over the ferocious objections of the officer, the men barely escaped from certain destruction and the officer was killed. From that point on, the Veteran’s credibility was accepted without question. The Veteran was wounded at Belgorod but rapidly recovers. He was later seriously wounded during the Soviet success on the second Dnieper front. Eventually, at the later point of the Veteran’s self-sacrificing death, an impressed Sajer will muse that the Veteran should have directed the entire German army or have been the “Fuhrer”.\n\nSajer’s unit is led by Hauptmann Wesreidau. Wesreidau is the consummate German officer. The battle-scarred soldiers approved of him fully, especially the Veteran. Sajer was in awe of him. Wesreidau’s men developed an almost fanatical devotion to him — and he was the first and last officer where such a sense is apparent. If the war had previously been presented as chaotic and gratuitous, Wesreidau put forth their cause and privations in a heroic context. Wesreidau’s words were the stuff of real motivation compared with the canned messages of patriotism and duty provided by the German high command that Sajer heard parroted by other commanding officers throughout the book.\n\nIn the telling of Sajer, we catch a glimpse in Wesreidau’s unit of the elan of Großdeutschland that reminded me not necessarily of Nazi indoctrination but rather of a much older German tradition of the “comitatus”. That term has been used to describe the ancient Germanic warrior culture for a warband tied to a leader by an oath of fealty and the almost familial relations between a lord and his retainers, or thanes. It was not the pursuit of glory in battle that marked the comitatus that necessarily reminded me of Wesreidau’s men but rather the code of the comitatus that demonstrated the incredible bond between the warrior and his lord. The lord was supposed to surpass his men in courage and bravery. Wesreidau and his men embodied this type of relationship.\n\nBetween the Veteran and Wesreidau, we see an unflinching loyalty that Sajer never loses throughout the book. One of the implicit themes of the various critical assessments of The Forgotten Soldier is incredulity at Mouminoux’s refusal to condemn the Wehrmacht or the German cause. Indeed, it is precisely in this obtuseness that so many critics have been so harsh towards Mouminoux and this book. The critics, of course, assign moral leprosy to Germany during the war, and Mouminoux, while no apologist for Hitler or the Nazis, seems to defend his participation on the grounds of patriotism and in the remembrance and valor of the men involved. This cuts too close to an unforgivable equivocation of alleged German villainy for modern ears. Whatever the cause, it seems to me that his devotion to his fellow German soldiers is animated by the Veteran and Wesreidau more than anyone else — to put it bluntly, these two men justify everything. Mouminoux wants the memory of the sacrifice and privations of his compatriots remembered with the honor to which he believed that they were entitled — even if they were vanquished.\n\nThe moral gloss that Wesreidau offered his men for Germany’s cause that Sajer reconstructs in The Forgotten Soldier is, as much as anything, a justification for what Mouminoux continued to believe long after the war was lost. Wesreidau’s words still haunt me; they are compelling enough to quote at length:\n\nGermany is a great country. Today, our difficulties are immense. The system in which we more or less believe is every bit as good as the slogans on the other side. Even if we don’t always approve of what we have to do, we must carry out orders for the sake of our country, our comrades, and our families, against whom the other half of the world is fighting in the name of truth and justice. All of you are old enough to understand that. I have done a good deal of traveling —to South America, and even to New Zealand. Since Spain, I have fought in Poland and France, and now Russia — and I can tell you that everywhere there are the same dominating hypocrisies. Life, my father, the example of former times — all of these taught me to sustain my existence with rectitude and loyalty. And I have clung to these principles in spite of all the hardships and follies which have been my lot. Many times, when I could have responded with a thrust of the sword, I only smiled, and blamed myself, assuming that I myself was the cause of all my troubles.\n\nWhen I had my first taste of war, in Spain, I thought of suicide — it all seemed so vile. But then I saw the ferocity of others, who also believed in the justice of their cause, and offered themselves up to acts of murder, as to a purification. I watched the soft, effete[ness] of [the] French shift from terror to toughness, and take up the arms they couldn’t use when they needed them, once we had restored their confidence, and offered them the hand of friendship. In general, human beings don’t accept the unaccustomed. Change frightens and upsets them, and they will fight even to preserve situations they have always detested. But a slick armchair philosopher can easily arouse a rabble to support an abstract proposition — for instance, “all men are equal” — even when the differences between men are obviously as great as the differences between cows and roosters. Then those exhausted societies, drained by their ‘liberty,’ begin to bellow about their ‘convictions’ and become a threat to us and to peace. It’s basic wisdom to keep people like that well fed and content, if one wishes to extract even a tenth of the possible return.\n\nSomething of this kind is happening on the other side. As a people, we are fortunate in being somewhat less indolent than they. If someone tells us to examine ourselves, we at least have the courage to do it. Our condition is not absolutely perfect, but at least we agree to look at other things, and take chances. We are now embarked on a risky enterprise, with no assurance of safety. We are advancing an idea of unity which is neither rich nor easily digestible, but the vast majority of the German people accept it and adhere to it, forging and forming it in an admirable collective effort. This is where we are now risking everything. We are trying, taking due account of the attitudes of society, to change the face of the world, hoping to revive the ancient virtues buried under the layers of filth bequeathed to us by our forebears. We can expect no reward for this effort. We are loathed everywhere: if we should lose tomorrow those of us still alive after so much suffering will be judged without justice. We shall be accused of an infinity of murder, as if everywhere, and at all times, men at war did not behave in the same way. Those who have an interest in putting an end to our ideals will ridicule everything we believe in. We shall be spared nothing. Even the tombs of our heroes will be destroyed, only preserving — as a gesture of respect toward the dead — a few which contain figures of doubtful heroism, who were never fully committed to our cause. With our deaths, all the prodigies of heroism which our daily circumstances require of us, and the memory of our comrades, dead and alive, and our communion of spirits, our fears and our hopes, will vanish, and our history will never be told. Future generations will speak only of an idiotic, unqualified sacrifice. Whether you wanted it or not, you are now part of this undertaking, and nothing which follows can equal the efforts you have made, if you must sleep tomorrow under the quieter skies of the opposite camp. In that case, you will never be forgiven for having survived. You will either be rejected or preserved like a rare animal which has escaped a cataclysm. With other men, you will be as cats are to dogs and you will never have any real friends. Do you wish such an end for yourselves?\n\nAnyone who wishes to go but is hesitating from fear of our authority should speak to me; I will take as many nights as it needs to reassure you. I repeat: those who wish to leave should do so. We cannot count on men who feel that way, and our efforts cannot gain from their presence. Please believe that I understand your sufferings. I feel the cold and fear as you do, and I fire at the enemy as you do, because I feel that my duty as an officer requires at least as much from me as your duty does of you. I wish to stay alive, even if it’s only to continue the struggle somewhere else. I wish my company to be united in thought and in deed. Once the fighting begins, I will not tolerate doubt and defeatism. We shall be suffering not only in the interests of ultimate victory, but in the interests of daily victory against those who hurl themselves at us without respite, and whose only thought is to exterminate us, without any understanding of what is at stake. You can feel certain of me, in return, and certain that I will not expose you to any unnecessary dangers.\n\nI would burn and destroy entire villages if by doing so I could prevent even one of us from dying of hunger. Here, deep in the wilds of the steppe, we shall be all the more aware of our unity. We are surrounded by hatred and death, and in these circumstances we shall daily oppose our perfect cohesion to the indiscipline and disorder of our enemies. Our group must be as one, and our thoughts must be identical. Your duty lies in your efforts to achieve that goal, and if we do achieve it, and maintain it, we shall be victors even in death.\n\nSuch a man was Wesreidau.\n\nNotwithstanding valor in defense, the German defeats at Kursk and Belgorod hastened a sustained and disorderly retreat toward the Dnieper River. The Soviet troops almost overwhelmed Sajer’s unit — and encircled them at one point — but the Germans fought desperately to escape annihilation. During this retreat — and of all the many that are recounted — the conditions of the flight, the breakdown of logistics and support, the hunger and weather, and the sheer carnage of wounded men limping towards survival were harrowing and horrifying. Sajer described the evacuation to the west bank of the Dnieper, south of Kiev; it was dramatic, blood-soaked, and chaotic. Minutes of being stranded on the east bank of the Dnieper felt like hours — strafed by Soviet planes and menaced by Soviet tanks — the Germans experienced an excruciating waiting game in which the last ones to be moved were sure to die. Men by the hundreds perished in the vain hope that they would be ferried next to what they thought would be a serviceable front line. Some jumped into the wide and freezing river to swim for it — and none of them made it. Eventually, Sajer made it across as one of the “lucky” ones only to be met with relative chaos on the western side.\n\nPart Four (Winter 1943 — Summer 1944)\n\nFollowing Sajer’s evacuation to the west bank of the Dnieper River, the anticipated German camp where they will be refitted and allowed to rest and recover proves to be an illusion. The chaos that reigned along the east bank is mitigated on the west bank but not eliminated. For men used to German exactitude within the Wehrmacht, the disorder was disconcerting. They are left in the open and then interrogated by military police who seem to view them as cowards if not outright traitors for their retreat. It is a jarring sequence; we know the hell that Sajer and the other survivors endured just to make it to the west bank — their courage and almost-superhuman will to live was beyond doubt. Yet, the retreating men were treated with derision. And the hope that the mighty Dnieper River would stall the Soviet onslaught also proved to be illusory — desperate fighting takes place along the entire front with Kiev being the Soviet focal point. It is at this point that the sheer advantage of Soviet matériel became overwhelming and they appeared to gain almost complete air superiority — to say nothing of the seemingly inexhaustible supply of Soviet soldiers.\n\nFrom the Dnieper, the new German front largely broke, although not without fierce fighting. The Germans were hurled back again in a chaotic and sanguinary retreat through Ukraine. Sajer was, at this point, very sick — and indeed he was sick for seemingly much of the latter half of the book. He developed dysentery and recounted how, in what must have been excruciating, he soiled himself on a moving truck while in acute abdominal pain. He was mortified by the time he finally made it to something like a field hospital — filthy and disgusting in every sense of the term. He was promised leave to rehabilitate but it was cancelled as the situation continued to deteriorate. He is forced to man the line while his illness was still raging. He did this several times. When he and his fellow soldiers were reunited with Hauptmann Wesreidau a few weeks later, Wesreidau asked him if he recovered during his leave to which he responded that he never was able to take it. Wesreidau, as a father figure to Sajer, expressed that enormous sacrifices were expected from all of them. To Sajer’s surprise, his Großdeutschland regiment was fully equipped and supplied with the best of what the Wehrmacht had left and was used as a mobile force sent to weak points in the German lines. While the entire German front continued to collapse, the regiment was moved from one emergency to the next. But at least during this brief period, Sajer tasted victory over the Soviets as opposed to continual retreat. The mobile unit harried the Soviets in offensive action in an otherwise defensive German posture, which was followed inevitably by another retreat. Later, the irony of his “mobile” unit was that it would still be called a “mobile” unit long after it was reduced, either from want of fuel or machines, to being solely on foot.\n\nThroughout the book, and it doesn’t matter when, Sajer describes combat in excruciating detail. The horror and fear are palpable in virtually every combat setting. One description of engagement suffices to convey Sajer’s ability to communicate what he experienced with the caveat that there are many more just like it:\n\nWhat happened next? I retain nothing from those terrible minutes except indistinct memories which flash into my mind with sudden brutality, like apparitions, among bursts and scenes and visions that are scarcely imaginable. It is difficult even to try to remember moments during which nothing is considered, foreseen, or understood, when there is nothing under a steel helmet but an astonishingly empty head and a pair of eyes which translate nothing more than would the eyes of an animal facing mortal danger. There is nothing but the rhythm of explosions, more or less distant, more or less violent, and the cries of madmen, to be classified later, according to the outcome of the battle, as the cries of heroes or of murderers. And there are the cries of the wounded, of the agonizingly dying, shrieking as they stare at a part of their body reduced to pulp, the cries of men touched by the shock of battle before everybody else, who run in any and every direction, howling like banshees. There are the tragic, unbelievable visions, which carry from one moment of nausea to another: guts splattered across the rubble and sprayed from one dying man to another; tightly riveted machines ripped like the belly of a cow which has just been sliced open, flaming and groaning; trees broken into tiny fragments; gaping windows pouring out torrents of billowing dust, dispersing into oblivion all that remains of a comfortable parlor.\n\nIn the long retreat through Ukraine, Sajer introduced a new enemy in the guise of newly emboldened “partisans” whom Sajer and the other soldiers despised. Despite the relative successes of Sajer’s unit, the German lines continued to deteriorate across the southern front. There is then a book within a book in which Sajer detailed a war against the partisans during the German withdrawal, which added a new layer of anxiety and trauma for the soldiers. He notes how the same Ukrainian villages that welcomed the Germans as liberators from the Soviet yoke were now crawling with partisans and the unexpected violence that they brought to bear on the retreating Germans. The partisans also exacted a toll on the native population who were suspected of aiding the Germans and made otherwise friendly people wary and unhelpful. It was during this long retreat through Ukraine that Sajer witnessed the death of Hauptmann Wesreidau, who was killed when his car leading the caravan was destroyed by a partisan mine. The death of Wesreidau was a seminal moment for Sajer and the book — the war may have been lost by any measure at that point, but the death of Wesreidau seems to mark the defeat for his men. Collectively, they could not process his death even though they had seen, as a group, thousands of bloodied and disemboweled corpses strewn across the Russian Steppe. At least with Wesreidau, they had a commander who would shepherd them through the worst of what was to come; without him, they were like children without a father.\n\nThe partisan aggression grew fiercer as they were supplied by the Soviets with more and more sophisticated weaponry and tactics. Sajer notes another partisan engagement in which he was personally involved with the firefight that left virtually all of the partisans dead — partisans who had derailed a train going back to the front and killed more than a hundred weary German soldiers. Commanded by a group of the S.S., Sajer and other soldiers successfully attacked the partisan stronghold, and in the melee that ensued, Sajer killed his first partisan at very close quarters. A few of the partisans are captured and executed. The S.S. commander justified his actions because the “laws of war condemned them to death automatically, without trial.” Writing twenty years after the war, Sajer drips with anger towards the partisans. He viewed them as something like snakes who violated the rules of war that even the Soviets understood. He also agreed ultimately with the harsh justice meted out to partisans, noting without objection that, “partisans were not eligible for the consideration due to a man in uniform. The laws of war condemned them to death automatically, without trial.”\n\nPart Five (Autumn, 1944 — Spring, 1945)\n\nThe German army was pushed from Ukraine. For Sajer and his compatriots, the escape was through Romania into Poland. Like similar retreats, this one was completely disorganized and marked by hunger and desperation. The men traveled back in packs and found a disabled German truck filled with provisions — they glutted themselves after weeks of starvation but only to have two of their group arrested by the military police on the route back and subsequently hanged as thieves. Sajer’s group was eventually organized with other retreating elements and a march back to Poland commenced. Once in Poland, and notwithstanding seemingly complete Soviet air superiority, the men were reorganized again. A theme that runs throughout the book: each successive retreat, which was costly in terms of men and matériel, forced the reorganization of the remaining forces into either a reconstituted version of their earlier units or scratch units altogether. Sajer, Lensen, Hals, and others were greeted again by the rigors of military discipline, which after their ordeal during the last several months was unwelcome. They were placed under the command of Hauptmann Wollers and sent to Lodz where they were resupplied. Sajer notes that many replacements were old men or virtual children; he wondered how these troops would be useful in combat. The Veteran rejoined the group where the division was regrouped and recounted recuperation in Germany; observing that German cities had been bombed into rubble. His ear was also missing. The Veteran explained to the group that this was total war.\n\nThe reorganized unit moved to relieve the German soldiers fighting on the northern front and they traversed on foot a new nightmare of endless miles without water or any available provisions. Some have complained that Sajer exaggerated the lack of food during the war but his refrain regarding hunger took center stage very late in the war. Considering that the Wehrmacht had a short supply of trucks, fuel, railcars, and men over a collapsing front the length of Russia, it does not strike me as surprising that the remaining troops would have been lacking food — even for days and weeks. Days of grinding hunger and fatigue blended with the endless and flat terrain in what can only be described as something otherworldly and wretched. It is at this point we wonder, perhaps more globally, what prompted Sajer and his fellow soldiers to survive under these impossible conditions — without food or support — and maintain their fighting prowess. Sajer writes:\n\nFaced with the Russian hurricane, we ran whenever we could. … We no longer fought for Hitler, or for National Socialism, or for the Third Reich — or even for our fiancées or mothers or families trapped in bomb-ravaged towns. We fought from simple fear, which was our motivating power. The idea of death, even when we accepted it, made us howl with powerless rage.\n\nOn their way to the new front, they met with a completely disorganized group of German soldiers in flight. When Wollers attempted to reorganize them, he was greeted with derision as if the last marks of order within the Wehrmacht had broken down. If there is one passage that marks the end of the war, and there are probably many, it was this sorry scene. These retreating troops were more like starved and crazed refugees than a professional army. They insist that they are the men that were to be relieved and all that waits for Wollers and his relief force at the front is death. The entire sweep of the German soldier’s distress is put into stark relief here — the extreme cold, hunger, fatigue, and filth of the battlefield that existed alongside the disorder and lack of supplies. Their lives had become unbearable. He recalled that in late 1944 that “food was our most difficult problem. For a long time now we had received no supplies. … We became hunters and trappers and nest robbers.” As to the starving troops they encountered in flight, he noted that extreme hunger produced “a curious frame of mind. It is impossible to imagine dying of hunger. Our stomachs digested substances which would kill a comfortable bourgeoisie … in a few weeks.” He said that the situation got so bad that “men… no longer distinguished between enemies and friends … [and] were ready to commit murder for less than a quarter of a meal. … These martyrs to hunger massacred two villages to carry off their supplies of food.”\n\nThe group collectively retreated towards East Prussia, which was considered as much Germany then as Berlin or Munich are today. They were reorganized yet again for the defense, but this time of German soil. Lensen, who was the most strident patriot of the group, was East Prussian and excoriated his fellows for their defeatism in light of the pending invasion of Germany by the Soviets. Lensen was by far the most complicated of Sajer’s comrades in the Wehrmacht. Despite Sajer’s loyalty to France and his limited knowledge of the German language, many of his closest comrades still accepted him as a fellow German soldier, but there were a few instances in which Sajer faced abuse for his mixed ancestry. Much earlier in the book, in one of the more significant encounters between Lensen and Sajer, while they were drinking during a lull in the fighting, Lensen began criticizing France after Sajer had sung a French song, and Lensen’s drunken harangue made Sajer question himself and his toughness. He wrote then that “[he] found the war almost totally paralyzing — probably because of my soft French blood.” Sajer concluded that his poor soldiery was the result of his ethnicity and upbringing. However, despite the occasional abuse attributed to his French origins, Sajer felt particular pride at being a soldier in the Wehrmacht, especially after his service in the Großdeutschland in which he promised to “serve Germany and the Fuhrer until victory or death” and expressed his eagerness to “convert the Bolsheviks, like so many Christian knights by the walls of Jerusalem”. Notwithstanding his sometimes-strained relationship with Lensen, he still considered him his friend. Sajer described Lensen’s horrific death under the tracks of a Soviet T-34, which he found fitting, at least in terms of where it took place, ergo, he died in defense of his ancestral home. In Sajer’s accounting, there was no bitterness towards the proud Prussian. It was also during this fighting in East Prussia that Sajer introduced the civilian problem in terms of their pell-mell flight from the Soviets, which complicated the military preparedness to meet them.\n\nSajer and his compatriots continued to fight a rearguard action and were pushed back in horrific fighting to Memel (now Klaipėda) where they were organized as a defensive barrier to allow the terrified civilian population to escape by ship through Memel’s port on the Baltic Sea. Memel, while not the last battle in which Sajer fought, was the most defining for him. The scene he paints is one of terror. The civilians and the soldiers alike knew what the Soviets would do to them if they were captured — tales of the indiscriminate torture, murders, and rapes (such as the Nemmersdorf massacre by Red Army soldiers in October 1944) were already circulating throughout the civilian populace seeking to flee the Soviet menace.\n\nIf they only knew how bad it would be. Some two million Germans lived in East Prussia and had been there for more than six hundred years since the age of the Teutonic Knights — in cities such as Danzig, Königsberg, and Memel — and the entirety of their history, homes, and heritage would be wiped out after the Second World War. Most of the German inhabitants, which then consisted primarily of women, children, and old men, managed to escape the Red Army as part of the largest exodus of people in human history: a population that had stood at 2.2 million in 1940 was reduced to 193,000 at the end of May 1945\n\nAfter holding the Russians back in vicious and heroic fighting — long enough for almost all the civilians to escape — Sajer, Hals, and a few others made for the docks. It was then under constant aerial bombardment and the Soviets had breached parts of the city. Sajer and the others embarked in a makeshift raft into the icy Baltic, where they were picked up by a passing ship. They made their way to yet another East Prussian town just north of Danzig. There the soldiers experienced a few days of relative recovery but another siege, like that of Memel, was imminent and the evacuation of civilians continued as it had in Memel. Here, Sajer and his group meet the last officer that will demand military rigor of them — and instead of frustration at his insistence, the group was heartened by a relative return to military decorum and order. The evacuation here, however, happened by foot over the frozen Baltic Sea and intermittent isthmus. Civilians and troops marched about twenty-five miles to Danzig over the frozen sea while Soviet bombers dropped bombs to break up the ice to drown them. Once in Danzig, they expected another round of defense and a fight to the death protecting the evacuation, but they received orders to depart to the west. Still fighting until the very end in Danzig, Sajer, Hals and those remaining alive in the Großdeutschland depart for occupied Denmark.\n\nWhen they landed during the spring of 1945, they are shocked to learn, after making their harrowing seaborne escape, that the Americans and British — and the French — are moving through Germany in a western assault. While the reasoning behind Sajer’s enlistment into the German army was not made explicit, it was cemented and justified by his belief that France would eventually join the Germans in their fight against the Soviets. He believed that Germany was protecting Western Europe by attacking the Soviet Union. At the beginning of Sajer’s long march back to Germany from southern Russia, he continually believed that the French “were already on their way. … The first legionnaires had already set out” to assist them from the mounting Russian onslaught. Sajer thought that Germany and France had established a collaborative government such that the French would be used in the fight against the Soviets. And while thousands of French enlisted to help the Germans, Vichy France remained aloof. He felt as if he had been “betrayed” by France, but the thought of possibly having to kill his fellow countrymen seemed unimaginable to him.\n\nOnce in the West, yet another reorganized group of soldiers was formed to resist the Allies, but they were soon captured without any resistance. Each soldier was interrogated, and Sajer’s particular case caused consternation because he was initially deemed a traitor to France but then he was simply allowed to walk away as a liberated French citizen. How or why the Allies changed their minds is never explained. He left the prison yard in a jumble of emotion — so much the more that he did not get to say goodbye to Hals or his other compatriots. His journey home was surreal. His family, after many months of no contact, could not believe that their son had arrived home. As if they understood, Sajer did not speak of the war, nor did his family ask him of it. He joined the French army to rehabilitate his legal standing but was discharged after ten months due to illness. The book ends poignantly enough — in attending a “victory” parade in Paris as a now-French soldier — Sajer recounts silently to himself the memorial of all of the German dead that he had known. To these, he adds one more name — that of Guy Sajer — who too must die as if he lost his life on the Russian Steppe. With no apology or equivocation, he concludes his story.\n\nReception\n\nIt is a mistake to use intense words without carefully weighing and measuring them, or they will have already been used when one needs them later. It’s a mistake, for instance, to use the word ‘frightful’ to describe a few broken-up companions mixed into the ground: but it’s a mistake which might be forgiven. I should perhaps end my account here, because my powers are inadequate for what I have to tell.\n\nThe Forgotten Soldier is universally considered one of the best accounts available of the German experience on the eastern front. Sajer’s description of the conflict captures its brutality and its harshness — all in a visceral and authentic voice. He is fearless in what he recounts — documenting the summary execution of partisans and Russian POWs as well as the fear and disorder on the German side. He captures the war in the east in an almost completely unvarnished way — with virtually no effort to sanitize the conflict. Its believability and realism are augmented by his mode of relating the conflict. He hides nothing from his reader — including his refusal to apologize for his involvement. It must be that any soldier’s story, such as this one, endears the reader to the side that the soldier fought on — maybe that is why, more than anything else, this book is hated by some. What is more, Sajer, or at least it seems to me, did not write a book with an agenda beyond telling the story of the men with whom he fought, suffered, and died. His agenda is the story — so that it can be known, and their valor and sacrifice are accorded the recognition that is almost always deprived of the losers in war. In that way, The Forgotten Soldier is a living memorial etched in words to a forgotten generation of men who gave everything for their country — and then some.\n\nWhile it has similarities to All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque in that All Quiet captured the brutality and horror of mechanized modern warfare from the perspective of a young German soldier on the losing side, Remarque wrote his book soon after the war and appeared to have an anti-war agenda in writing it. Sajer’s book is worse — more horrible and more gut-wrenching — and yet even though Sajer is appalled by what happened to him and his fellow soldiers, there is no anti-war agenda per se. All of it is still too raw for him as if he was still shellshocked twenty years after to think in those terms. And if his account was even half-true, his shellshock was well deserved. He seems to want nothing more than for us to listen to him relating what happened. His book humanizes the man and simply does not permit us to “otherize” the German soldier as something less than human. For all of the conjecture that the German soldier was more machine than man, Sajer is proof positive that this idea is nonsense. They lived and died like anyone else; they dreamed of seeing their parents and their sweetheart like anyone else; they bled and cried like anyone else; they were hungry and cold like everyone else; they prayed for victory like everyone else; and they were bewildered and crestfallen in defeat like anyone else.\n\nThe Forgotten Soldier is also compelling because it is a coming-of-age story in a context that few can imagine. He developed from a naive youth to a hardened combat veteran through his experience in uniform over the war. During his first few weeks, Sajer’s “knees trembled, and [he] dissolved in tears. [He] could no longer grasp anything that was happening to [him].” By the end of the war, he was a rugged veteran who fought for survival like a wild beast. He survived, in part by luck, but also because, “[w]e fought for reasons which are perhaps shameful, but are, in the end, stronger than any doctrine. We fought for ourselves.” I have always wondered what the German retreat from the highwater mark of the German occupation of Russia must have been like. Through Sajer, I feel like I have a very good idea and it is more terrible than anything I ever imagined.\n\nThere are so many other themes and motifs that I could touch upon that are related to what is essentially a survival tale of epic proportions. The will to live, which far deeper than we can imagine; the loss of innocence of a sixteen-year-old boy in a way that is different from moral failings but just as tragic; the destructive futility and inhumanity of modern warfare; the sheer terror of fear; the despair of facing imminent death and surviving only by blind chance; the vacillation between cowardice and heroism; the cold, the hunger, and the exhaustion of the Russian front and the limits of the human body; Russia herself — her endless steppe that stretches beyond the horizon in a treeless mirage of desolation and expanse; and the meaning of the German defeat for the world that we all now take for granted. All of these themes are present in this book — all of the themes could be unpacked over a lifetime.\n\n* * * *\n\nOnly happy people have nightmares, from overeating. For those who live a nightmare reality, sleep is a black hole, lost in time, like death.\n\nNotwithstanding my praise for this book — mine and many others — there are still more who hate it. For my part, the disrepute that some have lobbed at The Forgotten Soldier has more to do with ideologies today than it does Germany during WWII. The first is obvious — it is unapologetic of the Wehrmacht, and, to a lesser extent, it is conspicuously silent on Hitler and the Third Reich. Sajer treats the German army and the Third Reich no different than any other losing army and nation in history. There is no odium attached to any of it — other than the senseless carnage that is war. More than that, there is a sense of pride in Germany — a genuine affinity on the part of the author for Germany, its people, and the honor of its fighting men during World War II. Sajer epitomizes a pan-European consciousness even if he never articulates it as such. He grasped that, even as a French citizen, he was part of a broader European civilization. His actions on the field of battle were the greatest proof of that hidden conviction. While it is far from propaganda, the book feels like propaganda for a generation that has been taught to demonize Germany.\n\nIn other words, his non-demonization feels like exultant praise. Throughout, even if there is not an explicit defense of the German cause per se, there is a defense of the German soldier almost without equivocation. It is as if he wanted to avenge himself upon every sleight and calumny ever lodged at the rank-and-file soldiers of the Wehrmacht. He writes: “throughout the war, one of the biggest mistakes was to treat German soldiers even worse than prisoners, instead of allowing us to rape and steal — crimes which we were condemned for in the end anyway.” The implication here is obviously that the German soldiers did not rape, steal, and murder with impunity — at least in any systematic way similar to what the Red Army did across eastern and central Europe. Considering that a wide swath of the public believes — and is taught to believe — that German soldiers were active extensions of genocide and slaughter, this defense of Wehrmacht must be like nails on a chalkboard for certain types of modern intellectuals.\n\nThe second is also obvious — the Jews are virtually never mentioned. Twenty years after the war, the author must have known about the atrocities committed against the Jews but there is no mention at all of the Holocaust. Nor is there any mention of the racism of the Nazis. The closest Sajer comes to acknowledging the Jews at all is rather oblique: he mentions sightseeing in Poland during his initial training and writes, “[o]ur detachment goes sightseeing in the city, including the famous ghetto — or rather, what’s left of it. We return to the station in small groups. We are all smiling. The Poles smile back, especially the girls.” It could be — and I think this is the most probable explanation — that Sajer’s experience did not overlap with the Jews in any meaningful way, and he never witnessed any atrocities against them. But if one wants the story to be one unrelenting narrative about the Jews, the omission of them is especially galling because, after all, most now think that World War II was about the Jews. Parenthetically, we tend to think of the U.S. Civil War similarly since it is reduced, almost wholly, to that of slavery. As such, just with the Civil War, we lose sight of the other facts that motivated the Second World War, and we turn people and causes into gross caricatures. The invisibility of the Jews is unforgivable to modern ears, as is the implication that Sajer never witnessed any abuse directed at them by German soldiers. The current gloss, of course, is that the Soviet war was one, long premeditated German pogrom masquerading as an invasion. That Sajer never sees or reports this type of activity is so disconcerting to some that it is to call into question the entire authenticity of his account.\n\nThere have been written seemingly hundreds of books about the Holocaust and the suffering of the Jews during World War II; it has become the central defining aspect of modern Judaism. Without debating it, I am reminded of Professor Norman Finkelstein’s controversial work, The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering. Finkelstein, a Jew and child of concentration camp prisoners noted that the Holocaust has become the predominant theme in American cultural life — one in which the Holocaust now is treated alone in its utter uniqueness as a mystical measure of human suffering and that the Holocaust casts the Jews as always and everywhere as victims of historical antisemitism that reached its climax during World War II. It doesn’t matter that other groups of human beings have suffered similarly throughout history — the Holocaust is a singularity. To write a book that recounts three years in Russia where the Holocaust was, as we have been taught, raging and never mention the Jews is inexplicable to most modern readers.\n\nI do not begrudge anyone writing to document their particular story — or the story of their people. With that same latitude, it seems to me a book that captures the suffering of the German soldier and the German civilian during World War II is something long overdue. Not every book that is written on the fall of the Ottoman Empire during World War I must mention the Armenian genocide; similarly, not every book on World War II must preoccupy itself with the Jews. Sometimes it is OK if another people’s grief and sorrow take center stage even if those people were fallen human beings, like everyone else.\n\nThe third is related — his description of the Soviets generally and partisans in particular. If one remembers that most of academia was — and remains — sympathetic to communism, the Soviet Union can never be vilified in the same way that the Third Reich is vilified. True enough, they may concede that it was an experiment that failed on the margins but never in its “laudable” aims, which remain quintessentially moral. Sajer’s description then of Soviet brutality has a mark of inexcusable temerity that is most unwelcome for academics who despise Germany and Nazism. Indeed, Sajer takes it for granted that the Soviet Union was an evil country, which is something, ironically enough, he never does regarding the Third Reich. Sajer, to his credit, does not shrink from describing the cruelty meted out to certain Soviet POWs or captured partisans. Sajer does not claim, however, that such treatment was ordinary or practiced widely. But he describes certain treatments that were understood: for example, Soviet prisoners who stole from the bodies of dead German soldiers were summarily executed. He recounts one such gruesome abuse as follows: “the hands of three [Soviet] prisoners [were tied] to the bars of a gate. … [The German soldier] stuck a grenade into the pocket of one of their coats. … The three Russians, whose guts were blown out, screamed for mercy until the last moment”. This type of despicable activity should make anyone sick and here Sajer shared the sentiment; he wrote that incidents such as these “revolted us so much that violent arguments broke out between us and these criminals every time.” The element within the Wehrmacht that was cruel and “criminal” towards Soviet POWs often claimed that they were giving to the Soviets what the Soviets were giving to German POWs. Sajer rejected those claims categorically, “Russian excesses did not in any way excuse us for the excesses by our own sid"
