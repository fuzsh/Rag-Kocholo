        "text": "By Mark R. Levin\n\nThis Democrat Party is a horrid party.\n\nIt is a party of hate. It is a party of racism. It's a party of anti-semitism. It's a party of un-Americanism, which perhaps explains why the media are attached at the hip to the Democrat Party.\n\nThere is a revolution taking place. Over the years I've called it a counter-revolution to the American revolution. It's been going on for a hundred years and you're seeing its progeny right now.\n\nThe Democrat Party has always been a hateful party.\n\nSlavery, segregation, Jim Crow, and now today.\n\nIf you're an anti-semite, you can find a home in the Democrat Party.\n\nThe Democrat Party is the modern home to anti-semitism. As I said, this party has become a poison.\n\nIt's the party of the New Left and the old Reds.\n\nIt's the party of socialists and Marxists and other radicals.\n\nIt's the party of open borders.\n\nIt's the part of criminals against cops.\n\nIt's the party that seeks the evisceration of the United States military, accusing us of imperalism and colonialism.\n\nIt's a hateful, vile, political party. It's too bad the Republican Party is so weak and impotent.\n\nAnd this party seeks to, as Obama famously put it, \"fundamentally transform\" this society. This is the great difference between what took place during the American Revolution versus this counter-revolution.\n\nIn the American Revolution, there was no effort to fundamentally transform society, the civil society, the individual, and private property rights. They opposed a monarchy to achieve liberty.\n\nThe counter-revolution seeks an iron-fisted government that imposes its will on a people that seek to be free.\n\nBut it's much more clever than monarchies of past. It's got its own nomenclature and is filled with propagandists.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a nasty, stupid bigot. Yet the media put her on their shoulders; they promote her and celebrate her. They give her as much attention as possible. They have created her, yet she's a nobody, she's a back-bencher from a heavily Democratic district, where she won the primary by a relatively few votes in a heavily Hispanic district.\n\nShe beat an old Pelosi ally, a white male, who did not choose to campaign very much. And they treat this as some great event. It's not a great event. And she's not alone.\n\nYou have Omar, another anti-semite bigot.\n\nYou have Tlaib, another anti-semite bigot.\n\nThey all hate America, hate capitalism, they hate our history, and they hate our founding.\n\nThis is the modern Democrat Party, not a whole lot different than the old Democrat Party, quite frankly.\n\nAlong the way, destroying our culture, destroying our traditions, destroying our customs, with all kinds of freakish, radical ideas like infanticide, open borders, bathrooms for any gender, and so on.\n\nNow you and I are supposed to sit here and make some fine distinction between concentration camps and death camps in order to defend Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a buffoon who makes outrageous statements and is defended by low-lifes like Chris Hayes at MSNBC, among others.\n\nComparing the United States to the Third Reich.\n\nComparing the President to Hitler.\n\nComparing our humane treatment of hundreds of thousands who are pouring over our borders with nowhere to put them, overwhelming our health services and law enforcement.\n\nThese are people rushing into our country.\n\nWere there a lot of people rushing into the Third Reich?\n\nI seem to recall that they were forcibly brought into the Third Reich for the purpose of extinction.\n\nI am so sick and tired of what passes for legitimate public discussion in this country. If we had a real, serious media it would be Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who would be condemned, day after day. Not Donald Trump.\n\nNow here's what she said on Instagram Live last night (and notice how the critics always go after Trump's tweeting -- \"why does he tweet so much?\" -- but when's the last time they told AOC to get the hell off of Instagram? Never! They'll defend whatever comes out of her big mouth and mashed-potato brain).\n\nThe United States is running concentration camps on our southern border...\n\nWe are not running \"concentration camps\" on our southern border. Anywhere. This kind of garbage used to be rejected as the insane ramblings of the kooks in our society. We are not running \"concentration camps\" on any border in any part of the United States, you damn fool.\n\nThe United States is running concentration camps on our southern border...\n\nYou really have to be beyond moronic, with an incredible hatred for this country, to make these kinds of statements. People are pouring into this country from Africa, from Asia, from south of the border, because they want to be in concentration camps.\n\nThis woman should be expelled from the House of Representatives as should so many of the others. She's a member of the House who votes on laws, on budgets, and she's a blithering idiot.\n\nI don't blame her for not coming on any of my shows, because blithering idiots don't do well on my shows.\n\n...and if that doesn't bother you -- I don't -- I don't -- I'm like -- believe whatever, I want to talk to the people who are concerned enough that we should say we are not -- never again.\n\nThose two words -- \"never again\" -- are words apoken about the Holocaust.\n\nNever again, about the extermination of Jews in Europe. Never again. And she uses that phrase and applies it to our own country. Where we are feeding people coming into this country illegally, we're changing babies' diapers, we're giving them medical treatment, we're giving them an education and we are overwhelmed on our borders, a situation created by the likes of Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi and the Democrat Party that apparently thinks this is swell.\n\nThese are the same Democrats and media that critiqued Trump for calling certain countries s***-holes --- \"no they're not, that's racist!\".\n\nBut these people are escaping these s***-holes, these countries.\n\nWhy do you think people are trying to come into this country?\n\nThey're not escaping paradise or Nirvana.\n\nThat's how they view us. Yet look at this. I just wish that we could swap Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez for one of these poor people who would like to come into this country.\n\nThese Democrats have nothing but hate for this country. And let me tell you something: when they hate our country, they're talking about you.\n\nYou are the country. They're talking about we the people. And \"concentration camps\".\n\nThe facts that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in America.\n\n\"[C]oncentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in America\"? Did you know this?\n\nWhat's happening to our country, right in front of our eyes?\n\nThere are men and women who have fought for this country, and died for this country, all the men and women in uniform right now in one s***hole country after another, defending the United States. All the men and women in the Border Patrol and ICE and others who are trying to secure this country. Putting their lives on the line every single day to protect us in the interior of our country.\n\nThis clown was a bartender and manages to get elected to the House of Representatives in an 80 percent Democrat district who's done nothing to contribute to this society, not a damn thing. She hasn't created wealth, she hasn't protected anyone, she's done absolutely nothing.\n\nAnd for her to sit in front of her damn Instagram and spew out and burp up her idiocy -- to treat America this way -- is contemptible. Contemptible.\n\nThis is... disturbing. And we need to do something about it. This week children were moved to the same internment camps that Japanese-Americans were held.\n\nThere are no \"internment camps\" now. But that would be the old New Deal, not the Green New Deal. That would be the Democrat hero Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nI just hope the American people are listening to this. I really do.\n\nRead more at MarkLevinShow.com."
