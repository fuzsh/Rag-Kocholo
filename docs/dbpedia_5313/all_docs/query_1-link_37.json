        "text": "The Acts of Paul and Thecla, a second-century Christian document, relates the story of how St.Thecla became a Christian and even an apostle. As a young woman from the elite class, she is engaged to be married to a wealthy upper-class gentleman. But then Paul comes to town and preaches his gospel of sexual renunciation.\n\nAccording to Paul in this early Christian document, people can be saved only by the complete renunciation of sexual activity. The resurrection is promised only to those who avoid sex entirely.\n\nThecla is captivated by Paul’s message of salvation by asceticism—along with many other women, both old and young, and even many young men. In fact, she seems totally enamored at least with his preaching if not with himself. She announces to her mother, who is distraught with the news, that she will not get married but will instead give her life to Paul’s gospel, which demands complete virginity. Thecla baptizes herself, cuts her hair short, dresses like a man, and goes off to become an androgynous, ascetic apostle of the gospel of renunciation and salvation.\n\nI always face a challenge teaching this text to my students. They cannot understand why all the young people in the story are so captivated with the idea of avoiding sex. Why, given the choice, would anyone repudiate sex completely and freely choose instead a life of no sexual contact? How could that “gospel” convert so many? They are puzzled when they come to realize that not only was the call to asceticism compelling for the characters in the story, but that sexual renunciation was a powerful attraction of Christianity for many people—even, or maybe especially, young people—in the ancient world. What kind of “good news” is that?\n\nThough many people nowadays—even Christians—don’t know this, most early Christianity was strongly ascetic: the majority of Christians for the first many centuries of Christianity, apparently, assumed that God required the severe control, preferably the complete renunciation, of sexual relations. Along with advocating other forms of asceticism, such as fasting and prayer, early Christian leaders taught that sexual relations should be avoided if possible and indulged in only for the purposes of procreation if indulged at all. The existence of asceticism may not come as a total surprise to students. After all, they usually have heard about ancient and medieval monasticism. What they find puzzling is the fact that sexual asceticism seems to have been quite popular, at least the idea of it, among ancient Christians.\n\nIn order to explain the ancient allure of asceticism, I often start by talking about two modern phenomena: the “pill” and the women’s liberation movement. Of course, complex historical changes can never be boiled down to simple causes, but one could make an argument that two things that have contributed significantly to changes in how we think about sex in the past forty years or so have been the development and increased availability of reliable birth control and the feminist movement, both of which began impacting broader society with great force in the 1970s. My undergraduates were all born in the mid- to late 1980s. They take such things for granted."
