Broadly speaking, historiography examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods, drawing upon such elements such as authorship, sourcing, interpretation, style, bias, and audience. The word historiography can also refer to a body of historical work. As the tools of historical investigation have changed over time and space, the term itself bears multiple meanings and is not readily associated with a single all-encompassing definition.\n\nHistoriography is often broken down topically, such as \"Historiography of Islam\" or \"Historiography of China\". There are many approaches or genres of history, such as oral history and social history. Beginning in the 19th century with the rise of academic historians a corpus of literature related to historiography has come into existence, with classic works such as E. H. Carr's, What is History? (1961) and Hayden White's Metahistory (1974).\n\nContents\n\n1 Defining historiography\n\n2 Questions studied\n\n3 The history of written history\n\n3.1 Hellenic world\n\n3.2 Roman world\n\n3.3 Early Christian\n\n3.4 Medieval Europe\n\n3.5 China\n\n3.6 Islamic world\n\n3.7 Modern era\n\n3.7.1 Foundation of important historical journals\n\n4 Approaches to history\n\n5 References\n\n6 Bibliography\n\n6.1 Theory and philosophy\n\n6.2 Histories of historical writing\n\n6.3 Feminist historiography\n\n6.4 Thematic and regional\n\n6.5 Journals\n\n7 See also\n\n8 External links\n\n[edit]Defining historiography\n\nThere are two basic issues involved in historiography (Breisach, 1994). First, the study of the development of history as an academic discipline over time, as well as its development in different cultures and epochs. Second, the study of the academic tools, methods and approaches that have been and are being used, including the historical method.\n\nThe term \"historiography\" can also be used to refer to a specific body of historical writing that was written during a specific time concerning a specific issue. For instance, a statement about \"medieval historiography\" would refer to some issue in the academic discipline of Medieval History, and not to the actual history of the Middle Ages or to historical works written in that time (e.g., \"during the last century, medieval historiography changed its focus from the study of political events to social and mental structures\", or \"medieval historiography has largely benefited from the recognition of the importance of parish records\": that is, the discipline underwent some change).\n\nConal Furay and Michael J. Salevouris define historiography as \"the study of the way history has been and is written — the history of historical writing... When you study 'historiography' you do not study the events of the past directly, but the changing interpretations of those events in the works of individual historians.\"[1] One should be cautious, however, that in the sense given in the previous paragraph when a historian does historiography they are actually studying \"the events of the past directly\".\n\n[edit]Questions studied\n\nSome of the common questions of historiography are:\n\nReliability of the sources used, in terms of authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text. (See also source criticism).\n\nHistoriographical tradition or framework. Every historian uses one (or more) historiographical traditions, some of which are Marxist, or Annales School, (\"total history\"), political history, etc.\n\nMoral issues, guilt assignment, and praise assignment\n\nRevisionism versus orthodox interpretations\n\nHistorical Metanarratives\n\nIssues engaged by critical historiography includes topics such as:\n\nWhat constitutes a historical \"event\"?\n\nIn what modes does a historian write and produce statements of \"truth\" and \"fact\"?\n\nHow does the medium (novel, textbook, film, theatre, comic) through which historical information is conveyed influence its meaning?\n\nWhat inherent epistemological problems does archive-based history possess?\n\nHow do historians establish their own objectivity or come to terms with their own subjectivity?\n\nWhat is the relationship between historical theory and historical practice?\n\nWhat is the \"goal\" of history?\n\nWhat does history teach us?\n\n[edit]The history of written history\n\nUnderstanding the past appears to be a universal human need and the telling of history has emerged independently in civilisations around the world. What constitutes history is a philosophical question. For the purposes of this survey it is written history recorded in a narrative format for the purpose of informing future generations about events. The earliest critical historical thought emerged in Greece, a development which would be an important influence on the writing of history elsewhere in the world.\n\n[edit]Hellenic world\n\nReproduction of part of a Tenth-century copy of Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War\n\nWritten history appeared first with the ancient Greeks, whose historians greatly contributed to the development of historical methodology. The very first historical works were The Histories composed by Herodotus of Halicarnassus (484 BC–ca.425 BC), who became later known as the 'father of history' (Cicero). Herodotus attempted to distinguish between more and less reliable accounts, and personally conducted research by travelling extensively, giving written accounts of various Mediterranean cultures. Although Herodotus' overall emphasis lay on the actions and characters of men, he also attributed an important role to divinity in the determination of historical events.\n\nThucydides, on the other hand, largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta, establishing a rationalistic element which became defining of subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, while his successor Xenophon (ca. 431–355 BC) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his Anabasis.\n\nThe proverbial Philippic attacks of the Athenian orator Demosthenes (384-322 BC) on Philip II of Macedon marked the height of ancient political agitation. The now lost history of Alexander's campaigns by the diadoch Ptolemy I (367-283 BC) may represent the first historical work composed by a ruler. Polybius (ca. 203–120 BC) wrote on the rise of Rome to world prominence, trying to harmonize the Greek and Roman point of views.\n\nThe Chaldean priest Berossus (fl. 3rd century) composed a Greek-language History of Babylonia for the Seleucid king Antiochus I, combining Hellenistic methods of historiography and Mesopotamian accounts to form a unique composite. Reports exist of other near-eastern histories, such as that composed by the Phoenician historian Sanchuniathon; but his very existence is considered semi-fabled and writings attributed to him are fragmentary, known only through the later historians Philo of Byblos and Eusebius, who asserted that he wrote before even the Trojan war.\n\n[edit]Roman world\n\nMain article: Roman historiography\n\nThe Romans adopted the Greek tradition, becoming the first European people to write history in a non-Greek language. While early Roman works were still written in Greek, the Latin Origines, composed by the Roman statesman Cato the Elder (234–149 BC) in a conscious effort to counteract the Greek cultural influence, marked the beginning of Latin historical writings. Hailed for its lucid style, Julius Caesar's (100 BC–44 BC) Bellum Gallicum may represent the earliest autobiographical war coverage.[citation needed] The politician and orator Cicero (106–43 BC) introduced rhetorical elements in his political writings.\n\nStrabo (63 BC–ca. AD 24) was a main exponent of the Greco-Roman tradition of combining geography with history, presenting a descriptive history of peoples and places known to his era. Livy (59 BC–AD 17) records the rise of Rome from city-state to world dominion. His inquiry into the question of what would have happened if Alexander the Great had marched against Rome represents the first known instance of alternate history.[2]\n\nBiography, although popular throughout antiquity, was introduced as a branch of history by the works of Plutarch (c. 46 - 127) and Suetonius (c. 69-after 130) who described the deeds and characters of ancient personalities, stressing their human side. Tacitus (c. 56–c. 117) denounces Roman immorality by praising German virtues, elaborating on the topos of the Noble savage.\n\n[edit]Early Christian\n\nThe growth of Christianity and its increased status in the Roman Empire after Constantine I led to the development of a distinct Christian historiography, influenced by both Christian theology and the nature of the Bible, encompassing new areas of study and views of history. The central role of the Bible in Christianity is reflected in the preference Christian historians had for written sources compared to the classical historians' preference for oral sources and in the inclusion of politically unimportant people, development of Religion and society. This can be seen in the extensive inclusion of written sources in Ecclesiastical History written by Eusebius of Caesarea circa 324 and in the subjects it deals with.[3] Christian theology led a view of time as linear, progressing according to God's divine plan. As God's plan encompassed everyone, Christian histories in this period had a universal approach. For example, Christian writers often included summaries of important historical events prior to the start of the period the work was dealing with.[4]\n\n[edit]Medieval Europe\n\nA page of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People\n\nWriting history was popular among Christian monks and clergy in the Middle Ages. They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ, the Church and of their patrons, the dynastic history of the local rulers. In the Early Middle Ages historical writing often took the form of annals or chronicles recording events year by year but this style tended to hamper the analysis of events and causes.[5] An example of this type of writing are Anglo-Saxon Chronicles which were the work of several different writers and start during the reign of Alfred the Great in the late 9th century and one copy of which was still being updated in 1154. Some writers in the period did construct a more narrative form of history including Gregory of Tours and more successfully Bede who wrote both secular and ecclesiastical history and is known for writing Ecclesiastical History of the English People.[3]\n\nHistory was written about states or nations during the Renaissance. The study of history changed during the Enlightenment and Romanticism. Voltaire described the history of certain ages that were important according to him, instead of describing events in a chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called philosophia historiae anymore, but merely history (historia).\n\n[edit]China\n\nMain article: Chinese historiography\n\nIn China, Sima Qian (around 100 BC) was the first to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian), a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the 16th century BC, including many treatises on specific subjects, along with individual biographies for prominent people, as well as exploring the lives and deeds of commoners found in his own time or in previous eras. His work influenced every subsequent author of history in China, including the prestigious Ban family of the Eastern Han Dynasty era.\n\nTraditionalist Chinese historiography describes history in terms of dynastic cycles. In this view, each new dynasty is founded by a morally righteous founder. Over time, the dynasty becomes morally corrupt and dissolute. Eventually, the dynasty becomes so weak as to allow its replacement by a new dynasty.\n\nFirst page of the Shiji\n\n[edit]Islamic world\n\nMain article: Historiography of early Islam\n\nThe first detailed studies on the subject of historiography itself and the first critiques on historical methods appeared in the works of the Arab Muslim historian and historiographer Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406), who wrote historiographical writings in the Muqaddimah (Latinized as Prolegomena) and Kitab al-I'bar (Book of Advice).[6] Among many other things, his Muqaddimah laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history,[7] and he discussed the rise and fall of civilizations.\n\nMuslim historical writings first began developing earlier from the 7th century with the reconstruction of Muhammad's life in the centuries following his death. Due to numerous conflicting narratives regarding Muhammad and his companions from various sources, it was necessary to verify which sources were more reliable. In order to evaluate these sources, various methodologies were developed, such as the \"science of biography\", \"science of hadith\" and \"Isnad\" (chain of transmission). These methodologies were later applied to other historical figures in the Islamic civilization. Egyptology began in Arab Egypt from the 9th century, with the first known attempts at deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs made by Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya. Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (838-923) is known for writing a detailed and comprehensive chronicle of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern history in his History of the Prophets and Kings in 915.\n\nUntil the 10th century, history most often meant political and military history, but this was not so with Persian historian Biruni (973-1048). In his Kitab fi Tahqiq ma l'il-Hind (Researches on India), he did not record political and military history in any detail, but wrote more on India's cultural, scientific, social and religious history. He also discussed more on his idea of history in another work The Chronology of the Ancient Nations.[8] Biruni is considered the father of Indology for his detailed studies on Indian history.[9] Other famous Muslim historians included Urwah (d. 712), Wahb ibn Munabbih (d. 728), Ibn Ishaq (d. 761), al-Waqidi (745-822), Ibn Hisham (d. 834), and Ibn Hajar (1372-1449), among others.\n\nFranz Rosenthal wrote in the History of Muslim Historiography:\n\n\"Muslim historiography has at all times been united by the closest ties with the general development of scholarship in Islam, and the position of historical knowledge in Muslim education has exercised a decisive influence upon the intellectual level of historical writing....The Muslims achieved a definite advance beyond previous historical writing in the sociological understanding of history and the systematisation of historiography. The development of modern historical writing seems to have gained considerably in speed and substance through the utilization of a Muslim Literature which enabled western historians, from the seventeenth century on, to see a large section of the world through foreign eyes. The Muslim historiography helped indirectly and modestly to shape present day historical thinking.\"[10]\n\n[edit]Modern era\n\nModern historiography began with Ranke in the 19th century, who was very critical on the sources used in history. He was opposed to analyses and rationalizations. His adagium was writing history the way it was. He wanted eyewitness accounts and wanted an emphasis on the point of view of the eyewitness. Hegel and Marx introduced the change of society in history. Former historians had focused on cyclical events of the rise and decline of rulers and nations. A new discipline, sociology, emerged in the late nineteenth century that analyzed and compared these perspectives on a larger scale.\n\nThe French Annales School radically changed history during the 20th century. Fernand Braudel wanted history to become more scientific by demanding more mathematical evidence in history, in order to make the history discipline less subjective. Furthermore, he added a social-economic and geographic framework to answer historical questions. Other French historians, like Philippe Ariès and Michel Foucault described history of daily life topics such as death and sexuality. They wanted history to be written about all topics and that all questions should be asked.\n\n[edit]Foundation of important historical journals\n\nThe idea of the historical journal, a forum where academic historians could exchange ideas, came into being in the nineteenth century. The early journals were similar to those used in the physical sciences, and were seen as a means by which history could be professionalised. Journals also helped historians to establish various historiographical approaches, the most notable example of which was Annales. Économies. Sociétés. Civilisations. a publication instrumental in establishing the Annales School.\n\n1840 Historisk tidsskrift (Denmark)\n\n1859 Historische Zeitschrift (Germany)\n\n1866 Archivum historicum, later Historiallinen arkisto (Finland, published in Finnish)\n\n1867 Századok (Hungary)\n\n1871 Historisk tidsskrift (Norway)\n\n1876 Revue Historique (France)\n\n1881 Historisk tidskrift (Sweden)\n\n1886 English Historical Review (UK)\n\n1895 American Historical Review (USA)\n\n1914 Mississippi Valley Historical Review (renamed 1964 the Journal of American History) (USA)\n\n1916 The Journal of Negro History\n\n1916 Historisk Tidskrift för Finland (Finland, published in Swedish)\n\n1918 Hispanic American historical review\n\n1928 Scandia (Sweden)\n\n1929 Annales.

It is commonly recognised by historians that, in themselves, individual historical facts are not particularly meaningful. Such facts will only become useful when assembled with other historical evidence, and the process of assembling this evidence is understood as a particular historiographical approach.\n\nSome of the more common historiographical approaches are:\n\nAnnales School\n\nBig history\n\nCliometrics\n\nComparative history\n\nCritical historiography\n\nCultural history\n\nDeconstruction\n\nDiplomatic history\n\nEconomic history\n\nFamily history\n\nGender history\n\nGreat man history\n\nHistorical materialism\n\nHistory from below\n\nHistory of ideas\n\nMarxist historiography\n\nMetahistory\n\nMicrohistory\n\nMilitary history\n\nNumismatics\n\nOral history\n\nPaleography\n\nPolitical history\n\nPoststructural\n\nProsopography\n\nPsychohistory\n\nQuantitative history\n\nRevisionism\n\nSocial history\n\nUniversal history\n\nWhig history\n\nWomen's history\n\nWorld history\n\n[edit]References\n\n^ (The Methods and Skills of History: A Practical Guide, 1988, p. 223, ISBN 0-88295-982-4)\n\n^ Livy's History of Rome: Book 9\n\n^ a b Historiography, Concordia University Wisconsin , retrieved on 02 November 2007\n\n^ Warren, John (1998).

I think he resents my because he thought he was some kind of sex magician and in reality he was an out of shape bookworm hermit who never matured as a human being. Let's see if he's going to dump any more here.\n\nLast edited by Peterkarig3210 on Mon Sep 01, 2008 5:44 am, edited 1 time in total.\n\nby gumbii\n\njust ignore him...\n\nand i know what you are talking about z... i hear it all the time on loveline...\n\nyes i listen to loveline... lol...\n\nanyways... me being gay is kind of the same way... but i know a bunch of guys that look for HUGE dicks... when guys have anal seckts it's all about the pain... serious... but to me it's all about body contact... the dude i'm dating right now isn't as hung as me, but i think it's perfect... size queens are sick in the head usually... i haven't had anal with this dude yet though... and i come to the understanding that we probably aren't going to do it anytime soon... or not as much as other guys...\n\nplus...\n\nrelationships shouldn't just be based purely on the sex...\n\nby gumbii\n\noh yeah... he sent me something too, but i deleted it before i even read the title...\n\nby Peterkarig3210\n\nDo you know this loser?\n\nby gumbii\n\nnope... maybe it's ocreef in disguise... lol...\n\njust ignore him... he's hurting for attention because dady hates him...\n\nby Peterkarig3210\n\nIt's like he has somthing on both you and me G. It's probably OC or FWP using yet another name. If we were mods we could see where the members adresses are right? I don't know computers very well.\n\nI found a store that has Galaxy Rasboras. They're pretty expensive but really beautifull little fish. I guess they're almost extinct in the wild, and these are farm raised. They're 3 for $20 I think. I want a small school of these guys.\n\nby zambize\n\nLet's not attack the guy, sheesh. I recall all of you defending our own nonsensical rantings within this very thread. It may be true that he doesn't seem to have many friends here, but since when did we become exclusionary based on ridiculous post content? His reported personal attacks aside, come one, come all.\n\nIf anything, he's affirming the social and historical significance of our thread (and forum). His post defines \"historiography\" as not only studying how historical knowledge is obtained and transmitted, but studying the changing interpretations of those events in the works of individual historians. His post acknowledges that although what constitutes history is a philosophical question, for this discussion, his post specifically refers to the importance of written history recorded in a narrative format for the purpose of informing future generations about events.\n\nWe were just validated as not only an important social construct, but also as vital, individual historians.\n\nSeek first to understand....then to be understood.\n\nZ"
