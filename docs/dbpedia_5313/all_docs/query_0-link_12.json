        "text": "The Old Testament is a lost world for many Christians. Except for a few passages like Psalm 23 (‘the Lord is my shepherd …’) and a few choice kids stories like Noah’s Ark and David and Goliath, most of its terrain is unfamiliar and sometimes intimidating. This module takes you down the back-country roads, soaring heights, and hidden canyons of the Old Testament to help you experience its rich beauty and power. But in addition to taking that tour, we’ll identify and seek to overcome the barriers between us and the Old Testament’s word from God to us\n\nIntroducing students to the first century world in which Jesus lived, died, was resurrected, and in which the church began, this module inspires and equips students to engage with scripture afresh. Students will be introduced to a variety of perspectives as they delve into the historical, literary and theological world of the New Testament. They will have the opportunity to explore the revelation of God in Jesus Christ, how New Testament writers understood the Kingdom of God, and what this means for the contemporary church.\n\nThis module covers biblical, theological, and historical foundations for spiritual formation and leadership, equipping students with different perspectives on discipleship and models of formation through the ages. The module covers fundamental doctrines of Christian identity through the idea of humanity made in the image of God, as well as discussion on how those ideas shape us as followers of Christ and leaders in any sphere. Students are encouraged to explore models of spiritual formation and leadership in relation to concepts of the kingdom, community, creation care, and the poor and to apply their learning to their own contexts.\n\nThis module explores questions such as, ‘Where do Christian beliefs come from and how do we decide what is ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ or true or false? What happened in the early church after the Bible was written? What place does the church have in what we believe and why?’ We explore the foundations of the Christian faith in scripture and the early church, and how those foundations have endured through the ages. Students have the opportunity to reflect on how we describe God, who Jesus is, how the Holy Spirit fits in, and other central beliefs. In addition to this, we have the opportunity to discuss how these beliefs shape our churches, our identity, our mission, and our practices.\n\nThis module builds on the Year 1 module, The Drama of Doctrine, taking students deeper in their study of Christian belief and practice. Having begun the study of doctrine in the first year, we are able to examine the central doctrines of the Christian faith in more detail. We will explore questions about how we understand God as Trinity, how we understand what happened on the cross and at the resurrection of Christ, and questions around race, gender, creation care, and the endtimes.\n\nThis module explores Biblical teaching and contemporary practices addressing Jesus as Prophet (but not only as Prophet) and the Prophetic Community. The module explores the nature of the prophetic, both in the Old and New Testaments, and in current Church practice. It explores Jesus’ invitation into His life through Beatitude Community, and explores the created meaning, purpose and identity of humanity. The module will highlight liberation from personal, spiritual and structural oppression and will provide an overview of Biblical notions of liberation from forces that hold people back from their destinies as God’s beloved. The module looks at freedom from slavery, from spiritual blindness due to idolatry, from structural oppression due to economics, class and race. In addition the course addresses topics like peace-making; prophetic discernment; social prophetic engagement; physical and emotional healing; and deliverance from spiritual oppression.\n\nFollowing on from Theological Foundations for Spiritual Formation in year one, this module develops ideas on how our formation as leaders evolves and changes over the lifespan, how we make meaning and form our identity. The module will emphasise the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer and His role in the sanctification process. The module will assess pentecostal and charismatic models of both spiritual and leadership formation, especially those rooted in the story of the poor and the oppressed, and mental health crises. It will introduce and evaluate current and emerging models of leadership with special emphasis on relational, collaborative and adaptive leadership, including both local and global case studies. As a result of the module the students will have a clearer understanding of their journey, firmer theological foundation of love and grace and a broader leadership philosophy that will better equip them for the complexities of life and ministry.\n\nAccording to John’s Gospel, the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. This course explores how this incarnational communication resonated across the first centuries of the faith. As it progresses, we shall encounter the profound sayings of holy men and women in the Egyptian desert, the incendiary sermons of philosophers-turned-pastors amid the bustling cities of the late Roman Empire, and the heartfelt letters of the earliest missionaries, in exile for the sake of the Gospel. And as we listen to each voice––whether in the desert, city, or in mission––we will be reminded of the transforming power of the Word and be challenged to hear what it is saying to us today.\n\nThis module exposes students to John’s Gospel as a distinct eye-witness tradition of the historical Jesus, and the book’s profound role in shaping the early church. Students will explore the “beloved apostle’s” unique perspective on the life of Christ, the glory of the Cross and his experience of the risen Lord. Special focus will be given to major themes and recurring symbols throughout the Gospel, showing how the Jesus of John’s Gospel addressed the immediate needs of early believers and speaks to pressing challenges in the 21st century church.\n\nIn this module, students will reflect on the value of reading the Bible in relation to other texts which help to illuminate our biblical interpretation. In addition to learning about the principles and processes which underpin intertextuality as a form of literary analysis, students will apply this learning to reading biblical texts in relation to other ‘close’ texts from their historical, literary, and canonical contexts, as well as exploring the interpretive value of reading texts alongside more ‘distant’ works, such as later Christian literature or modern political, social, and psychological studies\n\nWe are alive at a time when the dominant narrative assumes that the way to peace is only through war, that retribution trumps reconciliation, and politics is mainly about keeping the markets happy. It is time for a new way of looking at things. This module investigates key thinkers and practitioners of peace and reconciliation who have been challenging these mainstream assumptions. It then explores ways in which the politics of Jesus can be recovered as a resource for a new politics of love. The aim of the module is to catalyse new perspectives and create what Oxford professor of theology Graham Ward calls “political disciples”. It’s exciting stuff!\n\nThis module introduces students to a critical and theological study of carefully selected Old Testament texts (Ruth, 1 Samuel 1-2 and 25, and Esther) that feature female characters. Students will engage in an in-depth textual analysis of each of these case studies with a focus on the literary ingenuity and theological ramifications therein. Particular attention will be paid to prominent female characters—the complexity of their roles, the difficult questions raised as to female agency and depiction, and the possibility of a reading that dignifies all of humanity in God’s image. In addition to a close analysis of each of these texts with an eye to issues of gender, this module will also provide a broader critical engagement with the literary strategies of Old Testament as a whole, including intertextual connections, structural cues, and plot and character development. Alongside coursework and class discussion, students will engage with recent scholarly literature on these key narratives as well as on biblical poetics and feminist interpretation.\n\nWe are, in large part, mysteries to ourselves. We do not know what we are. Even the word “human,” beyond designating a species, needs definition. Christians make this all the more difficult by claiming that one human, Jesus of Nazareth, was the Word and Christ of God. So, Christians have sought clarity on the question: what are we? To address that question, this module introduces students to ‘theological anthropology,’ talk about what it means to be human before God. Working from the present backward, we will follow the centuries-long development of Christian theological anthropology from the modern Charismatic/Pentecostal tradition to the first chapter of the Bible. All the way, we will seek to answer the question, “What does it mean to be truly human?”\n\nThis module will explore biblical, theological, and pastoral dimensions of effective prophetic ministry in church and society. The objective of this course is to develop a Biblical, theological and pastoral understanding of what constitutes effective prophetic ministry in church and society. In particular students will explore social justice and the prophetic, Charismatic perspectives on prophecy, and Apocalyptic-oriented perspectives on the prophetic.\n\nWe’re after Opportunists! People who grab their 20-minute preach by the jugular and wring every last drop of potential out of it for those of us in the pew parched, desperate for words of hope, tenderness, power to inspire and re-fire us. We’ll give you the tools to find your voice, hit your stride, structure your sermon to grasp and hold attention, to encourage encounter with Christ, to enable rumination beyond Sunday, producing a take-away that equips hearers to go-do the Christian life. All this in an intensive, vacuum-packed 3 day practical workshop. Bring soft clothes and a willing spirit.\n\nThis module gives students the opportunity to delve into the fascinating questions of ‘Who is Jesus?’ and ‘What does it mean to be saved?’ We explore how the early church wrestled with how to describe Jesus in ways that would be clear and unambiguous in the culture around them. We study some of the developments through history in thinking about Jesus, as well as the biblical perspective on the incarnation, salvation, and the second coming. Students have the chance to think through what all of this means for modern day discipleship, life, and engagement with the world in mission.\n\nThis module explores the intrinsic connection between theology and the practices of Christian life and worship. Students will build on previous learning gained in Systematic and Historical Theology by exploring key areas such as; prayer, worship, Justice or sacraments, and reflecting on the importance of thinking theologically about Christian life and practice. This will be done in conversation with contemporary Christian discussions as well as theological voices throughout the centuries, including those of John Damascene, Thomas Aquinas and Martin Luther, among others.\n\nHaving spent years writing assignments set by your tutors, now’s your chance to set your own assignment as you prepare to do your dissertation. You will be introduced to the range of research possibilities available, and given help in finding a topic that will excite you. You will start to think like a researcher, and look at how to frame a research question, decide on the appropriate research design and methods, and then how to go about it.\n\nDivision. If there’s any word that describes our current world, sadly, it is one of division. We live in a world divided by race, class, and gender. In many ways, our world reflects the world of the Apostle Paul which is what makes his letter to the Galatians as explosive today as it was in the first century. Paul’s world was marked by the same elements of division and the letter to the Galatians is his project to bring God’s reconciliation to a broken church and broken world. Galatians has been called one of the most revolutionary documents of equality in the ancient world. We’ll examine the major parts of Paul’s discourse in Galatians and see what made this letter so important in the first century and draw out the importance for the church today.\n\nChristian spirituality is not simply a private, contemplative affair; it is a dynamic and creative outworking of Christian belief in culture. Its history is not merely a record of the past, but a powerful testimony of living faith down through the ages. As such, this course is about breathing new life into old bones. We will stand alongside the martyrs Felicitas and Perpetua on the dusty arena floor of ancient Carthage, join Francis of Assisi’s ragtag poor in the hills of medieval Umbria, and hear the heart of William Wilberforce’s insistent calls for liberation in English Parliament. And as we come to learn more about the living faith of our brothers and sisters in Christ, we will seek to learn more about ourselves and the way in which our faith might be lived out in the present.\n\nThis is the culminating stage of your BA journey! This module provides you with an opportunity to build on previous study and embark on a major independent research project of your very own choosing. For many students, the dissertation is the highlight of their academic career. One to one supervision on a topic that excites you provides an opportunity to reach your full academic potential.\n\nContact Dr Freddy Hedley (freddy.hedley@63560f94bc892bf578b70322c0b23f75-14947.sites.k-hosting.co.uk) for any dissertation queries."
