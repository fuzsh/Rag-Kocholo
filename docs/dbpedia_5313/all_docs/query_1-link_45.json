        "text": "August 25, 2024\n\nAlright, I have a confession to make: when I first started reading this highly anticipated thriller from the brilliant author Lucy Foley, known for her mastery of multi-POV narratives, it took me a little time to get into the story. Initially, I shrugged it off, thinking it might be a slow burn. But let's look at the bright side: it doesn't have as many characters as \"Guest List,\" so I figured I could quickly grasp the main story around the mysterious victim's identity by navigating between timelines and narratives.\n\nHowever, a few chapters in, my opinion completely changed, especially with the inclusion of the diary entries. Suddenly, I found myself extremely hooked, turning the pages faster. The last third of the book blew my mind. The words seemed to possess me as the adrenaline pumped through my veins. The several twists took me by surprise, and the puzzle-style climax had me jumping in my seat. And of course, the ending was amazing! Interestingly, it reminded me of the ending of \"True Detective: Night County.\"\n\nThe incorporation of folklore, particularly the legend of the Birds, perfectly blended into the main mystery, where locals fight for justice against the invasion of the polished, filthy-rich Zenith community, with touches reminiscent of Hitchcock's classic film \"The Birds.\" Until I read this, I thought \"Guest List\" was my favorite work by the author, but this book has dethroned it and become my all-time favorite. From its cynical portrayal of the ultra-rich to its sarcastic critique of class differences and the locals' fight for what they deserve, to the mind games surrounding the identities of victims and perpetrators, this book offers a uniquely immersive reading experience.\n\nThe story centers around the Manor: an ultra-luxurious estate nestled in Woodland Hutches, designed to provide a peaceful escape for its privileged guests. Owned by Francesca Woodland, who hides dark secrets beneath a facade of priestess-like purity, the Manor is set to host a memorable summer solstice feast. Her younger husband, aspiring architect Owen, might be enchanted by her dreamy facade and the illusion she's created about her persona, as he shares his own dark secrets about his past that could threaten their shared future.\n\nHowever, Francesca's plans are disrupted by a mystery guest from her past, Bella, who is determined to confront the tragedy she has endured for fifteen years. Meanwhile, nineteen-year-old kitchen helper Eddie finds himself caught between the locals seeking retribution against the Manor's guests and his dedication to his new job, all while dealing with his dysfunctional family.\n\nAs the narrative shifts back to the day after the solstice, we meet DI Walker, a specialist in cold cases, who investigates the tragic events that occurred at the Manor during the solstice celebration. Deaths, terrorized guests, and a burning Manor lead to a myriad of questions: What happened on the solstice? Who perished? Who is responsible? How did the fire start? Readers are tasked with collecting the pieces of the puzzle to solve the mystery, but nothing is as it seems, and Lucy Foyle's cunning storytelling is sure to keep you on your toes.\n\nOverall, this is undoubtedly my favorite book by the author, and it has the potential to be one of the standout thrillers of the year. Highly, absolutely, extremely recommended!\n\nMany thanks to NetGalley and William Morrow for providing me with a digital review copy of this amazing thriller.\n\nFollow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:\n\nmedium blog\n\ninstagram\n\nfacebook\n\ntwitter\n\nMay 25, 2024\n\nIt's official. I've thrown in the towel. DNF @45%\n\nI had so many issues with this book.\n\n⁀➴ I had no idea what was going on or why.\n\n⁀➴ The constant flipping of timelines while not covering any ground plot wise in any of them.\n\n⁀➴ This is a thriller, it should be gripping but I was bored.\n\n⁀➴ And to reiterate - I know that this is an uncorrected arc copy but the amount of grammatical errors took away from my reading enjoyment. I'm talking about extra quotation marks, missing quotation marks, whole wrong ass words - I had to read many sentences over and over to realize wtf she was trying to convey.\n\nThere is nothing but stuck up rich people, great atmospheric vibes, feathers, trees and birds.\n\nBirds. Birds. Birds.\n\nThank you for suffering and bitching with me about this bird box of a book my darling - next time we need a winner, we're 0 for 2 now. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Meagan 🖤💚🕯️📖\n\n🖤Many thanks to NetGalley, William Morrow, and Lucy Foley for the complementary digital copy in exchange for my honest review. 💚\n\nAugust 14, 2024\n\nThe Midnight Feast is easily one of my most anticipated releases of 2024, coming from one of my go-to Mystery/Thriller authors, Lucy Foley. I love her classic style, her sense of place, as well as her dramatic characters.\n\nThe moment I read this synopsis, I needed it.\n\nThis story follows four different perspectives: Francesca, the founder, Owen, the husband, Bella the mystery guest, and Eddie the kitchen help. On first observation, you may think four perspectives it a lot, but honestly, it never felt like it here.\n\nThey're all equally interesting in their own right, and so well developed. Additionally, each play an important role in the events that play out over the course of the story.\n\nWe join these characters on the first night of the grand opening weekend at The Manor, a luxury retreat that Francesca has created, along with the help of her husband, Owen, upon her familial coastal estate.\n\nThe unique property is sold out for the weekend and all guests are expecting the best of the best, to be pampered and low-key treated like royalty. Francesca is pulling out all the stops, no expense has been spared, but will it all come off without a hitch? She's beyond stressed.\n\nIt doesn't take long after you meet all the characters for the ominous tone to set in. There are some mysterious things happening and the property itself seems to be mired in a darkness. It's unsettling; wicked and wild.\n\nThe abutting woods feel like they are looming over the resort, like they may harbor secrets and other disturbing things. The local lore surrounding these woods certainly doesn't help matters. This atmosphere got under my skin fairly quickly and I was eating it up.\n\nFurther, I loved the construction of this story. The chapters are short and you alternate between all of these perspectives. With each chapter you're learning more and more about what is actually going here, the history and connections.\n\nWe also get some journal entries, which take us back to the property, I believe, 15-years prior, and the horrific events that happened there at that time. Through these journal entries we learn a bit more about some of the players in our modern timeline. Enlightening stuff.\n\nI was at the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading this. I found the story to be so gripping. As each chapter ended, it felt like another puzzle piece falling into place.\n\nI was scrambling to get through it. I had to know the truth behind all the connections and what was going to happen on the night of the Midnight Feast. It was a real race to figure everything out. I had so much fun with it.\n\nI'm trying not to give too much away about what happens. It's best to just go in and be surprised. This definitely went places that I wasn't expecting.\n\nI can't stress enough how great this atmosphere felt though. I'm an atmosphere-girlie through-and-through. That's the number one thing I want out of my stories and Foley delivered it in spades here.\n\nIt felt rich, dangerous, hedonistic, and a bit pagan in nature. It almost toes the line into Folk Horror territory, if I'm being honest, and you know I love that.\n\nThis was wildly-engaging and non-stop entertainment. There's no lulls ever in the forward progression of the narrative and mystery of The Manor. The conclusion was exciting and included more than one jaw-dropping moment.\n\nIn my most humble opinion, this is Foley's strongest work yet. Everything about this gets top marks from me. I literally have no complaints.\n\nIt comes with my highest recommendation. If you haven't already, you need to add this to your Summer TBR. If you love atmosphere, clever plot development and non-stop twists and turns, you are sure to enjoy this as much as I did.\n\nThank you so, so much to the publisher, William Morrow, for providing me with a copy to read and review. As mentioned above, this was one of my most anticipated releases of the year and it far exceeded my expectations.\n\nWell done, Lucy Foley. Well done!\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\n2.5/5 🔥🏔️\n\nIt happened again... too many story lines for an underwhelming finish that was not at all satisfying. All the pieces tie into each other in a very obvious way - it just wasn't thrilling for me at all. It felt like every character was designed to be a plot twist but they were all thrown in there to be overtly twisty. A book that does twisty characters really well is 'The Only One Left' by Riley Sager - this just fell so short for me and had all the same mish mash vibes as her previous reads.\n\n₊˚⊹♡ reading log\n\n♡︎.ᐟજ⁀➴ 02/07 7:11pm\n\ni have absolutely 0 predictions on the outcome, it's feeling a little bit like the guest list where there's too many plot lines and i'm lost?\n\n♡︎.ᐟજ⁀➴ 02/07 10:00am\n\nit's good so far and i'm hooked, but it does feel like I've read this before - similar to His & Hers by Alice Feeney\n\n♡︎.ᐟજ⁀➴ 01/07 9:35pm\n\nsee i can tell this is british because i think 25 degrees is a little on the colder side i'm sorry\n\n♡.ᐟજ⁀➴ 01/07 6:46pm\n\nlucy foley loves her morally grey characters everyone is shady\n\n₊˚⊹♡ pre-reading\n\nis the weather extremely gloomy outside? yes, it's perfect reading weather and thus instead of going into the lab today im going to stay home and read (it's an affliction). i've only ever read the guest list - and i loved the isolated setting but it all became too much of grinding mush so i'm hoping this one will be better<3\n\nJune 18, 2024\n\nI really enjoyed the AUDIBLE performance of last year’s “The Paris Apartment” so I was eager to read this year’s offering from Lucy Foley, but unfortunately this one wasn’t quite as satisfying for me.\n\n3 stars ⭐️\n\nJune 2025\n\nIt is the opening night at “The Manor”-the new luxury resort built between the Dorset coastline, and a dense bristle of ancient forest. Hundreds of lanterns have been lit, (see the gorgeous book cover!) and the welcome drinks are flowing at the very edge of the trees.\n\nThis is the culmination of a dream for its founder, Francesca Meadows, a woman who is all about white linen and wellness, and it’s been designed by her architect husband Owen Dacre.\n\nBella has been summoned to “The Manor” but she is not sure who sent her the article about the opening and how much they know about her history with Francesca. She no longer goes by her given name-nor does she resemble the girl she once was.\n\nThe story unfolds through their three POV’s and through two additional POV’s-that of the kitchen help, Eddie, and that of Detective Inspector Walker-after “The Manor” BURNS to the ground the Day After the Solstice. (not a spoiler) 🔥\n\nWho is responsible?\n\nWho doesn’t survive?\n\nCould the fire have been started by the unhappy locals who arrived in the grotto just in time to ruin the opening party?\n\nOr, have the myths and folklore of the local woods come true?\n\nGranfa warned Francesca that she must “KEEP THE BIRDS HAPPY!” 🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛\n\nAnd, yet she didn’t heed the warnings of the black feathers that were found all weekend long…\n\nAnd, she insisted that her treehouse suites be built despite the warnings from the tree surgeons hired-who refused to cut down the Elder trees that stood in the way. 🌳🌳🌳\n\nSuperstition says that you must ask permission from the Elder Mother- the spirit inside the tree-before you even trim a few branches and cutting the whole tree down?\n\nProperly BAD LUCK.\n\nAnd, yet-Owen grabbed the chainsaw and took the trees down himself.\n\nA SUMMER JOURNAL from 2009, fills the reader in on secrets from the PAST, when Francesca (Frankie) and Bella (nicknamed Sparrow) were just young girls in a town called Tome (pronounced Tomb).\n\nMost early reviewers felt the story really took off when the “diary entries” started, but I am the OUTLIER who disliked these chapters as I personally grow bored reading about spoiled rich kids and the poorer kids they bully.\n\nAnd, the characters were not any more likable as adults.\n\nMy favorite part of the book were the AFTER chapters, which brought the story full circle, and offered up some SURPRISING (fun) revelations-loved the epilogue and final scene at the PUB! 🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛🐦‍⬛\n\nNOW AVAILABLE\n\nThank You to William Morrow for the gifted ARC provided by NetGalley. It was my pleasure to offer a candid review!\n\nMay 16, 2024\n\nI am a big fan of Lucy Foley so when I got approved for this ARC I was so excited! And it didn't disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.\n\nThe Manor is an old historical house that was renovated into a hotel by the grand daughter of the original owners, Francesca Meadows. Francesca has turned the Manor into a massive wellness boutique hotel but the locals aren't too happy about its existence. Freaky things start happening around the location, some are reminiscent of an old wives tale the locals call \"the Birds\". \"Beware of the Birds\" many locals have warned, believing in the superstition. But surely \"the Birds\" are not responsible for murder, are they?\n\nThe story follows different POVs so the reader never get bored. It also jumps timelines as a woman from Francesca's past appears at the Manor's opening weekend. She is intent on exposing all of Francesca's dirty and morbid secrets. In addition, there's DI Walker, the detective that is investigating what seems to be arson and murder. But is it the mysterious woman from Francesca's past that's causing these horrible tragedies or is it really the work of a superstitious myth?\n\nI give this book 4 stars. While I absolutely loved how the story unraveled, I do think I prefer her other books. This one was entertaining but forgettable. It won't be one of my top books if this year but it was spooky and fun to read. My favorite thing about this book is I NEVER at any point knew who the culprit was until the end when things started to unravel. A juicy summer thriller for sure.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and William Morrow for this ARC in exchange for my honest review!\n\nJuly 1, 2024\n\n***HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY***\n\nThis was one of my most anticipated reads of 2024, unfortunately this one didn’t work very well for me.\n\nYou know from the blurb that “The Manor” is the brainchild of Francesca Woodland and designed by her architect husband, Owen.\n\nThe novel starts during the opening weekend and Francesca is certain that everything is perfect. There is a beautiful infinity pool, special “healing pouches” for the guests with crystals and a special cocktail to mark the occasion. The “Manor Mule” is already being enjoyed by the guests spread out on the lawn - it seems to be the start of a wonderful weekend. There are cottages by the sea and also those that are set almost at the edge of the forest. It is a picture perfect evening - until it isn’t.\n\nWe flip back and forth between the various characters, past and present timelines, a folklore that appears to be true and the manor burning with the police finding multiple dead bodies. Add to that a journal written by one of the characters when they were young.\n\nPROS:\n\n*The premise sounded interesting\n\n*The setting was beautiful, the combination of beautiful woods alongside a cliff overlooking the sea.\n\n*I found one likable character, Eddie, who is part of the staff. He came across as genuine and believable.\n\n*CONS\n\n* Too many characters, some of whom have changed their names and identities. Between the guests, the Manor staff and the police, there are a puzzling number of characters to keep track of.\n\n*There is also a journal kept by one of the characters which we read in between everything else that is going on!! I’m not a big fan of teenage angst which is a large part of the journal.\n\n*The folklore part of the book was touched upon time and again and yet the reveal was easy to predict\n\n*There have only been 15 years since some of these characters have seen each other and yet they fail to recognize each other. Huh???\n\nThis was a buddy read with Debra, be sure to read her great review!!\n\nI received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss. It was my pleasure to read and review this title.\n\nJune 4, 2024\n\nAlright, let’s dive into this wild ride of a book that completely changed my view on Lucy Foley! In her latest novel, we follow Francesca Meadows, who decides to revamp her old home into a luxurious resort catering to the ultra-wealthy. The story is told from multiple perspectives, and boy, do those perspectives bring on the drama and twists!\n\nFirst up, there’s Bella, who at first seems like just another guest. But through flashbacks and current events, we quickly realize she’s much more than the single lady in a bungalow. Then there’s Owen, Francesca’s partner, whose indifferent attitude towards her keeps you guessing about his true feelings. And sweet Eddy and his family add a whole other layer of mystery—seriously, figuring out where they fit in is like solving a puzzle!\n\nThis book kept me hooked from start to finish. The multiple plotlines spun my head around in the best way possible. My only minor gripe? The characters are pretty complex, and keeping track of everyone was a bit of a challenge at times. But honestly, it was worth the effort.\n\nI’ve had mixed feelings about some of Lucy’s previous books, but this one? It was a hit. I couldn’t wait to keep listening, and when the ending hit, I had to go back a few pages just to make sure I got it right. It was that good!\n\nBig thanks to NetGalley and HarperCollins UK Audio for letting me listen to and review this audiobook ARC. If you’re looking for a gripping, multi-layered mystery/thriller, give this one a go!\n\nMay 27, 2024\n\n4.5🌟\n\nIT'S PARTY TIME!🥳\n\nFrancesca and Owen cordially invite you to the grand opening of an exclusive resort touting a holistic- themed experience. Booked solid, everyone is thrilled to be part of the savvy festivities. Everyone that is except the locals who want no part of this venture.\n\nAnd when the residents and resort owners clash not everyone walks away and lifelong secrets are about to be exposed.\n\nTold from multiple POV, each with a clearly separate voice and fully developed characters that made it easy to follow along. Short chapter format kept the read at a rapid pace with the tension constantly ramping up with every page.\n\nI debated waiting for the audio version, (and I do believe it will lend itself perfectly for a large cast ensemble.) But after recently finishing her previous book The Paris Apartment I was anxious to get my hands on this latest so I went with the digital format.\n\nAnd I’m so glad I didn’t wait!\n\nThis may be my favorite Lucy Foley book to date! 🤩\n\nThank you to NetGalley and William Morrow\n\nJuly 29, 2024\n\n3.5⭐️ (rounded up for the final 25% and because I loved the audio narration!)\n\nJune 2025 – Francesca Meadows is thrilled that her dream project \"The Manor\"-an exclusive wellness resort - is finally open. The Solstice celebration and the midnight revelries are in full swing, her affluent guests are in attendance being catered to by her carefully selected staff, a few of whom are local including Eddie whose family owns and operates a farm close by. Among the guests is Bella, who has a history with Francesca (who is initially unaware of Bella's presence) and whose decision to book a stay was based on an article sent by an unknown sender, who definitely knows their history. The resort was built on the Dorset coastline, the premises Francesca inherited from her grandparents, and her husband, architect Owen Dacre, was tasked with designing the luxurious resort. The resort is adjacent to a forest that holds special significance to the locals, who aren't too happy with the development and the fact that the owners have no respect for the ‘lore and beliefs of the locals only complicates matters further.\n\nUnbeknownst to most guests, the land, the forests, the small town of Tome and Francesca herself harbor dark secrets. So when the fishermen discover the body of a woman floating in the water the very next day and the cliffside retreat goes up in flames, unraveling the mystery behind the murder and the fate of The Manor might be more complicated than the investigating officer, Detective Inspector Walker and his team would have thought.\n\nI haven’t had much luck with the author's previous novels, all of which were average reads for me. I won’t say that The Midnight Feast by Lucy Foley is an exception but overall, I did enjoy the novel ( I think the full-cast audio narration had a large role to play). Well-thought-out characters ( even the unlikeable ones), a vividly described atmospheric setting, an intriguing premise, dual timelines and multiple perspectives, woven into a cohesive narrative made for an engaging read. I loved the intensity of the present-day narrative, the folklore and the dark myth associated with the land, which added to the tension. I always appreciate it when my theories are proved wrong and I’m glad to say that a few of the final twists and revelations were truly shocking.\n\nHowever, the story takes a long time to pick up the pace, which is why it felt longer than it actually was. The past timeline is presented through journal entries from 2009, and though past events were integral to the plot, these slower-paced sections (with a tad too much teenage drama) hindered the flow of the narrative. The final 25% definitely made up for the slow build-up, uneven pacing and what I thought were some unnecessary fillers, in particular one of the character’s perspectives which was not necessarily required to carry the story forward.\n\nI paired my reading with the brilliant full-cast audio narration featuring Joe Eyre, Sarah Slimani, Roly Botha, Laurence Dobiesz and Tuppence Middleton, which enhanced my overall experience.\n\nGiven a choice, I would recommend the audio over reading the book.\n\nConnect with me! ✏ Instagram ✏ My Blog ✏ The StoryGraph\n\nJuly 20, 2024\n\nIt’s the opening night of The Manor, and no expense, small or large, has been spared. The infinity pool sparkles; crystal pouches for guests’ healing have been placed in the Seaside Cottages and Woodland Hutches; the “Manor Mule” cocktail (grapefruit, ginger, vodka, and a dash of CBD oil) is being poured with a heavy hand. Everyone is wearing linen.\n\nBut under the burning midsummer sun, darkness stirs. Old friends and enemies circulate among the guests. Just outside the Manor’s immaculately kept grounds, an ancient forest bristles with secrets. And the Sunday morning of opening weekend, the local police are called. Something’s not right with the guests. There’s been a fire. A body’s been discovered.\n\nYou know those books that you wait and wait to read because you want to be able to keep looking forward to them? Well, that was The Midnight Feast to a T. And let me tell you, it didn’t let me down in the least. From the original format to the atmospheric setting, Foley managed to craft a story that pulled me in deep. But it was the deftly layered plot, immersive storytelling, and dynamite characters that turned this promise of heaven into a guaranteed success.\n\nStarting off from the top, the storyline was darn near perfection. Even-paced and laden with foreboding, the creepy aura created a plot that had me second guessing what was really going on. Was there a paranormal element? Or something I wasn’t seeing? Until the final timely reveal, I just couldn’t say. And the twists! Brilliantly linking together the dual timelines into one stellar premise, each revelation shocked me to my core as all of the puzzle pieces fell into place.\n\nAs for the characters, they were simply divine. Mysterious and piled high with secrets, the multiple POVs and first-person narration meant that they came alive on the page. So much so, in fact, that I could easily see this book playing on a screen near me someday soon. Complex and with thick backstories that illustrated realistic yet highly dramatized personas, each played a central role to this psychological thriller.\n\nAll together, there was nary a thing missing—and not even a hint of anything that came across as too much. With short chapters, an addictive folklore element, and ever ratcheting tension, the fact that there was a mystery times two meant I was over the moon. Sinister but also oddly alluring, from the slow burn start to the perfectly timed climax, it was an utter slam dunk. Just don’t go into this one expecting yet another one of Foley’s typical thrillers. Thanks to a horror-esque feel, this went above and beyond. Rating of 4.5 stars.\n\nThank you to Lucy Foley and William Morrow for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.\n\nPUB DATE: June 18, 2024\n\nTrigger warning: none of substance\n\nRead\n\nMay 25, 2024\n\nI’m already slumpin and I know if I continue this one I’ll be miserable. DNF at 45% I just can’t bring myself to like this one.\n\n🐦‍⬛the timeline is all over the place\n\n🐦‍⬛the characters are insufferable\n\nThanks for Buddy Reading with me Heather 🖤 we need to redeem this flop 😭\n\n✨Thanks to NetGalley, The Author, & William Morrow Publishing for an advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review✨\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\n3 or 3.5* I liked this for the most part but I felt like the middle dragged a lotttt for me. The beginning was haunting and exciting, the ending was overall satisfying, but the middle just kept losing me :(\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nThe Manor hotel has opened on the Dorset coastline. It’s a luxurious wellness hotel owned by Francesca Meadows. It is a place to relax, be pampered, and enjoy the beautiful setting. What guests don't know is that the manor has an ugly past. The guests may be in the dark, but there are those who know, those who have been watching, waiting, and planning. Soon old friends, old secrets, and old enemies will collide at the luxury hotel.\n\nI had such high hopes for this book. I was intrigued by the synopsis: a manor, the woods, the secrets. I just knew I was going to love it. But sadly, this one didn't work for me. I did enjoy the journal entries which gave glimpses into the past and showed the characters as teenagers. There are a lot of characters with various motivations and their connections to the past. Then there are the birds. Francesca is told that she needs to keep them happy. What happens when the birds are not kept happy?\n\nThe book is told through various characters POV's (5 in total). I didn't mind this and we got their thoughts and motivations. Sadly, I only cared about Eddie, all the other characters fell flat for me. He was the only sympathetic character in the book for me.\n\nThen there are the birds and the black feathers being found at the hotel. I wish this would have been explored and utilized more in the book. This element piqued my interest and I found this to be a nice touch and a nod to the local lore.\n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere and the tension in the book. I thought these were nicely done. I also enjoyed watching as characters began to show their true colors.\n\nI really wanted to love this one, but it just didn't work for this reader. I can't fault the writing or the premise. Lucy Foley is a great writer and I look forward to reading more of her books in the future.\n\nOthers enjoyed this book more than I did so please read their reviews as well. We can't love them all and that is the case with this book.\n\n*This was a buddy read with Dorie. Please read her review as well to get her thoughts on the book.\n\nThank you to William Morrow and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own.\n\nRead more of my reviews at www.openbookposts.com 📖\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n“ If you go down in the woods today, you’re sure of a big surprise” …. and the opener is a surprise and a half whichsure grabs my attention. You ready for the feast?\n\nIt’s June 2025, nearly the Solstice and the opening night of Tome Manor, maybe the new jewel of the Dorset coast with no expense spared to attract guests. However, it’s surrounded by ancient woodlands and many locals are far from happy at the intrusion of wealthy guests which little bothers the Manors owner, Francesca Meadows. Take a deep breath though, because there’s no mistaking the fact that there’s something disturbing swirling in the warm air, whispers about local folklore that should raise a concern or two. The warning bells are clanging but how will it all play out? Several guests are uncomfortable and want to move out of their woodland. “hutches” disturbed by the atmosphere. Their instincts are good as the day after the Solstice fisherman notice a fire and go onto discover a body floating in the sea. This is just the start. Who is behind what’s playing out? Why is Francesca rattled by the appearance of Bella, a guest? Perhaps, most importantly of all, why does Francesca have to keep the birds happy???\n\nThe story is told via several points of view and a summer journal which makes it a bit slow to get going but allows us to comprehend those undercurrent and more. Francesca’s point of view is illuminating, who is the real Francesca? This becomes clearer to see and it isn’t pretty. Best watch your back Frankie, oh sorry, Francesca. What’s Bella’s game?? That starts to become more transparent, but it’s also clear to see that there are several characters who are wearing masks and hoping to disguise their pasts. All are well portrayed although not necessarily likeable with the exception of Eddie, the Barman amongst other things.\n\nI really like the premise of the novel which goes way beyond the us versus them, locals versus wealthy incomers it might suggest. There are a little hints, as light as a feather that things are going to get. …..nasty? Talking of feathers, there are some very good inclusions such as Daphne Du Maurier’s/Hitchcocks The Birds which is a nice touch.\n\nThere are some very good descriptions, the vivid scene setting is especially noteworthy and it certainly screams atmosphere. The storytelling is colourful and very visual. The superstition angle which the hotel “interferes” with gives a palpable sense of foreboding, with prickles on the back of the neck. The plot really ramps up and towards the end there are some excellent revelations that you don’t foresee and one really good twist, well played.\n\nOverall, whilst I don’t feel that this is Lucy Foley’s best novel, I still devour her midnight feast with some relish. There are some standout sinister moments and plenty of delicious (or otherwise) wickedness from the past and in the present day.\n\nWith thanks to NetGalley and especially to HarperCollins, Harper Fiction for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.\n\nAugust 24, 2024\n\n**Many thanks to NetGalley, William Morrow, and Lucy Foley for an ARC of this book! Now available as of 6.18!**\n\n\"If you go down to the woods today\n\nYou better go in disguise\n\nIf you go down to the woods today\n\nBeware of a big surprise...\"\n\nImagine an estate so grand, so ominous, and so unique that rather than having a ostentatious name, it holds enough gravitas to simply be called The Manor. This sprawling property overlooks the water, with lakeside cabins and seaside views to boot, and should bring an aura of peace...at least, that's the goal. Lanterns light the night skies, and although the eerie woods are close by, the promise of tranquility hangs in the air. Owner Francesca has been working tirelessly to prepare the Manor for its opening night affair...and the time is FINALLY here. With crystals in each room and white linen outfits for the guests to wear, she and husband Owen have carefully worked to curate a VERY specific 'experience' for their guests. 🏮\n\nBut when Bella arrives at the Manor, she has more on her mind than a simple escape to the Dorset coast. Though she keeps her intentions close to the vest, Bella has an INTIMATE knowledge of this area...and the terrifying folklore that accompanies it. Many years ago, 'the Birds' were first spotted...but nobody knows exactly WHO these costumed menaces are or what they want...at least, nobody who is prepared to share that information with all of the guests at the resort. Francesca \"Frankie\" remembers her many years of Midnight Feasts and mischief in this very area fondly...but does someone ELSE remember them too? Is Eddie the busboy truly just an innocent member of the staff...or will a chance romantic encounter with guest Bella drag him into the middle of a dark mythology that is slowly coming to life? And when a body turns up in the water the day after the solstice...is this confirmation that the Birds have returned to take yet ANOTHER victim for their own?\n\nLucy Foley has settled comfortably in the multi-POV, locked room mystery space for some time now, and in many ways...it's the perfect space for her to occupy. All of her books have this structure that feels familiar and it's normally pretty easy to get into the groove. Usually by the time we have rotated through each POV a couple of times, I feel a sense of familiarity with the tone, the 'direction' of the plot, and have a pretty good sense of who exactly her (usually sort of unlikable) characters are, not to mention feel the eerie chill of her atmospheric writing envelope me, taking me to the gothic mansion/apartment building/estate of the day.\n\nIn this one, however? Foley's ambition and drive to include nods to SO many horror greats, from Hitchcock's the Birds, to Midsommar, to the Blair Witch Project, to the Wicker Man left me dizzier than a kid who just spent two or three hours riding nonstop on a Tilt-O-Whirl...and in a way, almost as nauseated.\n\nFor starters, you're going to have to have some patience from page one: Foley's set up in this one includes timeline jumps, random quotes, mention of the Solstice and of Opening Night before you understand what ANY of these things mean. There's also a couple of lines before the Prologue that I just went back to for reference, having read the entire book....and nope, they weren't needed and certainly don't feel any more important to the plot now than they did on first read. Although our five POVs get established quickly (Francesca, Bella, Eddie, Owen, and DI Walker, plus an unnamed journal writer), I felt like it took me a good 50-60% of the book at LEAST to know them on any sort of deep level. (And sorry DI Walker, I think your character could have participated in far less of this one without much impact...you have the unfortunate honor of being the least memorable voice by far). While an investigation was necessary, Foley could have cut down these sections significantly or moved them all to the second half of the book without missing a beat.\n\nWithout a solid character to 'root for', this book also felt like it was instead just ACHING for the plot to move...but move, it did not. UNTIL about 80% of the way through the story. Yep, that's right. To get to the meat and potatoes of this one...I wasn't kidding when I said you'd need to be patient. I'll be honest, I had just about assumed this book was going to go the way of the Paris Apartment and that all of the meandering, bird talk, back and forth between Francesca and Owen and Eddie and Bella, panicking from the locals, etc. was leading absolutely NOWHERE...until these moments arrived and the pieces started to slide into place. There are a couple of twists toward the end of the book that take this out of humdrum territory and made it feel worthwhile BUT by the same token, I still feel like Foley somehow just missed the boat a bit.\n\nAny book that attempts an homage to some of the greats runs the risk of paling in comparison when held up against the source material...and let's just say I think Hitchcock's birds were far more terrifying than those 'soaring above' the Manor. Though I'm not too familiar with Midsommar or the Wicker Man, both of these properties served as direct inspiration for this story according to Foley...but aside from the outfits and the 'vibe' of the Manor...I'm not sure how. There isn't an ACTUAL cult or anything of the sort going on here, no fully-fledged Paganism, or to be honest, anything other than an almost kitschy attempt at Creepy Serenity by way of crystals and the like used by Francesca to lure her guests into booking a stay. These quibbles aside though, the last 20% of this one WAS compelling and interesting enough to get me to bump up my rating...but only just. Once again, Foley's atmospheric writing is her saving grace: if you can allow yourself to become immersed in the world she presents, any bumpiness of the plot, jerkiness between timelines past and present, and irritating qualities of her characters fade just enough for the horror to TRULY take over...or at least to get under your skin!\n\nAnd although a Midnight Feast sounds FABULOUS in theory...I think there's a reason why most of us settle for a Midnight Snack.\n\n4 stars, rounded up from 3.5\n\nJuly 27, 2024\n\n3 Stars\n\nHonestly, this book fell flat for me and lacked character development I found the characters to be insufferable. I almost DNF a few times but decided to hang in and finish the story. I did not feel a connection with any of the characters and found the story too slow of a burn and a little confusing with the many different POVs.\n\nIt was hard for me to get into, and I had a hard time finishing it. I enjoyed other books by this author, such as The Guest List and The Hunting Party, but this one was not my favourite. I will continue reading books by Lucy Foley.\n\nOthers enjoyed this more than I did, so please read their reviews. We can’t love them all, which is the case with this book.\n\nI want to thank NetGalley and William Morrow Publishing for the e-ARC in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed are mine.\n\nJune 6, 2024\n\n*HAPPY RELEASE DAY!*\n\nThe Midnight Feast was Unsettling, Creepy, and it Sure Kept Me Guessing!\n\nJune 2025 – It’s the opening weekend of The Manor, an exclusive, cliffside, health and wellness resort hotel, nestled away in the tiny village of Tome, Dorset, with the beach on one side and the woods on the other. The retreat promises three days of luxury, spirituality, and pampering, culminating in a Midnight Feast on The Day of the Solstice.\n\nBut just before dawn The Day After the Solstice fishermen make two grisly discoveries, floating in the water is a body, and high up on the cliff The Manor is burning!\n\nJust what went on at The Midnight Feast?\n\nAfter finishing The Midnight Feast I can honestly say that Lucy Foley is the master of misdirection – the plot had more twists than the trees featured in this novel – the mystery was multi-layered, clever, and exciting, and the shocks and secrets just kept on coming. I can’t stop thinking about that last 25%!\n\nThe characters were a mix of one’s I cared about, other’s I wasn’t sure about, and a few that were evil to the core. All were compelling, three-dimensional and intriguing. I even teared up a couple of times and was surprised how emotionally invested I was in some of these character’s situations and trauma. The setting of Tome took on a life of its own – steeped in class conflict and divide, exacting justice, and customs and folklore. Now, I wouldn’t go as far as to say that I’m terrified of birds – although I’m not keen on their squawking, flapping wings, and beady eyes – but the bird legends featured in this novel, coupled with the fact that people kept finding ominous feathers, really freaked me out.\n\nThere were several timelines to keep track of. The present story arc, which took place over the three-day retreat weekend – Opening Night, The Day Before the Solstice, The Day of the Solstice – via four POV’s. Then there were flashbacks to the summer of 2010 in the form of italicised journal entries narrated by a teenage girl, as well as flash forwards to The Day After the Solstice beginning with the discovery of the fire and an unidentified body. There was also a spooky, foreboding prologue titled, The Woods. The summer journal was the standout for me, that is until the last 25% when every moment was my favourite.\n\nNow I can’t decide which Lucy Foley book is my favourite, this one, or The Guest List. I think I love them both equally.\n\nP.S. As a teenage I also devoured Bella by Jilly Cooper, as well as the other books in the series, Harriet, Octavia, etc.\n\nI’d like to thank Netgalley UK, Harper Collins UK, and Lucy Foley for the e-ARC.\n\nTake note of the release date, 6th June 2024, as The Midnight Feast is a must-read thriller.\n\nJune 20, 2024\n\nEXCERPT: I have a darkness within me, a violent darkness that I have kept at bay for so long: an inky bottomless well of it like crude oil buried deep, deep beneath the ground. I close my eyes and inhale the smell of burning wood and feathers from the beach and I smile.\n\nABOUT 'THE MIDNIGHT FEAST': Secrets. Lies. Murder. Let the festivities begin...\n\nMidsummer, the Dorset coast\n\nIn the shadows of an ancient wood, guests gather for the opening weekend of The Manor: a beautiful new countryside retreat.\n\nBut under the burning midsummer sun, darkness stirs. Old friends and enemies circulate among the guests. And the candles have barely been lit for a solstice supper when the body is found.\n\nIt all began with a secret, fifteen years ago. Now the past has crashed the party. And it’ll end in murder at…\n\nTHE MIDNIGHT FEAST.\n\nMY THOUGHTS: I wanted to like The Midnight Feast more than I did. I did love the final 20% which I just raced through but I felt vaguely irritated by the rest of the book.\n\nThe story is told from five points of view: Francesca - the owner of the Manor; Owen - her architect husband; Bella - the guest in Woodlands Hutch #11; Eddie - a local, the dishwasher and aspiring bartender; and Detective Walker - SIO on the case. The storyline unravels over two timelines, 2010 when the characters were teenagers, and the current day.\n\nEddie was definitely my favorite character. He was likeable, honest and unpretentious. He has a dysfunctional family background and is torn between his allegiance to the locals and his own aspirations.\n\nDetective Walker comes a close second. Although, I'm not really sure how Detective Walker got called in on this case. It wasn't a cold case, which is his forte.\n\nI liked the (basic) plot - it had good bones.\n\nI really disliked the bacchanalian excesses - it just killed this read for me. Also, I'm not sure why the characters took so long to recognise one another.\n\nI could not understand why Sparrow kept returning to Frankie's house when it is perfectly clear that Frankie is a manipulative bully, and her brothers are sexual predators. Why would she even think of going back?\n\nThe black feathers were a nice, slightly creepy touch, but much more could have been made of this aspect. I wanted more creepy. Subtle creepy. Spine tingling creepy. There was definitely the scope for it. I liked the nod to Daphne du Maurier's The Birds, which I read again recently.\n\nAlthough I did love the final 20%, especially that final paragraph, overall I was left feeling vaguely disgruntled.\n\nI usually love Lucy Foley's books and I am not quite sure what went wrong here but The Midnight Feast was only just an okay read for me. Will that stop me reading more from this author? - that's a definite NO. I'll be at the front of the line for her next offering.\n\n⭐⭐⭐\n\n#NetGalley\n\nTHE AUTHOR: I came to writing through a love of reading — I previously worked with books as a fiction editor, a literary agent’s assistant, a bookseller and a literary scout!\n\nDISCLOSURE: Thank you to Harper Collins UK, Harper Fiction via NetGalley for providing a digital ARC of The Midnight Feast by Lucy Foley for review. All opinions expressed in this review are entirely my own personal opinions.\n\nhttps://sandysbookaday.wordpress.com/...\n\nJune 25, 2024\n\n3 very, very \"meh\" stars... a real slog-fest. Just way, way too many POVs, with characters that I didn’t particularly care about or like at all - so very tired of \"the rich behaving badly\" trope, and it was just totally unbelievable that some of them didn’t recognize each other 15 years later, like WTAF??? But I did not foresee all of the twists and I did enjoy all the local legends with the birds, plus the creepy woodland Pagan atmosphere and the very gothic Manor, itself. Felt very slow and I did quite a bit of skimming. After the last two, Foley's off my \"auto\" list now.\n\nRead\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\nWill circle back with rating & review after book club discussion.\n\nWant to read\n\nDecember 19, 2023\n\nwhy do I feel like I've read this before...\n\noh wait, it's a Lucy Foley book with the same plot all over again\n\n(I'll probably read it anyway)\n\nJune 25, 2024\n\nAbsolutely hurrendous. Should of DNF’ed. Don’t recommend at all.\n\nNot gripping, way too many POVs (5!!) and timelines (3!) so much so it was almost impossible to keep up. Especially when all the characters are SO unlikeable and one dimensional.\n\n1 ok plot twist hence the second star but honestly if I cared enough about this book I would have figured it out. Still have no idea who Nate is or his relevance to this story.\n\n2⭐️ absolute maximum\n\nJune 19, 2024\n\n4.5 stars!!\n\nI said it before and I will say it again….

What is your favorite @lucyfoleyauthor book??\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n'here among the trees, hidden from the moonlight and starlight, it is as if the modern world is the fairytale: other and strange'\n\nIt's summer solstice in Tome, Dorset - perfect timing for Francesca to open her new luxury wellness hotel. The place is sold out, the welcome weekend has been planned to perfection and Francesca is feeling very zen. But, as different POVs are heard, and their reasons for being at The Manor are revealed, the veneer of opulent tranquility begins to crack and peel; chapter by chapter, person by person, 'When you open up the past like this, it can have repercussions you never imagined'. Add together the rising tide of animosity flooding from the surrounding locals, unhappy with being cut off from the ancient forests and access to the beach and the hottest summer weekend on record, truly becomes scorching.\n\nThis is my first Lucy Foley book and I readily enjoyed the rapid pace of tension and complexity building. Using multiple points of view, journal entries, and pre-event as well as post-event timelines, keeps the reading a pacy, page-turner. I did slightly grumble at the way the ending wrapped up, but with so many threads to cast off, it's hardly surprising. Part mystery, part thriller with horror and folklore elements, this book is bound to keep most readers entertained.\n\n'I always did love sneaking out at midnight as a youth. There's something so alive about this hour: magical and elemental. As though anything could happen'.\n\nThank you NetGalley and HarperCollins UK for the opportunity to read and review this book.\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nBlog | Instagram\n\nRating: 3 stars\n\nDespite an intriguing start and atmospheric setting, I struggled to stay invested in 'The Midnight Feast.'\n\nSimilar read: How to Solve Your Own Murder by Kristen Perrin\n\nCover: 🌟🌟🌟\n\nThis vibrant orange cover certainly stands out and portrays a central aspect of the story with the fire illustration. However, the design is too simple for my liking, and I prefer the American cover.\n\nWriting: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟\n\nThe casual, easy-to-follow writing style suits the characters and narrative well. Vivid descriptions also set a creepy, atmospheric tone throughout and effortlessly brought the story to life.\n\n\"Sometimes doing the things that scare us is how we conquer those fears.\"\n\nStoryline: 🌟🌟🌟\n\nThe story takes its time establishing key characters and setting the stage for the reveals towards the end. However, the slow pace quickly became tedious, as the multiple perspectives and timelines did not effectively build tension, and the theme of classism was not deeply explored. Still, the story does have some great twists as the mystery unravels, leading to a strong ending.\n\nMain character(s): 🌟🌟🌟\n\nBella, Eddie, Francesca, and Owen seemed like well-defined and distinct characters. However, I struggled to care about them because their motives and actions were cloaked in mystery for most of the story, and they experienced little development.\n\n\"Self-love is the first step toward loving others.\"\n\nSecondary characters: 🌟🌟🌟\n\nA relatively small cast of secondary characters helped drive parts of this story, but their actions were mainly behind the scenes, and they failed to make a strong impression on me.\n\nNarration & Audio: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟\n\nRoly Botha, Laurence Dobiesz, Joe Eyre, Tuppence Middleton, and Sarah Slimani gave exceptional performances with natural and well-paced delivery. The different narrators also made the various transitions smooth and easy to follow.\n\nJuly 14, 2024\n\nMy thanks to William Morrow, Lucy Foley and Netgalley.\n\nI have been wanting to read this author for some time, but her book reviews were so scattered amongst my Goodreads friends that I kept giving her a pass. But then this book came up for review on Netgalley and I decided why not? Why not, indeed!\n\nI put in for this book on Netgalley and much to my surprise was approved. Yay!\n\nTo heck with everyone else!\n\nI loved this book!\n\nThis damned story was da' bombdiggity!\n\nI was thoroughly surprised by how completely messed up these peeps were. Honestly? I don't think I've really enjoyed a book like this in quite awhile.\n\nI was completely bummed after finishing to realize that I had no Foley books in my Kindle library. Usually I have at least one or two!\n\nDamn, shit and hell!\n\nNo worries. I'll be fixing that shortly!\n\nAugust 20, 2024\n\nI’m starting to think there’s something wrong with me (or maybe some of my reader friends have already figured that out 🤔), but I really enjoyed this book! I only say this because going by some of the reviews, this book didn’t do so well. However, this was a book that grabbed my attention from the first page and kept me reading past my bedtime 🥱. There was one main character that was so unlikable, I prayed she would not get her way in the end. Oh, and there were the birds. Please do not disturb the birds… 🐦‍⬛🪶\n\nThis book starts off with the opening of The Manor. The Manor is a hotel that has a very wealthy clientele, and it doesn’t sit too well with the locals that live around town. It is The Manor’s opening weekend, and we get to meet the owner Francesca, her husband, some of her staff, and one guest who probably should not be there.\n\nDuring this short weekend, we learn quite a bit about Francesca. One of the main guests also has a diary from fifteen years ago, so through that we get the backstories on quite a few of the characters. Francesca’s Grandfa had told her one thing to always remember, and that was “Don’t upset the birds”, and “You must keep the birds happy”. Francesca did not heed Grandfa’s warning… And things did not go well for The Manor’s opening weekend.\n\nI really enjoyed reading this book. After “The Guest List” by this author, I have to say that this book is my second favorite by her. This would have been a five star read for me, but for some reason I didn’t care for the ending. Yes, it was wrapped up in a nice pretty bow (just how I like it), but I felt it was too “clean”. After all the excitement throughout the rest of the book, I was waiting for the author to throw a monkey wrench in there. Oh well.\n\nAll in all, this is a great read by Lucy Foley that I highly recommend! 🍽️🐦‍⬛🪶"
