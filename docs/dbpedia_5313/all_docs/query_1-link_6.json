Allow me to provide additional insights about this matter.\n\nLast April 24, around 70k Simple Start and Essential users were migrated to the new experience with NO option to go back to the Old layout. Those with Plus and Advanced were also moved to the new one beginning May 6 with NO opt-out.\n\nSince you're noticing different changes to the new invoice, use this article as a reference to view the features that are currently unavailable in the new experience: See whatâ€™s new with estimates and invoices in QuickBooks Online.\n\nRegarding the invoicing format under custom forms, we can check if your chosen style is selected to ensure it reflects on your sales forms. Here's how:\n\nGo to the Gear icon and choose Custom form styles.\n\nLocate the name of your invoice style. It should be marked as default.\n\nIf it's not, click the dropdown arrow beside the Edit button.\n\nTap Make default.\n\nAfter doing so, if it's still not following the color scheme of the invoicing format you've set up and not recognizing the third section of the invoice template, we can perform basic troubleshooting steps by logging in via incognito mode or a private window to confirm if the cache is the cause. Below are the keyboard shortcuts:\n\nGoogle Chrome: Ctrl + Shift + N\n\nMozilla Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + P\n\nMicrosoft Edge: Ctrl + Shift + P\n\nSafari: Command + Shift + N\n\nOnce logged in, open your invoice again. If everything works, go to your regular browser and clear the cache so the system can restart allowing you to work with a clean slate. Alternatively, you can use other supported browsers."
