From managing medications, meals, and doctorsâ appointments to making visiting a priority, caring for an aging/ailing parent can be all-consuming, not to mention the emotional challenge of this inevitable but often unexpected new caregiver role. Even if you outsource some of the work or can afford in-home or assisted-living support, CPEing this card requires all the love in your heart and a good chunk of your time.\n\nConception\n\nThe Wild suit includes life-changing scenarios that rock your world, and come with a mind-numbing amount of invisible work. When youâre dealt a Wild card (hopefully temporarily), youâre entitled to ask for additional help from your partner guilt-free. Your partner is encouraged to reach out to your village for even more support, but the Wild cardholder is not the one who handles this delegation. You and your partner are also encouraged to remove cards from your deck, temporarily, while dealing with a Wild card.\n\nPlanning\n\nExecution\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDo you feel supported to take the lead on this wildcard? Will your partner be stepping up to take on other cards?\n\nBathing & Grooming (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nThe nature of this cardholderâs responsibilities changes depending on your kidsâ ages, but the point is that your kids need to brush their teeth, bathe, wash their faces, cut their nails, and brush their hair. Over and over again. Tip! Pay attention to your kidsâ developing needs. If you notice a suspicious scent every time your teenager is within five feet, itâs probably time for this CPEer to buy deodorant and make sure your kid knows how often to use it. Daily!\n\nConception\n\nBATHING & GROOMING (KIDS) (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Scheduling haircuts- Monitoring supply of bath products, detangler, scissors, toothbrushes and floss and notifying âhome goods and suppliesâ cardholder\n\nExecution\n\n- Carrying out haircuts- Managing daily showers/baths including wash/brushing hair/brushing teeth- Cutting nails and toenails- Boo-boo care- Age-appropriate add-ons (e.g., deodorant, period care, razors, lotion, hair dryer, etc.)- Conducting lice checks when needed\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre your children groomed and presentable to the world? Would you be embarrassed to introduce your child to your boss? (i.e can you smell them from a mile away?)\n\nBedtime Routine (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nIt can be super rewarding when nighttime includes bonding over the dayâs events, cuddling like nobodyâs business, or lying quietly with your precious child. Not so much when this routine becomes a battle over bedtime. Pleas for just one more glass of water or five more minutes of reading can test your patience and fortitude (no wonder Go the F**k to Sleep is a bestselling book). While one person needs to take the CPE lead, the other is not home free (i.e., this is not an ideal window of time for you to hit the couch and start flipping channels). Your collaboration is encouraged. Try this: One partner holds the âbathing and grooming (kids)â card to get the party started while the other is responsible for jammies, stories, and lights out. Keep in mind that this routine wonât last forever. Before you know it, your babies will be teenagers and youâll be going to sleep long before them.\n\nConception\n\nBEDTIME ROUTINE (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Encouraging reading or quiet activity before bed- Coordinating with âbathing and grooming (kids)â cardholder to follow their lead on routine schedule\n\nExecution\n\n- Enforcing lights-out policy at particular time- Reading with kids- Bringing kids to the bathroom- Filling bedside water glass\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre the kids calm before bed and well-rested?\n\nBirthday Celebrations (Other Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nFrom RSVPing to buying presents, the birthday party circuit for your kids is riddled with opportunities for missteps . . . like when youâre already out the door and realize itâs a princess dress-up theme. Oops. And why didnât anyone warn you how many weekend hours youâd be spending at other kidsâ birthday parties chitchatting with parents you hardly know? Do a happy dance if siblings are invited so you can have two kids in the same place at the same time. Note! If you have two or more kids who have to be at separate birthday celebrations, you and your partner can both hold this card separately. A Kid Split means you both CPE the same card at the same time but for separate kids. See page 267 for more about splitting cards. Post Note! This card pairs with the âtransportation (kids)â and âgifts (VIPs)â cards. Meaning, if you RSVPâd yes to the birthday party at the trampoline park, you are responsible for getting your son there (gift in hand) and picking him up afterward.\n\nConception\n\nBIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS (OTHER KIDS)\n\nPlanning\n\n- RSVPing to invitations (informing âcalendar keeperâ cardholder)- Arranging for transportation/attending if younger child\n\nExecution\n\n- Purchasing stickers/cards, wrapping, gift cards and/or birthday gifts- Wrapping gift(s)- Filling out facility waivers (e.g., trampoline park)- Providing money to child if necessary- Attending party if younger child\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDid you RSVP after consulting with your partner and did your kid get there on time with a gift and enjoy the party?\n\nBirthday Celebrations (Your Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nHave you ever tried shoving a dozen balloons into the trunk of your car? Itâs like playing a game of whack-a-mole but you get no prize. How about copying and pasting email addresses for the whole class into your online invitation? Time suck. These are just illustrations of the many tasks youâll handle when planning your childâs birthday party. Even if you keep it simple with a family dinner at home, this cardholder might be the one who battles rush-hour traffic to pick up a cake at a favorite bakery before it closes. Donât forget candles, but no need to buy a present unless youâre also the âgifts (family)â lead.\n\nConception\n\nBIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS (YOUR KIDS)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Discussing party expectations with your child- Creating an invite list- Researching party location options, including available dates, pricing, and number of children allowed- Planning family dinner and other special surprises for day of- In school birthday party preparation and supplies\n\nExecution\n\n- Booking entertainment- Designing an online invitation or ordering printed ones and sending- Ordering favors, decorations, cake, candles, and paper products for party Note: Purchasing gifts is the responsibility of the âgifts (family)â cardholder\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDid the celebration honor your child in a way that felt good to them?\n\nCalendar Keeper\n\nDefinition\n\nYou know how some business executives have an assistant to schedule all their meetings and events? Well, your family is busier but you have no one. Itâs up to you to create a system that works for your family so everyone knows whatâs on the calendar day to day and week to week and plans accordingly. Just when you think youâve nailed the schedule and hung it on the wall, youâll find out that soccer practice is on the same day as Boy Scouts and youâll be back to square one. Add in your own commitments along with your spouseâs, and youâve got a job with more moving parts than a millipede.\n\nConception\n\nCALENDAR KEEPER (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Researching how to keep a shared calendar/joint calendar option/app- Pick a shared calendar option- Conversations/coordinating/tracking invitations with other cardholders\n\nExecution\n\n- Adding/deleting appointments- Creating kids schedules for helpers with âchildcare helpersâ cardholder\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDoes everyone know where they need to be before they have to be there?\n\nCash & Bills\n\nDefinition\n\nHow darn hard can it be to get to the bank so you have adequate cash on hand (after consulting the âmoney manager,â who can help define the standard for adequate)? Enter this cardholder, who will set up a system that prevents all interested parties from ever uttering or hearing, âSorry, hon, Iâve only got five bucks.â This CPEer also handles the payment (on time!) of all bills, whether online, checks in the mail, or auto-pay, and balances the checkbook (or the virtual equivalent). Cozy up with the âmailâ cardholder, who will ensure paper bills come your way.\n\nConception\n\nCASH & BILLS\n\nPlanning\n\n- Set up auto-pay and/or reminders\n\nExecution\n\n- Withdrawing cash for the week- Paying all bills and vendor invoices (auto pay/electronic, Venmo, checks, cash)- Balancing checkbook- Doling out childrenâs allowance\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDo you have cash when you need it? Were all the bills paid on time with no late fees?\n\nChildcare Helpers (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nIt takes a village, and youâre fortunate if your village includes a nanny, babysitter, family caregivers, or others who pitch in with the kids. It can be a lifesaver to have the help, but it still requires someone to Conceive and Plan before Nanny Poppins or Grandma Shirley shows up to help Execute. They donât magically appear when you want them to, so schedules need to be managed, along with payment, delegation of responsibilities, and ongoing communication. Heads up: When your helper cancels or quits, this cardholder is not necessarily the one who drops everything. Rather, engage in Fair Play immediately to re-deal the applicable cards, for example, âtransportation (kids)â and âwatching.â\n\nConception\n\nChildcare Helpers (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\nâ¢ Discussing with stakeholders what is needed for the home at this stage of life\n\nâ¢ Sourcing if not family (care.com/websites/word of mouth/emails/FB posts/agency)\n\nâ¢ Transportation concerns: car seats, boosters, etc.\n\nâ¢ Interviewing (scheduling, conducting, reference checking)\n\nâ¢ Scheduling days they will be working\n\nâ¢ Planning terms including payment â hourly vs. salary, on or off the books, determining payment vehicle/employer\n\nExecution\n\nâ¢ Hiring (negotiating terms/contract)\n\nâ¢ Ongoing communication and supervision\n\nâ¢ Making payments\n\nâ¢ Purchasing/providing meals and snacks for helper\n\nâ¢ Reimbursing: Gas, meals, and other reimbursements\n\nâ¢ Termination issues\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nWill they show up when you need them, know what they are supposed to do and are paid on time?\n\nCivic Engagement & Cultural Enrichment\n\nDefinition\n\nWhy do all your friends have tickets to the local production of Annie, and you didnât even know about it? Maybe they had someone to CPE this card . . . and now you will, too. From your city council meetings to concerts to a lecture at the library, this cardholder will take it upon him or herself to research and plan for community events that enhance your familyâs life experience. Check in with the âcalendar keeperâ before you purchase tickets to see your favorite redheaded orphan storm the stage.\n\nConception\n\nCIVIC ENGAGEMENT & CULTURAL ENRICHMENT\n\nPlanning\n\n- Signing up for civic groups and voter registration drives- Researching opportunities (subscribing to local community, park, mall, bookstore, library events newsletters/emails/texts)- Discussing cultural interests as a family\n\nExecution\n\n- Attending meetings of homeowners association, city council, Neighborhood Watch etc.- Purchasing tickets and/or memberships and attending (performing arts, sporting events, concerts, speaker series, museums/art exhibits, movies, comedy shows)\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre your kids exposed to new events that enhance their regular life experiences?\n\nCleaning\n\nDefinition\n\nThe pancake batter that fell into the crack on the side of the oven?

If you have someone to help deep clean your bathroom and kitchenâlucky you. Itâs still your responsibility to manage the schedule, task list, payment, etc. Re-deal this card often, as itâs a biggie. Tip!

Someone needs to CPE what clothes and accessories to buy, get to the appropriate stores, clean out drawers periodically, and hand off used and outgrown clothes to the âtidying up, organizing, and donationsâ cardholder. Suggested timeline: If your childâs feet have blisters, youâve probably waited too long to buy new shoes. Exception: If there is a camp or school one-off clothing need (see Case of the Color War), this responsibility stays with the âschool breaks (summer)â or âhomeworkâ cardholder.\n\nConception\n\nCLOTHES & ACCESSORIES (KIDS)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Sorting through child's current wardrobe- Determining which clothes still fit and which they have outgrown- Creating a list of clothing needs whether it be seasonal or by occasion or age (e.g., bras)- Evaluating underwear, socks, shoes, and accessories- Arranging for try-on time- Coordinating with âreturns and store creditsâ cardholder if needed Exception: clothes for special school days responsibility of âhomework, projects, and school suppliesâ cardholder\n\nExecution\n\n- Donating or passing on those items they have outgrown to other children- Shopping for items in store or online\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre there appropriate seasonal clothes that are available to the children when they need them? (i.e. winter coat available before the snow comes)\n\nDeath\n\nDefinition\n\nAs if the loss of a loved one isnât unbearable enough, there are also many important items of business requiring your time, including arranging a funeral, a shiva or other spiritual or religious rituals, and then acknowledging those who paid their respects. If handling any will or estate issues and packing up your loved oneâs home and belongings are your responsibilities, prepare to be holding this card for quite some time.\n\nConception\n\nThe Wild suit includes life-changing scenarios that rock your world, and come with a mind-numbing amount of invisible work. When youâre dealt a Wild card (hopefully temporarily), youâre entitled to ask for additional help from your partner guilt-free.

Will your partner be stepping up to take on other cards?\n\nDental (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nYour kidâs job: Pick out a rubber band color for his braces. Your job: Carve out a boatload of time for orthodontist appointments and pay for it all, too. Regular dental visits will also keep you plenty busy because each child needs regular cleanings and checkups (itâs been six months already?) along with more time-consuming appointments for getting cavities filled. You get a free toothbrush at the end of each visit, so at least thereâs that.\n\nConception\n\nDENTAL (KIDS)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Researching and selecting dentist- Scheduling bi-annual dental cleanings- Informing âbedtime routineâ cardholder about appropriate daily dental hygiene- Checking on toothbrush and toothpaste for when to replace and informing âhome goods and suppliesâ cardholder- Orthodontist visits if applicable\n\nExecution\n\n- Attending dentist appointments- Following up with specialists like orthodontists- At-home orthodontic care (purchase and application of rubber bands, head gear etc.)\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre your children at the dentist with a protocol of every six-month visit and do you follow up on the dentists advice?\n\nDiapering & Potty Training (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nLetâs be clear: This cardholder will not be the only one changing diapers. Expect to re-deal this card often. While you are the lead, you will, however, be the one responsible for maintaining inventory, including ordering new diapers or washing cloth ones, and getting the soiled ones out of your house ASAP. This cardholder will also oversee potty training your kids, including cleaning up the mistakes along the way. When youâre finally a diaper-free home, you may still find yourself wiping the butt of your first grader, who is perfectly capable of doing it on his or her own. This will end one dayâpromise.\n\nConception\n\nDIAPERING & POTTY TRAINING (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Determining diapering options (disposable brands or cloth)- Taking inventory of diaper bags (wipes, diapers, creams, changing pad, pacifiers, extra change of clothes, loveys, toys, books, etc.)- Researching, consulting with partner regarding training plan- Informing and enlisting teachers and childcare helpers in potty-training plan\n\nExecution\n\n- Purchasing appropriately sized diapers/wipes as baby grows (or coordinating with âHome Goods and Suppliesâ cardholder)- Stocking diaper bags- Overseeing implementation for potty training\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nIt should be dealt with proactively so are you in a rash-free smell-free home? (i.e are the crystals falling out? WTF are those things?)\n\nDiscipline & Screen Time (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nWhile itâs no fun to discipline kids, the Magic is in setting critical boundaries and giving them tools that will impact how safe they feel and how they conduct themselves for a lifetime. The goal is not for one parent to be responsible for discipline while the other holds âfun! and playingâ forever. Thatâs why this card requires ongoing collaboration between partners, with one cardholder at a time taking the lead. For example, screen time. This came up as the most discussed disciplinary issue within families. Itâs a biggie, and if you hold this card, you may conduct research about an appropriate amount of screen time for your kids and consult with your partner about reasonable boundaries along with the parameters for taking it away; then youâll each enforce your familyâs rules and consequences on an ongoing basis.\n\nConception\n\nDISCIPLINE & SCREEN TIME (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Researching appropriate discipline for different life stages- Devising a strategy to recommend to your spouse- Setting up parental controls, negotiating what games/sites your kid can visit, downloading one of those apps that turns the Wi-Fi off on your childâs device after a certain number of minutes- Informing childcare helpers of limits as needed- Updating plan as needed\n\nExecution\n\n- Informing child and enforcing limits\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre you guiding your children to know right from wrong and the consequences of their actions? What is appropriate for them to watch and for how long?\n\nDry Cleaning\n\nDefinition\n\nEven something as seemingly straightforward as dry cleaning requires step-by-step CPE. This card entails having a bin/bag at home, ensuring the appropriate clothes get into that bin/bag, finding a dry cleaner, knowing when itâs open so you can coordinate drop-off and pickup, and taking off the plastic wrapping before hanging clothes back in the closet. If the mutually agreed-upon MSC is that all clothes come back home, this cardholder is responsible for tracking down their spouseâs favorite shirt when it goes missing or negotiating a refund. (And maybe finding a new dry cleaner, too.)\n\nConception\n\nDRY CLEANING\n\nPlanning\n\n- Researching appropriate dry cleaner for pricing, location and hours- Setting up account at dry cleaner for payment- Scheduling pick-up/drop-off or physical pick-up and drop-off in store- Taking inventory of pieces dropped off\n\nExecution\n\n- Purchasing dry-cleaning bin/or bag and making sure appropriate clothes are in the bin- Tagging pants/shirts with stains- Ensuring matching pieces picked up- Taking off plastic wrapping and placing clothes in closet\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre your dry-cleaned clothes ready and clean when you need them?\n\nElectronics & IT\n\nDefinition\n\nWhen your cell phone screen shatters, who ya gonna call? This cardholder! When your Wi-Fi isnât working or your DVR is full, who ya gonna call? This cardholder! You need not work at the cable company or have tech know-how, but you do need to have ample time and patience to CPE this card, especially when you have to wait six hours for the cable guy. New cords, chargers, and ink cartridges? Also you. Waiting in line to get your kid his first phone? Still you.\n\nConception\n\nELECTRONICS & IT\n\nPlanning\n\n- Researching appropriate electronics such as: TV, laptops/computers, tablets/e-readers, video game systems/VR, headphones, surround sound speakers, cell phones, smartwatches, home theater/audio, chargers/cords, home phones- Researching and arranging for installation of Wi-Fi- Researching password managers\n\nExecution\n\n- Purchasing electronics- Installation management of electronics and cable TV/satellite/boxed TV- Electronics troubleshooting and software updating- Managing subscriptions (including log in information to various vendors such as cable/satellite TV, boxed TV, subscription television and streaming services)- Deleting/managing DVR shows for space storage- Wi-Fi/router maintenance and troubleshooting- Saving data (USB/cloud storage)\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nIs everything up to do date as needed and working when you need it to be?\n\nExtended Family\n\nDefinition\n\nSomeoneâs got to remember to call Great-Aunt Mary on her ninetieth birthday. Same goes for scheduling playdates with cousins if you want the kids to have a relationship (even if youâre the one who always ends up doing the two-hour roundtrip drive). Depending on how much you and your partner value this card, this CPEer might plan frequent get-togethers with relatives or just be the one to remember to invite Uncle Norman to Thanksgiving dinner knowing full well heâll have one too many drinks and talk politics all night.\n\nConception\n\nEXTENDED FAMILY\n\nPlanning\n\n- Staying apprised of health, financial concerns and lives of extended family- Deciding whom to see and planning dates/scheduling family dinners, visits, and reunions\n\nExecution\n\n- Key milestone/time of year/illness calls and correspondence: birthday, holidays, graduations, illness/hospital visits, etc.- Implementing extended family plans\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nIs there a quality relationship with your extended family?\n\nExtracurricular (Kids, Non-Sports)\n\nDefinition\n\nLetâs say your daughter begs to be in the school playâwith rehearsals on the same days that she already has Girl Scouts. This cardholder must sleuth out what the extracurricular commitment entails and how to juggle it within the context of the family calendar. Note! This card pairs with the âtransportation (kids)â and âpacking (local)â cards. Meaning, if you register your daughter for Girl Scouts and also sign her up for the school play, you are responsible for coordinating how she will get to and from both events with both her costume and cookies in hand.\n\nConception\n\nEXTRA-CURRICULAR (NON-SPORTS) (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Determining child's desired activities- Researching all activity options (0-2: baby music, gymnastics, and play groups; 2 and up: variety of options)- Surveying child's friends to see if child can participate with friends (in consult with âfriendshipâ cardholder)- Determining practice schedules if applicable- Managing at home practice and preparation and/or arranging for additional support/coaching (consult with âtutoring/coachingâ cardholder)- Reviewing schedule and consulting with âcalendar keeperâ, âtransportation (kids)â, âtutoring and coachingâ, and âshowing up and participatingâ cardholders- Arranging for transportation\n\nExecution\n\n- Signing up and registering for activities- Purchasing/storing/updating items for activity- Packing necessary items in bag for practice (including water bottle and snacks)- Volunteering when necessary (snack sign-up, work backstage, etc.)\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre you fostering your goals for your children which may include friendship, life skills, healthy competition, coordination, and brain development? Is it consistent enough for your kid to be enriched by the experience (meaningful exposure) and are they demonstrating improvement?\n\nExtracurriculars (Kids, Sports)\n\nDefinition\n\nIf you think this card means just showing up on the right field at the right time to cheer on your kid, you couldnât be more wrong. While the Execution can be rewarding when youâre there to watch your child hit a home run, the Conception and Planning are more tedious and require tremendous forethought. What are the equipment needs? Whatâs the game schedule? And when do you have to provide the team snack? Note! This card also pairs with the âtransportation (kids)â and âpacking (local)â cards. Not only are you responsible for making sure the mitt is in the bag, but youâre also on the hook for coordinating how your kid will get to the field on time.\n\nConception\n\nEXTRA-CURRICULAR (SPORTS) (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Determining child's desired activities- Researching all sports options (school, gyms and/or community leagues)- Surveying child's friends to see if child can play with friends (in consult with âfriendshipâ cardholder)- Determining practice and game schedules- Managing at-home practice and preparation and/or arranging for additional support/coaching (consult with âtutoring/coachingâ cardholder)- Researching equipment needs- Arranging for transportation to practices and games\n\nExecution\n\n- Signing up and registering for the sports lesson/team- Purchasing/storing/laundering/updating necessary uniforms/equipment/cleats- Packing necessary items in bag for practice and games (including uniform, water bottle and snacks)- Volunteering when necessary (snack sign-up, end-of-season party, etc.)\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre you fostering your goals for your children which may include friendship, life skills, healthy competition, coordination, and brain development? Is it consistent enough for your kid to be enriched by the experience (meaningful exposure) and are they demonstrating improvement?\n\nFirst Year of Infant's Life\n\nDefinition\n\nUnsettled hormones, sleep deprivation, and a ravaged body are enough to make this a Wild card, not to mention that your time has all but disappeared. The days of having even a consecutive two-hour stretch of time to be productive are a vague memory as you drown in nursing/feeding, diaper changing, comforting your baby around the clock, and an innumerable amount of other to-dos all courtesy of your bundle of joy. Make no mistake: The first year of an infantâs life is not only a âMom thing.â Thereâs plenty for Dad to do, too. While youâre trying to survive another day, let him dig into the Daily Grind cards: âlaundry,â âdishes,â âgarbage,â âgroceries,â and taking the lead on âmeals (weekday dinner).â\n\nConception\n\nThe Wild suit includes life-changing scenarios that rock your world, and come with a mind-numbing amount of invisible work. When youâre dealt a Wild card (hopefully temporarily), youâre entitled to ask for additional help from your partner guilt-free. Your partner is encouraged to reach out to your village for even more support, but the Wild cardholder is not the one who handles this delegation. You and your partner are also encouraged to remove cards from your deck, temporarily, while dealing with a Wild card.\n\nPlanning\n\nExecution\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDo you feel supported to take the lead on this wildcard? Will your partner be stepping up to take on other cards?\n\nFriendships & Social Media (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nDo you know who your kids are playing with IRL and online? Unless your children come home from school in tears confiding in you, how would you know if theyâre hanging with the wrong crowd, feeling left out, or being bullied? Make it your business to plug in (get it?) to your kidsâ social dynamics online and also help plan and supervise playdates, sleepovers, and any other kid get-togethers.\n\nConception\n\nFRIENDSHIPS & SOCIAL MEDIA (KIDS) (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Friendship detective questions (evaluating childâs social situation to see if they are making connections with others, that is, asking appropriate questions of child: who they play with at recess, who they sit with at lunch etc., is anyone bullying them at school, are they confident in who they are spending their time with)- Discussing friend situation with child at start of school year and working with âteacher communicationâ cardholder on any issues- Planning and scheduling sleepovers, outings, play dates with friends\n\nExecution\n\n- Carrying out sleepovers, outings, play dates with friends- Monitoring and regulating social media accounts in coordination with âdiscipline and screenâ time cardholder\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre they appropriately socialized in real life? Do you feel in control of their social media?\n\nFun & Playing (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nMaybe youâve forgotten that parenting is fun! So fun that after you take your kids to the indoor water park they begged you to take them to, your ensuing urinary tract infection feels totally worth it. Seriously, childhood should include interactive playful moments as a family on a regular basis, and those moments and memories are, in fact, magical (UTI notwithstanding). This cardholder will CPE ongoing time for fun, such as arranging to throw a football around in the park at twilight, creating a weekly family game night, or any other activities your kids enjoy. Holding this card can be a blast, so be sure to hand it back and forth regularly with your partner and spread the fun around.\n\nConception\n\nFUN! & PLAYING\n\nPlanning\n\n- Planning consistent opportunities for family fun: game nights, reading together, playing sports, hiking, races, biking, running, building forts/blocks/Legos, playgrounds, amusement parks, magic, kites, science, tinkering, fun runs, dances, baking, special projects, etc.\n\nExecution\n\n- Executing consistent opportunities for family fun\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nHas your family shared some interactive playful moments recently?\n\nGarbage\n\nDefinition\n\nReally, how much darn trash can one family create? Staggering. To CPE this card means, at minimum, you take out the trash before the garbage truck turns the corner of your block (which day is it again?). Whoever holds this card is responsible for anticipating when trash bags are running low, and a word to the wise: Donât you dare sit back down on the couch until you put a new bag back in the trash can!\n\nConception\n\nGARBAGE (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\nALL NON-APARTMENT DWELLERS- Applying to the city/municipality for garbage bins- Taking note of garbage day\n\nExecution\n\n- Placing/replacing bag in home trash can- Removing full garbage bags- Placing full garbage bags in trash shoot/outdoor bins- Labeling bins- Taking bins back out/in, driving to town dump/placing garbage in alley- Checking bins for overflow trash/keeping bins clean\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nIs trash out of your home before it overflows and if applicable did the cans go out before trash day?\n\nGestures of Love (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nYou know that mom who leaves handwritten notes in her kidâs lunch box that read âI love you to the moon and backâ? Or the dad who drops by basketball practice for a quick hug? With some thought, time, and effortâsome CPE, if you willâthat parent could be you, making every day a little more special for everyone. Note! Youâre both equally capable of having the forethought and spending the time to buy a bouquet of flowers before your childâs dance recital, but trust me on thisâeven gestures of love benefit from one person taking the lead. To ensure that the gesture isnât missed or forgotten, assign one person to pick up flowers for the recital this week, and then re-deal to assign a lead next week.\n\nConception\n\nGESTURES OF LOVE (KIDS)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Creating plan for appropriate gestures Â Â\n\n- May include: flowers for recitals, notes on mirrors/lunch boxes, family hugs, surprise pick-up, etc.\n\nExecution\n\n- Following through on planned gestures\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nWould your kid report random acts of kindness from you if asked? (i.e. flowers at their recital)\n\nGifts (Family)\n\nDefinition\n\nGift giving is not about buying something because a date on the calendar compels you to. When you get it right, itâs about connection and appreciation. The Magic here lies in finding gifts and writing cards that will make your family members feel special when a holiday, graduation, birthday, or any other occasion comes around. So the next time you see a card with a message that would resonate with your child, you might purchase it even though his or her birthday is a few months away. Tip! Re-deal as needed so you donât have to buy birthday gifts for yourself.\n\nConception\n\nGIFTS (FAMILY)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Noting occasions (birthdays, holidays, Motherâs/Fatherâs Day) and people (children, parents, aunts/uncles, grandparents etc.) that may require gifts Exception: Cards/correspondence for extended family, parents, and in-laws stay with those âextended familyâ and âparents and in-lawsâ cardholders.\n\nExecution\n\n- Purchasing birthday cards and presents (having children/partner sign)- Wrapping presents- Shipping gifts if necessary\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre thoughtful gifts given at the appropriate times?\n\nGifts (VIP)\n\nDefinition\n\nWhen it comes to Very Important People gift giving, the recipient might be your childâs teacher, coach, or the neighbors hosting you two doors down. If regifting is your thing, then CPEing this card can be easy and straightforward. Alternatively, this cardholder may wish to spend more time personalizing gifts and writing heartfelt cards. Either wayâor somewhere in the middleâgift giving is an opportunity to connect with and thank the very important people in your life, which requires year-round CPE. Exception: Other kidsâ birthday gifts stays with the âbirthday celebrations (other kids)â cardholder.\n\nConception\n\nGIFTS (VIPS)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Noting occasions (invite to someoneâs home, end of season coaching party, holiday time) and people (friends, coaches, teachers, childcare helpers, service providers such as mail carrier) that may require gifts\n\nExecution\n\n- Purchasing birthday cards and presents (having children/partner sign)- Wrapping presents- Shipping gifts if necessary\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre thoughtful gifts given at the appropriate times?\n\nGlitch in the Matrix/ Daily Disruption\n\nDefinition\n\nThe last thing in the world you have time for is dealing with the unexpected disruption of a fender bender, a computer virus, a flooded basement . . . or having the phone ring and seeing the dreaded school phone number. Your child has lice . . . can you come pick her up? You donât get a vote when a Wild card lands in your lap, but you do get to ask for a helping hand from your partner when a daily disruption torpedoes your day. Remember: Leaving work early because of X, Y, or Z is not âon youâ unless you currently hold this card.\n\nConception\n\nThe Wild suit includes life-changing scenarios that rock your world, and come with a mind-numbing amount of invisible work. When youâre dealt a Wild card (hopefully temporarily), youâre entitled to ask for additional help from your partner guilt-free. Your partner is encouraged to reach out to your village for even more support, but the Wild cardholder is not the one who handles this delegation. You and your partner are also encouraged to remove cards from your deck, temporarily, while dealing with a Wild card.\n\nPlanning\n\nExecution\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDo you feel supported to take the lead on this wildcard? Will your partner be stepping up to take on other cards?\n\nGroceries\n\nDefinition\n\nYour family needs to eat. Can we all agree on that? Good. So how do the pantry and refrigerator get stocked on an ongoing basis? With CPE. This includes noticing whatâs about to be used up or expire, keeping a running grocery list, and getting to the market . . . ideally before you realize thereâs not a drop of milk in the fridge. Even if your family orders groceries online and your go-to dinner is frozen pizza, this card requires CPE nearly 365 days a year. Consult the various âmealsâ cardholders regularly so you can be sure you have taco shells in the cupboard for taco night.\n\nConception\n\nGROCERIES (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Making a master list (consulting with âmealsâ cardholder)- Checking refrigerator and pantry for what is low and adding to list\n\nExecution\n\n- Shopping (grocery stores and/or online)- Loading and unloading groceries- Placing items in pantry/refrigerator- Throwing away expired items from refrigerator/freezer\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre the appropriate, agreed-upon groceries in the home when you need them?\n\nGrooming & Wardrobe (Player 1)\n\nDefinition\n\nLooking and feeling good, especially after children, doesnât come easy. (Thereâs a reason that beauty is a $445 billion industry.) Even if youâre a DIY kind of woman, it still takes time to slather on moisturizer, pluck your eyebrows, style your hair, and put on lipstick. Kick it up a notch and you may add mani/pedis, eyelash extensions, and waxing to your beauty regimen. Add in shopping for clothes (in various sizes for pre-pregnancy, post-pregnancy, nursing, and every other reason your weight fluctuates) and youâve got a potentially expensive and time-consuming card in your hands.\n\nConception\n\nBEAUTY & WARDROBE (PLAYER ONE)\n\nPlanning\n\nINSOURCED- Purchasing all necessary beauty products and tools, including makeup (lipstick, powder, mascara, eye liner/shadow, foundation, eyebrow liner) tweezers, deodorant, moisturizers/lotions/anti-aging creams, makeup removers, hairspray, gel, mousse, etc., hair accessories, nail polish, nail kit (nail files, cuticle scissors, buffers, etc.), hair dye\n\nExecution\n\nINSOURCED- Applying/using all necessary beauty products and toolsOUTSOURCED- Hair removal appointments- Haircut/blow-dry/color/highlights/straightening/extensions (hair, lashes)- Nail appointments- Facials/injection appointments- Tattoos- Piercings\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre you in charge of your own clothes and do you have appropriate clothes for all occasions? Do you feel good about yourself based on your expectations? Can you handle this yourself and not ask your partner to do it for you?\n\nGrooming & Wardrobe (Player 2)\n\nDefinition\n\nImagine a conversation that starts innocently enough with a husband asking his wife, âBabe, whereâs my black suit?â Then comes, âNever mind. Found it.â (Pause.) âShoot, it doesnât fit anymore.â And the coup de grÃ¢ce is that their best friendsâ wedding begins in one hour and the clock is ticking while he blames his wife for failing to buy or rent him a new one. This scenario is all too common as many women in hetero cis gender relationships CPE this card for their husbands. Thatâs right, grown men told me they rely on their wives not only to help them get dressed for special events but also to schedule haircuts, hem their pants, and replace their underwear with holes. If that truly works for you both, God bless. Otherwise, please consider taking this card for yourself, mister. You can do it.\n\nConception\n\nGROOMING & WARDROBE (PLAYER TWO)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Looking through own current wardrobe- Determining which clothes still fit and which might be outdated or worn out- Creating a list of clothing needs whether it be seasonal or by occasion- Evaluating underwear, socks, shoes, belts, and other accessories\n\nExecution\n\n- Donating wrong size, outdated, worn out items- Shopping for necessary items\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre you in charge of your own clothes and do you have appropriate clothes for all occasions? Do you feel good about yourself based on your expectations? Can you handle this yourself and not ask your partner to do it for you?\n\nHard Questions (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nâWhy do I have hair growing under my armpits?â âWhat does it mean when the other kids talk about âdoing itâ?â Enough said. You and your partner may re-deal this card to each other based on the question at hand or which child is asking, but when itâs your turn, be prepared as best you can to research and impart thoughtful, accurate, and age-appropriate wisdom. Spoiler alert: The questions get tougher and the stakes get higher as your kids grow up.\n\nConception\n\nANSWERING HARD QUESTIONS\n\nPlanning\n\n- Determining the appropriate age to discuss certain topics with your child (puberty, gender, sex/pornography, sexuality, drugs/alcohol, suicide, religion, family choices)- Connecting with friends who have older children to gather advice on how to introduce difficult topics- Consulting with doctors, professionals, and/or community resources when necessary\n\nExecution\n\n- Purchasing age-appropriate books to help educate your children- Being available for and open when answering your childrenâs questions\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre your childrenâs hard questions appropriately researched and answered in a way that feels good to both of you?\n\nHealth Insurance\n\nDefinition\n\nItâs a blessing to have health insurance. The paperwork that goes along with it? Not so much. Unless you somehow find a medical practice that handles all the billing for you, this cardholder needs to know every time anyone in your family goes to the doctor, makes sure the appropriate paperwork is filed for insurance, keeps track of reimbursements, and steps in when things go awry. Every time you see an envelope from your insurance provider (consult with the âmailâ cardholder to ensure you receive), say a prayer that youâve been covered.\n\nConception\n\nHEALTH INSURANCE\n\nPlanning\n\n- Determining health insurance options (work, exchange etc.)- Researching various plans (HMO, PPO, etc.) to determine if doctors, specialists, prescriptions, other special needs are covered- Establishing flexible spending plan/health savings account if appropriate\n\nExecution\n\n- Selecting and enrolling in plan during open enrollment window- Fighting for coverage/reimbursements from medical providers- Giving checks to âmoney managerâ cardholder for deposit in bank account- Checking whether deductible is being met\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nIf you are lucky enough to have health insurance, are your co-pays up to date and are you reimbursed in a timely manner?\n\nHoliday Cards\n\nDefinition\n\nGet ready to turn the already chaotic holidays into a job filled with a spreadsheet of personal contacts (did they move?), address labels, and the inevitable returned cards that haunt you until next year. The amount of timeâeven if you go digital with an e-cardâis colossal. Not to mention the nearly impossible feat of taking a family picture with everyone looking in the same direction and smiling! But think about it: Itâs the one time a year Cousin Susie sees a picture of your growing family. In other words, holiday cards can be a meaningful touch point that makes all the CPE well worth it.\n\nConception\n\nHOLIDAY CARDS\n\nPlanning\n\n- Obtaining appropriate photo from âmemories and photosâ cardholder- Creating address list and updating addresses if needed\n\nExecution\n\n- Printing labels or addressing envelopes- Purchasing stamps (or ask âmailâ cardholder to provide)- Applying labels/stamps- Mailing cards\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDid the cards arrive in the desired mailboxes at the appropriate time?\n\nHolidays\n\nDefinition\n\nJust the time it takes to get holiday ornaments out of storage and unwrap them merits a glass of wine (or three), and thatâs before the hard work even begins. From cooking to decor to all the logistics, CPEing any holiday is like running an event-planning companyâsans the paycheck. When the kids want to attempt their own impossible-to-make (but too-cute-to-resist) Halloween costumes, this cardholder will make the Magic happen. Same goes for figuring out whoâs hosting Thanksgiving, organizing Easter brunch with second cousins twice removed, and every other holiday and special ritual that your family celebrates. Saving grace: âtravel,â âgifts (family)â and âmagical beingsâ cards are not included in this card. In other words, leaving cookies out for Santa isnât on you.\n\nConception\n\nHOLIDAYS\n\nPlanning\n\n- Conceiving a holiday plan (discussing with âtravel and hostingâ cardholders) for: - Family specialty dishes - Decorations/dÃ©cor - Day of holiday festivities/rituals/family gatherings Exception: âgifts (family),â âgifts (VIPs),â and âmagical beingsâ (e.g., Santa) are separate cards.\n\nExecution\n\n- Executing a holiday plan\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nIs the holiday reflective of your traditions that will create lasting memories and family nostalgia?\n\nHome Furnishings\n\nDefinition\n\nCPEing this card can be as basic as making sure that every bed has a pillow, you have towels in the closet, and the drinking glasses with cracks get replaced before someone chips a tooth. This card is not a one-time deal, as thereâs regular inventory to be taken and just when you could use that 20 percent off Bed Bath and Beyond coupon, itâs nowhere to be found. Kindly discuss with the âpoints, miles, and couponsâ cardholder so youâre buttoned up for your next trip to the store.\n\nConception\n\nHOME FURNISHINGS\n\nPlanning\n\n- Creating an inventory of what is needed- Researching items for price, look and functionality\n\nExecution\n\n- Purchasing items for the home: pots and pans, cutlery, dishes, towels, sheets, hand towels, pillows (beds, couches, etc.), mattresses, duvets, picture frames, candles, door mats, art/posters, appliances, bed frames, couches, dressers, chairs, dining room table, drapes/shades, kitchen table and chairs, stools, carpets/rugs, trash cans, bedside tables, lamps, coffee table items, book shelves, fireplace, and outdoor items.- Replacing broken/outdated items- Placing items in appropriate area in consultation with âorganizingâ cardholder\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nOnce you agree on a plan for what your home should look like, is that plan implemented?\n\nHome Purchase/Rental, Mortgage & Insurance\n\nDefinition\n\nIf you aspire to be a homeowner with a mortgage one day, then when the time comes, youâll need to CPE the purchasing process. If youâre already a homeowner with a mortgage, this cardholder oversees title insurance, reviewing an infinite amount of statements, and possible refinancing. If youâre looking to rent, then youâll be the one to scour listings, fill out applications, and furnish your credit score. Youâll also handle home insurance (whether you rent or own), including evaluating the appropriate policy and filing claims if needed. Grab this card fast if paperwork and record-keeping are your strong suits.\n\nConception\n\nHOME PURCHASE/RENTAL, MORTGAGE & INSURANCE\n\nPlanning\n\n- Researching neighborhoods (affordability consulting with âmoney managerâ cardholder, local schools, parks, safety)- Selecting home Realtor or rental broker, mortgage broker/lender- Attending open houses and touring homes/apartments- Securing pre-approval from bank for loan (including managing appraisers)- Managing financial documentation (tax returns, bank statements, income verification)- Ensuring credit score is up to par- Budgeting for mortgage payment, property tax/insurance, assessments and other homeowner expenses- Researching homeowners/renters insurance and other possible other options (earthquake, flood, etc.)\n\nExecution\n\n- Making offer (process) and managing closing- Attending and managing inspections- Making down payment money available- Purchasing homeowners/renters insurance and possible other options\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDo you have keys to your pad? Plus insurance for your home and most important items?\n\nHome Renovation\n\nDefinition\n\nWild cards fall on a spectrum in terms of how life-altering and time-consuming the predicament can be. Obviously installing new toilets or kitchen cabinets is not as serious an endeavor as keeping your newborn nourished or managing a parentâs chemotherapy schedule. Still, it sure would be nice to have a working toilet and a functional kitchen, so someoneâs got to do the work to make that happen.\n\nConception\n\nThe Wild suit includes life-changing scenarios that rock your world, and come with a mind-numbing amount of invisible work. When youâre dealt a Wild card (hopefully temporarily), youâre entitled to ask for additional help from your partner guilt-free. Your partner is encouraged to reach out to your village for even more support, but the Wild cardholder is not the one who handles this delegation. You and your partner are also encouraged to remove cards from your deck, temporarily, while dealing with a Wild card.\n\nPlanning\n\nExecution\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDo you feel supported to take the lead on this wildcard? Will your partner be stepping up to take on other cards?\n\nHomework, Projects & School Supplies (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nHas homework become a family affair? Even if you swore youâd never be the kind of parent who micromanages and digs in to your kidsâ assignments, you at least need to be in the know if they donât do their homework and be available if your child needs support. CPEing this card means not only taking the lead on daily assignments but also school projects and enrichment learning at home. If your child needs poster board for âStar Student of the Weekâ or munchies for âSnack Day,â thatâs also on you, as well as outfitting your child for âWacky Winterâ dress-up day and providing two dozen (hand-signed!) Valentineâs Day cards on February 14. This is an endless job, so re-deal this card often.\n\nConception\n\nHOMEWORK, PROJECTS, & SCHOOL SUPPLIES (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Supervising welcome-to-school assignments (e.g., photos of my family)- Assessing childâs daily/weekly homework needs- Helping child prioritize what needs to be done based on after-school activity schedule- Updating âcalendar keeperâ and âschool breaksâ cardholders on all important school dates including fall school recess, half days, conference weeks, winter break\n\nExecution\n\n- Assisting child when needed and providing emotional support when homework is challenging- Assisting child with studying for tests- Supporting and purchasing supplies for major projects (science fair, school biography, secret buddy gifts, Valentines, etc.)- Purchasing/arranging clothes for special days (e.g., school photos, performance concerts, field day, color wars, school theme days) and consulting with âmorning routineâ cardholder- Ordering school uniform if applicable- Ordering/shopping for back-to-school supplies\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre the kids supported enough so that they can turn their homework in on time?\n\nHosting\n\nDefinition\n\nWhether itâs a backyard barbecue, potluck dinner, or any other get-together in your home or elsewhere, hosting often entails sending out invites, planning the menu, filling a vase with flowers, and setting the table (and maybe a separate one for the kids). The downside to holding this card: You may forget to have fun at your own shindig as you bend over backward to ensure everyone else does. The upside: no need for a workout on hosting days, as you will probably hit 10,000 steps before you sit down to eat (if you get to at all).\n\nConception\n\nHOSTING\n\nPlanning\n\n- Creating plan for the event- Curating guest list- Managing RSVPs- Coordinating what guests may bring\n\nExecution\n\n- Sending invitations- Purchasing/rentals: food, drinks, tableware, flowers, music, seating- Decorating (streamers, balloons, flowers, place cards, centerpieces, confetti)- Hiring servers/helpers- Setting up- Cleaning up\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDid your guests have a good time and were their expectations met based on the event?\n\nInformal Education (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nDo you remember who taught you how to hold your breath under water? Throw a ball? Ride a bike? Of course you do, and so will your child as soon as this cardholder gets to work. Kudos to you for the countless hours youâll spend hovering over a bike seat with your back wrenchedâthatâs the Executionâbut pay special attention to the Conception and Planning, as well. Start thinking now about those special milestone moments and life skills you want to teach your children. (Hint: If your kid is the only one in class still wearing Velcro sneakers, you might want to remedy that by teaching him to tie his shoes.)\n\nConception\n\nINFORMAL EDUCATION\n\nPlanning\n\n- Determining age-appropriate skills for children (e.g. shoe tying, buttoning a shirt, bike riding, etiquette/manners/how to write a thank you note, preparing a meal)- Setting a chores list as they grow (coordinate with the related cardholders)\n\nExecution\n\n- Implement plan to impart skills- Modeling chores/manners- Enforcing a chores list as they grow\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nIs your child developing age-appropriate life skills without too much stress?\n\nJob Loss & Money Problems\n\nDefinition\n\nSerious financial issues like unemployment or bankruptcy require heavy lifting that may include networking, job interviews, court appearances, and many other time-sucking items of business. Of course youâre both impacted by the stressful issue at hand, but this cardholder takes the lead on resolving it while consulting with the âmoney managerâ so your familyâs budget can be modified accordingly.\n\nConception\n\nThe Wild suit includes life-changing scenarios that rock your world, and come with a mind-numbing amount of invisible work. When youâre dealt a Wild card (hopefully temporarily), youâre entitled to ask for additional help from your partner guilt-free.

Will your partner be stepping up to take on other cards?\n\nLaundry\n\nDefinition\n\nf you havenât ever CPEâd this card, would you like to take a guess at how many loads of laundry your family generates weekly? A freakinâ lot, thatâs my guess. If you never go a day without clean socks and your daughter can always find her favorite rainbow shirt, then be sure to thank this cardholder, who not only throws the load in the washer and dryer but also folds it and puts it all away. If laundry tends to pile up and multiply in your home, itâs time to re-deal this card and come up with a new standard before the next cycle begins.\n\nConception\n\nLAUNDRY (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Sorting clothes and reviewing clothing instructions (colors/whites/delicates)\n\nExecution\n\n- Spraying stains pre-wash- Washing/drying- Ironing/steaming- Hanging, folding, putting away\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre there laundered clothes when you need them where you need them in their place in the respective closets? (i.e not all over the floor or wrinkled in the dryer)\n\nMeals (Weekday Dinner)\n\nDefinition\n\nIf you have never CPEâd dinnertime in a family with kids (particularly young ones), then no words can really do justice to this nightly circus. The ringleader plans a weekly menu, consults the âgroceriesâ cardholder to have the ingredients at home, then cooks, ensures that the food actually gets eaten, and ideally uses this forced family time to have âqualityâ conversations about everyoneâs day. Men: Kudos to you if cooking is one of your domestic contributions, but thatâs just one word on this doozy of a card. Hero status isnât awarded for just pulling out a frying pan.\n\nConception\n\nMEALS (WEEKDAY DINNER) (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Menu planning/recipe selection- Making lists of items needed (give to âgroceriesâ cardholder with appropriate amount of time or purchase yourself)\n\nExecution\n\n- Cooking/preparing- Serving- Putting dishes in sink for âdishesâ cardholder\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nIs your family fed a reasonably nutritious meal during the appropriate time window for each meal. (i.e Lunch at 4 pm doesnât cut it when kids last ate at 8 am.)\n\nMeals (Weekend)\n\nDefinition\n\nWhy do weekend meals feel more burdensome than weekday meals? Oh, let us count the ways. Maybe itâs because there are twice as many of them than on a school day. Perhaps itâs because they amplify the kitchen mess exponentially. Or because when you make it to Saturday night, youâre still only halfway there. Weekend meals deserve their own cardâwho wants it? Psst. Serving lunch at 4 p.m. doesnât cut it unless midday meltdowns are your thing.\n\nConception\n\nMEALS (WEEKEND)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Menu planning/recipe selection- Making lists of items needed (give to âgroceriesâ cardholder with appropriate amount of time or purchase yourself)- Determining meals eaten out or with friends/family\n\nExecution\n\n- Cooking/preparing- Serving- Putting dishes in sink for âdishesâ cardholder\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre you monitoring the time and making sure your kids are being fed during the appropriate window?\n\nMedical & Healthy Living (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nFrom stocking up on standard pain relievers and regular checkups at the pediatrician to seeing specialists as needed, your kidsâ medical care requires tremendous research, coordination, and time. Healthy living may also include buying vitamins and healthy snacks (in collaboration with the âgroceriesâ cardholder) and inspiring an active lifestyle with family exercise or other heart-pumping activities. This cardholder also takes the lead stocking up on items like hand sanitizer, sunscreen, and bug spray. Exception: Youâre off the hook from dealing with âhealth insuranceâ unless thatâs your card, too.\n\nConception\n\nMEDICAL & HEALTHY LIVING (KIDS) (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Researching, interviewing and selecting pediatrician- Scheduling well checks, vaccine appointments, and annual physicals- Ensuring that child has up-to-date vaccines- Keeping track of questions to ask doctor between well visits- Scheduling childâs sick visits- Determining if specialists are necessary (e.g., eye doctor, GI etc.)- Prevention: researching vitamins and sunscreen (for morning routine cardholder)- Encouraging active lifestyle for all family members, especially exercise- Ensuring that âgroceriesâ cardholder is including plenty of healthy food options for adults and children\n\nExecution\n\n- Purchasing and stocking standard pain reliever/allergy medicines for children (and adults whenever possible)- Keeping specialty medicine up to date, including specialty items like EpiPen and asthma medications/nebulizers- Attending, and taking notes during well checks, vaccine appointments, and annual physicals- Attending childâs sick visits- Filling prescriptions, checking medicine side effects and administering medicine- Manage at-home medical issues such as constipation, sleeping issues, allergies, other GI, asthma, ENT, etc.- Purchasing vitamins and sunscreen- Monitoring family membersâ consumption of caffeine, alcohol, fried foods, smoking habits, fatty foods- Encouraging calming behaviors/quiet times\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre you on top of your kids health concerns and do they go to their physicals on time?\n\nMemories & Photos\n\nDefinition\n\nGod bless those parents who make photo albums every year and who can rest assured that if the basement flooded, all their old photos are scanned and backed up in the cloud. No need to aim that high, but if you hold this card, your familyâs lifelong memories are nevertheless in your hands. When a photo collage is needed for âStudent of the Week,â itâs time to cue the music . . . and kiss some of your time goodbye. When the boxes of your childâs artwork that youâve been collecting since kindergarten threaten to take over every wall in your home, itâs time to consult with the âstorageâ and âorganizingâ cardholder. Do we keep it all or secretly recycle?\n\nConception\n\nMEMORIES & PHOTOS\n\nPlanning\n\n- Researching photo storage and back up options: cloud options by storage fees and functionality and/or hard drive- Signing up for cloud accounts including managing user name and passwords- Arranging family photo shoots\n\nExecution\n\n- Taking pictures- Organizing digital photos into folders- Creating photo books and/or printing photos- Digitizing old photos (scan, upload, file)- Creating home videos / photo montages\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre the appropriate photos readily accessible when you need them? Are you capturing memories you desire?\n\nMiddle of the Night Comfort (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nDefine âmiddle of the nightâ as you see fit, because when daylight savings time hits, you may think of this as the âway too early to be morningâ card that leaves you dog-tired and at your witâs end. (Itâs amazing how just one hour can do so much damage!) Bad dreams at 3 a.m., cries of âI canât sleep!â just when youâre curled up in bed to watch TV, and help with trips to the toilet for that stomach bug going around are all in this cardholderâs hands. As one woman explained it, âWhen my husband has middle-of-the-night duty, I refer to this as the âDonât call Momâ card!â\n\nConception\n\nMIDDLE-OF-THE-NIGHT COMFORT (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Making yourself available for your children following bedtime routine, including:\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Trouble falling asleep\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Middle of the night feedings\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Nightterrors\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Bed-wetting\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Researching, creating a plan, gathering input from partner about sleep training\n\nâ\n\nExecution\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Executing plan for sleep training\n\nâ\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDo your kids have consistent access to a designated parent if middle-of-the-night issues arise?\n\nMoney Manager\n\nDefinition\n\nIf youâre taking the lead on this card, you are intrepid because managing a familyâs budget is no small feat. Planning for the present and preparing for the future is a good start, but thereâs so much more to CPEing this card. Short and long-time budgeting. Paying off debt. Retirement planning. College savings and 401(k) investments. And of course thereâs also the fun that rolls around every April 15. Day-to-day âcash and billsâ is a separate card, and these cardholders will collaborate often.\n\nConception\n\nMONEY MANAGER\n\nPlanning\n\n- Researching investments etc. (self)- Researching broker/investment adviser/online brokerage and all issues related to retirement, college, emergency funds etc.- Tax planning\n\nExecution\n\n- Managing investment accounts (including 401k/retirement and college funds) with financial adviser/online broker (in or Outsourced)- Managing family budget (income and expenses)- Tax receipt and form collecting and filing appropriate forms (self, tax preparation software, or with accountant)- Depositing checks in bank account\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDo you have a budget / financial plan?

Before kids, if youâre holding this card. This cardholder is prepared for daily combat before sunrise with a baby and early still with school-aged kids who often need rousing from bed and help getting dressed, hair and teeth brushed, sunscreen applied, and ushering out the door.

(i.e. when itâs 20 degrees out, shorts donât cut it)\n\nMoving\n\nDefinition\n\nThereâs a reason why moving is typically on the Top 10 list of hellish events; it can be as stressful as the death of a loved one, divorce, or unemployment. The process of purging, packing, relocating, organizing, storing, and living in disarray is all-consuming, disruptive to your familyâs routines, and basically upends your life. Good news: Itâs temporary. Bad news: Itâs a CPE doozy. Who is better equipped to take the lead?\n\nConception\n\nThe Wild suit includes life-changing scenarios that rock your world, and come with a mind-numbing amount of invisible work. When youâre dealt a Wild card (hopefully temporarily), youâre entitled to ask for additional help from your partner guilt-free.

Exactly. Itâs got to be restocked, just as backpacks need to be packed (and unpacked) daily with library books, lunch, homework, water bottles, clothes for after-school activities, and about a million other things youâll forget if you donât have a system in place. Bonus duties: packing for sleepovers, packing and replacing the change of clothes in the school cubby as needed, and hitting up the schoolâs lost and found when only one glove makes it home.\n\nConception\n\nPACKING & UNPACKING (LOCAL) (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\nBACKPACKAFTERNOON/DAY-OUT BAG- Taking inventory of afternoon out bags (water bottle, snacks, sunscreen etc.)SLEEPOVER- Determine what is needed for overnight bag (e.g., bathroom bag, clothing, sleeping needs, medical (e.g., Epi-Pen)) *Note: If it is a birthday celebration sleepover, keep the packing with the âbirthday celebration (other kids)â cardholder who reads the invitation or coordinate closely.\n\nExecution\n\nBACKPACK- Backpack packing. including snack, water bottle, lunch box (prepared by âweekday (school lunches)â cardholder, homework, library books/textbooks/folders, special items- Backpack unpacking including emptying lunch box and placing in sink for âdishesâ cardholder- Following up on lost items/lost and foundAFTERNOON/DAY-OUT BAG- Stocking afternoon out bagsSLEEPOVER- Overnight bag packing and unpacking\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDo the bags contain what they need at the times you use them? Are they unpacked in a timely manner?\n\nPacking & Unpacking (Travel)\n\nDefinition\n\nYouâre not alone if packing for a trip with kids leaves you questioning if itâs worth going on the trip at all. It feels like moving the army, only your troops may be too young to pack and carry their own gear. Rookie mistake if just before takeoff you discover the iPad battery is at 1 percent.\n\nConception\n\nPACKING & UNPACKING (TRAVEL)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Creating a packing list, including âmorning ofâ travel packing list (e.g., snacks, fully charged electronics, headphones, sleep accessories)- Packing list considerations: weather forecast and laundry opportunities- Determining suitcase needs and purchase when necessary (sharing/individual)- Downloading, reading, and managing sleepaway camp packing list (if applicable)\n\nExecution\n\n- Purchasing items needed- Actual packing- Updating addresses on luggage tags- Charging all electronics before flying- Getting children involved in packing carry-on items, special items/loveys, medicine- For sleepaway camp and extended travel: ordering labels/Sharpie and labeling clothing with childrenâs names- Printing or downloading tickets; making sure everyone who needs an ID has one- Filling car with gas if a road trip\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nSure a forgotten item is common but is everything in the bags that you need or are you stuck purchasing items in a pinch on the road?\n\nParents & In-Laws\n\nDefinition\n\nWhether your parents and/or in-laws live nearby or thousands of miles away, itâs a relationship that can require a fair amount of TLC and CPE. Someoneâs got to call them regularly, help them figure out how to turn on their TV with one of their 100-year-old remotes, and invite them to holiday or birthday celebrations. (Or maybe not.)\n\nConception\n\nPARENTS & IN-LAWS\n\nPlanning\n\n- Plan for parent/in-law engagement- Calling/arrange for visits and visiting parents and in-laws an adequate amount (consult with âtravelâ cardholder)- Becoming familiar with parentsâ/in-lawsâ health, including medical history, current medical issues, financial or other concerns\n\nExecution\n\n- Purchasing and have family members sign or decorate cards for important occasions (birthday, holiday, Motherâs/Fatherâs Day)- Handling parents/in-laws needs during their visits, including airport transportation, activity/meal planning, taking vacation days to spend time with them- Managing parentsâ/in-lawsâ wishes for burial while alive- Educating on electronics/IT/other current issues\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDo you agree on the role parents/in-laws have in your life? If not, can you agree on an reasonable role going forward?\n\nPartner Coach\n\nDefinition\n\nEvery time you help your loved one with his or her work, you are engaging in the highly invisible work of partner coaching. When you edit an email before your husband sends it to his boss, help him plan an important outing with a client, or lie in bed at night thinking through how he could be considered for a promotion, you are doing the loving and often unrecognized work of âcoachingâ your partner. This card can be one-sided (that is, a wife helping a husband but not the other way around). The aspiration is to hand off the card more equitably so both partners can benefit from each otherâs support and advice.\n\nConception\n\nPARTNER COACH\n\nPlanning\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Consulting with spouse about what is needed to enrich career.

Ha! Now, here you are with a bundle of furry love . . . and a bundle of work. Your to-do list depends on what kind of animal you have, but across the board this cardholder typically CPEs food, veterinary appointments, grooming, pet supplies, finding a pet sitter for when youâre away, and the least fun but most importantâtaking out the kitty litter or being on the ready with poop bag in hand.\n\nConception\n\nPETS (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Researching pet type/breed- Finding breeder and or rescue/shelter, researching with breeder/shelter and communication- Animal proofing if needed- Researching and interviewing veterinarian- Arranging for receiving pet- Handling vet checkup appointments (e.g. necessary shots, spayed/neutered, nails, clipping, health concerns, medicine)- Handling vet sick appointments- Determining if it makes sense to purchase pet insurance and researching insurance plans- Finding a groomer and scheduling grooming appointments- Securing care during out-of-town travel/away times including researching options/ interviewing person or viewing facility- Hair pick up issues (researching vacuum options etc.)- Arranging for special outside access (e.g. dog door)- Researching and purchasing appropriate food\n\nExecution\n\n- Receiving pet- Purchasing food and treats and other necessary items (e.g. grooming items, bedding, crate, harness, litter- Training (bathroom, sleeping, biting and introduction to babies/children)- Feeding: Providing food and water daily and keeping bowls clean- Outdoor access and walking: Conducting appropriate amount of walks and exercise if applicable and/or scheduling dog walker/day care- Pick up poop/empty litter box daily and weekly maintenance- Bathing and brushing and/or attending grooming appointments- Cleaning up after pet (stays with this cardholder or consult with âtidying up, organizing, and donationsâ)\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre your pets healthy, groomed, and socialized?\n\nPoints, Miles & Coupons\n\nDefinition\n\nDo you know if you have enough airline miles to fly free on your next trip? And also bring your partner along for the ride? This cardholder keeps track of miles, credit card points, coupons, and all those big money savers.

Store credit? Gift cards from your mother-in-law? Sure, they were for your kids, but whoâs gonna know if you used one to buy those cute shoes on sale?\n\nConception\n\nRETURNS & STORE CREDITS\n\nPlanning\n\n- Keeping track of items that need to be returned- Figuring out store return policy\n\nExecution\n\n- Returning items (within store policy window)- Donating or reselling items (if expired)- Purchasing items with store credits (within store policy window)- Managing gift cards and give to other cardholders such as âclothes and accessories (kids)â when appropriate for use\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDid you return the items during the allotted store policy window? Do you know where your credits are?\n\nSchool Forms (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nEvery freakinâ form from school that requires review, including your childâs enrollment forms, notices for overdue library books, and permission slips for field trips is now in your hands. School forms may come via email (check your spam folder), crumpled up in your childâs backpack, on a school website, or via the school portal, which youâre supposed to know how to log onto and navigate by now but remains one of lifeâs mysteries. School forms are enough for this cardholder; direct contact with teachers is the responsibility of the âteacher communicationâ cardholder.\n\nConception\n\nSCHOOL FORMS\n\nPlanning\n\n- Coordinate with âpacking and unpacking (local)â and âhomework, projects, and school suppliesâ cardholders to see if forms come in backpack/homework folder.

Which it was . . . until you found yourself sitting at the back of a school bus trying not to puke. This card pulls you into a time-sucking vortex that includes reading through a chain of 43 emails (was âreply allâ really necessary?), school-sponsored lectures (another one?), and baking cupcakes (nut free?). And whatâs up with schools requesting volunteers to be class âmomsâ?

And that work only begins after youâve completed loads of research about where to apply, considered what might be the best fit for your child, and created your best chances to get in. (Is the lottery really just a lottery? Better find out.)\n\nConception\n\nSCHOOL TRANSITIONS (KIDS)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Researching potential school options for child- Scheduling any necessary academic testing (SAT/ACT)- Requesting forms from current school (transcripts etc.)- Researching testing prep opportunities\n\nExecution\n\n- Touring schools- Completing and submitting school applications or open-enrollment forms- Attending any mandatory informational meetings or additional get-to-know-you events (e.g. school fundraisers)- Signing up for testing prep opportunities\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre you in charge of the processes necessary for your child to transition to a new school?\n\nSelf-Care (Player 1)\n\nDefinition\n\nEach of you gets a self-care card regardless of how many children and other responsibilities you have. For some, a daily multivitamin, a good book, and a hot bath fit the bill. Others may have weekly therapy or wellness appointments, and also set aside regular time to exercise. No guilt or shame allowed.

If you are managing someone elseâs illness, it can require hours of research, doctorsâ appointments, treatment plans, and medication monitoring. Thankfully, you can ask your partner to step in and support you. If, however, itâs you or your spouse who is ill, the healthier person may need to take on more cards in addition to holding this Wild card. Rather than allowing resentment or fear to build, ask for what you need and re-deal as circumstances change.\n\nConception\n\nThe Wild suit includes life-changing scenarios that rock your world, and come with a mind-numbing amount of invisible work. When youâre dealt a Wild card (hopefully temporarily), youâre entitled to ask for additional help from your partner guilt-free. Your partner is encouraged to reach out to your village for even more support, but the Wild cardholder is not the one who handles this delegation.

Will your partner be stepping up to take on other cards?\n\nShowing Up & Participating\n\nDefinition\n\nOne dad admits that he spent nearly a month complaining about the daddy/daughter dance at school, dreading everything from the small talk with other dads to the awkwardness of busting out his moves. Ultimately he went, and it turned out to be pure Magic for both him and his growing-up-too-fast fourth grader. Youâve got to show up for and participate in your childâs events, big and small, for the Magic to happen. Re-deal this card frequently to make sure it does.\n\nConception\n\nSHOWING UP & PARTICIPATING\n\nPlanning\n\n*Note: No CPE other than showing up on time.

But thatâs not how it works in real life, and certainly not how it works after having kids. For starters, you want your partnerâs buy-in for who youâre getting together with, and youâll need to get a babysitter, so consult with the âchildcare helpersâ cardholder. Then, syncing calendars (pre-bedtime? after the championship game?) will make you question if itâs really worth the effort. If you actually make it out the door without cancelling, you have earned a bonus cocktail.\n\nConception\n\nSOCIAL PLANS (COUPLES)\n\nPlanning\n\n- RSVPing to party/night out invitations- Discussing with partner who you both would like to see- Reaching out to friends/colleagues seeking plans- Coordinating schedules- Determining restaurant/event interest- Designating alcohol-free driver or calling an Uber\n\nExecution\n\n- Working with âchildcare helpersâ cardholder to confirm babysitter- Making reservations- Purchasing tickets to events\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nWhile there may be one more extroverted partner, is it reasonable to expect to socialize with other couples on occasion? Try to agree to a mutual comfort.\n\nSpecial Needs & Mental Health (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nObviously this card needs to be CPEâd with tremendous care if your child has special needs or mental health issues. From identifying the problem to finding the best resources, scheduling appointments, monitoring medication, planning treatment, handling a school IEP, and beyond, this cardholder will steer the ship that guides your child safely and with love. It takes a village, so your Planning should include how to utilize any help from your wider support system to create an environment that fosters progress.\n\nConception\n\nSPECIAL NEEDS & MENTAL HEALTH (KIDS) (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Identifying and evaluating childâs current emotional state/special needs- Doctor/professional appointments for diagnosis and follow up- Researching and interviewing specialists for treatment such as therapists, OT, PT, speech- Discussing issues/treatment plan with child's teacher (consulting with âteacher communicationâ cardholder)- Scheduling specialist appointments- Educating oneself, teachers, childcare helpers, other parents and child on issue/risks/special needs/ancillary issues like bullying (options may include: books, seminars, find support groups for you and your child or start a support group)OTHER THINGS TO NOTE IF CHILD HAS AN ALLERGY/FOOD SENSITIVITY):- Educating oneself and others on how best to read food labels- Scheduling meetings with teacher- Creating a notebook to have in classroom with info on what child can/can't eat- Pre-planning for birthday parties and other events that involve bringing own snacks- Calling before parties and restaurants to find out what will be served or what options there are- Researching safe restaurants/deliver menus for childcare helpers\n\nExecution\n\n- Working closely with âhealth insuranceâ cardholder to get coverage and medications for the issue- Advocating and meeting with school educators to secure necessary supports (i.e., IEP)- Supporting child- Attending specialist appointments(OTHER THINGS TO NOTE IF IT IS AN ALLERGY/FOOD SENSITIVITY):- Purchasing EpiPen if needed (or coordinating with âmedical and healthy livingâ cardholder)- Packing a snack bin for classroom with safe alternative snacks- Meeting with the school nurse- Asking school to inform other parents to let them know who your child is and what is safe and unsafe for them to eat since they may be volunteering in classroom or sending in treats- Purchasing apps that have information for grocery shopping and restaurant finding- Always have safe snacks on hand\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre they getting the available support to maximize their productivity and potential?\n\nSpirituality\n\nDefinition\n\nThis card looks and feels different to everyoneâperhaps even within your own homeâso all the more reason you should consult your partner in the Planning to make sure youâre on the same page. (Ahem, you donât have carte blanche to join a cult just because itâs your card.) It may involve attending church/synagogue/mosque, planning events like communion or a bar/bat mitzvah, establishing a relationship with clergy members, enforcing dietary beliefs, creating a family meditation ritual, or any number of ways you decide to make spirituality a part of your familyâs life.\n\nConception\n\nSPIRITUALITY\n\nPlanning\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Researching local churches/temples/synagogues/spiritual centers in your area\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Registering for Sunday school / Hebrew school / confirmation class*\n\nâ\n\nExecution\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Attending religious services on holidays or weekly\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Educating children / rituals in the home\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Buying high holiday tickets (if applicable)\n\nâ\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nIs your life one where there is a practice of a higher purpose? Does it include your children?\n\nStorage, Garage, & Seasonal Items\n\nDefinition\n\nIf you have a storage unit or a garage, do you have any idea whatâs inside it? If not, now is the time to get it organized and have a CPE plan in place before someone asks, âHoney, whereâs Zachâs sleeping bag? He has a sleepover tonight.â\n\nConception\n\nSTORAGE, GARAGE, & SEASONAL ITEMS\n\nPlanning\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Inventory management of summer/beach/lake/camping/\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â bikes/pool items or winter items\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Researching and renting storage unit\n\nâ\n\nExecution\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Managing items in garage (place in bins, racks, shelving etc.) orgive away to âtidying up, organizing, and donationsâ cardholder)\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Tidy shelves and storage in garage\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Air in bicycle tires, sports balls, pool rafts\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Organize sports, ski, and camping equipment and/or luggage\n\nâ\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nIs the garage or unit reasonably organized? Can you find things when you need them?\n\nTeacher Communication (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nEvery teacher and child is different, so this cardholderâs responsibility could be as minimal as showing up to the parent-teacher conference once or twice a year. Or your communication may involve a weekly email exchange or speaking daily and face-to-face to discuss homework and your childâs unique learning needs. As the CPEer, itâs up to you to proactively keep tabs on your kiddos in their school environment to identify potential challenges and work with their teachers to help them thrive.\n\nConception\n\nTEACHER COMMUNICATION\n\nPlanning\n\n- Receiving and reading teacher emails- Scheduling parent-teacher conferences\n\nExecution\n\n- Notifying child of important issues- Monitoring academic progress, behavior, socialization and school absences- Attending parent-teacher conferences- Executing teacher recommendations/items to work on with child- Communicating plan to Homework and/or Tutoring and Coaching card holder\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre you communicating consistently enough to troubleshoot and be proactive in identifying potential challenges?\n\nThank You Notes\n\nDefinition\n\nWhy would the dreaded task of writing thank-you notes be considered Magic? Because thank-you notes are an opportunity to express gratitude to people who inspire you to feel it. If you have family dinner with friends, you might send an email letting them know how wonderful it was to spend time together. When a colleague delivers a huge bag of hand-me-downs for your kids, that thoughtfulness merits a note. Imagine a life where sleep-deprived postpartum moms are not saddled with writing thank-you notes for baby gifts. That can be your reality, as either partner is capable of CPEing this card.\n\nConception\n\nTHANK YOU NOTES\n\nPlanning\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Obtaining appropriate information\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Creating address list and updating addresses if needed\n\nâ\n\nExecution\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Printing labels or addressing envelopes\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Purchasing stamps (or ask âmailâ cardholder to provide)\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Applying labels/stamps\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Mailing cards\n\nâ\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDid the cards arrive in the desired mailboxes at the appropriate time?\n\nTidying up, Organizing & Donations\n\nDefinition\n\nThis never-ending work includes making beds, putting toys away, finding the Legos under the couch (preferably before you buy a whole new set), and wrapping up the half a banana sitting on the counter before fruit flies infest your home. This 784card is a hot-button issue for many couples who often disagree on a standard for âtidy,â so before one of you claims it, get specific about how long you can both live with the toy closet thatâs bursting at the seams, all the random crap accumulating under the stairwell, and the donation bags that have been sitting in the trunk of the family car for months. Unless your aspiration is to star on Hoarders (and your partner agrees to costar), you may want to binge a few episodes of Tidying Up with Marie Kondo.\n\nConception\n\nTIDYING UP, ORGANIZING & DONATIONS (DG)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Developing a system for organizing your physical home: closets, kitchen/pantry, bedrooms, playroom, office etc. and digital home: organizing computer files in consultation with âmemories and photosâ cardholder- Taking stock of what children are currently playing with and what you can donate/ hand down- Creating list of donated items and value for tax purposes- Researching options for where items will be donated or family/friends to hand down to- Identifying storage needs and measuring storage space\n\nExecution\n\n- Clearing/wiping counters- Putting away toys and shoes- Tidying throw blankets and pillows- Safely storing important documents, including birth certificates, passports and Social Security cards- Gathering items to be donated from âclothes and accessories (kids)â and âwardrobe (her/his)â cardholders- Dropping off donations- Purchasing storage and organizational containers- Putting together/building storage container\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nDoes every item in your home have a proper place and is there a system to get them there? Are those that donât get donated?\n\nTransportation (Kids)\n\nDefinition\n\nFull. Time. Job. Whether your kids take a bus, carpool, walk, or have a chauffeur (aka you), managing their transportation can be a beast. On any given day, you could be spending countless hours transporting your kids to school or coordinating with those who are pitching in with drop-offs and pickups. Add on getting them to and from playdates, after-school activities, camp, and every other place they need to be seven days a week and weâve come full circle: Full. Time. Job. Note! The âtransportation (kids)â card pairs with âbirthday celebrations (other kids),â âfriendships and social media (kids),â âextracurricular (non-sports),â and âextracurricular (sports).â Meaning, if you hold any of the aforementioned cards and they involve giving your kid a ride, you are responsible for transporting or arranging for transportation to and from those activities.\n\nConception\n\nTRANSPORTATION (KIDS)\n\nPlanning\n\n- Coordinating and implementing the commute to/from school, extracurricular activities, enrichment, events, playdates, parties- If school bus, signing up for appropriate route- If public transportation, securing bus/subway pass- If carpool, extra considerations: selecting families that live nearby to carpool with (coordinate booster/car seats); determining schedule for your shift and othersâ- Finalizing daily schedule with âcalendar keeperâ\n\nExecution\n\n- Implementing the commute to/from school, extracurricular activities, enrichment, events, playdates, parties\n\nMinimum Standard of Care\n\nAre the children where they need to be and picked up on time?\n\nTravel\n\nDefinition\n\nWhen youâre thinking about taking a trip, the who/where/ when/how formula has endless permutations. If you add in any extended family, best of luck as you navigate how to get everyone to the same place at the same time on a budget, where hopefully fun awaits. Even a day trip for a friendâs wedding requires someone to handle logistics, so just because youâre not jet-setting to a white sand beach doesnât mean youâre off the hook from CPEing this card. Tip! Work closely with the âpacking and unpacking (travel)â cardholder to ensure that once you get to your destination, you have the appropriate"
