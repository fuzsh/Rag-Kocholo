        "text": "When it comes to songs of worship, the topic of love can be addressed in so many ways. We can sing about God’s love for us, our love for him, or the love that exists between Christians as God knits our hearts together. Love is definitely a rich topic that worship leaders should explore regularly.\n\nHere are some incredible Christian love songs about love broken into those three categories. You can utilize MediaShout or any church presentation software to display this list of Christian love songs in your Sanctuary.\n\nSongs about God’s love for us\n\n1. And Can It Be (Amazing Love)\n\nThis beloved hymn was written by Charles Wesley in 1738. He and his brother John had started the Methodist movement, but were very rigid and severe in their personal disciplines. After returning home from a disastrous mission trip to the American colony of Georgia, Charles was ill and heartbroken.\n\nIt was at this time that someone offered him Martin Luther’s work on Galatians, and it was a revelation to Charles. He was overwhelmed by the realization that his legalism was an attempt to earn the unfailing love that God lavished upon him freely. In his journal he wrote, “At midnight I gave myself to Christ, assured that I was safe, whether sleeping or waking. I had the continual experience of His power to overcome all temptation, and I confessed with joy and surprise that He was able to do exceedingly abundantly for me above what I can ask or think.”\n\nIn a couple day’s time, he had completed this new hymn in response to this experience. And Can It Be’s refrain is a beautiful reminder of the unmerited love of God.\n\nAmazing love! how can it be\n\nThat Thou, my God, should die for me!\n\nThe verses powerfully communicate how the gospel story is one of God’s never-ending love toward his creation.\n\nAnd can it be that I should gain\n\nAn interest in the Savior’s blood?\n\nDied He for me, who caused His pain?\n\nFor me, who Him to death pursued?\n\nAmazing love! how can it be\n\nThat Thou, my God, should die for me?\n\n‘Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!\n\nWho can explore His strange design?\n\nIn vain the firstborn seraph tries\n\nTo sound the depths of love divine!\n\n‘Tis mercy all! let earth adore,\n\nLet angel minds inquire no more.\n\nHe left His Father’s throne above,\n\nSo free, so infinite His grace;\n\nEmptied Himself of all but love,\n\nAnd bled for Adam’s helpless race;\n\n‘Tis mercy all, immense and free;\n\nFor, O my God, it found out me.\n\nLong my imprisoned spirit lay\n\nFast bound in sin and nature’s night;\n\nThine eye diffused a quickening ray,\n\nI woke, the dungeon flamed with light;\n\nMy chains fell off, my heart was free;\n\nI rose, went forth and followed Thee.\n\nNo condemnation now I dread;\n\nJesus, and all in Him is mine!\n\nAlive in Him, my living Head,\n\nAnd clothed in righteousness divine,\n\nBold I approach the eternal throne,\n\nAnd claim the crown, through Christ my own.\n\n2. What Wondrous Love Is This\n\nReminiscent of “And Can It Be,” “What Wondrous Love Is This” is full of awe and fascination at God’s great love for us. Almost deceptive in its simplicity, this hymn packs a brawny punch. The cadence is slow and deliberate, creating a meditative and devotional atmosphere. It also makes it a beautiful and peaceful song. (Check out our other article with other amazing worship songs about peace.)\n\nThe song first showed up in hymnals in 1811 during the Second Great Awakening. What we’re tempted to see now as a staid song of antiquity was, in its day, a potent camp song sung by teens all over the South.\n\nWhat wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul!\n\nWhat wondrous love is this, O my soul!\n\nWhat wondrous love is this\n\nThat caused the Lord of bliss\n\nTo bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul,\n\nTo bear the dreadful curse for my soul!\n\nWhen I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down,\n\nWhen I was sinking down, sinking down,\n\nWhen I was sinking down\n\nBeneath God’s righteous frown,\n\nChrist laid aside His crown for my soul for my soul,\n\nChrist laid aside His crown for my soul.\n\nTo God and to the Lamb I will sing, I will sing;\n\nTo God and to the Lamb I will sing;\n\nTo God and to the Lamb,\n\nWho is the great I AM,\n\nWhile millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing,\n\nWhile millions join the theme, I will sing.\n\nAnd when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on;\n\nAnd when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on.\n\nAnd when from death I’m free\n\nI’ll sing His love for me,\n\nAnd through eternity I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on,\n\nAnd through eternity I’ll sing on.\n\n3. How Deep the Father’s Love for Us by Stuart Townend\n\nStuart Townend is a modern hymn writer. His songs are deep, complex, and thought-provoking. Like “In Christ Alone,” “How Deep the Father’s Love for Us” became a huge anthem for the church when it was released in 1995.\n\nTo read the lyrics, “How Deep the Father’s Love for Us” seems more like a simple expression of our faith, and Townsend wanted it that way. In a discussion with Crosswalk about emotionalism in worship, he said, “The danger now is that we are so focused on the experience our worship can become self-seeking and self-serving. When all of our songs are about how we feel and what we need, we’re missing the point. There is a wonderful, omnipotent God who deserves our highest praise, and how we feel about it is in many ways irrelevant! I want to encourage the expression of joy, passion, and adoration, but I want those things to be the by-product of focusing on God—I don’t want them to become the subject matter.”\n\nThe irony is that when these simple lyrics are united with this song’s melody, it becomes an emotional experience.\n\nHow deep the Father’s love for us,\n\nHow vast beyond all measure,\n\nThat He should give His only Son\n\nTo make a wretch His treasure.\n\nHow great the pain of searing loss –\n\nThe Father turns His face away,\n\nAs wounds which mar the Chosen One\n\nBring many sons to glory.\n\n4. Glorious Day (Living He Loved Me) by Casting Crowns\n\nThe beauty of “Glorious Day” is that it’s the gospel in a song. One listen to this Casting Crowns song and you have a working understanding of the gospel message. As the verses express the story of Jesus to us, the chorus breaks into glorious recognition of God’s love for us.\n\nOne day when heaven was filled with His praises\n\nOne day when sin was as black as could be\n\nJesus came forth to be born of a virgin\n\nDwelt among men my example is He\n\nThe Word became flesh\n\nAnd the light shined among us\n\nHis glory revealed\n\nLiving He loved me dying He saved me\n\nBuried He carried my sins far away\n\nRising He justified freely forever\n\nOne day He’s coming\n\nO glorious day\n\nSongs of love to God\n\n5. I Love You Lord by Laurie Klein\n\nThis is a classic song from the late seventies that almost every church has in its repertoire. When Laurie wrote it, she was a new mother and wife struggling to get by. Her family was living in a mobile home as her husband attended school and she felt pretty isolated—a feeling compounded by not even having the money to make long-distance phone calls to friends or family.\n\nDepleted and empty one morning during her quiet time, she grabbed her guitar and said to the Lord, “Would you give me a song you would like to hear?” And “I Love You Lord” basically wrote itself.\n\nI love You Lord\n\nAnd I lift my voice\n\nTo worship You\n\nO my soul rejoice\n\nTake joy my King\n\nIn what You hear\n\nMay it be a sweet sweet sound\n\nIn Your ear\n\n6. Deep in Love with You by Michael W. Smith\n\nSome songs should be a simple expression of our love to our heavenly Father. “Deep in Love with You” feels like a song Martha’s sister, Mary would have sung at Jesus’s feet. It’s not pretentious or wordy, and that’s what makes it so incredibly profound.\n\nSitting at Your feet is where I want to be\n\nI’m home when I am here with You\n\nRuined by Your grace enamored by Your gaze\n\nI can’t resist the tenderness in You\n\n7. I Love You by Evan Wickham\n\nWickham is a worship leader in Portland, OR and a lover of deep responsive worship—and it’s apparent in this song. “I Love You” is cut from the same cloth as “Deep in Love.” It’s a potent song for a congregation that has been ushered into the presence of God and is caught up in adoration of their savior.\n\nJesus Christ You are life\n\nThe breath in me\n\nOnly You deserve my praise\n\nFor eternity\n\nI love you\n\nI love you\n\nSongs about our love for each other\n\nSongs about love between Christians\n\n8. Kingdom by Kristian Stanfill\n\nThis song is both an anthem and a rallying cry. On one hand it’s a unifying proclamation of the church’s call to be people of God, and on the other hand it’s a reminder to the church of her mission to pour herself out for the world’s sake.\n\nStand up and heed heaven’s call\n\nComing to us one and all\n\nTo live love and give love\n\nTo those who don’t know of\n\nThe lavish and true love of God\n\nWe are the kingdom of God\n\nWe are an army of love\n\nWe carry truth to the world\n\nWe are the kingdom of God\n\n9. Hold Us Together by Matt Maher\n\nMatt Maher sums up “Hold Us Together” this way: “To love is to risk and be promised extraordinary highs and lows; it will help you soar through the highs, and carry you through the lows, so you can help carry your neighbor through.”\n\nInstead of being a song sung to God or about God, “Hold Us Together” is a reminder of how love transforms us individually and corporately. The lyrics don’t have a lot of the hyper-spiritual trappings of most worship songs, but it can be used effectively to remind a congregation that they belong to each other.\n\nAnd love will hold us together\n\nMake us a shelter to weather the storm\n\nAnd I’ll be my brother’s keeper\n\nSo the whole world would know that we’re not alone\n\n10. How Beautiful by Twila Paris\n\nIt’s crazy to think that you can be in the church your whole life and continue to grow in your understanding of the most basic Scriptural truths. This is where Paris found herself in her early thirties, and God began to reveal to her anew the importance of Christian unity.\n\nChrist’s goodness to us isn’t simply a gift to us, it’s an example for us. “How Beautiful” expresses well how the church should respond to God’s love by showing love to each other.\n\nHow beautiful the radiant Bride\n\nWho waits for her Groom with His light in her eyes\n\nHow beautiful when humble hearts give\n\nThe fruit of pure lives so that others may live\n\nHow beautiful the feet that bring\n\nThe sound of good news and the love of the King\n\nHow beautiful the hands that serve\n\nThe wine and the bread and the sons of the earth\n\nBONUS – Songs for Couples\n\nWhile this bonus list of songs are not worship songs to God, they do still display the kind of love in marriage that Christ has for His church. Check these songs out for inspiration as well!\n\nWarren Barfield – Love Is Not A Fight\n\nBrandon Heath – Love Never Fails\n\nDave Barnes – God Gave Me You\n\nMatthew West – The Day Before You\n\nSteven Curtis Chapman – You’ve Got Me\n\nWhat are your favorite worship songs about love?\n\n“We love and honor God for His grace and mercy.
