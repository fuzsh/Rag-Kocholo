        "text": "According to a report in The Sun, Justin Bieber is recording a religious concept album.\n\nThe pop star is said to be on the lookout for songs with a Christian message after reconnecting with his faith through the Pentecostal megachurch Hillsong Church.\n\n\"There are key themes of love and redemption in the tracks he has created so far,\" a source told the newspaper. \"It will certainly ­surprise some fans.\"\n\nThe inference seems to be that pop songs with a religious theme are automatically awful or, at least, don't fit in the charts. The devil, as they say, has all the best tunes.\n\nBut there are plenty of examples of mainstream artists turning their faith into great pop songs - from Stormzy's Blinded By Your Grace (\"Oh my God, what a God I serve\") to Bob Marley's One Love (\"Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right\").\n\nSo here are five other songs you might not realise had a theological theme.\n\n1) Lenny Kravitz - Are You Gonna Go My Way\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube . We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read and before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nOne of the most insistent riffs in rock is married to a lyric about a messianic figure recruiting disciples.\n\n\"I am the chosen, I am the one,\" sings Kravitz. \"But what I really want to know is/Are you going to go my way?\"\n\nThe song came to Kravitz in a flash of inspiration - he recalls scribbling the lyrics down on a brown paper bag - but it reflects his real-life faith.\n\nThe star has a tattoo on his back which reads \"My heart belongs to Jesus\", and he once called Christ \"the ultimate rock star\".\n\n2) Candi Staton - You Got The Love\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube . We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read and before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nDisco diva Candi Staton recorded You Got The Love in the 1980s after turning her back on secular music and devoting herself to the church.\n\nBizarrely, the song originally featured in a video about the world's fattest man and his endeavour to lose weight.\n\nIt only became famous when dance act The Source remixed it in 1991 - bringing lyrics like \"My saviour's love is real\" to raves up and down the country.\n\nThe song's success prompted Staton to reassess her career.\n\n\"It was such an inspirational song it allowed me to rethink,\" she told The Guardian. \"People in church used to tell me secular music was the devil's music - but I realised it wasn't.\"\n\n3) U2 - Until The End Of The World\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube . We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read and before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nThere's a strong spiritual theme running throughout U2's career - at one point, they even considered ditching the band to devote themselves to the church.\n\nSo many of their songs are based on biblical teachings that churches have started holding \"U2charists\" - communion services where the band's songs take the place of hymns.\n\nTheir most powerful song, narratively-speaking, is Until The End Of The World, which is sung from the perspective of Judas Iscariot in the Garden of Gethsemane.\n\nThe song takes place as he betrays Jesus - delivering a pre-arranged signal that identifies him to the Temple Guards, who arrest him, ultimately leading to the crucifixion.\n\n\"I kissed your lips and broke your heart,\" sings Bono/Judas. \"You, you were acting like it was the end of the world.\"\n\n4) The Byrds - Turn! Turn! Turn!\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube .

To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\n\"A time to be born, a time to die/A time to plant, a time to reap/A time to kill, a time to heal/A time to laugh, a time to weep.\"\n\nThe Byrds' 1965 hit is based, almost verbatim, on chapter three of the Book of Ecclesiastes, where King Solomon contemplates the meaning of life, God and eternity.\n\nIt was \"probably the only time a song was at number one on the charts right out of the Bible,\" guitarist Chris Hillman later told the US Library of Congress. \"I know Pete [Seeger, songwriter] made his half of the publishing. I don't know if King Solomon's heirs ever got a dime.\"\n\nHillman wasn't religious at the time of writing the song - in fact, he said the lyrics were almost \"tongue in cheek\" - but he converted to Christianity later in his life.\n\n5) Prince - Let's Go Crazy\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube .
