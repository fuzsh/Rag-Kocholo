        "text": "ENGL 210-62W is a writing intensive class.\n\nENGL 220-1WE is a writing intensive class.\n\nWhile the activist movement, Black Lives Matter, has garnered national attention since its inception in 2013, African-American literature has been concerned with asserting the value of black lives since the late 18th century. We will focus, in particular, on the ways that black writers (in the past and in the “now”) have attempted to assert their humanity, citizenship, and freedom in the U.S. for over two centuries. Some of the texts we will read are Harriet Jacobs' Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, James Baldwin’s The Fire Next Time, Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Between the World and Me, and Claudia Rankine’s Citizen. To complement our readings we will incorporate films, music, and visual art to demonstrate the multiple and diverse ways that black artistic culture has served as a means of political resistance, reflection and inspiration. Requirements for the course include one formal essay (7-10 pages-written in stages), weekly quizzes, and a mid-term.\n\nENGL 282-05W is a writing intensive class.\n\nENGL 283-09W is a writing intensive class.\n\nReligion and Literature (ENGL 287)\n\nCrosslisted with Women’s Studies, English 306 will focus on literature written by twentieth- and twenty-first- century women authors. This course is designed to help students gain knowledge of women’s writings and to understand the ways in which women novelists use fiction to challenge inherited cultural and literary assumptions; to show them the difference gender makes to the writing, reading, and interpretation of literature; and to help them become familiar with the application of feminist theory to works by women authors. In English 306, the Instructor will provide necessary background information on the works covered and will model how to perform close readings of literary texts as she guides students in the investigation of the structures and strategies of representative works of women-authored fiction. The Instructor will also place emphasis on the gender scripts and psychological dramas encoded in the works read in the course, paying special attention to the various ways the authors represent coming of age, coming to age, the female body, romantic love, mother- child relationships, and female friendships in their works. The authors covered will include Doris Lessing, Margaret Atwood, Jamaica Kincaid, Toni Morrison, and Nancy Mairs. There will be reading quizzes, papers, a midterm and a final exam.\n\nSection: 071 #4958\n\nInstructor: Wheatley, E.\n\n3.0 credit hours Lecture\n\nMWF 12:35 p.m. – 1:25 p.m., LSC\n\nENGL 383-12W is a writing intensive class.\n\nENGL 395-15W is a writing intensive class.\n\nENGL 397-16W is a writing intensive class."
