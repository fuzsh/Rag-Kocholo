        "text": "I saw the Jesus Revolution movie recently and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It’s a great account of the awakening among the hippies that ignited a movement that swept the country, shook the church and caught the attention of Time Magazine.\n\nDuring this very volatile time in our nation’s history, the headlines were dominated by the Vietnam War, Anti-war protests, civil unrest, racial tension, the dangers of LSD and heroine. There was a space race going on as The US worked to beat the Russians to the moon, while at the same time there were the assassinations of JFK, Bobby Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, JR.\n\nMeanwhile, God was busy turning Hippies into Jesus Freaks.\n\nSome of those hippies were musicians who began to write songs about their newfound faith. Many in the church didn’t quite know what to do with this “Jesus Music”. The marriage of Rock and Roll and Religion just didn’t sit right with the traditional church. In some ways, the church’s response to the Jesus Revolution wasn’t all that different than the reaction of the Jewish scribes and Pharisees to an upstart preacher and his band of ruffians, tax collectors and sinners.\n\nSo what’s my point?\n\nWell, in Acts Chapter 5, the Jewish High Priest and the Sanhedrin insisted that Peter and the others stop preaching Jesus. Peter basically said over my dead body and the Sanhedrin pretty much said that can be arranged.\n\nA Jewish teacher of the law named Gamaliel told the council to basically chill.\n\n38… I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. 39 But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.”\n\nAs we know, the teaching of Jesus did not fail. In fact the growth of the early church changed the political, economic and social climate of ancient world … much like it did during the Jesus Revolution.\n\nAs more of hippies began expressing their faith through music, a whole new genre of music was born. Artists like Larry Norman, Keith Green, Randy Stonehill, Love Song, 2nd Chapter of Acts, Petra, Sweet Comfort Band and others began to use this music to speak to their generation.\n\nTo speak to me.\n\nI wasn’t a part of the Jesus Revolution, I was barely in elementary school when Billy Graham gave his stamp of approval to the movement at Explo ’72 in Dallas. But a few years later, as a young believer, the music of these groups and others began to strengthen my faith. Many of the songs were full of scripture and I found myself learning scripture as I learned the songs. Then, hungry for more, I began reading the Bible more eagerly than I ever had before.\n\nMy love for the music eventually led me to this new thing called “Contemporary Christian Music Radio”.\n\nAnd here we are.\n\nI still love the music and I get to hear stories every day of the ways it continues to impact lives today.\n\nMusic has the ability to touch the soul and the Gospel has the power to save it.\n\nPut the two together and watch God move.\n\nDave Cruse"
