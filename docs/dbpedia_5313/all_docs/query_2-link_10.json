        "text": "In the last couple of months, coming across the insights of Dr. Matthew Gordley based on his book New Testament Christological Hymns has really changed what I think Christian music properly is. Gordley’s work shows that there are shared defining features of New Testament (NT) christological hymns and NT hymns more generally. This critical study of NT hymns resulted in a quite specific conception for me of what good quality religious music is according to NT standards. I applied this biblical standard to contemporary Christian music and the differences between them were noticeable.\n\nOne significant difference is that these NT hymns espoused New Testament Christology. Now it may seem not that noteworthy because it is pretty obvious. It is after all the title and subject matter of the book whose ideas I’m drawing on. Gordley himself takes if for granted because he presumes, as is the scholarly consensus, that these particular texts are christological statements and rather wades into the scholarly debate of whether they can be classified as hymns. What is broadly accepted in New Testament studies is that these are some of the most important, most profound and perhaps earliest christological statements that are known. NT hymns contain foundational, mainstream christological beliefs that characterized the early Jesus movement.\n\nThey believed Jesus was the Christ, that is the Jewish Messiah, a long anticipated end-time political and religious leader who would inaugurate a new era in which God’s promises in Israel’s scriptures are fulfilled. This definitively Jewish, eschatological and biblical understanding of what it means for Jesus to be the Christ is characteristic of NT christological hymns and NT Christology in general. Not only is he the prophesied Messiah, he is the exalted Messiah, which is the uniquely Christian claim present in all NT hymns that God himself demands Jesus to be worshipped alongside him. So these hymns do not simply make generic religious statement about Christ, they express the highly specific and distinctive Christology of the primitive church.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the primary feature of NT christological hymns that Gordley identified is that they are Christocentric in nature. This was such a mundane observation that when I initially read it I took it for granted. I found Gordley’s observations about the lyrical content of these hymns more interesting. However, the more I reflected on the shared lyrical themes of NT hymns I found that they supported the primary feature of being Christocentric. The common themes such as the central events of Christ’s existence, his praiseworthy acts and accomplishments, as well as him inaugurating a new era in which God’s promises are fulfilled all shone the spotlight brightly on Jesus. What made these hymns Christocentric is not that they simply talked about Jesus but he was at the very least the primary subject. He was truly, without any competition, the centre of their worship.\n\nNT hymns were keenly Christocentric and reflected distinctive NT Christology. If this was the standard for the early Church, at least in terms of lyrical content, then all Christian music should also possess those qualities. As I earlier indicated, when you assess mainstream contemporary Christian music by this criteria it comes out as substandard. Gordley’s observation that NT hymns shared the christological theme of Jesus fulfilling Israel’s scriptures was what alerted me to the fact they were not simply unlike, as I had previously thought, but they were substantially different from their contemporary counterparts. That and other key biblical christological themes and perspectives are almost absent from mainstream music. Where christological themes are present they are almost always detached from their biblical roots. These distinctive thematic features of NT hymns were designed to put the focus squarely on Jesus. With a few exceptions, this is simply not the case in contemporary music.\n\nIt may seem rather counter intuitive to say modern music is not Christocentric when Jesus is talked about all the time in today’s Christian songs. There are many popular songs where a notable chunk of the lyrics consists of repeating the name “Jesus.” As they say, the devil is in the details. What I mean becomes apparent when you take a careful look at the lyrical content.\n\nI have consistently defined “Christocentric” as Christ being the centre therefore a Christocentric song is a song where Christ is at the very least the main subject. No other issue should vie for central place. This is not the case with modern songs. It is Christ and how a person relates to him which are the primary focus, not Christ alone. So while I fully admit modern songs do talk a lot about Jesus and they do so sincerely with the best intentions, because of this split focus they are still not Christocentric. They are certainly not as Christocentric as NT christological hymns where he is unquestionably the singular focus.\n\nIn contemporary songs, Jesus (and/or God) shares centre stage with the internal or personal state of the worshipper, whether it is his emotions or his life ambitions. This subjective quality is not present in NT christological hymns. In the only instance where this does happen, that is the Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55), the worshiper was certainly not the primary focus and was in a unique position no one else will ever be in again. Other examples are Philippians 2:6-11 and John 1:1-18, which are well-known hymnic texts that scholars have identified and they too do not have a personal angle. So while as believers we may have deep convictions about them, it is nonetheless very hard to subjectively identify with any of the NT hymns.\n\nNow the opposite is true in modern songs where a person must identify with lyrics, either emotionally or circumstantially, for the song to be considered effective. The trade off with this as a prevailing ethos in how we make music is that Christ is no longer the focus because he must share centre stage with the personal concerns of the worship. In other words, our music stops being Christocentric and starts being egocentric. It is not in all our songs but there is certainly a self-indulgent bent in popular Christian music, especially when you compare it to NT hymns. I have noticed this in both the Ghanaian Christian music scene and internationally. Popular lyrical trends and tropes in our music today say more about us than Christ.\n\nIt was a sobering realisation that popular Christian music has missed the mark according to biblical standards. This is the stuff I grew up on and now the whole thing has become suspect. The relatively small contingent of songs that as recently as a few weeks ago I thought were spiritually wholesome as someone who was already very critical of lyrics I now found did not make the cut. I have become even more selective about what I consider high quality Christian music and on the contemporary scene the pickings are very slim. I do think we have to be more discriminating with the songs we sing. We should not simply go for songs that use a lot of religious or spiritual-sounding lyrics but are not theologically substantive. We have to become connoisseurs of fine lyrics in our songs. Singing is an essential aspect of the Christian experience because it is a part of our devotion to God so we need to maintain very high standards."
