        "text": "It’s hard to believe that these albums will be celebrating their fifth anniversary. Many projects on this list cemented artists’ placement in hip-hop while others had an unfortunate downfall in the coming years.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion is one of the artists on this list who has continued flourishing. That year, Megan Thee Stallion released her first commercial mixtape, Fever. However, she was already heating up on the internet with the release of her two prior mixtapes and her viral freestyles (if you know, you know).\n\n“Big Ole Freak,” which was released a year prior to Fever, was the rapper’s breakout hit and her first certified platinum record.\n\nSince then, Megan has been keeping busy in the studio and has released two full-length projects. Her debut album, Good News, arrived in 2020 with hits such as “Body,” “Girls in the Hood,” and “Savage Remix” featuring Beyoncé. The track was nominated for “Record of the Year,” and it took home the Grammy for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. Megan also snagged Best New Artist that year.\n\n“Writing this album, I treated it more like writing in my diary than actually trying to put together a song,” the rapper said on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “I just want to talk about how I really feel and get personal with my hotties.”\n\nWhat Is Megan Thee Stallion Doing Now?\n\nIn 2023, Megan released “Cobra,” where she addressed the loss of her parents, the 2020 shooting incident by Tory Lanez, and her ex-boyfriend Pardison Fontaine’s alleged cheating. She also was featured on Cardi B’s “Bongos,” and did a collab with Renée Rapp titled “Not My Fault” for the Mean Girls soundtrack.\n\nAs for 2024, she said that a new project is on the way which will be funded by herself since leaving her label.\n\n“This part of my album is very much so funded by Megan Thee Stallion because we’re trying to get off… Y’all know what’s the tea. But I have no label right now,” she explained on Instagram Live. “We’re doing everything funded straight out of Megan Thee Stallion’s pockets. So, the budget is coming from me. Motherf—ing Hot Girl Productions! The next s— y’all about to see is all straight from Megan Thee Stallion’s brain and Megan Thee Stallion’s wallet. We are in my pockets, hotties, so let’s do our big one.”\n\n“It’s really just me this go around until we sign to a new label. But I don’t want to sign to a new label right now because I just want to do it myself,” she shared.\n\nTake a look at these projects from 2019 that were so good that we still listen to them today:"
