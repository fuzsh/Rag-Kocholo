        "text": "Throughout 2,000 years of Christian history, there have been numerous controversies over style, lyrical content, and authority. Christians all over the world have enjoyed a variety of music under the “Christian” label. However, how many of us have taken the time to examine our music to determine its biblical authenticity? Probably not many.\n\nAny good examination must start with well-crafted criteria. Since I believe the Bible is true, I will use the Bible to develop a rubric for evaluation. I believe that,\n\n“all Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be [complete], equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16-17, emphasis mine) and,\n\n“the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, emphasis mine).\n\nBecause I believe these things, the Bible is my best source for analyzing Christian music.\n\nSong Criteria\n\nThere are two basic elements to a song: words and music. While some songs have only words (a cappella), and others have no words at all (instrumental), most have a combination of lyrics and instrumental accompaniment. However, this website is dedicated only to lyrical review outside of consideration to the artist’s theology, beliefs, or intent. The lyrics should stand or fall on their own merits.\n\nI use the Bible to examine lyrics using the following criteria based on a numeric scale. I will give all four sections a whole number rating ranging from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best. The final score will be rounded to the nearest 0.5 unless the final score is not a perfect 10 or 0. In those cases, I will score it 9.5 or 0.5, respectively. I use color-coding to visually see song ratings without reading the numbers. Red is 0 to 5.5. Purple is 6 to 7.5. Green is 8 to 10.\n\n1. What message does the song communicate?\n\nAll media communicates a message. Music is no exception. What kind of message do Christian artists send in their music? We must figure out the message to determine its biblical authenticity.\n\nWhile I understand that not all songs are Gospel-centered, those that touch on salvation ought to include it. I use John 3:16-21, Romans 5:9, and 1 Corinthians 15:3-5 to examine the most important elements: death for sins, salvation from God’s wrath to reconciliation, and Christ’s resurrection.\n\nSide Note: Per the repetition announcement, I will no longer score based on excessive repetition.\n\nWeight: 20%\n\n2. How much of the lyrics line up with Scripture?\n\nThis is the heart of the Berean test. Once we understand the message and its purpose, we can do as the Bereans did in Acts 17:11, who “received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so”. While I understand the context as the Gospel message from Paul, we can utilize this principle to examine lyrics for Biblical authenticity.\n\nThere is a difference between non-biblical lyrics and unbiblical lyrics. The former means that the content is not evaluable by Scripture. We must make a conscious decision based on other principles. The latter means that it is contrary to Scripture. If so, consider avoiding it.\n\nFinally, songs that do not clearly identify God/Jesus/Holy Spirit as the pronouns “You”, “I”, “He”, or others through explicit mention, attributes of God, or heavy use of Bible quotes may incur a 2 point penalty for assuming God. This assumes that the artist intended to mean God, offering the song a chance at a higher score when applying the Bible.\n\nOf all the categories, this one will receive the largest weight.\n\nNOTE: There are several references to Casper the friendly ghost throughout my reviews. This is meant to be a running joke that pokes fun at the “ooh”s, “aah”s, and similar filler in Christian music.\n\nWeight: 40%\n\n3. How would an outsider interpret the song?\n\nThis principle is based on 1 Thessalonians 5:22, which tells us to “abstain from every form of evil”, which includes the appearance of evil. While I do not wish to be overly legalistic and to allow freedom on such matters (see Romans 14), we must also avoid communicating the wrong message to those outside the camp of Christ.\n\nWhile each individual unbeliever is an individual and will have a unique interpretation, my opinion on this matter (unless stated otherwise) is about the average non-christian with little to no knowledge about Christianity. The score will also reflect personal benefit and helping them/hindering them from considering Jesus.\n\nWeight: 20%\n\n4. What does this song glorify?\n\nThere are only two options: Either it glorifies God or it does not. To the degree that it glorifies God will determine its grade.\n\nWhen I say “glorifies God”, I am not suggesting that God cannot use a low-rated song to glorify Himself. God can use any song to draw attention to Himself, bringing Him glory. The score given is about the inherent glorification directly from the lyrics.\n\nWeight: 20%\n\nRecommendation for Corporate Worship\n\nMy recommendation for corporate worship takes the following into consideration:\n\nDoes this song proclaim to God His value and worth? Some songs are inspirational and call us to do/believe things, but aren’t focused on praising God.\n\nIs the musical style palatable to the ears of its listeners? Most people don’t want to worship with heavy metal, country, or rap/hip hop music.\n\nDoes the song contain theological errors? These are covered in my Berean Test reviews.\n\nIs the song clear? I don’t recommend songs with lyrics that a secular band could play without alteration, with their audience easily interpreting it as a human lover. This is easily rectified with a proper noun (God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Christ, etc.) or an attribute/act that only applies to God (omniscience, the cross, empty tomb, parting the red sea, etc).\n\nI’ve included a “maybe” rating to cover songs that might be used in church service under certain conditions. For example, a few word changes, appropriate for non-seeker sensitive church, etc. Also, if you believe that corporately worshipping with an artist’s song endorses said artist’s questionable theology, then I recommend avoiding it. Finally, a rating of “other” represents songs that are not recommended or appropriate for corporate worship, but could still be useful during a church service.\n\nFinally, bear in mind that recommendations that contain song lyric changes likely require permission from the copyright holder(s). While I don’t suspect modified lyrics for a church service will result in a lawsuit, I also don’t want to encourage people to break the law by altering copyrighted material.\n\nTheological Depth Rating\n\nEach song that is rated “8” or higher or has a corporate worship rating of “Perhaps” or “Yes” will receive a theological depth rating. Below are the criteria for the three categories: milk, meat, or mixed. Bear in mind that milk is not necessarily a “fail” or “bad” rating.\n\nMilk:\n\nFoundational Christian truths\n\nBasic list of God’s attributes\n\nBasic list of God’s laws/commandments\n\nSimple prayer\n\nSimple narrative\n\nMeat:\n\nDeep dive into foundational truths or advanced theology\n\nPlumbing the depths of a single topic\n\nElaborate explanation of God’s laws/commandments\n\nAdvanced prayer\n\nAdvanced narrative\n\nMixed:\n\nIntermixing of both milk and meat\n\nUnsure if the song is milk or meat\n\nFinal consideration: How do I respond when hearing this song?\n\nThis is highly subjective. Not all of us respond the same way to every song. We must all take stock of our own internal reactions and biases to Christian music. There are several things to consider when completing our own internal analysis in response to the songs we hear:\n\n1. What comes to mind when I listen?\n\n2. Do I dwell on my dark past?\n\n3. Does it cause me to run to God or to desire sin?\n\nEven if the song itself has a great message, noble intent, and is Biblically sound, it still may cause us to have dark thoughts, dwell on our sinful lifestyle, or increase our desire to sin. If so, “cut it off and throw it from you; for it is better for you…than for your whole body to go into hell.” (Matthew 5:29-30).\n\nA high score does not necessarily endorse the theology of said artist. For example, Hillsong is well-known for promoting the Word of Faith and New Apostolic Reformation movements, both of which are unbiblical in my view. They also received many high-scoring reviews, some of which are 10/10. We should all do our own due diligence to examine the theology of artists.\n\nOn the other hand, a low score does not necessarily mean that we should stop listening to a song. For example, a song may have high marks for its biblical accuracy, but a low score on outsider. This would be a great song to hear personally, but perhaps not one to share outside of Christian circles. Also, God can use anything, despite my own views and opinions on any song.\n\nFinally, this criterion is not set in stone. As I continue to review content and consider criticism, I reserve the right to tweak the criteria and re-evaluate songs under new criteria or after prayerful consideration of commentary.\n\nAgree? Disagree? Don’t be shy or have a cow! Calmly and politely state your case in a comment, below.\n\nUpdates:\n\n01/15/2023 – In section “Recommendation for Corporate Worship”, added an explanation for “other” category.\n\n10/20/2022 – Added a new section, Theological Depth Rating, that provides criteria for determining theological depth rating for songs that are “8” or higher, or songs rated for corporate worship as “perhaps” or “yes”. I also slightly increased the text size for headers and included a header for Song Criteria.\n\n09/09/2022 – Explained precisely why I add references to Casper the friendly ghost in my reviews.\n\n05/21/2022 – Added information to section “Recommendation for Corporate Worship” on altering copyrighted material.\n\n04/25/2022 – Moved commentary on corporate worship in “Final Considerations” to section “Recommendation for Corporate Worship”.\n\n02/07/2022 – Upon multiple inquiries, I included a section that contains criteria I consider when giving my “corporate worship” evaluation. I created a new section, “Recommendation for Corporate Worship”, to include this information.\n\n01/27/2022 – Moved scoring criteria right before section “1. What message does the song communicate?” and added that a higher score is better. I also added an explanation to the color-coding. Thanks to Karen Patrick for your question about scoring!\n\n01/23/2022 – Under “Final consideration”, updated fifth paragraph to clarify commentary on an artist’s questionable theology. Thanks to Lan for finding it! Also, I removed bolding in “updates” dates. This is consistent with other pages and reviews. Finally, I placed the italicized “agree/disagree” statement above “Updates”.\n\n11/10/2021 – Under “Final consideration”, I added a new sixth paragraph that explains why I recommend songs from artists with abhorrent theology with an alternative to those not wanting to support said artists.\n\n11/04/2021 – Updated sixth paragraph to make it clear that all reviews are based on lyrical examination based on its own merits.\n\n03/14/2021 – See repetition announcement.\n\n11/12/2019 – Placed “updates” section at the end of the page.\n\n06/01/2019 – Due to several comments about section 4 in my reviews, I expounded on my review process for this section. I also added additional text at the end to signify that all 4 sections receive a whole number rating ranging from 0 to 10.\n\n05/15/2019 – Expanded on section 3 to explain trends vs. individual unbelievers in terms of my evaluation.\n\n03/27/2019 – Added explicit statement at the end of the page to separate lyrical critique from artist theology (thank you commenter Noelle). I also changed the pronoun “we” to “I” given that I am the sole owner and writer for this website, except where I include you, my audience.\n\n03/08/2019 – Added language in section 2 regarding the usage of a 2 point penalty for authorial intent to invoke pronouns in the place of God without clear communication.\n\n02/07/2019 – Though excessive repetition is part of my reviews, I never explicitly stated it here. I also clarified the message section regarding grading Gospel-centric songs (thank you commenter Sage).\n\n04/11/2018 – Scores now include a weighted distribution. All previous posts will be readjusted under this new system as time allows."
