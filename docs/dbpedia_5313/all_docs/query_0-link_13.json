        "text": "April 2020 is a holy month for the faithful. Christians rejoice in the resurrection of Jesus; Muslims celebrate the revelation of the Qu’Ran; Jews commemorate the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery and Buddhists celebrate Buddha’s birthday. Each religious tradition contains some form of hardship and sacrifice, followed by great enlightenment and joy.\n\nWhat if Covid-19 is the modern-day hardship being imposed upon us by a loving God trying to catch our attention in our very loud secular world? Rather than send a person or book to shake things up, perhaps God sent this pandemic to send us a message.\n\nIt’s hard to know exactly what that message is. Perhaps because we are in the throes of it all. I imagine this is exactly how Mary and the apostles felt the weekend before Easter. Having dedicated their lives to the idea that Jesus is the son of God, I suspect they were dumbfounded, as they witnessed him being mocked and brutalized as he was nailed to a cross. As they waited for a miracle to stop the madness, much as we are today, how must have they felt as the skies grew dark and Jesus took his last breath. Saddened and disappointed I imagine them turning to each other and saying, “WTF?”\n\nI am curious how they spent the rest of the weekend. Did they spiral into depression and crawl under the covers? Did they run out and buy toilet paper? Did they drink in excess or eat the biblical equivalent of a pint of ice cream to numb their feelings? Whatever they did, I imagine it was a terrible weekend. Yet by Sunday, the purpose of all that pain was revealed.\n\nYou don’t have to be Christian to glean a life lesson from that story. Oftentimes, our faith gets rattled by the brutality of the world. Right now we are collectively experiencing our own, 'WTF?' moment. Even though we can’t understand the why behind life’s events, if we can accept that there is always a purpose, we can find our way through the pain and discomfort of the moment. It may not happen on our timetable, but ultimately we will be enlightened and joyful.\n\nWouldn’t it be great if during this holy month we witnessed a miraculous flattening of the curve or a cure for this virus? Perhaps then the president’s wish that “you’ll have packed churches (and synagogues and mosques and temples) all over the country” will come true.\n\nMaybe not on my timetable…but someday."
