Here is a compiled list of songs that are centered around the cross. Find more Easter-themed songs and hymns here.\n\nWhen we sing about God's grace and we believe the truth deep in our hearts, it affects our lives. We live with more compassion. We extend more mercy. We feel more empathy. This is why worship songs about grace and mercy are so important to the church. Every day and every week, through song and word, we must remind ourselves about the nature of God who is full of grace. What we receive from God, we extend to others. This is the full cycle of worship.\n\nFor every season cast with fear, God reminds us that His faithfulness walks beside us, within us, and before our doubt. Out of the ashes rises a peace meant for each and every weary soul, established by the confidence of His steady hand. Fear does not debilitate us, instead, it is the catalyst to move God's people forward in their faith. Here is a list of songs meant to soak in the places where fear takes hold of your life. Download chord charts, piano sheets, lyrics, vocal sheets, choral arrangements, orchestrations, multitracks on the theme of fear.\n\nâ€œTrust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.&rdquo; Proverbs 3:5-6. If the future feels uncertain right now, and worry keeps occupying too much room in your heart, in your mind, remember this: God is already in all of our tomorrows. He knows our way, and He has a plan. And we can be assured it's always the best one for us. God never asks us to figure it all out on our own. He just asks us to trust Him, to recognize His leadership and Sovereignty in our lives. And He promises to make our pathways straight.
