        "text": "Contemporary Christian music (CCM) emerged in America during the late 1960s and early 1970s, creating a niche genre outside the mainstream music industry. Since then, CCM has become the umbrella for any genre of modern music with lyrics that express the tenets of the Christian faith or draw inspiration from biblical themes.\n\nHow Did Contemporary Christian Music Begin?\n\nIn the late 1960s, God began a powerful move among young people to awaken their hearts to Christ. This wave of revival, labeled in history as the Jesus Movement and described in movies like Jesus Revolution, sparked an unquenchable fire in the hearts of young music artists. Using their music as a platform to evangelize, these shaggy-haired singers, songwriters, and musicians infiltrated the mainstream music industry with the message of the Gospel.\n\nBefore that era, most American churches and most major record labels maintained strict boundaries between sacred (or “gospel music”) and popular music. Some musicians, like Johnny Cash, worked across those boundaries and produced work that appealed to both audiences, but the camps tended to work in separate spheres. But in 1969, Larry Norman, a young rising rock star whose band had opened for Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, and Janis Joplin, dared to challenge the great divide.\n\nOther pop and country music artists had dabbled with evangelistic messages in their songs. Before starting his solo career, Norman belonged to the rock band People!, which released the album We Need a Whole Lot More of Jesus and a Lot Less Rock and Roll. After conflicts with his bandmates (and Capitol Records refusing to let People! feature a picture of Christ on their new album cover), Norman was fired from the band. Eventually, he quit Capitol Records to “embark on a solo career” so that he could freely express his convictions.\n\nNorman’s first evangelistic-themed rock album, Upon This Rock, was released in 1969, just as the first swells of the Jesus Movement swept across America’s West Coast. Three years later, his landmark album, Only Visiting This Planet, dropped at the peak of the revival. As his songs spread like wildfire among the hundreds of thousands of young people hungry for more of Jesus, other Christian artists followed Norman’s bold lead, and Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) was officially on its way.\n\nWhy Should The Devil Have All The Good Music by Larry Norman from ragamuffin1 on GodTube.\n\nAt its inception, CCM embodied revival’s spiritual fervor. Lyrics conveyed unapologetic warnings about sin, revealed deep biblical truths, and pointed the way to Jesus. Many songs also took a stand against social and political injustices of the day. At the heart of the music was a rare authenticity that garnered mass appeal.\n\nBut not everyone appreciated the new hybrid genre, which wrapped sacred themes into folksy, upbeat, or rock-style music. Many conservative churches branded the songs “devil music,” while many record stores refused to sell the albums, fearing that the religious content might offend loyal customers.\n\nCCM’s origin story is long and complex, with hundreds of active participants. For every big-named artist or band you might recognize, dozens of others played roles just as integral—yet struggled to fit into CCM’s evolving mold.\n\nTrailblazers like Ralph Carmichael, Randy Stonehill, Keith Green, Phil Keaggy, Andrae Crouch, Michael Card, and Barry McGuire are revered today by their successors and remembered for their contributions.\n\nMeanwhile, Christians who contributed but didn’t quite fit into the genre, like Sam Phillips, Mark Heard, Michael Been, and T Bone Burnett, are finally getting recognized as modern artists find inspiration from their work and lives.\n\nBy the 1980s, the humble origins of CCM had all but disappeared, along with the final ripples of the Jesus Movement, and the billion-dollar Christian music industry was born.\n\nHow Did Contemporary Christian Music Facilitate the Modern Worship Movement?\n\nMany evangelical churches cautioned their congregations to remain wary of CCM when it first hit the airwaves and record stores in the late 60s. They were concerned that “worldly music” had adulterated the faith’s sacred truths. But few were concerned that the world’s popular music might breach their sanctuary doors. And rightfully so. Most mainstream CCM artists crafted their songs as evangelistic tools to take the Gospel to the world, not to the church.\n\nAt that time, most of these churches practiced corporate musical worship by singing hymns accompanied by piano or organ music. But by the early 70s, some churches began pondering CCM’s positive impact on youth culture and wondered if they might be able to draw some of those young people into the church by altering their style of musical worship.\n\nChurch Smith led the way at his small Pentecostal church in California, where the Jesus Movement began. As Jesus hippie Lonnie Frisbee’s ministry brought a new crowd of “Jesus People” to the church, Smith’s congregation put away the hymnals and selected a group of young guitarists and songwriters to lead worship sessions before services. The new worship team composed and performed simple folksy choruses full of biblical truth that spoke to their peers in their language. Soon, other worship teams formed, until there were over 15 rotating groups.\n\nWhen one of the worship leaders, Karen Lafferty, wrote and performed a song titled “Seek Ye First,” based on Matthew 6:33, congregation members began singing the catchy tune everywhere they went until it finally spread to several other nearby evangelical churches.\n\nMaranatha Singers: Seek Ye First The Kingdom Of God and more from graceandglory3 on GodTube.\n\nIn 1971 Chuck Smith personally financed the production of Calvary Chapel’s first album. The record’s overwhelming success led to subsequent albums and provided the means and opportunity for Chuck to create the Christian music label Maranatha! Music Inc., also distributed sheet music and songbooks to churches across North America to help them form worship teams of their own.\n\nBy the late 1970s, other music publishers joined Maranatha! in the campaign to equip churches for the new style of worship; some even provided training workshops to facilitate the transition further. Today at the click of a button, Lifeway Worship offers a catalog of over 3,000 songs, and Christian Copyright Licensing International (CCLI) offers over 300,000 songs to aid worship leaders worldwide.\n\nIn the 1980s, as worship music became more common in Evangelical churches, mainstream contemporary Christian artists got on the bandwagon and began composing songs for corporate worship. Soon Praise and Worship music became a subgenre of CCM. Today over half the evangelical churches in the U.S. use some amount of CCM in their weekly worship services.\n\nHow Did Contemporary Christian Music Change After the Jesus Movement?\n\nIn CCM’s early days, many Christian artists were independently produced, which made distribution difficult and made earning a living with their music next to impossible. But they continued their craft as a calling, motivated by the desire to take the message of Jesus to the world. As the Jesus Movement faded into the backdrop of the early 1980s, the mainstream music industry began to recognize the sales potential of Christian music, and more opportunities emerged for artists to break into the industry.\n\nThe industrialization of CCM was a blessing and a curse. While it opened doors for contemporary Christian music to reach a broader audience, it also necessitated marketing formulas to ensure the retention of that audience. Many artists who had found their faith and their voice during the Jesus Movement no longer fit into the branding confines of the new and improved CCM.\n\nIn 1988, Leslie Phillips, one of CCM’s bestselling female artists before the change, left her label and rebranded herself as Sam Phillips to continue creating her spiritually raw and practically honest music. She and others like Rich Mullins became disenfranchised with the music industry as “audiences became less patient with music asking questions or critiquing hypocrisy.”\n\nWhile some Christian artists retreated from CCM’s limelight during this season of change, others like Amy Grant, Sandy Patti, and Michael W. Smith found their stride, amassed huge audiences, and made names for themselves in the Christian music world that have stood the test of time.\n\n10 of Today’s Top Contemporary Christian Music Artists\n\n1. Casting Crowns: Crosswalk contributor Laura Harris explains lead vocalist Mark Hall started this seven-member band.
