New Heaven and New Earth; IPA: [ɕintɕʰʌndʑi]), is a new religious movement established in South Korea by Lee Man-hee. It is considered a pseudoreligion or cult by mainstream churches.[5][6]\n\nShincheonji's teaching claims that their founder, Lee, is the pastor promised in the New Testament,[6] and that the Book of Revelation is written in secret metaphors (parables), which only Lee is capable of deciphering.[5] Before founding his own religious movement, Lee was a member of a controversial group called the Olive Tree, a new religious movement which spawned the first countercult movement in post-war Korea,[7] although this connection is not present in Shincheonji's biography of Lee.[8]\n\nShincheonji teaches that it is the true faith with its members receiving salvation at the time of final judgment. Everyone not in the group will be denied forgiveness and destroyed.[9]\n\nIn 2020, the group became the center of intense scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. The outbreak of COVID-19 cases in Korea was initially centered in the city of Daegu after a 61-year-old Shincheonji member known as Patient 31 infected other church members causing the pandemic to surge in Daegu. As the disease spread among Shincheonji's members and thousands of others, there was a national outcry against the group and by 22 February 2020, over 1.3 million South Korean citizens signed an online petition to the Blue House requesting the government to disband Shincheonji entirely.[10] On 12 August 2022, the Supreme Court in South Korea upheld the acquittal of Lee Man Hee on charges that he obstructed the government’s response to COVID-19 outbreaks in 2020.[11]\n\nDoctrine\n\n[edit]\n\nThe group is apocalyptic[9] and messianic in character,[12] and has been described as a doomsday cult.[12]\n\nThe group's founder and leader is variously referred to by church followers as \"Chairman Lee(이 총회장)\"; \"the chairman(회장)\"; \"the promised pastor(약속의 목자)\"; \"the one who overcomes(이긴자)\"; or \"the advocate(대언자).\"[9] Adherents believe that Lee is the messenger sent by Jesus Christ,[13] and believe him to be uniquely able to interpret the Book of Revelation.[5] The group believes that in the times of the fulfillment of the New Testament prophecies, 144,000 adherents and a great multitude in white that no one can count, which comes out of the great tribulation,[14] will enjoy salvation and eternal life[15] as promised in the book of Revelation.(Revelation 7)\n\nThe group is known for its aggressive, and deceptive proselytizing practices. With a poor image in mainstream South Korean society, Shincheonji leaders have at times instructed their members to lie about being adherents of the group, although the group has said that doing so is not its official policy.[16] In 2022, the court ruled that the so-called 'Shincheonji Deceptive Evangelism', where members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus secretly teach their doctrines while hiding their affiliation, is illegal.[17] The group is regarded as heretical by mainstream Christian denominations.[16]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nLee Man-hee was born in 1931. In 1967, Lee became a member of the Tabernacle Temple[8] which, under pressure from the \"religious purification policy\" of Chun Doo-hwan (coup in 1980), became affiliated with the Presbyterian Church. Lee left the Tabernacle Temple in 1971.[8]\n\nSome have connected Lee to a countercult movement called Olive Tree,[7] but this connection is not present in Shincheonji's biography of Lee.[8]\n\nOn 14 March 1984, Lee founded Shincheonji and opened its first temple that June in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province. Membership grew and in June 1990, the Zion Christian Mission Center was established in Seoul. In 1995, the membership within South Korea was divided into 12 \"tribes\", according to geographic territories. In 1999, the headquarters were moved to Gwacheon, which has a prophetic meaning within Shincheonji theology. Mainline Christian churches became alarmed at the loss of members, and the first cases of deprogramming Shincheonji members began in 2002. The clash between the Chonnam National University Christian Student Union and Shincheonji at that time marked the starting point for the organized response against Shincheonji.[18]\n\nOrganization and Structure\n\n[edit]\n\nThe organization of Shincheonji was created on Earth as an exact replica of the heavenly spiritual organization shown in Revelation 4, just as Moses built the Tabernacle according to the vision shown by God and Jesus acted according to what He saw God doing at the first coming. The structure and organization of Shincheonji consist of 24 departments overseeing the administration of Shincheonji, centered around the chairman, who is considered the promised pastor of the New Testament. Additionally, there are seven educational directors responsible for education and twelve tribe leaders, named after the twelve disciples of Jesus, who form the foundation of the kingdom of heaven. The twelve tribes, led by these tribe leaders, each consist of smaller churches.[19][20]\n\nThe Twelve Tribes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe names of the twelve tribes are taken from the names of Jesus' twelve disciples.[21]\n\nSeoul James: Northern Seoul, northeastern Gyeonggi Province (Yeoncheon County, Dongducheon City, Uijeongbu City, Pocheon City, Gapyeong County, Namyangju City, Guri City, Gwacheon City)[21]\n\nJohn: Southern Seoul, southern Gyeonggi Province[21]\n\nBartholomew: Western Seoul, western Gyeonggi Province[21]\n\nMatthew: Incheon Metropolitan City[21]\n\nSimon: Northern Seoul, northwestern Gyeonggi Province (Paju City, Goyang City)[21]\n\nPhilip: Gangwon Province, parts of North Chungcheong Province[21]\n\nMatthias: North Chungcheong Province, South Chungcheong Province, Daejeon Metropolitan City, Sejong Special Autonomous City[21]\n\nThaddaeus: North Gyeongsang Province, Daegu Metropolitan City[21]\n\nAndrew: South Gyeongsang Province (excluding Miryang City, Namhae County, Goseong County, Changwon City, Geoje City), Busan Metropolitan City (excluding Gangseo District), Ulsan Metropolitan City, Jeju Island[21]\n\nBusan James: Gangseo District in Busan Metropolitan City, South Gyeongsang Province (Miryang City, Namhae County, Goseong County, Changwon City, Geoje City, Gimhae City)[21]\n\nThomas: North Jeolla Province[21]\n\nPeter: South Jeolla Province, Gwangju Metropolitan City[21]\n\nSeasons and Festivals\n\n[edit]\n\nShincheonji has four official seasons throughout the year. Excluding the anniversary of its founding, these seasons are related to the events of the Exodus in the Old Testament, and they are typically observed on the exact dates as originally recorded.[22]\n\nFounding Anniversary (March 14th every year)\n\n[edit]\n\nThis day commemorates the date, March 14th, when Lee Man-hee, the leader, founded Shincheonji.[23]\n\nPassover (January 14th every year)\n\n[edit]\n\nPassover is observed on January 14th, as recorded in the Old Testament. The origin of Passover lies in the time of Moses when God judged Egypt with ten plagues through Moses and delivered the Israelites, who were enslaved in Egypt, through the blood and flesh of a lamb. This event is commemorated as Passover (Exodus 12:1-14, Leviticus 23:5). However, the Passover observed by Shincheonji today is not a commemoration of the events in Moses' time but is based on the promise made by Jesus 2,000 years ago (Luke 22:14-20, Matthew 26:17-29). It is a festival of thanksgiving to God for guiding them through the revealed Word (the blood and flesh of Jesus) and for leading them out of spiritual Babylon (death) to spiritual Zion (God's kingdom, Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony), which is the path to life (Revelation 17:14, Revelation 18:4, Revelation 16:12).[24]\n\nFeast of Tabernacles (July 15th every year)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe origin of the Feast of Tabernacles is found in God's command to Moses that the Israelites should dwell in booths to remember their journey out of Egypt (Leviticus 23:33-44). In Moses' time, the Israelites who came out of Egypt lived in physical booths made of grass. Today, however, people are metaphorically referred to as grass (1 Peter 1:24), and the Feast of Tabernacles is observed by the members of Shincheonji who have come out of spiritual Babylon (the world without truth) into the truth of Shincheonji. These members themselves become spiritual booths (i.e., homes) where the Holy Spirit dwells, and they offer thanksgiving to God (Isaiah 40:6-7, 1 Corinthians 3:16).[25]\n\nFeast of Ingathering (September 24th every year)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe origin of the Feast of Ingathering goes back to the time when the Israelites, after leaving Egypt under Moses' leadership, settled in the land of Canaan. During the physical harvest, they would gather their crops and store them in barns, offering thanks to God (Exodus 23:14-17). Today, however, the Feast of Ingathering is observed during the spiritual harvest. It is not merely a legalistic festival from the time of Moses but is celebrated in accordance with the promise of the New Testament. It is a festival of thanksgiving for being harvested and gathered into God's kingdom, the barn (Mount Zion, Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony). The Feast of Ingathering is commemorated on September 24th, the day when the foundation of God's temple was laid, as recorded in Haggai 2.[26]\n\nMembership\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2014, it was estimated to have over 120,000 members,[27] while a 2020 estimate put membership at around 200,000.[28] It was once the fastest-growing religious church in South Korea.[29]\n\nIn March 2020, health authorities of the Government of South Korea investigating the COVID-19 pandemic officially declared to the press that they obtained an exact list of 317,320 registered Shincheonji members.[30][31]\n\nOpposition\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Singapore, 21 members were arrested for congregating together and were charged with being a part of an \"unlawful society.\" They face up to 3 years in jail if convicted.[32]\n\nIn 2020, China banned Shincheonji church.[33]\n\nThreats towards Shincheonji\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 4 April 2020, a 39-year-old man threw a rock at the Ulsan branch church, breaking a glass window at the front entrance of the church building. His stated motivation was his thought that COVID-19 spread because of Shincheonji members. On 26 August 2020, he was found guilty of property damage and was sentenced to 6 months in prison with 2 years suspension of sentence and 80 hours of mandated volunteer work.[34]\n\nOn 21 September 2020, a Shincheonji branch church in Daejeon, South Korea, received an anonymous threat letter containing white powder later identified by the Chemical Safety Agency and the Geumgang Basin Environment Agency to be cyanide, a USB containing a Bitcoin address and a message demanding 14.4 billion won. The anonymous message stated that harm would come upon Shincheonji congregants if the requested 14.4 billion won was not deposited.[35] The case is still under investigation. Police investigation has ruled that the threatening letter was originally addressed to a different Shincheonji location in Gyeonggi-do.[36]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nPolitical controversy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe group has been accused of exerting influence on politicians and political parties. A former member accused Chairman Lee of Shincheonji of having created the former name of the Liberty Korea Party. Until 2017, the Liberty Korea Party was named \"Saenuri Party\". On 6 November 2020, the prosecutor's office ruled that there was no evidence to support this accusation and that there was no connection between Lee and the creation of the Saenuri Party.[37]\n\nAccusations against the church\n\n[edit]\n\nThe members of Shincheonji have been accused of actively infiltrating other churches to convert other churches' members.\n\nSouth Korea – Its members have been reportedly sighted in Myeongdong Cathedral, allegedly pretending to be pious believers seeking to lure other Koreans or foreigners into their own religious meetings.[38]\n\nAustralia – Members of the church have targeted public areas and universities frequented by international students in Sydney[39] and Melbourne.[40] They have started operating in Perth, Western Australia, in 2022 and perhaps earlier.\n\nColombia – Its members have been reportedly sighted in Basílica Menor Nuestra Señora de Lourdes, in Bogotá, claiming to know the truth from biblical studies and the apocalypse prophecy.[41]\n\nIndia – In August 2019, the Baptist Convention in Manipur, India, warned worshippers to be wary of Shincheonji. \"Their leader Lee Man-Hee claims to have access to secret knowledge of scriptures that other church pastors do not know. Moreover, he claims that one can truly know God only by following and listening to the teachings of Shincheonji. Once they are into this group, they spend most of their time inviting people to join Shincheonji group and spend less time with their families, friends and churches and neglect and quit their studies or work.\"[42]\n\nNew Zealand – In April 2017, several local Korean churches in Auckland including the New Zealand Korean Churches Association and the Immanuel Korean Church warned their congregations that the Shincheonji was seeking to recruit members through their Bible classes, encourage members to cut family ties, and sending \"harvesters\" to infiltrate and take over other churches.[43] In April 2019, several churches in Wellington including The Street Church and Blueprint Church raised concerns about the Shincheonji's methods in recruiting members from their congregations. The historian Peter Lineham also described the group's recruitment techniques as \"dangerous\" and \"deceptive.\"[44] In September 2022, Shincheonji's Auckland church hosted a visit by The New Zealand Herald journalist Lincoln Tan and historian Lineham in an effort to improve the church's public image.[45] In November 2022, several former members alleged that the church isolated members from their families and friends, and pressured its members to proselytise. A Shincheonji spokesperson denied the group was a cult and claimed the church was misunderstood.[46]\n\nPacific Islands - In 2013, Shincheongji established an outreach in Fiji under the name \"Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light.\" By late April 2023, the Shincheonji church's New Zealand branch had launched outreach programmes in the Cook Islands and Samoa. These included appearing as guests on radio station PMN Cook Islands' \"Godly Hour\" programme and establishing a church in Samoa called \"Zion Christian Mission Centre.\"[47]\n\nSingapore - In late February 2020, Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam announced that the Ministry of Home Affairs would be investigating the local Shincheonji chapter for fraudulent activities including creating front companies and using deceptive methods to recruit young people into their sect.[48][49][50]\n\nUnited Kingdom – In November 2016, the Church of England issued a formal alert to around 500 parishes in London about the activities of a Shincheonji affiliate known as Parachristo. Parachristo, a registered charity in the UK, runs Bible study courses in London Docklands and was using these courses to recruit members of the Church of England.[51] \"Those who become involved [in Shincheonji] gradually withdraw from friends and family and actively lie about their real lives.\"[51] Further warnings were issued by Nicky Gumbel, vicar of Holy Trinity Brompton, and John Peters, rector of St Mary's Church, London.\n\nAssociation with the coronavirus outbreak\n\n[edit]\n\nShincheonji became involved in controversy during the COVID-19 pandemic, an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections followed from the participation of a SARS-CoV-2 infected person, \"Patient 31\", at the organization.[52][53] A dozen Chinese members of the church from Wuhan were also connected to the Daegu Shincheonji outbreak.[54][55]\n\nIn Busan, a 61-year-old Daegu resident is believed to have spread the virus and was diagnosed on 18 February 2020.[56] At the time, the South Korean government had neither introduced social distancing nor restricted travel from China (apart from travel from the Hubei province).[57]\n\nOn 18 February 2020, Shincheonji issued a church-wide announcement of Patient 31's confirmation and closed down its churches and affiliated buildings.[58]\n\nOn 20 February 2020, Shincheonji's Daegu branch submitted a list of its members to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to aid with contract-tracing.[59]\n\nBy 20 February 2020, 53 new cases were Shincheonji attendees or their families,[60] reaching over 300 by 23 February, over half of all cases in South Korea in February.[61] The subsequent resurgences of the virus in September 2020 and December 2020, however, surpassed the numbers seen during the outbreak associated with Shincheonji and have accelerated at a faster rate than the spread associated with Shincheonji's Daegu branch church.[62]\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 24 February 2020, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency requested a list of all Shincheonji congregants. The list included congregants’ name, citizen registration number, address, name of place of employment, and family member information. A day after, Shincheonji submitted the list of all congregants and complied with the government's request. [63]\n\nThere was no deadline listed in the official information request letter sent to Shincheonji for epidemiological investigation. The official request also did not ask for members’ citizen registration numbers. Despite this, officials from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency requested members’ citizen registration numbers to be included in the data.[64]\n\nThere was a day's delay in submitting information, however, as Shincheonji officials asked the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency about the legality of providing congregants’ citizen registration numbers and if the government will protect the congregants’ private information.[64]\n\nOn 25 February 2020, Shincheonji officials provided the list of requested information for all of its congregants.[65]\n\nIn the October 2020 trial of Chairman Lee Man-Hee, where he is accused of not complying with epidemiological investigations, an official from the Korea Ministry of Health and Welfare acknowledged that Shincheonji officials made effort to provide the requested congregants’ information. The conversation records between Shincheonji officials and the Agency official show an expression of concern over privacy, not a refusal to provide information or a refusal to cooperate.[64]\n\nChairman Lee's counsel argued that the request for congregants’ citizen registration numbers had nothing to do with epidemiological investigation.[63]\n\nIn the initial discussion between representatives of Shincheonji and the Blue House, the Blue House official in charge of the case was made aware of Shincheonji's concerns for congregants’ safety and privacy, and the omission of information from certain congregants, such as minors and those at special risk for persecution, such as elected politicians or public officials.[66]\n\nThe police have determined that the intention for omitting certain congregants’ information was not for the purpose of obstructing disease prevention and control efforts, but to protect congregants of Shincheonji.[66]\n\nIn a recorded phone conversation, Chairman Lee told the Shincheonji representative in charge of communicating with the government to provide congregant information that “since the government is doing what Shincheonji should’ve done instead, we must actively help [the government].”[66]\n\nAlex Azar, United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, described South Korea's approach to COVID-19 as something that \"would likely not fly here in the United States\" and referred to the South Korean government's authoritarian crackdown on Shincheonji as he described how South Korea \"used their military and police powers to lock down that church, arrest everybody that was in contact with individuals in that church.\"[67]\n\nLegal battle\n\n[edit]\n\nWith an additional 4,000 cases of COVID-19 within two weeks, and roughly 60% of the total infections nationwide having stemmed from the church,[68] the Seoul city government asked prosecutors to press charges against the religious group's founder and senior members for murder, causing harm, and for violating the Infectious Disease and Control Act.[14] Interviews have occurred with all 230,000 members of the religious group and nearly 9,000 were said to be showing symptoms of the virus.[69]\n\nAfter a lawsuit was started by the Mayor of Seoul, on 25 February 2020, the Governor of Gyeonggi Province Lee Jae-myung, along with 40 officials, entered the Shincheonji headquarters office and seized about 50 computers after making a forcible entry into the headquarters.[70] The authorities checked the list seized during the raid with the one Shincheonji had supplied, and concluded that discrepancies were minor.[71] The Seoul City government filed legal complaints to state prosecutors against 12 leaders of the church, accusing the group of homicide, causing harm, and violating the Infectious Disease and Control Act.[72][73]\n\nAfter the outbreak amongst Shincheonji's Daegu branch church in February, 51 Shincheonji-related locations in Daegu have been closed. Out of this, 14 locations have been shut down since February of this year. Shincheonji has only held online services since February. However, its buildings continue to remain closed and Shincheonji has requested for the courts to reconsider the order for building closure. Shincheonji is requesting access to the buildings for the sake of building maintenance, not for usage of religious meetings or activities. The City of Daegu, however, has rejected the request, stating that building maintenance is currently not needed and that the public opinion against Shincheonji's Daegu Church still has not recovered. The courts have not yet ruled against or for the request. The situation could also be resolved upon an agreement between Shincheonji Daegu Church and the City of Daegu.[74]\n\nCriminal charges against group's leader\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 31 July 2020, Lee Man-Hee was arrested by South Korean authorities for allegedly hiding crucial information from contact-tracers and other offenses; by this time the Shincheonji Church was being linked to more than 5,200 coronavirus infections, or 36% of South Korea's total cases.[75] Prosecutors specifically alleged that Lee had failed to provide health authorities with a complete lists of church members in violation of South Korea's Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act.[76] The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (South Korea) has publicly stated that Shincheonji has cooperated with authorities.[77]\n\nLee was initially detained pending trial, and several previous appeals for bail were initially rejected.[78][79][80] However, on 12 November 2020, the court granted bail to Lee, with the court noting Lee's consistent attendance and compliance during court proceedings, as well as the health concerns of detaining a 90-year-old senior in prison.[81]\n\nProsecutors sought a five-year prison sentence and a fine of 3 million South Korean won (2,700 U.S. dollars) on the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act charges.[82][76] In January 2021, the Suwon District Court acquitted Lee of the COVID-19-related charges, ruling that lists of church members were not \"key elements of epidemiological surveys\" defined in the Act.[76] However, the court, found Lee guilty of embezzling 5.6 billion won (US$5.11 million) from the church to build a home, and of using government facilities to conduct religious services, and issued a four-year suspended sentence to Lee.[76]\n\nThe Supreme Court of Korea in 2022 affirmed the lower court's decisions: acquittal on COVID-19 charges and conviction for embezzlement.[83]\n\nShincheonji response\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a press conference in early March 2020, the church's founder Lee Man-Hee publicly kneeled and bowed his head to the ground in a traditional Korean gesture of apology, apologized for church members unintentionally spreading the virus, and said that the church was cooperating with the government.[84]\n\nIn response to the negative media attention on Shincheonji, Lee Man-hee spoke publicly about being misunderstood or falsely accused.[9] Shincheonji has been cited as the \"most vilified group during pandemic\".[57]\n\nOn 26 August 2020, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) thanked Shincheonji for 562 of its congregation members donating plasma for COVID-19 treatment research, and requested collaboration with Shincheonji to hold a large-scale plasma donation drive from 26 August 2020 to 4 September 2020. An additional 1,100 Shincheonji members are estimated to donate plasma in collaboration with the KCDC.[85]\n\nOn 16 September 2020, Shincheonji held an interfaith online prayer meeting titled “COVID-19 Overcome Online Prayer Meeting” to pray for the speedy end of COVID-19.[86]\n\nOn 26 September 2020, Shincheonji's volunteer association began a ‘prevention volunteering’ campaign, with Shincheonji members volunteering to sanitize shopping districts and passing out hand sanitizers and masks to local businesses.[87]\n\nOn 3 November 2020, the KCDC announced that starting from the 16th of November, there will be approximately 4,000 additional recovered COVID-19 patients from Shincheonji who will donate their plasma for the development of a treatment.[88]\n\nOver the course of 2 rounds of large-scale plasma donation drives with Shincheonji, a total of 2,798 members agreed to participate in the drive, and 2,030 successfully donated plasma. From the Daegu Church of Shincheonji, 1,700 congregation members donated plasma over the course of July and August of this year. The Director of the KCDC expressed his deep gratitude towards Shincheonji for actively participating in the plasma drive.[89]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]"
