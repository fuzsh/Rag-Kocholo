Or at least, this work draws our attention to the fact that premodern Jews did not always engage with the biblical tradition in the ways that we have come to expect religious practitioners to relate to a sacred canonical text.2 To encourage new work on this emerging trend, we established a colloquium series at the University of Michigan in January 2016, titled Beyond the Book: Rethinking Biblical Religion.3 This series has been soliciting works-in-progress that look at moments in early Jewish history in which the idea of the Bible was not an organizing category of knowledge for Jewish practitioners. The first semester of the series has focused on the problem of categories—asking what constituted a book in the ancient world, evaluating whether the Hebrew Bible fit this definition in the early period of Jewish history, and asking us to rethinking how biblical religions actually engage with the Biblical tradition. In coming semesters, we hope to move on to studying particular historical examples—looking more closely at the ways in which various late antique and medieval Jews have expressed lack of interest in the Bible as a text or engaged with the Biblical tradition in ways that differ from contemporary expectations about how religious practitioners will interact with their religious canon.\n\nIn both scholarly analysis and the popular imagination, premodern Jewry is often envisioned as the people of the Book par excellence—a community in which both practice and belief emerge from the interpretation of Scripture. As a practical consequence, the study of premodern Judaism(s) has largely been relegated to the Society of Biblical Literature and cognate organizations—which has, in turn, subtly reinforced this trend by disproportionately promoting work on early Judaism that coincides with these institution's charge to advance biblical studies. The intellectual implications of this categorization have not been entirely benign. The Bible continues to be shrouded in an aura of sui generity in a great deal of contemporary scholarly discourse. As a result, the traditional portrait of classical Judaism as the religion of the Hebrew Bible has often led researchers to treat premodern Judaism(s) as somehow exempt from the comparative observations that have come to structure the study of other religions and ancient cultural traditions in the academy. An emerging body of new research, however, has begun to bring the study of premodern Judaism(s) back in line with the study of other religious movements and historical traditions in this regard, by revealing that early Judaism was not always as Bible-centric as the traditional scholarly portrait suggests. Or at least, this work draws our attention to the fact that premodern Jews did not always engage with the biblical tradition in the ways that we have come to imagine that religious practitioners will relate to this canonical text. This series seeks to bring together scholars working on these issues to encourage the development of this new line of research."
