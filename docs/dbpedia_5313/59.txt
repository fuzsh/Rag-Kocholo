Contemporary Christian music stands out from other modern Christian music by being lyrically focused on the Christian faith - unlike most Christian rock or Christian metal, where the religious themes are often secondary to the style. In the '90s contemporary Christian music's popularity surged right along with the other genres, moving into the notice of the mainstream.

With a multitude of bands across genres like grunge, alt-rock, country, and even rap, contemporary Christian music was a defining part of the music scene in the 1990s. For Christian millennials, that wide range of contemporary Christian artists and bands that emerged in the '90s provided a freedom to explore subculture and identity with their friends who weren't in the church. Artists Steven Curtis Chapman and Amy Grant made it onto a million slumber party mixtapes, while Petra offered a little more edge.
