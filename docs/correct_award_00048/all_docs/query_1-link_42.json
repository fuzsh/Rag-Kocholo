        "text": "Herbert A. Hauptman, 94, a mathematician who shared the 1985 Nobel Prize in chemistry with the chemist Jerome Karle for developing revolutionary methods for determining the structure of molecules vital to life, died Sunday in Buffalo.\n\nMr. Hauptman and Karle's work had far-reaching impact in the manufacture of drugs for a variety of ailments.\n\nMr. Hauptman began collaborating with Karle after World War II. They turned their attention to X-ray crystallography, a means of deducing the three-dimensional structure of a molecule by analyzing how a crystal form of the molecule scatters a beam of X-rays aimed at it. The scattering pattern is recorded as points of light on X-ray film."
