        "text": "And that’s a wrap on week two of HWI’s High School Summer Education Program! This week, students had a tour of our Cryo-EM Center by scientists Dr. Devrim Acehan and Dr. Katherine Spoth. In addition, Dr. Ethan Abel from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center gave a presentation on research focusing on pancreatic cancer. The students have begun constructing their initial research project for a chosen health condition and are on their way to proposing future pathways to prevention and cures. We can’t wait to see what the students learn about and accomplish next week! HWI's Summer Education Program is graciously funded by The Cullen Foundation.\n\nCongratulations to Sarah EJ Bowman for being elected as a new Fellow of the American Crystallographic Association – the Structural Science Society! The ACA Fellows program serves to recognize a wealth of knowledge, experience and passion for structural science. The Fellows program celebrates the excellence of members of the ACA and promotes their recognition worldwide. ACA Fellows serve as scientific ambassadors to the broader scientific community and the general public to advance science education, research, knowledge, interaction, and collaboration. Dr. Bowman is an Associate Investigator at Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute and the Director of the National Crystallization Center. Her election as an ACA Fellow demonstrates the continued national recognition of scientists at HWI and their engagement in structural science. Dr. Bowman joins a number of HWI team members, both past and present, who have been named ACA Fellows. These individuals include Drs. Herbert Hauptman, Bill Duax, Lisa Keefe, Stephen Ginell, and Edward Snell.\n\nSet your alarms for 7:16pm… Give 716 starts! HWI appreciates your consideration of support for our mission to improve the health and well-being of humanity through structural biology with innovation, discovery, and education. Check out the many incentives and matching opportunities and visit https://lnkd.in/eyRY6fwb to donate!\n\nThis week, we kicked off our High School Summer Education Program! Students participating in our “Skill Set Building Through Structural Biology” program will choose a health condition/disease that is relevant or of interest to them in which they learn about the associated proteins involved in this condition. Throughout the program, they will develop team-building and leadership skills while performing scientific research which will culminate in a presentation to their peers, parents, mentors, and program staff on August 14. We look forward to showcasing the great work these high school students from the WNY region will accomplish during their summer at HWI! This year’s program is graciously supported by The Cullen Foundation.\n\nAction shots from some of the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute scientists presenting their work at the 74th Annual American Crystallographic Association Annual Meeting in Denver this week. Katherine Spoth giving her talk ‘Establishing a MicroED workflow at the Hauptman-Woodward Institute’. Sarah EJ Bowman giving her talk ‘Don’t Panic! Navigating Scientific Peer Review;. Gabrielle Budziszewski, PhD presenting her poster ’Striving to Meet the Needs of the Structural Biology Community at the National Crystallization Center’.\n\nHWI is proud to host students part of the BioXFEL Undergraduate Summer Internship Program. The interns have the opportunity to advance their discovery and understanding of science while participating in this program, which is administered at HWI for the the University at Buffalo, Arizona State University, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, University of California – Merced, and Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. The program provides the opportunity for the interns to delve further into their STEM interests through working directly with research teams, participating in coursework for BioXFEL students, and expanding professional development skills. Today, meet Maija, one of the BioXFEL interns studying at HWI this summer.\n\nScientists from Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute and IMCA-CAT are attending & having a great time at the 74th Annual American Crystallographic Association Annual Meeting in Denver this week. Katherine Spoth is giving a talk on Tuesday in the 'Using Microed at Your Institution: How Microed & Cryo-EM Can Coexist' Session. Sarah EJ Bowman is giving a talk on Wednesday in the 'A Hitchhiker’s Guide to Peer Review' Session. Gabrielle Budziszewski, PhD is presenting a poster on the National Crystallization Center in the Wednesday Poster Session. Devrim Acehan, Lisa J. Keefe, Miranda Lynch, Stephan L. Ginell, Aviv Paz & Mike Martynowycz, PhD are attending the meeting as well!\n\nThis week, students from UB’s Eric Pitman Annual Summer Workshop in Computational Science visited HWI for a tour. They were given a presentation by Education Director Nicole Terranova about HWI’s background and research focus. They were given a tour of our Cryo-EM center by Dr. Devrim Acehan and Dr. Katherine Spoth and were also able to see the National Crystallization Center with Dr. Gabrielle Budziszewski, PhD."
