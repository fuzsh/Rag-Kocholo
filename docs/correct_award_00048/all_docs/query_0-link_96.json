        "text": "Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute (HWI) is an independent, not-for-profit biomedical research facility specializing in the area of basic research known as structural biology. Located in the new Buffalo Life Sciences Complex on the BNMC [Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus], this institution was founded in 1956 by Dr. George Koepf and Helen Woodward Rivas. Their president and namesake, Dr. Herbert A. Hauptman, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985 for his development of the formula known as direct methods, where his application of classical mathematics finally resolved an issue that had defeated generations of chemists.\n\nHWI’s mission is two-fold; they are committed to improving human health by studying the causes of diseases, such as kidney disease, AIDS, cancer, arthritis, thyroid disorders, and many others, at their basic molecular level and are also working to educate the scientists of tomorrow. Since 2001, HWI has served as the University at Buffalo’s Department of Structural Biology.\n\n- Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus: Hauptman-Woodward Institute (online October 2016)\n\nThe architecture of the new building for the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute, Structural Biology Research Center in Buffalo, N.Y., expresses one overriding idea: openness.\n\n[Architect Mehrdad] Yazdani designed a three-part complex, consisting of a block laboratory wing lined with transparent channel glass, an aluminum-clad curved office wing and a three-story glass atrium that connects the two.\n\n\"The glass allows us to maintain that transparency throughout all the spaces,” Yazdani says. “Visibility between the offices and labs is maintained through channel and vision glass. A visitor could get glimpses of scientists working in the labs right upon entering the atrium.”\n\n“Their previous building was three stories of all brick with tiny windows,” Yazdani says. “If you drove by, you would not know there were Nobel Laureates working inside. Now, the channel glass, interrupted with portions of vision glass, allows diffused natural lighting to enhance the quality of the lab space.\n\n- Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute.
