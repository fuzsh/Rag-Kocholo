        "text": "Herbert A. Hauptman\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1985\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: The Medical Foundation of Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA\n\nPrize motivation: “for their outstanding achievements in the development of direct methods for the determination of crystal structures”\n\nPrize share: 1/2\n\nWork\n\nWhen mapping the molecular structure of molecules, it is important to study how X-rays, electromagnetic waves with a short wavelength, are bent by a crystal. What is important is the ray’s direction, intensity and phase—how the wave crests are displaced. During the first part of the 1950s, Herbert Hauptman and Jerome Karle developed a system of equations that used measurements of the rays’ intensity to determine their phases. This made direct determination of molecular structures possible."
