        "text": "Proud to see this article out by co-first authors Nick Jensen and Maria Maldonado-Gomez. This effort represents a new kind of glycomics-driven gut microbiome studies made possible by the new glycomics tools generated by Carlito Lebrilla and lab. Does monomer content of specific fibers drive differential gut microbiome composition/function? To ask this the Lebrilla lab employed high-throughput glycomic tools on 55 foods/fibers (yes 55!!) which where then taken through fecal fermentations. In short, monomer composition offers a generalizable tool to uncover links between diet, gut microbiota, and metabolite production. I am thankful for the great team from the Mills and Lebrilla labs for this major effort. Big thanks to corresponding author Diana Taft for shepherding this to completion. Such next gen glycomics tools will change the study of diet x microbiome function. More to come. https://lnkd.in/gxP4_bSb"
