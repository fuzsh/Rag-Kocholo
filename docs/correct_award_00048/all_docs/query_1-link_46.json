Hauptman, who saw beauty in mathematics, received the Nobel Prize nearly 40 years after setting out to solve a problem other scientists had given up on: how to determine molecular structures using X-ray crystallography. He used mathematical equations to interpret the patterns formed by X-rays scattered from crystals.",

        "text": "Dr. Hauptman, who saw beauty in mathematics, received the Nobel Prize nearly 40 years after setting out to solve a problem other scientists had given up on: how to determine molecular structures using X-ray crystallography. He used mathematical equations to interpret the patterns formed by X-rays scattered from crystals.\n\n“All I had to hear was here was a problem that no one could solve - not even that, but was even impossible to solve on principle,’’ Dr. Hauptman said during a 2008 documentary on his life produced by WNED-TV of Buffalo. “Once I heard that, there was no letting go.’’\n\nBorn in New York City, Dr. Hauptman began his research at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington but left for Buffalo during the Vietnam War after feeling pressured to develop antimissile and other war-related technology, something he was morally opposed to after serving in the US Navy during World War II.\n\n“The big lesson you learn from being in a war situation is that life becomes very cheap,’’ he said in the documentary, recalling how he got through his 18 months overseas by reading from one of his favorite books, “Advanced Calculus’’ by Edwin Bidwell Wilson, and working on problems. Playing with mathematical calculations was a habit he got into as a young boy, even as his brother and others his age were out playing ball.\n\nIn Buffalo, Dr. Hauptman continued his research at the Medical Foundation, which eventually became the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute in recognition of Dr. Hauptman’s contributions, along with the Woodward family, which supported the work.\n\nDr. Hauptman’s methodology “allows us to make three-dimensional representations of drugs so that we understand what they look like in space and can understand how they work,’’ said Eaton Lattman, chief executive of the Hauptman-Woodward Institute. “I don’t think there’s a single pharmaceutical that’s been developed in the last 30 years that hasn’t been studied using derivations of what Dr. Hauptman and his colleagues won the Nobel Prize for.’’\n\nThe Nobel was shared by research partner Jerome Karle, a physical chemist.\n\nDr. Hauptman earned a master’s degree in mathematics at Columbia University and a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Maryland.\n\nHe was a professor at the University at Buffalo, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and received honorary degrees from numerous universities.\n\nDr. Hauptman and his wife, Edith, had two daughters."
