        "text": "Walter White\n\nAppears in Portrayed by Alma Mater Breaking Bad Bryan Cranston\n\nField of study: Chemistry\n\nAfter graduating in chemistry at Caltech, Walter White joined a research team in order to workÂ on proton radiography (similar to X-rays). Supposedly, his contribution helped Herbert Hauptman and Jerome Karle in gettingÂ the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for theirÂ achievements in theÂ development of direct methods for the determination of crystal structures.\n\nAfter a series of bad decisions, Walter White ends up as an underpaid high school chemistry teacher which will lead him to becomeÂ Heisenberg: A drug lordÂ who uses his academic knowledgeÂ to cook the purest cristal meth available in the streets.\n\nHe reminds us of…\n\nThe nickname Walter choses reminds us ofÂ Werner HeisenbergÂ obviously, 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics. Heisenberg received this award thanks to his theories about quantum mechanics, even though he is also known for his work on cosmic rays and subatomic particles.\n\nBecause of his evolution during the TV show, this character also reminds us of Fritz Haber (the father of chemical warfare and Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918) who usedÂ hisÂ knowledge to developingÂ poisonousÂ gases during World War I. His Nobel Prize was awarded for his discovery of theÂ Haber – Bosch, a reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen we are still using today to make ammonia on an industrial scale (for fertilisers, among other things).\n\nOne of hisÂ quotes…\n\nâChemistry is, well technically, chemistry is the study of matter. But I prefer to see it as the study of change.â\n\nLa quÃ­mica es… tÃ©cnicamente, la quÃ­mica es el estudio de la materia. Pero, en mi caso, prefiero verlo como el estudio del cambio.\n\n3 OpenMind articles Walter White would read"
