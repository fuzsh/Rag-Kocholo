        "text": "2023\n\nMoungi G. Bawendi | Louis E. Brus | Alexei I. Ekimov\n\n“For the discovery and synthesis of quantum dot technology.”\n\nIn the 1930s, physicists began theorizing the properties of synthetic materials so small in their dimensions that they could exhibit quantum properties. Thanks to the collective discoveries and seminal experiments of Bawendi, Brus and Ekimov in the 1980s and 1990s, scientists have a chemical method for reliably producing high-quality, semiconducting quantum dots. Today, quantum dots (a few nanometers in diameter) are manufactured into products that are part of our everyday lives - TVs, computers and smartphones - and researchers believe that in the future, these semiconducting nanocrystals could be used in technologies such as flexible electronics, tiny sensors and quantum computers. NSF is proud to have supported the research and early-career development of Brus and Bawendi, including the latter's Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1991.\n\n2022\n\nCarolyn Bertozzi | Morten Meldal | K. Barry Sharpless\n\n“For the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry.”\n\nTheir breakthrough discoveries enabled new ways to create complex molecules more quickly and efficiently, even within the cells of living organisms. Their fundamental research provided the groundwork for new applications in multiple areas such as the development of new drugs and medical therapies and more targeted cancer treatments. NSF has supported both Bertozzi and Sharpless with awards over several decades, including Graduate Research Fellowships to both scientists, a CAREER award to Bertozzi and multiple other awards including those that supported their 2022 Nobel Prize-winning discoveries and Sharpless' earlier 2001 Nobel Prize-winning work.\n\n2020\n\nJENNIFER A. DOUDNA | EMMANUELLE CHARPENTIER\n\n“For the development of a method for genome editing.”\n\nThe Nobel Assembly has awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Jennifer A. Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, and Emmanuelle Charpentier, of the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens, in Berlin. NSF has long supported Doudna's work, as well as the work of other researchers in Doudna's CRISPR lab. NSF's support for Doudna began in 2000, when she was given the Alan T. Waterman award, and continued over two decades with awards for innovative basic research projects to advance CRISPR. Doudna, an advocate for fundamental research, has noted how CRISPR started as a basic science, curiosity-driven project. Her NSF-supported work included collaboration with Charpentier.\n\n2019\n\nJOHN B. GOODENOUGH | M. STANLEY WHITTINGHAM | AKIRA YOSHINO\n\n“For the development of lithium-ion batteries.”\n\nThe 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to John B. Goodenough of the University of Texas at Austin, M. Stanley Whittingham of the State University of New York at Binghamton, and Akira Yoshino of Asahi Kasei Corporation, Japan for the development of lithium-ion batteries. The award committee remarked that the work \"created the right conditions for a wireless and fossil-fuel free society, and so brought the greatest benefit to humankind.\" NSF has supported Goodenough and Whittingham's work over a span of 30 years, Goodenough with 21 research awards and Whittingham with 30 awards for research or teaching. Most of Goodenough's NSF-supported work focuses on magnets and superconductors. Whittingham discovered that it is possible to slide lithium ions in and out between the layers of an electrode, an instrumental finding in the development of lithium batteries.\n\n2018\n\nFRANCES H. ARNOLD | GEORGE P. SMITH | GREGORY P. WINTER\n\n“For the directed evolution of enzymes.”\n\nThe 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded Frances H. Arnold of California Institute of Technology and the other half jointly to George P. Smith of the University of Missouri and Gregory P. Winter at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Arnold's work is on the directed evolution of enzymes to synthesize everything from pharmaceuticals to biofuels to crop protections for agriculture. NSF supported Arnold through many awards over the course of three decades, including a Presidential Young Investigators Award in 1989 (8957118). Smith developed a way to use viruses to infect bacteria, and Winter applied that knowledge to direct changes in antibodies to make new therapeutic treatments. NSF provided funding to Smith to encourage students to integrate mathematics and the life sciences (0928053).\n\n2017\n\nJOACHIM FRANK\n\n“For developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution.”\n\nThe 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Jacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, Joachim Frank of Columbia University and Richard Henderson of MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, United Kingdom. Their work developing cryo-electron microscopy allows researchers to view the mechanisms that make life function on an unprecedented scale. Frank, who made the technology generally applicable, worked between 1975 and 1986 to develop a method to merge the microscope's fuzzy, 2-D images into sharp, 3-D structures. NSF provided three decades of support for his research, with nearly a dozen awards for work including the 1984 acquisition (8313045) of a high-resolution electron microscope for 3-D reconstruction (8313045), software support to make his imaging methods available to other researchers (9115534) and the development of enhanced visualizations (9219043).\n\n2016\n\nJ. FRASER STODDART\n\n“For the design and synthesis of molecular machines.”\n\nThe 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was shared by J. Fraser Stoddart of Northwestern University in the U.S., Jean-Pierre Sauvage of the University of Strasbourg, France, and Bernard L. Feringa of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. NSF has supported Stoddart's research. The three were recognized for their work creating machines on a molecular level. Sauvage succeeded in linking two ring-shaped molecules together to form a chain, not by covalent bonds in which atoms share molecules but by mechanical bonds. Stoddart's research group created a rotaxane -- a ring-shaped molecule that is mechanically attached to an axle. They have constructed a molecular lift and a muscle out of various rotaxanes. Feringa designed a molecule that was mechanically constructed to control the direction of its spin. \"They have developed molecules with controllable movements, which can perform a task when energy is added,\" noted the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences press release. \"The 2016 Nobel Laureates in Chemistry have miniaturized machines and taken chemistry to a new dimension.\" Stoddart has received NSF support since 2009, including award #1308107.\n\n2015\n\nPAUL MODRICH | AZIZ SANCAR\n\n“For mechanistic studies of DNA repair.”\n\nThe 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Tomas Lindahl, Paul Modrich and Aziz Sancar. They were recognized for research that led to important insights about how cells function --how they repair damaged DNA and protect genetic information--that can be used for the development of new cancer treatments. Modrich and Sancar received NSF support early in their research careers. Modrich, of Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Duke University School of Medicine, was funded through NSF's Biological Sciences Directorate for research on DNA replication proteins, using bacteriophage--a virus that infects bacteria--as a model system (7823036, 7604914, and 7623735. The research led to important findings about the enzyme that replicates DNA. Sancar, of the University of North Carolina, was honored for his research on another cellular mechanism used to repair ultraviolet damage to DNA. Modrich was awarded an NSF Graduate Fellowship in 1968. Sancar was selected by NSF's Biological Sciences Directorate for a Presidential Young Investigator award (8351212).\n\n2014\n\nWILLIAM E. MOERNER\n\n“For the development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy.”\n\nThe 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded jointly to Eric Betzig of Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stefan W. Hell of Germany's Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, and William E. Moerner of Stanford University. Moerner has received extensive NSF support throughout his career beginning with his selection for a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship in 1975. More recently, he has received continuing grants and small grants for exploratory research (SGER) from NSF's Biological Sciences Directorate and Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\n\n2013\n\nMARTIN KARPLUS | MICHAEL LEVITT | ARIEH WARSHEL\n\n“For the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems.”\n\nThe 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded jointly to Martin Karplus of the UniversitÃ© de Strasbourg, France, and Harvard University, Michael Levitt of Stanford University School of Medicine, and Arieh Warshel of the University of Southern California.\n\n2012\n\nBRIAN K. KOBILKA\n\n“For studies of G-protein-coupled receptors.”\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded jointly to Robert J. Lefkowitz and Brian K. Kobilka for research that reveals the inner workings of an important family of receptors, the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Each cell in the human body has tiny receptors that enable it to sense its environment so that it can adapt to new situations. There are over 800 GPCRs in the human genome. Kobilka, of the Stanford University School of Medicine, was selected for an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship in 1977. More recently, he received an International Collaboration in Chemistry award (#1223785) for research on the chemical basis for allosteric regulation of G-protein-coupled receptors.\n\n2010\n\nRICHARD F. HECK | EI-ICHI NEGISHI\n\n“For palladium-catalyzed cross couplings in organic synthesis.”\n\nIn the Heck reaction, the Negishi coupling and the Suzuki reaction, carbon atoms meet on a palladium atom, where their proximity to one another kick-starts the chemical reaction. NSF has funded Heck and Negishi multiple times since 1977 and 1980 respectively for carbon-based (organic) chemistry research that set the groundwork for the development of these award-winning scientific methods now widely used in medicine/pharmaceuticals, agriculture and electronics.\n\n2009\n\nTHOMAS A. STEITZ\n\n“For studies of the structure and function of the ribosome.”\n\nSteitz received the prize for showing what the ribosome looks like and how it functions at the atomic level. Ribosomes produce proteins, which in turn control the chemistry in all living organisms. He used a method called X-ray crystallography to map the position for each and every one of the hundreds of thousands of atoms that make up the ribosome. Steitz, Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry and professor of chemistry at Yale University and investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, received NSF support for research on the structural basis of the molecular mechanism of cellular control in the late 1970s (7725111) and 1980s (8110880, 8316666) and an equipment award (8413761) in 1985.\n\n2008\n\nOSAMU SHIMOMURA | MARTIN CHALFIE | ROGER Y. TSIEN\n\n“For the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein, GFP.”\n\nThis year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry rewards the initial discovery of GFP and a series of important developments that led to its use as a tagging tool in bioscience. This glowing marker allows researchers to watch the movements, positions and interactions of tagged proteins. Shimomura, professor emeritus at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Mass. and Boston University's Medical School, received NSF support for research on the biochemistry of luminescence and the photoprotein aequorin, which is used in monitoring intracellular calcium, from 1979 (7822959) to 1997 (9630861 and 9722982). Chalfie, professor of Biological Sciences at Columbia University, received NSF funding in 1990 (9019798). Tsien, presently at the University of California at San Diego, received NSF funding in the late 1980s (8714246, 8847134) to establish a center for the study of cell morphology and function at University of California - Berkeley.\n\n2005\n\nROBERT H. GRUBBS | RICHARD R. SCHROCK\n\n“For the development of the metathesis method in organic synthesis.”\n\nGrubbs and Schrock received the prize for their pioneering work on metathesis. This chemical reaction has become a mainstay of the chemical industry, mainly in the development of pharmaceuticals and of advanced plastic materials, and has greatly advanced the cause of \"green chemistry.” NSF has provided extensive support for both Grubbs and Schrock since the 1970s.\n\nGRUBBS\n\nAffiliation: California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Pasadena, CA\n\nNSF Support: Awards 0443614, 0410425, 0239697, 0111946, 9809856, 9509745, 9313230, 9202583, 9018677, 8922072, 8812094, 8520517, 8214668, 8106810, 8016528, 7918031, 7904814, 7714752, 750779\n\nSCHROCK\n\nAffiliation: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA NSF Support: Awards 0138995, 9988766, 9700736, 9500750, 9312413, 9122827, 9007175, 8822508, 8402892, 8121282, 7607410\n\n2003\n\nPETER AGRE\n\n“For the discovery of water channels.”\n\nNSF supported a group of researchers at Johns Hopkins, including Agre, in the purchase of an electron microscope through a 1996 award (see award 9601943).\n\nRODERICK MACKINNON\n\n“For structural and mechanistic studies of ion channels.”\n\nRoderick MacKinnon of Rockefeller University made discoveries concerning how salts (ions) are transported out of and into the cells of the body, a process necessary for producing electrical signals in the nervous system. MacKinnon determined the structure of the potassium ion channel from studies of the bacterium Streptomyces lividans using the NSF-supported Cornell High-Energy Synchrotron Source (9713424).\n\n2002\n\nJOHN B. FENN\n\n“For [joint] development of soft desorption ionisation methods for mass spectrometric analyses of biological macromolecules.”\n\nNSF support includes 10 awards spanning a quarter century, from 1975 (7521821) through 1999 (9902045).\n\n2001\n\nK. BARRY SHARPLESS\n\n“For his work on chirally catalysed oxidation reactions.”\n\nNSF support for Sharpless includes a series of seven awards from 1977 (7714628) to 1999 (9985553)."
