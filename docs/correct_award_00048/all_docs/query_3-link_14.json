        "text": "AKA Herbert Aaron Hauptman\n\nBorn: 14-Feb-1917\n\nBirthplace: New York City\n\nDied: 23-Oct-2011\n\nLocation of death: Buffalo, NY\n\nCause of death: Stroke\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Atheist [1]\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Mathematician\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: X-ray diffraction studies\n\nMilitary service: US Air Force (1941-47; radar instructor)\n\nAmerican mathematician Herbert A. Hauptman, working with chemist Jerome Karle, developed a method to help clarify x-ray crystallography (the study of the formation and structure of crystals), using a mathematical process called the \"direct method\" to overcome technical issues and allow much quicker and more accurate analysis of molecular structures. Their work allowed researchers to determine the location of specific atoms in a crystallized substance, by analyzing the pattern diffraction, called scattering, in variable intensities.\n\nHauptman and Karle calculated their process using slide rules over the course of several years beginning in 1949 and culminating in a 1953 paper. More than a decade passed before the value of their methodology was widely accepted, because their conclusions crossed scientific disciplines Â— crystallographers had little interest in complex mathematics and doubted that math was relevant to their technical problems, while very few mathematicians knew enough about crystallography to make sense of Hauptman and Karle's papers.\n\nThe results, however, were spectacular. Unravelling the structure of a relatively simple 15-atom antibiotic molecule was reduced from a two-year task to a matter of mere days. With the advent of computer software, their process was used to almost instantly reveal the structures of thousands of molecules for the first time, leading to practical applications including hormones analysis, improved fertilizers, and the development of myriad new antibiotics and pharmaceuticals.\n\nHauptman attended City College of New York in a time when its tuition was free, and often stated that it was the only way he could have afforded a college education. With Karle, he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1985.\n\n[1] \"This kind of belief [religion] is damaging to the well-being of the human race.\"\n\nFather: Israel Hauptman\n\nMother: Leah Rosenfeld\n\nBrother: Manuel (d. 2009)\n\nBrother: Robert\n\nWife: Edith Citrynell (teacher, m. 10-Nov-1940, two daughters)\n\nDaughter: Barbara (b. 1947)\n\nDaughter: Carol Fullerton (b. 1950)\n\nHigh School: Townsend Harris High School, Queens, NY (1933)\n\nUniversity: BS Mathematics, City College of New York (1937)\n\nUniversity: MA Mathematics, Columbia University (1939)\n\nUniversity: PhD Mathematics, University of Maryland (1955)\n\nHauptman Woodward Institute President (1988-)\n\nHauptman Woodward Institute Research Director (1970-88)\n\nNavy Department Naval Research Laboratory (1947-70)\n\nUS Commerce Department Statistician, US Census Bureau (1939-41)\n\nBelden Prize in Mathematics 1936\n\nNRL RESA Award for Applied Science 1957\n\nACA A.L.
