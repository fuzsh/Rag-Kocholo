        "text": "Jerome Karle (born June 18, 1918, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died June 6, 2013, Annandale, Virginia) was an American crystallographer who, along with Herbert A. Hauptman, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1985 for their development of mathematical methods for deducing the molecular structure of chemical compounds from the patterns formed when X-rays are diffracted by their crystals.\n\nKarle was a classmate of Hauptman’s at City College in New York, from which they both graduated in 1937. Karle went on to earn a Ph.D. degree in physical chemistry at the University of Michigan in 1943. After working on the Manhattan Project in 1943–46, he joined the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in 1946, becoming in 1967 its chief scientist for research on the structure of matter; he retired in 2009.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nNumbers and Mathematics"
