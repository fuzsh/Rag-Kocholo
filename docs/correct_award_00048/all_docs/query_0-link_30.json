        "text": "Dr. Herbert A. Hauptman (born February 14, 1917) is a world renowned American mathematician and Nobel laureate. He pioneered and developed a mathematical method that has changed the whole field of chemistry and opened a new era in research in determination of molecular structures of crystallized materials. Today, Dr. Hauptman's direct methods, which he has continued to improve and refine, are routinely used to solve complicated structures. It was the application of this mathematical method to a wide variety of chemical structures that led the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to name Dr. Hauptman and Dr. Jerome Karle recipients of the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nLife\n\nHe was born in New York City, the oldest child of Israel Hauptman and Leah Rosenfeld. He is married to Edith Citrynell since November 10, 1940, with two daughters, Barbara (1947) and Carol (1950).\n\nHe was interested in science and mathematics from an early age which he pursued at Townsend Harris High School, graduated from the City College of New York (1937) and obtained an M.A. degree in mathematics from Columbia University in 1939.\n\nAfter the war he started a collaboration with Jerome Karle at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. and at the same time enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of Maryland, College Park. This combination of mathematics and physical chemistry expertise enabled them to tackle head-on the phase problem of X-ray crystallography. By 1954 he had received his Ph.D. and they had laid the foundations of the direct methods in X-ray crystallography. Their 1953 monograph, \"Solution of the Phase Problem I. The Centrosymmetric Crystal\", contained the main ideas, the most important of which was the introduction of probabilistic methods.\n\nIn 1970 he joined the crystallographic group of the Medical Foundation of Buffalo of which he was Research Director in 1972. During the early years of this period he formulated the neighborhood principle and extension concept. These theories were further developed during the following decades.\n\nLife Work\n\nProf. Hauptman has authored over 170 publications, including journal articles, research papers, chapters and books. In 1970, Dr. Hauptman joined the crystallographic group of the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute (formerly the Medical Foundation of Buffalo) of which he became Research Director in 1972. He currently serves as President of the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute as well as Research Professor in the Department of Biophysical Sciences and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University at Buffalo. Prior to coming to Buffalo, he worked as a mathematician and supervisor in various departments at the Naval Research Laboratory from 1947. He received his B.S. from City College of New York, M.S. from Columbia University and Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, College Park.\n\nAwards and Titles\n\nBelden Prize in Mathematics, City College of New York, 1936\n\nScientific Research Society of America, Pure Science Award, Naval Research Laboratory, 1959\n\nPresident, Philosophical Society of Washington, 1969-1970\n\nPresident of the Association of Independent Research Institutes, 1979-1980\n\nPatterson Award in 1984 given by the American Crystallographic Association\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry, 1985 (jointly with Jerome Karle)\n\nHonorary degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1985\n\nHonorary degree from CCNY in 1986\n\nCitizen of the Year Award, Buffalo Evening News, 1986\n\nNorton Medal, SUNY, 1986\n\nSchoellkopf Award, American Chemical Society (Western New York Chapter) 1986\n\nGold Plate Award, American Academy of Achievement, 1986\n\nCooke Award, SUNY, 1987\n\nEstablishment of the Eccles-Hauptman Student Award, SUNY in 1987\n\nElection to the National Academy of Sciences in 1988\n\nHumanist Laureate Award from the International Humanist and Ethical Union in 1988\n\nHonorary degree from the University of Parma, Italy in 1989\n\nHonorary degree from the D'Youville College, Buffalo, New York in 1989\n\nHonorary degree from Bar-Ilan University, Israel in 1990\n\nHonorary degree from Columbia University in 1990\n\nHonorary degree from Technical University of Lodz, Poland in 1992\n\nHonorary degree from Queen's University, Kingston, Canada in 1993"
