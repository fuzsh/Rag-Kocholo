        "text": "The mathematician Herbert Hauptman was best known as the co-winner of the 1985 Nobel Prize in chemistry. He and Jerome Karle, a physical chemist, won the prize “for their outstanding achievements in the development of direct methods for the determination of crystal structures”.\n\nThese revolutionary mathematical methods for deducing the molecular structure of chemical compounds changed the whole field of chemistry. To date the structures of thousands of molecules have been solved by crystallographers using Hauptman’s direct methods, and many more are added to the list every year.\n\nHauptman and Karle developed a series of complex mathematical formulae, partly based on probability theory, which allowed a quicker and more accurate analysis to be made of the structure of molecules; it was called the “direct method”."
