        "text": "Welcome\n\nA City College graduate, and later Mathematics Professor, Jesse Douglas, was a recipient of the first Fields Medal in Mathematics -- regarded by the profession as the equivalent of the Nobel prize. Nobel laureates Herbert Hauptman in chemistry, Kenneth Arrow and most recently Robert Aumann (2005) in economics, were former City College math majors who received their Nobel prizes for highly mathematical work.\n\nIndeed, dozens of our graduates, having received a rigorous and inspiring education from the College, have achieved recognition as world leaders in all fields touched by mathematics. Hundreds of others have become mathematics educators, business executives, and respected faculty in colleges and universities throughout the country.\n\nWe invite you to share in this magnificent tradition. Whether you are just beginning college-level mathematics, or are interested in graduate study, or are somewhere in between, you will find in our Department the instruction you need. We offer a wide selection of introductory and advanced courses, taught by an outstanding group of dedicated faculty, many of whom are internationally renowned mathematicians. Browse through our site to learn what we have to offer and how we can use our talents to help you develop yours."
