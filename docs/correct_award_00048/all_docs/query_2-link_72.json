It is no wonder why many Nobel Prize winners studied economics, physics, and sociology at the institution.\n\nMilton Friedman learned consumption analysis skills that made him demonstrate the complexity of stabilization policy. It made him earn the 1976 prize in economics. Years later, George J. Stigler won the Prize in economic science in 1982 for contributing to the study of market processes and industrial structure.\n\nLuis Alvarez discovered the resonance states of matter that made him win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1968. Man would not have known the muon neutrino if not for the contribution of Jack Steinberger. It made him win the Prize in Physics in 1988.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nMIT is a source of scientific and technological training in the research of engineering materials and physical sciences. It has produced some of the following Nobel Prize winners.\n\nPaul Krugman won the Nobel Prize in economic sciences in 2008 for redefining the geography of international trade and economics. Robert J. Shiller the attributed to the empirical analysis of asset prices earning him the 2013 prize in economic sciences.\n\nThe 2001 peace prize went to Kofi Anan for his work of redefining the UN through prioritizing human rights.
