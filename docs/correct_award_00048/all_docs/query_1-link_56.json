        "text": "(1918–2013). U.S. chemist and crystallographer Jerome Karle who, along with Herbert A. Hauptman, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1985. They won the prize for their contribution for the development of mathematical methods for deducing the molecular structure of chemical compounds from the patterns formed when X rays are diffracted by their crystals.\n\nKarle was born on June 18, 1918, in New York, New York. He was a classmate of Hauptman’s at City College in New York, from which they both graduated in 1937. Karle went on to earn his Ph.D. degree in physical chemistry at the University of Michigan in 1943. After working on the Manhattan Project in 1943–44, he joined the Naval Research Laboratory in 1946, becoming in 1967 its chief scientist for research on the structure of matter.\n\nAfter World War II Karle and Hauptman began collaborating at the Naval Research Laboratory on the study of crystal structures. The two men devised mathematical equations to describe the arrangements of numerous spots that appear on photographic film as a result of a crystal’s diffraction of X rays. Their equations enabled the location of atoms within the crystal’s molecules to be pinpointed based upon an analysis of the intensity of the spots. Their method was neglected for some years after its publication in 1949, but the efforts of Karle’s chemist wife, Isabella, to point out its potential applications gradually induced crystallographers to begin using the method to determine the three-dimensional structure of thousands of small biological molecules, including those of many hormones, vitamins, and antibiotics. Before Karle and Hauptman developed their method, it took two years to deduce the structure of a simple biological molecule; in the 1980s, using powerful computers to perform the complex calculations demanded by their method, the task took about two days. Karle died on June 6, 2013, in Annandale, Virginia."
