        "text": "Knowledge of molecular structure is important in chemistry, because chemicals behave in the way they do because of their structure. For example, haemoglobin in the blood can carry oxygen because it can fold over and hold an oxygen atom inside it. In all the fields in which chemistry plays a role, from genetic engineering to materials science to drug research, scientists proceed by determining molecular structure and finding the \"active sites\" which determine how the molecules behave.\n\nBefore Hauptman and Karle began their collaboration at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington in the late 1940s, it could take months or even years to determine the structure of a molecule. X-ray crystallography (a technique that involves firing X-ray beams at a material formed into crystals, then examining the patterns created by the reflected beams on photographic film) had been developed, but researchers could do no more than draw inferences about molecular structure, and the process was extremely laborious.\n\nHauptman and Karle's breakthrough, published in 1953 in a monograph entitled Solution of the Phase Problem I. The Centrosymmetric Crystal, was to devise a direct method of analysing the X-ray spots using probability theory to calculate the angles at which the X-ray beams are deflected as they pass near the electrons surrounding the nucleus of an atom. They then came up with equations that translated this information into maps that reconstructed the placement of atoms in the crystal.\n\nThe new \"direct method\" was poorly understood to begin with. It did not really catch on until the late 1960s, and it took modern computer technology to apply it efficiently. When it came on stream, however, chemical researchers found that they could determine molecular structure much faster and without using guesswork. For example, when scientists working on making an artificial replica of the anti-cancer drug vincristine (which is derived from plants) found they were getting nowhere, using the Hauptman-Karle method they established that they had worked out its structure incorrectly. With the correct structure, they were able to produce the drug more quickly and cheaply.\n\nAnnouncing the award of the Nobel in 1985, the judges observed that it was \"almost impossible\" to give an example in the field of chemistry where the Hauptman-Karle method was not being used, adding that it had helped in the development of hundreds of modern drugs.\n\nHerbert Aaron Hauptman was born on February 14 1917 in the Bronx and attended Townsend Harris Hall. After taking a degree in Mathematics at New York's City College, he went on to take a master's from Columbia in 1939.\n\nHe served in the US Navy during the Second World War as a weather forecaster in the South Pacific, then joined Jerome Karle at the Naval Research Laboratory in 1947. He also enrolled at the University of Maryland, taking a doctorate in Mathematics.\n\nIn 1970 Hauptman joined the Medical Foundation of Buffalo, New York State, a private foundation specialising in endocrine research. He became research director of the foundation and its president in 1988.\n\nHauptman was philosophical about the award of the Nobel, noting that it meant that his wife was sought out more often by society ladies. Outside the field of scientific research, he was known for his outspoken atheism: belief in God, he once declared, is not only incompatible with good science, but is \"damaging to the wellbeing of the human race''.\n\nHerbert Hauptman married, in 1940, Edith Citrynell, who survives him with their two daughters."
