        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThe Catch\n\nThis deﬁnitive environmental history of medieval ﬁsh and ﬁsheries provides a comprehensive examination of European engagement with aquatic systems between c. 500 and 1500 CE. Using textual, zooarchaeological, and natural records, Richard C. Hoffmann’s unique study spans marine and freshwater ﬁsheries across western Christendom, discusses effects of human–nature relations and presents a deeper understanding of evolving European aquatic ecosystems. Changing climates, landscapes, and ﬁshing pressures affected local stocks enough to shift values of ﬁsh, ﬁshing rights, and dietary expectations. Readers learn what the abbess Waldetrudis in seventh-century Hainault, King Ramiro II (d.1157) of Aragon, and thirteenth-century physician Aldebrandin of Siena shared with English antiquarian William Worcester (d.1482), and the young Martin Luther growing up in Germany soon thereafter. Sturgeon and herring, carp, cod, and tuna played distinctive roles. Hoffmann highlights how encounters between medieval Europeans and ﬁsh had consequences for society and the environment – then and now. Richard C. Hoffmann is Professor Emeritus in History at York University, Toronto, and author of the acclaimed An Environmental History of Medieval Europe (Cambridge, 2014).\n\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press\n\nStudies in Environment and History Editors J.

Our perceptions and understanding of it, which we call history, do change with new questions, new awareness of what constitutes evidence of a particular past, and new paradigms for provisional apprehension of that past. Environmental history is barely more than a scholarly generation old. The questions it poses to known traditional sources have altered much understanding of fairly recent pasts. Its liaisons with various branches of natural science have revealed hitherto unknown traces of past phenomena in natural and in human cultural realms. Of preindustrial Europe, for instance, we now know (or think we know) more about diseases (plague, rinderpest) and atmospheric events (drought, storms, cold spells) and thus of their places in human lives than did anyone in the late 1960s when humans ﬁrst left their planet and safely returned. What has been learned of past people’s experiences with pandemics, storm ﬂoods, and changing regional weather patterns (‘climate’) can help guide responses to present-day socio-natural events. And what about human, or just one culture’s, historic relations with dominant forms of aquatic life, ﬁshes? That is and was not the ﬁrst question to come to mind for an interdisciplinary medievalist agrarian historian, even after a childhood ﬁlled with experiences in a quasi-rural landscape beside a great inland sea. Nor even with early and later revived pleasure in recreational angling, due at least in part to its function as release from professional scholarly routines. Even after taking professional note of some ﬁshing communities amidst the grain-growing landscape of medieval Silesia, it took an unexpected and unexplained invitation to write a brief encyclopedia article on medieval ﬁshponds to prompt initially cursory interest. The necessary deep dive into a literature mostly ill-informed about ﬁsh, history, or both did pique idle curiosity into still peripheral investigation of historic aquaculture, angling, and ever less peripheral attention to medieval uses of inland waters as resources for transport, power, and food. Although the latter motivated initial contact with archaeozoologists who studied remains of ﬁshes xix\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108955898.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxx\n\nPreface and Acknowledgements\n\nfound in medieval trash heaps, my approaches long remained via economic and social avenues of enquiry, even as my late and sorely missed ofﬁce neighbour Elinor Melville admonished “Richard, you are really doing environmental history!,” i.e. history as if nature mattered. So what environmental history might a medievalist of materialist bent do in the mid-1990s? Self-identiﬁed environmental historians, then and still deservedly well known, wrote articles and books on how human activities affected their natural surroundings. That was not a topic much pursued by medievalists. Even important research on woodland clearance and wetland drainage was cast in terms of economic development, not environmental impact. But I did know enough of that literature and its sources to turn it on its head and infer, even describe, the effects those and other medieval economic activities had on aquatic habitats, organisms, and ecosystems. A conference paper prepared to help Canadian representation at the International Congress of Historical Sciences in Montreal, 1995, turned into the ﬁrst environmental history article to grace the cover of the American Historical Review in 1996, and then underwent metamorphosis into a book proposal and sabbatical/leave fellowship in 1997. That manuscript (Catch I?) was two-thirds complete when events at York University stalled my ability to think and write creatively for something more than a year. Subsequent service obligations to my department and colleagues in an agitated institution while simultaneously helping to establish a graduate ﬁeld in preindustrial environmental history then consumed another two years. Happily my collegial friends in the Fish Remains Working Group continued to enjoy and encourage my efforts to turn their site reports into small works of history. Teaching, and publishing articles and book chapters, on the general theme of medieval European environmental history led me to doubt the efﬁcacy of a primarily economic approach to the ﬁeld in general and to historic ﬁsheries in particular. Models then prevalent for relations among economy, culture, and nature (to mention one of several paradigms) left me dissatisﬁed and unable to move from abstractions to operational propositions and testable relationships. Was catching and eating ﬁsh economy or culture? If a ﬁsh in the water is nature, does it become something else in a net? Or in a pan? Or as skeletal remains in a midden? While it became clear that the approach I had followed in the articles and manuscript of 1996–1997 had fatal ﬂaws, it was only after time spent with Viennese colleagues at the Zentrum für Umweltgeschichte of the then Faculty for Interdisciplinary Research and Education (IFF) and more encounters with aquatic scientists that I found in the interaction model treating human society and its works as hybrids of autonomous natural\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108955898.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface and Acknowledgements\n\nxxi\n\nand cultural forces a heuristic that seemed to work. By my next sabbatical in 2006–2007, I was well into a new book manuscript (Catch II?) with a more dynamic role for natural forces interacting with medieval human culture bearers, while also exploiting more fully especially new research ﬁndings of archaeozoologist colleagues. Then an invitation to write the ﬁrst wide-ranging environmental history of medieval Europe (not just episodes of clearances, pollution, St. Francis, and plagues) offered an opportunity to apply and disseminate the interactive metabolic approach to broader audiences. With the ﬁshes set aside more willing this time, the Environmental History of Medieval Europe was drafted by 2011, revised in 2012–2013, and published in 2014. Returning to ‘The Catch’ in 2013 meant newly appeared literature in several relevant ﬁelds had to be reviewed, assessed, and integrated. Experience with the medieval environmental history book and burgeoning research by climate historians and marine biologists together opened exciting new ecological perspectives on several key ﬁsheries. A decade of new ﬁndings from stable isotope analysis of human remains, a source just gaining recognition in 2007, cast essential new light on the evolving place of ﬁsh in medieval diets. Despite other commitments, for the ﬁrst time a complete manuscript (Catch III?) was drafted by spring 2019, only to fall for the rest of that year into a prospective publisher’s sadly black hole. It ﬁnally went out to readers for Cambridge at the end of that year and was accepted subject to the anticipated beneﬁcial revisions at the very moment the COVID-19 virus embarked on its global rampage. Ensuing cultural precautions, restrictions, and lockdowns on both sides of the Atlantic slowed by months the processes of revision (inaccessible libraries, inability to replace obsolete technology, etc.) and the acquisition and management of illustrations. These latest hurdles have, however, neither changed a past millennium of relations among Europeans and ﬁshes, nor the value of understanding, as best we can for now, the implications this view of medieval engagement with the natural world had for lives and ecosystems then, and may have for present-day grasp of our own planetary situation. What have three decades in pursuit of long-dead ﬁsh, ﬁshers, and piscivores shown me? An initial surprise was the mutual ignorance of ﬁsheries scientists and writers regarding history and its methods on the one hand and of medievalists, even economic historians, regarding ﬁsh (among other things of nature) on the other. Over time my surprise dwindled to almost cynical expectations of inattention, while gradually some medievalists and ﬁsh people did come to show genuine respect and interest for each other’s methods and ﬁndings. I’d like to hope that environmental historians and collegial archaeozoologists have shown the way to\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108955898.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxxii\n\nPreface and Acknowledgements\n\nthis common objective. Data assembled by both bone specialists and archival historians must be read with full contextual awareness to make sense of the past. Training as an interdisciplinary medievalist may ease a path to consilience, even if traditional medievalists were rarely alert to such mundane matters as ﬁshes. As an agrarian historian, ﬁeld naturalist, ﬂy-ﬁsher, and stream rehab volunteer, I was less surprised than most to ﬁnd medieval sources replete with (always skewed and partial) references to ﬁsh and ﬁshing. More recently historians of climate have emerged in similar manner and to like effect. History where nature matters. The Catch turned out to be a story of similarities and patterns and of speciﬁc and local differences alike. It repeatedly demonstrates the ubiquity of ﬁsheries across medieval European Christendom, not just or even primarily by the piscaterian monks of present-day popular myth. Almost as widespread were the adaptations regional medieval human communities made to the particulars of their neighbouring aquatic ecosystems with distinctive habitats, species mixes, seasonalities, and opportunities to take ﬁshes in small or quite large numbers. Yet I remain slightly puzzled about how much, if anything, dominant medieval elites actually knew about how their subjects really caught ﬁsh, even when obliged to do so. One key aspect of ﬁsheries technology was (and is) keeping a highly perishable material from rapid decay into uselessness. Early medieval preservation techniques, like those for capture, involved diverse applications of general procedures, in this case drying, smoking, and dry salting. Then by the high Middle Ages and often under mercantile inﬂuence, certain methods, notably calling for barrels and speciﬁc treatments with salt or brine, spread with, and in essential support of, new consumer markets. Dissemination of innovative capture gears came later. Finally, and to the satisfaction of believers in the alert practical intelligence of ordinary medieval people, I have been mildly surprised and pleased to uncover the widespread concern of medieval communities and authorities to maintain their supplies of ﬁsh through measures ranging across spectra from preservation of catches to provisioning markets, defending access to local stocks, and eventually to practices meant to ensure continuity of ﬁsh reproduction and habitats with what might now be called their sustainable use. Medieval Europeans, like other indigenous cultures, were aware of their natural world and could, in pursuit of their own survival values, put that knowledge to protective purposes, whether literate elites recognized that or not. Thus pursuing the exploitation of ﬁsheries renders a mildly hopeful tale of traditional ecological knowledge and its superior ability to support continual careful resource use. Less prudent approaches set stocks and entire ecosystems at risk.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108955898.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface and Acknowledgements\n\nxxiii\n\nNo major research project, and especially not one engaging several disciplines and sub-disciplines, multiple methodologies, more than a dozen present-day countries (and more medieval polities), and as many languages modern and medieval over three decades, can be accomplished without essential aid from colleagues, librarians, archivists, various technical specialists, and the help and questions of students.

The book traces common patterns, variants, and changes over time in medieval experiences exploiting Europe’s diverse ﬁsh populations. Human desires, abilities, and impacts played off in sometimes unexpected ways against changing aquatic habitats and ﬁsh stocks. Unsatisﬁed wants and newly available opportunities transformed social and environmental relations, affecting people’s experiences of their natural surroundings then and in a much longer term. The Middle Ages look somewhat different when viewed from the water and so do presentday issues in ﬁsheries science and management when seen in perspective of a thousand years long past. One catch for author and readers alike is the difference between discourses of interdisciplinary natural science and of interdisciplinary medieval studies. But that is inherent in environmental history, history studied as if nature matters. This enterprise must aspire to mediate between the two conversations.\n\nI.1\n\nFish Tales\n\nHumans and ﬁshes, creatures terrestrial and aquatic, inhabit what medieval Europeans conceived as two different elements, earth and water. That they were and are intimately engaged some observers then and now remained wholly oblivious. Others can tell stories, in some way testifying to how ﬁsh and ﬁsheries were thought to matter across a millennium and more of Europeans’ encounters with life forms in and beyond their own waters. An opening sampler of three tales alerts readers of various backgrounds to the conﬂuence of methods and data sets and to some of the diverse perspectives and issues to be encountered in this realm of interaction between European natures and the medieval cultures that thrived among them. 1\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108955898.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n2\n\nThe Catch\n\nI.1.1\n\nObservations and Inferences: The Long Demise of the Atlantic Sturgeon\n\nThe sad yet curiously complicated tale of the European Atlantic (or sea) sturgeon1 begins in distant times, for this family displays many primitive physiological features. Reaching four to six meters and living sixty to a hundred years these creatures of coasts, estuaries, and large rivers consume bottom organisms and small ﬁshes. Spawned over river gravels, the young live for a time in estuarine shallows before slowly growing up to 400 kilograms, making them the largest ﬁsh in western European fresh waters. Sturgeons ﬁrst reproduce after age twelve and thereafter only every few years. They lack bony skeletons, but their backs and sides bear horny plates called scutes which endure in archaeological settings. And sturgeon ﬂesh was historically prized. Roman luxury demand had by the ﬁrst century CE seriously depleted once abundant stocks in the Rhône estuary. They took centuries to recover.2 Early medieval elites continued to enjoy eating sturgeon. A Byzantine physician at the court of Frankish king Theodoric (511–534) recommended it for diners in good health. Centuries later Prüm abbey in Luxembourg required serfs from its Rhine delta manors annually to haul an eleven-foot (three-metre) specimen some 200 kilometers overland or upriver for the monks to eat.3 Finds from seventh- to ninth-century highstatus sites along the southern Baltic coast suggest that sturgeon there provided up to 70 percent of the weight of ﬁsh consumed, results corroborated from more recently and precisely excavated tenth-century Gdańsk.4 Already by the twelfth century surviving records indicate ﬁshing pressure and drainage projects were reducing the frequency, relative share, and size of harvested sturgeons. In the same south Baltic sites just mentioned, their share fell below 20, even to 10, percent of recovered ﬁsh remains. The average size of sturgeon consumed at Gdańsk fell from 1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nEach species of European ﬁshes here mentioned is identiﬁed in text by its common English name, where such exists.

From the river Ems the sturgeon present up to the thirteenth century had vanished by the next. Written records from the Low Countries mark further losses among coastal stocks from the eleventh through the fourteenth century. The genus then disappears from food waste at the castle in Namur and also from archaeological ﬁnds at Schaffhausen, the probable upper limit of its range in the Rhine.6 Thirteenth-century French and English kings claimed exclusive rights to all sturgeons taken in their realms. Throughout coastal Atlantic waters, by late and post-medieval centuries these mythic ﬁsh had become a rare and sometimes newsworthy catch. Some chefs even then developed recipes “to make sturgeon from veal.”7 Surviving wall paintings at several English parish churches further reﬂect the continued cultural resonance of sturgeon, as its distinctive form stands out among the ﬁshes commonly depicted in waters through which St. Christopher carries the Christ Child.8 Medieval sturgeon populations in the western Mediterranean, notably Italy, may have been more resilient – or just longer adapted to humanized landscapes and human predation. Tenth- and eleventh-century prelates and local potentates laid claim to specimens pulled from nearby rivers: the archbishop of Ravenna, for instance, had preemptive rights over any storionem greater than six feet taken from the Padoreno, a now obliterated tributary of the Po.9 The ﬁsh were deliberately pursued in the late medieval Po, Arno, and Tiber. The latter seems the best studied. Rights to take sturgeon in permanent weirs and traps at Rome’s bridges were distinguished from rights to shad and other migratory ﬁshes. Catches from the delta were valued as well.10 Regulations issued for 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9 10\n\nIbid.; and Susłowska and Urbanowicz, “Szczątki kostne ryb,” 53–65.

Maestro Martino de Como, a Lombard cook in the following generation, included in his recipe collection two for sturgeon which famous Renaissance chef Platina later copied.12 Even in the south yields hint at limited availability. Moralist preacher San Bernardino of Siena in 1425 ranked eating sturgeon among the worst signs of a luxurious path to perdition, and humanist Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini become Pope Pius II (1458–1464) celebrated in his Commentaries the seven “much prized” sturgeons up to 250 ‘pounds’ from the Tiber delta given to him on a visit to Ostia.13 Papal courtier and humanist Paolo Giovio’s erudite but observant 1524 booklet on the Roman ﬁsh market, De romanis piscibus libellus, also celebrated at least the literary reputation and memory of sturgeon from the Tiber.14 Perhaps under long-standing preindustrial conditions Italian sturgeon stocks had stabilized at a level still sufﬁcient for consistent elite use. The medieval tale of sturgeon thus rests on verbal and material evidence of luxury demand and consumption, which led ﬁshers to seek this large and impressive trophy. Actual medieval capture methods and biological knowledge are unrecorded, though plainly effective enough when accompanied by damage to habitat that stocks everywhere diminished. The downward trend appears across the medieval record. This is not to assert local, much less general, extirpation, but that quantitative evidence from the nineteenth century was unlikely to reﬂect a pristine stock. Present-day palaoscience, however, reveals diversity previous consumers or ﬁshers could not know. Giovio and Piccolomini both referred to sturione, employing the vulgar Latin and cognate old Germanic root stur/stor rather than Pliny’s elite Greek-derived acipenser. Their usage followed learned and vernacular nomenclature for all sea sturgeons across western Europe. But Latin\n\n11 12 13\n\n14\n\nLanconelli, “Gli Statuta pescivendulorum urbis,” 116–117 (article 36); Marshall, Local Merchants, 19.

In Poland, for instance, these included the sturgeon documented prior to 1400 in the native Slavic vernacular as jesiotr.15 Until the present century this taxonomic peculiarity remained a mere antiquarian anecdote, as naturalists and after them ﬁsh scientists long understood the entire western European sturgeon population from the Baltic to Italy as a single species, European Atlantic sturgeon. In 1758 Swedish biologist Linnaeus gave it the scientiﬁc name Acipenser sturio.16 Early twenty-ﬁrst-century techniques to extract ancient DNA, however, tell a different story: genetic markers indicate that even by the start of the Neolithic the American Atlantic sturgeon, Acipenser oxyrinchus, had colonized northernmost European coasts. The closely related American species is now thought to have arrived through North Atlantic drift currents during one or more of the cold periods which punctuated transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene, roughly 12,000 years ago. A. oxyrinchus spawns successfully in temperatures some degrees colder than does A. sturio, and by the Middle Ages was dominant in populations from the North and Baltic Seas east to Lake Ladoga. More balanced sympatric (multi-species) stocks formed along the French Atlantic coast.17 Most of the sturgeon eaten by early medieval Slavic princes and some of those claimed by French and English rulers were thus of long present but invasive origin. Both human and natural forces could shape the evolution of medieval ﬁsh and ﬁsheries. Might what looks like the greater adaptability of Mediterranean sturgeons to human predation even have a genetic basis? Genetic diversity could not, however, ward off post-medieval pressures on sea sturgeons in European waters. Ongoing human predation, pollution, and physical modiﬁcations to rivers have since the nineteenth century continued to suppress sturgeon numbers and the size and age of individuals across its range, resulting in incremental extirpation 15 16\n\n17\n\nRostaﬁński, Średniowieczna historia naturalna, pt. 1, p. 402.

In 1991 people took, killed, and proudly ate the last known specimens of A. sturio from both the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The last recorded on the Atlantic coast of Iberia was served in a restaurant in 1992 and the last from the North Sea met a like end the following year. One spawning population may still survive in the Gironde, where, however, the last known success was in 1994, although a juvenile with that genetic marker was taken and released in 2007. Nor do wild American sea sturgeon survive in Europe, as the last in the Baltic was taken in 1996 and in the British Isles in 2005. Of the twenty-ﬁve species in the sturgeon family (Acipenseridae) worldwide, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN ) rates nineteen as endangered or worse and only one as “least concern” for extinction.18 The separate views of medieval commentators, modern archaeozoologists, and recent geneticists trace the fading trail of a ﬁsh of impressive scale, once a key component in estuarine ecosystems, but long coveted by the rich and powerful, so fatally vulnerable.\n\nI.1.2\n\nCommunities, Culture, and Sustained Fishing on Lake Constance\n\nWhile sturgeons never passed the Rhine falls at Schaffhausen, a millennial tale of ﬁshing in medieval Lake Constance (German Bodensee) traces evolving sociocultural approaches to diverse freshwater ecosystems in western and central Europe’s third largest natural lake.19 Now bordered by Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, and thus once near the geographical centre of medieval Latin Christendom, the lake’s two principal basins, Obersee and Untersee, are joined at Constance by a twokilometer strait sometimes called the ‘Lake Rhine’ (Seerhein). With cold depths to 252 metres plus extensive shallows, Lake Constance now supports at least ﬁfty ﬁsh species, while two endemics, a whiteﬁsh and a char, are extinct. Yet this tale is more about humans learning to live with their aquatic neighbours.

At 536 km2 Lake Constance is almost twice the size of Lough Neagh, largest body of water in the British Isles, but only 10% that of Sweden’s Lake Vänern, largest in medieval western Christendom.

Remains of Neolithic pile dwellings along the lake shore and a passing comment from Pliny (Nat. Hist., IX, 29) conﬁrm pre-medieval ﬁshing in Lake Constance, but the story really begins with sub- and post-Roman Alemannic (Swabian) settlement and arrival of Christian missionaries and monastic foundations during the seventh to ninth centuries. By around 800, traditional accounts made much of the ﬁshing by Gall, a companion 200 years earlier to the wandering Irish monk Columbanus. While the party of exiles lived in the dilapidated Roman town of Bregenz, Gall made nets and ﬁshed the lake to supply monks, visitors, and local people alike. When the group left for Italy, illness kept Gall behind. After Gall’s recovery he and a skilled local outdoorsman, the deacon Hiltibod, traveled up the little river Steinach to establish a hermitage and there, too, Gall’s skill with his nets and some miraculous assistance again delivered the necessary rations.20 From local oral tradition later scribes at two great monasteries beside the lake wrote down the Life of St. Gall. A century or more after the holy man’s death a Benedictine house had been founded on the presumed site of his hermitage. By the mid-ninth century royal Carolingian patronage made this abbey of St. Gallen21 a major cultural centre and rival with the bishop of Constance over ﬁshing rights on much of the south shore of the Obersee. Meanwhile since 724 what soon became another great Frankish royal abbey had been established on the island of Reichenau in the Untersee. Monks from the communities of St. Gallen, Reichenau, and the twelfth-century Cistercian foundation of Salem on the north shore of the Obersee provide most of the surviving information about use of the lake’s ﬁsheries into the thirteenth century.22 Knowing that St. Gallen possessed extensive ﬁshing rights in the lake barely ten kilometers away at Rörschach, mid-tenth-century prelates arriving for an inspection assumed the kitchen had ample supplies of ﬁsh. This the monks denied, asserting the lake produced few ﬁsh at great expense, and hoped thereby to excuse their eating meat.23 Two generations later the learned Ekkehard IV (c. 980–c. 1060), who retrospectively reported that tale, was himself well aware of local/regional ﬁshes and their at least occasional presence on monastic tables. Although Ekkehard’s 20 21 22 23\n\nVita Galli, cap. 6–12 and 28, ed. Krusch pp. 252–253, 260–272, and 289–307; tr. Joynt, pp. 72–83 and 103–104.

Most of them were indigenous to Lake Constance, including its distinctive char (“Rubelga”, dialect Rötel), and one of the whiteﬁshes (“Illanch allemannia” reﬂecting dialect “rinanke”, most likely modern so-called Blaufelchen, Coregonus wartmanni26). About the same time as Ekkehard at St. Gallen was cataloging and at least thinking to eat many ﬁshes from the lake,27 over at Reichenau a contingent of ﬁshers, specialized abbey servants, were among the few non-monks permitted to live on the holy island. Their situation, and thus that of people who actually worked at the ﬁshery, becomes clear at some point in the 1140s–50s, when Reichenau set out procedures for its cellarer’s ofﬁce, the agency responsible for the abbey economy.28 Growing hemp to make rope for ﬁshing nets was an obligation of all peasant tenures, while manors along streams tributary to the Untersee were to build boats and provide annual cartloads of stakes and willow branches for making ﬁsh traps. Four ﬁsher’s tenures located on the mainland where the modern causeway leads to the island were to ﬁsh 24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\nIsidore, Etymologiae, lib. 12, cap. 6 (ed. and tr.

Barney et al., pp. 259–263, although the latter’s translations are untrustworthy) mentions more than ﬁfty aquatic taxa, but of those only the grayling (thymallus) and trout (trocta) are to be found in the fresh waters of the upper Rhine basin and only the eel (anguilla) would likely migrate into them.

Duft, Bodensee, 21–23 and 90–91, Schulz, Essen und Trinken, 586–593 (which includes a reprint of Egli’s text), and works there cited correct the reading and contest the interpretation of Egli, “Küchenzettel.” To call this a ‘menu’ is hyperbole, but while Isidore had cobbled together fanciful etymologies of classical Latin names for Mediterranean and mythic aquatic creatures, Ekkehard plainly knew his local ﬁshes (including the beaver (ﬁber piscis), understood as dwelling in water with other ‘ﬁshes’). For one authoritative view of the ‘species swarm’ or sympatry among at least four, possibly six, distinct populations of whiteﬁshes (genus Coregonus) in Lake Constance, see Kottelat and Freyhof, Handbook, 361–364, and more generally 350. Other ﬁsh taxonomists may differ. Sadly, while the monastic library at St. Gallen is rich beyond imagination, the administrative archive normally so useful for environmental and economic historians is notably thin, medieval records reportedly having been discarded in the mid-eighteenth century to free up storage space. Rösener, Grundherrschaft, 223–227 and 234–235, uses the text from Schulte, “Die Urkunde,” 352–353, who showed this so-called Kelleramtordnung was falsely backdated to the ninth century.

In cold seasons they ran the seine through the mouth of the Rhine channel (where prized whiteﬁsh then spawned) but after Easter they worked shoreline reed beds. The labour of servants and subjects with traditional local knowledge served the culturally determined dietary needs of the monks But the economic autarky of the old abbeys was fading. While Cistercians were established in 1138 at Salem, about as far inland from the northwestern arm of the Obersee as St. Gallen was from the south shore, only a century later do the newer abbey’s archives exhibit active interests in the lake ﬁshery. In 1260 a share in a site to pull a seine net near Constance was yielding annual dues of 2,000 whiteﬁsh. When the monks acquired from a local knightly family full control over this site in 1290, it alone annually gave them 15,000 “dried ﬁsh which are commonly called gangﬁsh” (piscium aridorum, qui vulgariter dicuntur gangvische).29 These were not, however, the product of specialized servants, but caught and processed by independent leaseholders (legally termed ‘ﬁef-holders’). While voices of the religious dominate the lake’s early record, less articulate, literate, or durable lay lords and lakeside communities also acquired ﬁshing rights from the crown or by simple undisputed exercise. Common rights of use in the Obersee extended over areas not in the recognized private possession of individuals or urban communities. This comprised all the offshore waters of the main lake basin. While some ordinary citizens of Constance possessed their own private ﬁsheries, the city limited use of its municipal waters to recognized ﬁshers, who had also the right to ﬁsh elsewhere in the lake.30 From at latest some time in the 1200s these artisans sold their catch at a public market on the shore, where archaeologists have turned up remains of pike, carp, and unidentiﬁed members of the carp family (Cyprinidae sp.) older than 1350. Material from this site was not sieved, so whereas large bones of large ﬁshes are identiﬁable, not so the smaller and less durable remains of whiteﬁshes and other species of potential interest.31 Both the documents of traditional history and the material remains of archaeology are 29\n\n30 31\n\nEarly generations of Cistercians were almost entirely vegetarian, eating only tiny amounts of ﬁsh.

By the late thirteenth century, pressures from concentrated urban demand called up local measures to regulate ﬁshing and ﬁsh sales in the interest of consumers and subsequent formation of self-governing ﬁshers’ guilds under town supervision. Guilds in Constance and Lindau emerged as leading voices respectively in the west and east ends of the lake. Ever more people and interests were engaged with the lake’s ﬁsheries. Several late medieval developments and events impinged on human relations with the lake. As elsewhere, growth of even fairly small urban populations concentrated ﬂows of organic efﬂuents into nearby waters. Between the thirteenth century and the sixteenth a lagoon-like shoreline at Constance gradually ﬁlled with town wastes. From layers of those deposits the remains of plants native to clean waters gradually disappear, replaced by a ﬁlamentous algae closely associated with strongly eutrophic or polluted conditions.32 Consumer doubts about sharp business practices on the waterfront surface in a satirical dialect poem from about 1400. In Des Teufels Netz the devil explains how he drags off to hell in his net sinners of all sorts: ﬁshers and ﬁshmongers end up there for taking both small and large ﬁsh, keeping the catch too long in their boats, and splashing dead ﬁsh with water to appear fresh on the sale table. Honest dealers, though, evade the devil by smoking the dead ones to make the dried ﬁsh good to eat.33 Then in 1414 a council of the western church assembled in Constance to resolve, among other matters, the competitive presence of not two but three rival popes. Some 600 prelates, princes, professors, and ambassadors plus untold servants and hangers-on streamed into a town with probably closer to three than ﬁve thousand inhabitants. Many visitors stayed for almost four years. Their dietary needs likely tested even the honest ﬁshmongers and the entire lake-based ecosystem. According to eyewitness burger Ulrich Richental, a joint commission of church and town councillors so managed markets and prices of victuals, notably including ﬁsh, that neither inﬂation nor supply shortage marred the council sessions. When bread went for a pfennig the loaf, and beef at 3pf the pound, the lake supplied pike, carp, tench, bream and the larger whiteﬁsh called felchen at 12–20 pf the pound and several small species such as gudgeon or dace at 24–27pf the ‘measure’.

Imports were necessary: salt sturgeon from Lombardy; large and small stockvisch, meaning air- or salt-dried headless cod from Norway, Iceland, or shores of the North Sea; brined herring; and from Verona the big Lake Garda trout preserved in oil.34 If not earlier the case, the council brought ﬁshing and ﬁsh consumption around Lake Constance into a western European network of trade in preserved ﬁshes from widely scattered aquatic ecosystems. Whether triggered by the council or not, ensuing human generations around the lake undertook precocious vernacular writings on local ﬁshes, both when to eat them and how to catch them. Already in 1416 Johannes Schenklin, a cleric at Wil, managerial centre of the St. Gallen abbot’s estates, glossed into a liturgical manuscript a Nota de piscibus, calendaring the two best to eat in each month. Of the two dozen varieties, all named in dialect, one cannot now be identiﬁed, three (huchen, salmon, and eel) were not native or present in Lake Constance but available nearby, and the remaining twenty all indigenous, ﬁve in genus Coregonus. In ensuing decades Schenklin’s list was at least twice recopied into other St. Gallen manuscripts.35 A choir monk, Gall Kemly, was more original, writing up in 1469 and again shortly before his death in 1477 a catalog “On varieties of ﬁshes and the time for eating them” (De piscium generibus et tempore comestionis ipsorum) with seasonal and culinary advice about twenty-seven locally available ﬁshes.36 Compared to Ekkehard some four centuries earlier these independent texts share much greater familiarity with the lake’s diverse taxa and local vernacular taxonomy. An anonymous mid-century townsman whose dialect and references indicate he lived near the lake’s outlet considered the other end of the cultural processes which transformed ﬁshes from swimming organisms to a diner’s plate. This fellow assembled a memorandum of twenty-nine recipes of baits “Vische zů vahen” (“to catch ﬁsh”). Into a loose collection 34 35\n\n36\n\nRichental, Konzilschronik, facsimile fols. 22b–26a; Loomis tr., pp. 98–101, misidentiﬁes several of the ﬁshes.

For commentary, not necessarily well informed of ﬁshes or other early writings on them, see Wickersheimer, “Zur Fischdiätetik,” 414–415, and Duft, Bodensee, 23 and 91.

At the end of our period Gregor Mangolt, a Protestant bookseller exiled from Habsburg Constance in 1548, assembled both the capture and the cooking of the lake’s ﬁshes into a single Fischbouch.38 This illustrated and soon printed handbook brought the regional ﬁshery into the sixteenth-century discourse of an emerging scientiﬁc ichthyology. Intensiﬁed contemporary concern for regional ﬁsh supplies manifested itself in several ways. Ulrich Rösch, abbot of St. Gallen 1463–1491, is credited with restoring the abbey’s long-neglected governance and economy, so laying the foundation for its early modern survival as a religious community and lordship. His regard for ﬁsheries was reﬂected in acquisition and revindication of ﬁshing rights on the lake and close supervision of the ﬁshing ‘ﬁefs’ let out for annual rents in ﬁsh or cash. Sadly, the internal management records which would reveal the operation of abbey ﬁsheries during his tenure as abbot or earlier as cellarer (1453–1463) survive only in fragments. The kitchen ordinance Rösch instituted about 1480 called for ﬁsh in the regular weekly round of meals on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. His kitchen master was to buy herring and stockﬁsh as needed and serve the latter at least once a week.39 Seeking more secure and ample supplies of fresh ﬁsh, in 1483 Rösch undertook to move the entire abbey to lakeside Rörschach (for barely ﬁve years until angry townsmen tore down the still half-built structure).40 The abbot further sought to increase ﬁsh supplies by constructing ponds (Weiher) on many abbey properties, some of them meant to rear 37\n\n38\n\n39 40\n\nHoffmeister, “Fischer- und Tauchertexte,” provides an introduction and transcription of Donaueschingen Schlossbibliothek cod. 792, fols. 48r–55v.

Other Swiss landowners since at latest the 1460s were obtaining juvenile carp from Lake Constance to stock their own ponds.41 Financial records from Salem covering 1489–1530 likewise document not only extensive ﬁshponds but regular purchases of dried cod and brined herring as well as heavy Lenten consumption of the lake’s own gangvisch and felchen.42 Persistent and widespread concern for ﬁsh supplies in the growing and prosperous region around ﬁfteenth-century Lake Constance provided context for an accelerating shift from open exploitation or local guild and municipal control of ﬁsheries to collective joint management of the lake for sake of sustainability.43 Having established their own regimes to protect consumers and reduce disruptive conﬂicts among ﬁshers, towns and guilds began in mid-century to impose rules protecting young ﬁsh, bleak, perch, and whiteﬁsh, by seasonal closures and bans on speciﬁc kinds of nets. Minimum sizes and maximum legitimate catches ensued. With so much of the main lake open to common use – though effectively accessible only to well-equipped professionals – individual jurisdictions had, however, limited effect. Multilateral agreements among urban and seigneurial powers curbed competition and eased enforcement. Constance, Überlingen, and the principalities of Salem, Mainau, and Heiligenberg entered into a regulatory treaty in 1481. The parties’ enlarged agreement of 1536 was emulated for the lake’s eastern end under Lindau’s leadership (1537). Abbey lordships did likewise, with Reichenau setting rules for the Untersee about 1450 and reﬁning their terms at decadal or shorter intervals. St. Gallen turned its own regulations into a treaty for the entire south shore in 1544. This regulatory regime lasted into the nineteenth century and then only gave way to an international joint commission. As early as 1531 the master of the Constance ﬁshers’ guild clearly articulated in a letter to his counterpart in Überlingen the rationale underlying all the regulatory measures: “Were all other ﬁshers to hold to such an ordinance and spare the young ﬁshes, this lake would again be as rich in ﬁsh as it is otherwise almost emptied [of them].” Pointing out that one winter’s protection of young perch yielded ﬁshers of Thurgau many more adults the next summer, he continued, “A like idea also\n\n41 42 43\n\nAmacher, “Teichwirtschaft,” 83.

A pail of juveniles left uncaught would a year later give a heap of gangvisch.”44 For more than 500 years medieval residents around Lake Constance saw ideological and economic value in its ﬁshes. This motivated their cultural interest and institutional structures to exploit this resource. People of the lake were familiar with various ﬁsh varieties, knew how to catch them, and ways to get that catch from the water to consumers both promptly and in preserved form also for later use. By the last medieval centuries, if not before, they were aware of their own effect on the resource. As well as considering substitutes reared in artiﬁcial ponds or imported from afar, these medieval Europeans devised methods to sustain natural wild stocks. The latter strategy even transcended competition between different groups among ﬁshers and among consumers. While challenged by human impacts in subsequent ages, Lake Constance remains a viable ﬁshery a half-millennium later still. I.1.3\n\nFrom Fish to Commodity\n\nUnlike sturgeon or whiteﬁshes, cod are probably familiar, at least on the dining table, to many present consumers – or would be if more ﬁsheries still survived and marketers less pirated the well-known name to apply to more or less distantly related white-ﬂeshed ﬁshes from elsewhere. Atlantic cod is a marine creature, so ﬁtting the modernist misapprehension of most consumers and writers that ﬁsh of economic signiﬁcance always come from the sea. Atlantic cod are bottom-oriented open ocean apex predators in a range along shorelines and continental shelves spanning cold North Atlantic waters.45 Without here going into detail, historically important stocks include those off arctic Norway, around Iceland, in the North Sea, and on the oceanic banks between Newfoundland and Cape Cod. Where abundant, cod are considered keystone species, as their predation shapes relationships among other animals in their ecosystem. Recent research has shown cod to be highly sensitive to temperature ﬂuctuations and other environmental stresses. Diners can enjoy the delicate white ﬂesh of cod for the same reason it can easily be preserved by drying or salting: ﬁsh of the cod family 44\n\n45\n\nWiewol ich achten wo all ander vischer wer wie ain ordnung hielten und volab der jugent vischenten dieser [See] werd wider vischrich so er sunst vast erlärt ist … Ain gliche maindg hats ouch mit den selen und andern vischen.

The deepest history of cod ﬁshing and consumption belongs to arctic Norway, where seasonal nearshore spawning concentrations of large cods and frigid but dry late winter conditions enabled coast dwellers since the Bronze Age to produce stockﬁsh, the board-like slabs of cod dried without need for salt. Up to modern times ﬁshers took cod with baited hooks sunk to the bottom, whether on individual hand lines or long lines with many hooks. Processing into stockﬁsh leaves middens of skeletal remains (heads, anterior vertebrae) which identify a key subsistence good and the store of capital behind Iron Age chieftaincies there. Ninth-century Norse settlers in Orkney and Iceland carried with them the same pattern of resource use.46 Europeans elsewhere then made no signiﬁcant efforts to exploit inshore stocks of smaller cod. The Viking Age (c. 800–1080) initiated a southwards expansion of taste for cod, followed by export of northern stockﬁsh to societies in northwestern Europe.47 Tenth-century trash heaps where Scandinavians settled in eastern England and northern Scotland held remains of headless cods (i.e. stockﬁsh), but ensuing generations at York and London substituted local catches of cods and other gadids from the North Sea.48 By sometime in the twelfth century ﬁshing for cod had become ubiquitous in those waters, with at least some of the take salted down for future consumption or commerce.49 Norwegian exports grew simultaneously. During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries large shipments of northern stockﬁsh passed regularly through Bergen to consumers in England, north Germany, and the Baltic. Traders from the Hanse towns of northern Germany handled the greater share, followed by the English, but as the one legal point of exchange Bergen grew into Norway’s chief urban and commercial centre. All of these ﬁsheries and trades achieved their highest volume in decades around 1300, when human numbers also reached their medieval zenith.

During late medieval centuries consumption of cod deepened in some western regions and spread haltingly eastwards and southwards into places where no such ﬁsh ever lived. Origins and features of the product changed as well. Consumption of Nordic cods at London and York peaked in the early 1300s, when stockﬁsh from Iceland ﬁrst entered the market. After some post-plague generations of diminished demand, English consumption of northern catches, now mainly of Icelandic origin, revived only brieﬂy in the mid-ﬁfteenth century. Much more salt-dried or even wet-salted cod from stocks around the British Isles more than took up any slack, since about 1400 this species surpassed herring as the principal source of ﬁsh ﬂesh in English diets. Boat owners in both eastern and southwestern England replaced crews working on shares with individually hired hands. As DNA analysis of cod remains from the Mary Rose (sank 1545) has brought home, after 1500 large cod of Atlantic origin supplemented regional sources of supply. Across the northern European mainland, too, ﬁfteenth-century markets and tables came to hold cod in different preserved forms from various distant and local sources.51 After centuries of lag, from around 1400 cod did begin to penetrate more southerly markets and diets. This growth relied as much on use of salt to preserve catches from coastal stocks as it did on expansion of the dried stockﬁsh industry. In interior central Europe, stockﬁsh were among the victuals with managed prices during the Council of Constance, but the Alsatian chef there hired by the council’s elected pope reported they were for Thuringians, Hessians, and Swabians, not the French or Italians.52 An occasional stockﬁsh recipe crops up in ﬁfteenth-century 50\n\n51\n\n52\n\nOn Norwegian exports, see Nedkvitne, Hansa and Bergen, 25–96, and summarized in his “Development.” For the Baltic the vast historiography on Hanseatic trade receives material content in Holm, “Commercial sea ﬁsheries,” 18–19; Makowiecki et al., “Cod and herring,” 123–129; and Lõugas, “Fishing and ﬁsh trade.” For sparse representation of cod on Flemish markets and sites until the very late 1400s see Van Neer and Ervynck, “Rise of sea-ﬁsh consumption,” 159–167.

Further to the south and west the prevalent preserved white-ﬂeshed ﬁsh was hake, the resident bottomoriented predatory gadid in the Channel Approaches and Bay of Biscay. Historical confusion reigns when incautious modern writers translate merluz, merluccio, and like words as ‘stockﬁsh’, not the distinctly smaller hake taken and salt-dried by ﬁshers from Cornwall and Brittany south to Galicia and Portugal.53 In Spain and Italy, as in France, salt-dried cod were a new product characteristic of the sixteenth century. Papal courtier Paolo Giovio, whom we met praising the sturgeons of Rome, may epitomize the ambiguity and transition to a stiff and headless commodity: Also there are brought from the bounds of Sweden and Norway arm-long merlucciae, so hard and stretched out as to be like boards, which we see to be the choice of the Germans who inhabit the city.54\n\nEven in 1524 the ﬁsh of far northern origin remained alien to native Romans. An age of baccalà was yet to come. In any case, this commodity was far far away from any living ﬁsh elsewhere called cod. Even as Giovio wrote the cod tale was changing. In a story less widely known than it deserves, a Venetian navigator ﬁnanced in part by Bristol merchants whom Hanseatic competition had squeezed out of the Bergen market and Icelandic ﬁshery found his way to a bonanza of cod in the western Atlantic and back to England to spread the news. One of Zuan Caboto’s English crewmen in 1497 told a Spanish intelligence agent of unimaginable abundance off the “New found land,” which would free English mariners and markets from dependence on Iceland. The Cabot circle would later speak of “inﬁnite ﬁsh.”55 First to exploit the hitherto untouched Grand Banks were Portuguese (1506), Normans (1508), Basques and Bretons (1511). Yet within a generation relations between humans and ﬁsh in the northwest Atlantic were transformed.56 Soon French, English, Spanish, and eventually American boats and ﬂeets would compete for those rich schools through a half-millennium. By the late sixteenth century European markets, diets, coastal settlements, and 53\n\n54\n\n55 56\n\nSee for instance Kowaleski, “Expansion”; Hocquet, “Pêcheries médiévales,” 86–87, 96–98, and 111–112; Kerhervé, L’État breton, 686–692; and Ferreira Priegue, “Pesca y economia.” Adducuntur quoque ex ﬁnibus Gothiae atque Norvegiae cubitales merlucciae, adeo durae et extentae, ut fustibus assimilentur, quas in delitiis Germanorum, qui Urbem incolunt, esse videmus.

Salt-dried cod went to markets in Spain, Portugal, Italy, southern France, and eventually to Caribbean plantations as rations for slaves. The English colony become Commonwealth of Massachusetts would make a sculptured golden cod a symbol of its autonomy, but what reached distant consumers were hard, headless, salt-encrusted slabs. Fast forward ﬁve centuries: environmentally aware consumers now think of cod ﬁsheries in terms of competition and collapse. While ﬁsheries experts and contemporary historians continue to debate the relative roles in the cod debacle of the late twentieth century of overﬁshing, of mismanagement, and of environmental change (regional ﬂuctuations in water temperatures),57 in a longer view all this was ‘new’ only in scale. Since documented European discovery of the banks between New England and Newfoundland, the prevalent cultural regime has sought to satisfy as much demand and to ﬁsh as intensively, as available technologies for capture and preservation would allow. Perhaps already by 1600 and surely in the late seventeenth century and again from the midnineteenth, shortfalls in catches caused some local observers to worry about disruption of aquatic life and future depletion. But each time new technologies and practices (long multi-hook lines, nets and trawls, steam power, factory ships), new ﬁshing frontiers (further offshore, further north, longer seasons), and a shared desire for wealth and prosperity pushed the catches up, changed the sense of normal abundance (what ecologists call the ‘shifting baseline syndrome’), and let both decisionmakers and ﬁshers set aside all doubts.58 The ever greater distance of investors, managers, and consumers from the waters and from the live animals made decisions easier, too. The sorry tale of late twentieth-century cod is a reasonably clear progression from the late ﬁfteenth-century arrival of medieval Europeans in the western Atlantic and its ‘inﬁnite ﬁsh’. But what lay behind this evolution? Had it anything to do with European experience of the cod and, by reasonable extension, other ﬁsheries during the previous medieval millennium? How and why the parallels between the long demise of the sturgeon and the collapse of the cod in one-third the time? What had ﬁshers of Lake Constance been able to learn and others not?\n\n57 58\n\nRose, Cod: The Ecological History; Bavington, “From hunting ﬁsh to managing populations” and Managed Annihilation.

Sea sturgeons swam at the centre of a story of human desire to possess and consume an impressive, very distinctive ﬁsh. Common people worked in the natural world so medieval elites of wealth and power could enjoy this increasingly rare trophy. Attributes of the animal itself framed human efforts and impacts on aquatic ecosystems as well as the response of sturgeon populations to those pressures. The tale of Lake Constance revolved around medieval communities living beside a particular water body and turning to it for important corporeal and cultural needs. They successively adapted techniques and skills to exploit diverse ﬁsh stocks within their evolving sociopolitical structures – subsistence, lordships, urban markets – and their cultural understandings. Aware of pressures on resources, leading elements in regional society responded in several practical ways. Even in the cursory form given here the three-act story of cod covered the longest time and widest stage. Millennia of local subsistence use anchored the narrative and even some of its durable technical features off northern coastal Norway. Across ﬁve subsequent medieval centuries northern ﬁshing evolved into commercial production of a standardized commodity for long-distance trade even as its methods came to be emulated by regional societies elsewhere in the ﬁsh’s range. Better access to resources (salt) let late adopters develop superior (or at least cheaper) techniques for preservation and thus commerce. Fishers but especially traders in cod early helped build a European network of interregional trade later joined by, for instance, the Lake Constance ﬁshery. The end of the Middle Ages initiated a new ﬁve-century global expansion of cod which widened the gap – spatial, economic, perceptual – separating the animal and its ﬁshers from the commodity and its consumers. Competitive conﬂicts meant dominant interest groups (nations, investors, traders) responded to successive waves of depletion with separate, even contradictory, technological and ﬁnally reluctant regulatory measures. Every historic aspect, attribute, and evolution in these ﬁsh tales will recur in the wider exploration of western Christendom’s encounters with its aquatic environments. Different habitats affect biodiversity and the resources accessible to local human communities. Economic institutions evolved differently across Europe’s many regions. Species characteristics and consumption patterns shaped potential for innovation in catching, preserving, and marketing ﬁsh. Some themes can be seen as shared\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108955898.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n20\n\nThe Catch\n\nacross broad areas, but the particulars will differ. Medieval ﬁsheries are not all one story. The tales simply indicate some patterns and variations. Each tale has further been informed by a conﬂuence of methods and data sets. These few pages have drawn upon ichthyology and ecology of present experience with ﬁshes as well as the methods and ﬁndings of archaeozoology which can make sense of recovered remains of ﬁshes long dead and (mostly) eaten. In the traditional historians’ written record critical readings of various documentary types and genres indicated something of past writers’ purposes, perceptions, and unintentional assumptions, even ignorance, regarding the natural world in general and ﬁshes in particular. Integrated with these anthropogenic remnants of the medieval European past are the ﬁndings of palaeoscience, the present-day recovery of natural features such as ancient DNA, climate proxies, trace elements, and stable isotopes unimagined by medieval people. The interdisciplinary approaches deployed as opportune in the fairly simple ﬁsh tales will help call up a more diverse but interwoven understanding of people and ﬁshes across western Christendom’s medieval millennium and something of the legacy their experiences, actions, and consequences left for their future, which is our present. From northern Norway to Sicily and Ireland to the Danube, European habitats held a multiplicity of aquatic creatures. Medieval regional vernacular cultures knew equally variegated vocabularies for those animals and for the means by which people caught them. Though acknowledging both the biogeographical integrity of European waters and the cultural unities of western Latin Christendom, most studies of ﬁsh and ﬁsheries and nearly all of those with historical or antiquarian intent have (understandably) been local, regional, or at most national in scope. Yet only rare highly localized species are conﬁned to a single country, and many European watersheds and coasts encompass several modern (and medieval) polities.59 National, regional or single-species studies – Danish\n\n59\n\nRobinson and Starkey, “Sea ﬁsheries of the British Isles,” 121–122, in 1996 rightly criticized their predecessors for lack of context and narrowly national perspectives. Their essay and the ongoing research and publications such as Roberts, Unnatural History of the Sea (2007) and works of the History of Marine Animals Project (HMAP) actively and successfully build toward broader and more ecologically informed approaches (see, for example, Holm et al., “Marine animal populations,” 3–23).
