Umumnya saat tersebut akibat situasi politis saat perang pembebasan Vietnam Selatan 1963-1975 pada umumnya rakyat Vietnam sangat takut menyimpan arsip pribadi terkait perang tersebut yang dapat menjadi bukti mereka terlibat sebagai kolaburator tentara Amerika Serikat dan pasukan Republik Vietnam Selatan dan para pejuang pembebasan Vietnam Selatan akan menuduh mereka mata-mata Amerika Serikat dengan akibat yang merugikan sipemilik.salah satu photo menarik saat kendaraan truck perang USA sedang diseberangkan liwat sungai Mekong,di mekong Delta dibawah ini.\n\n2.One of a AVRN Military postal history have found by the writers during visit Ho Chi Minh city (before Saigon) have gave the motivation to write the special book for Indonesian,Vietnam and USA postal history collectors and another collectors from all over the world. Please look that cover illustration below.\n\nSalah satu koleksi pos militer yang ditemui oleh penulis saat kunjungan kedua tahun 2008 di Ho Chi Minh city memberikan motivasi untuk menulis suatu buku khusus untuk kolektor phillatelis di Indonesia,Vietnam dan Amerika Serikat serta lainnya.\n\n3.After the Vietnam Liberation War finish in 1975, many stamp and postal history collectors Collected the collection as the factual fact of history, one of the USA collectors have illustrated his AVRN military Postal History and the picture of the sender Lee Ming Dao, in internet IMNAHA Mr Andrew Cresshow.let look one of his collection have sent to me below.\n\nSesudah perang Pembebasan Vietnam Selatan berakhir ditahun 1975 , mulailah banyak kolektor prangko dan benda-benda pos yang terkait sejarah mengumpulkan koleksi yang merupakan data faktual, salah seorang kolektor yang koleksinya ditampilkan dalam situs IMNAHA Andrew Cresshow menampilkan koleksi pos milter Vietnam selatan yang disingkat dengan AVRN.lihat salah satu koleksinya yang dikirimkan pada penulis.\n\n4.In 1974, I have met with the Indonesian National Police officer which told me that his friend also from National Police province Riouw Sumatra that time just on duty as the UN peace Force at Saigon (ICCS) and he gave me a ICCS Postal History which send by his friend, base on this first postal history I starting collect another special Vietnam War collections.

The NVA used several 12.7mm antiaircraft weapons to oppose the helicopter assaults though the ground units initially received on light resistance. Both the ARVNs and the Marines added more infantry and artillery units. There were several major battles. Artillery and tactical air strikes were used sometimes on a continuous basis. This was the first USMC contact with the NVA. By the end, the allied forces claimed to have killed nearly 600 NVA, captured five and 49 weapons including three 12.7mm machine guns and two mortars. They found two huge cave complexes that had been used by the NVA. The Marine casualties were 98 dead and 278 wounded, while the ARVN lost 30 killed and 120 wounded. At least one F-4 and several helicopters were shot down.\n\n(Wounded grunts of India 3/7 during Operation Utah)\n\nVIETNAM WAR 1967\n\nFebruary 8, 1967\n\nOperation LAM SON II terminated. It was a combined US/ARVN security operation that\n\nlasted 259 day in Binh Duong Province. Friendly losses were 70 killed and 339 wounded.\n\nEnemy losses were 251 killed, 198 prisoners, 1,450 detained, 49 individual and\n\n8 crew-served weapons.\n\n(The band of the 1st Infantry Division playing at a county fair in\n\nTan Phuoc Khanh village during LAM SON II)\n\nVIETNAM WAR 1968\n\nJanuary 31, 1968\n\nBattle for Hue. The battle began at 0340 with a 122mm rocket attack followed by two bns from the NVA 6th Regt charging across lightly defended bridges and taking part of the Imperial Citadel. They were halted by the ARVN Hoc Bo (Black Panther) Co at the Tay Loc airfield before they could reach the ARVN 1st Div HQ. The NVA 4th Regt struck the MACV HQ defended by a makeshift force of 200 Americans. The USMC base at Phu Bai responded by sending one Inf Co reinforced with 4 tanks. When this force was pinned down, a second Co with 2 SP 40mm guns were dispatched. Six hours later with 10 KIA and 30 WIA this unit reached the MACV compound. At nightfall, the NVA consolidated their positions eventually committing 10 bns (more than a full division) to the Citadel battles. The allies countered with 3 understrength USMC, 6 USA and 11 ARVN bns.During this battle the 1st and the 5th Marines and several ARVN elements defended and drove the enemy out of Hue City as the largest major action of the enemy Tet Offensive. Several USA units from the 1st Cav and 101st Abn Divs were involved blocking position and cutting enemy supply lines to the west and nouth of Hue. The allies claimed 5,113 known enemy casualties in this battle. U.S. losses were 119 KIA, 961 WIA; ARVN were 363 KIA and 1,242 WIA; Civilian 5,800 KIA or MIA and 116,000 homeless.\n\n__________________\n\nVIETNAM WAR 1969\n\nBy the summer of 1968, after the enemy’s Tet Offensive, Marine Corps strength in Vietnam rose to about 85,000. The Marine withdrawal began in 1969 as the South Vietnamese began to assume a larger role in the fighting.\n\n.\n\n_________________________________\n\nVIETNAM WAR 1970\n\nC.VIETNAM WAR 1970\n\nIconic image … Australian soldiers group at Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy province awiting helicopter support for Operation Puckapunyal circa 1970, during the Vietnam War.

A cease-fire would go into effect the following morning, and two months later, on March 29, 1973, the last U.S. military unit would leave Vietnam. The two-decade-long Vietnam War would finally come to an end two years later, and in 1976 the country was reunited as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. In the course of the war, more than 3 million people died (including 58,000 Americans), with more than half of them being civilians.\n\nOn this 38th anniversary of the Paris Accord, we take a look inside Britannica’s archive and bring you some photos from the Vietnam War.\n\nAssault boats being used as river patrol as U.S. Marines move inland during the final phase of exercise Jungle Drum III, southern Thailand, March 20, 1965\n\nby David Venditta\n\nMarshal of ACG – XO\n\nReal Name: Shan Hackett\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2002\n\nLocation: Ginkel Heath\n\nPosts: 14,373\n\nSeptember 18, 1969\n\nOperation KEYSTONE CARDINAL, Redeployment Increment II, begins.\n\nThe 28th ROK Regiment begins Operation DO KAE BI 1-14 in Phu Yen Province.\n\nThe 44th ARVN Special Tactical Zone begins Operation QUYET THANG/44/43 in Chau Doc Province.\n\n__________________\n\n– Vietnam Combat Operations –\n\n– The ten best songs ever written –\n\n>>Boonie’s Indie Juke Box<<\n\nPS.\n\n1.THE INTERNATIONAL COLLECTORS WHO WANT TO BUY THIS LIMITED BOOK,PLEASE SUBSCRIBED AS PREMIUM MEMBER AND SEND YOUR NAME AND ADRESS.

The 50th Years First Kosmonout\n\nFrame Two :\n\nInternational Collections\n\nApril 12th is remember Yuri Gagarin day! first man in space!!!\n\nHuman Spaceflight became a reality on April 12, 1961, with the launch of a bell-shaped capsule called “Vostok 1.”Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space! Yuri made his historic 108 minute flight (orbiting around the whole Earth once) and parachute landed near his Vostok 1 capsule in the plains of Russia. This flight made him the first human to orbit the Earth and an international hero. Yuri was only 27 years old.\n\nExactly 20 years later, the United States embarked on a new era in spaceflight with the inaugural launch of a new type of spaceship — the Space Shuttle. Designed to carry a larger crew and large volumes of cargo to orbit, the Space Shuttles became synonymous with human spaceflight for an entirely new generation of young people.\n\nToday, all over the country and world people are celebrating space and exploration!!!\n\nhere is an example of some of the parties:\n\nIn Mission Control we had a countdown to the first party in Sydney, and then they just continued to roll around the planet. Melbourne had a posh affair with space cocktails; the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station did a toast; Cape Town celebrated with a space wedding complete with a Shuttle cake; Vancouver, London, Leiden, Istanbul, Bröllin, and Dublin all had large dance parties; Boston put on a full day of events; and in Houston even the NASA brass showed up to get down.\n\nIn LA they had the Lunar Rover parked out front, the live webcast of the event and the interviews with VIPs being broadcast around the world, the most kicking DJs who rocked the house, an awesome crowd that just loved the music and the vibe, amazing video work of our historical, current and fictional space footage projected on the main screen, an excellent laser system, and the best silver bikini clad go-go dancers in the Milky Way.\n\nIn the Sign of the Red Star: On the Iconographic Coding of the Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin\n\nFifty years ago, on April 12, Yuri Gagarin became the first man to orbit the earth. Walter Famler in Eurozine:\n\nOn 12 April 1961, a rocket weighing 287 tons rises from the launching pad. However only a few people know the secret of the name of the world’s first cosmonaut. Not even the wife and parents of the 27 year-old pilot have been informed as the space ship, marked Vostok 1, ascends into the sky. When it has circled the earth and 108 minutes later has landed on a Russian field, Gagarin becomes world famous. Immediately after the launch, the Soviet news agency TASS cables the announcement of the first manned space journey around the globe. The fact that the mission narrowly escaped disaster because the capsule almost burnt up on re-entering the earth’s atmosphere becomes known only decades later.\n\nTwo days after his flight, Gagarin is received in the Kremlin by Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party and Soviet Premier. His journey of several kilometres through Moscow in an open car adorned with flowers turns into a triumphal procession; masses of cheering people form an honour guard from the airport to the Red Square. While still in orbit, Gagarin has been promoted to major, and now the Order of Lenin and the Gold Star of a Hero of the Soviet Union are pinned to his chest. Half a century later, when you look at the old newsreels, the youthful officer with open shoelaces walking down the red carpet and leaping up the steps to the Lenin Mausoleum, saluting with a smile and announcing his return, looks more than ever as if he comes from a different universe.\n\nAt first, Gagarin enjoys his popularity. Soon, however, he experiences the greatest possible contradiction between collective and individual. From nowhere he becomes a “pop star” in a system that defines the individual only as the product of society and in the long term is unable to cope with the singularity of a phenomenon of this dimension.\n\nFrame Three:\n\nThe History Of Sputnic Program\n\n1957\n\nThe Sputnik Program\n\n(Created by Thomas Alcorn, )\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n1931 The International Council for Science (ICSU) is founded to promote international scientific activity in the different branches of science and its application for the benefit of humanity. 3 October 1942 German V-2 rocket is the first ballistic missile, and the first man-made object launched into space. 1952 ICSU proposes the International Geophysical Year (IGY): a series of global geophysical activities to span the period July 1957 – December 1958. 27 May 1954 Russian Sergei Korolev proposes development of an artificial Earth satellite to Soviet Minister of Defense Industries Dimitrii Ustinov. 29 July 1955 U.S. President Eisenhower’s press secretary announces that the U.S. will launch an artificial Earth satellite during the IGY. 21 August 1957 Soviets launch the R-7 Semyorka, the first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 4 October 1957 Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 is launched into space via an R-7 missile. About the size of a basketball, this is the first artificial Earth satellite. It weighs 184 pounds and takes about 98 minutes to complete one orbit. The launch of this satellite sparks the USA/USSR competition known as the “Space Race”. 3 November 1957 Sputnik 2 is launched, carrying the first living earth passenger to space, a dog named Laika. Laika perished while achieving orbit, becoming the 1st space casualty. 31 January 1958 The first successful U.S. satellite launch puts Explorer 1 into space. 15 May 1958 Sputnik 3 is launched, carrying a large array of instruments for geophysical research. 29 July 1958 U.S. President Eisenhower signs National Aeronautics and Space Act, creating NASA. 18 December 1958 U.S. Project SCORE (Signal Communications Orbit Relay Equipment) is launched on an Atlas rocket. This is the world’s first communications satellite, which broadcasts a taped Christmas message from President Eisenhower via shortwave back to Earth. 15 May 1960 Sputnik 4 is launched, designed to investigate the means for manned space flight. It contained scientific instruments, a television system, and a self-sustaining biological cabin with a “dummy” of a man. The guidance system malfunctioned, and the capsule that should have returned to earth went deeper into orbit. The capsule eventually re-entered the atmosphere 2 years later. There is evidence that suggests that this flight was actually manned by a human. 19 August 1960 Sputnik 5 is launched, carrying 40 mice, 2 rats, the dogs Belka and Strelka, and various plants. All passengers survived the flight, returning to earth the next day. 12 April 1961 Soviet Vostok 1 is launched carrying the official first human into space, Yuri A. Gagarin. 5 May 1961 U.S. Launches Freedom 7 Capsule atop a Mercury-Redstone rocket putting the first American into space, Alan B. Shepard, Jr. 20 February 1962 U.S. Launches Friendship 7 piloted by John Glenn who becomes the first American to orbit the Earth. 16 June 1963 Soviet Vostok 6 is launched carrying the first woman into space, Valentina Tereshkova. 26 July 1963 US launches Syncom-2, the worlds first geosynchronous satellite. 24 April 1990 Hubble Space Telescope is launched. While the telescope is successfully deployed, the primary mirror is seriously flawed resulting in fuzzy images. 18 May 1996 X Prize competition announced: 10 Million dollars to the first person or team to safely launch and land a spacecraft capable of carrying three people to a suborbital altitude or 100km and repeat the trip again within two weeks. This contest is designed to inspire and jump start civilian and commercial space programs. 21 June 2004 SpaceShipOne becomes the first privately funded vehicle to carry a human into space. This U.S. licensed ship is piloted by American Mike Melvill.\n\n1957\n\nThe Sputnik Program\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n1931 The International Council for Science (ICSU) is founded to promote international scientific activity in the different branches of science and its application for the benefit of humanity. 3 October 1942 German V-2 rocket is the first ballistic missile, and the first man-made object launched into space. 1952 ICSU proposes the International Geophysical Year (IGY): a series of global geophysical activities to span the period July 1957 – December 1958. 27 May 1954 Russian Sergei Korolev proposes development of an artificial Earth satellite to Soviet Minister of Defense Industries Dimitrii Ustinov. 29 July 1955 U.S. President Eisenhower’s press secretary announces that the U.S. will launch an artificial Earth satellite during the IGY. 21 August 1957 Soviets launch the R-7 Semyorka, the first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 4 October 1957 Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 is launched into space via an R-7 missile.

After being selected for Air Force Group 1, he became the first human to journey into outer space when his Vostok spacecraft launched successfully and completed an orbit of the Earth on April 12, 1961. After re-entry, Gagarin ejected from the craft and landed safely by parachute.\n\nAfter the mission, Gagarin became an international celebrity, and was awarded many medals and honours, including Hero of the Soviet Union. Vostok 1 marked his only spaceflight, but he served as backup to the Soyuz 1 mission, which ended in a fatal crash. Gagarin later became deputy training director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow which was later named after him.\n\nGagarin died when his training jet crashed in 1968. The precise cause of the crash is uncertain, but investigators have proposed various explanations.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n\n2 Career in the Soviet space program\n\n2.1 Selection and training\n\n2.2 Space flight\n\n2.3 Rise to fame\n\n2.4 Life after Vostok 1\n\n3 Death\n\n3.1 Cause of jet crash\n\n4 Legacy and tributes\n\n5 See also\n\nEarly life\n\nGagarin was born in the village of Klushino near Gzhatsk (now in Smolensk Oblast, Russia), on 9 March 1934.[2] The adjacent town of Gzhatsk was renamed Gagarin in 1968 in his honour. His parents, Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina, worked on a collective farm.[3] While manual labourers are described in official reports as “peasants”, this may be an oversimplification if applied to his parents — his mother was reportedly a voracious reader, and his father a skilled carpenter. Yuri was the third of four children, and his elder sister helped raise him while his parents worked. Like millions of people in the Soviet Union, the Gagarin family suffered during Nazi occupation in World War II. After a German officer took over their house, the family constructed a small mud hut where they spent a year and nine months until the end of the occupation.[4] His two older siblings were deported to Nazi Germany for slave labour in 1943, and did not return until after the war. In 1946, the family moved to Gzahtsk.[4]\n\nWhile a youth, Yuri became interested in space and planets, and began to dream about his space tour which would one day become a reality.[5] After studying for one year at a vocational technical school in Lyubertsy, Gagarin was selected for further training at a technical high school in Saratov. While there, he joined the “AeroClub”, and learned to fly a light aircraft, a hobby that would take up an increasing portion of his time. In 1955, after completing his technical schooling, he entered military flight training at the Orenburg Pilot’s School. While there he met Valentina Goryacheva, whom he married in 1957, after gaining his pilot’s wings in a MiG-15. Post-graduation, he was assigned to Luostari airbase in Murmansk Oblast, close to the Norwegian border, where terrible weather made flying risky. He became a Lieutenant in the Soviet Air Force on 5 November 1957 and on 6 November 1959 he received the rank of Senior Lieutenant.[6]\n\nCareer in the Soviet space program\n\nSelection and training\n\nSee also: Vostok programme\n\nIn 1960, after the search and selection process, Yuri Gagarin was chosen with 19 other pilots for the Soviet space program. Gagarin was further selected for an elite training group known as the Sochi Six from which the first cosmonauts of the Vostok programme would be chosen. Gagarin and other prospective cosmonauts were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance; he also underwent training for the upcoming flight. Out of the twenty selected, the eventual choices for the first launch were Gagarin and Gherman Titov because of their performance in training, as well as their physical characteristics — space was at a premium in the small Vostok cockpit and both men were rather short. Gagarin was 1.57 metres (5 ft 2 in) tall, which was an advantage in the small Vostok cockpit.[3]\n\nIn August 1960, when Gagarin was one of 20 possible candidates, an Air Force doctor evaluated his personality as follows:\n\nModest; embarrasses when his humor gets a little too racy; high degree of intellectual development evident in Yuriy; fantastic memory; distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings; a well-developed imagination; quick reactions; persevering, prepares himself painstakingly for his activities and training exercises, handles celestial mechanics and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excels in higher mathematics; does not feel constrained when he has to defend his point of view if he considers himself right; appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends.\n\n—Soviet Air Force doctor, [7]\n\nGagarin was also a favoured candidate by his peers. When the 20 candidates were asked to anonymously vote for which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly, all but three chose Gagarin.[8] One of these candidates, Yevgeny Khrunov, believed that Gagarin was very focused, and was demanding of himself and others when necessary.[9]\n\nGagarin kept physically fit throughout his life, and was a keen sportsman. Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky wrote:\n\n“ Service in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know that Yuri Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper… I don’t think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.[10] ”\n\nIn addition to being a keen ice hockey player, Gagarin was also a basketball fan, and coached the Saratov Industrial Technical School team, as well as being an umpire/referee.[11]\n\nSpace flight\n\nMain article: Vostok 1\n\nVostok I capsule used by Yuri Gagarin, now on display at the RKK Energiya Museum outside of Moscow.\n\nOn 12 April 1961, Gagarin became the first man to travel into space, launching to orbit aboard the Vostok 3KA-3 (Vostok 1). His call sign was Siberian Pine Russian: Кедр).[12]\n\nIn his post-flight report, Gagarin recalled his experience of spaceflight, having been the first human in space:\n\nThe feeling of weightlessness was somewhat unfamiliar compared with Earth conditions. Here, you feel as if you were hanging in a horizontal position in straps. You feel as if you are suspended.[13]\n\nFollowing the flight, Gagarin told the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that during reentry he had whistled the tune “The Motherland Hears, The Motherland Knows” (Russian: “Родина слышит, Родина знает”).[14][15] The first two lines of the song are: “The Motherland hears, the Motherland knows/Where her son flies in the sky“.[16] This patriotic song was written by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1951 (opus 86), with words by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky.\n\nAfter the flight, some sources claimed that Gagarin, during his space flight, had made the comment, “I don’t see any God up here.” However, no such words appear in the verbatim record of Gagarin’s conversations with the Earth during the spaceflight.[17] In a 2006 interview a close friend of Gagarin, Colonel Valentin Petrov, stated that Gagarin never said such words, and that the phrase originated from Nikita Khrushchev‘s speech at the plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU, where the anti-religious propaganda was discussed. In a certain context Khrushchev said, “Gagarin flew into space, but didn’t see any god there”.[18] Colonel Petrov also said that Gagarin had been baptised into the Orthodox Church as a child.\n\nRise to fame\n\nA postcard with an image of Yuri Gagarin\n\nAfter the flight, Gagarin became a worldwide celebrity, touring widely abroad. He visited Italy, Germany, Canada, Japan, Finland to promote the Soviet coup of being the first country to put a human in space. He also visited the United Kingdom three months after the Vostok 1 success, during which he visited the cities of London and Manchester, the latter of which has been fondly remembered.[19][20]\n\nLife after Vostok 1\n\nIn 1962, he began serving as a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He later returned to Star City, the cosmonaut facility, where he spent seven years working on designs for a reusable spacecraft. He became Lieutenant Colonel (or Podpolkovnik) of the Soviet Air Force on 12 June 1962 and on 6 November 1963 he received the rank of Colonel (Polkovnik) of the Soviet Air Force.[6] Soviet officials tried to keep him away from any flights, being worried of losing their hero in an accident. Gagarin was backup pilot for Vladimir Komarov in the Soyuz 1 flight. As Komarov’s flight ended in a fatal crash, Gagarin was ultimately banned from training for and participating in further spaceflights.\n\nDeath\n\nMonument of Yuri Gagarin on Cosmonauts Alley in Moscow\n\nOn 27 March 1968, while on a routine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base, he and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died in a MiG-15UTI crash near the town of Kirzhach. The bodies of Gagarin and Seryogin were cremated and the ashes were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square.\n\nGagarin had become deputy training director of the Star City cosmonaut training base. At the same time, he began to re-qualify as a fighter pilot.\n\nCause of jet crash\n\nIt is not certain what caused the crash, but a 1986 inquest suggests that the turbulence from a Su-11 ‘Fishpot-C’ interceptor using its afterburners may have caused Gagarin’s plane to go out of control.[21]\n\nRussian documents declassified in March 2003 showed that the KGB had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government and two military investigations. The KGB’s report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions of air base personnel contributed to the crash. The report states that an air traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information, and that by the time of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin’s planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded that Gagarin’s aircraft entered a spin, either due to a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not properly react to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin.[22]\n\nIn his 2004 book Two Sides of the Moon, Alexey Leonov recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard “two loud booms in the distance.” Corroborating other theories, his conclusion is that a Sukhoi jet (which he identifies as a Su-15 ‘Flagon’) was flying below its minimum allowed altitude, and “without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin’s plane while breaking the sound barrier.” The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin. Leonov believes the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin’s plane crashing.[23]\n\nAnother theory, advanced by the original crash investigator in 2005, hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft.[24] A similar theory, published in Air & Space magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude. This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash.[25]\n\nOn 12 April 2007, the Kremlin vetoed a new investigation into the death of Gagarin. Some experts who had been involved in the original investigation had formulated a new theory, based on modern technology and investigative methods. Government officials said that they saw no reason to begin a new investigation.[26]\n\nLegacy and tributes\n\nRussian Rouble commemorating Gagarin in 2001\n\nThere were two commemorative coins issued in the Soviet Union to commemorate 20th and 30th anniversaries of his flight: 1 ruble coin (1981, copper-nickel) and 3 ruble coin (1991, silver). In 2001, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Gagarin’s flight, a series of four coins bearing his likeness was issued in Russia: 2 ruble coin (copper-nickel), 3 ruble coin (silver), 10 ruble coin (brass-copper, nickel), and 100 ruble coin (silver).[27]\n\nIn 2008, the Kontinental Hockey League named their championship trophy the Gagarin Cup.[28]\n\nIn a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Gagarin was ranked as the #6 most popular space hero, tied with Star Trek‘s fictional Capt. James T. Kirk.[29]\n\nIn January 2011, Armenian airline Armavia named their first Sukhoi Superjet 100 in Gagarin’s honour.[30]\n\nFrom 14 July 2010 to 14 July 2011, a copy of the statue of Gagarin from outside his former school in Lyubertsy has been installed at the Admiralty Arch end of The Mall in London, opposite the permanent sculpture of James Cook.[31]\n\nthe end @ copyrighr Dr Iwan suwandy 2011"
