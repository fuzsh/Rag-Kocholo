        "text": "Known as the Blood-Countess or The Vampire, she began killing young virgins after her husband, Count Ferencz Nasdasdy, had died, because she thought their blood would keep her young. She was member of one of the oldest and wealthiest families in Transylvania, who counted - a cardinal, princes, and a cousin who was Prime minister of Hungary. The most famous Bathory was King Stephan of Poland. 1575-86. Her husband spent a great deal of time away from home fighting, and while he was away, and she surrounded herself with people claimed to be witches, sorcerers, seers, wizards, alchemists, and others who practiced the most depraved deeds in league with the Devil. Her deeds were discovered and her castle was raided. Erzsébet was put under house arrest. A trial was held in 1611, but she refused to plead guilty or innocent and never appeared at the trial. A complete transcript of the trial was made at the time and it survives today in Hungary. Johannes Ujvary, major-domo, testified that about 37 unmarried girls has been killed and Erzsébet's old nurse testified that about 40 girls had been tortured and killed. Erzsébet was never convicted of any crime, but the windows and doors of the bedchamber were walled up with only a small hole through which food could be passed. King Mathias II demanded the death penalty for her but because of her cousin, the Prime minister, he agreed to an indefinitely delayed sentence, which really meant solitary confinement for life. She was mother of three daughters and a son, and lived (1560-1614).\n\nHer husband, Boris Godunov, had been the real power behind the throne since the succession of his brother-in-law, Fedor II, who was mentally deficient, and after his death in 1598 Boris was elected Tsar. It was a period with widespread famine 16-03, and during the ensuing discontent, a man emerged who claimed to be Dmitriy, Ivan IV's son who had died in 1591. This pretender to the throne, who came to be known as the first False Dmitriy, gained support in Poland and marched to Moscow, gathering followers among the boyars and other elements as he went. In 1605 Boris died and Maria became regent for her son, Tsar Fedor II, who was murdered and Dmitriy was crowned tsar Maria was also murdered. She lived (circa 1560-1605).\n\nHeiress to her uncle, Count Heinrich IV von Sayn, Lord zu Homburg, Montclair und Meinsberg (1539-1606), who was the last Count von Sayn-Sayn of the male line of Sayn-Sponheim. He inherited the county jointly with her father, Hermann after death of their uncle Sebastian II, and after her father's death in 1588, he reunited the County. Because of ilnes he transferred the government to her husband, who asumed the title of Count Wilhelm III von Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn in 1605, and had him make a guarantee that he would support the Lutheran confession, but he soon replaced the Lutheran priests with Reformed. After her death, the county was in dispute and some territories were occupied by foreign powers. Wilhelm was succeeded by their oldest son, Ernst, in 1626. She lived (1572-1608).\n\nIn spite of the fact that the island was Islamic, the rulers continued to use ancient Sanskrit titles alongside their Islamic styles until the middle of the twentieth century. The sultanate was attacked by the Portuguese in the fifteenth century but regained its independence in 1573. They also fell prey to the marauding raids of the Ali Rajas of Cannanore, who frequently kidnapped princes and influential nobles and carried them off to the Laccadives. Although close trading relations were established with the Dutch in Sri Lanka, the Maldives remained aloof from the Western powers for another two centuries. She was never secure as ruler due to a long civil war. She died at sea or on Mahibadu Island, Ari Atol, while on pilgrimage to give alms.\n\nSucceeded father, Henri de Joyeuse, comte du Bouchage, and first married to Henri de Bourbon, Duc de Montpensier de Châtellerault de Saint-Fargeau and Prince souverain des Dombes etc. (d. 1608) who was succeeded by their only daughter, Marie de Bourbon (1605-27). 1611 she married Charles de Lorraine, duc de Guise (1591-1640). Her husband went in exile to Firenze after his intrigues agaisnt the Cardinal Richelieu in 1636 and remained there until his death 4 years later. She lead a pious life and was devoted to charity. Their daughter, Marie de Lorraine (1615-88), inherited a grand-nephew as Duchess de Guise and Princesse de Joinville in 1675. The other children either died young or became clerics- including Françoise (1627-82), who was Abbesse de Saint-Pierre de Reims and Françoise Renée, (1621-82, Montmartre), Abbesse de Montmartre. She lived (1585-1656).\n\nThe chapter became an immediate realm in 833 and the abbess held the rank of a Princess of the Holy Roman Realm and reigned over the canonesses in the chapter and the subjects in the territories belonging to the chapter, which held a seat and vote in the Diet of the Realm and on the Bavarian Landtag. In ecclesiastical affairs she was subject to the Prince Bishop of Regensburg and in secular affairs she was obliged to consult the canonesses, so she was not a absolute ruler.\n\nAlso known as Duchess Anna von Preussen und Jülich-Kleve-Berg, she was daughter of Marie Eleonore von Jülich-Kleve-Berg, the heiress of the three duchies and some counties, and Albrecht II Friedrich von Preussen. 1594 she married her distant relative, Elector Johann Sigismund zu Hohenzollern of Brandenburg (1572-1619), and was the dominant force during his reign. He was regent for her father from 1609, and in 1611 he was given Prussia as a personal fief. After the death of her uncle, Johann Wilhelm zu Jülich in 1609, a succession-dispute followed with the Pfalz-Newburg's until a division was agreed upon in 1614, and the counties of Kleve, Mark, Ravensberg and Ravenstein went to Brandenburg, though she primarily considered it as her personal possessions. After her father's death in 1618 she and her son, the kurprinz Georg-Wilhelm, took over the government, since her husband had been hit by a stroke two years earlier, and she remained in charge until her death. She lived (1575-1625).\n\nAfter the assassination of her husband, King Henri IV, she became regent for her son Louis XIII. She reversed the policies set by her husband. Having remained in power for three years beyond the king's majority, Marie was forced into exile after the murder of Concini in 1617. In 1619 her partisans rose in revolt, but she was reconciled to her son in 1622. After the rise to power of her former favourite, Cardinal Richelieu, she attempted to regain influence by urging the king to dismiss his minister of state; instead Louis forced his mother into a new exile at Compiègne, whence she fled to the Netherlands in 1631, never to return to France. One of her children was the politically influential Henrietta Maria, Queen of Charles I of England. She was daughter of Francesco de' Medici, Grand Duke of Toscana and lived (1573-1642).\n\nIn dispute with the bishop on Konstanz and the College of Counts, defending her own position and travelled to Vienna to discuss her affairs with the emperor, and during the Thirty Years War, she was able to keep the territory out of trouble - not the least because of the connections with her brother, Dominikus Virgil, who was Colonel in the Army of the League and Erbschenk and Governor of Tirol. Her sister, Maria Clara, was Princess-Abbess of Essen (1614-44) and another sister, Anna Genvra, was Abbess of Sonnenberg (1622-52). Katharina was daughter of Leo Freiherr von Spaur, Pfaum und Valier and Juliane Barbara, Countess Federici, and lived (1580-1650).\n\nAlso known as Katharina-Belgica, she took over the reins of government after the death of her husband, Philipp Ludwig II, for their son, Philipp Moritz. In 1619 when the Emperor Ferdinand II was on his way to Frankfurt for his coronation, he wanted to pass through with 1.500 soldiers but Catharina Belgica refused him entry into the city of Hanau. In 1621 Spanish and Imperial armies ravaged her territories but her complaints to Spanish and Imperial officials were of no avail. In 1626 her son took over the rule from her; however, in 1634 the family had to flee to Holland and was able to return only in 1637. Her sisters were regents in Sedan and The Rhine. She lived (1578-1648).\n\nAs the Earls of Derby were the hereditary heads of state of the Isle of Man, and her husband, William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, , took up the title of Lord of Mann in 1609 (following an Act of Parliament), she, in lieu of her husband, began taking over many administrative duties appertaining to the Isle's political affairs. In 1612 she was appointed the first female Lord of Mann, a title she held until her death in 1627. She was succeeded by her eldest son, James. She was daughter of the Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, mother of five children and lived (1575-1626).\n\nShe was also known as Anna van Croÿ or Anne-Isabelle de Croÿ. It was stipulated in the marriage contract of her parents, that in the event of failure of male heirs, women could inherit the titles and possession of the family, so when her brother, Charles de Croy, Duke of Aarschot and Croy, died in 1612 she inherited the Duchy, even though she had to go to court because he had stipulated in his will that most of his patrimony should go to his uncle, the Marquis of Croy-Havré. He had also favoured his nephew, Annes third son Alexander (15901629). But the court confirmed in her rights in 1614. But already from around 1600 she had legally and fully acted as supreme administrator of the House of Arenberg as her husband, Karl van Arenberg (d. 1615) combined several political functions as well as military commands in the Netherlands and the Empire. She undertook all actions, legal or political, that she deemed necessary in safeguarding the Arenberg interests. Her contemporaries, both men and women, generally accepted her authority. Conflicts and gendered debates that did arise, mostly came from Annes sons, who wanted her to relinguish her powers in their favour, but she continued in the position until her death. Her own domains she administered completely independently and without any necessary intervention or approval from her husband. And even though her oldest son became titular Duke of Aarschot, she remained in control until her death. She lived (1568-1635)\n\nDaughter of Catherine, and married in 1605 to François de Bourbon, prince de Conti, first cousin of Henri IV of France (d. 1614 without issue). In 1629, she ceded Château-Regnault to the king of France in exchange for Pont-sur-Seine, and 3 years later she secretly married François de Bassompierre. The sovereignty of Château-Regnault included Linchamp, la Tour-à-Glaire, Macaucourt, Mohon, Montcy-Notre-Dame. In practice, since Château-Regnault is so small (it had 1.200 inhabitants in the mid-19th c.), the substantial prerogative was the right to mint coins and excelled in copying coins from the neighbouring countries, and she minted coins with the titulature: \"Louise-Marguerite de Lorraine par la grâce de Dieu princesse souveraine de Château-Regnault\". She lived (1574-1631).\n\nThe death of her brother Johann Wilhelm in 1609 led to the Jülich-Kleve Succession War where the families of her own and her 3 sisters fought over the inheritance. She transferred the rights of inheritance to the areas of the Low Rhine (niederrheinischen) she possessed as the oldest surviving daughter to her oldest son Wolfgang Wilhelm. She was chocked and kept her own Evangelical faith when he converted to the Catholic Faith in order to marry the daughter of Maximilian I of Bavaria to gain the support of the Catholic League in 1613, but in the end it helped him secure his mother's inheritance as Duke of Jülich and Berg in 1614. Her husband, Count Palatine Philipp Ludwig, died the same year, and she moved to her dowry the following year, she moved to her dowry. She was daughter of Duke Wilhelm IV. of Jülich, Kleve und Berg and Maria von Österreich, mother of 4 sons and 4 daughters, and lived (1552-1632).\n\nSucceeded her sister, Ratu Hijau; 'The Green Queen' and became known as Ratu Biru; 'The Blue Queen'. Her rise to the throne, does suggest that the orangkaya class of merchant aristocrats, in the words of the seventeenth-century French visitor to Siam Nicholas Gervaise, 'were weary of obeying kings who maltreated them, and shook off their yoke' in favour of queens. It became a political preference, and increasingly a recognised system. When she in turn died in 1624, a third sister, who would have had to be nearly sixty, came to the throne as Raja Ungu, 'the purple queen'.\n\nJust after her birth, Mette Hardenberg, was brought to her aunt, Birgitte Rønnow, and it was not until after 6 years that she returned to her parents at Hagenskov. At the age of 19 she married the 20 year older Preben Gyldenstierne, County Sheriff (Lensmand) of Åstrup by Hjørring. Her mother and sisters were marked by depressions and mental ilnesses and at one time she was \"possessed\" by an evil spirit for some weeks until she was \"saved\". She published a prayer's book by her own hand. Her mother, Anne Rønnow til Skousborg, was Acting County Sheriff of Skousborg, Hagenskov, Eskebjerg and Strynø after the death of her father, Erik Hardenberg in 1604. Mette was mother of 5 children, and lived (1569-1629).\n\nAfter the death of her husband, Sultan Ahmed Khan I (1603-17), she ruled in the name of her mentally unstable son, Mustapha Khan I (1717-23). When he was deposed she was sent off to the Old Saray, where her predecessor Safiye was already living. She was probably sent back again in 1623 but her fate is not known after her son was deposed for the second time and killed. She escaped punishment because of her privileged status as the mother of Mustafa, whose madness led the populace to consider him a saint. Her name is not known, but she was probably born in Europe (b. 1576-?).\n\nAfter the death of her husband, Count Konrad Gumprecht, her mother-in-law, Magalena von Neuenahr-Alpen (see 1602) installed her as regent for her son, Wilhelm, and after his death in 1626 for her second son, Friederich Ludolf who already died in 1639. She then became regent for his successor - a nephew - Count Moritz von Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda and in 1638 they made a treaty that secured her the regency of the County for life. She was in charge of in Limburg and Burg during the Thirty Years War, which left the county devastated. In 1633 she had to flee to her sister's residence in Fürstenau, and the same year the county was hit by plague. She returned in 1637 and managed to keep the county within the Bentheim family. She lived (1592-1654).\n\nAlready as a child she was involved in intrigue as part of the intent of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was to put her onto the throne of England and Scotland as a Catholic monarch, after assassinating her father and the Protestant English aristocracy. In 1613 she married Elector Palatine Friedrich V. (1596-1632) and soon became a dominating force at his court because of her energy and strong personality. In 1618 he came to the assistance of the Bohemians who had deposed their king, Ferdinand von Habsburg (future Emperor) and won the battle at Pilsen. He had appointed a relative as administrator and it seems that she was given a joint role in the government during his absence. The following year the Bohemians offered the crown to him as an influential member of the Evangelical Union, but his allies in the abandoned him, and his brief reign ended with his defeat only two months after their coronation (thus 'the Winter King'). Imperial forces invaded the Palatinate lands and they had flee to the Netherlands in 1622. He lived the rest of his life in exile with his wife and family at the Hague, where she remained for another 28 years until the Restoration of the British monarchy, when she travelled to London to visit her nephew, King Charles II, and died while there. She had been Heiress Presumptive 1625-30 until his birth. Among their 13 children were Karl Ludwig (1617-1680), who regained the Palatinate at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, Elizabeth, Princess-Abbess of Herford (1618-1680) and the later Electress Sophie of Hannover and Heir to the English throne (1630-1714). She was the eldest daughter of James of Scotland and Great Britain and Anne of Denmark, and lived (1596-1662).\n\nMarried to Filips Willem, Prince d'Orange in 1606, and followed him on his frequent travels between Brussels and Orange. He had grown up under the protection from the Duke of Alba, Governor of the Netherlands, during his studies in Leuven, until he was taken out of university at the age of 14 and brought to Spain while his family fled to Germany. As a captive by the king Philip II, he guaranteed the attitude of the princes d' Orange towards Spain. His father was assassinated in 1584, but he was not freed until 11 years later, and marched to his northern possessions. His brother, Mauritz, was now head of the family and his sister, Maria, looked after his domains during his absence. 1598 the Principality is returned to him, and competes with his brother for many years. After his death she fought with her in-laws over the inheritance of Oranje until her own death. She lived (1587-1619).\n\nChristine was widow of Ferdinando I de' Medici (1549-87-1609) and acted as co-regent for grandson Ferdinando II (1610-21-70) after the death of her son, Cosimo II. She was well disposed to the scientist Galileo and as a favour in return for some services rendered by him when he was still in Padua found a position for his brother in law Benedetto Landucci. It was to Christina that Galileo later wrote his letter on science and scripture, \"Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of Lorraine.\" She was the daughter of Charles II and Claude de France and lived (1565-1637).\n\nHer husband, Rudolf (1576-1603-21), died shortly after the birth of her son, Johan, and her brother-in-law, August von Anhalt-Köthen-Plötzkau (1575-1653), was named regent. Because of the upheavals during the Thirty Years War she had to leave Zerbst and seek refuge with her children in Wittenberg until she moved to Oldenburg with her children in 1633 and lived by her brother, Anton Günther, and they did not move back until Zerbst until 1642. In 1646 she and her son were named heirs of the Lordships Jever and Knyphausen after her childless brother, and her son inherited the territories in 1667. The mother of 2 daughters and a son, she was daughter of Graf Johann XVI. von Oldenburg (1540-1603) and Elisabeth von Schwarzburg (1541-1612), and lived (1585-1657).\n\nNiece of Pope Clemente VIII (Ippolito Aldobrandini) (1536-92-1605) and universal heir of her brother, Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini (d. 1621). She administered her places, cities and feudal fiefs in Calabria, Romagna, Lazio with great competence and laid the foundations for the future Duchies of Carpineto, Maenza, Gavignano, Montelanico and Gorga, and transformed the feudal territory into a dukedom also including several surrounding villages. In 1629, she ordered the building of St. Peter's Church, which she provided with gorgeous reliquaries and frescoes, the best known being a fresco attributed to the famous painter Caravaggio. She was married to Gianfrancesco Aldobrandini and mother 2 daughters and 1 son, who also died in 1637 and the family inheritance was therefore taken over by her granddaughter, Olimpia Junior. She lived (1567-1637).\n\nHer husband Philipp had taken over the Evangelical Bishopcy of Cammin, when his brother, Franz succeeded their older brother as Duke of Pommern-Stettin. He later received the Offices of Neustettin and Rügenwalde until he succeeded his brother as duke but died after only two years, and she took over Neustettin as her dowry. In 1640 she founded a Gymnasium (High School) in the Town of Neustettin. Like the marriages of all the last Dukes of Pommern, theirs was also childless. She was daughter of Duke Heinrich Julius von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel and Elisabeth af Danmark, and lived (1595-1650).\n\nAlso Known as Pande Doña Ana I Souza or Jinga, she assigned women important government offices. Constantly driven east by the Portuguese, Nzinga organized a powerful guerrilla army, conquered the Matamba, and developed alliances to control the slave routes. She even allied with the Dutch, who helped her stop the Portuguese advancement. After a series of decisive setbacks, Nzinga negotiated a peace treaty with the Portuguese, but still refused to pay tribute to the Portuguese king. Two of her war leaders were reputedly her sisters, her council of advisors contained many women, among others her sisters, Princess Grace Kifunji and Mukumbu, the later Queen Barbara, and women were called to serve in her army. She was daughter of N'Gola Kiluanzi Kia Samba and succeeded her brother. Lived (1581-1663).\n\nIn 1623 Sultan Mustafa was deposed for the second time and replaced by her son 14-year-old son, Murat IV, and she acted as his regent for some years a corresponded frequently with the various Grand Viziers about the state of the empire. When Murat died as result of alcoholism in 1640, she had to have Murat's corpse brought before the door of the Cage, where her younger son, Ibrahim, had spend most of his life, like all princes in the Ottoman house, because he was too scared of being killed by his older brother to come out. He was mentally ill and power again fell to her together with the Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha, but they were often at odds, trying to overthrow each other. 1648 Ibrahim was deposed and killed. Her grandson Mehmed IV was only six, and Kösem again became regent with the title of Great Mother Sultan because Mehmed's mother Hadice Tarhan was only 23 and considered too young to rule. The period was the period of corruption, bribery and anarchy, and a fierce rivalry grew between Kösem Sultan and Turhan Hatice Sultan. Kösem tried to save herself and her followers by plotting to poison the young sultan - and to replace him with his mad cousin Süleymen. But Turhan Hatice Sultan learned of the plot and thwarted it with the help of the palace black eunuchs and the sultan's personal guard, and Kösem was strangled to death after a fight, where it took four men to subdue her. Other versions of her name were Kiusem, Koisem, or Kieuzel Sultan, and she was probably born as Anastasya, the daughter of a Bosnian priest, and lived (circa 1589-1651).\n\nHer husband, Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duc de Bouillon, tried to keep his small but independent state of Sedan independent from France, but as more and more Huguenots came for refuge, it became a Protestant centre within an increasingly hostile Catholic country. She acted as regent during his absence from the state and after his death; she reigned in the name of her son, Frédéric-Maurice (1605-52) and continued to act as temporary regent for him after he came of age. Two of her sisters were regents in Hanau and The Rhine. She lived (1577-1642).\n\nThe last of three sisters to rule the kingdom since 1585 and must have been well into her 60ies. She became known as 'The Purple Queen\". During the reign of the three sisters the Malayan Kingdom-Sultanate was expanded its borders to include Kelantan and Trengganu and became the most powerful Malay state after Johor. It was during this time that Patani became renowned for manufacturing cannon, producing three of the largest bombards ever cast in the region - 'Mahalela', 'Seri Negara' and 'Seri Petani'. With each measuring over six metres in length. She had previously married the neighbouring Sultan Abdul-Ghafur Mohaidin Syah of Pahang, which caused some tension until it was established that each would continue to live in their own state. She had had a daughter by him, who became Raja Kuning, 'the yellow queen' in 1636.\n\nAlso known as Nikolaea, Nicoläa or Nicola von Lothringen, she was daughter of Heinrich II der Gute von Lothringen, who named her as his heir, but in the testament of René II it was stipulated that the Duchy could only be inherited in the male line, and therefore her cousin, Charles de Vaudémont claimed the territory. They got married, and the Estates General decided that the throne belonged to her uncle and father-in-law, Franz, who then abdicated in favour of her husband after a few days. In 1634 Charles was deposed, the following year divorced her, and in spite of the fact that the Pope refused to annul the marriage, he remarried twice. His brother Nicolas, was Duke for one year, France occupied the territory until 1670 when her ex-husband took over the throne again for the last five years of his life and was succeeded by a nephew. She did not have any children, and lived (1608-57).\n\nHad been very influential during the reign of her husband, Joachim Ernst, since their marriage in 1612. After his death, she became joint regent for their son Friederich, who died in battle just after reaching the age of majority in 1634 and then for the second son, Albrecht V, whom she send off to security in France. She was overpowered by the ordeals of the 30th year war, its devastation, famine and other problems and at one occasions she had to flee from the Swedish, Imperial and other troops, and the occupation continued even after she joined the so-called Peace of Prague in 1635. She lived (1594-1651).\n\nVery influential during the reign of her husband, Charles I (1625-49). She married him in 1625 and although she was devoted and loyal to her husband, her Roman Catholic faith made her suspect in England. By her negotiations with the pope, with foreign powers, and with English army officers, she added to the suspicions against Charles that helped to precipitate the English civil war in 1642. After 1644 she lived in France, making continual efforts to secure foreign aid for her husband until his execution in 1649. She remained very active in the fight for her son's restoration, and returned to England in 1660, but resumed living in France five years later. Her influence may have affected the religious beliefs of her sons Charles II and James II, although she herself was unsuccessful in her attempts to convert them to Catholicism. She was daughter of Henri IV of France, mother of seven children of whom only three survived into adulthood, and lived (  ).\n\nHer father, Charles Alexandre Havré, Prince and Duc of Croÿ, was murdered in 1624 and her cousin, Ernst Bogislaw von Croÿ (1620-1684), inherited both princely and ducal titles of Croÿ, but lived with his mother in Pomerania. Marie Claire first married a relative Charles Philippe de Croy, Marquis de Renty (d. 1640) and then his brother, Philippe Francois de Croy, Count of Solre (d. 1650) and in 1627 King Felipe III of Spain raised her Marquesate to a Duchy with her as the first Duchess. Her son, Phillippe Eugene, was Marquis de Renty and Bishop of Valencia until his death in 1665. Then her daughter, Marie Ferdinande (d. 1683) succeeded to the title. She was married to Count Louis van Egmond, Prince de Gavre (d. 1682). Her only son by the second marriage, Ferdinand Francois Joseph de Croÿ-Solre, succeeded to the ducal title. She lived (1605-64).\n\nBecame ruler after the death of her husband, Bethlen Gábor (or Gabriel), who was elected prince af the assassination of Báthori Gábor in 1613. A Protestant, though tolerant toward all religions, he had allied himself with the Protestant Frederick, the Winter King of Bohemia and overran Hungary in 1619 and was elected its king the following year. After Frederick's defeat at the White Mountain, Gábor signed with Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II the Treaty of Nikolsburg, by which he renounced the royal title but retained control of seven Hungarian counties and received the rank of prince of the empire. He continued his relations with the Protestant powers opposing the emperor in the Thirty Years War, but kept the interests of Transylvania paramount. He was a wise administrator and encouraged the development of law and learning. Katharina was succeeded by brother-in-law Istvan Bethlen, who died 1630. In Transylvania she was known as Brandenburgi Katalin, and lived (1602-44).\n\nEldest daughter of Emperor Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahall and is an example of a tradition of unmarried Princesses in the Mughal Dynasty. When her mother Mumtaz Mahall (Taj Mahall) died in 1631 giving birth to her 14th child, Jahanara, became the uncrowned woman figure head, and her father's fondness for her was reflected in the multiple titles he bestowed upon her, which include Sahibat al-Zamani, Mistress of the Age, and Padshah Begum, or Lady Emperor. Jahanara played an important role in the politics of the imperial family. This is seen through the instrumental position she held in the marriage arrangements of her three brothers. In addition she was politically active during the War of Succession that took place at the end Shahjahan's reign as emperor in 1658 when Azrangzib, Jahanaras brother, challenged and eventually took power from Shahjahan. During the conflict Jahanara supported her fathers claim to the throne and cared for him during his forced imprisonment, which lasted until his death in 1666. Upon her fathers death, Jahanara emerged from fort Agra and was given a sizable monetary gift by Azrangzib. The title of Padishah Begum she was permitted to disobey Aurangzeb's laws and criticize him. Jahanara composed many poems, painted, and honoured her father and mothers' love of the arts, and lived (1614-81).\n\nFollowing the death of her husband, Ernst Kasimir, Count of Nassau, Katzenelnbogen, Vianden and Diez, Baron of Dillenburg, Governor of Rhineberk, Lieutenant-governor of Gelderland and of Utrecht, Stadtholder of Friesland 1620 and of Groningen and Drenthe in 1625, she took over the regency of Dietz and in 1633 she moved to the old middle-age borough, with little furniture and without any kind of luxury. She was in the middle of the 30-year war, with continuing warfare, troops moving through the country and lootings with damaged the county seriously. On top of it all came failed harvests, epidemics and famine. She developed into a forceful and brave ruler and she was able to hand over the power to her son, Hendrik Casimir, after he came of age in 1634, but he was in Friesland as Stadtholder. After his death in 1640, her second son, Willem Frederik, became Stadtholder of Friesland, and she again takes over the reigns in Dietz. She was very fat and of ill health. Only two of her nine children survived into adulthood, and she lived (1592-1642)\n\nOnly 15 when she was elected to the post of sovereign of the Eccleastical territory after the death of her aunt, Anna von der Marck, in March. She had a secret relationship to Count Herman Frederik van den Bergh and in December she married him secretly and returned to Thorn. When her father, father, Johann Dietrich, Count von Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rochefort, heard about the wedding in 1632, he put her in the very strict Chapter of Rochefort, but after four years she escaped and was reunited with her husband. Her mother was Josina von der Marck, Countess of Rochefort from about 1613. They did not have any children. She lived (1615-83).\n\nWhen she succeeded her father Gustav II Adolf at the age of six, a regency under Axel Oxenstierna reigned until she assumed full royal power in 1644. Throughout her reign, she attempted to increase the authority of the Crown, and in this she was supported by the lower estates against the nobility and the Council of the Realm. The Thirty Years' War, however, had led Sweden into an economic crisis that Christina was unable to resolve. Highly intelligent, she was interested in intellectual pursuits and was influenced by the French philosopher René Descartes, who lived in Stockholm in 1649-50. Christina never married, and in 1654 she abdicated in favour of her cousin Karl of the Pfalz and received a number of tenantcies, conties and estates for life. She moved to Rome and later announced that she had converted to Roman Catholicism and only visited Sweden 2 times. She lived (1626-89).\n\nEngaged in disputes with the Regency-council for her daughter, Queen Kristina. 1636 her parental right to Kristina was taken away from here and she was taken to Gripsholms castle. 1640 she fled to Gotland where she got on board a Danish warship that took her to Denmark. In Denmark she became the guest of Christian 4 at Nykøbing Castle. Her intentions where to go to Germany, but as her brother refused to accept her she didn't reach Brandenburg until her nephew Fredrik Wilhelm, which succeeded his father in 1640, gave his permission in 1644. But soon she started to long for Sweden again and after the Westphalian Peace she returned. Before she died in 1655 she had endured one last sorrow, her daughters' abdication from the Swedish Throne. She lived (1599-1655).\n\nHer husband had been Governor of Tirol, but later became Prince of the Territory. After his death she reigned together with 5-person Council of Advisors for her minor son Archduke Ferdinand Karl von Habsburg of Austria (1628-32-62). She was in charge of the government during the 30-year war, the Swedes threatened Tyrol and she had a defence-line built at the northern boarder, and she reorganised the army. She also promoted trade, cut spending, limited the state-depths, reintroduced law and order, tried to limit the persecution of witches. But she did not allow Protestants or other non-Catholics in the County; she wanted it to be a \"holy land. She lived (1604-48).\n\nFrom 1578 to 1682 the principality consisted solely of the two jurisdictions of Bardi and Compiano, the only example of an institutional territorial state in Italy, the life of which, however, is crystallized on foundations antiquated by the imperial protection. All powers were in the hands of the lord, the Most Excellent Prince. 1627 her father Federico I Landi obtained imperial permission to let her succeed all the fiefs of the Consanguin House of Svevi and Genoese Princely family. 1630 was the year of the Manzonian plague and the golden era of the State of Bardi and Compiano was about to end. She was married to Pagano Giovanni Andrea II Doria, Principe di Melfi, Marchese di Torriglia, Santo Stefano dAveto, Ottone, Carrega, Garbagna, Cabella e Fontanarossa, Conte di Loano, etc., Viceroy of Sardinia (1607-40). 3 years after her death, the principality was incorporated into Parma. She lived (1608-1679).\n\nKnown as 'The Yellow Queen', she succeeded her mother Queen Raja Ungu as the last of four successive Queens. She was the last Queen that the Patani chronicles acknowledge as legitimate. European traders found Patani less attractive than some of its neighbours in the second half of the century, and consequently sources are scarce. From the reports deposed in Nagasaki by Chinese junk captains, however, we know that the system of queens continued at least into the 1690s, through two debilitating invasions by Siam in 1674 and 1688. The four queens were able rulers and they all survived several coup attempts amid a fluctuating political situation in the region. All the men who challenged their power were \"dealt with\" in different ways. Nobody knows what actually happened to them, but they were never seen again.\n\nAfter the death of her husband, Simon Ludwig, she claimed the regency for her Simon Philipp (1632-36-50), but since she was only 24 and therefore not fully of age (25 years). She aspired to have her father, Christian von Waldeck named Co-Guardian or Contutor - he had already been regent for her husband. Her claims were supported by the courts and Imperial decrees, but her brothers-in-law ignored her rights and were de-facto in charge of the regency. As she feared that her sons were in danger of being taken away from her, she made contact with some troops from Hessen-Darmstadt, who secured the children and placed them under the protection of Landgrave Georg II. von Hessen-Darmstadt. Her brother-in-law Johann Bernhard made plans to divide the county between him and another brother, but this alienated the Land-states who were now on Katharina's side. In 1640 Imperial troops attacked the Castle of Detmold, and disarmed her brothers-in-law, and took up negotiations with her. 10 years later her son died without heirs, and her brother-in-law finally inherited the county two years before his death. His brother Hermann Adolf succeeded him. Katharina lived (1612-49).\n\nThird wife of Johann Albrecht II and gave birth to his first surviving son, Gustav Adolf, in 1633. He named her, as regent and guardian in his will, jointly with the reformed Elector Kurfürst Georg Wilhelm von Brandenburg. Johann Albrecht wanted his son to be raised in the Calvinist faith, but the Lutheran duke Adolf Friedrich von Mecklenburg-Schwerin protested. He demanded that she withdrew to her dowry in Strelitz and left the child with him. At the funeral the present princes tried to mediate but failed, she refused to close her Calvinist chapel. Her opponents tried to oust her from the castle with all means. Adolf Friedrich kidnapped his nephew from the Castle of Güstrow and raised him with his own children in the Lutheran faith in Bützow, and he also took over the guardianship of Güstrow. She appealed at the Emperor tried to find support in Sweden. Even though Adolf Friedrich harassed her, she did not move to her dowry until 1644, and from then on her 11-year-old son lived at Güstrow Castle. At the same time the Swedish, Imperial and Prussian troops crossed through Mecklenburg several times, causing much looting and hardship. Also mother of three daughters, she lived (1600-57).\n\nEven though she was with her husband Wilhelm V in Ostfriesland when he died, she was immediately named regent for their son Wilhelm VI and was in control in spite of the fact that she did not return to the Landgravate until 1640 because of the upheavals during the Thirty Years War. She was an able ruler and managed add new territory to the state. She made a truce with the emperor but formed an alliance with France and became a leading force in the Protestant Group during the warfare. As regent she chaired the Councils of Regency almost daily, she chaired various Local Diets (Landtags), which she called when she felt the need for it. She was daughter of Count Philipp Ludwig II von HanauMünzenberg, and after the death of the last of Münzenberg line she claimed her rights on the basis of a inheritance-treaty from 1643, and received the Office of Schwarzenfels as security and handed over the territory as her own property. She was mother of several children and lived (1602-51).\n\nAt the day of her marriage to Bogislaw XIV, who was the last Duke of Pommern-Stettin (1620-25) and Duke of Pommern (1625-37) and Evangelican Bishop of Cammin (1623-37) he transferred the Schloss and Amt (or Bezierk) von Rügenwalde to her for life. Her husband was a weak ruler, entangled in the chaos of the Thirty Years War. As his brothers and cousins died, he inherited all of Pommern but the united duchies did not have an united administration. In 1633 he suffered a stroke and until his death 4 years later, the Duchy was conducted by a Council of Regency. Her sister, Anna, was the second wife of Bogislaw's father and her sister, Sophia was the wife of her brother-in-law, Philipp II, and as her sisters, and she did not have any children. Elisabeth lived (1580-1653).\n\nAlready by the time of her marriage to Archduke Ferdinand, she became very influential at court. In 1637 he succeeded his father as Emperor Ferdinand III, and she became involved in politics and was his closest aide. During the Thirty Years War, the imperial family moved to Linz, and here she died of poisoning during her last pregnancy, her daughter was still alive, and was born by a caesarean, but died soon after. Maria Anne was daughter of Felip III of Spain and Archduchess Margarete of Austria, and lived (1606-46).\n\nAt the age of 10 she entered the Abbey of Chelles and Louise de Bourbon-Lavedan appointed her as coadjutrice at the age of 16, but she did not take over the position until she was 25. She reigned with absolute \"souverainty\" and her direct dependence on the Pope in Rome allowed her to act autonomously from the church in France. In 1641 she obtained royal letters confirming the reform and finally quashing the claims of the monks, who sought to organize themselves independently of the authority of the abbess. The following year the Rule approved by Sixtus IV was printed at Paris, but in 1658, the Sacred Congregation of Rites categorically condemned that she of her own authority, obliged the monks and nuns of her obedience to recite offices, say Masses, and observe rites and ceremonies which had never been sanctioned or approved of by Rome. She was the legitimized daughter of king Henri IV and Charlotte des Essarts, and her full sister; Marie Henriette de Bourbon (1609-29) was Abbess of Chelles. She lived (1608-70).\n\nGiven the Marchionate as a fief from in 1635, three years after her aunt, Maria Elisabeth I, died, but she was not able to take the fief into possession until after the Peace of Munster in 1648. Her aunt's widower, Albert, Count van den Bergh, had claimed the succession of his wife, and he was given the Marchionate as a fief by the king of Spain in 1641, and not until 1650 did he give up his claims, after she gave up her claims to the County of Bergh. Maria Elisabeth II ruled jointly with husband, Fürst Eitel Friedrich zu Hohenzollern-Hechingen until his death in 1661. She was succeeded by daughter, Franziska Henrica, and lived (1613-71)."
