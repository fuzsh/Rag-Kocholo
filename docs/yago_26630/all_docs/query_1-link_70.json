Ifc48137 Ebitor's ipreface 'T^HE Legitimist Kalendar for 1910 was already in print when an incomparable loss was sustained by the Legitimists of .^ Christendom in the death of His Majesty King Charles VIL of Spain and XL of France. Where possible, as in the account of the \" De Jure Sovereigns of Europe,\" I have altered the name to that of His present Majesty, King James HL and I. In other parts of the book, that were printed off, alterations were impossible. I must therefore beg the indulgence of our readers for seeming M inconsistency, offering them the best of all compensation in the \\ PoHtical Testament of the late King of France and Spain. To add words of mine to those of His Majesty would be presuming as well as superfluous, and it but remains for me to thank all those who have kindly helped me with the book. E. JOSEPHINE FOULDS. political tlestamcnt to tbe Carlists b^ tbc late Ikino Cbarlee tbe Vlh of Spain ant) JL of ifrance* IN full possession of my faculties, when my life, fuller in experience than in years, does not, according to human probabilities, seem near its end, I wish to leave my sentiments on record for you, my loyal and beloved Carlists, who are a part of my own self. From my abode in exile, thinking of death for myself, and of life for Spain, with my mind fixed on time and on eternity, I write these lines so that even from beyond the tomb they may carry my voice to your homes and recall the image of one whom you so loved, and who so loved you. \\Vhen they are published I shall have appeared before the Divine Presence of the Supreme Judge. He who searches the heart knows that they are not dictated merely by a sentiment of natural pride. They are inspired by that sense of duty and by that love of Spain, and of you, which have ever been the guidance of my life, which would seem to me incomplete if I did not leave you a political Testament epitomising the fruits of my experience, and showing you that even after my heart has ceased to beat, my soul will stay among you, anxious for your welfare, grateful for your love, careful for your well-being, the soul, in fact, of a most loving father, which is what I have always wished to be to you. Moreover, I pay a debt of gratitude. You are my family, the example and the consolation of all my life, as I have stated on solemn occasions. Your heroism, your constancy, your devo- tion, and your nobility of soul have given me immense encouragement in the days of strife and of prosperity, and the greatest support in sorrow, in suffering, and in that terrible inaction which is the heaviest of all crosses, the only one which has broken down my strength in the battle of life. I cannot better reciprocate all for which I am indebted to you, than by leaving to you in these lines the best of my mind. In my private last will I set down my fervent profession of the Catholic Faith. I wish to repeat and confirm it here in the face of the whole world. God alone knows what circumstances will surround my death. But whether it overtakes me on the throne of my ancestors, or on the field of battle, or in my banishment, a victim of the revolution to which I declared implacable war, I hope to draw my last breath kissing the Crucifix, and I vi political Testament to tbe Carltsts implore the Redeemer of the world to accept this life of mine, which I have consecrated to Spain, as an offering for the redemption of Spain. In truth I declare to you that during the whole of my existence, from when in my infancy there arose in me the first dawnings of reason, till now when I have reached the mature age of manhood, I have always done everything as I honestly understood it, and have never left anything undone, which I thought might be useful to our country, and to the great cause which I have so long had the honour of leading. \" I shall return,\" I told you at Valcarlos, on that bitter day, memorable among the most memorable of my life. And that promise, which sprang from my inmost being with faith, conviction, and unquenchable enthusiasm, I still firmly hope will be fulfilled. But if God in His inscrutable designs should have decided to the contrary, if my eyes are not to see again that sky which makes me think all others pale, if I am to die far away from that blest land for which my longing never leaves me, even so that cry of my heart will not have been in vain. If Spain is curable I shall come back to her even if I am dead. I shall come back with my principles, which alone can restore her greatness ; I shall come back with my flag, which I never surrendered, and which I have had the honour and happiness to keep for you without a single stain, refusing every sort of compromise, so that you may hold it high. A man's life is scarcely as one day in the life of nations. My personal endeavours would have been powerless had it not been for your concurrence, which helped me to create that vigorous, faithful, and patriotic band of youths, which I see already prepared to recover our inherit- ance, and to continue our mission. If during my career in the world I have succeeded in preserving for Spain this hope of glory, I die satisfied, and I can say with legitimate pride, that in exile, in misfortune, and in persecution, I have governed my country in reality more than those who one after the other have taken the reins of power. Government is not compromise, as was shamefully believed and practised by the political adversaries who have opposed me with all the material appear- ances of triumph. Government is resistance, just as the head resists the passions in a well-balanced man. Without my resistance and yours, what barrier could have been opposed to the revolutionary torrent by the sham rulers who in my time have succeeded one another in Spain? Whatever has been saved from the wreck, we, not tliey, have saved it, and we have saved it by our own energy. Go forward, then, my beloved Carlists ! Go forward for God and for Spain ! Let this be your watchword in the combat, as it was ever mine, and those of us who may have fallen in the fight will implore from God new strength for you so that you may not lose courage. Uphold your faith intact, the cult of our traditions, and the love of our flag. My son James, or whoever succeeds me in the right, knowing what the {political XTestament to tbe Carlists vii right means and requires, will continue my work. And even if the cup of bitterness were drained to the dregs, and the legitimate dynasty, which has been to you as a providential light, were to become extinct, your own dynasty, the dynasty of my admirable Carlists, the Spaniards par excellence, can never be extinguished. ^ You can save the country, as you saved it, with the King at your head, ^Kt^^jL from the hordes of the Mahometans, and as when bereaved of a sovereign you / ^^^^ saved it from the legions of Napoleon. Tho vicbu's of Navas and of Baiten , > were ' ffie \"aiicestors of the volunteers of Alpens and of Lacar. Both had the same faith in their souls, the same battle-cry upon their lips. My sacrifices and yours to form this great Spanish family, which is a guard of honour to the sanctuary where our venerable traditions are enshrined, are not, cannot be, fruitless. God Himself, the God of our fathers, has given us a pledge of His promise when He granted us superhuman strength to work out this real prodigy of modern times, to maintain inviolate amidst the unbridled attacks of victorious revolutionaries the living and fecund traditions of our race, as though the current of some crystal stream should flow through the ocean, without injury to the purity and sweetness of its waters. None have been more attacked, none more calumniated, none made the target of greater injustice than the Carlists and I. So that no adverse circum- stance should be wanting to us, we have frequently seen those turn against us whose best interest lay in helping us, but we have not been discouraged by ingratitude. Workers for the future, we laboured for history, and not for any personal benefit, the rebuffs of the passing hour mattered little to us if only the grain of sand which each one carried to the common work, could become one day the monolithic foundation for the greatness of our Fatherland. For that reason my death will be a family bereavement for all of you, but not a disaster. ' You have loved me much, as much as I loved you, and more were impossible. I know that you will mourn for me like affectionate sons, but I know the temper of your souls, and I know also that the grief of losing me will be an additional stimulus to honour my memory by serving our cause. Our Monarchy is above individuals. The King cannot die. Although you cease to see me at your head, you will continue to acclaim, as in my time, the lawful and traditional King of Spain, and to defend the fundamental principles of our programme. You have them set forth in all my manifestoes. They are the same which I have upheld, and proclaimed ever since the abdication of my most beloved father in 1868. These principles, if applied from the summit of power by a King in very / fl^ truth, having as fellow-workmen the soldiers of Spain, riiejfirsMn the world, ^ ^ and by that nation of giants, great as none other in their faith, their daring,^t-«r>»V^ ' viii ipolitical XTestament to tbe Carlists their contempt of death and of all material advantages, could in a very short time carry out my policy which aspired to revive the old Spain of the Catholic Kings and of Charles V, Gibraltar for Spain, union with Portugal, Morocco for Spain, federation with our former colonies, that is to say, integrity, honour, and greatness. There you have the legacy, which, by fair means, I aspired to leave to my Country- If I die without accomplishing it, do not forget that this is the goal, and that to reach it it is indispensable to cast out beyond our frontiers those institutions imported from other nations which do not feel, or reason, or love as we do, and to restore the traditional institutions of our history, without which the body of our nation is a body without a soul. With regard to proceedings and forms, and to all that is merely accidental and external, the circumstances and requirements of the time will show such alterations as may be necessary, but without touching the essential principles. Although Spain has been the worship of all my life, I could not forget that my birth imposed upon me duties towards France, the cradle of my family. For that reason I upheld intact the rights which belong to me as the first- born of my House. I charge my successors not to abandon them, as a protest for the right, and in the interests of that noble and misguided nation, as well as of the Latin idea, which I hope is destined to revive in future ages. I wish also to record here my gratitude to the small but select band of French legitimists who, since the death of Henry V., have gathered around my father and myself, faithful to their flag, and to the Salic Law. I also equally give thanks from the depths of my soul, to those many sons of chivalrous France, who, by their conduct towards me and mine, ever i protested against those injustices of which the descendant .of Henry IV, and -ik-y w<^Louis XIV. was a victim in their midst, it being well known to me that the , ^ ,^f*hostile acts of the French revolutionary government, frequently inspired by ^^^^^11 t ^^ greatest enemies of our race, did not represent the national sentiment of fU^J>» France. Let those, however, who come after me bear in mind that the head of our House belongs to Spain, which for his sake has lavished rivers of blood and treasures of love. My last salute on earth will be to that sacred yellow and red flag, and if God in His infinite mercy has pity, as I hope, upon my soul, He will allow me to see from heaven the ideals of my life triumphant under that glorious ensign. And to you who have with such energy defended them by my side, I offer my last farewell. / I shall remember you all, and I should like to mention you all individually , here, but how is it possible ? makin^as you do an innumerable people. My gratitude to all who live, and to aTl who have died for our cause, is immeasurable. To prove it, and to perpetuate their memory, I have instituted the national feast of our martyrs. Continue it as a part of your faith, you who may survive me. Meet together, for mutual stimulation and encouragement, A political Uestainent to tbe Carlists ix and in testimony of gratitude to those who have preceded you in the path of honour, on March loth of each year, the anniversary of the death of my most pious and exemplary grandfather, who with no less reason than the first- crowned leaders of the Keco7tquista^ should be included in the list of genuine Spanish Kings. But if I cannot name all one by one, I bear you all in my heart, and I choose among you to bless specially, as father and King, him who till now has been proud to bear the title of first of my subjects, my beloved son James. God, who has chosen him to succeed me, will give him the light and the power necessary to lead you. I need not remind him that while he will find a kind of moral aristocracy in you, who have ever been Carlists, all Spaniards, from the mere fact of their being Spaniards, have a right to his care and affection. I never could bring myself to consider any son of the Spanish soil as an enemy, but it is certain that many among them fought against me as adversaries. t^ ^ Let them know that I hated no one, and that they were to me nothing but 'T / _ sons, misled, some by errors of education, others by invincible ignorance, /^•Ji.*-'*^ jf most of them by the force of irresistible temptations, and the deleterious ^y^.' y ifiu/S ' influences of the atmosphere in which they were born. X / J'^j One of the faults which have found me most inflexible, is that com- \"'''^^ mitted by those who have put obstacles in the way of their admission to our party. I charge my son James to persevere in my policy of forgetfulness and pardon towards all men. Let him never fear to carry this too far, provided that he remains uncompromising as regards principles. I charge him also not to forget how he is bound by my solemn oaths to respect and defend the traditional privileges of our peoples.^ By my memor- able oaths of Guernica and Villafranca I intended to be bound in the presence of God, and before men, for myself and for all my family. I would have contracted the same sacred pledges to each of the regions of Spain, one and indivisible, as I offered to Catalonia, Aragon, and Valencia, if it had been materially possible for me to do so. Thus with the duties of loyal subjects and the dignity of free citizens mixed and identified in all Spaniards worthy of the name, and with the royal power and the high charge of prime guardian of the national liberties united in me, I have believed and can affirm in all truth that wherever I have been I have taken with me the Covadonga^ of modern Spain. And since, while, naming as first among you the Prince of the Asturias, I unite in the same feeling of heartfelt tenderness my family by blood, and my family according to my heart, I cannot take leave of you without recording here the names of the two good angels of my life, my most beloved mother, and my most beloved wife, Maria Bertha. IThe reconquest of Spain from the Moors. 2 Special privileges of certain provinces. 3 Covadonga is the site of the chief victory over the Moors. X ^ ipolitical XTestanient to tbe Carltsts I owe to the teachings of the one and to the consolations of the other, that which I can never repay. The first by inculcating into my mind from infancy, those solid Christian principles which she drew from the very depths of her soul, set the path of duty straight before me. The second sustaining me in my sorrows, gave me strength to tread it firmly, without stumbling over the difficulties encountered on my way. Engrave in your hearts, and teach to the lisping voices of your children, those two blessed names, Maria Beatrice and Maria Bertha. And when you, who have the happiness of living among the admirable women of Spain, feel yourselves comforted by a mother, or daughter, or sister, or wife, on looking into the mirror of their souls and seeing reflected there the virtues of Heaven, remember that these are also reflections from the souls of those two chosen ones who have lighted the desert of my life. I now leave you, sons of my choice, companions of my warfare, sharers of my joys and of my griefs. Do not weep for me, instead of tears give me prayers. Pray to God for my soul, and for Spain, and think that while you are praying for me, I shall, by the grace of the Saviour of the World be invoking the Virgin Mary, St. James our Patron, St. Louis and St. Ferdinand, my heavenly protectors, supplicating them with the faith of ancient Spain, which was strengthened in me in Jerusalem at the Sepulchre of Christ, that they will reward you on earth as what you are, crusaders and martyrs. Before closing this, my political testament, and desiring that the present original, entirely written by my own hand, shall remain first in the possession of my widow, and failing her in that of my legitimate successors, I take two copies, one literally in Spanish, and the other in French, to be communicated to the press of both Spain and France as soon as my eyes have been closed. Done at my residence the Loredan Palace, Campo San Vio, in Venice ; on the feast of the Epiphany in the year of Grace 1897. Sealed with my Royal Seal. It consists of six double sheets, forming twenty-four pages, numbered by myself. CARLOS. This is an exact copy of my political Testament, and consists of five pages. It is intended for the Spanish press. fIDanifesto of Iking James Ul, anb L of Spain ant) iFrancc FOR the first time in nearly a century, this day,^ the most auspicious of the whole year for the Carlist community, has become for it a day of mourning. There is hardly a church in Spain wherein numerous con- gregations have not assembled to pray for the soul of my father ; I give thanks for those prayers ; they prove that your affection is not confined to this life, it passes by means of prayer over the grave and reaches its fulness in heaven. On this day the hearts of all Spaniards worthy of the name are more fervently than ever united with mine in the Cathedral of Trieste, that Escurial of exile, watching the tomb containing the remains of him whom we all equally lament, because he was King and father to us all. I am unwilling that so memorable a date should pass without a word of encouragement to you from me, and I choose it specially to address you. I will say little, and need say little. If God has called to Himself the august sentinel who guarded the sacred deposit of our national traditions, the post which during forty years he filled i,] with so much honour is not vacant. I am come to relieve him. /V \"^ ' ' On succeeding with filial piety to a heritage not less onerous than _glorious, \\j '■\"•^■t I take on myself at once his rights, his duties, his ideas, his sentiments, and / his affections. I do not speak of his hatreds, for his heart, like mine, hac- boured none. ' ■ ', . ' • ty^ I might almost be excused if I abstained frcfei addressing you in a manifesto, seeing that I adopt and endorse as my own all those issued by my father, from the letter to^ my beloved uncle the Infant Don Alfonso, down to the religious and patriotic declarations of his political testament. Identified, however, though I be with the principles set forth in those immortal documents, I am conscious that it is incumbent on me to make my own comments thereupon, and to develop them to their final consequences. This I shall do, but not now when in spirit, like all of you, I am not only in Spain, but also on the other side of the Straits. Yonder floats that red and yellow flag which has been the idol of my whole life, which shaded my cabin while I was ploughing the most distant seas, and which, often saluted by the enemy's fire, floated over my campaigning tent in the vast solitudes of Asia. So long as a national war is being waged under this blest ensign, our hearts i 1 The feast of St. Charles Borromeo, name day of Don Carlos and his two predecessors. 2 This letter, dated June 1S69, contained Don Carlos' first public pronouncement. xn /[Manifesto of IRlng James ill. anb I. ^.-\"^ )L A*^^ 1 must beat for it alone ; and I am nothing, and wish to be nothing, but a Spaniard anxiously following it with eyes and heart, and deploring that I cannot serve it with my blood. Only when it shall wave victorious, washed of all the insults which have been put on it, I shall remember that I have other duties, placed on me by my birth, which I cannot evade. Whilst awaiting that day which, thanks to the heroism of our soldiers, I hope will soon dawn, I pray God to give me strength to accomplish the sacred task laid on me by my dear father's death. Hard as I know it to be, I firmly believe that I shall not fail, because I shall have in it the help, which I earnestly invoke, of all good Spaniards, and because from Heaven the necessary grace will be obtained for me by the ntercession of my never-to-be-forgotten mother, that exemplary and most 5weet Queen, whose premature death left in Spain, in the cause, and in my family, a void which has never been filled, and whose memory is an object of just and deserved veneration in every Carlist home. Strengthened by these hopes, I have promised on my father's tomb to remain faithful until death to this chivalrous war-cry of a dynasty of exiles : All for God, for country, and for honour. I am sure that in the depths of your hearts, which are sanctuaries of loyalty, you take the same vow, and are ready, as I am, to sacrifice your life to accomplish it. This vow which we renew before Spain is more than ever necessary now for her service. Social order, so shaken by the revolution, is threatened to its very foundations, and not so much by the force of the anarchist hordes as by the cowardice of the authorities who treat with them, giving them as hostages their lives and their interests. In the approaching violent strife between civilisation and barbarism, I yield to none the first place in the vanguard to fight for society and fatherland. Never shall the dread of terrorist anger cause me to draw back one step on the path of duty. I am a Spaniard, and there is no room for fear in my programme. Death and I have often met in the most sanguinary battles recorded in modern history. I was fighting then under the flag of a great nation which was not my own ; I shall know better how to offer my life for Spain my mother. JAIME. Frohsdorf, i,t1i November 1909.
