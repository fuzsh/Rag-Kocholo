        "text": "\"But time, the mother of truth, will, I hope, at last make her virtues shine as bright as the sun.\"\n\n- said to be the last words of James II and VII of England, Scotland and Ireland to Louisa Maria, the Princess over the Waterâ€‹\n\n1. Mary II of Great Britain : 1712 to 1743\n\nMary II as a young girl.\n\nIn April 1712, Louisa Maria Stuart and her brother, James Edward Stuart, the Jacobite Claimant to the throne of Great Britain caught smallpox. Whilst Louisa survived, her brother did not (i), and on 28th April, Louisa was recognised as the new Jacobite Claimant and styled as Mary II despite, or perhaps because of, her elder half-sister having reigned as Mary II of Great Britain (ii).\n\nDespite the fact that both Mary II of Great Britain and Anne of Great Britain would have been higher than their half sister in the line of succession, leaders considered that the \"Glorious Revolution\" was treasonous and that Mary II, William III, and Anne of Great Britain had gained power illegally and therefore their claims to the throne were null and void.\n\nWhilst negotiations for a husband for Mary II had previously stalled - the French had not wished to commit the Duke of Berry to a match with her as her position was as sister to a claimant and not to a King whilst Charles XII of Sweden had been cast aside as he was not a Roman Catholic (iii). A possibility arose - Antonio Farnese of Parma was the youngest brother of the Duke of Parma and of Piacenza. Although thirteen years older than Mary II, he was unmarried with no clear possible brides and his elder brothers had only surviving daughters. Antonio was likely to succeed to the Dukedom, and was under pressure to secure the Farnese line. Sadly, despite from all accounts a reasonably happy marriage, only a daughter, Margaret, was produced in 1716 - whilst the Dukedom of Parma and Piacenza could be transmitted through a female line, it could not be held by a woman. If Margaret had not married and provided a son upon the death of her father, there would be a succession crisis, as the title would transfer to any sons of the Queen of Spain (iv).\n\nBy the time Margaret was six, the Queen of Spain had produced two sons, Infante Carlos and Infante Victor. Mary II and her husband determined that Margaret must marry as soon as possible so that issue could be produced - a plan was thus hatched by the couple, that Margaret would marry her second cousin once removed, Infante Felipe of Spain (v), this meant that if Margaret and Felipe were to produce male issue, the Dukedom would pass to them and not to Infante Carlos or Victor, Felipe's younger half brothers.\n\nMargaret and Felipe were married in 1732 when Margaret turned sixteen, and Felipe turned twenty. By 1736, Margaret was pregnant and in January 1737, she safely produced a son, Peter.\n\nInfante Felipe was heir presumptive to his older brother, Luis I of Spain, following their fathers abdication in 1724. Felipe was prepared to assume the throne of Spain himself when Luis fell ill with smallpox and almost died - but like Mary II twelve years earlier, he survived, and in 1729 he married Barbara of Portugal (vi).\n\nA marriage between Margaret and Felipe also had the benefit of bringing Spain onto the side of the Jacobite Claimants to Britain, alongside support from the French. It could, if Luis and Barbara had yielded no heirs, whilst Margaret and Felipe had, have placed the Jacobite Claimant directly onto the throne of Spain (vii). Having the support of France and Spain was one thing but having direct command of the nation's army and navy was another entirely.\n\nAntonio committed the Duchy of Parma to stand with France and Spain in support or Stanislaus I of Poland during the War of the Polish Succession. This made sense given that Margaret and Luis had married within the prior twelve months. Due to the outcome of the War, Austria absorbed the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza but the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily was handed to Antonio by Luis I of Spain in recognition for the Parmese support and to ensure, in the long run, Bourbon succession there as well as in Spain and France (viii).\n\nKing Antonio I of Naples and Sicily, former Duke of Parma and of Piacenza\n\nAnd therefore, Mary II became Queen Consort of Naples and Sicily (as well as Jerusalem by default) from 1735 until Antonio died in 1740 at which point she became styled as Queen Mary, the Dowager Queen (ix) and retired to the Villa Capodimonte country estate (x), received regular news from the Palace of Portici of how Naples and Sicily navigated the War of the Austrian Succession as well as regular visits from her daughter.\n\nShe would die suddenly in 1743.\n\ni) Louisa Maria and James III did catch smallpox in 1712 IOTL. Here, the outcome is reversed, with Louisa Maria surviving and James III passing away.\n\nii) Louisa Maria reportedly had a good relationship with her elder half sisters. There are even disputes as to whether Mary II begins her claim in 1712 or in 1714 after the death of her half-sister, Anne.\n\niii) Louisa Maria was considered OTL as a match for both the Duke of Berry and the King of Sweden, and rejected for the reasons given here.\n\niv) Maria Luisa of Savoy, the first wife of Phillip V of Spain is the mother of Luis I and Mary's son-in-law, Felipe. Elisabeth Farnese is his second wife, and Antonio's niece through his late elder brother, Odoardo.\n\nv) Maria Luisa of Savoy is the great granddaughter of Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland via his daughter, Henrietta. Which makes Margaret and Felipe second cousins once removed. OTL Felipe dies in 1719, but survives here.\n\nvi) Luis of Spain died of smallpox a few months into his reign IOTL which caused his father to return to the throne. He survives, and eventually marries his younger brother Ferdinands OTL wife, Barbara.\n\nvii) Peter (named for his father Felipe _Peter_ Gabriel) is therefore heir presumptive of his grandfather, Antonio, second in line to the throne of Great Britain in the Jacobite Claimant after his mother, and second in line to the throne of Spain after his father.\n\nviii) OTL, the Duke of Parma at the time of the War of the Polish Succession, was the son of Philip V of Spain. Antonio survives nine years longer than IOTL but is obliged to provide the same support as his son-in-law is the brother and heir presumptive of the King of Spain. It works out well, given Antonio enters the war as a Duke and leaves it as a King.\n\nix) But not the Queen Mother. Naples ans Sicily inherit the inheritance rules of the Duchy of Parma meaning that Margaret does not succeed her father, but Peter does, with his parents as Regents. More on that next time, though.\n\nx) IOTL, the Palace of Portici was a royal palace of Napleanbut deemed too small for the court. Here, it is deemed acceptable and therefore OTL plans to build a hunting lodge at Capodimonte go through, and become the summer retreat of the monarchy.\n\n2. Margaret of Great Britain : 1743 to 1771\n\nMargaret of Naples and Sicily, after the birth of Prince Peter of Spain, c. 1737\n\nBorn 27th February 1716 at the Reggia di Colorno (i) to Luisa Maria Stuart, the Jacobite Claimant to the British throne, and Antonio Farnese, who succeeded his brother as the Duke of Parma and Piacenza and was then installed as the King of Naples, Sicily and Jerusalem by the Bourbon regimes in both France and Spain after the War of the Polish Succession. Married to Felipe of Spain in 1732 when she was sixteen, she produced the couple's first child, Peter, in 1736, this was followed by a series of miscarriages before two further sons were born, Antonio in 1744, and James in 1746.\n\nHer father had died in 1740, and upon the succession rules that had been transplanted to the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily from the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza, Margaret could not succeed to the throne, but could transmit the succession to her five year old son. Therefore, Margaret and Felipe became Co-Regents of Naples and Sicily from 1740 until 1753 when Peter reached majority. The period covered by the regency encompassed the War of the Austrian Succession, in which France and Spain supported the claim of Archduchess Maria Josepha as stipulated in the Mutual Pact of Succession of 1703, Great Britain and other nations supported the claim of Archduchess Maria Theresa as designated in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. Felipe and Margaret faced a difficult decision - remain neutral as several treaties with the Holy Roman Empire would suggest, or support his brother Luis I of Spain and his cousin, Louis XV of France. Initial recommendations from the Dowager Queen encouraged Naples and Sicily to remain neutral, but these entreaties fell on deaf ears and Felipe committed troops to support his relatives, and the claim of Archduchess Maria Josepha (ii).\n\nBy supporting Maria Josepha, it also had the effect of bringing the Jacobites into conflict with King John II (iii) (and as of 1745, King John III) of Great Britain. Whilst there were proposals by Luis I and Louis XV to Felipe that Margaret should allow them to sponsor an invasion of Britain in her name, she refused to lend her name to the plot, and the proposal went nowhere. Margaret was, much like her mother, pragmatic and determined to only act if the situation was right - with Luis I of Spain and Barbara of Portugal still childless, there was an increasing chance that Peter or his own issue might end up as King of Spain as well as Naples and Sicily (iv).\n\nTo build her alliances, as well as those of Naples and Sicily, further, Margaret wrote to Maria Josepha and her sister Maria Amalaia proposing matches between Maria Kunigunde of Saxony, Maria Josepha's youngest daughter, and Peter I of Naples and Sicily, and to Maria Amalia she proposed a match between Prince Antonio and Maria Benedicta of Bavaria.\n\nThe matches were provisionally accepted (v).\n\nAs the conflict drew to a close, it was Maria Josepha who was victorious in her claim and for the support that Naples and Sicily had shown to her, she returned the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza to the family so, as of 1750, Peter I, at fourteen, became King of Naples, Sicily and of Jerusalem, Duke of Parma and Piacenza. However, due to the distance between the Kingdom and the Duchy and under the plan of not putting all of their eggs in the same basket, Margaret and Felipe had first Peter I, and then Prince Antonio, abdicate their claim to the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza, and thus it passed to the four year old Prince James (vi).\n\nHaving divided their time between the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily and the Duchy of Parma and of Piacenza from 1750 to 1754, when Peter I turned eighteen and the co-regency ceased, Margaret and Felipe turned their full attention to Prince James, aged only nine.\n\nA year later, Peter would marry Maria Kunigunde of Saxony and by 1756, Queen Kunigunde of Naples and Sicily had given birth to the couple's first child - a daughter they named Josepha after her mother. By this point, it was a given that the fifty year old Luis I of Spain and forty five year old Barbara of Portugal were not going to have children. This left Felipe as heir and his heir apparent as the King of Naples and Sicily - a union of three nations seemed inevitable.\n\nObjections were raised. Whilst the treatise that had handed Naples and Sicily to Antonio I after his loss of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza had not explicitly denied a union of the crowns, it was certainly implied in certain clauses. Despite having the Holy Roman Emperor as the father-in-law of Peter I of Naples and Sicily, it was Augustus I who led the campaign against the union, provoked in no small part by Francis I of Great Britain (vii). A second War of the Spanish Succession was looming across Europe.\n\nAugustus I proposed that Felipe's line abdicate all of their claims to Spain, with the throne passing to Felipe's younger brother, Ferdinand. Felipe in turn proposed that only Peter would need to abdicate his claim to one of the thrones - with either Spain, or Naples and Sicily, being inherited by Prince Antonio and his soon-to-be wife, Augustus' niece, Maria Benedicta of Bavaria.\n\nThe conflict - variously known as the Second War of the Spanish Succession and the War of the Bourbon Crowns, would officially commence in 1757 and draw to a close in 1761 with the following fallout - that the Bourbon line in Naples and Sicily would abdicate their claim to the throne of Spain in favour of Ferdinand, also that the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza would be handed to Infante Charles Sebastian of Spain, Felipe and Ferdinand's younger brother (viii).\n\nIn turn, Infante Felipe and Peter I also forced through the Pragmatic Sanction of 1761 (ix) which changed the inheritance of the Neapolitan and Sicilian crowns to one of male preference primogeniture. This would, having been influenced by Margaret, ensure that the crowns of Naples and Sicily were retained by the Jacobite Claimants.\n\nUnless Peter I and Maria Kunigunde of Saxony had a son, then Princess Josepha of Naples and Sicily would become Queen Regnant in due course. To keep the nation under a Bourbon regime, discussions took place that Josepha would marry Louis William Joseph d'Orleans, youngest son of Louis Le Gros, the Duke of Orleans and First Prince of the Blood, when both reached eighteen in 1774 (x).\n\nThe five years from 1766 to 1771 saw Margaret gain several more grandchildren - from both Prince Antonio of Naples and Sicily and Maria Benedicta of Bavaria, and Prince James of Naples and Sicily and his new wife, Marie Zephyrine of France (xi). However, 1766 also saw tragedy as Peter I died at the age of 30 from pneumonia, which meant that his daughter would succeed to the throne as Queen Josepha I at the age of only ten.\n\nOnce again, Margaret and her husband were called upon to become Co-Regents to a young monarch as the Dowager Queen, Maria Kunigunde, had not been designated to act as such in the 1761 Pragmatic Sanction and subsequent Recency Act, perhaps to avoid any undue Bavarian or Austrian influence on the youth. The Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily had been frequently held in personal union, but they had also been distinctly separate legislative bodies, and it was Margaret's final great project that the two would be united - much like England and Scotland had united into Great Britain - and this was finally passed in both Naples and Sicily in 1769 and enacted in 1770 (xii).\n\nThe Royal Palace of Naples, now a museum, with windows facing onto the Piazza del Plebiscito,\n\nJosepha I was only fifteen when Margaret passed away in her rooms at the Royal Palace of Naples, she would be survived by her husband for five years and they would be buried in adjacent tombs, subsequently having their tombs relocated to the Pantheon of the Bourbons when the Caserta Palace was completed by Queen Josepha I and her husband twenty years later.\n\nThe Jacobite Claimants\n\nJames I, II and VII of England, Scotland and Ireland, b. 1633, r. 1685 to 1688, d. 1701, m.

King Antonio I of Naples and Sicily did not become Duke of Parma until 1727, but often stated with his brother and sister in law (whom he detested) and brings his wife with him.\n\nii) IOTL, the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily attempted to remain neutral too. Here, there are some changes - Mary II wants to remain neutral in the conflict, given that she's already seen Parma taken from her husband, she's aware that could happen with Naples should the War take a turn against them. Felipe is more impulsive than his younger brother - he is, after all, heir presumptive to Spain so losing Naples and Sicily doesn't really concern him. His loyalty is to Team Bourbon.\n\niii) King John II ruled from 1714 to 1745, then his sons John III from 1745 to 1748 and Francis I from 1748 to 1803. These are from the House of Bridgewater - and yes, that does mean that the Act of Settlement went slightly differently.\n\niv) Margret probably didn't want to commit troops to the War of the Austrian Succession either, she knows she needs to maintain a reasonable position in Europe and make alliances if the Jacobites intend to claim the British throne at some point. Clearly the Treaty of Vienna went differently than IOTL as a union of Naples, Sicily and Spain isn't outright forbidden as of the War of the Austrian Succession.\n\nv) Margaret knows they have the Bourbons on their side, here she's hoping to build the alliance with the Holy Roman Empire, given she's seen Naples and Sicily drawn into a conflict she doesn't want them to be. You better believe this causes marital strife between Margaret and Felipe.\n\nvi) The Duchy of Parma and Piacenza is like a football, passed to Austria after the War of the Polish Succession, to the Bourbons after the War of the Austrian Succession and then passed to another Bourbon holder after the War of the Bourbon Crowns.\n\nvii) Britain stirring the proverbial pot here - getting Augustus I and the Holy Roman Empire to do their dirty work by reducing the amount of power that the Jacobites could come to yield, convincing Augustus I by indicating that such a large power could come to threaten even the HRE.\n\nviii) Basically, the HRE get their way - Felipe abdicates his lines claim to Spain, and Parma and Piacenza is back in play again and handed to Infante Charles.\n\nix) Felipe and Peter (but mostly Felipe and Margaret) force through a pragmatic sanction, which puts Princess Josepha in line for the crown of Naples and Sicily that would have otherwise passed onto Prince Antonio. This means the crown stays with the Jacobite Claimant.\n\nx) Despite the War of the Bourbon Crowns, Josepha still gets set up to marry a distant cousin (and we're talking about fourth cousin once removed here), youngest son of the Duke of Orleans, Louis William, meaning that Naples and Sicily remains a Bourbon (or Orleanist) power for the moment\n\nxi) Maria Zephyrine is intended to be a sister of OTL Louis XVI (here, simply the Duke of Berry), which by default makes James and Zephyrine second cousins once removed, it also means that Prince James is marrying his sister-in-law, Maria Kunigunde's, niece.\n\nxii) The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in all but name, and some thirty plus years early. But Margaret dies, and free from her moderating influence, will Felipe as sole Regent, and Queen Josepha in her majority, be able to hold the cause together?\n\n3. Josepha of Naples and Sicily : 1771 to 1802\n\nBorn 26th August 1756 at the Palace of Portici to Peter I and III, King or Naples and Sicily, and his wife, Maria Kunigunde of Saxony. After the death of her father in 1766, Josepha became Queen or Naples and Sicily and her paternal grandparents acted as Co-Regents for the first five years of her reign. When her grandmother, Margaret of Great Britain, died in 1771, her grandfather acted as sole Regent for the three years until Josepha turned eighteen.\n\nWhen Josepha had become first Queen of Naples and Sicily, then Queen of the United Kingdom of Naples and Sicily from 1770 following the 1769 Act of Union, she was the first Jacobite Claimant to hold a throne in her own right since her great great grandfather, James II of England, Scotland and Ireland had fled his Kingdom in 1688 following the Glorious Revolution. Mary II had been Consort, Margaret merely Regent, and her father had predeceased his mother so he had never been the defacto Claimant.\n\nShortly after turning eighteen, Josepha married Louis William d'Orleans, Count of Beaujolais, a distant cousin. Both were members of the House of Bourbon, though Louis William was of the House of Bourbon-Orleans (often just the House of Orleans), but it is from this marriage that the House of Beaujolais was founded - a cadet branch of a cadet branch of a cadet branch.\n\nThe first decade of Josepha's life had been dominated by the War of the Bourbon Powers and the fact that her grandfather had been forced to abdicate his claim to the Spanish throne, an action implemented by the Holy Roman Empire but ushered through by the King of Britain. Mary II and Margaret had been largely hesitant about taking action to assert their claim to Britain, instead focusing on solidifying their position in Europe and building alliances with France, Spain and the HRE.\n\nThis had been done - her Great Uncle was Ferdinand VI of Spain, her father-in-law the First Prince of the Blood in France, her aunt was the Queen of France, and her uncle was the Holy Roman Emperor. All that was needed now was the opportunity to cripple and reclaim Great Britain.\n\nThis opportunity came in 1775 when she was only nineteen and pregnant with her first child (a son, William Joseph, born in early 1776). British colonies in the Americas revolted against Westminster and King Francis I.\n\nLouis XVI in France and Ferdinand VI of Spain supported their cause, but not territorial expansion as both had their own colonies in proximity to the revolution. Whilst Emperor Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire was hesitant about even condoning the revolution. Whilst Queen Josepha - guided largely by her uncles after the death of her grandfather in 1776 - saw the colonies as rightful assets of the Jacobite Claimants, yet also saw the revolution as a way to preoccupy the British and allow for an attempt to reclaim the throne.\n\nLouis XV of France had previously briefly considered an invasion of Britain in 1757, but never put those plans into motion. The Choiseul plan had been proposed to Margaret of Great Britain, but Britain had successfully pushed the Holy Roman Empire into challenging Felipe of Spain's claim to the Spanish throne, and the plan had been abandoned. It was, relatively intact, proposed by Louis XVI, Ferdinand VI and Queen Josepha.\n\nWith a significant portion of the Royal Navy and the British Army occupied with the Revolution in the Americas, France and Spain continued to provide arms to the revolutionaries in order to keep the conflict going. A joint Franco-Spanish fleet would cross the English Channel and land a combination of French, Spanish, and Neapolitan and Sicilian soldiers who, the plan stated, should be able to easily defeat the remaining British Army.\n\nIt didn't go quite as had been planned. The British had a network of spies in the French aristocracy and King Francis and the Prime Minister, Edward Hawk, a former First Lord of the Admiralty and a member of the House of Lords, had managed to Marshall British troops to the South Coast to repel the invasion.\n\nWhilst the Battle of the Solent was a decisive British victory, the Battle of Lizard Point and the Battle of the Cotentin Peninsula were both claimed as victories for the invading forces. King Francis of Great Britain might have retained his throne, but he had lost the Channel Islands and the invading alliance managed to hold, however tentatively, Cornwall.\n\nWhilst Louis XVI demanded that Josepha cede the Channel Islands to France, Cornwall (or Kernow) was retained as an asset of the United Kingdom of Naples and Sicily and Queen Josepha installed her uncle, Prince James, who was also a son-in-law of Louis XVI, as the first Prince of Kernow.\n\nAfter King Francis and Parliament recognised Kernow as a possession of the United Kingdom of Naples and Sicily, and the Channel Islands as having been seized by the French in the Treaty of Bideford (1777), Prince James took up residence at Pendennis Castle, with his family later joining him.\n\nThe revolution in the British colonies drew to a close three years later, with Britain forced to recognise their independence. Europe quickly established trade agreements with them but the Continental Congress failed to yield control over the various colonies and they fell into civil war between themselves, which in turn threatened trans-Atlantic trade. By 1782, the major European powers decided that they needed to intervene and establish a stable government under a monarchy.\n\nThe major powers presented their candidates. But even this was fraught with conflict and complicated politics - no country wanted to turn the Kingdom of America into a defacto extension of a rival power.\n\nIf a candidate was to be accepted, it would need to be a candidate from a minor house. And then someone proposed Ercole Filippo d'Este, second son of Ercole III, Duke of Modena and Reggio, and a grandson of Charlotte Aglae d'Orleans, and thus distantly related to the monarchs of France, Spain and the United Kingdom of Naples and Sicily. Ercole was married to Christina of Tuscany, and was thus a cousin-in-law of the Holy Roman Emperor, and a brother-in-law of the Dauphin of France.\n\nIn 1783, Phillip I of the Federal Kingdoms of America was crowned and began his reign. An Emperor in all but name, but Emperor Francis I had been absolutely clear that Phillip could NOT be made an Emperor.\n\nThe world was peaceful for the next six years.\n\nLouis XVI was assassinated, and his son succeeded him as Louis XVII in 1789. This ended up being the beginning of a campaign to destabilise the French monarchy, resulting in the Third Estate forming a National Assembly despite the moderating influence of the Count of Mirabeau and the Abbott of Sieyes. When the King acted to dissolve the Assembly, the members of it, with support from factions within the First and Second Estates, resisted. As the Assembly stood firm in its position, and the King maintained his own determination to maintain the Estates General, regions within France began to operate with more autonomy.\n\nIn 1790, Brittany and Normandy announced that they, along with some adjacent towns and villages were no longer part of the Kingdom of France and were, in fact, independent nations. It became abundantly clear that the snowballing events could destabilise the balance of power in Europe. Whilst Spain and Naples & Sicily (as well as the Principality of Kernow and the Duchy of Parma) looked to provide support for Louis XVII, Britain looked to support the new nations of Brittany and Normandy and the Holy Roman Empire determined to maintain stability but appreciated the fact that the regional secession movement could also serve to reduce French and Bourbon influence on the continent.\n\nOccitania were next to declare their exit, leaving the Kingdom of France mainly the Northern and Eastern parts of the nation, their access to the sea being only via the English Channel and largely subject to British and Dutch control, under Francis I and Philibert II, the Prince of Orange. In contrast to the international agreement that had installed Phillip I in America, the futures of Normandy and Brittany now seemed to lie with the British and the Dutch, and between the two nations looked to install their own candidates.\n\nFrancis I offered his nephew, William, as Grand Duke of Normandy, whilst Philibert II provided his second son, Alexander, as a candidate for Grand Duke of Brittany. This move by the British and the Dutch also placed the United Kingdom of Naples and Sicily in a difficult position as it effectively surrounded the Principality of Kernow with enemy forces - and with the diminished support that Louis XVII would be able to provide, Josepha was forced to make a decision to open talks with Dukes William and Alexander, as well as the provisional government in Aquitane and the First Minister of Occitania.\n\nLouis XVII and the new King Charles III of Spain saw this as abandonment of the unspoken pact between the Bourbon powers, and this the engagements between fourteen year old Crown Prince William, and ten year old Johanna, the Princess Royal, with Carlotta of Spain and Auguste, Duke of Angouleme, were broken off. Josepha was forced to look elsewhere for matches for her two children - and for William at least, she found a match in Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna of Russia. This engagement marked a significant departure in both marriage and foreign policy of the Jacobite line, but Josepha felt it was a worthwhile one given that Russia had become an increasingly important player on the European stage since their involvement in the American Revolution and subsequent Civil War.\n\nJohanna in turn was married to Joao, Duke of Beja, second son of Maria II, Queen of Portugal and Brazil. This marriage would be somewhat ironic given that Johanna was the Dukes second wife and his first has been Carlotta Joaquina of Spain, her brothers initial betrothed. Carlotta and Joao had been incompatible, but she had provided him a son. Unfortunately, she also died in childbirth which left the room open for Josepha to arrange the marriage of Johanna and Joao.\n\nThe estrangement from the Bourbon Powers earned Josepha enemies at court. Her uncle, Antonio, who had never been truly happy with the pragmatic sanction enacted by his brother, had ruled through his niece. However, as she had aged, her reliance on him had diminished and with her marriage, the birth of her children and their marriages and subsequent issue, he had found himself pushed further from the corridors of power.\n\nAntonio looked to the Bourbon Powers for support, for allies who would support him with removing his niece from the throne and placing himself on it. But France continued to be in no position to lend help, and the alliances made with Portugal and Russia largely scared Spain off from committing any military support. The Antonite Claim was fruitless - for the moment.\n\nJosepha's reign would be defined by the conflicts that she had guided the United Kingdom of Naples and Sicily through - from the War of the Jacobite Claim, through the American Revolution, the American Civil War, the French Revolution and the initial Antonite Claim - and when she died at Royal Palace of Naples in 1803, she could not have anticipated that the next century would be just as tumultuous.\n\nThe Jacobite Claimants\n\nc. 1802\n\nJames II and VII of England, Scotland and Ireland, b. 1633, r. 1685 to 1688, d. 1701, m1.
