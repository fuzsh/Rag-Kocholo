It was originally the tomb of King Charles Emanuel III of Sardinia, son of Anne Marie d'Orl&eacte;ans. When his son, King Victor Amadeus III, died in 1796, his mortal remains were placed in the monument and those of his father were moved to the right transept. When King Victor died in 1824, his mortal remains were placed in the monument and those of his father were moved to the left wall of the nave. At that time a Latin inscription was placed on the monument (it has since been removed):\n\nREGI VICTORIO EMMANVELI\n\nPRAEMIA VIRTVTIS ET MERITORVM AETERNA\n\nQVOTIDIANIS PRECIBVS A DEO FLAGITAMVS\n\nDEPOSITVS DIE XIV JAN.
