The people here are proud to call Newnan their home and that pride is a cherished part of what makes Newnan so special. Citizens volunteer, reach out to others, and make community improvements. Many people have donated their time and energy into giving back to the City to make it what it is today. However, we do like to boast about our former and/or current famous sons and daughters whom we call 'Newnanites.'\n\nMilitary\n\nJoe M.
