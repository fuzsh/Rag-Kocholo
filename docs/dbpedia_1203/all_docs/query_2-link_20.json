Just add them to the list!\n\nLatest additions: Georgia Middleman\n\nOver 50 Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of Who Is The Most Famous Georgia In The World?\n\nRanked by\n\nBirthplace : Texas, USA, Blooming Grove\n\nGeorgia Carroll (November 18, 1919 – January 14, 2011) was an American singer, fashion model, and actress, best known for her work with Kay Kyser's big band orchestra in the mid-1940s. The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Roger Carroll, she was born in Blooming Grove, Texas, where her father raised sheep. Her family moved to Dallas, Texas, where she graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School.One of Carroll's early jobs was modeling for a department store in Dallas, Texas. She eventually went to New York City and worked for the John Powers modeling agency. While she worked as a model in New York, she took vocal lessons.She had her first brush with celebrity when she was the model for \"The Spirit of the Centennial\" statue at the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition at Fair Park in Dallas, Texas. The statue still stands in front of what is now The Women's Museum. She was a 1937 graduate of Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas and has been inducted into the school's Hall of Fame along with many other well-known graduates. Carroll came to Hollywood when producers wanted her to play Daisy Mae in a film version of the Li'l Abner. Her height cost her that opportunity, however, when she turned out to be taller than the actor selected to play the title character.Her acting career began in 1941 when she appeared in several uncredited small roles in films such as Maisie Was a Lady with Lew Ayres and Ann Sothern, Ziegfeld Girl with Judy Garland, as well as You're in the Army Now and Navy Blues, in both of which she appeared with the Navy Blues Sextette.She appeared as Betsy Ross in the James Cagney musical Yankee Doodle Dandy in 1942. She also did modelling during this time, appearing in advertisements for Jewelite hairbrushes, among other products. Anne Taintor used some of these advertisements featuring Carroll to express the voice of the modern woman.In 1943, Carroll joined Kay Kyser's band, (Kay Kyser's Kollege of Musical Knowledge), as a featured vocalist. Capitalizing on her good looks, she was given the nickname \"Gorgeous Georgia Carroll\", probably as a joking reference to the professional wrestler George Wagner, who used the name \"Gorgeous George\". As a member of Kyser's band, Carroll appeared in three films: Around the World, Carolina Blues, and most notably the Second World War-era \"morale booster\" Thousands Cheer which gave fans a chance to see Kyser and his band in Technicolor. Kyser's band has a featured performance near the end of the film, with Carroll delivering a key solo interlude of the Arthur Freed/Nacio Herb Brown standard, \"Should I?\" In 1945, Carroll married Kyser and made no further film appearances, retiring from performing in 1946; Kyser himself retired from performing in 1951. The couple, who had three children, remained married until his death in 1985. Carroll had been living in Chapel Hill since retirement. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is custodian of a large archive of documents and material about Kay Kyser which was donated by Carroll.Georgia Carroll died in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on January 14, 2011.\n\n2\n\nGeorgia Middleman\n\n12/27/1967\n\nGeorgia Leigh Middleman (born December 27, 1967) is an American country singer. Middleman sang from age ten at the Texas Star Inn in San Antonio, and began writing songs shortly thereafter. She sold recordings of her first song, There's a Rainbow in Everybody's Heart, on her elementary school playground. In her teens, she opened in concert for Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, and collaborated with Dick Wagner at age 17. After graduating from high school, she attended New York University on a theater scholarship, and worked on Off-Broadway shows and as a songwriter. Following her schooling, she moved to Los Angeles in hopes of starting a career in acting, but by 1992 she had moved to Nashville to pursue music. She worked odd jobs and played locally before taking a job as a songwriter for Polygram Records in 1997. Soon after she was overheard by the president of Giant Records at a local show, who signed her. The label released her debut in 2001, after she had scored two country radio hits in the U.S.. Middleman also co-wrote Radney Foster's 1998 single \"I'm In,\" which was later released as a single by The Kinleys in 2000 and Keith Urban in 2009. She also co-wrote Tracy Lawrence's 2004 single \"It's All How You Look at It\" and Sarah Buxton's 2006 debut single \"Innocence.\" Middleman is a member of Blue Sky Riders, a country music trio also featuring Kenny Loggins and Gary Burr, her husband. They released their debut album, Finally Home, on January 29, 2013.Middleman also performs with Burr as the country duo Middleman Burr. The twosome released their first LP as a duo, I Like The Sound of That!, in January 2017.\n\nBirthplace : England, London\n\nGeorgia Elizabeth Tennant (née Moffett; born 25 December 1984) is an English actress. She played Detective Inspector Samantha Nixon's daughter Abigail in The Bill. She played The Doctor's clone daughter Jenny in the Doctor Who episode \"The Doctor's Daughter\" and Lady Vivian in the show Merlin.\n\nGeorgia Hubley is an American percussionist, vocalist, and visual artist. She is one of the two founding members of the alternative-rock band Yo La Tengo. She is married to the group's other founding member, guitarist/vocalist Ira Kaplan, with whom she lives in New Jersey. The two would often see each other in record shops and at the same shows. Finding a common ground in music, and sharing a love of New York Mets baseball, they began hanging out and jamming together. They formed the band in 1984, and released their first album, Ride the Tiger, in 1986 on the Coyote label. In addition to her duties as drummer and vocalist, Hubley has designed covers for the band's releases. She also plays occasional guitar, keyboard, drum machine on the band's recordings. Georgia is a daughter of UPA studios animators John Hubley and Faith Elliott Hubley, and a sister of Emily Hubley.\n\nBirthplace : Malton, United Kingdom\n\nGeorgia Faye Jones (née Horsley; born 6 December 1986) won the Miss England 2007 title and represented England in the Miss World 2007 pageant, which was held in Sanya, China on December 1 that year.\n\nBirthplace : USA, Wisconsin, Sun Prairie\n\nGeorgia Totto O'Keeffe (November 15, 1887 – March 6, 1986) was an American artist. She was best known for her paintings of enlarged flowers, New York skyscrapers, and New Mexico landscapes. O'Keeffe has been recognized as the \"Mother of American modernism\".In 1905, O'Keeffe began her serious formal art training at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and then the Art Students League of New York, but she felt constrained by her lessons that focused on recreating or copying what was in nature. In 1908, unable to fund further education, she worked for two years as a commercial illustrator, and then taught in Virginia, Texas, and South Carolina between 1911 and 1918. During that time, she studied art during the summers between 1912 and 1914 and was introduced to the principles and philosophies of Arthur Wesley Dow, who created works of art based upon personal style, design, and interpretation of subjects, rather than trying to copy or represent them. This caused a major change in the way she felt about and approached art, as seen in the beginning stages of her watercolors from her studies at the University of Virginia and more dramatically in the charcoal drawings that she produced in 1915 that led to total abstraction. Alfred Stieglitz, an art dealer and photographer, held an exhibit of her works in 1917. Over the next couple of years, she taught and continued her studies at the Teachers College, Columbia University in 1914 and 1915. She moved to New York in 1918 at Stieglitz's request and began working seriously as an artist. They developed a professional relationship and a personal relationship that led to their marriage in 1924. O'Keeffe created many forms of abstract art, including close-ups of flowers, such as the Red Canna paintings, that many found to represent female genitalia, although O'Keeffe consistently denied that intention. The reputation of the portrayal of women's sexuality was also fueled by explicit and sensuous photographs that Stieglitz had taken and exhibited of O'Keeffe. O'Keeffe and Stieglitz lived together in New York until 1929, when O'Keeffe began spending part of the year in the Southwest, which served as inspiration for her paintings of New Mexico landscapes and images of animal skulls, such as Cow's Skull: Red, White, and Blue and Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills. After Stieglitz's death, she lived permanently in New Mexico at Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio in Abiquiú, until the last years of her life when she lived in Santa Fe. In 2014, O'Keeffe's 1932 painting Jimson Weed sold for $44,405,000, more than three times the previous world auction record for any female artist. After her death, the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum was established in Santa Fe."
