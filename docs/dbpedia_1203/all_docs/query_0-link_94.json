        "text": "Barry Van Dyke was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Dick Van Dyke (born 1925) and his first wife, Margie Willett (1926â€“2008).\n\nVan Dyke's television debut was as Florian, a violin-toting nine-year-old in \"The Talented Neighborhood\" episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show alongside big brother Christian. However, Dick Van Dyke advised his son Barry to wait before pursuing a show business career. Barry Van Dyke later told a reporter, \"He told me that if I still wanted to act after I graduated high school, then it would be OK.\"\n\nLater, he worked as a gofer on his father's television series, The New Dick Van Dyke Show, which debuted in 1971 and aired until 1974. While working on that show, he secured a part as an extra.\n\nHe worked with his father again in the short-lived series The Van Dyke Show (which was canceled after six episodes in 1988) and then the long-running series Diagnosis: Murder, which aired from 1993 to 2001.In both series, he had major roles. He also wrote and directed several episodes of Diagnosis: Murder. After Diagnosis: Murder ended, Barry appeared in the Murder 101 television films, again alongside his father."
