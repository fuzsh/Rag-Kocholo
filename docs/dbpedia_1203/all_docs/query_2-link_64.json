        "text": "Attracting new tenants to the South Atlanta area means marketing some of this region’s best features. There are amazing parks and recreation, tons of family-friendly things to do, and incredible restaurants with unique fare. Forest Park, Peachtree City, Morrow, and Locust Grove all offer something special to local residents. But it can also be helpful to highlight some of the celebrity ties to the South Atlanta area, demonstrating the success and nurturing environments of life in Clayton County. Here are a few celebrity connections in South Atlanta that can inspire fans to become residents.\n\nFayetteville’s Claim to Fame\n\nThere are several celebrities with ties to Fayetteville, Georgia. Even if you’re not into Zac Brown’s music, it’s pretty cool to know the Grammy Award-winning country artist hails from Fayetteville. Filmmaker and actor Tyler Perry is also a native. And Millie Bobby Brown, of Stranger Things fame, comes from Fayetteville, too. So residents may catch a glimpse of these stars from time to time.\n\nWhat Put Riverdale on the Map?\n\nClayton County International Park in Riverdale was the venue for the 1996 beach volleyball competition during the Olympics that year. Riverdale also has Hollywood ties as the film location for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. And Tyler Perry chose Riverdale to film his production, The Family that Preys. It only proves how beautiful the landscape is in Riverdale.\n\nJonesboro’s Sporting Celebrity Ties\n\nJonesboro is the childhood home for the Douglas brothers. Toney Douglas is known for his athleticism on the court as a point guard for the Houston Rockets. Harry Douglas plays a wide receiver for the Atlanta Falcons. These brothers remember their roots and have joined the Jonesboro community to promote back-to-school activities. They even started the “Douglas Brothers Foundation” to help give back to the children within the county.\n\nJulia Roberts Is a Smyrna Native\n\nOk, so Smyrna is more northeast of Atlanta, but you can’t have a celebrity Georgia list without mentioning the iconic legend, Julia Roberts. As one of the most widely recognized stars of Hollywood, Roberts followed her parents’ footsteps into acting. She has earned countless awards and continues to be one of the highest-paid professionals in the business, making Georgia proud.\n\nCelebrities Return to High School\n\nForest Park High School’s Parent Teacher Association invited Angie Stone, a rhythm and blues artist, back to her roots for a local performance. Stone has been awarded for her community service and involvement. She’s also hosted the South City Concert Series in Riverdale, inviting other top performers to join her cause. Additionally, actress Ellia English, who is best known for her roles as “Aunt Helen” on The Jamie Foxx Show and “Mary Lou Wentz” on Disney’s Good Luck Charlie, hails from Clayton County. She notably visited Mt. Zion Primary School to help promote a literacy tour a few years ago.\n\nIconic Backdrops for On-Screen Fame\n\nGeorgia isn’t just known for its celebrity ties. It’s also served as the iconic backdrop for countless movies, documentaries, and television shows. Mark Wahlberg’s Mile 22 and Cate Blanchett’s The House with a Clock in its Walls were filmed here. Marvel’s Venom, with Tom Hardy, was also set in Georgia. In addition, hit television shows like The Walking Dead and Ozark were also filmed in Georgia."
