        "text": "Did you know that the population of the United States’ state of Georgia is almost 4 million people, and that’s just based on current figures—not projected growth. And, tons of famous people have come from this great state!\n\nHow many Georgia celebrities can you name?\n\nFrom Raven-Symone to Kanye West, Julia Roberts to Jackie Robinson, Ryan Seacrest to Chris Tucker, it’s always interesting to look into famous people from your city or state. And of course, Georgia is no exception to the rule.\n\nLet’s go through some of the most famous people from Georgia you may not have known were from this great state.\n\nRaven-Symoné\n\nAt the start of “That’s So Raven,” the view from Raven’s home is a Georgia Peach! While her full name is Raven-Symoné Christina Pearman-Maday, this Atlanta-born singer and actor is known simply as Raven-Symoné.\n\nRaven-Symoné got her start on “The Cosby Show” as a child actor before moving onto projects such as “The Cheetah Girls,” “Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century,” and other features.\n\nJulia Roberts\n\nJulia Roberts is one of the most well-known and famous actors in the entire world. But, it may surprise you to know that she’s from Georgia!\n\nRoberts was born in Smyrna, Georgia, and lived in the state until she began her illustrious acting career. She eventually won an Oscar for “Erin Brockovich,” and is well-known for numerous other famous roles.\n\nRoberts is especially well known for her large and toothy smile. If you’d like your smile to challenge Julia Roberts’, why don’t you look into restorative dentistry?\n\nAlan Jackson\n\nAre you a country music fan? Did you know that Alan Jackson is a Georgia native? Born in Newnan, Jackson has gone on to become one of the best-selling artists of all time.\n\nJackson has dozens of albums, including “Don’t Rock the Jukebox,” “When Somebody Loves You,” “Thirty Miles West,” and many others.\n\nRyan Seacrest\n\nAtlanta-born Ryan Seacrest has co-hosted “Live! With Kelly and Ryan” since 2017. He’s also a prominent radio personality and red carpet correspondent.\n\nOf course, you probably remember Ryan Seacrest from his prominent gig hosting “American Idol” since it first began in 2002. Ryan has stuck with the show despite ever-rotating judges and even a network change (from Fox to ABC).\n\nJackie Robinson\n\nJackie Robinson is one of the most important figures in American sports history. He was the first Black American to play in Major League Baseball, integrating the sport for the first time.\n\nRobinson was born in Cairo, Georgia, before moving to Pasadena, California. Robinson first played in the segregated league for the Kansas City Monarchs, before getting his shot with the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nRobinson was a six-time All-Star, a 1955 World Series champion, and a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. He passed away in 1972.\n\nKanye West\n\nThe world-famous rapper and fashion designer is most famously affiliated with Chicago, but did you know he was born in Georgia and lived in the state until he was three years old?\n\nWhile at this point, West might be best known for his controversies in the media (ask Taylor Swift) and his turbulent relationship with Kim Kardashian, he’s certainly made his mark on the music and fashion scenes.\n\nWest’s albums include “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” “The College Dropout,” “Yeezus,” and “The Life of Pablo.” Or, if you’re more interested in the fashion of it all, make sure you check out YEEZY!\n\nWest has also been open about his struggles with mental health problems, and supportive of people working towards self-care.\n\nBrittany Murphy\n\nBrittany Murphy broke out in the Hollywood scene in 1995’s “Clueless,” where she played new student, Tai. Murphy, who was born in Atlanta, and went on to star in movies like “Drop Dead Gorgeous,” “Uptown Girls,” “Happy Feet,” and “8 Mile.”\n\nUnfortunately, Murphy passed away in 2009, at the age of 34.\n\nChris Tucker\n\nIf you’re a fan of the Rush Hour films, you definitely know Chris Tucker. Tucker was born in Atlanta, and grew up in Decatur. Along with the three Rush Hour films, which he costars in with Jackie Chan, Tucker has had a stand-up comedy career that has spanned decades.\n\nHopefully, we won’t have to wait until the rumored project “Rush Hour 4” to watch Chris Tucker’s comeback in Hollywood!\n\nDoc Holliday\n\nProbably the most famous dentist in the history of Georgia, Doc Holliday supplemented his dentistry with gunfighting and gambling.\n\nAfter moving west, Holliday eventually got involved in various criminal enterprises, culminating in the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. On October 26th, 1881, this shootout between outlaws and lawmen is one of the most famous moments from the Wild West era of American history. Three people were killed during the confrontation, which has been well documented over the course of pop culture history.\n\nClearly, Doc Holliday is an important historical figure who is a major part of the tapestry of Georgia. Holliday passed away in 1887, at the age of 36.\n\nEdward Andrews\n\nGriffin native Edward Andrews was a star of stage and screen during his illustrative acting career. He appeared in Broadway shows such as “So Proudly We Hail,” “They Knew What They Wanted,” “A Visit to a Small Planet,” and many others. Andrews may be best known for his role in the John Hughes’ film “Sixteen Candles,” but he appeared in many other major projects.\n\nAndrews passed away at the age of 70, in 1985.\n\nThomas Jefferson Byrd\n\nBorn in Griffin, Thomas Jefferson Byrd was known for his roles in several Spike Lee movies. His roles included parts in “Get on the Bus,” “Red Hook Summer,” “Clockers,” and many others. Byrd also did his undergraduate studies at Morris Brown College in Atlanta, before doing his masters’ studies at the California Institute of the Arts.\n\nUnfortunately, Byrd died in 2020 at the age of 70.\n\nCelebrities from Georgia have nice teeth.\n\nMost of these celebrities from Georgia have one thing in common — great teeth!"
