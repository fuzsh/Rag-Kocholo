        "text": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - The Carter Center announced Thursday a musical celebration in conjunction with its founder’s upcoming 100th birthday.\n\n“Jimmy Carter 100: A Celebration in Song” is set for Sept. 17, 2024, at Atlanta’s Fox Theatre, and will feature artists performing live tributes and special guests celebrating former President Jimmy Carter’s Carter’s legacy of service. Tickets are $100 — in honor of Carter’s 100th birthday — and are available to the public at here starting at 10 a.m. Aug. 5.\n\n“Jimmy Carter 100: A Celebration in Song” will feature voices from pop, rock, gospel, country, jazz, hip-hop, and classical music. Acts set to perform include Chuck Leavell, D-Nice, Drive-By Truckers, Eric Church, GROUPLOVE, Maren Morris, The War And Treaty, and The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chamber Chorus. Emmy award-winner Rickey Minor will be the musical director for the show, which will feature appearances by celebrity guests including Dale Murphy, Killer Mike, and Sean Penn. Additional artists and presenters will be announced soon.\n\nCarter has been in hospice care for more than a year. The nation’s oldest living president is set to turn 100 on Oct. 1, 2024.\n\n“Whether it was on his record player, on the campaign trail, or on the White House lawn, music has been – and continues to be – a source of joy, comfort, and inspiration for my grandfather,” said Jason Carter, President Carter’s grandson and chair of the Carter Center Board of Trustees. “I can think of no better way to celebrate him and his 100th birthday than a night of music.”\n\nThe concept of a concert to honor Georgia’s favorite son was born from his love of music, which has played a significant role in his life and career. During Jimmy Carter’s successful 1976 presidential campaign, famous acts such as the Allman Brothers rallied to his message of change, honesty, and character.\n\n“Back when Jimmy Carter was running for president, the Allman Brothers played concerts for his campaign because we believed in his vision for hope and change for America. We could never have imagined what a positive impact he would have on the entire world,” said Chuck Leavell, former keyboardist for the Allman Brothers and the Rolling Stones. “It’s an honor to play at his 100th birthday and celebrate a man whose legacy will surely continue to inspire future generations.”\n\nOn Saturday, Sept. 28, the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum in Atlanta is hosting a JC100 Film Festival from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. The library said it will be showing some of Carter’s favorite list of films that were shown at the White House during his administration. Museum and event admission is free.\n\nAs Georgia governor, Carter started the state’s film office after the success of “Deliverance,” one of the first films ever made in the Peach State. Released in 1972 and based on writer James Dickey’s debut novel of the same name, it starred Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox and Jon Voight and was filmed in northeast Georgia communities of Clayton and Rabun counties. It became a huge commercial success.\n\nCarter, according to Lee Thomas, deputy commissioner of the Georgia film music and digital entertainment office, “realized this is money coming from outside the state and bringing money to a very poor part of the state, and he wanted to figure out how to get more.”\n\nReynolds, arguably Hollywood’s most famous leading man of his era, used Georgia in several of his later films, including “The Longest Yard” in 1974; “Gator” in 1976; “Smokey and the Bandit” in 1977; “Cannonball Run” in 1980; “Smokey and the Bandit II” in 1980; and “Sharky’s Machine” in 1981, which was filmed almost exclusively in Atlanta.\n\nCarter was born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains, a small farming town located about 150 miles south of downtown Atlanta. He grew up in the nearby community of Archery.\n\nCarter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump are the nation’s only living ex-presidents.\n\nCarter’s last public appearance was in November at Rosalynn Carter’s funeral — the former first lady passed away at the age of 96, only days after entering hospice care herself."
