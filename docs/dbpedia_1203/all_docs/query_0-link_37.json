He was best known to audiences as Lieutenant Detective Steve Sloan, a homicide detective and the son of Dr. Mark Sloan (played by Dick Van Dyke) on Diagnosis: Murder. In the show, the characters' relatives were frequently played by real-life family members.\n\nContents\n\nBarry van dyke talks about his dad dick van dyke dec 1987 86\n\nCapture the Flag Starring Dick Van Dyke and Barry Van Dyke\n\nBiography\n\nMarriage and children\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nCapture the Flag Starring Dick Van Dyke and Barry Van Dyke\n\nBiography\n\nBarry Van Dyke was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Dick Van Dyke and his first wife, Margie Willett (1926-2008). He had one older brother, Christian, and two younger sisters, Stacy and Carrie Beth.\n\nVan Dyke's TV debut was as Florian, a violin-toting nine-year-old in \"The Talented Neighborhood\" episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show alongside big brother Christian. However, Dick Van Dyke advised his son Barry to wait before pursuing a show business career. Barry Van Dyke later told a reporter, \"He told me that if I still wanted to act after I graduated high school, then it would be OK.\"\n\nLater, Barry Van Dyke worked as a \"go-fer\" on his father's television series, The New Dick Van Dyke Show, which debuted in 1971 and aired until 1974. While working on that show, he secured a part as an extra.\n\nHe worked with his father again in the short-lived series The Van Dyke Show (which was canceled after six episodes in 1988) and then the long-running series Diagnosis: Murder, which aired from 1993-2001. In both series, he had major roles. He also wrote and directed several episodes of Diagnosis: Murder. After Diagnosis: Murder ended, Barry appeared in the Murder 101 television films, again alongside his father.\n\nBarry Van Dyke also appeared in many other television shows over the course of his long career. His other television work includes a starring role in the short-lived Galactica 1980 as Lieutenant Dillon, and appearances in Remington Steele, The Love Boat, Magnum, P.I., The Dukes of Hazzard, as Ace Combat Pilot and former M.I.A. soldier St. John Hawke in the fourth and final season of Airwolf, The A-Team, Gun Shy, Murder, She Wrote, Mork & Mindy, and The Redd Foxx Show.\n\nMarriage and children\n\nIn 1974, he married Mary Carey; the couple had 4 children: Carey (born February 25, 1976), Shane (born August 28, 1979), Wes (born October 22, 1984), and Taryn (born June 1, 1986).\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\n2019\n\nHeavenly Deposit as\n\nRoland\n\n2019\n\nThe Untold Story as\n\nEdward\n\n2015\n\nDad Dudes (TV Series) as\n\nPrincipal Miller\n\n- Pilot (2015) - Principal Miller\n\n2012\n\nStrawberry Summer (TV Movie) as\n\nJim Landon\n\n2010\n\n6 Guns (Video) as\n\nFrank Allison\n\n2008\n\nLight Years Away as\n\nColonel Burke\n\n2006\n\nMurder 101 (TV Series) as\n\nMike Bryant\n\n- New Age (2008) - Mike Bryant\n\n- If Wishes Were Horses (2007) - Mike Bryant\n\n- College Can Be Murder (2007) - Mike Bryant\n\n- Murder 101 (2006) - Mike Bryant\n\n2002\n\nDiagnosis Murder: Without Warning (TV Movie) as\n\nSteve Sloan\n\n2002\n\nDiagnosis Murder: Town Without Pity (TV Movie) as\n\nSteve Sloan\n\n1993\n\nDiagnosis Murder (TV Series) as\n\nSteve Sloan\n\n- The Blair Nurse Project (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- On the Beach (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Deja Vous (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- No Good Deed (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- The Red's Shoes (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Dance of Danger (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Being of Sound Mind (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Bachelor Fathers (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- You Bet Your Life (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Sins of the Father: Part 2 (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Sins of the Father: Part 1 (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Less Than Zero (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Playing God (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Confession (2001) - Steve Sloan\n\n- All Dressed Up and Nowhere to Die (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Hot House (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- The Cradle Will Rock (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- The Patient Detective (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- By Reason of Insanity (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Sleight-of-Hand (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Blind Man's Bluff (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Death by Design (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Getting Mad, Getting Even (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Out of the Past (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Swan Song (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Two Birds with One Sloan (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- Murder at BBQ Bob's (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- A Resting Place (2000) - Steve Sloan\n\n- The Unluckiest Bachelor in L.A.
