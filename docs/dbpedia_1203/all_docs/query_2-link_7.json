        "text": "Peach State of Mind: Celebs Who Hail From Georgia\n\nThe state of Georgia is known for its peaches, sweet tea, and oh yeah, a whole bunch of famous folks! From award-winning actors to chart-topping musicians, Georgia has produced its fair share of stars. So, grab a glass of iced tea (or a mint julep, if you're feeling fancy) and settle in as we delve into the world of Georgia-born celebrities.\n\nHollywood Royalty\n\nGeorgia can boast some serious A-listers. We're talking about the creme de la creme, the bold and the beautiful. Julia Roberts, America's sweetheart, hails from Smyrna, Georgia. Ryan Seacrest, the king of keeping up with the Kardashians (well, at least one of them), was born in Dunwoody. And how about Atlanta's own, the talented Donald Glover (professionally known as Childish Gambino)? This Georgia native can rap, sing, act, and write – is there anything he can't do?\n\nFrom Small Towns to Big Screens\n\nHollywood isn't the only place Georgia shines. Fanning sisters, Dakota and Elle, both started their acting careers young in Conyers, Georgia. Kim Basinger, the unforgettable Bond girl, was born in Athens. Even Hulk Hogan, the wrestling icon with the most recognizable mustache this side of Tom Selleck, hails from Augusta.\n\nThere's a singer for every genre coming out of Georgia. Country music fans can thank Georgia for Cole Swindell and Jason Aldean. Need a dose of R&B? Look no further than Kelly Rowland (Destiny's Child, anyone?). And let's not forget the hip-hop heavyweights Georgia has produced, like OutKast's Andre 3000 and Atlanta's own, Ludacris.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nHere are some fun facts that might surprise you:\n\nDid you know that wrestler Bill Goldberg was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but raised in Roswell, Georgia? Those Georgia peaches must be good for building muscle!\n\nCountry music legend Kenny Rogers wasn't actually born in Georgia, but in Texas. However, he grew up in Houston County, Georgia, so we're claiming him as an honorary Peach State resident.\n\nHow to Spot a Georgia-Born Celebrity\n\nWhile there's no guaranteed way to spot a Georgia celeb in the wild, here are a few tips:\n\nListen for a hint of a Southern drawl. It might be subtle, but those Georgia peaches might give them away.\n\nSee if they're rocking Atlanta Falcons gear. True Georgia pride shines through.\n\nIf you hear them talking about sweet tea versus unsweet tea, that's a good sign. This is a serious debate in Georgia, folks.\n\nFAQ: Georgia and Its Celebrities\n\nHow to move to Georgia and become famous? There's no magic formula, but hard work, talent, and a little bit of luck never hurt anyone.\n\nHow to know if a celebrity is from Georgia? Check their birthplace in a reliable online source or see if they ever mention their Georgia roots in interviews.\n\nHow to talk to a Georgia-born celebrity? If you ever meet one, be polite, respectful, and keep the conversation short and sweet.\n\nHow to convince a Georgia-born celebrity to come to my event? This might be a tough one. Unless you're planning a giant peach festival, they might be hard to snag."
