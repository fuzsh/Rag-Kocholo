        "text": "If you’re working on a group project, you want a Virgo on your team. That’s because these mutable earth signs settle for nothing less than perfection. It’s no surprise that none other than Beyoncé is a Virgo. She’s got all those classic Virgo traits—she’s hardworking, precise, incredibly talented, and she values her privacy.\n\nOf course, not all Virgo celebs (born August 23 to September 22, btw) are such proud perfectionists. But make no mistake: No matter their chosen field, Virgo celebs have worked hard to excel. They're ruled by Mercury, which means they're naturally intelligent, witty, and quick. Their minds move so fast that sometimes it's hard for others to keep up!\n\nYou might think that because Virgos are represented by the virgin or the maiden, they’re shy, modest, and maybe even a little boring. Wrong. (Although you can definitely see their angelic side in their passion for social justice and humanitarian causes, plus the fact that they’re the friends you can always rely on.) Virgos are earth signs, which means they’re ~sensual~, and that Mercury influence which means they are incredibly smart and have a quick-witted sense of humor. A lot of Virgos tend to be guarded, true, but they’re just making sure they can trust you before they let you see their true selves.\n\nAs mutable signs, Virgos are adaptable and flexible. This doesn't mean they're easy-going, though—it's more like they can be one person in the workplace and a totally different person around their friends. If you've made it into a Virgo's inner circle, count yourself lucky, because they don't let just anyone see their ~real selves~.\n\nWhat would you do if you were a Virgo for the day? if were up to me, I would use my Virgo energy to write three New York Times bestsellers, start my own record label, and maybe even host my own TV show here and there. With the outgoing and hardworking personalities of Virgos, no goal is ever too far out of reach.\n\nHave I convinced you that Virgo is one of the best signs yet? Here are some more Virgo celebs who might:"
