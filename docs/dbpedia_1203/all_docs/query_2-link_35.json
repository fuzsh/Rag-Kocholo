        "text": "Atlanta, the capital of Georgia, is one of the largest and most populated metropolises in the Southern United States. With a population of over half a million people, the city has been recognized as one of the fastest-growing large cities in the United States and one of the best places to call home. As such, the city continues to attract thousands of new residents from all corners the world every year, including some very powerful and influential individuals.\n\nBelow is a list of the most prominent residents and former resident of Atlanta, Georgia:\n\nMusicians\n\nDespite being nowhere near cities like New York and Los Angeles in terms of size and popularity, Atlanta rivals these two old cities fiercely when it comes to producing some of the best musicians in the world. Kanye Omari West, popularly known as Kanye West, is one of the many musicians who are proud to call Atlanta home. The rapper who doubles up as an entrepreneur is mostly known for producing several best-selling albums, mostly in the hip-hop genre. With a staggering 21 Grammy Awards to his name, he is one of the most successful and influential musicians of the 21st century.\n\nFollowing in West’s footsteps is Usher Raymond IV, a native of Dallas, TX, who grew up in Atlanta from the age of 12 and went on to become a sensational musician and one of the most popular pop artists of all time. Now a resident of Los Angeles, Usher is also a renowned actor who has featured in several high profile films.\n\nOther notable musicians who have had the pleasure of living in this celebrity-city include Australian-born rapper Iggy Azalea, rapper Gucci Mane, singer Keri Lynn Hilson, rapper 21 Savage, hip-hop star 2 Chainz and many others.\n\nAthletes\n\nSimilarly, Atlanta is home to dozens of highly accomplished athletes from all fields. They include golfer Roberto Castro who plays on the PGA Tour; Mark David Gilbert, a former MLB player turned consul; Olympian Gunnar Bentz, NBA hall of famer Hank Aaron, and professional soccer player Ricardo Clark of the MLS.\n\nActor and Actresses\n\nTo start off the list is Melissa Pam Ordway Gaston who features prominently on the recently renewed American soap opera-The Young and the Restless; Chloë Grace Moretz who rose to fame after featuring on Desperate Housewives; Award-winning producer Matt Battaglia; and Jasmine Guy who starred in the film-A Different World.\n\nOther notable residents and former residents of Atlanta include Robert Edward Turner III who is credited with founding the international Cable News Network (CNN); professional wrestler Ron Killings; and James Earl “Jimmy” Carter Jr., a former president of the United States. The list is inexhaustible.\n\nKenneth S. Nugent, P.C.\n\n1355 Peachtree St NW #1000, Atlanta, GA 30309"
