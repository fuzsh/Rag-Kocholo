(\"Soapy\") Smith born on November 2, 1860 in\n\nCoweta County, Georgia. Famous (or infamous) outlaw and con-man who left Colorado on unfriendly terms with the law and showed up in Skagway, Alaska at the height of the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. He was quick to organize his own gang of brutes to fleece the miners for as much as he could in this lawless gold-rush town. Along with many other money-making schemes, Soapy convinced the adventurous miners that he was telegraphing their messages to families back home in California or Seattle from his Dominion Telegraph Service. He then shared \"replies\" from home requesting money. He was quite willing to \"wire\" the money home (and into his own pockets) for the miners. Soapy took in quite a bit of cash as no one realized that the \"wires\" for his \"telegraph\" went a few feet out into the water and stopped. On July 8, 1898, a \"committee\" of 101 angry men finally came after Soapy, furious that his gang had taken over $2000 from one miner. The town surveyor, Frank Reid, faced a drunken Soapy in a gun-duel at the docks, and Soapy was killed instantly. Reid died a few days later. No one celebrates Reid much anymore, but there is an annual remembrance of Soapy every year on July 8 in Skagway. To many he is as famous as Butch Cassidy or Billy the Kid.\n\nTravis Tritt (1963 - ) Famous County/Western singer and songwriter; born in Marietta.\n\nTed Turner (1938 - ) Media Mogul.

A self-described \"womanist,\" she has maintained a strong focus on feminist issues within African-American culture. Walker won wide recognition with her novel The Color Purple (1982; Pulitzer Prize; film, 1985), a dark but sometimes joyous saga of a poor black Southern woman's painful journey toward self-realization\n\nMore Famous Georgians:\n\nFind more more Georgia famous people below.
