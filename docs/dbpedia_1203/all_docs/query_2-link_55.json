One of the premier character actors of Hollywood's Golden Age, Tamiroff developed a prolific career despite his thick accent, appearing in at least 80 motion pictures over a span of 37 years. He was nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performances in The General Died at Dawn (1936) and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), winning the first ever Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for the latter. Orson Welles, a friend and oft-collaborator, praised him as \"the greatest of all screen actors.\"\n\n6 .

She was Meritorious Artist of Georgia, People's Artist of Georgia, a recipient of Order of the Red Banner of Labour, as well as of awards of European and Asian film festivals, and has her own honorary star in front of Rustaveli cinema on Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi, Georgia.

Dodo Abashidze ( 1924 - 1990 )\n\nWith an HPI of 51.11 , Dodo Abashidze is the 7th most famous Georgian Actor . His biography has been translated into 15 different languages.\n\nDavid 'Dodo' Abashidze (Georgian: დავით [დოდო] აბაშიძე; Russian: Дави́д Ива́нович Абаши́дзе; 1 May 1924 – 26 January 1990) was a Soviet Georgian film actor and director. Abashidze, who joined the Communist Party in 1960, was named People’s Artist of Georgia in 1967. After his death a Tbilisi street was named in his honor. He appeared in 50 films between 1954 and 1988. Abashidze studied at the Shota Rustaveli Theater Institute in Tbilisi, graduating in 1949. He then joined the troupe of the Rustaveli Theater but after a few years dedicated himself fully to cinema. Abashidze’s film debut was the role of Bichiko in Siko Dolidze’s comedy The Dragonfly (1954, from Nikoloz Baratashvili’s Marine), which became a box-office hit throughout the USSR. Over the following three decades, the actor worked with all leading directors of Georgian cinema and worked in a variety of genres ranging from historical adventure to contemporary drama and musical comedy. Tengiz Abuladze and Revaz Chkheidze cast him in their successful joint debut Magdana’s Donkey (1955), Otar Ioseliani in Falling Leaves (1966), Eldar Shengelaia in Unusual Exhibition (1968), and Georgi Danelia in Don't Grieve (1969). Another notable role was of the shepherd Sosana who resists urban modernization in The Grand Green Valley (1968). One of Abashidze's greatest achievements was the co-direction of two pictures with Sergei Paradjanov: The Legend of Suram Fortress (1984) and Ashik Kerib (1988), where he also acted as well.\n\n10 .

She has been described by the Daily Telegraph as one of the twelve greatest ballerinas of all time, and in 2002 was named Best Ballerina of the Year by the US Dance Magazine. Ananiashvili has been a prominent fixture of the Soviet, Russian and Georgian ballet scene for decades. Shortly before the fall of the Iron Curtain, in 1987 a New York Magazine critic praised her as \"the best thing about the Bolshoi's Giselle whether she appeared in the title role or as the queen of the wilis.\" In 2014, a film of her 1991 performance in Giselle with the Bolshoi ballet was released."
