        "text": "American actor (born 1951)\n\nBarry Van Dyke (born July 31, 1951) is an American actor and the second son of actor and entertainer Dick Van Dyke and Margie Willett, and nephew of Jerry Van Dyke. He has often worked with his father. He is best known to audiences as Lieutenant Detective Steve Sloan, a homicide detective and the son of Dr. Mark Sloan (played by Dick Van Dyke) on Diagnosis: Murder. In the show, the characters' relatives were frequently played by real-life family members.[1]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nBarry Van Dyke was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Dick Van Dyke (born 1925) and his first wife, Margie Willett (1926–2008).\n\nVan Dyke's television debut was as Florian, a violin-toting nine-year-old in \"The Talented Neighborhood\" episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show alongside big brother Christian. However, his father advised him to wait before pursuing a show business career. Van Dyke later told a reporter, \"He wanted me to have my childhood. He told me that if I still wanted to act after I graduated high school, then it would be OK.\"[1]\n\nLater, he worked as a gofer on his father's television series, The New Dick Van Dyke Show, which debuted in 1971 and aired until 1974. While working on that show, he secured a part as an extra.[1]\n\nHe worked with his father again in the short-lived series The Van Dyke Show (which was canceled after six episodes in 1988) and then the long-running series Diagnosis: Murder, which aired from 1993 to 2001.[2] In both series, he had major roles. He also wrote and directed several episodes of Diagnosis: Murder. After Diagnosis: Murder ended, Barry appeared in the Murder 101 television films, again alongside his father.\n\nBarry Van Dyke also appeared in many other television shows over the course of his long career. His other television work includes a starring role in Galactica 1980 as Lieutenant Dillon, and appearances in Remington Steele; The Love Boat; Magnum, P.I.; The Dukes of Hazzard; as Ace Combat Pilot and former M.I.A. soldier St. John Hawke in the final season of Airwolf; The A-Team; Gun Shy; Murder, She Wrote; Mork & Mindy; and The Redd Foxx Show.[3]\n\nMarriage and children\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1974, he married Mary Carey; the couple has four children: Carey (born February 25, 1976), Shane (born August 28, 1979), Wes (born October 22, 1984), and Taryn (born June 1, 1986).[citation needed]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1961 Hazel Kid playing football on playground (uncredited)[4] Episode: \"Hazel and the Playground\"[5] 1962 The Dick Van Dyke Show Florian Episode: \"The Talented Neighborhood\" 1971–1974 The New Dick Van Dyke Show Various characters 7 episodes 1976 Stalk the Wild Child Volleyball Player TV movie Gemini Man Steward Episode: \"Escape Hatch\" Van Dyke and Company Computer Date #1 Episode #1.6 1977 Wonder Woman Freddy Episode: \"Wonder Woman in Hollywood\" Tabitha Roger Bennett Episode: \"Tabitha\" Ants Richard Cyril TV movie 1978 The Harvey Korman Show Stuart Stafford Main cast (5 episodes) 1978 Eight Is Enough Larry Phenton Episode: \"Cinderella's Understudy\" Mork & Mindy Dan Phillips Episode: \"A Mommy for Morky\" What's Up, Doc?
