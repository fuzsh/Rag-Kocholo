        "text": "Lawrenceville is the second oldest city in metropolitan Atlanta and it was incorporated in the year 1821. This city sits about 30 miles northeast of downtown Atlanta and has a population of over 30,000 people. Rich in history and culture, there are many well-known people from Lawrenceville. We will share some of them now.\n\nThree most famous people born in Lawrenceville\n\nWhile these people lived most of their lives in other places, both were born in Lawrenceville and went on to be quite famous for their day.\n\nCharles Henry Smith\n\nBorn in 1826, Charles Henry Smith was considered the South’s most famous writer of the late 19th century. His pen name was Bill Arp, and he wrote humorous pieces for the newspapers of Atlanta during the Civil War.\n\nEzzard Charles\n\nEzzard Charles was born in Lawrenceville in 1921 but raised in Ohio where there were better opportunities for African-Americans. In 1950, Charles became the World Heavyweight boxing champion by defeating Joe Lewis, which was accomplished by unanimous decision.\n\nOliver Hardy\n\nThe comedy team, “Laurel and Hardy” were screen legends in the 1920’s through 1940’s. While Oliver Hardy’s family moved often and lived in many Georgia towns, it was established that Oliver Hardy lived in Lawrenceville in 1900.\n\nSports Stars\n\nJonathan Babineaux – Atlanta Falcons\n\nJeff Francoeur – Atlanta Braves\n\nJonathan Massaquoi – Tennessee Titans\n\nBrian McCann – Houston Astros\n\nGrace Min – tennis player\n\nRaju Rai – badminton player who qualified for the 3008 Olympics\n\nChristin Stewart – Detroit Tigers\n\nDarius Walker – NFL running back\n\nWalker Zimmerman – Soccer\n\nMaya Moore – Minnesota Lynx\n\nCelebrity Chefs\n\nJason Ellis – He’s served food for Lil’ Wayne, Taylor Swift and former Atlanta Falcon Jonathan Babineaux. But today, Ellis serves food to Gwinnett residents out of a tiny barbecue joint ( Smoke 631 BBQ ) connected to an Ace Hardware store off Buford Drive in Lawrenceville.\n\nPoliticians\n\nHamilton Jordan – former Chief of Staff for President Jimmy Carter\n\nCourtland Win – politician and attorney (19th century)\n\nServed as mayor of Lawrenceville for two terms beginning in 1884 when he was 21 years old.\n\nRob Woodall – current member of the United States House of Representatives\n\nActors and Entertainers\n\nMoisés Arias – television and film actor\n\nRachel Farley – Country music singer\n\nJennifer Ferrin – actress\n\nRachel G. Fox – actress\n\nMichael Kelly – television actor\n\nMigos – rap music group\n\nRicardo Hurtado – television actor\n\nPoint of Interest\n\nIn 1970, Larry Flynt, Publisher of Hustler magazine, was brought up on obscenity charges. During the trial, in March of 1978, Flint and his attorney, Gene Reeves were eating lunch when shots rang out. Both gentlemen were shot by a sniper near the courthouse, and while neither of them was killed, they were seriously injured and hospitalized. A serial killer named Joseph Paul Franklin claimed to be the shooter while he was imprisoned, but no proof was ever found to support this. A movie was released in 1996 which was broadly based on an exaggerated version of this story. The title of the movie is “The People vs. Larry Flynt.”\n\nAs you can see, Lawrenceville is an important part of the culture in the state of Georgia. The city is diversified and the multicultural population ensures talents in every area of life are represented. Many fine people live in and around the city, and as this city grows and thrives, more local talent will excel, thus shining the light of notoriety into the region."
