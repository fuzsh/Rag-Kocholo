        "text": "Although he's a major Hollywood star now, George was born in Lexington, Kentucky, to parents Nina Bruce and Nick Clooney. His mother Nina was both a beauty queen and a city councilwoman.\n\nJulianne was born at the army base in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, because her dad, Peter Moore Smith, was stationed there as an army paratrooper. Due to her father's job, the Moore family moved a lot; Julianne also lived in Alabama, Georgia, Texas, and Virginia.\n\nAn only child, Quentin was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. Quentin's moniker is a tribute to his southern roots–and maybe a predictor for his future career in Hollywood–as he was named after Quint Asper, Burt Reynolds' character in the Western television series Gunsmoke.\n\nMaybe Sandra channeled her southern past when she portrayed the sassy Leigh Anne Tuohy in The Blind Side. Sandra was born in Arlington Virginia, but was raised in Nuremberg, Germany.\n\nSteve hails from Waco, Texas, hometown of Fixer Upper favorites Chip and Jonna Gaines. Although best known for his comedy and acting, Steve is also a talented banjo player. In 2002, he played the banjo in the Grammy Award winner for Best Country Instrumental Performance for the remake of \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown.\"\n\nNot long after she was born in Homestead, Florida, Chrissy moved to Japan with her dad, Mark Metz, who was in the Navy. Chrissy later moved back to Florida with her family and grew up in Gainesville.\n\nNo, he's not from Margaritaville, but Jimmy is certainly a southern boy. Buffet was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi, grew up in Mobile, Alabama, lived in Fairhope, Alabama, and attended Auburn University and the University of Southern Mississippi. During his first job, as a writer for Billboard magazine, he lived in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nJennifer was born in Indian Hills, Kentucky, to Gary and Karen Lawrence, and grew up in Louisville, Kentucky. As she was working on her acting career in Los Angeles, she often returned to Louisville to help as an assistant nurse at her mother's summer camp.\n\nMorgan was born on June 1, 1937, in Memphis, Tennessee. When he was a baby, he moved to Charleston, Mississippi, to live with his grandmother. He went to high school in Greenwood, Mississippi.\n\nLocated in the heart of the Bible Belt, Britney was born in McComb, Mississippi, and was raised in Kentwood, Louisiana. She even got her first big break in the south when she auditioned for the remake of The Mickey Mouse Club in Atlanta.\n\nOwen, the middle child of three boys, was born in Dallas, Texas. He first attended the New Mexico Military Institute, but returned to his home state and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin–around the same time as proud Texan Matthew McConaughey!–with a bachelor's degree in English.\n\nBorn in Nutbush, Tennessee, Tina started her singing career in church choirs. Tina has sometimes called herself a \"Buddhist-Baptist\" as she was raised as a Baptist but later converted to Buddhism.\n\nFrom the time he was born in 1963 in Owensboro, Kentucky, Johnny and his family moved to more than 20 (!) different places until 1970, where they ended up in Miramar, Florida.\n\nJennifer, the middle child of three girls, was born in Houston, but grew up in Charleston, West Virginia. It's part of Jennifer's job to get glammed up now for the red carpet, but it wasn't always that way. She grew up in a seemingly conservative Methodist family, and Jennifer and her sisters weren't allowed to wear makeup, dye their hair, paint their nails, or pierce their ears.\n\nNaturally, Harry, who started out his career as a jazz musician, was born and raised in New Orleans. He made his first recording with a local jazz band at just 10 years old.\n\nBorn to a teenage mother in Kosciusko, Mississippi, Oprah has been open about her difficult upbringing in poverty. She might have gotten the inspiration for her talkshow when she was just a little girl and lived with her grandmother. She was nicknamed \"The Preacher\" at her local church because she had a keen ability to memorize and deliver verses from the Bible.\n\nAnother Southern host with the most, Ryan was born and raised in Atlanta, where his mother said he always had a microphone in hand and would perform shows for the family. He attended the University of Georgia to study journalism, but left to begin his career at the age of 19.\n\nWhen she was five days old, Kristen was adopted by parents Junie Smith Chenoweth and Jerry Morris Chenoweth in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Kristen stayed in her homes state to attend college at Oklahoma State University, where she graduated with a bachelor's in musical theatre in 1990.\n\nBefore he was an actor on Cheers, Woody was an obedient son who was born in Midland, Texas. As a true southern boy, he told Playboy in 2009 that during his childhood, he \"... was a real mama's boy and deeply mesmerized by the church.\"\n\nAnother talk show host who opens up about her childhood is Ellen DeGeneres, who was born in Metairie, Louisiana. She stayed in the South for much of her youth and later moved to Texas and then back to Louisiana where she attended the University of New Orleans. Although she left school after just one semester, it certainly did not have an affect on her success."
