No this time it isn't one of the \"Mee Mumbaikar\" campaigns, but it was Cinthol Alpha Gaurav Puraskar 2004's clarion call.\n\nWith attendees comprising biggies of the Marathi entertainment industry to the political hot shots including the former chief minister of Maharastra Vilasrao Deshmukh and minister of state Kripashankar Singh, the fifth annual awards based on the theme Mumbai was true to the Marathi spirit... witty, yet wry.\n\nJust like its predecessor ceremony- the nomination night, the award ceremony started bang on time. Held at NSE complex, Goregaon, Mumbai on 8 February 2004, the Cinthol Alpha Gaurav tried to encapsulate the journey of the city from being a cluster to seven islands, to being a British Empire to the cosmopolitan city that it is today.\n\nEvery thing from the venue to the Gateway of India set designed by Ajit Dandekar spelt big. The grounds were packed to its capacity much before the event started. Resplendent was the word to describe the welcome dance number by Resham Tipnis and Rajeshwari Sachdeva. That sort of set the ball rolling for the evening. While neither the technical finesse nor the special effects were anything to write home about, the sheer energy of the show was such that nothing seemed amiss.\n\nWhile Sandeep Kulkarni (Shwas) and Uttara Borkar (Vastupurush) took home the honour of being the best actors male and female respectively, Shwas was adjunct as the best Marathi motion picture of the year. The show held under the aegis of Alpha Marathi -Zee's Marathi entertainment arm- conferred honours on Bapu Chitaranjan Kolhatkar, Prabhakar Panshikar and Vijaya Mehta for their contribution to the Marathi regional cinema and theatre in its life time achievement category.\n\nBe it angst ridden, musical act by Sachin Khedekar or the playful \"Mala Bhi Mumbayit Rahudya kii\" (let me stay in Mumbai), there was always an underlying message that the show aimed to send across. Akin to the Marathi culture, the programme was all about poking humour at oneself and yet trying to look at the brighter side. What it came across loud and clear was that Maharastrians desperately need to get rid of their underdog mentality and pursue their dreams with keen and focused interest. The messages of the lifetime achievement award winners seconded the same views.\n\nAn old hat at Marathi theater Panshikar, used the stage as a platform to voice his views on the sorry state of Marathi theatre while urging the politically sound invitees to look into the matter of excessive entertainment tax.\n\nThe penultimate act of the evening, by the man that made it big in the big bad Bollywood, Mahesh Manjrekar was fun act.... loads of style and minus any messages. As for the final act of the day, all the winners gathered on the stage for an impromptu prayer.\n\nHere is the list of winners:\n\nMotion Picture honours:\n\nBest Art Direction- Sumati Bhave - Vastupurursh\n\nBest Dance Direction- Manisha Sathe- Tarunyachya Latewar\n\nBest Cinematography- Deboo Deodhar- Anahat\n\nBest Narration- Neraj Vohralia - Shwas\n\nBest Lyricists- Ilahi Jjamdar- \"Suryoday Ek Navi Pahaat\" Shapit Majhi Priti\n\nBest Music- Ashish Keskar- Tarunyacha Latewar\n\nBest Playback Singer (male)- Salil Kulkarni - Vithal Vithal\n\nBest Playback Singer (female)-Devki Pandit- Not only Mrs Raut\n\nBest Story- Ajay Ahire- Not only Mrs Raut\n\nBest Screenplay- Sandeep Sawant- Shwas\n\nBest Dialogues- Sandeep Sawant- Shwas\n\nBest Child Artiste- Ashwin Chitale- Shwas\n\nBest Actor (male)- Sandeep Kulkarni- Shwas\n\nBest Actor (female)- Uttara Borkar- Vastupurush\n\nBest Director- Sandeep Sawant- Shwas\n\nBest Movie- Shwas\n\nTheatre honours:\n\nBest Screenplay- Pravin Mulay- Celebration\n\nBest Light effects- Sheetal Talphade- Kaala ya laglaya jiva\n\nBest Story- Dr Shirish Athavle- Mitr\n\nBest Music- Nirmal Kumar- Lagnakallol\n\nBest supporting actor (female)- Geetanjali Kulkarni-Lagnakallol\n\nBest supporting actor (male)- Vaibhav Mangle- Lagnakallol\n\nBest Direction- Paresh Mokashi- Lagnakallol\n\nBest Theatre Production - Lagnakallol\n\nBest Experimental Play- Darshan- Mita Arts Kalyan\n\nIntercollegiate Theatre Production\n\nBest Actor (female)- One act play- Purva Shinde - Black Out\n\nBest Actor (male)- One act play- Sachin Shinde- Black Out\n\nBest One act play- Black Out - HPT abd AIK Commerce and Arts University Nasik\n\nMusic Album:\n\nBest Lyricists- Chandrasekhar Sonkar- \"Jivant Aahe Jara Jara Me\" Bedhund\n\nBest Singer- Swapnil Bandodkar- \"Ha Chandra Tujhya Sathi\" Bedhund\n\nBest Singer (female)- Panchami- Tanuja Jog \" Tanha\" Yaad tujhi chhalte\n\nBest Music - Nandu Honap- Yaad tujhi chhalte\n\nBest Album- Yaad tujhi chhalte - Wings\n\nSpecial Cinthol Alpha Gaurav Awards 2004:"
