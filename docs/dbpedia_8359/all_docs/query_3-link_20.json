        "text": "Theatre was his first love. Despite getting movie offers at height of stardom, he left cinema to return to stage. His mood swings and temper was difficult to tolerate. At one point, he was jobless. Not a single theatre producer or director wanted to work with him. He was the one who brought the glory of theatre back to form. Yet he died lonely in his dark days. He was Dr Kashinath Ghanekar – the first and only superstar of Marathi theatre (rangbhoomi).\n\nHis biopic – Aani..Dr Kashinath Ghanekar (2018) ignited a new spark in my mind to write on the golden days of Marathi theatre and the rise and fall of the great legend: Kashinath Ghanekar. Yet something was missing in my write up on this great artist. I wanted to know who really he was – A flawed artist or a great theatre legend. Like every human, he had his own flaws. He was insecure, alcoholic and bit eccentric. Due to his restless spirits, it was difficult for theatre directors and writers to work with him. A dentist by profession, Dr Kashinath Ghanekar started his struggle as actor in theatre as a prompter. Dr Kashinath Ghanekar’s father never approved of his love for acting and theatre. Though Dr Kashinath Ghanekar was at his height of success in theatre world, he couldn’t win the admiration of his father till the last breath of his life.\n\nIn 50’s and 60’s, acting work wasn’t looked up as a noble profession by well-cultured families. It was the era of late 60’s when Bollywood movies had taken nation by storm. Marathi Rangbhoomi (theatre) was suffering a setback. There was not a single actor who could breathe a new life in the stage plays. At this juncture, Dr Kashinath Ghanekar’s play – ‘Raigada jevha jaag yete’ pulled theatre lovers back to stage plays. His role as Chattrapati Sambhaji sent patriotic goosebumps in minds of audience. Ticket counters were always houseful. People crowded literally to shake hands with him. There was euphoria, craze and adulation for him. Dr Kashinath Ghanekar was on top of the world. He had his own era. But his success was shortlived. His glorious days were over.\n\nIt is been said that a fanatic fan used to give threatening call to him. The fan couldn’t see his hero succumb to alcohol and fall midway during performance. Dr Kashinath Ghanekar literally went to depression when he discovered that his fan had committed suicide. He had lost one of his dearest fans.\n\nHis addiction to alcohol, his rivalry with contemporary actors like Dr Shriram Lagoo and his arrogant behavior with his co-actors were his major flaws that brought an abrupt end to his career as an actor. Marathi theatre was changing. But Kashinath was still stuck in glory of his old days. He couldn’t adapt himself to the changing dynamics of theatre. Even the theatre association wasn’t ready to cast him in his plays. It was only Kashinath’s friend Prabhakar Panshikar who stood by him.\n\nHe wanted to make a comeback. Sadly, he died broken-hearted due to cardiac arrest during his tour to Amravati. Had he survived, Dr Kashinath Ghanekar would have taken Marathi theatre to next level. No one recognized his worth except his second wife – Mrs Kanchan Ghanekar. Her book – Nath Ha Maaza is a memoir cum biography which gives a glimpse at the intimate moments and events occurred in life of late Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar. Even the biopic ‘Aani Dr Kashinath Ghanekar’ was based on ‘Nath Ha Maza’.\n\nEven today the theatre audiences remember Dr Kashinath Ghanekar for his iconic role as ‘Lalya’ in the longest running play ‘Ashrunchi Jhale Phule’. It was role of ‘Lalya’ that made him a household name in world of theatre. His notable works include the successful plays – ‘Garambhica Bapu’, ‘Anandi Gopal’ and ‘Raigadala Jevha Jaag Yete’. I had seen some of his movies – ‘Paathlag’, ‘Ha Khel Savlyancha’ during my childhood days. It took me several decades to know about his legendary legacy in the biopic – Aani Dr Kashinath Ghanekar.\n\nEven today’s Bollywood superstars like Akshay Kumar, Shahrukh Khan don’t enjoy that fan following like Dr Kashinath Ghanekar did. Today Dr Kashinath Ghanekar may be forgotten, but his legacy lives on through his plays and movies. This write up is reminiscence of old days of Marathi theatre and artists who dedicated themselves to the craft. Through this blog post, I wanted to pay homage to the legendary artist Dr Kashinath Ghanekar whom the theatre fraternity always misquoted.\n\nTo know more about Dr Kashinath Ghanekar’s legacy, I highly recommend the book – Nath Ha Maza penned by his wife Mrs Kanchan Ghanekar."
