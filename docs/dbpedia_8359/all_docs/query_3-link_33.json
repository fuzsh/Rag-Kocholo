        "text": "Godse play irked people with its title, says Marathi actor\n\n''The fate of Mi Nathuram Godse Boltoy (I am Nathuram Godse speaking) would have been different had it been enacted with a different name,'' says senior Marathi stage actor Prabhakar Panshikar.\n\nSpeaking on the recent controversy over the play, which portrays Godse's version of the Gandhi assassination, Panshikar said the play was hyped by the media and came into the limelight due to its title which openly suggested what the play was all about.\n\n''Around 80 shows of the Gujarati version of the same play were staged in Bombay and in Gujarat, as Ahuti, but there was no objection or demonstrations against it,'' he pointed out. It was because of its title that the play was targeted, he said.\n\nPanshikar said although he had not seen the play, he experienced the reactions of the audience backstage and was surprised at the applause it received at its very first stage show at Shivaji Mandir in central Bombay.\n\nPanshikar said although certain parties politicised the issue, the play is a must-see in order to get a clear picture of what the writer has to say and whether he has said it justly.\n\nUNI"
