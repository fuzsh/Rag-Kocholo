        "text": "Prabhakar Panshikar, Marathi drama legend would have been 81 today. On this occasion, his nephew, Anant Panshikar who helms the home banner Natya Sampada now has organised the screening of the video of Prabhakar Panshikar's iconic play 'To Mee Navhech'. \"This is the first ever screening of the video of the play,\" informs Anant.\n\nThe show is open to all the fans of Lakhoba Lokhande, the role of a con man who swindles vulnerable women through five different disguises, that Panshikar had played with endearing adeptnee. Written by Acharya Atre and performed on the revolving stage - the play was first staged in 1962. The opening show was performed at New Delhi where the audience was regaled by Panshikar's deft and mannerism changes as Lakboba Lokhande. The play was subsequently translated in Kannada and Gujarati, with Panshikar playing the lead roles. Panshikar decided to give up the role after he had completed more than 2,000 shows of the play. The video screening would be a unique tribute to the iconic Lakhoba Lokhande's character.\n\nDate: March 14, 2011\n\nVenue: Yashwant Natya Mandir, Matunga, Mumbai\n\nTime: 4 pm\n\nread / post your comments\n\nMore on Theatre Update\n\n- 22 Plays, 22 Languages, 1 Stage - Prem Utsav 2024 by Mujeeb Khan (new)\n\n- Makrand Deshpande announces ''ANSH MANCH'' Theatre Festival at Prithvi\n\n- An exquisite evening of Theatre and Performing Arts held in Hyderabad National icons light up the stage\n\n- Unicorn Actors Studio pays tribute to late Tripurari Sharma\n\n- USHA KI KIRAN - A Five-Day Summer Theatre Festival in Kolkata\n\n- Plays Happening this week: 29th May - 02nd June 2024\n\n- AI fever hits Marathi play AAJJI BAI JORAT!\n\n- Interesting Plays Happening This Weekend\n\n- Lists Of Plays Happening This Weekend\n\n- Don't miss: Ila Arun - K K Raina's AJAATSHATRU\n\n- Ebrahim Alkazi's Biography Released\n\n- Theatre Community Pays Tribute to Begum Razia Baig\n\n- World Theatre Day 2024 message by Jon FOSSE\n\n- WORLD THEATRE DAY 2024: Check Out what theatre fraternity has to speak\n\n- RAGHUNATH SWEEPS META\n\nTheatre Update Archives"
