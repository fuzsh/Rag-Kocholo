Recipient of several prestigious awards, Panshikar has made his mark in performances throughout India as well as in Europe, the United States, and the Middle East.\n\nPanshikar was born into a family of Sanskrit scholars and classical musicians. He is the son of the eminent Marathi stage actor and producer Prabhakar Panshikar. Panshikar's aptitude for music was recognized by him and fostered him from an early age. He began his formal study of music in Mumbai at the age of eleven. He learned music from the late Vasantrao Kulkarni for two years. Later he took training from the doyen of Jaipur gharana, Kishori Amonkar from the age of 17, over the next 20â22 years. During this time, Raghunandan had the rare fortune to be guided by Kishori Tai's mother, Mogubai Kurdikar.\n\nHe has received many prestigious rewards like Smt. Manik Varma Puraskar and Upadhye Smriti Puraskar for their contribution to Indian Classical Music.
