This programme would be organised in response to her contribution to Hindustani Classical Music. Amonkar was the leading exponent of the Jaipur gharana. She prioritised the expression of emotion in her music, she frequently departed from the gharana's conventions of rhythm, ornamentation, and broader musical structure in order to intensify the impact of the music. And even if she was sometimes criticised for it, this was also her distinctive style.\n\nAmonkar started training as a musician at a very young age. Her mother was the well-known vocalist Mogubai Kurdikar, who trained under Alladiya Khan Saheb, the doyen of the Jaipur gharana. While learning the finer points and techniques of the Jaipur gharana from her mother, Amonkar also developed her own personal style, which reflects the influence of other gharanas and was generally regarded as an individual variant of the Jaipur tradition. Amol Palekar’s documentary Bhinna Shadja has tried to bring out the story behind Amonkar's music which is woven with comments on her music from masteroes like Zakir Hussain, Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia and Ustad Amjad Ali Khan.\n\nThe beauty and depth of her music is revealed in this documentary through conversations with many stalwarts. She explains the underlying philosophy of her ragas. In a scene, she tries and explains to us the underlying role of the 'Shadja' which may be a manifestation in music of Advaita (non-duality of the universe). The documentary even showcases her past lectures and of Mogubai singing. \"In that (her music) there is great happiness, great sadness, great anger, great frustration, great desperation — everything just comes into focus in this great concentrated little piece,\" says the tabla mastero Zakir Hussain about Kishori Amonkar's music in the documentary Bhinna Shadja. Hussain further explains that when he listens to her, it seems to be a painting that embodies every detail of someone’s life.\n\nSreening will be followed by a session with Nandini Bedekar and Raghunandan Panshikar. Nandini and Raghunandan are Amonkar's disciples who had undertaken training under her for more than 25 years and had jointly performed for her on multiple occasions, and would be sharing their memories and experience of being with Amonkar.\n\nIn this edition of Museum Katta, Sandesh Bhandare will be presenting his research into the changing practices and ecology of the performance form of Tamasha across Maharashtra.\n\nThe form of Tamasha is said to have emerged about 300 years ago as an entertainment for the Moghul and Peshwa armies. It was predominantly performed by the women with a mix of song, dance and satire woven into a simple narrative.\n\nIn 2001, supported by a grant from the India Foundation for the Arts, Bhandare documented performances by various tamasha troupes as he accompanied them to yatras and fairs in the Konkan, Marathwada and Vidarbha districts of Maharashtra. His output was prodigious​. Over 7,000 still photographs ​have captured both familiar and obscure facets of the lives of a breed of performing artistes who have been so egregiously marginalised, both culturally and socially. In 2006, Bhandare even published a book documenting this unique photographic journey. The economics of tamasha tours, the intriguing differences in performing styles across various regions, the subtleties that belie conventional notions of tamasha, and the sheer appetite for life demonstrated by the lavani performers even in the face of impoverishment and social ostracism, are some of the compelling narratives that emerge from Bhandare’s photographs, marked by an unflinching observation of both the striking and the mundane."
