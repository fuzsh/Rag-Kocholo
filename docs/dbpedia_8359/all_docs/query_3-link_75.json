        "text": "Girish has completed his studies in hometown Nagpur. He took part in many dramas and plays during his college. And thus it developed his interest in theatre. For a while he did practice as doctor…but then what u called job satisfaction he did not have that so he switched his profession. And then Girish came to Mumbai and landed in few plays by doing small roles. Then did theatre from 1977 to 1983.Offcourse, there was struggle during initial stage. But every actor has to do that. The best thing was Girish got full support from his family. After becoming doctor people tend to ask why acting but at that time my family supported him very much so because of that he could get in to this profession.\n\nAfter theatre how did you landed in serials and films?\n\nIt’s an automatic process, to tend to go towards serials and cinemas. People start knowing you and then director and producer approaches you. But in all this I have done theatre more than serials and films…as such around 48 plays and 20 to 25 serials.\n\nWhat is your experience in this your career of 25 years?\n\nVery satisfied….during initial stage I felt to go back and start to practice medical again but then I actually took the risk of continuing but today I am more than happy with my decision. The movie ‘Dipastambh’ actually bought stability in my career can say it was turning point of my life. Since then I somewhat got established as an actor. but ya for sure I don’t repent my decision, I don’t practice now but just try to keep me update by reading books on the subject and also sometimes referring someone to any doctor.\n\nWhat you want to say about tremendous response you are getting for your play ‘U Turn’?\n\nIt gives me immense pleasure and the best thing is theatre audience is coming back over that it is coming because of the play in which I am acting this gives more happiness. Its being houseful most of the times and even translated in gujrathi for gujrathi theatre.\n\nNow your play ‘To Mi Navhech’ is coming on the stage…how does it feels to do the play like this done by legendary Prabhakar Panshikar?\n\nYeeaah…it feels great. I mean it is more than a dream role…seriously never thought that I would land up doing this play ever in my career…It is really fantastic. When I was very new to this industry I had nearly done 200 shows, a very small role by playing character called Aginhotre in the same play but frankly never thought that in this 25years of my career I would do this play. It is really big achievement. Prabhakar Panshikar said to me that you will definitely make it possible. Seriously\n\nexpectation are very high and need to be very perfect in every task while doing this Girish Oak\n\nplay. It is really very challenging and tricky but very interesting. So as for now I am just concentrating on my practice. Hope to turn out very well.\n\nYa sir, It will surely. Our best wishes are with you…Now we will turn to serials. Your character from serial Agnihotra is very famous. Tell me something about that?\n\nIts very tedious…I mean the character is written very well by the writer Mr.Paranjpai but this character is very strict and always angry on very high on principle and ya rude too; so sometimes I really find it difficult as it is very opposite to what I am in personal life."
