        "text": "Let us ponder over our Inheritance\n\nIt is rather fascinating to percieve, that the Karhaadaas have marked their names in more than ninety (90) fields of human activity. Many of these personalities, deserve ample amount of appreciation, which requires further to highlight their qualities for every passing period of time. Not only non-Karhaadaas, suffering from their traditional conditionalities, but even the Karhaadaas adorning the senior positions in society today, appear to shy from appreciating the qualities of their own bretheren.\n\nKarhaadaas have not developed the skills of lobbying for their own caste members. This is amply and continuosly seen in open and hidden forms even among other developed communities. Their ways, methods and devices for eliminating the qualitative people belonging to other communities are peculiarly the same. This has been carried on for generations after generations. It appears that for this, a calculative arithmatic to be effective from every possible corner is a pre-condition. Examples are noted, and run unto dozens for which a separate chapter is required. As discussed earlier, Karhaadaas are either unmindful of their own practical gains or under the heavy load of experimenting spirituality in practical life. Many times they even look like surrendering to the traditional ideation of luck factor based on destiny. Some Karhaadaas, under the deceiving burden of ego which makes them ultimately inactive for progressive positive results, are simply watchful.\n\nAbout 35 to 40 family names are common among Karhaadaas and Chitpavans. Majority of Maharashtrian Karhaadaas belong to Konkan. Those coming from Konkan are naturally Konkanasthas, is a feeling among many non-Maharashtrian people. Many eminent Karhaadaas, namely Shri. Balasaheb Kher the first Chief Minister of the then Bombay state, Shri. G. V. Mavalankar the first speaker of India, Shri. Govind Vallabh Pant Paradkar the late Home Minister of India from UP, Shri. Baburaoji Paradkar from Benaras, Shri. Madhavrao Sapre from Raipur, Shri. Deuskar from Kolkata, Shri. Shankarrao Deo from Saswad, Shri. Govindrao Talwalkar, Shri. Balshastri Jambhekar, Shri. V. S. Khandekar are considered Konkanasthas i.e. Chitpavan by outsiders of Maharashtra. I have toured several cities of Northern Indian States and have experienced this. Even in Maharashtra, great personalities like Smt. Durga Bhagwat, Shri. Suresh Bhatt, Shri. Golwalkar Guruji etc. are not known as Karhaadaas. Though deceptive, gainful publicity also carries temporary utility value, and therefore there is no discussion in the media about this!\n\nWe observed that many Karhaadaas full of praiseworthy, luminous and humanitarian based values have gone behind the curtain, not even remembered by those whom they permanently obliged. In fact, they have been systematically maligned, side-lined and even their contribution is either denied or robbed. This is done in such a way that the robbers become praiseworthy philosophers and the real owners get shown as culprits. Interested people may like to read two historical accounts. One is the (Kulavruttanta) of Gunye family and another is Shri. Wasudeo Shastri Khare's historical account. It shows how the hero of the Panipat wars, Shri. Visaji Pant Biniwale, among others, was heavily punished under the garb of calculated claims and fancied allegations, forgetting his qualities and contribution. This type of robbery under different garbs continues to this very day. Some Karhaadaas are yet to overcome their traditional, emotional and naive minds and realise the openly selfish, practical and deceptive mentality by which they are often surrounded.\n\nOn this background, it is felt as our duty, to introduce the qualitative personalities among Karhaadaas and the special incidences in their lives for which they are known. These are their actual time-tested qualities and not ascribed ones. A very very few selective from among hundreds of Karhaadaa personalities are given here.\n\n1. Shri. Shri. Chakrapani alias Changadeva Raul\n\nShri Chakrapani alias Changadeva Maharaj Raul was born on the ninth day of Ashwin, Thursday, Shaka 1043 - corresponding to the year 1121 AD, i.e. much earlier than Sant Shri Jnaneshwar Maharaj of Alandi. He originally belonged to Phaltan, District Satara (See Leelacharit - phalethani karadechiya brahmanacheya ghara, janma jaahalaa - 1st stanza (owi)). His mothers name was Janakaaisaa and that of his wife Kamalaaisaa. He was a direct disciple of Shri Datta Guru at Maahoor. Then he went to Dwaraka in Gujarat State. He was the Guru of Shri Govinda Prabhu. Shri Shri Chakrapani Maharaj, elevated 52 persons to the highest position in spirituality and bestowed the siddhis upon many. It is very interesting to note that he was really the first true spiritualist practising the principle of equanimity among different castes of society. By using his highly developed yogic powers, he entered into the dead body of Haripal and from that time he was known as Chakradhar Maharaj.\n\nShri Shri Chakrapani was the first ever great Saint of Maharashtra propounding the principles of casteless society about 900 years ago. He was also a great Yogi. Shri Chakradhar Maharaj became the founder of Mahanubhav Panth spread in Maharashtra and Gujarat.\n\nContentious utterances about the origin of Mahanubhav Panth were made in a Kirtana at Engaon in East Khandesh in 1907 AD by late Shri. Vishnubuva Joag Maharaj of Warkari Panth. They became the subject matter for discussion among thinkers. This made the learned Shri. Ramakrishna Bhandarkar and Shri. Keshav Appa Padhye to undertake historical research. This research resulted in a book named \"Maharashtra Saraswat\" about this cult.\n\n2. The ever sublime personality: Queen of Jhanshi - Rani Lakshmibai Newalkar\n\nThose who have developed the habit of positive and anthropomorphic thinking about the person and the prevalant situation (by deconditioning of mind), can comprehend the then condition of Queen Lakshmibaai of Jhansi. The crude juggernaut like power of Britishers, who eliminated state after state of eminent Marathi Kings and other care-takers, managers etc. was at the peak. No help from neighbouring states was possible. Even very adjacent states were busy getting adjusted with the new circumstances. On this background, the Queen of a small state like Jhansi, daughter of Moropant Taambe, most revered for her bravery by many North Indian people and even her opponents (the captain of British Army Sir. Hugh Rose) roared against the tyrant brutal attackers \"meri jhansi nahi doongi\" i.e. 'No Jhansi will be annexed to the British Empire'. The true and forceful inner quality is accumulated, as it were, in this utterance! This charismatic and true commander of a vibrant military force was killed in the battlefield and has been long since, the subject of praise of many folklores, ballards, plays, poems and stories full of inspiration. Even the British correspondent of The Times' reported on 3 Aug 1858 that \"the battle plans were effected mainly under the direction and personal supervision of the Ranee who, clad in military attire ... was constantly in the saddle, ubiquitous and untiring.\" General Hugh Rose regarded her as \"... the woman who was the only man among the rebels\". This is noteworthy especially since the same Britishers did not hesitate to call a big Marathi powerful leader a \"coward\" (Please refer to the letter of Governer Elphinstone about Bajirao II to Sir John Malcolm dated 29-10-1818; as fully quoted in the Marathi Book 'vishrabhdha sharada', and I quote only one sentence from it, he states \"I think you overlook the fact, that, personal cowardice is not inconsistent with political boldness\". Eminent thinker Shri D. K. Bedekar has given an apt translation of the word \"coward\" as \"bhekad\")\n\nThere have been some traditional thinkers unable to digest her valour and who belong to the category that, unless you say something against and find faults with qualitative, renowned and great people (but not belonging to your own caste), you will never be known as a real critic. Sometimes hidden and sometimes whispering type criticisms with suggestive words peculiar to their mental setup, has made it obvious. A professor of Pune University writes in a noted newspaper daily of Pune about the completion of 150 years of freedom struggle in general. While particularly he had to write something about Queen Lakshmibai; he writes \"surely the valour of Rani Lakshmibai is great, but 2 - 3 years before this incident, a Matang girl student of Mahatma Phule's school wrote a critical essay about equality, and got it published in Jnaanoday. Comparing this, by which standard could you put the student in a less important category (than Rani Lakshmibai)?\". Remember, a University professor writes this. He does not forget to mention what Professor N. R. Phatak, W. D. Divekar and Pratibha Ranade say about this (See Pune Sakal dated 29 March 2007). What is the similarity between these two things this great man wants to compare and emphasize on? Here a professor is comparing the valour of Queen Lakshmibai on the battlefield with a writing published in a local paper on the principle of equality! Surely this type of writing requires a cultivated intelligence. In this fashion and standard of writing brought into practice by people like this writer, any person can write anything, at any time, about any person who is established because of his quality, natural or imposed! He had found suitable references siding his calculated opinion. I have cited this example for us to understand the quality of this type of writing, which is continuosly going on in one way or the other. It is seen whenever the personality does not happen to belong to their caste or is a Karhaadaa. The pre-requisite is that you must possess a cultivated venomous mentality!\n\nEven then, beyond the kingdom of this mentality, there is always a place in the hearts of many to appreciate true and qualitative people. The Queen Lakshmibaai Newalkar is one such great Karhaadaa, who preferred to be killed in battlefield rather than living life as a slave!\n\n3. Kavikulashekhar Moropant Paraadkar; Baramati\n\nThe greatest names of marathi poets put together in one marathi verse enumerates four names and they are Saint Shri Jnaaneshwar, Saint Shri Tukaaraam, Waaman Kavi and Moropant Paraadkar of Baramati. They are the gems of Marathi poetry, where you find a serene confluence of everlasting qualitative poetry with heartfelt spirituality, a union of anthromorphic diction, coupled with high-quality poetic imaginations! Many scholars with clean mind and high repute have profoundly praised his qualities. Prof. M. N. Adavant, Hansa, Dr. N. G. Naandapurkar (who did a PhD thesis on his poetry), Prof. M. K. Saavkar, Shri. Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, Prof. M. N. Achaarya and dozens of other thinkers with hundreds of words full of eulogy, above any conditionality and free from caste superiority complexes praised him immensely. He died in 1794 AD but his aaryaas are still reigning on the hearts of thousands of his fans. This is despite the fact that the then Peshwaa issued a ban on his Aaryaas. Also, people like Krishnashastri Chiplunkar, P. G. Sahasrabuddhe and others have tried their level best to malign the quality and great name of this illustrious poet. Some of them, taking advantage of their acquired positions on the Government committees and also weighing the then political situations have craftily categorised him as a Pandit Kavi (Scholar Poet). This is an example of short distanced politics, a result of the malady within them, which was then useful in side-lining Moropant from the text books was played. Thus, the circle of accumulated wrath from the time of Peshwa was complete.\n\nHowsoever, the qualitative and marvelous works of a born great poet like Moropant, due to some inexplicable, intrinsic undaunted spirit; as it were, fought against all types of enemies including a tyrant ruler who tried to eliminate his image and his poetry, itself enlivened him permanently and evinced indirectly, that while an imposed and superficial show of learning and unreal scholarship though lingers and shines within the four walls of a house, will never last long! People in general who have no ruler to their side to get things done as per their desire and no media to express their true and rationally acceptable opinion; do have the appreciable quality of discriminating between good and bad; acceptable and non-acceptable and therefore, we see the present social condition in which the superficial, imposed intelligence and has been totally side-lined and overthrown, after seeing its ugly face in many fields of public concerns.\n\nA vibrant quality lover, Shri Paangarkar in his book on Moropant had described many incidences about this great poet. Among these was one when the Peshwa visited Baramati and with an insulting manner, ordered Moropant to provide him with entertainment by his keertan etc. Moropant scornfully refused this and with a retributive and sharper language thundered, \"Moropant performs his art for his own contentment, and not for anyone else! Never!\"\n\nAnother incidence was when the Peshwa grabbed the vatan and century old rights of Padhye family at Sangameshwar taluka. These rights were bestowed to the Padhye family from the period of Adilshah, a muslim ruler of Vijapur. Moropant wrote a letter to the Peshwaa, stating therein \"This is the kingdom of Chhatrapati Shivaji. You have confiscated the century old rights and watan of 12 villages held by the Padhye family, donated to them by Adilshah of Vijapur and not by you. That too for no fault of theirs and simply gave those rights to your relatives/caste fellows. This is crude injustice, improper and not even becoming a ruler.\" This angered the Peshwaa who issued a fatwaa (dictate) to his subjects, specially keertankaras, not to recite aaryaas of Moropant in their keertans. I am told that, even now, some keertan-performers obediently follow this dictate of the Peshwaa!\n\nWith the perpetual reverance at my command and with vouched adherence to follow your foot prints in my life; I pay my all respectful regards to you Sir, Moropant; whose name and that glittering fame will remain in our hearts for centuries to come - along with the principles of poetic beauty vividly perceived through your poetry!\n\n4. Revered Shri. Kashinath Anant Padhye, codifier of voluminous sacred book \"Dharmasindhu\"\n\nHe was in a real sense the \"Dharmaadhyakasha\", the presiding over judge pertaining to the matters of religion in both its theoretical and practical approach. His was the word, people held as the last word! His family belonged to Dhayari and Golawali villages of Sangameshwar taluka, Dist. Ratnagiri. Some of them came to Pandharpur and settled there.\n\nThere is a dictum in Sanskrit \"baabaa waakyam pramaanam!\" i.e. \"whatever Baabaa said is the final word for us!\". Writes Paangarkar in the book on Moropant, that Baba used to go for bath daily to the Bheema river and then return home. He was so pure that people on the already conjested road kept themselves away so that 'this purest person should not be shadowed due to our proximity!' One day after reaching the banks of Bheema, he found some people camping there in tents. On inquiry, he came to know that it is the Peshwaa who has camped there. On hearing this, Baabaa recognised him as the same person responsible for victimising his family members back in Dhayari-Golawali (referred to in earlier section on Kavikulashekhar Moropant Paraadkar). The Peshwaa, for no fault of theirs, abolished the century-old rights of Padhye family along with the watans of twelve villages and given them away to his relatives/caste fellows. It was a great loss for them, which made them leave the villages. Knowing that this Peshwa is responsible for all that, Baabaa went straight to his Paalakhi, took some sand from the river, threw it in the Palakhi and with a thundering voice said - \"WHEN A RULER HIMSELF BEHAVES LIKE A ROBBER, THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS POSITION VANISHES\". He cursed the Peshwaa and returned back.\n\nThis family has begotten another great personality, the most revered Shri. Maadhav Sadaashiv Golwalkar Guruji. His continuus efforts for 33 years not only elevated the spirit of true lovers of this great nation but also enlivened in them the confidence which makes them stand firmly and not as per fluctuating convenience!\n\nPeshwaa knew the respectful and true popularity commanded by Baabaa Bhatta Padhye. Although he had a man-force attending him, the Peshwaa was wise enough not to issue an order to arrest him. Baabaa went back to the river, took bath and returned home as usual. The truth has the greatest power! With great respect, I bow down before such an immortal spirit. Let us be worthy of realising the rarest qualities of these people!!\n\n5. Shri. Govindpant Bundele of Saagar\n\nShri. Govind Pant Kher (later on Govind Pant Bundele), along with the first Bajirao Peshwaa were chasing the enemy on horseback. They reached the banks of the river Taapi and had to spend the night there itself. When the question of dinner started nagging them, the only need felt was that of fire. Wood-logs were collected by evening and Shri. Kher went searching for fire and at a distance he saw a fire. Only after reaching there, he realised that the fire was that of a pyre. He took the fire out of it and came to their camp. On the question of acceptibility of the fire raised by Shri. Bajirao, Shri. Govind Kher told him \"The fire never becomes impure, the purifier is always pure! Our need is imminent, we need food. It requires fire and we just cannot enter the village at present in this condition. We have to prepare our food on this fire only.\"\n\nNow you will realise, why among Brahmins as rulers, only Karhaadaas were chosen for protecting the Northern side of the Marathaa kingdom. The inborn qualities are rarely seen and they run through generations!\n\n6. Shri. Visaajipant Biniwaale\n\nYou may have read the play written by Veer V. D. Savarkar, in which the great warrior appointed as Chief of Army by Shri. Madhavrao Peshwaa, is described as the hero of one of the Panipat wars. He defeated the enemy and brought the enemy's slain head to Pune. His name was Shri. Visajipant Chinchalkar. He used to fight in the front (Bini) of the army so his epithet became Biniwaale. The order of the Peshwaa as delineated by Veer Savarkar was to 'bring Visaajipant ceremoniously from Holkar Bridge to the Shaniwar Wada, pouring flowers made of gold on his head all the way!' His unparallel confidence, courage, valour, strategic plans and undaunted spirit of fighting as well as enemy-killing instinct was simply marvellous. As was the practice those days, he worshipped his family diety Shri. Dhootapaapeshwar near Rajapur, before proceeding for war. In his prayer, he promised that he would gift the diety a crown made of one and a quarter \"man\" of pure gold if he won the war. He was such a confident Chief of Army, that even while going to Panipat he went via Vrindaavan near Mathuraa, and placed the order of the gold crown to the goldsmith. Visaajipant asked the goldsmith to prepare it within three weeks so that while returning to Pune he could collect it. Till then, the battleground of Panipat was known only for defeats of Marathaas. To accept this challenge with such a history itself was an exceptionally courageous act.\n\nTo compare his valour, one has to read the book \"Panipat\", by Professor Tryambak Shankar Shejwalkar. It is a historical true account written after tedious research. It is a 'must read', not only for comparison but also for the sake of understanding the inborn qualities on an objective line.\n\nYou can visit the Dhootapaapeshwara temple near Rajapur on Mahashivaratri Day to see the crown and feel the pride that you inherit those same qualities for fighting enemies!\n\n7. Shri. Bal Gangadhar alias Balasaheb Kher, the first Chief Minister (Prime Minister) of the then Bombay State\n\nA great educationist and parliamentary secretary to the first Chief Minister (the post was then called Prime Minister) of the erstwhile Bombay State, late Shri. Dadasaheb Paawate from Dharwad while writing his memoir, remembers the glittering humanitarian qualities of late Shri. Baalaasaheb Kher (B. G. Kher). BG Kher was the recepient of Zala Vedant prize of Bombay University.\n\nA higher ranking 'Administrative post Selection Committee' had selected one Mr. Taambe for the rank of collector. On the same evening, the great leader of SC community met Shri. Baalaasaheb Kher. His request was that Balasaheb may excercise his powers as Chief Minister and get one SC fellow selected for the post in place of Mr. Taambe; who being intelligent, could get a suitable post anywhere, anytime. This was a testing moment for Mr. Kher. Excercising his powers in such a way is excercising injustice to a qualitative candidate. Mischief mongers, born intelligent fellows were even at that time, amply spread here and there. If Mr. Kher follows the selection committee's unanimous report, those intellectuals were free to allege Mr. Kher of selecting his caste fellow. Mr. Taambe was a Karhaadaa! Even if he was dropped and a SC placed in his place, even then they could have prompted to allege Kher for injustice!\n\nBeing cautious about these cast and subcaste politics and being convinced about the upliftment of needy people; Balasaheb Kher got the SC fellow selected in place of Mr. Taambe, not a relative, or belonging to his own caste - Karhaadaa!\n\nAnother striking example is the incidence of Baalaasaheb Kher's own mother. A pious God fearing woman with many inborn spiritual qualities, she was staying in Ratnagiri city, in her father-in-law's spacious bungalow on Kher lane (now converted to Tilak lane). She was passing her old days, staying alone and away from her son, the CM of the great state. One day a message came from Baalaasaheb that the bungalow in Ratnagiri is given for the activities of uplifting SC people. They will be using it as a SC students hostel, so she will have to vacate it and come to stay with him in Mumbai. The old fashioned lady was tongue-tied. She had to surrender, in her old days, to the wishes of her only son, who was not only the reputed expert in law but was the then Chief Minister of a great state of India!\n\nA still annoying example of Baalaasaheb Kher was concerning his own cousin brother Shri. Achyut Govind Kher alias Appaasaheb Kher. He is now no more but he himself had narrated the story to me in his old days; not with a sense of complaint against Shri. B. G. Kher but with a sense of pride that 'such a person was born in my family'! He narrated the incidence: \"In the same year when Baalaasaheb became the First Chief Minister of the then Bombay State, Appaa completed the course of manufacturing soap from an Institute in Mysore. He had also taken additional courses of factory management etc. His cherished aim was to run a soap factory in Ratnagiri on his own plot of land. He constructed the factory and submitted the application in the prescribed form along with that for required coconut oil in central rate to the Collector's office. From Konkan region, there was only this application for running the factory.\n\nIn reply to this, a message came from Shri. Baalaasaheb Kher's house asking Appaa to meet him immediately. He had to rush to Mumbai and return to Ratnagiri with immeasurable disappointment! Appaa came to know that the Ratnagiri Collector acted upon the confidential letter asking the Collector to send Baalaasaheb any application coming from a family name \"Kher\". This cautious step was taken to avoid the would be criticism that Mr. BG Kher is helping his relatives and caste fellows. Baalaasaheb informed Appaa that since the latter was his close relative, permission for his factory could not be given. Let him choose any other business for which Balasaheb may personally help Appaa to compensate the loss! He should take the application back from the Collectors office. Reproaching himself immensely for being from a close family i.e. \"Kher\", Appaasaheb cultivated interest in grafting and became the owner of \"Kherbaug\".\n\nCould we, you and me, ever appreciate these stories as stories of qualities? Are they befitting to be termed as qualities? Especially in these days when we know, exceptions apart, that power is used primarily as a tool of gain for self, relatives, caste fellows and friends!!\n\nKeeping aside all those unpleasant questions, I salute these hundreds of Karhaadaas like Mr. Taambe, late Baalaasaheb Kher's mother and late Shri. Appaasaheb Kher, who, being subjected to injustice by their own person in high position, uttered not a single word and thus showed immensely the illustrious Karhaadaa spirit to hold principles above each and everything, even personal gains, their rightful place for which they amply deserve fame, position and security!!\n\nEven so, Balasaheb was immensely criticised by those genotypes whose province of brain was cultivated in traditional wickedness. Never was there a word of appreciation (as he was a Karhaadaa), but their jacklish and wolfish mentality was abundantly seen when Shri. Kher was alive and even after his death!\n\nHaving heard these stories of Baalaasaheb Kher, I could sweep out my congested mind of opinions formed in my childhood about my mother, who used to distribute qualitywise and quantitywise more Alphonso mangoes or any special preparation to other four-five children of her brother-in-laws or sister-in-laws and was seen, everytime unmindful, as to what I would think, about this type of behaviour! In my childhood I used to be burning within myself, for that injustice - that too from my mother! Therefore, I salute you Mr. Baalaasaheb Kher; with immense respect at my command, for indirectly teaching me the gracious and true humane qualities of my ever illustrious mother!! The qualities of people like you are rarest to be perceived. These qualitative human beings would ever remain in my heart although they have withdrawn themselves from this land!!\n\n8. Respected Shri. Ganesh Vaasudev alias Daadaasaheb Maavalankar\n\nThis highly eminent personality, a renowned advocate of Ahmedabad, first Speaker of Bombay Legislative Assembly and then First Speaker of the Parliament (Loksabha) Shri. Ganesh Vaasudev alias Daadaasaheb Maavalankar is another great name from this community. The \"Maavalankar Hall\" in the Delhi Parliament building as well as the \"Best Parliamentarian Award\" is also named in memory of this glittering personality.\n\nWhen he was the speaker, eminent scholars, dedicated Nation builders and true social servants were the MPs. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister, who was enjoying his supremacy in Parliament. Once, for a very important consultation, Pandit Nehru felt the need of Shri. Maavalankar's presence. He wrote down, hurriedly, on a sheet of paper to Dadasaheb, requesting to see him in his office. It was like a most senior official calling a junior official in his office. Wrote back Dadasaheb on the same chit the following words:\n\n\"Propriety demands that the Prime Minister should see the speaker in his office for his work and not vice-versa\"\n\nA true Parliamentarian and follower of etiquettes, Pandit Nehru rushed to Daadaasaheb's cabin and with apologetic tone (as he was inch and inch a gentleman), discussed with him the pertinent issue.\n\nGone are the celebrities with everlasting impressions left on us. Let us be worthy of perceiving and if possible imbibe these qualities. Let the gem in us be ever shining!!\n\n9.\n\nComing from the noblest and most learned family, dedicated through generations for bringing in the suitable system in religous life, trying to see the enchanting confluence of spirituality and practicality, the greatest ever-shining name and still shining character in whom there was the essential quintessence of great seers, accumulated as it were, of this ancient nation; and who spent all his life only for this nation, was most revered and respectable, a precious gem of this nation and truely was the gem in the crown of Karhaadaa community. In the words of Smt. Vijaya Raje Scindia, he was a person born in a nation only once in a Hundred or Hundred and Fifty years! He got the highest position in his organisation at a very early age, and this was what was not digestible by agewise senior fellows in that organisation. With political activities within, they tried to treat him, at the beginning, as the officer treats his personal secretary. It is learnt that when he sensed the far-fetching dirty intention of such type of activity - he once told the meeting: 'Listening to every senior honourable member of the executive body with a sense of respect for their opinion is my duty; but as it should be, the decision will be mine. I am not sitting here to act only as per your wish, or as per your asking me to act, as I am not a mere tool or showpiece!'\n\nThose who are conversant with the socio-cultural activities and the politics of the same, will understand the illustrious personality immediately.\n\n10. Great historian Shri. Tryambak Shankar Shejwalkar\n\nAn eminent historian and with exceptional analytical ability, Shri. Tryambak Shankar Shejwalkar of Mumbai - Pune, was a revered and respectful name in the galaxy of historians known for their mind quality, free from conditioning and with superb objective and analytical ability. Riyasatkar Shri. Govind Sakharam Sardesai of Baroda, Maahaamahopaadhyay Dr. Waasudev Vishnu Mirashi of Naagpur, Maahaamahopaadhyay Shri. Datto Waaman Potdaar of Pune, Dr. Shriniwaas Hardikar of Kaanpur, Padmabhushan Dr. Vishnu Shreedhar alias Haribhaau Waakankar, the ever great Dr. Shankar Balkrishna Dixit, Shri. G. K. alias Aabaa Chaandorkar, Shri. Neelkantha Janardhan Keertane are the respectable real gems in Karhaadaa community who devoted their whole life to the study of History. They were great historians who never sided or pleaded for their caste fellows. Even when they found that a connivance of certian fellows is responsible for an oppressive attitude and action which caused tremendous loss and mental torture to their own caste fellows like Biniwaale, Gunye, Paadhye and many others, they did not mention it anywhere. That is the intrinsic real beauty of greatness! This is unlike Shri. Rajwade who wrote \"Govind Bundele, a Karhaadaa, is responsible for the Peshwa's defeat in Panipat\".\n\nRiyaasatkar Sardesai chose Shri. Tryambak Shankar Shejwalkar who was then merely 23 - 24 years of age, for writing the preface to his voluminous and legendary book \"Marathi Riyaasat\". With a sharp scholastic career, born with sharper intellectual abilities, quick perceptibility, possessing high quality self-esteem, fast evaluative ability and highly spirited personality Shri. T. S. Shejwalkar was leading a life of a luminous and frightening lion-like personality in the field of historical perspective in particular and that of socio-cultural in general. He never hesitated in casting criticism, even against Shri. G. S. Sardesai.\n\nHistorian Shri. Rajwade owing to his partial thinking about the Peshwas (of his own caste) and obvious biased views about Karhaadaas, held Govind Pant Bundele responsible for the historical defeat at Panipat. Describing the event, Rajwade did not forget to mention Bundele's sub-caste \"Karhaadaa\" by name. The typical, tactical and cultivated intentions were obvious. It was very much a non-factual and untruthful account of a historical fact, that too coming from a historian! It was a calculative allegation which had enough potential to destroy the valor of past and future Karhaadaa people. Fortunately, one lion among Karhaadaas was alive and not asleep. He took up the project of finding out the truth of the Panipat war and brought out a book called \"Panipat\". I really wonder why Mr. Rajwade, the historian who gave frank analysis about Veer Savarkar etc. became blind for Peshwaa! I think the strong feeling for traditional opponents, became prominent due to their luminous, intrinsic and true intellectual properties.\n\nWhatever was found and established by Shri. Shejwalkar after rigorous place visits and research would never have been difficult for Rajwade to assert. Perhaps, a sense of eliminating a fancied opponent was more prominent at that time than exposing the real person responsible for the defeat (as belonging to his own caste). Parhaps maybe, as per his own assertions in his writing about Brahmendraswaami, he was the victim of tradition i.e. of consious killing laid down by Swamiji, by following and due to which, Maharashtra is ruined.\n\nThese malicious chronic intentions and a constitution suffering from superiority complexes have long before really broken the natural communication among different communities, which for their today's fancied unity they want to bring together! Let all of them be worthy of that by cleansing their mindset first and possess the transparent intentions for bringing in a clean base of truthfulness with no complexes.\n\nAfter publication of that book, it is said, some followers of Rajwade published an article in a periodical trying to express as to how Rajwade was right (and of course, suggested Shejwalkar was wrong)! Someone approached Shejwalkar and requested him to reply to them. The lion's reply was both educative and entertaining. Said he, \"In wrestling, there is an unwritten rule for a wrestler. A wrestler, who wins the precious thick gold ring (for his wrist, called \"kada\") which is the reward for championship in wrestling, must not even think of wrestling again for a reward of an underwear also, which is meant for beginners and new recruits!\"\n\nDo I need to elaborate further? Could we imbibe these qualities? Could we cultivate ourselves continuosly for understanding the depth and width of these precious, intrinsic, qualities? Could we grab instantly their essence? Let us be awakened to know that we are the inheritors of these everlasting qualities within us. We love harmonious true life and our minds are clean and clear. We, both individually and collectively never surrender to the feelings of pulling others down, making opponents mentally inferior, cast our wrong doings on opponents and totally freeze them of their activities. If they are powerful and wealthy, we do not insert ill-intentioned people in them to collapse the empire. All these activities of those established intellectuals will never and never be ours and would never touch us even once in our lives!!\n\n11. Brahmarshee Shreepaad Daamodar Saatavalekar, Pardi, Gujarath\n\nThere was a meeting of selected Pune citizens in Pune to decide as to how Pandit Satavalekarji should be honoured on his completion of hundred years of age. In those days, the Rupee had a high value. These citizens started proposing a very small amount and increased it to eleven thousand. The presiding over personality was Padmabhushan Shri. Shantanurao Kirloskar. He quickly realised the situation and declared, \"It is decided to give him a purse of Rs. 1,11,111. Whatever you can collect, do it and tell me; the balance amount will be mine!\"\n\nWho was this great seer like personality? Honoured by more than two dozen Institutions, recepient of Meyo Medal twice, basically a Vaidic and sanskrit scholar, the best drawing teacher, learned by heart Patanjali's Mahabhashya on Sanskrit grammar in his childhood, also well versed in yoga and spirituality, who established an Art studio in Hydrabad and Lahore, was closely associated with Aarya Samaaj activities, Theosophical Society, Congress Party and RSS, who owing to love for drawing, painting etc. changed his residence from Hyderabad to Jaipur, to Haridwar, Lahore, Aundh, Pardi etc., who did not like the hidden and disruptive activities and got attracted to Gandhiji, wrote and published 404 books, lived a life of 103 years, published magazines in Marathi, Hindi. Gujarati, Sanskrit ... I fear, I cannot fully describe the quality of this great multifaceted eminent and scholastic personality. Pandit Shreepad Damodar Saatawalekar was the most revered personality known at that time throughout India.\n\nIn his childhood, he was impressed by qualitative personalities like Shri. Shivaji Maharaj, Smt. Taaraabai of Kolhapur, Lakshmibaai of Jhansi, Baalshastri Jambhekar, Tembye Swaami, his English Guru Shri. Luktuke, Pandit Mainkar, his illustrious parents and truely to say, his own relatives. His own younger brother got a Doctorate from USA and settled in Hyderabad where along with Shri. Naanaasaheb Hardikar he started the noted Educational Institute, \"Vivek Wardhini\". The whole family including his sons and grandsons is eminent and illustrious.\n\nShri. S. P. Gokhale from Karad edited his selected speeches etc. and tried to write his biography. Interested people could go through this book to study the selective mentality which tries to show \"though Pandit Saatavalekar was great, his community or family is not\". He quotes from 'Venisamhar' the verse of Karna twice \"sooto waa sootaputro waa ... daivaayattam kule janma, madaayattam tu paurusham\". As if not satisfied quoting it once, he quoted it a second time, as coming from one astrologer Mr. Kelkar after his study! Showing thereby that whatever he thinks, the same is thought by Shri. Kelkar also. It appears that he has not, possibly, consulted with any more such persons.\n\nWhen the cultivated analytical skill fails to find faults in such eminent persons of a different community, then other options seem to be used by these intelligent people. Either mention his caste openly in a disgusting manner, suggesting it as very low, or imply the caste in such a way that people should at very first sight neglect it. It appears that this was the most cherished and long-felt need of these people, of which the most visible propounder was Shri. Vishnushastri Chiplunkar. Interested people would like to read the preface on the collection of Sant Shri. Tukaaraam Mahaaraaj's Abhangs by Shri. P. M. Laad published by State Government of Maharashtra who quoted late Shri. Vishnushastri Chiplunkar. Shri. S. P. Gokhale above, has chosen the second option. There it was a direct hit on Saint Shri. Tukaaraam's caste and here the Samaajbhooshan Gokhale has implied it without wording it categorically, anyway the tradition is kept up!\n\nI must appreciate the Saatavalekar family, because they had given it unedited; had it been so edited by them, we would not have been introduced with this type of chronic mentality! On the same line, you will have to appreciate the Late Shri. Bhaaskar Raamachandra Taambe's family members. They also invited a person with a similar mentality to write a preface for the complete poetry collection of eminent poet Shri. Bhaaskar Raamachandra Taambe. In his preface, Shri. Jog says Taambe was \"lucky\" i.e. suggesting thereby that quality wise he was not that good. Further, he emphatically alleged that his poems have the influence of Shri. Ravindranath Tagore i.e. there is no originality. A classic example of the malady within is exhibited here. Prof. Maaydeo and Shri. Maadhavrao Patwardhan have shown in their writings long back, as to how Shri. Taambe's poems were published seventeen years before that of Tagore's! It could then also be possible for a professor of that type to say that the theory of 'Karmayog' in Bhagwad Geeta, is the direct effect of Lokamanya Tilak's theory in 'Geetaarahasya', no? The other \"factor of luck\" issue can always be sold on anybody's name. A principal, HOD, writer, poet, doctor, even Head Master of a school or a peon who has got something - fame or money or both is lucky enough. Prof. Jog was also lucky enough in adorning the post of HOD in Fergusson College. Interested people can please read the book where the above can be found in the preface.\n\nWriting of this type, however, speaks about the cultivated culture, which is a source of training as to how eminent people, found to be belonging to another caste of superior quality, should be maligned. How the rate and standard of writing this way is taken as a measure of weighing the personality in the public mind. When in Marathi literature, people like Achaarya P. K. Atre, Shri. H. R. Mahaajani and Shri. P. L. Deshpande appeared on the screen, writing of this type got a reply in their own language coupled with criticism and sarcasm. This mentality appears to be waning though not vanished completely. Let us realise that malice begets malice alone and it begets altogether different cultural standards!\n\n12. Meemansaa Gaurava - Pandit Dattaatreyashaastri Taambe\n\nThere was a unique event which I will describe here. A great Indologist and scholarly personality was presiding over a villager's meeting at Harchiri to decide whether one old pious preacher, a vaidic scholar named Shri. Devasthali has committed a sin or otherwise. Having seen that his neighbour's cow has eaten up all vegetables etc. in his garden, Devasthali had thrown a stone at the cow which took her life and the matter had gone to court. This was the cause of this villager's meet.\n\nPandit Taambe was only 23-24 years old and had come from Lahore to spend the summer vacation. The villager's meet selected him as the Presiding over person. With much hesitance, Pandit Tambe accepted the chair. He asked the persons concerned to tell him the truth.\n\nTwo elderly pleaders coming from Ratnagiri city took objection for this meeting, calling it a matter which was sub-judice. Pt. Taambe asked them what property residing upon the Cow is being considered by the court i.e. 'It's being substratum of God or being a beast'? The pleaders said, the court is concerned with its 'being a beast'. 'Then the matter is over' said Pt. Taambe. These villagers are considering the cow as an abode of Gods. The fields of operations and considerations are different; thus the matter is not subjudice. He further asked those two pleaders from Ratnagiri, that since that meeting was for the villagers and since they were outsiders and not invited, they had no right to participate or even sit in the meeting. They had to go out.\n\nThen the chair invited the owner of the cow and Shri. Devasthali and asked the owner as to what he had to say. After his allegatios, Pt. Taambe asked the owner \"whether Devasthali's intention was to kill the cow or to prevent her from causing further loss. Also, whether it was an accident in which the cow died, or a purposeful planned killing of the cow accomplished by this old person?\" The alleger was then convinced and told the villagers meet that it was merely an accident and Devasthali did not and would never intend to kill the cow.\n\nThen Pt. Taambe asked Devasthali to narrate the incident, in which it was revealed that, it was indeed an accident. His was a preventive action but it took the life of the cow for which Devasthali was repenting. Having been mesmerised, as it were, the owner came forward and told the meet, that being prompted by some ill-intentioned people, he had gone to the court. Now he would withdraw the case from the court. On this, Devasthali came forward and told the meet that he would compensate the owner with a cow immediately. The matter was over. The 65 years old Devasthali started paying Pt. Taambe his respects in prostrate condition, as quality sees no age. Pandit Taambe did not accept it saying, 'Sir, you are the most respected, pious, elderly and a great Vaidic scholar. I am a boy-like figure. Kindly give me your blessings only.'\n\nPandit Taambe was a Sanskrit Pandit who won championship in both wrestling and for erudition in Meemaansaa - winning the thick gold rings (Kada) for wrist of both hands! His date of birth was 6 August 1900.\n\nThere is a popular feeling among neo-learneds and fashion among those who gained quick popularity in blaming our golden traditions and calling people with discipline in oriental learning as \"Reactionary\" as if they alone are progressive and all other people are lagging far behind and taking the people to the primitive past. No doubt, it is helping to swell their ego and it is an added beauty of self-glorification. Even some Sanskrit Pandits called themselves \"Purogamee\" i.e. having (even continental) progressive outlook. This device is helpful to distance themselves from other real Sanskrit Pandits, who are real gems and feel shy in self-propagation. I would like to narrate an incidence in the life of Tambe Guruji.\n\nWhen Guruji had crossed his fifty eight years of age, an unmarried girl of about 24 years of age approached his destination. She was from a noted city of MP, a daughter of Shri. Tambe Guruji's close orthodox friend, driven out of her home by her parents; as she was pregnant, and the so called lover was not ready to marry her. On the father's advice she reached Tambe Guruji in Pune, by foot from Pune railway Station (a distance of about 7 Km).\n\nPandit Taambe took her to Pandharpur in an Institute where these types of girls are taken care of. The authority wanted her to tell the name of person responsible for this condition for the purpose of registration. She refused to divulge. Pandit Taambe intervened and came to know that unless she tells the name of the male, the entry is impossible. Pandit Taambe asked the official to write the name in the registry in the pertinent column as Shri. Dattatrey Krishna Shastri Taambe, his own name. A child got the name of its father for registration!\n\nIn my career of conscientiously accomplishing duties, I came across many hypocrites having occupied fame and positions in the society and who were conviniently blaming innocent people as non-progressive when they themselves were not such or even contrary, were top class reactionaries or having regressive thoughts, and still calling themselves progressive! I am yet to find a so called progressive who could be comparable with that of Pandit Dattaatrey Shastri Taambe Guruji, who risked his position at the grown up age in such a circumstance, that some influential people wanted Pandit Tambe to go out of Meemaansaa Vidyaalay; for their own propagated Pandit! He could however, remain there till his seventy years of age!\n\nI could state here, with pride and reverance for my Guru, eminent scholar in Meemansa, Poetics, Nyaaya system ... whose first discipile was Shri. Shreepaad Shaastri Kinjawadekar and the last one was myself, Awadhoot Hardikar. I sincerely owe my learning to him viz. poetics (I am first class Kaavyateerth), Shrauta Vidyaa, Navya Nyaaya system and above all, imperishable analytical capability coupled with the rare ability of highest humanitarian value based judging, which helped me face evils in practical life and led me to spirituality and Yogavidyaa!\n\n13. Paramahansa Naaraayanaswami Hardikar, Chandod, Dist. Baroda\n\nOn the bank of river Narmada, there is a beautiful village called Chandod in Baroda district. There lived a great saintly personality, spiritually elevated and Ayurvedia Doctor by Profession.\n\nThe King of Baroda Shri. Sayajirao Gaekwad, once asked his concerned ministry to find out the quarrel-free villages and the reason thereof. In due time, the report came, informing that the village Chandod and surrounding 8-10 villages are quarrel free. No complaints from these villages were received, for which the reason was the existance of a saintly person called Paramahansa Naaraayanswami Hardikar. People respected him with reverence parallel to God. He was not only an Ayurvedic Vaidya, but also a judge consulted for their quarells on any sort of judiciary matter. Therefore, not a single complaint had been received from these villages for the last several years.\n\nNow curious, King Shri. Sayajirao met him and humbly offered him a post of Raajavaidya, which he gratefully and humbly denied, as he did not want to leave his village. Even then King Shri. Sayajirao conferred on him the title of Raajavaidya (Royal Ayurvedic Physician) and felicitated him with honour and respect.\n\nOn his expiry, he was given a 'jalasamaadhi' as per his wishes.\n\n14. Late Shri. V. M. Pant Paraadkar\n\nThis was a fairy tale like incident witnessed by me at Baalamukund Sanskrit college, Pune in 1960. It was a gathering of all existing Jagannaath Shankar Sheth scholars. Each one of them was given 5 to 7 minutes to narrate his memory of winning the scholarship. A Mahaamahopaadhyaay was presiding over the function. He was a Sanskrit Pandit and for many years a paper setter and chief examiner in Sanskrit for the SSC examination. The then matriculation examination used to be conducted by Bombay University.\n\nSoon, the name of Shri. V. M. Pant, a senior Sanskrit teacher in one of Pune's High Schools was declared. He started his narration. 'I got my matriculation from Sangli and I am the disciple of eminent Teacher Shri. Deexit, known for creating a line of Jagannaath Shankar Sheth Scholarship Holders. I got the second Jagannaath Shankar Sheth Scholarship because of today's President of this meeting who wanted his relative to get the first rank. Now I would like to narrate the incidence.'\n\nThe meeting was stirred. The President asked Shri. V. M. Pant to sit down. Shri. Pant refused it and thundered at the dias 'I have been given 5 to 7 minutes for my speech. I will finish my speech during that time. You cannot ask a person to sit down for your convenience. You have to listen to me!'\n\nSeeing him roaring like a lion, the rostrum permitted him to continue. Shri. V. M. Pant narrated: 'My teacher disbelieved that I am placed second. He took me to the Bombay University Registrar who had regards and respects for my Guru and he showed us the examination paper. The present president happened to be the chief examiner at that time. The present president given a boy from Pune (later on identified as his relative) a couple of marks more and placed him as the first J. S. Scholarship recipient and me as second. Thank you Mr. Presient, that you placed me second and not failed me in that paper. Shri. Deexit Sir was happy to know that the paper was written according to whatever I told him after the exam. He felt however, sorry for me, that a deserved candidate is axed in this way for preserving interests of a relative - caste fellow.'\n\nThe President in his speech found fault with Shri. V. M. Pant saying, 'He is referring to the past, about which the chairperson, now, does not remember anything.' The injustice monger need not, but a sufferer would surely remember the cause of suffering. A habitual injustice monger could conveniently forget it! What else could he say? What impressions do these type of people leave on public mind?\n\nI learnt from Mr. Pant the spirit of bravery and indomitable psyche. I learnt the true meaning of a respectable personality who are without cultivation of contentious feelings, because of cultivated humanitarian values imbibed in their homes from childhood, having learnedness without wickedness and the spirit required to stand firm in this world, full of venemous snakes under the garb of well-dressed, learned and media famous personalities. There is no need of getting a feeling of awe or even intimidation by sheer presence of such peple. It was also later on, learnt as to how an ill-doer is always a coward and prefers to pretend as a gentleman. The tradition of the great family of Moropant Paradkar was thus kept luminously intact by his progeny like Shri. V. M. Pant, Dr. M. D. Paradkar and others.\n\n15. The erudite Smt. Durgaa Bhaagwat\n\nSmt. Durga Bhagwat was born on 10 February 1910. She was selected the President of World Conference on oriental studies at Heidelberg, Germany in 1988. She was an active worker of Asiatic Society and editor of Sahitya Sahakar, a magazine; in addition to dozens of honorary posts and honours.\n\nHere was an impressive confluence of indomitable, non-appaling, natural Brahmanic spirit coupled with inherent scholastic career. She was most respected for these qualities and regarded as the real Durgaa incarnate!\n\nIn her address of annual Marathi Literary gathering at Karad from the respected seat of an elected chairperson, these qualities were vividly perceived by many. Those were the days of National emergency and late Shri. Yashwantrao Chavan, MP and a cabinet rank Minister in Smt. Indira Gandhi's government was sitting in the first row. Many Senior rank Government officials including CID staff were also present. Many famous and learned personalities - some of them sciolists who had already become noted for their advocacy by openly praising Smt. Indira Gandhi and as usual, while in company of their own people and being unscrupulous, criticising her in private. It was a standard fashion in those days, as if, to show their so-called intelligence! Introducing their cowardice and full-scale hypocracy within! Many noted people at several levels, appeared to have developed this skill in public life, in enacting different and convenient roles at different times - if, in doing so, they benefitted.\n\nBeing a Central Government officer working in Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, I experienced these people from a very close distance. A strange behaviour I could vividly remember is, the event of the death of Dr. S. Radhakrishnan. The famous intelligentsia had boycotted AIR and Government programmes openly and therefore did not spare even a word of tribute on the sad demise of Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, the erudite ex-president of India. At the same time, the intellectuals among these used to keep with us a contact in secrecy with a request to take up their book for review in AIR monthly literary magazine programme! That was a first rate hypocracy! Interested people could read the book in Marathi by Shri. Vijay Bedekar titled \"Shodh Andhah Shraddhechaa\" wherein he has taken a picturesque view of this type of hypocrite culture. For getting ourselves conversant with this double-standard culture, please read the book \"Kaalavidhaana Shastra\" on Astrology by Shri. Shreekrishna Bhat, where he has shown as to how Prof. P. G. Sahasrabuddhe, who was harsh enough to criticise astrology on public rostrums, was secretly consulting astrologers!\n\nI recount this to inform my readers the background and the whole cultural atmosphere. Deep rooted in this culture is a perpetual concern for any peace-lover, full of humanitarian values, who is straight forward, having true love for learning and possessing cultural standards and high degree of natural human qualities. Without knowing these, one will not be able to appreciate the fiery thoughts of Smt. Durga Bhaagwat.\n\nIn her speech, the very ideation and philosophy of imposing emergency was the important subject of criticism. She lashed out in the speech at many people who in private say that they value the importance of Independance. 'In fact they are hypocrites!' thundered she. The media dared not publish her speech.\n\nWhen the emergency was over, this incidence was described by Shri. P. L. Deshpande in the following words \"In that gathering, there was only one Male (\"Purush\" his exact word in Marathi) among us, named Durgaa Bhaagwat, dressed in clothes for women\"\n\nAs Shri. Harshad Sarpotdar remembers, Durgaa Bhaagwat was also the First to refuse to get adorned with the Jnanapeeth Award and First in returning to the Honourable President of India the \"Padmashree\" during the Emergency period. People whose memory is strong must be remembering her article addressing Shri. P. L. Deshpande as \"Padmashree Shreeyuta P. L. Deshpande\" and those conversant with the background would enjoy it!\n\nThere is no need to comment further! The ruthless power dared not arrest her as the power more crude and heartless dared not arrest the erudite Baabaabhatta Paadhye, codifier of the Dharmasindhu! The truth is the greatest power!\n\nLet us follow these foot prints only! These luminous, vibrant and naturally humanitarian personalities are the most revered personalities for us!\n\nBelow are abridged details of 7 select personalities from the Chapter \"The Karhaadaas, Firsts in many fields of human activities\"\n\n16. Shri. Balshastri Jambhekar\n\nThe ever great person from whom only the rennaissance of modern Maharashtra commenced, is late Shri. Balshastri Jambhekar. This could be stated very safely from his view points, vigorous and intellectual activities in the socio-cultural-religious fields, which were planned, guided and actively participated by this greatest ever son of the soil. Many impartial thinkers and persons free from the clutches of any sort of complexes like late Shri. Mahadeo Govind Ranade, Shri. Y. D. Phadke, have amply eulogised late Shri. Balshastri Jambhekar's contributions in several fields of human activities. Shri. Y. D. Phadke lamented that Shri. Balshastri Jambhekar's contributions in several fields was not remembered, later on debated and denied even. But it is Mr. Y. D. Phadke, who called him \"Navavicharanche Janak; yanchya pasoon navavichaar suru hotaat\" to say \"He was the father of new thought in Maharashtra and from him alone new thought commenced\"!\n\nHe was a very eminent thinker, educationist, was master of several languages and even was the most respected and treated as Guru by the grand father of this nation - late Shri. Dadabhai Navaroji, Shri. Kesanana Chhatre, Bhau Daji, Mandlik and Kashinath Shastri Telang among others, who were his students. Either suffering from the jaundice of caste, position, ego-gained superiority complexes or due to overpowering wickedness for more qualitative people which has become an inseparable quality as it were, it is not possible for us to remember the contribution and the intrinsic qualities of these type of persons. We are skillful in praising others provided if there is some benefit in sight, but we are very much lacking in appreciating the quality. Even in an advertisement of a 24 hours Marathi News Channel currently shown, although Lokmanya Tilak was born three decades after the birth of Darpan (and five decades after Balshastri), he is shown first and Balshastri Jambhekar is purposefully shown second from Tilak. Implying that Lokmanya Tilak was the first, thereby breaking all the norms of chronological principles. Why?\n\nTo sum-up one could state that in this imperfect world and full of relativity, Balshastri Jambhekar attained the pinnacle of perfection in many fields. Had there not been one Mr. Gangadhar Jambhekar, an educationist thinker and a true family lover, who brought out Late Balshastri's biography in three volumes, the robbers possessing hyena-mentality in their thorny forest of culture would have by now, established someone from their own community as the first marathi journalist like they did in other several fields of human activities. Interested bretheren may please read the biography, not for entertainment but to learn as to how the enriched potential of unkind and wicked mentality works for their gains; without bothering for any norm of human-society including truth! It is really becoming to their boastful, but known culture!\n\nThe great contribution for which Indian Astrology owes a lot to late Balshastri Jambhekar is his replacement of original Greek mythological names given to arbitrary configurations of stars (constellations. In his days the number was 88, now it is established as 110) useful for star gazing/mapping etc. No reference of these is stressed in Vaidik literature. It is the intuitive intelligence of erudite Jambhekar to study them deeply and thoroughly and had given them new terminology that suits Indian mythology rather than Greek mythology. The constellation (Nakshatram) is an arbitrary configuration of stars. These stars have been given names suitable to Indian thought. For example, the Punarvasu constellation has four stars, out of which two stars named from Greek mythology were Craster and Polax. Pandit Balashastri named them as \"KASHA\" and \"PLAXA\". Likewise, he had given an Indianised names to these stars. He was in this, the First great Indian scholar having vision and originality and not a mere follower or copier.\n\n17. Shri. Vishnoo Sakharam Khandekar\n\nHe was the First Jnanapeeth Award winning Maharashtrian for Marathi literary excellence, perceived by noble hearted impartial committee members for the same, selecting his novel \"YAYAATI\" as a peak of his literary creations. Yes, we have to give credit to the selection committee members who must have defeated all the opponents creating obstacles in declaring his name. I do vividly remember Acharya Atre, when interviewed as to how he got the first award for his Marathi movie \"Shamchi Aai\" in 1952, he told the interviewer \"because on the committee, there might have been no one from Maharashtra to oppose it\". A very much pious, noble, straightforward, super sensitive and majestic ever great connoisseur Padmabhooshan Shri. V. S. Khandekar was a model literary figure for many up and coming future generation people! Many South Indians in my knowledge, have named their children as \"Khandekar\" as the boys first name, a tribute to this great respectful personality!! The Government of India had issued a postal stamp on his great son!\n\nHe was also the First short essay writer of Marathi literature (=Laghunibandhakaara) according to the critic of Marathi literature Prof. Anand Yadav, an impartial and true critic who had exposed some established sciolists and writers on the basis of logical inferences based on facts. He had shown in his article in daily \"Sakal\" dated 25-1-1997 as to how taking the name of Professor N. S. Phadke as the first Marathi short essay writer is wrong.\n\nThe writing of V. S. Khandekar had enlivened the spirit and strong will of many towards life, as to how to look at it without surrendering the transitory feelings and at the same time imbibing within us the value of true humane emotions. To lead life not with frustration but with grace and imperial charm. Such people adorn prestigous Awards rather than the Award adorning them!\n\n18. Shri. Govindrao Tembye\n\nEvergreat musicologist, not only maestro but very prominent and widely appreciated composer of Marathi stage songs, a great disciplined music conductor, top-class guide and a lovable authority on the subject of music in particular and Art in general. In the dignified way he was the most gracious \"mae-sto-so\"! A majestic personality wherein, there was a superb and well designed confluence of erudition, artistic presentation and impressive beautiful personality. The name of this wizard of harmonium was Shri. Govindrao Tembye!\n\nHe was the First Marathi hero of the First marathi movie \"Ayodhyecha Rajaa\". He was primarily responsible for giving musical compositions for Marathi stage songs with greater variety of moods and a top class visionary who being a top-class connoisseur know the chemistry of presentation, blending well in selecting the proper raaga which appropriately suited the quintessential meaning of the song. Both Pt. Bhaskarbuva Bakhle and Pt. Govindrao Tembye were the greatest ever seers in this particular aspect of musicology! They were great friends and their accomplishments were complementary to one another as was the case with Vasant Kanetkar and Prabhakar Panshikar or Baba Bhatta Padhye and Moropant Paradkar.\n\nShri. Tembye was chosen the President of the precious gathering of marathi play lovers in Pune; was ever in-demand writer like Shri. Ramakrishna Bakre on plays, Dramas, biographical sketches, music and all aspects of music etc. He had also written musical operas like Jayadeva, Mahashveta, Pratima etc. He was the First in writing the songs in Marathi giving the characteristics of different raagas which is called \"Lakshanageeta\" or scientific information about the raaga of Hindustani music. Even in this all things were interwoven like - musical definition of raaga, characteristics of the same, feelings of the song corresponding to the mood of the raaga with time theory in mind ... one has to meditate upon even to think about all these!\n\nSuch a qualitative, ever great personality is born once in a hundred or two hundred years. Let us be worthy in perceiving these celestial qualities.\n\n19. Brahmeebhoota Shri. Ganesh Wasudev Tembye Swamiji alias - Shri. WasudevanandSaraswati\n\nThe First spiritually elevated personality with topmost practical knowledge of Paatanjali yogavidyaa which he earned out of his own efforts by strictly following the rules laid down in Indological occult sciences. As such, he was an enchanting confluence of spirituality (=Adhyaatma) and yogic expertise. He was the great Yogi. Not even an iota of thought was there to commercialise his expertise and make self the Maharaj etc. People rushed to him wherever he went for their solace of which marketing was not allowed by him. Instead, disciples like Yogi Shri. Wamanraoji Gulawani Maharaj of Pune, walked in search of him for more than 1400 Km and then alone could see him. It was Shri. Wamanraoji whose efforts are mainly responsible to bring into light more than 25 books, telling about his devotion, hymns, Sanskrit/Marathi compositions and his own thoughts on Spirituality and Yogavidyaa.\n\nKarhaadaas are known from the very historical period for incessantly endeavouring people for spiritual realisation, gaining expertise in Yogic processes without bothering for outside world. Only one Tembye family has begotten twelve such elevated souls. Among them Shri. Wasudevanandaji from Mangaon, Shri. Shivaanandaji from Pangre, Shri. Seetaram Maharaj Tembye from Kharaghat, Shri. Prabhakar Maharaj Tembye from Solapur are well-known in the respective areas.\n\nI could say here with confidence, that the only spiritually elevated personality whose experiements they have either told to their disciples like Shri. Wamanraoji Gulwani Maharaj or advised through their writing have been universally experienced by hundreds and thousands of persons, was Shri. Tembye Swamiji. His advise was used on self experience, tested time and again and delightfully came as cent per cent true! It was not the knowledge already booked in Yogic upanishads and displayed by him, but it was of his own!\n\n20. Shri. Prabhakar Panshikar; Mumbai; Born: 14-3-1931\n\nAn Actor, Producer, Director, a quick-character actor, owner of a company staging plays, original thinker about stage and its progressive place in the contemporary artistic presentation, setting new trends and styles on Marathi stage, making several records, representing a family having spent several generations in Indological research and erudition in several branches, and the rarest among rarest personality who was recepient of the First Award constituted by Maharashtra Government on his name itself! The rarest honour one could receive during his lifetime for one's contribution to his chosen field. He is in reality, a himalayan figure for Marathi stage, next only to Shri. Annasaheb Kirloskar. He was selected twice as Presient of Marathi Natya Sammelan. Several honours came to him for adorning themselves. A national award winner of Sangeet Natak Academi, Vishnudas Bhave Gold Medal winner, felicitation with conferring him the title \"Maharashtra Gaurav\" (The great person who is the glory of Maharashtra); recepient of Dinanath Mangeshkar Award, President of Maharashtra Censor board, Chaturang Jeevan Gaurav Puraskar etc.\n\nOne has to remember forever the contributions of three great seers of Marathi stage: Late Shri. Annasaheb Kirloskar, Shri. Bhalchandra Bapusaheb Pendharkar and Shri. Prabhakar Panshikar as stage Institute owners. Also remember Shri. Bhaskarbuva Bakhle, Shri. Govindrao Tembye, Shri. V. S. Gurjar, Prof. Vasant Kanetkar, Shri. Sha. Na. Navare, Shri. Jitendra Abhisheki, Shri. Daji Bhatawadekar, Smt. Smita Talwalkar, Shri. Sharad Talwalkar etc.\n\n21. Eminent Scholar Pandit Raghunathbhatta Ganeshbhatta Nawathey\n\nContemporary and close friend of Sant Shri. Ramdas sheltered in his later age by Queen Smt. Deepabai, wife of King Shri. Ekoji Bhosale of Tanjore, Pandit Nawathey was a very eminent and dynamic Vaidik and Sanskrit scholar. He was the First great Vaidik scholar, who since knowing the complicated methods of ritualistics, had created, composed and disciplined these methods in a system called \"PRAYOGA\". This is a variety of Hindu ritualistic rites which are handed down for generations and on which the priesthood is today living by following word to word those rites which are called \"YAJNIKI\". All these have been composed by this great Southernised Maharashtrian Karhaadaa scholar. The First scholar who accomplishes the ritualistics needs to do so in a strict disciplined way for the benefits of those following strict Vaidik way of daily life! The present day Prayogas in which the priests are supposedly experts like \"Upanayana Prayoga\", \"Vivaha Prayoga\" etc. are composed by him only. His father was Ganeshbhatta, Grandfather was Raghunathbhatta and Great Grandfather was Hariharbhatta. The whole family appears to be eminent scholars of Vaidik literature and Sanskrit shastras. His Guru's name was Pandit Anand Deo. I surmise that this Nawathey family must be originally belonging to the village Bhoo, Taluka Rajapur, District Ratnagiri. There were many Nawathey's in that area since historical period (including Cine Director Shri. Raja Nawathey).\n\nPandit Raghunathbhatta Sanskritised his family name Nawathey as \"Navahastha\" means Nawathey only. Dr. P. V. Kane, in his book \"History of Dharmashastra\" Volume I, Part II page 1208 agrees to this assertion. Not only Vaidik ritualistic compositions but some other books were written by him - some of them are \"Prayogaratnamanjoosha\", \"Sahityakutoohalam\", \"Dharmamitramahodadhi\", \"Janaardanamahodadhi\", \"Kashimeemansa\", \"Bhojanakutoohalam\", \"Praayashchittakutoohalam\" etc. It is learnt that he had also written a book in Marathi \"Narakavarnanam\".\n\nWe begin our auspicious rituals with \"Punyaahawachanam\". It is composed by this scholar. Pandit Raghunathbhatta Nawathey or Navahasta where \"Nava\" means Nine and \"Hasta\" means Hand i.e. 'one whose contribution is nine times greater than an average human being'. This is what he must have been wanting to imply. His mild aggressive authority could be perceived through his writing and therefore he might have been neglected later and usual jealousy for qualitative people might have kept him without any mention even, for which we are known for a long time!\n\n22. Vedasamraat Sakharambhatta Maheshvarabhatta Padhye\n\nIn recent history, i.e. about 60 years before, a great scholar was examined by several Vaidik scholars in Benaras (Kashi). All ten books pertaining to Rigveda were there as subject of his oral exam; and this event was attended by even the King of Kashi. A young lad Pandit Sakhaaramabhatta Padhye stood First and it was a ceremonious feliciation arranged for this Vaidik scholar. After riding him on an elephant procession on the roads of Kashi, the meeting of Vaidik Sanskrit Scholars conferred on him the title \"VEDASAMRAT\" i.e. \"The King of Kings among Vaidik scholars\". He was the First to have received felicitation and a title like that, with an yearly reward of Rs. 1,200 from the King of Kashi which he used to enjoy till recently. He crossed his ninety years of age and is still observing his orthodox ways of living.\n\nStill greater and the greatest!\n\nThere are hundreds of stories proving the time tested eminence of Karhaadaa personalities! They are really distinctive in their genotypic and phenotypic constitution and have proved from historical period to be a remarkable, glittering, gracious, magnanimous and as ever illustrious community!\n\nMainly residing in Maharashtra, spread in historical period throughout India and now even globally, they are even now not lacking in these genetically supreme humanitarian qualities. This community does not believe in that contentious basis, typical personality for cultivation of expertise for practical gains, which gives a sudden rise to a person as a cherished value! They do not hold the view that superficial show of learning i.e. sciolism would enable one or the community of such people to be known as the real learned one and scholarly. The so-called learning and such imposed scholarship is exposed several times when tested with reality. It is possible to gain name only in a hypocrite atmosphere where ignorance reigns, where most of the arrogant, weak sentimentality, disrespecting dignity is prevalent enough as the characteristics of supposedly culturally advanced people! Treating others as inferior or ordinary to such swollen intelligence people, by constantly applying devices of propagation with the help of media, is proven to bring bad name to that community people. The Karhaadaas are the community which regards principles above gainfully chosen convenience. The centuries old, time-tested, cultivated humanitarian qualities alone make them really acceptable and respectable by a majority of the people among society!\n\nKarhaadaas are not known for the perverse mentality coupled with high rate hypocrisy such as asking people not to send their children to English Medium School and sending his own children to the same school. Or asking people to not seek Government jobs, to leave Government jobs if possible while parallely trying to get the same jobs for their own children or relatives! While asking others not to go to foreign countries and privately arranging for his sons/daughters/relatives for lucrative jobs in foreign countries! Possessing double standards has become an inseparable quality and a sure sign of success of so-called intellectuals which begets only hypocrite culture!\n\nA microscopic small community, compared to other large communities has a comparitively major and effective contribution and naturally they are ahead in the race in many human activities, which causes others to feel jealous and critical. They are maligned, avoidance of qualitative Karhaadaa names even has been high, not mentioning even their names and when it is unavoidable, intentionally publishing their spellings in such a way that it should not appear as a Karhaadaa name. The hundreds of such devices born out of cultivated mentality are frankly speaking, a subject matter of research.\n\nI admire these people for their 'vratam' as it were! Generations after generations have preserved this mentality which just cannot leave even those very few of them who are supposedly following the path of spirituality! I must appreciate that Karhaadaas have not been bereft of their qualities. Despite the venemous acts of their opponents, they remain silent and serene! While experiencing many communities or people continuosly improving from within and imbibing selfless and spiritual values for their contentment and wiping out the minus qualities; I also come across some people who may be fair and appear gentlemanly, but are preserving those disgusting qualities generations after generations. Either those qualities are stuck to them so fast, that even when they are supposedly following the path of spirituality those qualities have not parted from them; or they themselves have become so friendly with those qualities! At the same time, even Karhaadaas have not been able to get rid of the quality of being tolerant or unmindful on the front of practicality; as they believe people on a large scale in general, have tremendous capabilities to understand what is good and bad. They ultimately would follow the good, realising as to who were responsible for taking them away from the path of truth. At this time, even the media propaganda will become non-functionary.\n\nOnly a few persons more, I would like to include in this list as I must preserve the principles of limit intact.\n\n23. Pandit Bhaaskarbua Bakhale; Baroda, Mumbai, Pune\n\nHe is described as a Sun on Earth whose glitter would enlighten the generations to come. The real contribution of any such precious diamond like person is measured by his contribution in the field which he had chosen for himself. A line of ever shining moons who are the respected disciples of Shri. Bakhale and his contribution in the field of Marathi natya sangeet (Stage songs) has ensured that his name cannot be marred out as easily as the name of Kirloskar, which was later rubbed out from the original name of the Institute established by Bhaskarbuwa himself. The name of the Institute was \"Kisloskar Bhaarat Gaayan Samaaj\", which now remains as \"Bhaarat Gaayan Samaaj\" only. Music is such an art that takes one to the level of bliss; and it is not the four walled building for preserving the imagined egos with the help of media. Critics who are free from conditionalities like Shri. P. L. Deshpaande (Kindly read the book \"Maitra\" by this great connoisseur and non-Karhaadaa in which he has rightly compared Pt. Bakhale with his contemporary), Shri. Waamanrao Deshpaande, whole heartedly appreciate the contribution of Pt. Bhaaskarbuwa Bakhale. Here, people used to experience the enchanting confluence of Jaipur, Agra and Gwalior Gharanaas. He was the embodiment of Gandharva, a celestial heavenly personality on Earth! His presentations were divine!\n\nThe First musicologist who realised the importance of music which provides primarily entertainment and further is the cause of containtment and there, it should be attractive in its tonal culture or tonality! He is the First to introduce the beauty of music to the masses. He brought the musical beauty from palaces and closed rooms to public platform like Marathi stage. In Maharashtra, the \"stage song\" has become the distinctive semi-classical or light music variety for which the credit goes to this greatest visionary, who popularised music among common man and trained their ears for the same through Marathi stage for drama. For this the credit goes as per the impartial music lovers are convinced, mainly to the incessant efforts of this great Pandit Bhaskarbuva Bakhle and a line of his disciples like Kesubai Kerkar, Bal Gandharva, Madam Shirodkar, Master Krishnarao, Bapusaheb Ketkar and so many other great artists. It was said in Northern India that in the world of music, there was only one Bhaskar (The Sun). This high appreciation befittingly denotes his place in the field of music.\n\nInterested people may like to read the article of eminent critic of musicians and music, Shri. P. L. Deshpande who compared Bhaskarbuva Bakhle's place with other known contemporary musicologists in Maharashtra with highly spirited and profound appreciation for Pandit Bhaskarbuva Bakhle. Bhaskarbuva was known among deconditioned and real music lovers as a divine or celestial singer, the \"DEVAGANDHARVA\". These are people with free and frank heart who after realising that it is never possible to see such a great artist on this earth, he is described as Godly person and his art is heavenly i.e. celestial! Panditji, on this thorny land full of chronic jealousy and cultivated wickedness for qualitative people, there are some oases, like Shri. P. L. Deshpande, Shri. Wamanrao Deshpande etc. who even after many years of your departure, heartily remember your unforgettable and unparallel qualities.\n\n24. Shri. Manukaakaa Pandit; Ratnagiri, USA\n\nA very senior World Bank officer Shri. Manukaka Pandit who is described as the Karna (known for his generosity in Mythology) of this era, who helped hundreds of people, donated his property in the US to that Government and the Indian property of his ancestors to the local villagers. Still many many are living due to his help and no word of appreciation you would ever hear from them.\n\n25. Late Shri. V. G. Kaanetkar; Pune\n\nEx Director General of Police and a scholar, lived a life full of rich experiences. He was specially appointed to eliminate robbery and was a terror of the wicked, friend of virtuous people. He belonged to an era of spirited servicemen with vouched loyalty to the Government and held a spotless, illustrious service record.\n\n26. Late Shri. SeetaaramPant Kher; Allahabad\n\nEx-Speaker of UP assembly who had shown exemplary courage in taking stern actions at times against the misbehaviour of members.\n\n27. Justice Shri. Sarvatye; MP\n\nWe should always remember the illustrious service to the judiciary of Justice Shri. Sarvatye of MP High Court, also those of Justice Taambe, Justice Deo, Justice Golwalkar, Justice Hardikar to the present day Supreme Court Judge, Justice Prakaash Naavelkar and many others.\n\n28. Shri. Wakhle, Saaagar\n\nIn music, Karhaadaas are known for even establishing their own styled Gharaanaas. Shri. Waakhle from Saagar, Bakhale from Pune, Shri. Kashaalkar from Yavatmal, Pt. Jitendra Abhisheki from Goa, Shri. Shankarrao Kulkarni from Kasheli, Shri. Suresh Talwalkar from Mumbai, Govindrao Tembye from Kolhapur, Shankarrao Sapre from Nagpur and many many others.\n\nThe number of qualitative Karhaadaas is percentage wise and also quality wise more as a result of which they have marked their names in many fields of human activities.\n\nAfter delineating the qualities based on facts of eminent Karhaadaas, a thought came to my mind that some people may take it as a comment on a particular community. I am not here to criticise any particular community, as such, nowhere is this the intention.\n\nI believe that a personal quality or disquality cannot be ascribed to that of the constantly changing community as such. Furthermore, I have full regards and respects for the qualitative people of any community. Many of my friends, well-wishers, students and relatives, including my wife come from a non-Karhaadaa community and frankly speaking, I do appreciate their qualities which I cherish whole-heartedly.\n\nI hope, this writing, which is not an eulogy but a factual presentation would enable us all to introspect and eschew the mischief mongers from their activities. We believe that a real qualitative person is the property of all people who take him as an ideal for their life. In that case, the question of whether he belongs to a Karhaadaa, Deshastha, Saraswat, Madhyandin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Chitpavan etc. does not arise in a cultured mind.\n\nFriends, wise people are aware that the real beauty of a person proportionately depends upon the standard of cultivation of his innate (mind setup)! Mere sum total of bodily attraction is only results in infatuating the beholders mind. Unless the innate is cultivated right from ones childhood, real value of personality can never be properly perceived. When your innate is richer than any person surrounding you, you need not bother about the external mostly corrupt, borrowed and mainly imitated factors of beauty.\n\nI have observed for years that many Karhaadaa homes are busy in cultivating this innate right from their childhood. Some other communities have also understood this essential practice. A person possessing such a cultured mind is infinitely more acceptable than others possessing a deceptive and deceitful personality.\n\nThis is the factual reason as to why this microscopic community has made a glittering contribution, stimulating a perpetual jealousy among many and stirring wickedness time and again in those minds who think of them the real competitors in public life. And therefore they endeavor to eliminate them right from childhood - by adopting various devices and measures.\n\nLet us ponder over this and keep ourselves on the line of our eminent and ever worthy predecessors!\n\n... This article is to be continued as more information about Karhaadaas is added. So keep checking!\n\nRequest to all Karhade people\n\nBy Awadhoot R. Hardikar\n\n14 September 2007\n\nEmail: contact@thekarhaadaa.org"
