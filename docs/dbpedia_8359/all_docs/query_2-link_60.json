        "text": "Parbati had Bumper Crops even in Scarcity.\n\nThere lived a pious farmer, named Parbati, in Ganagapur. He used to bow to Shri Guru when he went to Sangam in the morning an again at midday when Shri Guru returned. His field was on the way to the Sangam. Once Shri Guru asked him, \"Why do you take this trouble daily? What is your desire?\"\n\nParbati said, \"I wish that my field yields a good crop\".\n\nShri Guru, \"what have you sown?\"\n\nParbati said that jawar was sown in his field. He further added, \"It is due to your favour that this year the corp is good. I wish that you should kindly come to my field and have a look at the crop by your sight which showers nectar.'\n\nShri Guru went to the field, looked at the crop and said, 'If you have faith in me, do as I bid you.'\n\nParbati said, 'I shall obey you from the bottom of my heart'.\n\nShri Guru - 'Till I return at midday, cut off this crop'. Saying so, Shri Guru went to the Sangam.\n\nParbati approached the Revenue Officer and asked him to permit him to reap the crop on the rent as per the previous year.\n\nThe Officer said, `This year the crop is good, hence the old rent will not suffice'.\n\nParbati said, `I shall pay double the rent. So please give me permission'. The Officer agreed and granted the permission.\n\nParbati took some men with him, went to the field and reaped the crop. His wife and children tried to prohibit him; but he did not listen to them. The wife complained to the Officer, `The crop is good this year; but before the harvest, my husband is reaping the field on the advice of a Sanyasi and is depriving us of food. Kindly prohibit him to cut the crop'.\n\nThe Officer sent his men to ask Parbati why he was reaping the field before the harvest. Parbati said, `If the Officer has doubt of getting the rent; I shall pay the corn from reserve and keep my cattle at his door'.\n\nParbati reaped all the crop. Seeing that Shri Guru was returning from the Sangam, he bowed to Him and reported that he had cut the crop as instructed.\n\nShri Guru `You have reaped in vain!'\n\nParbati `I have read the crop as advised by you. I have full faith in you.'\n\nShri Guru `You will have the fruit of your devotion, the wife and children of Parbati said that they have lost their food.Parbati consoled them by saving ,`Shri Guru is Shri Shiva incarnate.With his blessing,We shall have no loss.He told us to do this due to some unforeseen reason.'\n\nIn about a week, there was a severe code and all the crops in the country were lost. Then on Mul Nakshatra, there was heavy rain, which was also harmful to the crops; but Parbati's field yielded hundred times more crop of good quality. All wondered to see this.\n\nThe wife and children of Parbati also rejoiced. They begged apology of Parbati and repented for underestimating Shri Guru. The mention of all the above facts is made here in order to show the affinity of Shri Sai Baba to Shri Vitthal of Pandharpur. One Sai Mandir at Phanaswadi, in the Girgaum area of the Bombay city, was formerly a temple of Vitthal and it was known as \"Shri Premal Vitthal Mandir\". In this temple the idols of Vitthal and Rakhumai were installed by Shri Gajanan Vinayak Pradhan, as the temple itself was constructed my him as his own private property. However, Shri Vasantshastri alias Aba Panshikar completely changed the Mandir and gave it the present form. One Shri Prabhakar Panshikar, is a famous actor on the Marathi stage and Shri Aba Panshikar is his brother. Shri Aba Panshikar was performing Keertans in the Vitthal mandir regularly. Shri Bhole Guruji, who is a Sai devotee, used to attend Shri Panshikar's keertans as he was staying very near the above mandir, in the Mugbhat a rea Girgaum. Shri Bhole Gurugi requested Shri Panshikar to start praying to Shri Sai Baba. Shri Panshikar was not aware of greatness of the saint of Shirdi upto that time and on being initiated by Shri Bhole Guruji, he gladly became a devotee of Shri Sai Baba. He very soon became a staunch and sincere devotee of Sri Baba and very soon thought of changing the vitthal mandir into a Sai temple. It is because of the zeal and efforts of Shri Aba Panshikar that the Premal Vitthal mandir is now converted into a Sai mandir and is now known by that name.\n\nIn this temple, we see the idol of Shri Sai Baba in plaster, which is about four and a half feet high. This idol is seated on an altar. It will be seen from the photograph of the temple published along with this article that the original idols of Shri Vitthal and Rakhumai installed in the temple have still be retained in the temple as Shri Sai Baba had reverence for that god as stated at the beginning of this article. The beautiful idol of Shri Sai baba in plaster was made by one sculptor Shri G.V.Patkar. Though the temple was originally constructed as a private temple, still it was latar on thrown open to everyone for worship and at present anybody can go and offer flowers or garlands to Shri Sai Baba or Shri Vitthal - Rukhumai.\n\nIn the rear side of this temple, there is a banyan tree about hundred years old. Around this tree we can also find the idols of Shri Datta, Hanuman and Pindi of Shri Shakar. In addition to that, there are the Padukas of Shri Sai Baba in silver in this area. These Padukas were installed at the October 1952.\n\nThe practice of getting prepared the silver Padukas of Shri Sai Baba and give them to different people or institutions dedicated to Sai worship, was started by this temple. So far, the Sai Padukas got prepared by this mandir have been installed at five different places. It may be noted here that the Padukas installed at the Sai temple of Smt. Ajibai Wanarse at London, were got prepared by this mandir.\n\n\"Service to humanity and Service to the dump mutes is the service to God\" this was the moto of Shri Sai Baba and the management of this temple has borne in mind this fact. They have therefore coupled a social duty with this religious institutions. On the first floor of this temple, arrangements have been made for the free accommodation of poor and deserving students, Who have no arrangements to stay in Bombay. A great number of students have taken advantage of this facility and because of the religious atmosphere of the temple, these students are grooved in Sai devotion from the young age of their life.\n\nAarti, worship etc are carried out at this temple every day as per those performed at Shirdi. Ramnavami, Gurupournima and Vijayadashmi are the great festivals observed at this temple on the same lines as is done at Shirdi. This temple has started one more practice. On every Shivaratri day, the offering of fruits is made to Shri Baba and they are later on distributed to the devotees by way of prasad. Shri Pandurang Mahadeo Warang is a staunch Sai devotee, who manages the daily affairs of the temple with great care. He is only thirtyone years of age at present, but for the last twentytwo years he is staying in the temple premises and is attending to the work of this temple. The management wants to expand the activities of the temple and arrange some further programmes on a large scale; but due tot shortage of space they feel sorry that it is not possible for them. Shri Warang always says that all his difficulties are readily solved by Shri Sai Baba. This shows his great faith in Shri Sai Baba and his devotion to Him.\n\nGirgaum is a very crowded locality of Bombay city. They area round about Lalbaug and Parel which is known as the \"Mill area\" is perhaps another equally crowded area in Bombay. The people in the \"Mill area\" are so very busy in their struggle for existence, that they have hardly any time to think about god or existence. The people in the Girgaum area are mostly white collard people. They have regular hours of their office work. Similarly religious practices are imbibed in them from their childhood. Hence they find the need of a place for worship where they can get mental peace. The people who were formerly they devotees of Vitthal have started visiting this temple for the worship of that god; but after seeing the idol of Shri Sai Baba in the temple and having come to know. His greatness, they automatically become His devotees. Thus this temple has a good place of worship for the devotees staying in Girgaum area of the Bombay city and is therefore requented by a number of devotees every day.\n\nNamdharak bowed to Shri Siddhamuni with folded hands and said, \"gurudeo, you hyou have narrated to me the life of Shri Guru and have given me the real gnyan(knowledge) which has wiped off my karma and by your blessing, I have known the essence of religion. Devotion to Shri Guru is like the Kalpataru and Rishis like Vashishta and Shuka also follow this path. Now kindly tell me the path of Sadguru.\"\n\nBeing pleased with the question, Shri Siddha said, \"Namdharak, you are very fortunate as you as you have asked question regarding the eternal principles, knowing with illusion and ignorance are wiped off and the mind becomes becomes as clear as the light of the sun.\n\nOnce when Shri Shankar was sitting on a beautiful point of Kailas, Devi Parvati with folded hands said to him with devotion, \"Great God of Gods, Guru of the universe, give me Gurumantra and kindly tell me the means by which one's soul becomes united with Brahma\".\n\nShri Shankar said, \"Dear Devi, this is a question which has never been asked to me so far by anybody. You are my second form. So I shall tell you this gist and this will benefit all the people also\".\n\nVeda, Shastra, Purana, Ithihas, Mantra-tantravidya, Smriti-jaran-maran(using the the power od doing miracles by the devotees of shiva and shakti) and other various sciences put one in illusion. Without knowing the gist of devotion to Guru, people perform sacrifices, observe penance, vrat, charity, recitation and go to the holy places but only after the rise of the light of Shri Guru, difficult vidya, worldly illusion and ignorance are all wiped off. By serving Shri Guru, all sins perish and the soul becomes pure and united with Brahma.\n\nTaking the holy water, touched by the lotus like feet of Shri Guru, is like a bath at a holy place. This Tirth is as holy as Kashi or Prayag.\n\nAlways remember Shri Guru. Recite Shri Guru's name all the time. Obey his orders, serve and worship Shri Guru with devotion. Doing this, one can even attain my position.\n\nThe alphabet 'Gu' means darkness and 'Ru' means light. Guru means the knowledge of the light of Brahma, that destroys darkness of ignorance. 'Gu' is the first alphabet to create illusion and other attributes. 'Ru' is the second alphabet of Brahma which destroys illusion and vain appearance. This power of Guru is supreme and is difficult even for the Gods to obtain.\n\nA Sadhak (disciple) should offer to Shri Guru good seat, bed, clothes, ornaments, conveyances etc. He should serve him with devotion for getting one's position, ashram, caste and pray him with body, senses, money, son, wife, etc. clearly and should not be ashamed to lay prostrate before him.\n\nMen go to hell by living in family life as one's body is full of worms, night-soil, urine, phelgm, blood, flesh and bad odor. Bow to Shri Guru, who liberates a person from the worldly miseries.\n\nShri Guru is Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesha and Para-Brahma. He is the cause of the creation of Universe, liberator of persons from this worldly sea and giver of the knowledge of all the vidyas.\n\nBy applying the ointment of Shri Guru's knowledge to one's eyes, closed eyes are opened, parents, brothers, and good men who give real knowledgen of worldly life, are all Gurus. Though there is diversity in the universe, yet there is oneness. Shri Guru protects one from all difficulties, showing the cause and effect.\n\nIf Shri Shankar or Shri Vishnu are enraged, Shri Guru protects the devotees, but when Shri Guru himself is enraged, even Shri Shankar or Shri Vishnu cannot protect them.\n\nJust as the blind man cannot see the light of the Sun, so the dull persons do not see the nectar-like appearance of Shri Guru, which is visible only to the eyes of the thoughtful. Shri Guru is like a monarch, who is witnessing the drama of creation and destruction of the universe.\n\nThree Nath, Ganesh, 3 Bhairava Peethas, Siddha, 3 Batus, 2 Pad, 3 Dooties, Shri Shankar, 4, 6, 8, 9 Veeresh, 5 Veeravalies are all associated with the best 'Shri Malini' mantra. Bow to this Shri Guru mandal.\n\nTo think about Shri Guru's body is like thinking about everlasting Shri Shiva and to recite Shri Guru's name to praise to eternal Shiva's qualities.\n\nShri Guru is birthless, devoid of oldage and has no begining. He is self created, devoid of change, full of bright bliss, minutest of the minute, greatest of the great and eternal. He is self shining, spotless, sky pervading, everlasting and has no decrease. Vedas and aManu describe Shri Guru's penance in this way. Therefore always remember Shri Guru.\n\nBy the knowledge of self, which is pervading all the universe, moveable and immoveable, sins of several births are atoned. There are no greater principle than the knowledge of self. There is no greater penance than the service of Shri Guru and there is no deeper knowledge than the advice of Shri Guru.\n\nShri Guru is Jagannath (lord of the universe) and the Guru of the 3 Lokas. Shri Guru is the universe and our soul is the soul of all the creation. Bow to Shri Guru, who gives this knowledge.\n\nThe persons, who are proud of penance and knowledge and who are engrossed in the worldly affairs, are like the pots moving on the wheel of a pot-maker. Gods, Gandharvas, fore fathers, yaksh, kinnar, rishi, siddha, who do not serve Shri Guru do not get salvation.\n\nBow to Shri Guru, who is supreme joy and who gives the best pleasure. He is shrine of knowledge, above division, sky pervading, knower of 'Tattwam Asi' (that thou art) principle, only one, eternal, pure, immoveable, who witnesses everything and who is devoid of existence and three qualities(Satwa,Raj and Tam).\n\nTo know one's self is the supreme knowledge and the utmost goal of life. This is attained only by the favour of Shri Guru.\n\nRemember Shri Guru till death. Even if he is fickle minded, do not forget or forsake him.\n\nThe wise should not speak about Shri Guru with disrespect. Do not tell a lie before him.\n\nThosewho despise Shri Guru go to hell. Those who discuss vainly with Shri Guru become Brahma Rakshas and have to live in barren and waterless places.\n\nOh Parvati, Shri Guru protects his disciples, even if god, muni or pannag curses. Gods and munies are weak before Shri Guru, whose curses can destroy them in no time.\n\nO Devi, according to Smrities and Vedas, Shri Guru is Parabrahma. Guru is a mantra of two syllables.\n\nBow to Shri Guru, who is pervading all the universe from Brahma to grass, who is eternal, whole, formless, devoid of qualities, engrossed in self-knowledge, above divisions and full of real bright-joy (sat-chit-anand rup).\n\nBrahma is eternal like fragrance in camphor and flowers and like the coolness and warmth in an object. This knowledge can be got only through Shri Guru. So worship and serve him with pure and clear heart and singular devotion. One, who is united with Brahma in meditation, realises Kundalini, Brahma Randhra and formlessness and gets salvation without doubt.\n\nThe ignorant wins over the worldly sea and the wise besides gets knowledge of actions and no-actions by following the path of Shri Guru.\n\nThose, who read, hear or write Shri Guru Geeta and give it in charity with money, all their desires are fullfilled. Always read Sri Guru-Geeta to get rid of the miseries of the wordly life.\n\nEach and every syllable of Guru-Geeta enables to win death, remove all difficulties and fear of yaksha, Rakshas, ghosts, thieves, tigers and diseases. It gives the power of using Bhasma, mesmerism and hypnotism.\n\nO Devi, read Shri Guru-Geeta, sitting on a site of kush grass(dharbhasan) or white blanket withattentive mind. Use a white seat for peace, red for mesmerising, black for punishing the evildoers and yellow for getting wealth. For peace, sit facing the north, for mesmerising facing the east, for punishing the evildoers facing the south and for wealth facing the west.\n\nRecitation of Guru-Geeta, gives one incentive power, develops one's qualities, destroys evil acts, makes good acts successful, removes fear of Grahas(planets), destroys evil dreams, gives issues even to sterile women, gives goodluck to the married women(keep their husbands alive all their lives) and gives peace of mind.\n\nIf a widow reads Shri Guru-Geeta without object, she gets salvation. If she reads with desire, she will get a good husband in the next birth and all her miseries, difficulties and curses will perish.\n\nShri Guru-Geeta is like a Kamadhenu to those who read it with some expectation. It is like a kalpataru to those, who read with desires. It is like a chintamani to the thinkers of everything good. If you read it for salvation you get salvation, if you read it for worldly pleasures, you will get them.\n\nOne can read Shri Guru-Geeta with some object, sitting on a bank of a river or the sea shore, in the mandir of Vishnu, Shiva, Devi or other God, math, cowshed, under vat, awala, mango tree or near a plant of Tulsi or dhotra or in the cremation ground at aa lonely but clean and neat place.\n\nEven though a devotee of Shri Guru may be a fool, still he is great, all his good acts, penance, vrat, diksha become successful. They are never futile.\n\nAs Shri Guru knows Brahma, he is always pure and whereever he goes, there is the presence of God, Tirth and Peeth. One who reads Guru-Geeta sitting or lying on a bed, standing, walking, speaking, riding on a horse or an elephant, is pure. He has no rebirth.\n\nA soul is one with God, just as the water in the sea, the milk in the milk pot, the ghee in the ghee-pot and the sky in the broken pot are one with them, similarly the Dnyani(learned), is united with God and lies lost in himself day and night.\n\nO Parvati, when one is blessed by Shri Guru, all his doubts vanish, goddess Saraswati resides on his tongue and he gets both the pleasures and salvation by the favour of Shri Guru. One's recitation, vrat and penance of several births bear fruit.\n\nO Waranane (having good face), I told you, this principle of Sankhya sastra One God, one religion, one devotion, one penance are nothing else but Shri Guru himself. There is no higher principle than that of Shri Guru.\n\nThe home, where is devotion of Shri Guru, parents, family and race, is fortunate. Those, who do not adore Shri Guru due to Vanity of knowledge and penance, are unfortunate.\n\nEven to Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Gods, Rishi, Forefathers, kinnar, siddha, charan, yaksh, munies, the favour of Shri Guru, is like the great holy Tirth. Shri Guru's Tirth is the root of all the Tirths.\n\nIf one reads Shri Guru-Geeta in travel, or during war, at the time of the attack of an enemy, he gets victory in life and salvation at death.\n\nIf Shri Guru-Geeta is read with evil acts, at evil places and with fickle mind, it gives evil effects.\n\nAs you are dear to me, I have told this gist to you. Keep it with yourself. Tell this to one, who is not engrossed in worrdly pleasures and has devotion; but do not tell it to him, who is not devoted, who is a deceit, cunning, atheist and who discusses vainly.\n\nHere ends the gist of Shri Guru-Geeta in the form of a dialogue between Ishwar and Parvati, included in the Uttarkhand of Skand Purana.\n\nNamdharak bowed to Shri Siddhamuni with folded hands and said, \"gurudeo, you hyou have narrated to me the life of Shri Guru and have given me the real gnyan(knowledge) which has wiped off my karma and by your blessing, I have known the essence of religion.

Shri Guru's Tirth is the root of all the Tirths.\n\nIf one reads Shri Guru-Geeta in travel, or during war, at the time of the attack of an enemy, he gets victory in life and salvation at death.\n\nIf Shri Guru-Geeta is read with evil acts, at evil places and with fickle mind, it gives evil effects.\n\nAs you are dear to me, I have told this gist to you. Keep it with yourself. Tell this to one, who is not engrossed in worrdly pleasures and has devotion; but do not tell it to him, who is not devoted, who is a deceit, cunning, atheist and who discusses vainly."
