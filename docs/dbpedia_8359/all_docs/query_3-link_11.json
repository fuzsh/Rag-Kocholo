        "text": "To Mee Navhech\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nDirected by Vinayak Chaskar\n\nProduced by Pradeep Dalvi\n\nWritten by Acharya Atre http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prahlad_Keshav_Atre\n\nStarring Prabhakar Panshikar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhakar_Panshikar\n\nRelease date(s) 1962\n\nCountry India\n\nLanguage Marathi\n\nTo Mee Navhech (Translated as: That's not me, Devnagari: तो मी नव्हेच)\n\nis a classic Marathi Play written by Acharya Atre. Though the\n\nprotagonist role has been played by many actors since its inception in\n\n1962, the role played by Prabhakar Panshikar is the most memorable. To\n\nMee Navech is probably the first play in the world where the same\n\nactor has to do five completely different roles, not to merely add to\n\nnovelty value or as a stunt, but because the story demands it[1]. To\n\nMee Navhech was also among the first Marathi plays to make use of the\n\nRevolving Stage between two scenes.\n\nBackground\n\nA conman Lakhoba Lokhande is being prosecuted in the court of law for\n\nallegedly duping people, marrying women for money and essentially\n\nliving multiple lives. He tries to defend his own self by asking\n\nuncomfortable questions to each witness during the cross-questioning.\n\nThe entire play is set in a courtroom scene with a revolving set used\n\nfor cut scenes and flashbacks.\n\nStoryline\n\nThe storyline focuses on a con Lakhoba Lokhande, who claims he is a\n\ntobacco merchant from Nipani. The drama starts with a courtroom scene\n\nin which Lakhoba Lokhande is sitting in the defendant box. He has been\n\naccused by the prosecution of swindling different persons through\n\ndisguise and fraud. The prosecution lawyer presents many witnesses,\n\nmost of whom are the victims of Lakhoba's embezzlement (and in some\n\ncases torture). The witnesses narrate their experiences with the\n\ndefendant through flashbacks. Lakhoba runs his own case after firing\n\nhis lawyer. He cross questions the witnesses and during the process\n\npleads his innocence by saying \"To Mee Navhech\".\n\nCharacters played by Prabhakar Panshikar in the play\n\nCharacter Picture\n\nLakhoba Lokhande: A tobacco merchant from Nipani\n\nDivakar Datar: A secret political officer of the Kingdom of Mysore\n\nDajishastri Datar: Elder brother of Divakar Datar\n\nCaptain Ashok Paranjpe: A Navy officer and younger brother of Divakar\n\nDatar\n\nRadheshyam Maharaj: A saint\n\nTone of Narrative\n\nThe general tone of the narrative of \"To Mee Navhech\" is rather\n\nsarcastic.\n\nReferences\n\nPRABHAKAR - A SUN IS BORN\n\n14th March 1931. A Son was born in the Panshikar Family in Mumbai.\n\nOriginally hailing from Pedne, Goa, the Panshikar family was steeped\n\nin tradional learning of subjects like Sanskrit, VedaShastras and\n\nAstrology. The grandfather of the child (to be named Prabhakar), was\n\npandit Vasudev Shastri Panshikar, the Chief Editor of the famed\n\nSanskrit publishing house ''Nirnaya Sagar Press''. He has to his\n\ncredit the monumental achievement of having researched, edited and\n\npublished in the finest and purest Sanskrit some 300 texts. These\n\ntexts occupy the pride of place in every Sanskrit reference library of\n\nthe world. The father of the child, Pandit Vishnu Shastri Panshikar\n\nwas also a renowned Vedic scholar, who specialised in Astrology and\n\nedited, ''Jyotir Mayukh'', a tretise on the subject.\n\nDespite inheriting this legacy of traditional learning, Prabhakar\n\ndiscovered early in life that he was cut out for different things. At\n\nthe age of 15 (1945-46), on an impulse, he acted in a play for the\n\nAnnual Gathering of his School. The appreciation that he evoked for\n\nthat role however, drew him closer to the stage than he had imagined.\n\nThis growing involvement gradually led to a consuming passion for\n\nacting, which finally resulted in his dropping out of school in his\n\nmatriculate year (1949). Meanwhile, he had acted in numerous plays\n\nstaged by various schools and social institutions. He was now\n\nseriously studying the fifth 'Veda', the 'Natya Veda'. In 1950, he got\n\nhis first break as an apprentice to the great Film Director, Shri\n\nVishram Bedekar, for the production called 'Vasudeo Balwant'.\n\nUnfortunately, this opportunity and whatever other bits of work came\n\nhis way, did not translate into financial stability. On a spirited\n\nimpulse, he left home and for almost six years, practically lived on\n\nthe streets. He struggled on (with a little help from friends here and\n\nthere) with scant regard for basic needs and comforts, for finally\n\nonly one thing mattered Theatre\n\nIn 1952, Panshikar got an opportunity to direct a play in the local\n\nGaneshostav festival. The Success of this play sparked off an upswing\n\nin his carrier, or perhaps it was the outcome of all those years spent\n\nin struggle, but he began receivin directorial assignments from\n\nvarious Social institutions and even Corporate theatre groups. In the\n\nCentenary year of the Western Railway, Panshikar directed a Marathi\n\nplay 'Amaldar' and Hindi Play 'Naya Zamana' for the Railways. He\n\ndirected plays based on a wide range of subjects for Mazagaon Docks,\n\nBombay Port trust, the National College and several other respected\n\norganisations. He presented solo acts of soliloquies from Shakespeare.\n\nHe recorded for many plays on the Radio and got an opportunity to act\n\nin plays for Indian National Theatre. All these activities however\n\nwere very low paying and Panshikar could barely keep body and soul\n\ntogether on his meagre earnings. True to self, rather than crib about\n\nhis financial state, he was thrilled, happy and convinced that his\n\nlife was on the right course.\n\nTowards the end of this trial, in 1956-57, Panshikar began doing bit\n\nroles in the commercial shows of popular plays like 'Kulwadhu', 'Maze\n\nGhar', 'Vahini', which were produced by a leading Marathi Theatre\n\nCompany called 'Natya Niketan'. Finally, in August 1956, he got a\n\nsubstantial role in a Farce 'Bhatala Dili Osari'. This was his first\n\nfresh role meaning one that he was the first to enact and he played a\n\nnew-age poet in it. This role proved to be a milestone in his career\n\nand he finally received due praise and recognition as an actor on\n\nCommercial Marathi Stage.\n\nSUNRISE AT LAST...\n\nShortly thereafter, Panshikar was appointed as the Manager of 'Natya\n\nNiketan'. Since he was an actor first, he could and therefore had to\n\nstand in during 'emergencies' for other actors. This is how he\n\npolished and groomed himself as a versatile actor one capable of\n\nplaying the lead, the villain, roles of Old, young, crippled, funny\n\nmen, the entire range. This is where he cut his teeth on the art of\n\nProduction. This is where he studied and mastered all theatre\n\nproduction.\n\nThis relentless struggle of fifteen years was finally rewarded in\n\n1962, when Panshikar got the lead role in a new play called 'To Mee\n\nNavech', There is an old adage ''There comes a tide in the life of\n\nevery man, which, taken at the ebb, leads him to his fortune. '' It\n\nwas an opportunity of a littletime and Panshikar was poised and\n\nwaiting for it. The play went on to earn tremendous acclaim for the\n\nnext four decades and continues to draw crowds even today.\n\nPanshikar's brilliant touch turned his role to gold. 'To Mee Navech'\n\nis probably the first play in the world where the same actor has to do\n\nfive completely different roles, not to merely add to novelty value or\n\nas a stunt, but because the story demands it. The ceaseless journey of\n\nthe play from 1962 to 2003 has been one long story of absolutely\n\nselfless devotion to theatre and incredible consistence in\n\nperformances all 2800 shows.\n\nPanshikar was 31 when the play was launched. Today he is 72, going\n\nstrong an little things like a bypass heart surgery or advancing age\n\ndo not deter him one bit. The incredible energy and enthusiasm that he\n\nhas for anything and everything connected with theatre is enough to\n\nput anyone half his age to shame.\n\nThe inaugural show of 'To Mee Navech' was held in New Delhi, on Vijaya\n\nDashami day, 8th October 1962. It is indeed a happy coincidence that\n\nthis booklet revives those golden memories in the same city, at the\n\nsame time of the year, 41 years later.\n\nPanshikar Family: THE ROOTS\n\nLate Pandit Vasudevshastri Laxmanshastri Panshikar (77)\n\n(Grandfather)\n\nBorn in 1860 at Pedne, Goa.\n\nDied in 1937 at Mumbai\n\nLate Pandit Visnushastri Vasudeoshastri Panshikar (84)\n\n(Father)\n\nBorn in 1888 at Pedne, Goa\n\nDied in 1972 at Mumbai\n\nhttp://www.natyasampada.com/panshikar-family.htm\n\nTHE BIRTH OF 'NATYASAMPADA' - PRODUCTION HOUSE PAR EXCELLENCE\n\nShortly after 'To Mee Navech', Panshikar entered into a partnership\n\nwith Mohan Wagh (Owner of 'chandralekha' one of today's leading\n\ntheatre companies) and Vasudeo Kolhatkar and launched 'Natya Sampada',\n\ntheir own Theatre Production House, on 8th April 1963. After a low-key\n\nstart, the Company hit upon its first success with 'Ashrunchi Zaali\n\nPhule', a play written by Prof. Vasant Kanetkar. The cast comprised of\n\ntheatre heavyweights such as Panshikar himself in the central role pf\n\nPrincipal Vidyanand, Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar (the most popular film and\n\nstage actor in those days), Mr. Chittaranjan Kolhatkar (a stalwart of\n\nMarathi theatre), Ms. Faiyyaz, Ms. Kusum Kulkarni etc. The Direction\n\nof this play was entrusted to Mr. Purushottam Darvhekar of Nagpur, for\n\nwhom this was a first break on the commercial Marathi Theatre scene in\n\nMumbai Mr. Darvhekar eventually became a great success in this field\n\nand settled down in Mumbai. The stage sets were designed and created\n\nby Mr. Raghuvir Talashilkar. Over a span of thirty six years, this\n\nplay did 1,111 shows, Panshikar alone acting till the very last show\n\nthe rest of the cast having undregone several changes. Finally, in\n\nafirst incident of its kind, the entire cast publicly 'retired' in an\n\nemotionally charged function, and one 'last show'. Normally, the\n\nlaunching of a play is associated with pomp and ceremony. True to its\n\nform, 'Natya Sampada' even discontinued a popular play in a blaze of\n\nglory.\n\nhttp://www.natyasampada.com/natyasampada/profile.htm\n\nThe play 'To Mee Navech' is a courtroom Drama and the author has used\n\nthe technique of flashback scenes for narration. This calls for\n\nfrequent shuttling between the Court Room the present and the various\n\nother scenes from the past. The operational problems in actually\n\ndepicting this on stage were daunting and the first Director hit upon\n\na solution that was considered novel in those days. He divided the\n\nstage in two parts, and used two separate curtains to cover them.\n\nThese curtains would go up and down alternately and cover and uncover\n\nthe two halves as required. This enabled the stage behind the stage\n\nbehind the closed half curtain to be set while the narrative\n\nprogressed on the other half of the stage.\n\nA few years later, the rights to 'To Mee Navech' passed into the hands\n\nof Atre Theatres. The owner of this Company, the playwright Mr. Atre\n\ninsisted on a new style of presentation. Panshikar applied himself to\n\nthe problem and came up with a true winner the 'Revolving Stage'.\n\nAfter conceiving the idea, he made a model. The stage was\n\npainstakingly fabricated by Mr. Mhadba Mistry at his 'Vishwas\n\nEngineering Works' Kolhapur. He was ably assisted by Mr. Shamrao\n\nSalokhe and Mr. Rajaram Chavan. This is the world's first portable\n\nRevolving stage. The credit for this invention goes to Prabhakar\n\nPanshikar and thereby to Marathi Theatre.\n\n1966 - Natya Sampada hit upon its first success with 'Ashrunchi Zaali\n\nPhule', a play written by Prof. Vasant Kanetkar. Panshikar designed\n\nthe 'Sliding Stage' for this play and further enriched the process of\n\ntechnical development of Marathi Theatre.\n\n1967 - Panshikar produced a Musical play 'Katyar Kaljat Ghusli',\n\nwritten and directed by Mr. Purushottam Darvhekar. Panshikar designed\n\na 'Triple Revolving Stage' specially for it.\n\nhttp://www.natyasampada.com/contribution-to-theatre.htm\n\nIn 1966, Maharashtra was struck by a terrible famine. Panshikar toured\n\nfor a whole month, staging shows of his latest hit play, 'Ashrunchi\n\nZaali Phule' and presented the Govt. Of Maharashtra with Rs. 22,000\n\nfor the Famine Relief Fund.\n\nPanshikar toured all over Goa and raised funds totaling Rs. 66,000\n\nwhich he handed over to the Gomantak Marathi Academy, for construction\n\nof the 'Marathi Bhavan'.\n\nA Senior Journalist from Pune, Mr. Vasudeo Kulkarni was desperately in\n\nneed of a kindly transplant. Panshikar staged a special Charity show\n\nof 'To Mee Navech' at BalGandharva RangaMandir', Pune and handed over\n\nthe proceeds to Mr. Kulkarni.\n\nhttp://www.natyasampada.com/social-contribution.htm\n\nChaturang Interview- Introduction 1 Watch Video\n\nhttp://www.natyasampada.com/videos/Chaturang/intro1.htm\n\nTo mee navhech chi goshta Watch Video\n\nhttp://www.natyasampada.com/videos/Chaturang/ToMeeNavhech.htm\n\nDipliKumar Ani To Mee Navhech....\n\nDilip Kumar visited to view the show of 'To Mee Navhech'. Watch Video\n\nAfter the play 'To Mee Navhech' became a runway success, a film\n\nproducer Mr. Sadashiv Raokavi, obtained the rights for making a Hindi\n\nFeature film based on the play. He offered the lead role (played by\n\nPanshikar in the original) to the top Hindi Filmastar Mr. Dilip Kumar.\n\nAnd so one day in 1963, Mr. Dilip Kumar dropped in to watch a show at\n\nRang Bhavan, Mumbai.He sat on the audience through the first act, but\n\ncame and stood in the wings and observed Panshikar in the second act.\n\nWhat he saw impressed him greatly. After the play, he declared that\n\nthe play and Panshikar's role in it would lose all its novelty and\n\nthrill if it were turned into a movie. He therefore declined to play\n\nthe role, even if the producer went ahead with the production. The\n\nproject was shelved soon thereafter. Mr. Dilip Kumar reminisced aloud\n\nabout this incident during his speech on the occasion of the 1000th\n\nshow, where he was the Chief Guest\n\nhttp://www.natyasampada.com/videos/Chaturang/dilipkumar.htm\n\n^ http://www.natyasampada.com/biography-n.htm\n\nCategories:\n\nMarathi-language films | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Marathi-language_films\n\nIndian plays | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Indian_plays\n\nMarathi literature | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Marathi_literature\n\nIndian literature | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Indian_literature\n\nMarathi:\n\nGrammar · http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_grammar\n\nPhonology · http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_phonology\n\nDevanagari script · http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari\n\nModi script · http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modi_script\n\nLiterature · http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_literature\n\nPoetry · http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_poetry\n\nSamyukta Maharashtra Movement · http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samyukta_Maharashtra_Samiti\n\nMaharashtra State · http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra\n\nMarathi Wikipedia . http://mr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A0\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Mi_Navhech\n\nhttp://bakulaji.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/to-mee-navhech-sid-harth.html\n\nhttp://bakulaji.typepad.com/blog/"
