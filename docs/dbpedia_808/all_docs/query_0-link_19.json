        "text": "Welcome to the Jenny Woolworth Women in Punk Archive. This database features female performers active in the underground and independent music scene of the 1970s and 1980s. It is by no means comprehensive and in many ways totally subjective.\n\nThanks to the individuals from whom I collected ideas, names and information over the years, especially the Typical Girls mailing list and Sharon Cheslowâ€™s Women In Punk List.\n\nIf I have overlooked something, please contact me!"
