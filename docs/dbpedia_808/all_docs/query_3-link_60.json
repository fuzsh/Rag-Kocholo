        "text": "Written by Piero Umiliani Date 1968 Source Svezia, Inferno e Paradiso\n\n(Sweden, Heaven and Hell) Publisher Edward B. Marks Music Company\n\n\"Mah Na Mah Na\" was written by composer Piero Umiliani for an Italian \"mondo\" film (exploitative pseudo-documentaries) about life (mostly sex-related) in Sweden, titled Svezia, Inferno e Paradiso (Sweden, Heaven and Hell). It is a nonsense song that achieved widespread fame as a classic Muppet sketch.\n\nAlthough it was first performed in a Henson production on Sesame Street by the character who would become Bip Bippadotta and two Anything Muppet girls, the most famous Muppet rendition of the song debuted on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1969, where it was performed by Mahna Mahna and his back-up singers, the Snowths. This version of the skit was restaged many times on a number of variety shows before being featured as the opening number in the premiere episode of The Muppet Show.\n\nRegardless of who is singing, the basics of the performance remain the same: a central character starts out conforming to the structure of the song, but falls into improvisational scat passages whenever possible. Although the back-up singers attempt to bring order back to the number, their effort is ultimately futile.\n\nThe number became popular enough that it was spoofed by the Muppets themselves in a sketch on Muppets Tonight, in which Kermit the Frog complained to his psychiatrist that the Snowths would appear every time he said the word \"phenomena.\"\n\nThe Muppets ends with a montage of celebrities performing the classic number with the Snowths. The Muppet Show recording can be heard playing in a car in the official movie trailer.\n\nPerformances[]\n\nReleases[]\n\nAudio[]\n\nThe Muppet Show version\n\nThe Muppet Show (1977)\n\nMahna Mahna/Mr. Bassman (single, 1977)\n\nMahna Mahna/Sax and Violence (single, 1977)\n\nFavorite Songs From Jim Henson's Muppets (1986)\n\nMuppet Hits (1993)\n\nMusic, Mayhem and More!

Its usage in material outside of Muppet/Henson productions do not necessarily equate a reference to the Muppets, unless one of the Muppet versions is directly sampled or referenced in the source material.\n\nA line in \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's 2003 song \"Couch Potato\" mentions \"The Muppet Show where they go 'Mahna Mahna!'\"\n\nThe song was sung in the style of the Muppets by Gareth, David, and Ben in the first episode of the second series of BBC's The Office. After they finish singing the tune, David sighs \"ah, Muppets\".\n\nA 2005 television advertisement for Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr Pepper featured the recording of \"Mahna Mahna\" by Jim Henson and Frank Oz.\n\nA clip of the song and video was used in an episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\n\nIssue #2 of The Treasure of Peg-Leg Wilson features Mahna Mahna and the Snowths at Machu Picchu, singing the name of the Incan ruin to the tune of \"Mahna Mahna.\"\n\nA Sesamstrasse film featuring girls on a rock climbing wall is underscored by Cake's cover on the For the Kids album.\n\nCee Lo Green's 2012 Christmas song with The Muppets \"All I Need is Love\" features samples of the song.\n\nIn a 2022 video published to the Lincoln Center's social media, Kermit the Frog is seen at his dressing room mirror doing vocal exercises, repeating \"mee-may-mah-moe-moo-Mahna-Mahna.\" He then turns to the viewer and says \"Mahna Mahna... ten points if you know what comes next.\"\n\nThe song serves as Lips' ringtone in The Muppets Mayhem episode \"True Colors.\" Lips appropriately answers his calls with \"Mahna Mahna.\"\n\nNotes[]\n\nAccording to his wife Debbie, Caroll Spinney was responsible for introducing Jim Henson to the song.[1]\n\nSources[]"
