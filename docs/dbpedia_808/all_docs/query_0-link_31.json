        "text": "ANTI-SCRUNTI FACTION\n\nAKA: ASF\n\nFormed: Boulder, Colorado, USA\n\nThis delightfully-named four piece (three girls and a guy on drums) first appeared on Flipside Vinyl Fanzine Volume 1 (1984), with the song 'Big Women', which may or may not have been a riposte to G.B.H.'s song of the same name (both bands were next to each other on the comp). Alternatively, the track listing might have been wrong and 'Big Women' should have been titled 'Slave To My Estrogen'. They graduated to their own release a year later with the A Sure Fuck EP, which did feature 'Slave To My Estrogen'.Mah moved to San Francisco after ASF split and formed Tribe 8, who re-recorded 'Slave To My Estrogen' as 'Estrofemme' for their Role Models For AmeriKKKa album. The band also appeared in 1992's girl gang movie The Yo-Yo Gang. Musically, the band was nowt special.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nLineup:\n\nTracie Thomas - guitar, vocals\n\nLeslie Mah - bass, vocals\n\nEric Vavleuven - drums\n\nSarah Bibb - drums\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nDISCOGRAPHY\n\nSingles & Albums\n\nA Sure Fuck (7\", 1985)\n\nDamsels In Distress (LP, 1985)\n\nVarious Artists\n\nFlipside Vinyl Fanzine Volume 1 US LP 1984 (Gasatanka): Big Women\n\nTour De Farce #2 Germany Tape 1987 (eMpTy): Innocent Victim\n\nThe Best Of Flipside Vinyl Fanzines US 2xCD 1992 (Flipside): Slave To My Estrogen\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nLinks"
