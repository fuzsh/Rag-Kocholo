        "text": "\"Moonpie!\"\n\n―Meemaw to Sheldon, The Meemaw Materialization\n\nConstance \"Connie\" Tucker, better known as \"Meemaw\" is the mother of Mary Cooper and the maternal grandmother of Sheldon Cooper, George Cooper Jr. and Missy Cooper, as well as the great-grandmother of Missy Cooper's son, Constance Cooper and Leonard Cooper. She is Sheldon's favorite of all his living family members, as he shows her no resentment at all, unlike his resentment toward his other family members, except his mother. She was widowed in 1985 when her husband, Sheldon's grandfather \"Pop-Pop\", passed away. She had only been mentioned and had not appeared in the series, until \"The Meemaw Materialization\" during which she made her first appearance, in February 2016. She is played by Academy Award nominee June Squibb. In Young Sheldon, she is portrayed by actress Annie Potts.\n\nLike Sheldon has explained, Meemaw is a wonderful, warm, loving, sweet and wise grandmother who's protective and caring for Sheldon. She calls him \"Moon-pie\" because he's so \"nummy-nummy, she could just eat him up!\"\n\nOverview[]\n\nYoung Sheldon[]\n\nMeemaw is a primary character on Young Sheldon. She occasionally helped her daughter Mary look after the latter's children (Sheldon, Missy and Georgie) but when Mary offered to take a job at the church, Meemaw declined to take care of her grandchildren full-time perhaps because she's gotten old and lacks the energy to do so. (Pilot (Young Sheldon))\n\nMeemaw was considered by her children and grandchildren to be an excellent cook, especially when she made her homemade brisket. George Sr. loved the brisket deeply and always acted on his best behavior to get Meemaw to give him the brisket recipe, though Meemaw refused because she didn't want George Sr. to marry Mary in the first place. She's the only one to comfort Sheldon after Stephanie Hanson's death, which is part of the reason Sheldon regards her so fondly.\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nShe is introduced in Young Sheldon as a caring grandma. (Pilot (Young Sheldon))\n\nWhile Meemaw babysits the kids, She and Sheldon play poker and teaches him about what’s on a person’s face is not always what's in their heart. When George gets a heart attack, She finds out George had been taken the emergency room at the hospital, so she had to watch the grand kids.

(Poker, Faith, and Eggs)\n\nMeemaw tries to date both John Sturgis and Ira, but is convinced by Sheldon to set ground rules.

She gives a fake recipe, to which he goes on multiple places to get them, including a drive to Louisiana to a Madame Laveau to get spices. He spends 14 hours to cook in vain, but fails. They talk and Meemaw seemingly accepts him as a worthy son-in-law, only for George to get the recipe from Sheldon as soon as she leaves.

Penny locates a wrong box which holds the letters from Sheldon's grandmother. Penny calls Sheldon \"Moonpie\", as she has read from a letter. Sheldon is agitated and tells Penny, \"No one calls [him] Moonpie, but Meemaw.\" He also explains that Meemaw calls him Moonpie because \"[he's] nummy nummy and she could just eat [him] up\".\n\nHis Meemaw is effectively Sheldon's weakness in several episodes. He generally refuses to consider any ill will or imperfection she has, including the thought that Meemaw needed to have sex in order to conceive his mother. Wil Wheaton also uses Sheldon's adoration for Meemaw against him, stating that his own grandmother passed away, which caused him to miss a convention of which Sheldon had attended to meet Wil Wheaton in his childhood. This story forces Sheldon to back down in a Mystic Warlords of Ka'a card tournament, relinquishing the championship title to Wheaton in the episode \"The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary\". This story was only a ruse in order for Wheaton to win against Sheldon, of whom he couldn't beat through gameplay.\n\nIn \"The Precious Fragmentation\", Raj, Howard and Sheldon each want The Lord of the Rings movie prop ring and the last one holding it gets it. Howard's mother wants to know where he is and Raj starts making trouble for him messing up Howard's lies. (\"I am so glad we came to this Gentile strip club! Howard, here's more bacon to tuck into the shiksa's g-string!!\") Then they decide to talk about Sheldon's mother and grandmother. His Meemaw had to have sex to have his mother and she had sex because she liked it (\"Meemaw did the nasty\"). This is after Sheldon called \"No Meemaw's\", meaning she wasn't to be included.\n\nBy Sheldon's descriptions, Meemaw has made cookies for him and had him polish her silver.\n\nIn \"The Desperation Emanation\", Sheldon says that when his grandfather Pop-pop died, his mother set her up to go to a senior center to socialize with other people.\n\nIn \"The Agreement Dissection\", Sheldon is asked by Penny if he has ever kissed a girl and Sheldon answered other than his mother, his sister and his Meemaw, no; But once on a bus had to give mouth to mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion.\n\nIn \"The Santa Simulation\", Sheldon says that Meemaw and Pop-Pop were singing Christmas carols as he tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Lego.\n\nIn \"The Clean Room Infiltration\", Amy had contacted her so she could make Sheldon his favorite cookies for Christmas from his Meemaw's recipe.

(although the Arcadian French is more geographically plausible)\n\nJune Squibb portrays Meemaw in TBBT.\n\nMeemaw makes her first appearance in \"The Meemaw Materialization\".\n\nMeemaw's first name is Constance.\n\nAccording to \"The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification\", Meemaw is Sheldon's last surviving grandparent.\n\nHer last name, which would also be Mary Cooper's maiden name, was revealed to be Tucker in \"Jiu-Jitsu, Bubble Wrap, and Yoo-hoo\".\n\nMeemaw says that the reason she calls Sheldon \"Moonpie\" is because \"He's so nummy-nummy, [she] could just eat him up!\" Which Leonard and Penny knew but Amy didn't as he never told her and she didn't \"bother to ask\".\n\nLike Flora, Meemaw is older than Professor Proton was when he died.\n\nShe was similar to Amy Farrah Fowler, because she was married to Sheldon's grandfather, Pop-Pop, who was just like him.
