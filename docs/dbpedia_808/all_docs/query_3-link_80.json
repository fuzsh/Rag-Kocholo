The band's first single, Pigbitch, was released on Harp records, run by Gina Harp in 1991. The second single, There's a Dyke in the Pit, with Bikini Kill, 7 year Bitch, and the Lucy Stoners was released by the queercore record label Outpunk in 1992, and later releases were on the independent record label Alternative Tentacles. The band appeared on film in A Gun For Jennifer and also performed in She's Real, Worse Than Queer, and Rise Above: A Tribe 8 Documentary by Tracy Flannigan.\n\nBreedlove has performed spoken word on Sister Spit tours, and at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival. Tribe 8 also played at the San Francisco Transgender March, multiple Ladyfests and LGBT Pride Festivals, including Europride 2000 in Rome, Italy.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2006, in San Francisco, Breedlove co-hosted with Tara Jepsen, a monthly sexuality and gender identity-based cultures open mike called K'vetch. Breedlove MC'd the 3rd Annual SF Trans March in '07.\n\nIn 2002, Breedlove's first novel, Godspeed was published by St. Martin's Press. The main character of the book is a methamphetamine-using bicycle messenger named Jim. The main character is said to be based on Breedlove's years as an addict. In 2007, a German translation of the novel was published, titled Götterspeed on Mox und Moritz.\n\nGodspeed is now a short film, starring Breedlove as Jim, the antihero, Ad-Rock of the Beastie Boys as the dispatcher, and Jillian Lauren, aka Sparkle Diamonds of the LA burlesque troupe Velvet Hammer, as the stripper love interest. It features music by Tribe8, Lunachicks, The Gossip, Katastrophe, MDC, All The Pretty Horses, Bikini Kill, Le Tigre, Blatz, and Dirtbox. Breedlove co-directs with Jen Gilomen, co-produces with Kami Chisholm, wrote the script and is currently writing the screenplay for Godspeed the feature film.\n\nStarting in 2004, Breedlove created the comedy solo show Lynnee Breedlove’s One Freak Show which has been touring the U.S., Canada, and Europe in 5 languages.\n\nSince 2004, Breedlove often hosts Gender Pirates, a monthly benefit for the group United Genders of the Universe in San Francisco, and has hosted the Unka Lynnee Show on Pirate Cat Radio (formerly the Unka Lynnee & Aunty Cindy Show with Cindy Emch), as well as taught Unka Lynnee's Skool 4 Boyz at The Harvey Milk Institute. The column, \"Uncle Lynnee's Skool For Bois,\" ran for two years at On Our Backs magazine and twice as \"Unka Lynnee's Skool 4 Boyz\" at Velvet Park Magazine.\n\nIn May 2013, Breedlove appeared on Music Life Radio discussing Tribe 8, and Homobiles, the new LGBT ride sharing non-profit service founded by Breedlove in San Francisco."
