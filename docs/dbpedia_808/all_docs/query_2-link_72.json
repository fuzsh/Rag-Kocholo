        "text": "It's nearly time to head back to the classroom. Are the students in your life equipped with the best tech? Right now, you can snag some crazy-good back-to-school deals on Apple iPads, Amazon Fire tablets and Samsung Galaxy tablets.\n\nTablets are a great portable option for students. They can use them to read textbooks, take notes and even complete assignments, when paired with a Bluetooth keyboard. However, the best tablets of 2024 can get a bit pricey for parents and students. That's why we've rounded up the best back-to-school tablet deals to help you find the right device for the best price.\n\nIf you're confused about which Apple iPad model is best for you or the person you're shopping for, be sure to check out or easy-to-understand, 2024 Apple iPad buyer's guide. It explains the differences and similarities between all of the iPad models.\n\nBest back-to-school deals on Apple iPads\n\nHere are some great deals on Apple's popular tablets.\n\nApple iPad (9th Generation, 64GB, Wi-Fi only): $199 (40% off)\n\nAs part of Amazon's back-to-school and pre-Labor Day sale, here's a chance to own a brand-new, Wi-Fi only Apple iPad (9th Generation) tablet with 64 gigs of internal storage, for just $199. This is the lowest price we've ever seen for this popular entry-level tablet. Based on more than 66,800 customer reviews on Amazon, the iPad (9th Generation) has earned 4.8-stars out of five, so you know people love it.\n\nThe iPad (9th Generation) is not the most current version of the basic iPad, but it does run the same version of iPadOS and comes with the same collection of apps as all other current iPad models.\n\nThis iPad runs using the slightly older and less powerful Apple A13 Bionic processor and comes with just 64GB of internal storage. Since you get iCloud, this lack of internal storage probably won't be an issue. This iPad is the perfect starter tablet for kids or pre-teens, or anyone who wants to enjoy an iPad without paying top dollar for an iPad Pro or iPad Air. You get up to 10 hours of battery life per charge.\n\nThis tablet is equipped with a 10.2 inch (2,160 by 1,620 pixel resolution) Retina touchscreen display, along with a 12MP front camera and 8MP rear camera. It also uses TouchID to unlock the tablet by placing your finger on the Home button. This feature is also used to confirm online purchases. Choose between a space gray or silver casing.\n\nTo expand the capabilities of the tablet, you can pair it with the optional Apple Pencil stylus ($69), Apple Smart Keyboard ($134) and the $89 Apple AirPods (2nd Gen) wireless earbuds.\n\nApple iPad (10th Generation, 256GB, Wi-Fi only): $459\n\nWhat better way to kick off the school year than with a new iPad to handle all your most important tasks, educational or otherwise?\n\nThe latest edition in Apple's classic iPad lineup is the iPad 10th Generation. This 10.9-inch tablet features a Liquid Retina display with Apple's True Tone technology, and it looks absolutely fantastic.\n\nIt runs using Apple's A14 Bionic processor, an upgrade from the previous generation A13 chip. The iPad 10th Generation is compatible with Wi-Fi 6 for fast wireless performance. It also offers all-day battery life (up to 10 hours), so you can easily take it to school without having to worry about plugging it in mid-day.\n\nThe iPad 10th Generation comes in four vibrant colors: yellow, pink, blue and silver. You can also choose between a Wi-Fi + 5G cellular or WiFi-only models. This deal is for the version with 256GB of storage and Wi-Fi only.\n\nApple iPad Air (5th Generation, 256GB, Wi-Fi only): $699 (7% off)\n\nThere's nothing thinner or more portable among Apple's full-sized tablets than the iPad Air. It's the perfect choice for toting everywhere. And when you pair it with the Apple Pencil, you can draw and sketch to your heart's desire.\n\nIntroduced in 2022, the 10.9-inch Apple iPad Air (5th Generation) is the latest in the lightweight iPad Air line. This tablet offers performance up to 60% faster than the prior model, thanks to Apple's M1 chip. The device boasts a 12-megapixel, wide-angle back camera that can capture up to 4K resolution video. It also offers touch ID.\n\nIt additionally features a 10.2-inch Retina display, includes 256GB of internal storage and offers up to a 10-hour battery life.\n\nThis edition of the iPad Air runs the latest version of iPadOS and comes with the same collection of preinstalled apps as the most current iPads. It runs using Apple's M1 processor. It's just 0.29 inches thick and weighs 1.07 pounds.\n\nIt's available in five colors.\n\nApple iPad Mini (6th Generation, 64GB, Wi-Fi only): $380 (24% off)\n\nLighten your backpack load with the iPad Mini. It offers a smaller size display than other iPad models, but provide the same core capabilities.\n\nYou get an 8.3 inch Liquid Retina touchscreen display. This tablet is powered using an Apple A15 Bionic processor. It also features a 12-megapixel, wide-angle back camera and a 12-megapixel, ultra-wide-angle front camera. It boasts landscape stereo speakers and is available in four colors.\n\nDue to its smaller size and lighter weight, many people prefer this iPad over others when using it as an e-reader, since it's more comfortable to hold for extended periods. E-books can be acquired from Apple Books, but optional apps can make it compatible with your Kindle or Nook e-book library. It also works with the Libby service for borrowing e-books and audiobooks from your local public library.\n\nBest back-to-school deals on Samsung tablets\n\nIf you're seeking an Android tablet for yourself or the student you're shopping for, here are some great options.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S9 (256GB, Wi-Fi only): $760 (17% off)\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 is powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor. It features an 11 inch AMOLED screen and comes configured with 8GB of RAM (upgradable to 12GB). You also get 128GB of storage.\n\nWe like that this Android tablet is very well protected: It's designed with an Armor Aluminum frame and rated IP68 for dust- and water-resistance. That means it's no sweat if you drop it on the way to school or it gets jostled in your bag. It'll still be good to go to get you through another assignment.\n\nAn Samsung S Pen stylus is included as well, so you can take notes, scribble and doodle, or sketch out ideas for projects without resorting to scratch paper.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab A8 (32GB, Wi-Fi only): $189\n\nThe Galaxy Tab A8 offers a 10.5-inch LCD display, 32GB of storage and fast-charging capabilities. Though it's priced under $200, it's no slouch when it comes to productivity.\n\nYou can enjoy all the same things you would with one of Samsung's newer Android tablets with this model. It won't be able to multitask as well, but it's more than useful for online classes, word processing, putting together projects and even unwinding by streaming video content or managing your social media accounts after a long day of school.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S8 (128 GB, Wi-Fi only): $500 (29% off)\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 is a 2-in-1 device with laptop and tablet functionality. It's a great form factor for handling all your school needs and then some. Plus, it has a gorgeous 11-inch touchscreen screen, so everything looks crisp and bright, even if you're only using it to unwind after class with some chill Netflix viewing.\n\nLike most Android tablets, this one features Microsoft 365 integration for a better laptop-like experience. That means if you use a Windows computer or laptop for school and need integration with your tablet for working on the go, you can log in to the same apps with Microsoft 365, so none of your documents are floating in the ether. A Microsoft 365 subscription is required.
