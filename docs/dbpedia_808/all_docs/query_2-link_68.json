But when an unexpected on-set love connection threatens to ruin his plan, manufactured drama collides with real emotion in this original new musical.\"\n\nThe company will feature Calvert (world premiere of Nobody Loves You at the Old Globe Theatre), Fenkart (Memphis), Hartrampf (Second Stage Theatre Uptown's The Bad Guys), Hurlbert (Legally Blonde), Kritzer (Legally Blonde, A Catered Affair), Molina (Sweeney Todd, Rock of Ages), Tony nominee O'Malley (The Book of Mormon) and Reid (Really Really).\n\nAlter (composer and co-lyricist) wrote music and lyrics for Band Geeks! (with Tommy Newman, Mark Allen and Gordon Greenberg), which premiered at Goodspeed Musicals. His other shows include 29, a pop-rock song cycle (New York University), Young Zombies in Love (New York International Fringe Festival), The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: A Romantic Comedy with Negin Farsad (Edinburgh Festival Fringe) and Vapor Tales with Dominic Mah. A 2009 Jonathan Larson Grant recipient, Alter has won awards from the San Francisco Bay Area Theatre Critics Circle and the New York International Fringe Festival for his scores.\n\nMoses (librettist/co-lyricist) is the author of the full-length plays Outrage, Bach at Leipzig, Celebrity Row, The Four of Us, Yellowjackets, Back Back Back and Completeness; the musical Fortress of Solitude (with Michael Friedman and Daniel Aukin); and the evening of short plays Love/Stories (or But You Will Get Used To It). On television, he has written for both TNT's \"Men of a Certain Age\" and HBO's \"Boardwalk Empire.\" He holds an M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing from New York University and has taught playwriting at Yale University and NYU. He is a member of the Dramatists Guild, MCC Playwrights Coalition and is a New York Theatre Workshop Usual Suspect. Other members of the creative team include scenic designer Mark Wendland, lighting designer Ben Stanton, costume designer Jessica Pabst, sound designer Dan Moses Schreier and music director Vadim Feichtner.\n\nNobody Loves You had its world premiere at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre in the summer of 2012. An earlier version was seen at NAMT's Festival of New Musicals in October 2012."
