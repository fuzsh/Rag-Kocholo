        "text": "I was thinking about what is left over from work done or from ones own experience. I think of a scene from the Musical Film Paint Your Wagon when a scheme is made to gather all the gold that falls down under bars and saloons. Miners for gold losing their gold dust. A clever way to get rich or collect from what is unknowingly or uncaringly left behind.\n\nThat is what it is like for me now as I gather my Flipside Fanzine gold that is dissected all over the place. I know I will never get rich from my gossamer shining memories or documentation of a scene during my youthful rebellion, but it seems to go on shimmering everywhere. It has a real story and narrative that I still gather.\n\nI cannot put back together the vein of gold enduring as a solid experience that was documented but I can try and show my story, the Flipside Fanzine story, as it happened, and this is important to me. I can be a magnet pulling the gold of Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine towards me and alchemize the authentic narrative to share. A richness like gold that will endure.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI don’t know if I will get to all 11 from my catalog but at least I got to two more. From the original catalog I did in the 1980s. I wanted fans to at least get an organized sense of what we had to offer. I find it delightfully youthful and fanatical as a 65-year-old woman to read these. We were all into the punk scene and loved it madly. I was about 25 when I made this up.\n\n(I am not a professional DJ haha).\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nA blast from the past… read with a magnifying glass.\n\nJust having some fun reading over this. It was written back in the 1980s when I felt the need to make the things we were selling understandable in my rude punk way. It was not easy being a female punk around bands, records collectors and all the people who were tough as gram crackers. I am sure pissing off others was not something I tried to do but most likely did. Yet I was the nicer one most times.\n\nI still have the original and it is falling apart so I have it now in a video I made up.\n\nI like going over and keeping my mind fresh on these memories. I am amazed at how many shows I went to. It overwhelms me now as it did then but it was all documented so that makes it nicer still.\n\nI am not a professional actor so reading this was hard to do but I like the cockiness of it.\n\nI was well trained and initiated in the art of one “who caused considerable trouble.”\n\nAll Flipside persons’ are… and that is just how it goes.\n\n~ Hudley\n\nDocumenting what has already been documented…. as a original source person who was there doing the documenting … as a girl.\n\nLos Angeles Flipside Fanzine # 54 Ten Year Anniversary Issue Facebook Page is obsolete.

(1977 to 2002)\n\nAs a co-publisher, editor of Flipside Fanzine I hold to my heart a need to protect and preserve the memory of this Fanzine. Being its roughly 20 years of existence.\n\nHow it is presented to the world is important to me. At one time Flipside Fanzine supported a beginning and then growing underground, and international, punk rock scene.\n\nOver the last few years, I have had bands, record labels, writers and major movie companies approach me for images for their work and/or production pertaining to Flipside Fanzine. I engage the many demands in a proper and organized manner.\n\nThere is not another Flipside person who has stepped forward to engage this pressure.\n\nMy intentions are good for Flipside Fanzine, and I will continue to protect it as best I can. I hold good integrity too. I can choose with whom I share or sell things from this Fanzine.\n\nBe it the fanzine itself, videos, or records. I am under an umbrella of protection, and I can release things for such productions as I always mention those involved at the time if they are dead, or otherwise, or do not want to be bothered. Flipside was a fast moving fanzine with many who did willfully engage freely in its creative life time.\n\nI love Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine. It is ironic to me, but Flipside’s created products become more precious with time. Everything Flipside “produced and created” is becoming more in demand.\n\nIn its publishing history there have only been two owners of Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine, its “living publishing time,” Al Flipside (Al Kowalewski) and me Hudley Flipside (Holly D Cornell).\n\nI promise to do my best with all of Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine documented materials and all products over its full life. Yet now it is a defunct fanzine and we only see it as a history of what once was and so many of its creations still shine in many corners of the world.\n\nMy Aim Is True,\n\nHudley Flipside / Holly D Cornell\n\nThe Seminary of Praying Mantis Publishing\n\nhudleyflipside@gmail.com\n\nhttps://hudleyflipside.com\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMANY HANDS IN THE FLIPSIDE FANZINE COOKIE JAR\n\nWhich band was on both Volume 1 and 2 ?\n\nMy Dell computer got Covid19 and is now at Docs. A rather new one for having issues with Dell and Windows. But shit happens. It is good too because I got out an older computer and cleaned it and upgraded the software and it is running very nicely. It cannot use any of my Adobe programs but that is OK. At least it can go online and work here on my WordPress site.\n\nIn the process I came across some stuff I was doing that needs to be followed through with. So, I will do it now.\n\nHere are the two vinyl fanzines vol. 1 and 2 through “Flipside / Gasatanka.” Mighty amazing at the time for a growing punk scene. I am grateful to the bands. The contributions to our fan base were well received and the promotion did not hurt either.\n\nWorking with Al and Bill was fun and I never quite knew where the boat was sailing but we ran a tight ship and got to shore. Then got these records on the deck for distribution.\n\nA time when bands, fanzines, records labels and others worked together without big heads but instead with a real love of the music we supported in so many ways.\n\nI did the layouts for the inserts and helped where I could with the more in-depth recording and promotional aspects of getting these out. And to the other artists and executives … thank you too, you know who you are. Lots of hands in the Flipside cookie jar.\n\nAl and Bill were a dynamic duo to work with and, as the third fanatic, we three did good for the love of a punk scene.

I can say I was a punk rock correspondent entrepreneur. This is how I met Leslie Mah and Tracie Thomas of A.S.F. During the punk scene of the 1980s, tapes and correspondence were part of our lives and I was taken by the gals of A.S.F., mostly because women were not a big staple of the scene we had grown to know. I made it happen and we put out their record. Women, punk rock, politics, sexuality, racism, and abounding creativity is the loud heartfelt sarcasm that emanates from this band. I remember making vegetarian spaghetti in our kitchen with Leslie. Taking Leslie and Tracie to the beach was a real treat. I got my first tattoos with the A.S.F. girls. A contrary experience for me because at the same time we were working with the bands Doggy Style and Detox. Some of my best memories of co-running a fanzine. Leslie Mah and Tracie Thomas went on to have an interesting life creatively and I am happy for them.

Also, to put mayonnaise and BBQ potato chips on a French bread sandwich as purely delicious. We silk-screened art projects in our garage, and I had fun being house mother. The super-duper days in the punk house at Flipside Fanzine central in good old Whittier California.\n\nFlipside Record Five\n\nThis is a two-band compilation featuring two of Australia’s hardest hitting and most well-known bands: Vicious Circle and Perdition.

I don’t know why I excluded Flipside Vinyl Fanzine Number One, maybe at the time we ran out of them for sale. Yet I will include it later in my gathering of Intellectual Property … my journey to bring together what was lost on the internet wasteland. (If only symbolically)\n\nA friendly gesture to remember what seems vague in my senior years. Thank you for indulging my fiery drive. As Emma Jung, wife of Swiss psychologist and psychiatrist Carl Jung, said and I paraphrase, “Sometimes a dame has got to do something for herself that no one else fucking understands, who cares cause she knows why she is doing it… for her own soul.” There now that feels better. I am just in the gathering phase. I call it Phase A.\n\nIncluded below is some remarkable history about the process of creating this Vinyl Fanzine. Many hands in the cookie Jar. Heartfelt Thanks!!\n\nFlipside Vinyl Fanzine Number Two with loads of bands.\n\nSide One we have MIA “Just A Dream.” Decry “Island Paradise.” Out Patients “Backwards Explosion.” Naked Raygun “Metastasis.” Roach Motel “Mad Dog.” JFA “Out of School.” Massacre Guys “Let’s Forget.” Vagina Dentata “Golden Boys.” Plan Wrap “Magnetic Shoes.”\n\nSide Two we have DI “Johnny’s Got A problem.” Misfits “Attitude.” Necros “Walking the Dog.” C2D” Aggression System.” Iconoclast “Domination or Destruction.” Cheetah Chrome and the Motherfuckers “No Words.” Disorderly Conduct “How Old Are You.” Catatonics “Descending In “E.” Braille Party “Let It Burn.” Germs “Forming.” (I’m sorry for saying mean things about Darby in Ink Disease Fanzine, he was just such a stinker.” GKH “Dickerman.” Agent Orange “Shakin’ All Over.”\n\n“Chaz”, as he was known to most, was guitarist for Eddie and the Subtitles, a local punk band that was influential on younger Fullerton punks as the Adolescents and Social Distortion, both of which recorded their early demos and singles at Casbah and continued recording albums there as their popularity grew.\n\n“I don’t think they shared musical tastes” stated Michael Hutchinson, producer for Billy Idol and Berlin, observing “I don’t know how excited Chaz was about Berlin – he was more excited about punk stuff.”\n\nYet there was an excitement that came from the blending of the two distinct cultures: one typified by Chaz and his cronies’ slacker ethos, the other by St. James and his commercial sensibilities and keen awareness of musical trends. After the success of Stacey Q’s Better Than Heaven, St. James deferred ownership of The Casbah to Ramirez.”\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casbah_Recording_Studio\n\nNew Casbah Recording Studio\n\nhttp://casbahrecording.com/\n\n“Bill Bartell~ His contributions to the punk rock scene were numerous between writing, playing in his band and releasing records on his now-defunct Gasatanka Records label.”\n\nR.I.P.
