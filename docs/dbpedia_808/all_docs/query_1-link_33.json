        "text": "Tribe 8's \"Neanderthal Dyke\" is a satirical, tongue-in-cheek song that critiques the patriarchal standards of beauty that are often upheld by the feminist movement. The song suggests that even feminists can be shallow and hypocritical when it comes to attraction and desires. The lyrics describe the singer's conflicted feelings about his \"pc girlfriend\" who he likes for her mind and body, even if it's at odds with his political beliefs. The title \"Neanderthal Dyke\" seems to suggest a contradiction between the \"primitive\" and \"evolved\" aspects of the singer's desires."
