        "text": "Tickets are now available for the 2024 Pottery Lunch, which honors the memory of Yvonne Leslie. This year’s theme for the tablescaping competition is, “My Favorite Things.” At this event, you will view beautifully decorated tables inspired by the table designer’s favorite things. There will be a delicious luncheon buffet served and a cash bar. There will be raffles, door prizes and a grand prize raffle to a fun destination. Doors open for table viewing at 11 AM with lunch being served at 12:15 PM.\n\nGroup seating reservations must be made together with tables seating eight people. Seating accommodations will be accomplished to the best of our ability. Tickets are $50 and may be purchased by calling the museum at 586 465-2488 or click the button below.\n\nA note from the chairperson Barb Dempsey\n\nThe pottery luncheon was started in 1999 by my best friend Yvonne Leslie, to raise money for the Mount Clemens Crocker House Museum. Yvonne was an active member and past president of the Mah-Nah-Be-Zee- Questers, as well as the Crocker House Museum Coordinator. She was passionate about antiques and history and enjoyed volunteering her time. After Yvonne’s passing in 2002, the event was renamed to the Yvonne Leslie Pottery Luncheon, to honor her memory and dedication to this event.\n\nThe first Pottery Lunch, organized by Yvonne Leslie of the Mah Na Be Zee Questers, was held at the Mount Clemens Recreation Center. Tables were set with china, Mount Clemens Pottery and unique centerpieces.\n\nMr. Doll, one of the owners of Mount Clemens Pottery was the speaker for that event.\n\nAttended by 30 people, the lunch raised funds to purchase a bridal basket for the Crocker House Museum collection. When you visit, you will find it in the museum’s dining room.\n\nPottery Lunch continued annually under Questers’ sponsorship for the next 19 years, with attendance exceeding 450 people. Funds raised supported Crocker House restoration projects, as well as local, state, and national programs.\n\nIn 2020, Pottery lunch transferred to the Macomb County Historical Society, Crocker House Museum and Gardens. The event was postponed for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Macomb County Historical Society looks forward to presenting this event annually, hopefully for the next 20 years. We look forward to your comments and suggestions about this event.\n\nAll proceeds from this event support the Crocker House Museum and Gardens."
