        "text": "White Lung\n\nNow that I'm home doing nothing for nearly three weeks, I'd figured catching up on things I've been meaning to post since the summer... well either do this or read a book about Reagan-- tough call.\n\nMost of my listening to Vancouver-based White Lung's second 7\", Magazines, came at the end of my summer, when I was basically listening to half Dangerhouse/Dangerhouse rip-off stuff (the other half being Lookout! things). After their first release on the smaller Hockey Dad Records, they moved over to Deranged for this one.\n\nI don't know if they have a publicist or it's just 'cause they have the novelty of being four (good-looking) girls in a punk band or 'cause they're awesome, but when I was looking some stuff up, I noticed that White Lung have gotten a lot of press from some unlikely sources (various locals, Vice). This doesn't do much good because they give you token comparisons like the Ramones, but it did pay off when I read that guitarist Natasha described them an \"an eight-legged ball of fury.\"\n\nThe A-side is the real hit here; for starters, punk songs about ketamine? Still, with each song on here, Mish's vocals provide a bite. Put that over Dangerhouse style and occasional haunting post-punk moments (as on \"Backhouse\"), and I'm sold.\n\nAs for what's up next, I've read that they've recorded (or are recording a new 7\"), and when I emailed the band about posting this a few months back, they said they'd tour the East Coast once they're LP is out-- fingers crossed on all accounts. They've got a West Coast tour slated for February for all y'all on this coast.\n\nWhite Lung- Magazines 7\"\n\nGet it from Deranged\n\nSlumberland orgy this week!\n\nSo I've been just terrible at keeping this up lately- I didn't even post the last two PRDCT playlists. Well, my excuse is that school sucks. I'm writing a thesis, so until March 1, this blog probably won't see too much action. Maybe winter break will see an update.\n\nWell, there's a little bit of good news to go along with this...\n\nThe last Cheeky show was awesome. Obviously, I'm sad to see them go, but I'm really excited to get the 12\" in the mail (order one from Freedom School!), and I picked up a tape of a live recording of theirs which is cool.\n\nI'll be doing a show with Christa next semester, which will rule. I haven't done a show with anyone for almost two years at this point, and Christa has gotten to hear me rant nearly every day for the past couple months about how excited I am that we're teaming up.\n\nAnd in the more immediate future, I'm putting together a Slumberland orgy this week to help celebrate its incredible twenty years of indie pop.\n\nAs always, if you're in Boston, listen in at 95.3 fm; anywhere else you can steam live at whrb.org.\n\nNovember 5, 2009 (PRDCT #33)\n\nPlease Inform the Captain This Is a Hijack- \"We Train These Robots\" | Defeat Or Humiliate The United States Of America (LP, 2006) | Clean Plate\n\nWipers- \"Is This Real?\" | Is This Real?

I didn't quite get to play everything I wanted to (nothing off of Fortune Cookie Prize, for instance!), but it was a lot of fun!\n\nHere's another gem of lo-fi punk. Kitty Cat Spy Club were a band in the early to mid 1990s out of the Bay Area. They remind me of some of the more down-tempo Frumpies stuff. In 1995 they put out the Decoy X split with the Teenagers on Radio Trash. I think the real tricky part is that the Teenagers were actually just an alias of KCSC with them mixing up what everyone played.\n\nKitty Cat Spy Club were a relatively short-lived band, but while they were around they played with the likes of Bikini Kill, Team Dresch, and the Donnas before they were the Donnas.\n\nKitty Cat Spy Club/Teenagers- Decoy X split\n\nOctober 29, 2009 (PRDCT #32, Halloween covers edition)\n\nLots of covers for Halloween- lots of fun!

STRAIGHT EDGE PEOPLE SUCK- happy edge day kiddos. Centless was a Cincinnati-based label, which I can only assume expired at some point in the '90s.\n\nA close second would be the Vendabait's Crushing My World 7\". I can find virtually no information on this band, but what drew me to this record in the RH library was a sticker that described it as punk by two boys and two girls (it doesn't take much more than this to sell me but it also said it was good and was written by the trusty squid). This came out in 1992; I can only assume they're also from Ohio, but as I said, I can find virtually no information on this band, and I'm too lazy to go back to the station and look at the liner notes right now (hence the tiny internet picture). If you need more convincing, there's an Avengers cover (\"We Are the One\")!\n\nThis is out of print, of course.\n\nVendabait- Crushing My World 7\"\n\nOctober 15, 2009 (PRDCT #30)\n\nYo! Sorry I've been so neglectful regarding posting things other than playlists lately- schooool. Hopefully I will rip a few things tomorrow and get some stuff to you. Let me know if you've got requests.\n\nFor now, I'm psyched for a couple shows. Scot put the first one together, and Christa took care of the venue. Both shows are all ages/no booze. The first is an $8 suggested donation, the second a $5 suggested donation. The TBA on the second one will be a new band with Dan, Nick, Will, & Mark, or if you want to make it sound all fancy, members of DST, Montcalm (throwing it back), Tussin, & Witches With Dicks/Closet Fairies.\n\nAnd to clear things up: Evan did request 3oh3 (or whatever it's called) on KJ's show.\n\n---\n\nAlgernon Cadwallader- \"Katie's Conscious\" | Some Kind of Cadwallader (LP, 2009) | Be Happy\n\nLittle Lungs- \"Atlantic Bridge\" | Hoist Me Up!

Instead I'll leave you with an album that you'll probably care more about anyway.\n\nI posted some Margaret Thrasher a little while back, and since then they released an LP (and also broke up). I don't think Moderate Rock grabs me quite as much as the 7\"s, but that may be hard to do. They still give you a dose of straight-up hardcore with throaty lady vocals, this time even scratchier I think. Jules gets it going from the very beginning with \"fuuuuuck, not again.\" \"Raise the Bar\" was one of my favorite longs from the 7\"s and is rerecorded here. It's played faster but somehow doesn't have the same bounce to it. Putting this all together, it doesn't sound like I really like this LP that much, but I do. I really do. A lot.\n\nThis was released on P-Trash but is already out of print, so try to hunt it down through some other distros.\n\nSupposedly some of the people from this band have something new going on, but I can't remember the name of it. I'll try to remember to ask Foreign Objects tonight (listen to them at 10 on Christa's show!).\n\nMargaret Thrasher- Moderate Rock\n\nFleabag\n\nI keep thinking I've heard my favorite demo of the year. First it was Foreign Objects. Then it was Bloody Gears. Then it was the Waifs. This time, I think Fleabag have done it.\n\nI guess this band's biggest claim to fame is that they're ex-Punkin Pie. I must confess that I've never been super fond of this band. They're super cute, of course, but if I'm gonna go with Plan-It-X-y pop punk, I think I'd choose another.\n\nFleabag, on the other hand, are beyond awesome. I first heard them on the Best of the Nest 2009 compilation put out by the New York-based feminist zine distro For the Birds (this is an awesome tape/CD by the way, so track it down!). My first time listening through this comp, I loved the Fleabag track the most. On the way down to Best Friends Day, Josh brought their tape along for the drive, and I fell further in love. One thing that I think is really cool is that they put the five songs on both sides of the cassette. They're one of a bunch of awesome pop bands from the Bay Area right now (maybe stretching it on the Bay a bit, but who's excited for the Sourpatch LP?!) They did an East Coast tour this summer, but hit Worcester rather than Boston. Hopefully they'll come back again!\n\n\"Curb Appeal\" is their track on the Best of the Nest, and I think it remains my favorite on the demo (at least for now since I'm most familiar with it). Like the rest of the tape, it's pretty straight-up pop punk with some '90s indie rock mixed in. I always love songs that reminisce about being a certain age- this really gets me with \"we were all 19, you'll forget me by the end of the week.\" Even just getting a chance to listen to more of the tracks now, they all get a big thumbs up from me. This tape rules- perfect for walking by the river in the sun, or in a few weeks, lamenting the sun that is no longer around.\n\nI thought this flier was cool, and I don't have the tape yet, so I can't scan in that art.\n\nYou can't really order this online, but if you get in touch with me I can send you their address and you might be able to grab a copy.\n\nFleabag- Demo\n\nBitch School\n\nI can't believe it's the end of summer. Like officially now. September 22nd is the fall equinox. I think I went through some intense listening phases this summer. It was primarily Lookout!-Dangerhouse Summer 2K9, but especially at the beginning of the summer it was Slampt-fest. OK not so much Slampt, but a lot of stuff that sounds like it could be on Slampt. Basically just snotty grrrls playing fuzzy pop kinda stuff. Basically when I was ripping a bunch of vinyl there was one awesome bin with things like Bette Davis and the Balconettes and Budget Girls.\n\nBitch School is a band I don't know too much about, and I can't find any info about them. This self-titled 7\" came out in 1999 I believe on Lipstick Records. Straight-up power pop with a bit of fuzz. Crush songs about record shops? The best!\n\nIf you know anymore about this band or how I might possibly get a copy of this 7\", let me know! (If it wasn't clear from the picture, this copy is from the station.)\n\nBitch School- s/t 7\"\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOh yeah and this weekend was awesome! Teenage Cool Kids were beyond fun. It was great to have a dance party with Audrey & Mark & Dan & lots of sweaty strangers I don't know. If you took pictures send me some.\n\nSeptember 17, 2009 (PRDCT #26)\n\nI wish I had recorded this show-- I think it was definitely one of my favorite solo shows I've done in quite a while. Thanks to the guy who called in about United Mutation.

While I'm excited to get back to my regular show, having guest DJs always mixed things up and introduced me to some new records. When Steve came in to spin some stuff, he brought in Anti Scrunti Faction.\n\nIt's not too hard to track down this band since Leslie Mah from Tribe 8 was in it. A.S.F. were total bad ass feminists in their own right though, appearing in cool queer zines like J.D.s and writing songs like \"Slave to My Estrogen.\" Plus they were totally crusty looking kids who wrote songs about what made them angry. Or sometimes depressed or happy. Check out this old MRR profile for some more info along with this Flipside interview. Plus in that Flipside interview Leslie says, \"I like colors and being positive.\" And I think they're way snottier than Tribe 8. Seriously, what's not to love? Their LP, Damsels in Distress, is long out of print, so do yourself a favor and grab it below.\n\nOh yeah, and speaking of MRR, the queer punk issue is out now so check it out!\n\nAnti Scrunti Faction- Damsels in Distress\n\nSeptember 4, 2009 (PRDCT #24)\n\nThings are mostly back to normal now-- the series of guest DJs from the summer is over.

Hopefully if you live above the Mason-Dixon line you got a chance to see them as well. Despite the fact that I saw them three times in four days, each show was awesome. Their tour kick-off was the dyke march benefit show on Friday, June 26 in New York. The Carnal Knowledge reunion was insane. Missed them the next night at Dan's house, but I heard it was fun, and the boys seemed to still be recovering as we drove out to Western Mass the next day. Meghan put together an awesome show. We missed Brain Killer but caught Waste Management, the Diamond Sea, Cult Ritual, Ampere, and Aerosols. The following night just required a short bike ride over to Gay Gardens to see Afflictions, Confines, and then the Diamond Sea and Cult Ritual again. Confines were my favorite of the evening. Their demo is all gone now, but you can (and should) download it here. While you're there, check out the Bloody Gears demo too because it rules.\n\nOK, back to the task at hand. My favorite description of this band is \"The Diamond Sea sounds like Sleater-Kinney through a Gang Of Four filter.\" Aside from the gimicky name drops and what not that make it so great, it's also probably the most accurate one.\n\nThis 10\" was put out by Yellow Ghost. Tara has also set up a bunch of awesome tours in Australia for bands like Ampere & Daniel Striped Tiger, and Punch will be headed over there soon.\n\nWhen I first grabbed this record I listened to the A-side over and over. \"Heavy Skies\" is probably my favorite of the album. While the first half is great, I think my focus on it meant I didn't listen to the B-side enough. \"Safe Keeping\" is certainly another favorite. Anyway, I'm kind of spent on writing about music for the day and I started this over a month ago, so I don't really remember where I wanted to go with this. I'll just let the Diamond Sea's music speak for itself.\n\nThe Diamond Sea- Slow Signal\n\nGet it here\n\nOK?\n\nA couple months back now (I guess, my concept of time has gone out the window, and I can't believe I'm moving again in two days), I got a triple dose of records from Life's a Rape: the Cult Ritual Holidays 7\", the new Loser Life LP, and the OK? 7\". The Cult Ritual 7\"? A dud. The Loser Life LP? Solid as usual. The OK? 7\"? The best of the bunch-- an awesome catchy surprise of catchy anarcho-punk.\n\nI don't really know a whole lot about OK?. They're from San Diego. I believe the singer has a love connection to Crime Desire/the guy who runs this label (scene gossip oooh). This is their first release. They haven't played too many shows so far. Mostly I know you should check out this record.\n\nI should have access to a scanner again in a week or so, but for now, my awesome photo booth pictures will live on.\n\nAccording to the liner notes, the A-side, \"Earthseed,\" \"is a passive call to arms, an observational description of the modern age and a speculation of that following; it is a record of a species living in denial or arrogance-- but not for long.\" The flip side \"Duress,\" \"is about marketing and about being force-fed nonsense. It describes the feeling of living in a culture that constantly bombards you with advertising, and the agenda these ads perpetuate.\"\n\nTo quote a certain message board poster, \"Punk needs more bands like this.\"\n\nTo order this paypal $5.50 to colinrrmf [at] yahoo [dot] com.\n\nFor now...\n\nOK?- Everything Is Going to Be 7\"\n\nAugust 12, 2009 (PRDCT #22 with Melissa and Dan)\n\nAwesome show tonight with Dan & Melissa. Melissa packed in the riot grrrls while Dan brought the punx and tolerated our little dance party to Skinned Teen. Dan started things off with his brother's old band. I had time to pack in a couple Foreign Objects songs, and we got to hear Melissa's first band, And I Can't Wait, too. I mentioned my recent acquisition to Melissa, so we continued that celebration--she said she hadn't listen to it in a long time, but still knew all the words. If you download the show there'll be a little weird pause static thing because I had to run an emergency test something-or-other. Also, for some reason we just didn't announce very often. I think Angela will be in next Wednesday for my last week of guest DJs/summer air.

In case you need a refresher, here's the playlist from PRDCT #11. I'm listening to it over again, and it's surprisingly competent considering I had just broken my edge & Steve gave me a 40 at the show. I'm also getting more used to listening to myself speak.\n\nThere's a bunch of things to look forward... I think right now I'm most excited to see Dead Uncles & Dylan Bredeau next Tuesday with Foreign Objects and the Waifs (aka Waifffs, new Boston band with members of Libyans, General Interest, Closet Fairies, blah blah blah).\n\nOther than that, I'll be heading down to New York in a few weeks for a visit. I'll definitely be checking out the Big She-Bang IV on Saturday, August 15, put on by For the Birds this year. In addition to a bunch of awesome workshops, Little Lungs, Zombie Dogs, Ina! Ina! (whom I missed at the Dyke March benefit/Carnal Knowledge reunion show), Kate Ferencz, Inertia, & Full of Fancy will be playing.\n\nThe weekend after, I'll be heading down to Richmond for Best Friends Day with a car full of punks. I'm excited (I'd even venture to say beyond excited) to see Pink Razors and hang out with some BFFs.\n\nOK... enough rambling. I get easily distracted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI don't listen to a whole lot of no-wave, but since Chris played some Bound & Gagged on my show a few weeks ago, I've been listening to that & Nervous Gender pretty consistently. I often kind of view this kind of stuff as a novelty, but I've been enjoying these.\n\nI'm not going to pretend I know a vast history of either of these bands. Instead, I'll give you a little bit and direct you to other places that are more comprehensive.\n\nBound & Gagged were an all-girl no-wave band from Boston. There's a myspace for them here that has a little bit more info.\n\nNervous Gender took its name because of Phranc's androgyny. I mostly know Phranc because of the Team Dresch song \"Uncle Phranc.\" I might be a bit of a n00b, but I'll use the fact that I was negative ten years old when this band formed as an excuse. There's a pretty good wiki page for them, and you can check out the band's website for some cool fliers & things.\n\nI'm upping the Bound & Gagged 12\" and Nervous Gender's side of their split LP with Beelzebub Youth called Music from Hell.\n\nBound & Gagged- s/t 12\" EP\n\nNervous Gender- their side of the Music from Hell LP\n\nJuly 30, 2009 (PRDCT #20 with Rob & Andy)\n\nThis was definitely a change of pace from past weeks. Andy & I ganged up on Rob for a little while though. Dan will be in next week followed by a different Dan & Melissa the next week. That's all I got for now.

Check out some of Rob's footage. And speaking (er writing I guess) of Rob, he'll be guest dj'ing along with Andy this week. Dan will be in the week after that.\n\nIn high school X was one of my favorite bands. I think I was in ninth grade when my sister's friend Ari first played Los Angeles for us, and since then I have never stopped loving them. Basically if you're a girl growing up in Southern California and you like punk, it's impossible not to be into this band. Read Lee's super-long rant about this over at cookie cutter.\n\nAnyway, X were my first introduction into the Dangerhouse catalog and remain my favorite. Lately though I've been listening to a lot of the Bags. I like to think of the Bags as the snot to X's sass. And you know how much Christa and I love snotty girls... actually I may not have given that rant on this blog, but basically snotty girls are the best.\n\nAll Bagged Up is pretty much what it sounds like- it's all of the band's recordings between 1977 & 1980... the Dangerhouse recordings and then a bunch of live stuff, rehearsals, demos, and alternate takes.\n\nThe Bags- All Bagged Up\n\nJuly 22, 2009 (PRDCT #19 with Steve and Liz)\n\nSteve and Liz came in and played some records with me tonight. Steve immediately won my heart when he played Julie Ruin in the first set. Things are really awkward between the two of them now because they got in a big fight and are no longer going to be living together. They will duke it out for Boston punk supremacy on Tuesday- Libyans are playing at PA's with the Shitty Limits, Logic Problem, & Women; Sexual Janitor are playing at Midway Cafe with Preyin Hands, Garbage Strike, & Bloody Gears- it's their demo release!

Samson session, Weakerthans followed by Propagandhi. Middle/high school jam session are totally necessary sometimes.\n\nI feel like this might get taken down reasonably quickly since it's a bigger band, but whatever. I don't think Fallow was one of the Weakerthans' most popular albums or anything, but it was the only one I had at the time (because it was the only one my older sister had, and I burned it from her). My most distinct memory of this band is discussing them on the bus to some softball tournament in ninth grade. My friend like Guster, I liked pop punk, this is where we found an overlap. Wow, that sentence is kind of embarrassing. She was a sophomore; at least I was only fourteen.\n\nThe Weakerthans- Fallow\n\nPens/Male Bonding + pixxx\n\nHung out with Screaming Females last night for their big show at House of Blues with the Dead Weather. It was totally crazy to see them play in such a big place- capacity is supposedly 2400. Anyway, it was sweet, and they get free beer, so now I'm stocked up. The girl in Discount sings for the Dead Weather, and she's a total fucking rock star/diva (not in a good way). That was whack. I wish I could see the Screamales/Shell Shag West Coast tour. Over in Cambridge though getting psyched for Punch/Ampere/Trifle Tower/Dark Forces/L'Antietam on Thursday night and then most likely Harvey Milk on Saturday night. In the future, I will almost for sure be headed down to Richmond for Best Friends Day.\n\nBack to the task at hand... As promised another PVI release. I started to write this at various points over the past month or so, so it's probably kind of all over the place.\n\nShitty picture of the album art... had another one but my camera broke/didn't back up my old hard drive recently at all. If you want to buy me a new one, get in touch. That would be cool.\n\nPens play sorta noisy pop... maybe if Skinned Teen (ok maybe I'm just saying this cause they're both English) were really hip 15 years later, slowed down a little bit, and became fuzzier and unintelligible. They might be the hippest of the bunch... doing a big West Coast tour with Graffiti Island and Crocodiles, capping it off with a San Diego show with Wavves & No Age. They're playing at Spaceland in LA, which Matt & I used to think was so cool in high school. It was 21+, and we would always say we were gonna go there for our 21st birthdays. Instead some of us have sisters & friends who hire cross-dressing singing telegrams to sing Beyonce and \"Happy Birthday.\" Anyway, Pens definitely give my favorite side of the split.\n\nThey play sorta noisy pop... maybe if Skinned Teen (ok maybe I'm just saying this cause they're both English) were really hip 15 years later, slowed down a little bit, and became fuzzier and unintelligible. Basically I've been listening to a fair amount of old Slampt stuff, and I feel like this is about the closest thing to a lot of that stuff that's around today.\n\nMale Bonding are more like Abe Vigoda or something. Not my thing as much, but still a good time.\n\nI pretty much haven't listened to anything else other than the PS Eliot LP this week. Sorry for the mediocre write-up. I guess you're used to it by now though.\n\nPens/Male Bonding split\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd here are a few pictures from last weekend...\n\nJuly 16, 2009 (PRDCT #18)\n\nKept things short & sweet last night. Forgot I had played Dangerloves the week before- guess I've been in the mood for power pop. Dan didn't end up coming in, but I had Jess to help me out/keep me company. I think Liz & Steve will be in for sure next week. Stoked to hang out with Screamales this weekend though not to be at the House of Blues.\n\nPunch- \"Don't Start\" | Punch (LP, 2009) | 625 Thrash/Discos Huelgas (playlist)\n\nCrucifix- \"How When Where\" | Dehumanization (LP, 1983) | Corpus Christi\n\nAnti-Cimex- \"When the Innocent Die\" | Raped Ass (LP, 1983) | Distortion\n\nLast Rights- \"Chunks\" | Chunks (7Inch, 1984) | Taang\n\nCult Ritual- \"Holidays\" | First LP (LP, 2009) | Youth Attack\n\nFailures- \"I'm Busy\" | Test Press (7Inch, 2009) | Painkiller (playlist)\n\nTurboslut- \"Invoking\" | split with Pygmy Lush (LP, 2009) | Exotic Fever (playlist)\n\nForeign Objects- \"Leave Me\" | Foreign Objects (7Inch, 2009) | Loud Punk/Shock to the System (playlist)\n\nThe Avengers- \"We Are the One\" | We Are the One (7Inch, 1977) | Dangerhouse\n\nRingers- \"Good Things Go\" | Hurry Up and Wait (12Inch, 2009) | 1-2-3-4 Go!\n\nP.S.

I found out on Friday night that Brainless Oneders couldn't play, which obviously was not ideal, but not really that big of a deal. We started really late (and I normally try to run relatively timely punk shows), but oh well, I knew that was going to happen. My camera won't turn on now (probably because of the shit show that ensued- see below, by Jacki), so I don't really have any pictures. Hopefully I will be able to recover them eventually though.\n\nI branded Allison.\n\nThe show itself was awesome. It was great to finally get to see PS Eliot play, and I was so psyched that Little Lungs could play too. Everything went really smoothly- a couple nice boys brought vegan cupcakes, a couple other attendees even drove down from Toronto for the show. Thanks all around to those who came, played, helped out with the show, etc.\n\nWhat followed was definitely one of the most fun nights I've had this summer complete with markers (again see above), quiet dance parties, climbing into windows, and a couple drinks. (hey PSE- I don't think you read this blog, but up the northerners, we totally kicked your asses.)\n\nSince then I've been consistently jamming their LP (put out on the always awesome Salinas Records, who will also be putting out a Hop Along 10\" very soon). They've sold out of it already on tour, but you can get it from the label eventually. I've also been getting a heavy dose of the King Everything demo (Katie's solo stuff). I also am currently wearing my brand new PS Eliot shirt, featuring an awesome drawing by Allison.\n\nI also drove down to see them last night in New Haven- Brian put together an awesome show, and it was great to see Dead Uncles again. It was a ton of fun, good to hang out with everyone again, but now I'm exhausted and am going to sleep.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso, a bit more on Hand Jobs from Claire... those songs from the tape are old and were recorded with their first drummer- they're currently scouting out number four, but she says, they'll \"be back making noise come the fall.\""
