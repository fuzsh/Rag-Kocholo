        "text": "Queercore band The Ooozes from the UK scorches feelings of betrayal with the pointed and cathartic “Sickening.” The distorted guitars slash through the air propelled by the rhythm as the fuel for vocalist Tom Gilbert’s outburst of righteous frustration and disgust. “You know you you did something wrong/Oh you did something so very wrong” could be about any number of things but the way the song is written it can serve as a vehicle for purging those feelings for anyone without needing to interject a specific offense. Who hasn’t felt that way and hasn’t quite heard that intensity of feeling put out there in a way that seems more like productive anger than the kind more unhinged and destructive? When Gilbert sings “I need a time out/It’s fucking sickening to think about” and “Fuck excuses/They’re all useless” despite the fire with which those lines are delivered there is a nuance of expression there that doesn’t dehumanize as the words denounce in no uncertain terms. Fans of Bratmobile, Tribe 8 and even Leslie Mah’s previous band Anti-Scrunti Faction will appreciate the raw, tuneful punk rock The Ooze has been putting out into the world since 2018. Listen to “Sickening” on Spotify and follow The Oozes on Instagram."
