        "text": "Anti Scrunti Faction were an all-women punk trio from Boulder, Colorado, US… Read Full Bio ↴Anti Scrunti Faction were an all-women punk trio from Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nThe band made their first appearance in 1984 on the Restless Records compilation LP entitled FlipSide Vinyl Fanzine Volume 1, assembled by the fanzine Flipside from California, with the song \"Big Women\". In 1985, Anti Scrunti Faction released A Sure Fuck, a single on Unclean Records. Appearing on the extended single are Leslie Mah, bass and vocals, Tracie Thomas, guitar and vocals, Sarah Bibb on drums for two songs and Eric Van Leuven on drums for the remaining four. Later that same year the album Damsels In Distress came out on Flipside Records. The artists' names are intentionally obscured on the album: the guitarist is listed as T. Thomas and the drummer is only named as \"E\". As on the single, these musicians are Tracie Thomas on guitar and Eric Van Leuven on drums. Credited as L. Mah, Leslie Mah again plays bass and sings. After Anti-Scrunti Faction broke up, Leslie Mah moved to San Francisco and joined Tribe 8, regarded as one of the seminal queercore bands. However, Anti Scrunti Faction continues to be popular among fans of old-school punk and fans of Tribe 8. The song \"Slave to my Estrogen\" is a stand-out favorite for radio airplay. In 1998, Tribe 8 recast \"Slave To My Estrogen\" as \"Estrofemme\" for their Role Models For AmeriKKKa album on AlternativeTentacles.\n\nAnti-Scrunti Faction, also known by the initials A.S.F., were one of the bands to be featured in the first queercore zine, J.D.s. They also appear in the film The Yo-Yo Gang by G.B. Jones. Leslie Mah and Tracie Thomas star in the movie and also perform the song \"Frat Boy\", from their single."
