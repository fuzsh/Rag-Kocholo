        "text": "The Steelers targeted several needs in the three-day NFL Draft. We will discover much later whether they actually filled any of those capably with the players they chose, but there is one thing we do know above all else:\n\nAfter Ben Roethlisberger, outside linebacker T.J. Watt is the player they least can afford to lose to injury in 2019. Watt has become a rising young star, a Pro Bowler in his second season and a pass-rusher in the mold of his older brother in Houston.\n\nThat makes keeping Watt in good health critical to the Steelers next season because they do not have much else at outside linebacker, a position that has been among the most important and produced more stars than any other over the franchise’s past 45 seasons. They did little to enhance that picture over the past three days of the draft after doing nothing to add to their thin group in free agency.\n\nThey waited until the sixth round, the 175th pick, to draft an undersized outside linebacker, Sutton Smith of Northern Illinois. They’re not even sure he’s an outside linebacker because they talked to him about possibly playing inside.\n\nBud Dupree, their other starting outside linebacker, will earn $9,232,000 in salary this season, the sixth-highest cap number on the Steelers. He has not produced in four seasons to justify that salary, yet they had little choice but to pick up his fifth-year option and guarantee it this year because of their shallow talent at the position. He had 5.5 sacks last season from the right side, the prime pass rushing position in their 3-4 defense. He had six the previous season, his first as a full-time starter.\n\nStill, they have talked fondly about Dupree much of this offseason and Keith Butler, their defensive coordinator and outside linebackers coach, did it again Saturday.\n\n“I like Bud,” Butler said. “Everybody questions Bud and all that stuff, but Bud’s going to be a good football player. There are some minute stuff we have to correct on him.”\n\nMaybe Dupree finally will have his breakout season, but there was little indication of that in his first four. If he does, it will be difficult for them to sign him back. Placing the franchise tag on him for 2020, when he would become an unrestricted free agent, would be prohibitive for them. It was over $15 million in 2019 and will grow next year.\n\nThe only other outside linebacker with experience on their roster is Anthony Chickillo, a career backup in his fifth season. He has nine starts in that span with seven sacks.\n\nThat’s pretty much it for Steelers with experience or resume at outside linebacker. It’s a long way from the days in which they churned out good to great players at the position — Joey Porter, Clark Haggans, Jason Gildon, LaMarr Woodley, Kevin Greene, Greg Lloyd and James Harrison. The Steelers always seem to be loaded at outside linebacker.\n\nNot any more. Watt, after just two seasons, belongs in that group of outstanding Steelers outside linebackers/pass-rushers. He had 20 sacks in his first two seasons, seven as a rookie then 13 in his second. That’s more than any Steelers player in his first two seasons in the NFL.\n\nIt’s good for them Watt has worked out so well because no one else has and they’ve done precious little to address it this year. Maybe they’re exhausted from trying so hard to find them after they drafted Watt (2017), Dupree (2015) and Jarvis Jones (2013) in the first round.\n\nBesides Watt, Dupree and Chickillo, the Steelers have two other possibilities at outside linebacker. Keion Adams, a seventh-round pick in 2017 from Western Michigan, spent his rookie season on injured reserve and last season on the practice squad. Ola Adeniyi, undrafted from Toledo last year, opened his rookie season on injured reserve and then played in one game.\n\n“We have Ola,’’ Butler declared. “I think he’s going to be a good player for us. I’m encouraged by what I’ve seen from him.”\n\nThey also talked up that sixth-round draft pick, Smith, whose 15 sacks last season at Northern Illinois helped him earn the Mid-American Conference defensive player of the year. He is typical of how they drafted some of their outside linebackers in the past — 4-3 college defensive ends who took time to convert to the new position.\n\n“We’re excited about his special team capability,” Mike Tomlin said. “This is a conversion guy, a guy who played defensive end.”\n\nIn other words, he won’t provide much help at outside linebacker in 2019 as he learns to play there.\n\nThe Steelers believe they addressed their biggest need in this draft on the first day when they traded up to select inside linebacker Devin Bush with the 10th overall pick. After that, they moved to stock other areas of need at wide receiver, cornerback, running back and tight end, not a one a candidate to start. They surely needed all that for position depth.\n\nThey also needed to attend to their lack of talent after Watt at outside linebacker. That the Steelers basically failed to do so makes Watt the guy on defense they can least afford to lose.\n\n(Photo: Philip G. Pavely / USA Today)"
