        "text": "Earlier this week, Dr. Doris Haggans was at the Community Pet Hospital in Long Beach, tending to the needs of dogs and cats.\n\nOn Thursday, she flew to Tampa.\n\nOn Sunday, she will among the 72,500 people in the stands at Raymond James Stadium observing Super Bowl XLIII between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Arizona Cardinals.\n\nShe will be rooting passionately for the Cardinals.\n\nYet, on Feb 5, 2006, she was among the 68,206 at Ford Field in Detroit observing Super Bowl XL between the Steelers and Seattle Seahawks – and she was rooting passionately for the Steelers.\n\nShe has switched allegiance because her son, Clark Haggans, is now a member of the Cardinals after playing eight seasons with the Steelers.\n\nHaggans, a 1995 graduate of Palos Verdes’ Peninsula High School, was a starting linebacker for the Steelers during their 21-10 win over the Seahawks, had five solo tackles and recorded a sack.\n\n“Clark played a great game,” says Doris Haggans with matriarchal pride.\n\nUnfortunately, Clark Haggans won’t have an opportunity to repeat such a Super Bowl performance against his former team because he will be standing on the Cardinals’ sidelines in civilian clothes.\n\nHe was placed on IR (injured reserve) on Dec. 19 after re-aggravating a foot injury in the Cardinals’ 11th game of the season against the New York Giants – he was diagnosed with a Lisfranc sprain – and has not been able to participate in his team’s dramatic playoff journey to the Super Bowl.\n\n“It’s broken Clark’s heart that he’s been unable to be out there,” says Doris Haggans. “But at least he’ll be there with his teammates cheering them on.”\n\nAnd so will his mother, who said the other day, “I wouldn’t miss this game for anything. After all, the Cardinals are my son’s team.”\n\nIt’s not that surprising that the 6-foot-4, 245-pound Haggans wound up making it in such a tough profession, since his late father, Dr. Ollie Haggans, also a veterinarian, was a one-time football star at Florida A&M and since his mother is a strong-willed person who has overcome daunting barriers herself in her life.\n\nIndeed, there weren’t many female veterinarians around the country when Doris Haggans completed her studies in the field at the famed Tuskegee University in 1971, especially African-American ones.\n\n“There just weren’t a lot of women in veterinarian work in those days, and definitely not many women of color,” says Haggans.\n\nDoris Haggans, 67, grew up in Washington D.C., the only child of Moses and Louise Mack.\n\nHer father was a well-known figure in the African-American community, a successful businessman who owned a billiards parlor and a popular eating and drinking hangout called the Stage Door, which was located across the street from the famed Howard Theatre.\n\n“All the top black entertainers played at the Howard, and I got to know all of them,” relates Haggans. “They used to come into my dad’s restaurant all the time. I used to call Louie Armstrong `Uncle Satchmo.’ I knew Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Billy Eckstine, Ella Fitzgerald, Pearl Bailey and so many others.”\n\nHaggans attended both Michigan State and Howard University, and majored in zoology.\n\n“I knew I was going to go into the medical field, and thought about becoming a pediatrician,” she says. “But I figured being around crying babies every day would become a little tiresome.”\n\nSo Doris Haggans eventually decided to become a veterinarian, applied both at the University of Pennsylvania and Tuskegee, and chose the Alabama institution when she was informed by Penn officials that she would have to wait a year for admission.\n\n“Actually, I wanted to go to Penn because it was close to my family, but I wanted to get started with my studies,” says Haggans, who spends most of her weekends at her residence in Las Vegas.\n\nShe met Ollie Haggans at Tuskegee, and they got married in 1968.\n\nThey soon moved to Southern California, settled in Harbor City, and opened several animal clinics, including ones in Seal Beach and Lomita.\n\nShe returned to Washington D.C. for President Barack Obama’s inaguration, attending also the Jan. 18 concert celebration at the Lincoln Memorial that inspired poignant memories.\n\n“I was about five rows back when Martin Luther King delivered his famous `I Have A Dream’ speech at the Lincoln Memorial,” referring to King’s Aug. 28, 1963 oration before a crowd of 250,000 in what was an historic political rally. “I’ll never forget it. It was an unbelievable event. And so was President Obama’s inaguration. It was tremendously exciting.”\n\nDoris Haggans is looking forward to being at another Super Bowl.\n\n“I know my son won’t be playing, but he’s still a member of the Cardinals,” she says. “He’ll be there cheering on his teammates. And I’ll be there cheering for them, too. …”\n\nI call him Dangerous Dave Benedict because, well, frankly he frightens me, as he’s a burly fellow – he must spread 240 over his 5-10 frame – who I hear was a rugged linebacker at some obscure university in Utah whose name escapes my memory.\n\nHe evinces an aura of intimidation despite a deceptively soft smile, and, although he’s a marketing guy and athletic fund-raiser extraordinaire at Long Beach State, I’ve long felt he’s been a de facto bodyguard for the school’s illustrious athletic director, Vivacious Vic Cegles.\n\nI found out first hand the other evening at Mahe that Mr. Benedict has still another chore in his growing list of duties – controlling my editorial content!\n\n“Why do you keep writing about Dan Monson leaving Long Beach State?” he asked angrily, eyes blazing. “Don’t you realize that hurts our recruiting. Why would you want to do that? Will you please stop it!”\n\nGee, I never realized speculating on Monson’s future, which I naively thought was a legitimate angle, would cause Dangerous Dave Benedict such distress.\n\nMr. Benedict said a few other things not printable in a family newspaper, but I got the message.\n\nFrom now on when I write anything on Long Beach State, I think I’m going to run the copy past Dangerous Dave Benedict for approval. …\n\nAfter watching the Lakers’ listless meltdown Tuesday night against lowly Charlotte at Staples Center, I’ve come to the conclusion this team doesn’t have enough players with enough strong hearts to win an NBA title. …\n\nYou take Kobe Bryant away from the Lakers, and I doubt they’d be better than a .500 team, if that. …\n\nAfter watching Sugar Shane Mosley methodically tear apart Antonio Margarito last Saturday night – he wound up scoring a savage ninth round knockout – I’m still trying to figure out why Oscar De La Hoya has a statue in front of Staples Center and Mosley doesn’t.\n\nAfter all, in Mosley’s four appearances at the Los Angeles arena, he now has KO victories over Margarito, Fernando Vargas and Ricardo Mayorga and a decisive victory over, yes, Oscar De La Hoya in what was De La Hoya’s only Staples appearance.\n\nWhile De La Hoya has been a formidable gate attraction and has had his share of ring successes – he has six world titles of the various alphabet groups to his credit – his legacy forever will be tarnished by the fact he’s lost every big showdown he’s ever been in except for the one against Vargas, who was a shell of his former self when he fought De La Hoya.\n\nDe La Hoya simply never has been able to dispense the kind of overpowering performance that Mosley did against an opponent the caliber of Margarito.\n\nIn fact, De La Hoya even ducked facing Margarito, instead deciding to take on a guy half his size, Manny Pacquiao – and we all know how that turned out. …\n\nAt least Antonio Margarito refused to quit and, true to the violent code of his sport, gamely accepted his punishment against Mosley, something De La Hoya chose not to do against either Pacquiao or Bernard Hopkins, or even Felix Trinidad. …\n\nThe Southern Wines & Spirits bigwig from Long Beach, Bernie (The Prince of Tabs) Selmanson, is taking the usual contingent of 18 to the Super Bowl, but, sadly, Dancing Barry Clifford once again failed to make the cut. …\n\nAs has become his annual custom, John Baker, Downey High assistant principal and overseer of the school’s Hall of Fame, has e-mailed an HOF application for me to give to my Pool Guy, Paul (Paulie Ducks) Grieco, celebrated here as The World’s Laziest Man.\n\nNo doubt Paulie Ducks – he’s long been adept at ducking process servers – would give quite a moving speech for receiving such an honor, as I’m sure he would cite that legendary NBA laggard, Benoit Benjamin, as being one of his inspirations.\n\nHonestly, the Downey High graduate holds the distinction of once remaining in a stationary position halfway up a malfunctioning escalator, refusing to walk up it on his own power until a repairman was summoned to fix it. …\n\nEver notice how humankind more often rewards appearances of merit than merit itself.\n\nThe wise guys will tell you the Super Bowl game is a sucker bet. But what bet isn’t?. …"
