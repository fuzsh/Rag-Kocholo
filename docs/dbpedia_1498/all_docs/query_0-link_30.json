        "text": "For a team to make the playoffs, a number of players must elevate their games.\n\nConversely, when a team doesn’t meet all its goals, there must be some players who fell short of expectations.\n\nAnd for the 31 NFL teams that ultimately fail to win the Super Bowl, they’ll look for new ways to improve next year.\n\nWith all that in mind, Times pro football beat writer Mike Bires takes a look at the Steelers who overachieved and underachieved this year, as well as a preview of players to get excited about once the 2008 season kicks off.\n\nEXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS\n\nJAMES HARRISON: In training camp, Harrison said he had no doubts that he’d capably fill the void created by Joey Porter’s departure. But not even he could have expected to play right outside linebacker as well as he did. By leading the team with 8.5 sacks, 11 other QB hits and six forced fumbles, he earned team MVP honors and a trip to Hawaii for the Pro Bowl.\n\nHEATH MILLER: The Steelers’ No. 1 pick in the ’05 draft just keeps getting better. During the regular season, he caught 47 passes for 566 yards and seven touchdowns, all career highs. In Saturday’s 31-29 playoff loss to Jacksonville, Miller caught a career-high eight passes for 85 yards and a TD. Combine his pass catching skills with an ability to block effectively, and it’s easy to see why he’s on the fast track to becoming the Steelers’ best tight end ever.\n\nDESHEA TOWNSEND: Going into the season, some media speculated that Bryant McFadden, a third-year pro taken in second round of the ’05 draft, would take away Townsend’s starting job at right cornerback. After all, Townsend was a 10th-year pro who celebrated his 32nd birthday a day before the season opener. But Townsend seemed to improve with age. He’s still a better-than-average cover corner who started every game this season.\n\nBEN ROETHLISBERGER: A strong candidate for Comeback Player of the Year honors, Roethlisberger rebounded from his nightmarish ’06 season by setting team records for most TDs passes in a season (32) and highest single-season passer rating (104.1). Unfortunately, his record-setting season ended on a sour note when he threw three interceptions in the wild-card loss to the Jaguars. But without Roethlisberger’s performance, the Steelers wouldn’t have made the playoffs.\n\nJEFF REED: Consistency and productivity is what teams want most from kickers, and that’s exactly what the Steelers got from Reed. He connected on 23 of 25 field goal attempts for a career-high success rate of 92.0 percent. His only misses were a 65-yarder in Denver on the last play of the first half, and a 44-yarder in a Nov. 26 rainstorm that turned Heinz Field into a swampland. But Reed did boot a 24-yarder with 17 seconds left to give the Steelers a 3-0 win over the Dolphins.\n\nMOST DISAPPOINTING\n\nTROY POLAMALU: It would be unfair to say the star strong safety had a bad year. But for a guy who’s the highest-paid Steeler ever, Polamalu didn’t make the kind of impact he’s had in the past. His selection to his fourth-straight Pro Bowl came more on reputation than production. Yes, Polamalu did miss five games due to injury. But the bottom line is that he had no interceptions, no sacks and hardly any “splash” plays that he’s routinely made in the past.\n\nBRETT KEISEL: One of the Steelers’ most disappointing defensive stats is Keisel’s in the sack department (2). Two years ago as Kimo von Oelhoffen’s backup at right defensive end, Keisel recorded three sacks. Last year when he moved into the starting lineup, he recorded 5.5 sacks. This year, the Steelers hoped Keisel would develop into one of the league’s most menacing pass rushers. He may have led the team with 23 QB pressures, but still, he didn’t put opposing quarterbacks on their back often enough.\n\nSEAN MAHAN: Ray Mansfield. Mike Webster. Dermontti Dawson. Jeff Hartings. Those four men were responsible for a legacy of fine play at center for the Steelers since the early 1970s. But this year, the chain was broken. Mahan, acquired via free agency to replace Hartings, was clearly the weakest link on a beleaguered offensive line. Already, there’s speculation that right guard Kendall Simmons will move to center next season.\n\nCLARK HAGGANS: If Haggans was using 2007 as an audition to attract suitors in March when he’s eligible for free agency, he didn’t perform very well at left outside linebacker. When the Steelers went to the Super Bowl two years ago, he finished second on the team with nine sacks. Last year, he had six. This year, he had only four. It’s highly unlikely the Steelers will re-sign him.\n\nALLEN ROSSUM: When Rossum returned a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown in the second game of the year, the move to trade for him just days before the season opener looked like a stroke of genius. But his longest kickoff return after that went for just 34 yards. He finished the season ranked 24th in the NFL with a 23.3 yard average on kickoff returns and 21st with a 6.4 yard punt return average. The bottom line is that Rossum’s return game didn’t do much to jumpstart the offense.\n\nWATCH NEXT YEAR\n\nLaMARR WOODLEY: The Steelers’ second-round pick in this year’s draft didn’t start a game this year, and, in fact, missed three games with a hamstring pull. Still, Woodley, Haggans’ back-up, matched Haggans with four sacks. Coach Mike Tomin probably already has Woodley penciled in as a starter for next year. In Saturday night’s wild-card game, the Steelers and Jaguars combined for 10 sacks. Woodley was the only defender with two.\n\nLAWRENCE TIMMONS: It’s been a long time since a Steelers’ No. 1 draft pick was such a non-factor as Timmons. But before anyone starts comparing Timmons to Jamain Stephens, a bust taken in the first round of the 1996 draft, remember that the tackle is only 21 and that he missed most of training camp with a groin pull. Timmons rarely played on defense this year (he played primarily on special teams). But next season, he’ll challenge Larry Foote for the starting job at right inside linebacker.\n\nANTHONY SMITH: Despite his bone-head prediction that the Steelers would beat New England and his poor play in that 34-13 loss to the mighty Patriots, Smith still has a bright future. He’s an athletic, hard-hitting safety who just needs to mature mentally. Who knows how well Ryan Clark will be able to play next season after missing most of this year with a spleen ailment? But even if Clark does return, there’s room in the Steelers’ secondary for Smith, whose best football is ahead of him.\n\nSANTONIO HOLMES: If not for missing three games with hamstring and ankle injuries, Holmes would have become only the sixth Steeler to ever go over 1,000 receiving yards in a season (Buddy Dial, Roy Jefferson, John Stallworth, Yancey Thigpen and Hines Ward are the others). But with 52 catches for 945 yards and seven TDs, Holmes showed why the Steelers picked him in the first round of the ’06 draft. He’s a speed burner who’s easily the Steelers’ most lethal deep threat. He led all NFL starting wide receivers with an average of 18.2 yards per catch."
