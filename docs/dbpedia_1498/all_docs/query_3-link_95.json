        "text": "Last Sunday saw a resurgent James Harrison have a very nice game. 7 tackles, 2 for loss, 3 sacks, 3 QB hits and a pass defensed on 37 defensive snaps. Jarvis Jones also had a “decent game”. He had a timely early interception that turned the tide of the game back in the Steelers favor. He also had 3 “almost sacks” where he missed getting the sack by less than a second.\n\nI was a long time defender of Jones but I have run out of patience waiting for him to develop. My expectation now is that Jones ceiling is in the Clark Haggans/Carlos Emmons level of achievement and that he will never be a highly effective pass rusher. He’s just a guy. Not a bust, but not what you expect from a 1st rounder.\n\nThe Colts offensive line wasn’t good to begin with. When you subtract their best O linemen in Costanzo and Thornton, start a backup center in Holmes and move Reitz, a natural right tackle, over to start on the left for Costanzo,… Well, let’s just say you’re setting Matt Hasselbeck up for a long, hard day, And, that’s what he got; sacked twice, hit 8 times, forced into several errant throws, two of which were intercepted. Now we get to the part that no one wants to hear or, in this case, read.\n\nHarrison, as much as we all love the guy is way, way past his prime. His stats on Sunday night are more a reflection of the state of the Colts’ offensive line than they are a reflection of his once great abilities. Craig Wolfley noted on Tuesday,\n\n“He was back there holding AARP meetings with Frank Gore and Matt Hasselbeck.”\n\nThe Colts are not a good team. They’re not awful, but not good either. The Steelers dominance of them should be viewed in that context.\n\nAs for Jarvis Jones; the thing that separates the great pass rushers from the mediocre ones is the ability to bend that edge and get there a half second earlier, maybe even a full second versus a guy like Reitz. A 2008 vintage James Harrison would have broken the single game record for sacks against the Colts on Sunday. Jarvis just doesn’t have that kind of ability, not even close.\n\nThe Steelers are going to have to use another high draft choice on a right side Edge player, again next year.\n\nThey are also going to have a tough decision when it comes to whether or not to bring back a 38 year old outside linebacker, who has been a really valuable player and locker room presence, and is also at the end of his career; when they desperately need to develop young talent for the long term good of the team. There are only so many snaps to divvy out per game.\n\nEvery one that you give to a guy close to the end of the line stunts the development of a young player who could play a role in the future of the team by one snap. When you do that over the course of a season, guys like Anthony Chickillo, and whoever they draft next year, don’t develop quickly.\n\nPhoto Credit: AP Gene J. Puskar"
