        "text": "The linebacking corps of the Pittsburgh Steelers is known as the best in the NFL. Over the years, there have been people like Jack Lambert, Jack Ham, Kevin Green, Greg Lloyd, and the list goes on and on.\n\nThis year's group could be the best ever. How often is it that a team releases one of their starters and it is considered an upgrade?\n\nJames Harrison, OLB\n\nIn 2008, James Harrison became the first undrafted free agent to win the Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nDrafted out of Kent State (the same college that Jack Lambert attended), Harrison did not have an immediate impact.\n\nHarrison was signed as a rookie free agent in 2002. He spent 2002 and 2003 on the Steelers' practice squad.\n\nIn 2004, Harrison was signed by the Baltimore Ravens, and allocated to the Rhein Fire of the now defunct NFL Europe. After returning, he was released by the Ravens.\n\nHarrison was ready to walk away from his NFL dream at the age of 26.\n\nA freak weightlifting accident by Clark Haggans caused Bill Cowher to once again call Harrison, and Harrison decided to give it one more shot.\n\nHarrison played mostly on special teams that year, but did play spot duty, recording one start when Joey Porter was ejected before a game against the Cleveland Browns.\n\nIn 2007, after the release of Joey Porter, Harrison filled his shoes. Harrison had 8.5 sacks, 98 tackles, and seven forced fumbles. Harrison was named team MVP.\n\nDuring the 2008 season, Harrison etched his name in the Steelers' record book, recording a team record 16 sacks on his way to earning Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nHarrison was rewarded this offseason with a six-year, $51 million contract, the second largest contract in Steelers' history (second to Ben Roethlisberger's eight years, $101 million).\n\nJames Farrior, ILB\n\nJames Farrior came to the Steelers as one of the few free agents that the Steelers sign from other teams.\n\nHe's originally a first round draft pick of the New York Jets in 1997 (eighth overall) out of the University of Virginia.\n\nFarrior immediately became a starter, and has led the team in tackles almost every year.\n\nHe was rewarded in August 2008 with a new contract that will pay him $18.25 million over five years.\n\nLawrence Timmons, ILB\n\nHe was drafted in the first round (15 overall) out of Florida State University. Until this upcoming season, Timmons was the backup at all four of the linebacker spots.\n\nHe also played in the Nickel and Dime formations because of his speed and coverage ability.\n\nLarry Foote realized that Timmons was going to be taking his starting job this year, so he asked for and was granted his release.\n\nLaMarr Woodley, OLB\n\nWoodley's 2008 season is what many people would call his breakout year. Teaming with James Harrison, Woodley set a Steelers record for 27.5 sacks between them, the most in Steelers' history.\n\nWoodley is also the only player in NFL history to amass two sacks per game in his first four playoff games.\n\nIn Mike Tomlin's first draft, his first two selections were Timmons and Woodley. That could go down as the Steelers' best draft class in the last 20 years.\n\nThe Backups\n\nKeyaron Fox, ILB\n\nFox came to the Steelers as a free agent from the Kansas City Chiefs. He plays mostly on special teams, and is expected to be the primary backup this year to Farrior and Timmons.\n\nAndre Frazier, OLB\n\nHe has spent a couple years on the practice squad, and has also played on special teams.\n\nFrazier Patrick Bailey, OLB\n\nBailey comes to the Steelers as an undrafted free agent out of Duke.\n\nBruce Davis, OLB\n\nHe played defensive end at UCLA, and spent last year learning the new position.\n\nArnold Harrison, OLB\n\nArnold is in his fifth year; he spent the first two on the Steelers' practice squad.\n\nTom Korte, LB\n\nHe's an undrafted rookie free agent. He will be in the practice squad if he even makes it that far.\n\nDonovan Woods, LB\n\nHe was signed prior to 2008 as a rookie free agent out of Oklahoma St. He played safety and quarterback in college, and spent last year on the practice squad, while trying to switch positions.\n\nThe Outlook\n\nOur starters, as always, are set. All four of them have the potential to be in the Pro Bowl this year.\n\nJames Harrison is 31 years old, but did not really receive much playing time until two years ago; he has the wear and tear of a 27-year-old.\n\nTimmons is 23 years old, and is just stepping into his own on the football field. Look for him to become a monster now that he is the starter.\n\nLaMarr Woodley is another beast on the rise. He plays the best in the big game, and is the perfect complement to Harrison on the other side.\n\nJames Farrior is really the only question mark going forward. He is 34 and only has another year or two before his skills start diminishing.\n\nNow it's time to mold the next great player."
