        "text": "Football (pre) season is here!\n\nThe countdown to Aug. 31 and Texas is on for the Colorado State football team and its fans.\n\nThis 2024 season feels very important for a variety of reasons (that we'll discuss more in depth as the season approaches) and fans have a lot of questions about the roster.\n\nThe Rams hit the field Friday for the first preseason practice. Let's jump into a deep dive of reader questions about the 2024 Rams!\n\nMost interesting position battle entering camp? (@TaylorDesch)\n\nA lot of questions about position battles, understandably so. As it should be in Year 3 under coach Jay Norvell, CSU has most positions solidified in who will start. That said, there are some interesting showdowns.\n\nThere are a number of qualified running backs who could lay a stake for significant carries. Tight end is one to watch, as is offensive guard. Defensively, cornerbacks and D-line rotation are key.\n\nMore on most of these below.\n\nWhat will the Running back rotation look like, it seems like we have a few pretty capable backs. (@DylanCarabajal1)\n\nAs promised, running back talk. Kobe Johnson has more than 2,500 career yards and is back after an injury last season. Norvell is very loyal to Avery Morrow. Justin Marshall was a revelation late last season and changed the offense in the final three games as a true freshman. Norvell has spoken highly of Damian Henderson, now a redshirt freshman.\n\nJalen Dupree was arguably the best player in Arkansas in high school last season. Norvell has made it clear he feels it takes some time for freshmen to acclimate to college at running back, but Dupree will aim to crack the rotation. Don’t forget about Keegan Holles, either, who looked very fast in spring coming off an ACL.\n\nSo, that is a deep, deep room. Not enough carries for everyone. I think Marshall is the starter to begin camp, Johnson is the versatile back for all situations, and Henderson and Morrow are the short yardage backs. This is a group that could shuffle and shift all season long.\n\nThe Week 1 starting WR that will line up next to Horton and (Dylan) Goffney? Expectations for Jaxxon Warren? (@CFFNate)\n\nHow we looking at TE? (@daddoboddins)\n\nCSU’s third starting receiver (Goffney will be in the slot) will be in a transfer in Armani Winfield (Baylor) or Donovan Ollie (Cincinnati), I expect. Jordan Ross, Caleb Goodie and Jamari Person are all in the mix.\n\nNow, to tight end.\n\nCSU must replace a Mackey Award finalist in Dallin Holker (now with the New Orleans Saints). The staff has mentioned former Nevada star Cole Turner (now with the Washington Commanders) as a comparison for Jaxxon Warren, the JuCo transfer CSU added this offseason.\n\nBut Warren has never played a down of FBS ball and is a year into his time as a tight end (he’s a former quarterback). He is a superb athlete and I think will play an important role, but I’m not about to put “match Holker” expectations on him.\n\nMason Muaau, Vince Brown and Jordan Williams all have experience at the position in the offense, but none have claimed the spot. This is a vital position battle to watch. A good tight end option opens up this offense.\n\nHow much playing time do you expect Jordan Ross to see year 1? (@____ian_______)\n\nHere’s a hint at the potential of Jordan Ross, one of the highest rated recruits in program history. Both Norvell and safety Jack Howell made unprompted remarks of praise about the receiver when I talked to them at Mountain West media days.\n\n“Jordan Ross, he’s the real deal,” Howell told me. “Sometimes you get some big names and you kind of question it, but Jordan Ross is really good.”\n\n“We have a young freshman named Jordan Ross, and it’s probably the last time I’m going to have to remind you what his name is. He’s pretty special,” Norvell said.\n\nSo, don’t expect 100 targets, but it seems like he may get in the mix. At Nevada, Norvell had a package of plays for a youngster named Tory Horton as a true freshman. Ross could be on a similar path.\n\nWhich, if any, freshman do you see having the biggest impact this fall?\n\nAny early thoughts on who the most improved player will be?\n\nIf you could take any former Ram and put them on this team, who would it be? (@terrytortellini)\n\nIt’s hard to guess on freshmen until we see some of camp. Some candidates include Ross and Chauncey Davis (DB) to name a couple. Receivers, DB’s and linebackers are always special teams candidates.\n\nLikewise, it’s pretty tough to guess most improved before camp but CSU is hoping it’s Brayden Fowler-Nicolosi. He has the ability to jump from good but inconsistent to electric at QB. Norvell has talked highly of his growth in understanding of the game.\n\nA former Ram to this team? Wow that’s a good, fun question. There are a few ways to go. You could simply pick one of the best ever or go for a position of need. How about one of Joey Porter or the late Clark Haggans? CSU’s pass rush is a bit of a question mark (more on that below) and one of those guys could help really boost the defense.\n\nEDITOR NOTE: OK, so I sent this story in for an edit. My boss, David Dishman, sent a message back that, in summary, said \"wrong answer. The correct choice is BVP.\" Well, I hate to admit it, but that is quite accurate. In a year where the Rams host Colorado, how could I not go straight to Mr. Helmet Spike himself?? Yes, CSU is well set at QB with Fowler-Nicolosi, but throwing Bradlee Van Pelt's energy into the cauldron of this Showdown would be can't miss stuff. So, after a useful edit, BVP is the pick.\n\nCB concerns me…is this the position group that most needs to step up this fall? *Can’t imagine the pass rush will be better w/o Mo (Kamara) (@jdncarlsbad)\n\nYeah, I agree that cornerback might be the position to watch. Dom Jones is the lone returner with experience at CSU. Isaiah Essissima (Nevada) and Elias Larry (Navy) come in with experience at other FBS programs. But CSU was torched on big plays, especially at key times last year. That group must step up and their success (or lack of it) is the most important thing for the defense this year.\n\nPass rush will definitely be different. Don’t expect one person to match Kamara’s sack total. The group doesn’t have to be better than last year, but good by committee. Nuer Gatkuoth will get the first chances to be lined up against the weak link in the offensive line and he’ll have to take advantage. How the pass rush does also has an impact on the defensive back play.\n\nThere are veterans in the interior that should help the DL be sturdy inside.\n\nDoes it look like Aaron Karas and Tanner Morley are going to be bigger rotational pieces? And, that we know of, are there any in-state targets this year for recruiting? (@RockyShackleto1)\n\nKaras (redshirt sophomore) and Morley (redshirt freshman) are both in the mix at guard positions and both will be in the offensive line rotation and probably at least one will be a starter. Offensive line coach Bill Best is excited about both.\n\nThere’s no one committed in the 2025 class from Colorado yet, but I’m sure there will be. I want to peek ahead to 2026, though, with a couple of names to know. Big offensive lineman Mason Bandhauer goes to Fort Collins High School. A staffer at FCHS said to me when Bandhauer was a freshman something along the lines of “CSU needs to offer early, because everyone will be coming for him.”\n\nCSU did and the big schools are on him. Bandhauer has offers from Nebraska, Iowa State, Mississippi State, Kansas and a bunch of others. He’s currently the No. 2 player in Colorado in that class. CSU was his first offer.\n\nAnother local lineman in that class is Windsor’s Deacon Schmitt, who has offers from a bunch of big dogs as well in Nebraska, Oklahoma State, Oklahoma and more. CSU also offered him long ago.\n\nCan the Rams pull a huge NoCo win with either? Will be interesting.\n\nWith the continued radical restructuring of college football, is it critical for CSU, now more than ever, to win...now...to keep a place at the table (@ChristopherNo41)\n\nIt was critical last year and the year before and the year before and the … you get the point.\n\nYes, CSU needs to get football going. It is athletics priority No. 1 for Amy Parsons and John Weber. Football must win. With seven home games and the Rocky Mountain Showdown, tons of eyes are on this program.\n\nWhat keys factors are going to get CSU over the hump and win a bowl game? (@Coach_CPrest)\n\nIt’s very coach-speak to say, but consistency. CSU’s offense was at times electric last year, but at times disastrous. The defense made some huge plays but gave up far too many huge plays.\n\nEven everything out a bit and it gets the Rams into bowl territory.\n\nRank the road trips this year from best to Nevada (@aarongharris)\n\nShots fired at Reno! I’ll split this into two rankings — one based on solely the football game and one on the overall potential of the road game experience.\n\nFootball only:\n\nOregon State\n\nFresno State\n\nAir Force\n\nNevada\n\nTexas\n\nNote: Fresno State could be top here. If CSU wants to make it a very good season, that’s a game to try and steal. Plus, Horton will be VERY motivated in his homecoming. Oregon State has had so much change that this matchup gets very intriguing. Texas will be a fun trip for fans (will discuss below) but as a football game likely won’t be competitive at all.\n\nRoad game vibes rankings:\n\nTexas\n\nOregon State\n\nFresno State\n\nNevada\n\nAir Force\n\nNote: Austin, a College Football Playoff team, huge stadium? This is fun as heck, even if the game may not be close. CSU was supposed to play at Oregon State in 2020 (then COVID hit), it’s a newly renovated stadium, potential future conference foe, cool area and team in flux. Vibes are high for that one. The Horton returns to Fresno plot will be amazing. Nevada has lost some luster with cranky Ken Wilson canned, but there’s still some percolating tension. CSU hasn’t won at Air Force since 2002, so CSU fan vibes are low on that one until it changes.\n\nBased on what you’ve seen so far, and based on our star power, do you think we can cover +36.5 against Texas? (@ColtonKirby880)\n\nA quick-hitter look at reasons CSU will cover that (that is not a promise, just an analysis of that side of the spread):\n\nWeek 1 of a schedule where Texas plans to play A LOT of games. Plus, Longhorns are at Michigan the next week. Texas will be happy to get up early and call off the dogs so they can rest.\n\nCSU has stars. Rams don’t have the overall quality and depth to win at Texas, but also not hard to see how BFN and Horton could connect a couple of times. Texas was 113th in FBS against the pass a year ago.\n\nCSU is much better to start Year 3 than they were to start Year 1 of Norvell era when the Rams were walloped at Michigan. This team is more prepared for this type of game.\n\nWeek 1 is weird. Stuff happens. Play is sloppy. That helps the underdog.\n\nWhy doesn’t CSU post behind the scenes YouTube videos like Boulder? We get minimal content and have a potential first rounder. (@chetbellytakes)\n\nAt the time of this question being asked (and me writing my answer), CSU’s camp hadn’t started while CU’s had, so there’s no behind the scenes content to be shown before players report. And I don’t think there’s going to be any shortage of Horton content this season.\n\nCSU always has inside camp videos and such. But, no, CSU nor any other program in college football show as much as CU with documentary crews following Deion Sanders and company around."
