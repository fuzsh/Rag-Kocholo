        "text": "The coroner has identified the cause of death for former Super Bowl champion and Colorado State Hall of Famer Clark Haggans. The Coloradoan reports the Larimer County Coroner determined Haggans died from complications tied to chronic alcohol use. Haggans was found dead in a Fort Collins home in June. The CSU linebacker still holds the school’s record for career sacks at 33. He’s played for the Steelers, the Cardinals, and the 49ers, reaching Super Bowls with all three teams. He won Super Bowl 40 with the Steelers and retired from football in 2013. Haggans was just 46 years old when he died."
