        "text": "Here are some of the latest news items from this morning, Wednesday, June 21:\n\nTwo-sport star to be honored by Pittsburgh\n\nA former star Pitt basketball player who went on to play in the NFL will be honored Saturday by the City of Pittsburgh with a celebration and the naming of a street, the university said Tuesday.\n\nPittsburgh City Council is expected to honor city native Sam Clancy on Wednesday by declaring Saturday as “Sam Clancy Day” in Pittsburgh.\n\nA street sign at the corner of Bedford Avenue and Roberts Street in Pittsburgh’s Hill District will be unveiled in Clancy’s honor. The ceremony will begin at 11:30 a.m. and feature an array of speakers, including Mayor Ed Gainey. There will be music and food trucks at the street-naming celebration.\n\nClancy, who grew up in the shadow of Pitt’s campus, initially starred at Fifth Avenue High School, leading the basketball team to a state championship as a junior in 1976. Following Fifth Avenue’s closure, he went to newly opened Brashear High and was a member of its first graduating class in 1977.\n\nClancy was a four-year basketball starter at Pitt from 1977-81. He is a member of Pitt’s Athletics Hall of Fame and Pitt’s All-Centennial Men’s Basketball Team.\n\nClancy played one season of professional basketball in the Continental Basketball Association before playing 12 seasons of professional football.\n\nHe was a member of the Seattle Seahawks and then returned to Pittsburgh to play for the Maulers of the short-lived United States Football League. He also played in the NFL for the Cleveland Browns and Indianapolis Colts.\n\nNorth Braddock police chief resigns\n\nThe North Braddock police chief has resigned in the wake of borough council not renewing his contract that was set to expire on June 30, according to Tribune-Review news partner WPXI-TV.\n\nNorth Braddock Council on Tuesday accepted the resignation of Issac Daniele, whose contract as chief of the department was not renewed.\n\nAll but one of the small borough’s police officers quit last month as the borough is considering joining a regional police force with East Pittsburgh and Rankin.\n\nPolice investigate shooting\n\nA man was hospitalized in stable condition Tuesday after being shot in the leg in Pittsburgh’s Troy Hill neighborhood, Pittsburgh police said.\n\nPolice said the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. in the 1700 block of Hatteras Street.\n\nOfficers found the man down in the street and they applied a tourniquet to the wound tol try to stop the bleeding until medics arrived. Medics took him to the hospital, police said.\n\nThe shooting is under investigation."
