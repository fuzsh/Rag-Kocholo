        "text": "A former Arizona Cardinals player from their Super Bowl has died. As reported by multiple people, pass rusher Clark Haggans died at 46 years old.\n\nHaggans played in the NFL from 2000-2012 and was a member of the Cardinals from 2008-2011.\n\nHaggans spent the first eight years of his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers after being drafted in the fifth round.\n\nHe joined the Cardinals as a free agent in 2008 and was a key leader in that Super Bowl team.\n\nIn 56 games over four seasons with the Cardinals, he had 14 sacks, 27 quarterback hits at 18 tackles for loss.\n\n46 years old is far too young to be gone.\n\nWe express condolences to all those who know him.\n\n[affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]"
