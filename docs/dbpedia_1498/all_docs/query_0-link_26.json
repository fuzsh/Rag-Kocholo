        "text": "PITTSBURGH(AP) – Outside linebacker Clark Haggans will sit out at least two games with a groin injury, becoming the eighth Pittsburgh Steelers regular to miss significant playing time this season. Haggans was injured early in the first quarter of Sunday’s 17-3 victory over the New York Jets and did not return. He was replaced mostly by James Harrison, a former rookie free agent who had four tackles and two assists, with 2003 second-round draft pick Alonzo Jackson also filling in.\n\nHarrison helped hold Jets star Curtis Martin to 72 yards on 24 carries, Martin’s lowest output in five games. Martin began the game as the NFL’s top rusher but has since dropped to No. 3.\n\nThe Steelers (12-1) are hopeful Haggans can return for their final regular season game Jan. 2 at Buffalo, but still aren’t certain how long he will be out. Inside linebacker Kendrell Bell has missed most of the season with two separate groin injuries.\n\nHarrison, undrafted out of Kent State in 2002, also had a strong game as an unexpected starter when outside linebacker Joey Porter was ejected Oct. 10 in Cleveland for fighting before the game.\n\n“He stepped in (Sunday), just like he did when Joey went down,” coach Bill Cowher said Monday. “He played solid. Hopefully, between him and Alonzo, they’ll step in and they’ll get the job done until Clark gets back.”\n\nHarrison has also been one of the Steelers’ top special teams players, and was credited with the initial stop on all six kicking plays Nov. 28 against Washington.\n\n“He has been a force,” Cowher said. “I told him (that day), “Every time I look up, you’re making a tackle.’ “\n\nJust as it seems that, despite an 11-game winning streak that matches the longest in franchise history, the Steelers keep losing another key regular every week.\n\nCornerback Chad Scott (seven games, knee), wide receiver Plaxico Burress (three games, hamstring) and Bell remain out, though Burress could return Saturday against the New York Giants (5-8).\n\nRunning back Duce Staley came back only last week after sitting out four games with a hamstring injury, and quarterback Tommy Maddox (thumb) was out nearly two months. Nose tackle Casey Hampton sustained a season-ending knee injury Oct. 17 in Dallas, and right guard Kendall Simmons was lost for the season with a training camp knee injury.\n\nDespite one of their most troublesome stretch of injuries during his 13-season tenure, Cowher said the Steelers have kept winning because they don’t expect any falloff in production just because a starter is hurt.\n\nBen Roethlisberger replaced Maddox on Sept. 19 in Baltimore and hasn’t given up the job, leading the Steelers on their longest winning streak in 30 seasons. Jerome Bettis filled in for Staley with four consecutive 100-yard games.\n\n“Confidence is one of those things that you certainly can ride,” Cowher said. “There’s a feeling certainly that exists right now that if we don’t beat ourselves, somewhere along the way we’ll have some playmakers that will make a play. And that’s just being patient, not forcing the game, not trying to do more than your own job and trusting the guys you have next to you.”"
