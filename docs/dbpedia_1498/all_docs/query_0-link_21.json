        "text": "SANTA CLARA -- Veteran outside linebackers Parys Haralson and Clark Haggans might not ever be on the same field together. But they both made it into the official 49ers team photo, which was shot Tuesday.As Haralson departs for the season -- he is on injured reserve after undergoing season-ending surgery for a torn triceps in his left arm -- Haggans is getting prepared to take his place.Haggans got in a workout around the lunch hour and still dripping with sweat, he put on his No. 51 jersey and went out to the practice field behind the 49ers' team complex for the team picture.REWIND: 49ers finalize deal with Clark Haggans\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals released Haggans, a 12-year pro, on Friday. The 49ers signed him to a contract on Sunday. The deal was announced Monday and he spoke with the media on Tuesday:\"Did you know the 49ers had a need at outside linebacker?\n\nHaggans: \"No idea. Happy to be here. I had no clue. Just right now, getting into the playbook and getting to know my teammates and my coaches and all that, and workout and routine.\"What was your impression of the 49ers, seeing them this season with this new regime?\n\nHaggans: \"They're a physical team, blue collar, work hard. All the success they had last year, obviously earned. And happy to be a part of it.On whether the 49ers fit his style:\n\nHaggans: \"In and out of the weight room. Running after practice. Film study. And try to play football with effort.\"What kind of adjustment is it for you?\n\nHaggans: \"The terminology is different. A lot of the techniques are the same. Just been here since Sunday in the class room with my coaches and coach Vic. So just trying to absorb as much as I can and be as spongy as possible, and take it from there.\"Haggans faces a possible NFL suspension after serving jail time in June, stemming from an April 2011 DUI in Arizona. In a statement issued through his agent, Jeff Sperbeck, Haggans said he had been drinking at a concert when he received an urgent phone call from his babysitter, who said his 5-year-old daughter was having trouble breathing. Unable to quickly find his wife, Haggans drove him. He was pulled over after running a red light. Sperbeck is scheduled to speak on Haggans' behalf during a hearing Wednesday with the NFL.\n\nHow much does the uncertainty over a possible NFL suspension weigh on your mind?\n\nHaggans: \"Right now, I'm just leaving it up to my agent and staying ready. Obviously, I'm going to play some time. Just leaving it up to my agent and see what happens from there, see what happens with the NFL and take it from there.\"Do you expect to play Sunday?\n\nHaggans: \"I don't know. I got my cell phone. It's on. I made sure I paid my bill. It works. When I get the news, either way, I just got to be ready for it.\"Will you talk to commissioner Roger Goodell?\n\nHaggans: \"My agent is on it right now. Right now, I'd just say I'm on a need-to-know basis to see what's going to transpire for the next hours to days up to, I don't know, the end of the month or so. As soon as I hear, I'll let you all know.\"Are you optimistic that the circumstances surrounding your DUI will work in your favor?\n\nHaggans: \"The circumstances were the circumstances. I had to do what I had to do as a father. It's on them. I'm not the one making the call. I'm the one who's got to be ready either way and be prepared.\"How do you expect to be used in the 49ers' scheme?\n\nHaggans: \"I'll find out today when we start practice. Be ready. It's unfortunate what happened to Parys. Wherever they see me playing, if they need me to long snap or kick, fill up the water bottles. . . \"What have you done in the past?\n\nHaggans: \"I was mostly on the left. Played the right. Earlier in career, play the right. You always. I've been back and forth. I've been in a 3-4 defense a long time. So a lot of the techniques are the same. Getting used to the terminology, my eyes and the footwork. I was fortunate to have had a training camp. So as far as being in game shape and all that, I'm still working toward that. I'm going to dive into the playbook as much as I can and take it from there.\"Does being a 12-year veteran help you adjust?\n\nHaggans: \"I hope so. There's a lot that's gone in, and I'm trying to take in as much as I can.\""
