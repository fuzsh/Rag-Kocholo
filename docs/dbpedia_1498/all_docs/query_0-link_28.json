        "text": "LATROBE — Verron Haynes is convinced the Steelers already have their replacement for retired running back Jerome Bettis.\n\nVerron Haynes.\n\nHaynes wants to replace Bettis as the goal-line running back, and hopes to get an edge over Duce Staley when the Super Bowl champions hold a Wednesday night practice at Latrobe High School, one of only two evening workouts during camp. The night practices usually feature an offense vs. defense goal-line drill in full pads that is as close as the Steelers get to game action during training camp.\n\nEach side is eager to win because it affords camp bragging rights, if only for a few days. Bettis often was the star of the drill, frequently using his size and quick feet to power into the end zone from inside the 5-yard line.\n\nHaynes has been used mostly as a third-down running back in recent seasons, but wants to prove to coach Bill Cowher that he can expand his role.\n\nWillie Parker is the returning starter following his 1,202-yard season, but often gets pulled when the Steelers get close to the goal line. Bettis had nine touchdowns on 110 carries last season, while Parker had four on 255 carries. Haynes had three touchdowns on 74 carries.\n\n\"I'm getting an opportunity to showcase what I can do, and it will be the first opportunity for me to show that,\" Haynes said. \"I've got something to prove. Basically, there's a void there with the absence of Jerome, and we're going to need everybody to pick it up and, personally, I thrive on that situation. It's not going to change on Wednesday. That's what I'm out there to do, compete and win this job. I want it.\"\n\nCowher hasn't identified a front-runner.\n\n\"Jerome had been the guy the last couple of years, but it's open competition right now,\" Cowher said Tuesday. \"That's a good group of guys, and a very unselfish group.\"\n\nThe Steelers will practice twice Wednesday on a day the high temperature might reach the mid-90s, but the usual afternoon session will be replaced by the night practice. They worked out once Tuesday, staying with a schedule that calls for single practices and two-a-days on an alternating basis until they play their first exhibition game, Aug. 12 at Arizona.\n\nWith a heat index of 99 degrees on their St. Vincent College practice fields, the Steelers even took a Popsicle break and didn't run after practice, as they often do.\n\nRookie offensive lineman Willie Colon and linebacker Clark Haggans jawed at each other after Haggans dislodged Colon's helmet during a blocking drill, but there were no other signs the players were bothered by the heat.\n\n\"You hit me, I'm going to hit you back, just like your mama told you to do,\" Colon said. \"It's nothing more than that, leave it on the field, it never goes to the locker room. I'll probably go give Clark a hug, give him a kiss, and it will be over with.\"\n\nThe offense looked to be more consistent than it was Monday, when the heat index was 97 degrees, but Cowher thought the overall play was spotty on the third day of practice.\n\n\"It was a little back and forth,\" he said. \"We're coming but it still takes time. It takes a good week, week and a half, before you can really start to get some kind of rhythm.\" Notes: WR Cedrick Wilson sat out the last half of practice with a sore right Achilles tendon, but the injury isn't believed to be serious. Not practicing were first-round draft pick Santonio Holmes, the wide receiver who developed a sore hamstring Monday; TE Jerame Tuman illness and C Chukky Okobi neck. ... Cowher likes how LB Joey Porter is progressing following arthroscopic knee surgery and may take him off the physically unable to perform list in a few days if he keeps improving. Porter has been working out on his own."
