        "text": "The Pittsburgh Steelers lost a member of their own on Tuesday. According to multiple sources, former Pittsburgh pass rusher Clark Haggans has died at the age of 46.\n\nHaggans was a fifth-round pick out of Colorado State by the Steelers in 2000 and a member of the 2006 Super Bowl XL championship team. During his time with the team he anchored the outside with Joey Porter after Jason Gildonâ€™s departure from the team. When James Harrison took over for Porter, it was LaMarr Woodley who ultimately resulted in Haggans leaving Pittsburgh to play for the Arizona Cardinals. Following his stint with Arizona, Haggans played one season for the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nHaggans hung up the cleats and retired in 2013. He finished his Steelers career with 332 tackles and 32.5 sacks.\n\nThe cause of his death has not been reported at this time.\n\nHaggans leaves a son and daughter behind. Out condolences go out to the Haggans family, and all of the Steelers players, coaches and personnel who knew Haggans well and are impacted by his untimely passing."
