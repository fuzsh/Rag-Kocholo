        "text": "From the notebook of a sportswriter who asks that you give your little brother a hug today:\n\n* Tight ends coach Alfredo Roberts, in praising Connor Heyward this spring, called him \"everyone's little brother.\"\n\n* He was exciting every time he touched the ball, and that made everyone smile. But that's not the context in which I'm thinking right now. I'm thinking about the late Clark Haggans, everyone's little brother here at the turn of the century.\n\n* Clark was more like that middle child who didn't get the attention he deserved. That kind of little brother.\n\n* First, he was Joey Porter's little brother.\n\n* Porter had been drafted out of Colorado State in 1999. He and Haggans had been roommates and bookends. Porter had moved from H-back to defensive end as a junior, and as a senior tied the school record with 15 sacks. He was the Steelers' third-round pick the following spring.\n\n* \"Little brother\" Clark - nicknamed \"Kramer\" at the time because of his hairstyle - remains Colorado State's all-time career sacks leader with 33. He was drafted the following year by the Steelers in the fifth round.\n\n* Haggans and Porter were a fun story in Latrobe that summer as Haggans told Porter stories whenever he could. On the year they combined for 28 sacks in college: “I’d been there for a while,\" Haggans said, \"so at first they doubled me, but Joey kept coming free. It came to the point where they had to single-block us, and one of us got to the quarterback or ran into each other on just about every pass play.”\n\n* Haggans also said he had a funny story about a UTEP running back - subject of Joey's non-stop trash talking that day - who got up and punched Porter in the gut while he was preening post-tackle. Porter went to the ground doubled over and walked off the field for a play.\n\n* And, what came of it? “That’s it,” Haggans said. “I guess it’s not that funny. It was kind of odd though.”\n\n* Porter was the slick 4.5-40 pass-rusher with big-time promise, while Haggans was a 5.0-40 guy who was the consummate overachiever. Porter admired Haggans' motor, and Haggans showed up as a rookie with 17 preseason tackles, second on the team.\n\n“I used to wonder how a guy had that much energy all the time,\" Porter said at the time. \"He was a guy the coaches would use as an example. He’d be down the field on 50-yard plays, never stopped. He’s gone a long way by doing that.”\n\n* Ever humble, Haggans said of his productive rookie preseason only that he had no idea what he was doing. “I just figured, when in doubt, just try to get the guy with the ball down before he gets to the end zone,” he said with a shrug.\n\n* The next season, as Porter moved into the starting lineup, Haggans became the Steelers' special-teams tackles leader with 23. And in 2002, against the Raiders, when Haggans recorded two sacks for the first time, Porter became the first NFL player ever to record 3 sacks and 2 interceptions in one game.\n\n* It wasn't just Porter overshadowing Haggans. The latter was also \"little brother\" of the team's then all-time sacks leader Jason Gildon. I was one of several calling for Bill Cowher to start Haggans over Gildon in 2003, but Cowher had drafted Alonzo Jackson in the second round that year and gave him time whenever he could.\n\n* Right before that 2003 season got underway, Porter and Haggans went back to Colorado to watch their school play. They went to a bar in Denver afterward and a riot erupted. Porter was shot in the rear end as the two ran from the scene.\n\n* Haggans replaced Porter the first two games that season. He forced a fumble, recorded a sack and defended a pass, but didn't start again that season. Not only was Gildon starting, Jackson and Erik Flowers were in the rotation.\n\n* Flowers, of course, is infamous for getting another OLB, James Harrison, cut that year. The move angers Porter to this day, but all Haggans wanted was to break out from behind the shadows.\n\n* He did in 2004. And probably only because Cowher failed in a valiant attempt to sign free agent Marcus Washington. When that deal fell through, the Steelers re-signed Haggans and gave him the job.\n\n* And then Haggans broke his hand in July trying to re-rack a heavy dumbbell. It was the move that forced Cowher to re-sign Harrison, who was still behind fifth-round rookie Nathaniel Adibi and undrafted free agent Dedrick Roper. Then the Steelers signed another former Colorado State OLB, Adrian Ross, Haggans' bookend at CSU prior to Porter's position change.\n\n* Haggans, like the rest of those in the organization not on the coaching staff, admired Harrison. He nicknamed him \"Silverback\" because \"The Silverback gorillas spend their days swinging on trees and breaking stuff. Everyone in the jungle is afraid of him.\"\n\n* A prophet, young Haggans. In fact, Harrison - who had proven himself earlier in the season after Porter had been ejected in pre-game - replaced an injured Haggans late in the season and made 10 tackles and returned a fumble for a touchdown in three games. Haggans returned for the playoffs, but Harrison had announced his presence. \"Clark's going to have to make the plays that James Harrison was making,\" James Farrior said at the time. \"He's going to have to raise his level.\"\n\n* He did. In the two 2004 playoff games, Haggans made 14 tackles and recorded 2 sacks.\n\n* Haggans was hitting his stride as a professional, but the calls for Harrison to start opposite Porter echoed throughout the 2005 training camp. \"Tin soldiers and Harrison's coming,\" was written in one of my stories prior to Harrison's start against San Diego and former Kent State teammate Antonio Gates. And Harrison responded with an interception and spectacular hurdle during the return.\n\n* That was one of three games Haggans missed in 2005, but he returned to enjoy his best pro season with 9 sacks. Porter, in fact, said after the season that Haggans should've been named to the Pro Bowl.\n\n* His playoff production continued with 1.5 sacks and 18 tackles during the Steelers' four-game run to the title. In the Super Bowl, Haggans got the first of the Steelers' 3 sacks (Casey Hampton and Deshea Townsend had the others). On Seattle's initial third down of the game, Haggans broke through a hold by tackle Sean Locklear to sack Matt Hasselbeck. He later drew a hold on Locklear early in the fourth quarter to negate a big Seahawks gain to the 1.\n\n* In line with Haggans' overshadowed career, the call continues to be cited by Seahawks fans as an officiating mistake, but the hold was clear. Seahawks fans counter that Haggans was offsides on the play, but a close inspection proved definitively that Haggans remained onside, that he timed the snap perfectly with a quick get-off.\n\n* Haggans was a Super Bowl hero, no doubt, but soon became forgotten.\n\n* In 2006, he had his only career interception, which drew hoots from teammates who knew that Clark's worst physical asset was his hands.\n\n* And in 2007, Porter left, replaced by Harrison, and new coach Mike Tomlin drafted LaMarr Woodley to eventually replace Haggans.\n\n* Haggans left when Woodley moved into the starting lineup in 2008. He played five more seasons with the Cardinals and 49ers. He finished his 13-year career with 520 tackles and 46.5 sacks, big numbers for anyone in the game. But it was overshadowed by a litany of big-name Steelers linebackers and just bad timing.\n\n* I don't know the details of Haggans' death this week. All I can say is that, at 46, he died way too young.\n\n* When I was 46, in 2006, I was writing about Haggans' exploits in bringing the fifth Lombardi to Pittsburgh. But I'm certain I didn't give him the credit he deserved."
