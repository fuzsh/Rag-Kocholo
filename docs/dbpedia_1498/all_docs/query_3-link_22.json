        "text": "Former Pittsburgh Steelers star Clark Haggans, who played in three Super Bowls including the Steelers' 2006 triumph, has died aged 46.\n\nPittsburgh radio host Colin Dunlap first reported Haggans' death. The Steelers are yet to comment on his passing and a cause of death is yet to be reported.\n\nAfter being drafted in the fifth round in 2000, linebacker Haggans would make himself a pivotal member of the defense, forming a highly effective pass-rush duo with Steelers legend – and former Colorado State teammate – Joey Porter Jr, with Haggans registering a sack in the Super Bowl win over the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nAfter seven years with the Steelers, Haggans made the move to the Arizona Cardinals. where he played for three years, reaching the Super Bowl in 2009 against his former team, and Pittsburgh would prevail in a thrilling 27-23 victory.\n\nOnce his time in Arizona came to an end, Haggans joined the San Francisco 49ers in 2012 and was part of another Super Bowl run, which again ended agonizingly in defeat, losing out 34-31 to the Baltimore Ravens. in 2013. The Colorado State Hall of Famer retired at the end of that season.\n\nHaggans, who is survived by his son Damon and daughter Alianna, finished his NFL career with 520 tackles, 46.5 sacks and one interception.\n\nTributes from Steelers and Colorado State fans poured in on social media after his death was announced on Tuesday evening.\n\nOne fan wrote: \"I will never forget that crucial holding penalty he drew in Super Bowl XL. He was so steady opposite of Porter. Rest in Peace! Rest in Power!\"\n\nAnother Steelers fan added: \"Sad to hear. Prayers for him and his family. Met him a couple of times when he played, seemed like a nice guy. One of the unsung heroes of the Super Bowl 40 team.\"\n\nA third added: \"Clark was loved and will be dearly missed by all those who knew him. He was much, much more than a football player. He was a devoted dad to his two kids and loved them beyond measure. We're all still in shock. RIP Clark!\"\n\nHaggans' relationship with Porter through college into the NFL meant they shared many great memories together and celebrating the championship in 2006 with his friend was the best of all.\n\n“A cool memory of course is winning the Super Bowl,” Haggans told SteelersNow in 2019. “The coolest though was that the first dude I saw when the confetti fell was Joey.\n\n\"We would wig out when we won the Holiday Bowl at Colorado State – that was the greatest thing to us then. Here we were winning a Super Bowl together.”"
