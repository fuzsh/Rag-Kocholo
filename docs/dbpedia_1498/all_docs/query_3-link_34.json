        "text": "In kind of a bizarre story, former Steelers LB Clark Haggans - a member of Pittsburgh's Super Bowl XL team - is serving a 48-hour jail sentence to be followed by seven days of work release for a DUI arrest in April.\n\nWhat's bizarre is his excuse. If there is one for driving under the influence, that is.\n\nIt's a tough situation, but one he is facing up to, nonetheless.\n\nAccording to SB Nation's Joel Thorman, who quoted Jeff Sperbeck, Haggans' agent, Haggans released a statement explaining the incident.\n\nThe summarized statement reads that Haggans and his wife were at a concert on April 21, 2011, in Maricopa County, Ariz., when Haggans received a call from the babysitter of the couple's 5-year-old daughter was having trouble breathing. His daughter is on medication for under developed lungs.\n\nHaggans could not find his wife, so despite having been drinking, he got in his car and rushed him to tend to his daughter.\n\nEn route, he was picked up for running a red light, as well as suspicion of DUI.\n\nHe also notes after that the officers and Haggans returned to his place to administer care to his daughter, where, at that point, he was cited for running a red light, speeding and suspicion of DUI.\n\nHe offers up in hindsight, he should have found a different way home, and he does accept full responsibility for his actions.\n\nThe Tribune-Review noted Haggans chose to serve his sentence at the Westmoreland County Prison in Pittsburgh.\n\nHe had a DUI arrest in Colorado in 2004.\n\nIt isn't a fun set of circumstances for him to be in, and as he said, he made a bad decision. It's just a tough position in which to put oneself, considering the medical history of his daughter. Haggans always seemed to be an up-and-up kind of guy, and we hope he and his family can get whatever help they need, and he can finish his career out on a high note."
