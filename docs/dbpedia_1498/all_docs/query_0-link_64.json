        "text": "Hartings and Faneca were great. Smith was ok from what I remember. Simmons never really lived up to the draft stock, although I think injuries might've ended his career if I remember correctly. Starks was young and not the player he ended up being yet. I guess they were a bit better than I gave them credit for just because of how good Faneca and Hartings were. But yeah the 08 line wasn't real pretty. The 2010 line that lost the SB was even worse. I didn't even remember that Flozell Adams was a Steeler and I remember dudes from '93 when I was 4 years old hahah (although he was a good player when he was younger, we just got his shell)\n\nI think, they missed on the oline in 2020's draft. I feel like they could've gotten highsmith much later in the draft. We had no first ... picked Claypool in the 2nd rd. Maybe, we could've gotten him in the 3rd or an olineman in the 3rd. If we were as good, as we are, in picking up wr's ... in picking up db's and olinemen ... we would be sitting pretty ... right about now.\n\nSo why did we only win 6 games the year before???\n\nAsking for a friend.\n\nThis is a 20 min analysis from Alex Kozora. Yes I watched it and it left me wondering, is it all bad Lineman? Is is bad scheme and coaching philosophy? A bit of both?\n\nBottom line it seems players are having a hard time adapting this coach's philosophy. I honestly don't know enough to make a judgment, except is his philosophy a proven product of winning? If not, then why is he coaching at an NFL level..just asking.\n\nMike Tomlin.\n\nWhen healthy,the o-line in 2010 was better that the one in 2008 but the injuries make the o-line worst...Jonathan Scott as LT was a true disaster\n\nAccording to ProFootballReference, Adams started 16 games that year and Scott started 9. That would mean Scott and Adams played mostly together. Adams could have replaced him at first after the first game, but they ended up playing together for 8+ games later. Not sure how that transpired\n\nCause Tommy Maddox was our starter. I never say anything bad about Tommy. He led what could have been the greatest Steeler comeback in a Playoff game.\n\nAnd the running game were 31st in 2003 and our defense were average at best...The next year,the steelers had a new QB,new DC in Dick Lebeau,the breakout year for Troy Polamalu and the running game were second.Ben was also great to make big play(8.9 yards per pass attempts!)\n\nyep - Harris will be wasted. I said that too last spring. that - and the obvious, Tomlin blunders at hiring OLINE coaches.\n\nyep - meet the new boss, same as the old boss. sucked last year, look like suck will the theme this year."
