        "text": "Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nNewly signed outside linebacker Clark Haggans will officially miss three games for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. The three-game ban stems from a DUI arrest in 2011 when he was a member of the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nAt a hearing two weeks ago his agent Jeff Sperbeck lobbied to have the suspension reduced. And his lobbying worked as Haggans suspension was originally supposed to be around the six-game mark.\n\nThe 49ers signed the former Cardinal after their depth took a hit when Parys Haralson was put on injured reserve. Haggans brings veteran experience to the backup linebacker position. In his four-year stint with Arizona he recorded 17 sacks and over 180 tackles.\n\nNiners general manager Trent Baalke was aware of the pending situation before they brought him in, so he was not surprised when he learned of Haggans' suspension, per The Sacramento Bee: \"We were certainly aware that this decision was a possibility as we evaluated Clark prior to adding him to our roster. Therefore, we are prepared to move forward accordingly.\"\n\nAs of right now it's not really know what will happen at the backup outside linebacker position. Matt Barrows of The Sacramento Bee suggests they could use defensive end Demarcus Dobbs as an emergency outside backer as need be.\n\nSan Francisco's depth surely takes a hit, but there's no question they will be just fine barring any sort of injury.\n\nNow, let's take a look at news for the rest of the NFC West.\n\nArizona Cardinals\n\nScott Allen of RaisingArizona.com examines ESPN's power rankings and suggests the Cardinals are too low after knocking off Seattle and New England.\n\nCarter Watson of Bleacher Report gives us an early look as to how Arizona can knock off the Eagles in Week 3.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\n\nCam Inman of the MercuryNews.com says Aldon Smith is OK after a car crash that happened two days before their Sunday night game against the Lions.\n\nJesse Reed of Bleacher Report does a great job of breaking down why the 49ers' defense is so successful.\n\nSeattle Seahawks\n\nDave Boling of The Bellingham Herald gives us the early indicators as to why this Seahawks' defense might be the best one they've ever had.\n\nTodd Pheifer of Bleacher Report says Seattle can't afford to lose this week's upcoming matchup to the Packers.\n\nSt. Louis Rams\n\nJim Thomas of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch talks to Austin Pettis and says he is eager to return after serving a two game suspension to start 2012.\n\nTravis Wakeman of Bleacher Report begs the question, has Daryl Richardson earned a permanent role in the Rams' offense?"
