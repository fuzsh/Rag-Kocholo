        "text": "By Joseph Allen\n\nPublished Jun. 21 2023, 10:11 a.m. ET\n\nFormer Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker and Super Bowl champion Clark Haggans has died at the age of 46. The news of his death was first reported by 93.7 The Fan's Collin Dunlap, and has left many who remember Clark from his days in the NFL wondering exactly what the former player's cause of death was.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nClark wasn't one of the most high-profile former players in the world, but he had a solid career on the field, and one that ultimately helped his team win a championship. What was Clark Haggan's cause of death? Here's what we know.\n\nWhat was Clark Haggans's cause of death?\n\nClark retired from football in 2013 after leaving the Steelers in 2007. In his post on Twitter, Colin didn't offer any detail on what Clark's cause of death might have been.\n\n\"Former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Clark Haggans has died. He was 46. Haggans played for the Steelers from 2000–07, was a 2000 5th round pick of the organization and member of the Super Bowl XL championship team,\" Colin wrote in his tweet.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nNo cause of death has been reported in relation to Clark yet, although Steelers fans are likely curious because Clark was relatively young at the time of his death.\n\nUltimately, though, all we can do is speculate about what Clark's cause of death might be, while noting that those who play positions like linebacker in the league often suffer brain damage that leads to health problems later on in life.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nClark played the majority of his career with the Steelers.\n\nAlthough he played for some other teams after leaving the Steelers, Clark's major legacy was undoubtedly in Pittsburgh. He started his career in Pittsburgh as a reserve player on the special teams roster, and started only four games during his rookie year. The next year, he took over as one of the team's core linebackers and racked up 332 tackles and 32.5 sacks.\n\nClark joined the Arizona Cardinals after leaving the Steelers, and was there for four seasons. Clark was on the roster when the team played the Steelers in the Super Bowl, but he was on injured reserve and didn't see any playing time. He then joined the San Francisco 49ers, where he made his last Super Bowl run in the team's loss to the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nClark is still remembered by Steelers fans.\n\nIn addition to leaving behind a son and daughter, Clark is also remembered by fans who think about his performance in the Super Bowl, in particular.\n\n\"I will never forget that crucial holding penalty he drew in Super Bowl XL. He was so steady opposite of Porter. Rest in Peace! Rest in Power!\" one person wrote on Twitter following the news of his death.\n\n\"Sad to hear. Prayers for him and his family. Met him a couple times when he played, seemed like a nice guy. One of the unsung heroes of the SB 40 team,\" another person added.\n\nFor both fans and those who knew him, it's clear that Clark left behind a substantial legacy. Our prayers are with Clark's family, friends, and all who mourn his passing."
