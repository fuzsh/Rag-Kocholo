        "text": "Haggans History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIreland\n\nIrish names tend to vary widely in their spelling and overall form. The original Gaelic form of the name Haggans is Ó hAgain, which was earlier rendered as Ó hOgain. Traditionally, the name means young. 1\n\nEarly Origins of the Haggans family\n\nThe surname Haggans was first found in County Tyrone (Irish: Tír Eoghain), the ancient territory of the O'Neills, now in the Province of Ulster, central Northern Ireland, where they held a family seat from ancient times.\n\nEarly History of the Haggans family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Haggans research. Another 65 words (5 lines of text) covering the years 1612 and 1722 are included under the topic Early Haggans History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nHaggans Spelling Variations\n\nThe Middle Ages saw a great number of spelling variations for surnames common to the Irish landscape. One reason for these variations is the fact that surnames were not rigidly fixed by this period. The following variations for the name Haggans were encountered in the archives: Hagan, Hegan, Hagen, O'Hagan and others.\n\nEarly Notables of the Haggans family\n\nMore information is included under the topic Early Haggans Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMigration of the Haggans family\n\nA great mass of Ireland's native population left the island in the 19th century, seeking relief from various forms of social, religious, and economic discrimination. This Irish exodus was primarily to North America. If the migrants survived the long ocean journey, many unfortunately would find more discrimination in the colonies of British North America and the fledgling United States of America. These newly arrived Irish were, however, wanted as a cheap source of labor for the many large agricultural and industrial projects that were essential to the development of what would become two of the wealthiest nations in the western world. Early immigration and passenger lists indicate many people bearing the Haggans name: Agnes Hagan settled in New England in 1802; Alexander, Bernard, Charles, Henry, James, John, Michael, Patrick, Thomas and William Hagan all arrived in Philadelphia between 1840 and 1860..\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Haggans (post 1700) +\n\nClark Cromwell Haggans (1977-2023), American NFL football linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers (2000-2007), Arizona Cardinals (2008-2011) and the San Francisco 49ers (2012)\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nCitations +\n\nMacLysaght, Edward, The Surnames of Ireland.
