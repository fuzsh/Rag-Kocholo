        "text": "Don’t miss the Browns’ “after party.” The draft doesn’t get crowded for them until Saturday.\n\nAs it stands before they make any trades, the Browns have one pick Thursday (No. 6 overall), one Friday (68) and five on Saturday (104, 139, 164, 175, 227).\n\nIt could be a Saturday pity party. Post-100 draft picks in the expansion era mostly have been of the ilk of Madre Hill, Spergon Winn, Jeremiah Pharms, Joaquin Gonzalez, Luke McCown and Beau Bell— names that evoke a smile or a grimace, players who never made a difference.\n\nOn the other hand, a few are key men behind the Browns’ hopes to be a surprise team in 2013. Notably, defensive lineman Ahtyba Rubin (No. 190 overall, 2008), was named the sixth-best sixth-round pick of the last five drafts by National Football Post.\n\nEveryone on last year’s team raved about defensive lineman Billy Winn, who surprised as a rookie No. 205 overall pick.\n\nLinebacker James-Michael Johnson (No. 120 overall, 2012) will get a chance to prove he was a Tom Heckert draft steal.\n\nThe Browns’ first pick on Saturday is at No. 104. That resonates with fans who remember Brian Brennan’s touchdown putting the Browns ahead of Denver late in the 1986 AFC championship game. Brennan was a No. 104 draft pick in 1984.\n\nLater Saturday, the Browns pick at No. 175. Wideout Reggie Langhorne, a key man in the 1980s glory years, was a No. 175 pick in 1985.\n\nCoincidental history aside, the Browns’ new regime aspires to examples of teams that have been steady contenders with effective drafting outside the top 100.\n\nPittsburgh has made playoff runs influenced by defensive ends Aaron Smith (No. 109, 1999) and Brett Keisel (No. 242, 2002), linebackers Clark Haggans (No. 137, 2000) and Larry Foote (No. 128, 2002), offensive linemen Chris Kemoeatu (No. 204, 2005) and Willie Colon (No. 131, 2006), defensive back Ike Taylor (No. 125, 2003) and wide receiver Antonio Brown (No. 195, 2010).\n\nBaltimore has received big help from defensive lineman Jarret Johnson (No. 109, 2003), safety Dawan Landry (No. 146, 2006), running back La’Ron McClain (No. 137, 2007), punter Sam Koch (No. 203, 2006), tight end Dennis Pitta (No. 114, 2010), defensive tackle Arthur Jones (No. 157, 2010, cornerback Chykie Brown (No. 164, 2011) and defensive end Pernell McPhee (No. 165, 2011). Pitta caught 14 passes in this year’s postseason, four in a Super Bowl win.\n\nBrowns CEO Joe Banner hung out in Philadelphia draft rooms when the Eagles scored with offensive lineman Todd Herremans (No. 126, 2005), linebacker Trent Cole (No. 146, 2005), wideout Jason Avant (No. 109, 2006) and tight end Brent Celek (No. 162, 2007). On the other hand, the vast majority of the Eagles’ post-100 picks have had little or no impact.\n\nBanner and general manager Michael Lombardi must prove they can sort through the suspects and deliver two or three solid prospects from among their stash of Saturday picks.\n\nIt’s not an easy job.\n\nLarry Asante, James Davis, Chase Pittman, Syndric Steptoe, Paul Hubbard, Martin Rucker, Demario Minter, Antonio Perkins, Kirk Gordon, Darnell Sanders, Adimchinobe Echemandu, Brad Bedell, Darrin Chiaverini, Kendall Ogle ...\n\nRemember them? ALL of them? Congratulations. They are former post-100 Browns draft picks, and you are a Browns draft expert.\n\nReach Steve at 330-580-8347 or steve.doerschuk@cantonrep.com"
