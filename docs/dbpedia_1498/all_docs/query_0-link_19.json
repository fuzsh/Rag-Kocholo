        "text": "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers stayed in-house\n\nSaturday to make their first major free-agent signing of the\n\noffseason, bringing back linebacker Clark Haggans in a move that\n\nlikely means former All-Pro outside linebacker Jason Gildon won't\n\nreturn.\n\nHaggans, a reserve since being a fifth-round draft pick in 2000,\n\nsigned a $10.2 million, four-year contract that includes a $3\n\nmillion signing bonus. He has been used primarily as a pass rusher\n\non passing downs and on special teams, getting six sacks in 2002.\n\nHaggans also visited the Lions and Giants last week before\n\nreturning to Pittsburgh, which was outbid for free-agent\n\nlinebackers Marcus Washington and Carlos Emmons. Washington signed\n\nFriday with the Redskins. Emmons, a former Steelers player, reached\n\nterms with the Giants.\n\nHaggans, 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds, had 10 unassisted tackles, a\n\nsack, a pass deflection and a forced fumble last season and was the\n\nspecial teams captain. He had a season-high nine tackles filling in\n\nfor injured starter Joey Porter in the season opener against\n\nBaltimore.\n\nSince the season ended, Haggans was sentenced in Brighton,\n\nColo., to 10 days in jail for driving while impaired. Haggans'\n\nsentence includes six months of probation and 24 hours of public\n\nservice. The jail time can be served out of state. A hearing is\n\nscheduled Aug. 31 to review his case.\n\nWith the Steelers right at the $80.6 million salary cap, they\n\ncan't make any more significant moves until they free up some cap\n\nroom -- something they could do by releasing Gildon, whose\n\nproduction has dropped off in the last two seasons.\n\nThe Steelers will bring in free agent running back Duce Staley\n\nfor a visit Sunday as they look to get their trademark running game\n\ngoing again after it finished next-to-last in the league last\n\nseason.\n\nRunning back Jerome Bettis previously agreed to a large salary\n\ncut, from more than $4 million to $1 million plus incentives, but\n\nthe Steelers also want to sign or draft another running back. They\n\nare expected to release or trade Amos Zereoue, who averaged only\n\n3.3 yards per carry after beginning last season as a starter.\n\nStaley previously visited with the Bucs and Cowboys and is\n\nseeking to move to a team where he will get more carries. He had\n\nonly 97 carries for 457 yards and scored seven touchdowns last\n\nseason as Philadelphia lost in the NFC title game for the third\n\nconsecutive season.\n\nThe Steelers may lose another player on defense if they don't\n\nmatch New England's $1.3 million, one-year offer sheet to backup\n\ndefensive end Rodney Bailey. Bailey, who had 5Â½ sacks in 2002, is a\n\nrestricted free agent and the Steelers have the right to match any\n\noffer to him.\n\nThe Patriots' offer includes a $650,000 signing bonus."
