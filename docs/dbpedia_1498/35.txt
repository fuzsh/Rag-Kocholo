Football (1996 to 1999)

Clark Haggans was one of the most prolific defensive players of the late 1990s for the Rams, graduating with the career sack record (33) at CSU. Haggans added to the defensive power and led the Rams to two conference championships, WAC 1997 and MW 1999. He was honored with second-team All-WAC honors in 1998 and first-team All-MW honors in 1999. He racked up 12 sacks in 1997 and 1998 and was a key player in the 1997 Holiday Bowl victory over the University of Missouri.

Haggans was chosen in the fifth round of the NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers and began a 13-season career at football’s highest level. Teamed up with fellow Ram Joey Porter, Haggans was a member of the Steelers’ Super Bowl XL championship team and went on to play for the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers, who also won NFC championships. Haggans retired from the NFL after the 2012 season.
