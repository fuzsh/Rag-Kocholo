FORT COLLINS â€“ Clark Haggans, one of the greatest defensive players in program history and the program's career record holder for sacks, passed away on Monday, June 19. He was 46 years old.

Haggans, who returned to Fort Collins in recent years, helped lead the Rams to a pair of conference championships in the WAC (1997) and Mountain West (1999). His 33 career sacks remain a program record even 24 years after his final season. Haggans also tallied 54 tackles for loss, a mark surpassed only by Mike Bell's 62, over the course of his Ram career.

He was inducted into the Colorado State Athletics Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 2015.

Following his collegiate career, Haggans was a fifth round pick in the 2000 NFL Draft. He reunited with long-time friend and Colorado State teammate Joey Porter on the Pittsburgh Steelers where he began a 13-year career in the NFL. Alongside Porter, Haggans won Super Bowl XL with the Steelers. He added to his career with the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers before retiring after the 2012 season. Haggans' 13-year NFL career is matched by only Porter and another Ram defensive legend, Al Baker.

For his career, Haggans tallied 520 tackles and 46.5 sacks.

Arrangements to remember and celebrate the life of Clark Haggans are still pending and will be announced when they become available.
