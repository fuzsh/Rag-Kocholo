Jeff Oster is a trumpet and flugelhorn player who blends influences from progressive rock, jazz, and funk with his parents' love of standards from the 1930s and 1940s. He will be releasing his fourth album next spring which finds him bringing his horn more to the forefront. The album titled "next" represents a new genre called New Age Ambient Funk and features collaborations with legendary musicians Nile Rodgers, Bernard "Pretty" Purdie, and Chuck Rainey. For Jeff, the album tells the story of rebirth and what's next for him as a musician and in his life.
