When he’s not at his desk preparing a case, you will most likely find him at a boxing gym preparing for a bout. The same tenacity and determination that he brings to the ring, he brings to his client’s cases. Licensed in May of 2021, Miles began his practice of law in the personal injury field, were he learned how to press hard for his clients. While he excelled in this area, he was missing out on what he really wanted to do, litigate. In an effort to get into the courtroom and use his skills to help those in need, he turned to family law.\n\nMiles first had the thought to become an attorney as a child but didn’t make the decision until his junior year in college. He obtained his bachelor’s degree in Biology from the University of North Texas, then proceeded to study law at the Washburn University School of Law. The transition from spending nights in a laboratory, to nights in a law library was shocking at first, but Miles quickly found his stride studying law. During the summer of his 2L year he participated in the Intensive Trial Advocacy Program (ITAP) and got his first taste of courtroom litigation. After getting in front of a judge and jury for the first time, Miles knew that was where he belonged.\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/milesdavidpeterson/\n\nO'Neil Wysocki: https://www.oneilattorneys.com/\n\nLearn more about EmotionTrac and our AI-driven Emotional Intelligence Platform:\n\nhttps://legal.emotiontrac.com/\n\nJoshua is a Washington State native, raised in the Tacoma area.

During high school in San Diego, he only wanted to play collegiate football.

One of his friends was attending law school and encouraged John to consider it. Thanks to him, John applied for and was accepted to attend Yale University, the #1 ranked law school in the world. After surfing all Summer, John arrived in New Haven to begin his studies with some of the most academically impressive people on the planet.
