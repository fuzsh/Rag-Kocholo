        "text": "Creating a sense of family has always been an important part of the Windermere tradition. That’s because the company itself was born from family, starting with founder, John Jacobi. From the early days of Windermere, John encouraged his children to get involved with the family business by answering phones, sweeping sidewalks, and volunteering in the community. His efforts paid off because nearly 50 years later, the company he built is now in the hands of a second generation who continue to honor the company’s humble beginnings while keeping a firm eye on the future.\n\nGeoff Wood has served as chief executive officer of Windermere Services Company since 2003. Geoff is responsible for the core infrastructure functions of the company. Under his leadership, Windermere has moved into new markets in California, Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Utah, and Hawaii. Geoff joined Windermere Real Estate in 1993 to manage five Jacobi family-owned real estate offices in Seattle. Prior to joining Windermere, he worked in construction and business management for Timberland Homes.\n\nJill Jacobi Wood brings a second generation of leadership to Windermere Real Estate which was founded by her father, John Jacobi, in 1972. Jill helps oversee the Windermere Services Company, which provides operational support, systems, and programs to more than 300 Windermere franchises. She is also instrumental in the growth of the Windermere brand through franchise development and helps run seven family-owned Windermere offices.\n\nOB Jacobi brings a second generation of leadership to Windermere Real Estate which was founded by his father, John Jacobi, in Seattle in 1972. In 1989, he earned his real estate license and spent the next decade working in many aspects of the business, including real estate agent, property manager, office manager, general manager, and franchise owner. As co-president with his sister Jill Jacobi Wood and brother-in-law Geoff Wood, OB has helped facilitate Windermere’s growth into one of the largest and most respected regional real estate brands in the country. In addition to guiding business strategies for the Windermere network, OB oversees operations for several family-owned Windermere offices. He also sits on the boards of MoxiWorks, the Windermere Foundation, and Move Forward Financial."
