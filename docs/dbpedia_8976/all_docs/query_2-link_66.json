        "text": "23 mei 2024 Uncategorized\n\nScroll down and click on photo’s for websites.\n\nIn the ethereal realm of instrumental music, the latest single by Shambhu and Jeff\n\nOster, “Montauk to Mexico,” unveils a mesmerizing duo that transcends geographical\n\nboundaries. Shambhu’s acoustic guitar artistry blends seamlessly with Jeff Oster’s\n\nmastery of the flugelhorn, resulting in a sonic landscape that mirrors a street music jam\n\n—oneartist playing on the east end of Long Island in New York and the other in the\n\nvibrant town of San Pancho, Mexico.\n\nThe very title of the composition, “Montauk to Mexico,” serves as a melodic roadmap for\n\nJeff Oster’s soulful flugelhorn, resonating with the warmth of Mexican sunsets,\n\nharmoniously dancing with Shambhu’s intricate guitar arrangements, capturing the\n\nessence of both coastal retreats. The composition serves as a testament to the artists’\n\nability to translate their surroundings into a musical language that transcends mere\n\nnotes. The sound is like a sonic postcard, inviting listeners to immerse themselves in\n\nthe picturesque scenes painted by the musicians.\n\nShambhu notes, “When I thought of a song we could record together from our\n\nrespective locations, my first thought was a spontaneous street jam. I first met Jeff in\n\n2009 at a jam session with flutist Ann Licater on a Ferry Boat running from San\n\nFrancisco to Alameda in California. “Montauk to Mexico” celebrates the spirit of that jam\n\nsession and many since. He introduced me to Will Ackerman in 2010 and we have also\n\nrecorded together on each others’ albums.”\n\nJeff adds: It’s always a special moment when I get to create music with my dearest\n\nbrother Shambhu. To dance with my horn and his guitar is one of the great joys of my\n\nlife. This song is a perfect example of the two of us exploring the mystery of music\n\ntogether, and I am thrilled with what we are sharing in this song.”\n\nThe artistry of both Jeff and Shambhu shines through every note of “Montauk to\n\nMexico.” Jeff’s emotive flugelhorn playing, with its nuanced phrasing and rich timbre,\n\nadds a layer of depth and feeling of expansiveness. Shambhu’s guitar work, marked by\n\nits intricate fingerstyle and harmonic sophistication, complements Jeff’s musical\n\nexpressions with a melodic tapestry that is both intricate and accessible.\n\nThe collaborative synergy between these two friends and artists is a joy to hear. Their\n\nability to communicate through their instruments creates a musical conversation that\n\nspeaks directly to the soul.\n\nThey also celebrate the same birthday- May 31st- the date of this release.\n\nJeff Oster and Shambhu have crafted a musical birthday celebration that invites\n\nlisteners to simply kick back and be transported from the shores of Montauk to the\n\nvibrant landscapes of Mexico, a testament to the universal language of music that\n\nspeaks to the heart and soul.\n\nJeff Oster is a Grammy-nominated American musician and Billboard charting artist who\n\nspecializes in trumpet and flugelhorn in the New Age music genre. He is a member of\n\nthe four-piece band “Flow.” Oster’s style has been described as “Miles Davis meets\n\nPink Floyd.” He has released several albums as a solo artist, showcasing his skills as\n\nboth a performer and composer. His music is characterized by its atmospheric\n\nsoundscapes, intricate arrangements, and rich, soulful solos.\n\nShambhu transforms stillness and silence into calming sounds. Over his seven albums,\n\nhe is known for blending the beautiful sounds of acoustic guitar and new age and jazz\n\nmusic elements to create tranquil, mesmerizing music. His work has been described as\n\nrelaxing and meditative, and it has been used by listeners to set the mood for an ideal\n\nenvironment."
