        "text": "Jeff Oster\n\nBaseball\n\nJefferson\n\nPitcher\n\nSenior\n\nLast week's feats\n\nIn one of Jefferson's most important games of the season, Oster threw a one-hit shutout for the Falcons to help them beat Pope John, 4-0, and hand the Lions their first loss in the NJAC American Division. Oster struck out eight batters and walked one in his 90-pitch shutout to give the Falcons a chance at possibly winning the American Division title, as they only have one loss as well.\n\nQuote from coach Jason Kalish\n\n\"He's just one of those seniors that wants the ball in the big game. It was great to see him finally put together what he is capable of doing.\""
