        "text": "The Foundation Board is the decision-making body of ALIPH. It legislates the strategic orientations of the institution, its initiatives and partnerships, and selects the projects to be financed. The Chair of the Board is Ms. Bariza Khiari, adviser to the President of the French Republic and representative of France, and the Vice-Chair is H.E. Mohamed Al Mubarak, President of the Department of Culture and Tourism of Abu Dhabi and representative of the United Arab Emirates. Other members of the Board with voting rights are representatives of contributing states and foundations, philanthropists and qualified personalities.\n\nALIPH is an “alliance” between several states, private partners and experts, guaranteeing a pluralistic vision. The following states, institutions and individuals have decided to come together to fund this initiative. France, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco, Luxembourg, China, and Cyprus have provided financial support. ALIPH also benefits from the support of Switzerland and received contributions from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Getty, and philanthropists Dr. Thomas S. Kaplan and Mr. Jean-Claude Gandur.\n\nThe Secretariat is the operational body of ALIPH and is charged with the day-to-day management and implementation of the strategy and decisions of the Foundation Board. In particular, it organises calls for projects, negotiates and concludes financial support agreements, carries out the monitoring of projects, prepares the meetings and decisions of the Foundation Board, supports the various specialist committees and contributes to awareness raising, promotion, and fundraising.\n\nThe Secretariat is organised as a start-up and is run by Executive Director Mr. Valéry Freland."
