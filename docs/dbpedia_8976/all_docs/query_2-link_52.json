        "text": "As an introduction:\n\nI am the Founder of WINDHAM HILL RECORDS, the producer of musicians GEORGE WINSTON, LIZ STORY, MICHAEL HEDGES, and ALEX DEGRASSI. I am a GRAMMY® WINNER and FOUR-TIME GRAMMY® NOMINEE. I have 27 GOLD and PLATINUM RECORDS on the walls of my studio, IMAGINARY ROAD STUDIOS in WINDHAM COUNTY, VERMONT. Engineer TOM EATON and I are the co-producers of many artists whose projects have won more ZMR RADIO AWARDS and ZMR ALBUM OF THE YEAR AWARDS than anyone in the history of the awards.\n\nI am happy to listen to any work a musician might like to have my comments on, whether this is for a project I produce or not. (Historically, I’ve offered these services ONLY on projects I would be producing).\n\nProduction includes:\n\nListening and commenting on your music, whether you plan to record with us or not.\n\nHaving listened to the work, I will make comments and offer suggestions on the structure of the pieces(s). This may include eliminating a section that feels out of place. More often, it’s a matter of hearing a section of the demo that should, in my opinion, be given a greater role in the composition.\n\nI will listen to the structure of the composition, point out the strong elements and the weaker elements and help in the process of working toward an arrangement that capitalizes on the best aspects of what an artist brings to the table for consideration.\n\nIdeas for additional instrumentation would also be a part of this process…what instrument? wherein the arrangement this additional instrumentation might best enhance the composition?\n\nThis is a typical production process that includes my time in the studio listening to your music and making notes. For more information please contact me here: support@williamackerman.com\n\nEngineering & Mastering\n\nThis brings us to the role TOM EATON plays in my life as a producer. He is an AWARD-WINNING ENGINEER, with whom I work exclusively. He is the most talented engineer I have ever worked with in my life… which is saying a lot !!! When not working with me at my IMAGINARY ROAD STUDIOS here in Vermont, Tom works out of his own studio in Massachusetts. There he can do all MIXING and MASTERING of projects.\n\nTOM’S MASTERING IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR ANY PROJECT regardless of whether you are doing any other work with us.\n\nAs someone who worked for decades with the world-famous mastering engineer BOB LUDWIG at Gateway Mastering, I NOW RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON TOM EATON FOR ALL OF MY MIXING and MASTERING.\n\nLASTLY, IF THE VOLUME OF THE WORK ON A PROJECT IS SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT IT, YOU WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO MY NAME AS CO-PRODUCER.\n\n- Will Ackerman"
