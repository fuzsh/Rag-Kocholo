You're a brilliant musician...and that tone, gimmie a break!\" - Nile Rodgers \"Jeff Oster has always amazed me. Anyone who sounds like no one else amazes me, but a guy who grows so stunningly as a composer and player in the space of a few years inspires nothing but awe. NEXT is a step in musical evolution from where we last heard from Jeff… rather like the apes harnessing fire and inventing French cuisine. It’s a joy as his friend and co-producer to watch someone you love and respect grow into an artist of true importance and significance in a world of background noise. Listen to this. It matters.\" - Will Ackerman \"I have recorded many of the world's greatest trumpet and flugelhorn players. In fact, some of the most important that music has to offer…talk about tone, intonation, phrasing and all things wonderful about the instrument, Jeff has it all...\" - Bruce Swedien (Engineer of Michael Jackson’s THRILLER) \"In essence all of Jeff Oster’s music is special…He has created a masterpiece of instrumental bliss. Next slides down into your soul like your favorite ice cream on a hot summer day. You feel satisfaction and complete joy. This is relaxation and satisfaction taken to the next level.\" - Keith Hannalek, New Age Music Review \"Jeff Oster's music is fantastic, and the title track for his new album is a tight, minimalist, New Age haze of a tune where trumpets drone over a slow and funky beat. The song features guitarist Nile Rodgers, who's worked with Daft Punk and David Bowie, among others… Put on the song, align your chakras, rub your nipples with spirit crystals, and just fucking relax for once. Jeff Oster looks like your friend's dad who wore a fedora and hit the grav bong too hard—but who knew that guy could also blow a mean-ass horn?\" - Charlie Ambler, VICE\n\nShow less"
