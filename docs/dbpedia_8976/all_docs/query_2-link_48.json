        "text": "Jeffrey Koepper | Vic Hennegan | Michael Peck - 16 April 2011\n\nJeffrey Koepper's precisely programmed swirling Spacemusic seduces listeners into a kaleidoscopic inner-sanctum where time is suspended and the outside world fades away.\n\nVic Hennegan's compositions combine influences from the worlds of Prog, Techno, New Age, Ambient, Space, Electronic and World Music into a most distinctive work.\n\nMichael Peck is an artist living in sound. Treating the soundfield like a canvas his music demands imaginative interaction and asks the listener to re-align our sensitivity to sound.\n\nThe American Dollar + Richard Lainhart - 14 May 2011\n\nThe duo of John Emanuele and Richard Cupolo have been performing and releasing their wonderfully subdued and atmospheric rock music as The American Dollar since 2005. Their ambient albums remix and re-imagine their more contemporary recordings into two volumes of intelligent and engaging mind music. The listening experience remains active as their spacey thought tones move swiftly across an imaginative aural terrain. From bright timbres and vivid textures to dark tones and slow deep breaths of sound, on their two so-called \"ambient\" releases this duo creates some of the most intriguing and positive instrumental music of their era.\n\nThe American Dollar performed material from their Ambient Music repertoire when they made their Philadelphia debut at The Gatherings Concert Series on 14 May 2011. Electronic Musician Richard Lainhart opened\n\nConcert Announcement\n\nCarl Weingarten / Jeff Oster / Michael Manring - 15 October 2011\n\nCarl Weingarten is a composer, producer and slide guitarist. His music is a blend of styles, combining traditional folk, jazz and blues, with world fusion, modern electronic, space and progressive sounds. A musician with a filmmaker's ear, his sound has been described as evocative and cinematic.\n\nAs one of the few trumpet/flugelhorn artists working in ambient terrain, Jeff Oster draws from a rich background of classically trained, jazz tinged horn study, mixed with contemporary electronica and loop based electro-orchestral bed tracks.\n\nMichael Manring has developed an entirely new approach to the bass guitar that includes unorthodox tunings, techniques and methodologies. His skills have been honed on over a hundred recordings as a session musician and thousands of concerts throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia.\n\nWeingarten / Oster / Manring made their Philadelphia debut at The Gatherings Concert Series on 15 October 2011. Hang drummer Dante Bucci opened.\n\nConcert Announcement\n\nA Winged Victory for the Sullen - 29 October 2011\n\nAdam Bryanbaum Wiltzie of Stars of the Lid and pianist Dustin O'Halloran along with a trio of string players will make their Philadelphia concert debut as the ensemble A Winged Victory for the Sullen at The Gatherings Concert Series. Their Fall American tour will mark the release of a forthcoming album for Kranky Records.\n\nA Winged Victory for the Sullen made their Philadelphia debut at The Gatherings Concert Series on 29 October 2011. Ken Camden and Benoit Pioulard opened.\n\nConcert Announcement\n\nAirSculpure - 12 November 2011\n\nFREE ADMISSION\n\nMade up of Adrian Beasley, John Christian and Peter Ruczynski, AirSculpture has been using concert spaces to facilitate electronic experimentation since their first live event in September of 1995. Over the years this UK trio have found that the atmosphere of the venue, the attention of the audience and several other immeasurable factors, have a significant affect on the interaction between players and acts as a fuel for their performances. The dynamics and energy of each realization is controlled by a blend of digital technology and analogue control; the music benefiting through the immediate and tactile interface with the gear and with each other. It is this relationship and experience which allows AirSculpture to create spontaneous and effective electronic realizations in the live environment.\n\nAirSculpture's return performance at The Gatherings Concert Series on 12 November 2011 was presented as a free admission event through the generosity of annonymous\n\nConcert Announcement"
