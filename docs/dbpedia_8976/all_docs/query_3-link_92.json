        "text": "An Interview with Pianist/Composer Heidi Breyer BY JAMES A. ALTENA 2022 for FANFARE MAGAZINE Heidi Breyer is an award-winning pianist and composer whose reach now has branched out from piano through instrumental music to a full-scale choral work, Amor Aeternus: A Requiem for the Common Man, which is scheduled to receive its world premiere live performance in Stern Auditorium at Carnegie Hall on July 21, 2022. In conjunction with that project, Heidi is taking a few moments to chat with the readers of Fanfare. 1) I always like to begin an interview by looking at a musician’s roots, so let’s start there. Did you grow up in a musical family? How did you come to the piano as your instrument? What moved you to decide to follow music as a life’s calling? I didn’t grow up in a musical family but my parents were avid listeners and concert goers and apparently my ancestry was quite musical but it must have skipped a generation or two because there was no family music-making, unfortunately. I began to learn the piano when I was 8 years old, having loved ballet and having taken classes since I was two. I think it was the love of music rooted in movement that swayed me towards music. Having auditioned and entered the Arts Educational School in Hertfordshire at 11 years old, along with my academic studies, I received a multi- disciplinary arts immersion that included ballet, modern, jazz and national dance, drama and the staff recognized my musical inclination and gave me some intensive musical training in piano, violin, theory, harmony, general musicianship, voice and ear training. It was at 18 after finishing that stage of education that I chose music to study at college level and ended up going to Trinity College of Music, in London. 2) Where and when did you pursue musical studies and earn your degrees? Who were the teachers and other figures that you consider to have been your key mentors in shaping you to be the musician you are today? What specifically did you learn from each of those mentors that you have endeavored to retain and carry forward in yourself, both professionally and personally? I received a “Graduate of Trinity College London” degree in Music History, majoring in Piano and Violin and earning my Licentiate Diploma in Piano during that time. I studied with Eva Bernatova and Anthony Lindsay who studied with the great Arturo Benedetti Michaelangeli. Madam Bernatova stealthy imparted discipline without you even realizing and conversely Antony Lindsay advised me after graduation that in order to manifest the breadth of talent he was observing, I should experience the true grit of life. In other words get a little life experience under my belt and then return to music. Each teacher felt differently about the way I should harness what clearly had not manifested yet! 3) Are you active entirely as a freelance performer and composer, or do you have any institutional affiliation and position? Totally freelance. I used to teach a roster of 30 private students (a mix of piano, violin, theory, musicianship) until my need to write took priority and although I have my existing work licensed regularly I would very much like to work in the film industry writing for large screen films. 4) On your website, heidibreyer.com, you state that you have “a classical repertoire that ranges from Bach to Ravel.” First, within that range of time, which composers do you particularly gravitate to and perform? And, do you have a regular recital schedule? Second, does this indicate that you also perform non-classical music repertoire, and if so, what other types of music do you play? The classical repertoire is what I have focused on over years of learning, playing and teaching and it represents the foundation and roots of my musical knowledge. Since 2009 I have mostly only performed my own music, not that of classical composer’s (except for accompanying for example ...art songs of Faure etc.) and do not have a classical recital schedule. The music of the masters is in me and I listen, enjoy and gravitate to them depending on the mood and moment. My non-classical repertoire however is around 100 pieces/works and they are all my own. I write and perform original neo-classical and classical crossover piano solo and piano chamber music whenever possible and only want to do MORE performing, composing, touring and commissioned writing! 5) Third, within the ambit of classical music, does this statement also indicate that you are not attracted to musical and stylistic developments following Impressionism? If so, how would you describe your own relationship to present-day compositional schools and trends? I am absolutely attracted to the stylistic developments following impressionism especially today’s minimalism that even the classical large labels find widely appealing... but I cannot embrace entirely the eras of atonalism or experimentalism. There is a place for those, for sure, but too many composers fall fowl of succumbing to their own insecurity and feeling like they need to reinvent the wheel or steer the course of musical evolution by coming up with a “never before” sound which instead can fall short of a gimmick. In my music I strive for emotional and spiritual depth and beauty, not bland, innocuous beauty (what I call pretty music) but beauty that comes from a place of deep introspection, spiritual lightness of being and love of life. Dostoyevsky said beauty will save the world. There is a lot of beauty needed in the world right now. That is my mission. 6) How would you describe your own compositional style and voice? Which composers have exercised the greatest influence upon you, and how do you see yourself as moving with and/ or beyond them? My own style and artistic voice is evolving all the time. A former producer of mine once said that I “refuse to stand still” in my artistic development which made me smile because that speaks to the essence of the journey I have chosen. Even if I wanted to “arrive” at some predictability I don’t think it would be possible. The most influential composers are those I listed in my classical repertoire. They were listed because of their compositional influence as much as the fact that I play them. And then there are present day composer’s John Rutter, Max Richter, Arvo Part. I admire all of them, but I can’t compare myself to any of them... they are they, I am me, we all sing differently and I refuse to look over my shoulder and worry where I am on the musical highway. The industry is brimming over with talent these days and too many composers waste precious energy and time wondering. There is no order, no competition, no point in thinking like that because there is too much of that going on in other walks of life...better to collaborate. And...not to belabor a point... but the world needs as much nourishing music as it can stomach right now... 7) Your website states that Amor Aeternus took almost a decade to gestate and compose. What originally prompted you to conceive and write the work and why did it take so long to come to fruition? Also, your previous compositions have been either for solo piano or for small chamber music ensembles. What was it like to stretch your wings and venture into writing a choral-orchestral score? I wrote almost 100 piano and piano instrumental chamber pieces between 2009 and 2021. Those culminated in five other albums of commercially released music. That is the reason that I took so long to write Amor Aeternus. I wrote it on and off, observing the grief, struggle, grit, determination, strength and perseverance that people globally have demonstrated over the last very demanding decade in the history of humanity. That is why we see a very different character for each movement of the work. My own musicianship manifested in time, evolving and responding to a global human condition. Writing the work was a thrilling experience and also painful at times and most definitely a vertical learning trajectory with setting the sacred text. I had to learn from those who came before me (those who had written Requiems), those who sing Latin, write Latin... so much learning but that is what I held onto when the next wave of witnessing humanity’s pain washed over me...I just dug in and wrote more as if it was an antidote to all the trauma. 8) The subtitle of your work—“A Requiem for the Common Man”—very pointedly invokes Copland’s immortal fanfare. What is your objective in citing that, and what is the conception of your own composition? I grappled with the subtitle for a while BECAUSE it is so much an invocation of Copland. But ironically, this work stands almost as the antithesis of Fanfare for The Common Man which was music predicting a time of economic and social exuberance. Otherwise there is no connection with Aaron Copland. He left us a wonderful legacy through all his works and I will continue to enjoy them all for the rest of my life! 9) In the score of his Missa solemnis, Beethoven famously wrote, “From the heart – may it go to the heart.” Reading the brief notes on the digipak for this release, I had a sense of a very similar purpose by you. What was your larger, humanitarian objective in writing this piece? Vast. I could write reams on this question. My music, even my work preceding Amor, is all about humanity, the human condition, the need for love, light, peace, joy. Even pain, lament and anger have a place in my music as a reflection of our species. I want people all over the world to listen to this piece of music. Stop for an hour, close their eyes and just sit and listen. They will exhale, cry, smile, remember and see a lot of themselves in my work. With the instability in the world today, none of us know what is around the corner. I don’t think many of us (except those in the business) take the time to stop and literally do nothing but listen to music. If we did, I think it would dissolve a lot of discourse in the world, it would change a lot of impulsive and possibly even violent decisions and actions. Solsenitsyn said “the conviction carried by a genuine work of art is absolutely indisputable and tames even the strongly opposed heart”. THAT is the reason I wrote Amor Aeternus, that is the reason Beethoven wrote “From the heart - may it go to the heart”... 10) Like several other composers—Fauré and Britten, to cite just two—you do not set the traditional Requiem mass text “neat,” as it were, but rather adapt it to your own use. Notably, also like Fauré, you omit the “Dies Irae.” What are your own religious beliefs, and how did those relate to and guide your use of this ancient liturgy? The conscious decision to avoid most of the Dies Irae especially the Confutatis was two-fold. The essence of Amor, (in its first iteration) is about reflecting back the beauty of who we are, the beauty that could be lost in life and I endeavor to bring people through the music as a means of catharsis to a place of peace. That is the loosely the path of the traditional Requiem Mass but on the backdrop of the departed. However, Reminding people of a “Day of Wrath” or “judgement” only compounds what is already known. There is enough tumult going on in the world through politics, wars and so on and so I wanted to avoid conflict in my music during this time. Secondly, I had neither the energy or the choral writing experience (frankly) to manifest all that a Dies Irae demands. Many composers add to large works later in their lives/careers and I suspect this might come at a later stage...another part of the evolution of my writing. 11) Amor Aeternus will receive its first complete public performance in Carnegie Hall on July 21, 2022. Your website states of this preceding studio performance that it was “[r]ecorded during the pandemic with each performer isolated in their home studios.” There are 19 performers total: 10 singers (4/2/2/2) and nine instrumentalists (three violins, and one each on viola, cello, double bass, harp, English horn, and piano). Exactly how does one coordinate and balance 19 performers isolated in separate environments and bring that together into a seamless recording? We brought it together over a period of a year and a half. It took a tremendous amount of effort, discipline, detailed planning, zoom calls to direct the ensemble. We identified a lead instrument in each movement...for example the Lacrimosa: We tracked the piano in my home with all the rubatos etc. as it would be performed and sent it to the strings. Each individual string player tracked their part using the score, the piano part (through the headphones) and a conductors click track. When all the string players had completed tracking that section, it was cleaned up just a little and sent to each singer. So the singer then recorded on top of the piano and the strings...and so forth. It was VERY demanding for each contributant and took an inordinate amount of focus by the production team to get it all right. I am very proud to say not one of the movements needed to be redone which says a lot for our good planning and all the talented musicians. The team were incredibly dedicated and I’m so grateful for their tenacity with this marathon! I often wonder if a REQUIEM has ever been recorded in this way. I was determined to help one small group of people who had lost their way musically during this time...the music industry/community was crumbling and we needed to keep music going... 12) How did you come to decide on the particular orchestration for this work? Do you write your scores by longhand, or with music software such as Sibelius? The orchestration is made up of instruments that I am familiar with and I know how to write for and I have many years experience performing with them, too. I have grown to love the sound of each of them, individually and as an ensemble. They were all natural choices. I begin composing at the piano, pencil and manuscript, always. When a subject has rooted itself and is there to stay, I will take it to Logic and Finale. The score ultimately comes from Finale. 13) What is involved in preparing for a Carnegie Hall world premiere, especially with the gradual lifting of Covid pandemic restrictions still an ongoing process? And, how do you feel about this impending premiere? Excited? Nervous? Harried? Or, somehow, calm and at peace? The premiere takes months to prepare. Covid has not impacted preparation yet, as most of the logistical stuff can be done remotely...marketing etc. Parts are currently being learned (beyond the recording ensemble) by all involved and we won’t rehearse before July. These are professionals and we all have other ‘gigs’ to do!! Everyone who enters Carnegie must wear a mask and apparently be vaccinated. We all have to show proof. We are all operating in a vigilant way and only vaccinated players and singers are being employed. My emotions are varied. I’m excited (of course)! ...I will be nervous, I’m working on it much of the time now, but I meditate a lot and so I’m usually pretty calm and at peace. You have to be very very organized and Carnegie are wonderful at learning us through all the steps to steadily advance the show. It’s not the whirlwind that you might imagine, rather an exercise in methodically chipping away as the date gets closer. Suffice to say, there will inevitably be some harried moments nearer the time but all is going very well so far!! Come to the concert, bring you family, colleagues and everyone you know! There are many discounts available to teachers, medics, veterans, musicians, seniors and students! Just reach out to me...This is about humanity for humanity!! 14) How did the particular group of performers on this recording come together? How many of them will be participating in the Carnegie Hall live premiere? The recording ensemble were mostly employed from the Boston area, have worked with Eugene Friesen or myself in the past and all of them will be among the 56 on the stage! Ironically the rest of the ensemble are from NYC not Boston so there is a healthy mix of amazing talent from the East Coast coming together. All of these singers are professional and perform and record as soloists or in choirs all the time. 15) What are your plans for the immediate future? And, where do you hope to see yourself ten years from now? After Carnegie, we are taking a vacation :) but I’m also in the middle of planning a tour both in America and overseas and I’m composing more already, too! Mainly choral works and more art songs but have many other genres and concepts floating around my head! 16) Are there any questions I have not asked that you wished had been asked? If so, what are those, and how would you answer them? This is a wonderful set of questions! Thank You! I hope I have given some meaningful answers.\n\nVARIOUS REVIEWS AND QUOTES of all of Heidi's Previous Albums MOONLIGHT IN EMPTY ROOMS- BILL BINKELMAN on 1/14/2018 Pianist Heidi Breyer’s husband, Alexander Volkov, is a wonderful painter of exquisite beauty in a style that blends intense neo-realism with a palpable sense of nostalgia. She is immersed in the artistic setting, i.e. surrounded by beautiful paintings from conception to conclusion, so that this environment has not just seeped into her musical persona, but one might say, symbiotically joined with it. It's easy to see why this relationship between his art and her music has evolved since she is in his studio and helps run the business on a daily basis. In Heidi's own words, while watching him paint...\" I see what evolves and if it speaks to me, I'll know it by the middle stages of the painting process. I don't necessarily write something there and then, but when I get a window, if the painting is still haunting me, I will go to my studio and be gone for an intense amount of time and will write the piece until I'm satisfied with the concept.” Heidi has been composing music inspired by Alexander’s paintings for ten years now. Finally, the time has come for her to share this special relationship she has with her husband's artwork on Moonlight In Empty Rooms, an amazing achievement in music reflecting images and the emotional impact of both. Breyer singled out twelve compositions and the paintings associated with them, each song titled after that piece of art. Packaging of the album is fantastic, presented as a gorgeous digipack with extremely voluminous and insightful liner notes (including Volkov’s artwork) about each painting’s and each song’s origin and interpretation, as well as an overview of the why and wherefore of the project itself (including a little snippet from Volkov about his artwork). Besides the CD, the digipack features a DVD which directly marries Breyer's music to Volkov's artwork (created with Adobe Premier software). So, you get the added emotional impact of listening to these exquisite neo-classical duets while watching the artwork to which it is linked unfold – a truly immersive experience. Joining Breyer on each of the twelve selections is session violinist extraordinaire, Charlie Bisharat. However, if all you have heard from him is his great work in support of the many Imaginary Road Studio recordings produced by Will Ackerman and Tom Eaton, prepare to hear a whole other side of his violin artistry. Bisharat displays true classical chops and a playing style that will be a revelation to many of his fans, I’d wager. While there is unmistakable classical crossover theme present on the album, I was also (more than once) reminded of classic pop music of the ‘40s, perhaps of the jazz/torch song era. The melodies seemed to evoke that sensation for me. More than once I envisioned a chanteuse singing in an after-hours club, the kind of tragic romantic music that typified that style of music. On the other hand, perhaps that is just my personal evocation. Regardless, even if one does slot the album into the neo-classical genre, it is most certainly romantic music at its core, with only a few moments that elevate into power and drama. Breyer’s control of nuance and shading is a marvel throughout the disc, no matter what tempo, volume, or mood she is playing. Yet, what is just as striking is the sense of intimacy, the immediateness of her performance, especially on the more reflective, pensive tunes. This is when it becomes obvious how deeply felt these compositions are to her and how intermeshed they are in her appreciation and affinity for her husband’s artistic talents. In an email exchange with her, I compared her piano music with Alex’s paintings as two strands of DNA, intertwined to yield a single trait. Singling out specific tracks is akin to singling out one of Volkov’s paintings, i.e. it would be more a matter of how one song struck you and less of an evaluative process. Yes, some tracks here touch me more deeply, such as pensive and gently melancholic “Autumn Snowfall,” but I believe Moonlight In Empty Rooms plays best as a whole, not as the sum of its admittedly beautiful parts. The opening playfulness on “Autumn in Bruges” leads way to a more wistful and even sad main melody, albeit one with energy and a fast tempo at times. The title track is ushered in by Bisharat’s initial violin solo which gives way to a reflective piano tone poem by Breyer, and soon the two artists pirouette together, dancers in a song that combines a forceful sense of passion with a tangible but subtle feeling of loneliness. As one might expect, “The Sound And The Fury” brims with power and drama, interspersed with brief moments of respite. “Faith” (which unless I am deaf or clueless, features Bisharat multi-tracked) carries distinct hymn-like qualities during his opening solo segment, segueing to Breyer incorporating what sounds like elements of “Praise God of Whom All Blessing Flow;;” not really riffing on it or extrapolating from it, but more using the opening note progression as a jumping off point. It is the longest track on the album and both Breyer and Bisharat play it out as an ode to the power of the titular word. The album closes with the sublime “End Of Summer,” and again, I hear echoes of classic torch songs, but here meshed with a tone poem aesthetic. There is sadness and remembrance at work here, but also fondness of memory. I haven’t even begun to attempt to describe Alexander Volkov’s paintings in this review, but truly, they are an essential aspect of appreciating Heidi Breyer’s music and playing. Again, in her own words, “This is a phenomenon to us and we are quite surprised by its evolution and the fact that it seems to be a living breathing thing that is not going away. It is why we do everything together, suffocating though it might be at times, we breath very much the same inspiration and it goes around in circles between us...” Easily the best work Heidi Breyer has yet recorded, Moonlight In Empty Rooms is as deeply felt and masterfully recorded (piano recorded at Imaginary Road Studios and mixing and mastering by Tom Eaton) an album as I’ve heard this past year. Special seems wholly inadequate in describing this work from a truly gifted artist. __________________________ CONTEMPORARY FUSION REVIEWS Rotcod Zzaj Heidi Breyer with Charlie Bisharat totally stunning piano portraits Heidi Breyer with Charlie Bisharat – MOONLIGHT IN EMPTY ROOMS: The thing that (most) sets Heidi’s lovely piano work apart from all the other gifted artists is her total control of the instrument... and, not in the sense of “rigidity”... it’s just that her playing feels so natural and free because of her pacing... her work with Charlie on violin, especially on the amazing opener, “Unfinished Conversation“, is beyond compare... on this composition, she also demonstrates that she has the POWER to communicate in full glory... check out the wonderfully strong chords she uses at the :41 second mark to talk with Charlie... again – AMAZING! The album is actually an intimate and emotional musical study of the work of her husband, Alexander Volkov, a highly talented visual artist... and the package includes a wonderful DVD that illustrates her ability to reach deep into her soul and paint wonderful portraits with her piano that will stay fixed in your mind eternally... just listen to the composition that moved me to memories of long-ago days in the wintry climes of Northwestern Pennsylvania (where I grew up)... “Autumn Snowfall” is one of the pieces highlighted on the DVD, and you’ll find yourself watching it over and over again, as I did. Heidi’s work has always been a favorite experience;; I’ve reviewed several of her albums, most recently in issue # 165, but this new release is absolutely the best work I’ve ever heard from her. One of the strongest piano/violin works I’ve heard (yet) in 2018 is the 4:17 “The Sound and The Fury“... she and Charlie move and play together perfectly to sonically illustrate one of Alexander’s most powerful visuals... flawless recording and the deep involvement of both players makes this a piece that I believe will be nominated for (and win) awards! The piece that (hands-down) won my vote for personal favorite is the marvelously intricate movement on “Faith“, which features a painting Alexander did of a small church in (of all places) Vermont, where my mother’s parents lived for decades – so, this song has special meaning to me... simple, but beautiful! I give Heidi and Charlie a MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for this excellent hour of creativity, with a (perfect) “EQ” (energy quotient) rating of 5.00... meaning that it also gets my “PICK” for “best piano/violin album”. NEW AGE MUSIC REVIEWS 5/5 Stars Keith “MuzikMan” Hannaleck March 9, 2018 Founder of: MuzikMan Productions Moonlight In Empty Rooms is Heidi Breyer’s fifth proper album. She worked exclusively with Charlie Bisharat, a superb violinist. The combination of piano and violins are not strange bedfellows. They both complement each other exquisitely, just like it was meant to be. It most certainly sounds that way to me when I hear that combination, which is often in the new age genre. The album is a musical tribute to her husband Alexander Volkav’s artwork. I saw a few of the pictures of his work and they are absolutely stunning. They are so lifelike and crystal clear, that you will find it hard to believe that a human being actually painted them. Moonlight In Empty Rooms is like a river of songs moving along as nature would have it. When you see the water from far away it does not look like its moving too fast, as you get closer you can see what is really happening. This music is comparative to that. It is calm and engaging as it gently invites you in. Once you step through that door of complete envelopment in the tracks, you are now moving right along with it, up close and personal. Like the art that Alexander creates, it is placed on a canvas of different shades and colors. Each track is a separate work of art just like her husband’s paintings. I often describe music in this fashion and honestly think the comparison is relative. Art comes in all forms and colors and so does music. You, the listener, are the open canvas ready for the music to create something within your heart, mind, and soul. I think Heidi accomplishes that with this gorgeous music. It comes presented with strong musicianship and accomplished production values. Moonlight In Empty Rooms sets the standard at a high level for instrumental new age and classical recordings. This is as good as it gets. __________________________ DYAN GARRIS for New Age CD.com 2018 This is an undeniably exquisite Neo-classical piano and violin album by award winning composer and pianist, Heidi Breyer. Her 5th album, “Moonlight in Empty Rooms” is twelve tracks, each inspired by the original paintings of her husband, Russian-American oil painter, Alexander Volkov. The violin performances on the album are by Charlie Bisharat, an American Grammy® Award-winning violinist. Bisharat has performed with Yanni, John Tesh, Elton John, The Rolling Stones, and many other notables. The album was produced at Imaginary Road Studios, home to Grammy® winning guitarist, producer, and founder of Windham Hill Records, Will Ackerman. Volkov describes his fine art as “. . .always a story of light traveling through darkness.” “Moonlight in Empty Rooms” is a superb reflection and interpretation of that story, and like rich icing on a luscious cake, it’s the perfect counterpart. A booklet and a DVD both come along with the physical album. The booklet contains images of the artwork with inspirational snippets. The DVD is comprised of 12 videos;; footage of Volkov’s artwork set to Breyer’s exceptional music. Track 1, “An Unfinished Conversation,” opens the album brilliantly and sets the stage for the promise of much more to come. Passionate, emotional, and tender, this feels like the story of a meaningful soul relationship that lasts not only throughout this lifetime, but through eternity, with always more to learn and experience no matter where the road of life leads. Track 3 is the charming, “Autumn in Bruges.” Bruges is a picturesque town in Belgium with a rich medieval history. “Autumn in Bruges” is captivating with its cascading nuances conjuring up images of cobblestone streets, romantic canals, and bell towers. “Moonlight in Empty Rooms” the title track, is full of graceful movement and ambiance, the piano layered sumptuously throughout with the violin. Each nuance and subtlety is carefully coaxed out of hiding and brought forth to blend together in perfect harmony, like expert brushstrokes on a canvas begin to form a masterpiece. You can feel the resultant light right in your heart. The composition, “Rainy Day,” on track 7, is exquisitely beautiful and hauntingly so. It’s a favorite of mine on the album. The violin performance is exceptional, forming a lush tapestry with Breyer’s gentle, evocative, and expressive piano performance. There is something that really speaks to the depths of the soul here. This is peace. Deep and satisfying peace. “End of Summer” winds up the album and reminds us, similarly as in track 1, that even as the light of summer fades, there is always more to come. There is always the story. We love it. Highly and most definitely recommended. __________________________ JONATHAN WIDRAN April 24th 2018 In an overwhelmingly positive review I wrote about Heidi Breyer’s Beyond The Turning – rightfully chosen ZMR’s Best Instrumental Piano Album 2012 – I mentioned that she had been on an extraordinary journey of self-discovery that culminated in this work, which I described as “a heartfelt and evocative, introspective and ultimately universal look at humanity and the sometimes joyous, often embattled path we take to ultimately find our path home.” Listening now, six years later, to Moonlight in Empty Rooms, an epic 12 song new age/neo-classical collection of artful and transcendent, alternately poignant and whimsical pieces driven by her impressions of works by her realist painter husband Alexander Volkov, I realize more than ever what “home” means to this multi-talented artist. Just as we can’t imagine watching films without a score, there’s something emotionally powerful about that place between artistic worlds where music helps our hearts better understand what our eyes may have missed. This album, produced by Heidi with Windham Hill legend Will Ackerman and engineer/mixer extraordinaire Tom Eaton, gives us a rare opportunity to contemplate each work and perhaps dream for several minutes as Heidi takes us on a whirlwind journey with the exquisite harmonies and counterpoint voice of the masterful veteran violinist Charlie Bisharat. Listening to a loving wife envelop her passions around places her husband calls “a space where there’s no tomorrow or yesterday, where there are no projections for the future and no excuses for the past,” I am reminded of something a dear writer friend of mine wrote about his in-laws who were married for 60 years: “They’d grown together like intertwined roots that were never meant to survive a severing.” Heidi’s eloquent liner notes next to each of Alexander’s images serve as something of a guided tour of where the muse takes her and how – but even without those detailed explanations, her pure piano poetry speaks volumes about the meanings of love and life. It might be an interesting experiment to listen to Moonlight in Empty Rooms first, reading along and studying the artwork – and then just hearing the music by itself and going on your own excursion of self-discovery. The set begins with two and a half minutes of beautiful hypnotic ivory meditation before Bisharat’s voice enters the moment, hoping to create a dialogue on a higher level. Heidi responds by alternating tempos as if in search of the perfect way to connect. Alexander finds beauty in the dying of trees amidst a stark winter landscape on “Autumn Snowfall,” which inspires Heidi to create interesting contrasts between moody, shadowy contemplation and a few hopeful high notes as Bisharat swirls about like gently falling snow. “Autumn in Bruges” reflects on that same season but in a whole different way, amidst the many images competing for our attention in Alexander’s late in the day empty street in the famed Belgian city – bicycles, lit and shadowed trees, brick pavement, a distant steeple and inky sky. Heidi captures the lighthearted whimsy of possibility, then eases into a bright waltz-like dance with Bisharat, which rolls like a pleasurable stroll, ripe for new adventures, down the street. As for the heartfelt, gracefully inviting “Christian’s Workshop,” we may not know who Christian was, but Alexander’s painting of a long ago abandoned woodshop, looking out streaked windows into the light, allows us to create a character of our own choosing. Heidi and Alexander work that way, drawing us in to fill out the characters and places they shed cracks of light on. As it flows on, Moonlight in Empty Rooms continues to expand our collective heart’s possibilities, with Heidi creating a lovely, swaying sense of camaraderie with Bisharat, dancing in empty room where lit by distant moonlight on the title track;; celebrating a beloved pet’s peaceful transition from slumber to being awake at “Eastertide”;; letting a gentle rain spark moments of sorrow and wistful nostalgia on a quiet “Rainy Day”;; and, on “The Sound and the Fury,” tackling the deeper roars of nature with passion, power and intensity via intense chords jamming with Bisharat’s hard to pin down flights of fancy. The last third of the album takes us through the seasons, with the gentle unfolding sweetness of a “Winter Rose” giving way to hope for a season of rebirth a “Half Hour before Spring” and concluding with a simply stated reminiscence at the “End of Summer.” Bridging those last two tracks is “Faith,” presented as a deeply lived, internal mood swinging struggle to believe in and understand God, set against the simple image of a country church in a yellow field with storm clouds gathering in rural Vermont. Heidi’s quote about her music is as relevant to her mastery on Moonlight in Empty Rooms as it was when she said it earlier in her career: “I bring to my music, and to everything I do in my life, all that I am and all that I have experienced -- and I’m finding in music that approach leads to success more often than in life. I bring every emotion, including those I share as a student, parent and teacher, those I give when I love and those private alone times, which if it weren’t for the music, might be forgotten. I feel completely privileged and honored to be on this journey and feel the adrenaline and excitement of it all when I’m at the piano composing.” The Moonlight in Empty Rooms Package includes a DVD with videos that delve deeper into the album's theme and official subtitle, \"A Musical Study of the Art of Alexander Volkov.\" LETTERS FROM FAR AWAY 2015 PRESS RELEASE 2015 For “Letters From Far Away” Press inquiries: Glass Onyon PR, PH: 828-350-8158, glassonyonpr@gmail.com Pianist and Composer Heidi Breyer Releases A Breathtaking New Album “Letters From Far Away” Featuring Legendary Will Ackerman “The music is at once technically breathtaking and emotionally intimate. A rare and wonderful combination.” – Will Ackerman Frenchtown, NJ – Pianist and composer Heidi Breyer has released a breathtaking new album of unparalleled beauty titled “Letters From Far Away.” The new release is a double solo and piano instrumental album and Heidi’s debut production alongside legendary Will Ackerman (Founder Windham Hill Records) and Tom Eaton. The album was recorded, mixed and mastered at Imaginary Road Studios in Vermont and Studio Sound in LA. Says Heidi, “ ‘Letters From Far Away’ is my musical interpretation of a handful of experiences in the story of one couple, each from different countries, who met in 1960 and after 5 years apart, against all odds, walked the rest of their lives together. It is also about love in all it’s forms, how love is the common denominator that transcends time and links the generations over the course of decades. It is the one thing that connects us.all.” Winner of ZMR Best Instrumental piano Album 2012, Nominated ZMR Best Holiday Album 2011, Winner of ZMR Best Instrumental Piano Album 2010 and Best New Artist 2010, Heidi Breyer has four albums to her credit – Winter Light 2009, Another Place and Time 2010, Beyond The Turning 2012, Letters From Far Away 2015. She has performed on stages worldwide and opened the first ever live ZMR Awards show performing with Premik Russell- (Sting), Jill Haley and Michael Ronstadt. Her music has been featured on many compilations including the Grammy Nominated Album for Best Spoken Word, “The Storm King” an Auto Biographical Narration by the late Pete Seeger, Produced by Jeff Haynes, also The Gathering (West River Records), Many Miles Music (Seattle based label) and Sounds of The Circle by Suzanne Doucet. British born and conservatory educated at Trinity College of Music in London, Heidi Breyer now resides in the artistic community of Frenchtown, NJ, an inspiring setting where she composes her music, prepares for her multi-media concerts, teaches and manages the business of world-renowned Russian painter, Alexander Volkov. “Heidi Breyer continues to amaze with her evolution as a composer and as a performer. The range of styles represented in Letters From Far Away is considerable, but like the outer planets in our solar system, these are held together by the gravity and persuasion of Breyer’s Artistic Voice.” – Will Ackerman, Grammy winning Guitarist, Producer, Imaginary Road Studios and founder of Windham Hill Records. And now, in 2015, Heidi has released her most stunning achievement to date, the new album “Letters From Far Away”! Says Heidi, “I wrote the entire collection with the intention of releasing my first piano solo project. But in the very first session the opportunity for some major counter- melody from other specific instruments was revealing itself to me. The main instrumental voices that I was imagining were cello, violin, guitar and English Horn, mostly because I have worked with these sounds before and have an understanding of their capacity for expression within my music. Clarinet was non-negotiable on Small Cafe. Every time I hear that instrument it propels me back in time and for that piece as with all others, it was the only option. Then saxophone, french horn and bass guitar...all came very naturally... “Will Ackerman has amazing perceptual awareness. He has mentored me for several years now, both in regard to my music and helping me to further discover and push my own development as an artist. He knows when to step back and when to guide. As this project progressed he was clearly observing my need for specifics...not just instrumentally but also melodically, harmonically and rhythmically and yet he also knew when to bring forth his knowledge and experience for the better. Along with Tom Eaton’s own depth of production experience, I think we made a pretty good team! All the session players I work with are in their own right top-shelf artists. Many of them are on all of my albums. They really listened, understood and interpreted accurately and delivered, in my opinion, flawlessly. The list of players I worked with (and hope to again) include but are not limited to Eugene Friesen, Jill Haley, Charlie Bisharat, Gus Sebring, Mark Schulman, Will Ackerman.” Here’s what’s being said about Heidi Breyer’s “Letters From Far Away”: “ ‘Letters From Far Away’ is a love story that began more than five decades ago across the briny Atlantic. For the world, it was a time of new beginnings. For the lovers it was the birth of something so inexplicable that neither poets with their rhymes, nor philosophers with their thoughts could define it. Until now. It would take extraordinary music to explain it. Enter pianist Heidi Breyer. She takes on the monumental task of telling a story that does not appear in known fairytales, but in the chronicles of the heart. Using her incredible composition skills, she offers not one, but two eleven-track disks of solo piano and its companion instrumental pieces. She takes on the role of bard, storyteller, musician, and singer – a modern day Scheherazade. The contemporary music is twenty-two glimpses into the history of lovers that came from two different worlds and whose devotion was strong enough and endured long enough to build a single world of love. Let us meet the lovers.” – RJ Lannen, Zone Music Reporter “A new release by Heidi Breyer is always worth waiting for, but this time she has out done herself and her deeply meaningful creation of Letters from far Away, will be regarded by her fans and the followers of piano based music, as real raising of the musical bar, her many listeners, of which I urge you to be one of, will be deeply moved for an eternity by this incredible release.” – Steve Sheppard, OWMR “Heidi Breyer’s ‘Letters From Far Away’ is an amazing collection of lovely piano based music. I particularly loved the idea of having a double CD set- One with Solo Piano versions and the other with subtle arrangements. Being a musician I could see the tremendous amount of attention to detail that has gone into the writing and performance. As a pure listener, I loved the option to chose which CD to listen to based on my mood. Overall a fantastic musical experience and I wish Heidi all the best for this wonderful work.” – Ricky Kej, Grammy Winner Producer, 2015 of New Age Album of the year, (Winds of Samsara) “Heidi has provided us with a treasure trove of beautiful recorded music, as well as an upcoming fifth CD to look forward to. Heidi Breyer is a truly remarkable instrumentalist and composer whose expressive and melodic range is impressive, as is her emotionally evocative touch on the keyboard. Letters From Far Away is musical storytelling at its best and illuminates the talents of a rising star in the piano world. – Michael Diamond, Music and Media Focus.” “Heidi’s music is the perfect synthesis of academia and passion. This is music informed by years of study and a rich life. The music is at once technically breathtaking and emotionally intimate. A rare and wonderful combination.” – Will Ackerman In closing Heidi has this to impart, “Music is an elixir for life, love, catharsism and general well being. Always has been and always will be... My music is written to nourish and combat the impact of today’s crazy, restless world, but it is not music for meditation relaxation...I do not strive to help empty the mind through musical meditation. There is a lot of great New Age Music that already does this successfully. I present an alternative perspective, deliver a brief but thoughtful departure to another life imagined through the music, and bring the listener back through the same escape route to reality, feeling a refreshed and grounded in their real lives. I believe the New Age music genre is breaking through to a new era at the very moment it is needed. We know that certain types of music are a part of most peoples daily balancing act. But in addition, we are observing that our human psyche is evolving and we are using our core (our soul, our intuition) to guide us more and more and not just our 5 known senses (that tell us the immediate things)...I believe our instinctive leaning toward New Age music contributes to that ‘beacon’. It is music for our lifestyles. It is one of the facets of the balancing act that we will become more and more reliant upon, almost medicinally. I for one, know that I am someone who can help in that regard. So the message is...check out New Age Music. Check out all of my music and see how it can truly help you.” BEYOND THE TURNING 2012 HOT INDIE NEWS KEITH CHACHKES – 8/5/14 Epic. Somber. Introspective. Deep. Enigmatic. Whimsical. These are a few of the terms I might use to describe the piano stylings of HEIDI BREYER. However, simply trying to boil down all of her talents as a thoughtful player and songwriter down to the bare essence may not quite do justice to the masterpiece that is her third album, Beyond the Turning...read more Culling together her many influences from Classical, Jazz, New Age and Progressive Rock (channeling the late Richard Wright of PINK FLOYD at times), Heidi truly does “paint in sound” as her biography suggests. Using the emotional framework of the events in the world the last few years as a sonic allegory of sorts, Beyond the Turning takes your soul on a journey of discovery. The heartfelt opener “Farewell” has a sense of calming dismay to it and sets the mood for the majority of the album. “World Without End” continues the trek inward, slowly uncovering feelings of peace and resolve in its musical DNA. Breyer has a jazz master’s touch when it comes to song craft and certainly her romantic side comes through in place like the soothing “Rive Droite”. Other tracks such as “The Long Way Home (Passage 1)”,“My Peace Piece” and “Eight Steps Free” have a nice laid back, soulful quality that tie the album together nicely. Not only does Heidi have a splendid voice, she augments her performance with the heavenly sounds of Samite. She has an all-star team of talents pitching in to help, who take many excellent songs to the next level like cellist Eugene Friesen, violinist Charlie Bisharat, superstar bassist Michael Manring (solo bass on “Joy of The Road”), Jill Haley’s horn playing and David Cullen’s immense guitar work among others. Among the top tracks of the album “Tea and Sympathy”, “Moondancing”, “Adungu Inspiration” and the title track wind down the album in top notch fashion. These songs are full of little stories, each measure further revealing memories and feelings that will surely stir in the coldest souls out there. __________________________ ANOTHER PLACE AND TIME 2010 BILL BINKELMAN - ZMR Even when compared to the unbelievably high quality of music evidenced on most of the recordings that issue forth from Imaginary Road studios and the production team of Will Ackerman and Corin Nelsen, pianist Heidi Anne Breyer‘s Another Place and Time... is a superlative album. This one of those CDs that, as soon as I made it through the first three cuts, I knew it was going to land a special place on “permanently playable” shelf. Similar in mood and style to Tim Story’s “tragic beauty trilogy” (Beguiled, The Perfect Flaw, and Shadowplay), yet also more diverse (owing to the presence of more accompanists than Story’sCDs featured), Another Place and Time... is a highly introspective album, absolutely perfect for the seasons of late autumn and early winter, when many of us retreat into ourselves and our dwellings, to pause, reflect, remember, and (for some of us) regret. There is a distinctly discernible melancholic mood which permeates the music, although not in such a way that will bring the listener down as much as invite the listener “in.” In addition to the somberness of the music (one of the traits Breyer shares with Story) another is the minimalism of the piano itself. While there are no electronic keyboards (which Story uses), Ackerman enlisted many of his usual suspects as guest artists, among them Jill Haley on English horn, Jeff Oster on trumpet and flugelhorn, Eugene Friesen on cello, Noah Wilding on vocals, and the estimable Charlie Bisharat on violin. It goes without saying that everyone here performs at their characteristic high level (there must be something in the water at Imaginary Roads). There is one solo piano track and one which is solo but on which Breyer also sings and plays recorder (two songs with lyrics are on the album, but the vocals are submerged enough that instrumental music lovers should not be deterred). I couldn’t pick a favorite track on this CD for the life of me. All Souls Lullaby opens the album and the piano/English horn (Haley) duet is heartbreakingly beautiful and flows with genuine sadness. On His Wings features Oster and Bisharat and is actually even more somber (Bisharat, who usually swirls and flits with abandon, distinguishes himself here with his grace and subtlety). The two vocal numbers are Conversation and And Winter Came (the tune on which Breyer goes solo but also sings and plays recorder). I do have a complaint with these two tracks, and it’s that the vocals are submerged too deeply in the mix. There are lyrics and when you bury the singing this deep in the mix, what’s the point? Wise up, Ackerman and Nelsen—if you’re going to include vocal songs, let the listener hear what the lyrics are saying. Oster shines on American Gothic and Winter Light (he usually plays more of a background role on Imaginary Road releases) which I was glad to hear, since he is so damn talented. Ackerman’s In A Region Of Clouds has the composer himself sitting in on guitar and joining Breyer who perfectly complements him. There’s even a track without any piano at all, i.e. So It Was (penned by Breyer), a restrained, sparse, late night serenade played by guitarist David Cullen. I could go on praising Another Place and Time... but all you need to know is that, despite my nit about how the vocals are mixed, I still think this CD is damn near perfect. If I could have only this one album to play while staying for a weekend at a North Shore (Minnesota) cabin on Lake Superior in late October, it would be more than enough. Breyer’s playing is the perfect juxtaposition of subtle nuance and deep emotion—there is not one wasted note. Another Place and Time... is a rare gem, a gift from the artist to souls like me who hunger for the quieter, more introspective side of music which leads us into our own places and times, filled with memories and wishes. ____________________________________________________________________________ SHEILA MARIE, YAHOO CONTRIBUTOR NETWORK . Sept. 14, 2011 Heidi explores the New Age ambiances and subtleties of the piano — and other instruments and performers — to near perfection on her most recent release, Another Place and Time... Heidi Anne Breyer is a classically-trained instrumentalist who creates New Age compositions and original, entrancing melodies. Based in the US and born in the UK, Heidi takes an international approach to music composition with influences stemming from Chopin, Bach, and Rachmaninoff to modern performers, whether intentional or not, including Bill Evans, Keith Jarrett and George Winston. Heidi’s classical training is paramount for her success, though it is not always in the forefront. At times, her music crosses and parallels New Age, classical, neo- classical, instrumental, neo-jazz, and experimental lines without losing the warmth, charm, and inspirational moods of the compositions. Heidi explores the New Age ambiances and subtleties of the piano — and other instruments and performers — to near perfection on her most recent release, Another Place and Time. Grammy® Award-winning producer, musician, and Windham Hill Records founder, William Ackerman, lends his talents to this production, and also performs a poignant guitar piece, with Heidi on piano. Released by Winterhall Records in 2010, Another Place and Time hearkens back to a time of classical simplicity and sweetness seldom heard in contemporary New Age music. Notably, the Zone Music Reporter (ZMR) voted Heidi as the Best New Artist for 2010, while her album garnered Best Instrumental Album: Piano. A review by Bill Binkelman calls it, “a rare gem, a gift from the artist to souls...who hunger for the quieter, more introspective side of music which leads us into our own places and times, filled with memories and wishes.” Furthermore, Another Place and Time contains an award-winning ensemble that adds depth, texture, and tonality to the already breath-taking piano compositions. Heidi’s piano (and vocals) are also joined by David Cullen on guitar;; Eugene Friesen on cello;; Jeff Oster on flugelhorn;; Jill Haley on English horn;; Noah Wilding on vocals, and Charlie Bisharat on violin. The cover artwork of a piano and Heidi with her eyes down reflect a humble, classy, and professional character that clearly matches her music on all accords. Another Place and Time is largely contemporary in tone with noticeable filmic qualities that could easily be included in the latest dramatic film soundtrack or score. In fact, Corin Nelsen says, “Heidi’s music is contemplative and very cinematic...you can feel within it that crucial moment when the lens pulls back and the lead character realizes a huge emotional change and redirects the course of the rest of the film.” Interestingly, Heidi cites Alexander Volkov, a Russian Realist, as inspiration for five of the tracks. Volkov’s paintings of nostalgia, longing, and emptiness, draw comparisons to the musical ‘colors’ inherent in Heidi’s work from an annotative perspective. Corin adds, “Hints of Jazz and Blues add new colors to her already breathtaking soundscape. Heidi’s early formative years were linked through music, dance, and drama at the Arts Educational School in Hertfordshire, UK and later at Trinity College of Music in London. As an adult, Heidi’s music career largely involved teaching piano, performing recitals, accompanying chamber and choral groups, and playing the church organ;; she also teaches violin, voice, and music lessons. Importantly, the transformative effects of music can occur at any age, and several years ago, Heidi experienced the explosion of creativity that led to her composing and recording career. Prior to Another Place and Time, Heidi recorded a debut, holiday album titled Winter Light in 2009 that featured traditional and original compositions touching on the Christmas season. Heidi contemplates, “Our creations are an affirmation of life...whatever form they take, they are the legacy we leave, reflecting the most poignant moments of our short time here.” Heidi believes, “As children we perceive music very physically and allow it to carry us away to a different place...” Perhaps a ‘different place’ conjures up images of another place and time: a place where the sound of Heidi’s piano satisfies a deep yearning for reflective jubilation in everyone’s lives. Currently, Heidi is recording a new album with Grammy® Award-winning producer and recording engineer Corin Nelsen, and is also producing a DVD collection of her music set to Alexander Volkov’s paintings. Another Place and Time and Winter Light are available on the artist’s website at www.heidibreyer.com, on Amazon, iTunes, CDBaby, and via New Leaf Distributing (http://newleaf-dist.com/) for specialty retailers;; she also has a Music/Band page on Facebook under Heidi Anne Breyer."
