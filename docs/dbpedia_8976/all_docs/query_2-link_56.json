        "text": "liquid dreamy watercolor touch Jeff Oster Vin Downes Tom Eaton – SEVEN CONVERSATIONS: 2024 is definitely turning out to be a banner year for creative music… a new album, releasing on 26 April, 2024, features three masters of that creativity… Jeff on flugelhorn and trumpet, Vin doing electric guitar and Tom playing keyboards, loops, programming and bass is the epitome of the liquid dreamy watercolor touch that truly attracts the ear. Here’s a sneak peek at the album…\n\nYou’ll find many more performances when you SUBSCRIBE to Jeff’s channel on YouTube… I’ve been there for years.\n\nJeff’s amazing works have been reviewed here many times, as well as Tom’s solid creations… Vin’s superb guitar was reviewed a while back, too. The new album pulls their spirits together in one of the most insightful and moving collaborations you will ever listen to… I particularly enjoyed the 5:06 “words overheard“, and have no doubt you will find yourself immersed in it as deeply as I was by the second measure!\n\nAfter my third listen through the entire album, it was easy to make my choice for personal favorite of the seven superb songs offered up… the 11:20 closer, “hours slip by“, wraps the listener in envelopes of sonic beauty and will hold you completely spellbound… Tom’s electronics on this tune help to drive it deeply into your mind (and your soul)… l have no doubt that this wonderful song will be nominated for (and WIN) awards.\n\nThere are few groups/artists in the ambient arena who stand the test of time… this trio is one of them… I give Jeff, Vin and Tom a MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED rating, with a (perfect) “EQ” (energy quotient) score of 5.00. That means, of course, that they get a “PICK” from me for “best ambient release”. You can PRE-SAVE the album here; also, watch Jeff’s Spotify channel (below) as the release date gets closer, or visit the Bandcamp page for the album.\n\nseven conversations by jeff oster, vin downes, tom eaton\n\np.s. You’ll find MANY MORE performances here, too:\n\nJeff’s music and more:"
