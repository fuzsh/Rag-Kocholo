        "text": "Abstract\n\nPurpose: To assess the safety and efficacy of a ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) intraocular implant on neuroprotection and neuroenhancement in glaucoma.Design: Open-label, prospective, phase I clinical trial.Participants: A total of 11 participants were diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). One eye of each patient was assigned as the study (implant) eye.Methods: The study eye was implanted with a high-dose CNTF-secreting NT-501 implant, whereas the other eye served as a control. All patients were followed up for 18 months. Analysis was limited to descriptive statistics.Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome was safety through 18 months after implantation assessed by serial eye examinations, structural and functional testing, and adverse events (AEs) recording. Parameters measured included visual acuity (VA), Humphrey visual field (HVF), pattern electroretinogram, scanning laser polarimetry with variable corneal compensation (GDx VCC), and OCT. These parameters were also used for secondary analysis of efficacy outcome.Results: All NT-501 implants were well tolerated with no serious AEs associated with the implant. The majority of AEs were related to the implant placement procedure and were resolved by 12 weeks after surgery. Foreign-body sensation was the most commonly reported AE and was self-limited to the postoperative period. The most common implant-related AE was pupil miosis; no patients underwent explant. Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity decreased more in fellow eyes than in study eyes (VA,-5.82 vs.-0.82 letters; and contrast sensitivity,-1.82 vs.-0.37 letters, for fellow vs. study eyes, respectively). The median HVF visual field index and mean deviation measurements worsened (decreased) in fellow eyes (-13.0%,-3.9 dB) and improved (increased) in study eyes (2.7%, 1.2 dB). Implanted eyes showed an increase in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measured by OCT and by GDx VCC (OCT, 2.66 mum vs. 10.16 mum; and GDx VCC, 1.58mumvs. 8.36mum in fellow vs. study eyes, respectively).Conclusions: The NT-501 CNTF implant was safe and well tolerated in eyes with POAG. Eyes with the implant demonstrated both structural and functional improvements suggesting biological activity, supporting the premise for a randomized phase II clinical trial of single and dual NT-501 CNTF implants in patients with POAG, which is now underway.Financial Disclosures: Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xops.2023.100298\n\nView details for PubMedID 37197702\n\nAbstract\n\nRetinal ganglion cells (RGCs) die after optic nerve trauma or in degenerative disease. However, acute changes in protein expression that may regulate RGC response to injury are not fully understood, and detailed methods to quantify new protein synthesis have not been tested. Here we develop and apply a new in vivo quantitative measure of newly synthesized proteins to examine changes occurring in the retina after optic nerve injury. Azidohomoalanine (AHA), a noncanonical amino acid, was injected intravitreally into the eyes of rodents of either sex with or without optic nerve injury. Isotope variants of biotin-alkyne were used for quantitative BONCAT (QBONCAT) mass spectrometry, allowing identification of protein synthesis and transport rate changes in over 1000 proteins at 1 or 5 days after optic nerve injury. In vitro screening showed several newly synthesized proteins regulate axon outgrowth in primary neurons in vitro This novel approach to targeted quantification of newly synthesized proteins after injury uncovers a dynamic translational response within broader proteostasis regulation and enhances our understanding of the cellular response to injury.Significance Statement:Optic nerve injury results in death and degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. The specific cellular response to injury, including changes in new protein synthesis, is obscured by existing proteins and protein degradation. In this study, we introduce QBONCAT to isolate and quantify acute protein synthesis and subsequent transport between cellular compartments. We identify novel candidate protein effectors of the regenerative response and uncover their regulation of axon growth in vitro, validating the utility of QBONCAT for the discovery of novel regulatory and therapeutic candidates after optic nerve injury.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3100-20.2022\n\nView details for PubMedID 35396330\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Diversity in the ophthalmology profession is important when providing care for an increasingly diverse patient population. However, implicit bias may inadvertently disadvantage underrepresented applicants during resident recruitment and selection.Objective: To evaluate the association of the redaction of applicant identifiers with the review scores on ophthalmology residency applications as an intervention to address implicit bias.Design, Setting, and Participants: In this quality improvement study, 46 faculty members reviewed randomized sets of 462 redacted and unredacted applications from a single academic institution during the 2019-2020 ophthalmology residency application cycle.Interventions: Applications electronically redacted for applicant identifiers, including name, sex or gender, race and ethnicity, and related terms.Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was the distribution of scores on redacted and unredacted applications, stratified by applicant's sex, underrepresentation in medicine (URiM; traditionally comprising American Indian or Alaskan Native, Black, and Hispanic individuals) status, and international medical graduate (IMG) status; the application score beta coefficients for redaction and the applicant and reviewer characteristics were calculated. Applications were scored on a scale of 1 to 9, where 1 was the best score and 9 was the worst score. Scores were evaluated for a significant difference based on redaction among female, URiM, and IMG applicants. Linear regression was used to evaluate the adjusted association of redaction, self-reported applicant characteristics, and reviewer characteristics with scores on ophthalmology residency applications.Results: In this study, 277 applicants (60.0%) were male and 71 (15.4%) had URiM status; 32 faculty reviewers (69.6%) were male and 2 (0.4%) had URiM status. The distribution of scores was similar for redacted vs unredacted applications, with no difference based on sex, URiM status, or IMG status. Applicant's sex, URiM status, and IMG status had no association with scores in multivariable analysis (sex, beta=-0.08; 95% CI, -0.32 to 0.15; P=.26; URiM status, beta=-0.03; (95% CI, -0.36 to 0.30; P=.94; and IMG status, beta=0.39; 95% CI, -0.24 to 1.02; P=.35). In adjusted regression, redaction was not associated with differences in scores (beta=-0.06 points on a 1-9 scale; 95% CI, -0.22 to 0.10 points; P=.48). Factors most associated with better scores were attending a top 20 medical school (beta=-1.06; 95% CI, -1.37 to -0.76; P<.001), holding an additional advanced degree (beta=-0.86; 95% CI, -1.22 to -0.50; P<.001), and having a higher United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 score (beta=-0.35 per 10-point increase; 95% CI, -0.45 to -0.26; P<.001).Conclusions and Relevance: This quality improvement study did not detect an association between the redaction of applicant characteristics on ophthalmology residency applications and the application review scores among underrepresented candidates at this institution. Although the study may not have been powered adequately to find a difference, these findings suggest that the association of redaction with application review scores may be preempted by additional approaches to enhance diversity, including pipeline programs, implicit bias training, diversity-centered culture and priorities, and targeted applicant outreach. Programs may adapt this study design to probe their own application screening biases and track over time before-and-after bias-related interventions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2021.4323\n\nView details for PubMedID 34673889\n\nAbstract\n\nNo approved therapies directly target retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) for neuroprotection or neuroenhancement in glaucoma. Recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) has been shown to promote RGC survival and function in animal models of optic neuropathy. Here we evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of short-term, high-dose rhNGF eye drops versus placebo in a cohort of glaucoma patients.This study is a single-center, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel group study designed to assess safety and tolerability as well as short-term neuroenhancement of structure and function (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02855450). Sixty open-angle glaucoma patients were randomized 40:20 to receive either 180 μg/ml rhNGF or vehicle control eye drops in both eyes, three times daily for 8 weeks, with a 24-week post-treatment follow-up. One eye was officially selected as the study eye, although both eyes were studied and dosed. Primary endpoints were safety, as assessed through adverse events, and tolerability, as assessed through patient reported outcomes. Secondary outcome measures included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Humphrey visual field (HVF), electroretinogram (ERG), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness at baseline, after 8 weeks of treatment, and at 4 and 24 weeks after treatment (12- and 32-weeks total).Of the 60 randomized subjects, 23 were female (38%) and the average age was 66.1 years. Through week 32, there were no treatment-related serious adverse events, including no unexpectedly severe progression of optic neuropathy, no adverse events affecting ocular function or pressure, and no drug-related systemic toxicity. Topical high-dose rhNGF was tolerated well, with low level of symptom burden mainly eliciting periocular ache (in 52% of treated, 5% of placebo) and only 3 patients (7.5%) discontinuing treatment due to discomfort, out of whom 1 patient (2.5%) prematurely withdrawing from the study. There were no statistically significant differences in global indices of HVF, and no meaningful differences in total, quadrant, or clock-hour mean RNFL thickness between the groups, although both of these function and structure measures showed non-significant trends towards significance in favor of rhNGF. Real-world participant data was used to generate an estimate of cohort size needed to power subsequent studies.rhNGF is safe and tolerable in a topical 180 μg/ml formulation. Although no statistically significant short-term neuroenhancement was detected in this trial, given the strong effects of NGF in preclinical models and trends detected in this study, analysis for efficacy in a neuroprotection trial is warranted.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajo.2021.11.002\n\nView details for PubMedID 34780798\n\nAbstract\n\nPurpose: The goal of the present experiments was to determine whether electrophysiologic response properties of the ON and OFF visual pathways observed in animal experimental models can be observed in humans.Methods: Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were recorded in response to equivalent magnitude contrast increments and decrements presented within a probe-on-pedestal Westheimer sensitization paradigm. The probes were modulated with sawtooth temporal waveforms at a temporal frequency of 3 or 2.73 Hz. SSVEP response waveforms and response spectra for incremental and decremental stimuli were analyzed as a function of stimulus size and visual field location in 67 healthy adult participants.Results: SSVEPs recorded at the scalp differ between contrast decrements and increments of equal Weber contrast: SSVEP responses were larger in amplitude and shorter in latency for contrast decrements than for contrast increments. Both increment and decrement responses were larger for displays that were scaled for cortical magnification.Conclusions: In a fashion that parallels results from the early visual system of cats and monkeys, two key properties of ON versus OFF pathways found in single-unit recordings are recapitulated at the population level of activity that can be observed with scalp electrodes, allowing differential assessment of ON and OFF pathway activity in human.Translational Relevance: As data from preclinical models of visual pathway dysfunction point to differential damage to subtypes of retinal ganglion cells, this approach may be useful in future work on disease detection and treatment monitoring.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1167/tvst.9.10.6\n\nView details for PubMedID 32953246\n\nAbstract\n\nDuring development, newly-differentiated neurons undergo several morphological and physiological changes to become functional, mature neurons. Physiologic maturation of neuronal cells derived from isolated stem or progenitor cells may provide insight into maturation in vivo but is not well studied. As a step towards understanding how neuronal maturation is regulated, we studied the developmental switch of response to the neurotransmitter GABA, from excitatory depolarization to inhibitory hyperpolarization. We compared acutely isolated retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) at various developmental stages and RGCs differentiated in vitro from embryonic retinal progenitors for the effects of aging and, independently, of retinal environment age on their GABAA receptor (GABAAR) responses, elicited by muscimol. We found that neurons generated in vitro from progenitors exhibited depolarizing, immature GABA responses, like those of early postnatal RGCs. As progenitor-derived neurons aged from 1 to 3 weeks, their GABA responses matured. Interestingly, signals secreted by the early postnatal retina suppressed acquisition of mature GABA responses. This suppression was not associated with changes in expression of GABAAR or of the chloride co-transporter KCC2, but rather with inhibition of KCC2 dimerization in differentiating neurons. Taken together, these data indicate GABA response maturation depends on release of inhibition by developmentally regulated diffusible signals from the retina.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41598-020-58120-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 32047174\n\nAbstract\n\nFollowing ocular trauma or in diseases such as glaucoma, irreversible vision loss is due to the death of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons. Although strategies to replace these lost cells include stem cell replacement therapy, few differentiated stem cells turn into RGC-like neurons. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of RGC differentiation in vivo may improve outcomes of cell transplantation by directing the fate of undifferentiated cells toward mature RGCs. Here, we report a new mechanism by which growth and differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a ligand in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, strongly promotes RGC differentiation in the developing retina in vivo in rodent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). This effect is in direct contrast to the closely related ligand GDF-11, which suppresses RGC-fate specification. We find these opposing effects are due in part to GDF-15's ability to specifically suppress Smad-2, but not Smad-1, signaling induced by GDF-11, which can be recapitulated by pharmacologic or genetic blockade of Smad-2 in vivo to increase RGC specification. No other retinal cell types were affected by GDF-11 knockout, but a slight reduction in photoreceptor cells was observed by GDF-15 knockout in the developing retina in vivo. These data define a novel regulatory mechanism of GDFs' opposing effects and their relevance in RGC differentiation and suggest a potential approach for advancing ESC-to-RGC cell-based replacement therapies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cub.2019.05.011\n\nView details for PubMedID 31155355\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study examined whether short-term use of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or steroid therapy affected the efficacy of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT).Double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, dual-center, multisurgeon trial.Patients older than 18 years with intraocular pressure (IOP) of more than 18 mmHg for whom the clinician decided SLT was the appropriately indicated therapy were randomized to 1 of 3 groups in a ratio of 1:1:1 as follows: ketorolac 0.5%, prednisolone 1%, or saline tears.After SLT, patients randomized into each group were instructed to use an unmarked drop 4 times daily starting the day of SLT and continuing for 4 additional days. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for continuous variables when comparing 2 or 3 treatment groups, respectively. The Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables.The primary outcome of this study was IOP at 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included IOP at 1 and 6 weeks, patient-reported pain, and detectable anterior chamber inflammation.Ninety-six eyes of 85 patients fit inclusion criteria and were enrolled between the 2 sites. The NSAID, steroid, and placebo groups were similar in baseline demographics and baseline IOP (mean, 23.3±3.9 mmHg; P = 0.57). There was no statistically significant difference in IOP decrease among groups at week 6. Both the NSAID and steroid groups showed a statistically significantly greater decrease in IOP at week 12 compared with the placebo group (mean, -6.2±3.1 mmHg, -5.2±2.7 mmHg, and -3±4.3 mmHg, respectively; P = 0.02 [analysis of variance] and P = 0.002 [t test] for NSAID vs. placebo groups; P = 0.02 for steroid vs. placebo groups).Significantly better IOP reduction at 12 weeks was measured in eyes treated with steroid or NSAID drops after SLT. Short-term postoperative use of NSAID or steroid drops may improve IOP reduction after SLT. Longer-term follow-up studies are indicated.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ophtha.2019.05.032\n\nView details for PubMedID 31444008\n\nAbstract\n\nCorneal endothelial dysfunction leads to corneal edema, pain, and vision loss. Adequate animal models are needed to study the safety and efficacy of novel cell therapies as an alternative to corneal transplantation.Primary human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs) were isolated from cadaveric donor corneas, expanded in vitro, transduced to express green fluorescent protein (GFP), loaded with superparamagnetic nanoparticles, and injected into the anterior chamber of adult rabbits immediately after endothelial cell or Descemet's membrane stripping. The same volume of balanced salt solution plus (BSS+) was injected in control eyes. We compared different models for inducing corneal edema in rabbits, and examined the ability of transplanted HCECs to reduce corneal edema over time by measuring central corneal thickness and tracking corneal clarity. GFP-positive donor cells were tracked in vivo using optical coherence tomography (OCT) fluorescence angiography module, and the transplanted cells were confirmed by human nuclei immunostaining.Magnetic HCECs integrated onto the recipient corneas with intact Descemet's membrane, and donor identity was confirmed by GFP expression and immunostaining for human nuclei marker. Donor HCECs formed a monolayer on the posterior corneal surface and expressed HCEC functional markers of tight junction formation. No GFP-positive cells were observed in the trabecular meshwork or on the iris, and intraocular pressure remained stable through the length of the study.Our results demonstrate magnetic cell-based therapy efficiently delivers HCECs to restore corneal transparency without detectable toxicity or adverse effect on intraocular pressure. Magnetic delivery of HCECs may enhance corneal function and should be explored further for human therapies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1167/iovs.18-26001\n\nView details for PubMedID 31158276\n\nAbstract\n\nIntraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering ophthalmic solutions that inhibit Rho-associated protein kinases (Rock) and norepinephrine transporters (Net) are currently under clinical evaluation. Here we evaluate topical application of one such drug for its effects on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival and axon regeneration after optic nerve crush injury. We performed unilateral optic nerve crush on young rats (P18) and topically applied Rock/Net inhibitor AR-13324 or placebo 3 times a day for 14 days. IOP was measured starting 3 days before and up to 9 days after injury. On day 12, cholera toxin B (CTB) was injected intravitreally to trace optic nerve regeneration. On day 14, retinas and optic nerves were collected. The retinas were flat-mounted and stained with RBPMS to quantify RGC survival and the optic nerves were sectioned for optic nerve axon quantification using fluorescent and confocal microscopy. Rock phosphorylation targets implicated in axon growth including cofilin and LIMK were examined by fluorescence microscopy and quantitative western blotting. AR-13324 lowered IOP as expected. RGC survival and optic nerve axon regeneration were significantly higher with Rock/Net inhibitor treatment compared with placebo. Furthermore, topical therapy decreased Rock target protein phosphorylation in the retinas and proximal optic nerves. These data suggest that topical administration of a Rock/Net inhibitor promotes RGC survival and regeneration after optic nerve injury, with associated molecular changes indicative of posterior drug activity. Coordinated IOP lowering and neuroprotective or regenerative effects may be advantageous in the treatment of patients with glaucoma.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.exer.2016.07.006\n\nView details for PubMedID 27443501\n\nAbstract\n\nThe National Eye Institute (NEI) hosted a workshop on November 19, 2014, as part of the Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI), an NEI-led effort to rapidly expand therapies for eye diseases through coordinated research funding. The central audacious goal aims to demonstrate by 2025 the restoration of usable vision in humans through the regeneration of neurons and neural connections in the eye and visual system. This workshop focused on identifying promising strategies for optic nerve regeneration. Its principal objective was to solicit input on future AGI-related funding announcements, and specifically to ask, where are we now in our scientific progress, and what progress should we reach for in the coming years? A full report was generated as a white paper posted on the NEI Web site; this report summarizes the discussion and outcomes from the meeting and serves as guidance for future funding of research that focuses on optic nerve regeneration.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1167/iovs.15-18500\n\nView details for PubMedID 26990163\n\nAbstract\n\nThe lack of intravital imaging of axonal transport of mitochondria in the mammalian CNS precludes characterization of the dynamics of axonal transport of mitochondria in the diseased and aged mammalian CNS. Glaucoma, the most common neurodegenerative eye disease, is characterized by axon degeneration and the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and by an age-related increase in incidence. RGC death is hypothesized to result from disturbances in axonal transport and in mitochondrial function. Here we report minimally invasive intravital multiphoton imaging of anesthetized mouse RGCs through the sclera that provides sequential time-lapse images of mitochondria transported in a single axon with submicrometer resolution. Unlike findings from explants, we show that the axonal transport of mitochondria is highly dynamic in the mammalian CNS in vivo under physiological conditions. Furthermore, in the early stage of glaucoma modeled in adult (4-mo-old) mice, the number of transported mitochondria decreases before RGC death, although transport does not shorten. However, with increasing age up to 23-25 mo, mitochondrial transport (duration, distance, and duty cycle) shortens. In axons, mitochondria-free regions increase and lengths of transported mitochondria decrease with aging, although totally organized transport patterns are preserved in old (23- to 25-mo-old) mice. Moreover, axonal transport of mitochondria is more vulnerable to glaucomatous insults in old mice than in adult mice. These mitochondrial changes with aging may underlie the age-related increase in glaucoma incidence. Our method is useful for characterizing the dynamics of axonal transport of mitochondria and may be applied to other submicrometer structures in the diseased and aged mammalian CNS in vivo.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.1509879112\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000359738300093\n\nView details for PubMedID 26240337\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4547257\n\nAbstract\n\nFilopodia are 5-10 μm long processes that elongate by actin polymerization, and promote axon growth and guidance by exerting mechanical tension and by molecular signaling. Although axons elongate in response to mechanical tension, the structural and functional effects of tension specifically applied to growth cone filopodia are unknown. Here we developed a strategy to apply tension specifically to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) growth cone filopodia through surface-functionalized, membrane-targeted superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). When magnetic fields were applied to surface-bound SPIONs, RGC filopodia elongated directionally, contained polymerized actin filaments, and generated retrograde forces, behaving as bona fide filopodia. Data presented here support the premise that mechanical tension induces filopodia growth but counter the hypothesis that filopodial tension directly promotes growth cone advance. Future applications of these approaches may be used to induce sustained forces on multiple filopodia or other subcellular microstructures to study axon growth or cell migration. From the clinical editor: Mechanical tension to the tip of filopodia is known to promote axonal growth. In this article, the authors used superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) targeted specifically to membrane molecules, then applied external magnetic field to elicit filopodial elongation, which provided a tool to study the role of mechanical forces in filopodia dynamics and function.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.nano.2014.11.011\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000352081100007\n\nView details for PubMedID 25596077\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4691347\n\nAbstract\n\nTo develop a reliable, reproducible rat model of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION) and study the cellular responses in the optic nerve and retina.Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy was induced in adult rats by photochemically induced ischemia. Retinal and optic nerve vasculature was examined by fluorescein isothiocyanate–dextran extravasation. Tissue sectioning and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the pathologic changes. Retinal ganglion cell survival at different times after PION induction, with or without neurotrophic application, was quantified by fluorogold retrograde labeling.Optic nerve injury was confirmed after PION induction, including local vascular leakage, optic nerve edema, and cavernous degeneration. Immunostaining data revealed microglial activation and focal loss of astrocytes, with adjacent astrocytic hypertrophy. Up to 23%, 50%, and 70% retinal ganglion cell loss was observed at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks, respectively, after injury compared with a sham control group. Experimental treatment by brain-derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor remarkably prevented retinal ganglion cell loss in PION rats. At 3 weeks after injury, more than 40% of retinal ganglion cells were saved by the application of neurotrophic factors.Rat PION created by photochemically induced ischemia is a reproducible and reliable animal model for mimicking the key features of human PION.The correspondence between the features of this rat PION model to those of human PION makes it an ideal model to study the pathophysiologic course of the disease, most of which remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, it provides an optimal model for testing therapeutic approaches for optic neuropathies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/2013.jamaophthalmol.271\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000316684400010\n\nView details for PubMedID 23544206\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4885914\n\nAbstract\n\nPIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are mechanosensitive ion channels that regulate many important physiological processes including vascular blood flow, touch, and proprioception. As the eye is subject to mechanical stress and is highly perfused, these channels may play important roles in ocular function and intraocular pressure regulation. PIEZO channel expression in the eye has not been well defined, in part due to difficulties in validating available antibodies against PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 in ocular tissues. It is also unclear if PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are differentially expressed. To address these questions, we used single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) together with transgenic reporter mice expressing PIEZO fusion proteins under the control of their endogenous promoters to compare the expression and localization of PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 in mouse ocular tissues relevant to glaucoma. We detected both PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 expression in the trabecular meshwork, ciliary body, and in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the retina. Piezo1 mRNA was more abundantly expressed than Piezo2 mRNA in these ocular tissues. Piezo1 but not Piezo2 mRNA was detected in the inner nuclear layer and outer nuclear layer of the retina. Our results suggest that PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are differentially expressed and may have distinct roles as mechanosensors in glaucoma-relevant ocular tissues.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.exer.2023.109675\n\nView details for PubMedID 37820892\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: To investigate outcomes of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).METHODS: Retrospective observational study using U.S. nationwide healthcare insurance claims database. Patients ≥40 years old with at least one HbA1c within one year of POAG diagnosis were included. Diabetic factors associated with POAG progression requiring glaucoma surgery were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for demographic, diabetic and glaucoma factors. T2DM diagnosis and use of either oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin therapy were assessed in association with POAG progression requiring glaucoma surgery.RESULTS: 104,515 POAG patients were included, of which 70,315 (67%) had T2DM. The mean age was 68.9 years (Standard deviation 9.2) and 55% were female. Of those with T2DM, 93% were taking medication (65,468); 95% (62,412) taking oral hypoglycaemic agents, and 34% (22,028) were on insulin. In multivariable analyses, patients with T2DM had a higher hazard of requiring glaucoma surgery (Hazard ratio, HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.09-1.21, p<0.001). Higher mean HbA1c was also a significant predictor of progression requiring glaucoma surgery (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, p<0.001). When evaluating only patients who were taking antidiabetic medication, after adjusting for confounders, insulin use was associated with a 1.20 higher hazard of requiring glaucoma surgery compared to oral hypoglycaemic agents (95% CI 1.14-1.27, p<0.001), but when stratified by HbA1c, this effect was only significant for those with HbA1c>7.5%.CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline HbA1c, particularly in patients taking insulin may be associated with higher rates of glaucoma surgery in POAG.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41433-023-02734-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 37740048\n\nAbstract\n\nRetinal ganglion cell (RGC) death in glaucoma and other optic neuropathies results in irreversible vision loss due to the mammalian central nervous system's limited regenerative capacity. RGC repopulation is a promising therapeutic approach to reverse vision loss from optic neuropathies if the newly introduced neurons can reestablish functional retinal and thalamic circuits. In theory, RGCs might be repopulated through the transplantation of stem cell-derived neurons or via the induction of endogenous transdifferentiation. The RGC Repopulation, Stem Cell Transplantation, and Optic Nerve Regeneration (RReSTORe) Consortium was established to address the challenges associated with the therapeutic repair of the visual pathway in optic neuropathy. In 2022, the RReSTORe Consortium initiated ongoing international collaborative discussions to advance the RGC repopulation field and has identified five critical areas of focus: (1) RGC development and differentiation, (2) Transplantation methods and models, (3) RGC survival, maturation, and host interactions, (4) Inner retinal wiring, and (5) Eye-to-brain connectivity. Here, we discuss the most pertinent questions and challenges that exist on the path to clinical translation and suggest experimental directions to propel this work going forward. Using these five subtopic discussion groups (SDGs) as a framework, we suggest multidisciplinary approaches to restore the diseased visual pathway by leveraging groundbreaking insights from developmental neuroscience, stem cell biology, molecular biology, optical imaging, animal models of optic neuropathy, immunology & immunotolerance, neuropathology & neuroprotection, materials science & biomedical engineering, and regenerative neuroscience. While significant hurdles remain, the RReSTORe Consortium's efforts provide a comprehensive roadmap for advancing the RGC repopulation field and hold potential for transformative progress in restoring vision in patients suffering from optic neuropathies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13024-023-00655-y\n\nView details for PubMedID 37735444\n\nAbstract\n\nOn February 24-27, 2021, the Association for Ocular Pharmacology and Therapeutics (AOPT) held its 15th biennial scientific meeting online. The meeting was organized by Dr. Sanjoy Bhattacharya of the University of Miami in conjunction with the board of trustees of the AOPT. The 3-day conference was attended by academic scientists, clinicians, and industry and regulatory professionals. The theme of the meeting was Restoring Vision through Regeneration and it was sponsored, in part, by the National Institutes of Health, Bright Focus, Regeneron, and Santen (USA). During the 3 days of the meeting, presentations from several sessions explored different aspects of regenerative medicine in ophthalmology, including optic nerve regeneration, drugs and devices in glaucoma, retinal neuroprotection and plasticity, visual perception, and degeneration of trabecular meshwork. This article summarizes the proceedings of the session on corneal regenerative medicine research and discusses emerging concepts in drug development for corneal epithelial and endothelial regeneration. Since the meeting in 2021, several of these concepts have advanced to clinical-stage therapies, but so far as of 2023, none has been approved by regional regulatory authorities in the United States. One form of corneal endothelial cell therapy has been approved in Japan and only for bullous keratopathy. Ongoing work is proceeding in the United States and other countries.

Multivariable logistic regression models evaluated blindness and visually impaired (VI) associations. Blindness was mapped by state and compared to population characteristics. Eyecare utilization was analyzed by comparing population demographics to US Census estimates, and proportional demographic representation among blind/VI patients versus a nationally-representative US population sample (National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, NHANES).Prevalence and odds ratios for VI and blindness; proportional representation in IRIS Registry, Census, and NHANES by patient demographics.VI was present in 6.98% (n=1,364,935) and blindness in 0.98% (n=190,817) of IRIS Registry patients. Adjusted odds of blindness were highest among patients 85+ years old (OR=11.85, 95%CI=10.33-13.59, versus 0-17 year-olds). Blindness was also positively-associated with smoking (OR=1.13, 95%CI=1.08-1.17), rural location (OR=1.09, 95%CI=1.04-1.14) and Medicaid (OR=3.85, 95%CI=3.57-4.15), Medicare (OR=1.66, 95%CI=1.53-1.82), or no insurance (OR=1.77, 95%CI=1.37-2.27) versus commercial insurance. Hispanic (OR=1.59, 95%CI=1.46-1.74) and Black patients (OR=1.73, 95%CI=1.63-1.84) had higher odds of blindness versus white non-Hispanic patients. Proportional representation in IRIS Registry relative to Census was higher for white than Hispanic (2-4 fold) or Black patients (11-85%) (p<0.001). Blindness was overall less prevalent in NHANES than IRIS Registry; however, prevalence in adults aged 60+ was lowest among Black participants in NHANES (0.54%) and second highest among comparable Black adults in IRIS Registry (1.57%).Legal blindness from low VA was present in 0.98% of IRIS patients and associated with smoking, rural location, public or no insurance, and older age. Compared to US Census estimates, minorities may be underrepresented among ophthalmology patients, and compared to NHANES population estimates, Black individuals may be overrepresented among blind IRIS Registry patients. These findings provide a snapshot of US ophthalmic care and highlight need for initiatives to address disparities in utilization and blindness.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ophtha.2023.06.011\n\nView details for PubMedID 37331480\n\nAbstract\n\nRetinal neurons are vulnerable to disease and injury, which can result in neuronal death and degeneration leading to irreversible vision loss. The human retina does not regenerate to replace neurons lost to disease or injury. However, cells within the retina of other animals are capable of regenerating neurons, and homologous cells within the mammalian retina could potentially be prompted to do the same. Activating evolutionarily silenced intrinsic regenerative capacity of the mammalian retina could slow, or even reverse, vision loss, leading to improved quality of life for millions of people.During development, neurons in the retina are generated progressively by retinal progenitor cells, with distinct neuron types born over developmental time. Many genes function in this process to specify the identity of newly generated neuron types, and these appropriate states of gene expression inform recent regenerative work. When regeneration is initiated in other vertebrates, including birds and fish, specific signaling pathways control the efficiency of regeneration, and these conserved pathways are likely to be important in mammals as well.Using insights from development and from other animals, limited regeneration from intrinsic cell types has been demonstrated in the mammalian retina, but it is able only to generate a subset of partially differentiated retinal neuron types.Future studies should aim to increase the efficiency of regeneration, activate regeneration in a targeted fashion across the retina, and improve the ability to generate specific types of retinal neurons to replace those lost to disease or injury.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1089/ars.2023.0309\n\nView details for PubMedID 37276181\n\nAbstract\n\nComplement C1q, the initiating molecule of the classical complement cascade, is involved in synapse elimination and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases including glaucoma. Here we report an evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and ocular pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of intravitreal (IVT) injections of ANX007, an anti-C1q monoclonal antibody fragment that blocks activation of the classical complement cascade.An open-label, single-dose-escalation phase Ia study followed by a double-masked, randomized, sham-controlled, repeat-injection phase Ib study.A total of 26 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.Nine patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (mean Humphrey visual field deviation between -3 and -18 decibels [dB]) were enrolled in phase Ia and received single doses of ANX007 (1.0 mg, n = 3; 2.5 mg, n = 3; or 5.0 mg, n = 3). Seventeen patients (mean Humphrey visual field deviation between -3 and -24 dB) were enrolled in phase Ib and randomized to 2 monthly doses of ANX007 (sham, n = 6; 2.5 mg ANX007, n = 6; or 5 mg ANX007, n = 5).Safety and tolerability (including laboratory evaluation of urinalysis, complete blood count, and serum chemistries), ANX007 PK, target engagement, and immunogenicity.The mean age overall was 70 years in phase Ia and 68 years in phase Ib. In both studies, no serious adverse events were observed, no non-ocular treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) attributable to study drug were reported, and ocular TEAEs were mild. Intraocular pressure returned to normal levels for all patients within 45 minutes of IVT injection. No clinically significant deviations in laboratory results were observed. In the phase Ib study, C1q in the aqueous humor was reduced to undetectable levels in both the 2.5 mg and 5 mg cohorts 4 weeks after the first ANX007 dose.In these studies, single and repeat IVT ANX007 injections were well tolerated and demonstrated full target engagement 4 weeks after dosing with both low and high doses, supporting monthly or less-frequent dosing. Further investigation in neurodegenerative ocular diseases is warranted.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xops.2023.100290\n\nView details for PubMedID 37124168\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10130689\n\nAbstract\n\nAs part of the central nervous system (CNS), retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons are the only neurons in the retina that transmit visual signals from the eye to the brain via the optic nerve (ON). Unfortunately, they do not regenerate upon injury in mammals. In ON trauma, retinal microglia (RMG) become activated, inducing inflammatory responses and resulting in axon degeneration and RGC loss. Since aldose reductase (AR) is an inflammatory response mediator highly expressed in RMG, we investigated if pharmacological inhibition of AR can attenuate ocular inflammation and thereby promote RGC survival and axon regeneration after ON crush (ONC). In vitro, we discovered that Sorbinil, an AR inhibitor, attenuates BV2 microglia activation and migration in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) treatments. In vivo, Sorbinil suppressed ONC-induced Iba1 + microglia/macrophage infiltration in the retina and ON and promoted RGC survival. Moreover, Sorbinil restored RGC function and delayed axon degeneration one week after ONC. RNA sequencing data revealed that Sorbinil protects the retina from ONC-induced degeneration by suppressing inflammatory signaling. In summary, we report the first study demonstrating that AR inhibition transiently protects RGC and axon from degeneration, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for optic neuropathies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41598-023-32702-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 37019993\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10076364\n\nAbstract\n\nAxon transport of organelles and neurotrophic factors is necessary for maintaining cellular function and survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). However, it is not clear how trafficking of mitochondria, essential for RGC growth and maturation, changes during RGC development. The purpose of this study was to understand the dynamics and regulation of mitochondrial transport during RGC maturation using acutely purified RGCs as a model system.Primary RGCs were immunopanned from rats of either sex during three stages of development. MitoTracker dye and live-cell imaging were used to quantify mitochondrial motility. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing was used to identify Kinesin family member 5A (Kif5a) as a relevant motor candidate for mitochondrial transport. Kif5a expression was manipulated with either short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or exogenous expression adeno-associated virus viral vectors.Anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial trafficking and motility decreased through RGC development. Similarly, the expression of Kif5a, a motor protein that transports mitochondria, also decreased during development. Kif5a knockdown decreased anterograde mitochondrial transport, while Kif5a expression increased general mitochondrial motility and anterograde mitochondrial transport.Our results suggested that Kif5a directly regulates mitochondrial axonal transport in developing RGCs. Future work exploring the role of Kif5a in vivo in RGCs is indicated.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1167/iovs.64.3.4\n\nView details for PubMedID 36862119\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives: Primary cilia are conserved organelles found in polarized mammalian cells that regulate neuronal growth, migration, and differentiation. Proper cilia formation is essential during eye development. Our previous reports found that both amacrine and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) contain primary cilia in primate and rodent retinas. However, whether primary cilia are present in the inner retina of human retinal organoids remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to characterize the primary cilia distribution in human embryonic stem cell (hESC-derived retinal organoid development.Materials and Methods: Retinal organoids were differentiated from a hESC line, harvested at various developmental timepoints (day 44-day 266), and immunostained with antibodies for primary cilia, including Arl13b (for the axoneme), AC3, and Centrin3 (for the basal body). AP2alpha, Prox1, GAD67, Calretinin, GFAP, PKCalpha, and Chx10 antibodies as well as Brn3b-promoted tdTomato expression were used to visualize retinal cell types.Results: A group of ciliated cells were present in the inner aspects of retinal organoids from day 44 to day 266 in culture. Ciliated Chx10-positive retinal progenitor cells, GFAP-positive astrocytes, and PKCalpha-positive rod-bipolar cells were detected later during development (day 176 to day 266). Ciliation persisted during all stages of retinal developmental in AP2alpha-positive amacrine cells, but it was decreased in Brn3b-positive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) at later time points. Additionally, AC3-positive astrocytes significantly decreased during the later stages of organoid formation.Conclusions: Amacrine cells in retinal organoids retain cilia throughout development, whereas RGC ciliation gradually and progressively decreases with organoid maturation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1155/2023/6494486\n\nView details for PubMedID 36684387\n\nAbstract\n\nAdult central nervous system (CNS) axons fail to regenerate after injury, and master regulators of the regenerative program remain to be identified. We analyzed the transcriptomes of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) at 1 and 5days after optic nerve injury with and without a cocktail of strongly pro-regenerative factors to discover genes that regulate survival and regeneration. We used advanced bioinformatic analysis to identify the top transcriptional regulators of upstream genes and cross-referenced these with the regulators upstream of genes differentially expressed between embryonic RGCs that exhibit robust axon growth vs. postnatal RGCs where this potential has been lost. We established the transcriptional activator Elk-1 as the top regulator of RGC gene expression associated with axon outgrowth in both models. We demonstrate that Elk-1 is necessary and sufficient to promote RGC neuroprotection and regeneration in vivo, and is enhanced by manipulating specific phosphorylation sites. Finally, we co-manipulated Elk-1, PTEN, and REST, another transcription factor discovered in our analysis, and found Elk-1 to be downstream of PTEN and inhibited by REST in the survival and axon regenerative pathway in RGCs. These results uncover the basic mechanisms of regulation of survival and axon growth and reveal a novel, potent therapeutic strategy to promote neuroprotection and regeneration in the adult CNS.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41598-022-21767-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 36261683\n\nAbstract\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether glaucoma in human patients produces preferential damage to OFF visual pathways, as suggested by animal experimental models, patient electroretinogram (ERG), and retinal imaging data.Methods: Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were recorded monocularly from 50 patients with glaucoma and 28 age-similar controls in response to equal Weber contrast increments and decrements presented using 2.73 hertz (Hz) sawtooth temporal waveforms.Results: The eyes of patients with glaucoma were separated into mild (better than -6 decibel [dB] mean deviation; n = 28) and moderate to severe (worse than -6 dB mean deviation, n = 22) groups based on their Humphrey 24-2 visual field measurements. Response amplitudes and phases from the two glaucoma-severity groups were compared to controls at the group level. SSVEP amplitudes were depressed in both glaucoma groups, more so in the moderate to severe glaucoma group. The differences between controls and the moderate-severe glaucoma groups were more statistically reliable for decrements than for increments. Mean responses to decremental sawtooth stimuli were larger than those to increments in controls and in the mild glaucoma but not in the moderate to severe glaucoma group at the first harmonic. OFF/decrement responses at the first harmonic were faster in controls, but not in patients.Conclusions: The observed pattern of preferential loss of decremental responses in human glaucoma is consistent with prior reports of selective damage to OFF retinal ganglion cells in murine models and in data from human ERG and retinal imaging. These data motivate pursuit of SSVEP as a biomarker for glaucoma progression.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1167/iovs.63.11.16\n\nView details for PubMedID 36264656\n\nAbstract\n\nBlindness affects more than 60 million people worldwide. Retinal disorders, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and glaucoma, are the leading causes of blindness. Finding means to optimize local and sustained delivery of drugs or genes to the eye and retina is one goal to advance the development of new therapeutics. Despite the ease of accessibility of delivering drugs via the ocular surface, the delivery of drugs to the retina is still challenging due to anatomic and physiologic barriers. Designing a suitable delivery platform to overcome these barriers should enhance drug bioavailability and provide a safe, controlled, and sustained release. Current inventions for posterior segment treatments include intravitreal implants and subretinal viral gene delivery that satisfy these criteria. Several other novel drug delivery technologies, including nanoparticles, micelles, dendrimers, microneedles, liposomes, and nanowires, are now being widely studied for posterior segment drug delivery, and extensive research on gene delivery using siRNA, mRNA, or aptamers is also on the rise. This review discusses the current state of retinal drug/gene delivery and highlights future therapeutic opportunities.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00210-022-02287-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 36107200\n\nAbstract\n\nThe inability of neurons to regenerate long axons within the CNS is a major impediment to improving outcome after spinal cord injury, stroke, and other CNS insults. Recent advances have uncovered an intrinsic program that involves coordinate regulation by multiple transcription factors that can be manipulated to enhance growth in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we use a systems genomics approach to characterize regulatory relationships of regeneration-associated transcription factors, identifying RE1-Silencing Transcription Factor (REST; Neuron-Restrictive Silencer Factor, NRSF) as a predicted upstream suppressor of a pro-regenerative gene program associated with axon regeneration in the CNS. We validate our predictions using multiple paradigms, showing that mature mice bearing cell type-specific deletions of REST or expressing dominant-negative mutant REST show improved regeneration of the corticospinal tract and optic nerve after spinal cord injury and optic nerve crush, which is accompanied by upregulation of regeneration-associated genes in cortical motor neurons and retinal ganglion cells, respectively. These analyses identify a role for REST as an upstream suppressor of the intrinsic regenerative program in the CNS and demonstrate the utility of a systems biology approach involving integrative genomics and bio-informatics to prioritize hypotheses relevant to CNS repair.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-022-31960-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 35906210\n\nAbstract\n\nShort-term use of the Balance Goggles System in glaucoma patients was not associated with observable changes in conventional OCT imaging but metabolic imaging using peripapillary flavoprotein fluorescence may represent a useful adjuctive investigation.To determine whether the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effects of the Balance Goggles System (BGS) are accompanied by changes in retinal thickness measured by ocular coherence tomography, retinal vascular density measured by OCT-angiography, or novel peripapillary metabolic profiling using flavoprotein fluorescence (FPF) measured by a fundus camera.Prospective comparative case-series.8 eyes from 8 patients with open-angle glaucoma ranging from mild to severe.In this prospective, single-center, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm study patients received a baseline evaluation including retinal imaging, then one hour of negative pressure application through the BGS, followed by repeat retinal imaging. Participants then used the BGS at home for 1 month and underwent a repeat evaluation at the conclusion of the trial.Changes in nerve fiber layer thickness, OCTA vascular parameters and FPF scores.Mean baseline IOP was 18.0±3.1 mmHg and there was no significant change in IOP at follow-up. At 1 month compared to baseline, there was a statistically significant improvement in FPF optic nerve head rim scores (12.7±11.6 to 10.5±7.5; P=0.04). Additionally, there was there was a trend towards an increase in RNFL thickness after 1 month (69.5±14.2 to 72.0±13.7; P=0.1), but there were no statistically significant differences observable with any of the OCTA vascular parameters either at 1 hour or after 1 month.There were no significant changes observable using conventional OCT imaging following short-term use of the BGS, although metabolic imaging using FPF may be a useful potential biomarker to complement existing investigations. Additional studies are warranted to further investigate these changes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/IJG.0000000000002066\n\nView details for PubMedID 35696700\n\nAbstract\n\nAcross neurodegenerative diseases, common mechanisms may reveal novel therapeutic targets based on neuronal protection, repair, or regeneration, independent of etiology or site of disease pathology. To address these mechanisms and discuss emerging treatments, in April, 2021, Glaucoma Research Foundation, BrightFocus Foundation, and the Melza M. and Frank Theodore Barr Foundation collaborated to bring together key opinion leaders and experts in the field of neurodegenerative disease for a virtual meeting titled \"Solving Neurodegeneration\". This \"think-tank\" style meeting focused on uncovering common mechanistic roots of neurodegenerative disease and promising targets for new treatments, catalyzed by the goal of finding new treatments for glaucoma, the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and the common interest of the three hosting foundations. Glaucoma, which causes vision loss through degeneration of the optic nerve, likely shares early cellular and molecular events with other neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. Here we discuss major areas of mechanistic overlap between neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system: neuroinflammation, bioenergetics and metabolism, genetic contributions, and neurovascular interactions. We summarize important discussion points with emphasis on the research areas that are most innovative and promising in the treatment of neurodegeneration yet require further development. The research that is highlighted provides unique opportunities for collaboration that will lead to efforts in preventing neurodegeneration and ultimately vision loss.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13024-022-00524-0\n\nView details for PubMedID 35313950\n\nAbstract\n\nPurpose: To quantitatively compare iridocorneal angle assessments using gonioscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT).Patients: US and Chinese patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and/or ocular hypertension (OHT).Methods: Analysis was pooled from 2 multicenter, noninterventional studies conducted in the US and China. Gonioscopy Shaffer grade and an AS-OCT method that approximates the angle width relative to local morphologic variations were compared by measuring the same iridocorneal angles. A third, separate, single-center, noninterventional study was conducted to verify results observed from the pooled analysis.Results: From the pooled studies, a total of 239 eyes were measured using Shaffer grade and AS-OCT. Of these, 6 were Shaffer grade 2, 37 in Shaffer grade 3, and 196 in Shaffer grade 4. There was a trend of increasing Shaffer grade with increasing AS-OCT angle width. Open iridocorneal angles, Shaffer grade ≥3, had a ~98% sensitivity and 88% positive predictive value for identifying AS-OCT angle width ≥300 m, using the AS-OCT method. To verify these results, a total of 28 right eyes were imaged for the third study. A trend of increasing Shaffer grade with increasing AS-OCT angle width was observed, and angles with Shaffer grade ≤2 had AS-OCT angle width <300 m.Conclusion: The AS-OCT method can determine the space in the anterior chamber and can potentially identify angles that are the appropriate size for certain glaucoma devices. Information gathered from AS-OCT can provide additional comprehensive and quantitative assessment to gonioscopy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2147/OPTH.S322962\n\nView details for PubMedID 35510274\n\nAbstract\n\nMagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are widely used in cell sorting, organelle selection, drug delivery, cell delivery, and cell tracking applications. However, organelle manipulation in living cells has been limited due to the endocytic uptake and sequestration of MNPs. Here, we introduce a method for modifying MNPs with fusogenic liposomes that facilitate MNP passage directly into the cytosol. MNPs were enclosed in fusogenic liposomes that exhibit a core-shell structure under a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The lipid-to-MNP ratio was optimized for one layer of liposome coating around each MNP, so that MNPs were delivered to the cytosol without endosomal or liposomal coatings. After incubation with the retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19, single-layer liposome-coated MNPs exhibited the highest MNP delivery efficiency. Although uncoated MNPs are taken up through endocytosis, less than 15% of the fusogenic liposome-coated MNPs co-localized with early endosomes. MNPs delivered by fusogenic liposomes showed cytosolic localization early on and increased lysosomal localization at later time points. The movement of intracellular MNPs could be manipulated with an external magnet to estimate cytosolic viscosity. Bypassing endocytosis in this way allowed efficient delivery of MNPs to the cytosol, potentially allowing for the targeting of specific organelles and controlling their motion in living cells.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1039/d1ra03094a\n\nView details for PubMedID 35492766\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9043121\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients with inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) were recruited from two understudied populations: Mexico and Pakistan as well as a third well-studied population of European Americans to define the genetic architecture of IRD by performing whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Whole-genome analysis was performed on 409 individuals from 108 unrelated pedigrees with IRDs. All patients underwent an ophthalmic evaluation to establish the retinal phenotype. Although the 108 pedigrees in this study had previously been examined for mutations in known IRD genes using a wide range of methodologies including targeted gene(s) or mutation(s) screening, linkage analysis and exome sequencing, the gene mutations responsible for IRD in these 108 pedigrees were not determined. WGS was performed on these pedigrees using Illumina X10 at a minimum of 30X depth. The sequence reads were mapped against hg19 followed by variant calling using GATK. The genome variants were annotated using SnpEff, PolyPhen2, and CADD score; the structural variants (SVs) were called using GenomeSTRiP and LUMPY. We identified potential causative sequence alterations in 62 pedigrees (58%), including 41 novel and 53 reported variants in IRD genes. For 58 of these pedigrees the observed genotype was consistent with the initial clinical diagnosis, the remaining 4 had the clinical diagnosis reclassified based on our findings. In eight pedigrees (13%) we observed atypical causal variants, i.e. unexpected genotype(s), including 5 pedigrees with causal variants in more than one IRD gene within all affected family members, one pedigree with intrafamilial genetic heterogeneity (different affected family members carrying causal variants in different IRD genes), one pedigree carrying a dominant causative variant present in pseudo-recessive form due to consanguinity and one pedigree with a de-novo variant in the affected family member. Combined atypical and large structural variants contributed to about 21% of cases. Among the novel mutations, 75% were detected in Mexican and 53% found in European American pedigrees and have not been reported in any other population while only 20% were detected in Pakistani pedigrees and were not previously reported. The remaining novel IRD causative variants were listed in gnomAD but were found to be very rare and population specific. Mutations in known IRD associated genes contributed to pathology in 63% Mexican, 60% Pakistani and 48% European American pedigrees analyzed. Overall, contribution of known IRD gene variants to disease pathology in these three populations was similar to that observed in other populations worldwide. This study revealed a spectrum of mutations contributing to IRD in three populations, identified a large proportion of novel potentially causative variants that are specific to the corresponding population or not reported in gnomAD and shed light on the genetic architecture of IRD in these diverse global populations.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pgen.1009848\n\nView details for PubMedID 34662339\n\nAbstract\n\nNeurons have recently emerged as essential cellular constituents of the tumour microenvironment, and their activity has been shown to increase the growth of a diverse number of solid tumours1. Although the role of neurons in tumour progression has previously been demonstrated2, the importance of neuronal activity to tumour initiation is less clear-particularly in the setting of cancer predisposition syndromes. Fifteen per cent of individuals with theneurofibromatosis1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome (in which tumours arise in close association with nerves) develop low-grade neoplasms of the optic pathway (known as optic pathway gliomas (OPGs)) during early childhood3,4, raising the possibility that postnatal light-induced activity of the optic nerve drives tumour initiation. Here we use an authenticated mouse model of OPG driven by mutations in the neurofibromatosis1 tumour suppressor gene (Nf1)5 to demonstrate that stimulation of optic nerve activity increases optic glioma growth, and that decreasing visual experience via light deprivation prevents tumour formation and maintenance. We show that the initiation of Nf1-driven OPGs (Nf1-OPGs) depends on visual experience during a developmental period in which Nf1-mutant mice are susceptible to tumorigenesis. Germline Nf1 mutation in retinal neurons results in aberrantly increased shedding of neuroligin3 (NLGN3) within the optic nerve in response to retinal neuronal activity. Moreover, genetic Nlgn3 loss or pharmacological inhibition of NLGN3 shedding blocks the formation and progression of Nf1-OPGs. Collectively, our studies establish an obligate role for neuronal activity in the development of some types of brain tumours, elucidate a therapeutic strategy to reduce OPG incidence or mitigate tumour progression, and underscore the role of Nf1mutation-mediated dysregulation of neuronal signalling pathways in mouse models of the NF1 cancer predisposition syndrome.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-021-03580-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 34040258\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term safety and feasibility of negative pressure application by the Multi-Pressure Dial (MPD) System to lower nocturnal intraocular pressure (IOP) in subjects with open-angle glaucoma (OAG).METHODS: A prospective, controlled, intra-subject study of 22 eyes from 11 subjects at a single site was performed. All subjects had a history of OAG and were currently using a topical prostaglandin. For each subject, the eye with the highest IOP in the supine position was selected as the treatment eye (TE) and the contralateral eye served as the control eye (CE). The negative pressure for the TE was set to 60% of the baseline IOP value with no negative pressure in the CE. IOP measurements were collected at three prespecified time points overnight in the supine position with active negative pressure. The primary outcome measure was mean IOP with the application of negative pressure.RESULTS: At the three overnight time points, the mean (± standard deviation) baseline IOP prior to negative pressure application was 22.2±2.5mmHg in the TE and 21.8±2.5mmHg in the CE. With the application of 60% negative pressure to the TE and no active negative pressure to the CE, the mean IOP was 14.2±2.2 and 19.5±2.4mmHg, respectively. The mean percentage IOP reduction in the TE was 35% (p<0.001). There were two minor adverse events, both unrelated to device wear, and there were no IOP spikes≥10mmHg.CONCLUSION: The MPD can safely and effectively lower nocturnal IOP in the supine position. The MPD holds promise as a potential new, non-invasive treatment option for the control of nocturnal IOP.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s40123-021-00343-4\n\nView details for PubMedID 33871812\n\nAbstract\n\nThe second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is important for the regulation of neuronal structure and function, including neurite extension. A perinuclear cAMP compartment organized by the scaffold protein muscle A-Kinase Anchoring Protein alpha (mAKAPalpha/AKAP6alpha) is sufficient and necessary for axon growth by rat hippocampal neurons in vitro Here, we report that cAMP at mAKAPalpha signalosomes is regulated by local Ca2+ signaling that mediates activity-dependent cAMP elevation within that compartment. Simultaneous Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging using the PKA activity reporter AKAR4 and intensiometric imaging using the RCaMP1h fluorescent Ca2+ sensor revealed that membrane depolarization by KCl selectively induced activation of perinuclear PKA activity. Activity-dependent perinuclear PKA activity was dependent upon expression of the mAKAPalpha scaffold, while both perinuclear Ca2+ elevation and PKA activation were dependent upon voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channel activity. Importantly, chelation of Ca2+ by a nuclear envelope-localized parvalbumin fusion protein inhibited both activity-induced perinuclear PKA activity and axon elongation. Together, this study provides evidence for a model in which a neuronal perinuclear cAMP compartment is locally regulated by activity-dependent Ca2+ influx, providing local control for the enhancement of neurite extension.Significance statement cAMP-dependent signaling has been implicated as a positive regulator of neurite outgrowth and axon regeneration. However, the mechanisms regulating cAMP signaling relevant to these processes remain largely unknown. Live cell imaging techniques are used to study the regulation by local Ca2+ signals of an mAKAPalpha-associated cAMP compartment at the neuronal nuclear envelope, providing new mechanistic insight into CNS neuronal signaling transduction conferring axon outgrowth.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1523/ENEURO.0298-20.2021\n\nView details for PubMedID 33495246\n\nAbstract\n\nThe failure of adult CNS neurons to survive and regenerate their axons after injury or in neurodegenerative disease remains a major target for basic and clinical neuroscience. Recent data demonstrated in the adult mouse that exogenous expression of Sry-related high-mobility-box 11 (Sox11) promotes optic nerve regeneration after optic nerve injury, but exacerbates the death of a subset of retinal ganglion cells, alpha-RGCs. During development, Sox11 is required for RGC differentiation from retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), and we found that mutation of a single residue to prevent sumoylation at lysine 91 (K91) increased nuclear localization and RGC differentiation in vitro Here we explored whether this Sox11 manipulation similarly has stronger effects on RGC survival and optic nerve regeneration. In vitro, we found that non-SUMOylatable Sox11K91A leads to RGC death and suppresses axon outgrowth in primary neurons. We furthermore found that Sox11K91A more strongly promotes axon regeneration but also increases RGC death after optic nerve injury in vivo in adult mouse. RNA sequence data showed that Sox11 and Sox11K91A increase the expression of key signaling pathway genes associated with axon growth and regeneration but downregulated Spp1 and Opn4 expression in RGC cultures, consistent with negatively regulating the survival of alpha-RGCs and ipRGCs. Thus Sox11 and its sumoylation site at K91 regulate gene expression, survival and axon growth in RGCs and may be explored further as potential regenerative therapies for optic neuropathy.Significance Statement Sox11 expression promotes optic nerve regeneration but also increases RGC death after optic nerve injury. Here we demonstrate that mutation of a single SUMOylation site on Sox11 (Sox11K91A) leads to stronger effects in vivo RNA sequencing analysis reveals that Sox11 and Sox11K91A differentially regulate downstream gene expression related to axon growth and guidance. Understanding these effects of post-translational modification of Sox11 in regulating regeneration in vivo suggests a potent therapeutic strategy for vision restoration in optic neuropathies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1523/ENEURO.0358-20.2020\n\nView details for PubMedID 33441400\n\nAbstract\n\nTo measure the COVID-19 pandemic impact on missed ophthalmology clinic visits and the influence of patient and eye disease characteristics on likelihood of missing clinic visits before and during the pandemic.A retrospective observational study analyzing eye clinic patients at a large tertiary care academic institution. We identified patients scheduled for eye care during pre-COVID-19 (January 1-February 29, 2020) and early COVID-19 (March 16-May 31, 2020) time periods. Missed appointment frequency and characteristics were evaluated during each time period. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to examine adjusted odds of having at least one missed appointment during a given time period. Covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, preferred language (non-English vs English), insurance, distance from clinic, and diagnosis.Overall, 82.0% (n = 11,998) of pre-COVID-19 patients completed all scheduled visits, compared to only 59.3% (n = 9020) during COVID-19. Missed visits increased dramatically in late March 2020, then improved week by week through the end of May 2020. General ophthalmology/cataract and strabismus clinics had the highest rates of missed clinic visits during the COVID-19 period; neuro-ophthalmology, retina, cornea, oculoplastics and glaucoma had the lowest. Females, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, ages 50+, and married patients had higher adjusted odds of missing clinic visits, both pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. Asian, elderly, and cataract patients had the highest adjusted odds of missing clinic visits during COVID-19 and had significant increases in odds compared to pre-COVID-19. Non-married, diabetic macular edema, and wet age-related macular degeneration patients had the lowest adjusted odds of missed visits during COVID-19.Missed clinic visits increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among elderly and nonwhite patients. These findings reflect differences in eye care delivery during the pandemic, and they indicate opportunities to target barriers to care, even during non-pandemic eras.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2147/OPTH.S341739\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000730419000002\n\nView details for PubMedID 34916776\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8667753\n\nAbstract\n\nHuman retinal ganglion cells (hRGC) derived from human pluripotent stem cells are promising candidates to model, protect, and replace degenerating RGCs. Here, we examined intrinsic morphologic and physiologic development of hRGCs.We used CRISPR-Cas9 to selectively express tdTomato under the RGC-specific promoter, BRN3B. Human pluripotent stem cells were chemically differentiated into hRGCs and cultured up to 7 weeks. We measured soma area, neurite complexity, synaptic protein, axon-related messenger RNA and protein, and voltage-dependent responses.Soma area, neurite complexity, and postsynaptic density protein 95 increased over time. Soma area and neurite complexity increased proportionally week to week, and this relationship was dynamic, strengthening between 2 and 3 weeks and diminishing by 4 weeks. Postsynaptic density 95 localization was dependent on culture duration. After 1 to 2 weeks, postsynaptic density 95 localized within somas but redistributed along neurites after 3 to 4 weeks. Axon initial segment scaffolding protein, Ankyrin G, expression also increased over time, and by 7 weeks, Ankyrin G often localized within putative axons. Voltage-gated inward currents progressively developed, but outward currents matured by 4 weeks. Current-induced spike generation increased over time but limited by depolarization block.Human RGCs develop up to 7 weeks after culture. Thus, the state of hRGC maturation should be accounted for in designing models and treatments for optic neuropathies.We characterized hRGC morphologic and physiologic development towards identifying key time points when hRGCs express mechanisms that may be harnessed to enhance the efficacy of neuroprotective and cell replacement therapies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1167/tvst.10.10.1\n\nView details for PubMedID 34383881\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: Understanding molecular changes is essential for designing effective treatments for nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), the most common acute optic neuropathy in adults older than 50years. We investigated changes in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway after experimental AION and focused on dual specificity phosphatase 14 (Dusp14), an atypical MAPK phosphatase that is downstream of Kruppel-like transcription factor (KLF) 9-mediated inhibition of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival and axonal regeneration.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We induced severe AION in a photochemical thrombosis model in adult C57BL/6 wild-type and Dusp14 knockout mice. For comparison, some studies were performed using an optic nerve crush model. We assessed changes in MAPK pathway molecules using Western blot and immunohistochemistry, measured retinal thickness using optical coherence tomography (OCT), and quantified RGCs and axons using histologic methods.RESULTS: Three days after severe AION, there was no change in the retinal protein levels of MAPK ERK1/2, phosphorylated-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2), downstream effector Elk-1 and phosphatase Dusp14 on Western blot. Western blot analysis of purified RGCs after a more severe model using optic nerve crush also showed no change in Dusp14 protein expression. Because of the known importance of the Dusp14 and MAPK pathway in RGCs, we examined changes after AION in Dusp14 knockout mice. Three days after AION, Dusp14 knockout mice had significantly increased pERK1/2+, Brn3A+ RGCs on immunohistochemistry. Three weeks after AION, Dusp14 knockout mice had significantly greater preservation of retinal thickness, increased number of Brn3A+ RGCs on whole mount preparation, and increased number of optic nerve axons compared with wild-type mice.CONCLUSIONS: Genetic deletion of Dusp14, a MAPK phosphatase important in KFL9-mediated inhibition of RGC survival, led to increased activation of MAPK ERK1/2 and greater RGC and axonal survival after experimental AION. Inhibiting Dusp14 or activating the MAPK pathway should be examined further as a potential therapeutic approach to treatment of AION.Abbreviations: AION: anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; Dusp14: dual specific phosphatase 14; ERK1/2: extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2; Elk-1: ETS Like-1 protein; GCC: ganglion cell complex; GCL: ganglion cell layer; inner nuclear layer; KO: knockout; MAPK: mitogen-activated phosphokinase; OCT: optical coherence tomography; RGC: retinal ganglion cell; RNFL: retinal nerve fiber layer.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1080/02713683.2020.1826976\n\nView details for PubMedID 33107352\n\nAbstract\n\nIn diseases such as glaucoma, the failure of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons to survive or regenerate their optic nerve axons underlies partial and, in some cases, complete vision loss. Optic nerve crush (ONC) serves as a useful model not only of traumatic optic neuropathy but also of glaucomatous injury, as it similarly induces RGC cell death and degeneration. Intravitreal injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) has been shown to specifically and efficiently transduce RGCs in vivo and has thus been proposed as an effective means of gene delivery for the treatment of glaucoma. Indeed, we and others routinely use AAV2 to study the mechanisms that promote neuroprotection and axon regeneration in RGCs following ONC. Herein, we describe a step-by-step protocol to assay RGC survival and regeneration in mice following AAV2-mediated transduction and ONC injury including 1) intravitreal injection of AAV2 viral vectors, 2) optic nerve crush, 3) cholera-toxin B (CTB) labeling of regenerating axons, 4) optic nerve clearing, 5) flat mount retina immunostaining, and 6) quantification of RGC survival and regeneration. In addition to providing all the materials and procedural details necessary to execute this protocol, we highlight its advantages over other similar published approaches and include useful tips to ensure its faithful reproduction in any modern laboratory.\n\nView details for DOI 10.21769/BioProtoc.3559\n\nView details for PubMedID 32368566\n\nAbstract\n\nOptic neuropathies are a group of optic nerve (ON) diseases caused by various insults including glaucoma, inflammation, ischemia, trauma and genetic deficits, which are characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and ON degeneration. An increasing number of genes involved in RGC intrinsic signaling have been found to be promising neural repair targets that can potentially be modulated directly by gene therapy, if we can achieve RGC specific gene targeting. To address this challenge, we first used adeno associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene transfer to perform a low throughput in vivo screening in both male and female mouse eyes and identified the mouse γ-synuclein (mSncg) promoter, which specifically and potently sustained transgene expression in mouse RGCs and also works in human RGCs. We further demonstrated that gene therapy that combines AAV-mSncg promoter with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing can knockdown pro-degenerative genes in RGCs and provide effective neuroprotection in optic neuropathies.Significance Statement:Here we present an RGC-specific promoter, mouse γ-synuclein (mSncg) promoter, and perform extensive characterization and proof-of-concept studies of mSncg promoter-mediated gene expression and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in RGCs in vivo To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating in vivo neuroprotection of injured RGCs and optic nerve by AAV-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 inhibition of genes that are critical for neurodegeneration. It represents a powerful tool to achieve RGC-specific gene modulation, and also opens up a promising gene therapy strategy for optic neuropathies, the most common form of eye diseases that cause irreversible blindness.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0102-20.2020\n\nView details for PubMedID 32300046\n\nAbstract\n\nThe photopic negative response (PhNR) correlates with ganglion cell function and has previously been examined as an indicator of glaucomatous optic nerve damage. However, it is a prolonged response that is measured against baseline, and its clinical utility has been limited by extensive variability, poor repeatability, and baseline instability. We have observed a distinct brief negative wave (\"N-wave\") commonly present within the slow PhNR trough, which may provide practical and analytic advantages as a clinical measure.We reviewed data from an interventional trial of 59 glaucoma patients who had 4 exams over an 8-month period. The PhNR was recorded with standard ISCEV stimuli (1 Hz and in some cases 4 Hz stimulation), and N-waves were measured manually, relative to return to baseline.N-waves, when present, could be measured easily despite shifting baselines and a degree of background noise. The PhNR median amplitude centered around 18 μV, while the N-wave median centered around 7 μV, with a distribution of responses skewed toward low or zero amplitudes.The N-wave appears to be a component of the longer PhNR, though its exact origin and significance remain unclear. As a rapid waveform that is independent of baseline, the N-wave is in many ways easier to measure accurately than the slower PhNR, which is highly dependent on baseline stability. The N-wave may prove useful clinically if further studies can optimize its stimulation, show its behavior in normal individuals and find correlation with markers of optic nerve disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s10633-020-09769-w\n\nView details for PubMedID 32507902\n\nAbstract\n\nLoss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in optic neuropathies results in permanent partial or complete blindness. Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors have been shown to play a pivotal role in neuronal systems, and in particular MEF2A knockout was shown to enhance RGC survival after optic nerve crush injury. Here we expanded these prior data to study bi-allelic, tri-allelic and heterozygous allele deletion. We observed that deletion of all MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D alleles had no effect on RGC survival during development. Our extended experiments suggest that the majority of the neuroprotective effect was conferred by complete deletion of MEF2A but that MEF2D knockout, although not sufficient to increase RGC survival on its own, increased the positive effect of MEF2A knockout. Conversely, MEF2A over-expression in wildtype mice worsened RGC survival after optic nerve crush. Interestingly, MEF2 transcription factors are regulated by post-translational modification, including by calcineurin-catalyzed dephosphorylation of MEF2A Ser-408 known to increase MEF2A-dependent transactivation in neurons. However, neither phospho-mimetic nor phospho-ablative mutation of MEF2A Ser-408 affected the ability of MEF2A to promote RGC death in vivo after optic nerve injury. Together these findings demonstrate that MEF2 gene expression opposes RGC survival following axon injury in a complex hierarchy, and further support the hypothesis that loss of or interference with MEF2A expression might be beneficial for RGC neuroprotection in diseases such as glaucoma and other optic neuropathies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0242884\n\nView details for PubMedID 33315889\n\nAbstract\n\nUnderstanding the molecular mechanism of glaucoma and development of neuroprotectants are significantly hindered by the lack of a reliable animal model that accurately recapitulates human glaucoma. Here we sought to develop a mouse model for the secondary glaucoma that is often observed in humans after silicone oil (SO) blocks the pupil or migrates into the anterior chamber following vitreoretinal surgery. We observed significant intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation after intracameral injection of SO, and that SO removal allows IOP to return quickly to normal. This simple, inducible and reversible mouse ocular hypertension model shows dynamic changes of visual function that correlate with progressive RGC loss and axon degeneration. It may be applicable with only minor modifications to a range of animal species in which it will generate stable, robust IOP elevation and significant neurodegeneration that will facilitate selection of neuroprotectants and investigating the pathogenesis of ocular hypertension-induced glaucoma.\n\nView details for PubMedID 31090540\n\nAbstract\n\nGlaucoma, the number one cause of irreversible blindness, is characterized by the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which do not regenerate in humans or mammals after cell death. Cell transplantation provides an opportunity to restore vision in glaucoma, or other optic neuropathies. Since transplanting primary RGCs from deceased donor tissues may not be feasible, stem cell-derived RGCs could provide a plausible alternative source of donor cells for transplant.We define a robust chemically defined protocol to differentiate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into RGC-like neurons.Human embryonic stem cell lines (H7-A81 and H9) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) were used for RGC differentiation. RGC immaturity was measured by calcium imaging against muscimol. Cell markers were detected by immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR. RGC-like cells were intravitreally injected to rat eye, and co-stained with RBPMS and human nuclei markers. All experiments were conducted at least three times independently. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with Tukey's test with P value of <0.05 considered statistically significant.We detected retinal progenitor markers Rx and Pax6 after 15 days of differentiation, and the expression of markers for RGC-specific differentiation (Brn3a and Brn3b), maturation (synaptophysin) and neurite growth (β-III-tubulin) after an additional 15 days. We further examined the physiologic differentiation of these hESC-derived RGC-like progeny to those differentiated in vitro from primary rodent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) with calcium imaging, and found that both populations demonstrate the immature RGC-like response to muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist. By one week after transplant to the adult rat eye by intravitreal injection, the human RGC-like cells successfully migrated into the ganglion cell layer.Our protocol provides a novel, short, and cost-effective approach for RGC differentiation from hESCs, and may broaden the scope for cell replacement therapy in RGC-related optic neuropathies such as glaucoma.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3233/RNN-190941\n\nView details for PubMedID 31815704\n\nAbstract\n\nCyclic-AMP (cAMP) signaling is known to be critical in neuronal survival and axon growth. Increasingly the subcellular compartmentation of cAMP signaling has been appreciated, but outside of dendritic synaptic regulation, few cAMP compartments have been defined in terms of molecular composition or function in neurons. Specificity in cAMP signaling is conferred in large part by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that localize protein kinase A (PKA) and other signaling enzymes to discrete intracellular compartments. We now reveal that cAMP signaling within a perinuclear neuronal compartment organized by the large multivalent scaffold protein mAKAPα promotes neuronal survival and axon growth. mAKAPα signalosome function is explored using new molecular tools designed to specifically alter local cAMP levels as studied by live cell FRET imaging. In addition, enhancement of mAKAPα-associated cAMP signaling by isoform-specific displacement of bound phosphodiesterase is demonstrated to increase retinal ganglion cell survival in vivo in mice of both sexes following optic nerve crush injury. These findings define a novel neuronal compartment that confers cAMP regulation of neuroprotection and axon growth and that may be therapeutically targeted in disease.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTcAMP is a second messenger responsible for the regulation of diverse cellular processes including neuronal neurite extension and survival following injury. Signal transduction by cAMP is highly compartmentalized in large part due to the formation of discrete, localized multimolecular signaling complexes by A-kinase anchoring proteins. Although the concept of cAMP compartmentation is well-established, the function and identity of these compartments remain poorly understood in neurons. In this study, we provide evidence for a neuronal perinuclear cAMP compartment organized by the scaffold protein mAKAPα that is necessary and sufficient for the induction of neurite outgrowth in vitro and for the survival of retinal ganglion cells in vivo following optic nerve injury.\n\nView details for PubMedID 31097623\n\nAbstract\n\nPurpose: Adult central nervous system (CNS) neurons are unable to regenerate their axons after injury. Kruppel-like transcription factor (KLF) family members regulate intrinsic axon growth ability in vitro and in vivo, but mechanisms downstream of these transcription factors are not known.Methods: Purified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were transduced to express exogenous KLF9, KLF16, KLF7, or KLF11; microarray analysis was used to identify downstream genes, which were screened for effects on axon growth. Dual-specificity phosphatase 14 (Dusp14) was further studied using genetic (siRNA, shRNA) and pharmacologic (PTP inhibitor IV) manipulation to assess effects on neurite length in vitro and survival and regeneration in vivo after optic nerve crush in rats and mice.Results: By screening genes regulated by KLFs in RGCs, we identified Dusp14 as a critical gene target limiting axon growth and regeneration downstream of KLF9's ability to suppress axon growth in RGCs. The KLF9-Dusp14 pathway inhibited activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases normally critical to neurotrophic signaling of RGC survival and axon elongation. Decreasing Dusp14 expression or disrupting its function in RGCs increased axon growth in vitro and promoted survival and optic nerve regeneration after optic nerve injury in vivo.Conclusions: These results link intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of axon growth and suggest modulation of the KLF9-Dusp14 pathway as a potential approach to improve regeneration in the adult CNS after injury.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29860460\n\nAbstract\n\nThe inability of axons to regenerate over long-distances in the central nervous system (CNS) limits the recovery of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions after various CNS injuries and diseases. Although pre-clinical studies have identified a number of manipulations that stimulate some degree of axon growth after CNS damage, the extent of recovery remains quite limited, emphasizing the need for improved therapies. Here, we used traumatic injury to the mouse optic nerve as a model system to test the effects of combining several treatments that have recently been found to promote axon regeneration without the risks associated with manipulating known tumor suppressors or oncogenes. The treatments tested here include TPEN, a chelator of mobile (free) zinc (Zn2+); shRNA against the axon growth-suppressing transcription factor Klf9; and the atypical growth factor oncomodulin combined with a cAMP analog. Whereas some combinatorial treatments produced only marginally stronger effects than the individual treatments alone, co-treatment with TPEN and Klf9 knockdown had a substantially stronger effect on axon regeneration than either one alone. This combination also promoted a high level of cell survival at longer time points. Thus, Zn2+ chelation in combination with Klf9 suppression holds therapeutic potential for promoting axon regeneration after optic nerve injury, and may also be effective for treating other CNS injuries and diseases.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29106981\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5745290\n\nAbstract\n\nThe purpose of this study was to characterize whether induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) affect survival of grafted retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after transplantation.For in vitro studies, human iPSCs were either directly cocultured with mouse RGCs or plated in hanging inserts in RGC cultures for 1 week. For ex vivo studies, RGCs and iPSCs were seeded onto the inner surface of an adult rat retina explant and cultured for 1 week. For in vivo studies, RGCs and iPSCs were intravitreally coinjected into an adult rat eye 1 week before examining retinas by explant and immunostaining.A dose-dependent increase in RGC survival was observed in RGC-iPSC direct cocultures, and RGC-iPSC indirect cocultures showed a similar RGC protective effect, but to a lesser extent than in direct coculture. Enhanced RGC survival was also identified in RGC-iPSC cotransplantations to adult retinas ex vivo and in vivo. In addition, RGCs with iPSC cotransplantation extended significantly longer neurites than RGC-only transplants.Human iPSCs promote transplanted RGC survival and neurite extension. This effect may be mediated at least partially through secretion of diffusible neuroprotective factors.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29625481\n\nAbstract\n\nCell-based therapies to replace corneal endothelium depend on culture methods to optimize human corneal endothelial cell (HCEC) function and minimize endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EnMT). Here we explore contribution of low-mitogenic media on stabilization of phenotypes in vitro that mimic those of HCECs in vivo.HCECs were isolated from cadaveric donor corneas and expanded in vitro, comparing continuous presence of exogenous growth factors (\"proliferative media\") to media without those factors (\"stabilizing media\"). Identity based on canonical morphology and expression of surface marker CD56, and function based on formation of tight junction barriers measured by trans-endothelial electrical resistance assays (TEER) were assessed.Primary HCECs cultured in proliferative media underwent EnMT after three to four passages, becoming increasingly fibroblastic. Stabilizing the cells before each passage by switching them to a media low in mitogenic growth factors and serum preserved canonical morphology and yielded a higher number of cells. HCECs cultured in stabilizing media increased both expression of the identity marker CD56 and also tight junction monolayer integrity compared to cells cultured without stabilization.HCECs isolated from donor corneas and expanded in vitro with a low-mitogenic media stabilizing step before each passage demonstrate more canonical structural and functional features and defer EnMT, increasing the number of passages and total canonical cell yield. This approach may facilitate development of HCEC-based cell therapies.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29625488\n\nAbstract\n\nWhat pathways specify retinal ganglion cell (RGC) fate in the developing retina? Here we report on mechanisms by which a molecular pathway involving Sox4/Sox11 is required for RGC differentiation and for optic nerve formation in mice in vivo, and is sufficient to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells into electrophysiologically active RGCs. These data place Sox4 downstream of RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST) in regulating RGC fate, and further describe a newly identified, Sox4-regulated SUMOylation site in Sox11, which suppresses Sox11's nuclear localization and its ability to promote RGC differentiation, providing a mechanism for the SoxC familial compensation observed here and elsewhere in the nervous system. These data define novel regulatory mechanisms for this SoxC molecular network, and suggest pro-RGC molecular approaches for cell replacement-based therapies for glaucoma and other optic neuropathies.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTGlaucoma is the most common cause of blindness worldwide and along with other optic neuropathies is characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Unfortunately, vision and RGC loss are irreversible, and lead to bilateral blindness in around 14% of all diagnosed patients. Differentiating and transplanting RGC-like cells derived from stem cells have the potential to replace neurons that have already been lost and thereby restore visual function. These data uncover new mechanisms of retinal progenitor cell (RPC)- and human stem cell-to-RGC fate specification, and take a significant step towards understanding neuronal and retinal development and ultimately cell transplant therapy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3430-13.2017\n\nView details for PubMedID 28411269\n\nAbstract\n\nIntraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering ophthalmic solutions that inhibit Rho-associated protein kinases (Rock) and norepinephrine transporters (Net) are currently under clinical evaluation. Here we evaluate topical application of one such drug for its effects on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival and axon regeneration after optic nerve crush injury. We performed unilateral optic nerve crush on young rats (P18) and topically applied Rock/Net inhibitor AR-13324 or placebo 3 times a day for 14 days. IOP was measured starting 3 days before and up to 9 days after injury. On day 12, cholera toxin B (CTB) was injected intravitreally to trace optic nerve regeneration. On day 14, retinas and optic nerves were collected. The retinas were flat-mounted and stained with RBPMS to quantify RGC survival and the optic nerves were sectioned for optic nerve axon quantification using fluorescent and confocal microscopy. Rock phosphorylation targets implicated in axon growth including cofilin and LIMK were examined by fluorescence microscopy and quantitative western blotting. AR-13324 lowered IOP as expected. RGC survival and optic nerve axon regeneration were significantly higher with Rock/Net inhibitor treatment compared with placebo. Furthermore, topical therapy decreased Rock target protein phosphorylation in the retinas and proximal optic nerves. These data suggest that topical administration of a Rock/Net inhibitor promotes RGC survival and regeneration after optic nerve injury, with associated molecular changes indicative of posterior drug activity. Coordinated IOP lowering and neuroprotective or regenerative effects may be advantageous in the treatment of patients with glaucoma.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.exer.2016.07.006\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000401784400005\n\nAbstract\n\nProtein kinase A (PKA) plays critical roles in neuronal function that are mediated by different regulatory (R) subunits.
