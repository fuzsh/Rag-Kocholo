        "text": "The Mighty Echoes are an American a cappella doo-wop quartet from Los Angeles, California. The group was formed backstage at the Olio Theater in Silverlake, California during the production of Harvey Shield’s 1986 musical \"1284: The Pied Piper\".\n\nThe Echoes went on to appear on many TV shows including “Frank's Place”, “Family Matters”, “Brooklyn Bridge”, “Murphy Brown” a stint as Tony Danza's high school singing group on \"Who's The Boss\" and recent appearances on “It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia” and “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody”. The group appeared in one feature film, the Dennis Quaid / Debra Winger vehicle, Wilder Napalm. In the film, they sing Ring Of Fire, Heatwave, Duke Of Earl & I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire. In his book, American Singing Groups: a History From 1940 to Today, Jay Warner calls the Echoes \"the West Coast equivalent of the best East Coast A Cappella groups of the last 20 years.\""
