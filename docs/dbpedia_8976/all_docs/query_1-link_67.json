        "text": "ALAMEDA — For someone potentially up for a prestigious musical award as an instrumentalist, Jeff Oster still possesses a flair for words. Something he often says, in particular, has become a type of professional motto:\n\n“I tell my clients that I can offer them two kinds of CDs: one that they can put in their bank and one that they can play in their car. It’s the perfect combination.”\n\nIt all comes with the territory for Oster, a man with two professions.\n\nOn one level, many know the 58-year-old Alameda resident as a financial adviser, branch manager and principal at Raymond James Financial Services on the Island, where among his many functions, he can provide clients with CDs, as in certificates of deposit.\n\nBut Oster also has made his mark on CDs — as in compact discs — as a talented musician, particularly as a flugelhorn player with a touch of trumpet mixed in for good measure.\n\nOster has garnered many raves for his music. Much respect, too. So much that his latest CD, “Next,” could potentially be up for a Grammy Award in the contemporary instrumental album category. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States will announce its final nominations on Monday.\n\n“I’ll be waking up with anxious anticipation that day,” said Oster, who traces his musical background to his childhood with nearly four decades as a professional musician.\n\nAs it is, Oster is no stranger to the Grammys, given his association with producer and Grammy-winning guitarist Will Ackerman, the founder of Windham Hill Records. Oster also has contributed to the recordings of other artists as a longtime session musician. These include “Love’s River” by Laura Sullivan, which won the Grammy for best new age album in 2014.\n\nBut “Next” offers Oster an opportunity for his own time in the spotlight. Already, he has done much to get the album this far along and is hopeful of his prospects of becoming one of the final five Grammy nominees.\n\n“I had a very strong campaign for it this year,” he said. “I had a full-page ad in Billboard, and I have a lot of support.”\n\nOster’s work will face some stiff competition as other possible nominees in the same category might include veteran trumpeter Herb Alpert with his latest release, “Come Fly With Me.”\n\n“It’ll be awesome to be in the final five with Herb Alpert,” Oster said. “That’s a win in itself.”\n\nThose listening to Oster’s music will find it difficult to categorize.\n\n“I’m kind of known as an ambient jazz or electro-jazz flugelhorn player,” Oster said. “It makes it a little hard to market. I’m not where you’d expect a flugelhorn player to be.”\n\nSome describe Oster’s music as “Miles Davis meets Pink Floyd.” Oster, for his part, grew up with the 1930s and 1940s lyrical standards loved by his parents, taking up the trumpet at age 8. He later acquired a passion for progressive rock and jazz funk. Older generations of listeners might even hark back to the A&M Records days of Alpert and especially of Chuck Mangione, whose 1977 hit, “Feels So Good,” inspired Oster to take up the flugelhorn.\n\nOster describes his recordings as “10 percent trumpet,” but brings more of that instrument to his live shows for “a little color.”\n\nAn Alameda resident since 1998, Oster and his wife, Toni, are the parents of Jake, a senior at Encinal High School, and Samantha, a freshman at Alameda Community Learning Center.\n\nJake plays guitar, and Samantha displayed her dancing talents in one of the father’s music videos.\n\n“Alameda’s got any number of inspirational moments,” said Oster, for whom the Elsie Roemer Bird Sanctuary appears in another video.\n\nA veteran of one extended-play recording — the four-song “At Last” in 2004 — and four full CDs since 2005, Oster took an interesting route to where he is today.\n\nA native of Danville, Illinois, Oster later lived in Florida, where he attended Coral Gables High School. He went on to study music at the University of Miami and the University of Oregon before moving to Los Angeles in 1979 in the hope of becoming a full-time musician. Needing to make ends meet while in Southern California, Oster drove a limousine during the day. But even in this capacity, Oster never found himself far from music, as one of his riders — country star Mel Tillis — helped get one of Oster’s songs published.\n\nAt the urging of a friend, Oster became a financial planner. “The financial planning jobs turned into something very secure,” said Oster, in the business since 1987. “It’s the best of both worlds …. I can make music without the financial pressure. I’m pleased with the outcome.”\n\nFYI"
