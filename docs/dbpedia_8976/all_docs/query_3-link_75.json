Itâs foul breath clouded not only the public debate in a historically pivotal election, but threatened to permanently alter the standards by which that discourse is interpreted and judged. Straight faced lying threatened to become an accepted vernacular of the political process. At that time it seemed a surreal and incomprehensible possibility that his campaign might actually succeed, but all of us, including Trump and his minions, were in for a cruel surprise. His stunning victory installed a man of seemingly bottomless corruption and infantile character in a position to alter the course of history in ways we are coming to understand daily in ever more personal ways. The fundamental concepts of democracy and fair play are being challenged in such a bold, shameless and relentless way that renders punch drunk the default condition of public engagement, certainly a tactical political goal. This assault on the central values of a progressive society obviously requires a response and I felt that this song and itâs message was aimed at the heart of the situation and deserved amplification.\" Watch the \"Mendacity\" video @ YouTube!\n\nThe Wardens \"Sleeping Buffalo\" (CD, Own label, 2017).
