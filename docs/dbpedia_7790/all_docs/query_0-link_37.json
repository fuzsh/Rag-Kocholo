        "text": "On the 10th of June 1916, Sherif Hussein Ibn Ali, Amir of Mecca and Keeper of the Holy Cities of Islam, Mecca and Medina, pushed a rifle through the window of his house in Mecca and opened fire on the barracks of the Turkish garrison. The 62-year-old Hussein was an Arab prince, not a military leader, but by this symbolic act of defiance, he signaled the outbreak of the Arab Revolt against the Turks.\n\nOrigins of the Campaign\n\nThe Arabian subcontinent covers a vast area. It would be possible to fit all the countries of Western Europe into it and still have plenty of space left over. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, most Arabia formed part of the Ottoman Empire. The exceptions were the territories included in the British protectorates of Kuwait, Aden and the Hadramawt and Oman coastlines. Today, the Ottoman territories would encompass the modern Arab states of Jordan, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. To the north and the north-east, the Arabian region of the Ottoman Empire was bordered by Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and Mesopotamia (Iraq), which were also part of the empire.\n\nOttoman power, therefore, stretched from Constantinople (Istanbul) in European Turkey as far as Hudayda in the Yemen. Its citizens included Muslims of both Sunni and Shi’ite traditions, Christians of various traditions and also Jews. While Ottoman rule in Arabia had been merged in the 16th century, by 1914, the relationship with the tribal peoples of this region of the empire was, many times, far from cordial. The total population of Arabia and the territories stretching as far as Syria numbered around six million people, and this included both settled and nomadic Arabs.\n\nThe years immediately preceding the outbreak of the war saw the development of a growing discontent among the population of these regions. The wider population within the Ottoman Empire recognized that the administration had changed following the ‘Young Turks’ revolution of 1908-1909, which had dethroned Sultan Abdülhamit II. While Ottoman sultans continued to rule for another 14 years, actual power was now in the hands of the members of the Committee of Union and Progress. In real terms, political control was exercised by Talat Pasha (Minister of the Interior), Enver Pasha (Minister of War) and Mehmed Cemal Pasha (‘Büyük’ or Djemal Pasha, Minister of the Marine). Relations between the Arab leaders and this new regime were initially cordial, they soon soured as the more tolerant Ottoman approach to the administration of the regions was replaced by a more authoritarian form of government. For many, the Ottoman Islamic Empire had been replaced by a Turkish Empire.\n\nThis growing discontent was also set against a backdrop of real military difficulty for the Turkish Government. During the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire had lost control of extensive areas of its territory following a series of military defeats. Egypt, which had formerly been an Ottoman province, was now effectively in British control. The years that immediately followed the founding of the Young Turks government had seen a series of international confrontations. In 1908, Turkey lost Bosnia-Herzegovina to Austria-Hungary. Following a campaign in North Africa in 1911-1912, it lost Libya to Italy and, after the First Balkan War of 1912, it lost control of Macedonia. Before the outbreak of World War I, therefore, the Ottoman or Turkish Empire was on the brink of collapse, an event that had been predicted by many since the mid-19th century.\n\nWWI Through Arab Eyes - An Al Jazeera documentary about the origins of the Arab Revolt during World War I, the events surrounding ‘The Great War’ and its legacy from an Arab perspective.\n\nFrom an international perspective, the apparent political and military weakness of the Ottoman Empire was doubly worrying as it came at a time of increasing German influence within Turkey. Britain and France found that their links with Turkey, which had once been strong, were being constantly eroded while Germany was openly wooing the new administration. Kaiser Wilhelm II visited Turkey in 1889 and 1898, and these visits coincided with a phase of German interest and investment in the Ottoman Empire. This soon came to be focused on railway projects as Germany supplied the engineers, railway equipment and funding for a series of railways across the Ottoman Empire. The most controversial of these was the Constantinople-Baghdad Railway, which was begun in 1888 but became the subject of international protests from Britain.\n\nIn 1892, a new rail link was built to link Constantinople with Ankara. From an Arab perspective, the Hejaz Railway, which was completed between 1900 and 1908, not only facilitated pilgrimages to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina but also merged Ottoman power in the Hejaz. The German influence in these projects was worrying and, in the years, immediately before World War I, this influence focused on overtly military issues. There had been a German military mission in Turkey between 1886 and 1895 and, in December 1913, a new mission was established under the command of General Liman von Sanders. This German mission then facilitated the re-arming and reform of the Ottoman Army, providing instructors for new weaponry and also allowing Ottoman officers to attend German military colleges.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of international tension, among the peoples of Syria, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Arabia, the forces of nationalism were also at work. This was reflected in the development of several secret societies. In Mesopotamia, the Ahad society was formed, which included many Ottoman army officers of Iraqi birth. The most prominent society in Syria was the al-Fatat society, which was predominantly urban based and included intellectuals, civil servants, and men of the landed class in its numbers. The overlord of Syria, Nuri ash Shalaan, contemplated revolt but was too near the seat of Turkish power to do so effectively. There were a series of crack- downs on these secret societies between 1914 and 1916, which saw several of the leaders executed.\n\nFurther south in Arabia, there was also much discontent among the tribal peoples, and this focused on the perceived irreligious nature of the new Turkish Government and, in more practical terms, its taxation policies. Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, who was affiliated with the fanatical Wahabi sect, controlled central Arabia with his center of power at Najd. In 1914, however, he was isolated and far from sources of possible military aid. It must also be pointed out that several tribes remained fiercely loyal to the Ottoman Government. The most significant of these was the Shammar tribe, led by Ibn Rashid, which dominated north-central Arabia and had its power base at Ha’il.\n\nIncreasingly, the focus of the potential revolt came to the center of the Hejaz region of Arabia, which bordered the Red Sea and also included the holy cities of both Mecca and Medina. The Hashemite clan, direct descendants of the Prophet Muhammad who traditionally controlled the holy cities, ruled this region. The head of the clan, Sharif Hussein ibn Ali, became the focus of nationalist aspirations in the region. Before the war had even broken out, he had sent his second son, the Emir Abdullah ibn Hussein, on a secret mission to Cairo. While there, Abdullah met with Lord Kitchener, who was the commander-in-chief of Egypt.\n\nKitchener, who had much experience of Egypt and the wider Red Sea area, recognized the potential of a revolt in Arabia against the Ottoman Government and gave the scheme his tacit approval. His appointment as Minister of War in August 1914 effectively removed him from the Middle East theater of operations and perhaps denied the Arabs one of their greatest potential allies. After Britain’s formal declaration of war against Turkey in November 1914, Arab revolutionary plans gained a greater significance in British strategy. Throughout 1915, links were maintained with the Red Sea port towns of the Hejaz and both small arms and money were shipped to Arabia in aid of the Hashemite cause.\n\nAlthough Britain had been sending military aid to the Hejaz throughout 1915, the outbreak of the revolt took the British staff in Cairo and the world by surprise. In the summer of 1916, the immediate revolt of Hashemite Arabs against Ottoman rule seemed unlikely. The fortunes of the main Allied powers were at a low ebb. On the Western Front, not only were both the main Allied armies bogged down but France was still enduring the continued German offensive at Verdun. Previous Allied efforts against the Ottomans had also not fared well. The Gallipoli operation had come to an inglorious end in January 1916 while Britain’s campaign in Mesopotamia was producing further humiliations, General Townshend having surrendered at Kut on 30 April. Throughout 1915 and 1916, Britain seemed paralysed along the Suez Canal and in Aden.\n\nA series of short-term factors forced Sharif Hussein’s hand. It now seems certain that he was being pressured by Arab nationalists both from within his own camp and from as far away as Syria to take immediate action. Religious factors also played a part as Islamic leaders urged a holy war, or jihad, against the Ottomans who had entered an alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, both infidel nations. Hussein would also seem to have feared a crackdown against those who opposed the Ottoman administration in the Hejaz.\n\nGiven the recent execution of nationalist leaders in Damascus, he was probably in no doubt about what his own fate would be, and also that of his sons. His contacts in Constantinople informed him that Sharif Ali Haidar, leader of the rival Zaid branch of the Prophet Muhammad’s descendents, was being groomed by the Ottoman Government to replace him as emir of Mecca. For their part, the Ottoman command was not insensible to developments in the Hejaz and, since May 1916, had moved increasing numbers of troops to the region. For Hussein and the Hashemite cause, quick action became imperative, and, on 10 June 1916, the flag of revolt was raised at Mecca.\n\nAs the revolt was breaking out, T. E. Lawrence was a lowly lieutenant working for the Intelligence Department in Cairo. Regardless of his own sense of self-belief, he never imagined that the events of the next two years would place him in the public eye to such a degree as they did. By 1920, he would enjoy an international reputation, but in 1916, there seemed to be no potential for this situation to come about.\n\nChronology\n\n1914\n\nAprilThe Emir Abdullah ibn Hussein, the son of Sharif Hussein of Mecca, travels to Cairo for secret negotiations with Lord Kitchener and the British military and political staff.\n\n29 OctoberThe Ottoman Empire declares war on the Allied powers.\n\n1915\n\nArms and money are shipped by the British across the Red Sea to the forces of Sharif Hussein of Mecca throughout the year, hoping to encourage a revolt against Ottoman rule.
