        "text": "Citation preview\n\nCurt Pru¨fer was one of Germany’s leading diplomats in the early twentieth century, serving the Kaiser’s government, the Weimar Republic and the Nazis. During World War I, he was stationed in the Middle East, where he attempted to orchestrate – by various means, both official and informal – Ottoman participation in the war on the side of the Germans. Kevin Morrow is a researcher and translator with a wide range of experience amongst historical archives. He previously worked on the research team for Scott Anderson’s Lawrence in Arabia (2013).\n\n“This is an exceptional work of editing. Kevin Morrow has produced a very good translation with a flowing narrative supported by an amazing body of notes that will help readers – both academics and general readership – to understand the context. The diary of Curt Pru¨fer, long forgotten, will shed light on previously little-known events that took place in the Middle East during the war and will help to reassess the German role in the region. This diary proves once more that the Middle Eastern front was not a sideshow.” – Roberto Mazza, Lecturer at the University of Limerick and author of Jerusalem from the Ottomans to the British (I.B.Tauris, 2013) and Jerusalem in World War I: the Palestine Diary of a European Consul (I.B.Tauris, 2015). “In this remarkable book, Kevin Morrow reveals a crucial source: the diaries of important early twentieth-century diplomatic actor Curt Pru¨fer. These illuminate the Ottoman preparations for the conquest of Egypt, the daily life in the desert and the relations between Turks and Germans during this period. The book offers readers a lively and unique description of what happened on the Palestinian front, and includes valuable information on the period’s various nationalist movements, from Zionism to Arabism, and their relations with the Ottoman and German authorities. The detailed footnotes masterfully contextualize the entries and will enable readers to better understand the text. Germany’s Covert War in the Middle East fills a significant gap in the history of the Great War and is essential reading for anyone hoping to understand the German and Turkish concerns in the Middle East during World War I, as well as the course of events on the Palestinian front.” – M.

In transliterating Arabic and Ottoman Turkish words, I have used the IJMES standard. Inevitably, the scholar of late Ottoman history must decide whether to refer to the Ottoman Empire and its peoples as “Ottomans” or “Turks”. By 1914, the Turkish rulers of the Ottoman Empire themselves were moving towards rejecting the empire’s ancient collective, multi-ethnic identity in favor of an increasingly mono-cultural, Turkish identity; most Westerners, including Pru¨fer and his German colleagues, used the term “Turks”. In deference to historical usage, I will refer to the empire’s leaders (and the instruments of their will, such as the army) as “Turks” and the Empire as “Ottoman”.\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\nAA AWM BL FA 300 HIA NAK NARA NfO PAAA SO TPC\n\nAuswa¨rtige Amt Australian War Memorial British Library Fliegerabteilung 300 Pascha Hoover Institution Archives, Stanford University National Archives of the United Kingdom at Kew National Archives and Records Administration (US) Nachrichtenstelle fu¨r den Orient Politische Archiv des Auswa¨rtigen Amtes Special Organization Trina Prufer Collection\n\nSinai map Map of the northern half of Sinai taken from The Times History of the War.

Immigration officials at the port of Alexandria had detained him for questioning upon his arrival from Constantinople, and his answers to their questions weren’t adding up. The British Empire was now at war with Germany.2 Why was this man, an admitted German citizen, trying to re-enter Egypt, when most other Germans had already left or been expelled?3 Was Mors really returning because the German government had released him from military service, as he claimed? And what was his business in Constantinople, the rumored source of growing threats against British power in the Middle East?4 A search of the suspicious character’s luggage yielded two boxes of blasting caps for dynamite. Officials also found a hand-drawn map of the nearby Suez Canal and slips of paper with cyphered messages hidden on his person.5 Clearly, they had caught an enemy spy and saboteur. Initial interrogations pried only vague hints out of Mors. Eventually, though, the prisoner spilled details of a Turco-German plot to wage a campaign of bombings, guerrilla attacks and Islamist propaganda that would incite all Egypt to revolt, opening the door to a Turkish conquest (with German help). These revelations hardly surprised the British. For a generation, as Europeans prepared for World War I, German Foreign Office adventurists had advocated the incitement of holy war among Muslims in rival empires. This stratagem, they claimed, would bring victory by diverting\n\n2\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nenemy troops away from fighting fronts in Europe, and better yet, win for Germany an expanded postwar sphere of influence in Ottoman lands.6 But that had just been talk. Now, according to the whispered rumors reaching British ears, the Germans and Turks had graduated to plotting acts of war. Mors’ confession provided a wealth of chilling details of the looming threat,7 but the British still lacked a crucial piece of the big picture: a secret treaty signed on 2 August that committed the neutral Turks to enter the war as allies of Germany.8 Each country had its own reasons for seeking the alliance. The Turks needed a powerful, resource-rich European protector to buy them enough respite from foreign aggression to reinvent themselves as a strong, independent state. Germany needed the Turks to block Russian moves against its ally Austria-Hungary, and to protect German investments throughout the Ottoman Empire.9 In the end, both nations came crashing down to defeat. The Germans committed a catastrophic blunder in allying itself with a country that was too weak to fight a global war. The Turks, for their part, further sabotaged the joint war effort in the Middle East through its brutal internal repressions10 which destroyed desperately needed manpower and damaged the loyalties of its own subjects. Consequently, the Turks not only lost the war, but their entire empire as well. Ultimate responsibility for entering the war unprepared lay with the Turks. The Germans, however, enabled the Turkish meltdown by equipping them to fight, by refusing to restrain and even helping to carry out their self-destructive war policies. Consequently, the wartime actions of both sowed the seeds of the bloody turmoil and violence that have convulsed the Middle East since 1918. Few played a more integral, active role in the events leading to the Ottoman downfall than Dr Curt Pru¨fer, a German secret agent outed by Mors. Throughout his four years of service to the Turco-German war machine in the Ottoman Empire, Pru¨fer travelled everywhere, saw everything and came to know everyone of significance in that theater of war. He attended the councils of its top leaders; he fought as a soldier in many of its battles; he spied on its enemies and churned out propaganda to rally enemy and Ottoman Muslim support for the Ottoman cause. And all the while, he was watching, listening and recording everything in diaries and reports to the German Foreign Office that are translated here in English en toto for the first time.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nThe Pru¨fer material restores a virtual encyclopedia of long-forgotten historical details once known only to World War I’s losers. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Great War exploits of Germany’s desert fighters did gain brief attention, but ultimately, the tremendous acclaim lavished on their chief opponent, T.E. Lawrence,11 and the stigma of German war service following the two world wars, stole their thunder. Pru¨fer and his fellow “German Lawrences” subsequently sank into the nameless obscurity inevitably reserved for the defeated. This book attempts to remedy this imbalance. The account that follows is many things: a spy drama, a war story, a travelogue, even a cautionary tale. Above all, it constitutes testimony to the fact that sometimes those on the wrong side of history have an equally riveting and useful tale to tell. This, in Curt Pru¨fer’s words, is their story.\n\nTHE PREWAR YEARS\n\nIn February 1907, Curt Pru¨fer entered the imperial German consular service as a dragoman1 at the German general consulate in Cairo.2 The consulate was lucky to have received star talent like Pru¨fer. Gifted in learning foreign tongues, he spoke French, English and Italian fluently and understood Russian, Spanish and Portugese.3 His true gift, though, lay in his powerful command of Arabic. Fellow Arabist Paul Kahle later said that “there were only a few Arabists in Germany at the time who could speak and write modern Arabic and be active in the Arabic press like him”.4 Officially, Pru¨fer was hired to provide interpretation and translation services, and to dispense legal advice.5 Under the guidance of Max von Oppenheim,6 the consulate’s Arab-world expert, the young dragoman soon plunged headfirst into Germany’s shadow war against British power in Egypt. Pru¨fer egged on pan-Islamist and Egyptian nationalist rabblerousers. He harangued British authorities in the press. At least once, he and Oppenheim toured Egypt and Syria in Arab dress, preaching against British rule to bedouin shaykhs.7 During the Turco– Italian War (1911– 12), he recruited Egyptians to fight in Libya, a conflict he spun as an attack by Western infidels on the global Islamic community.8 Surveillance by increasingly annoyed British authorities eventually began to shrink the scope of Pru¨fer’s activities, culminating in his rejection in 1912 as candidate for the directorship of the national khedivial library and its precious collection of Arabic, Persian and Ottoman manuscripts.9 With little left to accomplish there, Pru¨fer resigned from the AA on 12 November 1913.10\n\nTHE PREWAR YEARS\n\n5\n\nThe former dragoman traveled through Egypt for seven months with German painter Richard von Below following his resignation, afterwards translating eleventh-century Arabic verse to accompany Below’s sketches of Egyptian life. He continued writing newspaper articles on Egyptian culture, and wrote an entry on the Egyptian Arabic dialect for the 1914 edition of Baedekers A¨gypten. Back in Germany, he lectured for a few weeks on Oriental languages in Munich.11 The outbreak of war on 28 July 1914 abruptly cut short Pru¨fer’s aimless wanderings. Excited at the chance to practice the covert arts on a larger world stage, he wrote to the Foreign Office on 1 August to volunteer his services for “inciting unrest in Egypt”. The Foreign Office accepted, and less than a month later, Pru¨fer was en route to Constantinople to provide intelligence and propaganda services in the Middle East.12 This first decade of Pru¨fer’s government service could not have happened at a more auspicious time in his country’s history. Germany’s economy and population had mushroomed rapidly following the nation’s political unification in 1871, leading many Germans to believe that their new wealth and power entitled them to an overseas empire like their European neighbors. While Germany’s leadership did not initially share this view, the accession of emperor Wilhelm II in 1888 elevated demands for Germany’s “place in the sun” to a national obsession. A growing belief that Germany’s neighbors sought to thwart this through hostile, geographically encircling alliances only further underlined the urgency of Germany’s imperialist agenda.13 One noisy imperialist faction demanded the advance of Germany’s empire through military conquest and annexation. Most German imperialists, including Pru¨fer himself, advocated a more peaceful penetration of foreign regions by economic, cultural and political means,14 regions such as the Ottoman Empire. Germany had previously shown little interest in Ottoman lands before the 1880s,15 but when the Ottoman bankruptcy of 1875 moved Britain to abandon its long-time protectorship of the Empire, Germany pressed in to fill the void. Over the next few decades, Germany began pouring credit into Ottoman coffers, building vast railway systems throughout Ottoman domains, and sending military advisors to help the Turks modernize their armed forces.16 The kaiser personally encouraged these investments, particularly by his two state visits to Sultan Abdu¨lhamid II in 1889 and 1898.17\n\n6\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nUnfortunately, Germany’s new Ottoman partner was in the throes of a prolonged collapse. Throughout the nineteenth century, repeated military interventions by European powers on behalf of oppressed religious and ethnic minorities had inflicted tremendous territorial losses on the Ottoman Empire.18 Under the influence of internal separatist movements, other Ottoman provinces had detached themselves to form independent nations. To keep his disintegrating empire together, the increasingly paranoid sultan Abdu¨lhamid fought back against internal sedition and disloyalty with brutal, police-state tactics, earning him nicknames abroad like “Abdul the Damned” and “the Red Sultan”.19 An army revolt in July 1908, spearheaded by the clandestine Committee for Unity and Progress (CUP) – the Young Turks – finally broke the back of the Hamidian dictatorship. Spontaneous public displays of joy and solidarity broke out across the Empire, inspired by hopes for restored constitutional government and civil freedoms, especially for ethnic and religious minorities.20 High hopes for a new, peaceful “union of peoples” under the Ottoman umbrella21 quickly soured under the stress of counterrevolution, subsequent one-party dictatorship, a war with Italy (1911– 12), and two wars (1912–13) in the Balkans.22 As a result of the collective national trauma inflicted by these catastrophes23 and mounting fears of imperial collapse or partition, the empire’s Turkish leadership openly adopted Turkish nationalism as a guiding principle of national salvation in place of the now-discredited Ottomanism. This ideology proclaimed Muslim people of Turkish blood and language as superior, a dominant “ruling nation” consolidated around an Anatolian homeland with an Arab periphery, an ethnic primacy that demanded the ethnic cleansing of Anatolia24 from nonTurkish, non-Muslim elements. This goal became possible in late 1913 and early 1914 with the formation of the first CUP government, represented by a triumvirate of leaders who now became the public face of a new dictatorship.25 At the triumvirate’s head stood the ruthless Ismail Enver Pasha, “Napoleonlık” to his friends. Enver, appointed Minister of War in January 1914, believed himself to be a “man of destiny” divinely chosen to rule a glorious, revived empire.26 Easily the most pro-German of the three, Enver admired German military power and efficiency, a legacy of his service as a military attache´ in Berlin.27 Mehmet Talaat Pasha, appointed\n\nTHE PREWAR YEARS\n\n7\n\ninterior minister in June 1913,28 was known for his rough, straighttalking manner. Nonetheless, his reputation for moderation earned him the nickname “the Danton of the Turkish Revolution”.29 Also fiercely nationalistic, Talaat later brought a bloody stain to his moderate name through his role in designing and carrying out the Armenian genocide.30 The troika’s junior member, navy minister Ahmet Djemal Pasha, was a mercurial man capable of both graciousness and terrifying cruelty, appropriate qualities for his role as the absolute wartime despot of Syria, Palestine and Arabia, and as commander of military and intelligence operations in the Middle East.31 In the months before the outbreak of World War I, the prime threat to the empire’s security was aggressive Russian expansionism seeking to seize the Ottoman Armenian provinces in the north-east. The new CUP leadership resolved to achieve permanent liberation from such foreign meddling by buying themselves breathing space for internal reform under the protection of a strong European power. Accordingly, the Turks began approaching each of the European powers with alliance proposals throughout 1914.32 All attempts failed. Even the Germans initially shot down an alliance offer made to German ambassador Hans von Wangenheim33 on 22 July. Most top German decision makers – Wangenheim, German military advisory mission chief General Otto Liman von Sanders,34 Foreign Minister Gottlieb von Jagow, to whom the Austro–Hungarians first broached the idea of a Turkish alliance on 14 July, and even the kaiser – had grave doubts about Turkish military strength. In a fateful decision, Kaiser Wilhelm overruled Wangenheim in hopes of creating a Turkish – Bulgarian– Rumanian coalition to place between Austria – Hungary and the oncoming Russians. Even when the Balkan coalition failed to materialize, the Germans tried to enlist the Turks as allies anyway to avoid driving them into the arms of the Triple Entente alliance (Britain, France and Russia).35 The Turks were determined to exploit the Germans’ strategic needs for the maximum benefit possible. One specific condition for German acceptance was a promise from the Turks to “undertake some action against Russia”. To fulfill this condition, Enver offered two dreadnought battleships just built for the Turkish navy by the British (Reshadieh and Sultan Osman I). Wangenheim consequently signed the treaty on 2 August, not knowing as Enver did that the British had already\n\n8\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nconfiscated the ships for themselves on 31 July. Just days later, the Turks saved the German warships Goeben and Breslau by “purchasing” them as they fled towards Constantinople pursued by British warships, but not without extracting more concessions: a German promise to help the Turks regain lost territories in the Aegean Sea and the Caucasus region, permanent abolition of the hated capitulations, and the payment of a “war indemnity”. Once again, a score for the Turks at the expense of their German allies.36 With the treaty now signed, all that remained to decide was how and when the Turks would enter the war. Meanwhile, planning for anticipated military operations went full steam ahead.37 The first target: the Suez Canal. The canal constituted the most vital artery connecting the British home islands to India, crown jewel of the British Empire. Sever the canal, and Britain would lose Egypt, a potentially fatal blow.38 Key to taking Egypt were Egyptian Muslims, who, the Germans and Turks gambled, were disgruntled with British rule and ripe for revolt. The AA, tasked with spearheading this campaign, began assembling skilled, experienced agitators to help set Egypt aflame through propaganda, and agents to spy out enemy troop strengths and fortifications. Men like Curt Pru¨fer were made for such covert operations. He had gained tremendously valuable experience through his subversive activities in Egypt. Experience aside, Pru¨fer also possessed the inborn traits of a good spy. The man knew how to manage and manipulate people with a disarming, pleasant manner, to listen and observe carefully, and to win other people’s trust by sympathizing with them and adopting their manner of speaking and thinking. And at all times, the ever chameleonlike Pru¨fer knew how to don different masks to suit different audiences: the suave, well-dressed European expatriate; the roving, Western bohemian traveler; the Arab man on the street.39 These undeniable strengths nonetheless proved wholly inadequate for overcoming the difficulties of running covert operations in an underresourced theater of a global war. The holy war’s directors in Berlin offered Pru¨fer and his colleagues little intelligence and propaganda infrastructure to work with, and poor, sometimes haphazard leadership as well, while their Turkish allies imposed restrictions that frequently hindered or\n\nTHE PREWAR YEARS\n\n9\n\nsabotaged their work. Pru¨fer and his colleagues would have to improvise on the fly.40 Pru¨fer very rarely commented on his personal feelings and opinions about the war effort or about the war itself. He only broke his silence just after the end of the war, claiming that “from the beginning onward, I believed [Germany] to be pursuing a war of self-defense”, rather than a war of imperial aggression for territorial gain motivated by what he scorned as “hurrah patriotism”.41 Pru¨fer was a cynical realist, not an imperialist ideologue. He was also a loyal German patriot who, while willing to criticize German leadership and tactics, never doubted the righteousness of the German cause or its people. That cause would compel Pru¨fer to carry out imperialist policies he later openly claimed to despise, an acceptable price, as he saw it, for defending the Fatherland. As Pru¨fer headed for Constantinople in August 1914, these reflections lay four years in the future. For now, as the eventful summer drew to an end, there was business to be done . . .\n\n1914\n\nCHAPTER 1 1914\n\n28 August 19141 Departure from Berlin, 10:00 in the morning. On the train, Richter and H.H. In Dresden, arrival 1:00. Picked up by privy councillor MeyerWaldeck2 and his family, who is related to Mors. There through noon and evening because our train is not going any further. Afternoon, shopping in the city. Arrival of the news about the victory over the British at St Quentin.3 Meyer-Waldeck accompanies us to the train, on which we travel further at 9:30.\n\n29–31 August 1914 Arrival in Vienna4 early in the morning. Received at the embassy by the head of the chancellery. We spend the day in the coffee houses. News of a massive battle in Galicia and Russian Poland without result.5 In Vienna, enthusiastic war sentiment everywhere. In the evening, continued on to Budapest. Arrival on 30 August in the morning. Because the chancellery servant from the general consulate recommended to us was nowhere to be found at first, we missed the train to Bucharest.6 This also resulted from the difficulties in transferring the large baggage. The reception by the general consul Count Friedheim is somewhat cool because he is seemingly offended at having to wait for us at the train station in vain. In the afternoon, outing to Ofen.7 Traveling further on 31 August at 7:35 in the morning. On the Rumanian border, unfriendly attitude among border officials. On the way, we meet several trains which are bringing Austrian troops from the Serbian to the Russian theater of war.\n\n14\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nTremendous enthusiasm. In Bucharest, hostile mood.8 News of the victory at Ortelsburg.9 Rumania is swarming with soldiers.\n\n2 September 1914 Traveling further on to Rustchuk.10 On the train with us: Imperial and Royal11 vice consul Haas, who is going to Salonika.12 At the Bulgarian border, more friendly attitude among the population.13 Arrival in the evening in Sofia.14 On the train, Pfu¨tzner, who is temporarily doing service at the legation. Traveled further on the same evening.\n\n3 September 1914 Midday in Adrianople.15 In the compartment, a Turkish major who spoke very confidently about the prospect of a Turkish intervention in the conflict. Arrival late in the evening in Cospoli.16 Was picked up by the mouche.17 Arrival in Therapia at around 2:00 at night. Received by Privy Councillor Mu¨ller, waiting punctiliously and suspicious. Hotel Tokatlian.\n\n4 September 1914 Early visit to the embassy. Weber,18 Stumm,19 Scharfenberg,20 Haas,21 Wangenheim, Humann,22 Kalisch.23 Scho¨nberg is visiting.24 I have the impression of non-cooperation between the naval rear-echelon command (Humann) and embassy. Contradictory messages. Weber visibly little edified about my presence. At noon with Weber, Scharfenberg also there. Afterwards, long conversation with Scharfenberg in the park. Speaks derisively about our doctrinaire, exaggeratedly moralistic policy. Later with Mors at Humann’s. Wangenheim also there. Impression: scatter-brained, mercurial, easily influenced, responsive. Humann promises a meeting with Enver. Later, conversation with Weber, who comments ill-temperedly about his position and the ambassador. In the evening, at the Tokatlian. Conversation with Laffert,25 Stumm. Nothing new. Turkey – at least Enver in his entourage: Talaat, Halil26 and Djemal (!) – would like to make use of the moment. The grand vizier is hesitating out of fear of England.27 The actual instruments of power for the Turks seem questionable. The Dardanelles are up to this point\n\n1914\n\n15\n\nneither sufficiently armed nor blocked with mines. The VIII Corps28 (Damascus) is in Laffert’s opinion worth as much as a regiment. Here, the purpose seems to consist of precipitating incidents through an action of the Goeben.29 A German escort cruiser, the Hapag, is lying in front of Therapia. Eighty naval officers are in Cospoli.30\n\n5 September 1914 Visit31 to the Ministry of War with Weber and Mosel32 at the office of ¨ mer Fevzi Bey,33 the head of the Department for Egypt and India. O Fevzi comments very unfavorably about the trustworthiness of the khedive34 and the people around him. He means to take care of getting leaflets35 to Egypt in each of the desired amounts. I arrange a meeting with Fevzi in the afternoon for the purpose of discussing the Suez Canal action. Weber also goes with me to Fevzi’s rival, Su¨leyman Askeri,36 whom, however, we don’t find. Enver’s adjutant Kazım Bey37 books me for an interview with Askeri at 2:00 in the afternoon. As I go over things again with Mors as the appointed time approaches, none of the men are present. Fevzi’s adjutant claims that his master had waited for me at 2:00, a time which I did not at all agree to with him. He had obviously heard of my appointment with Su¨leyman, then. At 5:00, Sami Bey,38 who is said to be proceeding to Syria, Egypt and Fezzan39 at the expense of the embassy (150 Turkish lira), visited me. Sami is a former Young Turk revolutionary who, as such, was condemned to death and exiled to Fezzan. Later, he became governor of the Najd40 and then of Fezzan. He asks me to seek to bring influence to bear on the Porte,41 particularly Talaat Bey, to finally let him embark on the journey. He says he can’t get through to Talaat, who is perpetually unavailable to talk. He names for me trusted people in Basra42 (Ali al Muhandis), Qunfudha43 (kaimakam44 Kemal Bey), Jidda45 (port commander Bahyat Bey). Later, Mosel shows up and makes the following statements. He knows from a good source in the house of Djavid Bey46 that a discussion of ministers has taken place (excluding the grand vizier Said Halim and Enver) regarding discussion of the following English proposals:47 removal of the German crew of the Goeben and Breslau; retention of the German military mission; acknowledgement of the purchase of the Goeben and Breslau; demobilization of the greater part of the Turkish army. England assumes responsibility for the guarantee of current Turkish agreements\n\n16\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nagainst Russia.48 Turkey abstains from any attack on Greece, to whose support England is said to be contractually obligated. In the event of a Greek –Turkish conflict, England would force the Dardanelles. The council of ministers has agreed to accept these proposals, and furthermore have voted that Enver and Halim would be overthrown. After that and in the evening, I drive to the embassy and make report to Weber about Mosel’s statement. Weber skeptical.\n\n6 September 1914 Relocation from Therapia to the Hotel Germania in Pera. I meet Kalisch on the steamer. He suggests that I use the emir49 Ibn Rashid of Najd against the Suez Canal. Ibn Rashid has for some time been adroitly seeking help at the embassy in order to avoid being crushed by the British and their vassal, the Wahhabi shaykh Ibn Sa’ud. He has, however, been granted it reluctantly.50 At the hotel, I meet Shawish. He judges the situation in Egypt pessimistically, as long as Turkey does not take vigorous action. He is volunteering for the selection and sending of emissaries. I drive with ¨ mer Fevzi unfolds the Mors to the Ministry of War afterwards, where O 51 following plan for me. Maghrebis who had carried on weapon smuggling for the Turks during the Tripoli War52 are to form bands at the canal, which would have to attack the canal posts at night and then scatter again by day. He is declaring himself against the plan of sending Turkish officers because Turkey cannot become involved in an open rupture of neutrality at the present time. He judges Shawish to be a gossip whose service is worthless. Ibn Rashid he considers a scheming upstart who wants to make Germany serviceable for his ambitious plans against his rival and former feudal master, Ibn Sa’ud. He likewise offered his services for the transporting of leaflets by means of emissaries. Mosel brings the news of Farid’s53 arrival. Visit to the embassy. Reception at Frau von Wangenheim’s. Italian ambassador54 and wife are there. Dinner with Kalisch and his charming wife. Ambassador is warning me about Mosel. He was formerly master and chair of a Young Turk lodge in U¨sku¨b,55 and has up to now maintained relations with committee members who are under the influence of the French, and who are consciously misleading him, in Wangenheim’s view. About the upshot of yesterday’s council of ministers, there are many rumors being spread around. At any rate, Talaat’s attitude seems doubtful. Only Enver dared to be absolutely pro-German.\n\n1914\n\n17\n\n7 September 1914 Reception at Enver’s in his konak56 in Nis¸antas¸ı. Introduced by Humann. Enver explains the same band plan which O¨mer Fevzi had communicated to us. A man of stone. A face immovable, well-formed, beautiful in the feminine sense. Groomed to the point of foppishness. At the same time, an outrageous streak of hardness: “We can be more cruel than the British”. The man wants something, but the something does not come. He recommends to us Su¨leyman Askeri. This one visits us at 3:00 in the afternoon. Explanation of the guerrilla plan. In the evening with Fabricius57 in Petit Jardin.58 Shawish asks for blasting caps with Fuad.59 Therapia, 7 September 1914.60 The Imperial Ambassador to the Foreign Office. “Was received today by Enver Pasha, who unfolded plan for Egyptian action: In every mudirieh,61 some bands of 12 to 15 men each are being formed. At the head of every band is a Turkish or Egyptian officer, the greater number of which are already signed up. Goal is surprise attacks on small military posts, assassination attempts, attacks on railroads, telegraph stations, ships. After the attack, the band has to disperse in order to surface elsewhere for new activity. Leadership of all bands put under command of a central coordinating agency.62 Weapons in the country itself hidden, available, as Enver is well-known from the Tripoli War. In addition, connection is sustained through contrebandiers.63 Intends similar guerrilla action from both sides of the Suez Canal against British station posts. Up to now everything is quiet in Egypt and at the canal. Egyptian troops are deploying to Sudan. For that reason, 10,000 Indian troops allegedly sent to Egypt in return. British warships are said to be cruising in and in front of the canal. Ministry of War taking care of shipment of leaflets. First transport tomorrow. Also, Shawish has offered to stick together with me for the same purpose. He requested speedy transfer of automatic pistols. Without knowledge of the Turkish masterplan, khedive, of whose treachery Enver urgently warned, is supposedly going to be used for incitement of the ghafirs64 in the country.\n\n18\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nLeaflet agitation also inaugurated in the Maghrib, India and Caucasus . . . . . . . . .65 is sought in order to reach Egypt via Alexandria as Egyptian officer. Should I depart for Suez Canal Zone? Pru¨fer.” Wangenheim.\n\n8 September 1914 Su¨leyman Askeri comes and suggests chartering a cement ship in Italy that is supposed to run into the Suez Canal.66 Requests Humann’s support. Mors drives to Therapia to fetch 20 detonators for Fuad’s people. Departs at 5:00 today with Khedivial Mail.67 With him, presumptive band leader (a major) and some Young Egyptians. Talaat to the embassy. Weber lukewarm, Humann comments very derogatorily about the embassy: “First concern after their appointment was their coat of tails”. In the evening with Fabricius in Petit Cercle.68\n\n9 September 1914 Visit with General von Sanders at the Ministry of War. A formal council of war takes place in consultation with a large number of German officers. The general tells me that the VIII Corps has now received the order for deployment around Ma’an.69 Ready in Lieutenant Colonel Von Kress’70 view in about three weeks. From there, at least 14 days march up to the canal. At the mission leader’s, great agitation prevails against the ambassador, who allegedly misinforms Berlin on purpose. Landing on Russian Black Sea coast in Souchon’s71 view feasible only with difficulty because naval resources are not sufficient to protect the transports in all instances. Repeal of the capitulations. Great jubilation in the city. Demonstrations out on the streets.72 We are getting tied in knots through declarations which we have given to the Turks in agreeing to alliance in the hope of their active intervention.\n\n10 September 1914 Shawish comes to me, asks for 400 for the sending of four emissaries to Egypt, two via el Qusayr,73 two via es-Sallum.74 Weber opposed. Sami and Fehmi from the Ministry of the Interior visit. Farid75 met with\n\n1914\n\n19\n\nMosel. Babbler who talks much but will do nothing. Considers the khedive sincere. Further demonstrations about the capitulations. In the evening with Spee,76 Mosel, Fabricius, Kress in Petit Champs.\n\n11 September 1914 Forenoon, to the embassy. Weber tells me that I am superfluous here. Ambassador has received a telegram from Berlin that authorizes him to use me otherwise. He certainly has requested it. Weber very chilly. Lo¨ytved77 telegraphs that he has managed to travel across Egypt with a Danish passport. Not much news. Up through the 7th, no Indians in Egypt.\n\n12 September 1914 Weber promises me that he intends to give Shawish 200 for the despatching of two people via al Qusayr. Around 1:00, I meet him at the Tokatlian. He brings the news that Wangenheim has declined the payment because Enver does not think much of Shawish, and control of every action must remain centralized in Enver’s hands. Wassmuss78 turns up. I have lunch with him and Weber. Has traveled on the route from Bushehr to Germany unhindered through Egypt (Suez-Alex). Is supposed to be participating in the Afghan expedition.79 Doesn’t have a very optimistic opinion about the expedition members. Afternoon, visit with Shawish in Stambul.80 Very disappointed about the refusal of his wishes. Said that Admiral Limpus81 had invited him to dinner. Should Wangenheim decide not to pay Shawish, it will be inviting treason. Evening with Wassmuss at the Tokatlian, then in the club and Petit Champs. At 1:00 at night, Schwedler82 arrives from Egypt, appears at my place at the hotel. Reports: British have removed 4,000-man English force from Suez83 to the south, allegedly to Somaliland;84 40,000 Indians arrived; of these, 30,000 to Marseille; regarding the whereabouts of 20,000, nothing known. In Egypt itself, utter quiet. Only Aziz Hassan85 arrested, but set free again. Telephoned to Riecken86 (Mosel).\n\n13 September 1914 Forenoon, Therapia. Ambassador approves my departure. Afternoon, message to Shawish through Muhammad about the falling through of\n\n20\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nhis demand. Weber wants to write to him. With Mosel to Ministry of War to see Fevzi. Discussion about Afghan expedition, which F. will accompany. F. very optimistic. Wants to force passage through Persia with 2,000 Kurds.87 I meet Kress at the ministry. Tells me that the prospects for war equally nil, equally good. Military mission heading to Damascus. Asks for my company. I tell him to meet at the mission there. Two million for bribery of Arabs approved. Sami departs tomorrow with pamphlets in all languages. Visit with Hassan Fehmi. At the hotel, Schwedler. Asks for intervention with Weber in order to get Mu¨ller-Pagwitz’s job. Visit with Fabricius at the club. I read aloud to him a report. Says that Italy has officially declared that it will not be able to remain neutral if the Islamic question is raised.88 Bad news about the fighting at Soissons-Vitry.89 Evening with Wassmuss at the Tokatlian. Says that official news in Therapia is coming from Berlin, that the minister in Peking is reporting: India in uproar. England requested assistance 200,000 men from the Japanese. Promised under conditions: 1). Free hand in China; 2). Unrestricted immigration by Japanese into British colonies.90 England accepts, is summoning Indians from America to Cospoli by telegraph sent out from here. They perhaps are going to process Indians captured in France and summoned here. Indian revolutionaries from Geneva have shown up. At Yanni’s, met three participants in the Afghan expedition. Less than favorable impression (only Herr von Braun, officer, tolerable). Another wire to Alexandria (Eichhorn) concerning Mors to Frau Mors.\n\n14 September 1914 Forenoon, shopping in Stambul. At noon, usual silly meal chatter at the club. Afternoon with Mosel at the Tokatlian. Gives me new, long, Arabic pamphlet about the crimes of the English. To supper with Wassmuss at Wustrow’s.91 Both rather disgusted by the embassy operation. No news from Mors.\n\n15–20 September 1914 Negotiations about my departure. Mors telegraphs, accuses the khedive of treason. Visit with Enver and Liman.\n\n1914\n\n21\n\n20 September 1914 Departure92 in the morning to Eskis¸ehir.93 Arrival there early on the 21st. With us: Lieutenant Colonel Kress, Captain von dem Hagen,94 Captain Sterke,95 Lieutenants Wagner96 and Heiden.97 In addition, General Passelt98 and two majors, as well as several Turkish officers and two orderlies (Hamdi and Gemal), as well as naval Lieutenant Hilgendorff99 and orderly.\n\n21 September 1914 Evening in Konya.100\n\n22 September 1914 Noon in the Taurus101 at Belemedik102 there, most friendly reception by the Swiss chief engineer Leutenegger. In the afternoon, outing to the gorge on the way to Dorak103 by auto. Hilgendorff rides with Heiden to Dorak. We obtain no transport animals, and are returning back to Pozantı.104 At 8:00 in the evening, General Passelt and his expedition split off from us beforehand in Pozantı in order to ride to Erzurum.105\n\n23 September 1914 Departure at 5:00 from Pozantı with four persons and six trucks. Am driving through the magnificent Cilician Gates and over the Taurus Pass.106 Road very deficient. Horses good. Noon in Yeni Khan.107 Arrival 7:00 in the evening in Gu¨lek Bog˘azı.108 From there by train (special car) to Adana.109 There at the train station, consul Dr Bu¨ge,110 to whom I deliver message from the embassy.

There, snack and two hours halt. A horse collapses. A driver comes down with the fever. Drive further to khan around al Hammam. There at supper around 11:00. Hilgendorff turns up with Heiden, who had ridden through the Taurus Gorge to Dorak, gone from there by train to Alexandretta, and in turn from there had traveled further on horseback. Both ride after seven hours. Rest further.113\n\n25 September 1914 Decampment around 3:00 in the morning. Midday rest in ‘Afrin’s khan.114 There, Hilgendorff and Heiden show up at noon on totally exhausted horses. Heading on at 12:30. Hilgendorff drives with us. Heiden and Gemal ride. Arrival at 2:00 in Katma.115 Depart from there at 3:00 with special train to Aleppo,116 where we show up at 4:30. Consul Dr Ro¨ssler117 visits us on the same afternoon at the Hotel Baron. In the evening after eating, I go with Hagen into the German club (mess hall). There, among the Germans, no great enthusiasm.\n\n26 September 1914 Stroll with Hagen in the bazaar and to the citadel. Wonderful oriental scenery. Afternoon visit with consul and Kress. Then a drive to shop in the city. Hilgendorff, who earlier departed for Haifa118 in the morning, is pushing a horse to the point of overexertion. To dinner with Kress and the captains and Wagner at the consul’s. Wife amiable but ugly. There also head engineer Mavrokordato119 of the Baghdad Railway. In the evening afterwards until 12:00 at the club.\n\n27 September 1914 Departure by train at 6:00 to Damascus. Noon in Homs.120 Arrival in the evening in Damascus,121 where we stay at the Hotel Victoria. Meeting with Lo¨ytved.\n\n28 September 1914 Forenoon stroll with Hagen in the bazaar. Lo¨ytved introduces me to Shaykh ‘As’ad ash-Shuqayri.122 At general headquarters, delivery of three boxes for Mecca.\n\n1914\n\n23\n\n29 September 1914 Visit to general headquarters with the commanding general Zeki Pasha123 and to the vilayet with vali124 Hulusi Bey125 and Nazmi Bey, chief of political police. In the afternoon, visit to ‘Abd ar-Rahman Pasha Yusuf126 and Shaykh ‘As’ad. Around 6:00, reciprocal visit of the vali and Nazmi Bey. Two Germans from Alexandria arrive, say they are seeing construction. Hilgendorff had no luck in Haifa, and turned himself around towards Jerusalem. Our officers complain about lack of training of the troops, especially the artillery.\n\n30 September 1914 Visit with ‘Abd ar-Rahman. There, the bedouin shaykhs, who are being won over through medals and gifts, assemble together, among them the shaykh of ‘Aqaba127 and a representative of the sharif of Mecca.128 Through the agency of Shaykh ‘As’ad, all have sworn on the Qur’an for the Islamic cause. Dardanelles closed because Turkish ships threatened with bombardment. In the afternoon, long visit once again with Shaykh ‘As’ad.\n\n1 October 1914 Departure at forenoon to Beirut.129 Underway in Lebanon, overall strongly francophile mood. In Beirut, arrival in afternoon (Hotel Deutscher Hof). Visit with Consul von Mutius,130 to whom I am delivering leaflets. Consul visibly anxious, because English bombardment or landing is feared. In the evening come ludicrous reports of Armenian–Egyptian –Italian support corps for the British, overthrow of Enver Pasha, English ultimatum to the Porte, Haifa railway destroyed.\n\n2 October 1914 Forenoon at 10:00, Mutius shows up, as well as dragoman Gargur. Declares danger imminent. Says he has advised departure to all Germans. Compromising papers, including ciphers and pamphlets, burned. I discuss with him fleeing in case of an English occupation, which I consider improbable. Visit to garrison headquarters and to the\n\n24\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nconsulate. Consul is traveling at 4:00 to his wife in the Lebanon. I visit the vali, Bakir Sami Bey,131 Circassian,132 stuttering, unfavorable, scatter-brained impression. He advises departure at 11:00 in the evening. Promises to get for me a spot, because of great crush of refugees. Asserts he has requested 5,000– 6,000 men for the Lebanon. Beirut would not be defended. “On vous de´teste´ ici cordialement”.133 News about setting-up of a military dictatorship in Egypt confirmed. Khedive is protesting. In the hotel, Emir ‘Arslan,134 Druze135 prince with Russian consul. ‘Abd el ‘Al and Shirkawi have not shown up. Bashir registered by sleight-of-hand. Calm hotel owner, Unger. At 11:00 at night, departure in overflowing train. In the car: Zeki Hakkı Bey. Merchant from Beirut, nephew of ‘Izzat Pasha al ‘Abid.136 Seems pro-German.\n\n3 October 1914 Arrival in Damascus in the morning. Return to the hotel. Afternoon visit with ‘Abd ar-Rahman Pasha and Shaykh ‘As’ad. The latter says of vali of Beirut: he is a relative of Abuk Pasha, who had been involved in the military coup in Chatalja137 and now lives in Beirut. He supposedly is maintaining further suspicious relations with Michel Sursuq138 (he is a gambler and owes him) and has installed the francophile community leader from Beirut. He is doing nothing to oppose the chicanery of the Christians in Lebanon. We have to work through Kress towards getting ¨ mer Fevzi Bey sends word that he has made it to him dismissed.139 O ‘Abd ar-Rahman Pasha in Aleppo. Kress comments about the military capabilities of the VIII Corps and especially the XII Corps140 of Mosul,141 whose commander142 has arrived in Aleppo. Made a reconnaissance trip with Zeki Pasha as far as Zahleh.143 Lebanon in his opinion still impassible for hostile troops. Visit of businessman Halim.\n\n4 October 1914 ‘Ahmad Bey Yusuf, brother of ‘Abd ar-Rahman Pasha, Shaykh ‘As’ad, his nephew, who is a military doctor, and the mufti144 of Haifa145 turn up at my hotel. The mufti is supposed to travel to Egypt and send leaflets across fixed in the bindings of Qur’ans, and send intelligence from Egypt. Impression not entirely favorable. ‘Abd ar-Rahman has traveled\n\n1914\n\n25\n\nto Ma’an to the bedouins. There also, Mu¨mtaz Bey,146 Enver’s adjutant, who is supposed to be organizing guerrilla detachments. Sabih Bey, Zeki Pasha’s chief of staff, is driving to Beirut. Afternoon excursion with Hagen in front of Bab Tuma, the Christian and Jewish quarter. Visit with the consulate deputies Schieffer and Ekrem,147 Wagner and Heiden, who have rented a house in the Christian quarter.\n\n5 October 1914 Forenoon visit with Shaykh ‘As’ad. At noon, Schieffer148 with me. After meal, I go with him to Kress. In front of the headquarters, Schieffer shows me some hundred boxes, which have lain there for weeks in the sun. The boxes contain dynamite! It is the cargo of the Peter Rickmer,149 which lies in Beirut harbor. Kress shows me with irritation a letter from the embassy in which he is questioned about a claim of Hilgendorff’s regarding approximately 60,000 marks in debt incurred in Jerusalem.150 He is further requested to make a refund of the 600 Turkish pounds remitted in marks. Answers: absolutely not. Kress in the evening invited out by ‘Ali Pasha,151 uncle of Algerian ruler ‘Abd al Qadir.152 Doesn’t count as completely reliable. Kress gives me full authorization to pay mufti of Haifa 300. Shaykh ‘As’ad appears in evening, drinks with me substantially large amounts of cognac, takes 100, as well as written instructions for the mufti as a receipt. At the door, he overdoes everything in comparing the value of his nephew to the mufti, who is supposed to leave on the following morning to Nablus to the soap merchants153 for the time being.\n\n6 October 1914 Visit with ‘As’ad, who butters me up in a disgusting manner. The mufti has left. The German canal expedition (Kaufmann, Frank, Wieland)154 has shown up in Petra.155 In the afternoon, the corps commander already assigned to me earlier by Mutius, Faik Pasha,156 is with me and Kress. Ready for operation against canal without the government. Reports about indiscretions in high command. Had learned about all our plans through his wife. ‘Abd ar-Rahman is a conceited fool. ‘As’ad a babbler without influence. Mu¨mtaz a soft, incompetent, ignorant Turk.\n\n26\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nFears treason in regards to our plans towards England. In evening, farewell dinner with Kress. Halid Bey and Ekrem invited.\n\n7 October 1914 Kress, Sterke and engineer Bastendorff (a Luxemburger)157 travel to Ma’an. ‘As’ad comes out to me. I tell him pretty roughly my opinion about the indiscretions at the high command. ‘As’ad departs visibly peeved. Afternoon. Letter from Mutius that ‘Abd el ‘Al and Shirkawi are on their way. Likewise Herr Kalckreuth with a letter of Oppenheim’s. Stroll with Hagen to the suburb of Midan.158 In the evening, farewell party. Lengthy edict from Liman about indiscretions with the mission officers. O. Fevzi is in Damascus gathering Kurds.\n\n8 October 1914 Early departure to Haifa with ‘As’ad, 6:30. On the way, ‘As’ad tells me that Shirkawi and ‘Abd el ‘Al had been carrying on weapons and tobacco smuggling in Beirut. They had also been helping people to illegally emigrate to America. On his advice, they had been ordered by the government to officially fight weapons smuggling in Lebanon, and at the same time, the privilege of tobacco smuggling had been given to them. During the Laamarkaziyeh movement in Beirut,159 ‘As’ad entrusted them with the assassination of the instigator of the disturbance. They had accomplished this mission satisfactorily. Unfortunately, though, they were locked up shortly thereafter by the imbecilic vali because the servant of the murdered man was suspicious. He, As’ad, had them set free afterwards and had obtained the Iftihar medal160 for them in Constantinople against Talaat’s will. Grumbled a lot about Talaat, whom he saved during the Jerusalem excavation scandal in parliament,161 not to mention Djavid, Djemal. Also, he seems to think differently about Enver than what he says. Praises Abdu¨lhamid. Arrival in Haifa, 7:30, Hotel Carmel.\n\n9 October 1914 Forenoon visit to Consul Lo¨ytved. Meet there German businessman from Haifa who was in Germany but, however, has returned from Italy via\n\n1914\n\n27\n\nEgypt. On 6 October in Alexandria, several British warships. In Port Sa’id,162 six to eight transport ships with British and Indian soldiers. Several English and French warships. No portent, for example, fidgety inspection of passports, only this in Alexandria, no inspection in Port Sa’id whatsoever. Lo¨ytved has the following plan from an engineer: mine of 40 kg of dynamite with a time fuze will be manufactured, which is being brought floating to Port Sa’id by a melon boat, and there, is supposed to be driven against British cruisers by a local German mechanic. Two more mines of 15 kg each are supposed to be anchored in the canal. News here about the bloody clash in Sudan between British and Egyptian military.163 Agence Ottomane164 reports the same from Cairo and Alexandria. Antique sale (glasses). Afternoon excursion on Carmel by car. Beautifully situated German hotel (Karmelheim).165 In the evening, with Lo¨ytved and his wife. Sharp dispute about Moritz.166 Lo¨ytved not very deep, but still meditative and fearless in judgement.\n\n10 October 1914 Forenoon with Lo¨ytved. There, a businessman, representative of Austrian Lloyd167 and smuggler. Later, engineer Frank. Excellent impression. Brother with Wieland and Kaufmann contra the Canal. Frank lays out his plan for a mining action against the Canal. One or two mines should be fixed to the keel in a melon boat, brought to the canal and anchored:168 (a) quicksilver contact; (b) floating mass; (c) electric dry battery; (d) line cable; (e) mine. Dynamite and blasting caps available here. Egyptian ‘Abd el Hamid Effendi169 receives 14 in the morning to travel to Alexandria and come back in 14 days, bringing back news, especially about Mors and the nationalists. Afternoon, walk in the city of Haifa. Around evening, with Lo¨ytved for beer. Eating at the hotel. Afterwards, conversation with Amin Taj Effendi about the Hijaz Railway. Turkish engineer, pro-German.\n\n11 October 1914 Departure 6:00 early with Lo¨ytved to Afuleh.170 From there by car to Jenin.171 Received there by members of the powerful Nablus-area family of ‘Abd el Hadi,172 and Hafiz Pasha, chief of the family; Qasim Bey,173\n\n28\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nold, worthy friend of Germany, whose son was brought up entirely German; ‘Amin Bey, deputy, incorruptible in Lo¨ytved’s opinion and pro-German. Latter at table in the hotel belonging to the family. Praises vali of Beirut. Driving farther with auto one hour via Sabastiyyeh and Sileh174 to Nablus. Arrival there 6:00. Hotel of the Hapag. German landlord, Hasselschwerdt. Director of Palestine Bank,175 Fallscher, and his wife, welcome us. News about the fall of Antwerp176 and the death of the king of Rumania.177 After the meal, Shaykh Muhammad Murad, mufti of Haifa, shows up with his brother ‘Ahmad, a clerk at the municipality of Nablus.

Consul Lo¨ytved and Shaykh ‘As’ad are going away to Damascus.\n\n23 October 1914 Forenoon visit to consulate. Then, I will call back to the hotel, where Tawfiq Effendi ‘Abd ‘Allah is expecting me. He reports: Hajj ‘Ali Kayyal, Khalil ‘Abd el ‘Al and ‘Ahmad Shirkawi as well as Abiduh Inzidar are in Damascus. Hajj ‘Ali has sent to Port Sa’id a certain Hajj Rahha, who is expected back as soon as possible. The mufti traveled yesterday to Nablus via Samarin. He still has not received a leave of absence. Through kavass212 Muhammad, I will then send for Hajj Bashir al Bana, who is declaring himself ready to travel today to Egypt via\n\n32\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nJaffa213 as a rapporteur.214 Wants to operate with us in the guise of an apothecary through the medium of a letter code.

In addition, Captain Heibei and Lieutenant Brasch,216 who is carrying with himself the two mines.\n\n25 October 1914 Hagen, Brasch and Hilgendorff travel to Jerusalem. Moritz comments pessimistically about the embassy. Wants to go to Sudan to stir up a revolt in the Sudan, doesn’t know for the time being what he actually wants. Kress would like to be rid of him. Shaykh ‘As’ad visits, with the editor of ‘Ababil,217 who is returning from Egypt and reports the following: Indians 30,000, British 6,000, then 3,000 in Alexandria.

Afternoon walk with Heibei and Lo¨ytved in bazaar. At the hotel, Kress brings the news that Enver has unofficially given an instruction to support Hilgendorff’s undertaking as much as possible. Board of works councillor Schumacher\n\n1914\n\n33\n\nshows up, to whom Kress gives the task of building cement cisterns. In the evening, I make a visit to ‘Abd ar-Rahman Pasha. There also ‘As’ad, Inzidar, ‘Abd el ‘Al, Shirkawi and Hajj ‘Ali. The four lay down a list of 19 fida’is221 sent to Egypt, and are said to have spread themselves out there to establish bands which should enter into action at the outbreak of war. Immediate action on my request rejected. Hajj ‘Ali becomes the leader. ‘As’ad insists on the exertion of our influence towards the replacement of the local vali with the vali of Beirut or of Konya. They ask as well that the police chiefs of Beirut and Damascus will be confirmed. The mining plan is passed on to Shirkawi and ‘Abd el ‘Al.\n\n26 October 1914 Forenoon visit at the bank with Schieffer. There, Dr Hoffmann and von Braun, who’s departing to Aleppo. Hoffmann: the vice consul at Tripoli. Letters from Oppenheim and Fanny. Walk in the Jewish quarter with Heibei. Around eveningtime, visit from Hajj ‘Ali and Inzidar. Present list of 22 criminals222 who are ready to take action in Egypt after being pardoned. ‘As’ad is departing in the morning. Kress fully approves an undertaking. In the evening, editor of the Muhajir,223 a slimy Algerian, visits us. In the evening, news of the advance of the Wahhabis in Medina.224 New quarreling between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Sa’ud.\n\n27 October 1914 Forenoon negotiation with Zeki Pasha and Sabih Bey regarding the command over the despatching of Hajj ‘Ali’s criminals. Little enthusiasm. Zeki lets me monitor, as he himself suggests. Sabih says that the Circassian225 Ashraf Bey226 with 30 komitajis,227 Rumelians,228 stand ready in Jaffa to travel to Egypt.229 Is being ordered here. Moritz is supposed to go with an officer and a shaykh to al Wejh,230 and from there to Jidda by ship in order to influence the Sudan. Faik visits Kress around evening time. He procures Moritz’s escort. Zeki and Sabih at table with us. Sabih declares himself to be in favor of our criminal search and to obtaining their pardon. News comes in that two transports with English or Indians had passed through the canal in the southerly direction.

Faik speaks strongly against Sharif Bey: corrupt, treasonous. With Faik, Shaykh ‘As’ad Sahib (Naqshbandi dervish), who is being sent to Cairo to the takiya233 there. Afternoon visit from Shaykh ‘Abd al Galil ad-Dera, skilful speaker. ‘Abd ar-Rahman Pasha pessimistic about ‘As’ad Sahib. Inzidar and ‘Ahmad Shirkawi show up with Hajj Muhammad Rahha, who has returned from Egypt bringing news. Unfavorable impression. Kress gets order from Enver in Constantinople in agreement with the ambassador to hand over the available money to Zeki Pasha.

Bairam.234\n\n29 October 1914 Forenoon visit with Kress to vali Nazim Faik, ‘Abd ar-Rahman, Mir ‘Ali, Sabih. Around 11:00, Sabih shows up, and Zeki. Sabih requests that he be allowed to wait a week up to his return with the affair of the criminals. He is leaving tomorrow. Ashraf Bey, though, is being instructed to place himself completely under my command. Then Wagih el ‘Ayyubi shows up and apologizes that a part of our leaftlets ¨ mer Fevzi had brought him in Damascus and Beirut are that O circulating. He has given a copy to the vali, Zeki Pasha, and to the police commander. On the other hand, Bashir al Bana has shown the sheets which he received for transport to Egypt to people, among them a suspected Young Indian, who showed them, as a certain ‘Abd ‘Allah Bey hinted at, to the British consul. Also in Beirut the sheets are said to be circulating. Kress lays before me his report to Liman, according to which the money is delivered in part, but the biggest part is being retained and Lo¨ytved and Schmidt will remit it to me. It’s leading to bitter, written complaints about the ambassador.\n\n30 October 1914 Visit with Sharif to Muhammad al Bassam,235 says war has broken out between Ibn Sa’ud and Ibn Rashid. Ibn Sa’ud paid by English. Husayn Pasha’s position in Mecca doubtful. He is robbed, though, by vali Vehib\n\n1914\n\n35\n\nBey of all power.236 Ibn Rashid’s help is not to be counted on, since he is tied up by Ibn Sa’ud. Despite Ibn Sa’ud possessing a battery of mountain guns which he seized one year ago in al Hasa,237 Ibn Rashid is the stronger. Report arrived from Egypt says that the total force of the British is not more than 11,000 men. At maximum, half stand at the canal. From Calcutta, a letter that implies that revolt has broken out. In the afternoon, another report arrives that the Russian fleet has attacked the Turkish fleet in the Black Sea.238 Russians have been hit with losses. Wagih el ‘Ayyubi arrives and informs me that he has to go to ¨ mer Fevzi is still sitting with his force, including Aleppo, where O Captain Rauf Bey.239\n\n31 October 1914 Moritz is leaving today with Halid Effendi under the name Sami Effendi to al ‘Ula.240 Visit with Kress to headquarters.

Visit from komitaji Ashraf Bey from Jaffa. Superb impression. Receives pistols, says he has 60 men at his disposal for the canal attack. Advises against Shirkawi’s band, etc. Furthermore, Egyptian Kazim Effendi shows up. Is sent by me with 25 to Egypt in order to agitate. News arrives of the bombardment245 of ‘Aqaba.\n\n2 November 1914 The Porte declares war246 on Russia and the rest of its allies. Consuls are detained as hostages. No enthusiasm at all in the city. Vali is full of anxiety. Zeki Pasha and Sabih Bey are hanging about in Beirut and\n\n36\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nBaalbek. The Algerian Tuhanir is engaged for 30 to allow his paper Muhajir to appear daily. Visit of the director Dieckmann247 and engineer Cardo and Tawfiq Bey about the Hijaz Railway. Habib Lutfallah248 is at the hotel, is chatting up Kress. Declares himself anti-British. He is a spy who’s fallen into it through stupidity, and there are mitigating circumstances.\n\n3 November 1914 Visit with Faik Pasha, who requested about 30 in personal support (!) and recommended in a suspicious manner a post office director who had been expelled. British unsuccessfully attack the Dardanelles. Second bombardment of ‘Aqaba. In the evening, three Turkish officers from the artillery with us. Staff doctor Jungels249 shows up. Damascus, 3 November 1914.250 Highly revered Herr Minister Oppenheim! With most humble thanks, I acknowledge to you the receipt of your three letters of 1, 2 and 31 October, together with enclosures and the sending of weapons delivered to me by Herr von Kalckreuth. At the same time as this, I had a report about my recent activities sent to Berlin. I don’t dare hand over important communications to the post office. The previous local corps commander Faik Pasha, who is traveling to Constantinople, is seeing to this correspondence. Should my detailed report not make it to you because the ambassador does not consider its dissemination advisable for security reasons, I may assure you just that much that I was enthusiastically active in the spirit of what was discussed in Berlin. In every country that I have visited, I have established connections that extend far over the borders of those countries. With Bassam, things stand well. He is rendering us good services. Ibn Rashid is our friend, Ibn Sa’ud the opposite. Also, Sharif Husayn is English through and through, but luckily powerless and in our hand. An encroachment of Ibn Sa’ud’s on Medina is unlikely. All the same, Ibn Rashid is so thoroughly preoccupied with him that he is no longer worth considering for our expedition. Sayyid al ‘Idrisi251 is likewise English. Submissiveness has been displayed only in Constantinople in order to deceive.\n\n1914\n\n37\n\nSome brotherhoods have been won over for us, and have sent people (Naqshbandi in particular). The ‘Abd al Qadirs are likewise won over, although I do not trust them completely, particularly Mir ‘Ali. The most suitable is probably Mir Sa’id. The Muhajir we allow to appear daily from today onwards. The publisher, Shaykh Tuhanir, is with me daily. The Indians are supposed to have left Beirut. Of the Afghan expedition, you also don’t hear anything very good here. Four of the men (Maschmeyer, Freist, Tzschirner and von Braun) are now busy in the VIII Corps sector as the head people. Whatever else is otherwise left of the expedition is lingering in Aleppo. Seems to me that the key to all mischief is the lack of subordination and an appropriate leader. The ‘Isma’ilis here have no good reputation. They are as good as English and have little sympathies for the Orthodox. If I report seldom and inconsistently, it is not due to lack of good intentions. I dare entrust no important intelligence to the local post office because I have serious grounds for mistrust. I have not yet received pay up to now. My further invoice I will hand over to General Consul Schmidt in Jerusalem, because I would not like to give it over to the post office. In conclusion, I would like to most humbly request the permission from the Foreign Office to be allowed to accompany the expedition of the VIII Army Corps.252 The chief of staff, Baron von Kress, is thoroughly agreed to it. I am permitted to request the favor of a decision by telegraph. With repeated thanks and the sincerest greetings, I am, most revered minister, Your most humble Dr Pru¨fer\n\n4 November 1914 Faik gets 30 from me. I ask him to intervene with Humann for the purpose of obtaining dismissal of Sabih Bey, whom Kress considers to be working for England. He promises me this. Letter arrives from Bashir al Bana in Port Sa’id. Vague. Jungels, dreadful Swiss man, persuades Kress to ask for two lieutenants, Captain von Fischer253 and a Herr Schwindt, who have stayed behind from the Afghan Expedition in Aleppo. I don’t think much at all of the Afgh. people at all, especially Tzschirner.254\n\n38\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\n¨ mer Fevzi, Rauf Bey and Wassmuss All are vain, greedy and chatty. O departed from Aleppo. Wassmuss’ relationship with the members of the expedition is totally ruined. Braun is summoned back to Constantinople. Frank arrives here from Sinai. Confirmed evacuation of ‘Arish and an-Nakhl.255 Will go back for reconnaissance.\n\n5 November 1914 Bassam comments very snidely about vali, Zeki, and those he consorts with. States camels could be mass-recquisitioned. Third attempted English landing at ‘Aqaba failed. In the evening with Jungels, Heibei, Sterke and Tzschirner. Walk in the city.\n\n6 November 1914 Negib ‘Abd ‘Allah comes to me with letter from Shaykh ‘As’ad. He asks for weapons for the ‘Akka people. Receives three pistols. Lo¨ytved communicates by letter that 20 transports with Australians and Indians had passed Port Sa’id. Habbal256 has received allowance for ‘Ababil, is employed by me with a 50 monthly subsidy. Letter about it to Lo¨ytved. Austrian general consul Ranzi visits me. Points out the rabble-rousing in Tripoli of Mir Sa’id. Suggests sending Algerian prisoners257 to Algeria with orders to rabble-rouse. Around eveningtime, visit from Shaykh al ‘Ayyubi. There, both his sons and Shukri Pasha.258 Holy war has been declared. Wagih al ‘Ayyubi tells me that a house search has taken place in the English and French consulates.259 In the latter were found the papers which were compromising for Mir ‘Ali. After protest of the American consul, one room, however, was outrageously left unopened. After dinner, visit from ‘Abd ar-Rahman Pasha, who tomorrow is traveling to Ma’an to lead the Beni Sakhr, Beni ‘Atiye and Howaytat260 against ‘Aqaba. Also, Cardo, Muchtar Bey261 from the Hijaz Railway (suspicious!) and Amin Taj turned up. Dieckmann has returned from Beirut. Later, two Indians, brothers, show up, who earlier in Beirut had led a training group: ‘Abd as-Sattar and ‘Abd al Jabbar al Khairy.262 The people are directed by the embassy to Hijaz in order to influence Indians and Egyptians from that location outward. Intelligent impression. Through the dragoman Gargur, they say that they have pointed out to von Mutius an Indian Anglophile living in Beirut who\n\n1914\n\n39\n\nhas reported their suspicious presence and relations with the consulate to the English consul Cumberbatch.263 They’re departing early tomorrow for Medina.\n\n7 November 1914 Forenoon visit with Bassam, with whom I arrange a rendezvous in the evening. Zeki and Sabih returned yesterday evening. In a message from the English consul in Haifa to the consul in Jerusalem, it emerges that this one was informed of Lo¨ytved’s and my trip to Nablus. At the same time, a list of anglophile Muslims from Nablus is given. In the evening, Bassam shows up. He declares himself ready for the procurement of camels. Expresses concerns because of English machinations around Basra through Talib Bey.264\n\n8 November 1914 Kress is notifying us at the request of Zeki and Djemal, who could not find the guts to let the British and French consuls depart. At the same time, they are being informed that a bombardment of the coastal cities would lead to Turkish reprisals against the British and French subjects in Syria. In the hotel are six Russian consuls.\n\n9 November 1914 Agitation among the Christians about the disclosure regarding the consuls. El Mufid (editor ‘Abd el Ghani)265 opened in Damascus. In the evening, Lo¨ytved arrives. Frank II will come back from Aleppo on 11/12 to proceed on his reconnaissance with Wagner started by Hilgendorff’s people.

Dr Hoffmann from Haifa is assigned as major to the corps. In the evening, visit from Hajj ‘Ali, ‘Abd el ‘Al\n\n40\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nand Shirkawi. Greatly cooled off. Considers operation in boats hardly feasible. Frank I shows up. Mine finally ready.\n\n11 November 1914 Afternoon, camel merchant Na’if, minion of Sabih’s, intrigues against Bassam. At the general headquarters, behaved in the most insolent manner in my presence towards Kress, whom he accused of corruption. Kicked out. Lo¨ytved is visiting the spiritual leaders in order to calm them down concerning the rumors about massacres of Christians.\n\n12 November 1914 Ashraf is instructed by Frank about the mine. Received from Kress 30 hecins267 and 100 men. ‘Abd al Hamid al Yusuf is returning from Egypt with important intelligence, is immediately engaged for his trip to Port Sa’id. Mors268 in penitentiary.

Holy war finally declared.270 The dragomans of the enemy states are exiled to Caesarea.271\n\n14 November 1914 Visit to the Italian consul and then with Kress, who during a maneuver met with an accident and broke loose two teeth. Bassam tells me that Sabih, who by the way is also balking at a peaceful disarming of Lebanon, does not wish a proceeding against Na’if because of the slandering of Kress. Evening, at table: Sharif Bey. Wagih tells me that the private property of the Russian consul is sold because he owes the government 3,000. Muhammad Kurd ‘Ali272 has conversation with me.

In Damascus are three, Kastriner, Simon,\n\n1914\n\n43\n\nWienecke, who want to blow up the petroleum tanks of Ra’s Gemsa.291 Arrival of Schwindt and correspondent Susermann from the Der Lokale Anzeiger.292\n\n25 November 1914 Zeki Pasha said to be going to the main headquarters in Germany. In his place, Goltz293 would come to Constantinople. Tzschirner also requests to intervene for him with Kress, with the result that he is being taken along as Zeki’s adjutant. Kress is very upset about the sending of the new army high command, and especially about the sending of Colonel von Frankenberg294 as chief of staff. In the evening, two Sanussi295 shaykhs visit me. They are supposed to travel home via El Milh in order to speed the Sanussi expedition’s departure out of Sallum. Hopefully, the operation won’t bring in Italy on the side of our opponents. Damascus, 26 November 1914.296 To His Excellency Djemal Pasha, Commander of the 4th Army, Damascus. According to the news received up to 25 November, the British strength on the Suez Canal line is said to consist of the following: the center of the defense is said to be the line between Qantara,297 ‘Isma’iliyeh298 and the Great Basin of the Bitter Lakes.299 The number of troops concentrated in this position is estimated at approximately 12,000 men, British and Indians. There are supposedly two lines of defense, the first of which is to the east, and the second to the west of the canal. The eastern line consists of trenches of riflemen, which run to a distance of a few kilometers from the canal, and armed, according to one communication, with twelve 6-cm guns. The entire line has a length of 30 kilometers. In front of this position, many mines have been placed whose locations have been visibly marked by piles of stones and small red, black and blue flags. After one other communication, which is until now unconfirmed, three fortifications, each armed with two pieces of heavy artillery (15-cm), occur at an unknown distance to the east in front of the canal. An important English encampment is located to the east of Qantara. The principal position of the enemy is to the west of the canal. A small fort, whose artillery is unknown, is built on the heights of the Gabal\n\n44\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\nMaryam300 near the station of Shaykh Hanaydak. The interval between this fort and the Great Basin of the Bitter Lakes on one side and the station of al Qantara on the other side, is fortified by trenches and palisades made of wood filled with sand. Most of the 18 pieces of field artillery which are at the disposal of the English on the canal would be put into position in this space. Lake Timsa301 is protected by a small warship stationed there. The force at Suez and its vicinity is composed of nearly 5,000 men, English and Indians, among which there is a considerable number of Egyptians, and a force of 1,000 camel riders of the coastal guards. To the west of Suez, there is a small fort on the heights of the hills located there. Also here, in front of the canal to the east, a line of trenches and mines are fixed. On the 14th of this month, three cruisers and two destroyers were anchored in the port of Suez. One telegraph station is situated north of the city. On the subject of the garrison of Port Sa’id, the information is contradictory. Whereas some claim that Port Sa’id is practically unprotected, the others affirm that a force of 5,000 men is camped near the city. This great divergence is perhaps explained by the fact that in order to hide their actual force, the English are probably carrying out numerous relocations of their troops. On the 18th of this month, two English cruisers, two French cruisers and four destroyers appeared in the port. In front of the various stations, situated at a distance of ten kilometers from each other and guarded by small detachments of Indian troops, some observation towers built of iron have been erected. Two French biplanes, the locations of the hangars of which are not known, and several armored trains are moving about the length of the canal. These trains, which are painted the color of sand, are composed of two cars, armed with two marine cannons of small caliber and two machine guns. Each train contains 100 men. The engine is situated between the two cars. The depots and the magazines of the army are in the rear of ‘Isma’iliyeh to the north-west. A mine depot is located to the north of Qantara. The garrison of Cairo is composed of two English brigades – one yeomanry brigade and two regiments of reserve 6th Lancashire Fusiliers and 9th Manchester – in all, eight battalions of infantry, two regiments of cavalry and two groups of artillery, each group in three batteries with four pieces. Each battalion, whose effectives are between 400 and 800 men, has\n\n1914\n\n45\n\nonly one single machine gun. Otherwise, two engineering companies and three medical companies are at the disposal of the command. In the shelters at ‘Abbasiyeh,302 one considerable Egyptian force, completely weaponless, is concentrated without the oversight of English troops. Eight cannons of average caliber are placed in the citadel, which is guarded by 2,000 English and 500 Egyptians. One wireless telegraph station has been constructed near ‘Abu Zabal303 in the desert north-east of Cairo. The garrison of Alexandria consists of eight battalions of infantry, very little cavalry and three companies of fortress artillery which would serve the guns in the forts of Kum an-Nadoma, Kum ad-Dikkeh, and in the field fortifications built near the wireless telegraph station at ‘Abathy–Ramla. The cities of Damietta304 and el ‘Aboukir305 are equally protected by some small English detachments. Near ‘Abu ‘Akhdar306 to the east of Zagazig307 is a small, Egyptian force of about 500 armed men without the command of English officers. All the bridges and gangways are guarded by platoons of six English soldiers. Numerous patrols move about along the railway. On the second day of Bairam, a large number of transports having on board 25,000 Indian soldiers left the port of Suez. These ships were conveyed to Kassen in order to remain there, probably for the purpose of making an attack on ‘Aqaba–Ma’an after the departure of Ottoman troops for the canal. The sentiments of the Egyptians, with the exception of the Copts,308 are clearly anglophobic. Nevertheless, there is quite little probability that disorders will burst out, until the Egyptians see the fortune of arms turn to the Ottoman side. The Egyptians do only possess a small number of rifles in Upper Egypt.309 The nationalist party has ceased to exist. The English govern by terror. More than 400 persons are incarcerated in the citadel of Cairo.310 The shaykh of the mosque of el ‘Azhar and several notables of the provinces have been brought to the capital as hostages. Pru¨fer\n\n26 November 1914 Forenoon. To General Headquarters. Kress wants to send 600 Mausers to Egypt. I suggest route over the Red Sea.

In the evening, Kress asks me to undertake something in order to avert the Frankenberg threat. I will travel to Beirut and talk with Mutius. Zeki, who is now living in the hotel, and Sabih, who is eating here, promise me the setting free of three prisoners whom the smugglers need. Later, champagne spree in the “dining hall”.\n\n27 November 1914 Kress informs me that 500 Mausers are ready for transport to Egypt. I am sitting with311. . .Futile visit with the vali. Tzschirner is ordered to ‘Aqaba. In the evening, I go in torrential rain to pastor Hanauer in order to hire Sprotte, the teacher who lives there, as paymaster for the weapons expedition. Sprotte will be sent for on the following morning.\n\n28 November 1914 In the night, I fall sick with acute diarrhea and fever. In the morning, Sprotte appears and takes my suggestion. I get up despite being really sick and go to the visibly reluctant vali, from whom I wring the release of the three prisoners. In the course of the day, numerous visits. I am not well.\n\n29 November 1914 Still fever. Towards evening, slight improvement. Kress tells me that the 10th Division has been withdrawn from Smyrna at his order and has been left behind in Alexandretta.\n\n30 November 1914 Forenoon visits with Schieffer and Wagner, for whom it’s going somewhat better. In the afternoon, Heibei and Tzschirner argue. Kress forces them to reconcile. Frank shows up.

I am with all Germans at the train.\n\n7 December 1914 The previous terms are agreed to. Kress visibly pleased. I almost regret having sent a telegraph through Mutius.\n\n48\n\nGERMANY 'S COVERT WAR\n\n8 December 1914 Visit with Djemal315 and Frankenberg. Both are peasant-crafty and conceited. Frankenberg will still provoke much umbrage with his Prussian Junker manner. Djemal treats the valis miserably. At the evening, cinema. Lame pictures, little entrain.316 Djemal and tutti quanti.317 Also, the vali summoned here from Beirut. Damascus, 8 December 1914.318 His Excellency, General Djemal Pasha,319 commander of the VIII Army Corps, Damascus. Espionage in Egypt. Two sources of information are at our disposal: paid professional spies who, with formal instructions, are making the voyage to Egypt under different pretenses and disguises, where they slip into the confidence of civil and military officials, from whom they bring back news. At the same time, they must answer back amongst the inhabitants of Egypt with good tidings from us and give them instructions concerning the insurrection against the English. The communications in writing that these spies are making to reach us from Egypt are composed of words and phrases arranged beforehand whose secret meaning varies on each occasion and with every individual. They are addressed to third parties who serve as intermediaries without being acquainted with the key to the codes employed. Our principal spies are the following: (1) Hajj Bashir al Bana from Beirut, presently en route for Cyprus. (2) ‘Abd al Hamid Yusuf, mechanic in service with the Hijaz Railway, located at present in Egypt. Minieh, trusted man to whom arms consignments or propaganda papers can be addressed. (3) Kazim Effendi, Egyptian, domiciled in Haifa, located at present in Egypt. (4) Rothschild, American Jew from Jaffa, attached at present to Captain Tzschirner in Aqaba. (5) Hajj Rahha from Beyrout, sent through smugglers Hajj Khalil ‘Abd al ‘Al, Hajj ‘Ali Kayyal, ‘Ahmad Shirkawi and Abiduh Inzidar, all four from Beirut. (6) Muhammad Murad, mufti of Haifa, who, on his side, employs a certain al Geridli from ‘Akka.\n\n1914\n\n49\n\nAt present, seeing that there are no more watermen on the Syrian coast ready to travel to Egypt, the only means of communication is the packet boat. Besides the professional spies, several private persons, moved by patriotism or because the occasion was suitable, provided reports on subjects of the military preparations of the English. In this category especially was the camel trader Muhammad al Bassam from Damascus, who, by the bedouins he sent, repeatedly furnished us information from the Suez Canal zone. Among the volunteers who are aiding us in gathering intelligence, I also mention al Habbal, editor of the journal ‘Ababil, who before this was living in Egypt. We are entering also into relations with the soap manufacturers of Nablus, for example, ‘Abd al Fattah Touqan, whose trade with Egypt makes them able to get news from the country. As for the results of the espionage, I refer to my different reports that I had the honor to submit to Your Excellency. Pru¨fer\n\n9 December 1914 Tzschirner departs. Parade. In the evening with Kress and Lo¨ytved to Schief"
