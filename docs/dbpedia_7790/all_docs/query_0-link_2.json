While being an Ottoman unit, it also contained the German Asia Corps.\n\nStarting in June 1917, the Yildirim Army Group's first commander in chief was the former Prussian Minister of War and Chief of Staff Erich von Falkenhayn. Von Falkenhayn was replaced by General of the Cavalry Otto Liman von Sanders on 25 February 1918. After the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918, Mustafa Kemal took command until the Group's dissolution a few days later.\n\nEstablishment\n\n[edit]\n\nUpon the death of Goltz Pasha just prior to Ottoman victory at Siege of Kut in the Mesopotamia front in Iraq, German military mission representative in Constantinople General von Lossow on April 22, 1916 had asked Berlin by telegraph to have (then) chief of German general staff General Erich von Falkenhayn be appointed to the head of 6. Ottoman Army to protect the high interests of Germany in Iran and Mesopotamia.[6] He had also suggested that Liman von Sanders, who was responsible for the Dardanelle front, could now be moved to Levant also. Ottoman Minister of War, Enver Pasha was initially against the involvement of German allies in Baghdad. After the success of Halil Pasha at Siege of Kut, he did not want him to feel slighted. The Ottoman army meanwhile had failed to capitalize on the success at Kut and the British had made extensive preparations for another general assault. The British then attacked strongly, and Halil Pasha could not hold on to the defensive positions and Ottomans had to evacuate Baghdad on March 10/11, 1917.[7]\n\nImmediately plans were started to take this ancient and important city back. Only once it was realized that retaking of Baghdad would not be possible without German help, Enver Pasha relented and the new organization was allowed to proceed[8]\n\nOrganization of the Yildirim Army group started on May 7, 1917, with the arrival General Falkenhayn to Constantinople. His official commission was approved on July 11, 1917 by Sultan, and order for the establishment of the army group was published on July 15.\n\nLiman von Sanders makes a vague reference to the Napoleon's French campaign in Egypt and Syria for the choice of the name.[9] Naming was also chosen to obfuscate the intended mission and theater of operation for this army group. Germans called it F(Falke) Army Group. This army group was composed of Ottoman 6. and 7. Armies, with German Asia Corps attached to 7. Army.\n\nThe order for the creation of the army group specifically read as follows:[10]\n\nAn army group named Yildirim to be established. For the time being headquarters will be in Constantinople\n\nYildirim Army Group will be commanded by Field Marshal (Mushir, his rank was raised) Falkenhayn and his chief of staff is Colonel Dommes\n\n6. and 7. Armies will be assigned to the new group\n\n13. and 18. Corps will join 6th Army, and 3. and 15. Corps will join the 7., which will be assigned German Asia Corps also. Pasha II headquarters will have a German infantry battalion with three companies, three German machine gun companies, and all technical support personnel needed.\n\n6. and 7. Armies will immediately complete their preparations and assemble under the new army group.\n\nIts organization was to be very different that other German units and personnel assisting the Ottoman war effort. Its staff was organized like that of a German army group, with a German general on top. Yıldırım Army received separate German funds to help with equipment and needs of the personnel.[11] The army group included troops who used the latest Western-Front infiltration tactics; were equipped with close-combat gear, such as Stahlhelms and stick-grenades; and were supported by artillery and machine guns.[12][13]\n\nMission\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginal mission of Yildirim Army Group was to move South along Euphrates and surround the British. There was a plan for a small naval force on the river also.[14][15] Meanwhile British had conquered Akabe and had launched an intense propaganda campaign among Arab populations behind the fronts. Falkenhayn immediately realized the danger and told Enver Pasha that it would not be wise to move to Baghdad without securing the Sinai front first. 4. Army commander Cemal Pasha, concerned about intense British propaganda, also favored bolstering the Sinai-Palestine area.[16] There were intense discussions among the military leaders, Enver Pasha, Mushir Falkenhayn, Cemal Pasha, von Kres Pasha, Liman von Sanders and Berlin as the mission goals were changed. Eventually in September, Falkenhayn succeeded in directing the Yildirim Army Group towards Sinai and Palestine.\n\nCemal Pasha was favoring a defensive operation, von Kress thought a limited offensive operation would be most appropriate, and Falkenhayn was for a broad attack.[17] Ottoman Army Headquarters tried to solve this difference of opinion on the strategy by assigning 8. Army to von Kress and made responsible for the Sinai front. Cemal Pasha was given the responsibility for Syria and Western Arabia as the commander of the 4. Army, and Jerusalem and Palestine region would be the responsibility of Falkenhayn, who was given full command of 6., 7. and 8. Armies.[18] Army group was also assigned four aviation companies.[19]\n\nActive Engagements\n\n[edit]\n\nWorld War I\n\n[edit]\n\nOrder of Battle, August 1917\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 1917, the army group was structured as follows:[20]\n\nYildirim Army Group (Müşir Erich von Falkenhayn)\n\nSeventh Army, Syria (Mirliva Mustafa Kemal Atatürk)\n\nIII Corps\n\n24th Division\n\n50th Division\n\nXV Corps\n\n19th Division\n\n20th Division\n\nGerman Asia Corps\n\nSixth Army, Mesopotamia (Mirliva Halil Kut)\n\nXIII Corps\n\n2nd Division\n\n6th Division\n\nXVIII Corps\n\n14th Division\n\n51st Division\n\n52nd Division\n\n46th Division\n\nwith the\n\n42nd Division\n\n48th Division\n\n59th Division[21]\n\nXX Corps at Huj\n\n16th Division\n\n54th Division\n\n178th Infantry Regiment\n\n3rd Cavalry Division\n\nXXII Corps at Gaza\n\n3rd Division\n\n7th Division\n\n53rd Division[22][23]\n\nOrder of Battle, January 1918\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 1918, the army group was structured as follows:[24]\n\nYildirim Army Group (Müşir Erich von Falkenhayn)\n\nSeventh Army (Mirliva Fevzi Çakmak)\n\nIII Corps\n\n1st Division, 19th Division, 24th Division\n\nXV Corps\n\n26th Division, 53rd Division\n\n3rd Cavalry Division\n\nGerman Asia Corps\n\nEighth Army (Ferik Cevat Çobanlı)\n\nXXII Corps\n\n3rd Division, 7th Division, 20th Division\n\n16th Division, 54th Division, 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division\n\nOrder of Battle, June 1918\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 1918, the army group was structured as follows:[25]\n\nYildirim Army Group (Müşir Otto Liman von Sanders)\n\nSeventh Army (Mirliva Fevzi Çakmak)\n\nIII Corps\n\n1st Division, 24th Division, 3rd Cavalry Division\n\nXV Corps\n\n26th Division, 53rd Division, 19th Division\n\nGerman Asia Corps\n\nEighth Army (Ferik Cevat Çobanlı)\n\nXXII Corps\n\n3rd Division, 7th Division, 20th Division\n\n16th Division\n\n54th Division\n\n2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division\n\nOrder of Battle, September 1918\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 1918, the army group was structured as follows:[26]\n\nYildirim Army Group (Müşir Otto Liman von Sanders)\n\nFourth Army (Mirliva Cemal Mersinli)\n\nII Corps (Miralay Galatalı Şevket Bey)\n\n62nd Division, Provisional Division x 3\n\nJordan Group\n\n24th Division, 3rd Cavalry Division\n\nVIII Corps (Miralay Yasin Hilmi Bey)\n\n48th Division, Umman Provisional Division\n\nSeventh Army (Mirliva Mustafa Kemal Atatürk)\n\nIII Corps (Miralay İsmet İnönü)\n\n1st Division, 11th Division\n\nXV Corps (Miralay Ali Fuat Cebesoy)\n\n26th Division, 53rd Division\n\nEighth Army (Ferik Cevat Çobanlı)\n\nXXII Corps (Miralay Refet Bele)\n\n7th Division, 20th Division\n\nLeft Wing Corps (Oberst Gustav von Oppen)\n\n16th Division, 19th Division\n\nGerman Asia Corps\n\n2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division\n\nAfter Mudros\n\n[edit]\n\nOrder of Battle, November 1918\n\n[edit]\n\nIn November 1918, the army group was structured as follows:[27]\n\nYildirim Army Group (Mirliva Mustafa Kemal Atatürk)\n\nSecond Army (Mirliva Nihat Anılmış)\n\nXII Corps\n\n23rd Division\n\nXV Corps\n\n41st Division, 44th Division\n\nSeventh Army (Mirliva Ali Fuat Cebesoy, deputy)\n\nIII Corps\n\n11th Division, 24th Division\n\nXX Corps\n\n1st Division, 43rd Division\n\nYildirim Troops Inspectorate, May 1919\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 1919, Şevket Turgut Pasha, Cevat Çobanlı and Fevzi Çakmak hold a secret meeting in Constantinople. They prepared a report called \"Trio Oath\" (Üçler Misâkı) and decided to establish army inspectorate for the defense of homeland. In late April, Fevzi Çakmak submitted this report to the Minister of War Şakir Pasha. On April 30, 1919, the War Ministry and Sultan Mehmed VI ratified the decision about the establishing of army inspectorates that had been accepted by the Chief of General Staff[28] And then the First Army Troops Inspectorate (stationed in Constantinople, Fevzi Çakmak), the Yildirim Troops Inspectorate (stationed in Konya, Cemal Mersinli, later Second Army Inspectorate) Inspectorate, the Ninth Army Troops Inspectorate (stationed in Erzurum, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, later Third Army Inspectorate) was formed. Additionally, the Rumeli Military Troops Inspectorate (Nureddin Pasha) would be established and the XIII Corps would be under the direction of the Ministry of War.[29] In May 1919, the army inspectorate was structured as follows:[30][31]\n\nYildirim Troops Inspectorate (Yıldırım Kıt'aatı Müfettişliği, Konya, Inspector: Ferik Cemal Mersinli)\n\nXII Corps (Niğde, Miralay Selâhaddin Bey)\n\n11th Division\n\n41st Division\n\n7th Cavalry Regiment\n\n20th Cavalry Regiment\n\nXX Corps (Ankara, Mirliva Ali Fuat Cebesoy)\n\n23rd Division\n\n24th Division\n\nXVII Corps (Smyrna, Mirliva Ali Nadir Pasha, transferred from the First Army Troops Inspectorate after the Occupation of Smyrna)\n\n56th Division\n\n57th Division"
