        "text": "University in Guwahati, Assam, India\n\nGauhati University also known as GU, is a collegiate public state university located in Guwahati, Assam, India. It was established on 26 January 1948 under the provisions of an Act enacted by the Assam Legislative Assembly and is the oldest university in Northeast India.\n\nIt is accredited grade \"A+\" by National Assessment and Accreditation Council.[3] Starting with 18 affiliated colleges and 8 Post Graduate Departments in 1948, Gauhati University, today, has 39 Post Graduate Departments, besides IDOL (Institute of Distance and Open Learning), a constituent Law and Engineering College. It has 341 affiliated colleges offering undergraduate and post graduate courses in the faculties of Arts, Science, Commerce, Law, Medicine, Engineering and Technology. Gauhati University is a member of the Association of Indian Universities and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nVice-Chancellors\n\n[edit]\n\nKrishna Kanta Handique 1947 – 1957\n\nSurya Kumar Bhuyan 1957 – 1960\n\nH.

In 1940, the Government appointed S. K. Bhuyan as Special Officer with the task of collecting relevant information on the selection of site and related matters.[5] The university was established by an act of the State Legislature: the Gauhati University Act 1947 (Assam Act, XVI of 1947) of the government of Assam in 1948. The first court meeting of the university was held on 26 January 1948, which is considered the foundation day, at the old Sudmerson Hall of Cotton College, Guwahati.[6]\n\nGauhati University started functioning as an affiliating, teaching and residential university in a few temporary buildings in Guwahati, with K.K Handique as the first vice-chancellor, Phanidhar Dutta, Sailandhar Rajkhowa and Sarat Kumar Dutta were selected as the registrar, treasurer and secretary of university classes, respectively. The emblem of the university, selected from among many submitted, was designed by Tripureswar Mukhopadhyay, a textile designer of Ahmedabad. Two Sanskrit words inscribed on it – Vidyaya Sadhayeta (meaning achievement through learning) – indicate the motto of the university.[4] It had 17 affiliated colleges and eight Post Graduate Departments on its establishment.[5] The university which started functioning from the city center was shifted to the present campus in 1955–56.\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe university is in Jalukbari in the Guwahati city area. The campus has a hillock on the southern side and the Brahmaputra river flows on the northern side. The campus area has been developed into a small township, now known as 'Gopinath Bardoloi Nagar'. It has about 6000 population including 3700 students residing in the hostels.\n\nApart from the residential quarters of teachers, officers and employees, there are 22 halls of residence for students. The necessary civic amenities such as health service, water supply, street lighting, internal roads, guest house, post and telegraph office, a branch of the State Bank of India, United Bank Of India, canteens, a market, parks, playgrounds, auditorium, indoor stadium, etc. are on campus.\n\nThe university is 10 km from the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport on National Highway No. 37; 5 km from Kamakhya Railway Station; and 10 km from Guwahati Railway Station as well as from the bus stop near the Cachari (D.C. court) at the heart of Guwahati City. The capital complex of Assam at Dispur is 22 km from the university. The university is easily accessible from the Guwahati city; Guwahati has road, rail and air links from all parts of the country. A large number of bus services from parts of Assam have their station at Adabari bus stand which is 2 km from the campus.\n\nTo automate their internal processes, Gauhati University has chosen Kalingasoft's flagship Education ERP solution, Greycells. This implementation has resulted in the complete automation of the university's academic, administrative and financial processes.\n\nLibrary and regional center\n\n[edit]\n\nThe North Eastern Regional Centre (NERC) of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) is in the Gauhati University Central Library Extension Building. Along with Bangalore ICHR Regional Centre, this is the only regional centre in GU so far.\n\nThe university's Krishna Kanta Handique Library is a designated 'Manuscript Conservation Centre' (MCC) under the National Mission for Manuscripts established in 2003.[7]\n\nThe library is the largest in Assam, holding about 850,000 books, magazines, and journals in its collection. It also hosts about 5,000 valuable priceless manuscripts, some more than 300 years old.[8]\n\nOrganisation and administration\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernance\n\n[edit]\n\nThe G.U. Court, the Executive Council and the Academic Council are the authorities of the university.[9]\n\nIn 2019, Professor Pratap Jyoti Handique was appointed as the Vice-Chancellor of the university.[10]\n\nFaculties\n\n[edit]\n\nAcademic faculties\n\n[edit]\n\nThe institution is divided into following academic units:[11]\n\nPost Graduate Students' Union\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Post Graduate Students' Union is the apex student representative body of Gauhati University. The first body of PGSU was formed in the year 1949. The first General Secretary was Biren Goswami. Gauhati University being the epicenter of student politics, the PGSU gets high recognition in the state. There are many General Secretaries as well as other office bearers of PGSU who have been involved in the active politics. The present General Secretary of PGSU is Parshwa Patgiri.[13]\n\nColleges\n\n[edit]\n\nIts jurisdiction extends over 15 districts - Bajali district, Barpeta, Biswanath, Bongaigaon, Darrang, Dhubri, Goalpara, Hojai, Kamrup Metropolitan, Kamrup district, Morigaon, Nagaon, Nalbari, Sonitpur, South Salmara district.\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nRankings\n\n[edit]\n\nInternationally, the QS World University Rankings ranked Gauhati University in the 601–650 band in Asia in 2023.[14]\n\nIn India, the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranked Gauhati University 64 overall in 2022[17] and 36 among universities.[18]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nBhaktisvarupa Damodar Swami, Spiritual leader\n\nDarwin Diengdoh Pugh, 2nd Chief Minister of Meghalaya\n\nMoirangthem Kirti Singh, Indian writer, Padma Shri (1992)\n\nSyed Abdul Malik, Indian writer, Padma Shri (1984), Padma Bhushan (1992)\n\nLal Thanhawla, 3rd and the longest serving Chief Minister of Mizoram\n\nPrashant Goswami, Indian scientist, Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Laureate (2001)\n\nAmbika Charan Choudhury, litterateur\n\nPranab Kumar Gogoi, politician\n\nBinoy Kumar Saikia, Indian scientist, Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Laureate (2021)\n\nJitendra Nath Goswami, Indian scientist, chief scientist of Chandrayaan-1, Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Laureate (1994), Padma Shri (2017)\n\nBhabananda Deka, economist\n\nZubeen Garg, Singer, Composer, Filmmaker, Director and Actor.\n\nPurnima Devi Barman, Wildlife Biologist, Nari Shakti Puraskar (2017), Whitley Awards (2017)\n\nKashmiri Saikia Baruah, Actress and Singer.\n\nMamoni Raisom Goswami, novelist, Sahitya Akademi Award (1983), Jnanpith Award (2001), Principal Prince Claus Laureate (2008)\n\nDipak C.
