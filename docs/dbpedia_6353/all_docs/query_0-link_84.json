        "text": "Mississippi State University, public, coeducational institution of higher learning near Starkville, Mississippi, U.S. It is a land-grant university that is made up of eight colleges and schools. There is also a branch at Meridian. Undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees are awarded in such fields as accounting, agriculture, architecture, arts and sciences, business and industry, education, engineering, forestry, and veterinary medicine. Notable among its research facilities are the Engineering Research Center at John C. Stennis Space Center, the Social Science Research Center, the Cobb Institute of Archaeology, and the Water Resources Research Institute. Mississippi State also operates statewide branches of the Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station and of the Cooperative Extension Service. Total student enrollment is approximately 20,000.\n\nUnder the aegis of the Morrill Act of 1862, Mississippi State University was established in 1878 as a land-grant college, the Agricultural and Mechanical College of the State of Mississippi. Instruction began in 1880, and the early curriculum emphasized agriculture, business and industry, and science. Women students were first enrolled in 1930. The institution was renamed Mississippi State College in 1932, and it became a university in 1958. The graduate school was founded in 1936 and doctoral degree programs began in 1951. The School of Forest Resources and the College of Arts and Sciences opened in the 1950s. In the â€™70s, the academic divisions of architecture, veterinary medicine, and accounting were added."
