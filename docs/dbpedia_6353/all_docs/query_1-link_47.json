        "text": "Cotton University in Assam, which has the distinction of giving the state seven chief ministers, has made the decision to lease out its campus land to outside parties in a bid to improve revenue generation. This move comes at a time when the prestigious university is facing financial challenges.\n\nHowever, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has firmly opposed the idea.\n\nThe Cotton College was established in 1901 by Sir Henry Stedman Cotton, Chief Commissioner of the former British province of Assam.\n\nThe decision to lease out university land was made during the 34th Executive Council Meeting held on March 8, 2024.\n\nNotably, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma is also an alumnus of Cotton College )now known as Cotton University). He was involved in the Cotton College Students Union from 1991 to 1992.\n\nGopinath Bordoloi, Assam's first chief minister and a revered leader of the state, also graduated from Cotton University. Additionally, several other former students, including Mahendra Mohan Chowdhury, Sarat Chandra Sinha, Jogendra Nath Hazarika, Hiteswar Saikia, and Bhumidhar Barman, went on to become chief ministers of the state.\n\nChief Minister Himana Biswa Sarma opposed the university’s move, saying that the state government will not allow the outsourcing of its properties.\n\n“Cotton College University carries the rich legacy of Cotton College. The Assam Government will not allow outsourcing its properties to any private individuals or organisations. The University authority must stop any such exercise immediately,\" Sarma tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, opposition leader and president of Raijor Dal, Akhil Gogoi, expressed sadness that the university had to take such steps due to the financial crisis. He said it is “bad news for the people of Assam.”\n\n\"As an Assamese, former student of Cotton, and political leader, I am deeply saddened by Cotton University's necessity to resort to such measures due to financial constraints. This news is distressing for the people of Assam. If an esteemed institution like this faces financial hardship, it reflects poorly on the state government's commitment to society and education promotion,\" Gogoi said.\n\nMeanwhile, questions are being raised over the identity of the external parties involved in leasing the university land.\n\nSwapnil Dutta, a Mass Communication student at Cotton University, raised concerns regarding the notice released by the university authorities, questioning the identity and intentions of the external parties involved in the lease and the utilisation of the land.\n\n“Who are those outsider parties the university will lease and for what the allocation of land will be used for? We are not a university as big as IIT in case of space; we will be obviously concerned about the use of space,” Dutta said.\n\nSpeaking to India Today TV, Swapnil stressed, \"We acknowledge that the university need revenue to run the institution but it should not be given to unknown outsiders. The entire message of revenue is unclear. The authorities should clearly explain our doubts on the notice.”"
