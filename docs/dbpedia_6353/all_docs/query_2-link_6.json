        "text": "Since the 1980s there has been pressure on universities of the world to align themselves to the needs and challenges of a global knowledge economy. While universities have to perform to remain at the top even as they pursue excellence and innovation, there is increasing expectation from them to also serve the fundamental mission of disseminating knowledge and remain inclusive, improve social mobility and be platforms of equality.\n\nWhen Humanities across Borders of the Mellon program extended its field of studies and projects to the South Asia Platform with its India partners playing a major role, it seemed to the northeast to open a large window of collaboration and connectivity to insitutions both young and old that had been struggling to get out of their isolatedness in what is recognised as being at the peripheries of the national imaginary and engagements. For an institution like Cotton University, ( erstwhile Cotton College under Cotton College State University, till very recently) its tradition of educational vision has never been in question with more than a century of graduate and post graduate curricular experience to back it up. Cotton College, to remind the forum here , is among the oldest institutions of higher education in India’s northeastern region, having been established in 1901 by the then Commissioner of the Province of Assam ( under the British colonial regime) Sir Henry Stedman Cotton. A teaching and research university the Cotton University in its new avatar, has plans to explore links with other national universities from across the South Asian and Southeast Asian region.\n\nStraddling an international neighborhood with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal , Myanmar , China as border nations and Thailand and the Southeast Asia in very close proximity we have sought to orient our learning and teaching to an awareness of this transregion that NE India narturally forms with this cluster of countries. Cotton University already has an Mou with Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine (SKKUSOM), South Korea since February, 2009 which facilitates –\n\nAn exchange of graduate students, post- doctoral researchers\n\nAn exchange of documentary resources\n\nSponsorship of international workshops, symposia and seminars of mutual interest\n\nCooperation in joint technical assistance activities\n\nThe HaB now mandates collaborative links among Cotton University and universities in our transregion, namely Mandalay, Chiang Mai and Yunnan in Southwest China for academic exchange and new cross disciplinary frontiers of study and curricular. Aimed at forging initiatives for sharing of knowledge domains and long lasting research partnerships, not merely to push the horizons of conventional academic boundaries but more importantly to innovate pedagogic methods of creating and disseminating knowledge in new and novel forms, this reformist objective of the IIAS led Mellon program has infused exciting dimensions and directions that disciplines of teaching and research are preparing themselves for."
