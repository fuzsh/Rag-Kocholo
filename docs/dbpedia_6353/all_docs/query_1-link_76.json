        "text": "Cotton is an important cash crop and source of livelihood for nearly 15 million farmers in 10 India States. In India, 60% of the total cropped area is classified as dry land or rain fed area representing 40% of the total agricultural production. Tamil Nadu is one of the major producers of the cotton in India along with Maharashtra (35.50 %) followed by Gujarat (16.32 %), Karnataka (9.20 %), Andhra Pradesh (8.17%), Punjab (8.51 %), Madhya Pradesh (7.21 %), Haryana (5.91 %), Rajasthan (5.45 %), Tamil Nadu (3.16 %). during 2012-2013. Cotton one of the principal crops in India and enjoys pride of place and unique position in our country. Against this background, this study is focused on growth rate of cotton. Cotton is one of the most important textile fibres in the world, accounting for 35% of the world fibre use. Cotton was first cultivated in the Old World about 7,000 years ago, by the inhabitants of the Indus Valley Civilization. This civilization covered a huge swath of the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, comprising today parts of eastern Pakistan and northwestern India.\n\nFourteen years after Bt cotton was approved in 2002 for cultivation in India while the area and production has increased, productivity has stagnated and newer pests have appeared requiring large amounts of pesticides. Yields of cotton started going up when the Bt cotton coverage was not much between 2002 to 2004 and started plateauing after the Bt cotton area crossed 90 per cent. While pesticide use on the American bollworm has reduced, other pests have surfaced and among them the mealy bug for the first time. As a result, the advantage of lesser sprays to kill mainly the American bollworm on cotton has been somewhat negated by large amounts of insecticides to tackle aphids, mirids, mealy bugs and other sap sucking pests. When Bt cotton seeds were approved for distribution in six states in India, there was much expectation from the scientific community and the government which overrode strong criticism from many quarters including scientists and farmers' groups. The fact that countries like the USA and China were growing transgenic cotton, was successfully used to staunch all criticism in the name of scientific advance. While Bt cotton almost covers the entire cotton area, India is the largest producer of organic cotton and has another advantage of desi cotton varieties. With desi Bt cotton in the offing farmers may be able to cut down costs of cultivation. However, the loss of our biodiversity is tragic and it is no longer easy to get desi cotton seeds.
