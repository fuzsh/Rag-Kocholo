The program is designed to help advance equity in healthcare by inspiring and educating college students about the wide array of impactful careers available in healthcare. “I hope this can be the beginning of a pipeline for Rhodes students to participate in this wonderful program,” said McMillian.\n\nChoral Excellence: Music Alum Jason Bishop ’98 to Conduct Celebrated Ensembles at Rhodes\n\nJason Bishop ’98 never had formal training or lessons, couldn’t read music, and had never sung in a choir when he came to Rhodes in 1994. But his life changed when Professor Tony Lee Garner encouraged him to audition for the Rhodes Singers. Fast-forward to today, Bishop is joining the Department of Music as visiting assistant professor and choral director.\n\nBest New Opera Award Recognizes Music Composed by Rhodes Alum Rene Orth ’07\n\nThe Music Critics Association of North America has announced that the opera 10 Days in a Madhouse is the winner of the 2024 Award for Best New Opera. Music alumna Rene Orth ’07 composed the music for 10 Days, which was commissioned by Opera Philadelphia and Tapestry Opera and had its world premiere in 2023.\n\nRhodes has consistently been nationally ranked as a top liberal arts college, most recently by Forbes and The Princeton Review.\n\nBegin your application today to join our inspired community of dreamers and thinkers.\n\nOnce you’re here, you’ll know—there’s simply no college experience that is quite like Rhodes.
