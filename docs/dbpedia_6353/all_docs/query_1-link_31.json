        "text": "Name after Sir Henry Stedman Cotton, as the \"Cotton College\", in appreciation of his genuine concern for the cause of higher education in the province. The college was started with five professors, which included Frederick William Sudmerson, the first principal of the college, and 39 students.\n\nFrom a small undergraduate college, Cotton College has now become a postgraduate institution, integrated with undergraduate education having enrolled 5000 students and 244 teachers, among 21 undergraduate and 20 post graduate departments in science, humanities and social science faculties. On October 16, 1992, the college was declared as a postgraduate institution, an occasion celebrated in a solemn ceremony with Shankar Dayal Sharma, the then-President of India.\n\nThe first admission to the college took place on 17th June, 1901 with 37 students in the first year F.A. class and 2 students in the second year of the same course. The faculty was consisted of only five members including Prof Frederick William Südmersen (1871 – 1953), the first Principal of the college from 1901 to 1926. The other four faculty members were Prof. Chunilal De, Prof. Indu Bhusan Brahmachary, Prof. Paresh Nath Lahiri and Prof. Maulvi Abu Nasr Muhammad Oheed. Classes during the initial years of the establishment of the college were held in the building which presently houses Chemistry Department of the college. However, no girl student was admitted to the course. It was only in 1929 that two girl students were admitted to the first year Intermediate (Science) class of the college for the first time thus marking the beginning of co-education in the history of higher learning in this part of the country.\n\nThe college was first affiliated to Calcutta University, Kolkata. It was under this university itself that the institution developed into a full-fledged Degree College and barring Persian, secured affiliation for the Honours course too in all the subjects taught then. However, with the establishment of Gauhati University in 1948, it became one of its original constituent colleges. Although Post-Graduate classes in certain subjects like English, Economics and Botany were introduced in the college at different points of time under Calcutta University itself, such classes had to be finally discontinued as part of economy drive and also because of the establishment of Gauhati University. It was only in 1969 that the Assam State Government decided to introduce PG classes in Physics in the college on a permanent affiliation basis. Subsequently, the benefit of PG classes was extended to other subjects as well and finally on 17th October, 1992 , the then Hon'ble President of India, Late Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma at a glittering function held in the premises of the college formally declared Cotton College as a Post-Graduate institution. Today, PG teaching is done in the college in as many as 21 departments. Now, the college, which began with 39 students and 5 teachers only, currently has a student enrolment of more than 5000 right from Higher Secondary to the PG classes and a faculty strength of 235.\n\nThe present day college has an infrastructure built on a sprawling campus covering an area of about 34 acres. The facilities include a modern Library well stocked with books, journals and rare manuscripts; well equipped Laboratories in different Academic Departments; a full fledged Department of Computer Science & IT; a vibrant Placement Cell, an Entrepreneurship Development Cell (EDC) and a Bioinformatics Infrastructure Facility (BIF) Center. In addition to these facilities, there are also a four bedded hospital, a Guest House, separate hostels for girls and boys, quarters for faculty, an Indoor Stadium, a canteen, a coffee house and an ultramodern State Bank of India ATM. All the Academic Departments, Centers and the College office are connected with round the clock Internet connectivity. In the year 2003, an 'Internal Quality Assurance Cell' has also been established to look after the internal quality of the institution.\n\nA Board of Governors constituted by the Govt. of Assam sits from time to time to decide on the policy matters relating to the academic and administrative activities of the college.\n\nCotton College celebrated its centennial with year-long program from May 27, 2001 to May 26, 2002. Krishan Kant, the then-Vice President of India graced the closing ceremony.\n\nCotton College has produced various politicians, authors, athletes, artists and may more known personality.\n\nThe Assam State Assembly passed the Cotton College State University Bill-2011 on 20th July,2011 wich declared that Cotton College would now become a university with power to affiliate colleges under it.\n\nContact Address :\n\nPrincipal\n\nCotton College\n\nPanbazar, Guwahati\n\nAssam, India\n\nPIN - 781 001\n\nPhone :"
