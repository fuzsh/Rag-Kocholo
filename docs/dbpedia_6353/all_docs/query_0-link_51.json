        "text": "Cotton College, Guwahati\n\nCotton College was established in 1901 by Sir Henry Stedman Cotton, the Chief Commissioner of the erstwhile British province of Assam. It had been the oldest institute of higher education in Assam, and the whole northeast India. It became the constituent college of Gauhati University in 1948, and then that of the Cotton College State University, when CCSU was established by an Act (Act XIX of 2011) of the Assam Government in 2011. It was established under The Cotton University Act, 2017 of the Assam Legislative Assembly to merge the Cotton College State University (CCSU) and Cotton College.\n\nThe college was started with five professors, which included Frederick William Sudmerson, the first principal of the college, and 39 students. The college was the centre of the freedom movement and the literary and cultural movements of the state to build the identity of Assam as a distinct integral component of India.\n\nThe college was declared as Special Heritage College in 2015.\n\nB.R.M Govt. Law College (earlier Earle Law College)\n\nB.R.M Govt. Law College was established in 1914 as Earle Law College. Named after Sir Archdale Early, the then Chief Commissioner of Assam, it has been a pioneer institute for legal studies in this part of the Country. It is a culmination of public sentiment and genuine demand of the people of Assam and vision of some of its eminent sons like Manik Chandra Baruah, Nabin Chandra Bordoloi, Tarun Ram Phukan, Rai Bahadur Bhuban Ram Das, Rai Bahadur Kalicharan SEn, S.N.Lahiri who saw it passed by the Education Conference held at Lord Curzon Hall (Now Nabin Chandra Bordoloi Hall) on September 12th,1912. This experimental measure which was set up for 5 years has now completed 100 years of establishment. It has come a long way since then and has produced innumerable legal luminaries.\n\nGuwahati, or Pragjyotishpur as it was called in ancient times,occupies a unique place in development of Assamese Nationality, its culture, customs, art and literature,sports and education. Alongwith the establishment of Cotton College in 1901,Raibahadur Bhuban Ram Das and Manik Chandra Baruah had another venture in their mind for the people of Assam. As good number of students of this part of the country had to go to Calcutta (now Kolkata) for pursuing a degree in Law.. Baruah through his rentless efforts could convince the British Government and ultimately the Hunter Commission in 1903 recommended the establishment of a separate law college for Assam instead of having law classes in Cotton College.

From itsFr. Joseph Baciarello humble beginning in a makeshift wooden structure near Don Bosco Square to its present enviable stature of imposing infrastructure and outstanding output, St. Anthony’s College has come a long way telling the story of achievements, growth and consolidation.
