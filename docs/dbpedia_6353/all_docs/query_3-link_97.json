        "text": "The Assam state cabinet's decision to merge Cotton College with the Cotton College State University (CCSU). This has of late cause series of apprehensions among Cotton College students.\n\nCotton College is one of the longest surviving colleges set up by the British over a hundred-year ago in Northeast India.\n\nThe college was established in 1901, Guwahati, with the support of the then Chief Commissioner of the then Assam Province (1896 to 1902) Sir Henry John Stedman Cotton and has been producing several leading personalities from the Northeastern region of the country.\n\nadvertisement\n\nStudent oppose the merger:\n\nThe merger of the two institutes was relentlessly opposed by the Cotton College Union Society (CCUS), which is the elected students' union body of the college.\n\nThe students are of the opinion that the merger will discredit the coveted A++ grade granted by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council in 2016.\n\nThe CCUS president Surajit Dutta along with other members at the press conference at the college campus on Sunday urged the state cabinet to consider rolling back its decision.\n\n\"We are most concerned about this merger. Students believe that the value of the degree offered by the proposed Cotton State University will be less than that offered by Cotton College. The A++ status of Cotton College will also be wasted. It will lose its identity after the merger,\" Thakuria said.\n\nIt would diminish the heritage and glory of the college:\n\nThe union further pointed out that the merger will not only diminish the heritage and glory of the college but also have adverse impact on the undergraduate programmes as it will lay more focus on research.\n\n\"The proposed university is likely to put more emphasis on research. Students of undergraduate classes will be the losers,\" said Surajit Dutta.\n\n\"The cabinet's decision to set up a new university by merging Cotton College and CCSU will make things more complicated. Our students are already sharing the college campus with those of the university,\" Thakuria added.\n\nRead: Delhi Nursery admissions: HC to hear private minority schools case today\n\nRead: PM Modi's Mann Ki Baat to focus on CBSE Class 10, 12 board exam\n\nClick here for education related news."
