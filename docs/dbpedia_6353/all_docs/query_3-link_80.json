        "text": "Cotton Incorporated, the not-for-profit research and promotion company for cotton, has expanded offerings on its Cotton University platform to include the College of Nonwovens. The free, online resource is part digital campus, part professional resource; and is aimed at supporting today’s industry professionals, while nurturing the next generation through education and engagement.\n\nThe College of Nonwovens comes in response to increased interest in using cotton for products as diverse as feminine hygiene, disposable diapers, and building and construction materials.\n\nJan O’Regan, Director of Nonwovens Marketing for Cotton Incorporated, explains: “Cotton’s unique properties and natural appeal are capturing the attention of nonwovens manufacturers and retailers in diverse markets around the world.” O’Regan adds, “The increasing number of inquiries we’ve received from these supply chain partners to better understand cotton’s role in nonwoven products inspired us to create the College of Nonwovens.”\n\nCotton Incorporated collaborated with Dr. Behnam Pourdeyhimi, Executive Director of The Nonwovens Institute of North Carolina State University to build the first course, “Introduction to Nonwovens”. Commenting on the project, Professor Pourdeyhimi said, “We are delighted to share our expertise for this initiative. The first self-paced course is an overview and we look forward to developing more content on raw materials, technical processes and market applications for nonwovens.”\n\nSince it was launched in 2012, Cotton University has attracted more than 15,000 industry professionals, university faculty, and student users. The site continues to attract thousands of daily visits from those interested in furthering their expertise in cotton and cotton textiles. The platform offers fourteen robust Colleges including the Colleges of Denim Manufacturing, Dyeing, Finishing, Knitting, Weaving, and, now, Nonwovens.\n\nCotton University is a project of the Cotton Board Importer Support Program (ISP) and managed by Cotton Incorporated."
