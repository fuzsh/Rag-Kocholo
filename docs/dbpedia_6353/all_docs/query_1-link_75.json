        "text": "Tom Cotton (born May 13, 1977, Dardanelle, Arkansas, U.S.) is an American politician who was elected to the U.S. Senate as a Republican in 2014 and began representing Arkansas the following year. He previously was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives (2013–15).\n\nCotton was raised on a cattle farm near the Ozark Mountains in Arkansas. He attended Harvard University (A.B., 1998) and then Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 2002. After working as a clerk for the Fifth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals, he briefly practiced law privately before enlisting in the U.S. Army in 2005. Declining an offer to serve as a military lawyer, he became an infantry officer and underwent training as a ranger. He completed tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan and later served in the United States as a platoon leader in the Old Guard, the military unit responsible for conducting burial ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery. He earned the Bronze Star and Combat Infantry Badge, among other awards.\n\nAfter leaving active duty in 2009, Cotton went to work for McKinsey & Company as a management consultant. Popular within the Tea Party movement, he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012 and easily won the election. After taking office the following year, he pursued a conservative agenda, opposing same-sex marriage, gun control, and defense-spending cuts. He also voted against many of Pres. Barack Obama’s initiatives, notably the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). In 2014 Cotton ran for the U.S. Senate, and he defeated the Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor in the hotly contested election. During the campaign, Cotton married Anna Peckham, an attorney.\n\nIn March 2015 Cotton made headlines after writing an open letter to the leaders of Iran—which was signed by most Republican senators—warning that any nuclear deal made with the Obama administration would require congressional approval. Two months later Congress easily passed the proposed agreement, with Cotton being the only senator to vote against it. During the 2016 presidential election, he endorsed Donald Trump, who later won the general election. He subsequently supported a number of the president’s policies, including a massive tax reform bill that passed in 2017. The following year he applauded Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal."
