        "text": "Steely Dan Aja (1977)\n\nFrom pitchfork.com\n\nToday on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at Steely Dan—from their early classic rock staples to their latter-day studio sleaze—with new reviews of five of their most influential records.\n\nFor much of my youth and young adulthood, I listened to music for cheap emotional catharsis, and so I preferred songs that were feral, tenuous, unstudied, and impolite—anything that sounded as mixed-up and precarious as I usually felt. I equated wildness with authenticity, and wanted only to be reminded, again and again, that I wasn’t alone or unique in my feelings. This isn’t a particularly unusual way to commune with records, though it is, perhaps, the easiest way. I eventually came to understand that over-valuing anguish and ecstasy—conflating theatrics with feeling, and feeling with Art—was limiting and naïve. Things like pleasure, contentedness, a solid laugh—any good, ordinary moment—are just as evanescent, and certainly just as formidable (and important) to capture.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, Steely Dan—the duo of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen—made cerebral, clever, formally sophisticated music that resisted any autobiographical extrapolating. Even in the context of the era—the late 1960s had seen the development and rise of both jazz-fusion and prog-rock, two of the brainiest, chops-iest genres going—their work was shrouded in irony and a distancing intellect. There was no pretense of dissolution or even emotion. Listening to their records felt like running my hands along a slab of polished marble—there were no craggy bits to grab on to, no easy way to find purchase—and so for years, I believed that Steely Dan’s seeming aversion to sincerity meant that they were cold and dorky. Did they not just make inert, polished music for men with meticulously groomed facial hair?\n\nThen Aja—Steely Dan’s sixth album, from 1977—turned everything around for me: It’s a thoroughly convincing argument against my notion that aggressive or discordant music was inherently real and rebellious, whereas virtuosic or studied songs were always limp and bloodless. Aja is as bold as records get. It’s full of strange, unprecedented, disorienting moves. It is braver, more idiosyncratic, and more personal, in some ways, than any other record I own.\n\nAja is as much a jazz record as a pop one, though in its best moments, it’s both and neither. Steely Dan were so expert at fusing genres it’s often hard to say what bit came from where, or exactly which tradition (fusion, R&B, soul, disco, classical) was being mined or reimagined. Because these songs were rendered so seamlessly, it’s easy to overlook how brazen they were. Aja is like driving down a treacherous, cliff-side road in the most luxurious car ever made: If you sink deep enough into that supple leather seat, it is possible to forget entirely about the twists and turns, the threat of looming destruction. It’s possible to forget about gravity entirely.\n\nSteely Dan is generally associated with Los Angeles, where they made most of their records, but Becker and Fagen are both New Yorkers (Becker was born in Queens; Fagen was born in suburban Passaic, New Jersey), and their sensibilities were plainly shaped by a kind of wry, East Coast cynicism. It manifests most palpably in Aja’s lyrics, which are funny, surreal, and, for the most part, narratively ambiguous. On a song like “Deacon Blues,” which they co-wrote, it’s impossible to deny the precision of their phrasing, and the unexpected depth of the song’s sentiment:\n\nLearn to work the saxophone\n\nI play just what I feel\n\nDrink Scotch whiskey all night long\n\nAnd die behind the wheel\n\nThey got a name for the winners in the world\n\nI want a name when I lose\n\nThey call Alabama the Crimson Tide\n\nCall me Deacon Blues\n\nBecker later said the song was about the “mythic loserdom” of being a professional musician—how glorious it might look from the outside, how grueling it is in practice. “Deacon Blues” is a fantasy of art-making, spun by someone who has never had to do the work, and therefore requires a funny sort of narrative distance: Becker and Fagen were looking at their own lives from the perspective of someone who wants what they’ve got, but also someone who fundamentally misunderstands the costs.\n\nAja produced three excellent singles (“Peg,” “Josie,” and “Deacon Blues”) and sold millions of copies, becoming the group’s most commercially successful release. But it was a perplexing bestseller. Steely Dan spent the 1970s getting progressively more esoteric: jazzier, groovier, weirder. Even now, mapping the album’s melodic and harmonic shifts is impossible to do with confidence. Its songs are sprawling and fussy, populated by oddball characters with inscrutable backstories, like “Josie,” from the song of the same name (“She’s the raw flame, the live wire/She prays like a Roman with her eyes on fire”) or “Peg,” an aspiring actress headed who-knows-where, who’s “done up in blueprint blue.” “Blueprint blue”! It’s the kind of simple, perfect description prose writers pinch themselves over.\n\nOutside of the studio, Becker and Fagen reveled in being a little rascally. They took long breaks from touring, and when they conceded to an interview, they often appeared self-satisfied, if not antagonistic. Their disdain for the record business occasionally bled into a disdain for their fans, itself a kind of merciless, punk-rock pose. When they did tour—like, say, in 1993, when, after a decade-long hiatus, they booked a few weeks of U.S. dates—they did not pretend to enjoy it. That year, when a reporter from The Los Angeles Times asked Becker how the tour was going, he said, “Well, not too good. It turns out that show business isn’t really in my blood anyway, and I’m looking forward to getting back to working on my car.”\n\nBecause the production on Aja is so expert—whole stretches are perfect, impenetrable, like the first 31 seconds of “Black Cow,” when that creeping bass line cedes passage to guitar and electric piano, and the backing vocals pipe up for “You were high!”—it’s easy to ignore the sophistication of its architecture. Becker and Fagen used obscure chords (like the mu major, a major triad with an added 2 or 9) and custom-built their own equipment (for 1980’s Gaucho, they paid $150,000 to build a bespoke drum machine). What they were doing was so particular and new, it was often difficult for critics to even find a vocabulary to describe it. On the title track, the verse shifts and dissolves as Fagen croons, “I run to you.” His voice thins as he finishes the line, a little gasp of tenderness. The minute-long drum solo that closes “Aja,” performed by the virtuosic session man Steve Gadd, is dressed with horns and synthesizers, and makes a person briefly feel as if they are being transported to a different dimension. Steely Dan revealed in making technical choices that would have hobbled a less ambitious outfit. That they succeeded still feels like some kind of black magic.\n\nBy 1977, it is possible that some corners of the culture had become desperate for music that was intellectually challenging but not exactly arduous to consume—something less predictable than Top 40, but not quite as hyperbolic or gnashing as punk. By the end of the 1960s, rock had been relentlessly and breathlessly defined as a frantic, bloody, all-consuming practice, for both performers and fans. Aja, though, doesn’t necessarily require any sort of deep emotional entanglement or vulnerability from its listeners. In that way, the record works as an unexpected balm, a break—a little bit of pleasure just for pleasure’s sake.\n\nIn 1977, on the day Aja was released, Cameron Crowe interviewed Becker and Fagan for Rolling Stone. Predictably, they were bemused by his questions. Becker told Crowe that they spent most of their time writing, recording, and obsessively tinkering. “We overdubbed a lot of the overdubs over,” he said. By then, whenever Steely Dan decamped to the studio, they hired a cabal of professional musicians—more than 40 are listed in the credits to Aja—and ran the sessions themselves, with militaristic precision. Becker and Fagen seemed to savor the idea that Steely Dan might be mischaracterized, in print, as something as pedestrian and ordinary as a band. “You can get studio musicians to sound exactly like a rock and roll band,” Fagen said. It’s obvious what he meant. They’d pulled one over on us, again.\n\nSteely Dan Gaucho (1980)\n\nFrom pitchfork.com\n\nToday on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at Steely Dan—from their early classic rock staples to their latter-day studio sleaze—with new reviews of five of their most influential records.\n\nA man flees west, pursued by saxophones. That’s how Steely Dan’s Gaucho starts, with “Babylon Sisters,” a foreboding melody that creeps into the room like toxic fog, and a lyric about a guy in a car en route to a three-way. While the horn section keeps rupturing the mood the keyboards are trying to set, the narrator spins stick-with-me-baby fantasies of California leisure and hedonism for his female companion(s). There may be no more perfectly yacht-rock tercet in the Dan canon than, “We’ll jog with show folk on the sand/Drink kirschwasser from a shell/San Francisco show-and-tell.” But even the singer doesn’t believe the sales pitch. By the end of the verse he’s talking to himself, or maybe he has been all along. “It’s cheap but it’s not free,” he says. “And that love’s not a game for three/And I’m not what I used to be.” Meanwhile, Randy Brecker’s muted trumpet dances around him, mocking his pain the way only a muted trumpet can.\n\nGood times! Is it any wonder Gaucho—the seventh Steely Dan album, and the last one Donald Fagen and Walter Becker would make together until the year 2000—is the one even some hardcore Danimals find it tough to fully cozy up to? The almost pathologically overdetermined production is elegant, arid, a little forbidding, and every last tinkling chime sounds like it took 12 days to mix, because chances are it did. And underneath that compulsive craftsmanship, that marble-slick surface, there’s decay, disillusionment, a gnawing sadness. But that’s what’s great about Gaucho. It takes the animating artistic tension of Steely Dan—their need to make flawless-sounding records lionizing inveterately human fuckups—to its logical endpoint.\n\nIt’s their most obviously L.A. record, so of course they made it in New York, after spending years out West making music so steeped in New York iconography it practically sweated hot-dog-cart water. And it’s also the most end-of-the-’70s record ever made, 38 minutes of immaculately conceived malaise-age bachelor-pad music by which to greet the cold dawn of the Reagan era. The characters in these songs have taken an era of self-expression and self-indulgence as far as they can. They’re free to do and be whatever and whoever they want, but all that severance of obligation has done is isolate them from other people.\n\nThe only character who’s having any kind of communal fun is the coke dealer on “Glamour Profession,” who makes calls from a basketball star’s car phone and takes meetings over Mr. Chow dumplings with “Jive Miguel…from Bogotá.” Everyone else is lost out there in the haze, having mutually demeaning sex or reaching for human connection in angry, possessive, usually futile ways. “Gaucho” and “My Rival” are both about relationships into which some threatening/alluring interloper has driven a wedge; both “Hey Nineteen” and “Babylon Sisters” are about older guys who chase younger women and wind up feeling older than ever. Things fall apart, the center does not hold, there’s a gaucho in the living room and he won’t leave, and it’s getting hard to act like everything’s mellow.\n\n“The Cuervo Gold/The fine Colombian/Make tonight a wonderful thing,” sings the narrator of “Hey Nineteen,” and then he sings it again, as if that’ll make it true. The narrator of the bouncy, Michael McDonald-enhanced “Time Out of Mind” seems to be in a pretty good mood, but it’s only because he knows he’s going to go somewhere later and smoke heroin until L.A. morphs into Lhasa. Everyone’s alone, or together in a way that’s worse than being alone; every lyric is a one-sided dialogue.\n\nThere’s a precisely calibrated mix of empathy and irony in the way the Dan observe these poor devils, these sinners in the grip of a checked-out God— Becker, perfectly, called it “a sneer and a tear.” This is, at points, a very funny record—particularly the title track, whose unfolding absurdity builds to the moment where the narrator, having caught his lover holding hands with a bodacious cowboy in a spangled leather poncho, cries out, “Would you care to explain?” in high dudgeon worthy of Frasier Crane.\n\nWhen Becker and Fagen started making this music, it was 1978, and they were coming off the platinum-selling Aja, the biggest hit they’d ever had. They briefly toyed with the idea of putting together a band and touring—a form of strenuous exercise they’d given up years earlier—but instead they went back to work on new music, and didn’t emerge from the studio until late 1980. One of the first tracks they finished was “The Second Arrangement,” a blithe kiss-off from an unapologetic Jaguar-driving lothario whose faithlessness is suddenly fashionable. You can find the song on YouTube in various states of completion—a piano demo with Fagen trying a shaky falsetto on the chorus, a polished instrumental, a bootlegged-sounding full-band version whose discoid thwack evokes a waterlogged “Get Lucky”—but you won’t find it on Gaucho. After an assistant engineer accidentally erased a large chunk of the master tape, Becker and Fagen tried for a while to recreate the track, then gave up on it entirely. It wasn’t the only good song they discarded during the sessions—even with all the king’s sidemen at their disposal, they couldn’t capture “The Bear” or the surreal colonialist fever-dream “Kulee Baba” either—but it might have been the best song on the album if it had survived. They replaced it with the merely-very-good “Third World Man,” a retooled track left over from the Aja sessions, featuring a downhearted soliloquy of a guitar solo by Larry Carlton, who was reportedly surprised to discover he’d played on Gaucho.\n\nFagen later described the “Second Arrangement” debacle to Rolling Stone correspondent Robert Palmer as “one of the most serious emotional setbacks we’ve had in the studio.” There are less-auspicious ways to begin work on a record. But maybe Gaucho was destined to go awry no matter what. By shrinking themselves to a two-man unit (plus longtime producer Gary Katz and engineer Roger Nichols) and forsaking the road, Becker and Fagen had cut down on the entropy to which even moderately successful rock bands usually succumb, but during the course of the Gaucho sessions, they were dealing with a range of high-class problems, from a court battle with MCA Records (who’d just absorbed the Dan’s old label ABC, and believed the final album the band owed that label was now contractually theirs) to Becker’s burgeoning heroin addiction, which made him an inconstant contributor to the band’s creative process. He played some guitar and bass on three songs, but as the sessions wore on, he was busy going through hell.\n\nIn January 1980, Becker’s girlfriend Karen Stanley, who Becker later said had struggled with depression, died of what may have been an intentional overdose in Becker’s apartment. Then, in April of that year, while walking on a New York street, Becker was hit by a taxi cab. He spent seven months in a cast with a fractured tibia and was effectively sidelined from the studio for most of the three laborious months it took to mix Gaucho. Mixing was Becker’s forte; Fagen was left to muddle through. During a visit to the studio in summer 1980, Palmer watched him sit with Katz and Nichols, “inhaling a cigarette in spasmodic gulps” while endlessly retooling the fade-out at the end of “Babylon Sisters,” eventually spending four hours fiddling with fifty seconds of music.\n\nOf the nearly 40 consummate studio pros whose work at the Gaucho sessions made the final cut, the player with the heaviest footprint belongs to “Wendel,” a Paleolithic 12-bit sampling unit designed and built by Nichols, deployed by Becker and Fagen to impose a drum-machine-like consistency on the work of live drummers like Steve Gadd and Rick Marotta. “In the ’80s,” Becker told Mojo years later, “hand-crafted, hand-played music was being overtaken by this increasingly mechanical, perfectionist machine music, and we were just trying to get there first. They had all these disco records that were just whack-whack, so perfect, the beat never fluctuated, and we didn’t see why we couldn’t have that too, except playing this incredibly complicated music…It seemed like a good idea.”\n\nOf course, the computerized micro-tweaking of live instrumentation is now as commonplace a part of pop-music production as reverb, but back then the option to program with real drum hits was tantamount to magic, especially for two guys who’d spent much of their professional lives being just a tiny bit disappointed by some of the finest session musicians on the planet. But Wendel was also a bit of a prickly collaborator. “[E]ven the most minute event,” the band wrote in the liner notes to a 2000 reissue of Gaucho, “had to be programmed in the gnarly and unforgiving 8085 Assembly Language, in which all relevant parameters needed to be described in its baffling hexagesimal-base numerical system, which ultimately became the only language Roger Nichols spoke or understood, at least for a time.”\n\nThe Dan’s commitment to the path of most resistance paid off. “Hey Nineteen” cracked the Top 10, and the album went platinum. Even Wendel got a plaque. Then in 1981, Becker and Fagen took an 11-year break from working together as Steely Dan. It’s probably a coincidence that this album about breakups and estrangements and encroaching age and the corrosive effects of hard drugs on human fellowship immediately preceded the not-drug-unrelated suspension of a longstanding creative partnership between two guys who were just entering their 30s. But we’re talking about Steely Dan here, not Fleetwood Mac—if they ever wrote about themselves, they’d never be uncool enough to admit it. It’s probably better to think of this as a loose concept album about people with a higher-than-average chance of dying in an accident involving downers and a hot tub, but one whose content couldn’t help but mirror the struggles in its makers’ lives. It might not be the best of Steely Dan albums, but it’s definitely the most Steely Dan of the Steely Dan albums. Becker and Fagen are too smart not to know ideals like perfection and grace are for opium dreamers, but can’t help reaching for them anyway.\n\nSteely Dan Everything Must Go (2003)\n\nFrom somethingelsereviews.com\n\nWhen Two Against Nature was released on Leap Day 2000, it was like the past 20 years of musical fads, artists, hip-hop, grunge, hair metal, speed metal etc. never existed. TvN picked up virtually where Gaucho left off. A little more jaded, sour, nuanced, even more sophisticated and complex under the sheen, steeped in layers of cool jazz phrases, but unmistakably Steely Dan. They were rewarded a year later at the Grammys.\n\nThen the world suddenly turned upside down as the celebration of the new millennium morphed into the gray dust, shock, and disbelief of 9/11. A new world of paranoia, fear, anger, limited expectations, and hardened cynicism emerged. As the smoke cleared, Steely Dan slunk back into the studio with their live band plus a few additional NYC session aces, and emerged after a much shorter hiatus. Let’s revisit Everything Must Go, released on June 10, 2003 …\n\nTwo Against Nature featured multiple layers of production and voices of cool jazz and hard bop over a funk pulse — a very slick 50s TV or movie score sound. The vocals were just another instrument. TvN revealed its layers with repeated listens. In contrast, Everything Must Go placed the vocals and tunes up front with instrumental accompaniment that harkened back to late 40s bluesy jazz and roots of R&B. More immediate and digestible, but there is an aura that is very wrong, almost nuclear in apprehension. Upside down.\n\nAgainst perceived type, Steely Dan was through with buzz. They eschewed digital recording to click and headphones and did the core of the album live-tracked and onto analog tape. Vocal and instrument overdubs were modest by their standards with only the slightest touch of digital tweaking at the end of the editing process, as the sound of their touring band permeates the recording. Walter Becker holds down the bass, shares guitar work with Jon Herington and even takes lead vocals.\n\nLive wunderkind Keith Carlock is the sole drummer on EMG, and he drives the album in a restrained jazzy way: awesome, but the monster is rarely let out of the box. Things seem backwards and bleak with loserdom in the 21st Century a running theme. Everything Must Go is a vocal and harmony-centric album that builds in vigor as the tracks progress. The first offering “The Last Mall” ends abruptly as if a terrorist cell dropped the big one on us. The final and title track on the album seems more like the place to start with Walt Weiskopf tipping the fez to John Coltrane and Ascension.\n\nIn fact, I find Everything Must Go more compelling when the tracks are played in reverse order. Try this experiment, if you dare!\n\nWeiskopf’s tenor sax leads the charge on the title track channeling ‘Trane and provide a preview of the delicious bridge. Donald Fagen’s Rhodes never sounded better. A corporation goes down Enron style in excess,” “the sky the moon … first run movies. Does anybody get lucky twice?” … a premonition of the Wall Street collapse and Great Recession of 2008-09.\n\n“Lunch with Gina” grooves hard with a strong party bouncer of a tune, and sassy horn chart over bubbling rhythm guitars. Donald is stood up again … or is he a victim of Gina the Grim Reaperess? “We got nothing but time.” Kewl synth solo with semi-shredding breaks up the party as the stalking continues.\n\n“Pixeleen” is a fantastic tune of our favorite virtual video game teen spy hero with her “as if boyfriend Randall” hero. There’s great clarity in construction and a spectacular call and response chorus and verse. Bill Charlap amazes on the ivories and shuts down the band.\n\n“Green Book” continues to explore the new virtual world where we escape the horrors of severed heads and torture camps on the news. Steely Dan gets pretty jiggy on a superb recording that features a stirring give and take solo between Walter Becker and Donald Fagen on guitar and synth, respectively. We’re so in love with this “dirty city, festive icons, and house on fire.” A true album highlight.\n\nWalter struts his bad self across the time-space continuum pimping the “Slang of Ages.” “Slang,” as in rap, with the opposite sex or slang as in the earliest slang, music itself? No matter. Ada Dyer, Carolyn Leonhart, Catherine Russell, Tawatha Agee slink through some sexy and tight backing vocals in contrast to Walter Becker’s balky, but effective, lead.\n\n“Godwhacker” conjures up a Warner Bros. cartoon view of the ultimate chase after Mr. Big for all the shit that’s gone down at a time where Aquarius was expected. Run, run, run … the rhythm section of Carlock, Walter’s bass, and Hugh McCracken and Jon Herington rhythm guitars just absolutely cooks. And yes. that is the return of Donald Fagen’s synth blues harp(!) followed immediately by a tasty guitar solo from Walter Becker.\n\n“Blues Beach” is a perky nuclear fallout Spongebob Squarepants kind of tribute to late ’60s pop (Laura Nyro, 5th Dimension, Sly & the Family Stone). An odd choice for a lead single with mighty recordings like “Pixeleen” and “Lunch with Gina” lurking. Taken as a fun one-off ditty with a twisty bridge and sneaky chords “Blues Beach” is a guilty pleasure. Is that sunburn from Ol’ Sol or an H-bomb flash?\n\n“Things I Miss the Most” piles upon our litany of losers from CEOs, the Almighty, the dead, the dying, ubercyber addicts, the lost in time, and the nuked to add a recent divorceé who misses their lifestyle, sex, and cool stuff rather than actually … her. He preaches his pep talk as sly jokes over microwave dinners and “building the Andrea Doria out of balsa wood.” The horn chart and keyboard work are really fantastic. There’s almost a Broadway musical element.\n\n“The Last Mall” is more fitting as an end — the very end — as impending doom is prepared to take the last artifice of cheap American commercialism in a sudden and violent way. Donald’s vocals are strong, more lively than on TvN, as they are throughout the album: “Rooolllll yer cart back up the aisle.” This is the big goodbye, the last call before meeting the blood orange sky when the plug is pulled. The perfect ending to the story was here all along … at the beginning.\n\nEverything Must Go has aged oddly well, with songs and a message even more pertinent today than they were when it was released. The sound remains classic and unwavering, perhaps a reflection of the more live and organic recording approach.\n\nWhile, ironically, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker carry on alive and well as a live act, EMG may be their swan song as a studio group. But somewhere in the collapse there is permanence: Everything Must Go lives on as a reminder of when we were all upside down and out. The tunesmithery is quite sharp, and the lyrics remain sly and witty.\n\nIt’s more than worth revisiting, as is the entire collection of Steely Dan and solo albums.\n\nSteely Dan Pretzel Logic (1974)\n\nFrom thequietus.com\n\nI think that there are some people out there who have earned the right to be arrogant pricks.\n\nThere aren’t many, mind you, but they all have a few things in common. Firstly, they are the best at what they do. Second, collaborators or colleagues will rise in indignant defence of their arrogant and abhorrent behavior. And lastly, no matter the experience, an encounter with said arrogant prick is still held as a point of pride among anyone in the same field.\n\nI’m not necessarily calling Steely Dan a bunch of arrogant pricks. I’m just saying that if they are, I think they are utterly justified. After all, who is able to call in a top-rate, legendary session musician, have them roll through countless takes and endure intense scrutiny, then gut their parts without a shred of mercy, yet still have that musician come running at the next call? Becker and Fagen, that’s who.\n\nSteely Dan had already become a successful and critically-lauded act before they started work on Pretzel Logic. They had produced two albums and had a hit single with ‘Reelin’ In The Years’. But having succumbed to a very stereotypical sophomore slump, the core songwriters of the band Walter Becker and Donald Fagen began their loathing for touring and the studio time it flushed away. They blamed the poor sales of Countdown To Ecstasy on the rushed nature of the recording process – a direct result of the band’s touring commitments. The pair proceeded to set up camp in the studio with a rolling cast of session musicians and began producing music of such compulsive perfection that they alienated the other Dan members whose purpose as a touring band was quickly becoming redundant. “We could see that there was just too much of a lie involved at one point,” Fagen told Mojo in 1995, “so they had to go”. By the next album, Katy Lied, even founding member – and original recruiter of Becker and Fagen – Denny Dias would find himself relegated to the position of session guitarist among five others.\n\nYet any bitterness, betrayal or wishes for reprisals felt by the players who Fagen and Becker replaced and subsequently sacked would be quashed by begrudged acceptance when the album was released. Pretzel Logic raked in the accolades, wooed the critics and gave the band the biggest hit of their career in ‘Rikki Don’t Lose That Number’.\n\nPretzel Logic is arguably Steely Dan’s template for their innovative and unparalleled mixing of the genres of pop/rock and jazz. Cramming intricacies previously only beholden to jazz musicians into succinct pop statements, Becker and Fagen seemed to have found their perfect format. No matter their jazz influence and harmonic complexity, the band always managed to stay within the pop lines. The reasons aren’t clear, whether it be about personal preference, self-limitation or just-the-way-it-turned-out, their character and expression were perhaps better suited to those spaces rather than in the world of free-form limitless roaming jazz. In fact, the challenge of squeezing their cornucopia of peacocking into tightly formed pop nuggets probably keeps their true nature from scaring off a broad audience. There is no dilution of their musical messages, and only two of the tunes run over four minutes (coincidently these are the album’s two singles that were later shortened for radio play).\n\nThey would pick and choose the pop music conventions they followed only inasmuch as it served their very particular needs. And man! – were they ever particular. In fact, this seems to be the top trait that pervades both in every character assassination and glowing review the pair have ever received.\n\nCountdown To Ecstasy at least allowed the possibility of live replication, but Fagen and Becker were over the whole realistically-reproducible thing and would subsequently use every tool and every instrumentalist (and instrument) at their disposal.\n\nDrummers were a special obsession for Fagen and Becker. Though Steve Gadd’s work on Aja might be the Holy Grail for many Danfan drummers, Pretzel Logic boasted two legends of can bashing. The album’s main drummer Jim Gordon influenced the careers of many other greats including the prolific session master Jim Keltner as well as Jeff Porcaro who counts himself quite lucky to have played double drums alongside Gordon on Pretzel Logic‘s pairing of pop and bop ‘Parker’s Band’. Gordon was the writer of the famous ‘Layla’ coda and played on dozens of hit albums before his undiagnosed schizophrenia sent him to his mother’s house with a hammer and a murderous rage. He is still serving time in a California psychiatric institution for her murder.\n\nLater indiscretions aside, Gordon plays a key role in the fantastic feel of the album. From the funkiness of ‘Monkey In Your Soul’ to the bossa nova of ‘Rikki…’, this album would not be what it is without Gordon’s right-hand driven groove.\n\nGiving the record another interesting dimension is Jeff ‘Skunk’ Baxter, whose pedal steel slides in at unexpected moments and within very unexpected song-styles. A stand-out example would be the masterful reproduction of a ragtime trombone solo on the Duke Ellington homage ‘East St. Louis Toodle-oo’. Its inclusion would likely cause confusion in any other setting, but its Gary Katz’s bright production that instead gives a beautifully unified and warm sound to the songs, making sure that no particular instruments are coming off brash. There are no single stars in Gary Katz’s vision of Steely Dan, just a seamless homogenous blend of understated virtuosity. Even Fagen’s nasally voice is made to fit its container without spilling a drip over the instrumentation. Full, lush, thick, however you want to call it, no space is wasted.\n\nThe lyrics are unabashedly pretentious and really must be chocka with phrases understood only by the band. The gibbering ‘Any Major Dude Will Tell You’ even introduces us to the mythical Squonk, an ugly wart-covered creature that dissolves in its own tears. Cheers for that, Dan.\n\nThe title track is a particular fan favourite and probably contains the most clear genre shift on the album: one between straight blues and a rhythmically subdued jazzy swing shout chorus, complete with Gordon rounding the toms. Tellingly, ‘Pretzel Logic”s first verse is inspired by the pair’s disdain for touring while overall it draws from the concept of time travel. Other passages veer into politics, drugs, betrayal, and New York City sketches but for the most part are pretty impenetrable. While he has received kudos from the odd critic for the lack of defined interpretation, Fagen has mostly enjoyed scoffs and snorts from pop lovers who see him as a supercilious nobhead vogueing Dylan.\n\nLyrics aside, Pretzel Logic represents a peak in the popcentric incarnation of Dan. Over the following albums the songwriting would slowly become more over-thought, then more overwrought in the studio, culminating in the comparatively cold and inaccessible Gaucho.\n\nNo one could argue that Dan and their fans have a propensity for pretentiousness, but it is a position that they have earned. Despite the horror stories and suggestions of a mean streak that sent countless pros packing, many musicians reveled in the challenge of pleasing Becker and Fagen. The satisfaction of making the grade was delectable and the test itself was enough to make a session player’s CV swell. Their pressure continually dragged the best out of the best and – with a track record like theirs – any player would have to be a fool not to endure.\n\nIn a 2003 interview Fagen muses on the band’s lack of visual presence. The group has never made a music video and has consistently downplayed everything that doesn’t have to do with the music immediately being made. The reasoning behind this, explains Fagen, is to not give away a hint of their own true artistic interpretations. Arguably, it’s not really possible to keep things in the abstract when you are doing interviews and writing memoirs that explain your art, but the conscious effort at keeping the music itself purely within its medium (especially at their level) is an admirable thing. However, most of all, the desire to keep their work concentrated and overlook indulgences shows how the egotism of Becker and Fagen is rooted firmly behind the mixing board – right where it belongs.\n\nIt’s been 40 years since Steely Dan’s core hunkered down in the studio to create this melodic masterwork and refined a reputation for striking fear into the hearts of session musicians. You may love or you may hate their particular brand of jazz influenced pop/rock, or you might believe them to be the arrogant pricks their behavior may suggest. But you cannot deny that this pair’s mutually fully realized vision is a marvel. In fact, Pretzel Logic in its complexity and concentration is a validation of every unpopular decision Fagen and Becker made and of every toe they trod upon.\n\nSteely Dan The Royal Scam (1976)\n\nFrom rollingstone.com\n\nWith each successive album, Steely Dan’s popular success and appeal become more obscured by sundry admirers’ claims of abstruseness and complexity. To some it seems inevitable that the Dan will eventually produce the Finnegan’s Wake of rock. And that’s silly: Steely Dan is trying just as hard as any random country/disco/metal band to capture our attention, i.e., sell records. For all their jazzy influences, they are a florid rock band, immersed in popular concerns and styles. True, songwriters Walter Becker and Donald Fagen bow to no one in the matter of composing immaculate, catchy cul-de-sacs, but it is that same immaculateness, the way the words, as impenetrable as they may appear, fit with metrical seamlessness into the melodies that makes their impenetrability of little importance to any casual listener caught up in the sound of the entire song.\n\nThat said, one must immediately note that their latest, The Royal Scam, is the Dan’s most atypical record, possessing neither obvious AM material nor seductive lyrical mysteriousness. It also contains some of their most accomplished and enjoyable music.\n\nThe core of the Steely Dan sound is the interplay of sharp, even grating, lead guitar (most often that of Denny Dias) and the cushion of Fagen’s various keyboards, always smooth, gliding, pulling the rest of the composition along. It has always been the hard nasal edge of both the lead guitar and Fagen’s vocals that rescued the band from slickness, and on The Royal Scam this contrast is more obvious and effective than on any previous record.\n\nIn fact, such is the pervasiveness of both musical and narrative tensions that the overall feeling of Scam is one of just that: tension. There is little of the self-confident gentleness that dotted Pretzel Logic, less still of the omniscience that suffused Katy Lied. The Royal Scam is a transitional album for Steely Dan; melody dominates lyric in the sense that the former pushes into new rhythmic areas for the group (more “pure” jazz, semireggae and substantially more orchestration than before) while the verbal content is clearer, even mundane, by previous Dan standards.\n\nWhile Scam is certainly not a concept album, every song—with the possible exception of “The Fez”—concerns a narrator’s escape from a crime or sin recently committed. Becker and Fagen have really written the ultimate “outlaw” album here, something that eludes myriad Southern bands because their concept of the outlaw is so limited. Rather than just, say, robbing banks (“Don’t Take Me Alive,” in which the robber is a “bookkeeper’s son”), Becker and Fagen’s various protagonists are also solipsistic jewel thieves (“Green Earrings”), spendthrift divorcÃƒÂ©es (“Haitian Divorce”) and murderously jealous lovers (“Everything You Did”).\n\nBut the Dan’s outlaws are also moral ones, guilt-ridden over comparatively minor sins. (Last time out, remember, Katy’s chief offense was that she lied, after all.) “Kid Charlemagne” is a selfish egotist, and suffers for it; “The Fez,” a sort of Dan-esque answer to Randy Newman’s “You Can Leave Your Hat On,” concerns a rather pathetic, if kinky, megalomaniac. At their best, these songs yield up concise surrealist introspection; at their worst, they suggest a paranoic death wish that is very amusing, if a bit unnerving. The lyrics are also pretty histrionic, and perhaps should not be scrutinized too solemnly.\n\nIn any event, I doubt that Steely Dan will ever become merely precious or insular; through five albums they have consistently circumvented their complexity with passionate snaz-ziness and fluky, cynical wit. If The Royal Scam lacks ready-made Top 40 fodder, it also widens Steely Dan’s already considerable parameters. Their next album, if one can speculate about this lovably perverse bunch, should be a pop killer. In the meantime The Royal Scam is well worth living with, pondering and, what the hell, even dancing to.\n\nSteely Dan Katy Lied (1975)\n\nFrom steelydanreader.com\n\nThe cover of Steely Dan’s 1975 LP Katy Lied shows an out-of-focus praying mantis floating amid bulbous plants. I used to stare at it as a kid, listening to the record in my dad’s leather reading chair and wondering who this “Steely” was. He sounded sort of like Bob Dylan, if Bob had just been defrosted out of a block of carbonite. (I was intensely devoted to The Empire Strikes Back, so carbonite was almost always on my mind.) Other Steely Dan records like Countdown to Ecstasy, Pretzel Logic, The Royal Scam and Aja opened onto a strange and ominous world: double helixes in the sky, Haitian divorcées, the rise and fall of an LSD chef named Charlemagne, someone who drinks Scotch and then “dies behind the wheel.” The photo on the inside gatefold of the Greatest Hits showed two nasty-looking guys standing in what appeared to be a hotel dining room.\n\nA few years later I found out “Steely Dan” was actually Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, and that their name was lifted from a William S. Burroughs novel (it’s a dildo), a discovery made while ditching seventh-grade social studies to read back issues of Rolling Stone in the public library. (I also learned that that the insect on the cover of Katy Lied was a katydid, not a praying mantis.) As an only child growing up in an unincorporated townlet in Wisconsin, there were many nights when it was just me in the chair and the Dan on the turntable and a few owls hooting in the woods. The sound of Dan music became as natural and enveloping to me to as the countryside itself. It led me to champion the songs of Becker and Fagen among the self-styled punks I later started hanging out with, provoking j’accuse-like denunciations: I was the enemy within, the guy who liked easy listening. I found disses among learned rock pedants in the magazines, too, which I began to catalog: Steely Dan was “hippie Muzak” and “Valium jazz”; their music “sounded like it was recorded in a hospital ward” and was “exemplarily well-crafted schlock”; they were a “brain without a body.” How could these people say such things about songs that were so deviant and bizarre and yet so warm and often staggeringly musical? The fact that the Dan had hits—really huge hits, actually, like “Do It Again,” and “Reelin’ in the Years,” and “Rikki Don’t Lose That Number,” and “Peg”—only made the whiff of some lurid, freaky luxury in the music seem more pronounced. You could be lyrically weird and musically oblique and still have lots of people like it. A mystery lurked at the center of it all. And the uncut essence of that mystery—the distillation of Dan music, the point beyond which the aesthetic cannot be pushed any further—is their airless, lacquered Masterwerk, Gaucho. Alternately held up as the apex of bloodless studio cerebration and fiercely defended among elite musos as multitrack record making at its finest, the sound of Gaucho is unmistakable. It shows up as recently as Usher’s just released Hard II Love record, the second track of which, “Missin U,” is built entirely around a four-bar sample taken from the last song on Gaucho, “Third World Man.”2.\n\nGaucho took two years to record, is only thirty-seven minutes long, and was the most expensive record ever made when it came out in 1980. The cover art shows a mustachioed man in a black hat doing a tango with a woman whose back is to us, the two of them frozen mid-caress in a yellow frame against a backdrop of speckled blue. The pair are cast in some kind of stucco, giving a tableau-like relief to the image that prepares the ear for the sculpted music within. Drop the needle on the opening bars: three tuned toms slink down to a sumptuously recorded Fender Rhodes electric piano breathing out the first eerie licks of “Babylon Sisters.” There are chords on Gaucho so cold and queasy they make you feel seasick. Reeds, guitars, pianos, horns, synths and human voices form mixtures achievable only in the controlled laboratory of the studio. (Like the Beatles, the Dan had stopped touring to focus exclusively on recording.)\n\nAs for the words, here is the second verse of the “Glamour Profession,” the last song on side A:\n\nAll aboard\n\nthe Carib Cannibal\n\nOff to Barbados\n\nJust for the ride\n\nJack with his radar\n\nStalking the dread moray eel\n\nAt the wheel\n\nWith his Eurasian bride\n\nThis is what I mean about lurid luxury: a high-tech yacht equipped with radar for stalking eels. Gaucho is packed with these sorts of perverse details, all with the glazed clarity of an opium trance. Take the title track’s “Custerdome,” which I imagine as a kind of dystopic Civil War memorial/penthouse, the residence of a gay couple whose domestic serenity is upset by a man in a “spangled leather poncho.” The jaded LA scenester in “Babylon Sisters” “jogs with show-folk on the sand” and “drinks kirschwasser from a shell”; on “Time Out of Mind” the narrator “chases the dragon” leading him to junk visions of a “mystical sphere straight from Lhasa, where people are rolling in the snow.” There are also “celluloid bikers,” “Szechuan dumplings” and a detective who wears a hearing aid. Nothing could be further from the tepid clichés of the era’s reigning soft rock.3.\n\nDuring the recording sessions for Gaucho, audio engineer, computer wizard, and Dan right-hand man Roger Nichols heeded Fagen’s wishes for superhuman perfection in drum performance and custom built a percussion sequencer he named Wendel. Designing and making dedicated hardware to meet the demands of a musician or composer is the sort of thing you might find going on at Pierre Boulez’s acoustic research facility under the Pompidou Centre, but rarely does this happen in the pop world. Yes, Michael Jackson had MIDI percussion triggers sewn into his pants and shirtsleeves so he could build drum patterns while he danced (genius); and yes, Prince actually invented a drum-machine sound, that wonderful clooshk you hear all over 1999 and Purple Rain and Around the World in a Day, which he discovered while experimenting with the tuning parameters on a Linn drum machine; but Wendel was built from scratch. It allowed for superfine inflections—there were sixteen different hi-hat samples instead of the single pulse of white noise typical of the drum boxes of the time—thus avoiding the ear fatigue that results from hearing an identical pattern looped over and over. “Wendel can play exactly what a drummer plays,” Nichols evangelized. And that was important to the Dan, who were known for ruthlessly plowing through ten or twelve drummers at a crack in search of the perfect take (more than forty musicians played on the recording sessions for Gaucho and only seventeen made it onto the record). Wendel was insanely expensive—one crash cymbal cost twelve thousand dollars worth of RAM—and getting the machine to “play” anything was a laborious, coding-intensive process undertaken in the 8085 assembly language, a now obsolete protocol for translating symbolic code into object code. Fagen remembered Nichols typing for twenty minutes and then pressing return for only a single snare hit to come out. It’s crude by today’s standards, but in the spring of 1979 it was, well, the radar equipped eel-stalking yacht of programmable percussion. WENDEL was awarded a platinum record after Gaucho sold a million copies.4.\n\nA few years ago I went to see the Dan play through all of Gaucho at the Beacon Theatre in Manhattan (they started touring again some time in the midnineties). I found a single seat online, right in the middle of the first row of the balcony. We happened at the time to need a new toilet seat in our apartment and my wife, who was staying home to care for our infant son, said, If you’re going out to the Beacon tonight can you get a new toilet seat while you’re at it? I figured this would need to happen before the show, which would start at about nine. So I left early and found one meeting my wife’s specifications at a place just up the block from the theater and then headed over. I’d timed it perfectly: the opening band had just finished and people were getting amped to see the Dan. I did that side-step move you do at a baseball game or a movie theater to reach the middle of a row—actually pretty perilous since I was holding a toilet seat over my head and to my right was a sheer drop off the balcony. I smelled weed and got scared because I thought the contact high would cause me to lose my balance and fall over the edge. When I got to my seat there was almost no room to move because I was squeezed between two Upper West Side Danheads with wispy gray ponytails (one of whom was the source of the weed) so I clutched the toilet seat to my chest and watched as a scarily well-rehearsed nine-piece band played through Gaucho from start to finish. Hearing a couple thousand people collectively singing lines like “bodacious cowboys such as your friend will never be welcome here / high in the Custerdome” and (of course) “the Cuervo Gold, the fine Columbian / make tonight a wonderful thing” was fun, even moving. But I also resented the experience because I wanted Gaucho all to myself, and finally cursed my decision to go to the concert when it would have been better to stay home and listen to the twenty-four-bit remastered version on my Bose noise-cancelling headphones. Gaucho burned brighter as a recording, I decided, and I craved the guaranteed exactitude of repeated listens heard again and again, always the same way. The toilet seat, still clutched to my chest on the subway ride home, seemed a fitting (or at least conveniently available) emblem for the way the resentment partially eclipsed the excitement of hearing Gaucho played live.5.\n\nJust about the time a compact disc of Gaucho arrived at the house in Wisconsin (my audiophile father had resolved to replace all of his LPs with copies in the new CD format) I was in the middle of my first slack-jawed read through a mass-market paperback of William Gibson’s Neuromancer. Gleaming silver wafers with laser-encoded music on them seemed to leap right out of Gibson’s technodelic near-future, and what I’m tempted to treat as the mere historical accident of the fully digital Gaucho appearing in tandem with my belated read through the novel has since been dispelled for two reasons: (1) Donald Fagen’s second solo record, Kamakiriad (1993), is a cyberpunk concept album about a hydroponic car with a bionic R & B sound even more frigid and airtight than Gaucho, and (2) Gibson himself has since written a fan essay (“Any ’Mount of World,” 2000) in which he notes his affection for the “paraliterary” songs of Becker and Fagen, referring to the imaginary third entity that results from their collaboration—“Steely Dan”—as appearing in “toe cleavage ostrich loafers flaking red Maui clay on the studio broadloom.”6.\n\nGibson’s great line neatly captures how far the Dan’s sensibility was from the rest of the lyrics found in standard FM gruel. Fagen and Becker actually allude to the agon with their peers on “Everything You Did” (The Royal Scam, 1976), when a dreary domestic dispute leads someone in the song to say “turn up the Eagles the neighbors are listening.” Less than a year later Don Henley wrote his epic “Hotel California” (which I also listened to and parsed for secret meanings in the leather chair) at the denouement of which the staff of the eponymous hotel try to “stab it with their steely knives but they just can’t kill the beast.” “It” was the hangover of sixties free love idealism and the subsequent trappings of seventies rock stardom: drug and alcohol dependency and various other hazardous enticements from which you may “check out any time you like” but “can never leave.” Some have heard in Henley’s weird adjective “steely” a rejoinder to the Dan. An online video series called Yacht Rock goes so far as to dramatize the backstory of the feud as a playground scene in which adenoidal Becker and Fagen are held in a double headlock by Henley and his fellow Eagle Glenn Frey—jock bullies beating up the eggheads.7.\n\nI’ve since found myself inhabiting a world that seems more and more to have been extracted from some Gaucho–inspired mise-en-scene. My mom (not herself especially fond of the Dan) recently purchased an Amazon Echo, the cylindrical AI that answers questions put to it in real time and which responds to the name “Alexa.” Alexa, what is Steely Dan? I asked on a recent visit to Wisconsin. “Steely Dan is a Grammy Award-winning American jazz-rock band featuring core members Donald Fagen and Walter Becker,” says Alexa. Wow, okay, not bad. Alexa, what is Gaucho? “Gaucho Sport Club is a Soccer Club in Passo Fundo, Brazil.” Nothing about South American cowboys? Alexa, what is Gaucho the Steely Dan album? “Sorry, I can’t find the answer to the question I heard.” Alexa, what is Katy Lied. Alexa: “Hmmm, I can’t find the answer to the question I heard.” Alexa, what is a katydid? My mom: “Paul, leave Alexa alone.” Leave Alexa Alone. It could be the title of a Steely Dan album.\n\nSteely Dan: The 1993 interview when Walter Becker opened up about Steely Dan’s subversive intentions\n\nFrom latimes.com September 2017\n\nWalter Becker, co-founder with Donald Fagen of Steely Dan, died Sunday at age 67. In this Sunday Calendar interview published in The Times on Aug. 22, 1993, Becker and Fagen talked with Chris Willman at the start of their first reunion tour after 19 years away from the stage as Steely Dan and a little more than a decade after they last recorded together as Steely Dan. They went on to make two more albums together and continued to tour together until illness forced Becker to pull out of a Steely Dan performance at the Classic West festival at Dodger Stadium in July. In this interview from the archives, Becker and Fagen, with biting wit, discuss the dichotomy of the anarchy of their lyrics and the jazz harmonies of their singular sound.\n\nFLASH BACK TO THE LATE ‘70s, exact date undetermined. You turn on “The Donny and Marie Show,” and see one of the most weirdly funny things ever on national television: The teen sibling hosts in spangles and bell-bottoms are doing a tribute to nostalgia, in the form of a bouncy duet of Steely Dan’s “Reelin’ in the Years.”\n\n“The weekend at the college didn’t turn out like you planned,” a beaming Donny Osmond sang to Marie, by all appearances clueless to the absurdity of Donald Fagen and Walter Becker’s unwieldy verses in his beaming mouth. “The things that pass for knowledge I can’t understand.” . . .\n\nDid Donny have the slightest idea what he was singing?\n\nDid Steely Dan fans, for that matter?\n\nDonny and Marie weren’t alone in being oblivious to the often hidden meanings of Fagen and Becker’s hits, which were just hooky enough to be permanently embedded in many millions of craniums despite a popular lack of comprehension of what subversive ideas might lie therein.\n\nWhat American of a certain age can’t sing a few seemingly random phrases of Fagen and Becker’s strange design: “Babylon sisters, shake it.” “Drink Scotch whiskey all night long, and die behind the wheel.” “Drink your big black cow and get outta here.”\n\nThe dangerous, funny, possibly misanthropic elusiveness of the lyrics was matched by Becker and Fagen’s relative reclusion as pop personalities. It was up to Donny and Marie and a lot of lounge singers to publicly perform Steely Dan’s hits because Donald and Walter wouldn’t. The duo disbanded its backup lineup and quit touring in 1974, ceasing all live performances well before most of their major hits were even released.\n\nIt was frustrating to some fans that jazz-influenced music that benefited from some of the best studio playing in the business couldn’t be heard in a live setting. But to the true aficionado, Steely Dan’s unwillingness to waste time touring in order to focus on the bigger rewards of record-making was just the ultimate measure of their ornery integrity.\n\nFlash forward to the present, at which point Fagen, 45, and Becker, 43, have done the unthinkable and — an astonishing 19 years after their previous gig — booked a brief U.S. tour under the moniker of Steely Dan, which itself has been retired for well over a decade. Nearly all of the shows — including dates at the Greek Sept. 7-8 and Irvine Meadows Sept. 10 — sold out within minutes or hours of going on sale. (Tickets still remain for a show at the Blockbuster Pavilion Sept. 11.)\n\nAnd while fans salivate at the idea of the Dan made flesh, a few couldn’t help but be nagged by the fear that, after all this time, a “reunion” tour might represent another kind of sell-out, in which the Steely ones finally cave in to the demands of the masses after all.\n\nWill their “Reelin’ in the Years” end up like Donny and Marie’s: taking what was written as a backhanded look at memory-mongering, and unfortunately resurrect it as an irony-free anthem to nostalgia?\n\nFar be it from these fellows to dissuade anyone else’s hard-fought cynicism.\n\nContacted by phone for comment on how the opening Midwest dates on the tour went last weekend, Becker answered, “Well, not too good. It turns out that show business isn’t really in my blood anyway, and I’m looking forward to getting back to working on my car . . . “\n\nWhew. Incorrigible after all.\n\nOlder fans may still think of Becker and Fagen as bad boys, but talk up the band to any self-respectingly “alternative” teen or twentysomething “Lollapalooza”-goer, and the image they have of Steely Dan in their young minds will produce about the same look of distaste as if you’d suggested they attend a Kenny G show. It’s hard convincing them that, for all the inherent musical “slickness,” Steely Dan was the alternative band of its time.\n\nWe thought superimposing jazz harmonies on pop songs was subversive.\n\nWALTER BECKER\n\nThe generation gap is obvious enough that you could update the lyrics of the group’s 1980 Top 10 hit, a tune about dating a girl too young to be familiar with Aretha Franklin, to apply to Steely Dan itself: Hey nineteen, that’s Donald Fagen / She don’t remember the Kings of Scorn . . .\n\nThe instrumental warmth and smoothness of the sounds was a necessary tonic for the bitterness sometimes infecting the sentiments (or lack of them). Theirs could be a chilly, emotionally barren landscape, filled with fictional characters and place names that had less to do with Dylan’s or Springsteen’s use of the same devices than their own post-Burroughsian, pre-cyberpunk uncharted universe.\n\nSteely Dan’s key oldies get played on most of the available radio formats. But in trying to figure out exactly who it was that snapped up all those tour tickets so instantly, it comes to mind that there are probably two core audiences for Steely Dan:\n\nFirst and foremost, there are those lingering, literarily minded, misanthropic anarchists who always dug the Dan’s bad attitude.\n\nAnd then, of course, there’s the pacifist army of modern “Wave” listeners.\n\n“I’m sorry?” asks Fagen, apparently not familiar with the latter radio format.\n\n“People who listen to the light jazz radio station, like ‘The Wave,’ ” says Becker, jumping in to help.\n\nGiven the cultural divide between these two camps, we continue, does the duo worry that any brawls might break out between the surly old hepsters and the gentler sax-lovers at these shows?\n\n“They’re probably just exactly the same people,” muses Becker.\n\n“They’ll all have an inner conflict,” Fagen offers.\n\n“Right,” says Becker, “they’re probably different shadow personalities of the same people.”\n\n“Dupe-elgangers,” puns Fagen.\n\n“If you will. And I think you will,” adds Becker, with a hint of menace.\n\nIt is a funny split, in any case, this leap between the anger in many of Steely Dan’s songs over the years and the easier-listening strains the group eventually became best known for.\n\nA handful of rock acts, from Randy Newman to Was (Not Was), have emulated this dualism of purpose. But historically, musicians informed by jazz rapids have drifted toward unchallenging lyrical currents, whereas, conversely, bands with subversive intentions tend to deliberately drift toward unsophisticated styles of music. As a group with credentials toward serious musicianship and an intellectually insurgent attitude, Steely Dan remains widely adored, and hardly imitated.\n\n“Why is that?” says Becker, leaping ahead to the question. “Well, in that respect the situation hasn’t changed in 20 years. It’s the dichotomy that you mentioned a moment ago: The ‘anarchists,’ or people who are interested in more interesting lyrics, are generally speaking not interested in jazz harmonies. They want something more raw and what they perceive to be subversive-sounding, which usually means clanging guitars.\n\n“And it was just a quirk of Donald’s and my natures that we thought superimposing jazz harmonies on pop songs was subversive in a much subtler way. But I guess most people who are writing music and songs don’t really look at it that way . . . luckily for us!”\n\nAdds Fagen, “I think people who are sophisticated in the sense that they want to hear some substance in the lyrics are musically going to tend to be primitivists . . . “\n\n“Or some sort of socialists,” points out Becker.\n\nFagen: “Yeah. They have that kind of nostalgia de la boue, they’re into this purity thing of rock ‘n’ roll — they see it as once being the sort of revolutionary teen-age thing and they want to maintain that.\n\n“It has to do with when we were born and how we grew up,” Fagen explains. “Even though we were really too young to experience a lot of the golden age of jazz in the ‘50s, nevertheless that’s what we were into, through recordings, although we saw live jazz as well at the tail end of that era. And we also had literary aspirations, I suppose.”\n\nA developmental quirk of fate?\n\n“Quirk of fate. Of course, there are no accidents . . . as they say in Vienna.”\n\nAs the oft-repeated story goes: Becker and Fagen met at New York’s Bard College in the late ‘60s, where they shared an equal love for black humor and Charlie Parker and disdain for many things hippie-ish. They participated together in a series of bands before joining up with, of all groups, Jay & the Americans, the first of their bad touring experiences.\n\nAfter selling a few of their songs at the famous Brill Building in New York, they moved to L.A., set up with a publishing deal as hired hands of ABC Records. Their early songwriting demos — widely bootlegged and disseminated — show that the duo had their unique “voice” from the start and were hilariously ill-suited to writing generic hits for mainstream stars (although a few compositions did get recorded, including “I Mean to Shine” by Barbra Streisand).\n\nEventually the ABC label was convinced that these boys were better off writing for themselves. The year 1972 brought the name Steely Dan (borrowed from a dildo of the same name in William Burroughs’ novel “Naked Lunch”) and the debut album “Can’t Buy a Thrill,” with an auspicious first single, “Do It Again,” that went to No. 4.\n\n“When we went out (on tour) in support of the first album, the record company in a way forced us out,” Fagen explains. “That was a thing that you were supposed to do. The original band was put together very quickly — almost instantly, really. And we were dealing with musicians we didn’t know very well. Toward the end of our touring days, after two years of touring around and with some additional personnel, we were starting to get pretty good.\n\n“Although the players were good players, we wanted to do a variety of types of music and work with other musicians. And they basically — and very justifiably — wanted to go out and play and make money. And so we decided to disband and concentrate on recording and writing music, which takes a lot of time and thought, and to eventually put another band together, perhaps, and go out. But I guess inertia set in, and we ended up just making records.”\n\nThe retirement from the stage was never meant to be permanent. In fact, Becker and Fagen put together and briefly rehearsed a band to tour behind their biggest album, 1977’s “Aja,” but got fed up with the logistics and the musicians’ financial demands before any dates got booked.\n\nIt turns out that show business isn’t really in my blood anyway, and I’m looking forward to getting back to working on my car.\n\nWALTER BECKER\n\nLike another quintessential ‘70s group, the Eagles, Steely Dan followed up its most successful album (“Aja” equals “Hotel California”) by becoming perfectionists in the studio and spending years on a final effort whose painstakingness effectively killed the band (“Gaucho” / “The Long Run”). In 1981, while still considered commercial superstars, Becker and Fagen announced the dissolution of their partnership.\n\nFagen released a very successful solo debut in ’82, “The Nightfly,” and Becker produced a few jazz and pop albums. Otherwise, the two men who produced one of the most enduring pop oeuvres of the ‘70s were maddeningly invisible throughout the ‘80s.\n\nThe collaboration officially resumed with Becker’s production of Fagen’s recent “Kamakiriad” album, on which he also played bass and guitar; Fagen, in turn, has co-written songs for the album Becker hopes to have out next year, on which he’ll be singing lead vocals for the first time since a few errant verses on Steely Dan’s debut 21 years back.\n\nThe tentative step back toward the dreaded touring process was a result of the New York Rock and Soul Revue, a combo Fagen put together in 1991 to play R&B oldies. A few Steely Dan oldies found their way into the set, and eventually Becker even sat in on a few dates.\n\n“I just got comfortable being on stage again,” Fagen says of the Soul Revue shows. “Now we have an opportunity to go out with musicians of our own choosing (a 10-piece band including players such as Weather Report drummer Peter Erskine and saxman Bob Sheppard), and we’re touring under conditions which can’t even be compared with what we were doing then, which was opening for a lot of heavy metal groups. And the technology of touring has become refined and much more comfortable, much more human.”\n\nAs for the ever-present danger of unseemly nostalgia, Becker readily admits, “I don’t know if it’s really possible to transcend that danger and do old songs at the same time.”\n\nBut, the danger surrounding the N-word is allayed — if not transcended — by the fact that, by Becker’s rough reckoning, the 3 1/2-hour shows are composed of “half Steely Dan stuff, half stuff from Donald’s record, and half stuff from my record.”\n\nThere’s another factor working in Steely Dan’s favor to wipe out any would-be mustiness here, and that’s the fact that almost none of the material from the band’s 1972-80 life span sounds dated. In terms of the massive contemporary appreciation of irony as a replacement for old-school rock idealism, it rather seems the world caught up with the cynical voice that Fagen and Becker were able to claim from the get-go.\n\nGo back and listen to “The Royal Scam” — which many fans consider the pair’s best, most literary-minded and darkest album — and marvel at its seeming topicality: An ominous narrative about a normal guy who up and snapped, well-armed and holding off a SWAT team (“Don’t Take Me Alive”); a cheerful ode to the importance of always wearing a condom (“The Fez”); a hauntingly lyrical paean to dream-laden immigrants who wind up among America’s homeless (the title track). All virtually ripped from today’s headlines, despite the album’s 1976 copyright date.\n\nBut as the popular culture seems to have become as cynical as Steely Dan at its peak, our heroes may have themselves grown a slight bit kinder and gentler, if Fagen’s emotionally richer “Kamakiriad” is an indication. (Ironically.)\n\n“Actually Walter and I are very sweet-natured lads,” Fagen insists.\n\nNot that they’re ever likely to be renamed Softie Dan. “We were angry kids, there’s no doubt about it,” he continues.\n\n“To a lot of people, the ‘60s is now some sort of incredible layer cake invented by the media. But the fact was that we did have the attitude that we were brought up with inauthentic values, etc., and were trying to find some other kind of alternative values. We were looking for that in a very aggressive way. And as you get older, you’re not that angry anymore.”\n\nSo maybe now — nostalgia be damned — even they can sing “Reelin’ in the Years” with a slight smile.\n\nSteely Dan Katy Lied (1975)\n\nFrom somethingelsereviews.com\n\nReleased in March 1975, the often-overlooked Katy Lied marked the first album after the breakup of Steely Dan’s original lineup. From now on, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker would choose from among music’s most talented and sought-after sessions players. As the following five deep cuts show, Katy Lied was better for it.\n\nFagen continued to emerge as a nuanced vocalist whose eccentric inflections tip off the sinister meaning behind seemingly innocent phrases like “You must know it’s right / The spore is on the wind tonight / You won’t feel it till it grows.” He wanted Michael McDonald, who makes his initial appearance as a background singer here, to take over as lead vocalist – but thankfully got voted down. McDonald’s contributions gave these sessions some fantastic lift, but he couldn’t match Donald Fagen’s feel for the songs’ complex lyrics and moods.\n\nOf course, you can’t have a discussion about Katy Lied without also touching on the infamous dbx debacle. Obliquely referred to in Becker and Fagen’s 1999 liner notes, this mixing issue was explained in gory detail by guitarist Denny Dias, who has a standout moment on “Your Gold Teeth II.”\n\n“Mixing was an absolute nightmare. Every song was mixed at least twice, and not because we were being fussy,” Dias later recalled. “In fact, we had mixed the entire record before we realized that there was a problem. We were using the new dbx noise reduction system, which was supposed to give us a better signal-to-noise ratio than Dolby, and for some reason the dbx units could no longer decode the mixes on tape. They sounded dull and lifeless, and no one could explain why.”\n\nEven legendary engineer Roger Nichols was reduced to a mere, dumbfounded mortal. Ultimately, the task of remixing and mastering fell to Dias by default, because no one else wanted to do it. To the great credit of Dias and Walter Becker (who stepped in late into the process), Katy Lied was salvaged sufficiently enough for release. The 1999 remaster further improved the audio fidelity, even if marginally so.\n\nStill, that shortcoming – real or perceived – doesn’t rise to the level of distraction. Maybe it would have, if the music itself had been mediocre, but there are way too many accomplished traits found in every song as Katy Lied skillfully reconciles rock, jazz and blues into a radio-friendly format.\n\nYou hear it in radio favorites like “Black Friday” and “Bad Sneakers,” of course, but also in the album’s lesser-known moments. Let’s return to five of them here:\n\n‘ROSE DARLING’\n\n“Rose Darling” is one of the band’s fairly rare love songs, but in true Steely Dan fashion, it’s really more of a lust song. The narrator seems to be pleading so hard with the object of his attempted affair that he even begins to drop the pretense that this is about romance: (“All my empty word of love / can never screen the flash I feel”) and even gets nasty (“you won’t feel it ’til it grows”).\n\nWhile Walter Becker and Donald Fagan are cracking themselves up over the lyrics, the music behind them is, as usual, seriously good. “Rose Darling” benefits from tasteful piano comping, crisp drumming and the newly added Michael McDonald lifting up the chorus. There’s also a clean, bluesy guitar courtesy of Dean Parks. Parks was a long-time favorite sessionist of Steely Dan, having appeared on records ranging from Pretzel Logic to Two Against Nature. Before he got his first call into a Steely Dan recording session, Parks had already done dates for Stevie Wonder, Helen Reddy, Bobby “Blue” Bland, Marvin Gaye and Billy Joel.\n\nFor “Rose Darling,” Parks’ liquid, string-bending lines found a perfect place alongside that piano. This was also one of the rare times where he soloed on a Steely Dan record, since Parks was typically brought in only for rhythm work. Sounding a bit like Larry Carlton (another legendary L.A. session guitarist who appeared on the next track from Katy Lied), Parks is never about flash but is all about taste. Dean Parks’ understated performance ensures that “Rose Darling” still holds up, decades after it was taped.\n\n‘DOCTOR WU’\n\nSupposedly a tale of a breach of trust between a physician and patient, “Doctor Wu” represents one of the finest examples of Steely Dan’s signature mastery of an intricate yet soulful harmonic progression.\n\nThough it didn’t catch fire with me at first, this artful combination of prose, melody and execution has to rank up there as one of the group’s best-ever moments on record. The cherry on top of this Steely Dan sundae is Phil Woods’ guest appearance. Already an alto-sax legend well before he taped this date, Woods’ advanced but smooth execution is here in full glory.\n\nIt took someone of that stature to hold his own inside a perfectly crafted tune such as “Doctor Wu.” The bop legend, whose lavish phraseology also graced Billy Joel’s “Just the Way You Are,” offers a passionate swing you rarely hear from saxophonists of later generations.\n\n‘YOUR GOLD TEETH II’\n\nSteely Dan is famously known for performing rock with a heaping dose of jazz elements, but those songs would rarely swing, as jazz does. Here’s a notable exception.\n\n“Your Gold Teeth II,” the obvious followup to “Your Gold Teeth,” is only connected to the earlier version lyrics-wise. There’s some reference to a William S. Burroughs novel, I believe, but musically it’s much different.\n\n“II” was, up to this point, the most sophisticated song Steely Dan had attempted, and a harbinger of the style they perfected later on with Aja. The best performances are provided by Jeff Porcaro and Denny Dias.\n\nPorcaro had to not only pilot through shifting rhythms but also give “Your Gold Teeth II” the right feel. Donald Fagen suggested Porcaro listen to a Charles Mingus record featuring drummer Dannie Richmond in order to understand the particular drumming style Fagen wanted. As a teen, Fagen used to take a bus into New York City to watch Mingus’ band perform, and he was looking for the drum performance he remembered seeing from Richmond back then. Porcaro returned a couple of days later and nailed it, shuffling with the mastery of Elvin Jones – never mind Richmond.\n\nDias was incredible on this song, too. Though he often played in the shadow of Jeff Baxter, Denny was the guy Walter Becker and Fagen called when looking for liquid jazz phrasings and dense note patterns over intricate chord and rhythmic changes. It was one area Denny Dias excelled in, even over Skunk. That ability is on display here, as he offers one of the best (and unheralded) of all the great Steely Dan guitar solos.\n\nSteely Dan is a rock band that was capable of doing things most rock bands can’t even comprehend, much less carry out. “Your Gold Teeth II,” one of my top two favorite Steely Dan songs overall, is one of those moments that clearly sets them apart from the pack.\n\n‘CHAIN LIGHTNING’\n\nEarly on, Steely Dan liked to occasionally break from cerebral arty jazz-rock and just jam out on a simpler, blues-based ditty. “Chain Lightning,” with its standard 12-bar approach, is a fine example of the form.\n\nFeaturing another appearance by guitar great Rick Derringer, “Chain Lightning” can also be construed as a follow-up to the earlier “Show Biz Kids” – a one-chord song where Derringer was allowed to play his vicious slide from beginning to end. “Chain Lightning” has far more chords and Derringer doesn’t slide, but he once again owns the song.\n\nHis raw, biting licks alone put an edge to the song that more than canceled out Fagen’s airy and harmonized vocals. In the intervening time between the songs, Derringer had attained a measure of stardom from this first solo album and the evergreen boogie-rock hit “Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo.” But Rick Derringer is first and foremost a blues guitarist and, as with his first time out in a Steely Dan session, he fit the bill for “Chain Lightning” perfectly.\n\n‘ANY WORLD (THAT I’M WELCOME TO)’\n\nOn occasion, Walter Becker and Donald Fagen would bring one of their heroes into the studio for a guest appearance. Ray Brown contributed acoustic bass to “Razor Boy,” and Wayne Shorter later played sax on “Aja.” “Any World (That I’m Welcome To)” boasts the drumming of the great Hal Blaine.\n\nIn terms of chart success, there’s been no one even remotely close to him: Forty, that’s right, 40 of the songs Blaine drummed on topped the charts – and a total of 150 made it into the Top 10. The Grammy award for Record of the Year went to songs featuring Blaine for six consecutive years between 1966-71.\n\n“Any World (That I’m Welcome To)” is one of many Steely Dan songs where the drumming sounds easy, but that’s only because Hal Blaine is making it sound easy. The verses are low key, but the transition to the chorus is more uptempo, and the chorus itself shifts to a fills-laden crescendo and then back again to the gentle gait of the verses. Blaine was able to handle all the discreet modulating of cadence and timekeeping the song demanded with aplomb.\n\nJeff Porcaro, who handled drums on the rest of Katy Lied, could have tackled this, too. But sometimes you gotta make room for the champ – or, as been reported, Porcaro slept in that day. Either way, Hal Blaine’s appearance on a Steely Dan song is something that just had to happen. For whatever reason, it did – and I’m glad.\n\nSteely Dan: Are You Relivin’ the Years? – How Steely Dan Became a Cult Favorite for Millennials (2021)\n\nFrom theringer.com July 2021\n\nEven as younger generations seem to be at war with baby boomer ideals, there is one relic of the ’70s they can get behind: the soft-rock sounds of Donald Fagen and Walter Becker. How did a band known for its love of jazz and songs populated with down-on-their-luck characters become popular all over again?\n\nToTo look at American society over the past decade—from its memes, to its cultural criticism, to even its electoral politics—one might surmise the nation is consumed by a bitter and Manichean generational struggle, where no quarter is given and none taken over the power baby boomers wield as they cling to institutional power.\n\nMaybe so. But there are notable exceptions, and perhaps the most notable comes from the medium through which the boomers shaped America’s cultural identity for decades: classic rock. Steely Dan, the jazz-rock combo whose musical and lyrical checkpoints include those most boomer-ish of pursuits such as cool jazz, hot guitar licks, tiki drinks, and expensive cocaine, have become an object of millennial obsession, spawning viral tweets, mash-ups, and even a custom run of streetwear emblazoned with their album art. John Mulaney and Nick Kroll wrote a bit based on Steely Dan for their hit Broadway show Oh, Hello. David Crosby, a fellow Boomer icon who’s become a Twitter favorite in his own right, earned blog press with a new Dan-inspired (and cowritten) tune. The list goes on.\n\nEven in their time, Steely Dan were one of rock’s most idiosyncratic outfits—they covered Duke Ellington, peppered their records with references to obscure spiritualist sci-fi authors, and foreswore the big-time arena rock touring circuit at their (and its) peak. Of all this, what about them led millennials to pluck the band from the genre’s back pages, placing them on the shelf of honor next to legacy acts like Fleetwood Mac or Bruce Springsteen who have renewed their cred in a similar fashion?\n\nAttempting to explain why certain music goes in and out of vogue might be, to reference the quote apocryphally attributed to the comedian Martin Mull, like “dancing about architecture.” But in taking a stab at it, it’s only fair to offer the first opportunity to the architect of the music in question: Donald Fagen, Steely Dan’s lead vocalist, co-songwriter, and bandleader, whom I spoke with earlier this summer by phone.\n\n“Developmental psychology might figure in,” Fagen wrote to me after our conversation. “Kids and teens resent the domination of the parents—they begin as hostages to their dad’s taste in music. Of course they hate it (though, in truth the stuff we wrote used tropes more common to the popular music of their grandpops). As they head into middle age, a lot of kids start to forgive their parents … so, as the prejudices of their youth crumble a bit, they’re free to be more objective about what they hear—or, they might even have a subliminal, sentimental attachment to sounds they heard in the womb, in the kitchen, in the back seat of their dad’s car—or something like that.”\n\nFagen’s insight is spot on, true to both his body of lyrical work and the sharp cultural criticism he’s written for outlets like Slate and Harper’s Bazaar. Millennials are, of course, growing into their own soft middle age, where one’s identity is less defined by the cultural postures of youth than the big choices one might have made (or not made) while striking them. Their taste, then, is freed up to roam toward what they might have once overlooked as outré.\n\nIn that light, it’s easier to see Steely Dan’s music as its savvier observers always have: not a smooth-jazz accoutrement to the spoils of boomer aristocracy, but an über-sardonic critique of it. And in addition to the generational shift, there’s an aesthetic one: Pop music, broadly defined, gains its cultural currency through an antagonistic relationship to the status quo. When it comes to the counterculture of the past few decades, Steely Dan’s music has been anything but part of that firmament.\n\n“There’s a knee-jerk, reactive way that cultural fashion evolves in its time,” says Robert Christgau, the “dean of American rock critics” and an avowed fan of the Dan. “Punk—now that’s, like, so old hat. Your generation’s immediate elders are always putting it in your face. … And there’s also indie rock, not quite the same thing, which people are also now finding tedious.”\n\n“There are cycles with things that are completely organic, that’s built into being alive,” he continues. “And so far as you’re using your brain, which as a critic, you really should be, music doesn’t suddenly disappear.”\n\nThe music of Steely Dan is now very much un-disappeared, with the help of the aforementioned litany of memes, the archival resource that is Spotify, and a now-immortal (and ubiquitous) clip from The Sopranos featuring James Gandolfini belting out one of their early hits. The band is no stranger to the whims of cultural fashion: rightly celebrated by the 1970s’ savviest critics for their acerbic lyrics, musical creativity, and impeccable songwriting chops, by 2001 their Grammy win for the (excellent) comeback album Two Against Nature was met in the wider culture with utter bewilderment. But their newfound (or rediscovered) popularity isn’t due just to their role in a game of 4-D generational chess or the ever-spinning wheel of pop modishness.\n\nThe spirit of Steely Dan’s music—wry and detached, but in the way only a true-blue bruised optimist can be—is one that’s uniquely suited to a certain kind of music listener and kindred spirit today. Its essence is present in nearly all of the discourse around the band, from the winking acknowledgement of encroaching middle age, to the sardonic cultural criticism that runs through their discography, to an awed, almost jealous appreciation of their peerless chops and the lavish perfectionism afforded by a bygone and less-stingy era of the music industry. And to understand how it’s endured for five decades now since their inception in 1971, you have to go back to those beginnings—when they, too, were on the outside, yearning for something more.\n\nBeforeBefore they were Steely Dan, Fagen and the band’s cofounder, Walter Becker, were jazz-loving misfit students at Bard College. As Fagen wrote after Becker’s death in 2017, the two “started writing nutty little tunes on an upright piano in a small sitting room” in the late 1960s, bonding over their shared love of “jazz (from the ’20s through the mid-’60s), W.C. Fields, the Marx Brothers, science fiction, Nabokov, Kurt Vonnegut, Thomas Berger, and Robert Altman films.”\n\nTheir hardcore eclecticism was matched with a penchant for black humor that led Jay and the Americans’ bandleader Jay Black to famously dub them the “Manson and Starkweather of rock ‘n’ roll” during the duo’s pre–Steely Dan stint as members of his touring band. That disposition made them somewhat ill-suited for their original career aspiration, Brill Building songwriters for artists like Barbra Streisand (for whom they did, improbably, land a 1971 album track). So they struck out to the West Coast to form the band’s earliest recording incarnation: one that could handle their complex, razorblade-in-a-candy-apple pop songs.\n\nIt’s a theme that would pop up time and time again through their career: the wheels spinning just a little too fast, the frame of reference just a little too off-kilter, the sheet music just a little too complex to be fully appreciated even at the height of their commercial success. There’s “Reelin’ in the Years,” a bitter kiss-off to youthful expediency mistook for a straightforwardly nostalgic anthem. Or the title track from Aja, which smuggles extended solos from jazz legends Wayne Shorter and Steve Gadd onto a silky-smooth, multiplatinum pop album. The band’s catalog invites so much graduate-level analysis that some obsessive fans insisted that their biggest chart hit, 1974’s “Rikki Don’t Lose That Number,” was a coded primer on how to send marijuana through the mail. (Becker later denied it, asserting the song is as simple of a romantic come-on as it sounds.)\n\n“Something like ‘Bad Sneakers,’ you’re taking a very pop melody but finding these different chords that are modifications of quote-unquote ‘normal’ chords,” says Winston Cook-Wilson, frontman and songwriter for the Dan-influenced New York band Office Culture and host of the Late Era podcast. “They move to different keys, doing this really, really difficult stuff.”\n\nAs the ’70s wore on and they racked up the hits, Steely Dan evolved from the idiosyncratic hitmakers behind radio staples like “Do It Again” and the aforementioned “Reelin’ in the Years” to an increasingly studio-focused project, their songs becoming more and more complex. Eventually, like the Beatles and Brian Wilson before them, the group ditched touring altogether in favor of their quest for studio perfection. That resulted in the two records that now stand alone in their discography, metonymic for their singular combination of smoothness and acidity: 1977’s Aja and 1980’s Gaucho, the last they would record before a hiatus of more than a decade.\n\nWhen Pitchfork turned its critical eye to the band’s discography for a “Steely Dan Day” in 2019, the critic Alex Pappademas described Gaucho as a “pathologically overdetermined … flawless-sounding” record “about breakups and estrangements and encroaching age and the corrosive effects of hard drugs on human fellowship,” “the most Steely Dan of the Steely Dan albums.” It’s the Steely Dan of Gaucho and its predecessor that’s lived in the cultural imagination for decades: first with audiences’ gross misperception of them as peddlers of inoffensive elevator music, and now as the shared fixation of a generation less obsessed with its predecessors’ frequently affected “authenticity” and narrow boundaries of taste.\n\n“A cleaner, smoother aesthetic has seeped into a lot of elements of indie rock and pop; it’s more OK for things to be clean,” says Cook-Wilson. “And then there’s their history with rap, and Kanye sampling them, which preceded all of this—listening to Steely Dan in some sense aesthetically is like listening to DJ Quik [records] from 1997… people caught onto the contrast between their whole vibe and the music itself.”\n\nFor some, that was apparent long before their current resurgence. Gary Daly is the lead singer and co-songwriter for the English new wave band China Crisis, who worked with Becker as a producer and guitarist in the 1980s. Daly described how even in the thick of the art-damaged, authenticity-obsessed ’80s new wave scene, he and his fellow bandmates gravitated toward the Dan.\n\n“Me and Eddie [Lundon, China Crisis co-founder and co-songwriter] were both aware of them as teenagers, we played Aja, and The Royal Scam, and Can’t Buy a Thrill … we thought we were the future, but what we were actually doing was marrying [our] kind of songwriting with the genius of Walter and the ’70s,” Daly says. “That’s why that came about—it had nothing to do with ‘are they cool or not cool anymore,’ it was like, their records are amazing, and Eddie was well aware this was an absolute triumph, putting these two things together.”\n\nIt’s slightly crude, but you could compare what China Crisis did on their stunning, massively underrated, Becker-featuring 1985 gem Flaunt the Imperfection to the most hypermodern form of “putting two things together,” and the one that’s helped bring the band back into the cultural spotlight: the meme.\n\n@inzane_johnny, the influential Instagram meme account from noise veteran John Olson of Wolf Eyes that has more than 100,000 followers, has prominently fused their esoterica to hypermodern meme formats. Grace Spelman, cohost of The Ringer Music Show, started the “People Dancing to Steely Dan” account, which flawlessly mashes up real video of people who were very much not dancing to Steely Dan with the band’s music. A small cult quixotically obsesses over the recovery of “The Second Arrangement,” the hopelessly “lost track” seemingly requisite to any band with such a devoted following.\n\n“When I started the account I had absolutely no idea how far it would go,” says Alex, a Brooklynite in his 30s who operates the beloved “Good Steely Dan Takes” Twitter account. (Alex requested partial anonymity.) From just a few hundred followers at its inception, the account has gone on to earn nearly 25,000 of them and a Rolling Stone interview with its creator.\n\n“The Fagen and Becker worldview, there’s sort of this ironic stance that permeates their music, that for certain circles of Twitter is kind of like a prerequisite,” Alex says. “There are lines of theirs that almost read like tweets … ‘From keyboard man in a rock and ska band, to haulin’ boss crude in the big rigs.’ There’s just a certain similarity to the sensibility of the lyrical approach they took.”\n\nFor someone like Ky Francois of 419 Press, a 24-year-old clothing designer in Portland, Oregon, the appeal is both in sensibility and substance.\n\n“I started collecting vinyl in college, like most people, and a friend’s mom gave me Aja, like, ‘This is something you need in your collection,’” Francois says. “I started looking at the lyrics and the meaning behind them, and I was like, there’s such a polished sound, and they’re talking about just absolute losers, you know? That, to me, was conceptually really interesting; I was like, this is crazy, these guys are geniuses.”\n\nFrancois was so inspired by Aja that he decided to stay after hours at the Portland screenprinting shop where he works and print his very own pair of custom sweatpants emblazoned in garish streetwear-chic neon with its artwork and various lyrics. After a Twitter user reposted Francois’s Instagram post featuring the one-of-one sweats and it went viral, he decided to do three runs of roughly 100 of the sweatpants, all of them selling out within hours.\n\n“I thought I just made something really weird,” Francois says. “It took on a hypewear look, but it was about this music from the ’70s and ’80s … I just thought, ‘OK, I’ve got something really wacky for myself,’ and I didn’t realize how many other young people were interested in it as well.”\n\nWhen young people become interested in the music of the past, it tends to reflect an overall trend in culture. Take, for example, the 2000s-era rehabilitation of Bruce Springsteen. The king of the wall-of-sound, heart-on-your-sleeve anthem was then still largely written off as a schlocky 1980s curio, until similarly earnest songwriters like Conor Oberst and the Arcade Fire’s Win Butler began to name-drop records like his homespun opus Nebraska in interviews. Several years later there was the transformation of Fleetwood Mac from Bill Clinton’s favorite nostalgia act to the totemic predecessors of an increasingly gender-integrated rock world (see: “You Never Knew,” the masterful Tango in the Night homage from L.A. pop-rockers Haim).\n\n“Like, 2016 or ’17, that’s when I started to see this creep into the discourse,” says Cook-Wilson. “Steely Dan sections at record stores—I buy a lot of records—you’d start to see those empty out … it was like in the early 2010s, with a record like [Fleetwood Mac’s] Tusk, these records that Mom and Dad had in their collection you suddenly start to pay attention to.”\n\nSo, again: the generational issue. To understand why the music of Steely Dan, a band so representative of their own generation, resonates so strongly with the descendants with whom they’re supposedly at war, one might start by acknowledging that such frameworks are rarely as simple as they might seem. So when we spoke, I posed the question to Fagen: Is there a line going backward through time that transcends such a simplistic narrative, connecting today’s Dan-obsessed youth, their contemporaneous fans, and even pre-rock hipsters like Jean Shepherd, the radio host and writer beloved by Fagen in his childhood (as memorialized in a 2008 Slate essay)?\n\n“There’s a general sense of humor that comes with a realization that what you were taught in school about American history was wrong,” Fagen says. “There was a language we heard in the media, and in articles in the ’60s, with the space race, and all that kind of stuff, there was a lot of deceit, and I think a lot of the humor was defensive toward what we realized was going on.”\n\n“You hear that with the Beats, Ferlinghetti, and Ginsberg, and what started out as marginal humor, like Jean Shepherd and other people,” he continued. “Now, why has this suddenly become an interest of younger generations? I’m not sure, except that certainly all of that’s just gotten worse.”\n\nIn other words, as long as false optimism, self-delusion, conformism, superficiality, and all of their cousins hold sway in society, there will be Steely Dan People. That is to say, forever.\n\n“Some things that used to seem cool now seem psychotic, and a lot of things that seemed psychotic are accepted,” Fagen says. “It may have started in the Reagan era, but when they started cutting funds for education … it changed the values of people, and they seem to be more gullible than they ever were, and they were plenty gullible when I was a kid.”\n\nAs for the peculiarly modern, extremely online form that the current era of Steely Dan fandom has taken, Fagen says he hasn’t seen much of it. I informed him of the outsized cultural space Aja and Gaucho now occupy, including Francois’s sweatpants, which earned a thoughtful-if-nonplussed grunt. But when I asked his overall thoughts about social media as a cultural engine, however—in his 2013 memoir, Eminent Hipsters, he makes numerous derisive references to the inattentive and ungrateful “TV Babies” that peppered his concert audiences—he expressed concern for the hearts and minds of the next generation of fellow-traveling, wary outsiders.\n\n“When I was a kid, I didn’t have a lot of friends, so I was alone a lot, and I had my own interests, which were not the interests of many of my peers,” Fagen says. “Now it seems like everything is decided, whether through trolling, or stuff that’s promoted, through a madness of crowds. I think people need to be more alone, and to turn off their phone, and resign from their social media platforms, or else you don’t really find out who you are. You can’t really do it when you’re surrounded by other people.”\n\nThe ethos Fagen cultivated over all those years is best captured by one of their signature songs, whose lyrics have been immortalized maybe more than any in their discography: 1977’s “Deacon Blues,” a semi-autobiographical tale of a sad sack with similar inclinations to Becker and Fagen but who never quite hit it big. In 2015, the duo broke down the song’s origin for The Wall Street Journal:\n\n“The protagonist in ‘Deacon Blues’ is a triple-L loser—an L-L-L Loser,” Becker said. “It’s not so much about a guy who achieves his dream but about a broken dream of a broken man living a broken life. … A mystical thing takes place and he’s suddenly aware of his surroundings and life, and starts thinking about his options. The ‘fine line’ we use in the song … is the dividing line between being a loser and winner, at least according to his own code. He’s obviously tried to cross it before, without success.”\n\n“Say a guy is living at home at his parents’ house in suburbia,” Fagen told the WSJ. “One day, when he’s 31, he wakes up and decides he wants to change the way he struts his stuff.”\n\nIf you’re the kind of person who’s read this far into a feature about Steely Dan, you probably know that the “fine line” between a wisecracking, gimlet-eyed social critic and the morose would-have-been of “Deacon Blues” is just one shot of the scotch whiskey invoked in the song’s chorus. The enduring character of Steely Dan’s music that’s allowed it to outlast the cultural small-mindedness that once put them out of fashion, uniting everyone including, as one Twitter user put it, “trans girls and boomer dads” in shared affection, is thus: The deck is stacked against the sensitive and yearning in this world, and like a doomed member of a Coen brothers ensemble, they’re more likely than not to meet an ignominious end.\n\nBut to face that reality, absent the gullibility and deceit Fagen described to me, is its own reward (perhaps, obviously, by way of inspiring an anti-hero’s ballad as pitch-black as “Deacon Blues”).\n\n“They were an unidealistic band at the end of a very idealistic period,” says the critic Carola Dibbell. “That unidealistic quality probably appeals to their young fans today.”\n\nA point well taken. But “idealism” is decidedly different from having “ideals.” And if Steely Dan’s music was free of such things, it wouldn’t have the unexpected emotional resonance that pops up on something like “Any Major Dude Will Tell You,” one of their greatest songs and a rare, revealing flip side to the pity party of “Deacon Blues”:\n\nHave you ever seen a squonk’s tears? Well, look at mine\n\nThe people on the street have all seen better times\n\nAny major dude with half a heart surely will tell you, my friend\n\nAny minor world that breaks apart falls together again\n\nIt’s all there: the obscure literary references, the jazz lingo, the insight to see the world’s flaws and the muted optimism to endure it anyway. Brushing aside the tweets, the irony, Tony Soprano, et al., it’s very easy to see why such a sentiment would ring true with a generation desperate for a guiding ethos in a chaotic time. As Good Steely Dan Takes once tweeted, the band “holds up better in 2020 than it did in the ’70s. We are all suburban losers dreaming of something meaningful now.”\n\n“On one hand, it’s terrible, terrible music,” Fagen says with his characteristic wryness. “But on the other hand, the combination of the music, and the lyrics, the contrast, there’s something Brechtian about the whole project that I think is hopefully valuable.”\n\nThe comparison is apt. In a thoroughly irony-poisoned era, one can imagine the overweening saxophone solos, the crooning background singers, the purposely off-putting lyrical references, as almost necessarily provocative for younger listeners to latch on and discover the songs’ core social critique and big-heartedness.\n\nPlenty of Steely Dan’s contemporaries attempted to deliver both, but none of them matched their sui generis, effortless cool. (As their most famous younger fan once put it: “When you try hard, that’s when you die hard.”) The Beats, Brecht, and cryptids aside, Becker and Fagen conjured that through the only real form of cross-demographic communication—simply being themselves.\n\n“These waves have come of affection and loathing over the years. During the punk era, we took a lot of hits, saying we’re only interested in technique, or perfection, or stuff like that,” Fagen says.\n\n“I think they thought we were the Stan Kenton of the time,” he continues, referring to the mid-century big-band leader derided by hardcore jazz fans for an empty, pompous virtuosity. “But we never felt that at all. I just thought we were making something beautiful.”\n\nSteely Dan The Royal Scam (1976)\n\nFrom pitchfork.com\n\nFor decades after their initial discovery in 1868, scholars dismissed the Paleolithic cave paintings of Altamira, located in the north of Spain, as forgeries.
