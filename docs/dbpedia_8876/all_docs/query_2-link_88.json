        "text": "In 1980s, Jon Herington played with Indiana Avenue greats\n\nBefore Jon Herington was hired by Steely Dan to play iconic solos associated with \"Reelin' in the Years\" and \"Peg,\" the guitarist worked on his craft in Indiana.\n\nNew Jersey native Herington moved to Indianapolis in the early 1980s, when he said he put music on the back burner for \"a woman, naturally. I thought I’d be looking in the Sunday paper for a writing job or something.\"\n\nInstead, he fell in with musicians such as saxophone player Pookie Johnson and keyboard player Steve Allee. Herington found gigs with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and Gaither Studios (known then as Pinebrook) in Alexandria.\n\n\"It was just a fabulous growth time for me,\" Herington said during a phone interview. \"It’s funny to think that I had to risk sort of giving it all up in order to find this perfect place for me for several years.\"\n\nHerington, who will perform tonight with Steely Dan at Klipsch Music Center, recalls catching jazz performances at the Place to Start, a venue that preceded the Jazz Kitchen at 5377 N. College Ave. The roster of players included Indiana Avenue pioneers Johnson and drummer \"Killer\" Ray Appleton.\n\n\"I met a serious first string of top-notch musicians right away,\" he said. \"They were extremely welcoming.\"\n\nIn Bloomington, Herington played in a band spearheaded by Kenny Aronoff, the famed drummer who was reaching commercial heights with John Mellencamp at the time.\n\n\"He would take gigs just to increase his musical range,\" Herington said of Aronoff. \"This was the early MTV days. We had sort of a dance band.\"\n\nThe band was known as Kix, not to be confused with a hair-metal band of the same name. In addition to Aronoff and Herington, Kix featured trumpet player Chris Botti, bass player Robert Hurst and keyboard player Jim Beard. Herington and Beard are band mates once again in Steely Dan.\n\n'Adult' activity: Herington, who closed the Indiana chapter of his life in 1984, issued a solo album titled \"Adult Entertainment\" in June. A sort of encyclopedia of pop-rock styles from the 1960s and early '70s, \"Adult Entertainment\" is varied by design, Herington said. \"You could have a Motown tune, you could have a hardcore old blues tune, you could have a country tune,\" he said of the era. \"All on the same record, back to back, and nobody flinched. It was a freer time for programmers on the radio, so much less formulaic.\"\n\nSteely studio: In addition to playing live dates with Steely Dan since 1999, Herington appears on studio recordings \"Two Against Nature\" (2000) and \"Everything Must Go\" (2003). He said Steely Dan founders Donald Fagen and Walter Becker are reasonable sticklers when making albums. \"They’re famous for being inordinately fussy,\" said Herington, who also played on two Fagen solo albums and one Becker effort. \"Maybe some musicians have felt that way. In all my work with them in the studio, I felt like they were appropriately fussy -- with maybe an occasional exception. They were concerned with the same things I’m concerned with. I want it to be great. I want it to sound great, to feel great.\"\n\nAmusing dudes: Fagen and Becker, who met at Upstate New York's Bard College in 1967, are known for a deadpan sense of humor. Herington confirms the duo is funny offstage. \"They share this unbelievable depth of pop-culture knowledge,\" he said. \"When the two of them get going, and they do this friendly one-upmanship with the jokes, everybody else basically stops and listens. Nobody tries to compete.\"\n\nThen and now: When playing solos with Steely Dan, Herington is following the work of high-profile players such as Larry Carlton and Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter who contributed to the band's classic 1970s recordings. He said he strives for a balance between what's heard daily on the radio and offering his own sonic touches. \"I love the work they did,\" Herington said. \"I love the choices they made of guitar players, of the solos they selected to put on the records. I want to honor it.\" At the same time, Fagen and Becker don't intend concerts to be replications of the albums. Herington said he thinks about the best quality of an original solo and decides to build on particular notes or tone or attitude when playing live. \"I can’t imagine starting 'Reelin’ in the Years' without quoting the melody like Elliott Randall did on the intro,\" Herington said. \"I try to get a sound that’s similar. Who could resist? When you hear that, all those neurons start to fire.\"\n\nSteely Dan\n\n>> WHEN: 7 p.m. July 15.\n\n>> WHERE: Klipsch Music Center, 12880 E. 146th St., Noblesville.\n\n>> TICKETS: $29 to $124.\n\n>> INFO: Visit LiveNation.com or call (800) 745-3000."
