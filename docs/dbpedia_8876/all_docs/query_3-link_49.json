        "text": "The ‘70s just wouldn’t have been the same without Steely Dan. With hits like \"Reeling in the Years,\" \"Rikki Don't Lose That Number,\" \"Peg,\" “Deacon Blues,” “Babylon Sisters,” and “Hey Nineteen,” the jazz rock icons helped define not only a musical genre but the era itself.\n\nThough Steely Dan disbanded in the early ‘80s, their catalog of platinum-selling albums recorded throughout the previous decade sustained a loyal and devoted fan base who relished any further musical offerings from the group’s co-founders Walter Becker and Donald Fagen.\n\nIn 1993, the pair reunited and began touring, releasing the Alive in America live album in 1995. In 2000, with a new generation of Steely Dan fans emerging, the band dropped their first studio album in two decades, Two Against Nature. Winning four Grammy awards the album became another huge success for Steely Dan, selling over a million copies in the US alone.\n\nContinuing Steely Dan’s storied career, on September 24 the band plan to release their first live album in 25 years – Northeast Corridor: Steely Dan Live! – in tandem with Donald Fagen’s The Nightfly Live (a live version of Fagen’s platinum-selling classic from 1982.)\n\nBoth albums are available to pre-order now. As a special bonus, those who pre-order Northeast Corridor: Steely Dan Live! will instantly receive a digital download of “Reeling in The Years.” Similarly, those who pre-order The Nightfly Live will instantly receive a digital download of “I.G.Y.”\n\nYou can pre-order Northeast Corridor: Steely Dan Live! here and The Nightfly Live here.\n\nAdditionally, Northeast Corridor: Steely Dan Live! and The Nightfly Live will be available on 180g-vinyl from October 1."
