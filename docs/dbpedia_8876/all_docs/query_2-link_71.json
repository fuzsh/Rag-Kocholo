        "text": "Steely Dan co-founder Walter Becker passed away over a week ago, giving fans the impression that the jazz rock band would cease touring. On the afternoon that the news of Becker’s passing broke, fellow bandmate and co-founder Donald Fagen wrote a touching tribute that promised to “keep the music we created together alive as long as I can with the Steely Dan band.” Today, Steely Dan has announced eight shows this Fall, moving forward without Becker. While the tour marks the first since Becker’s death, it is not the first time Steely Dan performed without him. Becker’s health complicated him from performing Steely Dan’s Classic East and Classic West concerts earlier this year. His final performance with Steely Dan was on May 27, 2017.\n\nDonald Fagen Pens Touching Tribute To Steely Dan Guitarist Walter Becker\n\nSteely Dan will begin their tour on October 13th in Thackerville Oklahoma, then head to Grand Rapids, MI, Buffalo, NY, Orillia, ON, Windsor, ON, Wallingfor, CT, and Baltimore, MD before concluding their North American run in National Harbor, MD.\n\nSteely Dan // 2017 Tour Dates"
