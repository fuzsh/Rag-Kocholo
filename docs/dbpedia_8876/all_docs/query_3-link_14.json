        "text": "Steely Dan Timeline\n\nFor an expanded history, see the FAQ\n\nDonald Fagen and Walter Becker, erstwhile students at Bard College, discover common interests in jazz, blues, popular music and contemporary literature, particularly so-called Black Humor. They begin collaborating on songs which they perform in various pickup bands.\n\nFagen and Becker attempt to peddle their songs door to door in the famous Brill Building, home to many if not most of the schlock music publishers of the day. They are eventually signed to a publishing deal by a small company owned by 60's group Jay and the Americans, who are enjoying a brief revival of their popularity due to their hit remake of the Drifters' \"This Magic Moment\".\n\nFagen and Becker join the Jay and the Americans' touring band\n\nOn the recommendation of staff producer Gary Katz, the partners are signed as staff songwriters by Jay Lasker, president of ABC/Dunhill Records in Los Angeles. They move to Los Angeles where they are given a small office-with-piano in which to grind out the hits. A desk drawer in the office still contains the brown bag lunches of the previous song-writing team to use the office. The team interprets this touching detail as a symbol of the impermanence of success in the pop music scene. They proceed to write a series of classic but unrecordable cheesy pop songs, while secretly planning to assemble their own band and record their own album.\n\nAfter rehearsing after hours in the unfinished new wing of ABC Records office, the intrepid little band hits the studio and records their first album. The album, entitled \"Can't Buy A Thrill\", is released under the name \"Steely Dan\", which has been unceremoniously lifted from William Burroughs' novel, \"Naked Lunch\". The charter members are: Denny Dias (Guitar), Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter (guitar), Jim Hodder (drums) and David Palmer (vocals).\n\nThe band in various configurations tours the U.S. and Britain. Two more albums are released: \"Countdown To Ecstasy\"and \"Pretzel Logic\". Donald is now singing all the lead vocals and Walter has begun playing guitar leads. The final touring configuration includes Mike McDonald (vocals and piano), Jeff Porcaro (drums) and Royce Jones (percussion and vocals).\n\nBecker and Fagen disband the original group and begin to record entirely with various session players. The results include a series of acclaimed albums including: \"Katy Lied\", \"The Royal Scam\", \"Aja\", and \"Gaucho\".\n\nBecker and Fagen go their separate ways. Fagen records his first solo album, \" The Nightfly\", which is a huge critical and commercial success. Becker moves to Hawaii and becomes a gentleman avocado rancher and self styled critic of the contemporary scene.\n\n: Fagen pens tunes for artists including Diana Ross, Manhattan Transfer, Jennifer Warnes and Yellowjackets. He co-produces the soundtrack album for Bob Telson's musical \"The Gospel At Colonus\", and composes the score for the film, \"Bright Lights, Big City\". He also writes a column for Premiere Magazine. Becker produces albums for China Crisis, Rickie Lee Jones, and various jazz artists, including Bob Sheppard, John Beasley, Jeff Beale, Andy Laverne, Marty Krystall, The Lost Tribe, Dave Kikoski, and LeeAnn Ledgerwood.\n\nFagen and producer Libby Titus (\"The Mistress of Rock'n'Soul\") develop the New York Rock and Soul Revue, which culminates in the recording, \"NYR&S Live at the Beacon Theatre\". Sessions begin for Fagen's second solo album, \"Kamakiriad\", with Becker producing. Becker also joins the revue for their Summer '92 Tour.\n\nAs \"Kamakiriad\" sales climb towards platinum and beyond, Fagen and Becker hit the road with The All New Steely Dan Orchestra '93. Becker begins work on his first solo CD, \"11 Tracks of Whack\" with Fagen producing. A Boxed set entitled \"Citizen Steely Dan\" is due out for Christmas.\n\nIn May the group tours Japan. Becker's solo \"11 Tracks of Whack\" is released following the successful summer tour by the Citizen Steely Dan Orchestra '94.\n\n\"Alive in America\", an album of live performances from 93-94 is released. Fagen and Becker begin writing for a new album.\n\nThe Official Steely Dan Website goes online in March. The Art Crimes Orchestra tours the U.S., Europe, and Japan.\n\nWork on Steely Dan's first studio album in 20 years proceeds apace through 1999.\n\n\"Two Against Nature\" is released on Feb. 29 and debuts at #6 on Billboard's Top 200. Donald and Walter receive ASCAP's Founder's Award in May. Summer sees the Steely Dan 2K World Tour of Japan, North America, and Europe.\n\nIn February, \"Two Against Nature\" wins four Grammy Awards, including Album Of The Year. Becker and Fagen are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March. In May, Becker and Fagen receive honorary Doctor of Music degrees from The Berklee College of Music. Recording for a new album begins in in the fall.\n\n\"Everything Must Go\" is released in June, and the EMG Tour of North America runs from July 23 to October 11.\n\nIn support of solo projects, both Walter and Donald launch their own websites. Donald releases \"Morph The Cat\", his third solo CD in March, and Walter continues recording his second solo CD. The \"Steelyard 'Sugartooth' McDan (and the Fab-Originees.com)\" summer tour of the U.S. runs from July to September.\n\nThe Heavy Rollers World Tour plays the U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. Fagen releases the Nightfly Trilogy Boxed Set.\n\nBecker releases \"Circus Money\", his second solo CD, on June 10. Live \"Think Fast, Steely Dan\" dates for summer 2008 are announced.\n\nBecker and Fagen go on the road again in Europe and the U.S.\n\nIn 2011, Donald and Walter conduct some Shuffle Diplomacy with 'The Miles High Big Band' and featuring 'The Embassy Brats'. For the Australia and New Zealand leg, the legendary Steve Winwood makes it a double-bill in made in muso heaven.\n\nDonald, Walter, and Company find themselves \"8 Miles To Pancake Day\" as the Mood Swings 2013 Tour begins in mid-July. The popular Album Nights are reprised in several cities.\n\nIt's no fairy tale when Donald, Walter, and their now-legendary group of supporting musicians swing through North America on their Jamalot Ever After Tour July 2 - Sept 17.\n\nThe SD touring juggernaut goes out a little early in 2015, as the Rockabye Gollie Angel Tour makes a short swing westward, bracketing two shows at 2015's Coachella Festival in April. Then the tour explodes into the summer as Elvis Costello and the Imposters joins the bill for 22 North American dates July 6 - Aug 12.\n\n...with time marching on from here best summarized by the Steely Dan News Page"
