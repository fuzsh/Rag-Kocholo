        "text": "-------------------------------------------------------------------- Stephen Holden writes frequently about popular music and is the author of ''Triple Platinum,'' a novel about the record business. By STEPHEN HOLDEN\n\nNearly three years in the making, Steely Dan's ''Gaucho'' (MCA-6102) is as refined as pop music can get without becoming too esoteric for a mass audience. Though it consists of only two men, Steely Dan must be counted one of the most influential rock ''groups'' of the past decade.\n\nFounded by the songwriting team of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen eight years ago, they started out as a touring sextet. With Mr. Becker, the lead vocalist and bassist, and Mr. Fagen on keyboards, the group had a string of hits including ''Do It Again,'' ''Reeling in the Years,'' and ''Rikki Don't Lose That Number.''\n\nAfter 1974, they stopped performing and made the recording studio their artistic base, using a shifting array of session musicians instead of fixed personnel. Over the course of seven albums, they've evolved an unusually subtle and literate brand of pop-rock that blends modal jazz harmonies, fusion instrumentation and funk-tinged polyrhythms within extended pop structures.\n\nThough other rock groups like Blood, Sweat & Tears and Chicago have enjoyed commercial success blending jazz and pop, none has come close to matching Steely Dan in sophistication and taste. They helped inspire rock singers like Joni Mitchell to explore jazz and paved the way for the Doobie Brothers' brand of pop-funk. Even stylistically unrelated groups like the Eagles were influenced by Steely Dan's carefully blocked arranging style.\n\nBut more than their studio craftsmanship, what distinguishes Steely Dan is their songwriting. Mr. Becker's and Mr. Fagen's specialty is the cryptically sardonic vignette. ''Gaucho's'' seven extended studio set pieces are also interrelated short stories. The main characters are would-be hipsters who define themselves in terms of style rather than feelings or ideas.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
