        "text": "Donald Fagen (born January 10, 1948, Passaic, New Jersey, U.S.) is an American musician and singer-songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist and keyboardist of the rock band Steely Dan. Fagen founded Steely Dan with guitarist and bassist Walter Becker in the early 1970s; the group quickly became popular, with their unique synthesis of harmonies from jazz, funk, soul, and rock and the rich complexity of their song lyrics.\n\nFagen was born into a Jewish family, his father an accountant and his mother a housewife. His mother—having been a singer in her youth, traveling regularly to upstate New York to perform until her teens—was familiar with singing technique and was influential in Fagen’s early exposure to music. When Fagen was eight years old, his family moved from Passaic, New Jersey, located just outside Manhattan, to the surrounding suburbs, alienating him from his extended family and deeply affecting his view of himself and his parents. In the years that followed, he increasingly read books and listened to music, initially interested in rock and pop but soon taking an interest in jazz, having been introduced to the genre by a cousin. While in high school, Fagen learned to play the piano and joined a jazz trio. In 1965, after graduating from high school, he went to Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, where he studied English literature and in 1967 met Becker. The two friends played together in various bands and began writing original material together.\n\nIn 1969, having completed his studies at Bard, Fagen moved to Brooklyn, where he and Becker toured as backing musicians and worked on a movie soundtrack. Shortly thereafter the duo relocated to Los Angeles to work as songwriters for ABC/Dunhill Records and, with guitarists Jeff Baxter and Denny Dias, formed Steely Dan. The group released its first album, Can’t Buy a Thrill, in 1972. While touring to promote the album, Fagen, who had been reluctant to sing in live performances, took over as lead vocalist, and the band hastily recorded their second album, Countdown to Ecstasy, released in 1973. Fagen and Becker were displeased with the quality of the album, and the following year—after the group’s third release, Pretzel Logic—various members were fired or left, leaving Fagen and Becker to focus on studio work.\n\nHowever, Steely Dan reached a new level of fame with Pretzel Logic, owing in particular to “Rikki Don’t Lose That Number,” ultimately the band’s greatest hit single, written by Fagen and Becker. With a more accomplished group of musicians, Steely Dan went on a second tour. Worn from the uncompromising pressure of touring, the band took a break from live performances, and Fagen resumed focus on studio recording. Fagen and Becker surrounded themselves with a new group of musicians, which included several renowned jazz musicians, to record their increasingly intricate jazz-infused tracks. Their efforts culminated in the release of Aja (1977), which climbed to number three on Billboard’s Top 200 albums chart. In 1981, a year after the release of Gaucho, Steely Dan took a break; Becker relocated to Hawaii and Fagen to New York.\n\nFagen subsequently launched a solo career, marked by the release of the critically acclaimed album Nightfly (1982). Through the mid- and late 1980s, he worked on soundtracks and was a magazine writer. During this time he reunited with Becker to work with model and singer Rosie Vela on her debut album, Zazu (1986), and the duo considered writing new material for Steely Dan but abandoned the idea. In the early 1990s Fagen and Becker supported one another in their solo careers, helping to produce each other’s albums. With Becker’s assistance, Fagen released Kamakiriad (1993), which captured Fagen’s intuitive synthesis of jazz and rock. Shortly thereafter Fagen and Becker resumed touring as Steely Dan, releasing a live album in 1995 and producing the band’s first album of new material in two decades, Two Against Nature (2000), which earned a Grammy Award for album of the year (2001)."
