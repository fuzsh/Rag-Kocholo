        "text": "Walter Becker, an influential guitarist, songwriter and producer best known as co-founder of GRAMMY winners Steely Dan, has died according to a news post on his official website. No cause of death has been revealed. Becker was 67 years old.\n\nThe New York-born Becker — adept at both electric guitar and bass — met his future Steely Dan partner/collaborator Donald Fagen in 1967 while attending Bard College. The duo later moved to California and undertook work as staff songwriters, placing songs such as \"I Mean To Shine\" on Barbra Streisand's 1971 album, Barbra Joan Streisand.\n\nIn 1972 Steely Dan released their debut album, Can't Buy A Thrill, which spawned the hits \"Do It Again\" and \"Reelin' In The Years.\" Known for their sophisticated songwriting and arrangements, Steely Dan landed a string of subsequent hit albums, including 1974's Pretzel Logic (No. 8), 1977's Aja (No. 3) and 1980's Gaucho (No. 9).\n\nBecker and Fagen engaged the services of a variety of talented musicians on their recordings, which added a unique layer of musical depth to Steely Dan's sound. Musicians who appeared on their albums included Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter and Larry Carlton (guitar), Steve Gadd and Jeff Porcaro (drums), Michael McDonald (vocals), and Wayne Shorter (saxophone).\n\nAja featured the jazz-inflected hits \"Peg\" and \"Deacon Blues,\" while Gaucho spawned the now-classic \"Hey Nineteen.\" Both albums earned Album Of The Year nominations at 20th GRAMMY Awards and 24th GRAMMY Awards, respectively. Aja was inducted into the GRAMMY Hall Of Fame in 2003.\n\nFollowing Gaucho, Steely Dan went on a lengthy recording hiatus. During that time, Becker worked as a record producer, helming albums for artists such as Rickie Lee Jones and Michael Franks and Fagen. In 1994 Becker released his debut solo album, 11 Tracks Of Whack, which was produced by Fagen.\n\nBecker and Fagen reconvened Steely Dan in the studio for 2000's Two Against Nature, their first album in 20 years. The album proved to be arguably their biggest success, hitting No. 6 on the Billboard 200 and winning four GRAMMY Awards, including Album Of The Year and Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal for \"Cousin Dupree.\"\n\nIn 2001 Steely Dan were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Two years later, Fagen and Becker recorded what would be the final Steely Dan studio album, Everything Must Go. The album featured \"Slang Of Ages,\" a track on which Becker made his lead vocal debut. In 2008 Becker released his second solo album, Circus Money.\n\nSteely Dan continued to tour in recent years. In 2017 they played live at Classic West and Classic East, two festival-style concerts that featured Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Journey, and the Doobie Brothers. However, Becker was unable to perform at either concert due to an undisclosed illness.\n\n'Walter Becker was my friend, my writing partner and my bandmate since we met as students at Bard College in 1967,\" Fagen wrote in a statement. \"I intend to keep the music we created together alive as long as I can with the Steely Dan band.\"\n\nGRAMMY Winner Shelley Berman Dies\n\nUpdated Friday Oct. 13, 2023 to include info about Kendrick Lamar's most recent GRAMMY wins, as of the 2023 GRAMMYs.\n\nA GRAMMY veteran these days, Kendrick Lamar has won 17 GRAMMYs and has received 47 GRAMMY nominations overall. A sizable chunk of his trophies came from the 58th annual GRAMMY Awards in 2016, when he walked away with five — including his first-ever win in the Best Rap Album category.\n\nThis installment of GRAMMY Rewind turns back the clock to 2016, revisiting Lamar's acceptance speech upon winning Best Rap Album for To Pimp A Butterfly. Though Lamar was alone on stage, he made it clear that he wouldn't be at the top of his game without the help of a broad support system.\n\n\"First off, all glory to God, that's for sure,\" he said, kicking off a speech that went on to thank his parents, who he described as his \"those who gave me the responsibility of knowing, of accepting the good with the bad.\"\n\nLooking for more GRAMMYs news? The 2024 GRAMMY nominations are here!\n\nHe also extended his love and gratitude to his fiancée, Whitney Alford, and shouted out his Top Dawg Entertainment labelmates. Lamar specifically praised Top Dawg's CEO, Anthony Tiffith, for finding and developing raw talent that might not otherwise get the chance to pursue their musical dreams.\n\n\"We'd never forget that: Taking these kids out of the projects, out of Compton, and putting them right here on this stage, to be the best that they can be,\" Lamar — a Compton native himself — continued, leading into an impassioned conclusion spotlighting some of the cornerstone rap albums that came before To Pimp a Butterfly.\n\n\"Hip-hop. Ice Cube. This is for hip-hop,\" he said. \"This is for Snoop Dogg, Doggystyle. This is for Illmatic, this is for Nas. We will live forever. Believe that.\"\n\nTo Pimp a Butterfly singles \"Alright\" and \"These Walls\" earned Lamar three more GRAMMYs that night, the former winning Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song and the latter taking Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (the song features Bilal, Anna Wise and Thundercat). He also won Best Music Video for the remix of Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood.\"\n\nLamar has since won Best Rap Album two more times, taking home the golden gramophone in 2018 for his blockbuster LP DAMN., and in 2023 for his bold fifth album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.\n\nWatch Lamar's full acceptance speech above, and check back at GRAMMY.com every Friday for more GRAMMY Rewind episodes.\n\n10 Essential Facts To Know About GRAMMY-Winning Rapper J. Cole\n\nAmong serious music fans, it's a common rite of passage to realize there's a lot more to Steely Dan than meets the eye. And a lot of that is biting, sardonic wit.\n\nIf you think Donald Fagen and Walter Becker's three-time GRAMMY-winning partnership is just the stuff of smoothed-over yacht rock, you could have a change of heart: Dan bangers from \"Deacon Blues\" to \"Don't Take Me Alive\" to \"Hey Nineteen\" are full of pitch-black character studies, acidic turns of phrase, and one-liners that may singe your eyebrows.\n\nSure, this component of the group is key to their conceptual essence. But in your dance with the Dan, take the next step: If you took away all the sarcasm, all the seediness, all the salt, Steely Dan would still be one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Because their musical sophistication was second to none.\n\nFor decades, connotations of soft-rock yuppiedom have calcified around Steely Dan; The Onion once summed it up with an article headlined \"Donald Fagen Defends Steely Dan To Friends.\" But not only do they barely resemble yacht rock on any level; their compositions and playing were of a stunning level of sophistication. It's no accident that unquestionable musical godheads Wayne Shorter, Bernard Purdie and the Brecker brothers played with them.\n\nSteely Dan is a tangled web indeed, and a new book illuminates every nook and cranny of their legend. Journalist Alex Pappademas and visual artist Joan LeMay's Quantum Criminals, arrived in May and pulls apart the Steely Dan myth like Russian nesting dolls.\n\n\"We're all looking out at the world with a Donald and Walter-ish kind of dismay. So they make a lot more sense now,\" Pappademas recently told Rolling Stone. What seemed cold and remote and jerky about them back in the day — now, that's just the way people talk. They're also also writing apocalyptically about their time, and our time now seems so unavoidably apocalyptic.\n\nIn the same interview, Pappademas cited the final album of their original run, 1980's Gaucho. \"Gaucho is the ultimate one because it's the slickest,\" he said, mentioning an ultra-complex drum machine they built to remove any vestige of humanity. \"Eventually, the solution is, 'We're going to invent sampling so that we can reduce the amount of human error.'\"\n\nOf course, Steely Dan didn't literally invent sampling. But the comment at least tacitly bridges two worlds few know are bridged: Steely Dan and hip-hop. As Pappademas put it in the book — albeit in the context of a contentious royalties agreement — “Even if nothing about Steely Dan was hip-hop, everything about them was hip-hop… they were about that cash.”\n\nAccording to WhoSampled, the Dan have been sampled 152 times; in a number of cases, those samples were in rap songs. Pappademas acknowledges this component of the Dan's legacy in the chapter \"Peter/Tariq/Daniel\" in Quantum Criminals.\n\nIn tandem with Quantum Criminals, let the following list of Dan-sampling rap songs elucidate this misunderstood band for neophytes: they were not only gritty lyrically, but conducive to musical grit.\n\nDe La Soul - \"Eye Know\" (1989)\n\nWhen the world learned of the pioneering saxophonist and composer Wayne Shorter's death on March 2, it did so partly through a quote from the maestro itself: \"It's time to go get a new body and come back to continue the mission.\"\n\nThis evocation of reincarnation not only speaks to Shorter's elaborate psychospiritual universe — he followed Nichiren Buddhism for half a century — but his multitudes as an artistic behemoth. In his 89-year life, Shorter irrevocably altered so many sectors of jazz and related forms that he seemed to inhabit many bodies at once.\n\nTo trace the 12-time GRAMMY winner's artistic evolution is to tell the story of the music as it evolved and propagated through the latter half of the 20th century. He was a member of two of the most crucial groups in jazz history: the brilliant, hotheaded drummer Art Blakey's unofficial jazz academy the Jazz Messengers and Miles Davis' so-called Second Great Quintet.\n\nBut even that's just the tip of the iceberg. After an astonishing run of leader albums on Blue Note — including all-timers like JuJu, Speak No Evil and The All Seeing Eye — Shorter formed Weather Report, a fundamental group in '70s and '80s jazz fusion. Along the way, he also collaborated with AOR legends — Joni Mitchell on a slew of mid-period records, and on the title track to Aja, Steely Dan.\n\nIn the 21st century, he continued hurtling forward as a composer, and work only seemed to grow more eclectic and multifarious, arguably culminating with (Iphigenia), an expansive opera co-created with bassist and vocalist Esperanza Spalding. At the 2023 GRAMMYs, he won Best Improvised Jazz Solo alongside pianist Leo Genovese for \"Endangered Species,\" a cut on Live at the Detroit Jazz Festival, which also features Spalding and drummer Terri Lyne Carrington.\n\nIn 2015, the Recording Academy bestowed upon him a Lifetime Achievement Award. \"Wayne Shorter's influence on the jazz community has left an indelible mark on the music industry,\" Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy, said in part. \"It's been a privilege to celebrate his contributions to our culture throughout his incredible career.\"\n\nAs bandleader Darcy James Argue put it, \"There isn't a jazz composer today who does not owe an absolutely immeasurable debt to Wayne Shorter. Whether you assimilated his harmonic language, or consciously rejected it, or tried to thread a path somewhere in between, his influence is as unavoidable as the elements.\"\n\nBut with this vast cosmology established, how can Shorter neophytes find their own way in? To traverse the universe of the self-dubbed Mr. Weird — from a line about person or thing X being “as weird as Wayne” — one need not enter it at random.\n\nArguably, the gateway is Shorter's aforementioned '60s run as a leader; from there, one can venture out in a dozen directions and be rewarded with a lifetime of cerebrality and majesty.\n\nSo, for those looking for a way in, here are seven essential tracks from that specific period and component of Shorter's culture-quaking legacy.\n\n\"Night Dreamer\" (Night Dreamer, 1964)\n\nIt's rare that a genre can be traced back to a single artist or group, but for funk, that was James Brown. The Godfather of Soul coined the phrase and style of playing known as \"on the one,\" where the first downbeat is emphasized, instead of the typical second and fourth beats in pop, soul and other styles. As David Cheal eloquently explains, playing on the one \"left space for phrases and riffs, often syncopated around the beat, creating an intricate, interlocking grid which could go on and on.\" You know a funky bassline when you hear it; its fat chords beg your body to get up and groove.\n\nBrown's 1965 classic, \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,\" became one of the first funk hits, and has been endlessly sampled and covered over the years, along with his other groovy tracks. Of course, many other funk acts followed in the '60s, and the genre thrived in the '70s and '80s as the disco craze came and went, and the originators of hip-hop and house music created new music from funk and disco's strong, flexible bones built for dancing.\n\nLegendary funk bassist Bootsy Collins learned the power of the one from playing in Brown's band, and brought it to George Clinton, who created P-funk, an expansive, Afrofuturistic, psychedelic exploration of funk with his various bands and projects, including Parliament-Funkadelic. Both Collins and Clinton remain active and funkin', and have offered their timeless grooves to collabs with younger artists, including Kali Uchis, Silk Sonic, and Omar Apollo; and Kendrick Lamar, Flying Lotus, and Thundercat, respectively.\n\nIn the 1980s, electro-funk was born when artists like Afrika Bambaataa, Man Parrish, and Egyptian Lover began making futuristic beats with the Roland TR-808 drum machine — often with robotic vocals distorted through a talk box. A key distinguishing factor of electro-funk is a de-emphasis on vocals, with more phrases than choruses and verses. The sound influenced contemporaneous hip-hop, funk and electronica, along with acts around the globe, while current acts like Chromeo, DJ Stingray, and even Egyptian Lover himself keep electro-funk alive and well.\n\nToday, funk lives in many places, with its heavy bass and syncopated grooves finding way into many nooks and crannies of music. There's nu-disco and boogie funk, nodding back to disco bands with soaring vocals and dance floor-designed instrumentation. G-funk continues to influence Los Angeles hip-hop, with innovative artists like Dam-Funk and Channel Tres bringing the funk and G-funk, into electro territory. Funk and disco-centered '70s revival is definitely having a moment, with acts like Ghost Funk Orchestra and Parcels, while its sparkly sprinklings can be heard in pop from Dua Lipa, Doja Cat, and, in full \"Soul Train\" character, Silk Sonic. There are also acts making dreamy, atmospheric music with a solid dose of funk, such as Khruangbin’s global sonic collage."
