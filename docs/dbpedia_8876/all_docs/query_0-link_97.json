        "text": "Following Steely Dan guitarist and co-founder Walter Becker‘s death earlier this month, the band’s lead singer and keyboardist Donald Fagen vowed in an open letter to “keep the music we created together alive as long as I can with the Steely Dan band.” He’ll honor that commitment next month, as the group will embark on an eight-show North American tour.\n\nThe modest trek spans two weeks in October, kicking off in Thackerville, Oklahoma, on Oct. 13 and wrapping up in National Harbor, Maryland, on Oct. 25. The tour marks Steely Dan’s first performances since July’s Classic East and Classic West festivals in New York and Los Angeles, respectively. Becker missed those shows due to an unspecified illness; he last played with the group on May 27, 2017.\n\nFagen, meanwhile, should be warmed up for the brief jaunt, as he’s currently playing several Steely Dan classics out on the road with his solo band, the Nightflyers.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nCheck out the tour dates below.\n\nSteely Dan Fall Tour Dates"
