        "text": "Keyboardist Jim Beard, who spent more than a decade playing for rock group Steely Dan, has died.\n\nThe band, formed by Donald Fagen and the late Walter Becker, confirmed Beard’s death in a brief statement shared on its website on Wednesday. “It is with great sadness that we announce the loss of our friend and colleague,” the “Reelin’ in the Years” and “Do It Again” band wrote.\n\nA representative for Beard said he died Saturday in a New York City hospital after complications due to a sudden illness, according to multiple reports. Beard, who reportedly was surrounded by loved ones at the time of his death, was 63.\n\nBeard, also a composer and producer, had collaborated with Steely Dan since the early 2000s, bringing his music to releases including its 2003 album, “Everything Must Go.” His career also featured collaborations with “some of the greatest names in music,” including guitarist Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter and John McLaughlin, according to his website’s biography.\n\nBandleader Dizzy Gillespie, jazz duo the Brecker Brothers and singer Dianne Reeves also were among Beard’s collaborators.\n\nBeard’s passion for music can be traced to his childhood; he began learning to play the piano at age 6. He channeled his talents into a range of other instruments including clarinet, saxophone and bass. He attended Indiana University, where he received his degree in music and was awarded the Performers Certificate in piano and jazz studies.\n\nThe musician — born on Aug. 26, 1960, in Ridley Park, Pa. — published more than 100 compositions, performed at several jazz festivals and created music that can be heard in various Hollywood film scores, according to his biography."
