        "text": "The songs of Steely Dan form the soundtrack for so many of our lives. The band, more than any other, brought together Jazz, Rock, and R&B sensibilities to form a whole new kind of pop music. These are the songs that we associate with the warm summer of 1978, our first kiss, and those ski trips out to Colorado.\n\nWinner of multiple awards for best tribute band, Steely Dane is dedicated to not only faithfully reproducing the Steely Dan and Donald Fagen songbook, but to bringing an energetic live-show experience to the crowd. Fourteen of Dane Countyâ€™s best jazz and rock musicians have banded together around their passion for Steely Dan music, playing in the same configuration as the Steely Dan touring band including a four piece horn section and three background singers. Shows consist of hits and deep cuts and sometimes even complete albums and are sure to have you out of your seats singing along.\n\n(Group photos on this page by Dan Kazinski)"
