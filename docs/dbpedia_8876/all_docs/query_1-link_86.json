        "text": "Steely Dan co-founder Donald Fagen did not appear to be in a sentimental mood Wednesday night at Humphreys Concerts by the Bay. Or was he?\n\nDraped across the front of his Fender Rhodes electric piano was a large picture of jazz giant Duke Ellington — who composed the classic “In a Sentimental Mood” in 1935 — along with members of Ellington’s band.\n\nBut Fagen had the same Ellington band picture hanging from his keyboard when the hugely influential Steely Dan last performed at Humphreys in April of 2017. That concert came 43 years after Steely Dan had recorded Ellington’s 1926 classic, “East St. Louis Toodle-Oo,” on its 1974 album, “Pretzel Logic.”\n\nYet, while the famously acerbic Fagen has never embraced overt displays of emotion, on stage or off, there were a few signs that he was feeling sentimental at Wednesday’s concert.\n\nIt was Steely Dan’s first San Diego performance since guitarist and band co-founder Walter Becker died of esophageal cancer on Sept. 3, 2017. His death at the age of 67 came less than five months after Becker had performed for the final time here with Fagen and the group — and barely three months after Becker’s last show anywhere with the band before his cancer forced him to bow out of touring.\n\nThat made Wednesday’s closing selection, jazz-blues great Joe Williams’ wrenching 1958 ballad, “A Man Ain’t Supposed to Cry,” especially notable, even though it was performed vocal-free by the dozen-strong touring edition of Steely Dan, as Fagen left the stage.\n\nBut before he walked off, Fagen, 71, spoke of his former band mate — with whom he launched Steely Dan in 1972 and shared a unique musical sensibility — for the only time during the concert.\n\n“Thank you very much,” Fagen told the near-capacity audience of 1,300, following a spirited performance of “Reelin’ in the Years” that showcased guitarist Jon Herrington, the group’s musical director. “I’d also like to thank my partner, Walter Becker, who couldn’t be here tonight.”\n\nNot surprisingly, Becker’s absence was readily apparent throughout.\n\nOf the 19 songs performed at Wednesday’s concert — which expertly mixed such favorites as “Aja” and “Peg” with such deep album cuts as “Sign in Stranger” and the slinky “Time Out of Mind” — the late guitarist had co-written all but three with Fagen for Steely Dan. The exceptions were Williams’ “A Man Ain’t Supposed to Cry,” the opening Oliver Nelson big band instrumental “Teenie’s Blues” and a late-set version of The Crusaders’ “Keep That Same Old Feeling,” which served largely as a band introduction number.\n\nBecker’s tart guitar work was also missed, although Herrington’s exemplary six-string work was a highlight throughout. Connor Kennedy, 25, the newest addition to the group, played rhythm guitar on most of the selections, but offered tasteful, blues-rock-fueled solos the few times he was featured.\n\nKennedy can’t replace Becker, nor did he try to, in a secondary guitar role designed more to fill out the band’s overall sound than to add a new or different aural dimension. Where Herrington deftly embellished and added new parts to solos originally recorded on Steely Dan albums by such plectrum masters as Larry Carlton and Elliott Randall, O’Connor generally played his parts by the book. With time to evolve, he may grow more musically assertive.\n\nBecker’s absence was felt in other ways at Wednesday’s concert, in particular without the extended spoken interlude he used to do during chestnut “Hey Nineteen.” An unused microphone was on the stage at almost exactly the same spot where Becker stood at his 2017 Humphreys concert with Steely Dan.\n\nIf you closed your eyes, you might not have detected much difference in the music, unless you listened intently and paid careful attention to detail. Credit the skill, taste and pinpoint precision with which this iteration of Steely Dan — most of whose members are longtime touring members of the band — performed throughout.\n\nAs in the past, the superb rhythm section of bassist Freddie Washington and drummer extraordinaire Keith Carlock simultaneously anchored and propelled the music. Like Herrington, multi-keyboard wiz Jim Beard, the four-man brass section and three-woman vocal section, they delivered each song with soulful fire and finesse, executing even the most intricate passages and urbane jazz voicings with poise, panache and deep feeling.\n\nWith few exceptions, this edition of Steely Dan sounded better without Becker than they did at their 2017 Humphreys concert with him. That may be because Fagen, in particular, seems to have stepped up his game to compensate for Becker’s absence, while wisely featuring the individual musicians on stage to an even greater extent than in the past.\n\nThe concert’s highlights included the rollicking “Kid Charlemagne” and “My Old School”; the svelte, bossa-nova-tinged “Rikki Don’t Lose That Number” (a 1974 hit that was modeled on the 1965 Horace Silver jazz gem “Song For My Father”); the deeply melancholic “Dirty Work” (which featured the sterling singing of Catherine Russell, Carolyn Leonhart and La Tanya Hall); and a luminous, nearly 10-minute version of “Aja,” which found the atypically animated Fagen playing melodica — a small keyboard-operated wind instrument — with infectious verve.\n\nWhether it is possible (or even conceivable) for Fagen to ever record a new Steely Dan album without Becker remains a vexing question. But on the basis of Wednesday’s impeccably paced, frequently charged concert at Humphreys, it appears the touring version of the band could thrive for some time to come.\n\nSteely Dan set list\n\nSept 25, 2019, Humhpreys Concerts by the Bay\n\n“Teenie’s Blues”\n\n“Sign in Stranger”\n\n“Black Friday”\n\n“Hey Nineteen”\n\n“Aja”\n\n“Time Out of Mind”\n\n“Bad Sneakers”\n\n“Kid Charlemagne”\n\n“Rikki Don’t Lose That Number”\n\n“Bodhisattva”\n\n“Dirty Work”\n\n“Green Earrings”\n\n“Pretzel Logic”\n\n“Keep That Same Old Feeling”\n\n“Black Cow”\n\n“Peg”\n\n“My Old School”\n\nEncores\n\nReelin’ in the Years”\n\n“A Man Ain’t Supposed to Cry”"
