        "text": "Steely Dan playing Red Bank, Morristown, Atlantic City\n\n“That one was back from 1972 when we wuz just babies,” Donald Fagen of Passaic and South Brunswick cracked after playing “Do it Again’’ last month at Steel Stacks.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that Steely Dan was once a reclusive band back in the day and a regular in the studio.\n\nBut that’s how it was before they were discovered by Kenny Vance, who knows talent.\n\nWhen the former member of Jay and the Americans — who served as musical director of “Saturday Night Love” and such films as “Animal House” and “American Hot Wax” — worked with a pair of unknown musicians in 1967 by the names of Walter Becker and Fagen, he was bowled over.\n\n“I dealt with so many guys (at the famed Brill Building),” Vance said. “Obviously not everyone was great. But these two were different. They had obvious songwriting talent and more.”\n\nBecker and Fagen arranged string and horn sections for Jay and the Americans before becoming one of the most seminal acts during the ’70s thanks to their groundbreaking albums, not for live performance.\n\nThat’s not a dig at their prowess under the lights. It’s just that Steely Dan didn’t play out much during their salad days.\n\nMost acts tour relentlessly during the early period of their career and if commercial paydirt is hit, such recording artists typically pick and choose during the twilight of their career, or in some cases, retire from the road.\n\nAnd then there is Steely Dan, the polar opposite.\n\nThe eccentric, eclectic band formed in 1972. Even though they quickly found commercial and critical acclaim, Steely Dan “retired” from touring in 1974.\n\nSteely Dan, performing Tuesday and Wednesday, Sept. 9 and 10, at the Mayo Performing Arts Center in Morristown and Sept. 12 at Caesars Atlantic City, disbanded in 1981 but re-emerged in 1993 by playing out and occasionally releasing albums. Steely Dan, who will make stops Wednesday and Thursday at the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, tours now more than they ever did.\n\n“It’s great fun to play with a really good band,” Walter Becker explained. “That goes without saying, but I think that’s the essence of it for me right now. This is the best Steely Dan band ever.”\n\nBecker and Fagan can be direct, but they tend to joke around during interviews. Why did the duo dub their last tour, “Mood Swings: 8 Miles to Pancake Day?”\n\n“We made it up,” Becker said. “It was a reconciliation of the classic space time dilemma, in other words, time versus distance. Like the Russian sergeant, who says, ‘Dig me a ditch from here to dinner time.’ ”\n\nGuitarist-bassist Becker and vocalist-keyboardist Fagen, the lone constants in Steely Dan, are colorful, offbeat and unpredictable. The cerebral duo like to keep it interesting for themselves. No act is like Steely Dan. For example, the duo has a bunch of songs they half-completed in 1984 that they’re considering finally finishing.\n\n“Any other band would have completed or mixed whatever those old things were lying around,” Fagen said. “They would have been done with great fanfare, but we don’t play like that. We keep threatening to work on them. Anybody else would have put them on an album.”\n\nBut the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers have defied convention from day one. The guys don’t need to complete old songs since they have plenty of fully realized gems.\n\n“Rikki Don’t Lose That Number,” “Reelin’ in The Years” and “Peg” are just some of the many hits the act has crafted. Steely Dan has no problem moving from rock to jazz to funk and blues. It’s about the music. Everything else is superfluous, including social media, which is as important to some artists as as their instruments.\n\n“I’ve never had a Twitter account,” Fagen said. “I don’t have a Facebook. In fact, I don’t even have a website. I used to, but I canceled it because it took too much time.”\n\nBecker is unsurprisingly in the same boat.\n\n“I thought Twitter was a joke,” Becker said. “I really thought it was a gag. I thought it was like National Lampoon or the Onion.”\n\nIt’s been 21 years since Fagen and Becker decided to reunite for a tour that in some ways has never ended. Did the tandem ever think that the run would last so long?\n\n“I don’t think either of us plans that far ahead,” Fagen said. “So I would give that a qualified ‘No,’ as John Daly used to say on ‘What’s My Line.’ ”\n\nSteely Dan is still quirky, amusing and together.\n\n“How many acts can you say that about?” Vance asked. “They’ve endured. They’ve written a number of classics, which are unique. Who else is like Steely Dan?”\n\nSteely Dan, which never embraced rock, made a name crafting sophisticated music, which has always been difficult to categorize. The act’s songs are distinctive and imaginative. Fagen and Becker write catchy, diverse tunes, which are typically filled with inscrutable lyrics. Their harmonies are typically dense with time signatures which are complex. But many of the band’s songs scored radio play back in the day and stand up to the test of time.\n\n“People still come out to see us so we must have done something right,” Fagen said.\n\nSTEELY DAN\n\nThe Bobby Broom Organi-Stion will open\n\nWHEN: 7:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, Sept. 9 and 10\n\nWHERE: Mayo Performing Arts Center, 100 South St., Morristown\n\nTICKETS: $100\n\nINFORMATION: 973-539-8008"
