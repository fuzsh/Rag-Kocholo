        "text": "Jamie Dieveney\n\nWhen I was in college, I had a great stereo/turntable with HUGE speakers. My roommate and I would leave the turntable spinning with the needle hovering over it. We would also leave a note, saying something like, \"drop the needle and begin your real education.\" One day I dropped the needle and Black Cow jumped out of the speakers and into my soul...changed my life!\n\nJack Klitzman\n\nSteely Dan compositions were new to me when I joined a SD tribute band after my college years. As I studied the music, a whole new world opened, with accessible melodies and novel and jazzy harmony. The arrangements allowed each instrument’s part to be heard, as in symphonic pieces. The harmonic content was uniquely creative. And the eloquence and poetry of the lyrics were stunning, carrying different messages for each listener. The excitement in performing this music is electrified by the joy emanating from our audiences. Full disclosure….. I’m hooked.\n\nDarelle Holden\n\nLyrically speaking Steely Dan use dark and subversive themes along with a lot of satire and clever wordplay. They make you think, question, delight and cringe all at the same time. Haitian Divorce is a favorite of mine. The song is about the “quickie” divorce industry in Haiti in the 1970’s. The woman in the song goes for a quickie divorce, hooks up with a local, then comes back to the states pregnant by her fling but still married. “Some babies grow in a peculiar way”, the baby looks like a Haitian not like her husband. “Who’s this kinky so - and - so”? Again a dark theme and satire but with an infectious groove. Oh, and I love the film reference, “now we dolly back, now we fade to black”, just like in an old movie. Brilliant!!\n\nRich Cole\n\nMy earliest memory of being knocked out by a Steely Day song was hearing the guitar intro to “Josie” on the radio. I was driving and had to pull over to hear it better. I wondered how something this compositionally interesting and arcane made it onto pop radio.\n\nTina Hart\n\nOne of my favorites in the Steely Dan library is Babylon Sisters. The sultry sexy groove sets a vibe that makes you want to listen to it with a \"friend\" ;) You've got to shake it baby, you've got to shake it baby, you've got to shake it....\n\nAndy Omdahl\n\nAlmost Gothic, Two Against Nature: this song has fascinating lyrics, portraying what appears to be a typical Steely Dan topic: an older man falling for a charming albeit unstable younger lady, but the song is actually an exercise in using what appear to be metaphors, literally. What initially seems like an older man falling for a younger woman, is actually about an older man describing his obsession with his dominatrix. The horn lines are mystifying and the melody captivating!\n\nEd Weber\n\nI love the music of Steely Dan because these guys (Donald Fagen and Walter Becker) have/had a unique knack for blending accessible melodies with completely unexpected chord progressions and arrangements. That, combined with the pop and jazz influences woven into the music, makes for some of the most enjoyable material to both listen to and perform that I have ever encountered during my lifetime.\n\nFrank Seeberger\n\nIt’s very hard to choose a favorite song from Steely Dan repertoire, but I always get a real kick out of playing Black Cow! I just love the overall feel and vibe of this tune! Like a lot of Steely Dan’s music, the harmony is sophisticated yet appealing. Plus I get to play that cool opening lick!\n\nRick Houle\n\nI didn't listen, really listen, to Steely Dan before I joined this band.\n\nSteely Dan presented the highest caliber musicians in the world. They have come a long way since the beginning of their band. For me the latest members are truly bad ass.\n\nI love the subtle and unusual harmonic choices.\n\nI love their ability to write great tunes in many genres.\n\nLastly, all my favorite bassists. Chuck Rainey, Marcus Miller, Freddie Washington and Tom Barney. Cool!\n\nMike McGee\n\nWow! For me to pick one favorite Dan tune, I don’t think I can, there is such a rich library to choose from. One of my favorite albums is Royal Scam. As guitar player, I love the way Becker and Fagen orchestrated this album with a lot of guitar work. I love performing their Music because of its sophistication and attention to details! I’ve run out of words to say, only “Very Tasteful” !!!"
