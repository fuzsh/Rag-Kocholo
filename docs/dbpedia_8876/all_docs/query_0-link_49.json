        "text": "Full Name: Donald Jay Fagen\n\nProfession: Singer-Songwriter and Keyboardist\n\nBiography: Along with Walter Becker, Fagen is the co-founder of the jazz rock group Steely Dan, with which he has sold more than 40 million albums.\n\nBecker and Fagen met while attending Bard College in New York's Hudson River Valley. They shared a common interest in jazz, and worked together as musicians, including a stint with touring band for Jay and the Americans, while trying to establish themselves as songwriters in NYC's famed Brill Building. Their point of view was not easily interpreted by other artists.\n\nThe pair relocated to Los Angeles and formed their own group, with Becker as bassist and Fagen on keyboards, nd eventually lead vocals. They continued working as a songwriting team. In 1974, they decided to stop touring and became a studio band with a rotating cast of additional musicians. The original incarnation lasted from 1971 to 1981, experiencing both commercial and critical acclaim for their seven studio albums, especially \"Aja\" (1977).\n\nWhile the band was on hiatus, Fagen release several solo albums, most notably \"The Nightfly\" (1982). He also led an all-star ensemble billed as the 'Rock and Soul Revue' in live performances.\n\nThe duo reunited as a touring band in 1993, and released two additional studio discs before his death.\n\nWith the group, he won 3 Grammy Awards, and in 2001, was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He has also won a Grammy for his solo.\n\nBorn: January 10, 1948\n\nBirthplace: Passaic, New Jersey, USA\n\nAge: 76 years old"
