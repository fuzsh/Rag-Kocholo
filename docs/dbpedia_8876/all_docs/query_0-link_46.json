        "text": "Walter Becker, co-founder of the influential jazz-rock band Steely Dan, has died at age 67, according to his website, which did not disclose the cause of death.\n\nBecker, who played lead guitar, formed Steely Dan with Donald Fagen, its keyboardist and lead vocalist.\n\nIn its heyday in the 1970s, the band scored hits with Reelin' in the Years, Do It Again, Rikki Don't Lose That Number and Deacon Blues.\n\nBecker and Fagen became friends as students at Bard College in New York in the late 1960s.\n\n\"We started writing nutty little tunes on an upright piano in a small sitting room in the lobby of Ward Manor, a mouldering old mansion on the Hudson River that the college used as a dorm,\" Fagen said in a statement on Sunday published by Variety.\n\nAfter working as touring musicians they moved to Los Angeles, releasing the first Steely Dan album in 1972: Can't Buy a Thrill.\n\nThe band took their name from a fanciful dildo that appears in the beat novelist William Burroughs' Naked Lunch.\n\nThe band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland in 2001, where their official biography describes their 1970s albums as \"wry, nuanced and hyper-literate\" that are \"highly regarded by connoisseurs of pop hooks, jazz harmony and desiccating wit\".\n\nFagen described his bandmate on Sunday as \"cynical about human nature, including his own, and hysterically funny\".\n\nAfter a long hiatus, the band reunited in the late 1990s to record its first studio album in 20 years, according to the Steely Dan website.\n\nThat album, Two Against Nature, would go on to win Album of the Year in 2000 at the Grammy Awards.\n\nBecker missed concerts earlier in the year as he recovered from an unspecified medical procedure, Fagen told Billboard."
