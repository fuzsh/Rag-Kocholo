        "text": "Steely Dan is an American jazz rock/rock band founded by core members Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. The band's popularity peaked in the late 1970s, and their seven albums over that period of time blended elements of jazz, rock, funk, R&B, and pop. Rolling Stone has called them \"the perfect musical antiheroes for the Seventies\".\n\nRecorded with a revolving cast of session musicians, Steely Dan's music is characterized by complex jazz-influenced structures and harmonies.....[They] toured from 1972 to 1974 before retiring from live performances, becoming a studio-only band. After the group disbanded in 1981, Becker and Fagen were less active throughout most of the next decade, though a cult following remained devoted to the group.... They have sold more than 40 million albums worldwide and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001. (Read more at Wikipedia)\n\n[]\n\nAlthough we do not have recorded comments on Steely Dan made by Peel, logs indicate that he was at least a little bit interested in them: he was one of the only DJs to play their first single \"Dallas \" in 1972, an obscure song which would not even be included in their debut album \"Can't Buy A Thrill \" later the same year (and would later be disowned by Fagen and Becker themselves who, to date, still refuse to include it in any CD). The song's title may have had resonances for Peel, who retained memories of his time living in Dallas during his early twenties.\n\nThe title of their first album is a quote from one of Peel's favourite Bob Dylan songs, \"It Takes A Lot To Laugh,It Takes A Train To Cry\". He also played all of the first side of the band's fifth studio release \"The Royal Scam\" in April 1976, a few days before it came out. Perhaps their work was too close to the \"adult-oriented rock\" of 1970s FM radio to retain his interest after that, although it was widely praised in the music press and played on the radio by DJs such as Bob Harris and Johnnie Walker.\n\nSessions[]\n\nnone\n\nOther Shows Played[]\n\n(Please add more information if known)\n\n18 July 1972: Dallas (single) Probe\n\n30 August 1973 (Alexis Korner): Show Biz Kids (album - Countdown to Ecstacy) ABC\n\n11 October 1973: My Old School (album - Countdown to Ecstacy) ABC\n\n07 March 1974: Parker's Band (LP - Pretzel Logic) Probe\n\n02 May 1974: Night By Night (LP - Pretzel Logic) Probe\n\n20 March 1975: Daddy Don't Live In That New York City No More (LP-Katy Lied) (1975)\n\nD030: Do It Again (7\" reissue) ABC (reissue released Aug 1975) (1975)\n\n23 April 1976: Kid Charlemagne (LP - The Royal Scam - May 1976)\n\n23 April 1976: The Caves of Altamira (LP -The Royal Scam- May 1976)\n\n23 April 1976: Don't Take Me Alive (LP -The Royal Scam- May 1976)\n\n23 April 1976: Sign in Stranger (LP -The Royal Scam- May 1976)\n\n23 April 1976: The Fez (LP -The Royal Scam- May 1976)\n\n27 April 1976: unknown\n\n08 August 1977: Sign In Stranger (LP - The Royal Scam) ABC\n\n23 September 1977: Tracks from LP \"Aja\"\n\n04 September 1978: 'Do It Again (2x Soundtrack LP-F.M.: The Original Soundtrack)' (MCA) (Paul Gambaccini)\n\n10 November 1978: 'Here At The Western World (2xLP-Greatest Hits)' (ABC)\n\n23 November 1978: My Old School (album - Greatest Hits (1972-1978)) ABC ABCD 616\n\nSee Also[]\n\nSingles Reviews\n\nSounds Playlist\n\nAlbum Plays\n\n[]"
