        "text": "OUR TOP PICKS\n\nSaturday: HillBenders present “The Who’s Tommy: A Bluegrass Opry” at One World Theatre. Though they hail from Springfield, Mo., this energetic alt-grass outfit has a vital Austin connection: It was the late South by Southwest co-founder Louis Meyers who persuaded them to record a bluegrass version of the Who’s classic rock-opera album. What might sound like a goofy lark reveals itself to be much more than that when the band reels off classic after classic in sequence, as they did to a delighted audience at Old Settler’s Music Festival in 2016. $20-$60. 7 p.m. — P.B.\n\nSaturday: Pennyfest at Empire. Does a single-day event really count as a fest? It might be stretching the definition, but we’ll let it slide for this one with its solid offerings of top-notch regional indie rock. Gigs by San Antonio outfit Girl in a Coma have been rare over the last couple years as lead singer Nina Diaz focused on her solo career, but they kick off a national tour later this fall, and they’ll be in Austin to headline this shindig. Also on the bill, presented by Penny Loafer PR and 101X Homegrown Live, are Emily Wolfe, Ghost Wolves, Darkbird and many more. $12-$17. 6:30 p.m. doors. 606 E. 7th St. empireatx.com. — D.S.S.\n\nSaturday: Donald Fagen & the Nightflyers at ACL Live. It’s not Steely Dan, granted, but co-leader Fagen will be playing many of that band’s biggest hits on this tour, as well as choice cuts from his handful of solo records. Backing him is a band of younger musicians he’s recruited from the area around his Woodstock, N.Y., home: guitarist Connor Kennedy, keyboardist Will Bryant, bassist Brandon Morrison and drummer Lee Falco. $69.50-$99.50. 8 p.m. 310 Willie Nelson Blvd. acl-live.com. — P.B.\n\nMonday: Omar Souleyman at Empire. Brought into the international indie music consciousness by Icelandic legend Björk, Syrian wedding singer Souleyman might just be the most unlikely electronic music star in the Western world. His third album “To Syria, With Love” dropped on Diplo’s Mad Decent label earlier this year. Predictably, the move to Major Lazer’s homebase has infused his traditional dabke sounds with more skittery electronics than ever, even as his mournful lyrics ache for his broken homeland. Atash & the Azmaris opens. $17-$22. 6 p.m. doors. 606 E. 7th St. empireatx.com. —D.S.S.\n\nMonday: American Aquarium, Matthew Ryan at Stubb’s indoor. American Aquarium bandleader BJ Barham recently found himself in an unusual position: Just as the long-struggling North Carolina alt-country group finally became a solid national draw, his backing crew decided to depart. He’s re-stocked the lineup with three Texans, including Austinites Joey Bybee (drums) and Shane Boeker (guitar). They held their first full rehearsals in Austin a few weeks ago, shortly after Barham completed an incredible solo U.S. tour: He played at least one show in all 48 contiguous states in less than two months. We’ll have more on that tour, and the new American Aquarium lineup, in Sunday’s American-Statesman. Opener Matthew Ryan, a first-rate rock singer-songwriter since his 1990s tenure with A&M Records, opens. $16-$18. 8 p.m. doors. 801 Red River St. stubbsaustin.com. — P.B.\n\nWednesday: Texas Gentlemen at Waterloo Records. Dallas band the Texas Gentlemen caught some people by surprise this summer when they opened for Dawes at a free Bud Light Series show in the American-Statesman warehouse. Their set of largely cover tunes featured some great choices, including Tom Waits’ “Ol’ 55,” and a singer whose voice was a dead ringer for Willie Nelson’s. Their debut album “TX Jelly,” due Sept. 15 on New West Records, will focus on their original material. Their stop at Waterloo precedes a Thursday appearance at Austin360 Amphitheater opening for Eric Church and Elle King. Free. 5 p.m. 600 N. Lamar Blvd. waterloorecords.com. — P.B.\n\nALSO PLAYING\n\nFriday-Saturday\n\nMike Flanigin Trio with Jimmie Vaughan & George Rains at C-Boy’s\n\nFriday\n\nBob Schneider, Jai Malano, Eric Burton at Nutty Brown Amphitheater\n\nSouth Austin Jug Band reunion at Threadgill’s South\n\nJon Wolfe, Django Walker, Shotgun Rider at Stubb’s outdoor\n\nMC 900ft Jesus at the North Door\n\nRob $tone at Vulcan Gas Company\n\nUncle Lucius, Greyhounds, Elijah Ford at Barracuda\n\nMagna Carda, Trouble in the Streets, BoomBaptist at Hotel Vegas\n\nBody Rock ATX: Kanye vs. Beyoncé at Empire\n\nWhitey Johnson, Denny Freeman at Saxon Pub\n\nScreemin’ Sheelahs at Flamingo Cantina\n\nRosie Flores, Ruby Jane & the Reckless, Blues Specialists at Continental Club\n\nJean Caffeine album release, Bitter Heart Society, Butch County at Hole in the Wall\n\nSam Pace EP release, Watters at Mohawk indoor\n\nBad Rituals EP release, Noisechoir, Hunter Sharpe at Sidewinder\n\nPong, Bamako Airlines at Sahara Lounge\n\nKanga, Adoration Destroyed, Curse Mackey at Elysium\n\nGerardo Ortiz at El Coliseo\n\nSaturday\n\nTab Benoit, Brandy Zdan at Mohawk outdoor\n\nCarbon Leaf at 3Ten\n\nLou Ann Barton, Sue Foley, Redd Volkaert at Continental Club\n\nW.C.
