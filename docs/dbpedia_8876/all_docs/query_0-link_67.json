        "text": "Get all the details you need on Steely Dan's upcoming concerts in 2024, including UK tour dates with the Eagles, locations, the potential setlist, and information on how to secure VIP tickets for an unforgettable experience.\n\nLast updated: 10/04/24 at 5 pm\n\nIconic 70's American jazz rock band, Steely Dan, have amassed a devoted fan base over the years with their unique blend of musical styles and thought-provoking lyrics.\n\nFounded by Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, the band has left an indelible mark on the music industry, winning numerous awards and producing timeless hits such as 'Reelin' In The Years', 'Rikki Don't Lose That Number', and 'Hey Nineteen'.\n\nAfter a triumphant return to touring in recent years, fans have eagerly awaited news of the band's future plans - and it seems the wait is now over. In this blog post, we bring you the latest updates regarding Steely Dan's concert dates in 2024.\n\nWe'll delve into the venues and cities where you can see this legendary band live. Plus, we'll explain how you can access Steely Dan VIP concert tickets, ensuring that you have the best possible experience, complete with luxury perks.\n\nAre Steely Dan still making music?\n\nIn a tragic turn of events, Steely Dan co-founder and guitarist Walter Becker passed away in 2017 at the age of 67 due to an aggressive form of esophageal cancer. Following his death, his widow Delia Becker shared an emotional statement with Billboard, revealing the circumstances surrounding his passing.\n\nBecker and his partner, Steely Dan lead vocalist and keyboard player Donald Fagen, met during their time at New York's Bard College in 1967. They went on to establish Steely Dan in 1971, creating a unique musical legacy.\n\nAfter a successful period as a live band, Becker and Fagen decided to retire from performing in 1974, opting to focus on studio work instead. By 1981, they disbanded and the duo pursued solo endeavors.\n\nIn 1993, Steely Dan reunited, allowing fans to once again experience their iconic music through a series of tours. They also released two albums of new material during this time - the 2000 Grammy Award-winning 'Two Against Nature' and 'Everything Must Go' in 2003.\n\nAfter Becker's death, Fagen reluctantly carried on the Steely Dan project as the sole official member. The band is currently back on tour, with Fagen paying homage to his late partner throughout their performances.\n\nUnfortunately (or fortunately) for Steely Dan fans there are no confirmed plans for new music from the band. Their most recent album, released in 2021, 'Northeast Corridor: Steely Dan Live!'. This begs the question among fans: Will there ever be new music without the presence of Becker, given their irreplaceable artistic partnership?\n\nOpinions among fans are divided, with some believing that Steely Dan's unique dynamic cannot be replicated without Becker. However, a glimmer of hope remains as many fans eagerly await the possibility of unreleased tracks surfacing in the future.\n\nWhile the band's immediate focus is on touring, the anticipation for unheard music lingers and Steely Dan's musical legacy continues to make an impact.\n\nWhen did Steely Dan last tour the UK?\n\nSteely Dan last visited the UK in February 2019, when they embarked on a tour alongside the legendary English musician, songwriter, and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, Steve Winwood.\n\nThe tour saw them deliver outstanding performances at some of the UK's biggest arenas including AO Arena Manchester, Resorts World Arena in Birmingham, OVO Arena Wembley, 3Arena Dublin, and SSE Hydro in Glasgow.\n\nReflecting on the band's legacy, Fagen, the driving force behind Steely Dan, expressed his commitment to preserving the musical realm they crafted together. As highlighted in an article by udiscovermusic.com, Fagen proclaimed, \"I intend to keep the music we created together alive as long as I can with the Steely Dan band.\"\n\nWho is Steely Dan touring with in 2024?\n\nSince September 2023, the band has been supporting the legendary 'Hotel California' rockers, Eagles, as part of their highly anticipated 'Long Goodbye' farewell tour in the United States.\n\nThis incredible collaboration between two musical powerhouses promises to deliver an unforgettable experience for fans.\n\nAre Steely Dan touring Europe?\n\nSteely Dan were originally set to join the Eagles on their UK and European tour but have unfortunately had to pull out due to illness. According to Indianapolisâ€™ Indy Star, Don Henley announced to the crowd at Gainbridge Fieldhouse that Steely Dan frontman Donald Fagen had been hospitalised.\n\nInstead of Steely Dan, The Doobie Brothers will now support the Eagles on the European and UK leg of their upcoming tour. These highly anticipated concert dates are scheduled for Friday 31st May, Saturday 1st, Tuesday 4th, Friday 7th and Saturday 8th of June 2024 at Co-op Live, the largest indoor arena in the UK, which is due to make its grand opening this month.\n\nThis state-of-the-art venue will provide the perfect backdrop for The Eagles and The Doobie Brothers' performances.\n\nBuy Steely Dan & Eagles VIP tickets\n\nSteely Dan setlist: what songs do they play in concert?\n\nPhantom Riders (Stanley Wilson cover)\n\nJosie\n\nHey Nineteen\n\nAja\n\nKid Charlemagne\n\nDirty Work\n\nBodhisattva\n\nPretzel Logic\n\nPeg\n\nMy Old School\n\nReelin' in the Years\n\nA Man Ain't Supposed to Cry (Joe Williams cover)"
