        "text": "Okay, this review comes in two parts - a review of the band and a review of the SSE Wembley Arena.\n\nThe band. Brilliant musicians and they played magnificently. They go on a bit, though! And any Steely Dan set that omits Do It Again, Haitian Divorce, and Rikki Don't Lose that Number, is below par. Perhaps if they'd spent less time showing off (a drum solo for Chrissakes - who cares?!), they might have squeezed in another tune or two.\n\nThe Arena. I haven't been to Wembley Arena for many a year and was surprised to see how little has changed. I spent £95 each for two 'good' seats on the floor of the arena - easily the most expensive non-festival tickets I've ever bought - and they were dreadful. Almost impossible to see the whole stage with someone sitting in front. I would not return to Wembley unless it was a reincarnated David Bowie, supported by XTC and Kate Bush!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThis concert began with fine, vintage music from the DOOBIE BROTHERS singing all of their hits from the '70s & '80s ... naturally, this stirred up good memories for those of us at JIFFY LUBE LIVE who are in our 50's & 60's! After the intermission, STEELY DAN (Donald Fagen and company) arrived on stage and began playing what I considered to be contemporary jazz tunes that did not cross over to the pop charts/American Top 40 ... . It is quite clear that Donald Fagen has not lost his supreme talent for music and for the selection of excellent, new band members; however, he seems to have forgotten his \"old\" fans in that he did not perform his top hits-\"PEG\" and \"DO IT AGAIN\" ... this sadden Me. Maybe, his band member, \"Lord\" Harrington, should tell him how many of Us love these vintage tunes ... .;)\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nSaw Steely Dan with Doobie Brothers in Charlotte PNC pavilion. Had a good sized crowd there of people 4O to 80. The musicianship was excellent. I would have preferred some deep cuts from Steely Dan such as Doctor Woo, Pearl of the Quarter, or Razor Boy, but you can't have it all. I got in and out of the show in about 15 minutes. Beer is around 15 dollars, so I saw the show completely sober. I particularly liked the dance groove Green Flower Street and Natural Thing.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
