Both are alike erroneous and unjust in that they use as a basis for indicating the pre-war income, not the income actually received, but an arbitrary rate of return upon the limited amount of cash invested in In this we are speaking, not of the the business. huge where perhaps the application of the rule would not work unfairly, but of the host of small private corporations where profits are not at all dependent upon the amount of capital employed in the business' where often the capital invested is a mere nominal figure but where skill, energy and enterprise have built up a profitable business\", the main factor in which is what industrial corporations — is known To — low rate of return on a nominal cash investment, is capital, or to introduce revolutionary doc- subversive of the economic theories upon which the country's industrial welfare rests. It is to trines, say that if a man starts in business with a capital of say $5,000 and succeeds in the course of time in building up a business yielding him profits of $50,000, or a $100,000 a year, all that he can fairly claim as legitimate profits, at least in war times, is 8 or 10% on the $5,000 capital employed, or $400 or $500 a year that everything above this trifling and insignificant sum constitutes legitimate prey — for Government exactions and that no matter how much the Government may take, the business man who is made to feel the weight of these oppressive taxes must consider himself fortunate by reason of the steady rise in the cost of In the form in which the bill was submitted by the Senate Finance Committee, the proposition was not open to objection. The Committee bill provided that the average profits for the years 1911, 1912 and 1913 should be compared with current profits, and any excess in the amount of the latter made the subject of the war profits tax. But in the course of the discussions in the Senate a proviso was added which says that the pre-war income \"shall not be an amount less than 6% or more than 10% of the This, actual invested capital for the taxable year.\" as will be seen, nullifies the effort to arrive at a reliable estimate of the difference between present profits and former profits, which alone can be properly designated \"war profits.\" We gave an illustration living. week to show how injuriously the provisions of the Senate bill would work in the case of a small business (whether owned and conducted by an individual, a co-partnership or a corporation) where profits now and before the war had been running at, say, $60,000 a year, and where the cash investment was only $40,000. On this cash investment the 10% allowed as a maximum makes the pre-war income only $4,000. We found that, including the normal tax of 6%, which all corporations, joint stock associations and partnerships will have to pay, and also the 3% tax imposed upon the income of mercantile and last as good- will. ignore the good-will factor and to substitute for it a urgent, so long as the manufacturing corporations by the 1917 Legislature of this State, this little concern would have to turn over in taxes no less than $39,586 out of an assumed income of $60,000. The illustration is worth reproducing as showing the confiscatory nature of the taxes levied under the Senate bill, and we accordingly give it herewith: * THE CHRONICLE Sept. 22 1917.] 1131 YEAKLY TAX WHICH A BUSINESS CONCERN WITH A NET tween the pre-war income and the present income, INCOME OF $60,000 AND A CASH INVESTMENT OP $40,000 on which alone there is justification for levying a high WOULD HAVE TO PAY UNDER THE PROVISIONS OP THE SENATE BILL. extra tax.

All the mischief lies in that proviso and the further fact that in defining \"the actual invested capital\" it is distiuctty provided \"that the good-will, including trade-marks and trade brands, or the franchise of a corporation or partnership, is not to be in- mind that most also to be borne in be absolutely impossible to determine \"the actual invested capital\" upon which the allowance We venture to say of 8 or 10% is to be figured. that the great majority of business concerns, be they large or small, will be unable to state what the real cash investment in the business is. Cash in bank is easily enough determined, but how about It is in cases will machinery and equipment? As a general thing there will be no reliable records available of the original outlay. But even where records exist the plant may have depreciated, or again it may have, by reason of the inflated war prices now preplant, vailing for everything, a value greatly in excess of the original should also be eliminated. And the reasons are the same as in the other case: First, because in the case of interest from corporate bonds where the bonds contain the tax-free covenant, binding the corporation itself to pay the tax, it would be downright wrong for the Government, after having given its sanction to this method, to now adopt a new and wholly different method, putting the burden of the tax upon the bondholder, and depriving him of the advantage which he counted upon getting when he purchased the bond. Another objection is that requiring information at the source would involve such huge extra trouble to everyone concerned^ the Government as well as the whole body of citizens that that alone should be sufficient to condemn it. The tax-free covenant in corporate bonds is usually expressed in language as follows: \"Both the principal and interest of this bond are payable without deduction for any tax or taxes, which the railway company may be required to pay, or to retain therefrom, by any present or future law of the United States, or of any State or territory thereof, the railway company hereby agreeing to pay such tax or taxes.\" Here was a contract deliberately entered into between the corporation and the bondholder, which must be taken to mean just what it says, and Congress should not interfere with its being carried out. The Government is only concerned in getting its tax, and by collecting at the source the Government gets its money with greater certainty than it could count upon getting it where collection has to be from the holder, especially when the latter is a small holder. The bill does not contemplate making any change in the present method where the bonds are held abroad and no good reason can be adduced why a change should be made where the source, — cluded.\" it stituting therefor the furnishing of information at cost, notwithstanding the tion that has since occurred. Who is deteriora- to determine and how is it to be determined?

Yet the Interstate Commerce Com- all this, mission has for years been engaged in this very task, and the work is not one-hundredth pari completed.

It is needless to say that the Government will be unable to defer the collection of these v/ar profits taxes until the valuation It needs the money too badly, and will is completed. expect to collect it within the next few months. Obviously, therefore, any method that requires figuring the cash capital invested is so faulty as to be absolutely unfeasible. On the other hand, the Government already has full records of the a pre-war income in the case of every business concern in the land, and, therefore, there will be no difficulty in arranging for a true and accurate comparison be- — the bonds are owned by residents of the United Sub-division (b) of Section 9 of the law of States. last September, is changed so as to provide that all persons \"having the control, receipt, custody, disposal or payment of interest, rent, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, compensation, remuneration, emoluments or other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income of any nonresident alien individual . . are hereby authorized and required to deduct and withhold from such annual or periodical gains, profits and income, such sum as will be sufficient to pay the normal tax imposed thereon,\" &c.

The labor situation, it is to be inferred, will be considerably relieved when the work in progress for the Government in housing the National Army has been completed, but any marked relief in the matter of cost of materials is something about which nothing definite is known or can be said at this It is true, of course, that there has been a time. slight drop in prices in a few lines recently, including brick, but the fact that this last named material is now in demand for shipment abroad (350,000 Hudson river common brick having been shipped to France toward the close of August) does not argue well for lowering of cost here. tically The building Borough situation in New York (Manhattan has been cause for much anxiety and for the purpose of ferreting out the reason for the slump in construction work and applying a corrective, if possible, a conference was held on Thursday at the City Hall under the auspices of the Building Materials Exchange of New York at which all those in interest were repreWhile nothing of a very definite nature sented. accomplished at the meeting it afforded opporwas tunity for an interchange of views by the various interests concerned and in that way is believed to have been helpful. The outcome of the meeting was the unanimous passage of a resolution empowering Borough President Marks of Manhattan to appoint a conference committee of representatives of those most vitally interested in building construction to examine the whole situation and endeavor to find a remedy for existing conditions without hampering the Government in the prosecution of the war. It was suggested by Allen E. Beals of the Dow Service that the committee ascertain how many buildings there are on which work has been held up because of present conditions and report their findings to Washington in order that the subject might become a national issue Indicating how general has been the contraction in building operations recently, we note that in the latest month 107 of the 143 cities included in our compilation show decreases from 1916, and in many Among the leading cases of large percentage. cities in this category are New York. Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Detroit, San Francisco, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Richmond, Buffalo, Rochester, Salt Lake City, Bridgeport, Hartford, Springfield, Mass., Albany, Toledo, Akron and Dallas. On the other hand, important gains are conspicuous by their absence, the only ones worthy of mention being at Cleveland, Milwaukee, Denver, Atlanta, New Haven, New Bedford and Wilmington. In all, the 143 cities from which we have returns furnish for August 1917 an aggregate of only $51,859,270, against $79,529,110 in 1916 and compared with 1915 and 1914 rather heavy losses are also recorded. For Greater New York the result falls very much below that for the month for quite a period of years, this year's total of $6,324,736 contrasting with $11,400,097 a year ago and $15,620,021 in 1915.

I am beginning in the meantime to act a year ago. Outside of this city the decrease from a year ago is 67 million dollars ($451,339,095 contrasting with $518,346,383) and for the country as a whole (143 municipalities) the total of the projected expenditures involved at $529,684,769 is the smallest in several years, comparing with $697,973,358 in 1916— the eight months' high record, and showing a small loss from the quite low total Of the various groups into which our of 1915. returns are segregated the Pacific Slope alone makes a better exhibit than in 1916, this being due to somewhat of a boom in building earlier in the year. accordingly.\" 026,975 in 1916 At this juncture it is to be noted that Congress is about to adopt a provision for the strict censorship of all mail and cablegrams going abroad, amendments to that effect to the Trading with the Enemy Bill having already been offered. Evidence has been presented to the Conference Committee of the Senate and House which has that bill under consideration that German firms in the United States are transmitting military information to Berlin war, including of course large quantities of foodstuffs, continues to show phenomenal expansion, and to establish new high records. This was the case in the first eight months of the current calendar year, the results for which are now available. While gains are to be noted in about all lines, they are significantly heavy in manufactures, of which explosives is the main item, and conspicuously large in agricultural products, with wheat naturally the predominant element. It is, moreover, well to state that expansion in the outflow to the United States is still an important feature of the returns, with printing paper, copper, wood pulp and lumber prominent. In all, the domestic commodity exports for the eight months reached $961,768,604 against $677,252,161 in 1916 the previous high-water mark for the period. Imports, too, showed a very material augmentation, the inflow from the United States of articles for the army apparently being largely responsible therefor. Briefly, the imports of merchandise for the eight months totaled $717,721,288, this contrasting with $486,058,014 a year ago. Finally, the export balance for the latest eight months is $244,047,376 against $191,194,142 in the preceding year, a comparatively nominal amount in 1915 and considerable net imports in 1914. In the latest month August the increase in the outflow of agricultural products as compared with 1916 was approximately 25 million dollars, of manufactures 27 milhons and of animals and their products 8 milhons. — — — of Spain. in the form of a report from a Government Bureau showing among other things The evidence was messages sent from New York to Barcelona informed the German War Office of the date and strength of the first United States Expeditionary, force. There is evidence, according to the report, that our army and navy are honeycombed with German agents and that the means for transmission of information to Berlin are ridiculously easy. The bill as amended provides that any attempt to evade the censorship on incoming or outgoing mail or in cablegrams is to be punished by a fine of $10,000 The report or imprisonment of ten years, or both. to the committee indicates that code messages containing military information have gone to South America, then to Spain and then by wireless to Germany. Other messages went to Barcelona by mail and were transmitted to Germany by way of submarines, the mail being thrown on Spanish fishing boats which transferred it to submarines at sea. The new law will have a special interest in business circles as it will mean the official opening of foreign mail leaving this country on the same scale as that coming that Canada's foreign export trade, stimulated, as is that of the United States, by the enormous and practically insatiable demand from the Entente Powers for material and supplies for carrying on the by way this simple business way. This week's report by the British Admiralty of the destruction of Biitish tonnage by mines and submarines is the most favorable since the ruthless underwater warfare began.

Referring to recent scandals involving M. Almereyda, the former Minister of the Interior and M.

The incident arose from the discovery on July 9 in the Deputies' cloak room at the Chamber of an envelope containing 27 Swiss 100,000 franc bank notes. The finder, an usher of the Chamber, handed the envelope to the quaestors. Nothing was said of the incident for weeks, and it was only about the first of September that it became an affair of common gossip. The name of the Deputy owning the notes, M.

Some depression was noted in English gilt-edged securities owing to the intimations of a new Government borrowing plan to include an Exchequer issue. Russian securities not unnaturally were subjected to wide fluctuations. Chinese bonds were firm in response to the rise in silver, which touched 55d., comparing with 5 Id. a year ago and 49d. a fortnight ago. There is nothing definite as yet as to the terms on which the Exchequer bonds will be offered, but the rate must exceed 5%, the present figure, as the demand is light at the latter.

The Government vetoed the proposed increases and lower dividends seem inevitable. Lloyds bank in London and the National Provincial Bank have arranged a joint proprietorship of Lloyde* Bank (France), which was formed in 1911 as a separate company to represent Lloyds Bank in Paris.

The renewal of time loans on industrial collateral followed, as already intimated, an important meeting of bank presidents and others, comprising the special sub-committee of the Liberty Loan Committee of the New — — District. The result of the gathering was announced by Benjamin Strong, Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who explained that the original committee had been enlarged by the addition of James S. Alexander, President of the National Bank of Commerce, and Albert H. Wiggin, Chairman of the board of directors of the Chase National Bank. The other members of the committee aside from these bankers and Mr. Strong, were George F. Baker, Walter E. Frew, Gates W. McGarrah, Charles H. Sabin, Frank A. Vanderlip and James N. Wallace. Mr. Strong's statement de^ clared that as the result of this meeting and a preceding one, but without any formal action being taken, certain of the larger New York banks and trust companies had put out a considerable amount of time money, the loans \"being made by each institution for its own individual account on such terms and York 1137 figure applying to such parts of incomes as excess of $1,000,000 per year. are in Necessarily, there be comparatively few who are sufficiently fortunate to be subject to the highest rate. Nevertheless the surtaxes on incomes, not quite so extensive, are sufficiently high to encourage investments in those Government bonds whose returns are not subject to the surtaxes. In June last it will be recalled the largest class of subscribers to the Liberty Loan received but moderate allotments. These subscribers are not improbably among the recent buyers of the first Liberty bond at the present time in the open market.

In view of the attitude of the rest of the world (except Germany's three unhappy allies) toward the German Government and its conduct in tliis war, three events of the present week rise to the first importance. The vote of Argentina's upper chamber on the Luxburg disclosures was one. The public censure of Germany by Sweden, for betraying her diplomatic confidence, was another. The third, with a similar bearing on the diplomatic practices of Berlin, was our State Department's pubHcation yesterday, of Count Bernstorff s message to Berlin, regarding use of the German Government's money to influence opinion in Congress. The Bernstorff message bore the date of January little more than a week before Ger22, this year many's announcement that her pledges to the United States were to be revoked and unrestricted submarine warfare resumed. This decision was undoubtedly known to Ambassador Bernstorff when he sent the message in question; so was the probability that the — German Government's decision would force the United States into the war. He is shown to have thus addressed the Berlin Foreign Office: \"I request authority to pay out up to 50,000 (fifty thousand) dollars in order, as on former occasions, to influence Congress through the organization you know of, which can perhaps prevent war. I am beginning in the meantime to act accordingly. In the above circumstances a public official German declaration in favor of Ireland is highly desirable in order to gain the support of Irish influence here.\" The 1139 This was the more noteworthy in that Argentina had a distinct grievance against Germany over the submarine exploits. The sinking of the Argentine steamship Toro, which was not the first of her vessels torpedoed in the war zone, was made the basis of vigorous representations last summer from the Argentine Foreign Office. In these communications Germany's contentions were brusquely swept aside. \"It is impossible to admit,\" so wrote the Argentine Government, \"that while Argentina is guaranteeing the persons and property of Germans in Argentina, Argentine interests on the seas can be attacked and destroyed by the Imperial German navy.\" Further, it was clearly intimated that, failing an absolute guarantee of safety to Argentine ships, diplomatic relations with Germany would be broken off. After negotiations, continuing from July 4 nearly to the end of August, the German Foreign Office agreed, \"in order to maintain friendly relations with Argentina,\" \"to modify her blockade of enemy coasts, allowing freedom of the seas to vessels under the Argentine flag carrying food.\" The naval forces of the German Empire, the Berlin Foreign Office continued, had received \"orders and instructions in agreement with this viewpoint and the Imperial German Government is convinced that after these declarations no incident will occur to disturb the friendly relations.\" This note was delivered to the Argentine State Department on Aug. 28 by Count Luxburg, German Ambassador to Argentina. On Sept. 8 our Depart- ment of State made public the now famous inter- cepted correspondence of the same diplomat with his own Government, in which he proposed on July 9 while these negotiations were actually in progress that \"as regards Argentine steamers, I recommend either compelling them to turn back, sinking them without leaving any traces, or letting them through.\" This infamous proposal of destroying the vessels at sea, with all board, was forwarded in behalf of Luxburg to Berlin by the Swedish Ambassador to Argentina in connection with his official communi- — own Government. Nothing more sensational than cations to his this had occurred since the publication of the intercepted Zimmermann note to Mexico. The Luxburg episode bore in a sinister way on the good faith of the Swedish Gov- That Government promptly made more satisfactory apologies and excuses they did ernment. or less — can hardly fail to be far-reaching in its bearing not only on sentiment in this country, but on the view of neutral nations regarding the methods of German diplomacy. The publication of this letter closely followed the vote of 23 to 1 in the Senate of the Argentine Republic, on Wednesday, in favor of breaking off relations with Germany an action which itself was an impressive further development in the attitude of the outside world toward the Central Powers. When the United States went to war, and most of the Central and South American States followed us, to the extent of expression of sympathy with our attitude, or rupture of relations with Germany, or outright declaration of war, Argentina held aloof. Her maintenance of neutrality, notwithstanding Brazil's action in declaring war, was undoubtedly instrumental in deciding Chili, Venezuela, Colombia and certain not appear to be satisfactory to the Swedish people themselves. But at least an incriminating responsibility for this performance of its envoy was fixed by Sweden on the German Government itself; for when the Swedish Foreign Office demanded from Berlin whether Luxburg's offensive note had actually been sent by him and received by the Berlin Foreign Office, the reply was such as to occasion the Stockholm Government's stern rejoinder that \"German officials very seriously had abused the confidence others of the South American States, to preserve neutrality. whose size is considerable, and whose influence, owing to its commercial activities, is much greater. effect of this disclosure — Sweden.\" Sweden's culpability in transmitting messages of unknown purport under her Governmental seal will perhaps be passed upon in the approaching Swedish of But naturally the consideration of first importance was the bearing of the Luxburg proposals on the relations between Germany and Argentina. The Argentine Republic has a German population elections. THE CHRONICLE 1140 Her people were at one time believed for that reason to lean toward pro-German sympathies. such considerations were at once superseded But all by this attempt on the part of a diplomatic guest to incite actual murder on the high seas of people of the country to which he was accredited. Rioting against the Germans and their property broke out in Buenos Aires in which, it may be supposed, the very large Italian and French population had a hand, but which under the circumstances may well have been shared Luxburg himself was in by the native population. in hiding. In the end, the Argentine obliged to keep Foreign Minister on Sept. 13 delivered to the German Ambassador a note declaring that, since he had \"ceased to be persona grata to the Argentine Government,\" that Government had decided to deliver him his passports; adding, with a scorn not — [Vol. 105. thinking are apparently now in something like official disgrace because of their importunities. It is this aspect of the situation which explains the numerous recent utterances of German financiers and industrial leaders to the effect that, for the period immediately following this war, the German people may as well make up their minds to learn how to live from their home commercial activities, foregoing the old ambitions in the foreign field. The Argentine episode is only one more in the series of melancholy incidents of German history during the past three years, which go to show what is reasonably sure to happen to the larger interests country whose actions and policies with regard to the outside world are dictated, not by the people as a whole, or even by the business community, but by military leaders brought up in the school of undisguised, that \"the introducer of scrupulous ambitions and ruthless conduct which diplomatically Embassies has instructions to assist you in your have characterized the German army]s ideas, from immediate departure from the territory of the the General Staff down.

Resolutions which aver a willingness to meet a condition of imperative need, even to the extent, if necessary, of foregoing a right to strike, seem to avail nothing. The third party, and the chief party, at interest in this proceeding, is the Government, as the represenWhen a strike occurs, it intertative of the people. pleads, by means of a constituted committee or board, and seeks to compose the difficulties; but short of taking over a plant, under a war emergency law, it has no direct power though it may indirectly, perhaps, operate a plant under certain It declared rights based on the pubUc interest. follows therefore, that regardless of conditions, a strike, in essence, remains a strike, until it is annulled by the local unions themselves by vote of members. And it would appear that the nation's preparation for immediate and vigorous conduct of the war is subject to isolated demands and consequent A confirmation of strikes throughout the countrj'-. this now obtains at San Francisco. Into this state of industrial affairs, in the interest of a proper prosecution of war, the Government enters, with a system for arbitrarily fixing prices. Itself a buyer of ships in the open market, it contracts for large deliveries at stated figures and as a buyer — demands fulfillment of its contracts. The dictatorial board, or power, which fixes basic prices, does so by a sweeping edict for the whole country, and without reference to the size, equipment, or location, of Now the war board which buys industrial plants. ships under contract is not the board empowered to fix commodity prices, though it may exercise a discretionary power to fix contract prices for finished products and there may be, and perhaps is, an attempted harmony of action between the two. Neither of these boards as we understand it, has power to fix wages. That remains at issue between employer and emploj^ees; and, as the strikes now in progress on the Pacific Coast indicate, with skilled labor exercising the power of unions to demand an 1141 increase, without regard to their It any other interest than own. is stated that Government contracts, amount- ing to 1150,000,000 for navy and merchant ships, are held up by strikes in two plants, the Union Iron Works and Moore & Scott Iron Works, at Oakland, It is alleged that the strikers number 25,000 and more than 100 factories, shipyards and machine Cal. shops are affected. Press dispatches announce that the strike is considered \"the biggest in the history of the Pacific Coast.\" Whatever its size, or outcome, it will call the attention of the country to the attitude of labor organizations. It will inaugurate popular demand upon labor leaders to make good and ises for labor in the nation's crisis; their it will prom- forcibly weakness of the policy upon the Government in undertaking arbitrarily illustrate the essential the part of commodity or contract prices, that depend not only on the wage scale, but upon so many other constituent elements over which it has, and to fix either Relative to this confused concan have, no control. dition, a very interesting statement is made by one of the contractors. We quote from a press dispatch: \"R. S. Moore of the Moore & Scott Iron works said no attempt would be made to operate, and- that he considered the only hope of a settlement rested with the Government. He said: \" 'The wage increases asked by the men in our plant could not have been granted without consent The Government contracts of the Government. were made on the basis of the prevailing rate of wages and it was provided that no increase should he granted without the consent of the Government. We have brought the situation directly to the attention of Washington through Captain Pillsbury, local representative of the Shipping Board.' \" We have underscored one clause for emphasis. We do not know the terms of these contracts. That no increase in wages be granted without \"consent of the Government\" would seem to imply a profit percentage on cost. If the Government has any law by which it can fix wages, why not exercise the power all along the line and then there would be nothing to strike for. But let us try to analyze these conditions A Government in imminent as a matter of business. If it be need of war munitions contracts for ships. a price and not a percentage contract it will pay as stipulated on delivery, exacting perhaps a time forfieture, and it has no further interest or power in this than an individual contractor. If it is a percentage on cost contract it will do the same, though it must ever seem, in this, to be at the mercy of conditions and persons. But while it is demanding the fulfill- ment of these contracts it undertakes to exercise an arbitrary price-fixing power, which jeopardizes the very If it be a price contract contract it has entered into. its price fixing of materials (or of wages as the words indicate) must be considered an interference, supposing it to have the power as well as the authority, tending to vitiate and annul; and in equity, if not in law, might be held a breach, for which the Other party might well claim damages. It it be a profit percentage contract their employers may pay labor asks and the Government is bound to submit to the cost bill presented on which settlement And the same would be true as to cost is to be made. any price it which may be any figure the producer is compelled or chooses to pay, and if Government pre- of materials, vents the completion of its own contract by forbidding the payment of higher wages or by fixing a price too high for materials, it would seem to lay itself THE CHRONICLE 1143 liable. Take either horn of the dilemma, business as conducted by the Government. If Mr. Moore is correctly quoted, he this is big may have unwittingly let the cat out of the bag, for unless Government can fix wages and compel men to work, labor seems to be the only interest that is safe. As a plain business proposition, the Government is muddying the waters upon which it must sail, when it injects this confusion, uncertainty and cross-currents, into conditions on which its own contracts are based. Does labor know this and act accordingly ? Time will tell, and these recurring strikes must show which way the wind blows. These are serious matters. in patriotism to consider We them conceive as best it we may. a duty And we must ask, as wc have asked before, conscious of its urgent need, that of the issues which hang in the balance, is it wise upon the part of the Government, in time of war, to enter upon these huge experiments in control of business and the fixing of prices? Will they work, are they working? If admittedly difficult, almost impossible, in peace, are they not more so in time of war? It must appear that unless this so-called co-ordination of all industrial factors can be made complete, the very end sought is made more doubtful. No one would contend that strikes would not occur under the old system, or that contractors might not, or would not, But that system of doing business in the United States had become static. It it could not be depended upon to outfit the nation fail in fulfillment. for successful war prosecution, can this new process, not yet a system, with its untried powers, and confusing tendencies, be depended upon? its THE AMERICAN BANKERS' ASSOCIATION IN TIME OF WAR. The annual meeting of the American Bankers' Association, to convene at Atlantic City Sept, 24, is an occasion which comprises a great opportunity and an imperative duty. It is needless, perhaps, to body of financiers. Democratic in its organization, its membership includes, on equal terms, the large bank and the small, without distinction as to the political government under which extol this independent may be formed. All but a small minority of the banks of this country are enrolled. Necessarily, in so large a body, its work is mainly done by committees, augmented by the separate consideration of problems directly affecting the several classes of our banking institutions, which appear as Sections of the Association. It, therefore, acts in a representait and its declarations assume power and dignity as the financial voice of a people and nation. True to its high purpose of education, fellowship and unity, throughout its long and honorable past, its tive capacity, annual sessions have been notably free from factional dissensions and contentious debate. So that, in the United States, the American Bankers' Association, when it speaks by resolution, compiands not only the respect of the citizenry, but enjoys a measure of confidence in the wisdom and unselfish independence of its decisions not surpassed, if equalled, by any other of our business organizations. We feel it unnecessary to write this characterization save that it aids us in visualizing the coming meeting of this Association in the midst of a worldwar in which the United States now participates. No such opportunity for hftlpfulnes ever existed [Vol. 105. — Ijcfore and certainly we all hope, without dissent, the lamentable conditions will never come again. The responsibility, the duty, implied, is commensurate with the opportunity, and we douh)t not will be met with that distinction and devotion to the best interests of the people at large, which have become traditional with the Association. Nothing has been more insistently presented to the American people than the idea that modern warfare, for its success, depends upon the sustaining power of wealth and business. The banker is peculiarly and pre-eminently the exponent of this wealth and business. He is not the owner of either the wealth or the business. And despite the fact that a debtor and creditor relation exists between bank and depositor, the banker holds a trusteeship for both wealth and business. His personal patriotic impulses and feelings must, in consequence, be tempered by the knowledge of his own position. He must point out what is best, in the gravity of present conditions, by the light of his superior knowledge and exoerience. to sustain wealth and business that they may adequately sustain the most successful conduct of the war. For all other matters are in abeyance. By reason of these facts, the banker stands on the bridge of the Ship of State in the midst of the wild wrack and tumult of the storm. And in his decisions, to an unappreciated degree we believe must rest the present welfare and future destiny of the American people. Trustee and custodian of representative wealth, holding in his power the volume and direction of credit, he must guide the people and preserve the State. Not only to-day, but tomorrow, must be present in his mind. What this imposes we may try to understand. Production, taxation, credit, are the vital issues. In all these the banker stands between the Government and the people. He cannot be loyal to one and not to the other, but in his opinion and acts he must reveal the proper pathway. And this, in the operation of a large independent banking system, he does whether he wills to do so or not. At once mentor and guide, he must conserve the interests of the"
