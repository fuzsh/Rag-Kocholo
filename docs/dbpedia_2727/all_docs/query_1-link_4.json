        "text": "LOS ANGELES — It opened against very light competition, and over the Fourth of July holiday weekend no less. Warner Bros. pumped it with marketing support. Its star, Melissa McCarthy, aggressively trotted the publicity circuit.\n\nAnd yet “Tammy” arrived on tiptoe.\n\nExtending a bleak streak for Warner and leading to questions about the limits of Ms. McCarthy’s R-rated comedic style, “Tammy” took in an estimated $21.2 million over the weekend, for a total of $32.9 million since arriving in wide release on Wednesday. Based on prerelease surveys of potential ticket-buyer interest, several box office analysts had projected a five-day total closer to $45 million.\n\nThe poor turnout for “Tammy” contributed to the weakest Fourth of July box office results in a decade, studio executives said. Viewership of the World Cup and the Friday timing of the holiday probably contributed. Compared with last year, when “Despicable Me 2” and “The Lone Ranger” arrived in theaters, sales for the weekend were down 34 percent, according to Rentrak, which compiles ticketing data.\n\nAmong new films in wide release, “Tammy” competed with a horror picture, “Deliver Us From Evil” (Sony), and a family entry, “Earth to Echo” (Relativity), each of which took in less than $10 million between Friday and Sunday.\n\nThe No. 1 movie over the weekend was Paramount’s “Transformers: Age of Extinction,” with $36.4 million, for a two-week North American total of about $174.8 million. “Age of Extinction” is a runaway hit in a summer that has had few of them: Rentrak estimates that overall movie ticket sales since the first weekend in May have totaled $2.3 billion, a 19.3 percent decline from the same period last year."
