Welch, Jr. Fred Vaughn Dave Rucker $15,100.00 $13,780.00 $1,325.00 $15,100.00 SOUTH ROANOKE BAPTIST ASSOCIATION 27 REPORT OF THE ASSOCIATION AL MISSIONARY 1971 has been a year of adjustment to the changes in organization, grading, and curriculum materials in our churches, as the year began with the installation of the 70' s Onward changes. Early in the year we frequently met with workers in the churches to help then work out these adjustments . The World Missions Conference in February and March was the only Association-wide simultaneous program during the year. Twenty five churches participated, with uniformly good results. The report of the Missions Committee gives some statistical results. I have been blessed with many opportunities to serve you in your churches as you have called on me. I have filled 105 appointments in 38 churches. I have helped to plan, and participated in, 50 Associa- tion 1 meetings, and the 4-day camp at Chowan College, a 2-day R. A. Camp at Camp Contentnea , and the Girls In Action Day Camp at Camp Con- tentnea. I have filled appointments at Hamilton Home, WNCT-TV, and at a Free Will Baptist Church. I have met 47 times with committees, and with 1,593 individuals. We have mailed 24,278 copies of the Baptist Review, 5,538 pieces of third class bulk mail, and used 1,894 6£ and 8<£ stamps and post cards. Outside the Association, I have led R. A. Leadership Courses in the Chowan Association, and the North Roanoke Association, and assisted in an Associational Missions Research Project in the Yates Association which required me to be away four days. I represented State Missions in a World Missions Conference in the South Mountain Association. I have attended the meetings of the Baptist State Convention, the state Evangelism Conference, 2 state Conferences on Associational Mis- sions, the state V.B.S. Clinic, the State Training Meeting for Brother- hood Leadership, Sunday School Week at Ft. Caswell, 2 Cooperative Pro- gram promotion meetings, a Regional Stewardship Seminar, and Regional Planning Meetings for Sunday School and Church Training. Thank you for your assistance on the mission trip that Mrs. Moore and I made to South America in August. We visited churches, missions Missionaries, and national leaders in Bogota, Colombia, Guayaquil, Quito, and Cuenca , Ecuador, and in Panama City, Balboa, and Colon, in Panama. We had opportunity to speak in Bogota and Cuenca, and to dis- cover something of the effectiveness of the program of World Missions which we support in these countries through the Cooperative Program and the special Lottie Moon Offering for Foreign Missions, and the Annie Armstrong Offering for Home Missions. I want to thank the staff of Associational Officers, Organization Officers, and Committees whom we have had opportunity to help, and through whom much of our actual work of Missions in our area must be done. We feel a special debt to six workers who have served five years and are being rotated out of office on the limitation that the Consti- tution puts on their length of service: Max Patterson, Leslie Wickham, Mrs. Albert Bell, Walter B. Jones, Leslie P. Yelverton, and H. J. Mc- Cracken. Respectfully submitted, JOHN A. MOORE, Associational Missionary SUNDAY SCHOOL REPORT During 1970-1971 the Associat ional Sunday School organization held a Group Training Schoolfor four nights at Second Baptist Church, Wash- 28 REPORTS TO THE SEVENTEEN ANNUAL SESSIONS ington. The Guiding Series was used in these sessions. Three Clinics for Vacation Bible School workers were held at Memor- ial in Williamston, Arlington Street in Greenville, and Five Point's- in Wilson. In September, we participated in Sunday School Preparation Week by conducting Associational Age-Group Conferences in three churches that invited us for these one-night programs for Sunday School Leader- ship. The theme for these conferences was \"People To People\". These were well received among the churches in the areas where we were able to go. Believing that the two most important ingredients in every good Sunday School are the leadership of the Holy Spirit, and committed Christians, your Associational Sunday School workers desire to help you, upon your request. Respectfully submitted, J. LEONARD GERRALD, Sunday School Director REPORT OF THE CHURCH TRAINING PROGRAM 1970-71 was a year of transition for the Church Training Program. Many of our churches simply did not take advantage of the opportunities presented to them to learn new approaches and methods of work. As strange as it may seem, many people in our Association still have the old concepts of Baptist Training Union. How can we stimulate a greater interest in the Church Training Program? The answer to this question is simple, yet complex. Simply stated, our people must become convinced of the need for training in today's cnurch. Many still have the idea that you enlist someone for a job, give him a book, and tell him to do the best he can. If, indeed, this was ever adequate, it is certa inly inadequate today. Such an ap- proach will continue to lead to decline and decay. Men and women who are called and elected to particular tasks must be trained to do the job to which they have been called. This is both the duty and oppor- tunity of the Christian Training Program. Your Associational Officers are ready to help you, but must be made aware by your invitation of how they best can serve you. \"M\"-Night offers you a place to begin. This year's \"M\"-Night pro- gram will be held November 1, 1971, at First Baptist Church, in Tarboro. Plan to have a good representation from your church. Respectfully submitted, J. MONTE BISHOP, Director BROTHERHOOD REPORT The basic task a church assigns to its Brotherhood is to teach missions to men and boys. This task is fundamental to all of the ex- periences of Brotherhood. To teach missions means to lead persons to develop new concepts, understandings, and appreciat ons of the total mission of the Church. We will have new attitudes about the mission of the Church. We will enroll the non-committed person in the church's programs, thus deve- loping new skills while taking part in the church's mission. Brotherhood will help men perform specific tasks that only men can do in the church. Our Workshop in October, 1970, was led by our own Associational SOUTH ROANOKE BAPTIST ASSOCIATION 29 Leaders, and our Baptist Men's Rally was led by \"one of our own Mis- sionaries\", Ray Frye of Malaysia. In late summer, our Man-Boy Round- Up was held with a good response by the boys. We need to have more response from the men. In special tasks performed by the men we did the following: (1) Raised money for Camp Contentnea improvements; (2) Helped with Camp Caraway Fund Drive now going on; (3) Held several Work Days at Camp Contentnea. Mildred Baptist Church has organized a Baptist Men's unit and is meeting monthly. We plan the following Associational activities during the coming year: (1) Brotherhood Workshop in Farmville, on October 26; (2) Baptist Men's Rally in January; (3) Brotherhood Round-Up in early fall; (4) Cooperative effort in behalf of improvements at the Associational Camp Ground; (5) Financial promotion for Camp Caraway. Respectfully submitted, J. R. JONES, Brotherhood Director REPORT OF THE ASSOCIATIONAL MUSIC MINISTRY Our Associational Music Ministry has had a good response this year from many of our churches . We had a very good \"Associational Youth Choir\" to rehearse and sing for Baptist Youth Night in March. Also during March, we had two choir workshops, one in Washington, and one in Wilson, under the leadership of our own workers. Chocowinity had a one-church Work- shop for their Adult Choir. Charles Gatwood, Associate in the Music De- partment of the Baptist State Convention, conducted two Choral Workshops in our Association in September which were well attended and received. All churches axe urged to participate in the Associational Music meetings, amd the Regional Choir Festivals. Musically yours, JOHN B. THOMPSON, Director REPORT OF THE MISSIONS COMMITTEE This is the age of rebellion. People everywhere are rebelling against the constituted authority. Rioting mobs fill the streets at night in our large cities, firing guns at random and throwing fire bombs with precision. Lawlessness seems to be the order of the day, Man is bewildered and doped with despair. He searches for the answer, but it seems to elude him. Do we have the answer? God's answer is the New Testament Churches, preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ, preaching by both word and exam- ple. We must become living epistles, demonstrating Christ's love and power through the working of the Holy Spirit. We can positively say that we do have the answer. By any description of duty the mission of the New Testament Church is to spread the Good News. That is to present Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit, so that men shall come to trust in God, accept Him as Saviour, and follow Him as Lord in the Church. Simply stated, it is the aim of the church to introduce people to Jesus, the Jesus who ef- fectively aids men in their fight with suffering, and sin, and death, 30 REPORTS TO THE SEVENTEEN ANNUAL SESSIONS and the Devil. Needless to say, this kind of missions reaches into every nook and corner of a man's life, and for that matter, into the entire social structure. It is most effectively realized in the daily witness of the pastoral ministry, and in the institutional services of the Christian home. How have we presented the Good News in the South Roanoke Baptist Association during the past year? We are real pleased with the encour- aging reports from the individual churches, but we must realize the fact that we are far from the realization of what Christ expected us to do. The Riverside (Bible) Baptist Church of Plymouth which was admit- ted into our Ass ciation two years ago continues to show progress. They have purchased a lot on which to build a new church, and have called a full-time pastor, Rev. James Lochridge, formerly a missionary to the Philippines. He and Mrs. Lochridge live at 501 East Third St., Plymouth. This church adopted its new name after purchasing the building site. The Second Baptist Church, Washington, conducted a Mission Vaca- tion Bible School in the Public Housing Project in Washington where they maintain a branch Sunday School. The World Missions Conference held in our Association February 28 through March 5 was very successful. Churches participating were: Ar- lington Street, Ayden, Chocowinity, Grifton, Immanuel, Oakmont, Winter- ville, Bible, Oak City, Pactolus, Robersonville , Washington First, Washington Second, Williamston West End, Farmville, Fountain, Pinetops, Elm City, Stantonsburg, Trinity, Tarboro First, Webb's Chapel, Wilson First, Five Points, and Grace. The Missionary Speakers were: John Kasa, Language Missions; Ray Frue, Malaysia; H. A. Privette, State Missions; Jorge Alberto Martinez, Language Missions; Luther Osment , State Missions; Charles Wiggs, Korea; W. Lowrey Cooper, Argentina; Henry W. Stough, Associat iona 1 Missions; Charles Etheridge, Pioneer Missions; Miss Carol Lee Humphries, Nigeria; Ben W. Tomlinson, Taiwan; Alex L. Booth, State Missions; Charles Oakes Brazil; Thomas Baird, Home Missions ; Charles E. Beckett, East Pakistan; Mrs. John Sylvester, Language Missions; A. R. Waisner, Associationa 1 Missions; John B. Hill, Nigeria; Paul Nevels, Home Missions; E. C. Wil- kie, State Missions; Cletus Wilch, Army Chaplain; James Y. Green, State Missions; Curtis L. Dixon, Brazil; Roger Knapton, Home Missions. Grand total attendance - 12,573 Average Daily Attendance - 2,095 7 Adult Classes studied \"The Diakonic Task\" 6 Youth Classes studied \"New Day On The Hudson\" 6 Children's Classes studied \"The Red Brick Friend 5 Preschool Classes studied \"Tony's Triumph\" The churches reported 6 conversions, 10 volunteers for special Christian service, 79 subscriptions to The Commission and Home Missions, and 185 rededica t ions . Two morning meetings were held: on Tuesday at Oakmont, and Friday at Farmville. These inspirational and report sessions proved to be a highlight of the week. Surely, this is the time for total dedication to Christ in His great purpose of winning the lost to faith in God. Respectfully submitted, HORACE G. THOMPSON, Chairman Of Missions SOUTH ROANOKE BAPTIST ASSOCIATION 31 CHRISTIAN EDUCATION REPORT The experience of learning begins with birth and continues to the grave with persons. Fortunate, indeed, is everyone who is born in a Christian home and becomes the recipient of Christian nurture and train- ing in family life. This training is strengthened in the church, in its religious education program and its emphasis on the meaning of life. Formal education begins with the public school and continues through college and university life. Then one becomes engaged in some definite area in the broad activities of life's school to ma ture in character and concepts of life. Thus the home, the church, and the school and society at large make their impact upon our lives. At the heart of all our efforts in human growth and development is the urgency for Christian education, for society comes to a happy status, or to misfortune, as people are Christian or non-Christ ian in their pur- poses and goals. Fortunate are our Baptist people, and our nation in general, that in North Carolina we have in focus Christian education in seven Baptist colleges in which about 13,000 students are enrolled. These schools are Chowan Junior College, Wingate Junior College, and Gardner -Webb Junior College, which soon will have senior college status along with Mars Hill College, Campbell College, Meredith College, and Wake Forest Uni- versity. Parallel with these institutions, our North Carolina Baptist State Convention supports Fruitland Bible Institute for special training of ministers who are limited in formal education, or with whom seminary training is an impossibility, a summer religious assembly at Caswell, a year-round program of assemblies, retreats, and camping at Camp Cara- way and Mundo Vista. Two other facets of particular interest are our Baptist Youth Corps summer program, and our Baptist Student Union pro- gram on college campuses across the state. Furthermore, Baptists of the Southern Convention have 43 Baptist colleges and universities, and 11 Junior colleges, all of which are making a tremendous contribution to the training of lay leaders and vocational Christian workers. We have 6 theological seminaries perform- ing multiple ministries of training pastors, ministers of religious education, musicians, and missionaries. Enrolled in these Southern Bap- tist chools are more than 100,000 students, and more than 14,000 voca- tional Christian workers. An ever-recurring problem for our schools is the question of money. Aside from other sources of income, our Baptist churches afford support for these educational institutions in North Carolina by giving through our Cooperative Program 25.6% of each dollar. Allocations go to the schools as follows: Campbell 4.11% amounting to $302,350 Chowan 2.51% amounting to $184,360 Gardner -Webb 2.63% amounting to $193,578 Mars Hill 3.56% amounting to $261,791 Meredith 3.56% amounting to $261,791 Wake Forest 6.10% amounting to $441,995 Wingate 2.61% amounting to $191,735 Education Council . 52% amounting to $ 38,000 TOTAL 25.6% \" $1,881,600 In addition, \"Father's Day\" is designated in our North Carolina Baptist denominational calendar as \"Christian Education Day\", at which time our people are informed about our Baptist schools and are called 32 REPORTS TO THE SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL FALL SESSION on for special gifts for their support. All in all, we have a great program of Christian education which involves the lives of many people and demands the giving of large sums of money by our people. Your prayers and financial support are strongly solicited. Respectfully submitted, IRBY B. JACKSON, Representative CHRISTIAN LITERATURE REPORT In \"one picture is worth a thousand words, and could reach TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE\" , why should I hesitate? I'll show you one. As you look at it, you see a man reading a paper (in this instance the News And Observer). The top of his head has been lifted so you can see \"the works\". Do you get the picture? The human brain is the finest of all computers, and it doesn't cost you a dime. God has given you a computer to use. Who programs this computer? Each human being is responsible to God for the use he makes of the brain he has. Can you, as your church's representative, convince others of this? Try! A certain group - RIF - uses as its slogan, \"If America is to grow up thinking, READING IS FUNDAMENTAL\". If you doubt this, turn in your Bible to Second Timothy 2:15, \"Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth\". Does this apply only to Timothy? I think not. So, begin the new Associat ional Year by majoring on Christian literature, and in encour- aging others to do so. It may not be as hard as you think, since we are blessed with excellent publications. I. SUNDAY SCHOOL LESSONS. These are available to all age groups, plus the lessons you may find each week in the Biblical Recorder and the News and Observer. II. WOMAN'S MISSIONARY UNION. The W. M. U. has literature for mission study for each age group. Who reads it? We wish each member did. Let's find out what we can do to keep these computers from gathering dust. III. The BROTHERHOOD and the ROYAL AMBASSADORS have excellent maga- zines for reading and for program resources. IV. THE COMMISSION and HOME MISSIONS are available at a nominal cost. If \"reading is the fastest way to program the human brain\", why not find out what is happening both at home and abroad? You can. V. THE BIBLICAL RECORDER is a \"MUST\" for every Tar Heel Baptist. If you don't already have it in your home, you should do something to remedy that. There are many other publications available. Look around and see what you can discover, even in your church library. VI. MISSION STUDY - CHURCH-WIDE. This includes each person in the church family. It is good for all ages to get together for study and fellowship. But, how many actually read these books? We have the people, we have the literature, so get those compu- ters busy - working for God. Respectfully submitted, MRS. MARVIN M. EVERETT, Representative SOUTH ROANOKE BAPTIST ASSOCIATION 33 BUILDER'S CLUB REPORT The South Roanoke Builders' Club has been a going organization for about twenty years now. It was organized with the sole purpose of help- ing small churches to get started, or helping them secure a lot, or help- ing them to build, or to assist in some phase of completing some much needed construction. There was a balance on hand on October 1, 1970 of $2,421.24. The Bib le Baptist Church Plymouth, was given $1,000.00 to help them secure a very desirable lot for their new church building. Since there were no calls sent out to the members during the year (at the suggestion of The Executive Committee) we have only had the accrued interest of $101.81, and a small deposit brought over from last year of $4.00 to add to our balance, leaving us a net balance of $1,527.05 at the end of the year. We covet your prayers that the South Roanoke Builders' Club will be able to continue its efforts in helping small churches get started in carrying out the work of our Master. Respectfully submitted, LESLIE P. YELVERTON, Chairman ASSOCIATIONAL EVANGELISM REPORT Perhaps the most significant event in evangelism for our State Con- vention was the Youth Evangelism Night this past February. There were some 20,000 youth and adults who attended at the Greensboro Coliseum and War Memorial Auditorium. A total of 1,519 decisions were made by young people. Evangelism is receiving a new impetus throughout the Southern Bap- tist Convention through the constructive use of the new WIN (Witness Involvement Now) materials. Lay Evangelism Schools are being sponsored by the Division of Evangelism of our State Convention. This past Febru- ary, a Conference On Evangelism in our Association was held at the First Church, Tarboro, in which Bill Lamm shared the future plans of the Lay Witmessing Schools and introduced the witnessing materials. We plan to schedule a school on lay witnessing for our Association in 1972. On February 7, 1972, the annual State-wide Evangelism Conference will be held at the Cumberland County Memorial Auditorium in Fayette- ville. The next statewide Youth Evangelism Night will be held August 18, 1972, in Greensboro at the Coliseum. Respectfully submitted, JIM HERRON, Chairman Of Evangelism STEWARDSHIP REPORT An August Presidential press conference signaled the need for our country to take some positive steps toward solving our present economic crises . With our steadily increasing responsibilities we Baptists have also recognized the need to develop a stronger program of stewardship or else we shall have to curtail some of our operations. The costs involved in our School of Nursing have already made it necessary to terminate this program. The meetings held in recent months at our Baptist Colleges have further served to pinpoint the need for more funds, just to maintain the programs as they are now. Some of our fellow denominations, themselves faced with a shortage of income, have had to cut back on their foreign mission personnel, leaving serious gaps in the Christian witness around 34 REPORTS TO THE SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL FALL SESSION the world. For several years now we Baptists, along with all other Americans, have been privileged to enjoy an abundance of God's blessings; and yet, our record of giving in many instances has fallen far short of our poten- tial. Now, when many are saying that the \"times are bad\", we may well be faced with the call to sacrifice and then sacr if ice some more so that the cause of our Lord and Saviour will not have to retreat but will be able to go onward to new heights of service and sccomplishment . As it was said of the British nation during the dark days of World War II, may this be \"our finest hour\" as we are subjected to the fires of sacrifice and are found faithful and true to the trust that is ours. What can we do? May we suggest the following. Fourteen of our As- sociational churches were listed as having given no offerings to the Cooperative Program this past year . If you are in one of these churches, would you not return to your church and encourage your people to join with our other churches in the support of this worthy program of Christ- ian missions and service? We would also ask the rest of you to give ser- ious consideration to the suggestion of our State Convention to increase your allocation to the Cooperative Program by the small sum of 6%. The challenges we have in today's world are many; the responsibili- ties are great; but let's together strive to be found faithful as stewards of the manifold grace of God. Respectfully submitted, JACK HOLT, Representative REPORT ON OUR BAPTIST HOMES FOR AGING In March of this year we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the work of our Homes For The Aging. During these two decades, our minis- try to older people has been enlarged and strengthened. Today, we have five homes and a nursing care unit. We are proud of the work done by this agency of our denomination in North Carolina. While the financial support of our N. C. Baptist Homes has in- creased in recent years, the annual income has been insufficient to meet operating expenses. An increase in the amount received from the Cooperative Program and in the Special Day Offering is needed to meet expenses and to begin operating in the black. At least 80% of the peo- ple who live in our Baptist Homes are financially needy persons. The Homes could not be operated without the generous support of N. C. Bap- tists . A new addition to the Nursing Care Unit in Winston Salem was scheduled to be completed this year. It will make available 20 addi- tional beds and bring the total capacity of the Nursing Care Unit to 76. The five Homes can accomodate 160 persons. Our ministry to the aging deserves the prayers and liberal support of every North Carolina Baptist. Respectfully submitted, PERCY B. UPCHURCH, Representative REPORT ON BAPTIST HOSPITAL With strictures placed on the economy by the government which have frozen wages, the temptation for most of us is to do less than we have before in the matter of our support for our Baptist Hospital. However, during the period January through September, your gifts exceeded your gifts last year by $50.52. If those churches that have not yet sent in an offering would do so, it would be a small thing for us to go over the SOUTH ROANOKE BAPTIST ASSOCIATION 35 record amount for this offering! Of course, we respect every church's right to contribute or not contribute. Nonetheless, no one can success- fully argue against the support of our Baptist Hospital. Our Baptist Hospital is a mission of Christian compassion as well as any mission which we support as Baptists.' The whole man is ministered to: body, mind, and soul. All of this is done in the name of Christ Jesus, who makes men whole! Salvation comes when the whole man is made whole! Thus, who can deny our Baptist Hospital its rightful place alongside evangelism, foreign missions, and church enlargement? For the purpose of organization and administration we form separate agencies and orga- nizations, well fitted for the tasks of their services; but all of these go together to fulfill the mission of Christ. Our Baptist Hospital is in every way an important part of the on- going ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus, we once again underline our need for its sacrificial support, and heartily thank all our churches which have been generous by supporting its ministry through the Mother's Day Offering of 1971. Below, is a table tabulating the gifts from our churches from Jan- uary, 1971, through Sept. 1971, and its comparison with the previous year. Respectfully submitted, JOHN C.

Since the Association last met, our program of services has been strengthened in various ways. The desire for a home to serve Western North Carolina has become a reality. The first two cottages on the Broyhill Home campus near Waynesville have been completed, providing for twenty five additional children in group care. Also during the past year, a maternity home has been opened in Asheville. The Ten Star Builders Program, designed to inform Baptists and other friends of the Children's Homes in Eastern North Carolina of the services we are rendering to children and their families, was launched last fall. The initial response has been encouraging. Funds are being raised in Lenoir County for the W. C. Reed Memorial Gymnasium and plans are to have the dedication of this building on Sunday, Nov. 7, 1971. Foster homes in Eastern North Carolina now number sixteen with spaces for 25 children. Five years ago we had only one foster home in the Eastern area. This is encouraging growth. Additional foster homes are needed. This affords opportunity for a meaningful and rewarding ministry for children and foster parents alike. The purpose of the Children's Homes is to provide children loving care in the spirit of Christ. The pursuit of this basic goal has led the Homes to develop a variety of services, all family centered. Some children need resident care. For those we have group homes and foster homes . Some families can remain together with outside help and for these we have family services in the form of counseling or financial assis- tance. For the unmarried girl who is pregnant, we offer maternity care. For the graduate in our care , we assist in higher education. For churches involved in day care, nursery school, and kindergarten, we provide a demonstration program and consultation service. We welcome individual inquiries regarding any of these services as the need may arise. Our services are made ava ilable through strategically located faci- lities throughout North Carolina ; in the East at Kinston, Pembroke, Fayette- ville, and Raleigh; in the Piedmont at Chapel Hill , Thomasville and Char- lotte; in the West at Asheville and Waynesville. Trustees, staff members and children of the Baptist Children's Homes are grateful for the harmonious relationship we share with North Carolina Baptists. The churches have expressed their confidence and support through increased Cooperative Program gifts, and a 1970 Thanks- giving Offering of $380,000. Individuals continue to give generously and to become involved in our varied ministries. We accept this support as an investment in all that we are doing, and we pledge ourselves to translate your investment into quality Christian child care. Respectfully submitted, CHARLES C. POWELL, Representative REPORT OF THE PLACE AND PREACHER COMMITTEE We recommend that the Association accept the invitations extended to us by the First Baptist Church, Washington, for the Tuesday meeting of the Association, and by the Memorial Baptist Church, Williamston, for the Wednesday meeting.
