The ISNL benefits from the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nTo date, the International School of Nuclear Law has provided a unique educational opportunity to more than 1200 graduate students and young professionals from around the world.\n\nThe ISNL programme has evolved over the last 22 years to address developments in nuclear law, thus providing a high quality, intensive overview of a complex body of laws and legal regimes.\n\nProgramme\n\nThe following subjects are covered during the ten-day programme:\n\nintroduction to nuclear law\n\ninternational institutions and organisations\n\ninternational radiological protection standards\n\nnuclear accident notification and assistance\n\nnuclear safety\n\nnuclear regulatory regimes\n\nenvironmental protection\n\nmanagement of spent fuel and radioactive waste\n\ntransport of nuclear materials and fuel\n\nnuclear security: physical protection, illicit trafficking and terrorism\n\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons and international safeguards for nuclear materials\n\nliability, compensation and insurance for nuclear damage\n\ninternational trade in nuclear materials and equipment\n\ncontracting\n\nUniversity Diploma in International Nuclear Law\n\nISNL participants have the possibility to apply for a University Diploma (Diplôme d'université - D.U.) in International Nuclear Law from the University of Montpellier.
