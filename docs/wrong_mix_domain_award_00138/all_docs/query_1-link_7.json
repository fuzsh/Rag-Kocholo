This limited edition, large format book details the Agency’s past and present. Key events including President Eisenhower’s ‘Atoms for Peace’ speech, the establishment of safeguards regimes, the international response to the Chernobyl accident and the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005 as well as the ongoing activity and endeavour in fields ranging from sustainable energy production to human health, are covered.\n\nThis publication is an attractive and informative introduction to the work of the Agency, issued at a time of unprecedented international interest in the safe, secure and peaceful exploitation of nuclear science and technology."
