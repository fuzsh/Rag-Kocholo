Kennedy, Jr. a Secret Service detail.\n\nThe Eisenhower Way to Strengthen our Democracy\n\nWe Support the Eisenhower Foundation’s Decision\n\nWhat They Know and What They Tell Us\n\nThe Discord leaks have undermined the credibility of our Foreign Policy Elites\n\nAn Enduring Cold War Mystery\n\nLast week was the 75th anniversary of the murder or suicide of Jan Masaryk, Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia. Read a startling assessment of what might have happened to a man crushed by the struggle between West and East.\n\nThe Painful Loss and End of an Era\n\nWith the unexpected death of my dear sister Anne and the passing of two world leaders, it is time to rethink what their legacies tell us about our responsibilities to the future.\n\nThe Passing of a “North Star”\n\nIn an interview this weekend with British TV channel Sky News, Susan Eisenhower reflects on Queen Elizabeth II’s special friendship with Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.\n\nMy Summer of Reflection\n\n“Bombshell” is a popular word these days, perhaps because for once it really does seem to describe our times."
