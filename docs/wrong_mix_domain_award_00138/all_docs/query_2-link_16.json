        "text": "KWAME HOLMAN:\n\nThe announcement in Oslo, Norway brought cheers, hugs and smiles in Vienna, Austria, the city the IAEA calls home. The nuclear agency was created in 1957 by the United Nations to oversee the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. That mandate since has evolved to responsibility for stopping the development and spread of nuclear arms.\n\nAt the IAEA'S helm the past eight years, Mohamed ElBaradei, the 63-year-old Egyptian lawyer and former diplomat. He became an international figure in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003. His agency dispatched weapons inspectors to Iraq and he was caught in the middle of claims and counter claims between the Bush administration and Saddam Hussein over Iraq's alleged nuclear capabilities. Here was ElBaradei at the U.N. Security Council in January, 2003, two months before the U.S. invasion, urging more inspections and the postponement of military action.\n\nMOHAMED ElBARADEI:\n\nThere is no indication of resumed nuclear activities in those buildings that were identified through the use of satellite imagery as being reconstructed or newly erected since 1998, nor any indication of nuclear related prohibited activities at any inspected sites. Second, there is no indication that Iraq has attempted to import uranium since 1990. Three, there is no indication that Iraq has attempted to import aluminum tubes for use in centrifuge enrichment.\n\nAfter three months of inclusive inspections, we have to date found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY (March 16, 2003):\n\nWe believe he has in fact reconstituted nuclear weapons. I think Mr. ElBaradei, frankly, is wrong, and I think if you look at the track record of the International Atomic Energy Agency in this kind of issue, especially where Iraq is concerned, they have consistently underestimated or missed what it was Saddam Hussein was doing.\n\nKWAME HOLMAN:\n\nIn the end, ElBaradei never did endorse US claims that Saddam Hussein had an active nuclear weapons program.\n\nIn the last few years he has focused more attention on North Korea and Iran, alleged to be developing nuclear weapons of their own. Last year he sat down with Margaret Warner to discuss efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons not only among nations but on the black market and to terrorist groups.\n\nMOHAMED ElBARADEI:\n\nThere's a lot of measures we need to take, control of the nuclear material, better export control, better authority for the agency, less countries having enrichment processing. So people should not sit on their laurels and say we are safe. We are not safe unless we take a lot of measures."
