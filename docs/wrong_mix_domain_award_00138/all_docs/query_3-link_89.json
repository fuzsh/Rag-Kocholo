We will take a call only after assessing the position of the imported fuel and domestic uranium,\" the official said.\n\nIndia currently imports uranium from Russia, Kazakhstan and Canada. Plans are also afoot to procure the fuel from Uzbekistan and Australia.\n\nBy placing the reactors under the IAEA safeguards, India gives the international nuclear energy watchdog access to them. This step was taken by the country in 2014 to demonstrate that its nuclear energy programme was for peaceful purposes.\n\nThis is a necessary step under the Indo-US nuclear deal.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nWhat's cheaper and what's costlier?
