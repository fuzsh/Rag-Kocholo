        "text": "Overview:\n\nAn International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team recently arrived in Tokyo for a final review before Japan begins releasing massive amounts of treated radioactive water into the sea from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant.\n\nAbout International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):\n\nIt is widely known as the world's \"Atoms for Peace and Development\"​ organizationwithin the United Nations family.\n\nMandate: It is the world's central intergovernmental forum for scientific and technical co-operation in the nuclear field. It works for the safe, secure and peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology.\n\nHistory: Though established as an autonomous organisation, independently of the United Nations through its own international treaty, the IAEA Statute, the IAEA reports to both the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council.\n\nHeadquarters: Vienna, Austria.\n\nFunctions:\n\nThe Agency works with its Member States and multiple partners worldwide to promote the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear technologies.\n\nIt applies nuclear safeguards – consisting of monitoring, inspection, information analysis, and other activities – to verify that nuclear activities remain peaceful and detect and deter their diversion, including to weapons-related purposes.\n\nIn particular, the IAEA implements comprehensive safeguards agreements mandated by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which serve as a first line of defense against nuclear weapons proliferation.\n\nIAEA assists its Member States and promotes the exchange of scientific and technical information between them.\n\nIAEA enhances national, regional, and international capacitiesto respond to nuclear and radiological incidents, which is essential to minimizing their impact.\n\nWhat is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)?\n\nIt was an agreement signed in 1968by several of the major nuclear and non-nuclear powers that pledged their cooperation in stemming the spread of nuclear technology.\n\nWith 191 States parties, it is the most widely adhered to treaty in the field of nuclear non-proliferation, peaceful uses of nuclear energy and nuclear disarmament.\n\nUnder the NPT, non-nuclear-weapon States parties have committed themselves not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices while nuclear-weapon States parties have committed not to in any way assist, encourage or induce any non-nuclear-weapon State party to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\n\nNuclear-weapon States parties under the Treaty are defined as those that manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device before 1 January 1967.\n\nThere are five nuclear-weapon States parties to the Treaty.\n\nOnly Israel, India, and Pakistan have never been signatories of the Treaty, and North Korea withdrew from the Treaty in 2003.\n\nQ1) What is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)?\n\nIt was an agreement signed in 1968 by several of the major nuclear and non-nuclear powers that pledged their cooperation in stemming the spread of nuclear technology.With 191 States parties, it is the most widely adhered to treaty in the field of nuclear non-proliferation, peaceful uses of nuclear energy and nuclear disarmament.\n\nSource: IAEA team in Japan for final review Fukushima nuclear plant water\n\nDownload PDF\n\nShare this article"
