        "text": "This article is about the captain of the Black Pearl.\n\nYou may be looking for the soundtrack theme of the same name.\n\nFor other uses, see Jack (disambiguation)\n\nJack Sparrow was a legendary pirate of the Seven Seas and the irreverent trickster of the Caribbean. A captain of equally dubious morality and sobriety, a master of self-promotion and self-interest, he fought a constant and losing battle with his own best tendencies while living the pirate's life. Sparrow may be the best or worst pirate, depending on whose opinion to take into account, and was the quickest to seize the moment and make it his own; whether by cause and careful planning or mere accident was a matter of debate, but the results were the same and always different. He had been cursed, left for and come back from the dead, and seen his fair share of the supernatural through mythical beings, ghosts, zombies, mermaids, and other eldritch creatures, as well as becoming the center of various myths and legends himself. Captain Jack Sparrow's first love was the sea, his second his beloved ship the Black Pearl, and desired freedom and adventure more than any material treasure.\n\nThe son of Pirate Lord and Keeper of the Code Captain Edward Teague, Jack was born on a pirate ship in a typhoon. Before he became known as \"Captain Jack Sparrow\" he was simply known as Jack Sparrow, an adventure-seeking teenage stowaway, struggling to find his place on the Seven Seas and following his enigmatic father's buccaneering footsteps. In his first year at sea, young Jack sailed on a series of adventures with a ragtag crew aboard the Barnacle, beginning with a quest to locate and procure the legendary Sword of Hernán Cortés. In the time following his earliest adventures, Jack earned the name \"Jack the Sparrow\" after a sea battle with the Silent Mary, which he defeated and sunk along with its merciless captain, Armando Salazar, also known as El Matador del Mar or \"The Butcher of the Sea\". After his encounter with rogue pirates, Jack was forced to abandon the pirate life and pursued a legitimate career as a merchant seaman for the East India Trading Company. After five years of faithful service, the wily sailor was given command of the Wicked Wench, a ship owned by Cutler Beckett, the EITC Director for West Africa. As Beckett's employee, Sparrow searched for the magical island of Kerma and its treasure, until he decided to betray Beckett and keep the island and its inhabitants safe from Beckett and his slave traders. When Beckett ordered him to transport a cargo of humans as slaves to the Bahamas, promising to sell him the Wench for just one shilling, Sparrow chose to liberate them instead and stole the Wench from Beckett. However, Beckett's men managed to find Jack and branded him as a pirate, irrevocably returning Sparrow to a life of piracy, while the Wench was set aflame and sunk. After striking a bargain with the fearsome Davy Jones, the ghastly cursed captain of the ghostly Flying Dutchman, in which his beloved vessel was raised from the depths, Jack had the Wicked Wench rechristened as the Black Pearl and began the life of a pirate anew. Shortly afterwards, Jack Sparrow became one of the nine Pirate Lords of the Brethren Court, with Sparrow himself being the new Lord of the Caribbean Sea.\n\nNow one of the most infamous and notorious pirates of the Caribbean, Captain Jack Sparrow embarked on many adventures. He was captain of the Black Pearl for two years, during which time he searched for the Shadow Gold. But when Jack had set out on a venture to find the treasure of Isla de Muerta, he lost the Pearl in a mutiny led by his first mate, Hector Barbossa, then marooned Jack on an island with a pistol and one bullet. Ten years later, with the help of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, Jack killed the cursed Captain Barbossa and retrieved the Black Pearl. Over a year later, Sparrow's old comrade Bootstrap Bill appeared to remind him that he owed Davy Jones his soul. Sparrow sought to seize the Dead Man's Chest to settle his debt, but despite his efforts, Elizabeth left Jack to Jones' leviathan, the Kraken, which dragged both captain and ship to the depths of Davy Jones' Locker. Following a desperate quest to rescue both Sparrow and the Pearl from the Locker led by the resurrected Captain Barbossa, the Brethren Court convened in one last stand against Lord Cutler Beckett, who had control over Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman, which led to a pirate showdown with the East India Company. Jack later sailed on stranger tides during the quest for the fabled Fountain of Youth. After being kidnapped and forced aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, Sparrow was forced to serve under Captain Blackbeard and his beautiful daughter Angelica, facing zombies, mermaids, and the Spanish. With the help of his nemesis and now privateer Hector Barbossa, Jack found the fountain and defeated Blackbeard. Later, pursued by the terrifying Captain Salazar and a cursed crew of deadly ghosts who escaped from the Devil's Triangle, a down-on-his-luck Captain Jack sought to reverse his recent spate of ill fortune by searching for the Trident of Poseidon. Sparrow's only hope of survival lied in Henry Turner, the gallant son of his allies Will and Elizabeth who sought to free his cursed father; and Carina Smyth, Barbossa's daughter and a brilliant astronomer accused of being a witch. In an uneasy alliance with Henry, Carina and Hector Barbossa, Sparrow was able to find the Trident and defeat Salazar.\n\nOver the course of time, Captain Jack Sparrow became a center of intrigue as myths and legends have been told of the famed pirate's exploits. Most of these tales, however, were exaggerations, or even fabrications, embellished by the indomitable trickster himself to bolster his reputation. He also navigated his way from one perilous adventure to another, enemies became allies and friends became foes. Indeed, despite his dishonesty and many deceptions, Jack did embark on a number of grand and thrilling adventures, some involving the supernatural, magic, and journeys in discovering hidden treasures of pirate lore. This crafty pirate valued his freedom and his ship above all else. Jack Sparrow's ultimate ambition was to sail the seas aboard the Black Pearl, drinking bottles of rum, and living the best life—the pirate's life.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn on a pirate ship in a typhoon,[9] Jack Sparrow was the son of Captain Edward Teague and an unknown woman,[4][3] and would be named after his uncle Jack.[39] Growing up in a tumultuous household full of outlaws at Shipwreck Cove, young Jack had spent most of his youth unsure whether Teague was really his parent, frequently referring to him as \"The-Man-Who-Might-Be-Dad\" even as a teenager. Despite his resentment, Jack respected the fact that Teague was always there for him when he needed him most, such as when Jack nearly got his hand cut off by the pirate Rusty Knickers at the age of six or when Jack was almost sold into servitude by Captain Lucille Graven at the age of twelve.[6] Jack was determined to follow in his enigmatic father's buccaneering footsteps and become a captain of a ship, rather than just some ordinary pirate like the majority of his relatives (explaining his insistence on being referred to as \"Captain\" well into adulthood). At some point during his childhood, Jack met a boy named Benny and taught him \"that trick with the kite and the key\".[40]\n\nAs a teenager, Jack served as a cabin boy on several pirate ships, including the Troubadour of Captain Teague and the Koldunya of Borya Palachnik.[12] As a member of Teague's crew, he visited many countries and ports, including Singapore.[41] However, he became fed up with his hectic life in a pirate family and the torture he suffered at the hands of his Grandmama. One night, he snuck by candlelight into the study to consult the Pirata Codex, and, coming upon a section on freedom and the need for pirates to make their own decisions, decided he was completely justified in running away. After escaping out the window, Jack stowed away aboard a merchant ship to reach Tortuga, where shortly after arriving he met Arabella Smith with whom he set on the adventure to find the Sword of Cortés.[19]\n\nThe Sword of Cortés\n\nJack had few worldly possessions, and even these were stolen on the island. In an attempt to reclaim his property, Jack accidentally stole a sack containing the scabbard of the Sword of Cortés from Captain Torrents, a vicious pirate captain with the ability to control storms. Learning of its magical nature from a barmaid named Arabella Smith, Jack set off to track down the Sword of Cortés itself.\n\nAfter Arabella led Jack to an abandoned ship, the Barnacle, he was given command; and, following a sword fight that Jack lost, found his second crew member in a young man named Fitzwilliam P. Dalton III. Having braved a storm conjured by Torrents, Jack, Arabella and Fitzwilliam soon encountered two more sailors, Tumen and Jean Magliore—the latter providing one further crew member in the form of his cat, Constance Magliore, who was once Jean's sister before being transformed by Tia Dalma.\n\nWith a ship and a crew, not to mention part of the treasure of Stone-Eyed Sam, a now-dead former pirate king with a fabled stone eye who was said to be holding the Sword, Captain Jack Sparrow set off to find the elusive Sword of Cortés. The crew was confronted by Captain Torrents, though Jack was able to counter his control of lightning by splashing him with rainwater collected in his appropriated hat. He claimed that he had taught little Benny this trick, and hoped he would remember it.[19]\n\nFight for freedom\n\nJack's crew later happened upon a group of mermaids whose song made most of the crew act upon their deepest desires. However, Jack proved immune to their song, since his only true desire was freedom. Unfortunately for Jack, poorly-thought-out negotiations with the Sirens' minions, the merfolk, forced him into a deal that would cost him the thing Jack valued most—his freedom—should he ever find the Sword of Cortés.[42] For the time being, he continued his search for the Sword, ultimately finding it in the possession of Left-Foot Louis on Isla Fortuna. Jack helped defeat Louis, and stopped Arabella from killing the pirate out of revenge for the supposed murder of her mother.[23]\n\nWith the Sword and its scabbard in his possession, Jack was able to recite an incantation that unlocked its power—but also caused the spirit of Hernán Cortés to materialize.[23] Jack, wishing to use the Sword's full power, was unaware that Cortés, in teaching Jack how to correctly wield the Sword, was ensuring he, Cortés, would ultimately regain control of the weapon for his own dastardly use. Jack was sent to collect the eye of Stone-Eyed Sam, recently given to the merfolk, meaning Jack was forced to return to Isla Sirena. There, he fought two iguana monsters for his freedom, and obtained the eye from Tia Dalma. Tia Dalma also reminded Jack that a dangerous foe was still pursuing him, a thought that Jack did not savor.[20]\n\nSparrow returned to Cortés, and unlocked the eye, freeing the spirit of Montecuhzoma, who fought and defeated Cortés. Jack decided to give the Sword to Tia Dalma, realizing it contained too much power to wield. After a further meeting with her, who warned him of dangers he would yet face, Jack and his crew set out for Yucatán Peninsula, home of Tumen, and further adventure.[20]\n\nThe Sun-and-Stars Medallion\n\nUnfortunately for Sparrow and his crew, Tumen's village held its own set of challenges. The crew became the main suspects when the Sun-and-stars amulet was stolen from the village, and were banished from the island. Jack resolved to track down the real culprits, whom they happened upon in a hotel in New Orleans. The thief, Madame Minuit, fought for possession of the amulet—a blow from which turning some of Jack's teeth bronze—though her slave, Tim Hawk, turned on her and helped Jack's crew escape. Jack welcomed him aboard the Barnacle.\n\nMoments later, the ship was confronted by the Fleur de la Mort, captained by Laura Smith, Arabella's long-lost mother. The crew was teleported aboard, where Jack was confronted by Silverback and Left-Foot Louis, both of whom launched an attack on Jack's crew. The fight was broken up by Laura, though Jack remained suspicious of both pirates, and eavesdropped on a conversation between them, uncovering their plans to mutiny against their captain. This led to a fight, during which Jack stole Silverback's gem, connecting it to his medallion and making both Silverback and Louis disappear. Jack was happy to return to the Barnacle, though Laura kept her daughter aboard the Fleur de la Mort.\n\nFollowing this, Jack returned to New Orleans, where he was confronted for a final time by Madame Minuit, Silverback and Louis, who merged to form a giant, three-headed serpent that Jack barely managed to defeat. Jack's teeth were turned into gold when the Sun-and-stars amulet was destroyed. With the battle won, Jack's crew decided to return to their respective homes, leaving only Jack and Fitzwilliam aboard the Barnacle. Suddenly, the vessel was confronted by the Flying Dutchman, and Jack met Davy Jones for the first time.[43]\n\nThe Dance of the Hours\n\nDavy Jones was after Fitzwilliam's watch, which was able to stop time. Using the watch's power, Jack and Dalton escaped to a nearby island. After wandering for a few days, they were captured by angry natives and sacrificed to Chantico. They escaped again using the Timekeeper and ran to an Aztec temple. There, they discovered that they were on Isla Esquelética while Stone-Eyed Sam still reigned as king. They were captured and taken to Stone-Eyed Sam. Once again they escaped using the Timekeeper and escaped the temple.\n\nBy now the island was completely disrupted: there were prehistoric creatures roaming around; Stone-Eyed Sam was very much alive and in control of the Sword of Cortés; and, to make matters worse, Captain Torrents was around and wanted his revenge on Jack. After escaping being killed by the lava of the island's volcano, Jack and Fitzwilliam were told by Chantico that they had twelve hours to set everything back to normal or she would kill them. After getting down the volcano by hitching a ride on the pterodactyl, the two of them needed magic of Tia Dalma's kind and headed back to the Barnacle by traveling underwater with an overturned boat over their heads for air. Once they were on the Barnacle, they were quickly captured by Davy Jones and thrown into the brig of the Flying Dutchman where they ran into Tia Dalma who helped them get out and gave them a clue as to how to return time back to normal - the watch had to be in the possession of someone who didn't exist in the present time and also that the person had to drop the watch when it chimed twelve. After getting back to the island, and realizing that there was only one hour left, a sword fight started between Stone-Eyed Sam and Torrents for control of the Sword of Cortés. During their fight, Jack realized that he had to get Sam to hold the watch to set everything back so he got the attention of both him and Torrents when Jack remembered that both of them wanted revenge on him. Things escalated into a three-way sword fight with the Sword of Cortés changing hands several times and time running out. Jack carefully threw the watch so that it wrapped around Sam's wrist as the watch started chiming. Just as Jack was knocked down and Sam was about to kill him, the watch chimed for the twelfth time and Tia Dalma pulled it off Sam's wrist, which resulted in time being quickly set back to normal and Stone-Eyed Sam turning into a skeleton, the buildings crumbling into rubble, and the plant life of the jungle taking over. After Tia Dalma met with Davy Jones and Chantico, while surprising Jack and Fitzwilliam by bowing to her, Jack noticed a pirate ship in the distance and panicked. Both he and Fitzwilliam got back to the Barnacle where they saw that the pirate ship was being chased by British Royal Navy ships as well as East India Trading Company ships. Fitzwilliam then held his sword to Jack's back and revealed that he had been working with the Navy in an attempt to track down Jack's father, Captain Edward Teague, in order to arrest and hang him.[27]\n\nSins of the Father\n\nFitzwilliam P. Dalton III is really working for the Royal Navy as a spy and has led Admiral Lawrence Norrington and the whole Royal Navy, to Jack and his father, Captain Teague (Keeper of the Code), himself. Jack and his father are taken off of Teague's ship, the Misty Lady, and sent to the brig of Norrington's ship. Aboard the ship is a rum-lover and ally of Teague's, Joshamee Gibbs. He frees Jack, Teague, and his crew. Jack boards the Barnacle to take off a Royal Navy flag and to sail away when Fitzwilliam shows up and they then battle rapidly back and forth. When Jack finally wins, he's about to kill Fitzy when his father stops him. The Royal Navy then wakes up and begins to attack The Misty Lady. Meanwhile, Fitzwilliam somehow follows Teague's commands and the three of them end up on the Admiral's ship once more. The aristocrat then turns in Teague and Jack, who are hiding behind barrels. A fight breaks out between the two crews and Jack and Fitzy take at it one more time. Teague and the Admiral fight and when Teague successfully knocks down the Admiral, his son, James Norrington, is frightened and backs up only to fall overboard. Teague rescues James and his father chastises him about being saved by a pirate. Teague tells Jack that Fitzy only did as he was told because of his ring which makes anyone do anything you'd like. He gives Jack the ring and then takes him to Isle Hermosa. In the story's epilogue, Jack gets a new boat, which is only large enough for one or two people, and sets sail for a new treasure.[6]\n\nPoseidon's Peak\n\nAfter acquiring a new boat, Jack sets off to find the fabled Poseidon's Peak and the treasure it holds. He arrives on a deserted island and runs into a sailor who is badly hurt and has amnesia. Following a night of fitful dreams the sailor remembers that his name is Bill and the two of them trek inland to find any clues to where Poseidon's Peak might be. Before long the two are captured by the natives, with Bill inexplicably able to translate what they're saying and are challenge to fight for their lives. Jack cheats and the both of them run into someone very familiar, Constance Magliore, who the natives worship since she swam out of the sea.\n\nAfter getting away from the natives, Jack has the idea of lashing logs together to make a raft to escape the island and while they search, they unearth a chariot covered in sea life. They get on the chariot and it prompt takes them out to sea where the jump off it before it submerges and end up on a small rock in the middle of the ocean. Jack, in a fit of anger, tosses Constance off the rock which causes her to lead them to an underwater cavern. Constance proceeds to lead them through tunnels that seem to go in circles until Jack meets a group of people that are very familiar to him, the former crew of the Barnacle (sans Fitzwilliam), along with Arabella's mother and her crew.\n\nJack was especially glad to see Arabella and opens his arms to hug her, thinking that she was running to greet him, but was in fact heading for Billy Turner, whom she kisses. Bill, who has regained the rest of his memories, says that he was rescued by Captain Smith's ship sometime after they had split from Jack. Not too long after this, they were abducted by the group of mermaids, who were hoping to find Jack by using them. Captain Laura Smith and her crew were then imprisoned in the cell inside Poseidon's Peak. They managed to break free on their own soon after, but got lost in the tunnels inside. It is not clear when exactly, but at that time Bill Turner was separated from the rest of them and shot through the tunel to the island not far from the Peak, where Jack stumbles onto his injured and bloodied person. It just so happened that Jack's reunion with the former crew of the Barnacle now captained by Laura, ended up happening in the chamber full of treasure where the Trident of Poseidon was supposed to be located, but was not there at all. Instead from the waters around the pedestal emmerged three blue-tailed mermaids: Morveren, Aquila and Aquala who requested of Jack to take back the Trident, saying that he was their only hope to be free, but Jack refused. Shortly after that an unwanted face shows up riding the chariot and wielding the Trident: Captain Torrents[44].\n\nBold New Horizons\n\nTorrents uses the power of the Trident to crack the walls of the cavern, flooding it with ocean water around the Peak, and leaves Jack and his compatriots for certain death riding away in the chariot. In order to survive Jack tries to negotiate with the tree blue-tailed sirens: Moreveren, Aquala and Aquila, but they refuse to help the people who didn't take them on their offer to go to war with Torrents for them, and leave. When cavern fills fully with water, Jack discovers the way which the mermaids used to exit the cavern and leads the rest through it, saving Laura Smith and her crew from dying. All of them end at the rocky precipice above the chamber in which Jack first met the mermaids on Isla Sirena, from where they overhear their conversation about how blue-tails were using power of the Trident for thousands of years to enslave the rest of the merfolk.\n\nAfter Jack accidentally pushes down some rocks, all three discover them and use their song in order to kill them. Unfortunately for them some of the members of the crew - Arabella Smith, Bill Turner, and eventually Jack himself - current desire was to take them down for their tyrany, which eventually ended the fight that ensued between the two groups. Defeated mermaids agree to release Jack, Laura and their crew near the Fleur de la Mort, thanks to what all of them land on the deserted island, where they are then promptly attacked by Torrents' merfolk army. Thinking that blue-tails betrayed them, Jack, Laura and the rest are forced to fight, but soon Jack realizes that whatever he can't say about Morveren, Aquila and Aquala they always kept their word. He then steals Laura's compass from her and uses it to find the invisible ship just behind them, further into the island. Knowing that they can't defeat the monstrous and hideous army of merfolk they all retreat to the Fleur, where they find Captain Torrents. Jack stands to the side when Laura and the crew of the Fleur challenges Torrents in a fight, only to see them all defeated at his hand. As the only man standing Jack is forced to duel Torrents. He eventually wins when he takes away the Trident and uses it's power to push the pirate overboard straight into the water full of angry merfolk. As the new King of the Merfolk Jack releases them from the power that Trident holds over them and then leaves them all in capable hands of Tonra - whom he calls his first mate on Isla Sirena and entrusts with responsibility over his race in Jack's absence, only to then come back to the Fleur and continue sailing with the crew for some time.[13]\n\nYoung Pirate\n\nJack the Sparrow\n\nFollowing his teenage adventures, Jack bartered a magical compass from Tia Dalma.[12] However, the compass somehow found its way into the hands of Morgan, the pirate captain of the Wicked Wench, whose crew Jack eventually joined, finally embracing the pirate life. It was around that time that the notorious Capitán Armando Salazar of the Spanish Navy decided to exterminate piracy in the Caribbean, to avenge the deaths of his father and grandfather. With their powerful galleon, the Silent Mary, Salazar and his crew sank dozens of pirate ships.[5]\n\nFacing extermination, the last pirates in the Caribbean joined forces in an attempt to stop the formidable Salazar, but in a fierce battle off the coast of the mysterious Devil's Triangle the Spaniards destroyed most of the pirate fleet, showing no mercy. The Wicked Wench was the last remaining pirate ship, and her dying captain gave his compass to Jack, explaining its power with his last breath. When the compass pointed toward the Triangle, Jack quickly formulated a plan how to defeat Salazar.[5]\n\nClimbing into the crow's nest, Jack shouted through the smoke to Salazar, mockingly telling the Spanish pirate hunter that he will be spared if he surrenders immediately. Laughing and sliding down the halyard on deck, the young boy defiantly raised the black pirate flag, earning the name that haunted Salazar, \"Jack the Sparrow.\" He took the helm, steering the Wicked Wench toward the Triangle. Just as Jack expected, the Silent Mary, with Salazar at the helm, quickly followed the pirate vessel into the unknown waters. As the Wench approached the entrance into the Triangle, Jack ordered the pirates to throw ropes around the nearby reefs off the port side of the ship. The loop caught the reef, tightening, and causing the ship to swiftly turn to the left, as Jack Sparrow steered the Wench in the same direction, changing the ship's course at the last moment.[5]\n\nThe Silent Mary stayed on her course, sailing straight ahead after the Wicked Wench. As the Spanish warship sailed past the pirate ship Jack glanced at Salazar one last time before the malicious pirate hunter entered the Triangle. The Silent Mary quickly hit the nearby rocks which resulted in a massive explosion that killed Salazar's entire crew and sank the ship. With the battle over, every surviving pirate in the Wench's crew gave Jack one item as a tribute, including a tricorne hat.[5]\n\nReturn to Shipwreck Cove\n\nJack eventually returned to Shipwreck Cove where he became known to all Pirate Lords, even though Teague wasn't yet prepared to officially recognize Jack as his son. Despite that, Jack joined Teague on several voyages on his ship, the Troubadour. Jack also became a good friend with the French pirate captain Christophe-Julien de Rapièr.\n\nWhen some mysterious pirate ships began to attack both merchant ships and pirate ships, a meeting was held in the Pirate Hall in Shipwreck City. Although he wasn't invited, Jack entered the chamber where some of the Pirate Lords convened because he was interested in meeting Esmeralda, with whom he developed a friendship, and her grandfather Don Rafael, the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean. Jack also met Hector Barbossa, a pirate captain whose ship, the Cobra, was destroyed by these mysterious rogue pirates.[12]\n\nBreaking the Code\n\nA few months later, Jack discovered which ship had destroyed Barbossa's ship. It was the sloop Koldunya, captained by Boris \"Borya\" Palachnik, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea. Thanks to Jack's information, Barbossa also identified the ship. To quickly solve the case, Captain Teague summoned Davy Jones, the Lord of the sea, who identified Borya as the leader of the rogues. Trapped, Borya revealed the names of other rogue captains, identifying Christophe as one of them. The rogues were quickly imprisoned in the dungeons of Shipwreck City. However, Jack believed that Christophe was innocent, and so he helped him escape. But by doing this, he broke the Pirate Code, making himself an outlaw in the eyes of the Brethren. During their escape from Shipwreck Island, Christophe's rogues kidnapped Jack, taking him with them.[12]\n\nEscape from the rogues\n\nPress-ganged into a service on La Vipère, Jack involuntarily served under Christophe for a few weeks. Christophe even started to make plans for making his own fleet, and he asked Jack to join him as captain of one of his vessels. Jack participated in the Attack on the Dutch flute, and after the battle, he met Pharaoh Taharka, the ruler of the mythical island of Kerma. Mortally wounded, the old Pharaoh gave Jack the magical talisman. Christophe took the talisman from Jack, and decided to find Kerma. Not wanting Jack with him anymore, Christophe left him in a longboat on the open sea. Robert Greene, a young pirate onboard La Vipère, jumped into the sea and joined Jack in the boat. After they reached land, they joined the East India Trading Company. For the next five years, Jack faithfully served the Company, sailing across all the Seven Seas, eventually reaching the rank of First Mate.[12]\n\nThe East India Trading Company\n\nFirst Mate\n\nWhen he was 25 years old, Jack sailed aboard the EITC brig Fair Wind as the First Mate under Captain Nathaniel Bainbridge. When Bainbridge was killed in a battle with pirates led by Jack's old love interest Esmeralda, now a Pirate Lord of the Caribbean, Jack took command of the Fair Wind and managed to save the ship and most of its cargo from falling into the hands of Esmeralda's pirates. Cutler Beckett, an EITC Director for West Africa, was so impressed, that he offered him to take command of Marlin, a slave ship of the Company, as her captain. But Sparrow refused to transport slaves, so Beckett gave him command of the Wicked Wench, a merchant vessel of the Company.[12]\n\nCaptain Sparrow\n\nJack Sparrow and the Wicked Wench were an unbeatable team, and Jack sailed on many voyages for the Company. One day, Beckett proposed to Jack that he'd organize a search for the lost island of Kerma, as well as the Shining City of Zerzura with its treasure-filled labyrinth. Jack embarked on a voyage, while assisted by Beckett's house slave, Ayisha, who was actually princess Amenirdis, a member of the Kerman royal family.[12]\n\nJack and Ayisha sailed for the Bahamas, where they liberated Ayisha's brother, prince Shabako because Ayisha refused to give Jack the location of the island until her brother was safe. After they sailed back for Africa, the Wench was attacked by Boris Palachnik's rogue pirates. Ayisha's magic destroyed the pirate ship, but the Wicked Wench was badly damaged. Jack and his crew were saved by Esmeralda, whose crew helped Jack to repair his ship. A few days later, with the help of his compass, Jack found Christophe-Julien de Rapièr, whose help he needed to open the gates of the Zerzuran labyrinth.[12]\n\nThe Wench and La Vipère sailed for Kerma, where Jack, Amenirdis, and Christophe entered the labyrinth. They found the treasure, and Jack tricked Christophe into taking a rock instead of the Heart of Zerzura. Beliving that he has the famous jewel, Christophe sailed off. Jack, who had developed an attraction towards Amenirdis, decided not to reveal the location of Kerma to Beckett, due to knowing that Beckett would enslave the inhabitants of the legendary island.[12]\n\nA few days later, the Wench returned to Calabar. Beckett, angry that Sparrow had betrayed him, ordered Sparrow to carry a cargo of slaves to New Avalon in the Bahamas for Viscount Penwallow, Beckett's immediate supervisor and patron. Beckett promised to sell Jack the Wench for just one shilling. Jack Sparrow set off with the Wicked Wench's hold filled with slaves following his pick up, but he couldn't stand the idea of humans beings as \"cargo,\" so he resolved to free them instead. Sparrow liberated the slaves and stole the Wench from Beckett, then sailed back to illusion-hidden Kerma, and the island's ruler, Pharaoh Shabako, agreed to give the slaves asylum there. Furious at being disobeyed, Cutler Beckett sent five EITC ships after Jack, and when he finally caught him, had Jack thrown into prison.[12]\n\nAn outlaw\n\nAfter languishing for a couple of months, Beckett ordered Jack to be brought within sight of the Wicked Wench about a mile off the coast of Western Africa. Beckett and his operative, Ian Mercer, branded Jack with a \"P\" brand on his right forearm, marking him forever as a pirate. Then Beckett ordered his ship to fire on the anchored Wicked Wench, using inflammable \"carcass charges.\" Seeing his beloved Wench in flames, Jack Sparrow broke free from his captors, dived into the ocean and swam for his ship, hoping to rescue her. But it was lost, as Jack was trapped in his own cabin and went down with his sunken ship. Neither dead nor alive, Jack found himself in a strange place. Knowing that he was on the path to the Land of the Dead, Jack spoke a magical incantation, which allowed him to summon Davy Jones, the lord of the sea.[12]\n\nJack Sparrow and Davy Jones then struck a bargain. In exchange for the restoration of the Wicked Wench, Jack promised to give up his position as captain of the ship in thirteen years time so as to serve for a century aboard Jones' ship, the Flying Dutchman. Jones agreed and raised Jack's ship from the depths. Jack, however, had no intention of keeping his end of the bargain, having become too attached to his beloved ship and not wanting to serve anyone. Inspired by the Biblical parable of \"the pearl of great price\", he rechristened the Wicked Wench as the Black Pearl, and set out for a life of adventure as a pirate.[45] By this time, Jack had \"the mark of the sparrow\"[14] tattooed on his arm to better identify himself to others as Captain Jack Sparrow.[1]\n\nCaptain of the Black Pearl\n\nPirate's life anew\n\nNot much is known about Jack Sparrow after he became captain of the Black Pearl. When Captain Teague left the Brethren Court, only retaining his status as Keeper of the Code, he gave his seat to his son Jack.[46] But instead of becoming a Pirate Lord of Madagascar, Jack Sparrow became the new Lord of the Caribbean Sea.[14] He tied his piece of eight into his hair, letting it dangle over his trademark bandanna. With the Black Pearl under his command, Jack recruited a crew in Tortuga. Among the crew, Jack named Hector Barbossa as his First Mate.[1]\n\nAt some point, seafaring folk told a tale of how the vile pirate Jolly Roger tried to trick Captain Jack Sparrow into gambling away his seat on the Pirate Brethren Court and got cursed instead. A merciless soul and henchmen of the Pirate Brethren, Jolly Roger performed unsavory deeds when the Court did not want to soil their hands or reputations. Despite this, Jack Sparrow and Jolly Roger were friends, though Jolly was always envious of Jack's uncanny luck. As Jack's reputation grew, so did Jolly's resentment. Although Jolly Roger wanted to be voted onto the prestigious Court, Jolly vowed revenge when Teague gave his seat to Jack. Knowing Jack was a card lover, Jolly invited him to a game of poker. Jolly had to cheat to win so he conspired with Amo Dorsi, a villainous Voodoo Witch Doctor, to deal the cards. Jolly won hand after hand. Soon, Jack was out of money and he bet his piece of eight for one last hand. He won, and Jolly, thinking he'd been double-crossed, shot his partner in crime. Jack threw the table up, tossing cards and gold everywhere, and disappeared in the confusion. With his dying breath, Amo Dorsi cursed Jolly Roger to walk the earth as the undead, transforming him into a skeletal beast. Jolly swore vengeance against Sparrow and the Brethren Court, and became a leader of an undead legion.[46]\n\nThe Shadow Lord's threat\n\nWhen the evil supernatural alchemist, the Shadow Lord, created the Shadow Gold, a special liquid that grants him unfathomable power, and threatened to destroy the Pirate Lords of the Brethren Court, Jack was sent by Tia Dalma on a mission to recover nine pieces of Shadow Gold in order to stop the Shadow Lord's Shadow Army. During his journey around the world, Jack went to Asia and Europe, fighting with powerful organizations like the East India Trading Company and bands of thieves like the Fourth Estate. With the help of the Pirate Lords, Jack was able to collect all the pieces of Shadow Gold and defeat the Shadow Lord once and for all.\n\nMutiny on the Black Pearl\n\nAfter the defeat of the Shadow Lord, the treasure of Cortés would again play a part in Jack's pirate life, as he and the crew of the Black Pearl embarked upon a quest to find a cache of Aztec gold stashed by Cortés. However, before the treasure was found, the crew mutinied that night. Led by Barbossa, the crew marooned Jack on a desert island with nothing more than a flintlock pistol with a single shot for him to kill himself. Barbossa believed it would be the last they would see of Jack Sparrow.[1]\n\nHowever, Jack merely resigned to his fate and discovered that the island was a secret cache for a group of rumrunners and for the next three days Jack cavorted with them, and likely suffered little more than a severe hangover before bartering for passage off the island. This misadventure helped to build upon Jack's reputation in the Caribbean, helped along by Jack's outlandish exaggerations as to the circumstances of his escape; one version of events saw Sparrow use human hair from his back to rope a couple of sea turtles as a raft to flee the island. Jack kept his single-shot pistol, making no modifications to it, but rather keeping it with the intent to use it upon his mutinous First Mate, Barbossa.[1]\n\nIt was believed that Jack's altruistic nature may have been part of the reason why his crew mutinied; indeed, Barbossa would later note that Jack's attempts at non-violent solutions to problems was exactly the attitude that lost him the Black Pearl. Whatever the reason, the mutiny was not a unanimous agreement among the crew of the Black Pearl.\n\nDeath would not come quickly for any of the crew of the Pearl. After leaving Jack marooned, Barbossa's men found the Aztec gold, but their treasure, which was soon frittered away on drink and food and pleasurable company, came at a price. They became cursed men, where in the moonlight, they were shown for what they really are: walking neither alive nor dead, and unable to live as normal men. William \"Bootstrap Bill\" Turner, for one, disagreed with Barbossa's decision to maroon Jack. But he, too would suffer Barbossa's wrath; after sending his cursed coin to his son with the belief that they deserved to be cursed and remain cursed, \"Bootstrap\" was tied to a cannon and plunged into the ocean depths, apparently to his death. Later, Barbossa and the crew of the Pearl learned that all 882 pieces of Cortés's treasure had to be returned and repaid in blood.\n\nEscaping the island\n\nJack was the only member of the crew not to be affected by the curse, since he had already been abandoned by the hands of Barbossa. However, he heard tales of the curse placed upon his former crewmen, which possibly fueled his desire to achieve immortality as well as eternal freedom to sail the seas. Jack later bartered with rumrunners to gain passage off of Rumrunner's Isle.[21]\n\nThe rumrunners transported Jack to the town of Port Royal. Upon his arrival, Jack was penniless and had no coin to his name. Determined to find a ship to captain, Jack was given advice by the local innkeeper who told him of local tax money being guarded around town by the city watch. Jack pilfered the money and bought himself a a small sloop.[21]\n\nJack took an entirely new crew, and he spent much of his time plundering merchantmen out of Jamaica. Though he was hardly the most fearsome pirate on the Spanish Main, he did make a good name for himself in and around Port Royal, even going as far to find a local treasure of legend, belonging to none other than the local tavern keeper's late grandfather (the innkeeper urged Jack to find it and keep it for himself).[21]\n\nJack crossed paths with the blind pirate sightless Sam. Sparrow would later captain a Corvette and a galleon. He also acquired a herb and helped cure the governor. The governor later sent him on a number of missions, including repelling an attack by undead pirates looking to kill sightless Sam. Jack later searched Aztec ruins in Hispaniola.[21]\n\nOther legendary adventures\n\nIt is unknown exactly when some of Captain Jack Sparrow's other adventures had occurred, though it is possible it was within the time he was captain of the Black Pearl, if not in the years after. Regardless, Jack's pirate life was the subject of many myths, legends and rumors about his exploits, some of which were most likely mis-truths possibly made up by Sparrow himself to bolster his reputation. It was believed that Jack Sparrow became chief of the cannibalistic Pelegostos Tribe in the years prior to meeting Elizabeth Swann, a tale he later relayed to Mullroy and Murtogg at Port Royal,[1] picking up their language which he again used during his second visit to the Pelegostos to escape the Kraken years later.[11] At some point, Jack met Angelica, a novice from a Spanish convent near Seville who the pirate supposedly seduced and corrupted, thus introducing her to the life of piracy. But their relationship didn't end well as Angelica tried to kill Jack in Saint Dominique.[3]\n\nMore of the notable stories included the legend of how Captain Jack Sparrow vanished from under the eyes of seven agents of the East India Company and sacked Nassau Port without firing a single shot. One possible, though unconfirmed exploit included sinking a French war galleon with nothing but his cutlass and a diving bell. In full, Jack's noted crimes against the Crown included piracy, smuggling, falsification of Letters of Marque and Reprisal, impersonating an officer of the British Royal Navy, impersonating an officer of the Spanish Royal Navy, impersonating a cleric of the Church of England, sailing under false colors, arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching, brigandage, pilfering, depravity, depredation, and general lawlessness.[1]\n\nRegarding the legend of Jack Sparrow's sacking of Nassau, a version of the tale as told by Jack himself detailed of how Sparrow arrived to the \"lovely town\" but picked a rueful time to visit, as the town came under siege by Black Smoke James, who was desirous to appoint himself magistrate of the island. As Jack encountered the magistrate in his mansion, where he barricaded himself, the magistrate mistook Jack to be James himself, so Jack took the advantage and ordered for all of his people to leave and leave the island to him. Throughout this event, Jack Sparrow rescued several endangered villagers from the attackers, escorting them to a boat at the harbor where the magistrate gave \"Black Smoke James\" Letters of Marque signed by the Queen, and fought the real Black Smoke James aboard the King George's Amnesty. After Black Smoke James was defeated, he swore revenge on Jack as he disappeared. An exaggerated version of this story was later told by Jack Sparrow to Hector Barbossa, which in itself was a tale told at an execution led by Alberto Chaves. This series of events featured Elizabeth Swann, who Jack Sparrow had not met at this time, accompanying him in the fight against Black Smoke James.[15]\n\nRegaining the Pearl\n\nStealing and selling\n\nAfter ten years had passed since the mutiny against him, Captain Jack Sparrow became an infamous pirate of the Seven Seas, but he still wanted the Black Pearl as his own. Through unknown circumstances, Jack spent time with Anamaria before leaving her, in which he stole her boat, the Jolly Mon—or, as the pirate himself put it, \"borrowed without permission, but with every intention of bringing it back\".[1] With his new boat, Jack Sparrow was free to sail the seas, ultimately ending up at Shipwreck City.\n\nAt some point, Jack Sparrow traded Scarlett and Giselle fair and square to the Auctioneer, who wanted brides to sell. The auction took place on the very night where both wenches, separately, believed they were to marry Jack Sparrow. By the time they learn of Jack's deceit, the auction started and Jack sailed away on the Jolly Mon. Jack's trickery caused a great deal of trouble for the Auctioneer and his clients, particularly Mungard. Before Jack Sparrow left Shipwreck City, Scarlett would have already taken four nails off of the Jolly Mon, just in case Jack had cold feet about their supposed wedding.[48] This caused the boat to leak in a few areas, which forced Jack to make the nearest port so he could find a ship more suitable to continue his quest.\n\nArriving to Port Royal\n\nThe Jolly Mon plowed towards Port Royal, while Jack stood on the rigging, gazing keen-eyed at the harbor. Noticing that his boat was filling up with water, he jumped down to bail it out. Jack then spotted skeletal remains of three pirates, still clad in buccaneer rags, hanging from gallows erected from a rocky promontory along with a fourth unoccupied gallows bearing a sign that said \"Pirates Ye Be Warned\". Pausing, Jack Sparrow took off his hat and placed it above his heart—a moment of exaggerated respect for the doomed pirates as he sailed by them. As Jack reached the port, his boat kept sinking lower and lower until he made it to the docks, where only the mast was visible above water. Jack offered the harbormaster three shillings to ensure his name did not appear on the ledger. The Harbormaster accepted this bribe, though did not notice Jack stealing his purse before the pirate swaggered away to find a suitable ship for him to sail on.[1]\n\nStriding through the docks to \"commandeer\" the Interceptor, Jack Sparrow was accosted by two royal marines, Mullroy and Murtogg, who were assigned to guard the Interceptor and make sure the docks stay off limits to civilians. The two marines and Jack soon engage in idle conversation before they were interrupted by a young lady falling from Fort Charles. Despite his piratical nature, Jack was not about to let the girl, Elizabeth Swann, drown, and dived into the ocean to rescue her. Bringing her up to the harbor, Jack tore off her corset, allowing her to breathe; he then spied a strange coin fastened around her neck, one of the pieces of Aztec gold Barbossa's men were seeking. However, before he could explore the situation further, Commodore James Norrington arrived to arrest Sparrow.[1]\n\nDespite having saved Governor Weatherby Swann's daughter, Elizabeth Swann, Commodore Norrington saw Jack's mark from the East India Trading Company. The Governor then ordered Jack to be hanged. However, Jack held Elizabeth hostage, ensuring the return of his effects before making his daring escape. With Norrington's men in pursuit, Jack sought refuge in a blacksmith's shop, where he cut his manacles. However, he was soon confronted by the blacksmith's apprentice, William Turner, whose face Sparrow vaguely recognized, who engaged the pirate in a sword fight. Sparrow won, through a mixture of skill and pirate trickery, but Turner refused to stand down. Jack was resolute he would not shoot Turner, thus wasting his single shot, and was preoccupied enough with this quandary for John Brown to knock him unconscious.[1]\n\nWhen Sparrow came to, he found himself incarcerated in Fort Charles, which soon came under attack by a fog-shrouded pirate ship, the Black Pearl, as Jack immediately identified it. During the fight, as Jack was luring the Prison Dog to him, the pirates Koehler and Twigg happened upon Jack's cell, and inadvertently revealed to Jack the existence of the curse of Cortés upon Barbossa's men. Jack remained in the cell throughout the attack, but, the next morning, was visited again; this time by Will Turner, who made a deal with Jack to help him reach the Black Pearl's port and rescue the captive Elizabeth. Jack agreed, and immediately set about acquiring a ship.[1]\n\nEscape to Tortuga\n\nAfter escaping the prison, Jack Sparrow and Will Turner planned to commandeer the Royal Navy's flagship, HMS Dauntless, in order to commandeer Norrington's faster ship, the Interceptor. Sparrow and Turner used cunning and guile to board and commandeer the Dauntless, which was summarily boarded by Norrington's men. However, the pirates slipped away, unnoticed, and boarded the Interceptor. They then used it to flee Port Royal and leaving the Dauntless with its rudder chain disabled. The two pirates headed for Tortuga to find a crew for the Interceptor, for they can't crew one ship on their own.[1]\n\nAfter arriving to Tortuga, and some less-than pleasant reunions with two jealous prostitutes, Scarlett and Giselle, Jack tracked down his old friend, Joshamee Gibbs. Jack explained to Gibbs his plan to follow the Black Pearl's trail to Isla de Muerta, and to use Will as leverage to reacquire the Pearl from Barbossa. Gibbs agreed to the plan and helped Jack assemble a crew. After an interesting reunion with Anamaria, Jack and his new crew set sail on the Interceptor, following Jack's navigation by his strange compass to Isla de Muerta.[1]\n\nAt some point during the journey, the Interceptor encountered the British merchant vessel Earl King, captained by McGlue. Jack and Will disguised as Royal Navy officers and boarded the King, but Captain McGlue realized that they're pirates. The crew of the Interceptor boarded the King, captured the entire crew, and looted the ship.[49]\n\nIsla de Muerta\n\nThanks to the Interceptor's speed, the crew arrived at Isla de Muerta just after the Black Pearl, and Jack and Will went ashore. There, Jack witnessed the start of the ritual that Barbossa hoped would lift the curse, but complications arose in the shape of Will, who was far too impatient for Jack's liking. Jack implored Will to remain where he was so that Jack could implement his plan, but Will rashly knocked Jack unconscious and rescued Elizabeth himself. Turner took the girl back to the Interceptor, where he admitted Jack had fallen behind. Having sworn to keep to the Pirate's Code, Gibbs ordered the crew to set sail.[1]\n\nMeanwhile, Jack had woken up, and found himself surrounded by Barbossa's pirates. Invoking the right of parley, Jack was brought before Barbossa, and made a deal with him to procure the person whose blood would lift their curse, for Elizabeth's blood had had no effect. Jack was brought along as the pirates set sail to pursue the Interceptor, and found himself aboard his former ship for the first time in ten years.[1]\n\nBattle with the Black Pearl\n\nIn the captain's cabin of the Black Pearl, Jack and Barbossa were negotiating about how and when Jack will reveal the name of the person's blood that Barbossa needs. When Barbossa expressed his mistrust in Jack's honesty, the former captain of the Black Pearl replied that of the two of them he was the only one who hadn't committed a mutiny, which meant his word was to be trusted. He also sarcastically thanked his former first mate for raising a mutiny that unintentionally saved him from being cursed by the Aztec gold like him.[1] There is also a version of events in which Jack told Barbossa the story about how he sacked Nassau without firing a single shot, and Barbossa declared it a lovely yarn, but he didn't believe a word of it.[15] To Jack's dismay, the Bo'sun of the Pearl came in and told Barbossa that they were close to the Interceptor. However, when he suggested to Barbossa that he attempt a negotiation with the Interceptor's crew, Jack was locked in the brig. As Barbossa said, that was the kind of attitude that had lost Sparrow the Pearl in the first place.[1]\n\nJack witnessed the ensuing battle from within his cell, but when a stray shot smashed the lock, he was able to return to the deck, and slyly helped his crew in the fight. Noticing Barbossa's monkey making off with the medallion, Jack gave chase, and once more found himself face-to-face with Barbossa aboard the Pearl. This time, Barbossa was not so lenient, and made Jack walk the plank. Accompanied by Elizabeth, Sparrow had no choice but to make for Rumrunner's Isle, the island he had been marooned on ten years earlier. Fortunately, Barbossa allowed Jack to keep his pistol, still with its single shot.[1]\n\nMarooned\n\nJack sadly noted to Elizabeth that it was the second time he had to watch as Barbossa sailed off with his beloved ship while stranded. With the rumrunners no longer operational, Jack had no plan of escape. Elizabeth then questioned Jack and his legends, after being told the truth about his last escape. Jack then responded by giving her rum. However, Elizabeth proved more cunning than Jack had expected. After getting him drunk and passed out, after singing \"A Pirate's Life for Me\", she proceeded to burn the rum caché. It was through the smoke signal that she hoped the ensuing fire would attract attention to the Royal Navy. Jack rubbished the plan, tempted to even shoot Elizabeth had he possessed more than one shot. But a short time later, help did indeed arrive in the form of the Dauntless, and both Jack and Elizabeth were rescued. This caused Jack to comment that Elizabeth would be impossible to live with.[1]\n\nDeal with Barbossa\n\nOn board, Jack and Elizabeth persuaded Commodore Norrington to set after the Black Pearl and rescue Will, though yet again Jack had his own agenda. He coerced Norrington into allowing him to go ashore alone, and Jack once again confronted Barbossa in the treasure cave, just as the ritual began for a second time, this time with Will as the sacrifice. Jack stalled the proceedings and was able to convince \"Commodore\" Barbossa and the cursed crew to defeat Norrington before lifting their curse. During their negotiations, Jack managed to secretly steal one of the cursed coins from the stone chest. Barbossa sent all but a few of his men to attack the Royal Navy forces outside, while he, Jack and Will remained in the cave. It was at this point that Jack showed his true colors.[1]\n\nThe Immortal Captain Jack Sparrow\n\nStealing a sword from one of Barbossa's men, Jack threw the blade to Will, who fought Barbossa's men. At the same time, Jack pulled his sword out and engaged his former First Mate in a deadly duel, in which Barbossa seemed to gain the upper hand. The fight led them around the cave, until Barbossa cut it short by declaring that, as an immortal, Jack could not kill him. Sparrow tried anyway, but Barbossa merely sighed at the sword plunged into his body, and responded in kind, stabbing Jack in the gut. Victory was denied, however, when Jack stumbled backwards into a shaft of moonlight, transforming into a skeleton before Barbossa's shocked eyes. Holding aloft the medallion he had taken, Jack grinned triumphantly at his nemesis, and began the duel anew.[1]\n\nThe duel seemed endless, although quite pointless, since both captains were immortal. When asked if they were to engage in this single duel until Judgement Day, Jack suggested that Barbossa could surrender. By this time, Elizabeth had joined Will in the cave, and, working together, they had dispatched the remaining cursed pirates. Noticing Will standing over the chest, Jack quickly cut his hand with his sword, staining his medallion with his blood and hurling it to Will, who did the same with his coin. Barbossa aimed at Elizabeth but Jack finally used his single shot, firing it into Barbossa's heart. Barbossa taunted him over a wasted shot but Will revealed his own bloody coin and dropped both the coins into the chest. Barbossa then realized he had been defeated before toppling backwards, dead.[1]\n\nAvenged and the curse now lifted from him, Jack set about searching through the treasure cave for items of particular value. However, upon his return to the open water, he discovered his crew had already departed on the Black Pearl, after Elizabeth had failed to convince them to stay and help in the fight. Jack had no choice but to accompany the Royal Navy back to Port Royal.[1]\n\nFreedom\n\nArriving to Port Royal, Jack was sentenced to be executed at the gallows, for his crimes, to be hanged. He grimly awaited his fate in the courtyard of Fort Charles. However, Will Turner was also present, and staged a daring rescue of his comrade. Together, the two pirates fought Commodore Norrington's soldiers, but were ultimately surrounded by Royal Navy soldiers, Norrington, and Governor Swann. It was only when Elizabeth interference and decision to stand with them that Governor Swann ordered the soldiers to stand down and lower their weapons.[1]\n\nSeizing his chance, and noticing a familiar parrot flying nearby, Jack Sparrow made his farewells and escape. Bragging to the soldiers, he accidentally toppled over the fort wall, falling into the harbor. Landing with a splash, Jack sputtered to the surface and gazed at the horizon. With a smile, his eyes landed on a familiar sight—the Black Pearl. Her black sails were no longer tattered and her sides gleamed in the bright sun. Grinning, Jack began to swim for it. In the face of this alarming chain of events, culminating in Elizabeth's profession of love for Will, Commodore Norrington decided not to immediately pursue Sparrow, giving him a day's head start to escape.[1]\n\nOut at sea, Jack swam close enough to the Black Pearl where he got heaved on board, where he was greeted by Gibbs and other members of the new crew of the Black Pearl. Jack asked Gibbs about not keeping to the Code. Gibbs said they figured the Code were more \"guidelines\" before helping Jack to his feet. Cotton, the mute pirate, gave Jack his tricornered hat before Anamaria stepped aside from the helm and gave \"Captain Sparrow\" his coat as well as command of the Black Pearl. Jack then ran a hand lovingly along the ship's wheel, feeling good and right in his hands, and smiled. He enjoyed it, until noticing his crew watching him, and then shifted to 'Captain' mode. Giving orders to his crew, Captain Jack Sparrow stood at the wheel of the Black Pearl. As he looked out to sea and felt the Pearl's wood beneath his fingers, Jack said, \"Now...Bring me that horizon.\" Jack then began humming the pirate song Elizabeth taught him before under his breath, and in his hand he held his compass. He realized what he's doing and smiles. Setting a new course, Captain Jack Sparrow sailed his ship across the turquoise waves of the Caribbean, preparing to sail for new adventures on the high seas.[1]\n\nNew adventures\n\nThe Skull of Teoxuacata\n\nAs captain of the Black Pearl once again, Jack continued operating as a pirate. Accompanied by Will Turner, Jack broke into Fort Alvo Grande, a Portuguese fortress on the shores of Panama. Jack, Will, and the crew of the Black Pearl discovered the legendary Skull of Teoxuacata in the fort's treasury, but the crewmen led by Stubb took the Skull for themselves, leaving Jack and Will behind to be captured. The Portuguese sentenced both thieves to death by hanging. The next day, while they were standing on the gallows, Jack told the gathered crowd the tales of his many exploits, most of them exaggerated, innacurate, or completely made up. However, Jack's tales bought the duo enough time for Elizabeth Swann to arrive and rescue them. The pirates then successfully escaped from the fort.[15]\n\nA few weeks later Jack and Will discovered Stubb and his crewmen in a tavern in Tortuga, all of them dead. However, as Jack attempted to take the Skull of Teoxuacata, the magical item brought the corpses back to life as the undead, commanding them to attack Jack and Will.[15]\n\nSt. Piran's Blade\n\nThe Black Pearl attacked the merchant ship which was carrying the St. Piran's Blade, a sword with supposedly magical powers. However, Mr. Cotton accidentally sent the ship to the bottom of the sea. Now in need of help, Jack summoned Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann for a meeting in the Faithful Bride tavern in Tortuga. Jack told them about the blade, but the meeting was interrupted by Jack's former crew which became undead once again. Will and Elizabeth were captured but Jack managed to escape.[50]\n\nThe cursed pirates forced Will and Elizabeth onto their ship and took them to their secret hideout. They also retrieved the treasure from the ship Jack sank, including the St. Piran's Blade. The cursed pirates waited for the Black Pearl to arrive so they could send her to the bottom of the ocean. But instead, Jack sneaked into the fort and freed Will and Elizabeth. Jack fought against the cursed pirates with St. Piran's Blade, but when Elizabeth took it, the sword started glowing with fire, because she was the only person with the heart pure enough to activate the sword's power. The cursed pirates were easily defeated and their ship was heavily damaged by the cannon fire from the Pearl. After the battle, Will and Elizabeth persuaded Jack to give them the magical blade so they could donate it to some museum. However, Jack kept the sword's chest which was filled with jewels.[50]\n\nA lost treasure\n\nWhen Jack went to search for one treasure which he buried before Barbossa's mutiny, he couldn't find the exact spot. To find the treasure, he had to find one of his former crewmembers, Scurvy Joe, who had the treasure map tattooed on his back. When Sparrow found out that Joe was imprisoned in Port Royal, he \"invaded\" the city alone. He was quickly captured and thrown into the dungeon. When he was confronted by Commodore Norrington, the naval officer commented that Jack really is the worst pirate that he ever heard of. However, Jack quickly escaped, with the secret help of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. When Joe tried to kill him, Jack easily captured him, and the Black Pearl' sailed to an island where the treasure was buried. Two days later, when dawn came, the sun turned the cursed pirate into his human form, allowing Jack to see the treasure map.[51]\n\nThe Aztec Idol\n\nWhen Jack learned about the mystical magical idol of Aztec origin, he sailed the Black Pearl for Mexico, where the idol was supposed to be hidden. The information was correct, the idol was hidden in one old temple, but once he reached the temple, Jack saw his old crew, now led by Bo'sun, forcing Will to take the idol for them, because they were holding Elizabeth as a hostage.[52]\n\nHowever, when Bo'sun took the idol from Will, Jack attacked him, pushed him into a deep pit, and took the idol. Will and Elizabeth disposed of Pintel and Ragetti, and the trio started escaping from the temple. Followed by angry pirates, the trio reached the beach and boarded the Black Pearl, which opened fire on the undead crew's ship, damaging it heavily. However, Jack knew that his former crew would follow the idol wherever he goes, so he decided to melt the idol and spend the gold in as many ports as possible.[52]\n\n\"The governor\"\n\nSome time later, Jack was in Tortuga once again, where he found himself chased by Norrington and his men, who were disguised in civilian clothes. Cornered in one alley, Jack had no way out, but luckily for him, Anamaria showed up, interrupting Norrington's men, and Sparrow managed to run away. He found the carriage belonging to the Governor of Tortuga, from which he took the governor's hat and cloak, easily disguising himself. When Norrington and his men encountered \"the governor\", he threatened to arrest them as spies. Unfortunately for Jack, the real governor suddenly appeared, and Jack had to run away again. Using the governor's coach, Jack managed to escape once again, and he and Anamaria reached the harbor where they boarded a boat which took them far away from Norrington.[53]\n\nLeading the Revolution\n\nSome time later, Jack and Will Turner ended on the Isle of Lusee, a place where the cruel governor treated the colonists as if he owned them, imprisoning the innocents and confiscating their treasure. Jack and Will convinced the people of the island to organize a revolution and overthrow the governor. The people of the island, led by Jack and Will, stormed the governor's fort and Jack easily captured him, taking the keys of the treasury. However, when he and Will entered the treasury, Jack revealed that his plan was to steal the treasure for himself, not to give it to its rightful owners. However, Will convinced Jack not to steal the treasure, and because the people of the island considered him their hero, they gave him the largest share of the treasure.[54]\n\nJolly Roger's undead army\n\nAt some point, the vile undead pirate Jolly Roger sought revenge against Jack Sparrow, for both losing the position of Pirate Lord of the Caribbean Sea to Sparrow as well as a past poker match in which the voodoo witch doctor Amo Dorsi cursed him, which rendered Roger half-man, half-beast. Now, Roger's greatest desire was not just to become a Pirate Lord, but to rule the Caribbean and kill Sparrow. He started a search that lasted for years, but without success. Roger eventually created an army of undead skeletons, raised from their watery graves with only one purpose, to serve Jolly Roger and deliver Sparrow's head to him on a plate.[37]\n\nRoger hired captain Bo Beck to capture Sparrow, and to deliver him to Roger himself. When Beck had managed to catch up with him, Captain Jack made a deal with Beck, giving him double the amount of gold that Roger gave Bo Beck. While Sparrow achieved escape once again, Roger killed Beck and turned him into one of his undead minions. Later, Jack had been laying low and conspiring with other Pirates - helping them beef up their confidence and grenade skills. With cunning and double-dealing, Sparrow had hoped to weaken Jolly Roger's army, but the undead skeleton army only grew stronger. Roger allied himself with Lord Cutler Beckett, as they both had a common goal; to rid the world of Jack Sparrow. Roger assumed that once Jack Sparrow was defeated, the pirates would abandon the Caribbean islands for safer waters. Jack now had to evade not only the British Royal Navy and the East India Trading Company, but Jolly as well. With the help of pirate captain Walter, Jack was able to repel Jolly Roger's invasion of Tortuga. A few months after the battle of Raven's Cove, Jolly Roger set a rum blockade on Tortuga, hoping to lure Jack Sparrow out by diminishing his rum supply. As a response, Sparrow sent an unnamed pirate (probably the same he'd freed from Rambleshack some time prior) to the newly-rediscovered island of Raven's Cove to retrieve the famed blade of El Patron's, to vanquish Jolly once and for all. The blade was eventually retrieved and ended up in Sparrow's power.[37]\n\nThe Dead Man's Chest\n\nThe Black Spot\n\nA year after his great escape from Port Royal, Jack realized his freedom came at a cost. The debt he had sworn to Davy Jones thirteen years prior had still not been paid. Whether Jack had the foresight to attempt to call off the debt, or whether it was simply a coincidence is unknown, but Jack embarked on a quest to locate the Dead Man's Chest, which legends say contained the still-beating heart of Davy Jones. But first, Jack allowed himself to be captured by the corsairs off the Canary Islands and taken to the Turkish prison in order to obtain information he needs to solve his impending dilemma.[11]\n\nHe soon happened upon a valuable drawing of a key in a Turkish prison, giving him an advantage in his quest by figuring out that he must find the key itself. Jack was able to obtain this drawing, but soon encountered trouble, and fled the island within the confines of a coffin launched out to sea. In the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, Jack used the coffin as a makeshift boat to return to the Black Pearl, where he informed his crew of his new venture. Confused, mostly because of Jack not telling exactly what to look for, the crew of the Black Pearl agreed to sail off to search for the key and what the key might unlock.[11]\n\nThat night, Jack was visited in the Pearl's cellar by Bootstrap Bill Turner, currently serving as part of Davy Jones' crew aboard the Flying Dutchman. Turner informed Jack that his time was up, and Jones was calling in his debt. To reinforce this, Turner branded Jack with the Black Spot, setting fear into Jack's heart and causing him to begin his quest for the key with all haste. He was so fearful of what his debt might entail, when he lost his hat, he told his crew to leave it. It was through this fear that Jack could not bring himself even to tell his crew what forces pursued them.[11]\n\nRunning to Isla de Pelegostos\n\nJack knew that as long as he remained on the open seas, he was in danger, so the Pearl weighed anchor at Isla de Pelegostos, the closest body of land, and one which Jack was likely familiar with. Even here, the crew of the Pearl was not safe, as they were summarily captured by a group of cannibalistic natives. Jack was made the chief of the tribe (allowed to retain his position so long as he acted like a chief), although he found his fortunes had little improved when he learned that the natives believed him to be a god, and he would be eaten to release his spirit from its \"fleshy prison\". Despite this, Jack played along, all the while looking for means of escape. Meanwhile, some of his crew had already been eaten, and the rest held in cages made from the bones of their former companions.[11]\n\nJack's situation improved with the arrival of William Turner, seeking Jack in order to obtain his compass for Lord Cutler Beckett. Will inadvertently caused a distraction, through his capture by and subsequent escape from the cannibals, which gave Jack the time he needed to flee. Jack, Will and the surviving crew returned to the Black Pearl and set sail, though Jack still refused to head into open water. Instead, he had unfinished business near Pelegosto, in the Pantano River on the island of Cuba.[11]\n\nTia Dalma\n\nThe crew traveled through upriver in boats to the shack of Tia Dalma, where Jack hoped to find information on the key to the chest which contained Davy Jones's heart. He and Dalma had a history, and as Jack himself said, they had, at one time, been inseparable. It was also implied that the two had once been lovers.[11]\n\nUpon arrival at her shack, however, Jack was somewhat perturbed to find Dalma took more interest in Will than himself. However, Jack was able to trade Barbossa's undead monkey in exchange for information on the the location of the key, and details about Jones's heart. He was also given a jar of dirt, as Tia said that Davy Jones could not make port but one day for every ten years, and so Jack would bring land, in some form, with him.[11]\n\nBargain with Jones\n\nArmed with this knowledge, the crew set out to find Jones' ship, the Flying Dutchman. Will was summarily captured by Jones' crew after Jack told him to say \"Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt\". Jack witnessed the encounter from his ship, but was shocked as Davy Jones himself confronted him aboard the Black Pearl. He demanded Jack's debt be paid, but Jack tried to convince Jones otherwise, because of Barbossa's mutiny that happened two years after becoming captain of the Pearl. However, Jones pointed out that because Jack had introduced himself as \"Captain\" Jack Sparrow throughout the years, he was still captain, even though he was not on the Pearl itself. After a series of bargains, Jones agreed that, should Jack bring him one hundred souls in three days, he would be free. As slim a chance as this was, Jack took it and Jones sealed the deal by removing the Black Spot. Jack then had the Pearl's crew immediately set sail for Tortuga, noting that Jones did not specify what state the souls should be in.[11]\n\nAfter arriving to Tortuga, Jack and Gibbs began recruiting crewmen for service on the Pearl in the Twelve Daggers tavern. They managed to enlist a total of four mariners before a bar brawl broke out, started by the disgraced former Commodore, James Norrington. Jack and Gibbs managed to slip out, and began preparing the Black Pearl for launch.[11]\n\nAt this point, Jack encountered Elizabeth Swann, having escaped from the custody of Lord Beckett to find Will. Jack realized Elizabeth's true desire was being reunited with Will, and knew he could use this to his advantage. He persuaded Elizabeth that finding the Dead Man's Chest would help her save Will. Thus, ensuring that when she used Jack's compass, it would point to her true desire, in order to save Will, the chest. Jack finally found a heading.[11]\n\nJourney to Isla Cruces\n\nThe Black Pearl immediately set course for Isla Cruces, the burial site of the Dead Man's Chest. On board the Pearl, Jack and Gibbs learned of Will's association with Lord Cutler Beckett, after finding out about the Letters of Marque from Elizabeth. It was there that they realized that the only reason Beckett wanted Jack's compass so that he could find the Dead Man's Chest. Jack took the documents, much to Elizabeth's annoyance, and refused to return them unless she could sufficiently \"persuade\" him to do so. Elizabeth attempted to persuade him, but Jack was immune.[11]\n\nLater on during the journey, Jack once more approached Elizabeth, while being depressed about not being married already. Jack offered her a drink and a marriage with him, as captain of a ship. Disgusted, Elizabeth turned down his offer of marriage. Jack then questioned her answer, stating that she would come over to his side in time. He stated that Elizabeth was curious and longed to feel the freedom and the life Jack enjoyed. In turn, Elizabeth told him she was sure one day Jack would prove himself to be a good man, and he would long for the reward of fame that would follow. Jack was indeed enticed by this, but whatever attraction may have developed between the two was soon quashed when Jack noticed the Black Spot had reappeared on his palm. At that moment, Gibbs sighted land: Isla Cruces, and the end of Jack's quest.[11]\n\nFight for the key\n\nUpon arrival at Isla Cruces, Jack set about tracking down the Dead Man's Chest, using Elizabeth as his guide. Jack had Norrington dig at the supposed burial site, as deigned by Elizabeth, using the compass. Her reading was correct, and Norrington soon unearthed the chest, which contained the heart that also proved Jack's claims. However, before Jack could open it, Will Turner arrived, having escaped from servitude aboard the Flying Dutchman. He refused to let Jack open the chest, wanting to stab the heart within and thus free his father from his debt to Jones. Jack, naturally, wanted the heart for himself, in order to call off Jones' Kraken, and drew his sword. It was a standoff, exacerbated by Norrington's intervention, who wanted control of the heart for his own personal reasons.[11]\n\nA three-way sword fight inevitably ensued, in which Jack attempted desperately to get his hands on the key. The three-way duel progressed atop a stone church, where Jack finally got a hold of the key, but was disarmed in the attempt. Norrington then stated, with his blade pointed towards Jack, his intention to kill Jack for ruining his life. However, Jack deflected some of the blame onto Will's shoulders, and then fled through the graveyard with the key. Unfortunately, he was soon thrust back into the battle when the two duelists dislodged an old water wheel, and continued the fight inside and around it as it rolled through the jungle.[11]\n\nUltimately, however, Jack managed to hold on to the key, and opened the Dead Man's Chest after taking it from the pirate Hadras. Within was Davy Jones' heart, just as Tia Dalma had said, which Jack hid inside his jar of dirt back at the longboat on the beach. Davy Jones' crew soon caught up, and Jack became too preoccupied with fighting them off to notice Norrington studying the jar with great interest.[11]\n\nJack's companions were able to hold the pirates back, and fled in the longboat leaving Norrington, who instead fled into the jungle carrying the empty chest, thus distracting the pirates. Jack made it back to the Black Pearl, which launched for the open water, safe in the knowledge that he was now in possession of the heart of Davy Jones.[11]\n\nConfrontations\n\nAs Jack had expected, the Flying Dutchman soon caught up with the Pearl, and he began taunting its Captain, holding his jar of dirt aloft. Jones chased the pearl at first firing at it but the Pearl soon outran the Flying Dutchman. That's when Davy Jones called upon the Kraken once more, which began its assault on the Black Pearl. Shaking the vessel, the Kraken dislodged Jack's Jar of Dirt, which smashed on the deck, revealing nothing inside but a pile of dirt. Desperately searching for the missing heart, which was already making its way to Cutler Beckett in the possession of Norrington, Jack realized his advantage over Jones was lost. True to his usual form, Jack turned tail and fled in the ship's lone remaining boat, seeking to escape back to the relative safety of Isla Cruces.[11]\n\nHowever, despite all evidence to the contrary, Jack was indeed a good man at heart who knew he could not leave his crew to die in the attack, and began rowing back to his beloved Black Pearl.[11]\n\nHe arrived back on deck in time, seizing the rifle Elizabeth was trying to grab and manage to ignite a gunpowder trap set up by Will that wounded the Kraken and forestalled its attack for a moment. Jack ordered his crew into the longboat, at the cost of his ship. Gibbs was shocked at Jack's decision, but the Captain had seen sense; after all, she was only a ship.[11]\n\nAs the crew raced onto the longboat, Elizabeth thanked Jack for coming back to save them, and leaned in for a kiss. Their kiss carried them to the mast, to which Elizabeth suddenly chained Jack. She had realized the Kraken was after Jack alone, not the rest of the crew, and this sacrifice would be the only way to ensure their survival. Jack conceded her trickery with a smile, calling her a \"pirate\". Apparently resigned to his fate, Jack watched her leave the ship.[11]\n\nDown with his ship\n\nAs soon as he was left alone on deck, Jack frantically tried to escape his chains. He managed to slip out of his manacles, with the aid of oil from a broken lantern, though he was too late. No sooner had he freed himself that the Kraken returned, its fanged mouth rising up to deck-level. The Kraken belched out a roar, spraying Jack with slime and spitting out Jack's hat, eaten prior to Jack's arrival at Pelegosto.[11]\n\nPlacing his hat once more atop his head, Captain Jack Sparrow said \"Hello beastie\". Then he drew his sword and faced off against the Kraken as it dragged the Black Pearl under water.[11]\n\nWith that, the captain went down with his ship, and Davy Jones considered his debt settled. Jack's captain-less crew returned, dejected and defeated, back to Tia Dalma's shack. There, they raised a toast to the late Captain Jack Sparrow, but Tia had not yet given up hope. She stated that there was a chance to bring Jack back from the depths of World's End, though it would entail a journey to Davy Jones' Locker. The crew agreed, and set out under the command of their new captain, the resurrected Hector Barbossa, a man who knew those waters well.[11]\n\nReturning for War\n\nMadness of the Locker\n\nJack was taken by the Kraken to Davy Jones' Locker, where he was forced to endure the worst punishment he could ever take; his beloved Pearl was stuck on a seemingly-endless desert. For months, Jack was tormented by a series of hallucinations that personified the various aspects of his personality as members of his crew, torturing both his love of the sea and his idea of being the only \"Jack Sparrow\". Divided in this manner, Jack had no hope of moving his ship, as though his crew did follow orders, the flaws of his \"crew\" made the Pearl unable to make any sort of progression with no wind to move the ship.[4]\n\nWhen Tia Dalma neared the island where Jack was stranded, she enchanted the rocks on the island to teleport to the Black Pearl, and the rocks cracked open, revealing an army of rock-crabs. The rock-crabs used their combined strength to move the Black Pearl. Jack was off the ship at the moment, but was able to run and catch up to the Pearl and boarded it in time to sail it out to sea.[4]\n\nThe Return of Jack Sparrow\n\nBy this point, his former crew, led by a resurrected Barbossa and aided by Tai Huang and the crew of the Hai Peng, arrived in the Locker, ostensibly to free Jack. Sparrow initially believed them to be mere hallucinations, and greeted them with mockery but was swayed when Elizabeth appeared and told him they are real, as he becomes surprised perhaps recalling the foul memory of his death, or maybe just recalling her kiss. After being told by Gibbs he was in the locker, Jack became more nervous but remained unfazed by their appearance, and even greeted his former resurrected nemesis, Barbossa, with cheer, knowing full well that their only means of escape, the Pearl, was in Jack's possession.\n\nSparrow is also told by what is happening in the living realm such as Beckett using Jones to slaughter pirates and the brethren court holding a meeting. He refused to travel with some of them as several of them have tried to kill him before stating one of them succeeded and noted Will was unaware of this. He picked a few of them to come with him while leaving the rest behind. However, he was forced to concede that Barbossa, holding the navigational charts bestowed upon the crew by Sao Feng, would be useful in the escape, as in the locker, his compass didn't seem to work.[4]\n\nAlmost immediately, a rivalry formed between Jack and Barbossa with both claiming to be the rightful captain of the Black Pearl. The crew boarded the Pearl and set sail on the endless seas of Davy Jones' Locker, meeting Elizabeth's father, Weatherby Swann, along the way.[4]\n\nUp is Down\n\nThe crew continued to sail through endless seas of Davy Jones' Locker, knowing that if they were unable to escape by sunset, they would remain trapped in that dimension forever. Jack, however, was able to decipher one additional phrase, \"Up is Down\". Puzzled at first, after listening to his shoulder angel and devil debate his future (ironically they look just like Jack) he figured out the meaning, and coerced his crew into rocking the ship back and forth. Barbossa, realizing Jack had figured out the chart loosed the objects below deck, until at last the Pearl tipped upside down under the waves. As the sun sank below the horizon, the ship returned to the world of the living at sunrise; the ship had literally been turned upside down to pass between dimensions, going from the bottom of the sea, and floating all the way to the top.[4]\n\nAs soon as the crew emerged from the Locker, Barbossa pulled his pistol on Jack, leading to a tense stand-off. Barbossa wanted to lead Jack to Shipwreck Cove as he was a pirate, but Jack adamantly wished to leave the pirates to their fate. This turned even Elizabeth and Will against Jack, but determined not to return to the Locker, Jack pulled his pistol on Barbossa. Then it was revealed that none of the crews' pistols would work due to the wet powder of just passing through the sea. Jack and Barbossa were forced to grudgingly cooperate, and made for the nearest island to find fresh water.[4]\n\nThe island the crew happened upon was the one on which the corpse of the Kraken had been left, after Davy Jones had been forced to kill it by Lord Beckett. Jack had a moment of sympathy for the creature, perhaps seeing the reflection of his own mortality in its dead eye. Jack voiced his fear of death to Barbossa, who reminded him that death, not immortality, was the only certainty. It was at this point that Jack decided to redouble his efforts to discover a way of achieving eternal life. In another turning point, Jack, who originally planned on simply running and becoming the last pirate as the EITC killed them all, finally realized that Beckett had to be stopped, and agreed to meet with the other members of the Brethren Court.[4]\n\nDeal with Beckett\n\nHowever, his quest was postponed by the arrival of the Empress, and the betrayal of Sao Feng. Jack and his crew were confronted by Sao Feng, who punched Jack on the nose in retaliation for a \"great insult\" paid by Jack at some point in the past. Jack was forced to give up the Black Pearl when it transpired that \"Captain\" Turner had struck a deal with Feng to take the ship for himself, in order to catch the Flying Dutchman and free his father from servitude. Jack then, realizing that his rescue was a scam, asked the crew if anyone had actually missed him. Five members did: Marty, Cotton, Pintel, Ragetti and Jack the Monkey.[4]\n\nJack was then taken aboard the HMS Endeavour, flagship of Lord Cutler Beckett, where his diminished position did nothing to dampen his creativity at negotiation. He struck his own deal, promising to lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove, and thus deliver the Brethren Court into his clutches, in exchange for Jack's freedom from both the company and from Davy Jones. Beckett, however, threatened to kill Jack to \"Cut out the middle man\", but Jack promised he would send the Brethren out to him, to ensure their battle. Beckett agreed, as long as Sparrow could accomplish that feat.[4]\n\nTheir final negotiations were cut short through Barbossa and Feng's agreeing upon a common enemy, resulting in the Pearl's attack on the Endeavour. Jack hastily shook on a deal, then escaped the flagship and returned to his own vessel via a cannon and rope, to find Elizabeth had been given over to Feng in order for Barbossa to retain the Pearl. He ordered Will Turner to be sent to the brig and had the Pearl set sail to Shipwreck Cove.[4]\n\nJourney to Shipwreck Cove\n\nBy this point, Jack found himself unable to trust Will Turner, as he escaped the brig to attempt to help Jack honor his bargain with Beckett by leaving a trail for Beckett to follow. Jack, in realizing how far apart Will and Elizabeth were growing, conceived an elaborate plan where both he and Will could get what they both want. Jack's plan was that he would stab the heart of Davy Jones, thereby making him immortal, ensuring his father's freedom, and Will could still be with Elizabeth. Jack then gave Will his compass, set him overboard while sending his regards to Davy Jones, and then continued on to meeting the Brethren at the Cove.[4]\n\nArriving at Shipwreck Island, Jack commented on the lack of originality for pirates naming things, such as Larry, a geezer he once sailed with. He also witnessed Tia Dalma being sent below deck, to the Pearl's brig, perhaps while overhearing her conversation with Barbossa. When gazing at Shipwreck Cove upon arrival, Barbossa and the crew commented on how many ships are at the Cove, in which Jack realized that he owed them all money. Jack, Barbossa, and the rest of the Pearl's crewmen carried on to the meeting at Pirate Hall.[4]\n\nThe Brethren Court\n\nDuring the meeting of the Fourth Brethren Court, Jack found himself at odds with Barbossa, and attempted to convince the Pirate Lords to unite against the East India Trading Company. Whether this was playing them into the hands of Beckett or just pure logic, one can never guess. Jack skillfully used his extensive knowledge of surviving saying they could hold up within, but it would be devastating for morale, and half of them could die. He also mentioned that they could also released Calypso, as Barbossa petitioned, but Jack thought that to be too risky. Thus, he agreed with Elizabeth, who had finally joined them as the new Pirate Lord of the South China Sea. That they must fight.[4]\n\nEveryone agreed to this plan, at least until Barbossa mentioned that the Code specifically mentioned that only the Pirate King can declare war. Jack thought this to be made up, until Barbossa called upon Captain Teague, Jack's father to consult the Pirata Codex. When a vote had to be made for the next King, Jack voted for Elizabeth, knowing she would support the decision to go to war. After the meeting, Jack went to confer his father. In the reunion, Teague offered Jack advice, concerning his search for immortality, \"It's not just about living forever, Jackie. The trick is living with yourself forever.\" Jack then inquired about his mother, to which Teague responded by holding aloft her shrunken, severed head. Jack responded uncomfortably that she looked great. Afterwards, Teague gave the head to Jack for him to keep, and Jack kept it on his belt.[4]\n\nReaching the Dutchman\n\nWith the meeting adjourned and the Pirate Lords decided upon their course of action, the fleet sailed out to meet the armada of the East India Company, the Black Pearl at its head. When the pirates saw Cutler Beckett's armada and how many ships they were going against, they all turned angrily towards Jack, and sheepishly Jack called for the forces to parlay. During the parlay, he was traded for Will, who had been recovered by Beckett in order that his debt to Davy Jones would once again, be settled. Due to his escape, the debt had technically been reset. So 100 years aboard the Dutchman were once again required. Because his plan was working, Jack was unconcerned with being sent to the Dutchman, though slightly put off by Jones.[4]\n\nFight with Jones\n\nJack was sent to the brig on board the Flying Dutchman, where he again experienced his hallucinations. Jack weakly told them to go away, but they insisted that they couldn't go back to the locker without him. Then he saw a hallucination of what he might be like as a Dutchman crewman, and one of his other hallucinations commented that defeating Jones would put an alternative far out of reach. Jack though was adamant, and decided to escape and steal the Dead Man's Chest. After thinking like Will, Jack fled the brig in the same manner Will had released Jack from Fort Charles over a year before. He was then able to snatch the chest out from under the noses of its arguing guards, Mullroy and Murtogg in addition to recovering his effects. However, he was accosted by Davy Jones and his crew during his escape, thereby forcing Sparrow to \"fly\" up into the Flying Dutchman's rigging but Jones teleported to his location. There, a fierce and ferocious duel ensued between the two captains as the Flying Dutchman and the Black Pearl engaged in battle around a maelstrom conjured by Calypso.[4]\n\nAt first, Jack held his ground before Jones revealed that he held the Key to the Dead Man's Chest. Seeing this, Jack gained the upper hand, by slicing off Jones' tentacle that held the Key, and disarming him. However, Jones broke Jack's sword, and then took the chest from Jack, sending him flying onto a rope where he reclaimed his pistol from one of Jones' crew. Swinging on the rope, Jack shot the chest from Jones' grip, sending it falling to the deck. The two engaged in a race to reach the chest whilst continuing their duel. While Jones was distracted by Will and Elizabeth, Jack ultimately managed to get the key to open the chest and held his broken sword over the heart.[4]\n\nAfter Jones asked Will Turner his routine question: \"Do you fear death?\", Jack taunted him by asking Jones if he himself feared death. However, Jack was plunged into a quandary when Jones stabbed Will Turner, leaving him to die. Jack knew that the only way to save his old friend and defeat opponent would be to allow him to stab the heart, thus ensuring Will immortality, though at the cost of Jack's own chance at the same. As Bootstrap Bill Turner snapped out of his delirium and engaged Jones, Jack fought with himself, struggling between his own dream of immortality and his one chance to save Will.[4]\n\nIn the end, Jack's altruistic nature won over, as Jack forfeited his immortality. He placed his broken sword in Will Turner's dying hand, guiding it to stab the heart, killing Jones in the process. As the Dutchman's crewmen were coming towards them, Jack was forced to drag the frantic Elizabeth away from Will's body, knowing that they only had moments until the Dutchman was swallowed up in the maelstrom. While Will's heart was carved out by Bootstrap Bill, Jack rigged a makeshift parachute and fled with the distraught Elizabeth back to the Black Pearl with the other pirates.[4]\n\nArriving onboard the Black Pearl, the rest of his crew wanted to flee the field as the ship was damaged and the the Endeavour was now coming upon them. Jack though, perhaps now determined to finish Beckett off, and salvage the cause of Piracy due to losing his shot at immortality, declined. And when the Flying Dutchman burst from the sea, now captained by Will Turner, Jack knew they now had a fighting chance, and quickly readied the ship to turn on Beckett. Together, the flagship of piracy and the ship of supernatural power turned on the Endeavor, dealing a devastating dual broadside on the symbol of British Power. Lord Beckett was killed in the devastation, after which the East India Trading Company Armada fled the battle.[4]\n\nEgregious\n\nWith the battle won, Jack bade farewell to Elizabeth, who had to be with Will before he leaves to do his duty to ferry souls. He then sailed the Black Pearl to Tortuga, where he was found in the company of Scarlett and Giselle, persuading them with an offer to ride aboard his ship. However, upon returning to the harbor, Jack found the Pearl gone: Barbossa had mutinied once again by taking the Pearl, marooning him and Joshamee Gibbs ashore. This didn't seem to faze Jack, however, who resorted to using a dinghy left to him. Scarlett and Giselle slapped Jack, after Jack confessed many things to them, which resulted in Gibbs being slapped by Jack.[4]\n\nAs Gibbs remained in Tortuga, in the company of Scarlett and Giselle, Jack sails away on his dinghy. Jack had anticipated Barbossa's treachery, and had cut out the middle part of Sao Feng's navigational charts for himself. He was running up his pirate flag, while singing \"A Pirate's Life for Me\", in his dinghy. Looking at Sao Feng's charts, he discovered that the location of the Fountain of Youth is in Florida, as the legends foretold. Using his compass, he located a bottle of rum and began his search for the Fountain of Youth. A happy Jack then sailed off in his dinghy, while drinking the rum, as he began his journey to achieve immortality.[4]\n\nQuest for the Fountain of Youth\n\nYears of searching\n\nEven with the help of his map and compass, Jack Sparrow's search for the Fountain of Youth would last for several years. It weren't the lure of charmed waters that first sent Jack on a course for the fabled Fountain but rather Jack set off in pursuit of his beloved ship, the Black Pearl, stolen from him by Hector Barbossa. Knowing Barbossa was after the Fountain of Youth as well, Jack attempted to find the Fountain on his own. In his search, Jack was able to find the island where the Fountain was located, and had been close as reaching the cave entrance to the Fountain itself. But Jack never made it to the elusive Fountain and was forced to turn back.[55][56] Despite not finding the Fountain of Youth, Jack gained some renown as the pirate who knew its location, though some misinterpret that he had been to the Fountain himself. Jack also had the way to the Fountain of Youth committed to his memory.[57]\n\nAt some point in time, Jack Sparrow would have swallowed one of his teeth, which ended up being a part of his new trinket, and woke up with an \"X\" on his right cheek. He also owned another pistol for his effects. Fortune sent Jack Sparrow east across the Atlantic, and it was then he heard tell of Joshamee Gibbs' dire encounter with the authorities of London. So Jack charted a course to London to effect the rescue of his devoted First Mate.[55]\n\nLondon\n\nSoon Jack arrived to London to save Joshamee Gibbs from an appointment with the gallows. However, while Gibbs was set to being put on trial for piracy, he was being mistaken for Jack Sparrow himself. Upon arriving to London, he headed to the Old Bailey courthouse to save Gibbs. He bribed the driver of a prison carriage to transport him and Gibbs to shore when the trial was over.\n\nJack tied and gagged the real Judge and put him in a closet, after which Jack resumed as disguising himself as the Judge of Gibbs' trial. Being known as Judge Smith, he had Gibbs pronounced guilty of being innocent of being Jack Sparrow. Much to the surprise of the crowd, Jack had Gibbs condemned to life in prison, rather than a hanging, and allows Gibbs to be transferred to the Tower of London under minimum security.\n\nAfter the trial, Jack took off the Judge disguise as he made his way to signal the prison carriage driver, shortly before joining Gibbs in the prison carriage. Throughout the ride, Gibbs informed Jack about the rumors of him recruiting a crew in the Captain's Daughter pub, in which Jack renounced as completely false and quite insulting. But Jack also thought to find the imposter, because of the need of a ship to escape from England. Gibbs asked Jack of his search for the Fountain of Youth, which he responded that it was temporarily postponed and vowed that he would taste the water of the Fountain.\n\nThe carriage abruptly stopped. Jack and Gibbs then discovered that they were completely surrounded by soldiers of the Royal Guard in front of St. James's Palace. The Guards had also bribed the carriage driver to betray Jack and Gibbs by bringing them to the palace. Jack was forcibly taken into the palace, while Gibbs was sent to prison. In the custody of the Royal Guards, Jack was dragged inside the main hall of St. James's Palace for an audience with His Majesty King George II. Inside the royal banquet room, Jack was chained to a regal seat to await the King's arrival. While he was waiting for the King, he tried to grab a cream puff from the table. Right when the doors open, a surprised Jack kicked the cream puff that he desired up into the air where it got stuck on the room's chandelier. As the doors opened, King George arrived with many of his loyal subjects and Royal Guards. The King was accompanied by Prime Minister Henry Pelham and Lord John Carteret.\n\nLord Carteret asked Jack if he was \"Jack Sparrow\", which Jack responded that the word \"Captain\" was missing in that statement. After much confusion over if Jack was the real Jack Sparrow, the King ordered Jack's chains to be removed, as he was annoyed by Jack rattling the chains. Henry Pelham and King George questions Jack about a map to the Fountain of Youth believed to be in Jack's possession. However, Jack discovered that the map was missing. King George stated that he wanted the Fountain found before the Spanish, as he didn't want King Ferdinand to gain eternal life. Pelham and Carteret asked Jack if he knew the way to the Fountain well enough to guide an expedition. Jack accepted, assuming that he would be provided with a ship and crew. Jack was then introduced to the leader of the expedition; his old rival, Hector Barbossa.\n\nJack and Barbossa had a brief reunion, in which Jack complemented Barbossa's new pirate lifestyle. Barbossa debunked this by revealing that he was now a privateer in service to the King. Jack questioned Barbossa concerning the Black Pearl. Barbossa revealed that he lost the Pearl in a battle which also cost him his leg, which he replaced with a peg leg. Jack angrily reacted to hearing about the loss of his beloved ship and the King's guards had to restrain him to stop him from attacking Barbossa. Before King George and Barbossa resumed their business, Jack made one of his legendary escapes.\n\nJack Sparrow broke free and took out the Royal Guards who held him with their rifles, which he used on the chandelier to make it swing. After taking out some of the guards, Jack got the chance to fly up onto the top of the sill and grabbed the chandelier and swung across the room towards the balcony. King George, Hector Barbossa and the King's subjects stared at the seemingly impossible escape. Jack grabbed the creme puff that was stuck on the chandelier and ate it as he left.\n\nAfter retrieving his sword and pistols. He came to a window, which he opened, and prepared to jump over the busy street. By the time the guards had gotten there, Jack had hidden behind one of the banners hanging between the buildings. The guard spotted Jack's movement and blew his whistle as Jack carefully tried to pull himself back up as another guard appears and hacked at the tassel holding the banner. Jack then plummeted down into a carriage that was driving along the road, landing in a noblewoman's lap, causing her to shriek in horror. Jack stared and then leaned forward, seemingly kissing her while stealing one of her earrings, before climbing on top of the carriage.\n\nSeeing that Royal Guards were after him, Jack managed to stand up on top of the moving carriage an"
