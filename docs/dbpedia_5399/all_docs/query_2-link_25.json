For a limited time, preorder all three standard hardcover editions and get 20% off, or preorder the new Joe Jusko Legend Editions (see below for more details) from the individual product pages for A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars, and The Warlord of Mars. (Please note: The “Buy 3 Books and Get 20% Off” sale does not apply to the Joe Jusko Legend Editions.)\n\nAlthough Mr. Burroughs is best known for creating his world-famous ape-man, he launched his renowned writing career with the serialization of “Under the Moons of Mars” in the pages of The All-Story magazine from February–July 1912, and many fans of his books consider the Barsoom series to be among his finest and most enduring works. “Under the Moons of Mars” was first published in hardcover in 1917 by A. C. McClurg & Co. under the title A Princess of Mars, and was followed by The Gods of Mars and The Warlord of Mars, both of which first appeared in The All-Story in 1913–14. The three novels make up one of the most highly influential and celebrated trilogies in the history of science fiction, and have left a permanent stamp on popular culture, influencing and inspiring the most prominent figures around the world, including Ray Bradbury, Carl Sagan, Jerry Seigel, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and James Cameron, to name just a few. In the words of Ray Bradbury, “Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world.” Without Edgar Rice Burroughs’ John Carter of Mars, it is doubtful that Superman, Star Wars, or Avatar would exist for audiences to enjoy, at least not in their recognizable forms.\n\nThese stunning hardcover editions feature gorgeous new cover art and frontispieces by Joe Jusko; forewords by venerated fantasy author and SFWA Grand Master Michael Moorcock (Elric, Hawkmoon, The Eternal Champion), bestselling science fiction and fantasy author Kevin J. Anderson (Dune, Star Wars, The X-Files), and NASA astronaut Terrence W. Wilcutt (veteran of four Space Shuttle missions); afterwords by noted ERB scholar Henry G. Franke III; and a bounty of rare and previously unpublished archival materials.\n\nThe first three volumes of the Barsoom Saga are expected to ship Fall 2024.\n\nCover art by Joe Jusko\n\nBuy All Three Books and Get 20% Off!*\n\nFor a limited time, buy all three standard hardcover editions of A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars, and The Warlord of Mars and get 20%!

Jusko is a recipient of myriad industry honors, including a Certificate of Merit from the Society of Illustrators and a 2001 Chesley Award nomination. Fittingly, he was born on September 1, sharing his birthday with Edgar Rice Burroughs.
