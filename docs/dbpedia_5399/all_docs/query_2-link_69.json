        "text": "A Taste of Praise\n\nEdward Theodore McClintock is an American actor, best known for his role of Secret Service agent Pete Lattimer on the Syfy series Warehouse 13. McClintock was born in Canton, Ohio, and raised by his father Theodore \"Ted\" McClintock. After his parents' divorce, he moved with his father to North Canton. After leaving St. Michael's Catholic School in the eighth grade, he attended North Canton Hoover High School. McClintock graduated with a degree in communications from Wright State University in Dayton and studied design in college. In 2007, he designed the artwork for Puscifer's album \"V\" Is for Vagina and sells some of his artwork on his personal website. Working as a wrestler and later a production assistant, he subsequently took up acting and began appearing in roles in 1997.\n\nNefarious\n\nSean Patrick Flanery was born in Lake Charles, La. and raised in a small town outside of Houston, Texas. While attending the University of St. Thomas in Houston, he saw a beautiful girl leaving a building on campus every Monday and decided to drop an English class and sign up for \"whatever the hell they were teaching in that building\". The building was the University's theater department, and the class was acting. Through his theater studies, he penned a piece of children's theater and decided afterwards to pack up his car and head to Los Angeles with the hopes of actually producing the play. Somewhere in the process, an agent approached him and requested to represent him commercially. His first paid role in Hollywood was a Kellog's Corn Pops commercial starring alongside none other than Paul Walker. Shortly after a string of national commercials, the same agent then began representing him for TV/film roles. He very quickly landed the title role in George Lucas' The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles (1992) after shooting 2 films for the Mickey Mouse Club called Just Perfect (1990) and My Life as a Babysitter (1990). Since then, Flanery has been in numerous films and TV shows every year, including Powder (1995), The Dead Zone (2002), Saw 3D (2010), Suicide Kings (1997), and the runaway cult hit The Boondock Saints (1999), and most recently, the TV show \"Powers\" for Sony, which was scheduled to be released in early 2015.\n\nGod's Not Here II: Trials & Tribulations\n\nJonathan T. Brunson, A Philadelphia native, hand crafted entertainer, with a blessed set of talents and a Midwest infusion.

Since childhood, he's worked from the bottom, with one goal in mind: To entertain the world by any means. From a handful of commercials to a guest star spot on Season 6 of Chicago P.D., Jonathan has been a person built for the lights, a camera and a call of action. Which has heightened, when in 2021, he was given a part in a film that would bring him face to face with a different type of Director and the beginning of a friendship with the gem himself, Matthew Cichella. This unexpected relationship grew from one project to the next, leading them to a path that brought a positive change to the landscape of filmmaking and their friendship. It Was a conversation that led to an audition, and soon to become a pivotal movement for both people. Jonathan T. Brunson was blessed to gain the role of Pastor Darius Williams in the award-winning and audience sweeping anthology \"God's Not Here\" to the now present sequel \"God's Not Here II: Trials and Tribulations\" When not vying for the opportunity to act, Jonathan is also a filmmaker & Director.\n\nVindication\n\nTodd Terry, a native Dallasite, began his career in television, film and theater over 35 years ago.
