The long-awaited graphic version of the multi-million copy bestselling corrective to American history myths--adapted by the famed National Book Award-winning artist behind John Lewis's March trilogy\n\nSince its first publication in the 1990s, Lies My Teacher Told Me has become one of the most important and successful--and beloved--history books of our time. As the late Howard Zinn said, \"Every teacher, every student of history, every citizen should read this book.\" Having sold well over 2 million copies, the book also won an American Book Award and numerous other commendations and prizes and was even heralded on the front page of the New York Times long after its first publication.\n\nNow, the brilliant and award-winning artist Nate Powell--the first cartoonist ever to win a National Book Award--has adapted Loewen's classic work into a graphic edition that perfectly captures both Loewen's text and the irreverent spirit of his work. Eye-popping illustrations bring to life the true history chronicled in Lies My Teacher Told Me, and ample text boxes and callouts ensure nothing is lost in translation. The book is perfect for those making their first foray past the shroud of history textbooks, and it will also be beloved by those who had their worldviews changed by the original.\n\nAn astonishing, deeply moving graphic memoir about three generations of Chinese women, exploring love, grief, exile, and identity.\n\nIn her evocative, genre-defying graphic memoir, Tessa Hulls tells the story of three generations of women in her family: her Chinese grandmother, Sun Yi; her mother, Rose; and herself.\n\nSun Yi was a Shanghai journalist caught in the political crosshairs of the 1949 Communist victory. After eight years of government harassment, she fled to Hong Kong with her daughter. Upon arrival, Sun Yi wrote a bestselling memoir about her persecution and survival, used the proceeds to put Rose in an elite boarding school—and promptly had a breakdown that left her committed to a mental institution. Rose eventually came to the United States on a scholarship and brought Sun Yi to live with her.\n\nTessa watched her mother care for Sun Yi, both of them struggling under the weight of Sun Yi's unexamined trauma and mental illness. Vowing to escape her mother’s smothering fear, Tessa left home and traveled to the farthest-flung corners of the globe (Antarctica). But at the age of thirty, it starts to feel less like freedom and more like running away, and she returns home to face the history that shaped her family.\n\nExtensively researched and gorgeously rendered, Feeding Ghosts is Hulls’s homecoming, a vivid journey into the beating heart of one family, set against the dark backdrop of Chinese history. By turns fascinating and heartbreaking, inventive and poignant, Feeding Ghosts exposes the fear and trauma that haunt generations, and the love that holds them together.\n\n*2024 Iowa Children's Choice Award Winner!*\n\nA girl with anxiety disorder finds an unlikely friend -- and emotional support animal -- in the form of an adorable fainting goat.\n\nTwelve-year-old Marvel is afraid of absolutely everything -- amusement park rides, food poisoning, earthquakes, and that big island of plastic floating through the ocean.
