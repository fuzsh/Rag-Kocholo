I love his steadfastness and good intentions could not be put off my Ann's gruffness.\n\nWhich scene was your favorite?\n\nWhen Steven took Ann to meet his horse Midnight; the explanation for how Midnight got her horrendous scars and how his mother loved the horse to healing; all the while the readers are paralleling Midnight's woundedness with Ann's.\n\nWho was the most memorable character of Beyond the Farthest Star and why?\n\nSteven. Orphaned and raised by loving grandparents who taught him how to look beyond appearances and love unconditionally his friends and now Ann.\n\nEnjoyable\n\nWhat made the experience of listening to Beyond the Farthest Star the most enjoyable?\n\nNo foul language, no sexual situations. Just a nice, comfortable story - good plot.\n\nWho was your favorite character and why?\n\nStephen. He hung in there with Ann, even though she was a difficult person.\n\nWhat does Bodie Thoene bring to the story that you wouldn’t experience if you just read the book?\n\nBecause Bodie is one of the authors, she obviously knows what needs to be said and how. She is not, however, a polished narrator, but acceptable, nonetheless.\n\nDid you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?\n\nno\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nI am a long-time fan of the Thoenes (pronounced Tay-Nee), having read their Zion Chronicles when they were first published and I was a new Christian. Their historic novels are excellent and an exciting read. I wish Audible would carry some of those!! I only gave this book 4 stars because, IMO, it was not up to par. Still, a nice story. One that I would recommend for Christian teens, because the story centers around the 16- yr old daughter, Ann, and her relationship with her parents as well as her peers. The sub-plot has to do with the husband-wife relationship and also the pastor-husband's ambitions to be another Billy Graham.\n\nLoved it!\n\nSuch a wonderful uplifting story I highly recommend getting it! to see a family in turmoil and go through so much together is really a wonderful lesson in life."
