        "text": "Beyond the Farthest Star\n\nBodie and Brock Thoene. Zondervan, $14.99 trade paper (400p) ISBN 978-0-310-33610-5\n\nThe megaseller Thoene team shift from historical to contemporary as they turn a screenplay into a novel that accompanies the forthcoming Pathlight Entertainment film by the same name. The tear-jerking, heartwarming tale pits troubled teenager Anne Wells against her father, Adam, a former preaching prodigy now desperate to lead a small Texas church and, perhaps, revive his career. Throw in more ingredients—peacemaking mom Maurene, caught in the middle; 16-year-old Stephen Miller, who sees more than Anne’s angry exterior; a former senator with national aspirations; a mysterious stranger from the past; a troubled boy whose anger turns deadly—and readers will find a novel that’s entertaining and challenging. When tragedy occurs, all the characters must examine their hearts for true motives and new understanding. Predictably—it’s a holiday film, after all—long-buried secrets are revealed, and hearts are broken and remolded to become whole again. The Thoenes have created a tale sure to draw readers eager for drama and escape.
