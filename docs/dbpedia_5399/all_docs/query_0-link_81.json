        "text": "On 3 April I posted a note from the Official Beyond The Farthest Star that if you go to the site, and see a giant button that says \"Demand It\" - click on it and register. The more names they collect, the demand it button helps show their distributors that there are people who really want to see the film come to their area and that includes outside the US. You can only register once. It takes you info and area and you can only do that once. So, they just need lots of people registering but once each.\n\nThe \"Demand It\" button was faulty and it was reported to the official site and this is their response:\n\nJust want to let you know that the programming issue regarding the Demand It and Register buttons has been corrected on the Beyond The Farthest Star site. This statement will be included in our update coming out tomorrow. Please encourage the fans to try again.\n\nNOTE: Error Messages Appeared If You Attempted To Enter Your Information By Clicking Both DEMAND IT And REGISTER Buttons. The Situation Was A Flaw In Programming And Has Been Corrected. PLEASE TRY AGAIN! The REGISTER button ensures you receive weekly updates as the film continues production and into distribution. The DEMAND IT! button shows our distributor the number of people requesting the film in their area. Thank You!"
