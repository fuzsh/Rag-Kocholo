        "text": "A/an and the: meaning\n\nA/an and the are articles. They are a type of determiner and they go before a noun.\n\nA/an before a noun shows that what is referred to is not already known to the speaker, listener, writer and/or reader (it is the indefinite article):\n\nDo you have a car?\n\nA:\n\nDo you live in a house?\n\nB:\n\nNo, actually, I live in an apartment.\n\nThe before a noun shows that what is referred to is already known to the speaker, listener, writer and/or reader (it is the definite article):\n\nWhere did we park the car? (The speaker and the listener know what car is being referred to.)\n\nWe had to paint the apartment before we sold it. (The speaker and the listener know what apartment is being referred to.)\n\nThe makes a noun specific.\n\nCompare\n\nWhen do we use articles?\n\nA/an and the with types of nouns\n\nCountable nouns\n\nWe only use a/an with singular countable nouns:\n\nI have a sister and a brother.\n\nThat was an excellent meal.\n\nWe can use the with singular and plural countable nouns:\n\nThe lion roared.\n\nThe tree fell.\n\nThe lions roared.\n\nThe trees fell.\n\nUncountable nouns\n\nWe don’t use a/an before uncountable nouns:\n\nCould I have rice instead of potatoes with my fish?\n\nNot: Could I have a rice\n\nI hope we have nice weather.\n\nNot: I hope we have a nice weather.\n\nWe can use the before uncountable nouns when they refer to a specific example:\n\nThe rice we bought in the Thai shop is much better than the supermarket rice.\n\nThe weather was awful last summer.\n\nTo talk about an individual quantity or more than one quantity of an uncountable noun, we use expressions such as a bit of, a piece of or a [specific measure] of:\n\nThat’s an amazing bit of news.\n\nNot: That’s an amazing news.\n\nWe just made a big bowl of pasta.\n\nNot: We just made a pasta.\n\nCould I have a litre of milk, please?\n\nNot: Could I have a milk, please?\n\nGeneral nouns\n\nWe only use the with general plural nouns when we are referring to a specific set within a general class of people or things.\n\nCompare\n\nWe can make general nouns specific by using an article and adding more information after the noun.\n\nInventions, musical instruments and cultural institutions\n\nWhen we talk in general about inventions, musical instruments or cultural institutions (such as the cinema, the theatre, the circus, the opera, the ballet), we often use the:\n\nThe computer must be the greatest invention ever. (The computer as an invention in general, not a specific computer)\n\nThe violin sounds different to the viola.\n\nI love a night at the opera.\n\nSee also:\n\nNouns\n\nNo article before determiners (any, some, my, this)\n\nWe don’t use an article with other words that specify a noun (determiner), e.g. any, some, my, her, this, that:\n\nThe with things that are universally known\n\nWe use the with things known to everyone (the sun, the stars, the moon, the earth, the planet) because they are a part of our physical environment or part of the natural world:\n\nThe earth moves around the sun.\n\nWe lay on the grass and watched the stars.\n\nPlaces\n\nWe use the with mountain ranges and some mountains (the Alps, the Eiger), groups of islands (the West Indies), rivers (the Danube), deserts (the Gobi Desert), seas (the Black Sea), geographical regions or habitats (the Amazon rainforest), motorways (the M42), the names of some countries (the People’s Republic of China).\n\nWe don’t usually use articles with individual mountains or lakes when the name includes Mount or Lake: Mount Fuji, Lake Victoria. We don’t use articles with continents (Asia), countries (Romania), towns (Edinburgh), and streets (Lombard Street).\n\nThe with groups within society\n\nWhen we talk about particular groups or people within society, we use the + adjective:\n\nI think the rich should pay more tax and that the poor shouldn’t pay any.\n\nThe young need to be encouraged and supported in society.\n\nThe with dates\n\nWhen we say a specific date, we use the, but when we write it, we don’t use the:\n\nSpeaking: ‘I’ll see you on the twenty fourth of May.’\n\nWriting: I’ll see you on 24th May.\n\nWhen we talk about months, we don’t use the:\n\nMy birthday is in September.\n\nMay is my favourite month of all.\n\nWhen we talk about seasons in general, we can use either in or in the. In without the is often used in more formal or literary contexts:\n\nThese birds arrive in Britain in summer, and leave as the winter begins.\n\nIn the summer, we usually go to the mountains.\n\nWe rarely get snow in the winter.\n\nWhen we talk about a specific season, we use the:\n\nThe winter of 1947 was one of the coldest in Britain.\n\nWe’ll definitely visit you in the summer. (meaning next summer)\n\nSee also:\n\nNouns\n\nThe with Internet, radio and newspaper but mostly not with TV\n\nI looked it up on the Internet.\n\nNot: on internet\n\nShe was on the radio once.\n\nNot: on radio\n\nDid you see that story about parrots in the newspaper?\n\nNot: in newspaper\n\nThere’s usually nothing on TV. (TV means television)\n\nThere’s usually nothing on the television. (less common)\n\nThe with go to, be at, be in hospital, school, prison\n\nWhen we talk about the activity that happens in a building rather than about the building itself, we don’t use the.\n\nCompare\n\nwithout the\n\nwith the\n\nWe don’t use the with bed when we go there to sleep:\n\nI always go to bed at eleven o’clock.\n\nNot: I always go to the bed …\n\nWe don’t use the before work when we talk about the place where we do our job:\n\nThey go to work at 8 am every morning.\n\nNot: They go to the work …\n\nPossessive expressions\n\nWe don’t use the to refer to an individual’s behaviour or to parts of an individual’s body:\n\nHe spends most of his free time playing computer games.\n\nNot: He spends most of the free time …\n\nI must wash my hands.\n\nNot: I must wash the hands.\n\nThis, that and articles\n\nWe can use this instead of a/an or the, and these instead of zero article or some when we tell stories and jokes to create a sense of the present:\n\n[beginning of a joke]\n\nThere was this chicken who wanted to cross the road … (compare There was a chicken who wanted to cross the road …)\n\nThese tourists came into the restaurant once and they ordered fifteen Irish coffees. (compare Some tourists came into the restaurant once and they ordered …)\n\nSpoken English:\n\nIn informal speaking, we can use that as an alternative to the in stories when we refer to something familiar or known to the listener. That highlights the fact that the thing being referred to is known to the speaker and listener:\n\nA:\n\nWhere did you buy your skirt? I really like it.\n\nB:\n\nI got it at that new shop next to Green’s Hotel. (compare I got it at the new shop next to Green’s Hotel.)\n\nA/an and the: typical errors\n\nWe don’t use the with plural nouns when we are referring to things in general:\n\nWe have to protect wild animals. (referring to wild animals in general)\n\nNot: the wild animals.\n\nWe don’t use the when we refer in general to something abstract or uncountable:\n\nI love Japanese food. (all Japanese food/Japanese food in general)\n\nNot: I love the Japanese food.\n\nWe don’t use the when the noun is not known to the listener or reader:\n\nLast Sunday, we saw a film called ‘Nightmare’. (The speaker doesn’t think that the listener knows of this film.)\n\nNot: … we saw the film called ‘Nightmare’.\n\nWe don’t use the instead of a possessive pronoun:\n\nThe police asked us to put our hands up.\n\nNot: The police asked us to put the hands up.\n\nWe don’t use an article with go to bed:\n\nI go to bed at eleven most nights.\n\nNot: I go to the bed at eleven most nights."
