This is an original, rolled, one-sheet movie poster from 2006 for Poseidon starring Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss, Jacinda Barrett and Emmy Rossum. Wolfgang Petersen directed the remake of The Poseidon Adventure (1972).

The double-sided, teaser poster measures 27" x 40" and is in very good to excellent condition with minor edge wear from handling. Like many theatrical movie posters printed after 1990, this poster is double-sided. The image on the back of the poster is a mirror image of the front.

Please look closely at the photo (this is the exact poster you are buying).

This rare and collectible poster, printed in 2006 to tease the theatrical release of Poseidon, is not a reproduction or a reprint.
