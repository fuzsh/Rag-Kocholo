This is an original, linen-backed, one-sheet theatrical movie poster from 1972 for The Poseidon Adventure starring Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall, and Shelley Winters. Ronald Neame and Irwin Allen directed the classic ocean-liner disaster film. Mort Kunstler is the artist for the poster.

The poster measures 27" x 41" and has been linen-backed for long-term preservation and display. Prior to restoration, the poster was in very good condition with pinholes in the corners from theatrical display, creasing and minor wear around some of the the fold lines, and a few, minor surface scuffs from handling. It was folded at the time of printing and but the fold lines are less noticeable after restoration. Linen-backed posters are stored flat and rolled for shipping in a rigid, tube mailer.

Please look closely at the photos (this is the exact poster you are buying). It is not cropped or a stock image. The black circles in the corners of the poster are magnets and not pins.

This rare and collectible poster, printed in 1972 to promote the theatrical release of The Poseidon Adventure, is not a reproduction or a reprint.
