        "text": "The mother of all disaster films - this is certainly the one that started it all. Released in December of 1972 - The Poseidon Adventure was produced by Irwin Allen and based on a novel by Paul Gallico. Ronald Neame directed the film that tells the story of the S.S. Poseidon on its final voyage. At midnight on New Years Eve the Poseidon comes face to face with a huge tidal wave which capsizes the luxury liner. Quickly realizing that the only way out is to travel up to what is now the bottom of the ship - a group of nine passengers follow the Reverend Scott through hell and high water to survive. The star studded cast crawl, climb and swim their way through the upside down death ship - meeting one obstacle after another to reach the engine room - the only hope for escape. This movie is exciting and action packed with a wonderful cast of actors and remains one of my all time favorites. We saw this movie at the Shore Theatre over and over that summer. I was 9 years old and I am still fascinated by it to this day."
