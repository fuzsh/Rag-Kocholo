        "text": "I voted \"awesome\". But I donÂ´t like the Petersen remake, just the original movie with Gene Hackman.\n\nOf course. Nothing beats Gene Hackman hanging off that valve telling God where to step off.\n\nWell, since the fictional Poseidon was portrayed on-screen by the real-life Queen Mary, which was a pretty awesome ship, I vote \"awesome\"!\n\nBTW, among its many achievements, the QM was the largest and fastest troop ship in service during World War II, and transported more than three-quarters of a million military personnel.\n\nOne minor correction: The Queen Mary was a North Atlantic liner, not a cruise ship. Different types of vessels with different functions (although some, like the Queen Elizabeth 2, were designed to do both jobs).\n\nOkay, I'll bite: What's the difference between \"cruise ship\" and \"North Atlantic liner\"?\n\nNow I might be wrong but Ocean Liners generally run a regular scheduled service i.e. Southhampton-New York i.e Transportation is it's primary purpose. Cruise ships aren't designed primarily for transportation but rather entertainment. In fact I think there is only one really one Ocean Liner left the QM2\n\nI love the original 1972, seen it many, many, many times.\n\nSPOILER (Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's an old movie, but I still had a Star Trek plot ruined in this site even though it was \"old\", so this one's for you guys!)\n\nIt was the first time I saw a non-Superman film with Gene Hackman and was traumatized by the end.\n\nI remember when I heard there was a sequel, I was hoping they'd find Hackman alive and well in the ship, but alas, they only found Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, and other actors.\n\nWhat traumatized me in the original film was Roddy McDowall drowning halfway through. That bit wasn't in the MAD magazine parody so I didn't see it coming.\n\nHaving Slim Pickens outlive Karl Malden by five minutes was almost as traumatizing in the sequel. (We're only told Malden dies.) Michael Caine survived, but BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE's designated ''Borgnine'', Peter Boyle (the angriest guy) gets it at the two-thirds point. This was also Angela Cartwright's second, and last, major theatrical film.\n\nI just Amazoned the BEYOND book which is also written by Paul Gallico, but it's done as a sequel to the first film's characters who made it, not the 14 survivors from his earlier novel. Only the three adult male survivors go back into the ship. I believe this follow-up book does in Jack Albertson's character.\n\nThe original novel kills off the young boy off-''camera.'' He vanishes and is never found. At the end the ship sinks.\n\nLong ago this was my second favorite film ever. It's about 56th or 57th now.\n\nMe and the wife tried to watch \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\" recently and had a very hard time getting into it and we ended up turning it off.\n\nWhat a silly sequel.\n\nEven though Michael Caine is the star (and we both LOVE Caine), we still couldn't get into it.\n\nI could never remember how Wilbur (Malden) dies. What happens to him? I just assumed I got bored and didn't notice his death, but you say it happened off-screen? Weird, since he's one of the stars. I wonder if Malden quit the project.\n\nAnyway, the whole idea of climbing back into that monster seems like a total suicide mission. Even if I self-rationalize the exercise as a 70s version of \"urban archaeology\", \"extreme sports\", or that Caine was an adrenaline junkie, I still can't suspend my disbelief that people, especially an old guy, would just walk in there when the thing could sink or explode at any moment.\n\nThen again, they had Sally Field---at her most annoying ---tagging along, so they might've been hoping Sally would sink with the Poseidon. Now that I think about it, I think it was Sally Field's grating performance that overpowered Caine's natural charm and made me turn off the movie. She should've won a Razzie for this one. Horrible!"
