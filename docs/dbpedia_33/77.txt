As one of the founding members of Kraftwerk, Ralf Hutter has been a force in electronic music and popular culture. What a lot of people don’t know, however, is that Hütter is an avid cyclist. He was involved in a serious cycling accident in 1983, which put him in a coma. Seems fitting that one of the few songs to leak onto bootlegs was called “Tour De France”. These oversized eyeglasses are amplified with an oversized circular Lucite extension and polished off with large black Swarovski Elements crystal cup chain on the outer circle and medium sized Swarovski Elements crystal cup chain on the inner frame.
