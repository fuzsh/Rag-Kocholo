        "text": "I have waited to read this book for over a decade. It was one of those books I always wanted to read but was never able to find. A few weeks ago while visiting a local bookstore in Seattle I came across a used copy. My boyish delight was instant. I felt like a kid who had just received a much wanted bicycle on Christmas.\n\nI just couldn’t put this book down. I read it from cover to cover in just a few days. The sign of a good book, for me, is when I just don’t want the story to end. Couldn’t Wolfgang have made this a trilogy, perhaps!? What I would give to spend an afternoon in Dusseldorf talking to Wolfgang about his recollections and his point of view on life in this era. Reading this biography was perhaps one of the most enlightening books I have read from a member of a band.\n\nIn the first chapters of the book, Flür points out that he would not be talking about synthesizers, oscillators, LFO’s or things like modulation, etc. Nonetheless, I believe he does a stellar job of describing the electronics used by Kraftwerk during his time in the company of the other robots. He even does a good job of highlighting some details of the Kling Klang studio. From the Bonn (Matten & Wiechers) custom made analog sequencers, EMU Emulators, Synclaviers and the early synthesizers used, you’ll find plenty of this within the pages. He even points out that they didn’t have much more than a Moog Minimoog and an ARP Odyssey for their first albums. They relied more on their creativity to achieve results, not just technology.\n\nI found it particularly fascinating to learn about the custom drum pad he says he created in the early 1970’s. If he is correct, then perhaps he should be cited as a pioneer of circuit bent instruments.\n\nThere were moments in the book where he becomes greatly endearing to me. I am fascinated by analog sequencers. Though for Flür it was the start of a change in his value as a drummer. The dawn of machine controlled sound is where I take my early inspirations from. Yet, here he reminds me of what many of the musicians I knew growing up in Las Vegas must’ve experienced when they were replaced by MIDI sequencers and ROM based synthesizers.\n\nIn the book he reminds us that he is a romantic. Though, I would argue he is also a sentimentalist. He describes Germany with such a passion, to almost make me envious of his experiences. There is also clever humor throughout the book too. His narrative throughout the book is engaging and entertaining.\n\nI have read reviews where people say he seems bitter of his time with Kraftwerk. However, I never got this impression while reading it. Does he come across as feeling betrayed and disillusioned by some of his former band-mates at times? Of course he does. This is a normal reaction and proves that he is more than just a Man synced with a machine. Still, despite this focus by critics, I never built up any animosity about Ralf Hütter or Florian Schneider. Maybe one day in my lifetime the other robots will disconnect from the machines and share with us their views.\n\nI can’t believe this photo has received so many views on Flickr. It’s been up for less than a week.\n\nWe had a pretty good time setting up for this shoot. We shot over a dozen synthesizers that day, July 17th 2010 to be exact. We listened to a bunch of records and drank some beers while we took photographs. We listened mostly to stuff from the 1980’s. Tracks that featured the synthesizer of course.\n\nWhen we talked about covers for the book, I was thinking I’d use my favorite synthesizer of all time, the Prophet 5 Synthesizer!\n\nI first became aware of the Prophet 5 synthesizer while I was living in Miami, around the early 80’s. MTV was just launching and Florida was one of the first states to get MTV. I was there for the launch of the best idea to ever hit cable TV. It’s such a shame that MTV turned into something different. During the early 1980’s it became my daily ritual to watch MTV. I would come home from school and if I could get it in, MTV would be on most of the time. I remember The Buggles video for Video Killed the Radio Star. There was The Fixx with Saved By Zero. There was Peter Gabriel’s, Shock the Monkey. Of course there was always as many Duran Duran videos as a person could wish for. It’s around this time that I really started to notice the synthesizer.\n\nOne of the first synthesizers to leave a mark on me was the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5. I remember seeing Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen, I think it was him, playing a Prophet 5 synthesizer in Nena’s 99 Luft Balloons (99 Red Balloons) video. Oh, that wood! Ralf Hütter, of Kraftwerk probably hated the Prophet 5 just because it was made of wood. That’s one of the reasons why I liked it though. It had lots of knobs. It was futuristic, but still wanting to fit in with the organ player using it in a rock band or something.\n\nIn a 1984 Keyboard magazine I read an interview with David Diamond and Matt Reid of Berlin. I still have the issue. They were really big users of the Prophet 5. A month later it was Mark Isham singing it praises and talking about how he used it for 95% of the synthesizer cues on the Disney movie Never Cry Wolf. He would become one of my favorite film composers.\n\nDave Ball of Soft Cell, Jerry Harrison of the Talking Heads, John Carpenter, David Sylvian, Richard Barbieri and many, many others artist are well known for their use of the Prophet 5 synthesizer. Sylvian and Barbieri are rumored to have invested an incredible amount of time tweaking sounds on the synthesizers they used for Japan’s, Tin Drum. The Prophet 5 was at the core of those sessions and an Oberheim OBX. Producer/Engineer Steve Nye was brought to the brink of a breakdown as they slaved away endlessly creating sounds. They all played a pivotal role in helping me build an adoration for this Sequential Circuits synthesizer.\n\nIt was Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran that I remember most for using the Prophet 5, however. MTV became synonymous with Duran Duran. They capitalized on the use of video better than anyone. The video helped Duran Duran sell lots of records. I still like The Chauffer and Rio. They always had beautiful women in their videos. The video was becoming a new way to sell music to a buying public. For Duran Duran there was Girls on Film, Careless Memories, and Planet Earth. Nick Rhodes is perhaps best known for his use of the Roland Jupiter 8. For me though, I couldn’t keep my eyes off his Prophet 5 synthesizer in those videos. I saw him use it on TV concerts, live in studio appearances, and all the shows bands appeared on, in the 1980’s. Think Top of the Pops. I don’t think Duran Duran played on Solid Gold! Did they? I wonder. They did play on Soul Train a few years later, though I don’t recall seeing a Prophet 5!\n\nIt would be years later that I would get my hands on a Prophet 5. Well after I left university. For a very long time all I had was magazine photographs of the Prophet 5. They were too expensive when they were first introduced in 1978 and they remained expensive to a teenager like me years later. To me it was like owning some 1950’s Porsche or something. I created a grand mystique for it. They were starting to go up in price when I got mine, but the prices still weren’t prohibitive. This one is a Rev 3.2. The one just before MIDI was introduced. It has the extra banks of patches too. I had it MIDI’d a couple of years back by Stephen Jones in Seattle.\n\nI’ll post more pictures of the Prophet 5 soon."
