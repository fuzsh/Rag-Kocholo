        "text": "Hanna BÃ¤cher\n\nA very warm welcome to Michael Rother.\n\n[applause]\n\nMichael Rother\n\nHello.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nWhat we just saw was that Kraftwerk minus Ralf, or was it Neu! plus Florian?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThat was a hipster band. Last year, we performed. [laughs]\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nWilliamsburg. Michael Rother Trio.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThat was the lineup of Kraftwerk for six months in 1971. Ralf HÃ¼tter had decided to go back to university, and thatâs why I was invited to join the band and to perform live. Actually, this wasnât one of the best concerts, quite the opposite.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nI thought it was quite good.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nYeah, yeah, I know. Many people think they like it, but that was a huge TV studio with only four technicians, so we were playing, like, in sort of outer space. There was no feedback, nothing from the audience, and at the time, we were really dependent on communication with the audience. Anyway, if you like it, itâs fun.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nOne of the reasons that you were dependent on interaction with an audience is that youâve actually never recorded anything with Kraftwerk, at least not anything that got released. Why was that?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThe distinction is right. We did record, I think, about 25 minutes with Conny Plank as co-producer in 1971, but halfway through, that was already near the end of our collaboration, and we realized that in the studio it didnât work. This was very wild, improvised music, and in the studio, we had the same clinical situation, and we didnât really get far, so we decided to stop, and the tapes are probably in the vault with Florian Schneider.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nWould you like to rerelease that, or ever release it?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nIâm not so sure if thatâs really worthy of a release, but for historical reasons, of course, it would be interesting toâ¦ Actually, maybe, I think most of you are musicians. At least thatâs what I was told.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nThatâs true.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nOkay. And so, some of you, or most of you may know that Kraftwerk deny, or they do not look upon the first three albums as the real Kraftwerk concept, which is really sad. After Florian Schneider left a few years ago, they considered the beginning of the real Kraftwerk era, Autobahn, which was, I think, released in â74. And so the first three albums are kept under the carpet. Iâm not sure, because thereâs always demand by the audience to have those albums released, and there have been talks, and sometimes there have been promises, but I think itâs just their decision, of course, which has to be accepted. Itâs an artistic decision, which is unfortunate because especially, I think, the third album has some really beautiful music.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nIf you had to pin down the artistic differences between you and Klaus Dinger, who is on the drums and Ralf and Florian, how would you describe that?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nYou mean between Neu! and Kraftwerk?\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nWell, between the four of you when you still played together, what did you want that was different than those two?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nI didnât get the question, really.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nIâm sorry, two Germans on the couch.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThe thing is, I jammed with Ralf HÃ¼tter but I never played as Kraftwerk with Ralf HÃ¼tter.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nOkay.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThatâs a different situation. I only played with Florian and Klaus. I guess when we started the project Neu!, after splitting with Kraftwerk, we did take some of the experiences with us, of course. And the first track on the first Neu! album, maybe some of you know it, âHallogallo,â which is one of the most popular Neu! tracks, I guess, that features a very soft approach to this fast-forward-reaching music, which was our idea at that time; a music that sort of runs forward and has no ending, is aimed at the horizon, or beyond. I guess, that is part of an analysis, a conclusion, of the experiences we had with playing with Kraftwerk.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nWhat we just saw was in â71, so you were 21 years old, I suppose.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nTwenty, yeah.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nWhere were you living at the time, and what did you do musically other than being in Kraftwerk?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nI was living in DÃ¼sseldorf, and I was working in a mental institute, a hospital. I was aâ¦ What is it? A conscientious objector because I refused to serve in the military at the time. Iâm not sure, how is the situation? Okay. Many nationalities, different in every country. These days, in Germany, I think you just have to send in a postcard, or maybe there isnât even any draft anymore.\n\nAudience Member\n\n[inaudible]\n\nMichael Rother\n\nSo we have like, a professional Army now without any material. [laughs] Iâm not complaining. But at the time, it was very difficult because it was still the time of the Cold War. I guess, not many around here have any memories of their own of that time, which was a time of paranoia, world politics, struggles between West and East, East and West. And in Germany, there was always this fear of being invaded by the Soviet Union, by the Army, whether it was realistic or not. That was the situation, and so the German government made it very hard for people not to serve in the Army, do service, and you had to have good reasons. You had to prove that your conscience forbade you to serve in the military; that you were not able to pick up a weapon. At this very serious court hearing, they tried to trick you with trick questions, like, âWhat would you do if a Russian soldier storms into your flat and wants to rape your grandmother?â Or something like that. Yeah, it was really terrible, and we argued along for an hour. Of course, we didnât get anywhere, and in the end, they just said, âOkay, you didnât convince us, but anyway, here you go. We donât want you in the Army anyway.â [laughs] They were probably happy to get rid of me. I wouldâve just caused problems in the Army, making other people catch the idea of resisting that idea. Anyway, sorry, thatâs a long excursion now. And so I was working in this mental institute near DÃ¼sseldorf, which was a wonderful experience, by the way, a very valuable experience to serve people with handicaps. I even had a band in that hospital for a while consisting of some patients and also some of the active people working there. So what was the question again, half an hour ago? That was what I was doing at the time. Okay, now I got it. One day, we were in the streets of DÃ¼sseldorf. There were so many issues we were fighting about with authorities. There was still the very conservative attitude and the structures, political and social structures, and we were opposing many of these ideas. There was one guitar player who was also working in that hospital, and he had an invitation to join a band called Kraftwerk in the studio.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nHad you heard of them before that?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nNo, I didnât know the music. I hadnât heard the bandâs name at all, and I thought it was quite silly.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nDid you think the same thing when you first heard the music, your first meeting with them and them playing music to you, did you think itâs silly or did you like it?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nI didnât get that.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nWhen Kraftwerk first played their music to you?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nNo, the thing was, I went into the studio. I picked up a bass, and I jammed with Ralf HÃ¼tter. I didnât know anything of the background, it was just that it was a very special situation. Florian Schneider and Klaus Dinger were sitting in the studio in chairs and listening on a sofa, actually, listening, enjoying it, and Ralf HÃ¼tter and I, we also had a great time. That was, for me, the first situation where I discovered that I was not completely alone with my idea of creating a music that was different, different from Anglo- American musical structures that are mostly, or were mostly, based on the blues. That was one of the main ideas I had. I wanted to steer away from that. Of course, also, I tried to forget all the heroes of the time before, and to start a new way.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nWho were the heroes of the time before for you?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nWhere should I start? Well, okay, maybe I should start in my teenage times. When my family returned from Pakistan, where we stayed for three years, that was â63, the big time of the British beat explosion, I think was the name that was given, with all these exciting bands, Beatles, Kinks, Stones, and many more. I was completely blown away by that music. Many of my friends at school, they all wanted to start a band, play in a band, so that was the situation. It was really a very fresh movement of music, a big change happened in the early â60s. Those were the early heroes. Later on, of course, also bands like Cream and Jimi Hendrix, whom I still love, I can say. I mean, I donât want to be Jimi Hendrix, I wanted to be a copy of Jimi Hendrix for a while when I was a teenager, but I luckily understood that I would never be a better Jimi Hendrix than the original. So, those were the heroes of the â60s.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nYou also had a another band when you were a teenager called Spirit of Sound, right? What happened to them then?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nUnfortunately, the band fell apart when I told them that I was leaving.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nTo go to Kraftwerk?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nYes. Actually, the band was already at a dead end. We developed, we started in the mid-â60s by being really pure copycats, and then over the years, like I grew older, and we got more ambitious. We started improvising more, adding more of our own ideas, and tried to push the boundaries, the limits. But that came to an end. Of course, back then, I didnât know what would happen ten years later, but I was getting more dissatisfied every month, and so it was like a lucky star that I met, ran into the Kraftwerk people, and everything changed from then on.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nYou also left them, together with the drummer. You had first met Klaus Dinger in Kraftwerk, you werenât friends before that?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThatâs right. I didnât know any of those people. Iâd never heard of the band, and I was working in the hospital, and when I was not working in the hospital I was with my girlfriend, so there was not any connection to the musical scene in DÃ¼sseldorf at all.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nShould we listen to âHallogallo,â maybe, that you mentioned before? Released, I think, in 1973, is that right? â72? Thank you.\n\n(music: Neu! â âHallogalloâ / applause)\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThank you.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nYou have mentioned Conny Plank before who did record the never-released Kraftwerk stuff with you in the lineup, and he also recorded the first Neu! album. So maybe to the people who donât know who Conny Plank is, introduce him?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nWow, where should I start? I mean, we would all have gotten nowhere, I guess, without Conny Plank. He was so important. He was an innovative sound engineer who was willing to take risks with all these crazy musicians with no money, big ideas and no money in the pocket. The truth is, really, we owe Conny Plank so much itâs hard to express. Iâm quite 100% sure that, especially the first Neu! album would never have gone that far without Connyâs contributions. I guess itâs quite difficult today to imagine with how little gear Conny Plank was able to create those soundscapes. Today, with all the electronic devices that at a fingerâs touch add crazy effects, and which are used, of course, like Kaoss pads, maybe some of you know the Kaoss pads, which are great, but back then, if I remember correctly, and Iâm quite sure that there wasnât anything else but a tape machine that he used for delays. Just a stereo delay, one delay, and then a reverb chamber next door, and maybe a limiter or two for the drums, and everything else was just the result of clever manipulation, of thinking the right things, of memorizing the good elements, which were scattered all over the [recording]. Well, it was only eight-track actually, the first [recordings], but still, eight tracks. Because we recorded those songs without having a clear idea when we started, it was just like action painting. Thatâs an image I sometimes bring up because Klaus Dinger and I, we lay down a basic track. We went into the studio, Klaus played drums, I played guitar or bassâ¦ And each of us, we didnât actually talk about music, but we just sat there, and then we inspired each other by adding overdubs. And Conny Plank added great inspiration by his thoughts, his recommendations. In âHallogallo,â for instance, maybe you will have recognized that some of the guitars are played backwards, and so I was in the recording room doing an overdub guitar, and Conny Plank decided to turn the tape around, so everything was running backwards, and whether he knew it, I donât know, or notâ¦ I love everything music that runs backwards or is slowed down, and even better, slowed down and running backwards. [laughs]\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nIâm sure there are some people in the room that would play your songs with their stuff that has this element all the way through it.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nYeah, itâs just the excitement of music running backwards, theâ¦ Of course, your ideas are also turned around, and something completely different happens. By the way, Jimi Hendrix did wonderful backwards guitars. Anyway, so when Conny Plank turned around the tape, that really pushed me and inspired me to record new melodies on top. Yes, Conny Plank worked for Kraftwerk, for Neu!, with Cluster, Harmonia, and later on with Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, DAF, as far as I know. He was involved, from my point of view, in nearly all of the exciting new experimental rock music that came out in the early â70s. Unfortunately, Conny passed away in 1987, but he really left a big, big mark in music, andâ¦ So, thanks to Conny.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nHow much time did you actually have to record this first album?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nNot much time. Actually, we had four days to record, do the recordings, and then one week for the mixing, which we did in another studio. I already explained that we did not, or maybe I did not explain in detailâ¦ If you try to imagine the situation in the early â70s, no multitrack of course, no computer at home enabling you to do sketches of the music. It was all inside our minds, and all I had was a tape cassette, mono or stereo, I donât know, which I could use to just memorize maybe a melody, like the melody of âWeissenseeâ on the first Neu! album. Everything else was just a vision of music, and it happened on the spot while we were in the studio. And so, four days, you can imagine, with overdubsâ¦ Itâs like running forward. Itâs also a working method, like the track âHallogallo.â Not much time to waste. And that, although, of course, we were limited by the lack of money. I would have loved to have four weeks back then, but that was just unrealistic. On the positive side, of course I had this pressure â maybe Klaus felt it too, Iâm not so sure â but I definitely felt the pressure of the time ticking away, you know, the days running out. But on the other side, the positive side, this limitation forces you to sharpen your ideas and to come to a conclusion very quickly. Later on, we may touch that later on, when I started my own studio with equipment, and since then, the available time to record, to create your ideas and to record, is factually limitless, and hard disks and whatever are so cheap you can just make notes of every single idea. The problem or the danger is, of course, because youâre not forced to come to the conclusion and to make decisions, actually, you can get lost quite easily. It happens to me. It happens to many musicians I know. But back then, the limitations were there, and we knew, âOkay, now we have to get this song together and finish and then time is over.â\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nI talked to some members of Can, and they said that overdubbing killed Can. So as soon as they werenât forced to just go in the studio together and play one song at once to record it to 2-track, it was over, because the magic was gone, because you could redo everything, and they had their own studio, so limitless time. Did you and Klaus then practice outside of the studio? Did you play a lot together when you were not recording with Conny Plank for four nights?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nI think we didnât even once make any music together outside of the studio. We tried to play live in â72, and then I remember we played together in a small space that he had in his flat. But before we went into the studio, there was absolutely no way of playing, of creating the ideas. It was really happening on the spot.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nWas all that in Hamburg, or was it in DÃ¼sseldorf?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThe first Neu! album, actually the first two Neu! albums were recorded in rental studios in Hamburg, which was, of course, the reason for the clock ticking away. And the third Neu! album in 1974, Conny Plank started his own recording studio near Cologne, and then we had much more time, and much more tracks, which also created problems. Actually, the second Neu! album, which we recorded in â72, late â72, and early â73, we recorded that on 16-track, and that caused these problems, which I already mentioned. Doing all these overdubs, the time just flies away. I donât know how many of you know the story of the second Neu! album, which has two very different sides. The first side was what we were actually aiming at, but we spent so much time recording those tracks, that at the end of the week, we didnât have music for the second side, and so that was the time when we had to make drastic measures.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nI might play âSuper 78â to illustrate that.\n\n(music: Neu! â âSuper 16â / applause)\n\nKlaus, the lion.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nHow did you like it?\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nI would love to hear the Giorgio Moroder version of that.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nGiorgio Moroder only gave us the studio. We rented the studio. He was there, we met, but Conny Plank did the recordings. It was a very strange situation. I remember, itâs a very tall building in Munich. It was very famous at the time, Arabellahaus, and his studio was two floors, two stories below the surface of the earth. It was very strange to go down into that space with all these pipes and a long cellar running down the length of the house, and actually, we had to stop three times. We needed three takes for three-and-a-half minutes of âSuperâ because Klaus didnât get enough fresh air, so he just nearly suffocated, and after a minute of beating the drums the way he did, in a very spectacular way, he just fell off the drum stool.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nThereâs something really dangerous about this track because James Holden, who was here on Monday, said he once had a car crash because he listened to this track while driving, right?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nI have to refuse responsibility for that, [laughter] although I feel pity.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nIn this first half of the â70s, you were working with Klaus Dinger as Neu!, but you also met two other really nice fellows who happened to have sat on this couch. Well, on another couch but on one of our couches before, and thatâs Cluster, or as they say (German pronunciation] âKluhster.â How did you first meet?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nItâsâ¦ No, Iâm not going to do a Monty Python sketch now. [laughs]\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nOh, yes please, absolutely!\n\n[laughter]\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThereâs one about Miss Elk and the theory about the brontosaurus. Does anybody know that one? Donât tempt me. [laughs] Anyway, may I interrupt you and mention that thatâs what John Cleese as Miss Elk says at the BBC interview, very funny. Please check Monty Pythonâs Miss Elk theory about the brontosaurus because they are thin at one end, very thick in the middle, and then very thin at the far end. [laughs] Okay, sorry.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nThat relates you meeting Cluster? How?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nNo. No, no. I wanted to say, get back to that track âSuper 16,â which Tarantino, maybe some of you may have even recognized that tune because Tarantino used it in Kill Bill Part 1. Tarantino is a big fan of Eastern kung fu films, obviously, and there was this Chinese film director in the â70s who used our music without contacting us, without clearing any rights.\n\nAudience Member\n\n[inaudible / names film]\n\nMichael Rother\n\nWow, right. Up and down, all the music, Kraftwerk, Neu!, and maybe also Tangerine Dream. Iâm not so sure. Tarantino, being of a fan ofâ¦ Whatâs the name of the film director?\n\nAudience Member\n\n[inaudible] I canât recall right now.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nOkay, but anyway, so thatâs why Tarantino asked for, got permission to use that track, which is quite funny. When the evil guy shows up, thatâs the flying guillotine, and this track is used in the scene whereâ¦ Whatâs her name, the lady boss of the gangsters?\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nKill Bill fans in here?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nAnyway, before the killing starts, and she just appears on the balcony, and thenâ¦ [imitates Neu! track] Okay, sorry. When did I meetâ¦?\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nBack to reality. You were in Kill Bill land for a bit. Back to West Germany, early â70s.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThatâs right. After releasing the second Neu! album, Klaus and I, because I think I touched [on] that, we could work in the studio using the multitrack technique, of course. I could record several guitars, etc. and pianos and stuff, and Klaus could sing and do other instruments, and that didnât work live, obviously. With one man at the drums and one guitar player. The sound was not satisfying. We were not theâ¦ What are they? The White Stripes? So we had this invitation to do a tour to Great Britain by United Artists, the label that released our albums in the UK, and we had this problem that we didnât know any musicians who seemed suited. I mean, maybe now, looking back, it makes absolute sense because we tried to be different, so thatâs the reason why we didnât find any other people; we wanted to be different from everybody else. But then I heard this track on the Cluster album, the second, I think it was, called âIm SÃ¼den,â and I realized that there was something, there was a connection to my idea of melody and harmony. Do you have it on the [computer]?\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nI might. I might have it.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThatâs quite fascinating. Conny Plank was, of course, involved, and so I decided to pay a visit to those two musicians, and I took my guitar along and visited them in the place in the country. Actually, the place where I still live these days, in the middle of nowhere in Germany. Yeah, thatâs it.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nHow does this place look like exactly? What is it?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nIâm not sure about the English expression. Itâs a collection of houses. Itâs not connected to any city. Itâs outside. Itâs right next to the river Weser.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nNow thereâs stores, or is it literally just a few houses where people live in?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nNo stores, no, no. You have to ride on a bike for 15 minutes or drive with a car to the next store, and it is very quiet, quite the opposite of Tokyo, Shibuya at least, and very green. So the view from my window is amazing. It never fails to have this magic on me. I just see the river, and of course, in different seasons, you have different lights all the time. Nature has different colors, and after the river, thereâs only fields, and some kilometers away you have soft hills. Thatâs a very soothing atmosphere, veryâ¦ Itâs good for your soul, very relaxing.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nSo you moved there and started doing music with them?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nOkay, well, actually, it was the other way around. Because I was so fascinated by the music, in the beginning, I jammed with Hans-Joachim Roedelius [of Cluster] only. He played electric piano, and his way of playing the piano with repetition, repetition, repetitionâ¦ Going on like a loop, actually, but of course with some very cleverâ¦ He wasnât clever, it was just the result of the way he played with delay, etcetera; some movement in this pattern. But that was a perfect backdrop or combination with my guitar, and I immediately fell in love with that music, and it was so important that I decided to quit Neu!, quit DÃ¼sseldorf, and took my guitar and moved to that place, and we started the band Harmonia.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nShall we still listen to a bit of âIm SÃ¼denâ?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nPlease.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nSo thatâs without you, thatâs just Moebius and Roedelius.\n\n(music: Harmonia â âWatussiâ / applause)\n\nWho was in charge of that beat?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nPardon?\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nWho was in charge of that beat?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nIâm not totally sure, but it was on my drum machine. I had a veryâ¦ It was the beginning of drum machines, they were actually used by, how do you call these musicians playing in hotels on their own, solo entertainer, and so they had a companion, and those machines, it was a Farfisa model. It sounded like [messily beatboxes], something like that. Very silly, of course, on its own. So you had to do something with it.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nWhat did you do?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nErmâ¦ We chopped it up, slicing it.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nLike cutting tape.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nNo, not on tape. We ran the sound of the drum machine through different smallâ¦ We didnât have sophisticated gear, of course, we were poor musicians, very simple gear, butâ¦ For instance, a delay, and then very important was a Schaller Tremolo. Iâm not sure if anybody has heard of that. It was used in the late â50s and â60s by guitar players to doâ¦ [imitates guitar tremolo] Anyway, Iâm not a technician, so I cannot really explain, but it changes the amplitude, so the sound disappears, and then it comes up again, and depending on the speed, you could change the speed of that tremolo, and if you found the sweet spot where it connected to the delay and the beat, the tempo of the beat, and of course, the wah-wah pedal, andâ¦ At other occasions, we also used fuzz boxes, so everything that chopped up the original silly sound was just welcome, and in that case it was the tremolo, I guess, with the wah-wah pedal and a delay. Itâs a good example, that it is very special. Maybe I should also explain how we recorded because at the time, in â73, when I joined the two guys and we started Harmonia, we had two Revox stereo machines, A77, I think, was the type. I think theyâre still around. Itâs like a cult tape machine. We played together, we recorded on one machine, and then we ran that through a small mixer and recorded and played onto that track and then recorded the result on the next. Of course, we had tape hissing with every generation lost, added, but we had to do it. There was no multitrack, of course, affordable multitrack at the time, so we did this ping-ponging style, and thatâs how we recorded âWatussiâ and most of that stuff on the first Harmonia album. There are some live recordings also, which were only recorded during a concert, and nothing was changed. But âWatussiâ is a good example of all three of us adding their color, Moebius adding theseâ¦ [makes noises] Moebius has this amazing ability of surprising people byâ¦\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nGiving a shâ, basically.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nNo, no, he has very good taste, but he does not organize it. He just lets it happen, especially at that time, and sometimes it was terrible. All of us did terrible things from time to time, but sometimes it was slightly off, but when it was good, it was really great what Moebius especially contributed to the music and Roedelius played this piano, this organ sound, which just goes around in a loop, andâ¦ Maybe some of you know it better from musical theory, but I do not really understand where the pattern starts and where it stops, and that has been something that has always fascinated me, the idea of a loop, a repetition, something just going on and on and on.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nDo you think this has anything to do with you also growing up in Pakistan? Were you exposed to music back then that was played there that infected you with that idea of repetition?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nIâm pretty sure that being exposed to that magical-sounding music as a young boy, I was nine when we moved to Pakistan, and I heard these bands playing in the streets with, of course, harmonic scales, which I didnât understand, but it was just this music that kept on going. It kept on going without starting really and definitely not with any end, so it was a music, an idea of endless music, and of course, with completely different harmonic approach. This idea is still with me, and it was, of course, part of my thinking when we did Neu! and Harmonia.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nOn the other hand, you just talked about music theory. You did not have any academic or proper music school background, right?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThatâs right. I steered away from all theory. Iâm sure my teacher at school would have accepted any bet that this guy would never become a musician. [laughs]\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nYou are able to read notes now, or not? Are you able to read notes?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nNo, no. I canât make head or tail. No really. I donât need to read notes. For my music, itâs all in your ears and your mind and your heart, and what you donât have there you donât need on paper. But then, there are many ways to make music, so if somebody has the desire to learn to read notes, thatâs fine, but for me, it was never a question. I didnât want to. I didnât want to know also about theory. Actually, thereâs one story, there was one musician in DÃ¼sseldorf with whom we tried to work, and he was at university learning theory, and he was so restrained, knowing all [musical theories], âYou canât do this. This is not allowed. You should not do this.â Maybe that was the wrong perception he had, but I thought, âNo, I donât need any restraints. I want to be free to make all the mistakes and all the decisions.â Itâs all here [pats chest]. I donât really need notes, and I do not miss that.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nObviously, in this time in Germany in the early â70s, there were a lot of political changes, or people, not even in a political way but in a private way trying to live differently to what was the common idea of, I donât know, having your small family and being employed in a safe job. Did such ideas of doing it different than society go into the music that you were doing?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nWe were different, of course. You canât separate that. We gave up this idea of doing an academic way, or a normal job. Of course, I was very fortunate, I must say, looking back because of the lucky circumstances of meeting the right people at the right time, and if I hadnât run into the Kraftwerk studio, if I had decided to meet my girlfriend instead, I would probably never have met them, and everything wouldâve been different, but Roedelius and Moebiusâ¦ Roedelius is quite a bit older, he has a long history which I cannot really explain, but he had different jobs over the years, but Iâm not sure whether he even had any education, but all that was left behind just to make music. And while I was still at school, I thought Iâd maybe become a lawyer to help people. [laughs] That was the time ofâ¦\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nIs that what a lawyer does? Are you sure?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nYes, well, that was my understanding, reading Schillerâs Sturm und Drang period-books, pieces which really appealed to me at the time, and I thought, âYeah, that would be something, help the people.â Then later on, I was fascinated by psychology, and I even started studying psychology, but it didnât have a chance against music. Music was just too strong, the appeal, and because it was also made easy for me by the combination with Kraftwerk and then releasing the first Neu! album, I quit university, andâ¦ Yeah, for me, it was the right decision, definitely, being lucky.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nThatâs while weâll listen to another Harmonia recording that got recorded a few years later and features a quite rather famous guy.\n\n(music: Michael Rother â âFlammende Herzenâ)\n\n[comments] Sorry, I need to fast-forward to his drums.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThis was without Jaki, but actually, in the backgroundâ¦ Yeah, okay.\n\n[music continues / applause]\n\nJaki Liebezeit is a wonderful drummer. I guess most of you will know him. Heâs just a pure magician at the drums. He didnât need any rehearsing. We just went into the recording studio. I played guitar, and he picked up my intentions of drama, of moving on from the parts, and he just joined in and added some really wonderful drumming to that track, especially to âFlammende Herzen.â Amazing drummer, Jaki Liebezeit, still today.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nThatâs true. This was your very first solo recording, so itâs in â77, and basically when I look at, well, the many quite successful solo recordings that you did, thereâs a time before Fairlight and a time after Fairlight. And I think, funny enough, Marley Marl has mentioned the Fairlight music computer here the other day. But I suppose most people donât know what it looks like, so I might show a little video where it gets introduced from 1980.\n\n[video: Fairlight demo]\n\nâFor three days, this display center at Center Point was filled with silicon chips and floppy disks and liquid crystal display units. Now, for my money, the star of the show was this, the Fairlight computer musical instrument. Itâs $26,000 worth of electronic wizardry thatâs been developed over the last five years by Kim Ryrie and Peter Vogel. Peter, show us the amazing things it can do.â\n\nâWell, here weâre using a computer to actually generate the sounds that we hear, so instead of having vibrating strings or air controlled sound in conventional instruments, the computer generates the sound that we want, so the important thing is the ease with which the musician can define through the computer and this is just the sort of sound it was made for. Now, to make that easy, weâve created a light pen system through this device here that allows you to draw directly on this television screen the harmonic curves of our sound.â\n\nâNow, this is the picture of a sound. Thatâs what the sound looks like through the computer so that we know what the sound the computerâs thinking about. Would you like to show us what sound that is?â\n\nâWell, this particular spectrum sounds like this.â [musical chords]\n\nâRight, well, how does a composer work with the CMI Fairlight translator?â\n\nâWell, I might select to change one of these harmonics, taking the fifth harmonic here, and Iâm just working on that curve on its own, drawing a new one, so now that curve swells up towards here in there, and Iâll make the tenth harmonic through a similar sort of thing. And when I hit the compute command here, the computerâs now thinking about the curves Iâm drawing here and calculating the sound that it fed into spectrum analyzer, would look like that, and now that sound would be different.â\n\n[musical chords]\n\nâDepending on how my harmonics are growing in the direction of the sound.â\n\nâThatâs the kind of experimentation that a composer would engage in, but if he wanted a particular sound, the sound of a church bell or a trumpet or a violin, what does he do?â\n\nâWell, in those circumstances, we can simply plug the microphone into the machine and tell it, âOkay, computer, hereâs a sample of a sound that I want. See what you can do with it.â For example, with the human voice, we can say: blah! Thereâs the picture of that blah.â\n\nâSo thatâs the track of that, and you can then put that through the unit?â [computerized âblahsâ]\n\nâThatâs rather cute, isnât it?â\n\nâWhat about natural sound if you want to get the sound ofâ¦â\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nOkay, letâs stop that here. It goes on like this, but you can look it up yourself if you want. I quite like that he says, âThis is how the computer thinks the sounds look like,â or something with the computer.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nI havenât seen this before. It looks a bit like Monty Python even.\n\n[laughter]\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nItâs all Monty Python for you.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nOK, should I tell the story about how I discovered that world, or do you want to hear anything else?\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nIf youâd like to.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nOkay. I was at a film festival in 1982 with a short film, and I went to see a film I didnât know anything about. It was called Liquid Sky. Does anybody know that film? Yeah, very special film. I remember sitting in the dark room and not believing what I was hearing. The film was very crazy, but the music consisted of sounds I had never heard before, and so when I returned to Germany, I tried to find out where those sounds came from, how could you create those sounds? Andâ¦ I ended up in Munich. There was the German dealer of Fairlight systems, and so I drove down to Munich and bought that unit, which actually cost a lot more than $27,000, although I donât know what the exchange rate was at the time. It cost a fortune, it was impossible. You could buy a house at the time for that money. But because before that technology was available, there was no possibility for me to write music in the sense that I could make a machine play it, play the sounds, the melodies, the beats, etcetera, and also to add natural instruments, not âblah-blahâ but like, orchestral sounds. By the way, the sampling rate was 8-bit, and it sounded like a dustbin, looking back now. Of course, it is something that has a cult following. Everything sounds pure and great. 8-bit is suddenly interesting again. Maybe I should dust it and try to get it running again. I still have it in my studio, and it inspired me to, at least on two albums, toâ¦ I spent months just learning how to use that instrument. The guy already mentioned some software, which you had to buy separately. One was called Music Composition Language. I think Harold Faltermeyer might have mentioned that. You had to enter all the data and semicolon, brackets, semi-brackets, the round brackets, and everything meant something different, and for each note, for each single note, how long it should last, how loud it should be, etc. That, of course, took a lot of concentration and fun. You had to be excited about the possibilities to spend hours and days writing that mathematical stuff, and then some of the best things happened when I made some mistakes programming. When I played back, suddenly something completely different happened, and I thought, âWhoa, this is even better.â That was the result of programming on the Fairlight.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nShall we listen to a bit. This is âPalmengarten.â\n\n(music: Michael Rother â âPalmengartenâ / applause)\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThank you.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nDoesnât sound much like semicolons.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nYeah, of course. That was just the way to do it. It was still emotional, and it was a complex thing, and because of the perfection on one side, I made sure that I added enough handmade music, like played my guitar, which of course had all the errors, slight errors and inaccuracies, and the combination, I think, worked quite well. You can tell me if you like it or not, but you donât have to. [laughs]\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nIâm actually quite into it, in all honesty.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nWell, the funny thing is, just a few days ago, I got an email from my friend Aaron Mullen of Tall Firs in New York, and Steve Shelley had written him, âHey, have a look at this, Iggy Pop played âPalmengartenâ and two other Michael Rother tracks on his BBC playlist.â Iggy Pop, of all people. You know Iggy Pop? Yeah, OK.\n\n[laughter]\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nHow did you feel when [Ciccone Youth] released this âTwo Cool Rock Chicks Listening to Neu!â? I think it was â88.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nWas it â88?\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nI think so.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nI probably didnât hear about it until a few years later. I didnât know the band, and I think, âHmm, thatâs strange,â but that was the time. I mean, we donât have enough time to go into all these details, but in the â80s, Neu! was completely gone. Nobody was interested in Neu!, Harmonia was gone all the time, and so the echo came from abroad, from people like Stereolab, who sounded a bit like Neu! and also Can and were very successful with that sound, and also people like Sonic Youth. Of course, David Bowie later, or maybe even earlier, he mentioned that he especially liked âHeroâ and âAfter Eight,â and I guess we didnât mention that, that he wanted me to play on his album in Berlin, which mysteriously didnât happen, but we donât have the time now to go into all that anyway. Yeah?\n\nAudience Member\n\n[inaudible]\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nItâs, all right, for you especially. [laughs] I already mentioned that Brian Eno came to visit us, and we worked together, and then I think he produced David Bowieâs albums then. Anyway, I wasnât surprised when [the] next year, in summer, I got a telephone call by someone asking me, âDavid Bowie would like you to join him in the studio to record his album. Would you be interested?â Then I said, âOkay, yeah, that sounds nice. I would like to talk to David, of course, about the details.â David and I chatted for a long time. We were totally excited, talking about details, instruments and so on. Then, the next person to call me was one of his management. I think I surprised them. The English always were very professional, and I was a hippie sort of and not very professional thinking. I was just into music, and I told the guy, âWell, as long as the music is great, donât worry about money. We will solve that later.â I think that was an answer that really frightened that manager. He would have liked me to say, âI need this amount and then I will sign it, and you will have no problems.â In a way, I understand that, but then also there was, in the background, which was revealed much later that his sales were going down. The Berlin period, which for quite a while now is in high esteem, most people think that that was his most creative periodâ¦ But at the time, the fans were not happy with his development, they didnât follow him, so the sales were dropping, dropping, dropping, and I guess the management decided that it was a very bad idea to invite another one of these crazy German experimentalists who might even have evil influence on the music. [laughs] So the next thing that happened was that I read that in David Bowieâs interviews later, 2000 or 2002 in Uncut magazine in England when he said, âOh, I invited Michael Rother, and unfortunately, he turned me down.â I was told David had changed his mind. Someone, a guy in the middle, made the decisions for us and prevented that collaboration from happening. So, that was the David Bowie story in the short, my version.\n\n[laughter / applause]\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nShall we give it up to questions, if there are any?\n\nAudience Member\n\nThat was already the first question.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nThat was already the first question. You broke the ice.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nMay I just add some information, because we somehow steered away from that. Brian Eno went away with the tapes. The tapes were considered lost for quite a while. Ten years later, or 15 years later, we always remember that phase, which was very creative, and I had a small tape with rough mixes I had done before he left with the originals on my cassette. Then, Roedelius visited Brian Eno in London and with his permission looked in Brianâs archives and came up with one or two of the tapes, and so we could release Harmonia & Eno Tracks & Traces. That was the first version, and the current version, which is on GrÃ¶nland Records, features three additional tracks, which I found on my cassette, which had so many sketches that were worth showing, and so I was really happy that we could do these additional tracks to that album as a document to that collaboration.\n\nAudience Member\n\nSo initially, why didnât it come out?\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nI donât know. Things just, everyone took a different direction. I guess David wasâ¦ I donât want to be unfair. Maybe he was happy with having picked up the inspiration from our collaboration, and he was not bent on releasing anything, so it was just put onto a shelf. I was very busy recording my solo albums, which as you already said, really were so wonderfully successful that I could buy my own studio gear in â79, and I didnât think about it for quite a few years. But it was always in the back of my mind, like, also one recording Harmonia did, a live recording, which rested in my archive for maybe 35 years. We agreed thatâ¦ We already mentioned that we were poor, and blank tapes was so unbelievably expensive for Revox tape machines, so we had to erase all the time. Everything that was not totally convincing was erased and used again, but this one live recording from 1974 was left untouched because we all knew that was something special. It was probably the best live concert, the best concert Harmonia ever did. That came out on GrÃ¶nland as well in, I think, 2007 maybe. Harmonia Live 1974, which is a great document, in my view, and it adds some more elements, some colors to the catalog of Harmonia.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nShall we listen to aâ¦ Oh, thereâs another question.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI think that was actually my question. You said a bit about that you were working on a play right now or musical, and I was wondering if you had something completelyâ¦ Didnât you say that? Oh, was that the last? Oh, thatâs right. Okay, well, then you didnât say anything about it.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nWell, Iâm going to Hollywood. [laughs]\n\nAudience Member\n\nOh, sorry, I was just likeâ¦\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nItâs about time. Youâre the right age.\n\nMichael Rother\n\n[laughs]\n\nAudience Member\n\nThen we did not talk about this. Do you have anything completely fresh or new stuff youâre working on that we could hear?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nWe will hear, at the end, I think, after we finish talking, we will hear a remix I did recently for a British band, which I rather like and people seem to appreciate very much, which will be out in the near future. Then thereâs also a documentary about my work, my person. A photographer from Germany has been following me and us to the concerts in the last months, and he has tons of footage, and we want to go through that when I get back to Germany. Thereâs so much work waiting. Time is always limited, although I have so much time, but being alsoâ¦ I started a record label, my own record label in â93, when no company wanted to touch my music. [laughs] In the end, I was so frustrated after endless discussions with record labels, with people from record companies who, in the beginning, there was always someone who was excited, but in the end, the marketing people, there was always a negative decision. And so in â93, that was hard work for a musician without any experience, but I just decided to release my music on my own label. Anyway, then I have to take care of so many things. Itâs carrying my history around me, which has, of course, benefits, but also thereâs a lot of work to do. I mean, Neu! is always in discussion. Harmonia, weâre talking about releasing a box set of Harmonia. Thereâs always something to decide for Neu!, which is requests for usage in films, etc. So, busy times, but Iâm not complaining, really.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI have one more question. We were talking about how fast it was to make music back then because you were just limited with time or like just equipment. How productive are you now? How long did it take you to do this remix that youâre going to play for us?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nI think that happened quite fast, actually. The people who asked me to do the remix were surprised that I havenât done remixes before. Actually, I did one for Paul Weller, but that wasnât released because in the end, we couldnât agree on the version somehow. But he approached me recently again and asked whether I could do some production for him, but I was busy with that other project at the time, so I had to turn him down. With that âBoxed Inâ remix, when they sent me that piece of music, there was a lot in the track, to be quite honest, which I didnât like, but there was something in the feeling and the vocals which appealed to me. And I had this idea I could do something, and so I had all the liberties, and I just left out maybe 80% and just took the drums and the vocals and added my own guitars, and then I was very happy. I just recorded every guitar only once, just to give you an idea. I didnât edit anything. I just did four or five or six guitars just one after the other, and then that was it.\n\nAudience Member\n\nSo like a day?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nWell, I did work longer, to be honest. First, you get all the tracks, and then you have to copy them to your computer, and then you have to analyze them, so that does take longer than a day. But the process, like I said, the real creative process like recording my guitars, new melodies, etcetera, that was just a very spontaneous process, and I was happy about that. Whenever I have the chance, I prefer to do a recording only once. I donât always succeed, but most of you will understand what I mean. It has a special magic, the first recording, with all the errors, etcetera, and the inaccuracies.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nShall we maybe, before we listen to the remix, quickly listen to this clip of you playing at ATP [Festival] because I think itâs quite interesting how you sound like live at the moment. Itâs a bit bad quality, soâ¦\n\n[video: Michael Rother live @ ATP Festival]\n\nWhat youâre doing here is mostly mixing and playing sounds?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nActually, I have to first tell you where that music comes from. That is a track from Harmonia Live 1974, which I, of course, changed and added new instruments. The audio is, of course, terrible. Itâs just a document. Some fan did a video and put it on YouTube. The musicians are the band Kamera. Actually, you only see the drummer. He plays standing up, and on the right, itâs my friend Aaron Mullen on bass, who played on âHallogalloâ in 2010. Next year, if I manage to do the US tour, which Iâm discussing with agents, heâll be part of the team. Yeah, that was ATP 2012. Last year, I played with a different lineup at ATP. Actually, do you know ATP, have you heard of All Tomorrowâs Parties? Yeah. It was a wonderful series of concerts. Barry Hogan and his partner, Deborah Kee Higgins, invited me for the first time in 2005 to play, and Josh Klinghoffer, whoâs now with the [Red Hot] Chili Peppers, joined me. My friend Ben Curtis, who unfortunately passed away last year, who became quite well-known first with Secret Machines and then with School of Seven Bells, wonderful music. Later on, I played for ATP in other countries, in Australia, America, Spain, with Harmonia even and also âHallogalloâ and with my project, Michael Rother Performs the Music of Neu! and Harmonia and selected Blah-Blah- Blahs, very short title. Anyway, unfortunately, they lost too much money, and so they had to stop ATP. It was the final edition I played on. Quite a few tears were spent there by the team. Lovely people. I really liked the whole family and the idea behind that kind of festival; not ripping off the people and the musicians and the festival-goers, living more or less together on a campsite and meeting, very casual. Yeah, I hope they manage to survive with the new activities. It would be a real shame to lose people of that type, not only the money-making people. I mean, obviously, money was always involved, but it was not at the heart of the matter, and thatâs very important. Thatâs what we had in common. I guess I donât mind making money, but it should never be the main reason for what you do. Otherwise, you lose the magic, the idea.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nTalking about meeting, youâll be around until Friday morning. Youâll be in the building here tomorrow if anyone wants to approach you.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nYeah, just talk to me. [sings] Just talk to me.\n\nHanna BÃ¤cher\n\nIf there are no more questions, I will go into that remix that is yet unreleased, so we play it right at the end of our thing just for you.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nYeah.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWhen you did the remixes, when you were asked or commissioned to do the remixes after you did the reissue in 2009, when GrÃ¶nland put out Tracks & Traces, you commissioned like people like Shackleton to do remixes.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nOh yeah.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWas it your decision? Was it the labels decision? Do you like Shackleton, the other people that were involved in those remixes?\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThe remixers were chosen by GrÃ¶nland, and we were asked whether we accepted the remixes for release. That was the way it was handled. To be honest, I donât even know those names. Iâm really the worst-informed guy you can imagine, always too busy with my own stuff.\n\nAudience Member\n\nJust out of curiosity, what contemporary bands or music do you listen to? Because I listen to your music, so I just want to know what you listen to.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nBach. Does that count? [laughs]\n\nAudience Member\n\nI donât know if that fits.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nDjango Reinhardt. No, contemporaryâ¦ I do not spend too much time listening to music, other peopleâs music, to be quite honest. I have to concentrate, and sometimes I stumble upon things that I really like. For instance, the Fu-- Buttons, we played at the same festival in Poland in August, and Iâm friends with those two guys. They are wonderful people, and they blew me away every time when I see them live. I think you have to see the Fu-- Buttons live, and itâs amazing.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you for speaking. It means a lot.\n\nMichael Rother\n\nThank you! For listening. I hope something made sense.\n\n[applause]"
