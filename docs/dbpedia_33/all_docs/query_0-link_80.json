        "text": "Electronic pioneers Kraftwerk this week announced a nine-show residency in Los Angeles that will cover the group’s decade-spanning catalog.\n\nPresented in conjunction with the 50-year anniversary of Kraftwerk’s Autobahn, each show will feature the band playing one of their classic albums, including Autobahn, 1975’s Radio-Activity and 1977’s Trans Europe Express. The final show will span five decades of the Kraftwerk repertoire. See the complete show schedule below.\n\nHosted by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the residency will happen at downtown Los Angeles’ iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall, where the group also performed a celebrated residency in 2013. Happening this May 21-30, the residency will mark Kraftwerk’s first performances in North America since a 2022 run of their 3-D show. Tickets go on sale Thursday at 10 a.m. PT.\n\nKraftwerk was founded in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider — the latter of whom died of cancer in May 2020 — in Düsseldorf, Germany. By the mid-1970s, Kraftwerk had achieved international recognition for their revolutionary electronic soundscapes and musical experimentation using robotics and other technological innovations, including synthetic voices and computerized rhythms. The group had a major international influence across a range of music genres and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2021.\n\nMay 21, 2024: Autobahn\n\nMay 22, 2024: Radio-Activity\n\nMay 23, 2024: Trans Europe Express\n\nMay 24, 2024: The Man-Machine\n\nMay 25, 2024: Computer World\n\nMay 26, 2024: Techno Pop\n\nMay 28, 2024: The Mix\n\nMay 29, 2024: Tour de France"
