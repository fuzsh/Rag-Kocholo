        "text": "It’s impossible to imagine today’s musical landscape without the pioneering electronica of Kraftwerk, who, in the 1970s, created the prototype for all subsequent electronic dance music to come. Founders Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter described their work as “robot pop” and, not without humour, played on the unemotional, staid, totally disciplined Germanic cliché and, as influenced by Gilbert & George, mainly appeared in identical outfits. But, revolutionary to say the least, by purely using synthesisers, drum machines and vocoders they changed the traditional band format forever more, allowed many alone teenager to create music in their bedroom and rewrote the book on music production. It’s safe to say that Kraftwerk were perhaps the most influential group in the history of popular music.\n\n1. ‘The Model’ (1978)\n\nA song that reached No1 in the UK charts when re-released in 1982, it summed up the late 1970s and early 1980s fascination with the world of fashion. The perfect soundtrack for a group of young London style mongers who, soon to be dubbed Blitz Kids, then New Romantics, would go on to create a global trend for clothing, music and attitude, it was truly liberating. “I remember walking into the subterranean world of Billy’s Tuesday nightclub hosted by Steve Strange and Rusty Egan in Soho in late 1978,” recalls Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet, “and I heard the heavy pulsating rhythm of ‘The Model’ that soon became the music of a new youth movement. I immediately bought a synthesiser and wrote our first album. They were the architects of a new metropolis and we were its willing subjects.” Other bands, such as Soft Cell, Depeche Mode and Gary Numan, followed suit while years later Bjork, The Prodigy and Daft Punk all cited Kraftwerk as their major influence.\n\n2. ‘Autobahn’ (1974)\n\n“The simple concept of Kraftwerk was to not use conventional instruments and to sound really German,” explains DJ Rusty Egan of The Blitz and Visage fame. “Ralf and Florian forged ahead when ‘Autobahn’ – which at the time was seen as a novelty record – was an accidental hit.” Amazingly, this thoroughly revolutionary tough, sparse, raw track, created in collaboration with engineer Conny Plank, was released two years before the Sex Pistols' “Anarchy In The UK” and five years after Woodstock, hit number eleven in the UK and number 25 in the US billboard charts. “I loved ‘Autobahn’ and knew that this was where music was going,” states Siouxsie And The Banshees bassist Steve Severin. “It just seemed so right.” Back then, Kraftwerk were viewed as eccentric German boffins dabbling in robotic dystopia and, as such, made their first UK TV appearance not on any pop show but on Tomorrow’s World, a rather stuffy BBC show dedicated to altogether bemusing future technology. “Kraftwerk’s music was so ahead of its time, so timeless and so technically and technologically perfect, like German craftsmanship with cars,” adds Egan. “Their first six albums when released as a box set will, in the future, be seen as art not music.”\n\n3. ‘Trans-Europe Express’ (1976)\n\nReleased in 1977, “Trans-Europe Express” was the perfect antidote to the chaos of punk and struck a huge chord with many a UK innovator. “I had my epiphany while listening to ‘TEE’ for the first time off my head in Cabaret Voltaire’s outdoor party in Sheffield on a big PA,” says Martyn Ware, founding member of The Human League, Heaven 17. “I realised then that I wanted to make this kind of music and thought that I could do that. It had soul and futurism – my perfect combination.” Certainly, the song not only celebrates the TEE technology that could take us from Berlin to London but also rejoices in the unification of Europe that had only four years previously allowed the UK into its fold. For many of us, this was our glorious continental future. Accordingly, the song reached No1 in the French pop charts, 15th in Sweden, was an underground hit in the UK and was subsequently purloined by Afrika Bambaataa (vis producer Arthur Baker) for his hip-hop anthem “Planet Rock” and more recently for Jay Dee's “Big Booty Express”. “Rendezvous on the Champs-Élysées/Leave Paris in the morning with the TEE/In Vienna we sit in a night café/Direct connection TEE/We're running into Düsseldorf City/And meet Iggy Pop and David Bowie.” The latter icon, hugely influenced by Kraftwerk, wrote the track “V-2 Schneider” in tribute to Florian in 1977 for his Heroes long player while The Stooges were Hütter's favourite band.\n\n4. ‘Neon Lights’ (1978)\n\n“'Neon Lights', for me, is the theme tune of the Blitz Club, all the many people who went there and all the kids who leave home for the city,” recalled Blitz promoter and lead singer of Visage Steve Strange just before his untimely death in 2015. “For me it’s about all these kids who come to London from a small village, like I did, and are transfixed and fascinated by the neon lights of a big city like London or New York or Berlin and take a chance and move here and live life for the moment.” Undeniably, the record, with its elegiac synth refrain, insistent keyboard, simplest of drum machine beats and shaky, somewhat insecure vocals, is reminiscent of the ephemerality of youth: “You're all I see in all these places/You're all I see in all these faces/So let's pretend we're running out of time, of time/Like neon lights.” U2, OMD and Simple Minds all covered the song.\n\n5. ‘Europe Endless’ (1977)\n\nAnother cut from Kraftwerk’s sixth album, Trans-Europe Express, this rather fine and somewhat magnificent track, recorded in 1976 in Dusseldorf, sees the band settling into their signature style of harmonious electronic melodies, sequenced cadences and persistent rhythms that would push them to the top of the electro pack. The album, in answer to accusations of Nazism (due to autobahns themselves being inextricably linked to Hitler, who commissioned them), again celebrates the EC. The combo, most keen to move away from their German heritage towards a new sense of European identity, felt that the album could be a sonic elegy to the glories of this new united Europe, which, for Kraftwerk – all of whom had been born straight after the Second World War and felt alienated – was of the highest importance. “Europe endless/Real life and postcard views/Europe Endless…”\n\n6. ‘The Robots’ (1978)\n\nThe tune that kicked off that rather infuriating robotic/mime dance style, “The Robots” is nevertheless a milestone track by anybody’s measure. The undoubted blueprint for all the 1980s electro hip-hop to come from the likes of Man Parrish, Grandmaster Flash and Mantronix, the formula was also adopted by Detroit’s The Belleville Three, Juan Atkins, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson, who fused Kraftwerk’s repetitive exhortations with funk and disco and created techno, the act Phuture as well as house music producer Frankie Knuckles. Today, even the likes of Calvin Harris, Pharrell, Snoop Dogg and Swedish House Mafia are indebted to these German boffins. “Without Kraftwerk’s influence within the early pioneering creators of techno and house music, electronic music may not have evolved into the positive, life-changing global phenomenon that we continue to celebrate and love in the present day,” opines celebrated superstar DJ Danny Rampling of the club Shoom.\n\n7. ‘Radioactivity’ (1976)\n\nA minor hit in France in 1975, this single is so way ahead of its time it’s really rather shocking. Owning all the facets of future Euro disco and high energy, its thumping analogue bass and almost music box melody paved the way for the likes of Yellow Magic Orchestra, Giorgio Moroder, Patrick Cowley, Franz Ferdinand and New Order, who sampled Kraftwerk’s “Uranium” for “Blue Monday”. “We ripped off Kraftwerk as soon as we were able to,” admitted Peter Hook in an interview with the NME. “They were streets ahead of anybody else, even from an electronic point of view. They were making their own sequencers years before anyone else.” “No one can possibly overestimate the influence they have had on contemporary music,” attests Paul Oakenfold, one of the world's most successful DJs who, as an A&R man, signed Salt-N-Pepa and DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince and was the agent for The Beastie Boys and Run-DMC. “That analogue sound, that simplicity and that rhythm was the big influence on all electro to come. I don’t know where music would be without Kraftwerk.”\n\n8. ‘Tour De France’ (1983)\n\nA phenomenal recording that not only echoed their obsession with cycling but reasserted the bands standing as the creators of electro, “Tour De France”, with its swirling strings and fat bottom end, influenced hundreds of film theme scores, including composers Harold Faltermeyer (Beverly Hills Cop) and Howard Shore (Videodrome). “I think all of us who went on to create film scores from the 1980s on were influenced by Kraftwerk as their music was so filmic,” clarified Hans Zimmer, the composer responsible for The Lion King, Gladiator and 1917. “Their music was always so evocative, futuristic and experimental.”\n\n9. ‘Musique Non Stop’ (1986)\n\nOne of the great hip-hop/break-dancing aficionado’s underground anthems, this is the tune any great electro DJ drops to show all that he knows his onions. Undoubtedly, its very title refers to the continuous mixing so integral to a hip-hop selector’s art that, made infinitely easier by Kraftwerk’s propagation of the drum machine, was the band's nod in the direction of its new fans. “Kraftwerk really sparked that whole electro thing off everywhere and were massive in the New York black community,” informs BBC 6 Music DJ Don Letts, formerly of Big Audio Dynamite and one of the first to bring electro/hip-hop from New York to London. \"And it might seem odd that these guys influenced decades of black music… but they did.”\n\n10. ‘Showroom Dummies’ ( 1976)\n\nAnother track from the landmark Trans-Europe Express LP – that, in 2014, the LA Times called “the most important pop album of the last 40 years” – “Showroom Dummies” was composed after the band had been compared to showroom dummies in a British concert review, which, by all accounts, pleased them very, very much. “They claimed not to be musicians but technicians and went to the studio like a job and worked into the night, taking a break to eat or dance in the club where I met them,” illuminates Rusty Egan. Apparently, Schneider (whose father was a famous architect who created Germany’s first multistorey car park and Cologne Bonn airport) rarely admitted being in a musical combo of any description and, on one occasion, conducted an interview while wearing an imitation moustache and asserted that he could not recall who Kraftwerk were. Perversely, some versions of the song comprise a spoken count in of “Eins, zwei, drei, vier,” which is a direct parody of The Ramones, who were one of Kraftwerk’s most favourite acts.\n\nNow read\n\nHow Kraftwerk helped redefine German identity after Second World War\n\nHow New Order’s discography birthed my obsession with post-punk music\n\nTen Blondie songs that changed new wave"
