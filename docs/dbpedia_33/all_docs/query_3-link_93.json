        "text": "German electronic music pioneers and Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Kraftwerk will celebrate the 50th anniversary of their groundbreaking 1974 album, Autobahn, with a nine-date residency at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.\n\nThe concert series will present eight Kraftwerk albums: Autobahn (1974), Radio-Activity (1975), Trans Europe Express (1977), The Man-Machine (1978), Computer World (1981), Techno Pop (1986), The Mix (1991), and Tour de France (2003). Each night will feature one complete album plus additional compositions from their catalog.\n\nConcert number nine will be a finale with groundbreaking works spanning five decades of the Kraftwerk repertoire. The music was composed, produced, and recorded by Kraftwerk founders Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider, the latter dying in 2020.\n\nKraftwerk put on a similar string of concerts in 2014 at Walt Disney Concert Hall, and included full-album performances set to 3D multimedia visuals. In 2022, the group embarked on a North American tour following its induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame the previous year.\n\nKraftwerk tickets are on sale starting at 10 AM on Thursday, Jan. 11."
