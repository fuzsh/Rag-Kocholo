        "text": "With Kraftwerk, there's always been an interesting contrast between their live show and the rest of their career. Their concert performances are hugely entertaining revues, crowd-pleasing events that value immediacy over mystery. Everything you need to know-- the brilliant songs, beautiful sounds, well-designed projections, and, lately, 3-D imagery-- is up there onstage. But the personality of the band away from the stage has always been hard to peg. Part of it is that Ralf Hütter prefers to let the work speak for itself. He doesn't do many interviews, and when he does sit for one, he never seems to give too much away. And part of it is up to the working methods of Kraftwerk-- toiling away far from the public eye for years to realize each new project. People wonder: \"What are they up to?\" They are working. Someday we'll find out what, exactly, they are working on.\n\nThis is a big year for the legendary group, marked by the full-scale remastering/reissue of their catalog from Autobahn forward, both as The Catalogue box set and individual albums. It was a typically long road for The Catalogue-- the set first seemed on the verge of coming out five years ago, and was beset by a series of confusing delays. But now that it is finally available, Hütter has been ready to talk about his band and their legacy. We spoke to him by telephone while he was visiting London. He seemed relaxed and certainly came across as friendly and approachable, happy to speak about his band's past work even while he remained fixated on the future.\n\nPitchfork: Thanks so much for speaking with us. I know you're busy.\n\nRalf Hütter: Yeah, we just came back from a festival [on the] Isle of Wight. \"Bestival\" is what it's called. We played Saturday night. Fantastic. It's in the countryside and the audience-- Bestival always has a special theme. This year was \"Space Oddity\", so everybody was dressed up in space uniforms or self-made combinations of space aliens and things like that. Very good. When we appeared with our neon suits, they went wild. It was sunny and the moon came out, and there was no wind, and the sound was just excellent. A wonderful situation.\n\nPitchfork: Are there any particular challenges for you in having an outdoor show, with all the multimedia that you have?\n\nRH: Yes. I mean, technically, it's not always easy, but we managed in Denmark [at Randers], and we also played a small outdoor venue where we did our 3-D projection show. We give 3-D glasses for the audience. But we couldn't do that here in the festival; it was too many people, and they just wouldn't allow that.\n\nPitchfork: How did the 3-D aspect of the show come about?\n\n____RH: Our music is always, as you know, very spacey-- computer graphics, music, images, lyrics, and visual art we make ourselves, or that we make with artists. And it's all synchronized. The premiere was at the Volkswagen factory when we played there in April. It went so well that we decided to do it again in the summer when we played for the Manchester Velodrome, where we had the British Olympic cycling team riding on the track and then later during the show, after our robot performance, we continued about five or six compositions with 3-D graphics and the audience put on the glasses. It was fantastic.\n\nPitchfork: Was the cycling team performance something that had been in the works for a while?\n\nRH: Yes. When were invited to join the Manchester Cultural [International] Festival, and then they said that the concert would happen at the Velodrome, so it was quite natural to combine the two elements. Then we brought the idea and the festival director organized the connection with the British Olympic cycling team because they trained on the Velodrome track. It's the fastest track in the world and their trainer is a German guy. And then luckily enough, the next morning we came back to do a training session. It's different, because the curves are pretty high so we took about some time to turn the circle around and then maybe pick up some speed and go up the curve. Quite a different technique.\n\nPitchfork: Do all four current members of Kraftwerk cycle?\n\nRH: Yes, but one guy, he works too long so he was still sleeping in the morning when we had to get up at seven.\n\nPitchfork: The Catalogue box is something that's been in the works for some time. What were some of the issues that caused it to be delayed, and how are they resolved?\n\nRH: I was involved in going through the visual archives from the printing studio, the old photographs and the original prints of the original designs for drawings and ideas for the original cover. And that wasn't really fully worked out when The Catalogue was announced in 2004. We put out a little promo box, and then we toured quite a lot around the world over the last five years. But in between, we went into the archives [and] saw some of the artwork that was never publicized or published in this quality. And there was always something missing or we were not able to do the whole photo as it was planned. So now for the first time, you will see the original artwork in the way it was visually composed by us at the time. All original graphics and more photographs and drawings. And of course, they have been mastered and upgraded for 2009 mastering techniques. So it's all up-to-date and we're very happy with the outcome of everything, so now for the first time you'll see Kraftwerk in the album packaging as it was, complete.\n\nPitchfork: With the original issues of the albums, why were you not able to realize your vision of it at the time?\n\nRH: Well, it was foldout covers or not so many photographs or print allowed or the colors were messed up. So many mistakes. Like in America, they changed the folds from left to right. Things like that. There was just always so much bad quality and the CD was scanned down from vinyl so there was never really high quality involved. We were not really in control of that at the time, but now for the first time, we have been able to put everything together and then add those drawings or photographs or images or paintings that were not possible for us to put them in the album at the time, in the 70s.\n\nPitchfork: Is it pleasurable for you to return to your previous work, both in listening to the recordings again and going--\n\nRH: Yes, because they are part of our life repertoire. As you know, we play *\"*Autobahn\" and \"Radioactivity\", so it's a continued process: The Man-Machine, Computer World. It's all part of our musical past and present, and therefore the images are part of our live concerts, and now we put them into the box set and the artwork of the individual albums. It's a great pleasure to put it finally together and to make it available.\n\nPitchfork: Does it evoke specific memories for you when you're listening to old recordings and remembering the times that you were assembling them?\n\nRH: No. It's part of my memory, so it's all present in our live performance. And we have also transferred all the very old Kling Klang archived analog tapes onto digital format for live computers. It's not discovering anything from before; we're mainly putting this together in an accurate production process.\n\n____Pitchfork: Of course, the main issue of the box, The Catalogue, is on compact disc, but there are also LP vinyl versions. Do you have any thoughts about the format of releasing music in this era?\n\nRH: No. For me, the music is immaterial: It is sounds and visions. We have gone through many different formats, from vinyl to audiocassettes to 8-tracks to CDs and now downloads. And of course, live Kraftwerk. The Man-Machine is a live electronic music machine. For me, the music is spiritual and I think comes to life when we perform it in concert.\n\nPitchfork: One thing that really struck me about your live show was the quality of the sound at the concert: It was very, very high quality.\n\nRH: Yes. And as you know, we use the original sound from the different periods, from the early mid-70s from our Kling Klang archives. And then we modulate, and we work with the original sources. From there, our compositions are like scripts: film scripts or action scripts. And we can work with this. \"Autobahn\", we can do five minutes, or change the speed, or play it 10 minutes, whatever. And most of our compositions, they are like endless scripts, so they can be changed and improvised and numbered. So there's always so much for us to do.\n\nPitchfork: I know that in the early days, in the 1970s, there was, because of the limitations of technology of the time, it was difficult for you to realize live performance in the way you would have liked. Did you have a vision back then that it would be a multimedia show?\n\nRH: Yes, we started this way with our friend Emil [Schult], who was a painter, and then Florian [Schneider], who had a very good drawing hand, and then myself, I am very interested in photo and drawing. So we combined these elements of the vision and we used slides in those days, and the projections, but of course, nothing like the technology that has been available for us today. So we have been very lucky that the technology developed in our direction.\n\nPitchfork: Did you have a sense then that things would go that way eventually?\n\nRH: More a hope. We recorded Computer World and we didn't have home computers at that time. It was the 80s when the album came out and they were not available to us. I think we always involved in our music and conducting, integrating this technology into Kraftwerk, into the Kling Klang studio, and then the Kling Klang studio live. The combination of man and machine. So for us, it was a continued process.\n\nPitchfork: Was there, when you were a young person and you were first seeing live music and performing live music, perhaps in the late 60s, was there anyone you saw that was an inspiration for this kind of multimedia show?\n\nRH: No, nothing special. I think it was more like an awakening in the late 60s of the whole living situation-- the German word is einfach musik. Everyday music, like-- it's more like discovering the tape recorder for us. Like, the world of sound: Everyday life has a sound, and that's also why our studio is called Kling Klang studio because \"kling\" is the verb and \"klang\" is the noun for \"sound.\" So it means \"sounding sound.\" That's really what Kraftwerk is about. Sound sources are all around us, and we work with anything, from pocket calculators to computers, from voices, human voices, from machines, from body sounds to fantasy to synthetic sounds to speech from human voice to speech synthesis from anything, if possible. We don't want to limit ourselves to any specific sound like that was before when we were brought up in classical music. Then it had be strings, it had to be piano, blah blah blah. We wanted to go beyond, to find a new silence and from there to progress to continue walking into the world of sound.\n\nPitchfork: Kraftwerk exists as not just an art object, like in a museum, but there's always an element of popular culture, where it's received by large groups of people. This is opposed to some people, who experiment with sound and they might do a sound installation in a museum. But it seems like there's always been a popular element to what Kraftwerk does.\n\nRH: Yes. That developed for us, when we started in the late 60s in art galleries and student clubs, there might have been 50 people or whatever, and it just developed this way. Then in the early 70s and with Autobahn, suddenly the world was-- it was possible for us to tour around the world. Well, in France, Italy, and America. And then from there on, it was for us like a vision of electronic music as a universal language. It became our reality.\n\nPitchfork: Something I've always found interesting about Kraftwerk is that even when your music is electronic music and it's, as you say, immaterial. It sort of exists independent of physical formats. There's always been a strong feeling for the body in your music, that there's always a physical manifestation of it, whether it's through dancing or inspiration in something like cycling. Is that, the interface between electronics and the human body, is that of particular interest to Kraftwerk?\n\nRH: Yes, I think that's best expressed in the words the \"Man-Machine\". It's this combination of human sounds and machine sounds, so as you probably know, electronic music has been very, very intellectualized in the 50s, 60s, or whatever, and I think we always felt strong elements ourselves of these machine rhythms, repetition and charm. Like the motor humming on Autobahn, radio waves playing in fantastic melodies in the air. All these ideas have been in our minds and we try to combine them into the different albums.\n\nPitchfork: Do you find that your thoughts on the \"Man-Machine\" change as you age at all, and all of our bodies are getting older? Does that have any influence on your thoughts on the \"Man-Machine\" concept?\n\nRH: No, not really. We do cycling and exercise, so we are in very good shape. And we just continue; we'll have to see.\n\nPitchfork: What about the interface between electronic instruments and the body? Are there any limitations between making music-- today, you use a laptop computer and you use a keyboard, as opposed to years ago maybe you would have used an organ or something that had a different physical interface. Are there limitations with the current state of technology?\n\nRH: Well, I think that technology has developed a lot in more directions, where now it's more mobile and we have all our music on laptop computers. We can travel, and we can work, and there's not so much time lost on set-up and putting the cables into place, all this old analog equipment that needed a lot of attention or set-up time. So now, for us, we have much better tools to work with and when we travel, we can work in the hotel, we can go still...how do I say this...a lot to come? We are looking into the future.\n\n____Pitchfork: Do you still personally play traditional instruments, like piano?\n\nRH: No. I have my keyboard and I have-- because that's my working instrument, keyboards. But I'll use switches and faders and mouse, so I'll use anything. But my main instrument is keyboards, so I play any sounds I can trigger from there.\n\nPitchfork: Do you remember when you first encountered a synthesizer?\n\nRH: I think we heard synthesizer sounds in the mid-60s, around that time. And through our cultural situation, radio from Cologne and electronic music-- well, probably mid- to late-60s, as students. We didn't know exactly which instruments were used, and then I think synthesizers came around at that time. I bought mine, I have to think...maybe 71, 72, around that time. [Synthesizers were] used for film music, and then we discovered that might be interesting for me. But I also worked the human voice and speech and language and poetry. It's kind of a concept of making my fingers sing.\n\nPitchfork: To speak of the first album in The Catalogue set, the song \"Autobahn\". People have mentioned the Beach Boys as something that sounds like it could've possibly been an inspiration for the chorus of that.\n\nRH: No. Not really. It's more-- it has been misunderstood, but it's more like a cultural photograph. Like, say, you have the Beach Boys from California, but from Germany you would have Kraftwerk, a song about the Autobahn. It's the language of German electro music, and within our language, developed from our mother language...[begins singing \"Autobahn\"], so this strong quality and the motors are being tuned, and the tires are-- whatever, I don't know the English word for the noise they make. And we try to incorporate all kinds of elements.\n\nPitchfork: Is there anything you can tell us about any new music?\n\nRH: No. What we are...within the near future doing more sessions in the studio, and continue working and see that we create a new result. The Kling Klang studio is our instrument. It's not that I play the piano, and he plays the flute and another guy plays the drums...with the Kling Klang, we play the studio. That's coming from the late 60s, right around 1970, when we set up the studio and Kraftwerk. That is our instrument. So we'll use any sound source we feel is relevant for this composition. And now the music is mobile, because during the concerts we play basically studio. I compose anywhere. I compose on my bike, like the Tour de France, I compose in the Trans-Europe Express, or at home, in the car. It's not really, like I have to sit at the table and get some paper. I don't compose on paper. I compose in my mind and in my memory, and also we compose by accident in the studio. So anything is possible.\n\nPitchfork: So Tour de France was actually written while you were cycling, or some ideas came from when you were on your bike?\n\nRH: Of course! And once the idea is there, you just bring in all the experience and all the ideas you have from years of cycling. I also wrote German lyrics at one point; we recorded those also, but in the end they just didn't really fit because of the spirit of the song is the Tour de France, and I speak French, so we just kept the French lyrics that I wrote. The lyrics have the goal of camaraderie, amitié-- that means comrade and friendship. So we had no really special...I think the main idea is what I call the 168-hour week, where ideas are allowed all the time.\n\nPitchfork: What about the place of humor in Kraftwerk's music?\n\nRH: It's really good humor, I think it's also very serious. It's simultaneous. So I don't know; I can't express in words, but it's in the music, and it's in the words, and I think people understand. It's also what I call \"black humor\", because we wear black shoes.\n\nPitchfork: Could you ever see the earliest Kraftwerk material being reissued?\n\nRH: Yes. We just haven't had the time, but unfortunately [the CDs] are in very bad quality and just bootlegs. So when we find the time in the near future, I plan to continue working on the old Kling Klang archives and restore the old tapes and the old artwork and find more artwork on these albums and make them available. That's another phase of our work. Like pre-Autobahn, before the idea of the \"Man-Machine\" came into existence, so to speak.\n\nPitchfork: That's possibly another piece of misinformation that's out there, that there's this idea that Kraftwerk likes to pretend that those albums don't exist.\n\nRH: No! What can I say…we go through phases, like in art. The various first early phase, then the Autobahn, now the Kraftwerk phase...\n\nPitchfork: Do you have a desire to write a book about Kraftwerk?\n\nRH: No. Everything stays in the music. I write lyrics a lot and I think in short, very short term, we use language, and basically, that says it all.\n\nPitchfork: Florian Schneider is no longer performing with Kraftwerk. How closely is it tied to you as a person, your personality? Is it something that could continue even without you, or are you the essential element of Kraftwerk now?\n\nRH: I have no idea, but we'll have to see. I'm just continuing as always."
