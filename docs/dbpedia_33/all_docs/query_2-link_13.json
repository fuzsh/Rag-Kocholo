        "text": "Kraftwerk is one of the most (if not the most) influential electronic bands. Formed at a time when Germany needed a musical identity. Kraftwerk took what many Germans wanted to leave in the past and created a sound and image that Germany along with the rest of the world would come to embrace. Kraftwerk’s innovative and revolutionary approach to music is still felt to this day. “Machine” music was not only embraced by Kraftwerk, it was nurtured and molded into a genre of music that would find its home in almost every genre to follow. Lets take a look into the phenomenon known as Krautrock!\n\nKraftwerk, formed in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider would later change popular music forever with their use of electronics to create music. Kraftwerk’s early work before 1974 was mainly experimental, jam music using traditional instrumentation, which would later be manipulated during post-production. Kraftwerk and Kraftwerk 2 are perfect examples of this sound. Their 1973 release Ralf und Florian relied more heavily on synthesizers and drum machines. This album also showcased their use of the vocoder, which would later become a staple of their sound.\n\nThe 1974 release of Autobahn moved Kraftwerk into the limelight. Autobahn was their most disciplined work to date. Their use of the Minimoog can be heard on this album. Song structure also became more defined and this allowed for the masses, a chance to absorb this new electronic phenomenon known as Kraftwerk. The success of this album along with sponsorship from Phonogram gave Kraftwerk the opportunity to tour North America in 1975. U.S. audiences would come to embrace this new German dance music. Concert goers, would originally come out to see Kraftwerk because they thought of the band as some sort of novelty that would eventually fade out, not realizing the long lasting impact they would have on popular music.\n\nOn the completion of their 1975 tour Kraftwerk went back to work in their newly updated Kling Klang Studio. By now they had upgraded Kling Klang into a fully functional recording studio. Following in the path of Autobahn, Kraftwerk felt that their new project should have a centralized them. Their mutual interest in radio resulted in the release of the 1976 album Radio-Activity. 1977 saw the release of Trans-Europe Express. The album was mixed in Los Angeles at Robert Plant studios. Later that year Kraftwerk would be offered an opportunity to tour with David Bowie, who they had met at Kling Klang Studio a few months prior. They would turn down the Bowie tour, but would later win a Disco Award for Trans-Europe Express later that year. Kraftwerk followed Trans-Europe Express with The Man-Machine in 1978. The black and red artwork of the album was inspired by Russian artist El Lissistzky, who himself was a part of the Suprematism movement.\n\nKraftwerk’s 8th studio album would come 3 years later entitled Computer World. During the three year writing and recording process, Kraftwerk reconstructed their Kling Klang Studio, so that they could take it on tour with them. Computer World, as with albums preceding it, dealt with a centralized theme. That theme was the rise of computers in society. “Computer Love” was released in July of 1981 in the UK and reached #36 on the charts. The track was re-released in Feb of 1982 and claimed the top spot on the charts. “Computer Love” was also nominated for a Grammy for best Rock Instrumental Performance. Several publications have listed Computer World as one of the top albums of the 80s.\n\nKraftwerk’s sound and vision revolutionized popular music. When long hair and flamboyant rock stars where garnering all the attention in the west, Kraftwerk went against the grain with their suits and short hair. They created an identity for German music, at the same time pioneered a new form of musical expression. Thanks to Kraftwerk, electronic music went from an Avant Garde experimental expression to becoming an unstoppable force in pop music along with birthing into a new genre within itself. We still hear their influence in today’s popular music, just look at how they popularized the use of the vocoder. Electronic music is here to stay, thanks to Kraftwerk!"
