        "text": "Kraftwerk, the German band whose music predicted pop’s electronic future back in the 1970s, hasn’t forgotten an old-fashioned precept: A concert is a physical, spatial event. Even as all sorts of experiences — arts, communication, commerce — migrate to two-dimensional computer screens, “An Evening With Kraftwerk: 3-D Concert” played up the sensations of a particular performance in a particular room. Kraftwerk’s current tour found an ideal setting on Tuesday night as the band started a two-night stand at the ornate United Palace Theater in Washington Heights.\n\nThe band members themselves, in grid-patterned suits, stood impassively behind identical-looking consoles. Behind them was a large video screen; concertgoers had been equipped with 3-D glasses. As the band played its songs — or generated them, since it was impossible to tell how much was live — larger-than-life three-dimensional projections towered over the stage and moved into the audience.\n\nKraftwerk, founded in 1970, invented itself through a fascination with technology. It has billed itself as “the man-machine,” and its songs are equally enthralled and wary of the emotionless precision and pervasive reach of computers, media, high-speed transportation and other inventions with unintended consequences. “Business, Numbers, Money, People,” flashed in midair in “Computer World,” a song released in 1981 that was tersely prescient about big data and surveillance.\n\nThere were giant robotic simulacra of band members for “The Robots,” and a welter of numbers flickering and rippling and flying forward in “Numbers.” There was a multilayered barrage of neon signs in “Neon Lights” and a shadowy train plunging through darkness in “Trans-Europe Express” — literalistic, but compelling. During “Spacelab,” set in a spaceship cockpit so retro its equipment included reel-to-reel tapes, a drone seemed to be hovering above the theater’s front rows; then it revealed itself as a long-needled probe and plunged suddenly into the audience, which gasped. There were surround-sound speakers, too, with voices and bits of synthetic melody popping up from multiple directions."
