This year, the singer/keyboardist spent much of his time working on a live album documenting Kraftwerk’s recent 3-D performances at New York’s Museum of Modern Art and Tate London — among others — for release on Blu-ray later this year.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nPreview: The man behind Kraftwerk's machines Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nEach of those performances focused on one of Kraftwerk’s eight albums — from 1974’s Autobahn to 2003’s Tour de France Soundtracks, inspired by Hütter’s love of cycling. The live album “will be our complete catalogue in 3-D format, Blu-ray and Surround sound,” says the 69-year-old visionary. “It’s a lot of work and detail and editing and altering and well, what can I say?”\n\nFounded in 1970 by Hütter and Florian Schneider (who left in 2008), Kraftwerk is one of the most influential bands of the 20th century, if not all of music history — helping to create electronic music and inspire thousands of musicians from electro-popsters Depeche Mode to hip-hop mogul Jay-Z.\n\nThe German foursome will be making their first visit to Edmonton on Wednesday, Sept. 16, delivering a 3-D performance of songs and visuals from a range of their albums.\n\nThe Journal recently talked to Hütter about technology, Kraftwerk’s almost 50-year legacy, and his left-leaning tendencies.\n\nQ: What do you like about 3-D?\n\nA: We come from the late ‘60s, from the art scene in Düsseldorf, and we have always been a combination of visual arts, music, sound, poetry. We’ve always been drawing and, in the early days, using projections with photographs. We’re not a Hollywood film company, but when we got these 3-D programs, we transformed all our old artwork, ideas and concepts into 3-D format. Our music has always been a living performance. Therefore, 3-D is perfect for our music.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQ: Parts of your live show are improvised, which some might think impossible with electronic music and 3-D visuals. How are you able to do this;\n\nA: Our compositions are like minimal film scripts. We can always alter them in the afternoon or during the soundcheck, we can change or we can improvise. We set up all our sounds from original sound sources so it all has to do with frequencies, filters and parameters. The only thing that is pre-written is the arrangement.\n\nIt’s possible to improvise (the visuals), too. We can change timelines and do some live editing.\n\nQ: Is there a reason why you’re always standing on the left side of the stage?\n\nA: No, it just happened that way. It’s historical, by chance. In the old days, I used to sit with my organ next to a drummer. He would then be very loud and hammer next to the organ, so I moved to the left. We kept it that way. It’s like a chamber quartet; everybody knows where they are.\n\nQ: You (and Kraftwerk) received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Grammys in 2014. Do such honours mean anything to you?\n\nA: Yes … I was very honoured to receive this lifetime award because it’s not just one successful record or one song, it’s for my work or my life. I think, for me, that was wonderful to be in the company of artists in this list. What can I say?\n\nQ: Are there one or two Kraftwerk songs that you are particularly proud of?\n\nA: I always say it’s an illegal question for a mother to answer which child is her favourite. I like all of them. There are some we’ve rarely performed before or we haven’t played since the ‘70s. We did these MoMA shows of all our albums and we re-discovered, because we don’t listen to our records, very old songs and very old concepts that even surprised me, like Hall of Mirrors and Ohm Sweet Ohm.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nQ: When you’re wandering about Düsseldorf, are you widely recognized?\n\nA: No, no, no, no, no. My friends do recognize me. I think, in Germany, we don’t have any star system.\n\nQ: You’ve performed in some incredible buildings, such as the Tate Modern in London, and more recently, the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin. What was the last experience like for you?\n\nA: Because I used to study architecture in the late ’60s, this was … what can I say? It’s a famous building by Mies van der Rohe — steel, glass, the Bauhaus perfection. We played our catalogue over eight evenings and it was a fantastic event for me, personally, apart from playing music. Mies van der Rohe didn’t know us, but maybe he pre-invented this building for Kraftwerk.\n\nQ: You might cry, Ralf, when you get to Edmonton, because many of our buildings are bland, and our roads are terrible for bikes. So, if you want to cycle before the show, you should stick to the paths in our river valley.\n\nA: OK, but I’m also a fan of winter sports like alpine skiing and cross-country skiing. As you know, we live next door to the Netherlands, so in the winter, we do speed skating, and in the summer, we do cycling on our racing bikes when we have time, outside the studio, to charge our batteries and now we’re full of energy to come and do the tour.\n\nssperounes@edmontonjournal.com\n\ntwitter.com/Sperounes\n\nPREVIEW\n\nKraftwerk — 3-D Concert\n\nWhen: Wednesday, Sept. 16 at 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Jubilee Auditorium\n\nTickets: $75.40 and $95.90 (including service charges) at Ticketmaster.ca\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
