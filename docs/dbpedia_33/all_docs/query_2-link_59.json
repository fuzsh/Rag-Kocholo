        "text": "Is it sentimental to feel so sad about the passing of someone about whom you almost know nothing? In the case of Kraftwerk’s Florian Schneider, it might be. But it’s also understandable. He was their most immediately recognisable face, and he seemed to know it. With his high forehead and inquiring blue eyes, you can see the rangy Schneider using his physical oddness at the end of the famous Tomorrow’s World clip which introduced Kraftwerk to a wider British audience. That’s him gazing into the camera lens, rather like an inquisitive alien inspecting the hardware of his new surroundings.\n\n“We were einzelgänger,” said Ralf Hütter, with whom Schneider steered Kraftwerk between their earliest collaborations in 1970 and Schneider’s departure from the group in 2008. “Loners, mavericks. Mr Kling and Mr Klang.” Early footage of the group suggests that, of the two, it was Schneider who first understood the importance of presenting an aesthetic that extended beyond the music. By way of illustration, look at them at 1970’s Rockpalast performance of Die Zeichen, the standout track from their debut album, Hütter in a slightly pungent-looking leather jacket playing organ vamps that suggest a passing familiarity with The Doors, while Schneider’s flute playing veers close to some of the melodic snatches that eventually made their way onto Autobahn. By their 1973 turn on German show Aspekte, they were still a Werk in progress. But Schneider now has the look: smart suit, short hair, no sideburns. By contrast, Hütter is almost unchanged from the earlier clip.\n\nA year later, with Autobahn, the intersection of music and aesthetic was complete. The approach they would describe as “Minimim-Maximum” — creating the maximum effect by the most minimal of means — was represented by the classic blue sleeve of ‘Autobahn’. A sleek white graphic of a motorway on a blue background, aping the road signs you might see as you veer towards an actual autobahn. They had done something similar with the traffic cone sleeve art of ‘Kraftwerk’ and ‘Kraftwerk 2’. According to early producer and collaborator Conny Plank, these ideas were visual clues to the influence of The Velvet Underground’s debut album on Hütter and Schneider: “[It wasn’t] about the beauty of sound, they just went for the basic feeling of a true situation.” ‘Autobahn’ was the breakthrough — the record which where method and subject matter merged to mark out a conceptual territory which Kraftwerk could inhabit exclusively for as long as they wished. It was the record where they figured out how to make a form of pop that didn’t share its roots with those of American rock and pop. Just as The Eagles’ ‘Hotel California’ album traded on its depiction of a mythic, instantly recognisable America, ‘Autobahn’ was the record which did the same for Germany — and did so in a wholly unproblematic way.\n\nIt was from hereon in that Kraftwerk nourished their brand and cultivated their myth with an attention to detail that was way ahead of its time. On the artwork of 1975’s ‘Radio-Activity’ — an album inspired by the life-changing innovations that remain invisible to the human eye — they were nowhere to be seen either. From the outset, it’s by some stretch their most haunting record. The accelerating clicks, crackles and echoes of Geiger Counter, give way to a title track which at its dramatic climax, sounds like a requiem mass of ghosts reverberating around a vast machine. And on every subsequent track, the record’s somniferous synergy of otherworldly oscillations, sonorous test signals and distant snatches of human chatter doesn’t come close to releasing you from its spell.\n\nNot that I — or anyone else — was to know it, but the first time I got to see Kraftwerk, in a surprisingly under-attended Manchester Apollo on 1991’s ‘The Mix’ tour, they’d pretty much completed their body of recorded work. I hadn’t expected to see them making themselves quite so approachable when they encored with Pocket Calculator, playing little hand-held devices that they even allowed members of the audience to touch. And even though none of them smiled, it was Schneider to whom your gaze naturally went. He never seemed to blink. It felt like he was watching us as with as much fascination as we were watching him. And, if a story dating back ten years previously is anything to go by, perhaps that exactly what he was doing. During the Australian leg of the group’s 1981 tour, Schneider went missing, seemingly nowhere to be seen. Finally, as the band were due to go on stage, he was sighted by Kraftwerk right-hand man Emil Schult through a hole in the stage curtain. There was Schneider sitting in the back row, apparently waiting for the show to begin. When asked what he was doing, he explained to Schult that he felt he wasn’t needed and would like to “see the show from the audience for once.” His enigma was further heightened by the fact that David Bowie named V-2 Schneider after him in the same year that Kraftwerk namechecked him (along with Iggy Pop) in Trans-Europe Express (Hütter: “He was travelling by Mercedes, listening to nothing but Autobahn all the time”).\n\nTo say that Kraftwerk were ahead of their time is a statement almost asinine in its utter self-evident obviousness. They were the first group to predict that, in years to come, we’d be finding romance through the passive interface of a computer screen. They were one of the first groups to be sampled and also one of the first groups to understand that sampling is as much a creative act as making music from scratch. But in saying that they were ahead of their time and leaving it there, we risk missing an almost spiritual dimension to their outlook. Beyond the robotic facade, their brand of futurism allowed them to invest the present with a beauty that eluded most of their peers. They wrote about motorways and computer science and robots and neon-lit cities at night and high-speed train travel across a borderless Europe as if they had beamed themselves into the 21st Century and realised that one day, hindsight would afford us the clarity to appreciate the splendour of all these ideas. They were excited, engaged and inspired by the changing world around them. In doing so, they helped us to do the same. And perhaps these are some of the reasons we feel sad about the passing of a musician about whom we almost know nothing.\n\nIn memory of Florian Schneider (1947–2020)"
