German bicycle manufacturer Canyon and Ralf Hütter of German electronic music pioneer Kraftwerk have partnered to produce a very limited edition of the Ultimate CF SLX bike in time to celebrate the Tour de France’s Grand Depart in Dusseldorf.

Dusseldorf is home of Kraftwerk, best known for its 1970’s albums Autobahn and Trans-Europe Express and obsession with blurring the line between man and machine. In 1983 the group released the piece “Tour de France”, which incorporated mechanical sounds of bicycles and human sounds of exertion. The music reflected members Hütter and Fritz Hilpert’s love of the sport, one that put Hütter in a brief coma after a crash during the recording of the song. In 2003, Kraftwerk expanded on the music, developing it into Prologue, Etapes 1-3 and Chrono movements for an eighteen-minute suite. On July 1, the group will perform the entire Tour de France Soundtrack album in its hometown.

On Saturday, German powerhouse Tony Martin of Katusha, one of two WorldTour teams to ride Canyons, will contest the opening time trial on the the Kraftwerk bike. Two days later 21 of the bike will go on sale for $14,867. The machines feature an appropriately electronic SRAM wireless eTap groupset, along with Zipp 303 Firecrest wheels and a paint job based on Hütter’s Tron-like design.

Canyon Founder and CEO Roman Arnold is pretty excited about the partnership. “My memories of partying in friends’ basements as a teenager are dominated by hearing Kraftwerk’s groundbreaking sounds,” he said. “Kraftwerk and cycling have a special and unique connection – their music, and all that they do, has inspired our work at Canyon in so many ways across the years. It is an unbelievable honour for us to pay respect to everything that Kraftwerk stands for and has achieved in such a fitting way with these stunning bikes.”
