        "text": "Established as a non-profit organization in 2009, The Milosz Institute is dedicated to the life and work of Czeslaw Milosz, one of the 20th century's most powerful writers. Poet, novelist, and essayist, Milosz became renowned in Europe and in the United States for a landmark work of political psychology, The Captive Mind (1952). But his achievement as a poet, for which he was awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize, places him amongst the giants of 20th century literature. Spiritually luminous and intellectually incisive, Milosz's work bears witness to the tragedies of 20th century history and to mankind's struggle for self-definition.\n\nThe Milosz Institute sponsors research through fellowships, publications, symposiums that adds to our understanding of the complex themes of his work (literature, religion, science, history and politics) and his times, including the many authors--from Mann and Eliot to Jeffers and Ginsburg to Gombrowicz and Szymborskaâ€”with whom his work is interwoven.\n\nRobert Faggen, the Director of Milosz Institute, has edited Milosz's letters to Thomas Merton, interviewed the author for several publications including The Paris Review, and published numerous essays about his life and work. He organized the 1998 International Milosz Festival, in which Milosz participated, and the 2011 Milosz Centennial Symposium, both at Claremont McKenna College.\n\nPlease direct all inquiries to rfaggen@cmc.edu\n\nCMC and Milosz: A Timeline\n\nClaremont McKenna College has had a long relationship with Czeslaw Milosz and the Polish culture.
