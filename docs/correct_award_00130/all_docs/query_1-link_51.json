        "text": "Czeslaw Milosz (June 30, 1911 - August 14, 2004) was a Polish poet and novelist who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1980.\n\nA well-known critic of the Polish Communist government, Milosz was awarded the prize while protests by Poland's first independent trade union, Solidarity, erupted against Communist rule. His Nobel status became a symbol of hope for anti-Communist dissidents. He was a writer with a distinctly twentieth century voice. Having barely escaped Nazi terror and Communist dictatorship, he probed humanity's fragility in a violent world.\n\nYet Milosz proclaimed in his Nobel acceptance speech that the books that linger should “deal with the most incomprehensible quality of God-created things.” Without underestimating the power of the suffering and evil he encountered, Milosz affirmed that it would not triumph. Russian poet and fellow Nobel Laureate Joseph Brodsky called him \"one of the greatest poets of our time, perhaps the greatest.\" Brodsky spoke of Milosz's mind having \"such intensity that the only parallel one is able to think of is that of the biblical characters, most likely Job.\"\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\n\nBorn to a Polish-speaking family in Lithuania, Milosz as a young man studied literature and law in its capital city, Vilna, (today, Vilnius), a meeting point between East and West. In that ancient city, Lithuaians, Poles, Byelorussians, and Tartars, Christians, Jews, and Muslims intermingled peacefully.\n\nYet Milosz, as a Central European who had felt at close range the impact of the first World War and the rise of Communism in nearby Russia, sensed impending catastrophe.\n\nHis first volume of published poetry, A Poem on Frozen Time (1933), dealt with the imminence of yet another war and the worldwide cataclysm that it portended.\n\nWhen the Nazis invaded Poland, Milosz moved to Warsaw and joined the resistance. There, he edited an underground anthology of Polish wartime poems, Invincible Song (1942). The tragic fate of the Poles and Jews surrounding him were deeply burned into his consciousness. He personally witnessed the end of the walled Jewish ghetto.\n\nHis response to the horror was The World (1943). Reaching beyond suffering, he helped his readers find promise within ordinary things. He intimated that the world's innermost nature is not evil and that evil would not prevail.\n\nPost-war career\n\nAfter the war, Milosz, then a socialist, joined the Polish diplomatic corps. He served in New York and Washington DC before being sent to Paris. There, he asked for political asylum in 1951, because Stalinism had increased its hold on Poland.\n\nThe Captive Mind, one of his best-known works, was published during his stay in France. The book critiques the Polish Communist Party’s assault on the independence of the intelligentsia. Governments can use more than censorship to control people; they can alter the meaning of words, he reminds readers.\n\nMilosz was one of a number of Central European writers and intellectuals who had clung tenaciously to the moral value of memory. In his History of Polish Literature, he spoke at length about the role of memory in moral and cultural survival.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Milosz left Paris to become professor of Slavic languages and literature at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1970, he became a United States citizen. He is not often thought of as a commentator on American politics and culture, but in Visions from San Francisco Bay, he muses about America in the 1960s.\n\nThoughts on morality\n\nMilosz was influenced by his Catholic roots and by William Blake, Emanuel Swedenborg, and Oscar Milosz, his cousin, who was a poet and mystic.\n\nNot satisfied by the scientific worldview, which limits serious inquiry to the physical world alone, Milosz focused on the moral realm. Yet he could not accept the opinion of those who wished to praise his capacity for moral insight or assign to him a position of moral authority.\n\nBecause he had known extreme life-and-death situations, he had the humility of those who have learned from experience how difficult it can be to be truly moral. He had seen how deeply selfish human beings could become when they were fighting for survival. He was not unaware of how strongly the body rejects suffering and death, even for a just cause. He knew that evil is morally dangerous even when faced by persons of good character.\n\nThe world in which he came of age was one in which many people suffered a social existence that had the demonic at its core. When he writes, in Bells in Winter, that poets should \"hope that good spirits, not evil ones\" choose them for their instruments, he cautions that there are times when discerning the good can be almost indescribably difficult.\n\nMilosz writes in Visions of San Francisco Bay, that much of culture is devoted to covering up man's fundamental duality. He tries instead to reveal the nature of the contradictions between good and evil that exist within each person.\n\nMilosz frequently experienced his own life as one of exile, not only because of the years in which he was separated from his native land, but in the larger sense that the human condition is one in which all humanity endures metaphysical or even religious exile.\n\nOut of this spiritual awareness, he wrote Unattainable Earth. Here he speaks of how the longings awakened by his unselfconscious, intimate childhood bond with nature, a bond that almost spontaneously identified with the entire world, could not be fulfilled in the human situation in which people find themselves.\n\nMilosz, however, maintained a courageous prophetic stance. He not only proclaimed the coming of World War II, even foretelling the crematoriums, he also prophesied that democratic movements in Central Europe, such as that forged by the Polish labor union Solidarity, would outlast tyranny. Although he grasped with great clarity the strength and nature of evil, he continued to understand and assert the power of goodness.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nAfter the Soviet Union disintegrated, Milosz was once again able to live in Poland. He eventually settled in Krakow, where his ninetieth birthday was widely celebrated.\n\nIn 2002, Milosz died there at the age of 93. His first wife, Janian Dluska, the mother of his two sons, Anthony Oscar and John Peter, had died in 1986. His second wife, Carol Thigpen, an American-born historian, had passed away in 2001.\n\nIn Poland, Milosz's funeral in the ancient cathedral church of St. Mary was a state event. Thousands lined the streets to pay their respects. He was buried in the Church of St. Michael and St. Stanislaw on the Rock in Krakow, beside other famous Polish cultural figures.\n\nThroughout his life, Milosz had remained active in the Polish literary world. During his years in America, he had translated into English the writing of Polish authors largely unknown in the West, such as Alexander Wat, a man whose time in Communist concentration camps produced a profoundly honest theological and literary voice. Milosz had also learned Hebrew so that he could translate the Old Testament into Polish.\n\nMilosz received many honors. He is listed at Israel’s Yad Vashem memorial to the holocaust as one of the “Righteous Among the Nations.” His words grace a monument to fallen shipyard workers in Gdansk. He received the Prix Literaire Europeen (1953), the Marian Kister Award (1967), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1977), the Neustadt International Prize (1978), and National Medal of Arts of the U.S. Endowment for the Arts (1989). He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1981) and the American Institute of Arts and Letters (1982). Numerous honorary doctorates in Europe and America were given to him including one from Harvard (1989) where he delivered the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures (1982).\n\nWorks\n\nWorks in Polish\n\nPoemat o czasie zastygłym.
