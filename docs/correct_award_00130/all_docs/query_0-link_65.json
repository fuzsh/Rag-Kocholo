        "text": "Today I present a book published in 1953 in France by the Polish writer Czesław Miłosz. It was written in the early 1950s, at the height of Stalinism. He wrote the book shortly after he was granted political asylum in Paris due to the authorities in Poland. The book talks about the author's experiences while living in underground circles in Poland during World War II, his position and the status of other Polish intellectuals in the post-war years, as well as thoughts of tempting collaboration with the Stalinist regime among intellectuals in Eastern Europe. In the book, the author deals with a difficult-to-understand phenomenon - beliefs in utopia. The author describes socialism, communism and as a witness to the Nazi crimes in Poland, the Holocaust, the gulag and the Soviet dictatorship in Eastern Europe, the author writes about the tragic events of that time."
