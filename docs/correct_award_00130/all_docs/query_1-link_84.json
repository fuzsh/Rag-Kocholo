        "text": "January 27, 2022\n\nIn 1987 was the year Milosz turned 77. His wife of 50 years passed away only two years before, and so did some of his friends. Old age is approaching or maybe already there, so it is a time that induces reflection.\n\nAs an explanation for the title, Milosz says that he was given a calendar called “A year of a hunter” once, when he was a boy. It was a collection of advice and reflections over activities or chores that should be considered for changing seasons. This journal, is Milosz’s personal year of a “hunter”. Contrary to its inspiration, the records may not have much to do with changing seasons. They have rather to do with changing moods and the free flow of memory.\n\nThe entries are sometimes inspired by current events, like lectures and readings of his poetry and sometimes simply by memories. Sometimes, they are going on through a couple of days, next day's entry inspired by the last. Known and unknown names, musings about the world changing, people, politics, morality, history, and faith, moving between now and his childhood, youth, war, the efter war experience, emigration and the frustrations and difficulties that came with it.\n\nFrom a young boy in Vilnius to a grown man and an emigré in America in the 60es, from a poet “without a language” in his new country, to a Noble laureate and a respected professor at the university of Barclay.\n\nI liked it and I enjoyed reading it but the records of events and reflections of one year are very personal, obviously not reusable, unless there is another Milosz in the world somewhere that is going to live his life all over again.\n\nNovember 10, 2018\n\nSome folks write journals for posterity, others give resonance to their own meandering deviation and hope for a loyal Brod: Byron to Renard.\n\nI found this example to be an admixture, a conscious construction towards a legacy but one still wrought with doubts and misdeed.\n\nThere’s considerable judgement on display. Mourning for his wife. A quivering acknowledgement of his own destructive nature. There are trips back to Europe and lengthy asides.\n\nThere is no quick encapsulation of 20C Polish history. Milosz considers an attempt, if only through his own exceptional experience. I appreciate the reverence for Balzac, the prism of Magic Mountain to gauge the world between the wars; I did steady myself for his harsh words towards de Beauvoir and Brodsky.\n\nI return again to the wonky confessional nature of the tome: regardless of its bent, it penetrates with verve of a poet at work. Early writing from his garden in Northern California, he notes that his childhood was virtually covered with insects, that his dotage thanks to chemical progress is free of such. Perhaps that is but another painful analogy for our age."
