        "text": "Czeslaw Milosz, who has died aged 93, was perhaps the luckiest Polish writer of the last century, and not just because his achievement was crowned with the Nobel prize, world fame and grovelling recognition by the Polish communist government which since his defection in 1951 had sought to turn him into a non-person.\n\nHe was fortunate to have been born in 1911, in time to grow up and benefit from university education (at Wilno) in newly independent Poland, an early recognition of his talents and coveted employment with Polish Radio. He survived the collapse of Poland in 1939, and he survived in Warsaw under German occupation, supported by a wide circle of influential literary friendships, finding time to develop as a poet, translating Shakespeare and Eliot.\n\nAfter the war his youthful leftwing sympathies led him to collaborate with the communist authorities, which rewarded him with prestigious diplomatic posts in Paris and Washington, so that he could enjoy the freedoms of the west at a time when Stalinism was progressively corrupting and destroying writers and intellectuals in Poland.\n\nWhen in 1951 he broke with the regime and published The Captive Mind, it became an international bestseller. Using the thinly disguised biographies of his literary friends as case studies, Milosz documented communist brainwashing techniques. Not surprisingly, he provoked vilification from the Polish authorities and Polish intellectuals, as well as from the Stalin-infatuated French left.\n\nMore surprisingly, the mass of emigr√© Poles, with the exception of the Kultura circle in France and young writers in London, refused to forgive him his \"errors\". It was thanks to Kultura's powerful publishing base that Milosz was able to be heard as prolific poet, translator, novelist, essayist and polemicist. Although closely identified with France through his family tie with the poet Oscar Milosz, and his admiration for Simone Weil (whose selected works he had translated), Milosz craved for the primitive energy of American culture. An offer of a professorship of Polish literature at Berkeley in 1961 proved irresistible.\n\nThroughout those years Milosz remained bitter and unrelenting, convinced that his life was riddled with misfortunes brought about by the malice of his countrymen. He could never understand that by choosing a life of high exposure and ideological manoeuvring, he was bound to provoke hostile reactions, as well as fierce loyalties.\n\nDoubtless the Nobel prize in 1980 and Milosz's conversion from Marxism to catholicism and the visionary obfuscations of Swedenborg and Blake have helped many Poles to come to terms with this humourless, jaundiced Lithuanian. Lithuania, united with Poland in 1386, is viewed by Poles with affection as an enigmatic, romantic borderland which produced Mickiewicz and Pilsudski; it therefore obviously suited Milosz to stress his ties with that region to the point of denying any links with Poland. But he never wrote anything in Lithuanian, preferring instead to move closer and closer to English (via a growing team of translators), for as he confessed with brutal frankness:\n\nI wanted glory, fame, and power.\n\nBut not just in our city of modest renown.\n\nSo I fled to countries whose capitals\n\nHad boulevards lustrous beneath incandescent lamps ...\n\nWhat will best survive of the prolific corpus of this petulant Lithuanian Pole? As a poet, Milosz developed late. His prewar output consists mainly of apocalyptic rantings. The experience in Warsaw under the occupation purified his language and imagery; he avoided the temptation to compose lachrymose verses, recording horrors such as the destruction of the ghetto in measured neo-classical lines, and his unexpected masterpiece - so out of keeping with the spirit of the times - is the sequence of Naive Poems in which he records the child's magical view of the world.\n\nNeither then nor subsequently did Milosz attempt to push his poetry beyond 18th-century decorum. He cherished a profound distaste for what he termed the 20th-century avant-garde, and his poetry therefore lacks flexibility and adaptability. On the other hand, his refusal ever to abandon his lonely tower enabled him in later years to create magisterial poetic meditations out of a rich and varied mixture of philosophical, quasi philosophical and religious material, and from sharply focused descriptions of historical events and the natural world.\n\nApart from his two novels, Milosz's prose works are made up of skilfully blended elements of philosophical reflections, literary criticism, biographical sketches of his friends and enemies and snatches of autobiography. He has, in effect, created a genre which most characteristically manifests his talents. The Land of Ulro and The Native Realm are the best examples. It is here that Milosz's magpie yet well-disciplined mind functions at its best: what unites the disparate elements is not some dominating intellectual thread or philosophical thesis, but Milosz's protean and omnivorous intellectual and sensual appetites.\n\nThis is why his History of Polish Literature is not an orderly textbook, but a selective, highly readable anthology of his enthusiasms and prejudices, and his Harvard lectures, The Witness of Poetry, are short on structured argument and literary analysis but rich in disparate insights and autobiographical revelations.\n\nMilosz's effortless command of the Polish language enabled him to produce a body of excellent translations from a wide range of English and American poets. With Peter Dale Scott's help and under Al Alvarez's watchful editorial scrutiny, he introduced his translations of Zbigniew Herbert to English-language readers, and his anthology Post-War Polish Poetry, first published in 1965, was a pioneering work. Milosz's Collected Poems (1931-1987) first appeared in England in 1988.\n\nHis two wives predeceased him. He is survived by his two sons.\n\nLet the last word be the poet's:\n\nWe drove before dawn through frozen fields,\n\nThe red wing was rising, yet still the night.\n\nAnd suddenly a hare shot across our path.\n\nOne of us pointed to it with his hand.\n\nThat was long ago and both are dead:\n\nThe hare and the man who stretched his arm.\n\nO my love, where are they, where do they lead,\n\nThe flash of a hand, the line of movement, the swishing icy ground -\n\nI ask not in sorrow, but in contemplation."
