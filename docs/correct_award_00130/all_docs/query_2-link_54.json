        "text": "As a gift last Christmas, my son Craig and daughter-in-law Kate gave me an anthology of works by the great Polish poet and Nobel laureate, Czeslaw Milosz. In a column that I wrote in early January, I promised that I would review the book as soon as I had an opportunity to read it. To my delight, I discovered an outstanding collection of poems that captured a range of sentiments that would include the spirit of the spring season that we all now enjoy.\n\nWidely acknowledged as one of the world’s most talented poets, Milosz received the 1980 Nobel Prize in Literature. A refugee from communism, Milosz settled in the United States during the 1950s and remained in America until after the restoration of democracy in Poland. Shortly after his death in 2004 at the age of 93, The New York Times described Milosz as a “spiritual voice in a ruined world.”\n\nOften his poems would examine difficult and troublesome topics, such as the Nazi invasion of Poland and the tragedy of communist oppression. Indeed, any anthology of his work must necessarily include many serious poems. But Milosz also examined the meaning of happier subjects.\n\nPerhaps my favorite poem by Milosz is a verse entitled “Christopher Robin,” in which Milosz considers the lessons imparted by a cartoon character named Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\nEven the most serious of poets have need for joyful distraction. Thus, in a poem entitled “In Warsaw,” Milosz asks:\n\n“Was I born to become\n\na ritual mourner?\n\nI want to sing of festivities,\n\nThe greenwood into which Shakespeare\n\nOften took me. Leave\n\nTo poets a moment of happiness,\n\nOtherwise your world will perish.”\n\nSimilarly, in “Child of Europe,” Milosz gives this advice: “Let the sweetness of day fill your lungs.” Acknowledging a tendency to write about the great tragedies of modern history, Milosz observes in his poem entitled “Preparation” that “The sun will rise over the righteous and the wicked. / Springs and autumns will unerringly return.”\n\nThe season of spring represents a spirit of joyful rebirth. Milosz captures this theme masterfully in his poem entitled “Slow River”:\n\n“There has not been for a long time a spring\n\nas beautiful as this one; the grass, just before mowing,\n\nis thick and wet with dew. At night bird cries\n\ncome up from the edge of the marsh, a crimson shoal\n\nlies in the east till the morning hours.\n\nIn such a season, every voice becomes for us\n\na shout of triumph. . . .”\n\nWhat would spring be like without flowers and the fresh budding of trees? Milosz effectively uses this imagery in many of his poems. For example, in “Songs of Adrian Zielinski,” Milosz describes the effect upon his spirit “When I go to the fields, to the stunted forest, / To any stretch of wasted land / And observe how the first spring flowers / Are pushed up by a subterranean hand . . . .”\n\nIn a poem entitled “The Journey,” the author describes roses, the “pink fingers of magnolia,” and “wet armfuls of purple flowers.” Then in “Seasons,” Milosz speaks about a “transparent tree, full of migrating birds on a blue morning.” But perhaps my favorite reference is to the peony, a plant that was always a mainstay of my own mother’s wonderful garden. Blossoming in late spring, this flower became the focus of Milosz’s poem entitled “By the Peonies.” The first stanza accurately describes its subject:\n\n“The peonies bloom, white and pink.\n\nAnd inside each, as in a fragrant bowl,\n\nA swarm of tiny beetles have their conversation,\n\nFor the flower is given to them as their home.”\n\nSpring indeed is a beautiful season that brings hope to all even in the midst of a troubling world. Thus, we can accept the observation that Milosz offers in his poem entitled “The Journey,” that life is like a journey in which we ride, “shouting for joy of spring.”\n\nA book has the potential to become an ideal gift, but only when it anticipates the interest of its recipient. For this reason, I appreciate the care that my son and daughter-in-law took in their selection of their gift for me last Christmas.\n\nFor those with an interest in fine poetry, I heartily recommend the anthology entitled “New and Collected Poems (1931-2001),” by Czeslaw Milosz. And in this joyful season of spring, I urge readers of Milosz to recognize an underlying spirit of hope even amidst the challenges of the human experiences that the poet has so effectively examined."
