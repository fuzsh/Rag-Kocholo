        "text": "Czesław Miłosz\n\nPoetry\n\nEnglish\n\nPolish\n\nSo Little\n\nI said so little.\n\nDays were short.\n\nShort days.\n\nShort nights.\n\nShort years.\n\nI said so little.\n\nI couldn’t keep up.\n\nMy heart grew weary\n\nFrom joy,\n\nDespair,\n\nArdor,\n\nHope.\n\nThe jaws of Leviathan\n\nWere closing upon me.\n\nNaked, I lay on the shores\n\nOf desert islands.\n\nThe white whale of the world\n\nHauled me down to its pit.\n\nAnd now I don’t know\n\nWhat in all that was real.\n\nBerkeley, 1969\n\nBy Czeslaw Milosz from “The Collected Poems 1931-1987”, 1988\n\nTranslated by Czeslaw Milosz and Lillian Vallee\n\nCopyright © Czeslaw Milosz and Lillian Vallee\n\nEsse\n\nI looked at that face, dumbfounded. The lights of métro stations flew by; I didn’t notice them. What can be done, if our sight lacks absolute power to devour objects ecstatically, in an instant, leaving nothing more than the void of an ideal form, a sign like a hieroglyph simplified from the drawing of an animal or bird? A slightly snub nose, a high brow with sleekly brushed-back hair, the line of the chin – but why isn’t the power of sight absolute? – and in a whiteness tinged with pink two sculpted holes, containing a dark, lustrous lava. To absorb that face but to have it simultaneously against the background of all spring boughs, walls, waves, in its weeping, its laughter, moving it back fifteen years, or ahead thirty. To have. It is not even a desire. Like a butterfly, a fish, the stem of a plant, only more mysterious. And so it befell me that after so many attempts at naming the world, I am able only to repeat, harping on one string, the highest, the unique avowal beyond which no power can attain: I am, she is. Shout, blow the trumpets, make thousands-strong marches, leap, rend your clothing, repeating only: is!\n\nShe got out at Raspail. I was left behind with the immensity of existing things. A sponge, suffering because it cannot saturate itself; a river, suffering because reflections of clouds and trees are not clouds and trees.\n\nBrie-Comte-Robert, 1954\n\nBy Czeslaw Milosz from “The Collected Poems 1931-1987”, 1988\n\nTranslated by Czeslaw Milosz and Robert Pinsky\n\nCopyright © Czeslaw Milosz and Robert Pinsky\n\nEncounter\n\nWe were riding through frozen fields in a wagon at dawn.\n\nA red wing rose in the darkness.\n\nAnd suddenly a hare ran across the road.\n\nOne of us pointed to it with his hand.\n\nThat was long ago. Today neither of them is alive,\n\nNot the hare, nor the man who made the gesture.\n\nO my love, where are they, where are they going\n\nThe flash of a hand, streak of movement, rustle of pebbles.\n\nI ask not out of sorrow, but in wonder.\n\nWilno, 1936\n\nBy Czeslaw Milosz from “The Collected Poems 1931-1987”, 1988\n\nTranslated by Czeslaw Milosz and Lillian Vallee\n\nCopyright © Czeslaw Milosz and Lillian Vallee\n\nA Poor Christian Looks at the Ghetto\n\nBees build around red liver,\n\nAnts build around black bone.\n\nIt has begun: the tearing, the trampling on silks,\n\nIt has begun: the breaking of glass, wood, copper, nickel, silver, foam\n\nOf gypsum, iron sheets, violin strings, trumpets, leaves, balls, crystals.\n\nPoof! Phosphorescent fire from yellow walls\n\nEngulfs animal and human hair.\n\nBees build around the honeycomb of lungs,\n\nAnts build around white bone.\n\nTorn is paper, rubber, linen, leather, flax,\n\nFiber, fabrics, cellulose, snakeskin, wire.\n\nThe roof and the wall collapse in flame and heat seizes the foundations.\n\nNow there is only the earth, sandy, trodden down,\n\nWith one leafless tree.\n\nSlowly, boring a tunnel, a guardian mole makes his way,\n\nWith a small red lamp fastened to his forehead.\n\nHe touches buried bodies, counts them, pushes on,\n\nHe distinguishes human ashes by their luminous vapor,\n\nThe ashes of each man by a different part of the spectrum.\n\nBees build around a red trace.\n\nAnts build around the place left by my body.\n\nI am afraid, so afraid of the guardian mole.\n\nHe has swollen eyelids, like a Patriarch\n\nWho has sat much in the light of candles\n\nReading the great book of the species.\n\nWhat will I tell him, I, a Jew of the New Testament,\n\nWaiting two thousand years for the second coming of Jesus?\n\nMy broken body will deliver me to his sight\n\nAnd he will count me among the helpers of death:\n\nThe uncircumcised.\n\nWarsaw, 1943\n\nBy Czeslaw Milosz from “Selected Poems”, 1973\n\nTranslated by Czeslaw Milosz\n\nCopyright © Czeslaw Milosz\n\nPoems selected by the Nobel Library of the Swedish Academy, and Michal Bron."
