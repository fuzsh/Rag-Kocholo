        "text": "A Song on the End of the World\n\nBy Czeslaw Milosz\n\nOn the day the world ends\n\nA bee circles a clover,\n\nA fisherman mends a glimmering net.\n\nHappy porpoises jump in the sea,\n\nBy the rainspout young sparrows are playing\n\nAnd the snake is gold-skinned as it should always be.\n\nOn the day the world ends\n\nWomen walk through the fields under their umbrellas,\n\nA drunkard grows sleepy at the edge of a lawn,\n\nVegetable peddlers shout in the street\n\nAnd a yellow-sailed boat comes nearer the island,\n\nThe voice of a violin lasts in the air\n\nAnd leads into a starry night.\n\nAnd those who expected lightning and thunder\n\nAre disappointed.\n\nAnd those who expected signs and archangels’ trumps\n\nDo not believe it is happening now.\n\nAs long as the sun and the moon are above,\n\nAs long as the bumblebee visits a rose,\n\nAs long as rosy infants are born\n\nNo one believes it is happening now.\n\nOnly a white-haired old man, who would be a prophet\n\nYet is not a prophet, for he’s much too busy,\n\nRepeats while he binds his tomatoes:\n\nThere will be no other end of the world,\n\nThere will be no other end of the world.\n\nWarsaw, 1944\n\nThe World\n\nBy Czeslaw Milosz\n\nIt appears that it was all a misunderstanding.\n\nWhat was only a trial run was taken seriously.\n\nThe rivers will return to their beginnings.\n\nThe wind will cease in its turning about.\n\nTrees instead of budding will tend to their roots.\n\nOld men will chase a ball, a glance in the mirror–\n\nThey are children again.\n\nThe dead will wake up, not comprehending.\n\nTill everything that happened has unhappened.\n\nWhat a relief! Breathe freely, you who have suffered much.\n\nCzeslaw Milosz (1911-2004) was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1980. He spent his childhood in Czarist Russia, watched the rise of the Soviet Union, witnessed two World Wars, working as a resistance fighter in Poland when Hitler invaded, and eventually came to the United States. He became an American citizen in 1970, living his final years in California and writing well into his 90’s. He died in his native Poland, home of my own ancestry.\n\nYet through it all Milosz maintained his faith as a devout Catholic, and his belief in humanity. “The act of writing a poem is an act of faith,” he claimed. In these troubled times his poetry has much to teach us. I wonder what he would think of the world today, with the new rise in the totalitarianism he escaped in Europe and the threat to Democracy in his adopted homeland.\n\n“At a time when voices of doubt, deadness, and despair are the loudest; when writers are outstripping each other in negation of man, his culture, and nature; when the predominant action is destruction . . . . [Milosz] leads the reader to a place where one can see—to paraphrase the poet’s own formula regarding time—Being raised above being through Being.” –Krzysztof Dybciak in World Literature Today.\n\nJust what I needed to hear this Easter morning in these troubling times.\n\nPainting by Joaquin Sorolla Y Bastida"
