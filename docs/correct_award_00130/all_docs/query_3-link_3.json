        "text": "Life\n\nCzesław Miłosz was born in Lithuania, where his Polish parents fled to escape the turmoil in their native country. After the end of World War I, the family returned to Poland. When World War II broke out in 1939, Miłosz became involved in the resistance movement in Warsaw. After the war Miłosz joined the newly formed Communist Party and was stationed as a cultural attaché in Paris. Disappointed with the Communist regime, he sought political asylum in France in 1951. He took up residence in the United States in 1960 and lived there until the 1990s. Miłosz spent his last years in Krakow, Poland.\n\nWork\n\nCzesław Miłosz primarily worked as a poet. His first poetry collection, Poemat o czasie zastyglym (Poem of the Frozen Time) was published in 1934. Several of his early works are characterized by a sense of doom, but as time passed, he softened the picture he drew of the world. His best-known work, the novel Zniewolony umysł (1953) (The Captive Mind), examines a repressive regime’s influence on four authors. Miłosz resisted being labeled a political author and maintained that his work dealt with eternal questions: life and death, faith and doubt, good and evil."
