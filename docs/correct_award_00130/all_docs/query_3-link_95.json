        "text": "This poem, written in 1986, celebrates the power of books to endure — even with ‘fires on the horizon’ and ‘castles blown up.’ It hearkens back to the dark days of book burning through the ages but is also poignantly timely.\n\nAnd Yet the Books — Czesław Miłosz, translated from the Polish by Czesław Miłosz & Robert Hass\n\nAnd yet the books will be there on the shelves, separate beings,\n\nThat appeared once, still wet\n\nAs shining chestnuts under a tree in autumn,\n\nAnd, touched, coddled, began to live\n\nIn spite of fires on the horizon, castles blown up,\n\nTribes on the march, planets in motion.\n\n‘We are,’ they said, even as their pages\n\nWere being torn out, or a buzzing flame\n\nLicked away their letters. So much more durable\n\nThan we are, whose frail warmth\n\nCools down with memory, disperses, perishes.\n\nI imagine the earth when I am no more:\n\nNothing happens, no loss, it’s still a strange pageant,\n\nWomen’s dresses, dewy lilacs, a song in the valley.\n\nYet the books will be there on the shelves, well born,\n\nDerived from people, but also from radiance, heights.\n\nAbout Czesław Miłosz\n\nCzesław Miłosz (born 30 June 1911) was a Polish poet, novelist, translator, and diplomat. Born in what’s now Lithuania, Miłosz was active in the Resistance during WWII, editing anti-Nazi pamphlets and helping Jewish families in Nazi-occupied Poland. After the war, he worked as a diplomat stationed in Paris but defected to the West in 1951. In his anti-Stalinist book The Captive Mind, written after his defection, he said, ‘My mother tongue, work in my mother tongue, is for me the most important thing in life.’\n\nMiłosz wrote his poems and prose in Polish, and his works were then translated by others (and himself) into English. His poetry and books addressed questions of politics, history, morality, and faith. As a translator, he made Western works — like Shakespeare’s As You Like It and T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land — accessible to a Polish audience. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980. Poetry Foundation has a complete biography and more poems.\n\nThis video from 1998 is quite charming. First, the poet reads one of his poems (so serious), then discusses his favorite English-language poets with warmth and humor."
