        "text": "March 21, 2022\n\nIt looks as if the Creator, whose ethical motives people have learned to doubt, was prompted primarily by his desire to make everything as interesting as possible, and as comic.\n\nMy first experience reading Miłosz, this late collection of short pieces was apparently a good introduction to many of the central themes that consumed him during a long writing life, e.g. Catholicism, faith, philosophy, science, history, and the role and fate of the poet in society.\n\nWhen I was, as they say, in harmony with God and the world, I felt I was false, as if pretending to be somebody else. I recovered my identity when I found myself again in the skin of a sinner and nonbeliever. This repeated itself in my life several times. For, undoubtedly, I liked the image of myself as a decent man, but, immediately after I put that mask on, my conscience whispered that I was deceiving others and myself.\n\nSome pieces in the titular first section could be considered prose poems, more by virtue of brevity and an aphoristic tone than by otherwise recognizably poetic language. The rest are more like short philosophical essays, including all of the second, final section, titled \"Subjects to Let\", which ostensibly share topics the writer knows he will not live to expand on, so offers to others.\n\nIf only we could believe that everything ends with death.\n\nI had to look hard for the gems that I found, but some will stick with me, I think.\n\nMarch 19, 2011\n\nI love Milosz and this book, filled with his short, stirring, and thought-provoking poetry and prose was tremendously interesting. Each page holds so many interesting, sometimes quirky thoughts. Especially for a writer, this book proves a valuable companion.\n\nApril 25, 2008\n\nI have read this a number of times. He talks about the modern world, seemed to see through it more than just about anybody. I'm really sorry he's gone.\n\nAugust 10, 2012\n\nSome of these aphoristic pages are a slog, but there are some wonderful bits throughout.\n\nRead\n\nMay 29, 2019\n\nAn arrangement of short essays, poems and aphorisms about language, death and Catholicism. I enjoyed it but can't say it stuck with me to any particular degree. Then again, I read a lot of books this month.\n\nFebruary 16, 2009\n\nwell, this is a little, nearly square book by czeslaw milosz and it's full of poems, mostly. there are a few other things. musings. ponderings. milosz is one of those quietly funny folks and his funniness isn't always in stories or poems that feel good. i think that's very nice of him.\n\nthere is a story on fleas. a funny bit involving martin luther. i will never be able to get over the fact that he wrote these in one language (polish) and then sat down and changed them over to english. just changed them. i imagine him with robert haas (a poet in his own right but also a fine translator), drinking beer and laughing over the words and how to pin them down on the page, slapping each other on the back when they get a line or two just right, not hurrying at all. and in new form the words are still beautiful to read and say and hear. how is that? rilke does that, too. it's not fair. go read them and see for yourself.\n\nJune 26, 2022\n\nA quick little book, nothing overly special. Only 12 poems, two being a line long. Still a couple gems. Highlights: ~ \"Pelicans\" \"A Ball\" \"Christopher Robin\" and \"Rivers\".\n\nMay 9, 2023\n\nEvery time I read a book by Czeslaw Milosz I can't help but think that he has to be among the finest writers of all time. This is a short book of poetry and short essays and, really, there is very little difference between the two, they are both, simply, extraordinary. I put tabs on my favorites as I was reading but there are far too many to highlight in this review, so I'm going to quote just a few of the shorter ones.\n\nThe first is titled Old People and I think it appealed to me, mostly, because I'm one of them.\n\n\"The view of old and ugly men and women, especially of those crones shuffling along with their canes. They were betrayed by their bodies, once beautiful and ready to dance. Yet in every one a lamp of consciousness is burning, hence their wonder: \"Is this me? But it can't be so!\"\"\n\nHe wrote several poems about poetry and this is one of them titled Embarrassing.\n\n\"Poetry is an embarrassing affair, it is born too near to the functions we call intimate.\n\nPoetry cannot be separated from awareness of our body. It soars above it, immaterial and at the same time captive, and is a reason for our uneasiness, for it pretends to belong to a separate zone, of spirit.\n\nI was ashamed of being a poet, as if, undressed, I would display in public my physical defects. I envied people who do not write poems and whom for that reason I ranged among the normal. And in this I was wrong: few of them deserve to be called that.\"\n\nThe last poem I will quote is one I thought was quite clever, titled A Warning.\n\n\"Little animals from cartoons, talking rabbits, doggies, squirrels, as well as ladybugs, bees, grasshoppers. They have as much in common with real animals as our notions of the world have with the real world. Think of this, and tremble.\"\n\nJanuary 10, 2018\n\nTurns out I'm a poetry reader, I just didn't find the right poet. These poems by Milosz are more epigrams or anecdotes than poems at times, but there's always an edge forcing you to sit up and pay attention. Milosz manages to walk the fine line between cynicism and openness, and explores the paradoxes of belief without ever seeming didactic or trite. Although this is work from late in his career, it has a lightness (and a darkness) that seems to float -- it seems new. Read this slowly and chew on it, and it will last you all day.\n\nJuly 2, 2020\n\nIl cagnolino lungo la strada di Milosz si presenta come un romanzo ed è ordinato come un diario critico in cui è possibile rinvenire osservazioni, informazioni e considerazioni che spaziano dal romanzo alla poesia, dalla sessualità ai sentimenti e alle pulsioni ad essa associate, alla vita e al mondo nella sua interezza, nei suoi dettagli, nelle sue filosofie.\n\nLungi dall'essere infinito, Il cagnolino lungo la strada è un frammento letterario dove si intuisce che le possibilità di esplorazione del panorama e delle realtà che attraversiamo sono più di quanto crediamo. Questo fa sì che la seconda parte del libro dedicata ai temi da cedere apra una gamma di scelte che spetta al lettore scegliere e portare avanti, lungo il percorso di lettura.\n\nGradevole, leggero (sembra un paradosso se paragonato a un'opera polacca). Da portare con sé e consultare liberamente. :)\n\nRecensione libro: https://paroleombra.com/2020/06/26/il...\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nHere is a writer who cautions against the limits of autofiction and personal narrative in favor of writing of other subjects, but Milosz's subjects betray him. Underneath his fables and anecdotes of other persons, he writes of himself, for himself. His subjects reflect his person: his clinging to the social order promised by religion, his grappling with the horrors of the century which made him, his devotion to language despite its limitations. There is nothing inherently wrong in that-all writers come to their writing from their own biased subject position-but there is a contradiction to his literary philosophy which he doesn't acknowledge. That said, this collection is filled with wisdom and beautiful prose. The poems and essays in it made me sit and think, even if I didn't agree with their conclusions. That's what good literature should do.\n\nSeptember 25, 2023\n\nEste es un libro que valdría la pena traducir al español: son textos cortos de todo tipo escritos por Milosz alrededor de sus 86 años, cuando los reunió y publicó. Hay poemas (pocos), aforismos, reflexiones hondas y sencillas, ideas para relatos, viñetas de una belleza serena, especialmente imágenes que su memoria trae de la infancia. También hay parábolas y uno que otro sermón. Hay que decir que las preocupaciones religiosas tienen un lugar central y Milosz no puede evitar un desencantado esfuerzo evangelizador. Lo que sí logra evitar, y no debe resultar fácil a los 86 años, es que el tono moralista se torne amargo.\n\nOctober 3, 2017\n\n\"Dare un senso, quale che sia, pur di sfuggire a questa realtà bovina, inerte, perfettamente apatica, senza fini, aspirazioni, affermazioni o negazioni, che è come il nulla incarnato. Religioni! Ideologie! Desideri! Odi! Venite a ricoprire con la vostra trama ornata questa cosa cieca, che neppure ha un nome.\" (Tropici, p. 80)\n\nMay 28, 2022\n\nKad vrhunski pjesnik kakav je Miloš napiše nešto prozno, onda je to, za mene, veliko otkriće. Mislim da takva proza nadograđuje sve one skraćene misli koje su bile iskazane u stihovima. U ovoj zbirci nalaze se eseji, kratke priče i poezija, tako da je ova knjiga, što se mene tiče, mikrokosmos Milošovijade.\n\nSeptember 28, 2022\n\nMy husband gets these important Polish books for Christmas, and I’m the one who reads them. So I read this because it’s already in the house. Really wasn’t for me. The writing is beautiful, but dropping into someone’s brain midstream when you know nothing of their work is not satisfying. I’d suggest this for people already familiar.\n\nSeptember 1, 2022\n\nZupełne wyjście spoza mojej czytelniczej strefy komfortu. Miłosz wydaje mi się by być..niedostępny, ze względu na swoją erudycję, spokój, nieustępliwość, patrzenie z góry..? Ale znalazłam i tu coś bardzo dla siebie (forma temu sprzyja), bardzo ciekawe doświadczenie.\n\nJanuary 25, 2018\n\nToo often too abstract for my tastes, but incredibly smart use of the short form.\n\nJanuary 10, 2021\n\nI really fought with myself to finish this book. Not my cup of tea. In my opinion, most of its content is too bitter for poetry and it is not cathartic at all.\n\nJanuary 20, 2022\n\nI will return to this another time and re-read it all. Not for me right now.\n\nSeptember 8, 2022\n\nA slog and too abstract. Random library pick.\n\nJuly 15, 2023\n\nFragments, reflections and sketches by the Nobel prize winner of 1980. Enjoyable pieces of prose they remind me a bit of Kafka's short prose pieces. Highly recommend this!\n\nAugust 26, 2023\n\nI feel called out by one of the poems\n\nJanuary 20, 2024\n\nVana ja väsinud mehe testament. Au talle. Kindlasti lugemist väärt. Kasvõi selleks, et autori toel enda seisukohti kujundada, nendega nõustuda või mitte.\n\nSuurim tarkus on südameheadus.\n\nMarch 18, 2015\n\nI took this up after \"The Issa Valley\", thinking I would like to see what C.M.'s poetry was like, and so was confused to find short paragraphs - prose poems - I wondered? But there were a few in conventional poem form as well, so I gave up trying to categorize and just read on.\n\nNot my usual thing or style, but with merit nonetheless. Some of the paragraphs were outstanding. This one I will include, even though it's long, just so I don't forget it myself.\n\nAncestors\n\nTo tell the truth we should not exist. We, not any collective plural, just you and me. Let us use our imaginations to visualize for a moment the circumstances and conditions of our parent's life, then our grandparents, then great-grandparents, thus further and further back. Even if among them all there happened to be wealthy individuals, or men of privilege, the stench and filth in which they lived, as that then was the rule, would have astonished us who use showers and toilets. What was even more certain was among them the presence of starvelings, for whom a piece of dry bread in pre-harvest time was happiness. Our ancestors died like flies from epidemics, from starvation, from wars, though children swarmed, for every twelve of them only one or two survived. And what strange tribes, what ugly snouts behinds you and me, what bloody rites in honor of gods carved in the linden tree! Back to those who are stalking through the undergrowth of a murky primeval forest with chipped stones for their only weapons, in order to split the skulls of their enemies. It would seem as if we had only parents and that's all, but those other pre-predecessors exist, and with them their afflictions, manias, mental illnesses, syphilis, tuberculosis, and what-not, and how do you know they do not continue in you? And what was the probability that among the children of your great-great- grandparents the one susrvived who would beget your ancestor? And what the probability that this would repeat itself in the next generation?\n\nAltogether, a very slim chance that we would be born in these skins, as these, not other, individuals, in whom the genes met those of the devil knows what whores and oafs. The very fact that our species survived and even multiplied beyond measure is astonishing, for it had much against it, and the primeval forest full of animals stronger than humans may serve till now as a metaphor for man's precarious situation - let us add viruses, bacteria, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, but also his own works atomic weapons and the pollution of nature. Our species should have disappeared a long time ago, and it is still alive, incredibly resistant. That you and I happen to be part of it should be enough to give us pause for meditation.\"\n\nI liked that.\n\n62) A Goal\n\n51) That\n\n47) A Warning\n\n46) Leaning Into\n\n82) But\n\n94) Autumn\n\n102) In Her Diary\n\n109) Yokimura\n\n141) Oeuvre\n\n206) Ancestors\n\nAugust 8, 2010\n\n\"And he expected the cruelty of his imagination was somehow connected with his creative impulse.\"\n\n\"Waking up at night, he felt he was working his way toward it through a thin curtain, but then, in that striving, he would fall asleep.\"\n\n\"In the act of writing, a transformation occurs: the direct data of consciousness, our feeling of ourselves from inside, is changed into an image of other individuals, similarly feeling themselves from inside, and thanks to that, we can write about them, not only about ourselves.\"\n\n\"Museums, libraries, photographs, reproductions, film archives. And amid that abundance individuals who do not realize that around them an omnipresent memory hovers and besieges, attacks their tiny consciousness.\"\n\n\"I was driven to despair during vacations by the boredom of obvious things.\"\n\n\"People, dependent as they are upon little things, are undefined and elude their own grasp or the grasp of others, yet with time they, together with little things, acquire traits that can be described, characters, like the surface of the earth, which only from a distance shows the folds of its mountain chains and the nervous system of its rivers.\"\n\n\"This occurred, however, when the individual was considered a kind of castle or fortress from which one would make sallies into the world.\"\n\n\"Had he been telling about himself he would prove he lacked maturity and peace of mind, traits necessary in a fairy-tale narrator. One more feature of the novel: magnanimity.\"\n\n\"The language itself unfurled its velvet yarn in order to cover what, without it, would equal nothing.\"\n\n\"With human beings whose names still move me.\"\n\n\"For many years my internal trouble could be reduced to the question: How to bear memory? I am inclined to see myself as an exception, in view of some traumatic experiences, and yet I realize all those who write are busy with remembering, whatever their age, gender, or the type of their traumas. As for myself, I believe such dwelling on oneself is harmful.\"\n\n\"The causes of the missions' downfall were multiple. The Sonoma mission disintegrated because of grizzly bears.\"\n\n\"They assure us that at a certain moment one observes with indifference one's immobile mortal envelope somewhere below. What I am talking about is not unlike that experience.\"\n\n\"To the valid objection that spirits do not carry umbrellas, one may answer that something, after all, must happen to the multitude of departed and useless objects, only some of which find their way to antique shops.\"\n\n\"There is only one big theme, a key which will open the treasury of your unrevealed and unconfessed, even to yourselves, experiences. These are the moments when you were, in one way or another, humiliated.\"\n\nJune 9, 2012\n\nI did not realize how similar this book was to Rilke's Book of Hours, but they both are writing about religion and spirituality since Milosz was a devout but doubting Catholic. Milosz addresses more topics than Rilke, but neither book did much for me. I felt like Milosz was jus jotting down whatever came to his head, and I could imagine being his daughter, and constantly tuning out his brief monologues.\n\n“On one side there is luminosity, trust, faith, the beauty of the earth; on the other side, darkness, doubt, unbelief, the cruelty of the earth, the capacity of people to do evil. When I write, the first side is true, when I do not write, the second is….not much philosophy, but at least it has been verified by experience.”\n\nI feel that you could substitute one word in this paragraph, instead of “when I write,” you could put the most important thing in the world to you and it would be true for you. Mine would be, ‘when I take photographs,’ or when I practice meditation, etc. Others might say when I bike, or hike, or summit a fourteener, or garden, or dance, volunteer, give charity, etc. I just love that description of being immersed in an activity and helping shape your mindset and reactions to adversity and the struggles life presents.\n\nJanuary 18, 2016\n\nNobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz was born of Polish/Lithuanian parentage. He subsequently immigrated to the United States and was professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University of California in Berkeley. This book is a collection of poetic essays and memoirs. Each chapter is excellent; it is difficult to pick favorites. However I will provide but two examples: from Discreet Charm of Nihilism, \"Religion, opium for the people. To those suffering pain, humiliation, illness, and serfdom, it promised a reward in an afterlife. And now we are witnessing a transformation. A true opium for the people is a belief in nothingness after death - the huge solace of thinking that for our betrayals, greed, cowardice, murders we are not going to be judged.\" From \"But,\" \"Why, yes, this current really ran through me, and really, I, shrunken, hunched, continue to be the same instrument. How is this possible?\"\n\nMay 22, 2013\n\nI finally got to meet him when he read from this book (obviously before he died; this was his book tour) The poem he selected was the one in which he describes the death of Christopher Robin, of A.A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories. And he writes it as a Pooh story. What struck me is how rich the SF Bay area is: Here in Berkeley was a conservative Catholic Nobel Polish writer. In North Beach was one liberal Sorbonne educated Lawrence Ferlinghetti, D Day veteran, on a navy ship in Japan after the second atomic bomb and surrender, and most importantly artist, writer and publisher. How lucky to live in such a richly diverse area.\n\nJanuary 17, 2014\n\nThis book reminded me of reading a newspaper, short columns with headlines, except of course the news is poetic and philosophical. There were stories I skimmed, stories I reread just to be clear, and there were those I stopped to marvel at, as if I couldn't quite believe them. Much of the book is slanted toward the life and craft of an author, so Milosz writes with his own sensibilities coming to the front, his life in two worlds, the old Polish one at the end of the turn of the 20th century, and the modern 20th century America where he lived his professional life. The old world was for me the most fascinating, and his forays into the heart."
