Today neither of them is alive,\n\nNot the hare, nor the man who made the gesture.\n\nO my love, where are they, where are they going\n\nThe flash of a hand, streak of movement, rustle of pebbles.\n\nI ask not out of sorrow, but in wonder.\n\nWilno, 1936\n\n“Encounter” from The Collected Poems 1931-1987 by Czeslaw Milosz.
