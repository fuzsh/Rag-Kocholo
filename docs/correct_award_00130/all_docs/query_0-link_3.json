        "text": "Czesław Miłosz (born June 30, 1911, Šeteniai, Lithuania, Russian Empire [now in Lithuania]—died August 14, 2004, Kraków, Poland) was a Polish American author, translator, critic, and diplomat who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1980.\n\nThe son of a civil engineer, Miłosz completed his university studies in Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania), which belonged to Poland between the two World Wars. His first book of verse, Poemat o czasie zastygłym (1933; “Poem of Frozen Time”), expressed catastrophic fears of an impending war and worldwide disaster. During the Nazi occupation he moved to Warsaw, where he was active in the resistance and edited Pieśń niepodległa: poezja polska czasu wojny (1942; “Independent Song: Polish Wartime Poetry”), a clandestine anthology of well-known contemporary poems.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPoetry: First Lines\n\nMiłosz’s collection Ocalenie (1945; “Rescue”) contained his prewar poems and those written during the occupation. In the same year, he joined the Polish diplomatic service and was sent, after briefly working during 1946 in the Polish embassy in New York City, to Washington, D.C., as cultural attaché, and then to Paris, as first secretary for cultural affairs in Paris. There he asked for political asylum in 1951. Nine years later he immigrated to the United States, where he joined the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley and taught Slavic languages and literature until his retirement in 1980. Miłosz became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1970.\n\nThere are several volumes of English translations of Miłosz’s poetry, including The Collected Poems 1931–1987 (1988) and Provinces (1991). His prose works included his autobiography, Rodzinna Europa (1959; Native Realm), Prywatne obowiązki (1972; “Private Obligations”), the novel Dolina Issy (1955; The Issa Valley), and The History of Polish Literature (1969)."
