        "text": "The Estate of Seamus Heaney, Krakow Festival Office (KBF) – operator of the Krakow UNESCO City of Literature programme, and the Irish Embassy in Poland, are pleased to announce that Irish poet Alice Lyons has been selected to be the first writer-in-residence of the new Heaney-Miłosz Residency, to take place in Krakow, Poland.\n\nAlice Lyons is an Irish writer, originally from the USA, who has lived in the west of Ireland for over 20 years. Author of three books of poetry and one novel, she is the recipient of several awards both in Ireland and the USA for her work. Her poetry film, The Polish Language, co-directed with Orla Mc Hardy, was nominated for an Irish Film and Television Award (IFTA) in 2010 and continues to tour cinemas, festivals and galleries worldwide. She has been to Poland a number of times and many of her poems have been translated into Polish, appearing most recently in publications such as Czas Literatury and Tygodnik Powszechny. She currently lectures in writing and literature at the Yeats Academy of Arts, Design & Architecture at the Institute of Technology, Sligo.\n\nThe Heaney–Miłosz Residency aims to support writers, resident in Ireland, who are at the early to mid-stages of their careers. It is intended that the residency period will provide writers the space and time to develop their work in the beautiful surroundings of Krakow city.\n\nDuring the residency period, the writer will have the opportunity to take part in a variety of events and meetings with representatives of the creative and literary community in Krakow. At the end of the residency, the writer will provide a written reflection on her experience in Krakow.\n\nAwarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1980, Czesław Miłosz is one of Poland's most outstanding writers. Described by Seamus Heaney as a \"veteran of turmoil\", Miłosz personally experienced the devastation of war and occupation in Central and Eastern Europe. These experiences, as well as his Polish-Lithuanian heritage, shaped his writing. As Seamus Heaney said of Miłosz's work: \"You are a slave to a unique voice, a poetry imbued with the density of experience that has been lived and radiated by an understanding that has made it symbolic.\"\n\nIt was in Krakow that Miłosz and Seamus Heaney – also a Nobel laureate – strengthened their friendship. The works of both authors grow out of difficult experiences of conflict and adversity, and they are also linked by a commitment to dignity and human rights."
