        "text": "(1911–2004). “The world that Miłosz depicts in his poetry, prose, and essays is the world in which man lives after having been driven out of paradise.” The citation for the Nobel prize for literature awarded to Czesław Miłosz in 1980 also noted the “insistent and provocative” quality of his writing—all published first in Polish. An underground writer during the Nazi occupation of Poland and a self-imposed exile from communism, he preferred to communicate his political themes in his native language even after he became an American citizen.\n\nMiłosz was born on June 30, 1911, in Šateiniai, Russian Lithuania, which later became part of Poland. His first book of verse, Poemat o czasie zastygłym (Poem of Frozen Time), was published when he was 21. He was already a socialist and leader of the Catastrophist group of poets, so named for their predictions of worldwide disaster. During World War II he joined the Resistance and edited, wrote, or translated many clandestine works.\n\nHis poetry collection Ocalenie (1945; Rescue) was one of the first books published in postwar communist Poland. Miłosz served as a cultural attaché for his government but, unable to accept socialist realism (the officially approved literary style), he sought political asylum in France in 1951. Nine years later he moved to the United States, where he taught at the University of California at Berkeley. He was naturalized in 1970 but moved back to Poland in 1989. His books include the autobiography Rodzinna Europa (1959; Native Realm) and the novel Dolina Issy (1955; The Issa Valley). He died in Kraków, Poland, on August 14, 2004."
