        "text": "Every ABA Accredited Law School in the United States\n\nOnce you have passed the LSAT, you are ready to apply to law school. The LSAC can assist you in this endeavor, and some ABA-accredited law schools require that you use services provided by the LSAC when applying. This list shows you which services are required or recommended by ABA-accredited law schools.\n\nMost, if not all, ABA-accredited law schools insist upon you using the LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS). This handy service helps you organize transcripts and references into a nice, neat package. All college transcripts, from every institution you have ever attended (regardless of whether or not you received a degree) must be mailed directly from the institution to Law School Admission Council,662 Penn Street, PO BOX 2000-M,Newtown PA 18940-0993. If you attended institutions outside of the United States, its territories, or Canada, have those transcripts mailed directly from the institution to Law School Admission Council, 662 Penn Street, PO BOX 8502, Newtown PA 18940-8502.\n\nChoose the state below to view ABA accredited schools:\n\nThe second part of the LSAC’s CAS helps you to obtain letters of reference and online evaluations from those most familiar with your character and work. The LSAC will provide you with pre-printed forms to hand to those who are submitting letters of recommendation to the LSAC’s CAS on your behalf. In addition, when you supply the CAS with names of individuals who have agreed to complete online evaluations of your professionalism and moral character, the CAS will contact these people directly and instruct them on how to complete online evaluations.\n\nThe CAS costs $155 and is payable to the LSAC through your online account with them. Not only does this cover the arranging, gathering and organizing of documentation, it also covers electronic applications to all ABA-approved law schools to which you choose to apply.\n\nHow do you know which law schools are accredited by the ABA? The LSAC maintains a list of currently accredited institutions here. Simply click on the state in which you are interested in attending law school to find contact information for schools that are ABA-accredited.\n\nIn an ABA-accredited law school, you can expect to take certain courses that are mandated by the ABA. These courses surround the topics of substantive law, legal research, legal reasoning, legal problem-solving, legal writing, oral communication, professionalism, professional responsibility, history and goals of the ABA, and live client interactions via internships, externships or pro-bono work.\n\nThe law degree you will receive upon graduation is known as the Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree. Under ABA rules, it must take you at least two years, but no longer than seven years, to complete the requirements for your J.D. degree. The ABA mandates that you must complete 83 semester hours (129 quarter hours) of credit to earn a J.D. degree.\n\nIf you have not completed your bachelors degree view pre-law undergraduate programs options.
