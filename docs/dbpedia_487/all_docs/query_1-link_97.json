        "text": "As Virginia Tech football wrapped up phase two of fall camp on Wednesday, the Hokies hosted their annual media day - showcasing a group filled with talent that brings back a plethora of returners from the 2023 team.\n\nNow in 2024, the Hokies aim to take another huge leap forward in the program - with sights set on competing in the ACC in the third year under head coach Brent Pry.\n\nAnd in the midst of a talented linebacker room sits a pair of Bristol natives - Jaden Keller from Tennessee High and Brody Jones from Virginia High - both competing for time on the field.\n\n\"It's a very competitive room. Guys always making plays,\" said Keller. \"You always have to be on top of your game every day, every game, every practice, every snap - you have to treat it like a real live game.\"\n\nIt has also taught each of the Bristol kids a lot about the game and off the field along the way.\n\n\"I thought I was just going to come in here and do my thing like I did in high school, but these boys are big. It's different here,\" said Brody Jones. \"It's been a big change, but it's been really good to grow as a person and as a football player.\"\n\nAs the pair work for snaps on the field in 2024, they continue to keep in mind who and what they're representing when putting on the Hokies jersey.\n\n\"It means a lot to represent my city and where I'm from. Bristol is not a big city, so there's not many of us out here,\" added Keller. \"Not many of us out here so I gotta put out and show out for them.\"\n\nLike Keller, Jones feel grateful to be out on the field and giving the people of Bristol something to look forward to this fall.\n\n\"It feels really good to represent my hometown, especially with my man Jaden Keller here,\" said Jones. \"It feels good.\""
