        "text": "What we look for\n\nThe Admissions Committee reviews applications holistically in making admissions decisions.\n\nThe applicant's undergraduate grade point average (UGPA) and the LSAT score are two important factors in determining admission to the School of Law, in addition to the other required application components including: the personal statement, resume, letter(s) of recommendation, optional diversity statement, and any addenda submitted with the application.\n\nAlso considered are other factors that indicate an ability to successfully complete the requirements for a Juris Doctor degree including: graduate degree, work experience, involvement in undergraduate extracurricular activities, rigor of undergraduate courses, community involvement, life experiences and other appropriate considerations. Each application is reviewed on an individual basis.\n\nWhile we value the lasting impact our community has on our alumni and all the ways their success makes us stronger as an institution, our admission process does not give specific preference or advantage to legacy status in the review process.\n\nThe Admissions Committee releases decisions from December through July of each year. Most decisions are mailed in March and April, or, for applications submitted late in the process, 6 - 8 weeks after file completion.\n\nApplicants are notified promptly by U.S. Mail when a decision has been reached. Applicants improve opportunities for favorable decisions and scholarship consideration by applying early.\n\nRoger Williams University School of Law is committed to establishing a diverse student population and encourages members of minority groups, women and other traditionally under-represented groups in the legal profession to apply for admission.\n\nApplication Components\n\nA Completed School of Law Application\n\nStudents apply to the School of Law by submitting an electronic application through the Law School Admission Council (LSAC).\n\nStart your application\n\nCAS Registration\n\nApplicants are required to register with the Credential Assembly Service (CAS).\n\nThe CAS report includes the LSAT score(s) and transcripts from all the undergraduate and graduate schools attended. The RWU Law code number is 3081.\n\nTo register for the LSAT and CAS, please contact: Law Services, P.O. Box 2000, Newtown, PA 18930-0998. Telephone (215) 968-1001 or online at www.lsac.org.\n\nApplicants who received their undergraduate degree outside the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada should review the requirements for International Student Applicants.\n\nAdmission to the school is contingent upon completion of the baccalaureate degree.\n\nLSAT\n\nEach applicant must take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), which is offered several times per year.\n\nWe recommend that you take the LSAT no later than January in the year in which you intend to matriculate. While we will accept an April test score, we encourage you to take an earlier test for optimal consideration for admission and scholarship consideration.\n\nA June test score will be considered on a case by case basis. Please contact the Office of Admissions at (401) 254-4555 before registering for the June exam if you plan to take the test in the year in which you intend to matriculate.\n\nWe will not accept a July or August test score in the year in which you intend to matriculate.\n\nLSAT scores are considered stale after five years.\n\nAdditional information on the LSAT, including test dates, test locations, free online test preparation, and online registration, is available from the Law School Admission Council.\n\nPersonal Statement\n\nThe Admissions Committee attaches significant value to statements made in this supplement, which should not exceed three (3) pages and should address:\n\na. Why do you want to pursue the study of law?\n\nb. What educational, employment, or family experiences would be relevant to your application?\n\nc. What unique factors in your background would enrich the RWU Law classroom experience?\n\nThe personal statement will be uploaded as an attachment through the LSAC application.\n\nLetter(s) of Recommendation\n\nOne letter of recommendation is required to complete your application. The School of Law welcomes and reads additional letters. Letters must be submitted directly to the LSAC and will be forwarded to the School of Law via the CAS Report. If you have been enrolled in an academic program within the last three years, the School of Law prefers at least one academic recommendation.\n\nPositive and meaningful recommendations concerning your analytical skills, communication, and writing abilities often prove helpful in the Committee's decision making. Therefore, the School of Law advises the submission of letters of recommendation from college professors who can attest to your ability to enter a competitive professional program. If you have been out of school for some time, letters from a supervisor or co-worker can be helpful.\n\nThe School of Law requires that letters be submitted through the LSAC Letter of Recommendation Service that serves all member schools. This service is included in the CAS Registration Subscription. Letters will be copied and sent to the Office of Admissions along with your CAS Report.\n\nResume\n\nSubmit a resume that outlines your academic and professional experience. The resume will be uploaded as an attachment through the LSAC application.\n\nMission Statement Essay (Optional)\n\nYou may submit an optional mission statement essay. The School of Law seeks to admit a class of varying backgrounds and experiences. In our judgment, exposure to widely diverse people, ideas, cultures, and viewpoints help prepare students to develop the skills and sensitivity necessary to succeed in today's classroom environment.\n\nCharacter & Fitness\n\nIn addition to a bar examination, there are character, fitness, and other qualifications for admission to the bar in every U.S. jurisdiction. Applicants are encouraged to determine the requirements for any jurisdiction in which they intend to seek admission by contacting the jurisdiction. Addresses for all relevant agencies are available through the National Bar Conference of Bar Examiners."
