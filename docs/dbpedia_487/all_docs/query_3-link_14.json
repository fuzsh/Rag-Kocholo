        "text": "I am excited to announce that I am a part of the Diversity and Inclusion blog team at The Student Lawyer. I have recently written my first article, with thanks to Christianah Omobosola Babajide for her help in editing, which has been published to the website. My first article focusing on terms at University that I had not heard of, as well as explaining what the different types of legal work experience that are on offer to those who start university. These are all terms that I had to learn myself when starting university and the aim of the article is to aid those beginning their legal careers - especially those who are first-generation university students and have to navigate university and the legal world without prior knowledge. If you would like to read this articles, a link can be found below: https://lnkd.in/e-V_CJCt\n\n#ThoughtsonLawSchool The Big Fat LLM (Masters in Law) / Part I Recently, a friend made a stray remark: “Columbia accepts everyone.” They were alluding to the notion that if your CV and SOP adequately reflect a passion for law—developed and honed during the ages of 17-23—and have a meaty LoR backing it, you will get admission into an Ivy League university easily. On the face of it, the Columbia LLM (and foreign LLMs in general) are in vogue. These programs are offered by some of the leading global north universities, and Indian students who largely receive below-par legal education at the undergraduate level may finally learn, as the American realist Oliver Holmes put it, “law in action.” But how true is this narrative? Who are these students flocking to these global north universities? What is the value—in educational and financial terms—that these universities truly offer? This is where it gets murky. Another friend remarked, “Indian parties at these schools, you cannot separate them from those happening at South Bombay or an upscale Delhi bar.” The point being, the demographic of students—without a scholarship—going to these universities remains the upper caste, upper class, cultural capital-loaded students. Interestingly, in inner circles of LLM gossip, it is said that the real achievement is only if a student can get into Oxford, Harvard, or Yale. Maybe Cambridge. All the other universities are milking the Indian student because the LLM degree has little real value abroad. Even with the latter, it’s the university tag more than the LLM degree that holds true value. Now, I have been lucky to have studied at a (falsely labelled) elite university for my undergrad in law. It is common knowledge that if you are in the top 4-5 law schools and your English is decent, a coveted law firm job is guaranteed notwithstanding your grades and other achievements, or the lack thereof. In fact, sprinkle some pop culture knowledge around sports, sophisticated TV shows, and the like—and you’re gold. The reverse is also true—folks who don’t make it to these law schools and study in “tier II” and “tier III” law schools have to work twice as hard to even secure internships at big law firms. So, they often go for a master’s with the hope that this would bolster their chances. Sadly, this rarely pays off given the undergrad school bias which exists. Broadly, LLM students fall into three categories: affluent backgrounds —either through accumulated wealth or saved income, those seeking to overcome undergrad bias, and scholarship recipients. LLMs are not per se bad, with many scholars, activists, and professionals excelling in foreign programs outside the big four. Sadly, Indian LLMs are not just frowned upon but often mocked despite being about 1% of the cost. This leaves students in a double bind: lacking funds for a flashy foreign LLM and facing ridicule for pursuing one in India. #CriticalLegalEducation #LawSchool #Lawstudents #Globalsouth\n\nBouncing off from Paul Gascoyne’s fabulous advice… What can school leavers do to maximise their opportunities of getting a solicitor apprenticeship? Points 6-10 are still very applicable! Graduate recruitment practices for solicitor apprenticeships are typically the same/similar to those of training contracts. However, any careers advice you receive may be coming from your Heads of Year instead. Taking into account that school leavers do not have access to university opportunities and services, here are some other things you can do to boost your application: 1. Create your own law club/society. This will show great leadership skills, innovation and collaboration. If you already have one, then join it! 2. Stay commercially aware by reading the news regularly or checking into Legal Cheek for more informal updates. 3. Read Jake Schogger’s ‘Commercial Law Handbook’ to build your understanding of commercial law. This should then inspire your further reading. 4. Attend events with Uptree or Young Professionals to hear from employers and begin building your network. 5. Complete virtual work experiences with Springpod and Forage. These will mitigate the lack of vacation scheme opportunities for school leavers. … and for any socially-mobile students in my network: 6. Apply for PRIME work experience schemes. These are very competitive but will give you a chance to have in-person legal work experience without having any previous connections in the industry. #law #solicitor #apprentice #apprenticeship #recruitment\n\nStudent Organization Spotlight /// The Federalist Society Tell us a little bit about the Organization: mission, goals, etc. The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies (FedSoc) is a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in the current state of the legal order. It is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be. The Society seeks both to promote an awareness of these principles and to further their application through its activities. As an organization on campus, we strive to promote open debate and conversation around legal issues that impact our nation by hosting events featuring judges, lawyers, and scholars. Can alumni get involved? Absolutely! In addition to hosting a Fall Alumni Career panel, we regularly connect students to alumni and love when more alumni reach out and wish to get involved. If interested, alumni should get in contact with the Society by reaching out to WLU.FederalistSociety@gmail.com or filling out the FedSoc alumni survey: https://lnkd.in/egfkrNCH https://lnkd.in/evvqRwuA\n\nDear Esteemed Law Firms, I write to share my conviction on the pre-existing system where candidates for internships in law firms are shortlisted based on the renowned visibility of their law schools. This judgment, therefore, benefits from a select few universities but unfortunately withers the achievements that would otherwise be secured for students from other traditional institutions of higher learning. It has to be accepted that acquirement of the legal expertise and robust preparation is not a privilege of a certain law school but rather is a result of consistently persistent academic training and practical practice. Students from traditional universities have the necessary skills and know-how that they need to navigate successfully in the competitive legal profession. The academic curricula we offer are all-encompassing, in that they involve the teaching of basic legal principles, critical thinking skills, and analytical methods of legal research. We are doing practical research papers writing, we are participating in moot courts and we are actively involved in different student organizations. The practical application of these abundant skills is precisely what allows us to craft stronger analytical, argumentative, and drafting academies, and how legal practice functions. On the other hand, the determination and hardworking nature of regular universities proves to be rock solid. We can assure you that we will be in a position to put in even more hours (between 12 – 14) every day, whenever necessary, to carry out the tasks that this prestigious job demands. Besides the internships that we have had in the various sectors of the law, these have also exposed us to practical knowledge and a strong observation of the legal procedure. The fundamental problem we are wrestling with here is that we do not have enough good and proper ways to exhibit our strengths. The rule of law school fields in the interview process further exposes a biased system that not just dismisses but also does not recognize the honorable people in the greater pool of talents. We therefore request that law firms adopt a deliberate and all-inclusive approach to job applicant assessment by considering several elements which may include academic performance, insight into the real world, skills that are proven. Ensuring equal chances for law student prospectors irrespective of their institutional environment, through a diverse body of different and rich professionals is not only a reason which attracts the immaturity of the law profession but on the contrary, it diversifies the legal profession. It is our goal that we got such means of fairness and justice of the recruitment process which will be based on logical decision-making as well as willingness as the primary factors in selection. #law #legal #supremecourtofindia #highcourt #lawfirm #internship #khaitan #amarchandmangaldas #shardulamarchandmangaldas #cyrilamarchandmangaldas #azb #trilegal #ziamodi #cyrilshroff\n\nTHE 10 LIST. It's a law journal exclusively for LLM Students. Now seeking submissions. Why is it only for LLMs? Law School Career Services departments and extracurricular activities are almost entirely built to support JD students. The pursuit of job opportunities after earning your LLM degree can be daunting, given the legal recruitment structure predominantly favoring JDs. While JD students enjoy a structured and robust recruitment cycle, often securing employment before graduation, LLM students navigate a more rugged terrain. The 10 List aims to be a catalyst for outstanding LLM students and recent graduates, highlighting the best foreign LLM students in the United States. The 10 List endeavors to elevate this year's distinguished LLM achievers, offering them a platform to shine. The 10 List warmly invites current LLM students and recent graduates to share their insights through articles, essays, or book reviews. We are seeking submissions that delve into any relevant subject matter and cultivate enriching discourse within the American legal community. Our objective is to spotlight works that explore legal themes with profundity, innovation, and originality.
