        "text": "BCC is a great school to help you get your general education out of the way while you discover what major you want to pursue. There's a lot of free resources that can help you make a choice. And if you ever want to change your major, it's as simple as making an appointment with an advisor and talking through the changes you want to make. The transfer program is the best they have to offer for students who want to continue their education at a nearby, eligible university while keeping tuition costs the same. I'm a big advocate of not taking on loans and debt just to pursue an education, and the academics at BCC don't fall short like most other community colleges do. The only downside is that if you're looking for the quintessential college experience, you will not find that at BCC. It's a community college, meaning that there's no dormitories, major sports or clubs that you can join. There's extracurricular stuff you can participate in, but they're not anything special in the slightest.\n\nAs a freshman in both college and high school, you can imagine my life is pretty hectic. BCC has not only made my first college experience amazing but they have also provided support in anything you could need. With all the support comes the amazing professors I have had so far. With the way dual enrollment works, some college professors here teach high schools myself and I know how frustrating that can be sometimes but through it all, they always stayed professional, and never once have I doubted their confidence in what they are doing."
