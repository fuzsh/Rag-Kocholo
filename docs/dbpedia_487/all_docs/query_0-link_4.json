        "text": "The Firm\n\nSkadden is one of the leading law firms in the world with approximately 1,700 lawyers in 23 offices across the globe. Clients include corporate, industrial, financial institutions and government entities. The London office is the gateway to the firm’s European practice, which has some 250 lawyers dedicated to top-end, cross-border corporate transactions and international arbitration and litigation. The firm has handled matters in nearly every country in the greater European region and in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe Work\n\nLawyers across the European network focus primarily on corporate transactions, including domestic and cross-border mergers and acquisitions, private equity, capital markets, leveraged finance and banking, tax, corporate restructuring and energy and projects. The firm also advises in international arbitration, litigation, investigations and regulatory matters.\n\nTrainee Profile\n\nThe firm seeks to recruit a small number of high-calibre graduates from any discipline to join their highly successful London office as trainee solicitors. The firm is looking for candidates who combine intellectual ability with enthusiasm, creativity and a demonstrable ability to rise to a challenge and to work with others towards a common goal.\n\nTrainees will join a close-knit but diverse team in which one will be given ample opportunity to work on complex matters, almost all with an international aspect, whilst benefiting from highly personalised training and supervision in an informal and friendly environment. The first year of a training contract will be divided into two six month seats where one will gain experience in corporate transactions and international litigation and arbitration. In the second year trainees will have the opportunity to discuss preferences for the remaining two seats. Secondment to the firm’s Hong Kong or New York offices are also offered for second year trainees."
