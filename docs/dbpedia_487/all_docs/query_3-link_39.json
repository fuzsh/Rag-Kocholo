        "text": "Our Work\n\nThe only constant is change and this has never been truer in the legal sector than today. As the pace of change quickens, the sector has become ever more conscious of the importance of its people and their wellbeing. BLS supports members with events, initiatives and organisations that assist people and practices in creating happy healthy thriving workplaces.\n\nTechnological innovation and ways to improve efficiency in our working practices have been with us for some time but was brought into sharper focus as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic as hybrid and flexible working became the norm requiring the efficient and confidential sharing of information and bringing teams and people together in virtual work spaces together with a renewed focus on innovative client focussed solutions. Bristol + Bath LegalTech, of which Bristol Law Society is a founding partner, provides opportunities for law firms and tech firms to come together to create innovative solutions and for law firms to share sector best practice.\n\nESG (Environment Social Governance) is a key focus within the sector with cross firm groups working together on equality, community engagement and sustainability issues.\n\nThe sector recognises the importance of promoting a modern, diverse, and inclusive profession where access to the profession is welcomed regardless of your social, economic, gender or racial background; the prospects of internal promotion are equal for all, and organisations can reflect the communities in which they are based. Our Equality, Diversity & Inclusion sub-committee draws members from many firms across our City and collectively they organise collaborative events with other EDI stakeholders, including roundtables and data gathering surveys together with the dissemination of news and legal updates, policies and being a voice for the profession locally.\n\nThe Bristol legal sector is known as one, if not the biggest sector contributor to community engagement in the City as demonstrated by the Feeding Bristol fundraiser in 2019. The amount of volunteering and fundraising activity that is undertaken by firms and chambers in schools, youth groups and other charitable organisations is quite extraordinary and is something that the sector should be rightly proud of.\n\nEqually, the sector is responding to the climate emergency and many organisations are taking steps whether small achievable quicks wins or more ambitious initiatives to tackle CO2 emissions both internally and via their supply chains. As ever, the sector rallies together and increasingly, there are collaborative events and initiatives which brings the power of the many to effect real change."
