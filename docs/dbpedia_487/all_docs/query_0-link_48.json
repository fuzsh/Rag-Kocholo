He also instructed children in writing and in simple gestures.\n\nMore info:\n\n1579 - 1652: Manuel Ramírez de Carrión\n\nManuel Ramírez de Carrión, was the teacher and pedagogue of a few and select deaf (“mudos ”, in the saying of the time) belonging to noble families of 17th century Spain.\n\nMore info:\n\n1606 - 1656: John Bulwer (UK)\n\nJohn Bulwer is known as the first person in England to propose educating deaf people.\n\nMore info:\n\n1620: Juan Pablo Bonet, the first book on the subject of manual alphabetic signs (ES)\n\nIn 1620, Juan Pablo Bonet published the first book on the subject of manual alphabetic signs for the deaf.\n\nBonet was of the first teachers to devise and record in print a sign alphabet, and his system has had some influence on modern sign languages. However, he was also typical of his age in believing that signing was only a step towards an ideal of oralism rather than a valid form of communication in itself.\n\nMore info:\n\n1669 – 1724: Amman, Johann Konrad (NL)\n\nJohan Konra Amman became a teacher of the deaf around 1690 when a deaf girl, Esther Collader, was brought to him; he succeeded in teaching her to speak.\n\nAmman strongly believed in oral techniques using lipreading and articulation teaching. His process consisted principally in exciting the attention of his pupils to the motions of his lips and larynx while he spoke, and then inducing them to imitate these movements, until he brought them to repeat distinctly letters, syllables and words.\n\nMore info:\n\n1670 – 1750: Étienne de Fay: First deaf teacher of the deaf in France (FR)\n\nÉtienne de Fay was born deaf into a noble family, then placed with the monks at the Abbey of St Jean in Amiens. From 1720 to 1725, he was the first deaf teacher known in France who taught deaf children, before the Abbé de l'Epée.\n\nMore info:\n\n1700 - 1800 To Top\n\n1712 - 1789: Abbé Charles Michel de l'Epée (FR)\n\n\"Abbé Charles Michel de l'Epée of Paris founded the first free school for deaf people in 1755.\"\n\n\"He first recognized and learned the signs that were already being used by deaf people in Paris and then developed his sign system. He added a signed version of spoken French.\"\n\nMore info:\n\n1715 - 1780: Jacob Rodrigues Pereira (FR)\n\nJacob Rodrigues Pereira (born April 11, 1715 in Peniche , Portugal ; died September 15, 1780 in Paris ) was a Portuguese-French Jewish educator. As a pedagogue, he developed a teaching method for the deaf and is considered a pioneer in France .\n\nMore info:\n\n1715 – 1806: Thomas Braidwood (UK)\n\nThomas Braidwood (1715–1806) was a Scottish educator, significant in the history of deaf education. He was the founder of Britain's first school for the deaf.\n\nBraidwood changed his vocation from teaching hearing pupils to teaching the deaf, and renamed his building Braidwood's Academy for the Deaf and Dumb, the first school of its kind in Britain.\n\nThe educational approach utilized a \"combined system\" incorporating sign language, articulation, speech, and lip-reading. Braidwood's input into the development and application of a signed language has been credited as one of the most significant influencers of what would become British Sign Language.\n\nMore info:\n\n1727 - 1790: Samuel Heinicke (DE)\n\n\"Samuel Heinicke was born April 14, 1727, in the part of Europe that is now the eastern part of Germany. In 1754, he began tutoring students—and one of them was deaf. This deaf student reportedly was a young boy. He used the manual alphabet to teach that deaf pupil.\"\n\n\"In 1777, his reputation as a deaf educator was so well established that he was asked to open the first (oral) public school for the deaf. This school opened in Leipzig, Germany and it was the first school for the deaf officially recognized by a government.\"\n\nMore info:\n\n1742 - 1822: Abbé Sicard, Teacher of the Deaf (FR)\n\nRoch-Ambroise Cucurron Sicard (20 September 1742 – 10 May 1822) was a French abbé and instructor of the deaf.\n\nIn 1789, on the death of the Abbé de l'Épée, he succeeded him at a leading school for the deaf which Épée had founded in Paris.\n\nMore info:\n\n1747 - 1799 : Pierre Desloges (FR)\n\nIn 1779, Piere Desloges wrote what may be the first book published by a deaf person, in which he advocated for the use of sign language in deaf education.\n\nIt was in part a rebuttal of the views of Abbé Claude-François Deschamps de Champloiseau, who had published a book arguing against the use of signs.\n\nDesloges explained, \"like a Frenchman who sees his language belittled by a German who knows only a few French words, I thought I was obliged to defend my language against the false charges of this author.\" He describes a community of deaf people using a sign language (now referred to as Old French Sign Language).\n\nMore info:\n\n1753 - 1829: Ottavio Assarotti (IT)\n\n\"Ottavio Giovanni Battista Assarotti (25 October 1753 in Genoa – 24 January 1829) was an Italian philanthropist and founder of the first school for deaf people in Genoa, Italy.\"\n\nMore info:\n\n1755: First School for the Deaf in France, Abbé Charles Michel de l'Epée\n\n\"Abbé Charles Michel de l'Epée of Paris founded the first free school for deaf people in 1755.\"\n\nMore info:\n\n1760: First School for the Deaf in the UK, Edinburgh\n\nIn 1760, Scottish teacher, Thomas Braidwood founded Braidwood Academy for the Deaf and Dumb in Edinburgh. The school's rapid gain of public attention could be credited to Thomas Braidwood's brazen advertising of his methods and his institution.\n\nMore info:\n\n1772 - 1836: Roberto Francisco Prádez, first Deaf teacher of the Deaf in Spain\n\nRoberto Prádez was Spain's first deaf teacher of the deaf. Although he has been neglected historically, Prádez is a founding father of deaf education, a heroic figure who contributed crucially to the establishment and operation of Spain's first state-sponsored school.\n\nMore info:\n\n1772 - 1846: Jean Massieu, First Deaf Teacher of the Deaf in France\n\nJean Massieu (1772 – July 21, 1846) was a pioneering deaf educator. One of six deaf siblings, he was denied schooling until age thirteen when he met Abbé Sicard, who enrolled him in the Institute national des jeunes sourds de Bordeaux-Gradignan, the Bordeaux School for Deaf Children.\n\nMore info:\n\n1775 - 1848: Jakub Falkowski (PL)\n\nMore info:\n\n1776 - 1839: Pär Aron Borg (SE)\n\nIn 1809, Pär Aron Borg founded Allmänna institutet för döfstumma och blinda å Manilla (Public Institute of the Blind and Deaf at Manilla; Manillaskolan). The school had deaf teachers, and the instruction was taught in sign language.\n\nMore info:\n\n1778: First School for the Deaf in Germany, Leipzig (DE)\n\nIn 1778 Samuel Heinicke opened the first German public school for the education of the deaf in Leipzig.\n\nHeinicke insisted that lipreading was the best training method because it made his students speak and understand the language as it was used in society.\n\nMore info:\n\n1779: First School for the Deaf in Austria, Vienna\n\nThe first Austrian school for the deaf (Taubstummeninstitut) was established in Vienna in 1779 after a visit by Emperor Joseph II to Abbé de l'Epée's school in Paris.\n\nMore info:\n\n1779 - 1823: Peter Atke Castberg (DK)\n\nCastberg was provided with a grant from the King of Denmark to study deaf education in Europe for two years (1803 - 1805), including de l'Epée school in Paris.\n\nAt his return in 1805, Castberg began teaching eight deaf children, and on April 17, 1807, the King signed the charter for Døvsstumme-Institutet i Kiøbenhavn (The Institute of the Deaf-Mute in Copenhagen).\n\nMore info:\n\n1785 - 1869: Laurent Clerc, Deaf Teacher of the Deaf\n\nLouis Laurent Marie Clerc (26 December 1785 – 18 July 1869) was a French teacher called \"The Apostle of the Deaf in America\" and was regarded as the most renowned deaf person in American Deaf History.\n\nWith Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, he co-founded the first school for the deaf in North America, the Asylum for the Education and Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, on April 15, 1817.\n\nMore info:\n\n1786: First School for the Deaf in the Czech Republic, Prague\n\nThe Institute for the Deaf was founded on December 7, 1786 in Prague.\n\nFrom 1787, Karel Berger taught reading and writing with the finger alphabet. He created concepts with the help of characters and deaf and hard of hearing students also learned to articulate.\n\nThe real genius of sign language, which was ahead of its time in this area, was Václav Frost. His method was called \"Frostr's combined method\", also \"Czech method\" and \"Prague\", which from today's point of view means that it is a bilingual teaching. Frost used sign language to teach some subjects and, among other things, practiced articulation, reading and writing. He was aware that the deaf needed both.\n\nMore info:\n\n1790: First School for the Deaf in the Netherlands, Groningen\n\nOn April 14, 1790, Henri Daniel Guyot founded the first Institute for the Deaf in the Netherlands.\n\nMore info:\n\n1792: First Public School for the Deaf in the UK, London\n\nEngland’s first public institution for deaf children known as ‘London Asylum for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb Children of the Poor’ was started in London in 1792\n\nMore info:\n\n1796 - 1874: Andreas Christian Møller, Deaf Founder of the first school for the deaf in Norway\n\nAndreas Christian Møller (born 18 February 1796 in Trondheim, died 24 December 1874) was a Norwegian wood turner and deaf teacher who founded the first school for the deaf in Norway.
