        "text": "GREENFIELD — Six days after 15-year-old Cheyenne Medina went missing from her mother’s home at Leyden Woods Apartments, police confirmed Monday that she has returned to Greenfield and appears to be unharmed.\n\nActing Police Chief Todd Dodge said at 4:15 p.m. Monday that Cheyenne was located in Massachusetts but outside of Franklin County earlier in the afternoon. He said police did not have reason to believe she was harmed in any way, but that the case remains under investigation, as there might have been “some criminal activity” on the part of those who helped her during the time she was missing.\n\nDodge was uncertain on Monday afternoon if Cheyenne had been found by someone or if she had returned voluntarily.\n\n“It seems as though she had walked herself in [to a police station], but I can’t say for sure yet,” Dodge said. “Our primary concern was that she is safe, and she is.”\n\nCheyenne, a Greenfield High School student, was staying with her mother Kendra Bristol at her home at Leyden Woods Apartments last week, when she had an argument with her mother about her social media use and left home for a walk without her phone at approximately 7 p.m.\n\n“Usually she gets upset and just goes to her room. One time before, she went to take a 20-minute walk and came right back home,” Bristol said. “About 45 minutes passed and I thought, ‘OK, she got her space, I’ll go get her,’ but she wasn’t in our neighborhood, where she usually is.”\n\nBristol said Monday morning that she had not seen her daughter since that argument, but on Tuesday night, she heard from one of Cheyenne’s friends that Cheyenne had asked to borrow a cellphone. Later that evening, Bristol said she heard reports that Cheyenne had knocked on her boyfriend’s neighbor’s door on Hope Street.\n\nAt approximately 3:30 p.m. on Monday, however, Bristol received a call from police officers informing her that her daughter was found safe. She said she was not sure where Cheyenne went or how she managed to travel outside of Franklin County, but she was happy to see her daughter’s safe return.\n\n“[The officer] said, ‘She looks clean, she doesn’t look like she hasn’t been eating, she looked comfortable,’” Bristol said. “It seems like she got pretty far. I’m not sure how that happened. She doesn’t really have those resources, but I’m just so relieved she’s OK.”\n\nThroughout the week that Cheyenne was missing, Greenfield Police led a series of search parties in hopes of finding the teenager, most recently on Sunday, at which time they deployed a K-9 unit.\n\nAlthough Dodge said the searches were unsuccessful, he confirmed early Monday morning that a K-9 unit “seemingly led” to Cheyenne’s boyfriend’s door. However, he noted that since she had been to her boyfriend’s house in the past, there was no indication that Cheyenne’s scent was left at the property recently.\n\n“Yesterday, we redeployed a search team down Hope Street, just to make sure she didn’t fall along the railroad tracks or things of that nature, and that came up with negative findings,” Dodge said on Monday morning.\n\nBristol said she’s grateful to both law enforcement and the broader community for their attention and support in the search for her daughter. She described Cheyenne as a “homebody” who does not leave for long without calling or texting her family.\n\n“Thank you so much to the community for all of their help and the Greenfield Police Department,” Bristol said. “Everybody has been so helpful and I am very relieved.”\n\nAnthony Cammalleri can be reached at acammalleri@recorder.com or 413-930-4429."
