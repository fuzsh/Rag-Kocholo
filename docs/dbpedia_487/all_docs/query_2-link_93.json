        "text": "Any degree or certificate program that can use Title IV funding within 72 credits is eligible. For example, you can go into nursing, culinary arts, etc. Your campus Guided Pathways advising office can help you choose.\n\nAt this time, this program is only available to full or part-time students (6+ credits) enrolling in an upcoming semester and who began college in Fall 2020 or later.\n\nIf you have a documented disability, we will work with you and your advisor to figure out the most credit hours that you'll be able to take for enrollment.\n\nIt depends on when you attended trade school. Trade and postsecondary schools count as prior enrollment, but you may be eligible if you did not attend prior to the Fall 2020 semester. We still encourage students to apply for admission as many other financial aid packages are available.\n\nNo. State law specifically excludes summer coursework from free tuition eligibility. However, CT State combines winter intersession and spring semester enrollment for financial aid purposes, so students may be eligible to receive a free tuition award for winter coursework.\n\nEligibility for this program is determined based on the eligibility criteria determined under Connecticut Public Act 19-117 and is expanded under Connecticut Public Act 23-204. Students who have lost the eligibility to participate have the right to an appeal. All appeals will be reviewed by the Appeals Committee, and decisions will be made in writing to the student with a copy of the decision kept on file with the attending Financial Aid office."
