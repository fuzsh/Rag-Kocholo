        "text": "Citing several challenges, Rider University officials confirmed it enacted a reduction in force last week. The moved affected a total of 31 non-faculty positions.\n\nThat includes 14 employees who were told that their positions had been eliminated. Three of those employees received offers for other positions at the Lawrenceville-based institution. The other 17 positions were currently vacant and permanently eliminated.\n\nSchool officials say the combination of actions will save Rider more than $2 million. They stressed making every effort to reduce vacancies as opposed to currently filled positions, while considering students and other impacts.\n\nA key challenge that Rider and other schools have faced pertains to an overhaul of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. The move has affected the admissions process for the coming year.\n\nIn late July, Centenary University announced it was freezing tuition because of FAFSA uncertainties.\n\n“These are difficult decisions to make and are only done after thoughtful consideration of other ways in which to reduce cost to help align the university’s revenue with expenses. Over the last several years, Rider has made significant progress toward its goal of achieving a break-even budget, and then a surplus budget,” a Rider spokesperson told NJBIZ. “But the challenges of the past year, especially related to the FAFSA challenges and enrollment implications, have necessitated the need to further reduce costs and plan for additional revenue enhancements.”\n\nRider AAUP responds\n\n“We are deeply troubled by the recent and recurring layoffs plaguing Rider University. Through no fault of their own, our staff colleagues have again been forced to bear the brunt of this administration’s mismanagement,” Quinn Cunningham, president, Rider AAUP, associate professor of management at the Norm Brodsky College of Business at Rider, told NJBIZ in a statement.\n\nCunningham added, “While external factors are cited, the evidence is clear: Rider University suffers from a decade of poor leadership. Multiple-year declines in enrollment, dwindling financial reserves, continual downgrading of our bond ratings, and the devastating downgrading of our renowned music school are undeniable symptoms of a failed university administration. It is imperative that we chart a new path forward under new leadership.”\n\nThe university did not immediately reply to NJBIZ with a response to the Rider AAUP statement.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated at 5:24 p.m. ET Aug. 6, 2024, with a statement from Rider AAUP.\n\nOther recent job cuts:"
