Click Here to learn how to prevent, report and stop EBT theft and fraud.\n\nWhat is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)?\n\nFormerly referred to as “food stamps,” the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) nutritional assistance initiative administered at the state level. In Tennessee, SNAP is managed by the Tennessee Department of Human Services (TDHS).\n\nSNAP can be viewed as a bridge to help Tennesseans reach their full potential as self-sufficient contributing members of our community and economy. At TDHS, we administer SNAP with the belief that you can focus on work, school, and family wellness when you’re well-nourished and don’t have to worry about where your next meal will come from. Excelling at your job, training or higher education can increase career prospects, earning potential, and levels of self-sufficiency. These opportunities can help your family transition from today’s challenges into a brighter future tomorrow.\n\nUse the menu and information on this page to learn more about SNAP application, eligibility, EBT cards, emergency programing, and other related topics.\n\nReplacement SNAP\n\nThere may be occasions when a power outage causes households to lose nutritional resources and Replacement SNAP is needed. To learn more about replacement SNAP and related supports as they are made available, click here.\n\nHow Does SNAP Work\n\nFollowing federal guidelines, SNAP functions by providing qualifying households with a grocery stipend for a set length of time called a certification period. During the certification period, benefits are distributed using an Electronic Benefit Card (EBT) Card. Similar to credit cards, EBT cards can be used at participating stores and online retailers to purchase groceries. The amount of SNAP granted and the SNAP certification period are based on a household’s resources and situation.\n\nWho Can Receive SNAP\n\nSNAP is available to households (individuals who live and prepare food together) that meet certain qualifications referred to as eligibility criteria. SNAP eligibility takes residency, age and relationship, citizenship, social security number assignment, employment, resource, income, and related deductions factors into consideration. These factors not only determine a household’s eligibility to receive SNAP but also determine if additional documents will be required for a household to maintain SNAP after SNAP approval. Failure to submit required documents such as change forms or Simplified Reporting Forms can result in the cancellation of SNAP benefits.\n\nClick Here to learn more about SNAP eligibility.\n\nWhere to Use SNAP\n\nSNAP can be used to buy food items at most grocery stores and some online retailers.\n\nClick Here to locate a retailer that accepts SNAP in your area or learn about using SNAP to purchase food online when you Click Here.\n\nFor information on what can be purchased with SNAP, Click Here to visit the USDA Eligible Food Items page.\n\nApplying for SNAP\n\nYou can apply for SNAP by completing and submitting a SNAP application online OR you may submit a printed application by uploading or mailing a printed application to TDHS.

These eligibility verification documents should include copies of record/document that show proof of the following:\n\nSocial Security Number (Example: Social Security Card)\n\nYour Identification (Example: driver’s license, school ID with photo, passport, resident alien card, I-94 card, voter’s registration card)\n\nWhere you live (Example: lease agreement, utility bill, phone bill, or driver’s license with your address on it)\n\nIncome (Example: check stubs, employer statement, award letters)\n\nResources (Example: bank statements, title, registration, or deed)\n\nShelter costs (Example: mortgage payments, property tax, homeowner’s insurance, rent receipt, lease agreement)\n\nCost of utilities (Example: electric bill, water bill, gas bill)\n\nIt’s best to have copies of these documents ready for submission when you apply for SNAP.
