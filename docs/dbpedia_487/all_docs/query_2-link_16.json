        "text": "The University of Bristol Faculty of Social Sciences and Law embodies a vibrant global community of world-class expertise in social sciences and law. We attract talented staff and students from around the world and have forged strong links with international organisations and research councils.The interdisciplinary nature of this stream allows students to focus on issues relating to inequality, unemployment, political ideology, the construction of identity and much more through sessions led by world-renowned Law, Sociology, Criminology, and Politics academics. Law is a major part of our everyday lives. Buying lunch, applying for a job, working for an employer, claiming benefit, driving a car, living in a property â€“ all these things are governed by law. Law also plays a role in things that are more remote from most of us: war, international trade, companies, banks, immigration, the environment, science, medicine and the armed forces. This makes law a fascinating subject to study with lots of different areas to investigate once the basic skills and knowledge have been learned. Studying law can be a good basis for a range of careers, including journalism, the civil service, accountancy and business, as well as for working in the legal profession."
