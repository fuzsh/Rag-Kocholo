        "text": "The modules available on the LLMs cover a wide range of legal disciplines, to cater for the diverse learning needs of students from the UK, Europe and around the world.\n\nPart of our comprehensive range of LLM programmes, the LLM in International Law offers you an opportunity to study the fundamentals of international law at an advanced level, linking theory to practice.\n\nYou will examine the key legal principles and rules underpinning the international legal system, and develop a contextual and critical understanding of key issues in contemporary international law. The depth and breadth of study will equip you well for working either in international law or international organisations.\n\nDiverse choice of modules\n\nPursuing an LLM allows you to focus in on a particular area of law by delving deep into the subject and undertaking independent research and learning. The modules available cover a diverse range of legal topics, making it possible to tailor the course towards the specific areas of law you wish to explore further.\n\nTeaching backed by the latest research\n\nThe School has a thriving research culture and most tutors on our LLMs are active researchers, publishing in leading journals. At the same time, the quality of teaching at Bristol Law School has been recognised by the Quality Assurance Agency as 'excellent'. You can therefore expect to participate in carefully-planned, lively and highly informative sessions designed to give you a deep and thorough grounding in your chosen area of law.\n\nFlexible study options\n\nThere are two intakes to the LLMs, one in September and one in January, and you can study with us full or part time.\n\nContent\n\nThe LLM in International Law consists of nine modules in total, including a dissertation of up to 15,000 words.\n\nThe option modules listed are those that are most likely to be available, but they may be subject to change.\n\nYear one\n\nCore modules\n\nInternational Law and Institutions (15 credits)\n\nResearch Methods (15 credits).\n\nOption modules\n\nYou can either choose five modules from this list, or four from this list plus one of the 15 credit option modules from any of the other LLM courses.\n\nContemporary Research Project (15 credits)\n\nCorporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility (15 credits)\n\nEuropean Environmental Policy and Law (15 credits)\n\nGlobalisation and the Law (15 credits)\n\nInternational Employment Law (15 credits)\n\nInternational Environmental Law (15 credits)\n\nInternational Human Rights Law (15 credits)\n\nInternational Humanitarian Law (15 credits)\n\nNatural Resources Law (15 credits)\n\nWorld Trade Organisation Law (15 credits).\n\nDissertation (60 credits):\n\nYou will need to write a 15,000 word dissertation. This needs to be an original piece of work. You can satisfy this requirement by:\n\ncarrying out empirical work that has not been done before\n\nsynthesising issues not put together before\n\nlooking at topics that have not been looked at before by people in the discipline\n\nexamining existing knowledge in an original way, or\n\nbringing new evidence to bear on an old issue.\n\nYou don't need to meet all of these criteria. Your dissertation topic must broadly relate to your LLM award.\n\nThis structure is for full-time students only. Part-time students study the same modules but the delivery pattern will be different.\n\nThe University continually enhances our offer by responding to feedback from our students and other stakeholders, ensuring the curriculum is kept up to date and our graduates are equipped with the knowledge and skills they need for the real world. This may result in changes to the course. If changes to your course are approved, we will inform you.\n\nLearning and Teaching\n\nThe flexible nature of the course allows you to study with us full or part time. The course involves both extensive independent research and discussion in the context of workshops, designed to encourage the development of your critical, analytical and reflective skills. You will be expected to prepare for each workshop and to participate actively in discussion with your tutors and peers.\n\nYou will also have access to course and module information through our online Blackboard system.\n\nFor more details see our glossary of teaching and learning terms.\n\nStudy time\n\nFull-time attendance\n\nThe full-time course takes one year, with approximately six to nine contact hours a week. However, as independent study is fundamental to the course, the total study time should be around 36 hours a week.\n\nPart-time attendance\n\nThe part-time route takes two years. You will usually have around four hours of contact with your tutors a week and you should spend between 12 and 18 hours a week studying independently.\n\nDedicated support\n\nYou will receive a high level of support both during your studies and after you have graduated. You will be allocated an LLM academic tutor to support you throughout the course. We also organise events to help you plan your career after the LLM.\n\nAssessment\n\nTaught modules on the LLM International Law course are assessed through a combination of written coursework assignments and oral presentations. The culmination of the course is a dissertation of up to 15,000 words, which constitutes an original contribution to the corpus of legal knowledge within an area of international law.\n\nFor more details see our full glossary of assessment terms.\n\nFieldwork\n\nPro Bono Unit\n\nYou'll have opportunities to engage in Pro Bono work through your LLM, volunteering your time to help the local community.\n\nSupervised by academics and practitioners, you'll work on cases and provide legal advice through projects such as Legal Advocacy Support Project, Elderlaw, the UWE Street Law Programme and Bristol Musicians Advice Service.\n\nStudy facilities\n\nBristol Law School has excellent, state-of-the-art facilities, including a dedicated LLM study room and mock law courtrooms, where you can put your learning into practice.\n\nThe Frenchay library offers students 24-hour access with computer room facilities, as well as a wide range of legal resources, including Hein Online, LexisNexis, Westlaw and iLaw. The library is well stocked with electronic and print books, newspapers, journals, government publications, statistics, encyclopaedias, dictionaries, company information, market reports and DVDs.\n\nA £50m project is also underway to build the new Faculty of Business and Law building, which will provide innovative teaching and learning spaces, including two showcase law courts.\n\nFind out more about the facilities and resources UWE has to offer.\n\nTake a Virtual Tour of the Law facilities and see what's on offer here for you.\n\nStudent representation\n\nWe have a student representation system, supported by UWE Bristol Students' Union. LLM student representatives are elected by LLM students to represent them, which means you will have the opportunity to raise any issues and help to shape the course by sharing your views.\n\nCareers / Further study\n\nStudying for an LLM provides an ideal opportunity to develop specialist skills that will be favoured by employers, both in the legal world and beyond. It opens up a range of career opportunities and gives our students the edge over other graduates.\n\nThe in-depth knowledge you will acquire in a particular area of law will give you a thorough grounding in the subject area and raise your employability prospects, enabling you to become a specialist within your organisation. It is for this reason that many of our LLM graduates choose to go on to complete a PhD or go into teaching and research.\n\nGiven the increasingly transnational nature of law, this course is designed to provide you with knowledge and skills which will be attractive to employers both in the UK and beyond. Recent graduates from Bristol Law School have gained positions in local government, solicitors firms, the Ministry of Defence and other organisations including Marks and Spencer plc, Direct Line and Lloyds TSB.\n\nOur award-winning careers service helps you develop your employment potential through career coaching, a vacancy service for internships, placements, jobs, global opportunities, volunteering and community activity plus support for entrepreneurial activity, and access to employer events.\n\nEntry requirements\n\nYou should have:\n\nAn honours degree of 2:2 or above in Law; or\n\nAn honours degree of 2:2 or above plus a Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) or the Common Professional Examination (CPE); or\n\nAn honours degree of 2:2 or above in a related subject (such as business, politics or international relations) and/or relevant experience: please give full details in your application.\n\nIf you do not meet the above requirements, but have relevant work experience and/or can demonstrate appropriate subject knowledge, we will assess your application on an individual basis.\n\nPersonal Statement\n\nYou are required to complete a personal statement for this course. Please read the personal statement guidance carefully and make sure that you answer the questions on the postgraduate application form within the personal statement tabs, keeping to the advised word count.\n\nUWE-Münster Referral Scheme\n\nMünster students should have completed the First State Exam (FSE) and the FFA (English).*\n\nStudents admitted under this scheme are exempted three modules by virtue of their prior studies and are offered a flexible pathway studying for a part or the whole of an academic year in Bristol.*\n\nMost students choose to study in Bristol in semester one (September only), taking four modules and returning to Münster for semester two.\n\nThe Research Methods module in semester two is compulsory and must be studied. This can be done at Bristol or if the student chooses to return to Münster, they can continue to study this module there with online support provided by UWE Bristol.\n\nStudents can complete their dissertation over the summer (they are not required to be in Bristol to do this). Supervision can take place online via video and email.\n\n*Where students have not completed the FFA (English), they may still gain entry to the LLM. However, in these circumstances, students will need to undertake the full complement of eight modules plus their dissertation and will need to spend one full year in the UK. Students taking this approach may join the programme in either September or January.\n\nUWE Bristol's International College\n\nInternational students who do not meet the academic or English language requirements to study this course can qualify by completing preparatory study at our International College.\n\nEnglish language support\n\nIf you meet the academic requirements but require additional support to take your language skills to the required level, you may be able to attend one of our pre-sessional English courses. Students who successfully complete the pre-sessional course can progress onto their chosen degree course without retaking an IELTS or equivalent.\n\nRead more about our Pre-Sessional English Programme.\n\nEnglish Language Requirement\n\nIf English is not your first language, you will also need to demonstrate your English Language proficiency. You should have:\n\nIELTS 6.5 overall with a minimum of 5.5 in all components\n\nSee further details of our English Language requirements.\n\nHow to apply\n\nPlease apply online. Applications for the LLM course may be submitted at any time of year and the deadline for applications is 1 September for study commencing in September that same academic year, or by 1 January for study commencing in January that same academic year.\n\nRead more about international applications and key international deadline dates.\n\nFor further information\n\nEmail: Admissions@uwe.ac.uk\n\nTelephone: +44 (0)117 32 83333"
