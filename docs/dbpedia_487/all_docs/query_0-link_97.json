        "text": "The Puritans and education\n\nDissatisfied with the traditional grammar schools and universities, the Puritans drew up 'a comprehensive range of school, college, and academy proposals in which the sciences and technology increasingly took precedence over linguistic subjects' (Webster 1975:207). These proposals 'caused considerable offence to the academic establishment and were treated as a form of subversive criticism' (Webster 1975:207).\n\nInterest in education was not limited to the Puritans, however. There was much lively debate and London became a centre of interest in all things educational:\n\nLondoners grew accustomed to discussing anything and everything and there was a growing demand for reading-matter. While the provincial towns remained under the tutelage of the gentry, country gentlemen themselves were largely dependent on London for books and in London it was the bourgeoisie that set the tone (Simon 1966:385).\n\nDuring Elizabeth's reign the Inns of Court had often been thought of as a university, but in the early seventeenth century George Buck (c1560-1622) argued that it was the City of London itself that deserved the title 'The Third University of England' (Simon 1966:388). All the arts and sciences were now being taught, 'not in an academy confined to gentlemen, nor within four walls, but in the city at large and in some branches very much open to citizens' (Simon 1966:389-90). There were groups concerned with promoting research and publishing their findings, and this led to the 'development of a scientific attitude' (Simon 1966:390).\n\nFor some, education was about practicalities. London merchants were interested in the study of languages, mathematics and astronomy, geography and mapmaking. The great overseas trading companies were 'the main employers of mathematicians and the first practising scientists' (Simon 1966:387).\n\nBut for the Puritans, education was important because they wanted the Bible to be read as widely as possible so that people would be ready for the 'Great Instauration'.\n\nThey had invested in schools since around the 1560s, but their influence came to a head during the revolution of the 1640s and 1650s. During these two decades, 'militant puritanism swept away the monarchy, the House of Lords and the bishops' (Lawson and Silver 1973:153), and the country was governed by a puritan parliament, the army and the Lord Protector. Education, along with religion and politics, was 'endlessly debated and reforming ideas circulated as never before' (Lawson and Silver 1973:153).\n\nThe abolition of the Court of Star Chamber in 1640 allowed the propagation of anti-establishment views and led to a flood of pamphlets and tracts. The inspiration for many of these came from Francis Bacon, who had\n\nhelped to undermine the respect paid to authority and custom by assailing traditional Aristotelian scholasticism and urging close observation of the actual world by experiment and induction (Lawson and Silver 1973:153).\n\nThe reforming ideas of Comenius, who visited England in 1641, were also influential. One of the puritans who invited him was Samuel Hartlib, the Polish-born merchant and philanthropist, who became 'the chief disseminator of Comenian ideas in England' (Lawson and Silver 1973:154).\n\nComenius believed that the end of education is the comprehension of all nature ('pansophia') through reason, the senses and revelation, and that education should be extended to everybody through a system of graded schools in all towns and villages, using reformed teaching methods and textbooks (Lawson and Silver 1973:154).\n\nIn their many publications between 1640 and 1660, the puritans expressed their discontent with the existing provision of education and put forward proposals for reform. The best-known - 'and least original' (Lawson and Silver 1973:154) - of these publications was Milton's tract Of Education, written at Hartlib's suggestion and published in 1644.\n\nMost of the puritan reformers - including Hartlib and his associate John Dury - were themselves products of the school and university system which they now criticised, and some had also been schoolmasters or dons. But there were other more radical critics who appear to have had little formal education. These included Gerrard Winstanley, a tradesman who became leader of the 'Diggers', and Richard Overton and William Walwyn - 'discontented younger sons of middle-class families whose schooling had ended with apprenticeship' (Lawson and Silver 1973:154) - who led the 'Levellers'.\n\nUniversal education\n\nAlthough the puritans were anxious to reform society as a whole, their most notable proposals were for a compulsory, free and universal state educational system.\n\nIn one form or another these were advanced not only by utopian visionaries like Winstanley and extreme democrats like Overton, but also by Hartlib and Dury and their associates, influential and well-established men such as the London merchant Henry Robinson, William Dell, master of Caius College, and William Petty, the economist (Lawson and Silver 1973:154).\n\nThe Levellers demanded sufficient free schools to ensure universal literacy, and Petty proposed a system of Ergastula literaria, or 'literary work-houses' for all children aged seven and above, so that no one should be excluded from education because of poverty or class, 'for hereby it hath come to pass that many are now holding the plough, which might have been fit to steer the state' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:155).\n\nGerrard Winstanley urged district administrations to attend to the education and vocational training of all children, and Henry Robinson petitioned for the establishment of a state system of schools to provide free education for all boys and girls. He also insisted that 'the nation's maritime obligations rendered it essential that all children should be taught to swim' (Webster 1975:211).\n\nIn 1653 a blueprint for a national educational system was presented to the Committee for the Advancement of Learning. Based on work by Hartlib - who saw himself as the official parliamentary agent for educational affairs - and Dury, it set out plans for 'a complete system of education, embracing research, teacher training, inspection, schools and workhouses for all social classes and both sexes' (Webster 1975:210). Its highest priority was for the establishment of Common Schools and Mechanical Schools to serve the educational needs of the lower classes.\n\nPetty and Dury also proposed the setting up of 'Noble Schools'. The idea was to narrow the educational gap between the upper and lower classes. The Noble Schools were to build on the Vernacular School foundation, 'developing each subject to a higher level and introducing a wider range of topics in the greater time available for studies' (Webster 1975:213). They would also be expected to parallel the Mechanical Schools in providing appropriate vocational training for older pupils, replacing a university education.\n\nThe proposed curriculum of the Noble Schools was non-humanistic; its content was 'determined according to the puritan social ethic' and its methods were 'consistent with the new psychological theories of learning' (Webster 1975:216).\n\nHowever, the plan for Noble Schools faced a considerable challenge:\n\nWhereas the proposals for Common and Mechanical Schools were directed to parliament, as the agency required to finance educational expansion, the plans for Noble Schools were primarily addressed to the educated public. Great skill would have been required to convince this audience to abandon its customary educational habits, to embrace institutions having little in common with grammar schools or universities and employing a pedagogy suited equally to the needs of the lower classes (Webster 1975:213-4).\n\nCurriculum\n\nWith regard to the content of elementary education, puritan reformers 'followed tradition in designating reading, writing and arithmetic as the first requirements for Common Schools' (Webster 1975:211). The curriculum was also to include 'a description of the natural world, the history of civilisation and Christianity, elementary rules of reasoning, the principles of natural justice and the constitutional history of England' (Webster 1975:211).\n\nPuritans criticised the traditional curriculum and teaching methods of the grammar schools and universities as being too concerned with words. They wanted education to be about the real world. Thus the schoolmaster George Snell, who dedicated to Dury and Hartlib his book The Right Teaching of Useful Knowledge, to fit scholars for some honest profession (1649), wrote:\n\nOur English youths may no longer be taught to be empty nominalists and verbalists only and to have no knowledge of the necessary things and matters ... but ... be realists and materialists, to know the very things and matters themselves (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:155).\n\nOthers called for more mathematical and scientific studies in the universities, and for more technical and vocational training for trades and agriculture.\n\nPedagogy\n\nComenius and his followers argued the importance of sensory perception in the education of young children. In his book A Child's Patrimony, Hezekiah Woodward argued that 'Nothing comes into the understanding in a natural way but through the door of the senses' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:156). In 1658 Comenius produced the first illustrated school book, the Orbis Sensualium Pictus, an English version of which was published a year later by Charles Hoole, who also recommended 'game-like visual aids of various kinds for teaching reading in the petty school' (Lawson and Silver 1973:156).\n\nPunishment\n\nThe Comenians were also concerned about the brutality of punishment in schools. Thomas Grantham, who ran a private school in the City of London, deplored\n\nthe misery that youth groans under in common schools, their pains great, the severity of the master intolerable, schools more like Bridewell than seminaries of learning (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:156).\n\nAnd George Snell declared that\n\nSlavish correction with the whip breedeth in the corrected a base and abject spirit, a foul Bridewell face, bitter passions, a dogged ungentle disposition, a very hatred against the school, the teacher, and against learning, which hatred being once rooted is seldom afterwards removed from the heart (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:156-7).\n\nTeacher training\n\nSuch complaints led puritans to demand better teachers. In 1648 William Petty argued that 'the business of education be not, as now, committed to the worst and unworthiest of men; but that it be seriously studied and practised by the best and ablest persons (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:157).\n\nSimilarly, George Snell argued that\n\nThough the unworthiness of many presuming to teach hath cast some aspersion upon the profession, yet without doubt they who set the foundation stones of all godliness, morality, literature and language ought for estimation to hold the next place of dignity to the best ministers of the Divine Word (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:157).\n\nPuritan educational literature emphasised the complementary relationship of the minister and the teacher, a partnership which required greater parity of status. In order to achieve this, the reformers aimed to improve the quality and status of schoolmasters by providing teacher-training colleges.\n\nIn 1649 Cromwell's physician, John Bathurst, told Hartlib of his proposals for a training college similar to a university college, to be financed from local taxes. It was to serve as 'an Inspector and Seminarie of all schoolmasters of all free-schooles throughout the kingdome' (quoted in Webster 1975:216-7).\n\nAnd Joshua Rawlin, a teacher from Kent, proposed that each county should have a committee of ministers to appoint grammar-school teachers, with approval given only to those able to teach according to the methods of Comenius.\n\nConclusions\n\nLawson and Silver argue that 'In some respects these two decades were propitious for large-scale educational advance' (Lawson and Silver 1973:157). Conservative voices were (at least temporarily) silenced and there was open discussion of new ideas of democracy and equality. There were calls for the reform of parliament, for all men to have the vote, and for the abolition of a variety of privileges; while in the New Model Army, promotion was based partly on merit and not just on social class.\n\n'Some expansion of educational opportunity might well have been expected in this new and unprecedented climate of liberal opinion' (Lawson and Silver 1973:157). And indeed the Long Parliament, which contained a large number of well-educated men, did carry out many reforms and seems to have been concerned about education. Thus free schools and colleges were regularly exempted from rate assessment, and funds from sequestrated royalist lands and church estates were partly used for educational purposes.\n\nHowever, while parliament was 'mildly sympathetic' to many of the Puritans' proposals, a succession of committees 'produced no coherent national educational policy' (Webster 1975:208).\n\nProgress was also hindered by the civil wars and several bad harvests, which damaged the economy and prevented action from matching good intentions. Teachers went off to fight or to serve as surgeons or chaplains, while others were removed from their posts for refusing to support the new Commonwealth; school buildings were damaged (as at Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Pontefract) or completely destroyed (as at York and Scarborough); schoolmasters' incomes fell as endowments declined in value, so some abandoned teaching and their posts were hard to fill; rents due to schools went unpaid; the abolition of the episcopacy removed the patronage and supervision of the diocesan bishops; and the instability discouraged philanthropic investment in education.\n\nIn these difficult conditions, then, it is hardly surprising that 'the assistance provided by the state fell short of the reformers' hopes' (Lawson and Silver 1973:158).\n\nKey figures\n\nFrancis Bacon (1561-1626)\n\nThe philosopher and scientist Francis Bacon - 'the herald of modernity' (Greaves 1969:27) - is often regarded as the father of empiricism. He put forward a number of ideas for reforming education.\n\nLearning, he argued, must concern itself with utility and action. He asked why the colleges of Europe were concerned solely with preparation for the professions - law, theology, and medicine - rather than with the study of the arts and sciences. Both, he argued, were essential. 'The practice of universities largely limiting themselves to the training of lawyers, theologians, and medical doctors was inimical to the advancement of the sciences and harmful to states and governments (Greaves 1969:27).\n\nHe argued for the setting up of 'a most perfect and general library':\n\nThe creation of a spacious garden, with every plant and herb, a zoo for rare animals and birds, lakes for fish, to provide in a small compass 'a model of universal nature made private'. A museum of natural science and mechanical arts, 'wherein whatsoever the hand of man by exquisite art or engine hath made rare in stuff, form or motion' might be collected together and classified. A centre for experimental research - 'a still-house so furnished with mills, instruments, furnaces and vessels, as may be a palace fit for a philosopher's stone' (Simon 1966:392).\n\nBacon was concerned to draw a clear distinction between reason and revelation. He developed a rational humanist outlook 'in the best Protestant tradition ... His philosophy inspired a new body of reformers who advanced practicable plans for recasting education in the light of new social needs and developments in knowledge' (Simon 1966:396).\n\nO'Day suggests that while the ideas of the French humanist Petrus Ramus had been 'all but defeated even in Cambridge by the early seventeenth century', the works of Francis Bacon 'kept alive a strong current of interest in realist, utilitarian education' (O'Day 1982:261).\n\nHis writings had a considerable influence upon products of the universities in both a direct and an indirect fashion. During the 1620s and 30s his Utopian proposals and suggestions that learning should be advanced in the interests of the common weal appealed to many of the more radical Protestants (O'Day 1982:261).\n\nIn The Advancement of Learning (1605), Bacon criticised humanists such as Sturm and Ascham for their 'excessive admiration for classical authors' and their 'taste for elaborate preaching' (Webster 1975:105). He advocated a balanced education which combined contemplation with action and involved the first-hand study of Nature.\n\nBacon had recognised the weakness of humanistic philosophy and education. His system embraced an epistemology consonant with new ideas on child psychology, a methodology suited to the theory of precognition, and a view of the social role of knowledge consistent with the puritan advocation of an active life. Bacon's experimental philosophy accordingly provided an ideal context for the puritan view of childhood (Webster 1975:107).\n\nJohn Comenius (1592-1670)\n\nJohn Amos Comenius (pictured - from the portrait by Rembrandt), a Czech teacher and scientist, was one of the earliest champions of universal education, a concept he developed in his 1632 book Didactica magna, in which he urged teachers and learners to leave divisive sects and unite in common institutions of learning.\n\nHe went on to develop the idea of human learning as a progression from youth to maturity and from elementary to advanced knowledge. 'Nothing should be taught to the young', he wrote, 'unless it is not only permitted, but actually demanded by their age and mental strength' (Comenius 1632). 'These three elements of commonality, community and progression have characterised most education systems developed since' (Benn and Chitty 1996:1).\n\nComenius stressed the educational importance of the first six years of a child's life and developed the idea of teaching children of five or six 'without any tediousnesse to reade and write, as it were in a continuall course of play and pastime' (quoted in Hadow 1933:24).\n\nIn 1640, the House of Commons invited Comenius to England to establish and participate in an agency for the promotion of learning. It was intended that by-products of this would be the publication of 'universal' books and the setting up of schools for boys and girls.\n\nComenius was impressed by London's crowded churches and the fact that\n\nA large number of the men and youths copy out the sermons with their pens ... they discovered an art which has now come into vogue even among the country folk, that of rapid script which they call stenography ... Almost all of them acquire this art of rapid writing, as soon as they have learnt at school to read the scriptures in the vernacular. It takes them about another year to learn the art of shorthand (quoted in Simon 1966:385).\n\nHe also noted that\n\nThey have an enormous number of books on all subjects in their own language ... There are truly not more bookstalls in Frankfurt at the time of the fair than there are here every day (quoted in Simon 1966:385).\n\nWhen civil war broke out in 1642 Comenius left England, but plans for the publication of books and the setting up of schools were furthered by Samuel Hartlib with the backing of Oliver Cromwell.\n\nComenius's call for universal education was echoed by Hartlib and his associates Dury, Milton and Hall, while 'even more radical criticisms came from the army chaplains Dell, Webster and Pinnel' (Webster 1975:114). Plans were advanced for workhouses, elementary schools, agricultural colleges and academies, to be open to both sexes and all social classes. 'These were an open demonstration of the means by which the precepts of Bacon and Comenius could be translated into social action' (Webster 1975:114).\n\nSamuel Hartlib (c1600-1662)\n\nAs a young man Samuel Hartlib moved from his native Poland to England. He studied at Cambridge where he came into contact with Baconian ideas. From 1638\n\nhe threw himself into works of charity, collected money for Protestant refugees from Poland, Bohemia, and the Palatinate, set up a short-lived school, on Baconian principles, at Chichester, and finally, in 1630, moved to London and lived permanently in Duke's Place, Holborn (Trevor-Roper 1960 quoted in Greaves 1969:31).\n\nHartlib was a key figure in educational thinking during the Commonwealth, as Bacon had been in the preceding period:\n\nthe advocacy of reforms in the aims and scope and in the methods of education was made urgent in England as it had never been before, mainly in the direction of wider scope of curriculum and realism in treatment, through appeal to sense-perception, in the writings of the three great educational leaders: John Amos Comenius, Samuel Hartlib, and John Dury (Watson 1921a:1528).\n\nIn his Ephemerides (miscellaneous jottings written between 1634 and 1660), Hartlib frequently mentions Comenius and other philosophers:\n\nThese 3 (Pell, Fundanius, Comenius) are very fit to bee imploied about the Reformation of Learning. The one urges mainly a perfect enumeration of all things. The other is all for that which hase an evident use in vita humana. The third is all for methodizing and contracting cutting of all verbosities and impertinencies whatsoever. These three being all reduced into one must needes make up a compleat direction (Hartlib 1639).\n\nHartlib was fascinated with the idea of developing a 'pansophy' - an encyclopaedia embracing the whole of human knowledge - and promulgated some surprisingly modern ideas: 'A great fault in teaching [is] that children are not made to learne themselves but are always taught' (Hartlib 1639).\n\nOthers associated with Hartlib included Cyprian Kinner, who urged the desirability of a school collection of living animals; George Snell, who advocated training colleges for teachers; Hezekiah Woodward, who wanted children to be taught natural science; John Hall, who urged the universities to undertake research work in science; Samuel Harmar, who put forward schemes for the education of the poor; John Evelyn, who had 'the eye of the educational connoisseur' (Watson 1921a:1528); Sir Henry Wotton, who made suggestions based on his practical experience of diplomacy; William Petty, who advocated equipping colleges and schools with aids for scientific and technical training; and the poet John Milton.\n\nBut it was Hartlib, Comenius and John Dury who were 'the philosophers of the English opposition party and the articulators of Baconian reform' (Greaves 1969:31).\n\nJohn Dury (1596-1680)\n\nJohn Dury was a Scottish Calvinist minister who had been brought up in the Netherlands, where he had met Samuel Hartlib.\n\nFor Dury, 'the teacher was involved in a divine rather than secular mission' (Webster 1975:101). He called for reform of both schools and universities, acknowledging that this would not be easy because those who\n\nare habituated to a custome of their owne, and thinke themselves to be Doctors and Masters of Sciences, are not easily brought by the sight of any booke, though never so well penned, to alter their course of teaching (quoted in Greaves 1969:33).\n\nHe saw education as the preparation of\n\nevery one for the industrie and employment in the society of men, whereunto by reason of his birth, he may have a right, or by reason of his naturall parts he may by others be called, or of his own accord lawfully apply himself (quoted in Greaves 1969:33).\n\nStudents, he said, should not be made to 'learn by heart the General Rules, sentences, and Precepts of Arts, before they are furnished with any matter whereunto to apply those Rules and Precepts', because such teaching would lead them into 'a Maze of subtile and unprofitable Notions; whereby their mindes are puft up with a windy conceit of knowledge ... for their heads are filled with certain terrnes and empty shewes of learning' (quoted in Greaves 1969:33).\n\nTeaching should be based as far as possible on sensual perception rather than on tradition or reason and should build on prior knowledge. Subjects should be taught 'practically first and then theoretically' (Greaves 1969:33). Instruction in logic and metaphysics should come at the end of the academic programme 'because of their reliance on pure reason rather than sense perception' (Greaves 1969:34).\n\nDury urged the setting up of a public agency for universal learning to coordinate the work of the universities and the schools; a college for the teaching of oriental languages; and professorships of practical divinity.\n\nHe published several books, including The Reformed School in 1650 and Some Proposals towards the Advancement of Learning in 1653.\n\nIn The Reformed School he envisaged 'universities which would produce socially useful graduates' (O'Day 1982:265), and he argued that nothing should be taught unless it was useful to society. The book 'undoubtedly appealed to the university critics and advocates of educational expansion' (Webster 1975:217), and its main principles were reiterated in Some Proposals.\n\nThe Reformed School became a leading influence on puritan educational thought and its effect was apparent on many college proposals which emerged from a variety of sources during the 1650s. These ranged from schemes for technical and agricultural colleges to ambitious plans for new universities (Webster 1975:217).\n\nDury's Baconian concern for the application of knowledge to practical problems was shared by William Petty.\n\nWilliam Petty (1623-1687)\n\nWilliam Petty learned Latin and some Greek at school, was apprenticed to a sea captain at the age of 12, became a merchant at 15 and then joined the navy. When civil war broke out in 1643 he pursued his studies, especially in medicine, at Utrecht, Leyden, Amsterdam and Paris.\n\nIn 1649 he became a doctor of physic and Fellow of Brasenose College Oxford, where the newly-formed group of Oxford philosophers often met at his lodgings. Within a year he had been appointed instructor in anatomy at Oxford and Professor of Music at Gresham College London, holding the two posts concurrently. In 1652 he was given leave to join Oliver Cromwell's army in Ireland as physician-general. Ten years later he was a founder member of the Royal Society.\n\nFoster Watson argues that, because of Petty's 'wide outlook and skilled interests, his views on education have special value' (Watson 1921b:1278). They are contained in his 'Advice to Mr. Samuel Hartlib' on the Advancement of some Particular Parts of Learning.\n\nHe is a convinced Baconian, and endeavours to apply Bacon's realism to school conditions. He deliberately excluded the classics, and even Latin grammar, from the curriculum of the ordinary child. All children, from the highest to the lowest classes, should be taught some 'genteel manufacture' in trade or technical schools, ergastula literaria (i.e. a literary house-of-work), where children should be taught to do something for their living, as well as learn to read and write, and the elements of arithmetic, geometry, and useful arts. He proposes that the old hospitals should be converted into a Nosocomium Academicum, with house, garden, library, chemical laboratory, anatomical theatre, apotheca, and all necessary apparatus (Watson 1921b:1278).\n\nTeaching, Petty argued, should be realistic, and include observation, experiment, and demonstration (Watson 1921b:1279).\n\nHe agreed with the views of Roger Ascham and Comenius regarding the importance of a suitable education for young children - especially the use of play. While he was with Cromwell's army in Ireland, he wrote:\n\nWe see Children do delight in Drums, Pipes, Fiddles, Guns made of Elder sticks, and bellowes noses, piped Keys, etc., painting Flags and Ensigns with Elder-berries and Corn poppy, making ships with Paper, and setting even Nut-shells a swimming, handling the tooles of workmen as soon as they turne their backs, and trying to worke themselves (quoted in The Harleian Miscellany, a collection of material from the library of the Earl of Oxford collated and edited by Samuel Johnson and William Oldys between 1744 and 1753).\n\nPetty is also known for his economic theories and his methods of 'political arithmetic', and for promoting the philosophy of 'laissez-faire' in relation to government.\n\nJohn Milton (1608-1674)\n\nJohn Milton committed himself to 'the reforming of Education ... the want whereof this nation perishes' (quoted in Greaves 1969:40), but he was moderate in his views and proposed an educational plan which was 'less of a reform than a reordering of the existing system' (Greaves 1969:40). It was aimed principally at preparing the sons of the nobility and the gentry for political leadership.\n\nIn his tract Of Education, published in 1644 and addressed to Samuel Hartlib, Milton attempted to 'fuse the ideals of classical humanism with the principles of Puritanism without losing sight of the utilitarian ideal' (Greaves 1969:40). The traditional subjects - including the study of Latin and Greek - were kept, and experimental science was added, though 'he did not recommend any scholarly works or theories to his readers as he did in more traditional areas' (Greaves 1969:41).\n\nHe argued that 'Language is but the instrument conveying to us things useful to be known' (quoted in Newbolt 1921:35). Latin and Greek must be learnt first, then the 'things useful to be known' must be studied through Latin and Greek authors. He was critical of the school teaching of the day, describing it as 'those Grammatick flats and shallows' (quoted in Newbolt 1921:36).\n\nDuring the civil war, he declared that the only education worth having was one which made men 'magnanimous'. It would include learning about the past, knowledge of the present, and a desire to train pupils so that they might be 'worthy patriots dear to God and famous to all ages' (quoted in Watson 1921a:1528).\n\nIn his anti-monarchy tract The Ready and Easy Way to Establish a Free Commonwealth (1660), he urged the establishment of schools and academies, 'wherein children should be bred up in all liberal arts and sciences' (quoted in Watson 1921a:1528), as well as in grammar. His encyclopaedic ideal was also the aim of the proposed academies of Edmund Boulton (1620), Francis Kynaston, Balthazar Gerbier (1648), and Lewis Maidwell (1700).\n\nMilton was conservative in his approach to education, though his conservatism accepted some change. His approach was probably typical of what other Puritans would have accepted. Differences undoubtedly would have existed, but Milton's plan of reform, retaining the traditional subjects and gradually integrating the experimental sciences with them, serves as an example of a fairly typical Puritan approach to education. The utilitarian criterion was present but not dominant (Greaves 1969:41).\n\nJohn Dury's wife, Dorothy, was closely associated with Milton. Her patron (and Milton's) was her relative Katherine Boyle, sister of Robert Boyle, who was also heavily committed to educational reform. Without the backing of Katherine, Milton might well have been imprisoned or executed at the Restoration.\n\nCharles Hoole (1610-1667)\n\nThe nature of the 'Grammatick flats and shallows', which Milton had said characterised the teaching of language, was described by Charles Hoole in his Art of Teaching School, written for Rotherham School and published in 1660:\n\nThe general course taken in teaching the rules of the genders and nouns and conjugating verbs is, to make children patter them over by heart, and sometimes also to construe and parse them; but seldom or never are they taught the meaning of a rule, or how to make it apply readily to the words they meet with elsewhere (quoted in Newbolt 1921:36).\n\nHoole approved of children learning Latin - but not until they had mastered English. 'For learning to read English perfectly', he wrote, 'I allow two or three years' time, so that at seven or eight years of age a child may begin Latin' (quoted in Newbolt 1921:36).\n\nBut Hoole is mainly remarkable for his surprisingly modern child-centred approach to education. He emphasises, for example, the importance of 'the observing of children with a view of helping their \"imperfections\"' (Watson 1901:526):\n\nHe does not indeed reach to the modern position that every stage of growth in life has a perfection which is appropriate and adequate to itself, but he does see (and herein consists the greatness of Hoole) that in the work of teaching it is the pupil who is the end to be considered. The teacher is the means to the promotion of the good of the child. The child is never to be regarded as merely a means to the teacher's good (Watson 1901:526).\n\nAlthough Hoole was not the first to write about teaching English to children - Edmund Coote had done so in 1590 - his Petty School (1660) 'may be described as the first pedagogical treatise on the teaching of very little children in anything like a modern spirit' (Watson 1901:527).\n\nThe petty schools of Hoole's time were frequently run by 'poor women or other necessitous persons' (Watson 1901:530). Hoole argues that this situation should not be allowed to continue, and suggests that the rich should provide endowments so that good teachers could be attracted. They should be paid a stipend of at least £20 a year, have suitable accommodation and receive fees from parents who could afford to pay. In this situation, 'the master might be expected to take all such poor boys as could conveniently attend the schools free of cost' (Watson 1901:530).\n\nAs to the qualifications of a petty school master, Hoole says:\n\nI would have him to be a person of a pious, sober, comely, and discreet behaviour, and tenderly affectionate towards children, having some knowledge of the Latin tongue, and ability to write a fair hand, and good skill in arithmetic, and then let him move within the compass of his own orb, so as to teach all his scholars (as they become capable) to read English very well, and afterwards to write and cast accounts. And let him not at all meddle with teaching the accidence [elements of grammar], except only to some more pregnant wits, which are intended to be set forwards to learn Latin, and for such be sure that he ground them well, or else dismiss them as soon as they can read distinctly and write legibly, to the Grammar School (quoted in (Watson 1901:530).\n\nWatson argues that Hoole's Petty School is 'the first adumbration of a modern elementary school scheme' (Watson 1901:530).\n\nJames Harrington (1611-1677)\n\nEqually remarkable were the views of English politician and essayist James Harrington. In The Commonwealth of Oceana, published in 1656, he advocated free, compulsory, state-directed universal education. He argued that the revenues of bishops, deans and chapters should be confiscated and devoted to the 'advancement of learning and piety' (quoted in Watson 1921a:1528).\n\nGerrard Winstanley (1609-1676)\n\nGerrard Winstanley had been an unsuccessful cloth merchant in London, then a corn chandler in Surrey. In the late 1640s he had prophetic visions which led him to 'identify the Fall with economic, political, legal and educational monopolies and to establish agricultural communes which would restore men to their Edenic state of perfection' (McDowell 2003:14)."
