        "text": "Bristol is known to be one of the more expensive cities to live in in the UK. Home to two popular universities, the city's population is ever-growing.\n\nIn fact, in recent years, University of Bristol students have been forced to live outside of Bristol in neighbouring Newport and Bath due to housing supply not meeting demand. With a rising student population, more accommodation is being made available for students, with 'Metal Works' opening in Bedminster this September and work beginning on the new 'Marsh Mills' accommodation near Temple Meads.\n\nAccording to June 2024's figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Bristol is the most expensive city to rent in outside of London, with an average monthly rental price of £1,765. This is more expensive than several areas of London, such as Barnet (£1,744), Hounslow (£1,700) and Lewisham (£1,658).\n\nRead more:\n\nDerelict pub Rhubarb Tavern flats plans approved\n\nChallenges with ‘extremely unpopular’ plan for new bus lanes between Bristol and Bath\n\nI graduated from the University of Bristol in 2023 and in my final year I was spending £700 a month, excluding bills, for a room in a house in Cotham. With the current minimum maintenance loan of £4,767, a student paying this rent would only be able to cover half of a year's tenancy with the government loan, which is why many students turn to financial support from the university and part-time work to try to cover these funding gaps.\n\nBefore moving to Bristol I was unsure how much living would really cost. The purpose of this article is to offer an honest insight into the cost of day-to-day life as a recent graduate.\n\nHaving moved to the outskirts of Bristol due to sky-rocketing rent in the city centre, I share a two-bedroom house with a garden with one other person. We split the rent of £1,200 in half, which means with bills on top, I am spending a similar amount on a house to what I spent on a room as a student.\n\nI have calculated my weekly spend as a twenty-something living in Bristol. I have divided my half of rent and bills into four to give a weekly average, and have also included my half of the cost of the weekly shop and every other purchase I made between Monday July 15 and Monday July 22.\n\nMy total living cost of a week in Bristol was £285.86. Here is the breakdown:\n\nEssential costs\n\nRent: £600/4= £150\n\nGas and electric: £30/4= £7.50\n\nWater: £18/4= £4.50\n\nWiFi: £15/4= £3.75\n\nWeekly food shop: £19.80\n\nBus tickets: £16\n\nNon-essential costs\n\nAdditional travel costs: £17\n\nEvening drinks: £29.49\n\nSupermarket top up: £21.45\n\nPet supplies: £6.50\n\nThis list provides an accurate depiction of my cost of living in Bristol. My 'non-essential' spending costs, such as Gia the hamster and meeting friends would most likely not be possible if I lived closer to the city centre.\n\nUniversity students risk being isolated if they live further afield\n\nFor students, living further out means more of their time is spent travelling to lectures, as well as isolating them socially. University of Bristol students living in university accommodation receive a free U1 bus pass for the year, though it is unclear whether new accommodations, such as Metal Works, will be added to the bus routes.\n\nThe university also outlines on its website that the average cost of renting a one bedroom flat is £1,300 and that \"the closer you live to the University the higher the cost will be.\" Unfortunately, after many students deferred during the coronavirus pandemic, the number of students increased whilst the amount of accommodation available remained the same: something that will hopefully be remedied by new accommodation being built.\n\nA University of Bristol spokesperson said: “Bristol is a fantastic city that is attracting increasing numbers of people – students and non-students alike. Our students have always been part of Bristol’s rich culture. They work and volunteer and many stay in the city after they graduate, starting businesses and families.\n\n“The current funding mechanisms for higher education make it extremely challenging for any University to stand still without going backward. For most universities, a modest increase in student numbers is the only viable option to bridge funding shortfalls, continue supporting a more prosperous and dynamic local economy, and deliver our academic programmes. As the university grows, so does our local economic footprint. Based on the projected growth, forecasts by Oxford Economics gives an estimated contribution to regional GDP of £1.1 billion by 2029/30 (in 2021 prices), with some 15,200 jobs supported across the city-region.\n\n“For most students, accommodation will be one of their biggest expenses which is why we provide a wide variety of options to suit specific requirements and budgets. We are also aware that Bristol is an expensive place to live and demand for private rental properties is increasing currently. Our Student Accommodation Team is on hand to offer support and advice to any student who needs it. And, the Students’ Union also has its own letting agency who can give legal advice and support students to find accommodation.\n\n\"We also offer a range of financial support packages, bursaries and scholarships including specific ones designed to help students meet the cost of their accommodation. In terms of university accommodation, we continue to offer a range of options at various price levels, we have increased the number of affordable rooms in recent years. The overall number of beds we have made available for students has doubled over the last ten years.\n\n“We are conscious of the importance of a sustainable relationship between the city and its universities, which is why we have been working closely with Bristol City Council to implement a plan of new purpose-built student housing. This will increase supply in parts of the city where student housing investment is beneficial to the local community and relieve pressure on other parts of the housing market. For example, we have new developments planned with partners at Temple Quarter and Bedminster Down.\n\n\"Through the increased supply of purpose-built student accommodation, more students can move out of poor condition, poorly managed HMOs and into quality, affordable well-managed communities in purpose-built student homes. This would also relieve pressure on other parts of the housing market.”\n\nWhat do Bristol letting agents think?\n\nBen Giles, founder of letting agents Balloon Lets, feels that students and young people are facing unique challenges when it comes to renting in Bristol. Aside from increased rents as landlords mortgages have increased, the introduction of new HMO licenses has forced some landlords to charge a rent premium.\n\n\"It is very, very difficult for young people renting now. This year, the HMO licenses will affect the entire city,\" said Ben.\n\n\"The best way to save money as a young person is to live with other people. It used to be that the bigger the house, the cheaper the rooms but now its around £1500 to apply for a license and this needs to be renewed every five years, so landlords are charging a premium for this.\"\n\nThe new HMO licenses being put in place aim to improve living standards that landlords must adhere to, and will see HMOs being inspected by the council. However, Ben feels that these new policies will \"trickle down\" to renters and place the additional financial burden onto them with rent increases.\n\n\"We are quite selective about who we work with. Fundamentally the idea is holding landlords to a standard, and we know there are landlords out there who need this,\" said Ben.\n\n\"The problem isn't landlords. It's a lack of affordable housing and it won't be resolved until more homes are built.\"\n\nBristol City Council: \"Bristol's private rented sector is becoming increasingly unaffordable\"\n\nA Bristol City Council spokesperson said: “Bristol’s private rented sector is becoming increasingly unaffordable and difficult to access. The sector’s size has reduced following various taxation changes at a national level, and a number of landlords leaving the sector. These factors have significantly impacted the wellbeing and quality of life of private renters as well playing a major role in creating homelessness.\n\n“Whilst action is taken where possible to ensure properties are maintained to a decent standard and support is in place to help those facing homelessness, the ability to take direct action on affordability remains with government.\n\n“Last year, the city’s first Living Rent Commission published a report setting out several recommendations for central government. We are continuing the commission’s work and advocating for reforms to private rented accommodation, including powers to control local rents.”"
