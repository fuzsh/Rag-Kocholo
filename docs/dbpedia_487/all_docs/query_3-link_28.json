        "text": "Eligibility\n\n​\n\nYou can get SNAP benefits depending on the amount of money you and your household make each month. Check if you could get SNAP benefits in the chart below or fill out our quick screener.\n\nIf someone in your household is 60 years old or older, or has a disability, you can make a little more money than it says in the chart below and still get SNAP.\n\nYou do not have to be a U.S. citizen to get SNAP. Getting SNAP does not impact your or your kid’s immigration status.\n\nWhat counts as income?\n\nYour income is all the money you make. That includes money from working, cash assistance, Social Security, unemployment, and child support.\n\nFor SNAP, we look at your “gross income:” all the money you make before any taxes or expenses.\n\nWho is in a SNAP household?\n\nYour household includes anyone you buy and cook most of your meals with.\n\nIf you live with your spouse or your child(ren) under 22, they are always part of your household.\n\n*This is the most SNAP benefits someone could get. The amount you get depends on the money you make and your expenses. After you apply, we will look at your situation to figure out if you can get SNAP benefits. We will also calculate how much money you would get on your EBT card each month.\n\nThe amount of money you can make and still get SNAP is set by the federal government. This is the official guidance as of October 1, 2023.\n\nExtra eligibility rules for students\n\nGenerally, you cannot get SNAP if you are in college, university, or trade school full-time or half-time or more.\n\nTo be able to get SNAP if you are enrolled in school half-time or more, you must be any one of the things in the chart below.\n\nWhat does it mean to be “half-time” in school?\n\nYour school defines what it means to be \"half-time\" based on how many classes you are taking. Ask your college, university, or school for your status.\n\nIf you are in school half-time or more than half-time, you have extra rules to get on SNAP.\n\nIf you are a part-time student who is in school less than half-time, you do not have any extra rules to get on SNAP.\n\n​"
