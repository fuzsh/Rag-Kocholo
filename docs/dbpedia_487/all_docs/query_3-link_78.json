        "text": "You’ll spend nine to twelve weeks in one of our business areas between June and August, whilst getting a taste for what it’s really like to work in the largest professional services firm in the world.\n\nEach of our internships has a different focus, so your work will differ depending on the kind of role you choose. If it’s Audit & Assurance, for example, you’ll be working with a team that advises clients on their accounting systems and controls, ways to improve them and reduce risk. In Financial Advisory, its all about working in a team that advises clients on buying or selling a business for example. Whereas, in Technology, you’re more likely to be in a team designing new systems or developing IT strategy.\n\nAll of our projects are about problem solving, which happens best when we work collaboratively. Throughout your internship, you’ll connect with colleagues across different teams to tackle challenges for our clients. As well as this, you’ll develop the kind of rounded business skills that will serve you well regardless of where your future takes you.\n\nWith more projects focused on technology and the latest digital developments, we approach every client with a clear eye on the future. It’s that vision that enables us to help the biggest businesses make some of their biggest decisions.\n\nThere are opportunities available in our Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Limerick and Galway offices.\n\nAligned with our Deloitte Works policy, we host our interns using a hybrid format, working from our offices as well as remotely. Our goal is for you to get the Deloitte experience in person, whilst still allowing you flexibility and trust to work from home when suits you and your team.\n\nWe believe that in-person collaboration will enhance your experience, so we encourage all our interns to make the most of this opportunity to kickstart your career and learn from our team of experts.\n\nFrom the moment you join, you’ll be working in a team, valued for the unique contribution you make and the fresh ideas you bring. You'll gain hands-on project experience working with professional and experienced teams. You'll be encouraged to think for yourself and use your initiative within your team delivering pioneering solutions for our clients. You will also develop the kind of rounded business skills that will serve you well regardless of where your future takes you. And you’ll get all the learning support you need to develop yourself both personally and professionally.\n\nWhen you join: You'll participate in a full induction programme including a warm welcome, key skills, technical training and team building. You will also be assigned a buddy that will help you navigate everything even the smallest things to help you settle into summer at Deloitte and start to grow your network!\n\nLearning and development: You’ll be well-supported throughout the summer and have plenty of scope to expand your skills. Examples include:\n\nInsight Sessions: We think a summer internship is a great opportunity to meet a variety of people and get an insight into the work carried out within each of our business areas. Our insight sessions take place throughout our internship programme, showcasing topics such as innovation in Audit & Assurance and advancements in Consulting Technology.\n\nPresentation Skills: An interactive session where you have an opportunity to develop your presentation skills that will support you in college and in your future careers, learning key skills, tips and tricks and practicing in a safe space with real time feedback.\n\nSkills for Life Sessions: This programme gives an introduction to skills that enable us to succeed in all aspects of our life and includes everything from Professional Brand, Finance, Healthy Eating and participation in our world-renowned Business Chemistry."
