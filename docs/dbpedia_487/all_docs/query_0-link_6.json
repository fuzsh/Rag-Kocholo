We look for more partnerships with industry, so it not only ensures our students get the best experience, but also benefits our research.\"\n\nBrady believes the Brexit is a short-term uncertainty for European students at the university, but Chinese students should not notice any difference.\n\nHe adds that the Brexit makes internationalization more important for the university, adding that, while it will continue working with its European partners, it is already expanding its relations around the world.\n\nElaborating on the university's mission, he says: \"Our core principle remains the same. Our job is to prepare all our students, whether they are UK students or Chinese ones, for a world where they live and work across cultures.\"\n\nAccording to him, the university now has about 1,700 Chinese students on campus.\n\nSpeaking about their subject choices, he says: \"When Chinese students choose majors, they emphasize finance, management, law and engineering. So, we always have strong recruitment to those disciplines, but now we are seeing Chinese students who are interested in majors such as humanities, film studies and sciences.\"\n\n\"It probably reflects a Chinese society that's becoming more high-tech and knowledge-based. China's creative and digital sectors are strong. So, students choose these areas because they see their importance.\"\n\nErik Lithander, pro vice-chancellor (international) of the university, says that students who are interested in visiting China for internships or exchange programs have different reasons.\n\nLithander says that for some students, China is the best place for their academic disciplines.\n\nFor example, if they study international business, China is an exciting place for them to see economic development.\n\nAlso, some want to experience life in a country growing in such an exciting way.\n\nAnd some are simply interested in the Chinese language and culture.\n\n\"Our students are intelligent about preparing for their future, and they know that China is important. So, living, studying or having an internship in China will make them more competitive when they start to look for jobs,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that UK students eyeing Chinese universities are seeking the same things as Chinese students looking at British universitiesï¼a mixture of academic reputation and location.\n\nAlso, some students like big cities, while other like small ones."
