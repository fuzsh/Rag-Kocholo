This schedule is quite exhausting for me. Moreover, I find it challenging to maintain my concentration for such long periods, which I feel detracts from the overall learning experience.\n\nCourse content: 3 .0\n\nWork placements and internships: 3 .0\n\nLecturers and teaching quality: 4 .0\n\nCareer prospects: 4 .0\n\nTutor contact time: 4 .0\n\nSubject facilities: 4 .0\n\nUniversity location (4)\n\nCost of living: 4 .0\n\nSafety: 4 .0\n\nPublic transport: 4 .0\n\nPart-time work opportunities: 4 .0\n\nGraduate employment opportunities: 4 .0\n\nDiversity: 4 .0\n\nUniversity halls (3)\n\nzinc quarter townhouse\n\nI'm staying in Zinc Quarter, and it's pretty far from campus, so getting around isn't all that easy. Plus, there's often a lot of loud talking going on around here, which really messes with my sleep. And about the rent – it feels a bit steep, you know?

This would be what I’m most dissatisfied abt the school - the tutor contact time is also quite horrible in that tutors are only available around once a week which means sometimes I’ll have to wait 1 to 2 weeks to go through anything\n\nCourse content: 4 .0\n\nWork placements and internships: 3 .0\n\nLecturers and teaching quality: 3 .0\n\nCareer prospects: 4 .0\n\nTutor contact time: 2 .0\n\nSubject facilities: 2 .0\n\nUniversity halls (4)\n\nCampbell House\n\n- it is quite a shame that some students in my accommodation get very big kitchens while some, like me, get very cramped kitchens despite the fact we all pay the same price - the facilities are great - the property management is mediocre\n\nLocation: 5 .0\n\nSafety: 5 .0\n\nRoom allocation: 4 .0\n\nInternet/wifi: 4 .0\n\nValue for money: 4 .0\n\nProperty management: 3 .0\n\nUniversity rating (4)\n\nFacilities: 3.0\n\nLocation: 4.0\n\nStudent support: 5.0\n\nCampus look and feel: 4.0\n\nStudent life: 3.0\n\nStudents' union: 4.0\n\nCourse rating (4)\n\nThe contact hours with lecturers and tutors are very reasonable. I enjoy my criminal, contract, and tort modules but I feel it is necessary for the Law in Action module to stretch for the entire year. I heard that it used to be an intense 2-month course instead of an entire year, and I would personally prefer having the former.\n\nCourse content: 4 .0\n\nWork placements and internships: 3 .0\n\nLecturers and teaching quality: 3 .0\n\nCareer prospects: 4 .0\n\nTutor contact time: 4 .0\n\nSubject facilities: 4 .0\n\nUniversity halls (5)\n\nCampbell House\n\nCampbell House is a very pretty student accommodation. It is very new, and the facilities are amazing. I love the gym and study spaces in Campbell. One thing I would prefer to have is a bigger room. My room is very small compared to my friend's rooms in other uni halls.\n\nLocation: 5 .0\n\nSafety: 5 .0\n\nRoom allocation: 5 .0\n\nInternet/wifi: 5 .0\n\nValue for money: 5 .0\n\nProperty management: 5 .0"
