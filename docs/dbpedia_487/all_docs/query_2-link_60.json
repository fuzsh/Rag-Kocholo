        "text": "All of our programs favor an interprofessional, patient-centered approach taught by experienced faculty in highly collaborative settings. In fact, we are one of only a few universities in the nation to have a school of health sciences along with a medical school and nursing school on one campus. This means you’ll experience what being part of an integrated team is all about as you work alongside students from other healthcare-based programs, and with some of the most technologically advanced resources in academia.\n\nFrom fieldwork and internships to our on-campus clinics and global engagement programs, you’ll have every opportunity to put into practice what you learn — and make a positive difference while you do it. When you graduate, you’ll do so with the experience, confidence and broad spectrum of interdisciplinary skills needed to become a leader in both your discipline and the global community.\n\nHear from some of our students on why they decided to become a Bobcat.\n\nOur annual viewbook provides a visual journey that brings our philosophy of health science education and practice to life. This comprehensive document is your gateway to exploring the remarkable achievements, innovations and contributions of our esteemed faculty, staff, students and alumni who have distinguished themselves through teaching, scholarship, clinical education and community impact.\n\nAs we reflect on the past year, we invite you to join us in celebrating our commitment to excellence in education, scholarship and service within our dynamic health science fields. In these pages, you will find a wealth of information on our accomplishments and advancements powered by our unwavering dedication to shaping the future of healthcare.\n\nThank you for your continued support as we work together to promote health and well-being in our communities and beyond.\n\nExplore our Viewbook (PDF)"
