        "text": "Tiffany Gordon\n\nGraduate Program Coordinator\n\nTiffany Gordon\n\nTel: 250-721-8193\n\nPronouns: she/her\n\nFaculty of Law\n\nUniversity of Victoria\n\nPO Box 1700, STN CSC\n\nVictoria, BC V8W 2Y2\n\nMap\n\nI joined UVic Law in 2019, and am the first point of contact for the graduate program. I am responsible for all aspects of the law graduate program’s operation and administrative management, graduate student services, graduate program admissions, graduate student orientation, graduate student funding, to graduate student completion. I track, plan and strategise on the use of funds in the operating budget, as well as the student award allocation budget. I also advocate for our law graduate students where necessary, working closely with UVic's Faculty of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Admissions and Records Office.\n\nPrior to working at UVic Law, I worked as a Research Analyst at BC Stats, as Senior Graduate Program Administrator at the University of British Columbia, and as a Planning and Projects Officer in the Vice-Chancellor’s Strategic Planning and Projects Office at the University of Bristol (UK). I have also worked as a technical translator (Spanish-English), literacy advocate and bookstore owner, research officer and accounting clerk and in business development and administration. For many years I was directly involved in grassroots outreach and human rights work in Latin America. I founded and led a charitable society working with street children and young gang members in Latin America for over 10 years. This is in part why I love the focus on social justice and Indigenous law at UVic Law.\n\nI have a MSc in Latin American Studies from the Institute of Latin American Studies in London (UK) and a MA (Hons) in Geography with Spanish from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nI am committed to decolonisation, and to supporting all of our law graduate students as best I can, in line with the University of Victoria's Strategic Framework and Indigenous Plan."
