        "text": "For the second year running, the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol) has been rated as one of the top 10 universities in the UK for postgraduate students.\n\nStudent satisfaction with UWE Bristol's postgraduate taught courses is higher than ever according to the latest Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey (PTES).\n\nThe University received a score of 91% student satisfaction in the 2019 PTES, up 2% from last year and 9% above the overall higher education sector.\n\nThis places the University sixth out of the 84 higher education institutions that took part in the survey.\n\nThe result follows an 88 per cent undergraduate student satisfaction for UWE Bristol's in the National Student Survey (NSS), which placed the University in the top 10 in England.\n\nUWE Bristol improved or maintained in all categories, with 35 programmes scoring over 92% overall satisfaction (up from 34 last year) and 16 (up from 10) achieving a perfect 100%.\n\nThese were: Animation & Virtual Reality; MSc Accounting and Finance; PGDip Bar Professional Training Course (FT); PGDip Bar Professional Training Course (PT); Building Surveying; MSc Environmental Health; MSc Finance; Graduate Diploma Law; PG Cert Approved Mental Health Practice; Professional Doctorate Counselling Psychology; MSc Radiotherapy and Oncology; MSc Real Estate Finance and Investment (Distance Learning); MSc Rehabilitation; MSc Transport; MSc Urban Planning.\n\nProfessor Steve West, Vice-Chancellor at UWE Bristol, said: “To be in the top 10 in the UK again in recognition for postgraduate student satisfaction is a great achievement. Together with our NSS results and our highest ever ranking in the latest Guardian University league table (28th out of 121 UK universities), it highlights our reputation as one of the best universities in the country for the student experience. Thanks to the continued hard work of our staff to achieve this result.”\n\nMore than 1,700 UWE Bristol postgraduate taught students completed the annual sector-wide survey earlier this year run by Advance HE, a professional body that seeks to improve outcomes for students.\n\nThe survey focuses on areas including the experience of teaching and learning, assessment and feedback, and organisation and management."
