        "text": "The Office of Financial Aid Services maintains a position that no student should be denied access to higher education because of financial need. Each year, our office uses all available resources to help eligible students fund their direct costs, which include charges for tuition and fees, as well as an allowance for books and supplies. Each year, we collectively award more than $100 million to more than 30,000 students.\n\nCT State is a partner institution of the College Cost Transparency Initiative, a higher education community committed to providing students financial aid information about the cost of college that is clear, accurate, and transparent. To ensure that we are providing you with financial aid information reflective of these values, CT State is committed to using the Principles and Standards of the College Cost Transparency Initiative in our student financial aid offers.\n\nTo assist in determining your financial need and eligibility for financial aid, we are required to develop a Cost of Attendance for you based on federal regulations. Aside from tuition and fees, this also includes items such as books, course materials, supplies and equipment, housing and food, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses. We understand that housing and food, transportation costs, and miscellaneous personal expenses will vary for each individual and family. For that reason, we use approximated costs for these components based on actual data from The College Board and The Council for Community and Economic Research. The Housing estimate is a standard allowance for rent or other housing costs. The Food estimate is a standard allowance for purchasing food and includes three meals per day. Should you experience other costs that are not typical, you have the right to a Cost of Attendance appeal to include additional expenses with supporting documentation. Please note, this does not guarantee any additional award to your financial aid package. Examples of such expenses may include dependent care, disability costs, or the documented cost of a leased or purchased computer.\n\nFinancial Need is the calculated difference between your Cost of Attendance and the Student Aid Index (SAI) you receive when you complete your FAFSA. The value of your calculated financial need provides our office with the information needed to award you need-based financial aid, such as grants and scholarships.\n\nWhile tuition and fee charges are the same for all students at any CT State institution, the calculated Cost of Attendance will vary by campus, dependency status, and other factors such as the location within the State of Connecticut. You may view your personal Cost of Attendance within your Self-Service Banner account, accessible from myCTState. From the Financial Aid section, select College Financing Plan.\n\nRemember, you are not required to fund your entire Cost of Attendance for enrollment at any of our colleges. Depending on eligibility and the availability of funds, we seek to cover your direct costs to the college, which are your tuition and fee charges, and an allowance for books, course materials, supplies and equipment.\n\n2024-2025 Cost of Attendance\n\nNote: These figures do not represent your actual bill but are estimates. For information regarding actual current-year costs, please visit the Tuition and Fees website. Students who are less-than-full-time will have certain expenses adjusted based on the number of credits for which they are enrolled, usually after the end of each semester’s add/drop period.\n\nFor in-state students living at home, “Living Expenses (Food and Housing)” estimates included are $9,058 “Transportation” estimates of $1,845 and “Miscellaneous Personal Expenses” estimates of $5,871 per year are included.\n\nFor out-of-state and NEBHE students living at home, “Living Expenses (Food and Housing)” estimates included are $8,932, “Transportation” estimates of $1,845 and “Miscellaneous Personal Expenses” estimates of $5,871 per year are included.\n\nFor students enrolled in programs that require professional licensure, certification, or a first professional credential, “Professional/Licensure fee” estimates included are $527.46 per year and books, course materials, supplies and equipment are $3,000 per year."
