        "text": "During the First World War, Britain and France mobilized colonial soldiers and non-European civilian laborers on an unprecedented scale to support military operations on the Western Front. The massive deployment of soldiers and contract workers from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean temporarily transformed the racial demographics in Western Europe and ruptured the geographic and social boundaries between European metropoles and their overseas colonial territories. Framing the Western Front as a sociocultural contact zone, this article examines how colonial soldiers from the British West Indies Regiment (BWIR) navigated interracial and inter-imperial encounters in wartime France. The article illustrates how BWIR soldiers’ intimate exchanges across the color line—whether at military work sites, in places of leisure or in private homes—provided an opportunity to compare British and French racial policies and to assess the status of colonials of color in the British Empire.\n\nThe paper explores the demise of the ‘colonial war’ category through the employment of French colonial troops, under the 1918 armistice, to occupy the German Rhineland. It traces the prevalence of—and the anxieties underpinning—antebellum doctrine on using ‘Barbarous Forces’ in ‘European’ war. It then records the silence of postbellum scholars on the ‘horror on the Rhine’—orchestrated allegations of rape framed in racialised terms of humanity and the requirements of the law of civilised warfare. Among possible explanations for this silence, the paper follows recent literature that considers this scandal as the embodiment of crises in masculinity, white domination, and European civilisation. These crises, like the scandal itself, expressed antebellum jurisprudential anxieties about the capacity—and implications—of black soldiers being ‘drilled white’. They also deprived postbellum lawyers of the vocabulary necessary to address what they signified: breakdown of the laws of war; evident, self-inflicted European barbarity; and the collapse of international law itself, embodied by the Versailles Diktat treating Germany—as Smuts warned, ‘as we would not treat a kaffir nation’—a colonial ‘object’, as Schmitt lamented. Last, the paper traces the resurgence of ‘colonial war’. It reveals how, at the moment of collapse, in the very instrument ambodying it, the category found a new life. The Covenant’s Art.22(5) reasserted control over the colonial object, furnishing international lawyers with new vocabulary to address the employment of colonial troops—yet, now, as part of the ‘law of peace’. Reclassified, both rule and category re-emerged, were codified, and institutionalised imperial governance."
