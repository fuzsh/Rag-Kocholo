        "text": "Net income of $30.6 million on $189.0 million in revenue, compared to net income of $12.7 million on $98.4 million in revenue in Q2 2023\n\nConsolidated cash balance of $227.0 million as of June 30, 2024\n\nAnnuitized $234 million of pension plan obligations for more than 1,000 beneficiaries, resulting in a $16.6 million settlement gain\n\nSecured a U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\") waiver under the Prohibiting Russian Imports Act to cover 2024 and 2025 U.S. customer deliveries under the Russian supply contract\n\nBETHESDA, Md., Aug. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Centrus Energy Corp. (NYSE American: LEU) (\"Centrus\" or the \"Company\") today reported second quarter 2024 results. The Company reported net income of $30.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, which is $1.89 (basic and diluted) per common share.\n\n\"Centrus delivered strong revenues and margins for shareholders this quarter as we continue progressing towards our long-term goal of restoring domestic uranium enrichment capability at scale,\" said Centrus President and CEO Amir Vexler. \"Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Energy has issued a series of request for proposals (\"RFPs\") to jump-start domestic nuclear fuel production, backed by more than $3.4 billion in appropriations from Congress â€“ the largest federal investment in uranium enrichment in decades. We are vigorously competing for this funding as we believe it represents a historic opportunity to restore America's nuclear fuel supply chain with U.S. technology built by American workers.\"\n\nFinancial Results\n\nCentrus generated total revenue of $189.0 million and $98.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $90.6 million.\n\nRevenue from the LEU segment was $169.6 million and $87.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $82.0 million. SWU revenue increased by $91.6 million as a result of an increase in the volume of SWU sold and an increase in the average price of SWU sold. Uranium revenue decreased by $9.6 million as a result of a decrease in the volume of uranium sold, partially offset by an increase in the average price of uranium sold.\n\nRevenue from the Technical Solutions segment was $19.4 million and $10.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $8.6 million. Revenue generated under the HALEU Operation Contract between the Company and the DOE signed in 2022 increased $8.4 million due to the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 in late 2023, as further described below. The remaining increase was attributable to other contracts.\n\nCost of sales for the LEU segment was $136.6 million and $60.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $75.8 million. SWU costs increased as a result of an increase in the average unit cost of SWU sold and an increase in the volume of SWU sold. Uranium costs decreased as a result of a decrease in the volume of uranium sold, partially offset by an increase in the average unit cost of uranium sold. Cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 included $1.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the revaluation of inventory loans.\n\nCost of sales for the Technical Solutions segment was $15.9 million and $9.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $6.3 million. Costs incurred for the HALEU Operation Contract increased by $6.3 million due to the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 in late 2023.\n\nGross profit for the Company was $36.5 million and $28.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily attributed to the increase in gross profit in the LEU segment and in the Technical Solutions segment, driven by the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 of the HALEU Operation Contract in late 2023. LEU customers generally have multi-year contracts that carry annual purchase commitments, not quarterly commitments. The gross profit in our LEU business varies based upon the timing of those contracts. The pricing of those deliveries varies depending upon the market conditions at the time the contract was signed with a portion of our outstanding contracts entered into at historically higher prices. The Company's gross profit in the LEU segment was higher primarily due to the increase in sales volume and composition of contracts in the current quarter, which included higher-priced legacy contracts.\n\nDomestic Enrichment Update\n\nAs previously announced, the Company began enrichment operations in October 2023 at its American Centrifuge Plant in Piketon, Ohio, and made its first delivery of 20 kilograms of High Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (\"HALEU\") uranium hexafluoride (\"UF6\") in November 2023, completing Phase 1 of the HALEU Operation Contract under budget and ahead of schedule. The DOE is contractually required to provide storage cylinders necessary to collect the HALEU product from the cascade. Using the storage cylinders currently made available by the DOE, Centrus has now achieved cumulative deliveries to the DOE of approximately 179 kilograms of HALEU UF6.\n\nOn November 28, 2023 and January 9, 2024, the DOE issued two Requests for Proposal (\"RFPs\") for the deconversion and enrichment of HALEU, respectively. The Company submitted bids for both RFPs, with the goal of expanding HALEU production capability at the Piketon, Ohio facility. On June 27, 2024, the DOE issued an RFP for production of LEU. Centrus, which has previously successfully demonstrated LEU enrichment capabilities, intends to submit a proposal to incorporate large-scale LEU production alongside HALEU production in Piketon. The total available appropriations to be awarded currently under the RFPs is $3.4 billion which is subject to further appropriations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining new contracts or funding.\n\nThe Prohibiting Russian Imports Act\n\nThe Prohibiting Russian Imports Act enacted in May 2024 imposed a ban on imports of uranium products from Russia. The ban which is set to take effect on August 11, 2024, empowers the DOE to issue waivers for certain imports through 2027. On July 18, 2024, the DOE issued the Company a waiver allowing it to import LEU from Russia for deliveries already committed by the Company to its U.S. customers in 2024 and 2025. For the years 2026 and 2027, the DOE deferred its decision to an unspecified date closer in time to the deliveries. The Company is also seeking a waiver to allow for importation of LEU from Russia for processing and reexport to the Company's foreign customers, and also plans to request a waiver covering imports in 2026 and 2027 that Centrus is obligated to purchase but has not yet committed to particular customers. It is uncertain whether any further waivers will be granted to the Company and, if granted, whether any waiver would be granted in a timely manner or will be sufficient in scope to support the Company's intended operations.\n\nPension Annuitization\n\nOn May 28, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with an insurer (\"Insurer\") for two of its pension plans to purchase a group annuity contract and transferred approximately $234 million of its pension plan obligations to the Insurer, resulting in a 79% reduction in the Company's pension liabilities. The purchase of the group annuity contract was funded directly by the assets of the pension plan of approximately $224 million. The purchase resulted in a transfer of administrative and benefit paying responsibilities for more than 1,000 beneficiaries to the Insurer. As a result of this annuitization, the Company recognized a gain of $16.6 million in nonoperating components of net periodic benefit loss (income) in its consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThis transaction builds upon the previous pension annuitization in the fourth quarter of 2023; the two transactions combined have resulted in transferring a total of approximately $420 million of the Company's pension plan obligations for approximately 2,400 beneficiaries. The annuitization de-risks the Company's balance sheet by reducing its current and future liabilities.\n\nBacklog\n\nThe Company's backlog is $2.7 billion as of June 30, 2024 and extends to 2040. Our LEU segment backlog as of June 30, 2024 is approximately $1.7 billion and includes future SWU and uranium deliveries primarily under medium and long-term contracts with fixed commitments and approximately $900 million in contingent LEU sales commitments, subject to entering into definitive agreements, in support of potential construction of LEU production capacity at the Piketon, Ohio facility. Our Technical Solutions segment backlog is approximately $1.0 billion as of June 30, 2024 and includes both funded amounts (services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer), unfunded amounts (services for which funding has not been appropriated), and unexercised options.\n\nAbout Centrus Energy Corp.\n\nCentrus Energy is a trusted supplier of nuclear fuel components and services for the nuclear power industry.
