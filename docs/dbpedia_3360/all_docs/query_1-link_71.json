        "text": "ok i know i am confusing..lol..\n\nyesturday when i had my ton of clothes from the local landfil there was a lovely brown suit, typical demob signs of button holes on each lapel etc..\n\ninside there is a label with the gentleman's name a presume is rank no.\n\nplus the date which is 18.2.52\n\nwhy i am asking, is that most of the pictures of demob suits i have seen have the 'gangster' stripe so to speak and are from mid to late 40's, nothing early 50's\n\nor would it be just a normal suit issue for someone that left the forces ?\n\nwill get some picks done and post later..\n\ni must admit i am on cloud nine, as i very rarely get any vintage men's clothes in and not in bad nick either...\n\nThe buttonholes on each lapel is, I thought, a sure sign of an ENglish demob suit -- so that war medals can be worn on the civilian suit. However, maybe that wasn't the purpose after all...\n\nThe suit is obviously made to order for the man in 1952 so that is too new for a demob suit as they were distributed to the demobilized soldiers for about a year starting in the of summer of 1945. The true demob suits looks very much like prewar suits, with turn-ups and narrow waist and tight fitting jacket. Striped suits remained in fashion into the early 1950s, so you can't go by that as much, but the jacket and pants should get much fuller in cut after 1947.\n\nThat looks pretty classic late 40s - early 50s to me. The brown colour, the wide lapels, wide legs. Its a bit narrow through the body but its not on a proper size form, so its hard to tell. The number on the label is not a military number --its just a model number for the suit. Demob suits weren't custom tailored, they were off the rack and adjusted to fit. With the last name of Davies it looks like you have a Welshman's suit there! Its a great suit - you will do well with it. I have seen similar suits sell for 200 pounds or thereabouts. Depends on size and condition.\n\nthanks jonathan....it must have belonged to someone local to me, it looks as though the gentleman must have died and had his belongings cleared out and basically put into the local amenity skip...\n\nwhich to be honest breaks my heart as obviously this guy loved his old suit...but at the end this is happening all over the world not only in my local area.....( thats why i went into being a rag merchant )\n\nthe suit is on the small side so the guy must have been quite small\n\nso would have the no. been a design no or maybe a ref no.. to mr davies's order ?\n\nhas anyone heard of willerby & co of london ?\n\ncondition....... there is a very small hole/break in the fibre near the elbow, and a very small hole type blip near the bottom of one of the trs... apart from that( well what i have seen at mo) its in pretty good condition....\n\nwas going to take it to the dry cleaners next week before i put it onto ebay....\n\nYes, demob suits were given to British servicemen when WW11 ended in 1945. They came in limited sizes and choice of suiting fabric. If the full suit, including waistcoat and other items such as shoes and hat, were purchased, the customer had bought the 'Full Monty'; a term derived from the owner of the Burtons clothing store. Montagu Burton won the government contract for manufacturing the suits. The twin buttonhole isn't typical for a demob suit. A chalk grey pin-stripe suit was one of the styles produced. Interestingly, Burtons are currently selling men's trousers described as 'demob.'\n\nThe company Willerby & Co. Ltd. were on Tottenham Court Road in London and had several London and provincial branches. They sold made to measure suits."
