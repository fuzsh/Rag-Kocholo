        "text": "The record follows long-in-the-making 2015 debut Dream Soda, and comes after a period of personal and professional tumult - including the loss of one of their original members.\n\n\"It's about getting to know your duality, that there's good and bad in you, and not hiding from either,\" explains frontman Matthew Marcantonio. \"A spoonful of sugar is sickly, but with lemon it becomes bittersweet and something new altogether.\"\n\n\"We like old videos of bands on TV shows,\" Marcantonio continues of the new video for \"Be Your Man\". \"They have this unorganised quality to them, before this standardised version of what a performer should do and how to act. it was looser and more care free, they took the piss out of it all.\"\n\nHoly Doom was (mostly) recorded over the summer with Ian Davenport in Oxfordshire, with the drums laid down by previous collaborator Christoph Skirl.\n\nDemob Happy play a few shows later this month with Frank Carter and The Rattlesnakes (they'll also head out to continental Europe with them in March), before heading around the UK with The Cribs next month. Find out the full details.\n\nTracklist:\n\nLiar In Your Head\n\nBe Your Man\n\nLoosen It\n\nFake Satan\n\nRunnin' Around\n\nI Wanna Leave (Alive)\n\nMaker Of Mine\n\nHoly Doom\n\nSpinning Out\n\nGods Iâ€™ve Seen\n\nFresh Outta Luck\n\nHoly Doom is out 23 March 2018 via SO Recordings."
