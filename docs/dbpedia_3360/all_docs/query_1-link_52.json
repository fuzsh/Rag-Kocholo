        "text": "Joshua Epithet is a 21-year old Manchester based artist/producer. Josh has spent the past few years splitting his time between the UK & US, which is evident in his list of influences - ranging from Blur and The Streets to 2010's US rap scene and albums like Childish Gambino's 'Because The Internet' and Tyler, The Creator's 'Flower Boy' - \"When I was growing up, the type of music I was into, America was doing it way better\" he explains, when talking about this particular scene, \"but I'll rep Britain all day long - as much as my Irish mum allows me to. I want to be part of this new wave of British musicians\".\n\nMusic came along around the time Josh entered his teens. Armed with music sampling software Splice, he set about creating his own distinct music world – one filled with plantastic synths, cross-continent collaborations, and blissed-out production. Dedicated to his craft, he also sees a need to match the last generation’s pace.\n\nAnd testament to his generation, Josh has mastered the art of global collaboration. He's worked on music with Indiana-based teenage hyperpop artist Lucas Lex and Canadian indie-pop songstress Nep to fellow British acts pinkpirate, FINLINCE!, Zack Teale and Cian Jay to Thai artist Salads and Portugal's multi-hyphenate Nana Lourdes.\n\nJosh has shared his first piece of new music for 2023, ‘She Writes Fanfiction’, a masterwork of lush production and punchy melodies, entirely self-written, mixed and produced by the alt-indie newcomer. Out now on his new label home Liberator Music (home to fellow UK artists Gengahr and Demob Happy), the single is accompanied by an official video, directed by frequent collaborator Ben Wescott (skaiwater, Ezekiel, Viji, Deijuhvs).\n\nSpeaking about the song, Josh explains “She Writes Fan Fiction is about reality, and everyone’s own individual idea of what that means. At what point does your own reality become fantasy? When have you finally been swallowed whole by the lie you told yourself?”"
