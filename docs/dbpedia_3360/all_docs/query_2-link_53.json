        "text": "Tell you what, Saturday afternoon was all about discoveries ahead of the Demob Happy rock and roll extravaganza in the evening. Not only would Brighton lot Congratulations be supporting (a new discovery for us having ripped it at 2000 Trees this summer), but it would all be kicking off just after 7PM! As someone who is partial to an early finish, this was music to my ears, so skates were appropriately put on to make it into town on time.\n\nOff the back of releasing their debut EP this month (the ‘Woo Hoo EP‘, out via Bella Union), the flamboyant, jump-suited Congratulations killed it in Manchester, the perfect support for the noisiness we’d soon be encountering from the headliners. With punters taking tentative steps at first, everyone was urged to move forward ahead of a riffy mega bop (of which they have loads).\n\n“Why aren’t they all pink?” Asked the drummer of venues up and down the land, suggesting YES is the coolest venue they’ve ever played, this being only their second time in Manchester. Soon after, he’s pulling out a massive ear-splitting drum solo, coincidentally just after I’d said to someone at the Turnstile show the other week that you rarely see drum solos anymore… With a sound that dips collective toes into Weaves and Deerhoof territory, I love how they have proper heavy chops on occasion (speaking of heavy, a foot on the monitor highlighted just how MASSIVE the vocalists shoes were!)\n\nThey all looked the tops, but the guitarist was a total retro vision, shredding it in the direction of the drummer, as his man behind the kit hammered way. On ‘Kryptonite‘, the guitarist was running on the spot as the vocalist shouted encouragement in his face. Whilst the boys all raised their guitars to the ceiling signalling a wig-out ending, the vocalist was up front pulling great faces before they chipped off to much applause. Charming lot!\n\nWith it being the first sold out show of the tour, it’s understandable that Demob Happy bassist Matthew Marcantonio would want to look smart for the occasion, but a leather jack in this heat?! In fairness, the trio are always the sharpest lads in town whenever they’re in Manchester, arriving on stage Saturday night to truly haunting intro music, guitarist Adam Godfrey wide-eyed in theatrical fashion.\n\nDrummer Thomas Armstrong is on his feet from the off, screaming the chorus on opener ‘Voodoo Science‘. I can’t imagine him ever half-arsing it. He hardly stopped all night, jumping to his feet on just about every song, yelling into the back of the room. At one point he hilariously pinged a drum stick right off the back of Marcantonio’s head, intending for it to go out to a crazed punter on the floor below. Not to be outdone by the Congratulations drummer, he too took off on a drum solo (second of the night!) on the gnarly ‘Haat De Stank‘ from their 2015 debut, ‘Dream Soda‘.\n\nI loved the lad with the mullet documenting their every move on a handheld home video camera, moving throughout the crowd and around the stage all night. He wasn’t the only new face joining the trio, as there was a fourth, equally smart looking chap backing them up on stage. Earning his keep on ‘Loosen It‘, he shook a tambourine in one hand and played a cowbell with the other, later picking up guitar and bass duties.\n\nIt’s easy to forget just how many bangers the trio have got – guitarist Godfrey nailing it on the mega-catchy ‘Autoportrait‘, one of a few standalone singles alongside ‘Mother Machine‘ and latest single ‘Sweet & Sour America‘, all of which were more than welcome jams. On the latter, the trio channelled ‘Songs For The Deaf‘ era Queens of the Stone Age, their latest being a ripper of that vintage, and I was whipped relentlessly by the long-haired lad behind me.\n\nThis year saw the release of their third studio album, ‘Divine Machines‘ – one the crowd knew all too well, coming unglued for just about everything from it. ‘Run Baby Run‘ sounded gigantic, with its glimmers of The Beatles on the chorus, whilst Marcantonio downed tools for a song or three, taking on the microphone wielding frontman across ‘Earth Mover‘ and the smooth vibe of ‘Muscular Reflex‘, gripping the pipe above the stage as he howled against the flashing lights.\n\nFrom where we were stood, the crowd applause was genuinely almost as loud as the band themselves. It’s a big night – I caught an older couple at the bar slamming shots of rum, then a few songs after that, a young couple were grinding down the front (the pair legit wearing the same outfit), whilst a lass to my right cut some proper shapes, getting into the groove. A lighter was even lit (which got a big grin from Marcantonio) and it was singalong central on the fully Beatles leaning ‘She’s As Happy As A Man Can Be‘. “Glastonbury Pyramid stage 2033…” He wagered to an up-for-it crowd. Judging by the reaction at YES, I wouldn’t say it was out of the question…\n\nLike what you see? Why not stick around and check out the other articles and interviews!\n\nDon’t forget to follow Birthday Cake For Breakfast on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter\n\nFor goodness sake it’s October… You might find yourself waiting to buy fuel for your car right now and in need of something to listen to in the queue. Or maybe you’re rubbing sticks together as your energy provider’s gone bust and you’re in desperate need of a soundtrack.\n\nAs reliable as those at Number 10 fucking us inhabitants of this tiny island, Birthday Cake For Breakfast returns for your monthly dose of ear-candy. 20 tunes, old and new – you know the drill.\n\nAnz – You Could Be\n\n(All Hours)\n\nManchester based artist Anz follows up the wonderfully hypnotic ‘Unravel in the Designated Zone‘ with the first single from her new EP, the unbelievable pop bopper that is ‘You Could Be‘. From an EP that promises to pay ‘homage to the many faces and seminal eras of electronic music‘, the single is ludicrously catchy.\n\nDemob Happy – Junk DNA\n\n(Dream Soda)\n\nSeptember kicked off with a bang at Deaf Institute in Manchester with a visit from Geordie lot Demob Happy, very much knocking about on stage like no time had passed over the past 12+ months. Cycling to the show mid-week, I couldn’t get early single ‘Junk DNA‘ out of my head – raging, stoner-rock-esque head-spinner with a chorus that just won’t quit.\n\nFolly Group – Sand Fight\n\n(Awake and Hungry)\n\nFrom an EP that gets better and better the more you hear it, ‘Sand Fight‘ is very much the essence of everything that’s so exciting about Londoner’s Folly Group and their live set up – rapid-fire, energising post-punk destined for sweaty rooms and big smiles. Love this.\n\nIbibio Sound Machine – Tell Me (Doko Mien)\n\n(Doko Mien)\n\nA proper dance-floor ripper, ‘Tell Me (Doko Mien)‘ has the knack of sounding both box-fresh and like it belongs in a dimly lit club in the 80s, capturing the band’s inspirations in West African funk, disco, post-punk and electro. Sure to brighten up the forthcoming gloomy October days.\n\nThe Cribs – Swinging At Shadows\n\n(Sonic Blew Singles Club)\n\nFrom the lovely sounding ‘Sonic Blew Singles Club‘, Wakefield lads The Cribs once again strike gold with the heart-swelling ‘Swinging At Shadows‘, a previously unheard take from the ‘Night Network’ album sessions, recorded at yer man from the Foo Fighters studio. We were lucky enough to catch the trio early September at the wonderful Piece Hall in Halifax – an unforgettable night.\n\nPLOSIVS – Hit the Breaks\n\nJohn Reis let’s go! The Hot Snakes and Rocket From the Crypt leg-end has hooked up with Rob Crow (Pinback) and Atom Willard (Against Me!, the Offspring) as well as bassist Jordan Clark (Mrs. Magician) to form PLOSIVS, their first single ‘Hit the Breaks‘ seeing them hit the ground running. Not unusual given the team involved!\n\nWet Leg – Chaise Longue\n\nLikely a mega hit by the time you’re reading this, ‘Chaise Longue‘ is the debut offering from Isle of Wight formed duo Wet Leg. Cucumber cool and sounding like an instant classic, it’s an arse-shaker no doubt and will surely be topping many an EOY list come December.\n\nSquid – Paddling\n\n(Bright Green Field)\n\nIt’s early September and we’re upstairs at Manchester’s incredible Albert Hall, having our minds altered by Southern lot Squid, the quintet totally making the most of their biggest Manc outing to date. Having been all over their debut album mid-year, following that particular September evening we’re once again bang on it, loving the rapid ‘Paddling‘. ‘Don’t Push Me In!‘\n\nMetronomy x Brian Nasty x Folly Group – Monday\n\n(Posse EP Volume 1)\n\nBreaking the rules by letting Folly Group in twice, but they get a pass as they’ve snuck in with Joseph Mount and Brian Nasty for this unreal collab. From the latest Metronomy release (the wicked five track ‘Posse EP Volume 1‘), closing track ‘Monday‘ is a wonk-pop delight that we’ve not gone a day without listening to of late. ‘I guess you’re what they call Mondaaaay‘\n\nFlavien Berger – Bleu sous-marin\n\n(Léviathan)\n\nBouncy, bouncy, bouncy little number from long-haired Parisian vibe-creator Flavien Berger. Driving along in hypnotic fashion, this is destined to get stuck in your head, so why not let it? Eyes closed, brain off, let go.\n\nWipers – Taking Too Long\n\n(Youth of America)\n\nFrom their second record ‘Youth of America‘, the influential Portland, Oregon formed Wipers seem to have inspired every band going as each time ‘Taking Too Long‘ comes on I assume it’s a new cut from the latest spoken-word-stylee up and coming punk band. As fresh now as it surely was in 1981, this is a proper treat.\n\nYard Act – The Overload\n\n(The Overload)\n\nBloody hell, these lads know how to write a catchy tune eh? Injecting a large fuck off dose of Mad-chester stylings into the BIG chorus, Leeds lot Yard Act once again knock it out the park with their latest single – the first from debut album ‘The Overload‘. Another bowl of fast-paced word soup to hungrily slurp up. “Now then“.\n\nOpus Kink – This Train\n\nDrums please! Funky little number this from the band whose name I’m worried about sticking in my work search engine. Having listened to a lot of ‘Sandinista!‘ of late, this really reminds me of its better moments, a proper great sprint with brass bursts to keep you awake.\n\nAudiobooks – LaLaLa It’s The Good Life\n\n(Astro Tough)\n\nDance banger from the pairing of Evangeline Ling and David Wrench, keen to avoid people intent on killing the vibes. From an album out – well, today – ‘LaLaLa It’s The Good Life‘ bounces around your bonce good and proper.\n\nGnod – Pink Champagne Blues\n\n(La Mort Du Sens)\n\nJUST SAY YES TO MORE NEW GNOD! Fuzzy and noisy and brutal, ‘Pink Champagne Blues‘ does what it says on the tin. The newest single from Salford lot Gnod is a proper head cracker, getting right tucked in with its rumbling rhythm build before unloading on you in crushing fashion.\n\nPozi – Detainer Man\n\n(Typing EP)\n\nSounding like the theme to some tweaked cartoon detective show, Pozi offer up more excitement from their forthcoming ‘Typing EP‘. With the haunting strings we’ve come to know and love from Rosa Brook, she’s backed up by the frantic rhythm section of Toby Burroughs and ‘Green Green Grass of Home‘ Tom Jones on yet another intriguing cut.\n\nMort Garson – Swingin’ Spathiphyllums\n\n(Mother Earth’s Plantasia)\n\nLeave it to Garson and his ‘Swingin’ Spathiphyllums‘ to add a bit of cheer to the month. ‘Mother Earth’s Plantasia‘ comes out on the sunny days and late September probably saw the last of these – This synth odyssey is such a delight.\n\nMacie Stewart – Finally\n\n(Mouth Full of Glass)\n\nOne half of OHMME goes it alone for her debut album ‘Mouth Full of Glass‘, Macie Stewart writing and recording the forthcoming record during the alone time forced upon us by lockdown. A beautifully captivating piece, one lives for the lush strings.\n\nPublic Service Broadcasting – Lichtspiel III: Symphonie Diagonale\n\n(Bright Magic)\n\nJ. Willgoose, Esq and his mates lean heavily into the inspiring city of Berlin on the latest Public Service Broadcasting record ‘Bright Magic‘. Of the singles out in the run up to its release, ‘Lichtspiel III: Symphonie Diagonale‘ caught our attention immediately – a dreamy, glittering instrumental that really takes over your entire being for its near four minute duration.\n\nTricot – Dogs and Ducks\n\n(Jodeki)\n\n‘Dogs and Ducks, Dogs and Ducks, Dogs and Ducks, Dogs and Ducks…‘ More loveliness on offer from Japanese math-rockers Tricot, keen to follow up 2020’s output with this ace little number from their forthcoming new record. UK dates announced for next year too!\n\nLike what you see? Why not stick around and check out the other articles and interviews!\n\nDon’t forget to follow Birthday Cake For Breakfast on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter!\n\nHaving previously shared stages with the likes of Jack White and Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes, when we last caught Demob Happy live in Manchester, we quite rightly predicted the trio would be “setting themselves up for a big year“. Sure enough, it took a year for the world to hit standstill following their big showing at Soup Kitchen in February 2019, so the next twelve months saw them on the road throughout Europe, Canada and the states, racking up further support slots for the likes of Royal Blood and Band of Skulls.\n\n2020 then? Fucked it. Not their fault mind, and a UK tour was squeezed in for Independent Venue Week at the start of the year, but other than that the Demob Happy trio were, for the most part, holed up at home like the rest of us schmucks. Until now!\n\nHaving just finished off a weekend of Reading and Leeds festivities, Demob Happy returned to the live circuit this past week, bright eyed and bushy tailed, ready to kick the arse of Covid-19 and its social distancing. Recent photographic evidence identifies that Demob Happy dress just as well as they ever have in a live setting, suited and booted more often than not. In Manchester last night however they’d dialled it down ever so slightly, only bassist Matthew Marcantonio sporting a sharp blazer. Even still, they all looked like a 1000 quid right enough.\n\nWhat they haven’t dialled down is just how LOUD they are and a massive drum intro from Thomas Armstrong offered a glimpse of what was to come over the next 60 minutes. Hammering away at the kit like it’s the last song of the night, it kicked off 2019 single ‘Autoportrait‘ in explosive fashion and the crowd were mega into it from note one.\n\nEvery introduction was greeted with an eruption of noise from the punters – ‘Loosen It‘ seeing everyone up front bouncing, whilst ‘Liar in your Head‘ had a proper pit open up (albeit a friendly looking one!) Soon after the old gig staples were in full force, as guitarist Adam Godfrey and Armstrong got the crowd clapping along and it was a joy to get back to some form of normality.\n\n“You all just look like a big blur to me…” Says Marcantonio a few songs in, acknowledging he couldn’t make out just who’s in the room through the smoke in his eyes. Later he asked if we’ve missed getting in amongst it, having spent the pandemic stuck dancing in our living rooms awaiting this moment.\n\nHaving suggested their sound drifts between ‘Era Vulgaris‘ Queens of the Stone Age and The Beatles later works, first listen of new single ‘Sympathy Boy‘ suggested they were offering up something more akin to The Strokes. Fair enough – any reservations about a slight change in direction were put to bed early on, with their latest release sounding gigantic live, Godfrey laying down some tasty guitar work.\n\nYou can tell drummer Armstrong loves playing live and he’s long been one of our favourite parts of their shows – head back, eyes closed singing one minute to standing up off the stool and screaming into the back row the next. An utter powerhouse behind the kit, he led the way on building ‘Fake Satan‘ to stadium rock heights.\n\nThe undeniably catchy ‘Junk DNA‘ – an early QOTSA style rager – was a proper highlight and this time around, the lead stayed in Godfrey’s guitar (!) leaving Marcantonio to accidentally smash his microphone stand into the crowd. Luckily its caught by an out stretched hand as the bassist looked on in delight and carried on.\n\nThey let on that they would play us a few new ones – including their collective favourite – all of which we’ll have never heard (“you’re not gonna know, unless ya hacked us“). A trio of never before heard tracks are greeted with much favour and sound promising, the third particularly – a stonker of ‘Holy Doom‘ proportions. The new album is apparently coming on well but, as they jokingly tell us, the pandemic has well and truly fucked them release wise and they’re desperate to get it out.\n\nThey were able to get something together for new single ‘Hades, Baby‘ however, recently putting out a live recording at Abbey Road Studios with a full orchestra backing. Sadly we’re told there’s no orchestra on the night, but they’ll play it anyway. Hands in the air and the crowd are on every chorus for this cinematic Beatles-esque number and it sounded perfect in The Deaf Institute. I’ve never heard so many people singing ‘Tetrahedron‘…\n\nMarcantonio was thankful for everyone making the trip out, admitting he’s felt like half a person for the past year. Sadly there’s no Smiths cover to follow his ‘Half A Person‘ announcement (even in Manchester!), instead we’re hit with another recent single via the glam stomp of ‘Mother Machine‘.\n\n‘Be Your Man‘ finished it off – we’re told it’s definitely their last song (no mucking about), but they’re happy to jump behind the merch desk immediately afterward. The crowd almost became one with the early rumble of the closer, becoming unglued for the final time in the evening. “Get those fucking hands in the air Manchester!” Screamed Armstrong as a lad surfed triumphantly over the punters.\n\nFollowing 12+ months of no shows, we’ve so far managed to get out to a sit down affair and a bit of an experimental outing. This felt more like it, a right fucking go of it with all the hallmarks of live shows on offer. Judging by the queue for the merch desk, Demob Happy most certainly did the job tonight. Top marks.\n\nLike what you see? Why not stick around and check out the other articles and interviews!\n\nDon’t forget to follow Birthday Cake For Breakfast on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter!\n\nAs pitched by our Ben Forrester earlier this week, “Thank fuck for new music“. Our monthly playlist this time around came about between being free as a bird to being confined with the lockdown (kinda), finding musical inspirations from old favourites and new discoveries. A lot of it was enjoyed during government assigned exercise, getting out and about in nature and topping up ones Vitamin D.\n\nIf you’re finding it a struggle during these particularly tough times, i’d suggest getting out and about whenever you can and getting your head in order (maybe with help from the below playlist eh?)\n\n*UPDATE – Our playlist only sticks about for ONE MONTH before we move on. No regrets. You can listen to the latest playlist below!*\n\nRolling Blackouts Coastal Fever – Cars In Space\n\n(Sideways To New Italy)\n\nMore sun-soaked jams from one of our favourite Aussie outfits (what else!) Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever are experts in picking really long band names and knowing how to hit all the right spots and the first single from their forthcoming album is a mega jam. Love how their big singles seem to move at a right pace, propelling you through in heart-racing fashion.\n\nDisq – Daily Routine\n\n(Collector)\n\nA tip off from our Ben Forrester, Disq were a new one to me with the release of their new record ‘Collector‘. The undeniable hit that is ‘Daily Routine‘ has slacker pop and ‘the 90s’ written all over it and there’s even glimmers of Demob Happy towards the middle there. A total ripper on the quiet.\n\nPottery – Take Your Time\n\n(Welcome to Bobby’s Motel)\n\nFairly certain this was a “new one” from a session they did a while back. On hearing it, I was hypnotised. A frantic, revved up two parter of a song that is – yes, still hypnotic – I heard it again properly when I was cycling back from the dentist (how retro). From their proper debut album ‘Welcome to Bobby’s Motel‘, out this June (or even later, as it’s already been pushed back once…), it’s always good to hear something new from Pottery. The next single is even better than this one – more on that next month.\n\nLA Priest – What Moves\n\n(GENE)\n\nWhat better place to start than with a second album? Proper wonky-pop from LA Priest here (my introduction), from an album that came together whilst the LA Priest himself was working in isolation for more than two years between California, Wales and England’s south coast – like Cate Le Bon when she made ‘Reward‘ and a load of chairs at the same time. It got her a Mercury nom, so why not him?\n\nReal Estate – Paper Cup\n\n(The Main Thing)\n\nFull disclosure – I had it in my mind that Real Estate were a hardcore band, so it surprised me to see they’d had Sylvan Esso guest on their new record. ‘Paper Cup‘ is understandably not hardcore at all, instead it’s a super heart-swelling pop jam. I’ve just discovered the video too which has to be seen to be believed – The tale of Chipper, a giant animatronic squirrel during his last ever performance…\n\nViagra Boys – Common Sense\n\n(Common Sense)\n\nWho’da thunk it eh? That band that we once described as sounding like “an easier to digest Pissed Jeans” have popped out an anthemic 80’s sounding pop jam, the title track from a surprise EP that dropped a few weeks back. Not a change in sound entirely, as track two on the EP is a rough punk song about caning the dregs of a bag of the happy stuff (we’ve all been there…)\n\nSleaford Mods – Jobseeker\n\n(All That Glue)\n\nFrom their forthcoming greatest hits comp, ‘Jobseeker’ is the one that put their name on a lot of radars. Love the fury and the bite – “I suck on a rollup, pull your jeans up – fuck off!” The Jools Holland clip is here, obviously.\n\nTalking Heads – This Must Be The Place\n\n(Stop Making Sense)\n\nWas rushing out of work a few weeks back (before we were locked in our houses – what a thrill it would be to rush out of work again!) when I decided to stick this album on for the journey and all the stress seemed to melt away. Pop smasher from the best live album going.\n\nPrettiest Eyes – It Cost’s To Be Austere\n\n(Volume 3)\n\n2020 started off really slowly for us gigs wise. Now it’s screeched to a disappointing halt. Instagram live shows just don’t cut it… The last show I personally attended was back at the start of March, c/o Castle Face Records lot Prettiest Eyes. Leading up to the show and for a number of weeks afterwards, ‘It Cost’s To Be Austere‘ was firmly planted in my nut. Proper catchy.\n\nHarkin – Up To Speed\n\n(Harkin)\n\nOne of those that sounds like a classic radio pop smasher from the off, it’s no surprise given Katie Harkin (a.k.a. Harkin) has been rubbing shoulders/playing with the likes of Warpaint, Sleater-Kinney, Wild Beasts and Kurt Vile for years. First single ‘Up To Speed’, from her self-titled debut album as a solo entity, is a real gem.\n\nKatie recently talked to us all about inspirations, which you can read about here – from Texas hardcore to the late Bill Withers.\n\nProtomartyr – Processed By The Boys\n\n(Ultimate Success Today)\n\n2017’s critically acclaimed ‘Relatives In Descent’ took hold of us on release and we’ve been bitten by the Protomartyr bug ever since, beavering away through their back catalogue real horroshow. 2020 sees their return good and proper, with a full length scheduled for release once all this COVID-19 palaver is done with. ‘Processed By The Boys‘ is more stream of consciousness from vocalist Joe Casey, whilst the other lads play their nails blend of post-punk.\n\nGirl Band – Lawman\n\n(The Early Years)\n\nThis came on shuffle a few weeks back and almost knocked me out for its six minute duration. Something about Girl Band that just burrows inside you and really takes hold, leaving you either fist pumping the air or delirious and on your back.\n\nMayors Of Miyazaki – Your Street Team\n\nFrom a 7″ that arrived free with a recent USA Nails purchase, Mayors Of Miyazaki is a name i’ve seen referenced again and again but a band i’ve never listened to. I remember having to put the needle back on this one again and again, it’s so fucking good! Unsurprisingly a touch of of-its-time genius from – who else – USA Nails’ guitarist Gareth Thomas, who’s a dab hand at that sort of thing.\n\nMenace Beach – Tennis Court\n\n(Ratworld)\n\nGiven i’m having to spend a lot more time in the house, i’ve been rifling through records i’ve not listened to for a while. This has lead to getting bang into Menace Beach again, working backwards from later albums ‘Lemon Memory‘ and ‘Black Rainbow Sound‘ and into their past. ‘Tennis Court‘ was my first favourite Menace Beach number and that probably remains the case today. Love ’em.\n\nRobin Richards – Haga\n\n(The Earth Asleep)\n\nHaving been a massive Dutch Uncles fan for a number of years, I was eager to tuck into the solo output from bassist Robin Richards. A composer in his own right, he’s recently worked on the soundtrack to ‘The Earth Asleep’, a film about the 2011 Japanese Tsunami, drafting in Chris Illingworth of GoGo Penguin (on piano) and Michael Spearman of Everything Everything (on drums/percussion) for this particular number. End result? It definitely sounds like a Dutch Uncles b-side, which we’re more than up for!\n\nDinosaur Jr. – Feel The Pain\n\n(Without A Sound)\n\nAn old favourite, we had this come on via some other not-as-good playlist whilst sat in the living room as we were “working from home” a week into isolation. It perfectly soundtracked the sun-soaked afternoon, though I think I might’ve fucked my knuckles drumming away on the table…\n\nPOZI – Whitewashing\n\n(176)\n\nSleaford Mods posted about this lot the other day and I was chuffed – fingers crossed it gets more ears pricked up! It won’t have harmed them going on tour with Dry Cleaning at the start of the year either, and we were lucky enough to catch both bands a few months back before lockdown kicked off. A foot-shuffling, eerie sounding post-punk number, it tells tale of being stuck on a motorway journey with someone chipping away at you with their bigoted views.\n\nHome Counties – Redevelopment\n\nA bit of razor sharp yet wonky post-punk from the South, Home Counties evolved out of up and comers Haze and with debut single ‘Redevelopment‘ they spark off something that reminds us of DUDS and SQUID. A track to stick on again and again. Then once more before bed. Dead good.\n\nFlat Worms – The Aughts\n\n(Antarctica)\n\nNAILS new single from Flat Worms, taken from their latest album ‘Antarctica‘ – one which we suggested “isn’t just a flash in the pan punk set, it’s a fully formed rock record.” Building expertly to walls of fuzz and screeching guitar, it’s what got us hooked on this LA three-piece from the off.\n\nOnce and Future Band – Andromeda\n\n(Deleted Scenes)\n\nBloody love Once and Future Band – More poppy stadium-prog, please! ‘Andromeda‘ is an absolute delight and I dare any listener to not crack a smile during its four minute duration. We recently interviewed the quartet – get your chops round that here.\n\nLike what you see? Why not stick around and check out the other articles and interviews!\n\nDon’t forget to follow Birthday Cake For Breakfast on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter!\n\n2019 eh? You’d laugh if you weren’t too busy crying… Bloody good year for music though.\n\nThroughout the past 12 months we’ve been cracking on with uncovering new music, a keen ear amongst our contributors for anything and everything new and exciting. From a personal standpoint, I’ve probably purchased more new vinyl this year than any other (just the ticket when you’re about to move house…)\n\nWith it being the end of the year, we’ve joined the long list of your other favourite websites to compile the best songs released this year. 50 songs sounds like a lot to work with until you have to compile said list. With that in mind, honourable mentions and shout outs must go to a number of artists and singles that have been on our radar and in our playlists throughout the year.\n\nFrom the METZ reissue of ‘Pure Auto‘ to various songs from Mac DeMarco’s latest album ‘Here Comes The Cowboy‘, Show Me The Body’s raging ‘Camp Orchestra‘ to the mega dance number from Stealing Sheep in ‘Jokin’ Me‘. Then there’s Demob Happy’s ‘Less Is More’, False Advertising’s ‘You Won’t Feel Love‘, Grey Hairs‘ ‘Hydropona‘, Claw The Thin Ice’s ‘Tropic of Cancer‘ and ‘Looking For The Cure‘ from William The Conqueror. All great tunes, not enough space.\n\nHere’s the first of two parts featuring a list of the 50 best songs released this year – in my personal opinion, the person who puts all this together. In alphabetical order mind you, as things are complicated enough as it is don’t you think?\n\nAiming For Enrike – Hard Dance Brainia\n\n(Music For Working Out)\n\nWhere else to start than with experimental instrumental duo Aiming For Enrike out of Norway. An invigorating burst of dance-floor ready math-rock that builds and builds to a joyful climax. Almost as good as their live show.\n\nAiming For Enrike talked us through their 2019 musical highlights as part of our What’s On Michael Portillo’s iPod feature – Check out their picks here.\n\nB Boys – Pressure Inside\n\n(Dudu)\n\nA song that’s been on constant rotation from an album that has been listened to at least once a week since release (and then a month or two prior to that thanks to our review stream!) This trio of New Yorkers gripped me like no others this year – potential contender for best single of 2019!\n\nBike Thiefs – Hockey Dad\n\nToronto trio Bike Thiefs came new to us this year with the captivating ‘Hockey Dad‘ and its stream of consciousness vocals against scrappy instrumentation. At the time we suggested it’s in the ballpark of Flat Worms and Parquet Courts and we’re still feeling that comparison.\n\nBlood Wizard – Carcrash\n\nThe solo project of Cai from Kagoule, it’s no surprise that he hits the ground running with a song that already sounds like a bit of a classic. A sun-soaked jam out in November, but still one to enjoy in the colder months.\n\nBODEGA – Domesticated Animal\n\n(Shiny New Model)\n\nAnother cucumber cool bopper from NY art-punks BODEGA. A chorus that reminds me of the sort of team spirit mantra you might hear from a cheerleader outfit, it continues the great BODEGA tradition of being ludicrously catchy (as is everything else this lot put out).\n\nVocalist Ben talked us through his 2019 musical highlights as part of our What’s On Michael Portillo’s iPod feature – Check out his picks here.\n\nAlex Cameron – Stepdad\n\n(Miami Memory)\n\nThere were shades of it on last album ‘Forced Witness‘ and now with ‘Miami Memory’, Aussie songwriter Alex Cameron is blurring the line of comedic artist who pens a good tune to bona fide pop star. ‘Stepdad‘ is bleak at times but the bombastic instrumentation and Cameron’s knack for an earworm chorus mean it’s one to triumphantly sing along to.\n\nWe had the pleasure of interviewing Alex Cameron earlier this year – Check it out for yourself here.\n\nThe Chats – Pub Feed\n\n“MEDIUM WELL!” Snotty Aussie punk that’s as catchy as it is daft. A song about smashing your tea at the local pub, what’s wrong with that?\n\nCorridor – Domino\n\n(Junior)\n\nFrom their Sub Pop debut (the first francophone act for the prestigious label), Montreal outfit Corridor put out this sun-soaked 60’s sounding jam in the second half of the year and we’ve been hooked ever since. Following a lengthy hypnotising stretch in the middle, they expertly drop you back in with that swell hook in head-spinning fashion.\n\nCrack Cloud – The Next Fix\n\n(Pain Olympics)\n\nIn typical Crack Cloud fashion, fuck knows what’s happening with this (is it on an album coming out?!) They get weirder and more engaging as they go on and latest single ‘The Next Fix‘ is no exception. Follow up, Part Two of the Pain Olympics series (‘Crackin Up‘) is just as brilliant; the Canadian ‘multimedia collective’ remain one of the most exciting acts knocking about today.\n\nRichard Dawson – Two Halves\n\n(2020)\n\n‘Jogging‘ first grabbed our attention back in August, a hilariously bleak lengthy saga of someone struggling with anxiety from the little moments in life. It would have been included here had it not been for follow up single ‘Two Halves‘. A wonderfully captivating tale of what one assumes is a children’s football match and all its highs and lows and levels of incompetence. I laugh every time I hear a defeated Dawson sing “I am inconsolable” but the line “Stop fannying around, keep it nice and simple. You’re not Lionel Messi, just pass the bloody ball” is one of the best from an album full of terrific lines.\n\nDeliluh – Lickspittle (A Nut In The Paste)\n\n(Beneath The Floors)\n\nI’ve been listening to this record a lot while walking round the local park – big fan. First single ‘Lickspittle (A Nut In The Paste)‘ packs in a lot of influences but all at once sounds fresh and new.\n\nVocalist Kyle talked us through his 2019 musical highlights as part of our What’s On Michael Portillo’s iPod feature – Check out his picks here.\n\nDie! Die! Die! – Casualties of Decades\n\n(O)\n\nCrunchy as hell new single out mid-year from New Zealand punk leg-ends Die! Die! Die! From a new four-track EP, the first new material written with returning bassist Lachlan Anderson, ‘Casualties of Decades‘ is absolutely pummelling and the band sound as vital now as they might have ten years ago.\n\nWe spoke with 2/3 of Die! Die! Die! around the release of their new EP, which you can read here and here.\n\nDinosaur Pile-Up – Thrash Metal Cassette\n\n(Celebrity Mansions)\n\nDinosaur Pile-Up sure know how to write a raging lead single don’t they? A few year’s back they did it via the crushing ‘11:11‘ for the album (get this) ‘Eleven Eleven‘ and in 2019 they’ve once again knocked it out of the park with ‘Celebrity Mansions‘ lead single ‘Thrash Metal Cassette‘. Bigland and co. give a nod to their thrash heroes in throat-shredding fashion whilst still sticking to the DPU hallmarks of a dynamite singalong chorus.\n\nBaxter Dury – Slumlord\n\n(The Night Chancers)\n\nVery much a continuation of the sounds heard on last album ‘Prince of Tears‘ (a firm favourite following its 2017 release), Dury thrives in his character based showboating, bigging ones self up with a horrid, dingy undercurrent. As ever, the female vocal is the key here and sounds splendid in contrast to the crumbling bravado of Baxter.\n\nField Music – Money Is A Memory\n\n(Making A New World)\n\nFrom the album ‘Making A New World’ due out in early January – one which evolved from two very special live performances at Imperial War Museum’s Salford and London – ‘Money Is A Memory‘ is a funky romp that tells the tale of an office worker in the German Treasury working on the final instalment of reparation debts made in 2010, some 91 years after the Treaty of Versailles was signed… The brothers Brewis strike gold once again.\n\nFlat Worms – Into The Iris\n\n(Into The Iris)\n\nFuzz attack from California trio Flat Worms – That deadpan vocal still tickles our fancy and the raging closing stretch is perfect. What else would you expect from these three?\n\nThe Futureheads – Electric Shock\n\n(Powers)\n\nA favourite band returned in 2019, recharged and revitalised following a hiatus. A new album followed and was everything we’d hoped for, with ‘Electric Shock‘ being a delight tucked into the middle of the record. I’m a huge Barry Hyde fan and his vocal performance here is superb – filled with such emotion (for what was apparently a mishap in the kitchen!) The shouts of bassist Jaff and guitarist Ross in the chorus get the hairs standing to attention every time it’s played. Rager!\n\nWe had the pleasure of interviewing The Futureheads after all these years away – read that here.\n\nGauche – Flash\n\n(A People’s History of Gauche)\n\nGenius move from Gauche – combining my favourite aspects from two great post-punk bands (Daniele Yandel of Priests and Mary Jane Regalado of Downtown Boys) and forming a DC supergroup of sorts. In ‘Flash‘ we have a really vibrant, groovy dance-a-thon with arse-shaking in mind.\n\nGirl Band – Shoulderblades\n\n(The Talkies)\n\nI remember hearing this for the first time and being completely stuck to the spot for its six minute duration. I then had it on whilst I was cycling and was so hypnotised I’m surprised I didn’t come off… An incredibly energising yet unsettling piece of music from Irish noise outfit Girl Band.\n\nGrotbags – Big Baby\n\n(Grotbags)\n\nFrom the best Manchester boy band (with a female member), ‘Big Baby‘ tells the tale of a black pudding eating, triple-XL sized infant and is absolutely hilarious. The only issue is that i’ve lisened to it so much that it’s almost gone past the point of ‘hahaha, this is dead funny, this‘ to unconsciously singing it during the day. The new album is a peach and is already my favourite album of 2020.\n\nGuest Singer – New Experience\n\n(I’m Irrelevant Now)\n\nGuest Singer a.k.a. Jake Cope really reminds me of Alex Cameron. Not so much in appearance or the Aussie’s treading the ‘is this a piss-take?’ line, more-so in producing moody 80’s sounding synth-pop ragers that sound timeless. ‘New Experience‘ was the debut Guest Singer single released at the start of the year and was very much a hit the ground running moment for Jake and co.\n\nGuest Singer answered a host of daft questions for us as part of our a/s/l feature – Get your chops round that here!\n\nThe Hecks – Flash\n\n(My Star)\n\nMore 80’s vibes from Chicago outfit The Hecks, a band whose new album ‘My Star‘ has wormed its way into one of our favourites released this year. At the time of first hearing them, we described The Hecks sound as “quirky pop in an accessible, ludicrously catchy way similar to the likes of Flasher and Trouble In Mind alumni OMNI“. Listen to the closing stretch of ‘Flash‘ – A stroke of throwback, prog-y genius.\n\nInternational Teachers of Pop – I Stole Yer Plimsoles\n\nFeaturing the great Jason Williamson of Sleaford Mods, ‘I Stole Yer Plimsoles‘ is the latest arse-shaker from International Teachers of Pop, following the release of their debut album earlier this year. A massive pop tune, it sounds like the sort of thing you might have heard on the radio between the likes of ‘I’m Horny‘ or something from Madison Avenue back in the day.\n\nITOP Button-presser and knob-twitcher Adrian Flanagan talked us through his 2019 musical highlights as part of our What’s On Michael Portillo’s iPod feature – Check out his picks here.\n\nJulia Jacklin – Pressure To Party\n\n(Crushing)\n\nAustralian artist Julia Jacklin captured my heart earlier this year with the release of the wonderful ‘Pressure To Party‘ and the album that followed is a delight. Joyous instrumentation contrasts an almost cracking vocal as she sings of things one might be forced to do post-break up.\n\nKAPUTT – Accordion\n\n(Carnage Hall)\n\nIn our End of Year ‘What’s on Michael Portillo’s iPod‘ feature, Freddy of Leeds noise outfit THANK mentioned David Byrne when talking about Glaswegian outfit KAPUTT and I’ve not been able to shift it when listening to them. “FORWARD, FORWARD, I’m always looking FORWARD” sounds like something you might’ve heard during any Talking Heads period. ‘Accordion‘ is a banging little post-punk number from their debut on tastemaking label Upset The Rhythm.\n\n—\n\nFor those sorts who don’t read, you can listen to all of the above (and the forthcoming PART TWO) in our handy Spotify playlist here!\n\nLike what you see? Why not stick around and check out the other articles and interviews!\n\nDon’t forget to follow Birthday Cake For Breakfast on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter\n\nWhen news first broke of Demob Happy supporting Jack White on a number of shows across the UK, I was genuinely chuffed for them. A huge name, one who’d apparently picked them personally, with Demob Happy providing a sound that compliments his style/audience perfectly. The tour would even finish up with the trio joining White on stage at Edinburgh’s Usher Hall for an unplanned run through of The Dead Weather’s ‘I Cut Like A Buffalo’.\n\nCut to Sunday night just gone and Demob Happy are in Manchester, the first in a small run of headline shows throughout the UK. Sold out, naturally, their jaunt with Jack White late last year (and prior tours with Nothing But Thieves and Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes throughout America and Europe) has clearly put the word out – Demob Happy bring the goods, even on a Sunday evening.\n\nThe wall behind the stage at Soup Kitchen is covered by a giant velvet backdrop, with the band’s name lovingly stitched in huge white letters. A premature whoop is called out as bassist Matthew Marcantonio climbs onto stage, the vocalist quickly mouthing ‘Not yet’ as he pops his setlist down before disappearing backstage.\n\nIf there’s one thing that Demob Happy have in abundance, it’s riffs. Giant, meaty riffs. When it is time for them to take the stage, ’Succubus’ opens up the show – guitarist Adam Godfrey doing the honours and smashing it out of the gate with an instant face-melter. The crowd are on every word, whipped into a frenzy from the off and carrying it through into early single ‘Haat De Stank’. Vocalist Marcantonio is all smiles as the crowd sing back to him, drummer Thomas Armstrong on the other hand wild eyed, shouting like fuck on the chorus.\n\nMarcantonio recalls their history with Manchester, playing here previously and having only four people turn up – “…only about three weeks ago…”\n\nA different story tonight, clearly, and the crowd up front act accordingly on the arse-shaking, fuzzy ‘Loosen It’, looking lively and opening up the pit on ‘Spinning Out’ – a frantic cut from their last album, packing a proper wallop and calling to mind the gnarliness of ‘Songs For The Deaf’ era Queens of the Stone Age. The pit opens up again on ‘Junk DNA’, unfortunately losing some of its impact as the lead flies out of Godfrey’s guitar just as the intro boils over! He more than makes up for it though, nailing the blistering guitar part throughout and blessing my ear plugs with a crunching breakdown.\n\nAt one stage, drummer Armstrong plugs in his own guitar whilst bassist Marcantonio drops down to keys on ‘Holy Doom’, for a hushed version of their last album’s title track.\n\n“That was fucking awkward…” He says, telling us that when Demob Happy was starting out, he used to play piano on stage but this was the first time in yonks. ‘Fresh Outta Luck’ follows in a similar hushed style and whilst I don’t dislike it, it personally takes me out of it a bit. it seems like it would be more impactful on a larger stage and in the context of the tour – working out stuff on smaller stages, seeing what works – it makes sense. The crowd are into it too.\n\n“We’ve been doing this for ten years, this is nice to see.” Announces Marcantonio, gesturing to the packed out room before them. The high praise is enough to have the crowd go batty on the storming ‘Be Your Man’ and some lad is turned thoroughly upside down and inside out as he surfs above the crowd. With Beatles-esque harmonies littered throughout the set, the blitz through of ‘Helter Skelter’ in the middle of ‘Be Your Man’ is a neat nod of the head before a crushing close. Security come in to take down crowd surfers toward the end but it’s too little too late as Godfrey himself throws himself off stage, becoming one with the sweaty revellers in the front row, flying above heads as fuzz permeates the room.\n\nSince the release of ‘Holy Doom’, Demob Happy have looked like the real deal, absolutely cementing this in Manchester with banger after banger laid on thick to a devoted, riff-hungry audience. With new material sounding just as gnarly as their first two records – their massive new single ‘Less Is More’ flying the flag – it feels like they’re setting themselves up for a big year.\n\nLike what you see? Why not stick around and check out the other articles and interviews!\n\nDon’t forget to follow Birthday Cake For Breakfast on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter!\n\nFollowing on from our Top 50 list released earlier this year, we’ve had our thinking caps on and put together another 50 favourites that have had us hooked for the remainder of 2018!\n\nDon’t be daft – Keep an eye on our lists to come and make sure you don’t miss out on some of the year’s biggest bangers!\n\nDemob Happy – ‘Loosen It’ (Holy Doom, SO Recordings)\n\nA proper sexy affair this – from their latest record ‘Holy Doom’, a comparison I once heard put it that they’re full on ‘Era Vulgaris’ Queens of the Stone Age, which I think gets you in the right frame of mind. Dirt riffs and a whopper of a chorus – The latter half of the year since its release has seen Demob Happy out on tour with that lad out of The White Stripes (!) and it’s 100% deserved. Massive fan.\n\nSleaford Mods – ‘Stick In A Five and Go’ (Sleaford Mods, Rough Trade)\n\nVery much the Sleaford Mods blueprint (no bad thing), this packs stellar beats from Andrew Fearn (him behind the laptop) and a piss-funny, sing-song tale from vocalist Jason Williamson (him up front). Humorous little tale about Twitter beefs (with someone he doesn’t know – from Leeds) and confrontations thereafter – in disguise as a postman.\n\nInternational Teachers Of Pop – ‘Age of the Train’\n\nDebut single from new (self-described) ‘Nerd Disco’ project, featuring Adrian Flanagan + Dean Honer (The Moonlandingz, Eccentronic Research Council) and Leonore Wheatley (Whyte Horses), which brings to mind than Indian ‘Thriller’ knockoff from the 80’s in terms of that hard hitting, punchy beat.\n\nBas Jan – ‘Instant Nostalgia’ (Instant Nostalgia EP, Lost Map)\n\nLove the quirks of Bas Jan – Offbeat pop coupled with the captivating and often anxious vocal of multi-instrumentalist and composer Serafina Steer, seemingly mostly off the cuff and improvised. Elsewhere the EP humorously deals in the horrors of acceptance through social media in ‘Profile Picture’, which is well worth a listen.\n\nTy Segall – ‘I’m A Man’ (Fudge Sandwich, In the Red Records)\n\nTrust Ty to never, ever stop. One of his many releases this year, this time he’s got an LP full of covers but boy – doesn’t he just make them his own? The first single from ‘Fudge Sandwich’ is a ripping cover of The Spencer Davis Group staple ‘I’m A Man’. Groovy as you like.\n\nTerry – ‘Carpe Diem’ (I’m Terry, Upset The Rhythm)\n\n‘C’est la vie, don’t I know it’\n\nDescribed by our lass as having an intro that sounds like ‘the theme tune for a podcast’ (harsh), I had a minor obsession with this a few months back following a minor obsession with Australian comedy shows Dreamland and Kath & Kim. Oddball pop – C’est la vie, don’t I know it.\n\nBlack Midi – ‘Bmbmbm‘ (speedywunderground)\n\nThe talk of London town this year (at least that’s what we’ve heard from up here in the North), Black Midi have built up a bit of a reputation through word of mouth via blistering live shows. Their first single is this driving, head-fuck of a single with a frantic, gibberish vocal that makes you feel like you’re stuck in a toilet cubicle with someone off their nut. Big things expected.\n\nDrahla – ‘Twelve Divisions of the Day’\n\n(Captured Tracks)\n\nBig year for Drahla, who’ve just signed to Brooklyn based tastemaker label Captured Tracks. ‘Twelve Divisions Of The Day’ follows a number of single releases they’ve had these past few years, bringing out more of their frantic, teetering on a knife-edge, post-punk sound.\n\nTVAM – ‘Psychic Data’ (Psychic Data)\n\nLocal lad TVAM has been doing the rounds with many an End of Year list on debut LP ‘Psychic Data’ and it’s the title track from said album that gripped us when putting this list together. With a little help in the mixing department from Dean Honer (The Moonlandingz, Eccentronic Research Council), the opener from his impressive debut is a throbbing, shoegaze-y thrill.\n\nSauna Youth – ‘Unreal City’ (Deaths, Upset The Rhythm)\n\nTwo minutes of riveting, head-nodding punk from cucumber cool LDN quartet Sauna Youth. From their latest record ‘Deaths’, the last in a trilogy of albums, the dual deadpan vocals really hit the spot.\n\nLike what you see?

There had been a few bands prior, sure, but our time up until their mid-afternoon arrival was spent struggling with an incredibly confusing three-man tent set up and preparing Bloody Mary’s…\n\nThe perfect festival band for getting the mood right up, the last time we’d caught them was a bit closer to home at a bar on Liverpool’s Smithdown Road. The energy that night matched the energy dished out on the Trees main stage, with the quartet well up for it regardless of location and crowd size. The crowd too were mega responsive, especially so on ‘Two Hands’ mega-hits ‘Solid Gold’ and ‘Rabbits Foot’ – bouncing as high as possible throughout the mighty choruses.\n\nFrom the fist-pumping energy of the main stage to up-in-your-face intensity across the site at The Cave, frantic, shouty hardcore-punk face-shifters Turnstile were our first surprise of the weekend.\n\n“Let’s shake this whole place up!” called out frontman Brendan Yates, opening up the congregation before them to scramble on top of one another as bodies littered the landscape in front of the stage. This Yates character is easy to love – chucking out cartwheel kicks and hurling the microphone into the crowd at one point. Passionate as fuck and built like a shithouse, he lead the rest of the band into really getting the crowd alive.\n\nThursday headliners came bigger than ever in the form of El Paso’s own At The Drive-In – A band who’ve been eagerly anticipated at 2000 Trees for a number of years within our camp. It was straight to the front for us too as no one else had seemingly gotten the memo. Obviously this soon changed however when the stirring beginnings of ‘Arcarsenal’ kicked everything off. Vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala is all over the shop in classic fashion, exactly what you want of a headliner – launching himself off speakers and twirling his mic stand around his head. He would jump into incomprehensible introductions prior to a number of tunes, all of which we couldn’t quite decipher (apart from “Cut your nails, wash your ass…” prior to ‘One Armed Scissor’…)\n\nOmar Rodríguez-López doesn’t look 100% arsed it must be said, but fellow guitarist Keeley Davis shines through on ‘Governed By Contagions’. A mid-set reveal of a different backdrop was a fancy addition and for the most part, the Thursday night headline slot was made up of a lot of smashers, though peppered with a fair few not-so smashers (and some middling bits). Still though, At The Drive-In playing to a massive audience in a field in Cheltenham? Worth it.\n\nLate Friday morning and it’s Bloody Mary’s for breakfast – A new festival tradition for certain (and probably the liquid based highlight of the weekend!) Following on from Turnstile’s introduction the afternoon before, a new discovery was had early on Friday via the aptly named Neu Stage in the form of No Violet. Making their 2000 Trees debut, the four-piece out of Bristol quickly whipped up a growing, appreciative audience through a number of tightly played, fuzzy head-bobbers.\n\nHighlights came out of vocalist Ellie putting in a right shift, dipping between howls and delicate phases whilst bassist Kerry put out some stonking bass action, later switching instruments with Ellie and shredding like mad at the set’s heavy conclusion.\n\nElsewhere, it was heartwarming to see the Forest so rammed for the Scott Hutchison tribute. A special place in its own right, the intimate space tucked away past all the main stages played host to a notable afternoon in Frightened Rabbit history.\n\nBack at The Axiom, the Manchester representation was on show through PINS who rocked the 100% sunglasses indoors vibe. An absolute belter of a double drumming kick off made way for a right big fuck off riff from guitarist Lois and lead to a set full of arse-shakers. Nice to see a fashionable band knocking about a festival site rather than the usual crop and it was also a minor relief for a spot of rain during their set, especially given the heatwave. Bringing that Mancunian weather with them, PINS were a welcome change amongst the line-up.\n\nThen the rain stopped and out came And So I Watch You From Afar and Ho99o9 to play. Two different beasts entirely, both outfits got the crowd going ecstatic. Whilst the front of stage crowd at ASIWYFA bumped into each other and held inflatable bananas aloft, the congregation within The Cave were full on going mad inside the tent to the powerhouse drumming and unpredictability of Messrs Eaddy and theOGM.\n\nThe passion shown by both ASIWYFA and Ho99o9 is undeniable, with the former always looking like just crafting these songs is really taking it out of them, whilst the latter hit every point on the stage, leaving no stone unturned in their quest to put on a head-exploding live show. theOGM, seen earlier that day knocking about the backstage area in a bloody Blade Trinity leather jacket (!) took out his phone and began documenting the manic conclusion of the Ho99o9 set, concluding in Eaddy popping a backflip as the cherry on top. What A Rush!\n\nSaturday morning and having woken up in an actual oven, we moved through tired bodies and coffee-perked-punters to The Axiom for Croydon duo Frauds. Riffs were on the breakfast menu (as we’d run out of tomato juice at this point), with Frauds providing gnarly noise in the form of ‘Sandwiches’ to open up their noise heavy set. Beardy, shouty and noisy, we’re told by drummer Chris that 2000 Trees is “…better than my bedroom”, and the pummelling ‘Suck Jobs’, a song about hen’s and stag’s, was a headache reducing highlight.\n\nOn it continued with more Southerners on the same stage – Swedish Death Candy – chucking out a right load of riffs, filling the Ty Segall/Oh Sees sized gap in the Trees line-up/my heart. Fast and loud, I got completely lost at one stage in a lengthy, wigging out stoner-slog, spat out the other end in satisfying style. Another stomping discovery throughout the weekend.\n\nBig Scary Monsters were showcased throughout the afternoon in spectacular fashion through Gender Roles and Chicago’s brilliant Meat Wave. Brighton’s Gender Roles provided piss funny “banter” (coupled with some astonishing facts about trees across the globe) inbetween some cracking, fist-pumping tunes, whilst Meat Wave highlighted why they’re one of the most exciting bands knocking about today. Whilst they might not be great at pouring pints (as evidenced by their brief stint behind the bar for Signature Brew), their wall-to-wall array of bangers more than made up for it.\n\n‘Delusion Moon’ howled out as we smashed through the remainder of our Bloody Mary stock for the weekend and eased into the early evening. A major highlight from their latest record ‘The Incessant’,‘Leopard Print Jet Ski’, has the daftest of riffs creating a dance-a-thon amongst a group of kids at the front, straight into the crushing stomp of ‘Bad Man’. A mid-set gift of Buckfast for frontman Chris Sutter was more than deserved.\n\nElsewhere, early Saturday evening highlights were on offer from Demob Happy and GALLOPS, the latter dishing up dance-y gems from their latest record ‘Bronze Mystic’ whilst the former were on fuzz-soaked form. Demob Happy emerged from rumbling beginnings and hip swinging boogie-woogie, with absolute ragers from the word go. There’s talk of hangovers and getting over them. I felt that. Some utter chunky riffs here – the lad’s full of them, particularly on the dirty groove of ‘Loosen It’. Drummer Tom Armstrong’s hilarious guttural shouts throughout were a notable highlight amongst ‘Era Vulgaris’-esque floor-fillers.\n\n“It’s weird they don’t sing, innit?” said someone during GALLOPS, which made me smile almost as much as their mind-melting closer ‘Darkjewel’ – A heavy electronic head-fuck across 7+ minutes.\n\nWhilst it only comes but once a year, 2000 Trees really is a special occasion and a notable must-do when it comes to festival season. A lot of the joy comes through discovery and much like Refused before them a few years back, Enter Shikari – a band I’d never really paid much attention to – were a terrific closer. Never been? Why not give it a try – you might come away with some new favourites.\n\nLike what you see?

Remember when Myspace was a thing? Remember those time-wasting, laborious quizzes that everyone used to love so much? Birthday Cake For Breakfast is bringing them back!\n\nEvery couple of weeks, an unsuspecting band will be subject to the same old questions about dead bodies, Hitler, crying and crushes.\n\nThis week: With 2000 Trees Festival almost upon us, we’ve asked a number of our top picks to answer these solid questions.

Why not stick around and check out the other articles and interviews!\n\nDon’t forget to follow Birthday Cake For Breakfast on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter!\n\nFollowing on from our Top 50 songs of 2K17 earlier this year (which you can view here, here, here, here and… here), we decided to have a look back throughout the year to put together another Top 50 tracks that we’ve been salivating over. Don’t say we don’t spoil you.\n\nBaxter Dury – ‘Oi’ (Prince Of Tears, Heavenly Recordings)\n\n‘You borrowed my bike forever’\n\nHarking back to a challenging childhood friendship, this blinding ditty from the latest Baxter Dury record excels in its imagery. Hilarious lyrically, the drawl of Baxter captivates.\n\nFrauds – ‘Suck Jobs‘ (With Morning Toast & Jam & Juice, Till Deaf Do Us Party)\n\nAbsolute stonker of a riff, huge chorus and a piss-funny vocal delivery. This absolute beast comes as part of Frauds’ brutal debut LP ‘With Morning Toast & Jam & Juice’.\n\nDuds – ‘Elastic Feel’’ (Of A Nature Or Degree, Castle Face Records)\n\nAnother appearance from Duds, this time the first single announced from their debut album ‘Of A Nature Or Degree’. Being the first UK band to join the Castle Face Records family, the tightrope-tense ‘Elastic Feel’ opened up Duds to a wider audience. Lucky then that they knocked it out of the park. Vital.\n\nLCD Soundsystem – ‘how do you sleep?’ (American Dream, DFA Records)\n\nThe perfect LCD Soundsystem jam, this. On a recent holiday in Munich, this became a bit of an anthem. An unreal build throughout its 9 minutes.\n\nDaniele Luppi & Parquet Courts – ‘Pretty Prizes’ (Milano, Columbia)\n\nYou’ve got to quench that Parquet Courts thirst somehow, right? Chuck Karen O into the mix and you’ve got this delightful little back and forth under Italian composer Daniele Luppi (he of Gnarls Barkley ‘Crazy’ fame).\n\nDemob Happy – ‘Be Your Man’ (Holy Doom, SO Recordings)\n\nVery much channelling mid-noughties Queens of the Stone Age and – dare I say it, The Beatles – Demob Happy bring out all the swagger on ‘Be Your Man’. Packed full of gnarly riffs this one.\n\nMETZ – ‘Cellophane’ (Strange Peace, Sub Pop Records)\n\nProper catchy bit of pulverising noize from usual suspects METZ. Taken from their new record ‘Strange Peace’, the New Yorker’s hooked up with Albini on this one to capture their raucous sound as it should be.\n\nMush – ‘Luxury Animals’ (Art Is Hard Records)\n\nSoon to become a household name, Leeds quartet Mush add a little dash of Britpop flavouring into their garage-rock sound on latest single ‘Luxury Animals’. This builds into a total ripper, believe me!\n\nAnd So I Watch You From Afar – ‘A Slow Unfolding Of Wings’ (The Endless Shimmering, Sargent House)\n\nAn absolute stonker of a tune from Northern Ireland’s And So I Watch You From Afar, ‘‘A Slow Unfolding Of Wings’ captures the quartet at their most epic. Joyous and uplifting, it’s an instant hit from their latest record ‘The Endless Shimmering’.\n\nJOHN – ‘Local Blood Sport’ (Too Pure Singles Club)\n\nCarrying on the tradition of really horrid, loud bands on the Too Pure Singles Club, ‘Local Blood Sport’ is a super distorted assault from JOHN, our favourite duo from Crystal Palace. A perfect accompaniment to their debut album ‘God Speed In The National Limit’ (which also came out this year).\n\nLike what you see? Why not stick around and check out the other articles and interviews!\n\nDon’t forget to follow Birthday Cake For Breakfast on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter!\n\nI always love walking into a venue to see a band in full swing, with a crowd absolutely gagging for it. Last night at Sound Control in Manchester, Demob Happy had this nailed on. More like a perfectly choreographed scene from a film than a room full of people escaping a piss-wet Saturday night, the massive crowd had already gathered up front to witness this Brighton based trio bash out an assortment of grungey numbers soaked in sleaze. Looking every bit a rock and roll band, but with a catalogue full of roaring belters to back it up.\n\nNew single ‘Be Your Man’, which recently had its premiere on Huw Stephens’ BBC Radio 1 show, was one of the many on show last night taken from their impending new album out next year. Bringing with it all the swagger of Queens Of The Stone Age in their more psychedelic moments, the supremely catchy single had the kids up front bouncing, pure loving it.\n\nI bumped into Josh of False Advertising during their set (because I can’t take credit), who likened Demob Happy to a British ‘Lullabies To Paralyse’, which is possibly the highest praise i’d say you can receive!\n\nThere were rumblings of a ‘DPU’ chant as Dinosaur Pile-Up set up on stage, with this soon being elevated to heavy chanting just moments prior to their proper arrival. With their 2014 LP ‘Nature Nurture’ recently getting the vinyl re-release treatment, it was expected that the set would be littered with songs from their sophomore album. What we were surprisingly treated to was not only the expected Nature Nurture numbers, but also a whole host of nostalgic cuts from their oeuvre. Saturday night in Manchester was hit central; a setlist of champions.\n\n‘Birds & Planes’ was quite the surprising intro for everyone in the room, so much so that an elated group couldn’t contain themselves and took it upon themselves to get the circle pit going real horror show. It was soon followed up in quick fashion by ‘My Rock ‘n’ Roll’ in all its head-banging glory, the second of the evening already to be taken from their debut LP ‘Growing Pains’.\n\nFrontman Matt Bigland announced that Saturday night in Manchester “…isn’t a show, it’s a fucking party” and sure enough, the crowd were fully up for everything dished out throughout the evening. ‘Red and Purple’, from their latest LP ‘Eleven Eleven’, sounded nearly arena ready, with the place going off like a rocket. Also from the album, ‘Friend Of Mine’ and ‘Anxiety Trip’ had an outing, the former bringing out the mass singalongs, with the brutal noise of the latter causing mass pitting.\n\nElsewhere, it was mainly all about that sweet nostalgia, with particular highlights in the anthemic ‘Arizona Waiting’ (more mass singalongs), ‘Peninsula‘ (complete with that spectacular little Top Gear riff), ‘White T-Shirt and Jeans’ and ‘Mona Lisa’. Prior to the arrival of the monumental ’11:11’, ‘Nature Nurture’ used to be the go home song, so it was cool to hear it tucked into the set, but still sounding just as raucous as ever. The crowd still sang out the chorus long after it had finished.\n\nIn a slightly terrifying state of affairs, people began to sing the opening of ‘Summer Of 69’ during what turned out to be the solo intro of ‘Derail’. An odd moment indeed, mainly due to the recent spate of celebrity deaths and the possibility that Bryan Adams had croaked it!\n\nWith the early days very much being the theme of the evening, ‘Beach Bug’, from their debut ‘The Most Powerful E.P in the Universe!!’, was a welcome surprise. Matt joked that it had to be a team effort, being unlikely to remember the words if the crowd didn’t help sing along. Thankfully for the trio on stage, the mere mention of the track had the room going wild, with participation off the charts. Similarly, having returned for an encore, it was the turn of ‘Hey You’ from Growing Pains that had hands in the crowd high in the air, some brandishing flickering lighters.\n\nHaving put on a succession of super hits, it was during the encore that Dinosaur Pile-Up decided to mix it up and jump straight into a completely unexpected cover of ‘Say It Ain’t So’, a nod to their garage rock roots and their support slots for Weezer in recent years. This was easily one of the main highlights, being most unexpected from an evening full of surprises. It was soon followed by the least surprising song choice of the night, but quite rightly so – 11:11 had the room descending into utter chaos. Mass pitting, folk crowd surfing and Bigland screaming his heid aff. A perfect finale.\n\nMatt made a comment at one stage about their time away and seemingly never-ending tour of the states, bringing it all back home and suggesting how thankful they are to be able to return to the UK and especially Manchester (keen to highlight that this was not just your every night show patter!) With last night’s performance being possibly the best I’ve ever witnessed from them, here’s hoping we see a lot more of Dinosaur Pile-Up in future!\n\nLike what you see?
