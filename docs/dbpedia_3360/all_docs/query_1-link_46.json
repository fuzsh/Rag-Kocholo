Nothing can be allowed to detract from the concentration of national energy necessary to win a complete victory over the enemy at the earliest possible moment. The army of production takes its place, along with the armed forces, in this concentrated effort. Nevertheless, a knowledge of the relative and absolute magnitudes of the mobiliza­ tion of manpower and economic forces involved in this war requires that, behind the scenes, serious thought be given to the problems of returning the soldier and the industrial worker to peacetime activities. The same necessity existed in the first World War. Study of the problem of demobilization of the soldiers was not begun until a month before the end of the war, however, and then the need for haste resulted in mistakes that might have been avoided under more leisurely planning and consideration. No program was adopted for the effective passing of the industrial worker to peacetime production. The inevitable appearance of unforeseen problems which arose during demobilization at the close of the first World War will repeat itself at the close of this war. Further, the task will be much greater; the number of men will be three times as large as in 1918-19 and soldiers from the United States will have served longer and in more combat areas, so that the period of their demobilization may be longer than was the case after World War I. The magnitude of current industrial production is a forecast of the problems of transition and contraction. For these reasons it seems probable that that earlier experience may be of value in planning the gigantic task of demobilization that lies ahead. The present article, which relates solely to the demobili­ zation of the soldiers, reviews the four proposals for the return of servicemen to peacetime pursuits that were advanced in that earlier war period, showing where they originated, who supported them, and their respective merits and disadvantages. When the first World War came to an abrupt end with the signing of the Armistice on November 11, 1918, the armed services of the United States had been expanded from a peacetime force of about 380,000 to almost 5,000,000. About 3,700,000 of these, constituting the “ emergency army” (that is, those enlisted or inducted during the war), were eligible for immediate discharge when the war ended. Official consideration of plans for the discharge and return of these men to civil life had been started a month before the Armistice. (l) 2 This left far too little time for adequate preparations for so compli­ cated a task. The method finally adopted was the traditional plan for demobilization by military organizations. The military authori­ ties favored this plan and it was the only one for which regulations and administrative procedures could be quickly developed at so late a date. However, three other plans had been advanced, proposing demobili­ zation (a) by industrial needs or occupations, (b) by locality, through the use of the local or regional draft boards, and (c) by length of service. (a) The first plan, demobilization by occupation, had been adopted originally by the British, but proved to be so unfeasible that new legislation was passed, allowing the men to be withdrawn on the general basis of length of service. In both Great Britain and the United States it was civilians who proposed and supported the occupational-demobilization plan. The plan’s proponents in the United States recognized that, to be success­ ful, it must be predicated upon an exhaustive analysis of the indus­ trial situation of the country, especially if it was to be used for pro­ viding employment for skilled and unskilled discharged soldiers, many of whom had developed new proficiencies during their service and would not wish to return to their old occupations. Such an analysis had not been made. Another major defect of the plan was its disregard of the instinctive individualism of the average American and of the fact that regimen­ tation after return to civil life would prove distasteful. This demobil­ ization system was carefully reviewed by the General Staff but ulti­ mately rejected. (b) The second method, that of using draft-board machinery for facilitating discharge, was developed by the Provost Marshal General who had been closely connected with the operation of these boards during the war. He argued that the local communities could do more than any other agency to reestablish the released soldier. He insisted that the problem oi “ finding the job for the men and of re­ plenishing industry and agriculture at the point of depletion” could best be done on a local scale. His plan was favored by many civilian groups who thought that if the men were returned to the communities from which they came they would be more readily drawn into the economic life of these areas and this, in turn, would relieve the situation in the large indus­ trial cities near debarkation camps, where there would inevitably be a brief period of great unemployment as the munitions plants reverted to peacetime production. The Provost Marshal General’s proposal was forwarded to the Sec­ retary of War and then to the Chief of Staff. However, the militaryunit demobilization plan had already been adopted and announced, and it was then too late to utilize even the best features of the draftboard plan. The value of many of the aspects of the draft-board plan became apparent during the winter and spring of 1919 when the War Depart­ ment was besieged by citizens of all classes urging that the released soldiers be withdrawn from the industrial centers which were also faced with the problem of dealing with thousands of unemployed 3 war workers for whom the Federal Government had provided no means of carry-over from wartime to civilian employment. (c) The third method, discharge by length of service, was rejected for valid reasons. The country had been at war for only 18 months, and the majority of the men had been in service a year or less. It was important that the men in France, regardless of period of serv­ ice, should be returned to this country as soon as possible. Review of these several proposed systems of demobilization leads to the conclusion that it was regrettable that plans could not have been perfected far enough ahead of the need for their application to have incorporated the best and most feasible features of each. This would have required the sympathetic cooperation of the professional soldiers, familiar with military procedure, and the trained civilian groups which were familiar with the industrial and economic needs of the country. Expansion o f the A rm y The story of demobilization of the Army after the first World War cannot be intelligently evaluated without some knowledge of the expansion of the Army to its size at the time of the Armistice. The United States has never maintained a large standing Army, because of its geographical situation and its amicable relations with its neigh­ bors on the North American continent. For protection from foreign aggression, this country has depended upon a strong Navy. The American people were loath to accept the inevitability of participation in the World War of 1914-18. When the United States entered the war in April 1917, therefore, it was unprepared from both a military and an industrial standpoint. The achieve­ ments of supply of manpower and material during the following 18 months were striking and at that time unparalleled. On April 1, 1917, just prior to the entrance of this country into the war, the personnel of the armed forces of the United States num­ bered 378,619. Of these, 291,880 were in the Army. Immediately following the declaration of war on April 6, enlistment was accelerated and was heavy throughout April, May, and June. From the beginning of hostilities the American military experts declared themselves in favor of the “ selective draft” as the only democratic method for increasing the size of the Army. They empha­ sized that it would distribute the burden of combat equitably through all areas of the population, all social levels, and all occupational groups. A bill to provide for “ selective service” was introduced into Congress almost immediately after the declaration of war. It was not a popular bill, being termed “ the Administration’s program of conscription.” However, it became a law on May 18, 1917. The act called for the registration of all men “ between the ages of 21 and 30 years, both inclusive,” but with the proviso that men should be drafted only if voluntary enlistments did not provide the 500,000 additional men needed immediately. It differed from similar acts of the Civil War in that no bounty could be offered to induce enlist­ ments. Altogether, 9,780,535 men responded to this .first registration, held on June 5, 1917. This number proved inadequate for the rapidly increasing military demands, partly because of the number of deferments and exemptions which greatly reduced the number 4 of effectives in Class I, available for military service. Another limita­ tion was the limitation of the age requirements for military service. On M ay 20, 1918, Congress passed a Joint Resolution requiring registration of men reaching the age of 21 after June 5, 1917, and authorizing the President to require further registrations. Under this resolution there were two registrations, totaling 10,679,814. It was from these early registrations that all inductions into active service were made. It became evident by the summer of 1918 that the expanded mili­ tary campaign proposed for the spring of 1919 would require many more men than were available from the above groups. Therefore Congress in August 1918 extended the age limits for military service' to include men between the ages of 18 and 45, inclusive, but the Armistice came before any of the 13,229,762 men registered under the amendment were inducted. The gradual expansion of the armed forces between April 1, 1917, and the Armistice in November 1918 is shown in the accompanying table.

Troops Eligible fo r Discharge at T im e o f A rm istice Only the “ emergency army,” made up of men enlisted or inducted during the war, was eligible for immediate discharge. What is more, some of the inducted men were en route to camp when the fighting ceased and so were little affected by the problems of demobilization. When the Armistice came, this new emergency army was concen­ trated in two big groups, consisting of the forces still in cantonments in the United States, and the American Expeditionary Force in France. Small numbers were stationed in the insular possessions and in Siberia.

Annual Report of tbe Secretary of W ar, 1919, V ol. I, Part I, p. 448. 3, 703, 273 100. 0* 5 Initial Steps Toward Demobilization The Secretary of War commented in his annual report in 1919: “ The problem of demobilization of United States forces was different from that of other countries since its pivotal or key men had not been withdrawn from industry nor had its manpower been drafted to the same extent as those of our Allies.” 2 However, later events indicated that, even so, demobilization could not be satisfactorily accomplished without definite plans developed well ahead of their need. The Secretary himself said, “ The first steps in demobilization were taken while the policy itself was being formulated.” 3 The first move toward demobilization made by the General Staff was on October 8, 1918, just a month before the Armistice. It was then suggested that, because of the enormous expense connected with the military establishment and the desirability of a speedy return to normal economic conditions, repatriation and demobilization of the armed forces should be accomplished with the least practicable delay. At about the same time an informal note was sent to the head of the Army War College: “ There are one or two questions it seems to me should be studied and worked out so that you shall be good and ready for any contingency. The first of these is the plan for demobili­ zation and musters out. * * * I do not want to advertise it too much at present as it might be thought to be peace propaganda.” 45 The War Plans Division immediately began a study of “ plans.” Expedition was urged, since other divisions would need to review the final report, but even then great secrecy was urged.6 Aside from the development of general policies it was necessary for each branch of the service (motor transport, signal corps, engineers, chemical warfare, services of supply) to make its own specific plans. The formal report to the Chief of Staff analyzing the various pro­ posals for demobilization and making recommendations as to general procedures was not forwarded until 10 days after the Armistice, but undoubtedly major decisions had been reached earlier. No de­ mobilization plan adopted would have been universally acceptable, but this lack of preparedness and its results brought continuing criticism from every quarter. Proposed M ethods o f Dem obilization The General Staff reviewed four distinctly different policies for the demobilization of the soldiers at the close of World War I. One was accepted, and three were rejected. The method adopted, that of discharge by military units, is a matter of record. The public is less familiar with the other three plans. They proposed demobilization (a) by industrial needs or occupations, (b) by locality (through the use of the local or regional draft boards), and (c) by length of service. These methods separate themselves into those originating in civilian groups, whether or not they were in the civil establishments of the Federal Government or attached to the War Department; and those * Annual Report of the Secretary of W ar, 1919; Vol. I, Part I, p. 14. * Idem, p. 453. 4 A rm y War College files, Chief of Operations, General Staff, to President, A rm y War College. 5 Idem, Chief of Operations’ Memorandum of October 16,1918. 589966°— 44------2 6 supported by the professional military groups in the offices of the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant General, or the Provost Marshal General. The civilian programs were the result of investigation and careful consideration by two separate but sympathetic groups. The first open approach to the demobilization problem was through the civilian experts who were working with the War Department on personnel classification. This group included outstanding psy­ chologists and personnel administrators, most of whom were in uniform and working closely with Army officers in the Adjutant GeneraPs office. The second civilian group consisted of economists and executives in the Department of Labor (chiefly in the War Labor Policies Board and the U. S. Employment Service) and in the War Industries Board. There was frequent conference and interchange of ideas among the various civilian groups, but there is little evidence of any genuine effort at mutual understanding between these groups and the military strategists in the War Department. There is, however, considerable evidence that each group pressed its proposals upon the Secretary of War, himself a civilian. DEMOBILIZATION BY INDUSTRIAL NEEDS OR OCCUPATION The civilians, both in the established Government departments and in the emergency war agencies, were deeply conscious of the difficult economic, industrial, and fiscal situation which would con­ front the country with the cessation of production for war, and the inevitable interval of uncertainty as the industries of the Nation took stock and made their essential readjustments of program, plant, and personnel. There was an undisputed need for an ex­ tensive and intensive survey of the country’s industries, of their ability to return promptly to peacetime production and so keep to a minimum the unemployment attending the transition period. The civilians’ study of these questions led them to the conclusion that “ the rate of absorption [of labor] into industry is the active and variable factor in the demobilization problem.” 6 It was logical therefore that a proposal for industrial demobilization based upon industrial needs should gain their support. British plan.— The details of such a plan had been worked out and adopted in Great Britain, partly in the War Office but mainly in ac­ cordance with civilian opinion. Under this plan, men needed for industrial and civil reconstruction would be the first to be released from the Army; and the rate of demobilization would be controlled by industrial needs. A member of the United States Committee on Classification of Personnel of the Army spent some time in England in the spring of 1918. H e studied this plan carefully and came back convinced that some adaptation of the plan to the situation in the United States would greatly facilitate industrial readjustment and would insure “ that the men in the Army shall be so dispersed that skilled and unskilled labor in its many classifications of kind and degree shall be made available for industrial absorption as needed.” 7 8 National Archives.

Report to the Secretary of W ar on British Plans for Demobilization and Recom ­ mendations as to the American Program. 7 An analysis of the British plan, to be used as a basis for approaching the American problem, was prepared and a recommendation for the adoption of this plan was submitted to the Adjutant General and the Secretary of War in the summer of 1918. The two civilian groups were working together and by the fall of 1918 agreed that, should the plan be adopted, some cooperative arrangement should be made with the Employment Service of the Department of Labor in its adminis­ tration. It is possible that the greater problem of the readjustment of the country’s industries to peacetime conditions, and concern over the effect of the returned servicemen upon a surplus labor market during a period of mounting unemployment, obscured in the minds of these men the fact that the soldier was a citizen with rights and privileges as an individual when he had finally discharged his duties as a soldier. The British plan, as reported, provided that men should be drafted from the Army for service in civil life upon the declaration of peace much as, upon the declaration of war, men were drafted from civil life for service in the Army. Whatever the desirable factors of the plan, it took into little account the instinctive individualism of the average American, and gave scant consideration to the serviceman’s possible negative reaction to further regimentation upon his release from the Army, but provided that he should be moved about as best fitted the success of the scheme. This fact was well stated by a member of the staff of the War Labor Policies Board: “ Any policy of reconstruction is largely dependent upon the spirit with which it is met by the men to be demobilized. No one can say with certainty what the effect of adventures, discipline, physical training, etc., which men have experienced in the Army, and the psychology result­ ing from the offer of sacrifice, will be.” 8 Attitude of plan’s proponents.—Although the plan for demobilization by industry was ultimately rejected by the Chief of Staff and the Secretary of War, brief consideration should be given to some of its specific details and to the attitudes of some of its supporters. To the Committee on Classifications it was “ obvious that America * * * must demobilize by trades if a disastrous condition of unemployment and unrest is not to ensue. Demobilization by * * * any other schedule is not feasible. * * * The interests of the Army * * * must be subordinated to the civic interests.” 9 Under such procedure the primary factor in the priority of demobili­ zation would be the individual’s industrial classification, and the first administrative task would be the classification of officers and men by profession, trade, or occupation. This task was already partially done, as the so-called “ qualification cards” of the men were based upon their skills and experience at the time they entered the Army. It was suggested that these cards, which had “ proved effective in taking men from industry and placing them right in the Army,” be used for redrafting them into industry, for, in the opinion of the committee, “ there is just as close a relation between classification and placement in industrial life as there is between classification and Army placement; it is all part of the same problem.” However, there was no record of new skills acquired in the Army, nor of the possible desire for change resulting from the experiences in the Army and in new and •National Archives.

It was granted that an “ exhaustive analysis of the industrial situation of the country and the preparation of a program of reorganization on a peace basis” was essential to the functioning of the plan, and it was suggested that the Department of Labor should assume this task. Economists on the staff of the War Labor Policies Board were, in the summer of 1918, engaged in analyzing the major problems of industrial readjustment. Elaborate memoranda were prepared but they dealt largely with generalizations and were of necessity specu­ lative. One member of the staff acknowledged this and urged the substantiation, by fact, of some of the statements made. The follow­ ing abstract contains the essential statements on the release of the soldier. For this large body to be projected upon the community without provision for immediate employment is unthinkable. And however confident we may be that they can shortly be assimilated there is bound to be an intermediate period of great confusion unless some elastic source of employment is provided— work which may be available for all, but work of such a character that, if the conditions of the country provide occupation more rapidly than is expected, it can be post­ poned for future completion. Enough of such employment should be provided and it should be so elastic in its nature that it will for a period of 2 or 3 years provide work for the maximum estimate of unemployed men, and yet, in part at least, not be sufficiently pressing or important to offer competition to perma­ nent necessary employment. It might be advisable to do much of this work before the men are actually discharged from the Army, with the provision, of course, for the payment of industrial as opposed to military wages. (National Archives. Department of Labor, War Labor Policies Board: Memorandum to Chairman from G. S. Arnold, July 24, 1918.) A longer and more comprehensive memorandum “ Upon the Prob­ lem of Demobilization” discussed in great detail the problem in general and the obstacles which would be encountered, and gave many specific suggestions for carrying out a policy of demobilization by industry. The memorandum stressed the necessity for correlation of military discharge with accessibility to reemployment, without periods of “ idleness and dependency.” This required recognition of the fact that munitions workers, released in large numbers from war plants, would also be seeking employment. Thus, there were “ two comple­ mentary problems of employment to be solved. To give employment to discharged soldiers by denying it to munitions workers” was to “ solve one problem of unemployment by creating another.” In other words, if the situation was to be met sfquarely, enough jobs must be provided to satisfy both groups, and at a high rate of absorp­ tion, for it was probable that the release of war workers would not be at the even flow anticipated for the release of soldiers. The key problem of providing a “ mechanism” for discharge was well stated. There was no doubt that failure so to provide would mean failure of the plan as a whole. “ It will probably involve the reorganization of the Army into new units, based upon occupational status, for demobilization purposes. * * * Demobilization will involve not so much legislation as a long series of administrative decisions. Its success depends upon the precision and quickness with which they can be made. This depends upon the range and accuracy of information at hand and upon a mechanism for trans­ lating judgments into accomplishments.” 10 10 National Archives. W ar Labor Policies Board: Memorandum to the Committee on Classification of Personnel of the W ar Department from W alton H . Hamilton, October 28,1918. 9 The Chairman of the War Labor Policies Board commented to the Secretary of Labor upon the “ comprehensive plan” of the Committee on Classification of Personnel and said: The function of the War Department as the Committee views it, ends with the actual demobilization of the war, but the Committee keenly appreciates the necessity of conducting demobilization in such a way that it shall best meet the industrial requirements of the country, and shall result in a minimum of unneces­ sary unemployment, and no breaking down of recently established labor standards. * * * It is necessary to determine when and where the industry of the country can re-absorb the men and whether it is possible to stimulate industry to so great a degree that this re-absorption can be effectively accomplished. * * * It is unnecessary to dwell upon the disastrous results to labor which may result from allowing the demobilization to take its course without more definite preparation than the present general speculation on problems of reconstruction. (National Archives. War Labor Policies Board: Memorandum from Chairman Frank­ furter to Secretary Wilson, October 22, 1918.) After the Armistice and even after the War Department had announced the demobilization policy which it had adopted, sup­ porters of the industrial plan continued their exchange of views. Some of the salient points of one of these memoranda were as follows: * * * the physical productive capacity of the country is large enough to furnish employment to all discharged soldiers and munitions workers and to spare. But this does not prove that a purely military demobilization will furnish employment to the discharged as they need it. * * * A haphazard discharge of men and cancellation of contracts will not give men and materials in the order in which they are needed to hasten the resumption of business. * * * What­ ever the ultimate capacity of the system to take labor, there are abundant reasons for thinking that unless extreme care is taken the labor market will be glutted. * * * A word must be added about the possibility of local gluts. * * * Unless the flow is locally controlled, soldiers will be demobilized in such centers as Bridgeport, Pittsburgh, and Detroit, in which most of the work now going on is under Government contract. If this happens, soldiers will be sent into markets disorganized by the involuntary discharge of munitions workers through the cancellation of Government contracts. (National Archives. War Labor Policies Board: Unsigned memorandum to Lieut. Col. Coss, a member of the Committee on Classification of War Department Personnel, November 1918.) All of these statements reveal concern over the inevitable period of unemployment which would accompany contract cancellation, unless the Federal Government made specific provisions for bridging the gap during the months when soldiers would be leaving the Army. Results of industrial demobilization plan in Great Britain.— Since the American proposal for industrial demobilization was premised upon the British plan which had been worked out with great care, it seems desirable to report upon the results of the British effort. At the time of the Armistice, the United States had been in the war about 18 months, as contrasted with more than 4 years for the British. (The British soldier’s length of service therefore parallels the probable ex­ perience of the American soldier in this war more nearly than in World War I.) The following record of the British experiment comes from Winston Churchill’s story of his participation in demobilization following World War I.11 In January 1919, 2 months after the Armistice, Mr. Churchill had consented to take over administration of the War Office because the “ temper of the Army and the problem of demobilization caused increasing anxiety.” He was “ immediately confronted with conditions of critical emergency.” Under the plan for demobilization by occupation, “ key men” in industry were being hurried back from the front regardless of their length of service, but* n Churchill. W inston S.: The Aftermath—1918-28 (Preface and Chapters I and III). 10 because they were key men many of them had been at the front only a few months. Then, too, the plan lent itself to abuse, and influence released certain men ahead of their comrades without such support but with many months of Army service. The inevitable result was the undermining of Army discipline and the creation of great im­ patience and resentment on the part of the troops. It was decided that only one remedy would prove effective— a complete change in the scheme for demobilization. The new policy provided that (1) soldiers should, as a general rule, be released from the front in accordance with their length of service and their age, (2) the pay of the Army was to be immediately increased to lessen the gap between the rewards of military and civil employment, and (3) the younger men who had completed training but not yet seen active service were to be sent abroad to serve in the Army of Occupation, in place of the older men and those of long service. Once this new system was understood, the disaffection of the soldiers disappeared and later the men were discharged at an average rate of 10,000 a day. Mr. Churchill himself deprecated the lack of coordination between the plans for meeting industrial and military needs. Possibly the results would have been better if the military group had been willing to give the new plan a sympathetic hearing and if the civilian origina­ tors of the new and untried procedure had tried to integrate it more closely with the traditional demobilization methods of the Army. DEMOBILIZATION BY LOCALITY A memorandum recommending discharge of the soldiers through the local draft boards was submitted to the Chief of Staff on Novem­ ber 11, Armistice Day, by the Provost Marshal General, who had been in close association with these boards12 during his administration of the Selective Service Act. His memorandum stated: The economic need of finding the job for the man and of replenishing industry and agriculture at the points of depletion is an obvious one. * * * But its complexities are so vast that any solution on a national scale will be many months incoming. In the meantime, the problem will be more or less a local one. * * * These returned men will be without jobs. There is only one agency most obvi­ ously fitted to do this [provide jobs]. * * * That agency is the one which in the first place took them out of their jobs. * * * Every local board virtually now knows where every man came from and the opportunities which exist in his community for reemploying him. * * * No measure could be more popular to the responsible interests of this country than the one here men­ tioned. These boards include representatives of agriculture, banking, manu­ facturing, commerce, labor, and the professions. They possess the confidence of their own communities in an unexampled degree. To charge them with the proposed task would meet with unanimous popular approval.” (National Archives. War Department, Files of Chief of Staff: Draft Boards.) The Government had already made provision for family allotments, term insurance, Liberty Bond allotments, compensation for dis­ ability, etc., the carrying out of which would require months of administrative activity at the best. Delays were bound to occur as a result of the difficulties of handling official investigations through a central agency far removed from any intimate knowledge of the individual facts. As the Provost Marshal General saw it, it was “ imperative to employ * * * an agency localized in each 13 There were 4,643 of these boards and, in addition, there were the district boards, all familiar with local and regional conditions. 11 community to serve as the local intermediary between the Govern­ ment and the soldier.” He also believed that the individual welfare of the soldier would be furthered by the adoption of this method: The returned soldier * * * has in all times been an element of unrest in the community. * * * [He] has just been freed from a rigid system of restraint; he is something of a licensed hero; and however young, he now thinks himself a veteran, and emancipated from control. There ought to be some central agency that is charged to look after him. That agency is the local board. * * * There will be an intense need in most communities, and for a large portion of the returned soldiers in all communities, of some sort of a controlling and supervising influence. This individual welfare of the returned soldier is not exactly his moral welfare, but it is something above and beyond his economic welfare. It is not easy to describe but it is a very real thing. (National Archives. War Department, Files of Chief of Staff: Draft Boards.) The memorandum was forwarded to the Secretary of War and then on November 26 to the Director of Operations for review. It was too late, however, for this memorandum to be considered, as orders had already gone out on November 19 to begin demobilization from camps in the United States by organization or military unit, and the adoption of this traditional method had been announced by the Secretary of War and the Chief of Staff. Among the several groups that were early supporters of the localboard plan was the Vice Chairman of the War Industries Board. In a memorandum to the Chairman of the Board he said that it was his impression that the military demobilization plan just announced by the War Department was. “ one of convenience for the Army rather than one calculated to meet the demands of industry.” It was the declared policy of the War Industries Board to release materials to nonwar industries in order to stimulate peacetime activities. As this would be futile without a supply of skilled labor, the Vice Chairman proposed using the local draft boards in the demobilization of soldiers still within the United States, in accordance with “ the evident needs of industry for the immediate future.” He emphasized the need for skilled workers and recommended that such men “ experienced in food, fuel, mining, or transportation industries” be furloughed, whether here or abroad, on certificate of need from war agencies such as the Food Administration, the Fuel Administration, and the Emergency Fleet Corporation. Furlough, rather than discharge, was proposed to insure that these men would be employed where their skills were most needed. Publicity of this plan was urged “ to prevent dispersion and tend to reconstruct the nonwar industries to their former status. * * * A general plan of completing dis­ charge of our whole Army at point of origination through local draft boards is favored.” Throughout, the memorandum favored some constructive and expedient method of bringing the soldiers back to their places of pre-war employment and reflected a compromise with the plan for full demobilization by trade or occupation. The members of the draft boards were, of course, in favor of local demobilization. Not only did the communities want their men to come home, but farmers and business and professional men could give employment to large numbers of returned soldiers in their localities. That the proposal received wide publicity is evident from the flood of . letters, received by the War Department in its support after de­ 12 mobilization was in progress. These letters were forwarded to the Secretary of War from members of Congress; they came from governors and mayors, from State councils of defense, and from citizens’ com­ mittees. It is probable that propaganda stimulated some of the letters, but they continued to come throughout the winter of 1919, as the problem of unemployment became increasingly acute. There were legal technicalities which made it impossible for the War Department to provide for the discharged soldiers the type of transportation which would insure their movement out of the cities. Legislation passed later only partially solved this difficulty. Then, too, it was stated that the proposal would prove both costly and inexpedient, that the necessary administrative details must be carried out at larger centers. It was conceded that the use of the boards would get the men nearer their homes, but could not keep them there. “ Whether the draft boards would succeed in placing men where they had come from and keeping them there is a matter of considerable doubt. It is believed, in view of the insistent demands that men be released from the camps where the work of demobilization is now concentrated and being done systematically by trained officers and men, that if the draftboard system were considered the largely increased personnel required by dispersing the same work * * * would result in a popular demand for the return to .the system now being used.” 13 DEMOBILIZATION BY LENGTH OF SERVICE The plan of demobilization in accordance with length of service, the system finally used by Great Britain, was considered by the General Staff and rejected for valid reasons. The United States had been at war a relatively short time. Most of the overseas troops had been abroad little more than 6 months. Almost 50 percent of the emergency Army was in camps in the United States, and some of these men had been in camp only a few weeks. Others, chiefly in the Services of Supply and other services needed for the administration of the camps, had served longer than many of the troops abroad. DEMOBILIZATION BY MILITARY UNIT As already noted, the traditional method of discharge by military organization was adopted and announced to the press by the Chief of Staff on November 16— 5 days after the Armistice. This was just a month after the War Plans Division had been directed to develop plans for demobilization, and before the final formal report had been received by the Chief of Staff. There can be no doubt that the plan of discharge by military organ­ izations was considered by the military authorities as the method best adapted to the immediate problem. “ The decision as to the essential principles under which our Army was to be demobilized was made by the Chief of Staff in person, who determined on demobilization by units. * * * He promptly and unerringly selected from the many plans proposed the one best suited to American conditions.” 14 The 18 National Archives. W ar Department, Files of Chief of Staff: Letter to the Executive Comm ittee of the Independent Citizen’s Committee of Welcome from the Chief of Operations, December 4,191$. 14 W ar Department. Files of General Staff: Lecture on Demobilization, January 2$, 192.1. 13 chief claims made for this method were that it expedited discharge, that it insured the orderly return of troops, that large military units represented a cross section of American industrial life, and that because of its flexibility the rate of discharge could be controlled and provision could be made for special situations and individual cases. Under this method large units of men no longer needed could be dis­ charged en masse. Other units needed at ports of debarkation, at convalescent centers, and at cantonments, could be retained as a whole. If carried to its logical conclusion it would prevent favoritism in release of certain classes, but it could also provide for the release of certain groups needed to support the civilian economy. Demobilization was scarcely under way before complaints and requests for special treatment of individual or group cases began to pour into the War Department. The flood of discharged servicemen into the large industrial areas brought an avalanche of calls for modi­ fications in the demobilization program. Most of the letters dealt with one of two problems— the danger to the community of too rapid demobilization, or the need for obtaining the prompt discharge of men needed in specific industries. These complaints and the tenor of the replies reflect the haste with which the reversal from mobilization to de­ mobilization was undertaken and the desirability of a program from the outset which would have combined the best elements of the several policies proposed. The complaints mounted, most of them suggesting a modification of the system being used, in order to divert the dis­ charged soldiers away from the large cities. Many of the requests for action to ameliorate conditions came from Congressmen who were besieged by their constituents, sometimes from purely selfish motives, but more often in the interest of the com­ munity or of the servicemen themselves. The War Department found it difficult to answer these letters meticulously, to be consistent, and to defend the system and the results of its applications. One of its replies contained a carefully worded statement of the efforts being made to overcome the “ local short comings” , of the operations in progress: Such organizations [of citizens] which find in the large cities a congregating of ex-soldiers and other persons without employment, have, it is believed, er­ roneously become convinced that this crowding to the larger cities is a fault of the War Department’s system of demobilization, and that their proposed scheme of demobilization through the local draft boards would have prevented such crowding. It is believed that this opinion is entirely unjustified. Young men from the farms and rural communities have been taken from their secluded homes and isolated communities and have seen something of the world. The desire of such young men to go to large cities and seek the excitement and dis­ traction there to be found is a fault of human nature that cannot be overcome by legislation or War Department regulation. The fact that discharged soldiers after their discharge go to the large cities is not a fault of the War Department demobilization but has occurred in spite of careful plans taken by the War De­ partment to encourage soldiers to return to their homes. This phenomena [sic] of persons crowding to the large cities is not confined to the United States, but is occurring in every country that was in the war. At the completion of wars, the tendency has always been shown for soldiers returning from war to flock into the cities. * * * I have written at this length because I wished to make it clear that demobiliza­ tion is proceeding in accordance with a very definite and considered policy, and the War Department feels certain that as time passes and the matter is more thoroughly understood and the facts become more completely known, the country will become convinced that the demobilization was conducted in an efficient and 589906°— 44-----3 14 well-planned manner, to the best interests of the greatest number of people of the United States. (National Archives. War Department, Files of Chief of Staff: Letter to Head of the House Military Affairs Committee from Chief of Opera­ tions, February 25, 1919.) Another reply to a Congressional inquiry contained this under­ standing paragraph: Demobilization is inevitably an unpopular process, * * * The eyes of soldiers are turned from contemplation of the country's enemy to provision for their own future, and no man with human sympathies \"can fail to be moved in their behalf. But for the public official entrusted with the completion of the undertaking it is a time for self-restraint and broad vision, a time to see the larger aspect steadily and to see it whole. (National Archives. War Department, Files of Chief of Staff: Letter to Senator McKellar from Secretary of War, February 3, 1919.) During the winter of 1919 the country was faced with a situation which necessitated many modifications of the original procedures for demobilization by military units. Finally, in March 1919, the War Department published an official statement, entitled “ The Army Demobilization System Reviewed and Analyzed in Order Better to Acquaint the Public with the Many Difficult Problems Arising.” 15 At that time the country was suffering from an unemployment crisis, resulting from the cancellation of war contracts for goods of no peacetime value. The analysis of the demobilization situation at­ tempted to explain the abrupt discharge of thousands of servicemen in the absence of a well-planned program for their reemployment, in view of the acute industrial situation. This detailed statement is, in the main, a reply to the persistent demand for the use of the draft boards for final discharge of the men. That such a necessity should have arisen leads to the conclusion that from the beginning a system of demobilization could have been used which would have incorporated the most desirable portions of each proposal. A part of this statement is a fitting conclusion to this review of the various plans proposed for demobilization of the soldiers, any one of which would have failed in some degree because of the unexpected Armistice and the delayed preparations for readjustment. This, then, is the tremendous problem that confronts us— to return to a country whose digestion for labor is not now of the best, hundreds of thousands of men without employment, not forgetting that they and their families deserve the grateful thanks of the Nation, and remaining keenly aware that their patriotism and sacrifice demand that they be given every possible recognition and favor. As the welfare of the country demanded our entry into the war, and its vigorous prosecution regardless of sacrifices, so does it seem that the welfare of the country at large demands our first consideration in the matter of demobilization. The absorption by the counlry of these returning men without disorder and without upsetting the economic life of the Nation becomes of paramount importance. The question arises— can the country digest these men best if fed into it in large contingents by discharge in certain restricted areas such as the ports of the Atlantic seaboard, or in small groups, distributed throughout the entire country in such a way that the processes of assimilation can work easily on each small group? The administration of demobilization of the soldiers is a separate story and its results must be integrated with the coordinate problem of the release of thousands of industrial workers. w U . S. Official Bulletin (Washington), March 24,1919 (p. 6). Part 2.— Early Phases o f Dem obilization The national income in 1918 was larger than in any pre-war year. About one-fourth of it went toward the expenses of running the war, but more people had been employed at higher wages than ever before. There was little advance in the incomes of salaried workers in the middle and lower income groups and their standard of living had declined as prices rose and war taxes increased, but wage earners, both skilled and unskilled, had after a lag benefited materially from steadily increasing wage levels and full employment. Wage ad­ vances resulted from the great demand for workers in the war produc­ tion areas and from a desire to allow nothing to interfere with the steady output of war goods. These wages were further enhanced by additional pay for overtime work. Aside from savings represented by war savings stamps and Liberty bonds, few of the workers in the low-income groups had made any provision against the time when abnormal wage payments would cease. Many of them had known thrift as a necessity but they had not acquired the saving habits that might have encouraged them to save from their high wartime wages. Furthermore, there was no effort to encourage the workers to save against a day of need, and neither industry nor government had assisted in the accumulation of an emergency fund. The war-making agencies proceeded upon the assumption that the war might last until 1922. Plans had been completed for accelerating the war effort. Hundreds of thousands of men anticipated an early call to the armed forces. Thousands of additional Government contracts had been negotiated. Industries were preparing for more complete conversion to production of war products. The U. S. Employment Service was expanding and making more effective its work of providing the adequate number of workers for the scattered war plants. Government controls over industry and over civilians were to be tightened. The War Labor Administration was busy with wage adjustments and settlement of labor difficulties. This concentration upon the war effort had official approval, and there was no encouragement of discussion of the problems to be faced when the war was over. However, readjustment problems engaged the minds of various groups in Government circles and in industry during the 6 months preceding the Armistice. Civilian Proposals fo r P ost-W a r Readjustments There was full agreement that there could be no return to pre-war levels of production, employment, and wages, and there was no doubt as to the industrial future beyond the months of so-called reconversion. Judgments differed, however, as to the magnitude and precise character of the post-war problems and the time span required for the swing away from production for war, through the inevitable temporary but acute period of low productivity, unemploy­ ment, uncertainty, and unrest, to the upswing of full production for peacetime requirements. Only a few realized the dangers inherent in short-range planning when industries began to compete for markets ( 15) 16 serving a public with relatively high and widely distributed purchas­ ing power. It was the immediate and transitory post-war period which provided the basis for most of the pre-Armistice considerations. There is great similarity between these proposals of 1918 and the current “ post-war planning” which has received official commendation during this war. The various proponents of a plan of action discussed different angles of the readjustment problem but there was complete unity on one point— the urgent need for an announced Federal policy supported by constructive legislation and sufficient funds to meet emergencies as they arose. It was generally conceded that the task of developing a flexible program for the employment of men and machinery, during the interim while the Government cancelled war orders and industry equipped itself for peacetime production, should be undertaken by an authoritative governmental agency, nonpartisan in character and entirely free from the pressure of wartime considerations. Without governmental action at both the Federal and State level the cost to the Nation resulting from serious interruption to production and the accompanying unemployment would be greater than the outlay for a well-conducted program for “ buffer” employment. The secretary of the Council of National Defense made the following general observations in August: It is elementary that after the war America will not be the same America. * * * New conditions and relationships create new problems for nations as well as for individuals * * *; the change will be as great in the thought and ideals of the Nation as it will be in its strictly material problems, whether these be military, commercial, or those having to do with labor. (National Archives. War Department, Files of Council of National Defense.) Economists of the War Labor Administration, who argued for the creation of an official agency to act during the readjustment period said: “ Already groups with pecuniary interests at stake are busied in studying the situation with a view of turning it to their own ad­ vantage.” They contended that, lacking governmental action, there would be compromise between the strongest of these interested groups, with little or no consideration of important but obscure interests. “ Unity of effort cannot be superimposed. * * * If a consistent plan is to come, it must be because those who are responsible for it are animated by a common desire, a common viewpoint, and a common willingness to merge their contributions into a common whole.” 1 With this point of view the board of directors of the United States Chamber of Commerce was in agreement. It urged upon the Presi­ dent Federal recognition of the problem, in order that all class interests should be subordinated to the interests of the country as a whole. The general acceptance of this proposal led many executives in the emergency war agencies to assume that certain governmental controls and restrictions would be retained during the period of cancellation of war contracts and retooling for ciyilian production. The Secretary of the Capital Issues Committee, in a memorandum of November 9, made the following statement: Industrial reconstruction after the war might be left to take its own course without governmental interference just as industrial preparation for war might have been left free but was not. The free operation of economic laws would result in wide price fluctuations, unemployment, and prolonged business depres­ sion. * * * There would seem to be no need therefore of any argument to * >National Archives. W ar Labor Policies Board, Keconstruction Files. 17 show that the Government must assist wherever necessary by artificially stimu­ lating and restraining natural economic forces. (National Archives. War Labor Policies Board, Reconstruction folder.) Another businessman of the staff of the War Labor Policies Board believed that there would be sufficient demand for consumer goods “ for a time at least,” provided there was “ a gradual reduction of war orders and carefully considered arrangement of selling prices for basic commodities. * * * In my judgment there is bound to be a period of confusion at the outset, considerable disorganization and uncertainty and at least temporary unemployment.” He felt that commodity prices which had been at a high wartime level should be decreased, and that profits of the larger organizations had been such as to warrant price reductions without the lowering of wage rates. The method in which this hard piece of work is done will have a most vital effect on the success with which demobilization and the re-introduction of demobilized labor into industry is carried out. The social atmosphere is such that * * * the inevitable reduction of the dollar wage rate should follow and not precede, in a majority of industries, reasonable reductions in market prices. (National Archives. War Labor Policies Board, Memorandum from George W. Perkins to Felix Frankfurter, November 1918.) There was, in addition to these broad approaches to the readjustment problem, considerable discussion as to the rate at which production of war goods should be discontinued. One group argued that the more gradual the rate of contract cancellation, the less critical would be the incidence of unemployment and the more readily could released work­ ers be reemployed. The other contention was that it would be futile to attempt to postpone the drastic changes resulting from cessation of war orders; that the more promptly contracts were cancelled the more quickly manufacturers could obtain access to raw materials, the speed­ ier would be the reconversion of plants and therefore the shorter the period of unemployment. There was, however, one grave defect in all of these discussions: they centered in Washington. There was no stimulation of post-war thinking at the local or community level. Although local groups had participated in wartime activities, it was not until after the Armistice that there was open discussion of reconstruction problems. With the Chief Executive engrossed first in winning the war and then in plans for the peace conference, and with little or no pressure upon members of Congress from their constituents, it is not surprising that the legisla­ tion which was proposed for enabling a smooth transition from war to peace died in committees with little or no public debate. Thus the country faced the post-Armistice period without help from its leaders. The abrupt advent of the Armistice found the country unprepared for the reversal of this huge program. The Federal Government had become the largest employer in the country but it gave less considera­ tion to the welfare of these workers, both industrial and clerical, than it would have expected from private industry. Neither the Govern­ ment nor industry had provided machinery for readjustment to peace­ time employment. Therefore, when the fighting stopped, the country was totally unprepared for the return to peacetime living. The War Department was not ready either for the discharge of the soldiers or for the discontinuance of its huge manufacturing program. The result was that the Armistice ushered in a period of uncertainty, of claims and counterclaims, and of unemployment and tension for tens of thousands of civilian workers. 18 W a r Department Program The majority of all industrial workers were directly or indirectly employed by the War Department which had, during the war, en­ countered all phases of the labor problem. The selection, training, and movements of about 4,000,000 men in the armed services had also been the exclusive responsibility of the War Department. When the war ended, slightly more than half of these men were in France and about 1,600,000 eligible for immediate discharge were in training camps in this country. Therefore there was centered in the War Department both the authority and the responsibility for two of the major post-Armistice transactions affecting the lives of millions of American citizens—the demobilization of the Army and the cancella­ tion of war contracts with the subsequent release of thousands of Workers in war plants. This agency was not prepared for either task. While it tardily made plans for the prompt discharge of the soldiers, it disavowed any responsibility for their welfare as private citizens. Later, however, it reversed this policy and cooperated in all efforts to obtain employment for those who needed assistance. During the war the Department had supported the maintenance of such standards for war workers as would aid in the continued and prompt production of supplies for the Army. Conscientious efforts were made to improve living conditions for workers in all war industries. The Secretary of War himself had said, however, that the War Depart­ ment had no other purpose than to see that the armies received ade­ quate supplies when and where they needed them. This indicated little thought for post-war adjustments. The method to be used in demobilizing the soldiers was announced soon after the Armistice, but formulation of policy had been so delayed that there was far too little time for selection and training of the administrative force required for the task. The work was ham­ pered still further because camps in this country were widely scattered. What is more, all early plans had been directed primarily toward the handling of men from overseas. The first order for soldier discharge was ready within a week after the Armistice and called for the release of about 600,000 men, in camps in the United States, who could no longer be of service. Actual discharge moved slowly. During No­ vember 45,000 men were released, about 90 percent of them during the last week of the month. During this period, the War Department was working upon a pro­ gram of contract cancellation. It had been agreed that the policy should be developed in consultation with such other agencies as the War Industries Board and the Department of Labor. Each major cancellation was to be reviewed as to its effect upon the industry, the worker, and the geographical location of the plants. In order to have at hand dependable information on industrial conditions and opportunities for reemployment, the U. S. Employment Service made a weekly telegraphic survey to determine the location and amount of labor surpluses or shortages. On November 12 the Secretary of War, Secretary of the Navy, and Chairman of the Shipping Board issued directions to discontinue immediately all Sunday and overtime work on Government construc­ tion and in Government owned or operated plants. This meant a sharp reduction, frequently as much as 50 percent, in the pay of the 19 workers. This first step in the process of the workers’ adjustment to peacetime conditions was bound to create unrest and uncertainty. Most of the wartime gains of the workers had been long overdue. They were just and right. Now, the certain markets provided by war needs were fast disappearing. However optimistic the long-time industrial future of the country, the immediate future appeared clouded. If Government restrictions were lifted, prices and the cost of living were sure to rise. Surplus workers and released servicemen would compete for available jobs. The result would be industrial strife as workers fought to retain their recent gains. The months immediately following the close of the war were certain to be as ab­ normal as were the feverish months of preparation for war. No legislation was available for this emergency. An Army officer said in 1921: Throughout the period of demobilization the legislative agencies left entirely to the War Department the solution of problems pertaining to the disbandment of our forces and disposition of surplus munitions. Even industrial demobiliza­ tion was largely affected by military policy. (Lecture at Army War College on Demobilization of Men of the Emergency Army, 1921, p. 2.) Fortunately for the employment situation, the rate of discharge of the soldiers was initially much slower than anticipated, owing in part to delay in preparation and in part to the lack of sufficient shipping space for returning the men from abroad. By December 1, the U. S. Employment Service had established offices in all camps east of the Mississippi River, to assist the men who were not returning to their old jobs to find employment. This work was hampered in more than one way. One difficulty was that the soldiers' qualification cards were based upon skills which they had when they entered the Army; many of them had received special training while in the service and were fitted for and desirous of obtaining work of a different character from that indicated on their cards. During November there was a policy of gradual tapering off of war production and although workers and employers feared the worst, actually there was little distress. The announced value of cancella­ tions was high but it included value of contracts on which work had not yet been begun; deliveries of finished goods, valued at about 2 billion dollars, were made in November. Manufacturers of goods suitable for civilian use continued their operations. There was great pressure from Congress upon the War Department for economy and reduction of expenditures. The Secretary of War in a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee stated on November 18 that there had already been a saving of $700,000,000 through stop orders on contracts where work had not yet been begun; cancellation of contracts in process of execution had effected a saving of more than $400,000,000; and the stopping of overtune and Sunday work was saving about $2,900,000 a day. This pressure, coupled with advice from certain industry groups and an evident desire for change in procedure on the part of responsible officers of the War Department, resulted in a change of policy and abandonment of the centralized program for tapering off production. Most of the November cancellations were for some percentage of the product rather than the whole, and many of them were for products where not more than 25 percent of the labor in the plants had been diverted to war work. The important items scheduled for early 20 cancellation were confined chiefly to cotton and woolen goods, wood products and hardware, and automotive products. There had as yet been little cancellation of contracts for products where labor was 100 percent on war work. Changes in W ar Department P olicy Events were shaping themselves into a pattern quite different from that indicated by the current public statements of Government offi­ cials. The judicial review of proposed cancellations delayed action beyond the wishes of the War Department. It had accepted the premise that continuance of war contracts required the use of raw materials better diverted to civilian use either here or abroad; that production of war materials with no peacetime value should be dis­ continued “ as speedily as is consistent with the primary consideration of labor and the industries.” There was, however, no governmental directive to implement these “ primary considerations.” On November 27 an Advisory Board on Sales and Contract Ter­ mination was established by the War Department. Immediately there was an abrupt change in cancellation policy, and the War De­ partment assumed full responsibility for cancellation. The intention was to accelerate cancellation greatly. The administrative functions were transferred to the District Offices of the Ordnance Branch, which would act upon orders from the supply bureaus. The U. S. Employ­ ment Service hoped that under the new procedures its regional and State directors would be able to obtain adequate information concern­ ing the numbers and location of workers in the plants where production was to be discontinued. The earlier method had not yielded such information. The cancellation and curtailment schedules gave no indication of the way in which labor would be affected. Schedules relating to the same class of commodity frequently lacked any state­ ment of labor conditions in the particular plant, the industry as a whole, or in the communities affected. Under the new plan the War Department, at the urgent request of the U. S. Employment Service, ordered its regional cancellation officers to consult with local represent­ atives of the Employment Service “ so that these matters of labor dislocation may be considered before the trouble is caused.” Speedy cancellation was now the order of the day; and it was comparatively easy to handle cancellation orders with expedition. However, the reconversion of plants and the reemployment of workers could not keep pace. During the first week in December thousands of curtailment and cancellation orders went out. Many* of them in­ cluded the phrase, “ Incur no further expense.” By December 9 these recent cancellations totaled more than 2 billion dollars. The geo­ graphical distribution of this slow-down in war production was approx­ imately as follows: Middle Atlantic States______________________________________ North Central States_____ ______ ______ ______________ ______ New England__________________ South Atlantic andSouth Central States_____________________ Western States___________________________________ Percent 38 27 21 13 1 It must be remembered that the Government’s shipbuilding program was not affected by these cancellations. 21 B e g in n in g o f Unem ployment The policy-making officers in the War Department seem to have been skeptical from the beginning concerning the seriousness of pend­ ing unemployment. The following statement, dated December 5, 1918, was made in a memorandum to the Chief of Staff: It is believed there is nothing to justify the prediction of hard times, industrial depression, lack of employment of large numbers of soldiers on account of the rate of discharge. * * * By the time immediate labor needs are satisfied, new construction will require the service of discharged soldiers. * * * The esti­ mates that there may be considerable unemployment in the future are pure guess­ work and there are many indications that there will be ample employment for all. It is believed the energy and resources of manufacturers and urgent need of the world for American raw materials and manufactured articles and the spirit of helpfulness displayed by the entire country will solve the question of unem­ ployment for discharged soldiers and other war workers without any period of extended hard times or lack of employment. (National Archives. War Depart­ ment, Files of the Chief of Staff: Demobilization.) This note of optimism was reflected in most of the official statements of December, and even in the President's message to Congress. The Secretary of Labor, in a press conference as late as December 17, stated that thus far there was nothing in the weekly reports on indus­ trial conditions “ to indicate there is any difficulty in absorbing those who are being released from military forces and war emergency institutions.\" It was the immediate problem of the transitionaPperiod which was the concern of those closest to the labor situation. With the cooper­ ation of citizens and civilian organizations including the Red Cross, and men's and women's local clubs, the U. S. Employment Service proceeded to establish in communities throughout the country offices which would provide jobs for men returning from war and from the areas where there had been emergency war work. These offices were organized and managed by local committees. The U. S. Em­ ployment Service acted as a clearing house, keeping the records of jobs and of men, and directing the men sent to them by local bureaus. In the meantime production under contract with the Government was being stopped so rapidly that the Employment Service, which had agreed to the decentralized control of the entire project of can­ cellation, complained to the War Department that its own explicit instructions to its district officers were being ignored in some areas. No advance notice of cancellations was being sent to the labor rep­ resentatives, and in the Ohio area laborers were being released by hundreds. Private organizations in areas where this situation existed were protesting or making suggestions for easing off army orders. One such suggestion was for converting orders for army shoes and clothing into manufacture for the civilian market, so far as materials on hand would permit. “ Thousands of firms would thus be enabled not only to keep their present labor forces over the winter but would have a definite time in which to reconstruct their commercial organi­ zations.\" In this case the records indicate some official concern, a courteous reply, but no action. In some instances, particularly in the manufacture of subsistence supplies, there was definitely a gradual transfer over from war orders to civilian production. However, it was in the plants operating entirely on munitions and war materials that there was the greatest need for some program, 589966°— 44------4 22 sponsored jointly by Government and industry, for providing em­ ployment for idle workers. By December 28, surpluses of labor Were mounting daily in the cities where war industries were closing down. The immediate situation was most critical in Ohio and Michigan. The South was the only section of the country where there was an increasing demand for labor resulting in large part from the continued expansion in shipbuilding. Day by day the industrial situation grew more dis­ tressing. All munitions centers were affected. The area of surplus labor comprised in general the States of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The number of workers out of employment was increasing in these areas. Although the program for the demobilization of the soldiers was still in its formative stage, more than 600,000 men were released during December, of whom only 70,000 were men returned from overseas. About 30 percent of those released in December were demobilized in areas where workers were rapidly being released from war plants. There can be little doubt that the majority of these men returned promptly to their homes. They had not been subjected to experiences which alienated them from their environment, as had the men in the American Expeditionary Force. It was the minority which drifted aimlessly about the big cities. Although these men were not representative of the whole they did constitute a restless, roving group. Idle, and joined with unemployed and disaffected war workers, they formed a potentially dangerous element in the Nation’s life. Wise, courageous, and sympathetic solution of their problems could not result from expedient decisions of the moment; it could come only from mature consideration of operating procedures worked out well ahead of their use, with sub­ sidiary plans for meeting inevitable unforeseen emergencies. E m ploym ent Situation in Various Industrial A reas CONNECTICUT AREA The Bridgeport, Conn., Local Board of Mediation and Cancel­ lation, composed of representatives of employers and employees, appealed to the National War Labor Board on December 18 for some modification of cancellations to correct the rapid release of workers, and to “ assure a graduated decrease in the number of munitions workers employed m Bridgeport.” Connecticut was a crucial area for war production, and the abrupt cancellation of the ordnance program therefore created alarm in all business and labor groups. Great quantities of small arms and ammunition had been produced in this area which already had plants producing such materials when the United States went into the war. The Connecticut post-Armistice situation had been a matter of continual concern. The Chief of the Small Arms and Ammunition Section of the War Industries Board had submitted a memorandum on November 23 to the Director of Purchase, Storage and Traffic, the controlling cancellation agency of the War Department, in which he carefully enumerated the problems of certain localities upon cessation of war work, including the Connecticut area. He urged cooperation between the regional representatives of the Army and the industries, 23 with a view to reducing the rate of deliveries and thus maintaining employment while contractors returned to “ normal industry.” The War Department felt that industry should itself take some initiative, since it was plain that war production must cease. There is every evidence that the contractors in the Connecticut areas had been given the option to taper production gradually from January 1, 1919, to May 1,1919, giving ample opportunity for gradual release of workers. The appeal from the Connecticut Board of Media­ tion and Cancellation was immediately followed by a long and urgent telegram to the Secretary of War from the Governor of Connecticut stating that— War-contract suspensions are proceeding in Connecticut in an unreasonable manner and at an alarming rate which jeopardizes our whole industrial organiza­ tion affecting labor and capital alike. * * * Council of Defense and Employ­ ment Service unite in recommending first that recent large cancellations * * * be revoked for further consideration; second, that the curtailment program be modified to extend over a longer period; third, in the case of important contracts, manufacturers and Employment Service be given reasonable notice of proposed suspensions to determine effect and make readjustment; fourth, that materials under suspensions be released for commercial work and that future curtailments be made after due consideration of possible effect. The day following the release of this telegram the Clearance Officer of the U. S. Employment Service made a separate presentation to the War Department in which he stated that the Federal Employment Director for Connecticut reported that: “ Accumulated cancellations and suspensions, concerning which the Employment Service had no advance notification, have thrown out of employment more than 4,000 persons in New Haven.” Further evidence of the lack of real coopera­ tion between representatives of the War Department and those of the Employment Service during this period is contained in the following paragraph of this memorandum: It was the understanding that the Employment Service would be kept imme­ diately in touch with cancellations or curtailment. It was also the understanding that cancellations or curtailment would be made with consideration of cancella­ tions and curtailment already made in that district. This intent clearly is not carried out if a large number of cancellations involving the release of a great number of laborers are issued from the District Office at one time and without notification to the Employment Service. (National Archives. War Department, Purchase, Storage and Traffic File 164—Labor; from Sanford Freund to Assistant Director, Dec. 20, 1918.) These protests from various sources were passed along to cancella­ tion officials in the War Department. One result was a memorandum from the Chief of the Procurement Division, who admitted that there were no statistics as to the number employed on war work in Bridge­ port, and no information concerning the number who would be thrown out of work through suspension of contracts. He stated that the Ordnance Department was kept advised of labor conditions through­ out the country and considered as carefully as possible the effect of suspensions upon employment. He then said: It has been forcibly suggested to the Department by Members of Congress and Senators, that a good deal of the agitation in favor of continuing contracts on account of the labor situation was clever propaganda on the part of the con­ tractors who wish to continue to manufacture materials which the Government does not need, simply for profit, and considerable pressure has been exerted to force the suspension of contracts as rapidly as possible. 24 It was his judgment that it “ would have been greatly to the advan­ tage of the Government if it had been possible to stop the work immediately and to pay off the men, giving them 30 or 60 days7 extra wages * * * for in this way the Government would have lost only the cost of labor and would have saved vast quantities of good material.” He drew attention to the abnormally increased popula­ tion of Bridgeport, and stated that many of the workers would have to leave the congested area and in many cases have to accept lower wages.2 A few days later, the Assistant Secretary of War (the Director of Munitions) wrote to General Goethals, the ranking cancellation officer, urging that his office support the district offices in ascertaining the degree to which manufacturers who had been allowed to spread pro­ duction over a considerable period were adopting procedures which “ would best serve the interests of all concerned. The question has been raised, however, in some instances as to whether manufacturers are in fact using this discretion in a way to secure the least possible dislocation and hardship to labor.” He repeated his earlier urgent recommendation that close cooperation with the Employment Service be maintained “ so that the necessary steps can be taken for the ab­ sorption of the labor employed.” 3 OHIO AREA Ohio, too, was in difficulty. Cleveland, Toledo, and Dayton all were receiving orders for ordnance cancellations or curtailment. In addition, winter would bring seasonal idleness to many other workers. There was a prospect that plants might remain closed for “ at least 2 months because of lack of confidence in price of raw material and lack of commercial orders and inability to procure raw material.” Decrease in the rate of cancellation was urged. It was certain that this Ohio area was due for serious unemployment. Cancellation of contracts in many instances involved large labor forces and millions of dollars on a single contract with a single firm. Such situations are typified in the following telegram of December 19, 1918, from the Ohio office.of the Federal Employment Service regard­ ing the unemployment imminent in that State. We have received notice this week Cleveland ordnance division of cancellations affecting 60 firms in Cleveland. We have 6 representatives interviewing firms to ascertain number of employees that will be released. The following firms claim that if work on contracts is stopped at once, that will make releases as follows: Cleveland Steel Products, 475 men, 60 women; Cleveland Hardware, 1,000 men, 200 women; Teplar Motor, 900 men, 100 women; Brown Hoisting Machine, 1,000 men; American Multigraph, 1,000 men, 1,400 women; McMyler Interstate, 1,400 men; Winton Motor, 1,200 men, 200 women; Cleveland Variety Iron Works, 250 men: Cleveland Tannery, 125 men; Browning Co., 100 men* Hydraulic Pressed Steel, 650 men; McKinney Steel, 150 men; Cleveland Crane Engineering, 100 men; Cuyahoga Stamping, 200 men, 100 women; Cleveland Brass & Copper, 450 men; Damascus Brake Beam, 150 men; Ohio Trailer, 100 men; Lee C. Melville, 50 men. A number of other firms interviewed will continue with present force on com­ mercial work. Twenty-two firms, not yet interviewed, it is reported, will release approximately 5,000 men. In addition to men released by cancellation of con­ tracts, there are large numbers idle due to close of lake navigation season, and about 2,000 men in building trades idle.

Majority of these thrown out through cancellation of war con­ tracts from present prospects must remain unemployed for at least 2 months because of lack of confidence in price of raw material, and lack of commercial orders, and inability to procure material. Would suggest that you urge slowing down of cancellation program. Any necessary investigation should be made promptly as firms have been notified by Ordnance Department and are now start­ ing to release men. MICHIGAN AREA The situation was similar in Michigan. There the district ordnance branch informed the regional director of the Employment Service “ that as their orders to cancel were final they could not see any reason for discussing with us the advisability of cancelling or not cancelling orders.” Possibly the district ordnance officers gave less consideration to the labor situations arising from shut-down of plants than had been contemplated by their superiors in Washington. N E W JERSEY AREA Organized labor and organized industry of the State of New Jersey sent a joint appeal for modification of stoppage orders. They pro­ posed the completion of all contracts where materials had already been obtained unless the materials could be “ profitably diverted to other immediate industrial use.” They referred to “ the order re­ cently issued by the Government that manufacture of war supplies must cease on January 31, 1919.” The War Department replied: “ While it is necessary to discontinue the manufacture of war supplies no longer needed and absolutely useless, every effort has been made in directing such continuance to taper off in production activity to the end that labor and industry may gradually shift from war to a peace basis and unnecessary unemployment be avoided.” BUFFALO, N. Y ., AREA The effect of contract cancellations and the resulting threat of attend­ ant unemployment are illustrated by the experience of the Curtis Air­ plane Co. of Buffalo, which was one of the outstanding producers of airplanes during that period. Up to the cessation of hostilities this company, like thousands of others, was concentrating all of its energies upon increasing output. After months of expanding effort, of in­ creasing plant and equipment, and of meeting the problems of man­ power shortage, the whole program collapsed almost overnight. The Army, within 4 days after the Armistice, cancelled contracts for planes valued at approximately 50 million dollars. The indica­ tions were that the Navy and the Bureau of Aircraft Production would also cancel or curtail, to the amount of 13 million dollars. The company had, by November 15, dismissed about 7,000 women and it was inevitable that a large number of other employees would be dropped. These early cancellations were for the finished product. During December 1918 the company received almost 100 telegrams cancelling or limiting production on parts such as bolts, nuts, screws, gaskets, etc. In almost every case the telegram included the phrase, “ Incur no further expense.” The resulting confusion and concern can be imagined. Many of these cancellations affected the work of sub­ contractors, many of them outside of the immediate Buffalo district. 26 During the last week in December the U. S. Employment Service reported 10,000 unemployed in Buffalo, not including those laid off for inventory. By the middle of January this number had increased to 12,000 and the end was not yet in sight. Conditions in Small Companies It must not be forgotten that there were little firms, working on subcontracts, that were scattered about the country in places where, even though a comparatively small number of persons were thrown out of work, the whole community suffered. A typical case was that of a firm in Yonkers, N. Y., which had a prime contract with the Signal Corps for 5,000 miles of outpost wire. A Boston firm had been given a subcontract for making the cotton insulation tubes for this wire. This Boston firm then subcontracted again for cotton braiding for this insulation. What happened? On November 27 the War Department received a telegram from the Liberty Cotton Mills in Dallas, Ga., alarmed because of the cancella­ tion of the Boston contract. Dallas is a small town not far from Atlanta. The Liberty Cotton Mills provided employment for prac­ tically all the industrial workers in the town. The telegram said, “ Entire mill on this contract, and will throw 100 employees out of work. There is no other work in this town they can do. Advise if you cannot allow us to continue on this contract until we can secure other business.” The War Department asked the U. S. Employment Service to in­ vestigate the labor situation at the Georgia plant, and sent the follow­ ing telegram to the Liberty Cotton Mills: Your telegram received. In connection with War Department contracts we are doing our best to taper off production with due regard to the interests of industry and. labor and in this connection are receiving the advice and assistance of the War Industries Board and the Department of Labor. You will recognize it is impossible for us to intervene in connection with subcontracts and subcon­ tractors. The gist of the War Department’s telegram was really contained in the last sentence. The prime contractor m Yonkers had been notified earlier to discontinue production after “ working up goods in process.” What happened to the various subcontractors was his responsibility, and the Government was relieved of all obligation for payment on outstanding subcontracts or for the welfare of the workers.4 These situations, occurring in widely separated areas, have been told in considerable detail since they are typical of the cross currents, the misunderstandings, the honest efforts, and the various interests which must be considered in any report of the situations which existed in the crowded weeks following the Armistice. P ublic and Other Reactions and Appraisals In a guarded but fairly optimistic analysis of the business and financial situation for December 1918, the Federal Reserve Board said, in part: In general, the transition from the war to the peace basis has thus far proceeded with very considerable smoothness and with decided lack of friction. Such 4 National Archives. W ar Department, Purchase, Storage and Traffic File 164. 27 slackening of business as has occurred is described as due to conservatism and hesitation, the outcome of a desire on the part of producers to know more of public policies and the probable trend of business. Thus far the process of readjusting labor to the new conditions has caused but little inconvenience or difficulty. Labor set free in war industries has been steadily absorbed by general business, so that the principal effect thus far of the increasing free supply has been merely that of relieving a previously existing shortage. There is still an excess of demand at many points. In some places considerable numbers of employees have been dropped, but of these a part were temporary workers who had taken employment partly in order to aid war production, while many others have been promptly reemployed. Costs have altered but little, and the high expense of living has made employers feel that it was incumbent upon them to maintain wages, so far as practicable, pending distinct revision of prices for necessaries. In some cases it is reported that there is a tendency to a \"settling down” upon \" a higher level of prices and a higher average of wages than prevailed from some time preceding the war.” In this connection it may be noted that the combined wholesaleprice indexes of the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics remained un­ changed throughout the last quarter of 1918. However, the retail prices of cost-of-living items, which had moved steadily upward throughout the year, advancing almost 12 percent between January and December, continued their upward movement after the Armistice. The Christian Science Monitor on December 2,1918, drew attention to the profits which industrial companies had “ piled up” during the war period and stated that these profits “ should enable them to go through any ordinary period of depression.” It listed a range of earnings per share for the 4 years ending December 31, for six of the largest industrial companies. These ranged from $71.80 for General Electric to $214.35 for General Chemical. Although Congress was doing little to provide legislative authority for aiding prospective unemployment, there was almost daily debate on some phase of demobilization. Senator Chamberlain, a strong supporter of the Administration, and Chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee throughout the war, openly criticised the War Department for its seeming lack of policy in the demobilization of the Army and for inadequate publicity. He said that they “ had no policy and they have not let the American people know what plans, if any, they have, so that they may know how to govern themselves.” As demobilization of the troops proceeded, the lack of authority to expedite the transfer of the released servicemen out of the demobi­ lization centers became an increasing problem. One expedient after another was tried and the results received considerable publicity. Soldiers were given in money the cost of transportation to their homes, free to buy tickets wherever they pleased. Already they were arriving in the cities, improvident, “ broke,” away from home without work, applicants for civilian relief. It was not until February 1919— too late to avoid an unfortunate situation— that the law providing for travel allowance was changed to provide “ 5 cents per mile from place of discharge to his actual bona fide home or residence, or original muster into the service.” So the year 1918 ended on a note of uncertainty, criticism, and concern. The early months of 1919 were to be a difficult period for the American people. Part 3.— Employment Situation in 1919 Situation in W inter o f 1919 As the year 1919 opened, a sense of confusion and uncertainty per­ vaded the country. The strong leadership that was needed was lacking. The President was in Paris. He had delegated none of his powers. His Cabinet, which had remained unchanged throughout the war, was undergoing reorganization. The War Congress was now in “ short session.” Its members were weary. Their wartime ac­ complishments were almost obscured by the weight of post-war problems, to the solution of which they had contributed little or nothing. The emergency war agencies were disintegrating. The War Indus­ tries Board was already out of existence. In its last days it had recommended the final withdrawal of industry from war contracts not later than January 11, and announced as a policy of the Board that there would be no further effort toward price control “ unless extraordinary circumstances should arise.” The Price Fixing Com­ mittee continued its activities where price agreements had not yet expired. Most of the restrictions upon the prices and distribution of food had been discontinued, and the Food Administrator was in Europe organizing the work of the American Relief Administration. More than 1,000,000 soldiers had been discharged, the majority of whom had never left this country. The return of men from abroad was not yet well under way. The aftermath of curtailment and can­ cellation of war contracts was already in evidence. More than 6,000 firms scattered throughout the country were reporting labor conditions each week to the Department of Labor. Employment, which had been comparatively stable early in December, was now shifting toward an oversupply of labor. Labor conditions as reported to the U. S. Employment Service from 122 cities showed, for the first week in January, that 22 percent of those cities still needed additional workers, 39 percent reported an oversupply, and the employment situation was fairly well balanced in another 39 percent. During the war the incomes of many wage-earner families had doubled, tripled, and even quadrupled. Higher wage rates, longer hours, extra pay for overtime, and a greater number of earners per family had contributed to greatly increased purchasing power and led to a false sense of security. Curtailment and suspension of Govern ment work had meant an inevitable reduction in the working forces. Immediately after the Armistice the Government"
