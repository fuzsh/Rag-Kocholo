        "text": "Demob Happy are spoiling us today. Premiering the new video for their brilliant track “Be Your Man”, the Newcastle-formed Brighton-based three-piece are also announcing new tour dates with The Cribs and Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes and announcing their sophomore album Holy Doom, which will be out on March 23rd via SO Recordings (and is available to preorder here!).\n\nSpeaking on the new album, frontman Matthew Marcantonio says, “It’s about getting to know your duality, that’s there’s good and bad in you, and not hiding from either. A spoonful of sugar is sickly, but with lemon it becomes bittersweet and something new all together.”\n\nReleasing the accompanying visuals to “Be Your Man” today too, the vid pays homage to the old TV shows we all used to love. “We like old videos of bands on TV shows,” says Marcantonio, “They have this unorganised quality to them, before this standardised version of what a performer should do and how to act. It was looser and more care free, they took the piss out of it all.”\n\nThe kind of look that rustles up memories of grainy footage of The Beatles, the vid perfectly mirrors that of the Beatles-y song, and is certain to make you fall even more in love with Demob Happy than you already are."
