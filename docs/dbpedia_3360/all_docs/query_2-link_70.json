        "text": "Select streets will begin reopening following the conclusion of the event. All street closures are expected to remain in effect as demobilization of the track wall, fence, and viewing structures takes place.\n\nChicago OEMC issued the following street reopening schedule:\n\nThe northbound section of DuSable Lake Shore Drive is set to reopen on Monday, July 8 at 6 a.m.\n\nThe southbound section of DuSable Lake Shore Drive is set to reopen on Tuesday, July 9 at 11 p.m.\n\nNorthbound and southbound Michigan Avenue between Roosevelt Road and Monroe Street is set to reopen on Monday, July 8 by noon. Northbound Michigan Avenue between Van Buren and Jackson will have one travel lane closed.\n\nREAD MORE | Chicago NASCAR street closures, reopenings guide\n\nThe priority streets to reopen are DuSable Lake Shore Drive, Michigan Avenue, and Columbus Drive.\n\nOther street closures will remain in effect as demobilization of the track wall, fence, and viewing structures takes place.\n\nNorthbound DuSable Lake Shore Dr. will begin reopening Monday, July 8 at 6 a.m., with all NASCAR-related demobilization activity expected to conclude by end of day July 18th.\n\nStreets with local access are only for residents, businesses and their employees.\n\nNASCAR can't seem to escape the rain in Chicago as downpours shortened the race for a second year in a row.\n\nMany fans were braving the weather though and staying until the checkered flag to see Alex Bowman win the race.\n\n\"I knew it was gonna be a great ending... it's been really close, so I just had to stick it through,\" Chicago resident James Chaplin said.\n\nFans adjusted to the weather quickly with ponchos and rain gear as they said the atmosphere was worth it.\n\n\"Rainy, but this is the energy, it doesn't matter... the energy is awesome... people are happy and we're right here loving NASCAR in Chicago,\" Chicago resident Jorge Azpeitia said.\n\nIt was a jam packed weekend of action with all sorts of live entertainment.\n\nMotor cross bringing the tricks and flips before the race, as well as some concerts with Laura Alaina and Keith Urban stealing the show.\n\n\"It's pretty neat actually to see the big names coming out for these... and the Chainsmokers yesterday, that was a fantastic concert,\" NASCAR fan Jennifer Decker said.\n\n\"I love how the concerts got screens everywhere so you don't feel like you're glued in this sunny place where you'll burn... so I love this atmosphere,\" said Pam Schoeffling from Milwaukee.\n\nDespite the rain impacting the race in back-to-back years, fans said it was an enjoyable weekend that they hope NASCAR will continue to bring to Chicago.\n\n\"We've had great food... great talent playing... great race... great city. Hope to have it back,\" said Cam Arnold from Nashville.\n\nAfter Shane van Gisbergen was knocked out earlier in the race, it seemed like Kyle Larson would be the new favorite to win the 2024 NASCAR Cups Series street race in Chicago.\n\nWhen Larson crashed into the concrete wall around 7:30 p.m. on turn 6 of the street race course in the 34th lap, that prospect seemed to be in doubt.\n\nLarson had won the pole in qualifying rounds Saturday morning to start Sunday's race in the most favorable position, but now he appears to be out of the competition.\n\nHis car had to be towed after it got stuck in the tire barricades near the concrete wall.\n\nThe wet track conditions still seem to be providing an added challenge for the NASCAR drivers as they still have about 40 laps to go, unless the race is called complete at 8:20 p.m."
