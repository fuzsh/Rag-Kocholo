She remained on the show until it was decommissioned in 1998. In between series of Game On, she had a part in the BBC One drama Pie in the Sky from 1995 until 1996.\n\nWomack then starred in the pilot for The Grimleys with Jack Dee, and the movie Up 'n' Under with Neil Morrissey. In 1998 she starred in the ITV1 series Liverpool 1 alongside her future husband Mark Womack. She then returned to comedy in the ITV sitcom Babes in the Wood.

She reprised the role at the Sunderland Empire alongside Alex Ferns in 2007.\n\nOn 11 May 2007, it was announced that she would be joining EastEnders as Ronnie Mitchell, a cousin of the Mitchell brothers.[10] She had previously appeared in the soap in a minor role as a girlfriend of Simon Wicks.[11] In January 2011, The Sun reported that Womack had resigned from EastEnders.[12]\n\nSince appearing on EastEnders, she has made regular television appearances, including Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, The Paul O'Grady Show, Richard & Judy and Loose Women. In November 2007, she sang along EastEnders co-stars in the 2007 Children in Need charity appeal.\n\nIn January 2011, she made a guest appearance on the BBC TV magic show The Magicians as the celebrity partner to magician Chris Korn. She performed a dangerous trick called Smash and Stab, in which a spike is hidden under paper cups that the magician then crushes with their hand. For her \"celebrity's choice\" live trick, she chose being sawn in half by Korn in a version of the illusion called Clearly Impossible.\n\nIn March 2011, she appeared with Lenny Henry, Angela Rippon and Reggie Yates in the BBC fundraising documentary for Comic Relief called Famous, Rich and in the Slums, where the four celebrities were sent to Kibera in Kenya, Africa's largest slum.[13]\n\nIn 2011 Womack played the leading role Ensign Nellie Forbush, a U.S. Navy nurse from Little Rock, Arkansas, in the Lincoln Center production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical South Pacific at the Barbican Theatre in London.[14]\n\nIn November 2011, it was reported that Womack was in the running, alongside Dannii Minogue to become a judge on the 2012 series of Britain's Got Talent. However, it was later confirmed that the judging panel for series six would be Simon Cowell, Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden and David Walliams.\n\nAwards[]\n\nHer portrayal of Ronnie Mitchell won her Best Newcomer at the Digital Spy Soap Awards along with Best Onscreen Partnership for her character partnership with Roxy Mitchell played by Rita Simons. She was nominated for Best Actress for the 2009 Soap Awards and she was nominated for 'Sexiest Female' for the 2010 Soap Awards and is currently in the nominations for Best Soap Actress for 'Inside Soap' Magazine Awards.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nJanus married Italian Junfan Mantovani in 1997 after a long relationship. The relationship broke down and the couple divorced in 1998.[15]\n\nShe then starred in Liverpool 1, and started a relationship with Mark Womack while she was still married to Junfan. They married on 16 May 2009[16] and have two children (both born in Westminster, London):[17] son Benjamin Thomas Womack (born February 2001) (after having him Janus took two years off to enjoy motherhood) and their daughter Lily-Rose Womack (born April 2005), while Mark has another son from a previous marriage, Michael Womack.[18][19] Womack has stated that she would like more children but her husband is not so keen.[20]\n\nIn 2009, Janus took her husband's surname of Womack and began to use it professionally in her role on EastEnders.[21]\n\nWomack and her husband are best friends of Scott Maslen and his wife Estelle Rubio. They have known each other since they were teenagers. Maslen is godfather to Womack's two children (and she is godmother to Maslen's son, Zak) and they often go on holiday together with their children, which Womack revealed during an appearance on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in January 2008.Template:Citation needed Womack is also best friends with co-star Rita Simons, who plays her sister Roxy Mitchell.[22]\n\nIn the autumn of 2007, Maslen joined the cast of EastEnders as the character Jack Branning, the brother of Max Branning, who quickly takes a shine to Ronnie. This was something that both Maslen and Womack were initially uncomfortable with when they read it in the scripts, Maslen commenting in various interviews that having to kiss Womack was like having to kiss his sister.[18][23] The characters have since married, and had a baby (James Branning) who died of cot death on New Year's Eve 2010, sparking a controversial storyline.\n\nIn April 2008, several future scenes featuring Ronnie had to be scrapped after Womack broke her shoulder when she tripped and fell down the stairs at her home while rushing to get ready for work.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Title Role 2007 EastEnders Ronnie Mitchell (2007–2011) Wild at Heart Tessa 2006 Dead Man's Cards Kris Where the Heart Is Marla Home Again Ingrid 2005 The Afternoon Play Emma Priestley 2004 The Baby Juice Express Trixie Short Tall Woman 2003 Strange Jude Atkins Undercover Sex Jake 2002 Judge John Deed Mel Powell Strange Jude Atkins 2000 Cinderella Cinderella Pantomime 1998 Babes in the Wood Ruth Froud Liverpool 1 DC Isobel de Pauli Imogen's Face Imogen Breeders Louise Up 'n' Under Hazel Scott Pie in the Sky Nicola 1997 The Grimleys Geraldine Titley 1995–1998 Game On Mandy Wilkins 1994 Minder Marian 1993 Health and Efficiency Charmaine Demob Hedda 1992 The Bill Annie Carlisle 1991 Press Gang Waitress El C.I.D.
