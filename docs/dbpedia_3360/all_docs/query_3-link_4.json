It defines drama as staged art that is designed to be performed in a theater. Drama differs from other genres like novels and poems in that it presents a story through characters interacting and living out experiences on stage, using dialogue, rather than just narrating a story. Drama is considered the most active and concrete genre because it brings stories to life for an audience through live performance. While some actions may seem dramatic, drama specifically refers to staged performances of plays meant for theater.",
