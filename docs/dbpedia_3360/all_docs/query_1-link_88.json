        "text": "“After having served 8 years in the Royal Navy as a Marine Engineer, on starting my transition to civvy street I was contacted by Demob Job to help me find my new career. Kelly was my point of contact throughout, and she was brilliant from start to finish. She noted all my previous skills and experience and used them to match jobs that were in my preferred field. She filtered jobs for me that were within my preferred commutable area, working routines, and the salary range I was looking for. I was matched with a job that best suited everything that I was looking for. Kelly kept me well-informed throughout the selection and interview process. She even phoned me the Friday before I was due to start my new job to wish me good luck. I would not hesitate to recommend Demob Job to any member of the Armed Forces looking to take their next step”. Nathan is now employed as an Electrical Maintenance Engineer in Manchester.\n\nI was contacted by Emma having just left the Royal Navy about helping to find me work. After discussing my background and experience she spoke to me in detail about a role which she thought was a strong fit. I consequently applied and was invited for an interview. Within hours of attending the interview Emma contacted me and told me I had been successful. Throughout the whole process she kept me informed of my progress and gave me advice on how to prepare for the interview. Most importantly I felt like she treated me as a person and not just another case. Highly professional and polite, I couldn’t recommend them enough to any Ex-Forces personnel. Thank you Emma and thank you Demob Job! Project Engineer, Tyne and Wear\n\nI recently left the Royal Navy after 5 years’ service and I was struggling to find a job that suited my skillset. Joanne contacted me about a vacancy that she thought would match up with my previous military role. She was with me every step of the way always willing to advise me and she was a great liaison between the company and myself. With Joanne's help, I secured a job in an industry that will only expand in the future. I’d like to thank Joanne and the Demob Job team for helping me on my journey to a new career. Now a Field Service Engineer covering the North East\n\n“I contacted Demob Job after seeing a job advert on LinkedIn. Joanne Foster was extremely responsive and arranged a telephone call to discuss the job and check my suitability for the role, an important step in preventing both me and the employer from wasting time. Joanne spent time compiling an accurate and suitable application with me and presented it to the employer on my behalf. Interviews were arranged, taking into consideration my current employment, and regular updates were provided. This all resulted in a job offer. A huge thanks to Joanne at Demob job, you’re a huge asset to the service leaver community.” Andrew is now employed as a Senior Aviation Engineer in Hertfordshire.\n\nAfter being made redundant from my previous employer due to being furloughed for over 3 months, I was contacted by Joanne Foster at Demob Job, and was quickly offered the chance of an interview. Within 48 hours of being contacted, I attended an interview and I was offered employment. I was really impressed with the help and information that was available to me. Joanne even followed up after my employment was finalised and made sure I was ready to start my new job the following week. I would highly recommend Demob Job to anyone leaving their military career. Roger is now employed as a Service Repair Technician in Warwickshire.\n\nI left the RAF and began the laborious and slightly soul destroying task of searching for a job appropriate to my skill set. I was in contact with an old colleague who linked me to the advertisement posted on Demob Job by Joanne. I carefully read the criteria requested and contacted Joanne who promptly arranged a chat with me via telephone the next day. Joanne advised me of what the job entailed and after a brief informal Q&A, proposed to put me forward for the role of Field Service Engineer at a Marine company. I was thrilled to hear back that the company were interested in speaking to me via web interview initially and I was coached on some salient points to assist me with techniques and common questions. That interview was completed and Joanne kept in touch between myself and the company for feedback. I was then contacted back by Kim as Joanne had a holiday but I was made aware of this well in advance and Kim became my contact. I was delighted to hear that I was invited to the company HQ on Friday for a face to face interview after being shortlisted. I was delighted to be contacted by Kim to give me the good news that I had been offered the job. Joanne and Kim have been amazing throughout and I cannot thank them enough. I would describe Joanne and Kim as dynamic, highly professional, very supportive and confidence inspiring. I would recommend Demob Job to any service leaver be it imminent or out of the services for some time. Field Service Engineer, Durham"
