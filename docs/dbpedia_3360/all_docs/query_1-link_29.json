        "text": "§ VISCOUNT SAMUEL\n\nMy Lords, the terms of the Motion include not only demobilization of the Forces but also the turnover of factories from war to peace production. That second aspect was dealt with somewhat fully by the noble Lord, Lord Llewellin, in his very comprehensive speech. He illustrated it by many instances, and I do not propose to trouble your Lordships with any observations at all on that portion of the Motion, but will limit myself entirely to the question of the demobilization of the Forces. First of all, I would desire to remind your Lordships of the many aspects of our national life which are being affected by the slowness of demobilization and by the widespread discontents among the people, which are intensified by the consequences of the shortage of labour, which in turn is largely the result of the slowness of demobilization. Housing, for example, has priority in the minds of 1015 most of us. When we consider the needs of the present hour, the difficulties of housing, the need for the provision of prefabricated and ordinary houses, and the restoration of houses destroyed or partially destroyed during the war, we realize that all these things depend upon the supply of labour. The deficiencies that at present exist are due primarily to labour shortage, and that in turn is due to the slowness of demobilization.\n\nWe had a debate for two days last week on the housing question, and we had a statement by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel; but I am sure that many of your Lordships who heard that statement shared the feeling that I myself entertained—that it was on the whole disappointing when referring to the actual results obtained. Your Lordships will remember that, in giving statistics of what had been achieved in various parts of this sphere, the figures were mainly in hundreds, whereas what is required is thousands, and indeed tens of thousands, and even, in prospect, hundreds of thousands.\n\nThen there is the problem of overcrowding in London and other cities, the lack of accommodation, the shortage of hotels. The discomfort and difficulties caused by all this are partly due, no doubt, to the fact that great numbers of premises of all kinds have been requisitioned by the various Government Departments, and they are very slow to derequisition those premises. Tenacity has always been a virtue of the British Army; the bulldog, which never lets go, is the symbol of the British soldier; but tenacity when shown by the War Office in the form of an intense reluctance to give up the hotels and other premises which it has requisitioned ceases to be a virtue and becomes a serious inconvenience.\n\nAgain, consider the discomfort and injury to health and to well-being inflicted on the feminine half of the population during these long years of war through the difficulties in obtaining domestic supplies—the queueing at the shops, the time that is occupied day by day, and so on. You see middle-aged and elderly women day by day carrying their heavy bags and baskets of home supplies, to the injury of their health and frequently to their physical exhaustion. This is causing 1016 a great strain upon the health of the women of our country. It is due partly to the insufficient number of shop assistants, and partly to the cessation of deliveries by the shopkeepers. Consider how disproportionate the saving has been compared with the burden imposed. A hundred women in a neighbourhood have each to go to their supplying shops, have each to wait in a queue and come back with their domestic supplies, while a single girl with a motor van and half a gallon of petrol would be able to supply all that is needed. To paraphrase a famous sentence of the late Prime Minister, \"Seldom have so many borne so much to save so little.\" That again is due primarily to shortage of labour, and shortage of labour is due to the slowness of demobilization.\n\nThe difficulties of transport by rail and by bus, which cause the greatest inconvenience to a large part of the population, are again a matter of the shortage of labour. The controls that have to be exercised, to the dissatisfaction of a great many people, but which are recognized to be necessary, are due to the danger of soaring prices and possible inflation, because the supply is inadequate to meet the potential demand. Why is it inadequate? It is due to shortage of labour, again due in great measure to slowness of demobilization. The potential dangers of the foreign exchange position, the risk of a further depreciation of the pound, the necessity to concentrate a large part of our manufacture upon exports, again impose a deficiency on our home supplies. If labour has to be devoted to exports, it cannot be devoted to home supplies, and thus the fact that the drive for the export trade is so burdensome to the country at the present time is in part due to shortage of labour.\n\nConsider also the financial position of the country and the high rates of taxation. This taxation was uncomplainingly borne during all the years of war for the sake of the great object in view, but it is now continuing almost unchanged. The reduction in expenditure has been exceedingly small in recent months, and the reduction in taxation almost negligible. Why is that? It is because we go on paying, week by week, millions of men and women of all grades in the Forces, with a mere pretence at occupying them. We keep in the Forces people who are eager to get back to their 1017 homes and to be united to their families; they are kept in idleness on full pay, at the cost of the taxpayers and to their own indignation. It is compulsory unemployment, and their pay is really the \"dole\" in uniform.\n\nI would remind your Lordships of all these issues—housing, rationing and queues, transport, the lack of consumer goods, the difficulty of supplying sufficient exports, the question of foreign exchange, taxation, and the injury to the men themselves. All these are due to shortage of labour; and shortage of labour, I repeat, is due to the slowness of demobilization. Government spokesmen have given us figures which, at first sight, seem impressive of the numbers of releases since the war ended, and, indeed, since this Government came into power there has been a slight acceleration. Of course, there have been releases. Millions of persons were drawn into the Forces to fight the Germans and the Japanese, and, with our Allies, they have achieved their object. The German and Japanese Armies, Navies and Air Forces have been dissolved or destroyed and have disappeared, and naturally the Forces raised by us for the purposes of the war should be released. I suggest, though, that the figures we should concentrate our attention upon are not the figures of releases but the figures of retentions. It is those figures which I would quote now to your Lordships.\n\nGovernment statements that have been made on this subject disclose that at the end of the war—the date taken was June 18 of this year—there were in the three Forces taken together, 5,136,000 men and women, or just over five millions. At December 31 of this year it is anticipated that there will be 3,842,000, or dose upon four millions. Eight months after the end of the German war and six months after the ending of the Japanese war three out of the four men and women who have been drawn into the Forces are still there! Three-quarters will still, be under arms at the end of this year. By the middle of next year, June 3o, 1946, it is anticipated that the Forces will number 2,232,000. Think of it, thirteen months after the end of the German war 2,200,000 in round figures, will be retained, and 2,900,000 releases—only rather more than half of the total—will have taken place. Nearly half of the total will have 1018 been retained after the lapse of that long period. If at any date before the war or during the war anyone had suggested that when the war had been over for a year we should still have 2,250,000 people under arms the idea would have been scouted as an absurd and exaggerated prognostication.\n\nWe do not yet know what is likely to be the permanent military, naval and air force establishment of this country. We discussed that matter in this House a few days ago, and it was generally agreed that it would not be possible at the present date to give any definite and reliable estimate of what the requirements of the country would be when the present period has passed away. Certainly, I think we should all be resolved that the Forces should not be insufficient for the purposes for which they would be needed. The first of those purposes is that we may take our share in the occupation of the late enemy countries; the second is to provide the kind of force that has always been necessary for the police work to be performed by the British Army, Navy and, in recent years, Air Force; the third is to supply the British contingent to the Force or Corps which is to be at the command of the United Nations Organization. Last, and not least important, of these purposes, is that of providing against possible risks in respect of our own defence if the United Nations Organization were found not to succeed in its great purposes.\n\nUndoubtedly the invention of the atomic bomb will not dispense with military, naval, or air forces. It is clearly quite a delusion that it should do so. At the present time there are in progress military operations or preparations to forestall the necessity of military operations in Palestine and Java, and even when the United Nations Organization comes into full operation it might be necessary at any moment to take repressive action in some country threatening aggression. But no one would suggest that any of those cases could be dealt with by dropping atomic bombs and wiping out masses of the population. Such a course would arouse the greatest possible resentment and would intensify violence rather than intimidate those who were disposed towards it. Consequently, it is clear that there must be, for a long time to come, a very considerable force 1019 maintained—unhappily at the expense of the taxpayers of this country—and making a demand on our man-power. How big the Forces may be cannot yet be ascertained, but we have very high authority for the view that the figures I have quoted for the Forces to be maintained at the end of this year and at the end of next year are very excessive; the authority of no less a person than the late Prime Minister, Mr. Winston Churchill. As Minister of Defence, and prime conductor of military, naval and air force operations he had unrivalled experience and he speaks with unrivalled authority. He has always been the protagonist of fully adequate defence for this country and he is not likely to understate the needs of the future.\n\nBut he said, speaking in a debate in another place, in October last, that unless the Government contemplated the possibility of having to go into another major war within the next five years (and if that were so we ought not to have demobilization at all)—and that is not the expectation that any of us have in our minds—the figures which he would give (and he presented a careful review of the requirements of each of the three Services in turn), led him to this conclusion; and here I quote his words: I have no hesitation in saying that the Government's measures fall far below what is both possible and necessary. That referred to measures for demobilization. Mr. Churchill further declared that the figure of 3,800,000 contemplated for December 31 of this year, meant in his view that no fewer than 2,225,000 were redundant. Two millions, that is an immense figure. What a difference it would make to the labour force in this country if those people were released, and how far it would enable us to proceed towards a solution of those domestic problems to which I have referred. With regard to the target for next year he, himself, would contemplate a figure of 1,550,000 which, he said, should be reached much earlier than is now contemplated. I do not know how the Government have arrived at the figures which they have presented to the nation. Presumably, they have done so on the advice of their Military, Naval and Air Force chiefs—the chiefs of the three Services. But responsibility must, in the long run, rest with the Government, for 1020 Service Chiefs always put their figures high. They must do so in order to safeguard themselves. It is for the civilian authority in the State ultimately to say what the requirements of the country and the Commonwealth are.\n\nIf it is true, as Mr. Churchill says, that these very high figures of retentions are unnecessary and injurious, the next question is, are they unavoidable? The Government may say: \"We agree that the figures are much too high, but they cannot be reduced for two reasons; one is the difficulty of transport and the other is the working of the Bevin scheme of demobilization.\" With regard to transport no one in this House can form any valid opinion without full knowledge of the facts. When Lord Leathers was Minister of War Transport we felt great confidence that the matter would be handled with the maximum of efficiency. Under the present administration we do not know that. We have no reason to think that it is not efficient, but we do not know that it is. We can only judge by results, and the results are that the troops are being brought home very, very slowly. We invite the Government to give a justification of this. If they say that transport is inadequate, they should give facts, definite facts. There is no reason for secrecy now and they should explain why it is that they cannot bring men home much more rapidly than has hitherto been the case.\n\nWith regard to the Bevin scheme resting upon age and service, there is general agreement that it secures a large measure of equal justice and prevents great discontent amongst the Forces if they have no reason to think that any among them are given privileges over any others. A man out in the Far East or wherever he may be, may endure waiting for month after month if he is told that it is unavoidable and if he finds that everyone else is in the same position as himself. Privileges for some would undoubtedly increase and embitter the grievances of others. There is a little-known eighteenth Century poet who wrote: I can endure my own despair, But not another's hope. There is this point in the working of the Bevin scheme to which I think attention has not been drawn; at all events I have never seen any reference to it. That is, that many of the men who are most 1021 needed in industry are kept now for the very reason that they have been the men who were most needed in industry. During recruitment all through the war, key-men in the factories, workshops and industries in general were deferred and the deferment was renewed at intervals of six months. A man in charge of the workshop or a valuable foreman was kept for six months, again for half a year and then for another half year. The more valuable he was, the longer he was deferred. The effect of that was that that man had eventually to be taken into the Forces, and now, under the principle of age and service, he is in one of the most postponed classes. The consequence is that the principle of reserving for industry its most valuable men works out in exactly the opposite direction. The more valuable a man was (and he was kept in industry for that reason), the longer he will be kept in the Forces and the slower will be his return to ordinary life. I happened to be talking to a leading London builder who drew my attention to this fact. He said that he, in his own case, had been unable to get back many of his best men and had had to put IT with inferior labour because he had been allowed to retain his best men in his business for building houses for a long time before they had been called up. That should surely be taken into account in administering the Bevin scheme.\n\nThen again, there are some in the Army, perhaps a small minority but: perhaps in the total a substantial number, who do not want to be released at present. They have got no work to go to; they are uncertain as to their future. They like serving in the Army, the Navy or the Air Force. Would it be possible for them to volunteer? Could they be invited and perhaps given financial inducement to stay willingly in the Army with the result that a larger number of releases could be speeded up, to take the places of those these men would have filled?\n\nBut all these things are not our business; these detailed matters are the business of the Executive. All we can do is to state a case, to press for action to meet it, and then it is for the Government to say whether the case is a good one and, if they say it is not a bad one, to explain their failure to accomplish results. The noble Lord who is going to reply to me is the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War and is therefore a member 1022 of the Army Council, and in a position of great responsibility and influence in these matters, although no doubt the principle of the course to be taken is a matter for Cabinet 'decision. Nevertheless, within the limits of a Cabinet decision there is room for a great deal of ingenuity, and a need for energy on the part of the Service Departments. A change of Government from time to time is one of the advantages of the British constitutional system in that it very often brings fresh minds to bear on problems instead of minds which we might possibly describe as stale ones. There are disadvantages, however, in a Coalition, in that members of the new Government are to some extent those who have already committed themselves as members of the previous Government and a freshness of view may perhaps be lacking. That does not apply to the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, who is a new arrival, so new an arrival in the Government that he is not likely to 'have been already bureaucratized. In a mood of 'expectancy, cautious expectancy, even dubious expectancy, we await the statement he is about to make.\n\n§ THE EARL OF DUDLEY\n\nMy Lords, I want to emphasize what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Llewellin; and the noble Viscount, Lord Samuel, and others because I am in very close touch with some very large industrial under- 1023 takings and I have opportunities of seeing what a disastrous effect the dead hand policy of the Government is having on industry. No one will deny the importance of the rapid resuscitation of our export trade. The exhortations of the Government in this respect are almost superfluous and receive a ready response from the great majority of those engaged in industry. The tremendous difficulties of carrying it into effect in this post-war transitional period are obvious to your Lordships. In many cases they seem to be almost insuperable, hedged about, as they are, by many difficulties beyond our control. Everybody is doing his best to surmount them, and it seems senseless to enhance these difficulties by such a short-sighted and unhelpful policy as that which the Government have adopted in regard to demobilization.\n\nAs the noble Viscount has just said, although the war in Europe has been over for about six months, and the war with Japan for over four months, so far as the companies with which I am connected are concerned, less than 3 per cent. of the called-up personnel have so far been released—or at least returned to us. There may, of course, be further numbers on demobilization leave, but we have only received about 3 per cent., and, as far as I can find out, that is the kind of figure that can be applied to industry as a whole. At the same time, the labour position is being worsened, day by day, by the call-up of the younger men and apprentices who, until now, have been deferred. This means that industry, during the delicate period of change-over from war to peace, has to rely, very largely, on the older men. Grand old workmen, certainly, most of them are, and they have done a splendid job in the war, but they are physically capable of fulfilling not much more than half a younger man's task.\n\nAnother great handicap from which we are suffering is the lack of specialists. That release of key-men cannot be speeded up seems incomprehensible. I saw in the Press yesterday that a little over a quarter of the key personnel applied for under Class B had so far been released, and I must say I am not at all surprised because I know, from bitter experience, how difficult it is to get the 1024 specialists released from the Services. As has already been pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Llewellin, releases under this category are not popular with the men because they lose some of their demobilization amenities, and, therefore, those in the lower release groups prefer to wait their turn in the normal way. But, apart from this, the terms of release under Class B are so extremely narrow, as regards qualifications, and so on, that very few men, indeed, seem to fall within them. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, when he replies in a moment, will tell us something about Class B, and whether its conditions could not be made less rigid and restrictive so that we could attain a very much greater flow of men who could fill the specialists' positions. At the moment there is a great dearth of these, and even though the men have only previously had a brief training in such positions, after all, a half-trained or quarter-trained man is better than none at all.\n\nI am not going into the question of how many men we should retain under arms during the present highly unsettled state of the world, because I am not qualified to do so. Like the noble Viscount, I am in favour of maintaining the maximum number which Chiefs of Staff consider to be essential for peace and safety. But we all know there are a great many officers and men serving at home to whom the Service Departments are finding the very greatest difficulty in allocating work to keep them barely occupied. We see them wherever we go, all over the country, engaged on fatigue tasks, and as the noble Lord, Lord Llewellin, says, thoroughly browned off and bored. And yet, day by day, more and more young men, on the very threshold of their industrial careers, are being called up to join the ranks of this vast unemployed Army.\n\nI have talked to a great many young men who have not been long in the Services, thwarted in their training, perhaps, through the closing down of various training schemes after months of keenness and hard work, with little prospects of promotion in a shrinking Service, and without the driving power behind them that comes while war is on. I am bound to say I am very struck by how deeply the iron of bitter disappointment and frustration has entered into the souls of these young men 1025 —there are thousands of them in all the Services—which is doing a great deal of harm to their moral characters. These are the young men upon whom we have to rely for the rehabilitation of Britain, the very same young men who have got to compete in the markets of the world with those other manufacturing countries who are getting such a magnificent start with regard to demobilization, and in other respects. For goodness' sake, let us do our very best to equip them for that task at the very earliest moment.\n\nIf I may have the noble Lord's attention for one moment, I am told that there are certain vocational schemes started by the Services. That is all to the good, but I would like to know how wide they go. Do they embody technical training and commercial training? Who are the teachers, and are they qualified teachers? Can those schemes be widened? Of course, they cannot be wide enough to embrace all these young men, but the wider they are the better. Why are not the Government releasing more students from the Forces? Our universities and technical schools, at this period of our history, ought to be crammed to overflowing, and every teacher ought to be pressed into commission. Apprentice schemes in all our works ought to be doubled, and even trebled, and they should be made sacrosanct from the depredations of the Service Departments. It is true that students are being released who have been fortunate and clever enough to win scholarships and exhibitions, but it seems to me to be rather illogical to release a student to take up his scholarship and, at the same time, to refuse further deferment to an apprentice in the last year or two of his apprenticeship. That apprentice has worked bard, night and day, at the bench and in the technical school for years past, and is within grasp of the fruits of his labour. It seems very hard on him.\n\nIt would also seem here that there are many thousands of officers and men serving overseas whose release could be speeded up. Many units, we know, have been divorced from their weapons; tank men from their armour, gunners from their guns, sailors from their ships, airmen from their aircraft, and so on. These men cannot possibly be of any use as offensive or defensive units, and, therefore, their retention cannot possibly 1026 be justified on grounds of security. We all know, as the noble Lord has pointed out, that there are vast difficulties in the way of the transportation of these men back home, particularly respecting those serving in the Far East. But I think that the Government are so busily engaged in trying to be strictly fair to those men serving overseas, who at present cannot be got home, that they are succeeding very well in being fair to no one, and imposing great hardships on everyone, whether they be serving at home or abroad. Two wrongs do not make a right, and I think the time has come for the Government to review their policy in the light of the common-sense view which, as the noble Viscount, Lord Samuel, has pointed out, must be held by those serving in the far corners of the world whose release may be delayed by uncontrollable circumstances.\n\nI will make one final point, very briefly, before I sit down. Apart from the vast labour entailed by the alteration of factories and workshops from war to peace, a great many of them, as your Lordships know, are worn out and out of date after six gruelling years of war during which we have had little or no opportunity of maintaining normal and necessary repairs and renewals, and the plants have had to be kept at work day and night, day in and day out. I can assure your Lordships that manufacturers are not being slow to put their house in order, however great the difficulties are. Most of them have got vast schemes of reconstruction and rehabilitation, either already started or else ready to start as soon as the necessary licences can be obtained. All these schemes are being very greatly hindered and delayed by labour shortage, and particularly by the shortage of specialists, due to the Government's dilatory demobilization policy, and grave loss of production is already being incurred. Your Lordships will realize that even in the best circumstances these works of reconstruction interfere very considerably with the normal routine and production of the factory, and that it is most essential to complete them without undue delay. Therefore it is a matter of importance that the necessary releases from the Forces should be accelerated before the great volume of this work reaches its peak; otherwise damage will be done to our national pro- 1027 ductive power from which it may take years and years to recover.\n\nWhatever may be the ultimate future of the ownership of some of these industries—and we learnt something about that yesterday afternoon—it is quite clear that if we are to exist as an industrial nation, they must be put in good order at the very earliest moment. If the Government play their part wisely, I personally have the greatest possible faith in the future of British industry, where still the greatest manufacturing genius in the world is to be found. But it is quite clear that it will need all the assistance it can get to build up its strength before it has to face the full blast of the bitter east wind of foreign competition. Certainly it owes no bouquets to the present Government in regard to the demobilization policy, which imposes hardship on industrialists and Service men alike and, furthermore, commends itself to not one single section of the British public.\n\n§ THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD NATHAN)\n\nMy Lords, when I listened last Thursday to the opening speech of the noble Lord, Lord Llewellin, on this Motion, I could not help contrasting that in some degree with the debate on the previous day, opened by the noble and gallant Viscount, Lord Trenchard, for it seemed to me that the two debates might well have been inverted and that it would have been more logical had we been \"off with the old\" before we were \"on with the new.\" But yet there was this in common between the two occasions. Those who spoke on the Motion of the noble Viscount put forward the suggestion that an effort should be made on the part of the Forces to invite the men to remain in the Forces towards the building up of a post-war Army, and, if I understood aright something that fell from the noble Viscount, Lord Samuel, this afternoon, he also is of the opinion that it would be helpful if a statement to that effect were made, so that those in the Forces may know what the future may have for them. In a sense it is a little inconsistent with that that the whole burden of the debate both on Thursday and to-day has been in regard to the necessity for diminishing the Armed Forces as speedily as maybe.\n\n1028 It may perhaps be helpful that I should say this, in the light of what was said both last Wednesday and Thursday: that of course the Government are now proceeding with the consideration of the structure of the post-war Army. While no decision has yet been taken as to the size, structure, composition or shape of the post-war Army, it is hoped by the middle of next month—the 15th December is the date at which we aim, and this applies to all the Forces—that it will be possible to make a statement on the terms and conditions of service for other ranks, giving information which will be helpful to those who are considering whether or not to make their future career in the Forces. The terms and conditions as they affect officers are expected to follow without any great delay.\n\nThe main burden of the speeches made by Lord Llewellin and Viscount Samuel have been that the demobilization has been too slow and the ultimate figure in the programme before the public is too high. As I listened to Lord Samuel's speech, when he referred to the fact that the German war had been over for so many months and the Japanese war for so many fewer months, I could not help remembering that after all it is only thirty-seven weeks since the Allied Armies were battling on the Rhine and the battle for Germany had not even begun on the soil of Germany. It is only thirty-seven weeks since that battle was at its height and all the Forces of the Allies were most heavily engaged. It seems to me that what is remarkable in the time that has since passed and the short period that His Majesty's Government have held office, is not how little but how much has been achieved. His Majesty's Government share with those who have spoken, and with all those who hold similar opinions, the view that it is of the first importance that the industrial force available in this country should become as large as possible, as soon as possible. Upon that there is no difference between us, and the aim of His Majesty's Government is to ensure that end, but always subject to there remaining in the Armed Forces of the Crown sufficient to meet our foreseeable commitments, including, of course, our commitments to the World Organization.\n\nNow what was the position of His Majesty's Government when, at the end of the Japanese war, within a few days of 1029 entering upon office, they were confronted with the necessity of considering the problems and the processes of demobilization? Their first task was to ascertain what was the appropriate objective at which to aim. It is true, of course, as both Lord Llewellin and Lord Samuel have said, that the Government have sought the advice of their trusted counsellors, the Chiefs of Staff; but it is equally true that, having weighed, assessed and evaluated the advice given them by the Chiefs of Staff, they have accepted and do accept the sole and full responsibility for the decisions taken. The Government both recognize and accept that responsibility. The target could only be arrived at by a species of crystal gazing. The Chiefs of Staff, in advising the Government, and the Government, in evaluating that advice, were in the position of having to form sonic opinion, on the very morrow of the finish of the war with Japan, as to the target which should be set before the Government and the Services. They arrived at the figure to which Lord Samuel has referred, a figure which will mean a run down in the Armed Forces by no negligible amount, a run down from rather more than five millions to a little more than two millions in the period to the 30th June of next year. That is a diminution of the Armed Forces of the Crown by sonic three million during that period.\n\nIt must not be assumed that that target is necessarily related to the strength of the post-war Armed Forces of the Crown. It was a figure which was ascertained after the end of the Japanese war, taking into account our commitments, actual and potential, so far as they were foreseeable. It is a figure to which the demobilization scheme has so far been directed, but it is not, of course, a final figure. It is scarcely necessary for me to say that that target is at all times under review and the time cannot be too far distant when a decision will be taken as to what figure should be substituted. There, again, however, it is a question of crystal gazing, having regard to the situation which has developed since August of this year and having regard to all those matters which any Government must take into account, in-chiding our obligations to the United Nations Organization. In a sense the position, when the decision comes to be given, will be rather like that which arises when an appeal comes before the Court of 1030 Criminal Appeal; while the appellant hopes that the sentence may be lower, it is, of course, always possible that it may be higher. It is the hope of His Majesty's Government that it may be possible without too great a delay to put forward a lower target. I hope I have made it clear that whatever that target may be, whether it be higher or lower, it is dependent upon the circumstances existing at the time.\n\nThe noble Earl, Lord Dudley, made, as indeed did Lord Samuel, a broad attack upon the demobilization scheme as such; nor was Lord Llewellin silent upon that point. There are certain criteria by which any demobilization scheme must be judged, and I will put them in this way. Is it a scheme which has about it the qualities both of smoothness and of swiftness? Has it a smooth passage with the troops, and by means of it have the troops a smooth passage into civilian life?\n\n§ LORD NATHAN\n\nThe question of the age of the Canadian seems to me to be irrelevant. The point made by the noble Lord was that a Canadian airman could get out of the Canadian Air Force after three and a half years service and a British soldier could not get out of the British Army within the same period. That would be a complete misconception.\n\nThe machinery which operates the de-mobilization scheme has been thoroughly run in and is working extremely well. I have seen it myself in more than one place and I would say to your Lordships, with a due sense of responsibility, that it is a model of efficiency. Its capacity is sufficiently elastic to enable it to cope with any peak release which may arise due to fluctuation from time to time. The average number passing through the dispersal centres was stated in October of this year by the Minister of Labour to be 43,000 a week. By October it had risen to 80,000 a week and from now to the end of the year there will be 85,000 weekly, or 12,000 a day, passing through the centres. There is a limit, of course, to the capacity of the record offices and the pay offices, and also of the clothing depots, but the scheme is working well. So far as the system of documentation at release centres is concerned, which is the key to the whole release system, those centres, any one of them, can work on the footing of 60 men an hour or a man a minute.\n\n1032 I said that it was essential that the scheme should be both smooth and swift. The release target by June 30 you already know. To October 15, which is the latest date at my disposal, 543,000 odd had been released, as against a target of 548,000. There was therefore a deficiency of only one per cent. I ought to say this. The reason why more was not done, why a higher figure was not reached earlier, was the inevitable time-lag of eight or nine weeks between the taking of a decision to speed up release and the reflection of that decision in the actual releases themselves.\n\nIt would be a mistake. however, to relate the actual releases to the figure of those immediately available for; industry, because, as your Lordships are aware, not only have those who come out of the Services by the ordinary, general system of release 56 days' release leave, but they have an additional leave of one day for every month spent abroad, so that it is quite possible that in large numbers of cases men already released may be on leave for a period of between ninety and a hundred days. There is therefore a considerable time-lag between the moment at which the release is effected and the moment at which a man will be available for industry, if he decides to spend on leave the whole of the time given to him for that purpose. Indeed, it is probably true that at this moment there are 300,000 men already released who are on leave, and who, as their leave works off, will take their place in industry. While over half a million had been released by the middle of last month, just under a million remain to be released between that date and the end of this year. I am assured by all the Services that despite all the difficulties of transport which we have had to face, and of which some noble Lords opposite are aware, and despite all other difficulties, we shall fulfil that programme by December 31.\n\nNoble Lords will naturally say: \"What of next year?\" I believe that I can fairly say this in relation to the programme announced by the Minister of Labour, that if nothing unforeseen happens, if no new commitments arise, if existing commitments are not extended, if there is no breakdown in shipping nor any diversion of shipping which might, for instance, be necessitated by the developments in Java; if everything goes according to plan, then all the Services 1033 will do better than appears from the programme which has, been submitted to the public. It is expected that the Army will have fulfilled its part of the programme at a date later, indeed, than March 31, the date propounded by Mr. Churchill in the recent debate in another place, but appreciably earlier than the target date of June 30. The Royal Navy also anticipate being ahead of schedule, while the Royal Air Force expect to be up to schedule, in spite of four new groups, as already announced, having been added to their programme in the Minister of Labour's statement in October. It may be that our anticipations are optimistic, in a sense; it may be that situations will arise which may postpone their fulfilment in the way that we should wish; but, as matters stand at the moment, that is the prospect which we envisage.\n\nNoble Lords may ask, and I think I have asked, why demobilization cannot be made speedier even within the target which we have set ourselves. Let me give an indication of some of the reasons. It is not now, as matters have developed, so much a question of transport. Difficulties were anticipated with regard to transport which I am glad to say have been overcome, and, unless there is some unexpected breakdown there, transport is not a factor which we need necessarily take into account within the limits of the programme which we have set ourselves. But I see, as matters stand, no prospect of extending the amount of transport likely to be available in the immediate future. The mere physical situation, the mechanical position, requires that a period of eight or nine weeks should elapse before a decision can be made effective as regards the release at all events of those in the oversea theatres in the East. Many men cannot be released until their replacements have arrived. Their replacements may be technical or they may not. But, if they are technical, then the period may be somewhat longer, because we have to train the technical replacements here. We are suffering in some degree from our own virtues. In the early days of the war, it was often held against the Army—and no doubt against the other Services too, but I know against the Army—that it had an unhappy knack of getting round pegs into square holes. The Army, therefore, set itself to get round pegs 1034 into round holes, by re-sorting, and it was highly successful in getting the right men into the right place.\n\nVISCOUNT STONEHAVEN\n\nMy Lords, I am in entire agreement with what has been said from this side of the House and I find myself somewhat embarrassed through most of the points I was going to raise having been already covered. There is one point, however, which I think deserves stressing a little more, and that is the point about endeavouring to be fair to all and being fair to none. We have been told that roughly half the numbers in the Forces are in this country and half are overseas. I see no point in having the lot \"browned off\" when you can at least satisfy a portion. May I elaborate that a little more? When once you are out, you are out, and you soon forget all the troubles you have been in; but when the demobilization process has taken a long time and you come back to queues, no houses, restrictions and all the rest of it, the grudge lasts, and you get people in a bad state of mind for a longer period instead of some people in a bad state of mind for a short period. The vital thing, to my mind, is time, and there is one method whereby the time-lag which has been mentioned—that is, the fifty-six days' leave—could be eliminated, so as to get people back into industry at least that much sooner. I see no reason why the demobilization leave should not be given to men in this country in advance —that is to say, fifty-six days in advance of the date on which they are to be demobilized. That would at least have 1045 two advantages. One is that their demobilization benefits would not be aggregated with their wages for the purposes of Income Tax, which is the case at the moment and which is preventing men from taking on jobs during their leave. The other advantage is that they would get straight back to work, which is where we want them.\n\nI must again mention the point raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Samuel, about the order in which men entered the Forces. I apologize for doing so, but I was myself in the category concerned and I give that as my reason for returning to the matter. The majority of men in the building trade were fully employed on constructional work until early in 1942, and it was not until then that they were permitted to volunteer for any branch of the Services. At that date those of us who could volunteer did so. That means that men of my own age and a great many younger than myself are now between groups 30 and 40. Those groups, 10 far as anyone can see, will not be reached until midsummer next year. Therefore it appears to me that the only solution to the building trade problem is the B release—I do not know if there is any significance in that title, but some people think so. That, as has been remarked, and it does not need any emphasis on my part, is a thoroughly unpopular thing. We had some harrowing details of the difficulties involved. To meet anybody who has actually been released under the B scheme is a pretty rare thing, but I do happen to have done that in one case. I think it might be of interest to your Lordships to hear what junior officers and this man had to say on the subject and how he was released under that scheme.\n\nThis lad is younger than myself. He was in Germany. Before the war he was an agricultural student, but he happened to be filling in time before he was called up, and was employed by his father, who is an engineer, as a chainman. I may explain that a chainman is a man who holds the other end of the tape when you are measuring. He did that for a period of two or three months. One evening, at five o'clock, he was suddenly sent for by his Company Commander, who said: \"You are to be released under the B scheme as an architect.\" He replied: \"But I am not an architect.\" The officer 1046 said: \"That does not matter. Here it is on the paper. You are to be released under the B scheme as an architect, if you accept. Do you accept?\" The man said: \"I want to think this over.\" \"No,\" answered the officer, \"you must reply now, because I have to reply tomorrow.\" There is the point my Lords—reply to-morrow.\" The man said: \"Well, if somebody says I am an architect, yes. Anything to get out.\" That is the only fellow I know who has been released under the B scheme. It is perfectly true; it is not a good yarn.\n\nTo come to a little more serious matter, is it not fairly obvious that the B scheme has not worked? If you want to make it work, I can tell you exactly how to do it. All you need to do is to increase your bid. The only reason men will not accept is that it is not financially to their advantage to do so. That is the hard and fast fact. That is one aspect of it. Here is another. We hear harrowing stories of the difficulties of working the B scheme. I must say that I think the Quartermaster's Department has a lot to do with this. That Department, when talking about the officer's armchair, says: \"Chair, reclining, officer's.\" When they try to get men out under the B scheme they shuffle among their papers, amongst which are those of a lot of people who are dead, and 'hunt up the particulars. There are thousands of clerks working 'day and night trying to get out those details. Then they try to find out where these men are, as they have been posted to various places, and eventually a man who has no intention of accepting is offered release under the B scheme. It appears to me that a more sensible way of doing this would be to call for volunteers under the B scheme in all units, send back the names of the men willing to come out and choose from those men. Surely that would speed up matters.\n\nI must refer to another matter which has been mentioned, though I am sorry I cannot remember which noble Lord raised it. It seems to me that if technical direction were available a great deal better use could be made of the labour which we now have. It is the direction which is lacking and that direction is in the Forces. Largely—very often, at any rate—the man has risen and become an officer. Officers are at a very great disadvantage in getting out as compared 1047 with other ranks. That may be right or it may be wrong, but it is nevertheless the fact. It is that direction which is needed to make use of the existing labour.\n\nA lot has been said about the difficulty of forecasting the size of the Services in the future. I entirely agree with that and so does everyone. There are, however, two facts which must be apparent. One is that the Armed Forces will not be smaller than they were before the war and the other is that the Government must know what is left of the pre-war permanent Army. They have, therefore, a margin on which they can work. There are many old men—I admit I am speaking from experience only in my own unit—who would elect to stay on in the Services at the present time without worrying about terms. They are better off where they are now and they know it. They would stay, but they are being turned out now and young men, who have a job to do, are being kept on. The noble Lord, Lord Nathan, said, quite rightly, that the demobilization machine was now nicely run in. I would like to say that the normal thing which an engineer does, after running a machine in, is to have a go at speed trials. Cannot we have some speed trials with this demobilization scheme?\n\nI now wish to talk on rather a restricted field—namely, the position of the Royal Marine Engineers. They are a small technical unit. Their other ranks are composed entirely of building trade operatives and their officers are all architects, engineers, surveyors and so on. They are all technical men. Among the large majority of those officers and men there is a feeling that they are at a disadvantage. I do not know whether this is true, but what I want to do is to get an answer from His Majesty's Government. They feel they are doing next to nothing except contract work for the Admiralty, work which is normally done by civilian labour. As far as we know, the only cost that is returned—anyway from the actual sites—is the cost of material. No cost of labour is returned from the sites that we know of. If that is so, the Admiralty are getting away with the cost of labour, which is being charged—as far as we know again —presumably to the Service Vote. The feeling is that the Admiralty are sitting back, rubbing their hands and saying: 1048 \"This is a good thing; the longer it goes on the better.\" That is the feeling. I hope it is not true and if so I hope I shall be corrected, because it is having a very bad effect on the morale of these men.\n\nWhen I was in that unit we were told, unofficially anyway, that we were barred from any class B release. If you bar an entire engineering unit it seems to me you are barring just the kind of men you want to get out. I do not know if that is so, but that is the feeling. Certainly, to my knowledge, at the time I left only one man had been released under Class B. I know of one case where an architect, who was very closely associated with Howard House, was refused release and sent out to Australia, where he is now. That occurred after VJ Day. Right throughout the war all the staff work of the Royal Marine Engineers was carried out by a very gallant old gentleman who had the China ribbon up. As a matter of fact, if you wanted to get on his right side you said, \"What is that decoration?\" and he was very pleased to tell you. That gallant old gentleman carried on, with the assistance of one junior officer, right through until after VE Day. He was over seventy, but he was fully capable of doing the job and he did do a good job. He was turned out neck and crop in spite of volunteering to stay on; he was not even allowed the courtesy of calling himself \"Colonel.\" A complete new staff was drafted on to the Royal Marine Engineers; certainly seven, and I believe nine, officers replaced that gallant old gentleman. There may have been a very good reason for that but I do not know what it is and I should be very glad to be told. That sort of thing is not convincing to the men in the unit who think they are not getting a fair deal in demobilization.\n\nI think I have already said quite enough, but I would like to tell you that the only means by which I managed to extricate myself from that predicament—I was in release group 31—was to say I wished to come to your Lordships' House and that I believed I could do so. After a period of two months' consideration they decided there was no method whereby they could stop me, and I am afraid I am here. For every two months I sit here I \"tick up\" one release group, so I do not know how I am going to get out.\n\n§ THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD JOWITT)\n\nMy Lords, I might perhaps usefully occupy your Lordships' time for a few minutes only in dealing with some of the points which have been made in the last two very interesting speeches. I want to put this to your Lordships. We have worked out a plan, and to that plan we are adhering. Criticism from your Lordships' House has been on two diametrically opposite lines. On the one hand, the noble Lord, Lord Llewellin, said that it was a policy of \"drift, drift, drift.\" That is to say, he says that we are not steering by the compass at all, but just letting ourselves be blown wherever the wind happens to blow us. On the other hand, the noble Earl, Lord Dudley, said that we were adhering too rigidly to a plan, and that we were foolish not to alter our plan and make it more flexible to deal with the situation as it emerges from day to day. Both those criticisms cannot be right; they rule each other out altogether, and your Lordships must really choose which horse to back. Is it that we are drifting and have no plan at all, or is it, on the other hand, that we are adhering much too rigidly to the plan which we have?\n\n1052 I submit that we are taking the proper course in adhering to the plan commonly called the Bevin plan, because the Bevin plan has certain very great advantages. On the other hand, I am very conscious of the need, the clamant need, to get back more workers for our industry. If I am asked whether we are going to speed up demobilization, I would ask your Lordships to consider this figure. We have had a machine which was slow to start, I quite agree; disappointingly slow, I quite agree. Our total releases down to October 31 were 711,000. Our target for the end of the year, two months later, is, as your Lordships know, over 1,500,000. I believe that we are going to reach that target, and therefore in the two months, November and December, we have to discharge the difference between those two figures, which is roughly of the order of 800,000. If I take the period as eight weeks—it is rather longer, but it eases my arithmetic to take it as eight weeks—that gives a weekly average of 100,000, or a daily average of 14,000. If we do achieve that figure, a weekly average of 100,000, that is pretty speedy; I do not think it could be suggested that we could improve on that.\n\nNow that is all very well, but do let us consider this. Are you going to have these men coming back in a sort of unregulated scramble, or are you going to try to get them back in an orderly and regulated way? The noble Earl, Lord Dudley, said—and we all know it to be true—that there are many of our factories which have to be re-tooled and modernized before they can be effectively used, and, at the present moment, the labour you want for those factories is that labour which is able to do the retooling and modernizing; it is not the labour that will come to those factories when they have been re-tooled. We must not imagine that the greatest good will be done if we try to get out the greatest number of men without any sort of regard to what is going to happen to them when they come out of the Army. I would ask that we should concentrate on an orderly and regulated method, and if we do make good that target and discharge 800,000 men between now and the end of the year, I am quite certain that that will be as many as industry can digest for the time being. Then, of course, for the next six months, down to June 30 next year, we have to discharge rather more than 1053 another 1,500,000 men. So we bring down our Armed Forces from approximately 5,250,000 — or rather less, in fact—to 2,200,000 or thereabouts.\n\nNow I want to say that our limiting factor is not transport. The limiting factor is what Armed Forces shall we want by the end of June next year? It is too early yet to say what we shall need, but we cannot consider cutting down and allowing demobilization to go on to an unlimited extent. We must have regard to our possible needs and we must have regard to the situation in various parts of the world. And, though I hope that time will prove that the figure of 2,200,000 is excessive, we are not prepared at the, present time to say that it is so. It must always be remembered that if you want accurately to measure demobilization you must not merely subtract from 5,250,000 the figure 2,200,000, because, of course, the latter figure will have been swollen by the new intake. That surely is right. That is our limiting factor at the present time, and I have yet to hear any of your Lordships definitely pledge yourselves to the view that the world situation is so clear and so easy that we ought, at the present time, to prepare our plans for cutting down further than that. I hope, naturally, that we shall be able to go down further than that.\n\nNext, may I say something about the speech of Lord De L'Isle with regard to our labour force? I have not the figures but my recollection is from what I have heard—and I have heard them quoted before—that his figures are right. The lesson they show, I think, is this. We shall have hereafter to use our labour more effectively and we must try to increase our output. We must modernize our plan, and our methods, and also try to, see that more of our labour does go into production. There was nothing that impressed any of us more, in looking at the figures of, the call-up in the time of the Coalition Government, than to find what an overwhelming proportion of men came, not from production, but from distribution. I feel certain that in the future, if we are going to achieve all we want to do, we must get a larger number of men into production, and we must see that those men in production are so placed and sc circumstanced, and the factories so tooled and machined, that a far greater output can be obtained. That, I believe, is one 1054 of the problems before us, and for that reason I would say, do not let us get into an unregulated scramble in this matter.\n\nWe do not look upon the Bevin scheme as part of the law of the Medes and Persian's which cannot possibly be altered. Of course it can, and we should indeed be foolish if we did not learn, in the light Of experience, what we ought to learn. But in view of the feeling there was after the last war about demobilization, of the suspicion of the soldiers with regard to what were called key-men—as many of your Lordships will recollect—are we not right to take no risks of that happening again? We have a scheme which, at any rate, has this merit; that it commends itself to the Armed Forces. I suggest that His Majesty's Government would be foolish to jettison that scheme unless there is any really very serious case for so doing. At the present moment I do not think that there is such a case. I concede at once that for the few months that the machine has been operating it has worked disappointingly slowly. But now the machine is properly \"revved up\" I believe it is going to work—as I said before—quite as fast, and give us quite as large a number of men as industry can absorb. In these circumstances, I am not prepared, at the present time, to say that any drastic amendment in the Bevin scheme is necessary.\n\nNow as to Class B. That figure was fixed very carefully. We came to the conclusion in the old days—and I think that conclusion was right—that at no time should B releases exceed, as a maximum, 10 per cent. of the A releases. Your Lordships all know why we came to that conclusion. The reason was that we were advised that unless we did so the soldiers would not think that the scheme was fair. At the present moment the position is that up to the 31st October Class B releases were 39,000, and they were gaining impetus rapidly."
