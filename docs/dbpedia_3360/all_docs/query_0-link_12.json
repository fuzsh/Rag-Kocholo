        "text": "Born: February 2 1931, Collyhurst, Manchester, England\n\nDied: June 10 1993, Whalley Range, Manchester, England\n\nby PETER TATCHELL (copyright 2012)\n\nFor a quarter of a century he was one of Britain’s most cherished comedians, a man who not only said funny things and said things “funny” but, on occasion, looked funny while he was saying them. Les Dawson was perhaps the last bastion of the British music hall, relying on clever wordplays, facial expressions and outlandish appearance in pursuit of a solid belly laugh.\n\nStarting out as a singer, Manchester-born Les soon realized his short chubby looks were more suited to making people laugh than swoon, but by his mid-thirties (with success eluding him and a family to support) he was on the brink of admitting defeat and getting a day job.\n\nBut national exposure on Opportunity Knocks in 1967 proved the catalyst and by decade’s end Dawson had his own series Sez Les on Yorkshire Television and was a regular participant in the company’s new Jokers Wild gagfest. The following year he began a long association with BBC radio and was heard in such shows as Our Les and Listen to Les.\n\nLes wasn’t just a run-of-the-mill joke teller … he was a talented musician who knew how to play the piano excruciatingly badly, he had a lugubrious expression oft-times resembling “a sack of spanners” (to use his own words) and was more than adept at appearing gormless in a variety of guises.\n\nHis shows were also enlivened by a gallery of regular Dawson characters: most notable being dumpy housewife Ada (inspired by, and a tribute to, the revered Northern comic Norman Evans). With Roy Barraclough as gossipy neighbour Cissie, the Dawson talent for facial distortion and vocal meandering came into full play. John Cleese was also a regular participant in the early years, being an unashamed fan of the newcomer.\n\nAfter ten years as Yorkshire’s chief funnyman, Les was lured to BBC Television in 1978 (at a time when Morecambe and Wise had deserted them for ITV company Thames). But unlike the legendary double act, his popularity wasn’t affected by the switch.\n\nThe 1980s was a turbulent time for British comedians of the old school … their schoolyard was rapidly being taken over by crowds of “alternative” playmates who decreed that mothers-in-law and busty blondes were no longer to be included in the syllabus and the most popular new subject was to be political correctness.\n\nLes knew what he was good at and, thanks to the BBC, he was allowed to keep doing it. Each year saw new seasons of his BBC1 and Radio 2 offerings, but by the middle of the decade the latter stages of his wife’s terminal illness forced him to lessen his workload.\n\nIn late 1984 he took over from Terry Wogan as host of the game show Blankety Blank, and would make it his personal plaything for six years, relegating the panel of celebrities to a glittering gaggle of straightmen (sorry, “straightpersons”). And his love of the English language continued to find expression in an array of humorous novels and (eventually) two volumes of autobiography.\n\nIn 1990, Dawson fronted a revived version of Opportunity Knocks and the following year a frustratingly mediocre game show called Fast Friends. Les could also be seen in the lead role of the bizarre play Nona on BBC2 and was the standout performer at that year’s Royal Variety Show. But now his own health was becoming a problem and he had to contend himself with being guest on other people’s chat shows and a recurring character part in the Griff Rhys Jones/Martin Clunes drama series, Demob. His final TV appearance was on Cilla Black’s Surprise Surprise.\n\nLes Dawson was felled by a fatal heart attack in June 1993 (ironically whilst visiting hospital for a checkup). Twenty years later he is still fondly remembered as a very funny man, and sadly missed.\n\nRadio\n\nCOMEDY PARADE\n\nSeries 1: Light Thursday 8-00pm October 1 1964\n\nGOING PLACES starring Les Dawson, Ray Fell\n\nSeries 3: R2 Sunday 2-30pm February 21 1971\n\nOUR LES starring Les Dawson, Joe Gladwin\n\nLES DAWSON – MAN OF FICTION\n\nR4 (North) Thursday 12-25pm February 26 to April 2 1970\n\nwith Les Dawson, Robert Dorning, Joe Gladwin, Sandra Gough, Daphne Oxenford\n\nOUR LES (pilot in COMEDY PARADE)\n\nSeries 1: R2 Wednesday 8-00pm December 8 1971 to January 26 1972\n\nSeries 2: R2 Sunday 2-30pm December 31 1972 to February 25 1973\n\nepisodes 3 and 9 are in BBC Archives\n\nwith Les Dawson\n\nLISTEN TO LES\n\nSeries 1: R2 Sundays 2-00pm July 7 to August 25 1974\n\nepisode 6 is in BBC Archives\n\nSeries 2: R2 Sundays 2-00pm June 8 to July 27 1975\n\nepisode 3 is in BBC Archives\n\n*** MIKE YARWOOD IN THE LES DAWSON SHOW\n\nR2 Monday 1-00pm August 25 1975 (50 min)\n\nheld in BBC Archives\n\nSeries 3: R2 Sunday 2-00pm October 17 to December 5 1976\n\nepisode 1 is in BBC Archives\n\nSeries 4: R2 Sunday 2-00pm August 7 to September 25 1977\n\nepisode 3 is in BBC Archives\n\nSeries 5: R2 Sunday 10-30pm October 1 to November 19 1978\n\nepisode 1 is in BBC Archives\n\nSeries 6: R2 Sunday 1-30pm November 18 1979 to January 6 1980\n\nepisode 1 is in BBC Archives\n\nSeries 7: R2 Sunday 1-30pm December 7 1980 to January 25 1981\n\nall episodes are in BBC Archives\n\nSeries 8: R2 Sunday 1-30pm January 10 to March 28 1982\n\nall episodes (except show 3) are in BBC Archives\n\nSeries 9: R2 Sunday 1-30pm July 10 to September 25 1983\n\nepisodes 1 to 3 and 10 to 12 are in BBC Archives\n\nSeries 10: R2 Sunday 4-00pm January 20 to March 24 1985\n\nall episodes are in BBC Archives\n\nwith Les Dawson, Colin Edwynn, Daphne Oxenford, Roy Barraclough (series 9)\n\nTHE CHRISTMAS LAUGHALONG\n\nR2 Friday 11-00pm December 24 1982 (60 min)\n\nwith Les Dawson, Roy Castle, Eli Woods, Daphne Oxenford\n\nMARRIOTT’S MONOLOGUES\n\nR2 Thursday 9-45pm September 5 1991 (15 min): Les Dawson\n\nNEVER GIVE A SUCKER AN EVEN BREAK – tribute to W.C.
