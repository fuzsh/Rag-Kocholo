It is over two centuries since Daniel Thwaites set out from his family’s Lake District farm to make a new life for himself, and the rest they say, is history. Daniel built up his brewery based on strong family values – an eye for quality and a generous blend of innovation, craftsmanship and warm hospitality. Who would have believed, six generations later, that his family would proudly continue the journey he started and remain faithful to his principles – still striving for brewing perfection, now with a growing collection of pubs, inns, hotels and spas.\n\nToday, our company flourishes and remains steadfastly faithful to Daniel’s principles. Independent and full of character, we proudly continue the journey he started."
