Using theories developed by behavioural scientists, we and the participants delved into the ways we as marketers are able to make stories land most effectively for different audiences, and the art of making the complex simple. Despite storytelling being woven into our daily routines from a very early age, data seems to take the lead role so often. This session was an excellent reminder that whatever space we're operating in, our stories should bring our truths to life and evoke feelings, underpinned by a strong foundation of science. I loved getting involved with this work.
