        "text": "Judy Woodruff:\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier is one of the largest glaciers in Antarctica, and it is melting at an alarming rate. The world took notice earlier this month when temperatures there hit nearly 70 degrees.\n\nBut getting a better read on what's happening has been a challenge.\n\nOur science correspondent, Miles O'Brien, gave scientists David Holland and his team camera equipment to document their mission to the glacier.\n\nMiles has this dispatch, as part of our series the Leading Edge.\n\nMiles O’Brien:\n\nIt's an urgent scientific mission at the far edge of what's possible, to the edge of a massive melting glacier.\n\nIt's the largest, most menacing source of rising sea levels all over the world. Welcome to the Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica.\n\nOur guide on this journey is David Holland a professor of math and atmosphere/ocean science at New York University. He is a principal investigator on the MELT Project, part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration.\n\nThe five-year campaign is funded by the U.K. Natural Environment Research Council and the U.S. National Science Foundation, a \"NewsHour\" funder as well.\n\nWhy is Thwaites so important? Why is it worth the effort?\n\nDavid Holland:\n\nSo, it's the most vulnerable place on Earth. And the curious thing is, how is it that it's so vulnerable and, at the same time, it has warm water in front of it today?\n\nThese are just two things that may be coincidental, but they're both real, and they're happening.\n\nMiles O’Brien:\n\nFor years, scientists have warily watched Thwaites from afar, using NASA satellites. About the size of Florida, it is vanishing at an alarming rate, retreating about a half-mile and thinning as much as 15 feet every year.\n\nIt sits on land below sea level. There is nothing to stop its accelerating retreat. It could melt away in a few decades. Some call it the Doomsday Glacier.\n\nIf Thwaites were to melt or drop into the sea tomorrow, how much sea level rise would we expect?\n\nDavid Holland:\n\nSo, it's less than a meter. It's probably on order of, say, 65 centimeters. Then the neighboring ice would become unstable. And so, altogether, it would be more than three meters of ice, something of the scale of 10 feet.\n\nIt's a major change, a rewriting of the coastline.\n\nMiles O’Brien:\n\nThwaites is like a cork in a bottle. Once it is gone, there will be nothing to stop a cascading loss of nearly all the glaciers in West Antarctica.\n\nThat is why Holland wanted to come to this place, to drill a half-mile hole through the ice to see what's happening underneath. It's never been done before, and it very nearly didn't happen this Antarctic summer.\n\nMiles O’Brien:\n\nIn November, they flew to Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\nWithin a few days, they were on a U.S. Air Force Air Mobility Command C-17 stuffed to the gills with scientists, support crews and gear. After a five-hour-long flight due south 2,300 miles, they landed at McMurdo Station, headquarters for the National Science Foundation in Antarctica.\n\nBut they were still more than 1,300 difficult miles away from their camp on Thwaites, and the weather was terrible, and the airplanes kept breaking down. What was to be a one-week stop at McMurdo for briefings, training and practice became more than a month.\n\nBy the time they got to Thwaites, all the weather and mechanical trouble left them barely enough time to do their science, but safety first.\n\nSeth Campbell:\n\nIf you zoom in here, we can show you what they look like.\n\nThe way radar works is, we're imaging layers in the snowpack below us. So, we can see there's crevasse here. And we can see there's actually a crevasse here as well.\n\nMiles O’Brien:\n\nThey also looked beneath the ice using another technique called seismic reflection, ironically often used by the oil industry to find places to drill.\n\nBut, in this case, they are making an underground map to ensure they are where the ice transitions from sitting on the rock to floating in the ocean, the so-called grounding line.\n\nThey detonated some small buried explosives, akin to fireworks.\n\nLizzy Clyne is a doctoral candidate at Penn State.\n\nLizzy Clyne:\n\nWhen we set off that explosive charge, that creates a bunch of seismic energy that radiates down through the ice to the bed, to the bottom of your shelf.\n\nAny sort of change in material will trigger a reflection that comes back to us. And so, this way, we can see whether there's water or there's sediment or there's rock beneath the ice.\n\nMiles O’Brien:\n\nBut when the storm passed, the good weather held, and things fell into place quickly.\n\nAfter 36 hours of hot water drilling, they broke through the bottom of the ice to the ocean a half-mile beneath. They lowered in a remotely operated vehicle called Icefin, which provided some unprecedented images of the ice-covered shore of a glacier.\n\nFunded by NASA, the device was built by a team from Georgia Tech led by astrobiologist Britney Schmidt.\n\nBritney Schmidt:\n\nOne of the things that we don't know very well is exactly how glaciers move and how the very base of the glacier operates.\n\nSo, when we get to see it right up close, right where it hits the ocean, we are seeing the freshest material.\n\nAurora Basinski:\n\nSince turbulence is below detectable levels, that means there isn't as much mixing as potentially we would have expected. And so what that means is that the warm water is mostly staying near the bottom, and not necessarily making its way up to the ice.\n\nDavid Holland:\n\nYes. Yes. Change happens, and this looks like a potential case for change going forward that could be quite impactful.\n\nYou can probably change air temperature over the next century, but the ocean is such a big, sluggish creature that, in a way, when it's doing what it's doing, it's not the kind of thing we can engineer and stop very easily."
