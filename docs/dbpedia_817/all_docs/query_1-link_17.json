        "text": "“The students did a fantastic job on the three stations, which were loaded with sensors that included just about everything you could want to study the conditions around the glacier. But the thing that I was most excited about was this pressure vessel,” Scambos said.\n\nIt was a tiny GoPro, housed inside the pressure vessel, that was the source of Scambos’ enthusiasm. Along with it, the TARSAN team lowered several instruments for measuring oceanic conditions on a journey down an 300-meter (1000-foot) long borehole, through the bottom of the glacier and into the watery depths below. As it advanced, the camera captured the changing layers of the borehole from the rough, twinkling icicles at the top to the older, more compressed ice. The walls became clear and transparent, like windows into the glacier, with the light from the GoPro extending out into what otherwise would have been utter darkness.\n\nOnce the vessel plunged into the salty waters of the Amundsen Sea, it still had a ways to go before reaching the seafloor. Though it was mostly a long lonely trek, there were a few visitors, including a bright orange squid.\n\nThe presence of life beneath the glacier fits in with some of the preliminary findings from this field season: there is warm water circulating under Thwaites.\n\n“The eyes of the world are on us”\n\nTARSAN is one of the ITGC’s eight research projects that study the entire glacier, tackling the question of the glacier's deterioration from a variety of different angles and scientific fields. The task of coordinating a collaborative effort of this scale is one that ITGC scientific coordinator David Vaughan finds both daunting and exciting.\n\n“This project has come at a time when the eyes of the world are on us and people really want answers to these scientific questions,” Vaughan said, who works alongside Scambos as the United Kingdom’s representative.\n\nVaughan traveled to Thwaites with a team of journalists from the BBC to visit the base camp of another research project, called Melting at Thwaites grounding zone and its control on sea level, or MELT for short. MELT's scientists are investigating how warm ocean waters affect the glacier at its grounding line. This area is a crucial place of transition for glaciers, marking where the base of the ice sheet meets warm water and begins to float, becoming an ice shelf. Like TARSAN, MELT also had a hand in giving scientists a never-before-seen look at Thwaites with the help of an autonomous vehicle called Icefin.\n\nThe black and bright yellow robot is no small fry: Icefin weighs 130 kilograms (286 pounds) and is 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) long. Outfitted with both a camera and sensors to measure water parameters like salinity, temperature and turbidity, Icefin took a dive down to the grounding line. The measurements that it captured from this trip will lend help to modeling and predicting the future of Thwaites, while the video footage gave researchers a new, human perspective of the glacier's deterioration. Video images showed a scalloped pattern on the underside of the ice, a sign of turbulence in the warm water as it melts the bottom of the ice.\n\nThough these signs were not unexpected due to previous measurements and modeling, to see it first hand made the evidence even stronger to Vaughan.\n\n“It’s actually a revelation in many ways, a complete revelation,” said Vaughan. “Even if we suspected that some things happening underwater were as they were.”\n\nInvestigating the influence of both land and sea\n\nOther projects that completed field work this season include Geological History Constraints (GHC), Thwaites Interdisciplinary Margin Evolution (TIME) and Thwaites Offshore Research (THOR).\n\nGHC studies the history of the glacier by analyzing samples from the bedrock below the ice at two locations on opposite sides of a large embayment where the largest glaciers are impacted by deep warm water flow: Mt. Murphy and the Hudson Mountains. By looking at the radioactive signatures of these samples, scientists can determine retreats and advances in the ice sheet from the last several thousand years. The team at Mt. Murphy collected four bedrock samples by drilling through the surface, while the Hudson Mountains team used radar to identify good drill sites for the next research season.\n\nShear margins on glaciers are where the fast moving ice flowing out of the glacier meets a boundary of more stationary ice. At these margins the ice rapidly moving downstream in the glacier can eat into the stationary ice, grabbing it and carrying it along on its outbound journey. It’s a central process to the melting of Thwaites that has larger implications for the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet as a whole. TIME investigated shearing activity on the sides of the glacier with radar, in preparation for a bigger group that will be conducting research next year.\n\nConducted on board the U.S. Research Vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer, the field season for THOR began in late January, as the team needed to wait for the sea ice on the ocean to retreat before embarking on their research cruise. Data that they collected through March will give insight into ocean conditions further away from Thwaites that could be contributing to its deformation.\n\nThough the central goal of ITGC is to determine the time frame for and consequences of Thwaites’ collapse, the wider mission is to produce research that will benefit scientists studying ice sheet behavior in other locations as well.\n\n“[I hope] that some of the data that we have and the insight into key processes will not just feed into our own modeling projects, but will actually reach into the next generation of projections from the wider ice sheet modeling community,” said Vaughan.\n\nBy Julia Medeiros, University of Colorado Boulder"
