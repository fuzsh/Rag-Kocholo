        "text": "A Kaimai resident who describes State Highway 29 as \"abysmal\" is taking his frustrations to Members of Parliament and Western Bay of Plenty councillors following a serious truck and car crash on the highway last month.\n\nIn a letter to Bay of Plenty MP Tom Rutherford, Minister of Transport Simeon Brown, and WBOPDC councillors Margaret Murray-Benge and Don Thwaites, Gary Benner highlights the state of SH29 and the disruptions caused by serious crashes and road closures.\n\n“Today [July 17] yet again, an accident on the Kaimai Range has disrupted the lives of so many people,” says Gary in his letter.\n\n“Given the state of the road, the huge traffic use, and under resourcing over many decades, I appreciate there are no short solutions. However, as a resident here may I suggest the following to mitigate the massive disruption until the proper resources are allocated.”\n\nTraffic backed-up on SH29 on July 17, 2024, on the Matamata side of the Kaimai Range. Photo: Supplied.\n\nGary then outlines four suggestions.\n\n“When accidents occur, there is assigned a Rapid Response Team to get the road open as quickly as possible. I appreciate the need for ambulances and others to recover, treat, and despatch injured or deceased persons, but by then the RRT should have been able to photograph the scene with a drone to record the necessary evidence, and have removal vehicles ready and waiting to move any crashed vehicles out of the way - even if only to the side to allow traffic to flow again.”\n\nHe acknowledges that accidents seem to happen “at the busiest of times” and goes on to address how the public could be alerted and updated following a crash.\n\n“NEMA System could be used to send mobile alerts to all in the immediate area. There are only two or three cell towers covering the Kaimais so the messages can be localised - and people living here would like to know as well, so people in cars can make informed decisions as to whether to stay / wait in their cars or turn around and return to base.”\n\nGary Benner. Photo: Supplied.\n\nGary, who has worked in Civil Defence Alerting since 2004, also suggests the same system could be used to provide regular updates as to when the road is likely to be cleared.\n\n“Also communicate updates every half hour to SunLive, who do a pretty good job anyway, and the BOP Times so they can update their websites.\n\n“Also update the NZTA Journeys and AA Roadwatch websites half-hourly or as the situation changes - again so people can manage their situation as appropriate.”\n\nTruck crash on SH29. Photo: Supplied.\n\nGary says there could also be better management of the dynamic speed signs “which are often set to 60/80 kph on sunny clear days”.\n\n“The result is that they are not respected by drivers,” says Gary.\n\n“They are also all set to one speed for the whole of each side of the Kaimai Range, so some fog at the top means that people are expected to drive at 80km per hour from just past Soldiers Rd for 5km in clear, sunny, dry conditions.\n\n“This is crazy and sends the message to the drivers that the systems and people controlling it are not doing their job, or the system is deficient, and therefore they will not follow or respect those speed limits.\n\n“Having had a career in building such systems, I see it as very badly designed, and operated, and not fit for purpose.”\n\nTraffic delays on SH29 following a crash in October 2020. Photo: Supplied.\n\nGary's fourth suggestion for mitigating disruptions is to have better signage at exit points.\n\n“For almost nine years I have been campaigning along with Margaret Murray-Benge to have better design and control at the entry and exit points to the highway over the Kaimais. eg. Old Kaimai Rd, Poripori Rd etc,” says Gary.\n\n“While reconstructing these may take some time, a very simple action is to place large signs to indicate / caution drivers approaching these intersections, warning them of vehicles stopping in the right-hand lanes waiting to turn into their respective road.\n\n“My own experience over the last 17 years has often been terrifying as inattentive drivers swerve at the last minute to avoid rear ending my car. My experience is not unique, and has been shared with the whole community, and is well documented already. “Will it take a death or two to get some action for something as simple as this?”\n\nThe Kaimai public meeting held in May 2023. Photo: Gary Benner.\n\nGary also mentions in his letter the public meeting held on May 23, 2023, where these issues were brought to light, and which was attended by politicians and 150 local residents.\n\n“That’s actually almost everybody who lives here,” says Gary who included a link to the Youtube recording of the meeting.\n\n“You may wish to review the video again and make actions to implement at least some of the suggestions to keep our roads safe and effective.\"\n\n“The abysmal state of this road [SH29] means we have serious accidents here on almost a weekly basis, yet there is nothing been done to mitigate the significant effects on people who need to use the road,\" says Gary.\n\n“From disruption to business and personal reasons e.g. just today [June 17] we had a family crisis in the Waikato, and my wife was required to travel there, only to find the road closed indefinitely. Not good enough!”\n\nBay of Plenty MP Tom Rutherford. Photo: Supplied.\n\nBay of Plenty MP Tom Rutherford has responded to Gary’s letter, acknowledging the frustrations that Gary “and many others in the area are facing with serious accidents occurring on an almost weekly basis”.\n\n“We haven’t forgotten the public meeting we attended in May of last year and the frustrations we heard clearly from the local residents on the state of the road and the many safety risks that exist at present,\" says Tom.\n\nCrash on SH29 in October 2020. Photo: Heather Seath.\n\n“We have included State Highway 29 as one of our 17 Roads of National Significance (RoNS) across the country, which will support economic growth and get people and freight to where they want to go, quickly and safely.\n\n“The first seven new Roads of National Significance are expected to begin procurement, enabling works and construction in the next three years.\n\n“State Highway 29 is included as one of these first seven new roads that will begin in the next three years.”\n\nGary Benner has been filming at the intersection hotspots, recording the difficulties experienced by residents exiting the roads onto SH29, for example the Old Kaimai Rd. Photo: Gary Benner.\n\nTom says investments in this essential corridor will make it easier for New Zealanders to get where they need to go, create a more productive and resilient transport network, drive economic growth, and unlock land for thousands of new houses.\n\n“We are taking actions to deliver on our commitment to upgrade State Highway 29 so that this critical road is safe and reliable for Kiwis travelling through the Bay of Plenty,” says Tom.\n\nThe SH29 Roads of National Significance project does not include the stretch of SH29 over the Kaimai Range. Work on SH29 Tauriko West will see improvements from Omanawa bridge to SH29A Barkes Corner and addresses accesses at Belk and Gargan Rds.\n\nNZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi Director of Regional Relationships, David Speirs, says State Highway 29 over the Kaimai Range is a priority route with 14,000 vehicles including several thousand heavy vehicles using the road every day.\n\nNZTA appreciates it is critical to ensure SH29 is safe and accessible for all road users, he says.\n\n“We are aware of community concerns with local road accesses on to SH29 and we’re awaiting outcomes of the 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme, which will provide improvements to safety if funded.”\n\nProposed improvements to the SH29 Tauriko to the Kaimai Range summit will include minor upgrades to rural intersections including signs and markings and potential changes to speed limits at intersections.\n\n“There are many competing priorities across the state highway network nationwide and funding will be allocated based on the highest need,” he says.\n\n“The process of a crash scene is managed and processed by NZ Police. NZTA supports NZ Police with traffic management and communication to road users through social media, Journey Manager and traffic bulletins where required.”\n\nHe says NZTA maintenance crews undertake regular inspections throughout winter and promptly address any defects in the road surface over the Kaimai Range.\n\nIn an effort to improve efficiency and safety, NZTA is undertaking asphalt renewals and other routine maintenance activities such as clearing drains, sign maintenance and road marking in a series of overnight closures this year.\n\n“While disruptive in the short term, everyone benefits from a more reliable and safer route over the Kaimai Range.”"
