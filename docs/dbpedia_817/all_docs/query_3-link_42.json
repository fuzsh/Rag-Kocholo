        "text": "Jason Blum: There are a few movies that you can count on one hand that really got people into scary movies in the first place. And we are about to embark on a journey to make one of those movies.\n\nMalek Akkad: I can honestly say that I am most excited about this grouping here. To be working with this great team at Miramax and obviously, nothing needs to be said about Blumhouse and Jason-\n\nJason Blum: And Ryan (Turek)!\n\nMalek Akkad: And Ryan, of course! We are so thrilled, and this is going to be something that I think will really excite the fans immensely.\n\nJason Blum: All of us felt that the next “Halloween” movie shouldn’t exist without John Carpenter. When we all started talking about it, we were all saying, if we’re going to do this, we’ve got to do this with the guy who started it.\n\n(John Carpenter is introduced.)\n\nJason Blum: John is going to executive produce, godfather, and hopefully score if we can talk him into it. He’s driving a hard bargain, but I’m a good negotiator, so hopefully he’s going to score it too. (John is going to) godfather us, and be involved with this movie creatively. In the initial few conversations that we’ve had with directors, they’ve felt the same way we did. No one wanted to do this without John. So we’re really excited he’s here.\n\nJohn Carpenter: I decided after bitching for years and years about “Halloween” sequels, you know what, if I come aboard and shepherd this thing, and help, and support the director – I’m here with Malek Akkad, and I’m here with the horror superstar, Jason Blum – what could go wrong? So we’re going to give it a try.\n\nQuestion: Is this a brand new version, is this a return to what was before, what are we looking at?\n\nJohn Carpenter: We can’t tell you yet. Because we don’t know!\n\nQuestion: What can you tell us?\n\nJohn Carpenter: We’re probably going to go back to the original traditions that we started with early on. It’s kind of gone astray a little bit. I thought maybe that the remakes went off somewhere that I didn’t want them to go. Michael Myers is not a character. He is a force of nature. He is not a person. He is part supernatural, part human. He’s like the wind. He’s an evil wind. When you start straying away from that, and you get into explaining, you’ve lost. So hopefully we can guide it back in that direction.\n\nJason Blum: We’re not being vague because we know and we’re not telling anyone. We’re being vague because we don’t know. We’re talking about different things. I don’t think we want to make it too meta. I think all of us want to go back to make it like it was.\n\nMalek Akkad: Back to the basics.\n\nJason Blum: Back to the basics, and not get into too much backstory which we don’t need. Right, John?\n\nJohn Carpenter: Exactly.\n\nQuestion: Do you have a timeline in mind?\n\nJason Blum: We don’t have a timeline in mind. My guess is Halloween 2017. (Zanne and Dan from Miramax agree.)\n\nQuestion: Do you feel like this is a project for a promising up and coming director or someone who has proven themselves over the years?\n\nJason Blum: I wouldn’t box myself in to saying specifically either one. But I think it’s more likely that we would work with someone who has a couple movies under their belt. More likely, but not for sure.\n\nQuestion: Is it being looked at as a single film or as a reinvention of the franchise?\n\nJohn Carpenter: (playfully) We’ll see. Won’t say no.\n\nQuestion: How much convincing did they have to do to get you back?\n\nJohn Carpenter: Not much, not much. Malek and I have known each other for awhile and he said, why don’t you come aboard, and I met with Jason, and I was sold. Like I say, horror superstar.\n\nQuestion: How recently did this come together and how much have you been looking at the project?\n\nJohn Carpenter: We just got together. Matter of fact, (Jason) and I met, what, was it two weeks ago?\n\nJason Blum: We met two weeks ago. But our first meeting (with Miramax) was a year ago. And our first meeting with Malek was nine months ago. It’s been a long time.\n\nQuestion: Are you planning on going bigger or is this going to be a smaller scale Blumhouse film?\n\nJason Blum: It will definitely be our scale. We’re not going to make it for $15 million. It will be a Blumhouse style budget, which the original was, as well. The second you start getting into 15 and 20 million dollars, you have to explain everything and do all the kind of “developmenty” things that none of us want to do. There’s a correlation between the budget and the creative end that goes along with it.\n\nQuestion: If you were to do the score for this film, would you want to bring aboard Cody and the band?\n\nJohn Carpenter: You know it!\n\nJason Blum: We really do want John to score it. We’ve had very early conversations with a couple of directors and every director that we’ve talked to wants that to happen, too.\n\nQuestion: What do you see as the biggest challenge for this project?\n\nJohn Carpenter: The biggest challenge is to be true to the original spirit of the movie. Don’t get carried away. Tell a simple story. Tell a frightening story. Don’t get carried away with anything. This is a “Halloween” movie. The original “Halloween” was made for very little money, and it was a little scary tale. That’s what we should be doing."
