We’re interested in undercutting ideas of logic and language by subverting the mind’s ability to decipher meaning. In our time here we’ll be exploring obfuscation through twinning and energetic presence and absence--asking the viewer to determine if we are really there, and if we are two, or just one. We have developed a practice of hiding in plain sight with a desire to question the line between public and private. We trouble closeness by highlighting intimacy, sensuality, temporality, and the body, and we interrogate our assumptions around togetherness, exploring the possibility of being alone onstage with each member of the audience simultaneously.”\n\nTuesday May 11: Work in process performance live streaming on the Imaginists Facebook page at 8 pm. The piece is about 30 minutes long and then we’ll have a conversation with Allie and Rachael about their process, work, and time at the Imaginists.\n\nRachael Dichter is a San Francisco based dancer, performer, choreographer and curator. She makes work about closeness. About the shortest distance and shortening the distance between things - between people.
