        "text": "Make it stand out.\n\nBy Rosie and Richard Sainsbury: Steve, we could not be happier with the photos you took from our wedding day! You captured so many beautiful and happy moments which we can now look back on forever. Many of the guests commented that they could hardly tell that you were there as you were so discreet throughout the entire day and evening and as a result the pictures are so natural which is just what we wanted. For two people that find having our photos taken quite awkward you made us feel completely at ease. We will treasure our photos forever and could not be more grateful of the fantastic job you did. Thank you so much, Rosie and Rich\n\nBy Rahwa + Edson Cardoso: Hi Steve We want to thank you so much for the pictures, they are beautiful. I don't know what We expected but these are absolutely perfect. We made the right choice when we asked you to capture our day. Absolutely amazing. Please be prepared to be photographing more Eritrean weddings in the future as we will recommend you to all that we know.\n\nBy Casey Crilly: Thank you so much for the photos of our wedding! They are all as stunning as the day itself! Stephen does extremely well at merging into the background so you don't even notice he's there, the shots he takes are spot on and if you need/want him to do something for you it is never to much of a hassle for him! His professionalism and manner throughout the day was second to none and I couldn't have asked for a better photographer on the day!! The one thing you want your big day is a very good, solid photographer and Stephen is that and more!! Thank you once again!!\n\nBy Nermin & Stephen Parry: Dear Steve, Thank you for capturing some fabulous, poignant moments on our big day. Your photos will be cherished.\n\nBy Haydn & Alison: Just wanted to say thanks very much for the photos, we're really pleased with them and feel we made the right decision picking you as our photographer.

Best wishes, Haydn & Alison.\n\nBy Jessica Clarke: Richard and I would like to say a massive thank you for our wedding pictures they are great. I am really bad when it comes to pics as you probably know, my eyes are always shut and you did a great job of getting a good collection of pictures. You were brilliant Thanks again Jessica and Richard Thomas\n\nBy Christie & Micha: Hi Steve, I hope you are well. I have just sat down with my family to look through our wedding photos for a second time - they are absolutely amazing and i know i have already thanked you, but i don't feel that i have quite thanked you enough as the photos are truly stunning and we are so happy with them. There are even photos where i didn't realise you were in the room with us! :-) I just wanted to say thank you one more time, you captured the day fantastically and your shots are so artistic! Also thanks for sending through the photos and memory stick so quickly, it has been lovely to be able to view these with my family and relive the day again before we leave. Kind regards Christie\n\nBy Matt and Jen Stephenson: Steve did such an incredible job with our wedding photos and worked tirelessly throughout the whole day.
