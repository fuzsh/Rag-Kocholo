Intended as a photographic record of listed buildings in England at the turn of the century, the project was jointly funded by English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund. Many of the images within the collection were taken by volunteers, and the project ran from 1999 â€“ 2002. For statutory list descriptions, please see the National Heritage List for England (NHLE) on the Historic England website."
