        "text": "David Thwaites, 22, died when the car he was travelling in was involved in an accident near the Warcop Army base on the A66 in Cumbria. He had graduated from RAF College two weeks ago and was due to start training as a pilot next year.\n\nNow, instead of enjoying a family Christmas together, his grief-stricken parents will bury the officer with full military honours at a funeral service to be held on Christmas Eve.\n\nFlying Officer Thwaites' parents Vincent and Pat, of Thornaby, Teesside, had been at their son's graduation at RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, on November 28.\n\nThey said it was the best day of their son's life and they were filled with pride.\n\nFlying Officer Thwaites died in the accident on Monday, December, 16, before he had chance to see any photographs from the ceremony.\n\nThe pictures will now be included in an order of service at the funeral.\n\nThe driver of the car involved in the collision is thought to have suffered a broken leg.\n\nHis father said yesterday: \"It had taken such a long time for him to get in the RAF.\n\nDavid's ambition was to be a pilot and he had gone through seven months officer training.\"\n\nHe had travelled to Scotland on Sunday to take part in a training day, near Elgin.\n\nIt was while he was returning with a friend that the accident happened at about 8pm.\n\nThe airman, the youngest of four children, was due to start pilot training in April.\n\nHis mother said: \"He worked so hard, and he was so proud.\n\n\"We were all so proud of him.\""
