In addition to switching to a triennial schedule, the selection process and number of artists selected changed in 1987. The selection committee chose to exhibit a smaller number of artists, allowing display space for several works per artist. The smaller number of exhibiting artists means that the catalogues for the triennials contain more information on each artist, along with a black and white print of their work. Biographic information includes lists of past exhibitions and collections holding work, professional positions, brief discussion of the artist’s work and a bibliography. Exhibition catalogues are listed below by triennial year with a list of included artists and if applicable mention of any extra materials.\n\nBarilleaux, René Paul.
