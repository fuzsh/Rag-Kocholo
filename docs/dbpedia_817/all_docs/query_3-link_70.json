Acute CNS infections that warrant neurointensive care (ICU) admission fall broadly into three categories—meningitis, encephalitis, and abscesses—and generally result from blood-borne spread of the respective microorganisms. Other causes of CNS infections include head trauma resulting in fractures at the base of the skull or the cribriform plate that can lead to an opening between the CNS and the sinuses, mastoid, the middle ear, or the nasopharynx. Extrinsic contamination of the CNS can occur intraoperatively during neurosurgical procedures. Also, implanted medical devices or adjunct hardware (e.g., shunts, ventriculostomies, or external drainage tubes) and congenital malformations (e.g., spina bifida or sinus tracts) can become colonized and serve as sources or foci of infection. Viruses, such as rabies, herpes simplex virus, or polioviruses, can spread to the CNS via intraneural pathways resulting in encephalitis. If infection occurs at sites (e.g., middle ear or mastoid) contiguous with the CNS, infection may spread directly into the CNS causing brain abscesses; alternatively, the organism may reach the CNS indirectly via venous drainage or the sheaths of cranial and spinal nerves. Abscesses also may become localized in the subdural or epidural spaces. Meningitis results if bacteria spread directly from an abscess to the subarachnoid space. CNS abscesses may be a result of pyogenic meningitis or from septic emboli associated with endocarditis, lung abscess, or other serious purulent infections. Breaches of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) can result in CNS infections. Causes of such breaches include damage (e.g., microhemorrhage or necrosis of surrounding tissue) to the BBB; mechanical obstruction of microvessels by parasitized red blood cells, leukocytes, or platelets; overproduction of cytokines that degrade tight junction proteins; or microbe-specific interactions with the BBB that facilitate transcellular passage of the microorganism. The microorganisms that cause CNS infections include a wide range of bacteria, mycobacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses, spirochaetes (e.g., neurosyphilis), and parasites (e.g., cerebral malaria and strongyloidiasis). The clinical picture of the various infections can be nonspecific or characterized by distinct, recognizable clinical syndromes. At some juncture, individuals with severe acute CNS infections require critical care management that warrants neuro-ICU admission. The implications for CNS infections are serious and complex and include the increased human and material resources necessary to manage very sick patients, the difficulties in triaging patients with vague or mild symptoms, and ascertaining the precise cause and degree of CNS involvement at the time of admission to the neuro-ICU. This chapter addresses a wide range of severe CNS infections that are better managed in the neuro-ICU. Topics covered include the medical epidemiology of the respective CNS infection; discussions of the relevant neuroanatomy and blood supply (essential for understanding the pathogenesis of CNS infections) and pathophysiology; symptoms and signs; diagnostic procedures, including essential neuroimaging studies; therapeutic options, including empirical therapy where indicated; and the perennial issue of the utility and effectiveness of steroid therapy for certain CNS infections. Finally, therapeutic options and alternatives are discussed, including the choices of antimicrobial agents best able to cross the BBB, supportive therapy, and prognosis.\n\nKeywords: Acute bacterial meningitis, Amoebic meningoencephalitis, Aseptic meningitis, Aspergillus infections of the CNS, Bartonella (cat-scratch disease) CNS infection, Blastomycosis of the CNS, Brain abscess, Candida CNS infections, Cat-scratch fever, Cerebral malaria, Cerebritis, CNS complications of strongyloidiasis, CNS infections caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria, CNS complications of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, CNS mucormycosis, CNS mycoses, CNS zygomycosis, Coccidioidal meningitis, Cryptococcus meningitis, Cytomegalovirus encephalitis, Dengue, Echinococcus involvement of the CNS, External ventricular drainage infections, Fungal CNS infections, Fungal meningitis, Histoplasma CNS infections, HIV encephalopathy, Ehrlichiosis of the CNS, Lyme disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections of the CNS, Neurocysticercosis, Neurosyphilis, Parasitic infections of the CNS, Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Pyogenic bacterial abscesses of the CNS, Rhinocerebral mucormycosis, Rickettsial diseases of the CNS, Spinal epidural abscess, Spinal tuberculosis, Steroids use in CNS infections, Therapy of CNS infections, Vertebral osteomyelitis, Viral meningitis, Whipple’s disease of the CNS\n\nIntroduction\n\nAcute infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are medical emergencies that if not addressed promptly result in significant mortality or long-term sequelae that have catastrophic implications for the quality of life of affected individuals. To fully understand the pathogenesis, clinical implications, and management of CNS infections, some knowledge of applied neuroanatomy is essential.\n\nThe CNS is defined by the brain (cerebrum and cerebellum), spinal cord, optic nerves, and their covering membranes. These structures are protected within the rigid confines of the skull and spinal canal of the vertebral column. The cerebral cortex (the outermost, gray tissue layer of the cerebrum) and the spinal cord are covered by three layers of continuous protective tissue called the meninges. The innermost meningeal layer that directly overlies the cerebral cortex is called the pia mater. The middle and outermost layers are known as the arachnoid and dura mater, respectively. The dura mater forms several intracranial compartments, including sinuses for venous drainage. Parts of the arachnoid—the arachnoid villi—project into these sinuses. The subpial space is continuous with the Virchow-Robin spaces. These two spaces transmit penetrating vessels to and from the brain parenchyma and do not connect with the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space lies between the pia mater and the arachnoid and is continuous in nature; the subdural space lies between the arachnoid and the dura mater. The epidural space lies between the dura and the skull. Certain infections can access the subpial and Virchow-Robin spaces, while most do not. Infections within the epidural spaces are usually caused by direct extension from adjacent infections and the infection remains in close proximity to the inciting source. Subdural infections are often associated with an extracerebral source, but these infections can spread widely within the subdural compartment well away from the inciting source. It is not uncommon to develop serous subdural effusions in bacterial meningitis. Subarachnoid infections are most often caused by hematogenous dissemination of organisms or viruses.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is continuously produced by the choroid plexuses within the four ventricles of the brain. CSF fills the lateral and third ventricles and circulates to the fourth ventricle, which lies between the cerebellum and the midbrain. CSF flows from the fourth ventricle into the subarachnoid space, where it bathes the entire CNS, and drains via the arachnoid villi into the superior sagittal sinus in the dura mater, where it is resorbed into the bloodstream.\n\nA working knowledge of the blood supply is also essential for understanding the pathogenesis of CNS infections. The capillary supply to the brain and spinal cord is unique—the outermost layers of endothelial cells are fused together. These specialized brain microvascular endothelial cells constitute the blood–brain barrier, which separates the brain and the meninges from the circulating blood and impedes the influx of microorganisms, toxic agents, and most other compounds, while regulating the flow of essential nutrients and molecules for normal neural function. Thus, pathogens that breach the blood–brain barrier can cause CNS infections. Causes of such breaches include damage (e.g., microhemorrhage or necrosis of surrounding tissue) to the barrier; mechanical obstruction of microvessels by parasitized red blood cells, leukocytes, or platelets; overproduction of cytokines that degrade tight junction proteins; or microbe-specific interactions with the blood–brain barrier that facilitate transcellular passage of the microorganism (e.g., Escherichia coli, mycobacteria, and spirochaetes). The therapeutic implications are obvious—to be effective, antimicrobials prescribed for CNS infections must be able to cross the blood–brain barrier.\n\nRoutes of Infection\n\nAcute CNS infections fall broadly into three categories—meningitis, encephalitis, and abscesses—and generally result from blood-borne spread of the respective microorganisms. Bacteremia or viremia can result from infection at sites adjacent or contiguous to the CNS, such as the mastoid, sinuses, or middle ear, or from primary infections at more remote anatomic sites (e.g., lungs, heart, skin, gastrointestinal tract, or kidney). In children the most common predisposing conditions are sinus or middle ear infection, which lead to transient bacteremia and hematogenous seeding of the CNS [1–3]. Bacterial infections of the paranasal and otomastoid sinuses often produce phlebothrombosis of adjacent draining cortical (cerebral) veins. This thrombotic process can extend into regional dural sinuses. The phlebothrombosis becomes thrombophlebitis offering a direct route of transmission from the infected sinus to the adjacent extra axial spaces or to the brain along cortical venous drainage pathways. Recognition of the venous involvement is essential, since the venous obstruction can produce intra axial brain swelling which may obscure the extra axial infection source contributing to misleading interpretations on brain and spinal imaging studies. The common relationship between paranasal sinus and otomastoid causes of intracranial infection reinforces the need for the clinician and radiologic imager to be well versed in both head and neck and paraspinous anatomy.\n\nIn patients with bacteremia or viremia, the organism, upon entering the venous sinuses, may cross the blood–brain barrier, penetrate the dura and arachnoid, and gain access to the subarachnoid space, thereby causing infection of the CSF and further dissemination of the infection throughout this anatomic space. Fractures at the base of the skull or the cribriform plate can lead to an opening between the CNS and the sinuses, mastoid, the middle ear, or the nasopharynx. Since these sites are all contiguous with the upper respiratory tract, CSF leaks occurring at any of these sites may enable respiratory flora to track back up into the subarachnoid space. Extrinsic contamination of the CNS can occur intraoperatively during neurosurgical procedures and, further, implanted medical devices or adjunct hardware (e.g., shunts, ventriculostomies, or external drainage tubes) can become colonized and serve as foci of infection. Congenital malformations, such as spina bifida or sinus tracts, can become colonized and serve as sources of infection. Viruses, such as rabies, herpes simplex virus (HSV), or polioviruses, can spread to the CNS via intraneural pathways resulting in encephalitis.\n\nIf infection occurs at sites (e.g., middle ear or mastoid) contiguous with the CNS, infection may spread directly into the CNS causing brain abscesses; alternatively, the organism may reach the CNS indirectly via venous drainage or the sheaths of cranial and spinal nerves. Abscesses also may become localized in the subdural or epidural spaces. Meningitis results if bacteria spread directly from an abscess to the subarachnoid space. CNS abscesses may be a result of pyogenic meningitis or from septic emboli associated with endocarditis, lung abscess, or other serious purulent infections, such as those caused by the Streptococcus milleri group.\n\nAcute Bacterial Meningitis\n\nBacterial meningitis, a serious brain infection, can develop rapidly into a life-threatening infection even in previously healthy children or adults. Bacteria that cause meningitis enter the bloodstream, are carried toward the brain, and somehow manage to cross the defensive line of the blood–brain barrier outlined previously.\n\nDefinition\n\nBacterial meningitis can be defined as an inflammatory response to pyogenic bacterial invasion of the pia mater, the arachnoid membranes, and surrounding the CNS. This infection typically involves the entire length of the neuraxis including the brain (cerebrum, cerebellum), spinal cord, optic nerves, and their covering membranes because of the continuous nature of the subarachnoid space. Pyogenic meningitis is associated with a marked, acute inflammatory exudate; non-pyogenic microorganisms (e.g., mycobacteria or spirochetes like Leptospira spp.) are less commonly implicated. Clinically, onset is acute with development of headache, fever, irritability, and stiff neck with or without focal neurological signs over hours to a few days. Although the overall annual incidence of pyogenic bacterial meningitis in the United States is decreasing, the outcome is invariably fatal if left untreated [1, 4].\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe common causes of bacterial meningitis in the United States include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, group B Streptococcus spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae. Collectively, these agents account for over 95 % of cases (Table ). The age distribution, predisposing conditions, and fatality rates for the most common agents are summarized in Fig. and Table .\n\nTable 22.1\n\nOrganism% of total casesIncidencePredisposing conditionsCase fatality rate (%) Streptococcus pneumoniae 471.1Otitis media; sinusitis; alcoholism; cirrhosis; pneumococcal pneumonia; immunosuppression; skull fracture; CSF leak; myeloma; sickle cell disease21 Neisseria meningitidis 250.6“Closed” institutional setting; lack of specific antibody; complement deficiencies3Group B Streptococcus120.3Neonatal period; colonized mothers; preterm labor; prolonged rupture of membranes; intrapartum fever7 Listeria monocytogenes 80.2Neonatal period; immunosuppression; age; alcoholism/cirrhosis15 Haemophilus influenzae 70.2Lack of antibody to polysaccharide capsule; preceding otitis media6\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n\nOf the three predominant organisms (S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae) most often implicated in community-associated meningitis in the United States, S. pneumoniae is the most common and affects all age groups, except infants in the immediate neonatal period. The risk of pneumococcal meningitis varies with age but is significantly higher in infants than in young children and adults. Over the age of 70 years, the incidence rises again to approximately double the average incidence for young and middle-aged adults. In adults the major predisposing factors for infection include alcoholism, splenectomy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, other acquired immunodeficiency conditions, diabetes, other underlying chronic conditions (e.g., chronic renal disease), and prior viral respiratory infection. Pneumococcal meningitis is the most common form of recurrent meningitis in patients who have CSF leaks. S. pneumoniae is spread by respiratory transmission in the general population and results in colonization of the nasopharynx with rates commonly in the range of 5–10 % of healthy adults. During the wintertime, carriage rates can rise to 20–30 % in certain populations depending on age and other factors. Overcrowding in day-care centers, military barracks, and prisons is often implicated in the transmission.\n\nN. meningitidis\n\nThis is an aerobic, gram-negative diplococcus that colonizes the mucosal surface of the nasopharynx. The main mode of transmission is via direct contact with large droplet respiratory secretions from patients or asymptomatic carriers; humans are the only host. Invasive disease caused by this organism occurs in three clinical forms: meningitis (50 % of cases), blood infection (30 %), and pneumonia (10 %); other forms account for the remainder (10 %) of the cases. N. meningitidis has now become the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in the United States with an estimated annual incidence of approximately 0.5–1.5 cases per 100,000 population and at least tenfold higher in less-developed countries [1]. Persons at risk include household contacts of infected patients, military recruits, college freshmen who live in dormitories, microbiologists who work with isolates of N. meningitidis, persons traveling to a country where meningococcal disease is epidemic or highly endemic, and patients without spleens or with terminal complement component deficiencies. Infants less than 1 year of age and adolescents ages 16–21 years have higher rates of disease than other age groups, although infection can occur in all age groups including the elderly.\n\nStrains of N. meningitidis are characterized according to the serologic recognition of polysaccharide epitopes on their capsule and outer membrane and are classified into serogroups A, B, C, W135, and Y. In the United States, strains from serogroups B, C, and Y cause the majority (45 %) of infections, whereas in less-developed countries serogroups A and C predominate; serogroup A has also been implicated in epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nH. influenzae\n\nThis is a small, pleomorphic, aerobic or facultative anaerobic gram-negative coccobacilli that is classified according to six serologically distinct antigenic types based on capsular polysaccharides a–f. Of these, only H. influenzae type b (Hib) is pathogenic. Although the nonencapsulated form of H. influenzae is a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract of healthy humans and causes localized infection (e.g., conjunctivitis or otitis media in children) without bacteremia, the more virulent encapsulated Hib serotype causes more invasive disease and is an important cause of meningitis or epiglottitis. Hib meningitis is relatively uncommon during the first 2 months of life probably because of the presence of passively transferred maternal antibodies. But by the fourth month of life, children lose these antibodies and become at risk of Hib meningitis. The occurrence of H. influenzae meningitis is directly associated with the presence and development of type-specific anticapsular antibodies to polyribosylribitol phosphate. Whether vaccine-induced or occurring naturally, presence of these antibodies is directly related to protection from invasive H. influenzae infection [5]. Various clinical studies have shown these antibodies to be opsonic and bactericidal against H. influenzae in vitro and protective in vivo. In the pre-vaccine era, colonization with nontypable strains of H. influenzae led to the development of cross-reacting antibodies that were largely protective against infection caused by type b strains. Before the introduction of the Hib conjugate polysaccharide capsular vaccine in 1986, H. influenzae was the most common cause of acute bacterial meningitis in children under the age of 5, with as many as 1 in 200 children acquiring invasive H. influenzae infection, including epiglottitis, septicemia, arthritis, and soft tissue infections in addition to meningitis. However, by 1995, the prevalence of meningitis caused by Hib had fallen 55 % [6]. Risk factors for Hib meningitis include malignancy, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, immunoglobulin dyscrasias, HIV infections, and cystic fibrosis.\n\nListeria monocytogenes\n\nThis is a facultative anaerobic, intracellular gram-positive bacillus that remains a significant cause of neonatal meningitis in the USA. Although the mode of transmission to humans is generally fecal-oral, transmission of the pathogen to the neonate generally occurs at the time of birth in mothers who had asymptomatic colonization of the genital or gastrointestinal tract prior to delivery. Domestic and wild animals are the main reservoirs for L. monocytogenes, but as the prevalence of stool carriage of this organism among asymptomatic adults is about 1 %, humans remain a small but still significant reservoir.\n\nGenerally, healthy adults exposed to the organism do not become ill, unless exposed to high numbers of infectious organisms, such as during an outbreak. L. monocytogenes causes meningitis most often in adults with depressed cell-mediated immunity, patients on steroids or other immunosuppressive agents, HIV-infected individuals, transplant recipients, and other vulnerable populations, such as persons with diabetes, alcohol abuse, chronic liver disease, renal disease requiring hemodialysis, or persons greater than 60 years of age. Outbreaks of L. monocytogenes meningitis in the United States and elsewhere have been associated with unpasteurized milk products, such as Swiss or feta cheese, undercooked chicken or hot dogs, seafood, vegetables, or coleslaw.\n\nOther Microorganisms\n\nGram-negative microorganisms are important causes of acute bacterial meningitis. Persons with diabetes, a history of alcohol abuse, hepatic cirrhosis, or chronic urinary tract infections are particularly susceptible. E. coli with the K1 capsular polysaccharide antigen accounts for a majority of the cases of gram-negative meningitis in the newborn [7]. Carriage rates of the E. coli K1 serotypes vary in different populations but range from 7 to 38 % in women of childbearing age and may be as high as 50 % in nursing personnel [8–10]. In a study of 231 children presenting with bacterial meningitis to the emergency department during the era of widespread heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccination, E. coli was implicated in 4 % and other gram-negative bacilli in 3.0 % [11, 12]. Other gram-negative organisms such as Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Citrobacter spp., and Salmonella spp. may also cause meningitis in the neonatal period, with an epidemiology similar to that of the E. coli K1 strains. Gram-negative bacillary meningitis still carries a worse prognosis than meningitis with a gram-positive organism [13]. Beyond the neonatal period, the vast majority of cases of gram-negative meningitis occur in the inpatient setting, especially following neurosurgery (e.g., craniotomy) and during placement of devices, such as ventriculostomy tubes, spinal surgery, or in patients who have suffered head trauma [14].\n\nGroup B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae) is the single most frequent cause of neonatal meningitis. This organism has been cultured from vaginal secretions in 30–40 % of women prior to delivery. During pregnancy, labor, and delivery, the microorganism can be transmitted to amniotic fluid or the newborn may become colonized as it passes through the birth canal. Transmission to the infant during delivery can result in neonatal meningitis within the first week of life. Alternatively, the organism may be acquired within the first few days after birth from adult contacts—relatives or hospital personnel—and meningitis may develop during the first 1–2 months after birth even though the infant might have appeared healthy at the time of delivery. While the probability of transmission from mothers colonized with S. agalactiae to neonates delivered vaginally is approximately 50 %, only 2 % of colonized neonates go on to develop invasive group B streptococcal disease. Group B streptococci produce polysaccharide capsules that manifest nine antigenic serotypes (types Ia–VIII). The type III group is responsible for the vast majority of neonatal meningitis; virulence factors (e.g., those causing production of higher levels of neuraminidase) have been described as an explanation for this.\n\nAlmost any microorganism that crosses the blood–brain barrier can cause acute meningitis. Other bacterial agents include group A streptococci, non-pneumococcal alpha hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria gonorrhea, Salmonella species, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, non-influenzae Haemophilus species, and even Bacillus anthracis (anthrax). Although S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are rarely implicated as causes of primary bacterial meningitis, these organisms are relatively common causes of bacterial meningitis following trauma, in situ CSF shunts, or neurosurgical procedures. Other microorganisms, such as Mycobacterium spp., Nocardia spp., yeasts and fungi (e.g., Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, or Cryptococcus neoformans), Treponema spp., Brucella spp., Leptospira spp., or Toxoplasma gondii, can also produce meningitis. However, with the exception of Leptospira spp., these microorganisms tend to produce a more chronic form of meningitis and would not be considered agents of acute bacterial meningitis in the first instance [15]. For example, Mycobacterium spp., C. immitis, H. capsulatum, or C. neoformans would more likely produce chronic granulomatous inflammatory changes rather than acute pyogenic infections.\n\nPathogenesis of Meningeal Invasion\n\nColonization of the respiratory tract or nasopharynx is the critical first step preceding infection caused by the three microorganisms (S. pneumoniae, N. meningitides, and H. influenzae) most commonly associated with community-acquired meningitis. Biologically, colonization is mediated by affinity of these organisms for the nasopharyngeal mucosa. Colonization is facilitated by attachment and adherence of the microorganisms to cell surface receptors on nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, enabling them to replicate in the upper airway for prolonged periods. All three pathogens, typically, may colonize the upper airway without producing symptoms. Both host susceptibility and pathogen-specific factors (e.g., virulence and pathogenicity) are critical in the development of invasive disease. Many of these factors, though identified and characterized, are still not fully understood. For example, splenectomy definitely predisposes the affected person to invasive disease by S. pneumoniae, while it appears to have relatively little effect on the occurrence of invasive N. meningitidis disease, despite the fact that both are encapsulated organisms.\n\nAdherence to nasopharyngeal mucosa is mediated by fimbriae or pili, in the case of gram-negative organisms. The pili of N. meningitidis are filamentous glycoproteins attached to the bacterial surface, traverse the polysaccharide capsule, and extend beyond the surface of the bacterium, where they can bind to specific receptors on nasopharyngeal cells, in this instance the CD4+ receptor [16, 17]. After receptor binding, further interaction with the host cell is established by certain outer membrane proteins on N. meningitidis, designated Opa and Opc [18]. Binding of the outer membrane proteins to specific receptors promotes engulfment of the N. meningitidis by the epithelial cells followed by transportation of the bacteria across the cell in membrane-bound vacuoles to the intravascular space; organisms also gain access to the intravascular space by creating separations in the tight junctions of columnar epithelial cells. N. meningitidis also possess other outer membrane proteins that function as IgA proteases, which can specifically degrade the surface IgA antibodies on epithelial cells, further enhancing the probability of invasive disease [19]. Once the mucosal barrier has been breached, the development of meningococcal disease is dependent upon the survival of the organism in the bloodstream.\n\nHere, the most important virulence factor for survival of meningococci is the polysaccharide capsule that protects the organism against complement-mediated phagocytosis by neutrophils in the reticular endothelial system [20, 21]. Host defense is clearly determined by the existing humoral antibody to specific polysaccharide capsular types and the cellular responses of the innate immune system.\n\nProtective IgG antibody for meningococcal disease is acquired through maternal transmission and is protective for the first few months after birth. Colonization by nonpathogenic Neisseria species and a possibly cross-reacting gram-negative organism such as E. coli K1 induces protective antibodies. Antibodies protect by promoting optimization of phagocytosis through opsonization and specific lysis via complement activation. For this reason, patients who are deficient in complement factor C5 are particularly susceptible to repeated invasive infections by N. meningitidis. In fact, individuals with an inherited deficiency of any of the terminal components of complement C5, C6, C7, and C8 have a greater risk of invasive disease [22].\n\nVirulence factors for the invasion of S. pneumoniae seem to be primarily a function of the capsular polysaccharide type. There are at least 93 known capsular serotypes of S. pneumoniae with the various serotypes having different propensities for producing disease or developing antibiotic resistance [23, 24].\n\nColonization of the upper airway by H. influenzae is also mediated by fimbrial attachment to epithelial cells. Alpha fimbriae enhance the binding to the anterior nasopharynx and β fimbriae facilitate binding to the posterior ciliated nasopharyngeal cells [25]. Although H. influenzae type b strains that lack fimbriae generally are unable to colonize the nasopharynx, isolates from CSF do not express fimbria, suggesting that while the presence of fimbriae on H. influenzae is important for colonization of and attachment to nasopharyngeal mucosa, it does not appear play a significant role in the pathogenesis of meningitis [26, 27].\n\nN. meningitis, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae type b and other pathogens are capable of invading the CNS and infecting the meninges due to the incorporation of virulence factors [28]. The chain of events that ultimately lead to invasion of the subarachnoid space by these pathogens includes a cascade of events involving nasopharyngeal or middle ear colonization, bloodstream dissemination of the respective pathogen, crossing of the blood–brain and blood-CSF barriers, and finally entrance and survival of the implicated pathogen into the subarachnoid space and subsequent infection [28]. Bacteria migrate through the brain microvascular endothelial cells in enclosed vacuoles via a mechanism that is dependent on F-actin. Thus, transport through the cell appears to be dependent on cytoskeletal rearrangement involving both microfilaments and microtubules. Because of the blood–brain barrier, immunoglobulin and complement protein levels and leukocytes are significantly lower in CSF than in serum and interstitial fluid. Thus, in the early phase of infection involving the subarachnoid space, bacterial replication proceeds virtually unchecked by host defense mechanisms. Although the major host response to the invasion of the subarachnoid space by pathogenic microorganisms is a rapid influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, opsonization of bacteria and subsequent phagocytosis by neutrophils are hindered by the relative paucity of complement and immunoglobulins and the intrinsic fluid nature of CSF which is less facilitating to phagocytosis as compared to solid tissues. In addition, leukocyte proteases derived from the initial influx of leukocytes degrade whatever complement components are present in the CSF [29–31].\n\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules from gram-negative bacteria are known to be extremely potent in the development of inflammation, and intracisternal injection of purified LPS from H. influenzae also elicits a strong inflammatory response [31, 32]. The mechanism by which LPS and other bacterial cell wall components (e.g., teichoic acid and peptidoglycans from S. pneumoniae) act to stimulate inflammation is probably through the induction of inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin 1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [29, 32]. In vitro studies with LPS and with IL-1 and TNF show that incubation with endothelial cell monolayers leads to a rapid, transient increase in the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and ICAM-2) as well as the selectin molecules such as ELAM-1. As a result, neutrophils are able to bind to CNS vascular endothelial cells at vastly increased rates and then subsequently migrate by diapedesis into the subarachnoid space. At the same time, adherence of neutrophils to the capillary endothelium increases the permeability of the blood vessels enabling more protein leakage into the CSF and subarachnoid space, adding to the inflammatory exudate. Figure shows the dense inflammatory infiltrate with neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages seen in a patient with purulent meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae. IL-1 and TNF, in turn, stimulate leukocytes and other categories of inflammatory cells to produce and secrete a host of other proinflammatory cytokines, proteolytic enzymes, free radicals, and nitric oxide. The end result is edema of the surrounding tissues, cell injury, and tissue necrosis. Infiltration of the walls of small arteries and cortical veins also leads to a vasculitis with intimal thickening, narrowing and occlusion of small arteries, thrombophlebitis of the cortical veins, and thrombosis of the major venous sinuses, leading to ischemia and infarction of brain tissues.\n\nInflammation of the pia mater and arachnoid affects glucose transport into the CSF resulting in a net lowering of CSF glucose levels. The pathophysiologic consequences of this intense neutrophil response in the subarachnoid space, tissue edema, and vasculitis account for most, if not all, of the serious clinical and pathologic consequences of meningitis, such as the increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), hydrocephalus, and reduced cerebral blood flow, leading to cerebral hypoxia and death [32].\n\nThe ICP is raised via several mechanisms. First, vasogenic cerebral edema is caused by the increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier, which is a direct result of inflammatory bacterial products or the inflammatory cytokines released in response to these products. Second, the alterations in brain cellular membranes lead to cytotoxic cerebral edema resulting from increased intracellular water content, potassium leakage, and a shift in brain metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis with increased lactate production. And third, as a result of the inflammation in the subarachnoid space, there is decreased ability to reabsorb CSF, which leads to interstitial edema in brain parenchyma. All three mechanisms contribute to increased ICP pressure, which in turn may precipitate transtentorial brain herniation.\n\nClinical Manifestations\n\nIn the typical clinical presentation of meningitis in adults, fever, headache, and stiff neck predominate although there might be varying degrees of altered consciousness. Though vomiting is a common symptom generally attributed to raised ICP, it is also a well-recognized manifestation of the effects of the inflammatory process on the midbrain. The nature of the presentation of meningitis depends on the underlying microorganism responsible for the infection. For example, in pneumococcal meningitis (S. pneumoniae is the most common etiologic agent implicated in adult bacterial meningitis cases), the patient might have had pneumonia and bloodstream dissemination before progression to meningitis. Thus, the patient might have presented with chills and rigors or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, or pneumonia several days before the actual onset of meningitis symptoms. In the classic series by Carpenter and Petersdorf, approximately 27 % of patients had a sudden onset of headache, confusion, lethargy, and alteration of consciousness within the first 24 h before admission to hospital [33]. In contrast, 53 % presented with a more slowly progressive course over 1–7 days.\n\nIn a review of 493 episodes of meningitis, Durand and colleagues found that 95 % of the patients with acquired meningitis had a temperature greater than 37.7 °C on admission, while neck stiffness was present in 88 %. Only 22 % were alert, 51 % were confused or lethargic, and 22 % were responsive only to pain. Within the first 24–48 h of onset, 29 % had suffered focal seizures or had exhibited focal neurologic signs [34]. The most common predisposing factors for acute meningitis included pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis media, alcoholism, diabetes, or immunosuppression associated with conditions, such as malignancy, connective tissue diseases, sickle cell disease, diabetes, organ transplantation, splenectomy, dialysis, or steroids and other immunosuppressive therapy. For patients with some of these underlying conditions, the clinical presentation of meningitis may not be classic because of alteration of the immune response, with the diagnosis only being made upon further investigation of altered sensorium, persistent headache, or new onset seizures or neurological symptoms or signs. The presentation of patients with meningococcal meningitis may be similar to those with pneumococcal meningitis; clinically, one might not be able to distinguish between the two. However, meningococcal meningitis is part of the spectrum of N. meningitidis sepsis and the manifestations of meningococcal septicemia may precede the meningitis by 12–24 h. Signs indicative of underlying sepsis may dominate the clinical presentation. The initial presentation in meningococcemia may be completely nonspecific, with the patient simply complaining of feeling unwell but without overt symptoms or signs of meningitis. The clinical condition of these patients may progress to irreversible shock and death before the development or obvious manifestation of meningitis.\n\nEarly in meningococcemia, the patient may exhibit a subtle petechial rash (Fig. ) that precedes progression to fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and development of a more severe, prodigious purpuric rash leading to necrosis of the fingers and toes (Fig. ). Purpura fulminans in the patient with meningococcemia is classically associated with hemorrhagic necrosis of the adrenal gland—the Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome. Thus, the clinical manifestation of meningococcal meningitis depends on the relative degree of meningococcemia and shock, as well as the severity of meningitis.\n\nIt is important to recognize that the presentation of meningitis in the elderly and the very young may be subtler or more insidious compared with young adults and children. For example, in a review of 54 cases, Gorse and coworkers found that confusion was a predominating symptom in presentation among the elderly compared with the younger age group, and pneumonia was also more likely to be present in the older age group [35]. Typical symptoms and signs are also less commonly reported in the elderly since these patients often have cervical rigidity due to osteoarthritis, cervical spondylosis, or existing cerebrovascular disease. In addition, there may be hypertonicity of the neck muscles in conditions like Parkinson’s disease. Among the elderly, the meningitis itself may progress more rapidly, and patients are more likely to present in coma when compared with younger patient populations. With the development of coma, nuchal rigidity may be markedly less pronounced. Thus, when meningitis is suspected in the elderly, true nuchal rigidity has to be distinguished by careful physical examination. The absence of fever does not rule out the diagnosis of meningitis in the elderly patient.\n\nIn children, the presentation of meningitis is fundamentally similar to that in young and middle-aged adults, although nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, nausea and vomiting, respiratory symptoms, and photophobia are more common in children. In neonates and infants, meningitis may present simply as fever or irritability; generally, there is a tendency for fever to be higher in children as compared to that in adults. The classic physical signs of meningeal inflammation or irritation described in medical textbooks are the Brudzinski’s and Kernig’s signs [36, 37]. Although Brudzinski originally described several signs of inflammation of the meninges, the best known of these is the so-called “nape of the neck” sign—the classic Brudzinski’s sign. This sign is elicited by flexing the neck forward. The stretching of the meninges induced by this movement results in involuntary flexion of the hips and knees. Kernig’s sign is elicited with the patient in the supine position and the thigh flexed on the abdomen with the knee flexed at a 45° angle. Upon passive extension of the leg in the presence of meningeal irritation, the patient resists extension with complaints of lower back and hamstring pain. Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs are neither sensitive nor specific indicators of meningitis and are potentially elicited in only about 50 % of children and only 5 % of adults with acute bacterial meningitis.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nAn acute CNS infection is a medical emergency and bacterial meningitis may have to be differentiated from aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess, subdural empyema, or noninfectious conditions affecting the CNS. Differentiation from encephalitis can be difficult and initially is made on clinical grounds. The classic features of meningitis (headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, and vomiting) are often absent in neonates, patients who are immunocompromised—including persons with HIV infection—alcoholics, or the elderly. In encephalitis, altered state of consciousness, confusion, convulsions, and obtundation predominate. As the level of consciousness declines in patients with meningitis or encephalitis, differentiation between the two may only be possible through laboratory and radiographic findings. Because acute bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency, therapy should be implemented on clinical grounds without waiting for proof by laboratory or radiographic studies.\n\nFever and altered mental status with or without meningismus may occur in a variety of systemic infections as well as noninfectious conditions. For example, Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) can present with fever, shock, and a petechial rash (Fig. ), which must be differentiated from the rash associated with early meningococcemia (Fig. ). Meningococcal disease may initially present simply as meningococcemia with shock and skin rash with minimal or absent meningeal signs. Other infections that present with headache and fever include brain abscess, influenza, leptospirosis, dengue, typhoid, parameningeal infections, or Q fever. Noninfectious, organic conditions, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, autoimmune disorders (e.g., temporal arteritis), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, status epilepticus, or toxic encephalopathies of various causes, can present precipitously with severe headache and fever, or nuchal rigidity.\n\nLumbar Puncture and CSF Analysis\n\nA lumbar puncture and analysis of the CSF facilitate the diagnosis of meningitis and other conditions affecting the CNS. However, the decision to perform a lumbar puncture on a patient with meningitis at presentation is precluded by the presence of raised ICP, which increases the risk of uncal, midbrain, medullary, or cerebellar tonsillar herniation after the procedure, leading to irreversible brain injury or death. Cerebral herniation occurs in about 5 % of patients with acute bacterial meningitis, accounting for about 30 % of the mortality [38]. Of note, the role of a CT scan is primarily to ascertain whether a space-occupying lesion is present; a CT scan cannot rule out the presence of increased ICP. Clinical signs suggestive of impending herniation include deteriorating level of consciousness, brainstem signs (including pupillary changes, decorticate posturing, or irregular respirations), a very recent seizure, absent oculocephalic reflexes, or papilledema. Lumbar puncture should be delayed in such patients, even for those with a normal CT scan, until preventive measures can be implemented to decrease ICP [38–42]. Other contraindications to immediate lumbar puncture include septic or hemodynamic shock, cardiorespiratory failure, presence of predisposing conditions for parameningeal abscesses (e.g., sinusitis, chronic ear discharge, or suppurative lung disease), bleeding disorders, and infection or loss of skin (e.g., burns) over the lumbar spine.\n\nIf the clinical picture is suggestive of bacterial meningitis or other intracranial infection and the patient is critically ill, especially if there is a rash or altered mental status, blood cultures should be drawn immediately and intravenous antimicrobial therapy initiated without delay. If the patient is not critically ill, one is certainly justified in withholding antimicrobial therapy until radiographic studies and lumbar puncture can be performed. If raised ICP is suspected and no focal lesions are defined by radiographic studies, one might consider intravenous infusion of mannitol (1 g/kg body weight) to reduce cerebral edema followed by a lumbar puncture after an interval of about 20 min. In addition to mannitol infusion, elective intubation and mechanical ventilation of the patient may be considered prior to the lumbar puncture procedure. Under these conditions, and using a 22-gauge needle, lumbar puncture can be performed without a significantly increased risk of herniation.\n\nAfter insertion of the needle, the opening CSF pressure should be measured with the patient in the supine position. Normal opening pressure ranges from 1 to 10 cm H2O in young children, 6–20 cm H2O after 8 years of age, and up to 25 cm H2O in obese patients [43]. The level should fluctuate with respiration and can be elevated by the Valsalva maneuver. If the CSF pressure is measured again at the end of the procedure after appropriate volumes of CSF have been obtained and has dropped to zero, the possibility of a complete CSF block should be considered. CSF is normally crystal clear and colorless, not unlike a fine gin. A minimum of 200 white blood cells or 400 red blood cells/mm3 is necessary to impart turbidity to the fluid. CSF will appear reddish if more than 6,000 red blood cells/mm3 are present [43].\n\nXanthochromia is a yellow, orange, or pink discoloration of the CSF and is caused by the lysis of red blood cells resulting in hemoglobin breakdown to oxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and bilirubin. Discoloration begins after RBCs have been in spinal fluid for about 2 h. In cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage, xanthochromia occurs within 2–4 h after the initial cerebral bleed; xanthochromia may develop in vitro if the CSF specimen contains increased numbers of red blood cells and is not centrifuged immediately upon arrival in the laboratory. Xanthochromia also occurs when CSF protein concentrations are greater than 150 mg/dL. The macroscopic appearance of CSF only enables a diagnostic path for purulent versus aseptic meningitis; however, appearance alone is not sufficient to make a specific diagnosis of bacterial or viral meningitis.\n\nIn adults and children older than the neonatal age group, normal CSF generally contains less than 5 white cells/mm3, usually small lymphocytes. In neonates, CSF may contain up to 25–30 white cells/mm3 with up to 60 % neutrophils; this falls after a few days to the range of 8–9 white cells/mm3 [8]. Because red cells may be present in spinal fluid as a result of subarachnoid hemorrhage or through a traumatic tap, it is important to note whether red tinged or bloody CSF clears as sequential specimen tubes of CSF are obtained. Such clearing suggests a traumatic tap and can be documented in the laboratory by counting the red cells in successive tubes. CSF cells should be counted in the laboratory within 1–2 h of collection; further delays may result in a false low cell count because of cell lysis or adherence of cells to the walls of the specimen tube.\n\nGlucose enters the CSF by transport through the choroid plexus and capillary endothelium in the subarachnoid space. CSF glucose levels are therefore a function of both active transport of glucose into the CNS and its rate of consumption within the CNS. CSF glucose levels in normal subjects are, on average, 60–70 % of the blood glucose levels. However, a study by Skipper and Davis showed the CSF to serum glucose ratio was accurate when the serum glucose was between 89 and 115 mg/dL [44]. For blood glucose levels greater than 125 mg/dL, the ratio was less than 60 %; for blood glucose levels greater than 192 mg/dL, the ratio fell to 50 % even among normal patients with no evidence of meningitis.\n\nCSF protein levels are generally less than 40 mg/dL due to the exclusion of larger proteins by the blood–brain barrier. When the barrier breaks down during meningitis, CSF protein tends to rise and increases with duration of disease prior to initiation of therapy. Protein levels in newborn infants are significantly higher compared to older children and adults, averaging 90 mg/dL with normal levels up to 170 mg/dL. Extremely high levels (more than 1 g/dL) of CSF protein are suggestive of a CSF spinal block. Elevation of CSF protein on its own, however, is not specific for any specific type of meningitis.\n\nTable summarizes the CSF characteristics (macroscopic appearance, white cell count range and differential, protein and glucose levels) typically encountered in meningitis caused by various classes of organisms. In general, high CSF white cell counts are found in bacterial meningitis, where levels may be greater than 10,000 cells/mm3 with 95 % polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Typically, WBC count in bacterial meningitis ranges between 500 and 5,000 cells/mm3, CSF glucose less than 40 mg/dL, and protein levels in the 100–500 mg/dL range. It is important to recognize that a predominance of PMNs may occur early in viral meningitis, within the first 24–48 h, but this gradually shifts to a mononuclear predominance over the next 8 h if the lumbar puncture is repeated [45, 46]. In patients with meningitis caused by L. monocytogenes, the organism grows and survives within the host cell cytoplasm, thereby stimulating a monocytic CSF response; in infants there may be a monocytic predominance.\n\nTable 22.2\n\nType of infectionMacroscopic appearanceCellsProtein (mg/dL)Glucose (mg/dL)Other testsNormalClear<5 lymphocytes/mm3 15–4550–75Negative test resultsBacterial meningitis (S. pneumoniae; N. meningitides; L. monocytogenes)Cloudy or turbid Increased (commonly > 200)>100Reduced (<40)Gram stain, bacterial culture, and antigen tests may be positive Typically >90 % PMNs Can be normal in meningococcemiaViral meningitis (enteroviruses; herpes simplex; arboviral encephalitis)Clear or rarely opalescentIncreasedUsually <100NormalGram stain, bacterial culture, and antigen tests negativeMay have PMN predominance early in the course of infection; converts to lymphocytic predominance within 12–24 hPCR for HSV, VZV, arboviruses, and enteroviruses may be positiveFungal meningitis (cryptococcus; histoplasmosis; coccidioidomycosis)Cloudy or turbid>100 (<50 %)100–900< 40Cryptococcus can be diagnosed from India ink preps, antigen tests, or culture; PCRUsual range 100–400 usually lymphocytic predominanceMay be normal in cryptococcal meningitisTuberculous meningitisCloudy or turbidIncreased100–900<40Acid-fast bacilli occasionally seen on CSF smear stained with Kinyoun or Ziehl-Neelsen stainsTypically >100Usual range 100–400PMN early but converts to lymphocytic predominanceParameningeal infections (sinusitis; epidural abscess; paraspinous abscess)Clear<100 (<50 %)IncreasedNormalOccasionally PMN predominanceIf rupture into CSF, like acute meningitis\n\nOnce CSF specimens are obtained, a gram stain should be performed immediately in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis followed by plating on solid culture media. Centrifugation of CSF improves the yield for both gram stain smears and culture. In general, a CSF concentration greater than 103 organisms/mL is required in order for organisms to be identified on light microscopy of the gram stain. With lower concentrations, there are simply too few organisms to detect by direct microscopy. Approximately 75 % of patients with acute bacterial meningitis will have a positive gram stain, and this percentage may drop to about 50 % among patients who have received significant doses of prior antimicrobial therapy. Generally, the gram stain is positive in 90 % of untreated patients with pneumococcal meningitis, 86 % of patients with meningitis due to H. influenzae, and approximately 75 % of cases due to N. meningitidis [47]. Among children, the overall sensitivity of gram stain to detect bacterial meningitis is 67 %. Moreover, most children without bacterial meningitis have negative gram stain with a negative predictive value of 99.9 %. Thus, CSF gram stain is useful in evaluating children for empiric therapy of bacterial meningitis [48].\n\nIn addition to gram stain, a number of other rapid diagnostic tests have been developed over the past 20 years for diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis. In the 1970s counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) was used for direct detection of bacterial polysaccharide antigens; this test is quite insensitive and is no longer in use. Agglutination tests are commercially available for H. influenza, S. pneumoniae, and five serotypes of N. meningitidis. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are no better than that of the gram stain, and they provide no additional diagnostic yield above and beyond the gram stain and the clinical picture and rarely influence the decision to treat empirically [49, 50]. Therefore, they are not currently recommended in the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis upon initial presentation. The underlying problem with these tests is that they are not sensitive and specific enough to establish a diagnosis upon which to initiate appropriate therapy. For example, if a patient is sick enough to be admitted to the hospital, and found to have a low CSF glucose level and raised CSF white blood count, one would still initiate empiric antimicrobial and supportive therapy even if the agglutination tests are negative.\n\nMiscellaneous Testing\n\nC-reactive protein (CRP) can be measured in CSF and, when greater than 100 μg/mL, may be useful in differentiating bacterial from viral meningitis [51]. Extensive literature exists describing the application of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection and quantification of various bacterial and viral pathogens in CSF of patients with a putative diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Real-time PCR is faster and more sensitive than previous technologies. However, this technique is expensive and not readily available in most hospital laboratories. Moreover, in clinical practice, physicians are likely to initiate empirical antimicrobial therapy anyway after requesting testing by conventional methods, especially for patients with typical CNS symptoms and signs. In this case, rapid diagnostic testing using PCR assays is likely to not make a difference in the clinical the clinical decision making and medical management of the patient.\n\nImaging Studies\n\nNeuroimaging plays little role in the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis except as indicated earlier to rule out the presence of mass lesions and raised ICP, which might increase the risk of herniation when lumbar puncture is performed. The major value of CT and MRI scans in patients with acute bacterial meningitis is in the investigation of complications, such as cerebral infarction, vasculitis, abscess, or hydrocephalus. Figure shows the typical neuroradiological appearances of the brain in patients with meningitis caused by L. monocytogenes, N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, and M. tuberculosis. In patients with prolonged fever of 10 days duration or longer, up to 25 % may have a subdural effusion (Fig. ). In some cases this may progress to a subdural empyema, which may account for the prolonged fever (Fig. ). Cortical infarction is a common complication of bacterial meningitis and usually results from vasospasm of cerebral vasculature or vasculitis associated with the meningitis itself. The MRI scan is more sensitive than CT imaging in detecting cerebritis and cortical infarction. Cerebritis is an early complication that may occur during the first 4 days (Fig. ). Early necrotic regions filled with polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells and with ill-defined parenchymal swelling characterize cerebritis. In late cerebritis (4–8 days), central necrosis increases, there is vascular proliferation and more inflammatory cells, and suppurative foci begin to breakdown and become encapsulated.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe pathophysiology of the blood–brain barrier is of critical importance in determining the choice of antimicrobials for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis. The penetration of the blood–brain barrier is a function of both the properties (e.g., lipid solubility, molecular size, and molecular structure) of the antimicrobial itself and the degree or extent of the inflammation of the meninges. For example, chloramphenicol, which is highly lipid soluble, will readily penetrate uninflamed meninges. Fortunately, in inflamed meninges therapeutic concentrations of penicillins, cephalosporins, and vancomycin can be achieved for treatment of the vast majority of cases of bacterial meningitis. Because only the free, unbound portion of an antimicrobial agent is capable of crossing the blood–brain barrier, the degree of protein binding of the antimicrobial in the patient serum is critical in determining how much of the agent eventually gets through to the CSF. With increased concentrations of protein in the CSF, protein binding becomes a significant factor in the effectiveness those antimicrobials that are highly protein bound.\n\nThe penetration of aminoglycosides is generally so poor that they are of little value in the treatment of acute meningitis when given intravenously, although they may be useful intrathecally. The penetration of the third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone and cefotaxime) is significantly better than that of the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Quinolones, tetracyclines, and macrolides do not penetrate the blood–brain barrier sufficiently to be useful first-line agents in the treatment of meningitis, whereas sulfa agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfa) and vancomycin, in the presence of inflamed meninges, may reach sufficient concentrations to be of therapeutic value.\n\nTreatment regimens for acute bacterial meningitis in children above the age of 3 months and in adults up to the age of 50 is geared to treating the most common pathogens: N. meningitides, S. pneumoniae, and, less commonly, H. influenzae. The prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae has risen so that more than 50 % of strains may be resistant or exhibit intermediate resistance to penicillin in some parts of the United States and other countries. By definition, fully susceptible pneumococci are susceptible to penicillin at less than 0.1 μg/mL; intermediate susceptibility is defined by an MIC less than or equal to 2 μg/mL, whereas fully resistant S. pneumoniae are defined by MICs greater than or equal to 4 μg/mL. Among penicillin-resistant strains, resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins, including cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, has been increasing; resistance to ceftriaxone as high as 35 % has been documented for S. pneumoniae isolates in some areas [52–55].\n\nOnce a clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis is suspected or made, institution of antimicrobial therapy should be immediate. If clinical evaluation raises a suspicion of raised intracranial pressure, or if the patient manifests signs of papilledema or focal neurological deficits, blood should be drawn for culture and baseline testing (e.g., white blood count and glucose), and empiric antimicrobial therapy initiated before the patient is sent off for imaging studies of the brain. Choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy is dictated by the age of the patient, vaccine status, and whether bacterial meningitis was acquired in the community or within the healthcare setting.\n\nFor community-associated meningitis, the microorganisms most commonly implicated are S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, Listeria spp., other Streptococcus spp., S. aureus, and H. influenzae. Healthcare-associated meningitis usually follows neurosurgical procedures, such as craniotomy, placement of ventriculostomy tubes, or deep brain stimulation of the brain for Parkinson’s disease; pathogens most commonly implicated in healthcare settings include gram-negative microorganisms (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters), S. aureus, and Streptococcus spp.\n\nInitial empirical therapy for community-acquired meningitis: for adult and children 3 months–50 years, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime can be given, especially if risk factors (e.g., CSF leak, pneumonia, or sinusitis) for S. pneumoniae meningitis are present. If the patient is very sick or if gram-positive cocci are seen on CSF microscopy, vancomycin should be added to the therapeutic regimen to cover for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae in a dose of 2–3 g/day given every 8–12 h in adults and at 60 mg/kg for children in four divided doses, until it is known that the penicillin MIC is less than 0.1 mg/mL For patients with a history of idiosyncratic reactions to penicillin or cephalosporins, vancomycin is recommended, although chloramphenicol may be used in adults. For patients with a history of severe penicillin allergy, chloramphenicol at a dose of 4–6 g/day in four divided doses for adults should be given in place of the third-generation cephalosporin together with vancomycin. In adults more than 60 years of age, patients with chronic alcoholism, immunosuppression, or other debilitating conditions, the possibility of L. monocytogenes meningitis should be considered. Empirical therapy to cover L. monocytogenes includes addition of maximal doses of ampicillin (12 g daily dosed every 4 h) to the cephalosporin or vancomycin regimen until culture results for blood or CSF become available. For patients with penicillin allergy, the use of chloramphenicol, imipenem, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can be considered as an alternative to cover for Listeria until culture results are available. Therapy may need to be broadened depending on the results of the gram stain. In cases where gram-negative diplococci are seen, it is probably prudent to wait until culture results confirm N. meningitidis before narrowing the bacterial coverage to penicillin because of the possibility that the gram stain might have been misinterpreted. Treatment of the most common etiologic agents of acute bacterial meningitis is summarized in Table .\n\nTable 22.3\n\nEmpirical treatment for patients with suspected meningitis but negative gram stain or culture Age group Likely organisms Empiric regimen Preterm to <1 monthGroup B Streptococcus; Escherichia coli; Listeria sp.Ampicillin 100 mg/kg IV q6h plus cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV q6h or ampicillin 100 mg/kg IV q6h plus gentamicin 2.5 mg/kg IV q8h1 month–50 years Streptococcus pneumoniae; Neisseria meningitidis; Haemophilus influenzae; Listeria sp.Adult: ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h or cefotaxime 2 g IV q4-6 h plus vancomycin 15 mg/kg q6–8 hChild: ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg/day IV (doses given q12h) or cefotaxime 200–300 mg/kg/day IV (doses given q6h) plus vancomycin 60 mg/kg/day IV (doses given q6h)>50 years S. pneumoniae; N. meningitidis; H. influenzae; Listeria sp.; aerobic gram-negative microorganismsAmpicillin 2 g IV q4h plus ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h or cefotaxime 2 g IV q6h plus vancomycin 15 mg.kg IV q8–12 hTrauma: skull fracture S. pneumoniae; H. influenzae; Group B StreptococcusVancomycin 15 mg.kg IV q8–12 h plus ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12hTrauma: penetrating Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp.Vancomycin 15 mg.kg IV q8–12 h plus cefepime 2 g IV q8hMeningitis associated with shunts S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp.Vancomycin 15 mg.kg IV q8–12 h plus cefepime 2 g IV q8hNeurosurgery (e.g., craniotomy) S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp.Vancomycin 15 mg.kg IV q8–12 h plus cefepime 2 g IV q8h Therapy for patients with acute bacterial meningitis (suggested by gram stain or culture)—by microorganism Microorganism Treatment Duration of therapy (days) Streptococcus pneumoniae Penicillin-susceptible isolate (MIC <0.1 μg/mL)Adults: penicillin G 4 million units IV q4h or ampicillin 2 g IV q4–6 h10–14Children: 250,000–400,000 U/kg IV q4–6 hSevere penicillin allergy: substitute cephalosporin agent with chloramphenicol 75–100 mg/kg/day in 4 divided dosesIsolate with intermediate (MIC = 0.1–1μg/mL) susceptibility to penicillinCeftriaxone 2 g IV q12h or cefotaxime 2 g IV q4–6 hIsolate resistant (≥2μg/mL) to penicillinCeftriaxone 2 g IV q12h or cefotaxime 2 g IV q4–6 h plus vancomycin 15 mg/kg q6–8 h Neisseria meningitidis Adults: penicillin G 4 million units IV q4h or ampicillin 2 g IV q4–6 h or ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h or cefotaxime 2 g IV q4–6 h.

The use of dexamethasone as an adjunct to therapy in acute bacterial meningitis is complex. It has been shown clearly in animal models and in patient studies that dexamethasone reduces the level of inflammation and reduces the levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha [56]. However, in an animal model, administration of dexamethasone together with vancomycin reduced the penetration of vancomycin into the CSF by 29 % and lowered the rate of bacterial clearance during the first 6 h in animals who received an intermediate dose of vancomycin. Animals that received a higher dose had therapeutic peaks maintained despite steroid use, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effect of the steroids, which reduce entry of antibiotics into the CSF, may be overcome to some extent by increasing the dose [57]. In animal studies of experimental pneumococcal meningitis, an antibiotic-induced secondary inflammatory response in the CSF was demonstrated only in animals with high initial CSF bacterial concentrations; these effects were modulated by dexamethasone therapy [58].\n\nHuman studies of the use of dexamethasone have clearly shown that there is a reduction in severe hearing loss in patients who have H. influenza type b meningitis and there is a similar reduction in overall neurologic complications although perhaps not as significant. In children with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae, there also appears to be a significant reduction in long-term hearing loss [59]. Major side effects from dexamethasone include secondary fever and a small incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding which is probably negligible if treatment is limited to 2 days but increases up to 3 % in patients who received 4 or more days of treatment or more.\n\nIn summary, dexamethasone probably should be used as an adjunct in children at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg IV every 12 h for no more than 2 days and probably should be given just before, or at the time of, the first antibiotic dose to block any increase in any inflammatory cytokine production following initial bacterial lysis. A more recent study has shown that adjunctive dexamethasone in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis in adults does not appear to significantly reduce death or neurological disability and concludes that the benefit of adjunctive dexamethasone for all or any subgroup of patients with bacterial meningitis remains unproven [60].\n\nThe duration of treatment of bacterial meningitis is based on empiric observation. In general, the minimum duration treatment is 7 days as long as the patient is afebrile for the last 4–5 days. Treatment of S. pneumoniae generally takes longer than H. influenzae and N. meningitidis and may be extended to 10–14 days, depending on the patient’s response. Meningitis following trauma and neurosurgical procedures is discussed elsewhere.\n\nComplications\n\nElevated ICP is a result of cerebral edema due to acute bacterial meningitis and should be anticipated. Clinical manifestations of raised ICP include bradycardia, hypertension, altered mental status, drowsiness, obtundation and coma, third cranial nerve palsies, including unilateral or bilateral dilated, poorly reactive or nonreactive pupils, abnormal ocular movement, abnormal respiration, or decerebrate posturing. Papilledema is relatively uncommon and as such is an unreliable sign of raised ICP as it may take several hours to develop after the ICP has increased. Signs of herniation may supersede those of increased pressure and include unequal, dilated, or nonreactive pupils, dysconjugate eye movements, decorticate and decerebrate posturing, and bradycardia with abnormal respiratory patterns.\n\nPatients who are awake and alert can be monitored closely. Patients who are obtunded or comatose, or who manifest other signs of increased ICP may well benefit from ICP monitoring. Pressures exceeding 20 mmHg should be treated and some studies suggest that even pressures greater than 15 mmHg may benefit from treatment [61]. An indication for treating at lower pressure levels is the phenomenon of “plateau waves” (Fig. ), which are large elevations in pressure that occur spontaneously, or due to changes in cerebral blood flow, small shifts in intracranial blood volume resulting from hypoxia, fever, or otherwise innocuous events like tracheal suctioning. When these waves develop on a background of already increased ICP, herniation and irreversible brain stem injury may ensue [61, 62].\n\nThe treatment of increased ICP includes elevation of the head of the bed to 30° above the horizontal to facilitate venous drainage, intubation, and hyperventilation to reduce and maintain the arterial PaCO2 concentrations to levels between 27 and 30 mmHg. Hypertonic osmotic agents, such as mannitol or hypertonic saline infusions, play a vital role in the reduction of elevated intracranial pressure and treatment of cerebral edema in patients with CNS infections [63–68]. Both mannitol and hypertonic saline reduce cerebral edema in many clinical syndromes [63–67]. However, recent data suggest that hypertonic saline appears to achieve a greater reduction in ICP than other osmotic agents [63, 65]. The object in using osmotic agents is to achieve a sustained reduction in intracranial pressure by modifying the modes and rates of administration of the respective osmotic agent [63–67].\n\nPhenobarbital therapy may be considered if raised ICP remains uncontrolled by the foregoing interventions. Caution is advised in the use of hyperventilation to lower arterial PaCO2 concentrations because overly vigorous treatment may cause these values to fall below 25 mmHg, running the risk of further reductions in cerebral blood flow causing cerebral ischemia. The dose of mannitol in children is 0.5–2.0 g/kg infused over 30 min and repeated as necessary; in adults the usual dose is 0.25–1 g/kg bolus injection and 0.25 g/kg every 2–3 h as needed. Mannitol and hypertonic saline act as hyperosmolar agents and remain almost entirely within the intravascular space, producing an osmotic gradient that shifts intracranial fluid into this space. Serum osmolality should be frequently checked and kept between 315 and 320 mOsm/L [61–63, 67–71].\n\nDexamethasone has been used to reduce intracranial swelling in other settings primarily because of its effectiveness in vasogenic cerebral edema. Various clinical studies support the use of adjunctive dexamethasone in infants or children with H. influenza type b meningitis to reduce the risk of neurologic and audiologic complications, especially in those with raised ICP or coma. High-dose barbiturates may be helpful when other methods have failed to control increased ICP. Barbiturates decrease the CNS metabolic demand for oxygen thereby decreasing cerebral blood flow which, in turn, causes a fall in ICP. Phenobarbital is given at an initial dose of 5–10 mg/kg, at a rate of 1 mg/kg per minute followed by 1–3 mg/kg/h [61, 62]. Such therapies require regular ICP measurements and monitoring of cerebral electrical activity with electroencephalography. Phenobarbital is given until the ICP falls to levels 20 mmHg or until approximately 90 % burst suppression on the EEG (i.e., nine out of the ten screens of the EEG are flat) has been achieved. Serum phenobarbital concentrations should be kept within the range of 20–40 μg/mL. Pentobarbital is preferred because of its relatively short half-life (24 h) versus phenobarbital with a relatively longer half-life. Side effects of high-dose barbiturate therapy include cardiac depression with arrhythmias and hypotension, thus mandating invasive hemodynamic monitoring in these patients.\n\nSeizures\n\nSeizures occur in approximately 30–40 % of children and adults with acute bacterial meningitis within the first few days of illness. If not treated, seizures may progress to status epilepticus, which in turn can lead to anoxic damage of the temporal lobe, cerebellum, and thalamus. The principles of therapy are to control seizure activity quickly and definitively. To initiate therapy, short-acting anticonvulsants, such as lorazepam or diazepam, are administered followed by a long-acting agent like phenytoin. Lorazepam is given IV in doses of 1–4 mg in adults, and 0.05 mg/kg in children. Phenytoin is given IV at a dose of 18–20 mg/kg and at a rate of no more than 50 mg/min. The rate should be decreased if signs of toxicity, such as hypotension or a prolonged QT interval, develop. If phenytoin is not successful in controlling seizure activity, intubation and treatment with IV phenobarbital may be necessary. Patients must be watched and monitored carefully for signs of toxicity, such as hypotension and respiratory depression. Phenobarbital should be given IV at a rate of 100 mg/min until seizure activity stops, up to an initial dose of 20 mg/kg.\n\nIn children, the rate should be decreased to 30 mg/min. Should these measures fail to control seizures, general anesthesia and additional phenobarbital therapy may have to be considered.\n\nVaccination for Meningitis\n\nN. meningitidis became a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in the United States after dramatic reductions in the incidence of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type b infections had been achieved as a result of using conjugate vaccines [1, 72, 73]. However, since 2000, meningococcal disease incidence has decreased and incidence for serogroups C and Y, which represent the majority of cases of vaccine-preventable meningococcal disease, is at historic lows. In 2005, a quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine (MCV4) was licensed for use among persons aged 11–55 years, and during the same year, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine vaccination with 1 dose of MCV4 for persons aged 11–12 years, persons entering high school (i.e., at approximately age 15 years) if not previously vaccinated with MCV4, and other persons at increased risk for meningococcal disease, including college freshmen living in dormitories [74]. In 2010, ACIP approved updated recommendations for the use of quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135) meningococcal conjugate vaccines in adolescents and persons at high risk for meningococcal disease [75, 76]. The vaccine contains immunogenic polysaccharide capsular material from serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135. The vaccine has few side effects and is believed to be protective for at least 3–5 years.\n\nPersons at increased risk for severe pneumococcal disease include those who are immunocompromised, asplenic or splenectomized, or patients with chronic illness such as chronic cardiovascular disease (e.g., congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathies), chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, chronic liver disease (cirrhosis), or CSF leaks. CDC has updated recommendations from ACIP for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (i.e., bacteremia, meningitis, or infection of other normally sterile sites) through use of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among all adults aged greater than or equal to 65 years and those adults aged 19–64 years with underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk for serious pneumococcal infection [77].\n\nViral Meningitis and Encephalitis\n\nViral CNS infections may be classified as exogenous due to infection with a viral agent acquired outside the host or endogenous due to reactivation of viruses that have remained latent in the host. The majority of viral CNS infections are caused by exogenously acquired enteroviruses (Coxsackie virus A and B, echovirus, polio virus), arboviruses, and, less commonly, by HSV, mumps virus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), adenovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), West Nile virus (WNV), rabies virus, or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. HSV encephalitis is unique in that it may occur as part of the primary infection or be seen in patients in whom the infection has been latent for many years. CNS infections due to the other herpes viruses, such as EBV, VZV, or CMV occasionally may be seen as part of the primary infection but may also occur as reactivated infections in patients who are immunosuppressed or HIV-infected.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nMeningitis and meningoencephalitis are the most common viral CNS infections encountered in the United States. The overwhelming majority of these infections are caused by enteroviruses, which produce disease in outbreaks occurring mainly during the summer months, but may occur during May to October in warmer parts of the United States. While virtually all of the various serotypes of echovirus and Coxsackie virus can produce meningitis and meningoencephalitis, in addition to other syndromes, the 15 most commonly noted enteroviruses in the United States during 1970–2005 accounted for 83.5 % of CDC reports with known serotype [78]. The five most commonly reported serotypes (echoviruses 9, 11, 30, and 6 and Coxsackie virus B5) in descending order of frequency accounted for approximately half (48 %) of all reports [78]. CSF was the most common specimen type. The epidemiologic pattern is one in which certain strains, such as echovirus 30 or echovirus 9, cause disease endemically, while other strains occur in sporadic outbreaks varying from year to year in different regions. Enteroviruses are transmitted from person to person by the fecal-oral route and their activity tends to be increased in areas of overcrowding, poverty, and generally poor hygienic conditions.\n\nArboviruses account for the majority of epidemic cases of encephalitis. Their occurrence follows an identical seasonal distribution to that of viral meningitis and meningoencephalitis associated with enteroviruses. However, the mode of transmission is completely different. Arboviruses are spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes, which are part of a complex cycle of enzootic transmission between birds, mosquitoes, and small mammals. The epidemiology of these diseases may be affected in part by prevention efforts from the public health authorities. For example, many states maintain surveillance systems that include testing of mosquitoes for the presence of virus, as well as sentinel chicken flocks to determine arbovirus activity. Such efforts lead to early recognition of an outbreak and warnings by public health authorities for the population to take precautions such as insect repellants, wearing long sleeve shirts, and avoiding outdoor activity in the early evening hours when transmission is most likely to occur. In addition, mosquito control activities may contribute to reduction in rates of infection.\n\nIn August of 1999, an outbreak of encephalitis was detected in the borough of Queens, New York City: 62 patients were confirmed infected with an agent identified as the arbovirus West Nile virus (WNV); seven eventually died. This followed a massive die-off among birds, particularly crows that had been observed during the month before the outbreak. Most of those affected with serious illness were elderly, although one patient was 29 years old [79–81]. In 2003, there were over 8,000 cases of WNV infections reported to the CDC with 199 deaths; most of these cases involved the CNS. During the ensuing decade, WNV occurrence started to spread westward across the continental United States, and by the end of 2004 approximately 1 in 400 blood donors were thought to be infected with WNV (CDC data).\n\nAlthough rabies is rare among humans in the United States, potential exposures to rabid animals lead to between 16,000 and 39,000 persons receiving post rabies exposure prophylaxis each year [82]. Since the 1950s, the incidence of rabies in domestic animals has declined dramatically because of immunization of dogs and other domestic animals. Unlike the situation in developing countries, wild animals are the most important potential source of rabies for both humans and domestic animals in the United States; most reported cases of rabies occur among raccoons, skunks, and foxes and various species of bats [82]. During 2010, the number of rabies cases—both in animals and humans—reported in the United States fell 8 % compared with the previous year [83].\n\nPathogenesis\n\nViral infection of the CNS occurs via two distinct routes: hematogenous and neuronal. Enteroviruses and arboviruses are carried to the CNS via the blood stream, while HSV and the rabies virus are carried to the CNS via nerve cells themselves. Because viruses must replicate intracellularly, the ability to cause disease is largely determined by whether viral surface proteins can attach to specific receptors on specific cells in affected tissues—i.e., tissue trophism. An example of viral tissue tropism being determined by the combination of viral surface proteins and specific tissue receptors is that of the binding of the HIV GP120 to the CD4+ receptor on T4 lymphocytes. Other tissues with HIV tropism include monocytes and derived cells (macrophages), Langerhans cells, glial cells, and dendritic cells, all of which express the CD4+ receptor. Cells that do not express this receptor generally do not become infected with HIV [84]. So important are these surface binding sites for their respective cellular receptors that several viruses such as rhinovirus, influenza virus, and poliovirus have evolved “sophisticated” molecular mechanisms to protect these sites from the host immune response.\n\nEnteroviruses are transmitted in human populations largely through fecal-oral transmission. These viruses survive stomach acid, replicate in the intestine, and an initial viremia leads to infection of multiple organs within the body. A secondary viremia from these sources can lead to CNS involvement. The prompt production of antibody disrupts this second viremia and prevents invasion of the CNS. In the case of arboviruses, humans typically become infected when an infectious mosquito pierces the host epidermis to take a blood meal, depositing virus principally in the extravascular tissue although direct inoculation into the bloodstream can occur. Local replication is followed by viremia, and brain involvement is probably determined by viral tropism and the rapidity of the host immune response.\n\nFor CNS infections that occur following a viremia, invasion of the brain involves attachment of the virus to the endothelial cells, presumably via specific receptors. Following invasion, an acute inflammatory reaction occurs with a perivascular distribution within the brain parenchyma and varying degrees of involvement of the meninges, depending on the infecting viral agent. The perivascular inflammatory response is predominately mononuclear although polymorphonuclear leukocytes may be seen. Infection of neural cells results in degenerative changes and phagocytosis by tissue macrophages or microglial cells. Some pathologic features are unique to certain viruses: for example, cerebral atrophy and production of multinucleated giant cells and multiple nodules of infected microglia are seen in the white matter in patients with HIV encephalitis (Fig. ), or the characteristic features of multinucleation, nuclear molding, chromatin margination, ground glass nuclei, and Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusion bodies seen in HSV infections (Fig. ), with extensive asymmetrical necrosis in the temporal lobes, in the insulae, and in the cingulate gyri, typically seen in neuroimaging studies (Fig. ) [85]. In the case of rabies, histopathologic evidence of rabies encephalomyelitis (inflammation) in brain tissue and meninges includes mononuclear infiltration, perivascular cuffing of lymphocytes or polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytic foci, Babes nodules consisting of glial cells, and the pathognomonic Negri body—an intracytoplasmic inclusion body within which the virus can be identified (Fig. ).\n\nSome viral infections, most notably HSV and rabies, spread to the CNS via a neuronal route. In the case of HSV, the distribution involves the medial part of the temporal lobe bilaterally with one temporal lobe generally much more involved than the other. Autopsy studies carried out on patients who died during active HSV encephalitis show the presence of virus in the olfactory bulbs, olfactory tracts, and the tracts of the limbic system which end in the hippocampus, amygdala, insula, cingulate gyrus, and olfactory cortex [86]. Thus, the virus appears to gain access to the CNS from the nasal mucosa to the olfactory bulbs and olfactory tracts, although the mechanism by which the virus does this remains unknown. About two-thirds of cases of HSV encephalitis in adults and older children occur in patients who have antibody to the virus at the time of infection. Many of these patients have a history of cold sores dating back 20–30 years. In the other one-third of patients, antibody to HSV is lacking at the time of onset of symptoms indicating that the encephalitis is likely part of the primary infection. Approximately 90–95 % of the cases of HSV encephalitis in older children and adults are due to HSV type I, with the remaining 5–10 % due to HSV type II. Neonatal herpes appears to be different, in that 90–95 % of these cases are due to HSV type II acquired from maternal or other sources at the time of birth. Infection of the CNS in neonates generally follows systemic viremic spread; however, there is no temporal lobe localization.\n\nRabies infection may result from contact with saliva or other secretions from infected animals as well as the animal bite itself. Rabies replicates initially at the local site of inoculation, and for this reason emergency preventive measures, such as thorough cleansing of the wound and infiltration with human rabies immunoglobulin, can be effective in preventing infection with this viral agent. In the process of local replication, the rabies virus invades the nerve sheaths and is transported via nerve cells to the CNS. The rapidity of the rabies virus in reaching the CNS is a function of the distance of the nerve endings from the CNS. Thus, bites on the lower extremities may take months to produce symptoms in the CNS, whereas bites in the face may reach the CNS within weeks. It is also important to recognize that the initial incident may be forgotten because of the length of time of the onset of CNS symptoms after the initial infecting event or because the inoculation may be unapparent as has been reported for bats [87]. Therefore, a high index of suspicion for rabies is essential when managing patients with encephalitis of unknown cause, especially in patients who exhibit signs of hyperirritability.\n\nClinical Manifestations\n\nViral meningitis is an acute illness characterized by fever, headache, stiff neck, photophobia, and varying degrees of nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Generally, neither disturbance of mental status nor abnormal neurological signs are characteristic of viral meningitis. The presence of obtundation, disorientation, seizures, or localized neurologic signs should suggest brain parenchymal involvement and a diagnosis of encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. Neck stiffness is generally less severe compared with bacterial meningitis. Clinical clues to an enteroviral etiology include presence of a viral exanthem, pleuropericarditis, pleurodynia, painful oropharyngeal ulcers, or peripheral vesicular lesions suggestive of hand, foot, and mouth disease. The CSF in patients with viral meningitis is usually clear with an elevated white cell count; polymorphonuclear leukocytes may predominate within the first 24–48 h, although this number rarely exceeds 80 % of total CSF white cells. CSF protein is generally mildly elevated, and the glucose is normal with the occasional exception in about 10–20 % of patients with mumps and less often in patients with enterovirus or HSV infection. In viral meningitis, the CSF gram stain will be negative and routine CSF cultures will not yield bacterial growth. When the initial CSF analysis shows over 50 % polymorphonuclear leukocytes, it is not uncommon for clinicians to repeat the lumbar puncture over the next 12–24 h to determine whether there is a shift towards a lymphocytic predominance, as one would expect in viral meningitis.\n\nA parameningeal infectious focus (e.g., brain abscess) will characteristically be associated with a CSF pleocytosis, a likely elevated protein, and a normal glucose. Thus, a patient with an epidural abscess or a brain abscess could present with mild headache, fever, and a CSF picture identical to that of viral meningitis. Some cases of sphenoid or frontal sinusitis may feature a CSF pleocytosis. Patients with fungal and tuberculous meningitis may also present with headache, fever, and stiff neck, but in general the clinical course is longer than an acute viral meningitis. The CSF in patients with fungal or tuberculous meningitis generally has a relatively low glucose level, usually less than 40 mg/dL.\n\nThe CSF in patients with cryptococcal meningitis may be completely normal. Fever, headache, and nonspecific CSF findings can also be seen in other infections, such as syphilis, ehrlichiosis, and noninfectious conditions, such as sarcoidosis, Behcet’s disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, or uveoparotitis.\n\nViruses other than enteroviruses can also produce aseptic meningitis. For example, HSV type II produces very typical aseptic meningitis with low-grade fever, headache, stiff neck, and photophobia as part of primary genital herpes infection. Therefore, it is important to question the sexually active patient about a history of genital herpetic lesions and to perform a pelvic examination in women where indicated. Aseptic meningitis can also be seen as part of the syndrome of primary HIV infection. Certain strains of leptospirosis will typically present with aseptic meningitis; however, most cases present in conjunction with systemic disease and severe involvement of other organs such as lung, liver, and kidney. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) belongs to the family Arenavirus and is found globally [88]. LCMV meningitis is typically associated with exposure to rodents, such as common house mouse (Mus musculus and M. domesticus), hamsters, and guinea pigs. Transmission occurs by inhalation (aerosol and droplet), fomites, or direct contact with excreta or blood from infected rodents. The incubation period is 1–2 weeks; symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, chills, myalgia, headache, photophobia, anorexia, pharyngitis, and cough. CNS invasion is seen only in a few patients either after an initial febrile illness. During the neurologic phase, patients acquire aseptic meningitis and peripheral leukocytosis. CSF leukocyte cell counts are often greater than 1,000 cells /μL, and glucose levels are low. LCMV meningitis may be associated with an ascending paralysis, transverse myelitis, or encephalitis; overall case fatality is less than 1 % [88].\n\nThe laboratory diagnosis of viral meningitis is generally one of exclusion. Viral cultures of CSF that yield growth of enteroviruses are diagnostic. However, these are positive in only 30–50 % of cases. PCR has become available for the diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis and these PCR platforms correlate very well with the results of viral culture. Unfortunately, PCR testing may not be routinely available at clinical microbiology laboratories for various reasons, including cost cutting measures and lack of trained personnel. Sending specimens to reference laboratories or highly specialized research laboratories is an alternative, but results generally will not be available during the acute phase of the patient’s illness. In the case of HSV meningitis, the diagnosis is confirmed if HSV is cultured from CSF or detected by PCR. For aseptic meningitis associated with systemic infections, such as leptospirosis, syphilis, or ehrlichiosis, diagnosis can be confirmed through standard serologic testing generally available at state public health laboratories or reference laboratories.\n\nBecause there are over 75 different enterovirus serotypes, testing is only possible for a subset of these. In addition there is tremendous overlap in the serologic response between the different serotypes such that seroconversion to one or more enterovirus serotype can occur. Moreover, since there is no specific therapy, expensive laboratory testing is unlikely to affect patient outcome. For these reasons, serologic studies for the diagnosis of enterovirus infections are generally not indicated.\n\nA common diagnostic misconception is the usefulness of CSF antibodies. With the exception of the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test, which indicates active CNS syphilis, and the ratio of measles antibodies in CSF to serum levels in extremely rare cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), routine CSF antibody testing does not affect patient outcomes. In general, infectious viral agents can more readily be diagnosed from serum rather than CSF studies. Tests for common viral infections and preferred diagnostic methods are outlined in Table .\n\nTable 22.4\n\nVirusCNS diseaseSerologyViral cultureDirect antigenPCR/other Herpes viruses Herpes simplexTemporal lobe encephalitisAbout 2/3 seropositive on admission, not helpful in DxAlmost always negative in CSF, throat, etc.None for CSF≥ 90 % sensitive on CSF—reference labs and some academic medical centers onlyFA can be done on brain biopsyVaricellaEncephalitis in HIV patientsNot helpful diagnosticallyUsually negative in CSF, throat, etc.None for CSFReference labs onlyFA can be done on brain biopsyMRI may be suggestiveCytomegalovirusEncephalitis in HIV patientsAlmost always positiveUrine, throat, blood may be positive—consistent with but not proof of encephalitisAntigenemia test on blood, positive test consistent with but not proof of encephalitisIf CSF positive, encephalitis likely, but asymptomatic HIV patients may also be positiveMRI may be suggestiveEpstein-Barr VirusRare encephalitis in mononucleosisMonospot test good presumptive test, may be"
