        "text": "If you’re out and about this summer in New Zealand, you may have time to visit some of the country’s art galleries, large and small. It’s a pastime I enjoy as you never know what you might come across.\n\nAuckland Art Gallery’s major exhibition ‘Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera: Art and Life in Modern Mexico‘ is drawing the crowds until January 22, but around the corner is a series of quieter galleries where the work is just as interesting. ‘Robin White: Te Whanaketanga | Something is Happening Here‘ is a retrospective of this contemporary artist’s work that’s open until the end of January.\n\nThe galleries progress us through the work of Dame Robin White from the Bay of Plenty to Dunedin to Kiribati and back to New Zealand.\n\nHanging in a gallery on its own is the large, multi-panelled Summer Grass, made in 2001 with Japanese artist Keiko Iimura and usually at Aratoi, Wairarapa Museum of Art and History. In 2021 the work formed part of ‘Another Energy: Power to Continue Challenging‘, an exhibition at the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo, celebrating the work of 16 female artists aged 70 or older.\n\nSummer Grass is a response to an incident in a POW camp in Featherston in Wairarapa during World War 2. The information below the image is extracted from A History of Haiku in New Zealand.\n\nJapanese Memorial Garden, Featherston\n\nAlso known as the Peace Garden, this garden commemorates the Japanese dead from the so-called Featherston Incident of February 25, 1943 when Japanese POWs staged a sit-down strike at their camp – after a Japanese officer was wounded the unarmed POWs rioted and camp guards fired without being ordered to do so.\n\nSixty-eight Japanese died and 54 were injured. One New Zealand soldier was killed by ricochet and six were wounded.\n\nThe camp at Tauherenikau, 2km east of Featherston had been the largest military training camp in New Zealand in World War 1. In 1942, at the request of the United States military, it was re-established as an internment camp for Japanese soldiers captured in the Pacific, mainly Guadalcanal.\n\nAlthough a discussion about a “peace garden” at the site began in the 1970s, the Featherston Returned Services Association (RSA) always opposed the idea. In 1995 Nakamato Toshio, head of Masterton’s Juken Nissho timber mill, offered to finance a peace garden at the site but it still ran into local opposition. However, by 2000 the local council was supporting the plan and the garden opened in 2001.\n\nFeaturing 68 ornamental cherry trees in two rows, it also contains a plaque with this haiku by Matuso Basho (donated by K.J. Nysse of the Batavian Rubber Company in 1979, the translator is uncredited):\n\nbehold the summer grass\n\nall that remains of the\n\ndreams of warriors\n\n* * *\n\nTo my mind, not a terribly good version of this famous haiku, which has been rendered in numerous ways over the years. For those who read Japanese, I have seen the original, written in 1689 about battlefield events of 1189 and their aftermath, quoted as:\n\nNatsukusa ya/ tsuwamonodomo ga/ yume no ato\n\nSummer grasses –\n\nAll that remains\n\nOf soldiers’ visions\n\ntr Geoffrey Bownas & Anthony Thwaite\n\nfrom The Penguin Book of Japanese Verse (1964)\n\nA mound of summer grass:\n\nAre warriors’ heroic deeds\n\nOnly dreams that pass?\n\ntr Dorothy Britton\n\nfrom A Haiku Journey, Basho’s Narrow Road to a Far Province (1974)\n\nThe summer grasses\n\nof brave soldiers’ dreams –\n\nThe aftermath.\n\ntr Donald Keene\n\nfrom The Narrow Road to Oku (1996)\n\nWaves of summer grass:\n\nAll that remains of soldiers’\n\nImpossible dreams.\n\ntr David Bowles (2013)\n\nfrom his website\n\nsummer grass\n\nthe only remains of soldiers’\n\ndreams\n\ntr Jane Reichhold\n\nfrom Basho, The Complete Haiku (2013)\n\nSummer grasses:\n\nall that remains of great soldiers’\n\nimperial dreams\n\ntr Sam Hamill\n\nfrom the pocket haiku (2014)\n\nPerhaps you’ll find one among these that sits comfortably with you, or go hunting for another. This selection also serves to highlight the multitude of decisions to be made when rendering Japanese into English! My preferred version is quite simple:\n\nsummer grasses –\n\nall that remains\n\nof warrior’s dreams"
