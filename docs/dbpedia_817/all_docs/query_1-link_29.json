        "text": "Tag Archives: Antarctica\n\nNature: Heterogeneous melting near the Thwaites Glacier grounding line\n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, the MELT team took Icefin beneath Thwaites Glacier (sometimes unfortunately referred to as the Doomsday Glacier). Thwaites is the size of the U.S. state of Florida (or about the size of Great Britain), and is one of the most rapidly changing glaciers on Antarctica. Using a 600 m borehole drilled through the ice by the British Antarctic Survey, members of the MELT team were able to deploy Icefin and other sensors beneath the glacier and maneuver it all the way up to the point where the underside of the ice first detaches from the seafloor, known as the grounding line – a point which was previously unseen, until Icefin. By doing this, the MELT team of scientists and engineers are uncovering critical information about the mechanisms that influence how fast this massive glacier is melting. The team chronicled their findings in two Nature papers, led by the Icefin team and the British Antarctic Survey (Schmidt et al. 2023 and Davis et al., 2023), and here’s what they found.\n\nThe Grounding Line\n\nFigure 1 shows the ocean cavity beneath Thwaites Glacier, sampled with Icefin, leading up to the grounding line, which is the final contact point between the ice and seafloor before the ice goes afloat to form an ice shelf. All of the data in panels b & c come from Icefin sensors: the ice shape (gray) comes from Icefin’s altimeter, sea floor from sonar & DVL, temperature from our CTD.\n\nThe team found that the ocean was warmest and saltiest deep, near the seafloor, but cooled and freshened near the ice base due to melting (here the temperatures are given in thermal driving, which is temperature above the water’s freezing point at that depth). Colder ocean conditions were found very close to the grounding line. However, the ocean remained well above freezing throughout most of the ocean cavity, and therefore contained ample heat to melt the ice. The presence of such a warm ocean beneath Thwaites means that it is capable of melting the ice rapidly.\n\nGrounding Line history left in the seafloor\n\nFigure 2 shows features carved into the seafloor by the ice base of Thwaites Glacier as it flowed over it, when the ice was grounded further towards the ocean. The shape, size, and orientation of these features tells us the history of the region as the grounding line retreated across it. This data comes from our Norbit mapping sonar and Oculus Forward sonar.\n\nThe team found that the seafloor in the survey region contained ridges and troughs that were oriented in the direction that Thwaites Glacier flows. These ridges and troughs extended all the way to the grounding line, where their shape is mirrored by the ice base. A single wedge of sediment cut across these streaking features, from a time when the grounding line stuck in place, called a “grounding line wedge”. Except for this one occasion, there were no other grounding line wedges, meaning that the grounding line retreated steadily backwards across this region over the whole visible period (about the last 10 years). A possible gully was also present in the seafloor near the grounding line, where the team thinks that meltwater may have flowed out like a river from beneath the glacier upstream into the ocean.\n\nUp close and personal with the ice\n\nFigure 3 shows that the ocean conditions are highly variable right up to the underside of Thwaites Glacier. Various factors change depending on distance from the grounding line and whether below flat or steeply sloped ice. Here, data from the forward and upward cameras and the CTD and JFE Rinko Oxygen sensor show that melt water collects at the top of features in flat spaces, and very warm water melts steep slopes.\n\nThe team found that the ocean conditions and the amount of meltwater near the ice base changed depending on the shape of the ice base. Beneath steeply sloping parts of the ice the water remained warm and the ice contained scallop features from strong melting. Beneath flat parts of the ice the water was considerably cooler and fresher. The ice surface was featureless here, because the cold and fresh meltwater inhibited the warm ocean from melting the ice.\n\nOcean flow in crevasses and terraces\n\nFigure 4 shows how fast the ocean flows close to the steep sides of terraces and crevasses.\n\nThe team found that ocean flow speeds increased in crevasses, which helped to mix heat and salt into their steep sides and melt them. The ocean flow decreased beneath the flat ice base, due to friction, which sheltered any terraces above it.\n\nNot all melting is created equal\n\nFigure 5 shows how different ocean conditions influence the way the underside of Thwaites Glacier melts. Various factors, which change depending on the distance from the grounding line, cause the ice to melt at different speeds.\n\nThe team found that, while in some areas along the base of the glacier the ice is melting slower than expected, in other areas like steeply sloped terrace walls and crevasses, the ice is melting much more quickly than previously known. This rapid melting in sloped areas of the underside of the glacier may contribute to the ongoing retreat and eventual collapse of Thwaites, which in turn will have a significant effect on sea level rise. In fact, warm waters in the crevasses are making these cracks wider, contributing to the eventual break up of the ice.\n\nThe slope-melt feedback\n\nFigure 6 further shows how the ice melts at different speeds, depending on the slope of the ice, and how important this is to the overall melting of the glacier.\n\nThe team found that the melt rate increased with the sine of the ice base slope. This led to strong melting of 30 m yr-1 when the ice was vertical and melting of around 5 m yr-1 where the ice was completely flat. Overall, they found that 27% of the total melting occurred at slopes greater than 30°, despite this being a relatively small fraction of the total ice base (about 9%). This means that any part of the ice with a steep slope is very important to the overall melting of the ice.\n\nMore images of the ice base melting\n\nThis series of nine images in Extended Data Figure 8 from the paper shows examples of the strange topography and strongly asymmetric melting under Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica, photographed by Icefin.\n\nThe images from Icefin show conclusively that the ice base beneath different parts of the glacier melts in different manners. Scallop formations on terrace walls and sediment raining down from ice ridges show that stronger melting occurs here than the flat and featureless ice base. These fascinating images will stimulate further investigations into how the ice and ocean interact in Antarctica.\n\nThwaites MELT is a team effort!! Our colleagues at the British Antarctic Survey, led by Peter Davis, also published a companion paper about results from the oceanographic data and the mooring left behind at Thwaites. Please see this other paper here.\n\nNone of this work would have been possible without the efforts of Professor David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey, coauthor on the Icefin paper, who sadly left us in February, 2023. A great scientist and wonderful friend and mentor, he will be sorely missed.\n\nFirst look under Thwaites Glacier and Kamb Ice Stream\n\nGeorgia Tech scientists get first look deep under Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier and Kamb Ice Stream\n\nANTARCTICA — An international team including scientists from Georgia Tech captured new images and first-of-its-kind data from deep beneath an Antarctic glacier, which will help scientists to better understand the impact of one of Antarctica’s fastest changing regions and its impact on future sea level rise.\n\nTheir work will be featured as part of a special report on BBC World News on Tuesday, Jan. 28, in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica.\n\nStationed in Antarctica for the last two months, the MELT (Melting at Thwaites grounding zone and its control on sea level) team, part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, deployed ocean instruments and cored sediments to gather data on one of the most important and hazardous glaciers in Antarctica. The MELT team included Georgia Tech scientists who used an underwater robot named Icefin to navigate the waters beneath Thwaites Glacier and collect data from the grounding zone – the area where the glacier meets the sea.\n\nDr. Britney Schmidt, lead scientist for Icefin and associate professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, said the new data represented several firsts for her team, as well as for science as a whole.\n\n“We designed Icefin to be able to finally enable access to grounding zones of glaciers, places where observations have been nearly impossible, but where rapid change is taking place,” said Schmidt, a co-investigator on the MELT project. “We’re proud of Icefin, since it represents a new way of looking at glaciers and ice shelves. For really the first time, we can drive miles under the ice to measure and map processes we can’t otherwise reach. We’ve taken the first close-up look at a grounding zone. It’s our ‘walking on the moon’ moment.”\n\nLocated in a remote part of Antarctica, where few scientists have ever ventured, the team battled sometimes hostile weather, extreme winds, and temperatures below -22 degrees Fahrenheit to get close enough to the Antarctic coastline for Icefin to reach the grounding zone.\n\nIn these trying conditions, the MELT team used hot water to drill through up to 2,300 feet – nearly a half mile – of ice to get to the ocean and the seafloor below. On Jan. 9 and 10, Icefin swam more than a mile from the drill site to the Thwaites grounding zone, to measure, image, and map the glacier’s melting and gather other important data that scientists can use to understand the changing landscape and conditions. Not only did the team put one Icefin robot down the borehole at Thwaites Glacier, but they did it with a second Icefin vehicle in collaboration with Antarctica New Zealand near the grounding zone of Kamb Ice Stream, part of the Ross Ice Shelf.\n\nThwaites Glacier, which covers an area the size of Florida, is particularly susceptible to climate and ocean changes. Thwaites melting accounts for about 4 percent of global sea level rise, and the amount of ice flowing out of Thwaites and its neighbouring glaciers has nearly doubled in the past 30 years, making it one of Antarctica’s most rapidly changing regions.\n\nDr. Keith Nicholls, an oceanographer from British Antarctic Survey and UK lead on the MELT team, said Icefin’s exploration of sediment and other conditions in the Thwaites grounding zone will help scientists determine how this region will change in the future and what kind of impact on sea level rise we can expect from these changes. The MELT team also deployed radars and oceanographic sensors, conducted seismic studies and took sediment cores from beneath the glacier, and deployed two moorings through the ice that will record ocean and ice conditions for the coming year to monitor changes at Thwaites.\n\n“We know that warmer ocean waters are eroding many of West Antarctica’s glaciers, but we’re particularly concerned about Thwaites,” he said. “This new data will provide a new perspective of the processes taking place, so we can predict future change with more certainty”\n\nThe MELT project is funded by the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC), a collaboration between the U.S.’s National Science Foundation and the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council.\n\n“To have the chance to do this at Thwaites Glacier, which is such a critical hinge point in West Antarctica, is a dream come true for me and my team. The data couldn’t be more exciting,” Schmidt said. “And exploring the grounding zones of two different glaciers in the same season is incredible.”\n\nIn addition to the MELT project, Schmidt is the Primary Investigator for the RISE UP (Ross Ice Shelf and Europa Underwater Probe) project, which also had team members from Georgia Tech deployed in Antarctica this season. RISE UP is a NASA-funded project that developed Icefin from a prototype to a full-fledged underwater vehicle and aims to develop technology for future missions to Jupiter’s moon Europa.\n\nBoth the MELT and RISE UP teams spent time at McMurdo Station, Antarctica conducting research, before simultaneously deploying to more remote areas. Antarctic logistics for both projects were supported by the National Science Foundation, under the United States Antarctic Program.\n\nRISE UP‘s work at Kamb Ice Stream came as part of a collaboration with two projects supported by Antarctica New Zealand: the NZARI Ross Ice Shelf Programme led by Dr Christina Hulbe of the University of Otago, and the NZ Antarctic Science Platform’s Antarctic Ice Dynamics project, led by Dr Huw Horgan of Victoria University.\n\nRISE UP team members deployed along with the New Zealand hot water drilling and science teams to study the Kamb Ice Stream – a river of ice – on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Their goal was to explore and map areas near the grounding zone to better understand its flow and the surrounding environment. Icefin’s work at Kamb Ice Stream will continue next season as part of Dr. Horgan’s project.\n\n“We now have, effectively, a transect of conditions from the front of the Ross Ice Shelf to the grounding line,” sadi Christina Hulbe of the Ross Ice Shelf Programme, which finished its final year of field work in late December. “In addition to Icefin’s work, we’ve installed our third ice-anchored mooring, collected cores for sedimentary and microbiological analysis, we’ve imaged the ice optically and using radar, and made high resolution observations of ocean conditions.”\n\nThe RISE UP team completed three dives with Icefin, and team member Ben Hurwitz, a graduate student at Georgia Tech who works on Icefin’s technology, said the season was wildly successful, adding the team was “excited to share what we found in the coming months.”\n\nNotes on the projects:\n\nThe International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration: www.thwaitesglacier.org\n\nThe MELT Project is lead by Keith Nicholls , an oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), and Dr. David Holland, an applied mathematician (with a background in fluid dynamics) at New York University, with co-leads Dr. Eric Rignot from the University of California at Irving, Dr. John Paden with George Mason University, Dr. Sridhar Anandakrishnan out of Pennsylvania State University, and Dr. Britney Schmidt at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nRISE UP’s field work at Kamb Ice Stream came as part of two science projects funded by Antarctica New Zealand and the Victoria University of Wellington Science Drilling Office. The other research partners involved on the project are: The University of Otago, Victoria University, University of Canterbury and University of Waikato, NIWA and GNS Science from NZ and the ROSETTA project and Universty of California, Santa Cruz in the US.\n\nWeek 8-10 Update: Icefin Team 2019 Antarctic Field Season\n\nWell, folks, that time we’ve been waiting for is upon us: the Icefin teams are about to attempt dives at the grounding zones of the Kamb Ice Stream and Thwaites Glacier!\n\nRISE UP at Kamb Ice Stream Camp with ANZ\n\nIn exciting news, all members of the Icefin KAMB team are now on site at the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, and are as we type working towards Icefin’s first dive through the grounding zone. Matt, Justin, Ben, Peter, and Enrica have been busy preparing Icefin and helping with general duties at the Antarctica New Zealand field camp. Hot water drilling at the site began this week and science is underway! Keep your eyes on @the_Ross_Ice_Shelf_Programme on Instagram for more updates! When we’re able to get a few updates and maybe an image or two we will also update you on Icefin’s social media.\n\nIcefin team headed out to Thwaites Glacier\n\nThe International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration program has been waiting for a break in the weather at WAIS divide camp to get to move folks out to camp. In a week of emotional highs and lows, the weather finally broke in our favor and the first flights to get ITGC personnel into WAIS divide camp and on to their field sites happened late Wednesday, with MELT’s own James Wake, along with USAP safety lead Loomy, and GHC member/radar guru Seth Campbell made it out! The team of three made it to the grounding zone down stream (GZDS) Site where the first hot water hole will be drilled. The safety team was able to land at the site and successfully establish camp. Since then, the intrepid pilots of the Twin Otter and Basler aircraft, both USAP flown by Kenn Borek Air out of Canada and the British Antarctic Survey TO, have completed many rotations to start bringing gear out to the camp. The Basler being able to land at both Cavity Camp (where colleagues in TARSAN will be working) and at GZDS has meant that much faster gear delivery has been possible, making up time from the early season weather delay.\n\nLater in the week the second wave of the team, consisting of the British Antarctic Survey drill and science team, made it on a flight out of McMurdo to WAIS, where Paul Anker and James Smith went to the LTG field camp to break all out all of the drill equipment which was staged over winter to be sent to GZDS. The remaining team, PI Keith Nicholls, mountaineer Catrin Thomas, and Pete Davis proceeded on to the camp site at GZDS where they are establishing camp and receiving gear.

The remaining team, PI Keith Nicholls, mountaineer Catrin Thomas, and Pete Davis proceeded on to the camp site at GZDS where they are establishing camp and receiving gear. The Icefin portion of the MELT team, consisting of Britney, Dan, and Andy are currently all packed up and eagerly waiting their flight to WAIS Divide, which is waiting on good weather to leave MCM. They’ll be joined by PI David Holland and Aurora Basinski-Ferris, as well as members of the TARSAN team. In addition to all the oceanographers, the team was also joined by the final MELT field team members lead by Kiya Riverman, who will be a few days behind the Icefin and NYU teams.\n\nHurry Up and Thwaites\n\nDuring the weather delays, the Icefin team has kept as busy as possible. It’s rare to get a few weeks to catch up, particularly from generally exasperated PI Britney. We’ve used the extra time to make progress in several important areas. Britney has finalized her chapter for the upcoming Planetary Astrobiology book (University of Arizona Press) and been trying to help lead Editor Vikki Meadows as much as possible. She also submitted a Nature Geoscience paper with the Dawn team, and sent back revisions on two planetary science papers by current and former students that should be soon submitted. LPSC abstracts have also been edited for the grad and undergrad students in Atlanta. Now she’s trying to finish proofs on the chapter and this weekly-ish update!! Andy has been working hard to bring the in situ microscope designed for Icefin closer to being ready or field operations, and has made great progress with the extra time. Dan has been working on the redesign of Icefin’s power system and collecting various media to pass on to the BBC and NOVA crews working with the MELT team. Dan is looking forward to helping be team cameraman along with David and Aurora while we’re out at Thwaites. And while we would all have rather been out in the field, having the chance to go to the Helo Hanger concert was a social highlight of the season. McMurdo is an incredibly artistic and talented community, and getting to see several of our friends and colleagues play life music is always a treat, and ran the gamut from folk music to indie rock to a Green Day cover band.\n\nWhile at McMurdo the MELT portion of the Icefin team had the opportunity to work with a film crew representing BBC News and BBC Frozen Planet II. Britney gave an interview describing Icefin and its role on the ITGC initiative, as well as insight into how she became a planetary and earth scientist. The BBC team then filmed Britney, Dan, and Andy preparing the vehicle to be sent to the deep field. The three person BBC team and ITGC lead David Vaughn of BAS have been fun additions to the crew, bringing a different perspective on the potential reach of these critical activities. We’re honored to be a part of it! This update would be remiss without mentioning the absolutely herculean efforts of several parts of the community over the past few weeks.\n\nFirst and foremost, the WAIS Divide and LTG camp staff have been real heroes, working with a fraction of the people they had planned to get the camp up and running, establishing runways and weather reports, and supporting the flotilla of small aircraft who have been keeping the Thwaites dream alive! Cargo movements and camp activities have been underway despite the weather and small crew, the camp mechanics have done a fabulous job getting the traverse equipment up and running, and the carp team now has the camp ready for full time science support. They’ve been doing all of this in heaps of Condition 1 weather, i.e. REALLY HORRIBLY AWFUL. We owe these guys a ton!\n\nNext up: the KBA and BAS pilots. These teams fly into challenging places and make great things happen. Their efforts to get the landing sites surveyed for safe landings, and taking care of all of our cargo and passengers is absolutely critical. Finally: the implementer team, lead by Leslie Blank and Nick Gillett. Every time there is a delay, it changes the plans downstream, and this team has been doing an amazing job of staying on their toes, and keeping things moving forward. It’s easy to feel trapped and get down when these delays occur, but the implementer team has been doing a remarkable job of juggling unknown weather and excitable science teams. So that’s it for now!\n\nMichelle Babcock from the GT Icefin team will be sending out some blurbs from us while we’re out in the field. Enrica and crew will pick up the bulky emails and photos when they return from Kamb, currently sometime just before or after the new year. Brit, Dan and Andy will be out in the field until probably middle to late February, so look for our next check in around Feb 1. Happy holidays to you all out there, and thanks so much for everything you do to support us, from watching cats to sending treats, to fixing machinery, and everything in between!\n\nThis year the field team for Icefin consists of:\n\nBritney Schmidt, Matt Meister, Dan Dichek, Anthony Spears, Justin Lawrence, Ben Hurwitz, Andy Mullen, Peter Washam, and Enrica Quartini.\n\nRISE UP: https://live-schmidt-astro-cornell.pantheonsite.io/project-rise-up/\n\nMELT: https://live-schmidt-astro-cornell.pantheonsite.io/thwaites-melt/\n\nITGC: https://thwaitesglacier.org\n\nRISP: https://www.instagram.com/the_ross_ice_shelf_programme/\n\nFor more updates, pictures, and videos, find us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter @icefinrobot\n\nWeek 5-7 Update: Icefin Team 2019 Antarctic Field Season\n\nSorry for the long delay between updates, friends! The Icefin team has been busy at work the past few weeks with both dive operations and deep field preparations, all culminating with a lovely Thanksgiving holiday. We’ve finally found the time to dig out the pen and ink (or computer, I suppose).\n\nOn November 14, we were joined by the rest of the C-444 Thwaites-Melt team, including Keith Nicholls, Peter Davis, James Smith, Paul Anker, Catrin Thomas and James Wake from the British Antarctic Survey and David Holland and Aurora Basinski-Ferrisof NYU. Among the highlights since our last update were our final four science dives in the McMurdo area. The team deployed Icefin at two additional sites along the roughly East-West running ice shelf rift that has been our primary science target of our operations out of McMurdo. This allowed us to map the structure of the underside of the rift along over a good segment of its length. As far as we know, this is possibly the first detailed and the most comprehensive underwater study of an ice shelf rift. Rift formation is an important part of ice shelf evolution that contributes both to stabilizing the ice and to calving, depending on the setting and ocean conditions. With Icefin and its suite of oceanographic, biological, and perception sensors, we have surveyed the structure of the rift, ocean conditions underneath it to assess marine ice healing of the rift, as well as parameters that describe the water column conditions that affect ecosystems under the ice. We conducted three survey missions, including at two new sites, 19C and 19A, that allowed us to start at the narrow end of the rift where it begins as a crack to places where it splits into two systems, with segments as wide as 40m. Hopefully when combined with satellite remote sensing, we will have an excellent data set for comparison. To some people, all ice looks the same, but to ice nerds like our team (ok, maybe mostly to the PI and science team), all of the varying ice structures and conditions beneath the rift are fascinating. The draft (depth) of the ice varies by up to 10m below the rift, with everything from semi-regular conical platelet lumps on either side to down-dropped blocks covered in platelets but with preserved angular features. We could watch (and have watched) the videos for hours. During our last dive, we deployed ICE03 at the Jetty (fish hut 19) and put together a basic mission to map sections of the bathymetry offshore McMurdo at great resolution with our new Norbit bathymetric sonar (another first for the team!) in preparation for our work to come out at Thwaites glacier. Excitingly, we also got to use this dive as an opportunity to train the rest of the MELT team on Icefin operations. The BAS and NYU teams got a chance to participate in deploying the vehicle, to see Icefin in action, and recover the vehicle. We also took a few great team photos. It’s also been a time of training for our team, in preparation for the deep field. The part of the team going to Kamb Ice Stream (KIS) camp received a half-day Antarctic field training from Antarctic New Zealand while the MELT part of the team had an overnight training on the sea ice led by British Antarctic Survey mountaineers. The Kamb team had a dry run of camp arrangements and plans way back in October before deploying to the ice, but got to work with the ANZ crew on safety procedures for the camp. Because national programs have their own protocols for safety and operations, getting to participate in safety training prior to working together allows for a common language in the field. The full Melt team completed our deep-field shakedown, where we had the opportunity to camp out for a night on the ice shelf as a team using the equipment we’ll be using out in the deep field. For the Icefin team, this was our first chance to experience the famous “man food” boxes that BAS is contributing to the project. We were introduced to Biscuits Brown and a surprising variety of dehy meals. The best part was definitely working with the classic Primus stoves and Tilly lamps. We’ve since had a course on their upkeep and repair as well, and are feeling ready for the field, whenever that should happen! On Nov 20, David Holland organized the Melt team to give the Wednesday night lecture as a team to describe how the whole filed program will work, and the scientific motivation behind it. David, James Wake, Paul, Britney, Pete Davis, James Smith, Aurora, and Keith all gave short presentations about the field campaign, drill, and science plans. Britney introduced the Icefin team and described the plans for Icefin working at the grounding zone. The Crary Library was packed with folks curious about this large piece of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. Prior to the talk, part of the team also got to go over and visit Scott Base for dinner to catch up with our colleagues Greg Leonard and Maren Richter. Next year, we’ll be deploying Icefin along with these folks under Inga Smith’s Marsden project through the University of Otago. Following that work on the sea ice, we’ll be hoping to also join for a second season out at Kamb. On Nov 24 Britney gave the Sunday night science lecture to a packed audience in the galley, who stuck around the talk for at Q&A session and swarmed in to take a look at Icefin’s science and navigation modules, which the team brought to the galley. It’s always one of the highlights of the season to get to share our work with and thank the community that works so hard to support the work we do. We showed videos of the missions under the rift as well as highlights from last season, and stuck around for an hour afterwards answering questions and hanging out with the robot. The final push over the past two weeks has been to finish the season and get the two teams packed up for the deep field. As of today, both Icefins are packed and the team is patiently waiting for the weather to cooperate and allow flight opportunities to KIS camp and Thwaites camp. The weather has so far kept both teams in town, a full week of delays thus far for the Kamb team and ANZ drillers due to weather on the Siple coast. Thwaites operations have also slowed due to weather, but the site safety team (John “Loomy” Loomis, Seth Campbell, and James Wake) going in to prove the camp site is ready to fly on the next flight out. The positive note has been that we all got to spend Thanksgiving celebrations in McMurdo, have a delicious meal all together, and enjoy calling home for the holidays. The team participated in the Turkey Trot 5k, shared the Thanksgiving tradition with our British colleagues for their first Thanksgivings, and had the chance to spend more time together as a full team in advance of what will hopefully be the move out to Kamb this week for the ICE02 team. This year the field team for Icefin consists of:\n\nBritney Schmidt, Matt Meister, Dan Dichek, Anthony Spears, Justin Lawrence, Ben Hurwitz, Andy Mullen, Peter Washam, and Enrica Quartini.\n\nRISE UP: https://live-schmidt-astro-cornell.pantheonsite.io/project-rise-up/\n\nMELT: https://live-schmidt-astro-cornell.pantheonsite.io/thwaites-melt/\n\nITGC: https://thwaitesglacier.org\n\nRISP: https://www.instagram.com/the_ross_ice_shelf_programme/\n\nFor more updates, pictures, and videos, find us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter @icefinrobot\n\nOn the eve of deployment\n\n(Note: This post was written before a week-long delay due to weather and before Matt, our lead engineer, managed to make it out, but most of it still holds.)\n\nI’m anxious.\n\nNot nervous. Anxious.\n\nOur bags are packed. The vehicle and it’s associated spares, tools, and other miscellany have been boxed and are sitting in the airfield waiting to be loaded into a Basler tomorrow for our deep field deployment to the Kamb Ice Stream.\n\nThe anxiety comes from the waiting.\n\nThree years of waiting for this to happen.\n\nThe deep field.\n\nMaybe that should read “The Deep Field”.\n\nIt feels like something that’s so far away, both spatially and temporally. But within twelve hours, we’ll be heading there to do something that nobody has ever done before.\n\nThree years of preparing.\n\nMore for Britney. I can’t imagine her anxiety levels. And she won’t even be there when the vehicle accomplishes its mission, its purpose, for the first time.\n\n(Don’t worry, we’ll take pictures.)\n\n660 meters of ice. That’s 2165 feet. Half a mile. With a 14″ wide hole down, down, down to the bottom. To the underside of the Ross Ice Shelf.\n\nThe Ross!\n\nThe largest ice shelf in the world. (By area only, as Peter keeps saying; by volume, the Filchner-Ronne is larger).\n\nAnd we’re going to the bottom.\n\nThe anxiety is real.\n\nDoes that come across in this blog? Are you anxious with me?\n\nI’ve never been to The Deep Field before. I hope I packed right. Mostly that’s base layers, socks, and a toothbrush.\n\nA month in the middle of nowhere.\n\nNever before will I have been so far from, well, anything.\n\nKIS-1 (“Kamb ice stream 1”), also called HWD-1 (“Hot water drill 1”), is located at 82.77S, 156.57E. The nearest anything is Simple Dome camp, at 81.65417S, 149.005E. And that’s a field camp, not exactly a bustling place. But that would be the closest actual place, 105 miles approximately north.\n\nThat’s an 11 minute flight, for those counting at home, according to WolframAlpha. Or 760 microseconds, if you’re a photon.\n\nLooking at it from that perspective, it’s possible I’ve been farther from people before.\n\nBut I don’t think that it’ll feel that way once we’re there.\n\nDue to some unforeseen circumstances (the C-17 delays and the weather at other sites delaying flights), we’ve gotten lucky. We’ll be flying out a touch earlier than expected, and we’ll be flying with the drillers. So we’ll be among the first out there. This is extremely valuable; the Thwaites project has been massively behind due to the same flight delays, and thus all flights from McMurdo have been pointed towards their staging ground at WAIS Divide (79.4675 S, 112.0864 E). Thus we need to get a flight to KIS-1 before the Thwaites flights start taking people. Because then we become a much lower priority for USAP. Which is fair; Thwaites is a $25 million project, whereas KIS-1 is not even a US-sponsored field camp.\n\nThe Basler we’ll be flying is a modified DC-3. A DC-3! The plane was around prior to WWII! The Baslers, though, have excellent records in Antarctica. They have upgraded avionics and engines, modified fuselage and wings, and a host of other new features. Which is reassuring. I was a little perturbed when I was told it was a DC-3.\n\nBy the time you read this, we’re likely to already be in camp, setting up tents, building snow walls to ward off the wind, and checking out the vehicle. I’ve been told that The Deep Field focuses you. You’re forced to have singular purpose. Distractions are removed from sight and mind.\n\nBut man, am I anxious.\n\nProject RISE UP Could Help Scientists Explore Europa’s Ice-Covered Ocean\n\nBased in McMurdo Station, Antarctica for the first part of their 2019 field season, the team on Project RISE UP is using its underwater oceanographer robot Icefin to study environmental and biological factors that influence habitability in oceans beneath ice.\n\nProject RISE UP, an acronym which stands for “Ross Ice Shelf and Europa Underwater Probe”, is using Icefin to explore ice-ocean environments and the limits of life here on Earth, in order to help develop techniques that might be used for future exploration of ice-ocean ecosystems.\n\nNASA confirmed in 2019 that Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, had plumes of water vapor above its surface, which scientists had long expected from the ice-covered world. In addition, using observations from ground-based telescopes, “scientists have found strong evidence that beneath the ice crust is an ocean of liquid water or slushy ice,” according to NASA. These and other factors make Europa a prime subject in the search for other habitable worlds in our solar system.\n\nGeorgia Tech graduate student and member of the RISE UP team in Antarctica, Justin Lawrence‘s thesis is a major driver of work being done in the 2019 field season. He said the science and technology being developed through RISE UP could be used in the future exploration of icy worlds in our solar system, such as Europa.\n\n“For my thesis, I’m mapping biological water mass properties including cellular abundance and microbial diversity with physical water properties such as temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen,” Lawrence said. “When combined, these variables help us understand how nutrient and carbon inputs from the open ocean and melting ice influence habitability below ice.”\n\nIn other words, studying biological and environmental factors that influence life in ice-ocean ecosystems here on Earth, will help scientists understand habitability in ice-covered oceans elsewhere.\n\n“Earth is not the only body in our solar system with a liquid, salty ocean, and other ocean worlds such as Jupiter’s moon Europa might prove habitable to novel forms of life,” Lawrence explained. “To better understand how ecosystems under ice could work on other planets, we are developing hardware (Icefin), software, and scientific methods to first understand the interactions between life and ice in Antarctica.”\n\nIn addition to research being conducted at McMurdo Station in the 2019 field season, RISE UP will also fly with Icefin to the Ross Ice Shelf grounding zone, in collaboration with New Zealand’s Ross Ice Shelf Programme, where they will deploy Icefin along with other oceanographic sensors through a 35 cm wide, 700 m deep hole in the ice to explore the ocean below (as shown in the diagram above)."
