I ought, therefore, to be fairly well acquainted with what has taken place, during that time, in and concerning the city and which was worthy of record or of a place in its history. For many years I have preserved papers and documents relating to the city, not at first with a view to writing a history thereof, but just as any one would preserve papers or documents he regarded as of more than usual interest. These have so accumulated that I have felt I could in no other way do a better service for the people of Cairo than by using them and other materials in the preparation of a history of the city. Besides this, I have not known of any one who had in contemplation the undertaking here attempted.\n\nIn the year 1864, Mr. Moses B. Harrell, then long a resident of Cairo, wrote an excellent short history of the city, and the same became the first fifty pages of a city directory of that year.\n\nThe History of Alexander, Union, and Pulaski Counties, published in 1883, twenty-seven years ago, contains three several parts relating to Cairo. These parts were written by Mr. H. C. Bradsby, who had before that time resided in Cairo many years. The book is a large one and contains many biographical sketches of citizens of Cairo. There are quite a number of copies of this history in the city I suppose; but of Mr. Harrell's history, there are now only a very few copies.\n\nThis history must necessarily contain much that is found in the other two, just as the second contains much that is found in the first; but I have found a great deal which I have deemed worthy of permanent record, which is not embraced in either of the other two books; and further, many matters merely touched upon in them I have presented much more fully.\n\nIt will be seen that the book contains much historical information about that part of our country which embraces our city, county and state—information that might have been omitted without affecting the local history; but it is believed little of it will be found so foreign to the local history as to seem wholly out of place. Local history would be very local indeed, which did not here and there show the relation of the\n\n6\n\nlocality to much that was outside and pertained to the country at large. Then, too, I have desired to create, in some small degree at least, a desire in the younger people of our community to know more of this part of the Valley of the Mississippi—this Illinois Country, in some respects the richest part naturally of the United States.\n\nI have not been able to devote much time or space to biographical sketches. Ordinarily, it is quite difficult enough to choose between what ought and ought not to go into a local history like this. The book should be a history of the city and not of individuals, excepting, of course, of those persons who have been so identified with its establishment and growth that a history of it with them left out would seem very incomplete.\n\nJ. M. L.\n\nCairo, Illinois, September, 1910.\n\n13\n\nChapter I — Sketch of the Illinois Country.\n\nTHE geographical position of this place, at the junction of the two rivers, requires, it seems to me, a somewhat full account of the attention given it before any attempt was made to establish a city here, which was in the year 1818. This account may, therefore, be called the introductory chapter.\n\nThe colonial grants to Virginia of May 23, 1609, and of March 12, 1612, were for territory extending \"from sea to sea, West and Northwest,\" or from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It was not then known how far westward it was to the Pacific coast; and the uncertainty about the western boundary of the grants afforded grounds for the territorial disputes which subsequently arose.\n\nThe French had entered the country by way of the St. Lawrence quite as early as the English had entered it further southward; and the former, pushing westward and southward, crossed these so-called sea-to-sea grants, which to them had nothing more than a mere paper existence. They, also, not long afterward, came into the country on the south and by way of the Mississippi River. Their claims to the country were based on the right of discovery and on other grounds not necessary to be noticed here. They established posts here and there in their widely extended dominions. Differences now and then arose between the authorities in Canada and those at New Orleans. Both claimed jurisdiction over the Illinois country, which embraced the whole country between the Ohio and the Mississippi rivers and west of Canada. But these jealousies of each other never interfered with their hearty co-operation against the English. All told, their numbers in the whole country were less than one-tenth that of the English; but they went everywhere and easily obtained favor with the original occupants of the country. Religion, business and amusement went hand in hand; and soon it became apparent that New France was to extend from the Gulf to the Great Lakes and thence eastward to the Alleghanies, and that the English were to have nothing west of that mountain range. Nothing shows so clearly the character and extent of the French claim as the fact that it\n\n14\n\nembraced the Ohio River country and reached to the present site of Pittsburg, where they established their Fort Du Quesne.\n\nThe English, seeing their sea-to-sea grants so wholly disregarded, began to assert their supposed superior rights. They saw that should the French acquire permanent lodgment in the Valley of the Mississippi as they had in the Valley of the St. Lawrence and along the Great Lakes, they would be shut in by the Alleghanies and confined to the Atlantic coast. These territorial disputes, to which we can only make the barest reference, extended over well-nigh a century and a half. A few years of peace now and then ensued; but on the whole, a well-established state of controversy existed all the time. The two great nations were the actual claimants, and often the controversy in the new world was but the counterpart of that in the old, between the same parties. The English saw plainly that if they were not to be shut in by that coast range of mountains, they must maintain their asserted territorial lines by force of arms.\n\nThe country was not uninhabited. The Indians were everywhere. Wherever one went in the great broad land, he found himself within the bounds of some one of its innumerable tribes. The contending parties took little account of these early occupants. Each enlisted their aid against the other. In the one case, the Indian was to help the Frenchman for the Frenchman's sake; in the other, the Englishman for the Englishman's sake; but all the while, the contest was for the land and country the Indian himself claimed.\n\nIt was long a state of war, interrupted now and then by stirring events elsewhere. Canada was now and then entered, held, and abandoned by the English. Finally, in the year 1755 what proved to be the final struggle came on; and after the lapse of about seven years, the French and Indian or the French and English wars came to an end with the fall of Quebec, and the Treaty of Paris in 1763. It was a great victory. It was a great treaty. It settled the dispute which had lasted one hundred and fifty years. It cleared every cloud off the English title and made way for a consolidated empire, which never could have existed with New France between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi.\n\nHow the fates of nations are decided! Often a single battle, a single mistake in diplomacy, a single failure to grasp the great situation—these sometimes turn nations upside down and turn the current of events the world over. The new world, or our part of it, was the prize between the Anglo-Saxon and the Latin. They were both seeking to establish great colonies—seeking to reproduce themselves upon the newest and most fertile continent the earth afforded.\n\n\"Thus terminated a war which originated in an attempt on the part of the French to surround the English colonists and chain them to a narrow strip of country along the coast of the Atlantic, and ended with their giving up the whole of what was their only valuable territory in North America.\" \"She was utterly stripped of her American possessions, little more than a hamlet being left her in lower Louisiana.\" (Hinton's United States.)\n\n15\n\nThe Illinois country, after thus passing from France to England, was placed under the care of Captain Sterling, who was succeeded by Major Farmer, who in turn was succeeded by Colonel Reed in 1765, to which year the country was annexed to Canada. Reed was succeeded by Colonel Wilkins, whose administration was far more satisfactory than those of his predecessors.\n\nFew persons in America and still fewer in England supposed that this victorious peace of 1763 would soon be followed by war between the victors themselves, but it was. The lapse of thirteen years witnessed the opening of our war of the Revolution, and in 1783, just twenty years after the peace of 1763, England surrendered to her thirteen colonies on the Atlantic coast, well-nigh all she had claimed and fought for during almost two hundred years. The Canadians seemed to think they wanted no more war, or they felt less friendly toward their neighbors than toward their distant rulers. Be that as it may, the peace of 1783 took the whole Illinois country out of what had been, under the French, alternately a part of Canada and a part of Louisiana.\n\nBare reference can only be made to the campaign of General George Rogers Clark, whom Virginia in 1778 had sent into the Illinois country, and thereby laid the foundation for the claim she subsequently asserted, that the country was hers by conquest as well as by virtue of those sea-to-sea grants. She had by her act of December 17, 1778, organized the territory and called it the County of Illinois, for which reason it has been spoken of as the mother county of all the counties in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In another part of the book, giving an account of \"Fort Jefferson,\" we give a letter of General Clark to Governor Jefferson, written September 23, 1779.\n\nThe colonies no longer fearing the French or the English, turned their attention to the question of the ownership of the Illinois country; and now arose a territorial dispute between them which constitutes one of the most interesting parts of our country's history. It is treated of and dwelt upon in so many histories and other works, that even partial enumeration of them is quite out of the question.\n\nHere, as in many other matters of those early days, Virginia was the chief actor and claimant. By the treaty of 1763, England had surrendered all of her claims to the territory west of the Mississippi. This gave a definite western boundary to those sea-to-sea grants under which Virginia claimed. But while she was willing that her southern boundary should be a straight east-and-west line, she desired her northern boundary to run northwestward after reaching the Ohio River. This gave her nearly the whole of the Illinois country. Those colonies without territorial possessions urged that the territories should be ceded to the General Government, because, they said, they had been won and secured by the common blood and treasure of all the colonies. Virginia, following New York, but not without saying New York had nothing to cede, ceded her Illinois country. She had long held out, insisting that if she ceded the northwest territory to the General Government, the latter\n\n16\n\nshould guarantee to her the territory she claimed south of the Ohio River—that is, Kentucky. This desire for such a guarantee seemed to cloud somewhat her claim or title to the territory north of the river. Her session was made March 1, 1784; and this was followed by the justly celebrated ordinance of July 13, 1787. The territory was divided by the act of May 7, 1800, and the western part called Indiana Territory. The eastern part, a little later on, namely, in 1802, was admitted into the Union as the State of Ohio. The Indiana Territory was divided by the act of January 11, 1805, and the northern part called Michigan. It was again divided by the act of February 3, 1809, and the western part of it called Illinois, and the seat of government fixed \"at Kaskaskia on the Mississippi River.\"\n\nWe need not trace the history of the remainder of the northwest territory, which now embraces the State of Wisconsin and that part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River.\n\nWe have thus passed rapidly over the history of the Illinois country. From the Virginia charter of May 23, 1609, to the act of Congress, February 3, 1809, organizing Illinois territory, we have the long period of two hundred years.\n\nThe same form of territorial government provided for by the ordinance of 1787 was extended in turn to the territories of Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois by those acts of Congress of 1800, 1805, and 1809. It provided for a Governor, a Secretary of the territory, and three Judges to hold the territorial court; and when the territory was found to contain five thousand free male inhabitants, they were to have a general assembly, to consist of the Governor, the legislative council of five members, and a house of representatives of one member for each five hundred free male inhabitants. It will thus be seen that there were two forms or grades of government provided for the territory. In the first form or grade, the Governor and the three Judges were, from time to time, to adopt, publish, and report to Congress such of the laws of the original states as they deemed suited to the condition of the territory, and these laws were to continue in force, unless disapproved of by Congress, until the organization of the general assembly; and this carried the territorial government into the second grade. The five members of the legislative council were to be selected by Congress out of the ten persons nominated by the territorial house of representatives. It is worthy of notice that this celebrated ordinance prescribed certain property qualifications for the holding of offices in the territory. The Governor was required to have a freehold estate in one thousand acres of land, the Secretary of the territory, the three Judges, and the members of the legislative council, in five hundred acres, and the members of the house of representatives were to be the owners in fee of two hundred acres of land within the territory; and an elector of a representative was required to have a freehold estate in fifty acres. The act of Congress of May 20, 1812, further modified the ordinance by requiring the members of the\n\n17\n\ncouncil to be elected by the people; and for this purpose the Governor was directed to divide the territory into five districts, in each of which one member was to be chosen. Voters were required to be taxpayers, not real estate owners. The act limited the number of representatives to not less than seven nor more than twelve, until there should be six thousand free male inhabitants above the age of twenty-one years in the territory, from which time the government was to proceed according to the original ordinance.\n\n18\n\nChapter II — Early French Explorers and Missionary Priests.\n\nTHOUGH so often told, and now getting to be somewhat of an old story, it seems somehow naturally to fall into line with every account of places and points on the Mississippi River; and hence we beg to be allowed to refer briefly to some of the old French explorers.\n\nM. Louis Joliet and Father Jacques Marquette, commissioned to accompany him, left the Mission of St. Ignace, May 17, 1673, to find the Mississippi and especially to find into what body of water it flowed. They crossed the lake and entered Green Bay, ascended Fox River, made the portage to the Wisconsin, and passing down that river reached the Mississippi June 17, 1673. Some of the incidents of this voyage on the great river were, their friendly reception by the Indians; their passage of the mouth of the Missouri, whose rushing waters filled them with wonder and some of them with fear; their pause, about July 1st, at the mouth of the Ouabache (Ohio) to reflect that the river was long and came from the country of the Iroquois; their arrival at the mouth of the Arkansas, where they became satisfied the great stream did not flow into the Gulf of California, but into the Gulf of Mexico; their return, July 17th, up the river and their passage again of the mouth of the Ohio about August 1st; and their arrival at Kaskaskia on the Illinois the latter part of that month. Joliet was the leader, intent on discoveries, intent on finding things; Marquette, the chronicler, the observer, the missionary, writing much about the Indians and their superstitions.\n\nFather Louis Hennepin has been doubted, from time to time, by a number of writers, some of whom have found themselves in error and acknowledged the same. It would be quite out of place to enter into a controversy here and show why we should omit what he claims to have seen or discovered. We give two or three short extracts:\n\n\"The next day, being the 10th of March, 1660, we came to a river within forty leagues of the Tamaroa; near which, as the Illinois inform us, there is a nation of savages called Ouadebache. We remained until the 14th, because one of our men killed a wild cow as she was swimming over the river, whose flesh we were obliged to dry with smoke to preserve it. Being thus provided with Indian corn and flesh, we left that place the 14th, and saw nothing worth observation. The banks of the river are so muddy and so full of rushes and reeds, that we had much to do to find a place to go ashore.\n\n\"They, the Indians, called Sicacha or Chickasas, offered to go and\n\n19\n\nsettle themselves upon the river Ouabache to be near Fort Crevecoeur in the country of Illinois, whither they are traveling. This famous river of the Ouabache is fully as large as Meschasipi. A great many other rivers run into it. The outlet where it discharges itself into the Meschasipi is two hundred leagues from the Akansa, according to M. de La Salle's computation. The truth is, it is not so far, across the country, but it may be as much in following the course of the river Meschasipi, which winds about very much. Start over land it is not above five good days' journey. They crossed the river Ouabache August 26, 1687, and found it full sixty leagues along the river Meschasipi to the mouth of the river Illinois.\"\n\nWe are told to beware of Baron de La Hontan quite as much if not more than of Father Hennepin; but we must give the little he says about the Ohio river:—\n\n\"After we had spent two days with them, we pursued our voyage to the River Ouabache, taking care to watch the Crocodiles very narrowly, of which they had told us incredible Stories. The next day we enter'd the Mouth of that River, and sounded it, to try the truth of what the Savages reported of its depth. In effect, we found three Fathoms and a half of Water; but the Savages of our Company alledg'd that 'twas more swell'd than usually. They all agreed that 'twas Navigable an hundred Leagues up, and I wish'd heartily that my time had allow'd me to run up to its Source; but that being unreasonable, I sail'd up against the Stream, till we came to the River of the Illinese, which we made on the 9th of April with some difficulty, for the Wind was against us the first two days, and the Currents was very rapid.\"\n\nThis was in 1689. (See Thwaites' La Hontan's Voyages, Vol. I, p. 205).\n\nCavelier de La Salle, who, it seems in 1669, four years earlier, had gone as far southward as the Ohio River at the falls, was more interested in the story of the journey of Joliet and Marquette than any one else. It seemed strange to him that they had stopped short of the gulf, but he was thankful for it, no doubt. The deterrent effect of the stories of Indians on the lower Mississippi aroused in him few and slight fears. It was an opportunity not to be lost, an opportunity furnished by others, who should have taken it themselves.\n\nLa Salle, with Tonti and Membre, left Fort Miami, near where St. Joseph, Michigan, now stands, December 21, 1681, crossed the lake to the Chicago River, and, loading their canoes and baggage on sleds they there made, worked their way on land and frozen rivers down to a point at or below Lake Peoria, and from thence proceeded by water, and on the 6th of February, 1682, they rowed out upon the Mississippi. They were detained at the mouth of the Missouri by the floating ice until February 15th when they proceeded on their journey. They reached the mouth of the Ohio about February 20th, the bluffs north of Memphis the 24th, and the Gulf April 9, 1682. There they erected the standards\n\n20\n\nof Louis XIV and of the Church, and proclaimed the whole country of the great valley part of the dominions of the great French king.\n\nJoutel, writing after the death of La Salle, speaks as follows of the Ohio:—\n\n\"The 19th of August (1687), came to the mouth of the river, called Houabache, said to come from the country of the Iroquois toward New England. That is a very fine river. Its waters are extraordinary clear and the current of it gentle. Our Indians offered up to it, by way of sacrifice, some tobacco and beefstakes, which they fixed on forks and left them on the bank, to be disposed of as the river saw fit.\"\n\nFather Jean François de St. Cosme, a Canadian Seminarian Priest, writing to the Bishop of Quebec, speaks of this place as follows:—\n\n\"We left Cape St. Antoine (Grand Tower) on the 14th of December (1699), and on the 15th, we halted for the night one league below the Wabache (Ohio), a large and beautiful river, which is on the left of the Mississippi and comes from towards the north, and is, they say, five hundred leagues long, and rises near the Sonontuans (Senecas). They go by this river to the Chananous (Shawnees) who traded with the English. On the 16th we started from the Wabache and nothing special befell us nor did we find anything remarkable until we reached the Acansias (Arkansas).\"\n\nFather Jacques Gravier left Michilimackinac September 8, 1700. His journey was by the Illinois and the Mississippi, and with his canoes and companions he reached the mouth of the Ohio about October 15, 1700. Here they were detained by the illness of one or two of their number until October 16th, when they resumed their voyage to the Gulf. While here Father Gravier was chiefly concerned about the illness of his companions, who seemed to have been taken with what the Father called the tertian fever, a fever coming on every third day, and for this severe disease he relates how he discovered a most excellent remedy. He says little about the two rivers or their junction, but like the few others who had preceded him, he looked forward anxiously to what was still to be found ahead of him. One point is reached only to arouse concern as to what is to be seen or met with further on. His account should be read, first to see his care for the Indians, who were then leaving their loved home on the Illinois for their new one on the Mississippi, where they established the second Kaskaskia, and, second, for the description of the wild game they saw and some of which they killed here and there. He speaks of the bears, and says those along the Mississippi were lean and those of and from the Ohio were fat, and that all of them seemed to be moving from the south to the north. The day they reached here they saw fifty of them, only four of which they killed—all they needed. It is interesting to read the whole account, found in Vol. LXV, Jesuit Relations, pp. 105-111. Of his remedy for the tertian fever, he says: \"I found an excellent remedy for curing\n\n21\n\nour French of their fever. A small piece of Father François Regis' hat, which one of our servants gave me, is the most infallible remedy that I know of for all kinds of fever.\" He speaks also of the fine weather. It was about the middle of the month of October, 1700. October is, perhaps, the finest month of our year.\n\nSieur Charles Juchereau de St. Denis, of France, and afterwards of Canada, obtained a concession from his government, and came hither with thirty other Frenchmen, in about the year 1702, and built a fort and a tannery here or within a few miles of the junction of the rivers. Pontchartrain had sought the establishment of a fort and post at this point. The French on the lower Mississippi claimed jurisdiction over everything adjoining that river on the east, throughout its entire length. Juchereau was, in modern phrase, a business Frenchman and prosecuted trade in this region with diligence and enterprise. The Canadian French were not friendly to his pursuits in this latitude. They wanted everything in the Illinois country made tributary to their St. Lawrence course of trade and traffic. The country here must have been swarming with buffaloes; for in the course of a year or two, Juchereau and his thirty Frenchmen had killed and skinned thirteen thousand of them and had their skins in store and ready for shipment. What a time they must have had hunting in this region! The country abounded in game of all kinds besides buffaloes. Think of the bears, the deer, the turkeys, the geese and ducks, and many other kinds of game. Father Gravier, in 1700, said the bears on the Mississippi were lean, but those on the Ohio were fat and well favored. Juchereau no doubt came down this far to be on the Wabash (Ohio) as well as on the Mississippi. They hunted in all three of these states, over in Ballard County (Ky.), Mississippi County (Mo.), and in our own Alexander County, and much further and in all directions. There were no game laws. No licenses were required nor descriptions of the hunters, and all seasons were hunting seasons. They were probably located on the little river north of us, and it is altogether probable they gave it the name of Cache. This name, Cache River, appears on an old map of 1755, but it no doubt bore that name long before it obtained a place on any one's map. The Indians did not give the river one of their names. The French named it, and if there is any truth in the statements of numerous historical writers as to Juchereau, and his fort and tannery, his buffaloes and buffalo skins, it is highly probable our little river received its name from him.\n\nBut Juchereau was not permitted to enjoy the fruits of his labors and self-imposed exile here in the wilds of North America. The Indians were here, too, as well as abundant game. They waited until Juchereau had accumulated a large stock and store of skins and furs, of every kind and description, and selecting a convenient occasion and with united forces, they made an attack upon him and his men and killed almost all of them and seized the whole of their valuable collections. Juchereau himself escaped and reached Kaskaskia, then but recently established,\n\n22\n\nwhere it is said he died in 1705. The news of what had befallen him was carried to all parts of New France. It reached Mobile and all the southern country and much was said about expeditions to the Wabash to check, if possible, the depredations of the Indians.\n\nIn another part of the book is a list of the old maps showing a fort at this place. One rather peculiar feature of the matter is that one or two of the old maps made some years before Juchereau came here show a fort on the point between the rivers.\n\nFather Gabriel Marest wrote from \"Cascaskias, November 9,\" 1712, to Father Germon as follows:—\n\n\"About eighty leagues below, on the side of the river Illinois, that is to say, on the eastern side, (for the general course of the Mississippi is from north to south), is the mouth of again another fine river called Ouabache. It comes from the east-northeast and has three branches, one of which extends to the country of the Iroquois, another towards Virginia and Carolina, and the third even to the Miamis. It is said that silver mines have been found there. This, however, is certain, that there are in that country mines of lead and tin, and should some miners by profession come to make excavations in these lands, they might perhaps find mines of copper and other metals.\n\n\"Besides these large rivers which water the country to such an extent, there are also a great number of those which are smaller. It is on one of these rivers that our village is situated, on the eastern side, between the rivers Ouabache and Pekitanoui (Missouri). We are in the 38th degree of latitude. Large numbers of buffaloes and bears can be seen, which feed on the banks of the river Ouabache. The flesh of the young bears is a very delicate meat.\"\n\nFather Xavier de Charlevoix's journey was from Quebec, via Montreal, Niagara, Erie, Detroit, Michilimackinac and Lake Michigan to St. Joseph, thence a portage to the Kankakee, thence by the Illinois and the Mississippi to Kaskaskia. Here at \"Kaskasquias,\" October 20, 1721, he writes as follows:—\n\n\"The 10th of October, about nine in the morning, after we had gone five leagues on the Mississippi, we arrived at the mouth of the Missouri, which is north northward and south southeast. I believe this is the finest confluence in the world. The two rivers are much of the same breadth, each about a half league; but the Missouri is by far the most rapid, and seems to enter the Mississippi like a conqueror, through which it carries its white waters to the opposite shore without mixing them. Afterwards it gives its color to the Mississippi, which it never loses again, but carries it on down to the sea.\n\n\"It was about the 10th of November, at sun set, that I embarked on the little river of Kaskaskia. I had but two leagues to the Mississippi; nevertheless, I was obliged to encamp at about half way; and the next day I could make but six leagues on the river.\n\n\"The 15th, the wind changed to the north and the cold increased. We went four leagues to the south; then we found that the river\n\n23\n\nturned four leagues to the north. Immediately after this reach, we passed on the left by the river Ouabache, by which one may go on up to the Iroquois when the waters are high. Its entrance into the Mississippi is a little less than a quarter of a league wide. There is no place in Louisiana more fit, in my opinion, for a settlement than this, nor where it is of more consequence to have one. All the country that is watered by the Ouabache (Ohio) and by the Ohio (Wabash) that runs into it, is very fruitful. It consists of vast meadows, well watered, where the wild buffaloes feed by thousands. Furthermore, the communication with Canada is as easy as by the river of the Illinois, and the way much shorter. A fort with a good garrison would keep the savages in awe, especially the Cherokees, who are at present the most numerous nation of this continent.\"\n\nAccompanying Charlevoix's journal is a map, upon which is found a mark or X on the point between the two rivers, and the words, \"A ruined old fort.\"\n\nFather Vivier, in a lengthy letter of November 17, 1750, written no doubt at Kaskaskia, and to another Father of the Society of Jesus, spoke of the need of a fort at this place as follows:—\n\n\"The distance from the Akansas to the Illinois is nearly one hundred and fifty leagues; through all that extent of country there is not a single settlement. Nevertheless, to ensure us its possession, it would be well if we had a good fort upon the Ouabache, the only place where the English can enter the Mississippi.\"\n\nBefore getting too far along, let me note here how this immediate region of country was dealt with a century or more ago.\n\nILLINOIS LAND COMPANY OF 1773.—\"On the 5th of July, 1773, at a public council held at the village of Kaskaskia, an association of English traders and merchants, who styled themselves, ‘the Illinois Land Company,’ obtained from ten chiefs of the Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Peoria tribes, a deed for two very large tracts of land on the east side of the river Mississippi. The first tract was bounded thus: ‘Beginning at the mouth of the Huron creek, called by the French the river of Mary, being about a league below the mouth of the Kaskaskia river; thence a northward of east course, in a direct line back to the Hilly Plains, eight leagues, or thereabouts, be the same more or less; thence, the same course, in a direct line to the Crabtree Plains, seventeen leagues, or thereabouts, be the same more or less; thence, the same course, in a direct line to a remarkable place, known by the name of the Big Buffalo Hoofs, seventeen leagues, or thereabouts, be the same more or less; thence, the same course, in a direct line to the Salt Lick creek, about seven leagues, be the same more or less; thence, crossing the said creek, about one league below the ancient Shawanees town, in an easterly or a little to the north of east course, in a direct line to the river Ohio, about four leagues, be the same more or less; then down the Ohio, by the several courses thereof, until it empties itself into the Mississippi, about thirty-five leagues, be the same more or less; and then up the Mississippi, by the several courses thereof to the place of beginning, thirty-three leagues, or thereabouts, be the same more or less.’ The purchase of these territories was made for the Illinois Land Company, by a certain William Murray, who was then a trader in the Illinois country; and from the deed of conveyance it appears that the price which the Indians by agreement received, was two hundred and fifty blankets, two hundred and sixty strouds, three hundred and fifty shirts, one hundred and fifty pair of stroud and\n\n24\n\nhalf thick stockings, one hundred and fifty stroud breechcloths, five hundred pounds of gunpowder, four thousand pounds of lead, one gross of knives, thirty pounds of vermillion, two thousand gunflints, two hundred pounds of brasskettles, two hundred pounds of tobacco, three dozen gilt lookingglasses, one gross gun worms, two gross awls, one gross of firesteels, sixteen dozen of gartering, ten thousand pounds of flour, five hundred bushels of Indian corn, twelve horses, twelve horned cattle, twenty bushels of salt, twenty guns, and five shillings in money. The Indian deed was attested by ten persons, and recorded, on the 2d of September, 1773, in the office of a notary public at Kaskaskia.\"—Billon's History of Indiana, pages 102-104.\n\nSOLDIERS' RESERVATION! OF 1787.—By an act of congress under the articles of Confederation, dated October 22, 1787, a tract of land was \"reserved and set apart for the purpose of satisfying the military bounties due the late army,\" and the same was described as follows:\n\n\"Beginning at the mouth of the Ohio river; thence up the Mississippi to the river Au Vause (Big Muddy); thence up the same until it meets a west line from the mouth of the little Wabash; thence easterly with the said west line to the great Wabash; thence down the same to the Ohio, and thence with the Ohio to the place of beginning.\"\n\nINDIAN RESERVATION OF 1803.—By the Indian treaty of August 13, 1803, made by William Henry Harrison and the Kaskaskia tribe of Indians, which tribe represented the remnants of the Mitchigamias, Cahokias and Tamarois, respectively, the following described territory was set apart to the said tribes—\n\n\"Beginning at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi; thence up the Ohio to the mouth of the Saline Creek, about twelve miles below the mouth of the Wabash; thence along the dividing ridge between the said creek and the Wabash until it comes to the general dividing ridge between the waters which fall into the Wabash and those which fall into the Kaskaskia river; and thence along the said ridge until it reaches the waters which fall into the Illinois river; thence in a direct course to the mouth of the Illinois river, and thence down the Mississippi to the beginning.\" Then follows the sixth article of the treaty, which is in the following words:—\"As long as the lands which have been ceded by this treaty shall continue to be the property of the United States, the said tribe shall have the privilege of living and hunting upon them in the same manner as they have hitherto done.\" This treaty is an exceedingly interesting one, considered in the light of what had already taken place and what followed its conclusion, concerning the Indians.\n\nI need scarcely say that almost all of the foregoing quotations in this chapter are from Thwaites' Jesuit Relations. I have consulted also the following named authors and have also quoted from some of them here and elsewhere:—Bancroft, Parkman, Winsor, Shea, Hinsdale, Spears, and others writing of the Valley of the Mississippi. I may here also state that I have had occasion to consult many state histories, among them Edwards, Reynolds, Ford, Breese, Davidson and Stuvé, Blancherd, Moses, Lusk, Dillon's Indiana, Collins' Kentucky, Houck's Missouri, and English's Conquest of the Northwest. Much that I have said, not of a strictly local nature, pertains to such general history of the country that citation of authors or other bibliographical reference seems almost out of place.\n\n25\n\nChapter III — The Illinois Territorial Government.\n\nIT would be interesting to stop here and speak of the contest in and out of congress to prevent the division of the Indiana territory and the organization of the territory of Illinois, and of the public men who lost or won in the heated controversy; but space will not admit of this being done.\n\nPresident Madison, March 7, 1809, appointed Nathaniel Pope, of the territory of Louisiana, the secretary of the territory; and April 24th, he appointed Ninian Edwards, of Kentucky, governor of the territory. The governor and the judges promulgated thirteen laws in 1809, twelve in 1810, and five in 1811. March 14, 1812, he ordered an election to be held the second day of April to enable the people to express their preference as to whether the government should pass from the first to the second grade; and the vote resulting in favor of the change, on the 14th of September, he ordered an election to be held October 8th, 9th and 10th, for the purpose of choosing a delegate to congress, members of the legislative council and representatives to the general assembly, of the territory. Shadrack Bond was chosen delegate to congress, Pierre Menard, Benjamin Talbot, William Biggs, Samuel Judy, and Thomas Ferguson, members of the legislative council, and George Fisher, Alexander Wilson, Philip Trammel, John Grammer, Joshua Oglesby, Jacob Short, and William Jones, members of the territorial house of representatives. Menard became president of the council and John Thomas its secretary; George Fisher became speaker of the house and William C. Greenup its clerk. The first territorial legislature or general assembly convened at Kaskaskia November 25, 1812, and continued in session thirty-two days and enacted thirty-seven laws. The salary of the Attorney General, B. M. Piatt, was $175 per annum; those of the Auditor, H. H. Maxwell, and of the Treasurer, John Thomas, were $150 each. The pay of the members of the legislature was $2.00 per day. The second session of this assembly convened November 8, 1813, and enacted thirteen laws, among them one to prevent the sale of liquor to the Indians, and another to prevent the emigration of negroes and mulattoes into the territory.\n\nThe second territorial legislature convened on the 14th of November, 1814. It made a contract with Nathaniel Pope for revising the laws or the territory. It also passed an act for the incorporation of Shawneetown, and an act authorizing the payment of $50.00 for every hostile Indian killed. On the 24th of December, it adjourned until September\n\n26\n\n4, 1815. Re-assembling, it continued in session thirty-nine days and enacted thirty-eight laws, one of which was to tax billiard tables $150 per annum; another to punish counterfeiters of bank bills by fining and whipping, and if they were unable to pay the fines, they were to be sold by the sheriff at public sale to satisfy the judgments. The third legislature sat from December 2, 1816, to January 14, 1817, and then took a recess to December 1st. It enacted twenty-eight laws at that session. One was to establish a bank at Shawneetown with a capital of $300,000. Indiana had prohibited non-resident lawyers from practicing in their courts; and in retaliation, this legislature passed an act imposing a fine of $200.00 upon any Indiana lawyer found practicing in the territory, and a fine of $500.00 against the judge who knowingly allowed the Indiana lawyer to practice in his court. At this time there was no very friendly feeling between the people of the two territories because of the contest concerning the division of the territory of Indiana. The second session convened December 1st, and enacted fifty laws, among them the only law it ever enacted relating to Cairo, the act to incorporate the City and Bank of Cairo. It passed both houses of the legislature and was approved by the Governor January 9, 1818. The final adjournment of the legislature took place January 12, 1818, three days after the enactment of this law concerning Cairo. The state was admitted into the Union December 3, 1818.\n\nThe map of Illinois of 1822, by H. S. Tanner, Philadelphia, found at the beginning of Chapter I, shows very well the advancement of the state at about the time of its admission into the Union.\n\nWe have thus given considerable space to our Illinois territorial government, extending from February 3, 1809, to December 3, 1818, a period of nine years and ten months. It is a meager outline, but it shows something of the general condition of what is now our part of the state, which was indeed about all there was then of it. In 1809, her population was about 11,000 and in 1818 it had increased to nearly 50,000. The territory had become the third state of the five states contemplated by the ordinance of 1787.\n\nWe cannot take leave of this subject without some suitable reference to Kaskaskia.\n\nCairo owes it existence chiefly to Kaskaskia men. Let me name some of them: Shadrack Bond, Elias Kent Kane, Henry S. Dodge, Michael Jones, Warren Brown, Edward Humphrys, Sidney Breese, David J. Baker, and Miles A. Gilbert. All that was done for and about Cairo, in 1817 and in 1818, was done at Kaskaskia; and the very first movement toward a second attempt to build a city here was started at Kaskaskia in 1835 and 1836, and chiefly by Breese, Baker and Gilbert. Kaskaskia was the seat of almost all of the earlier operations of the Cairo City and Canal Company, although its directors met now and then at Alton. That company's banking operations under the act of January 9, 1818, were carried on there and as late as 1839,\n\n27\n\n1840 and 1841. The Bank of Cairo, under said act, issued its notes there which recited on their face that they were issued at Kaskaskia. See two of its bank bills on another page.\n\nBut we must not say more about Kaskaskia, about which so much has been said and written. One volume could not contain it; for of and concerning it, Frenchmen, Englishmen and Americans have told their stories. Like the Indian tribe, from which it took its name, it has quite ceased to exist. The abrading waters of the great river, near to which it stood so long, cared quite as little for the Frenchmen and the Englishmen as for the Indian, and the old French post and town, standing midway between Quebec and New Orleans, is now scarcely more than a mere landmark in the center of a nation of almost one hundred millions of people. It was one of the goals of the adventurers, explorers, and missionary priests on their long and slow journeys between those distant French cities. It was indeed a resting-place, and the society and customs, the religion and amusements, they there found were to them like a return to their own beloved France. It was civilized existence again, darkly shaded, it may be, by the aboriginal life that everywhere breathed over the face of the vast country. But to those who dwelt there, and perhaps more to the sojourners for a time, the shadow of Indian life served only to brighten by contrast the short and narrow strip of country which there skirted the great river.\n\nIn the examination of our real-estate and court records here in Cairo, I have found Nathaniel Pope's name so often mentioned, that I trust it will not be regarded as entirely out of place to devote a page or two to this able man.\n\nHe was born in Louisville in 1774; resided at St. Genevieve for a while, and in the year 1808 removed to Kaskaskia; became the first secretary of the territory; was the territory's delegate in congress from 1816 to 1818; was the first United States judge in the state and held the position to the time of his death, which occurred at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Yeatman, at St. Louis, January 23, 1850. General Pope of the late Civil War was a son of the former. Judge Pope is well known as the compiler of an edition of our statutes.\n\nWe make this reference to Judge Pope chiefly to show that to him the people of the state are indebted for the extension of the state's northern boundary some sixty miles north of the southern extremity of Lake Michigan. The 5th article of the ordinance of 1787 bounded our state, or the third of the proposed states, by the Mississippi, Ohio and Wabash rivers and by a line from the Wabash to the north boundary line of the territory and made its north boundary line \"an east and west line drawn through the southern bend or extremity of Lake Michigan.\"\n\nWhen the territorial government applied for admission into the Union, Pope saw that the new state was to be shut out from the great lake, and hence he determined to do what he could to have congress extend the north boundary line of the state some distance further northward and thereby secure to the state the great commercial advantages which\n\n28\n\nhe was sure the lake would afford it. This desire and effort led to much controversy and engendered much bad feeling. The ordinance, like many other great instruments after it, was called a compact between the states and beyond the reach of congress, just as it was afterwards urged that the 6th article of the ordinance relating to slavery was a compact; but congress believed it was not bound by the lines described in the ordinance, and accordingly extended the north line of the state northward to the latitude of 42 degrees and 30 minutes, or for the distance of about 60 miles. It added about four millions and a half acres of the finest land to Illinois. Wisconsin was not a state then; but its people to this day regard that act of congress as a most flagrant breach of law and justice.\n\nPrior to 1818, there were on the north bank of the Ohio, from the mouth of the Tennessee to the mouth of the Ohio, four or five small settlements, villages or clusters of houses, bearing the following names, Trinity, America, Caledonia, Napoleon and Wilkinsonville, and last of all Fort Massac. Trinity, America, Napoleon and Wilkinsonville have long since ceased to exist, and now few persons are living who remember anything about them. Dr. Reuben Gold Thwaites, in the year 1894, made a trip down the Ohio from Pittsburg to Cairo, described in his \"On the Storied Ohio\" and stopped at what was once the place or site of Wilkinsonville. It was named after General James Wilkinson, whom history connects closely with Col. Aaron Burr's scheme or supposed scheme to set up a separate government in the southwest. Dr. Thwaites took occasion to remark that he found no one in the vicinity of the old site who had ever heard of Wilkinsonville. He stopped there but a few hours, we suppose, and could have seen but a very few persons; but had he talked with many he would probably have found no one who could have told him much about the old post. Still it is somewhat remarkable; for Wilkinsonville is found in almost all of the old maps and gazetteers and in all of the Ohio River guides up to 1838 and probably later. Burr passed there in 1805, and again December 31, 1806. President Jefferson, in a message to the senate and house, January 28, 1807, informed them that Burr had passed Fort Massac December 31st with ten boats navigated by six men each. Burr and his boats and men passed this point no doubt on the first day of January, 1807. He left them somewhere down the river in the state of Mississippi and sought to escape; but he failed in this and was arrested and taken to Richmond and there tried for treason and acquitted.\n\nGeneral Jackson with fifteen hundred men in boats left Nashville on the 10th day of January, 1813, and reached here January 27th, where they were detained three days by ice in the Mississippi. His men were Tennesseeans and Kentuckians chiefly, and all of them riflemen by long practice as hunters. The rivers were then low. Game of all kinds abounded on the point here and in Kentucky and Missouri. Jackson always maintained excellent discipline, but he also knew very well there was such a thing as too much strictness with troops like\n\n29\n\nthose freedom-loving hunters of the two states mentioned; and there is no doubt but that during their three days' stay here the sharp crack of the rifle was heard everywhere over the point and across the river in Kentucky and that their camps here or over there were bountifully supplied with game.\n\nBut Indians were here also. This part of the state had been set apart to them by the Indian treaty of August 13, 1803. Most of them had gone from these parts of the country, but now and then bands of them passed through the country and often their movements were attended with the severest cruelties to the people of the settlements which lay in the line of their travels. One of their most atrocious deeds took place on the Ohio just south of Cache River, where old Trinity was soon thereafter established. It was on the 9th day of February, 1813, that ten Indians, coming along the Ohio from the Wabash country, reached the three or four families resident just south of Cache River. They represented themselves as friendly to the white settlers and were kindly received and given the food they desired. Seeing that they were stronger than the few settlers there and the latter suspecting nothing, they suddenly made an attack upon them and cruelly murdered in the most inhuman manner five or six of them. One or two of the white men escaped, and the Indians, fearing that others might soon come to the relief of the settlers, hurried away, although a very considerable number of persons assembled for their capture; but they crossed the river and escaped from their pursuers. For some little time before this and a few years afterwards such occurrences were not infrequent in the Illinois territory. One of the most notable was the Fort Dearborn massacre of August 15, 1812.\n\nWe mention these events to show something of the condition of the country just preceding the admission of the state into the Union and the commencement of the work of establishing a city here at this place.\n\n30\n\nChapter IV — The City of Cairo of 1818.\n\nTHE act of Congress of May 18, 1796, provided for the appointment of a surveyor general, and prescribed fully how surveys of the public lands should be made and for the sale thereof at not less than $2.00 an acre. This price continued until its reduction to $1.25 an acre by the act of April 24, 1820, which discontinued sales on credit. Rufus Putnam was the first surveyor general and held the office from 1797 to 1803. Jared Mansfield succeeded him and filled the position from 1803 to 1813. He was succeeded by William Rector, who held the position from 1813 to 1824. In 1807, Mansfield, in pursuance of the said act, contracted with Archie Henry, a deputy surveyor, for the survey of our township Seventeen South, Range One, West of the Third Principal Meridian, and Henry surveyed it that year and reported the acreage at 6288.08 acres or something more than one-fourth of a full township, which contains 23,040 acres. Henry also surveyed the township next north of us and the one east of that, but in the year 1810. It is interesting to look at these old surveys of one hundred years ago as they were then mapped or platted, and to see how the river boundaries now compare with the old river boundaries as then given. William Rector surveyed Township Sixteen, Range Two, West, and he also surveyed and platted those four hundred acre tracts of land on the Mississippi, known long years ago as the Flannary, McElmurry and Standlee tracts. To these tracts of land reference will be more fully made hereafter.\n\nTHE THIRD PRINCIPAL MERIDIAN.—Our system of land surveys, sometimes called the Rectangular System, was first authorized by an act or ordinance of congress, under the articles of the Confederation, of the date of May 20, 1785. It is not known who planned or devised the system, but the members of the committee which reported the act were Jefferson, Williamson, Howell, Gerry and Reas. The act was amended in some particulars but chiefly by the act of May 18, 1796, which prescribed fully, as above stated, how the surveys of the public lands should be made. Meridian and base lines were established in pursuance of the above acts. The first principal meridian is the dividing-line between Ohio and Indiana; the second starts at the mouth of Little Blue River in Indiana and coincides with longitude 86° 28'; the third starts at the mouth of the Ohio and coincides with longitude 89° 10' 30\", and the fourth starts at the mouth of the Illinois River and coincides with longitude 90° 29' 56\".\n\n31\n\nThis third principal meridian may be said to start at the middle of the Mississippi River and pass northward about six or seven hundred feet east of the Halliday Hotel, leaving probably fifty to seventy-five acres of land lying east of the line and below the Halliday. It crosses the Ohio River, cutting some fifty to seventy-five acres off Kentucky near the Illinois Central railroad bridge; and again crossing the Ohio, it passess a little west of Mound City and on northward, through or near to Carbondale, Centralia, Decatur, Bloomington and Rockford, and reaches the Wisconsin line about eighty miles west of Chicago. This meridian very nearly divides equally the territorial area of the state. The base line from which the townships are numbered north and south passes across the state a few miles south of Centralia. From that line southward and adjoining the meridian on the west are seventeen townships. The seventeenth, or last one, is the one in which the City of Cairo is situated; and from that base line northward and on the same side of the meridian, are forty-six townships, the forty-sixth, or last one, having for its north line the south line of the state of Wisconsin. We thus see that there is, from Cairo to the Wisconsin line, a line of sixty-three townships, each six miles square, making the distance from the center line of the Mississippi River, Cairo's boundary on the south, to the Wisconsin line, three hundred and seventy-eight miles. This is, approximately, the actual distance.\n\nAlthough this township and others were surveyed and platted so early in the last century, the Indian titles had to be extinguished before the lands could be offered for sale. Kaskaskia was made a land office by the act of March 26, 1804.\n\nBy the treaty of September 25, 1818, made by Governor Ninian Edwards and Augustus Chouteau, with the Kaskaskia tribe of Indians, and also the Peorias, which latter tribe set up claim to the territory or to an interest therein, all Indian rights and titles were relinquished in the territory above described. Among the witnesses to this treaty is the name of Reuben H. Walworth, who afterwards became the great chancellor of the State of New York. By the act of May 10, 1800, sales of public lands were to be made upon the following terms:—One-fourth within forty days, one-fourth within two years, one-fourth within three years, and one-fourth within four years, after the sale or purchase; and in default for one year after the last payment became due, the land was to be sold at public sale, and if less than what was due was bid, the lands were to \"revert to the United States.\"\n\nBefore the formal and full extinguishment of the Indian titles by the treaty of September 25, 1818, namely, on the 26th and 28th days of July, 1817, John G. Comegys, of Baltimore, purchased at the land office at Kaskaskia, at which Michael Jones and Warren Brown were, respectively, the register and receiver, the South fractional halves of Sections Fourteen and Fifteen, fractional Sections Twenty-Two, Twenty-Three and Twenty-Four, the North fractional half of Section Twenty-Five, the North half of Section Twenty-Six, and the North East\n\n32\n\nfractional Quarter of Section Twenty-Seven, all in Township Seventeen South, range One West, and all amounting to Eighteen Hundred acres, \"or thereabouts.\" Comegys made the first two payments upon his purchases, and his executors made the third payment, and for default in the making of the last payment, the lands were, no doubt, offered for sale, and for want of purchasers for the amounts due, were forfeited and reverted to the United States. These lands were afterwards, namely, in August and September, 1835, again purchased and patents issued to the purchasers thereof, who were Sidney Breese, Miles A. Gilbert and Thomas Swanwick.\n\nVery little is now known concerning the correspondence, the conferences and other negotiations, which led up to the first attempt to establish a city here at the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Sufficient, however, is known to authenticate fully the following account of the undertaking.\n\nThe junction of the two rivers had long been looked upon as a geographical point of very great importance. Its commercial features, great as they were, were regarded as fully equaled by the advantages it possessed for a military post or center, commanding so fully a widely extended country eastward, westward, northward and southward. This was the view taken by the early explorers, and since their time, by every traveler and writer who has spoken or written about the place. The strong and often extravagant language used may be seen by reference to some of the old circulars issued by the proprietors from time to time. It is the language of those whom we, in these modern times, call promoters; but it is the language, also, of a great many men in nowise interested, and whose language the promoters merely quoted.\n\nBut while the geographical position fully justified all that was said of it, its topographical features were largely the reverse; so much so, indeed, that the local disadvantages seemed to outweigh the advantages of the geographical position. The difficulty was obvious enough; a great central position, great rivers coming together, draining an empire in extent, but almost annually claiming dominion over the intervening land they themselves had created. It was the product or output of the rivers, and very naturally could not anywhere have an elevation above that to which the rivers themselves rose. The commingling waters could lift nothing higher than themselves; but the process had gone on for centuries, and had not the hand of man intervened, it would have gone on, no doubt, until the \"made land\" would have risen well nigh as high as the high-water mark of recent years, and there would have been little need of protective embankments or levees. There is no telling, of course, what the shifting Mississippi might have done with the site it had so largely created; but excepting that contingency, every overflow would have added to the elevation of the land, and in time the same would have reached the high-water line of the present annual floods. But it is quite useless to conjecture, for that great river seems now quite as hard for us to know and comprehend as it was for the\n\n33\n\nIndians, who told Joliet and Marquette of the Manitous which here and there infested its waters.\n\nThe reasons for and against occupying the site were no doubt often considered. They were so equally balanced that nothing was done. But it was not thus to go on always; for the time came when a few men reached a working belief that the advantages overbalanced the disadvantages; and hence we are now brought to the time when the work of establishing a city here was actually entered upon.\n\nIt seems to have been left to John G. Comegys, from the distant state of Maryland and of the city of Baltimore, to conclude that there was more to justify than to forbid an attempt to start a city at the confluence of the two rivers. He must have been well known in St. Louis, for we find that he was one of the witnesses to the Indian treaty made at St. Louis, in the territory of Louisiana, August 31, 1809. This treaty was signed by Peter Chouteau, and one hundred and ten chiefs and warriors of the Great and Little Osage Nation of Indians. The title of the treaty is in these words.\n\nArticles of treaty; made and concluded at Fort Clark, on the right bank of the Missouri, about five miles above Fire Prairie, in the territory of Louisiana, the 10th day of November, in the year of our Lord, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Eight, between Peter Choteau, Esq., agent for the Osage, and specially commissioned and instructed to enter into the same by his excellency, Meriwether Lewis, Governor, and Superintendent of Indian affairs for the territory aforesaid, in behalf of the United States of America, of the one part, and the chiefs and warriors of the Great and Little Osage, for themselves and their nations, respectively, on the other part.\"\n\nWe make this quotation chiefly to show that Meriwether Lewis, of the celebrated Lewis & Clark expedition, was no doubt an acquaintance and friend of John G. Comegys. Confirmatory of this is the fact that at the sale of Comegys' personal effects by the executors of his will at Baltimore in 1819, two miniatures were sold, one that of Comegys, and the other having upon it the name \"M. Lewis.\"\n\nTHE ACT TO INCORPORATE THE CITY AND BANK OF CAIRO.—The incorporators named in this act of the territorial legislature, of January 9, 1818, were John G. Comegys, Thomas H. Harris, Thomas F. Herbert, Charles Slade, Shadrack Bond, Michael Jones, Warren Brown, Edward Humphreys and Charles W. Hunter. Comegys was a resident of Baltimore; Bond, Jones, Brown, and Humphreys, of Kaskaskia; Hunter of St. Louis; and Harris, Herbert and Slade, of Virginia, Harris of Richmond, and Slade and Herbert of Alexandria. We give here short biographical sketches of three or four of these men, commencing with Comegys who seems to have been the leader in the first attempt to establish a city here.\n\nJohn Gleaves Comegys was a native of Kent County, Maryland, across the bay from Baltimore. He was probably of German descent. The family resided near an arm of the bay into which Chester River runs, and in a region called \"Quaker Neck.\" He was a descendant of\n\n34\n\nCornelius Comegys, who, with his whole family and one Hans Hanson, was naturalized by a special act of the general assembly of Maryland in the year 1672, one year before Joliet and Marquette made their journey down the Mississippi and passed this point the last of June, 1673. He was probably a Quaker in early life. There is nothing in his will to show that he had ever been married. He seems to have come West very early in 1800; for he is shown to have been carrying on business in Baltimore and St. Louis some years before he applied for his Cairo charter in 1818. In a city directory of Baltimore for 1807, we find C. & J. Comegys, Merchants, No. 190 Baltimore Street; and in the directories for 1812, 1814 and 1816, we find Comegys & Falconer, Merchants, at the same number; and in the directories for 1818 and 1819 we find the same firm, Comegys & Falconer, Merchants, No. 8th St. Charles Street. In Billon's Annals of St. Louis, 1804-1821, page 112, under the heading of \"Business Notices,\" the firm name of Falconer & Comegys is given, and it is stated that they had just received, April 19, 1809, a general assortment of merchandise. On page 116, February 22, 1810, it is stated that the firm was closing out; and on page 118, it is further noted that the firm had been dissolved and that the style of the new firm would be J. G. Comegys & Company. Mr. Falconer, of Sixth Street, in our city, now deceased, was, no doubt, of the same family of Falconers of Maryland.\n\nThe day of his death is not given, but the will bears date January 23, 1819, and was probated February 9th, following. The probate of the will was just one year and a month after the granting of the Cairo charter to him and the other incorporators, January 9, 1818.\n\nThe incorporators named in the said act of January 9, 1818, lost no time in proceeding with their undertaking; and accordingly, upon the 14th day of that month they made a trust deed conveying to Henry S. Dodge and Elias K. Kane, of Kaskaskia, the same lands precisely as those described in the said act of the 9th of January. The grantors in the deed were Michael Jones, Shadrack Bond and Achsah Bond, his wife, Warren Brown and Edward Humphreys, all of Kaskaskia, in the territory of Illinois, John G. Comegys, of Baltimore, Thomas H. Harris, of Richmond, Virginia, Thomas F. Herbert and Charles Slade, of Alexandria, Virginia, Charles W. Hunter and Martha W. Hunter, his wife, of St. Louis, in the territory of Missouri. (See book A & B, pp. 121 to 126.)\n\nThe men above named were in and by the said trust deed associated together for the purpose of laying out the City of Cairo, and by the charter were given banking privileges. The deed itself is a very lengthy one. It would require fifteen or twenty pages of this book to give it in full. It seems to have been drawn with great care and with many of the details and repetitions found in the old instruments of a hundred years ago. It conveys the lands above described which are spoken of therein as eighteen hundred acres \"or thereabouts,\" and it recites that the Trustees accepted the trust, which required them to convey to the\n\n35\n\nPresident and Directors of the Bank of Cairo, provided for in the act of incorporation, so much of the said land as might be required to be divided into lots; and the said President and Directors were required to hold the land so conveyed to them in trust for the purchasers of lots. The incorporators reserved the right to survey and plat so much of the land as they deemed necessary, and the Trustees were to reconvey to them all lands not required to be conveyed to the said President and Board of Directors. An examination of the act of incorporation will show how important the banking features of the enterprise were regarded. It was, no doubt, supposed that the bank, by means of the provisions of the trust deed and other securities it might obtain, would be able to raise the necessary funds with which to construct protective embankments and otherwise improve the site of the proposed city.\n\nComegys and the persons associated with him, or some of them, no doubt, visited this point and became more or less familiar with its location and condition. He may have made a trip or two by steamboat from Pittsburg on his way from Baltimore to St. Louis. Steamboats had come into use on the two rivers a few years before that time. He had made many overland trips, no doubt, between Baltimore and St. Louis during the years 1805 to 1818. But whatever knowledge these men may have had of the site here, Comegys seems to have gone to Kaskaskia, or to have been there, on the 26th and 28th days of July, 1817; for on those days he made the purchase hereinbefore spoken of.\n\nHe and his associates had made these purchases as the first necessary step in their undertaking to establish a city here. Having obtained the land for a site, they seem to have lost no time in arranging to obtain legislative authority for doing what they could not well do without it. Their headquarters were Kaskaskia, the capital of the territory, and where the territorial legislature was to convene in the December of the year in which these purchases were made, the year 1817. As we have elsewhere already stated, this legislature, on the 9th day of January, 1818, enacted the first law that ever had any special reference to this place or point at the junction of the two rivers.\n\nA reference to the prospectus of the proprietors will show that their survey and plat of the city were made as the next and very necessary step in their undertaking. It seems that a Major Duncan did this work for them. The plat or map was lithographed in Baltimore early in 1818, by Cone & Freeman. According to this plat, city lots were offered for sale, if indeed any at all were offered, as recited in the very first lines of the prospectus. The map is an interesting one, indeed. The surveyor and maker of the map no doubt saw the plat and survey made by Arthur Henry in 1807. There may have been, however, another survey by the Government authorities prior to 1818. This is spoken of in one or two places. A copy of the map introduces this chapter. It will be seen that all the streets, except Ohio and Mississippi, run at right angles and are eighty feet wide. The blocks are divided by alleys running North and South; and between Delaware and Carolina Streets is a public square lying one-half north and one-half south of\n\n36\n\nMain Street. There are four markets, each occupying a full block; No. 1, bounded by Boon, Harris, Edward and Hunter; No. 2, by Connecticut, Harris, New York and Hunter; No. 3, by Louisiana, Madison, Indiana and Jefferson, and No. 4, by Connecticut, Madison, Choteau and Jefferson. There are 290 blocks. The blocks fronting on Ohio and Mississippi Streets are not rectangular like the others, but vary in shape and size as those streets follow the river lines. Each block contains sixteen lots, except the blocks between Humphreys and North Streets, which contain twenty lots each. The lots are 66 by 120 feet. There are 4032 lots, and the numbering is from the northwest corner on the Mississippi to the southeast corner on the Ohio. The names and lengths of the streets are as follows:\n\nEast and West streets:—South, Franklin, Monroe, Madison, Jefferson, Herbert, Brown, Adams, Main, Washington, Jones, Bond, Harris, Hunter, Slade, Humphreys and North. These seventeen East and West streets, running from river to river, vary somewhat in length, the shortest being 6100 feet and the longest, the most southern, 8400 feet. It will be observed that Comegys must have supervised the making of this plat or map; for eight of the streets bear the names of his eight co-incorporators under their act of January 9, 1818, but no street is given his own name. This circumstance exhibits a trait of Comegys' character that speaks for itself.\n\nThe North and South streets are: Orleans, on the extreme southeast; next, Clay, Clark, Piatt, Howard, Wirt, Choteau, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, Connecticut, Vermont, Delaware, Carolina, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Louisiana, Alabama, Michigan, Edwards, Boon, Breckinridge, Pope, Ames, and Short. These thirty North and South streets vary in length from 400 to 10,150 feet. Nine of them in the central part of the town, are each 10,150 feet or almost two miles. Then along the Mississippi River is Mississippi Street, along the Ohio River is Ohio Street, and they with South and North streets make one continuous street around the city of the length of seven miles.\n\nShadrack Bond is, of course, well known as the first Governor of the State, and little need be said of him here. He died at Kaskaskia April 12, 1832, and was there buried; but in 1881, the remains of himself and of his wife were removed to Chester, and the State there erected a monument inscribed as follows:\n\n\"In memory of Shadrack Bond,\n\nThe first Governor of the State of Illinois;\n\nBorn at Fredericktown, Maryland, November 24, A. D. 1778.\n\nDied at his residence near Kaskaskia, April 12, A. D. 1832.\n\nIn recognition of his valuable public services,\n\nthis monument was erected by the State A. D. 1883.\n\nGovernor Bond filled many offices of trust and importance,\n\nall with integrity and honor.\"\n\nGovernor Ford in his history says:—\"Bond was the delegate to Congress, and while there his portrait was painted by Gilbert Stuart. It is now in the Historical Library at Chicago.\" The picture of Governor Bond found elsewhere is from that painting.\n\n37\n\nCharles Slade was an Englishman, and came with his parents to Alexandria, Virginia. In 1816, he and his brothers, Richard and Thomas, came to Illinois and resided at or near what is now Carlyle, in Clinton County. He became a very prominent man in the politics of the State, and at the election for congressman in August, 1832, was the successful candidate. The opposing candidates were Governor Edwards, Sidney Breese, Charles Dunn, and Henry L. Webb. He took his seat in Congress in December, 1833, and upon its adjournment in March, 1834, after spending some months in the East, started home, but was taken ill of cholera, and died near Vincennes July 11, 1834. These few facts are taken from an excellent biographical sketch by Dr. John F. Snyder, of the Illinois State Historical Society. See pages 207 to 210, Publication No. 8, 1903, of the said Society.\n\nMichael Jones and Shadrack Bond were, respectively, the Register and Receiver at the Land Office at Kaskaskia, which was established by the act of Congress of March 26, 1804. Jones and E. Backus, the latter of whom was the Receiver there at an early date, passed upon the claims to lands and reported them for confirmation under the act of March 3, 1791. They investigated and reported favorably the claims of the Flannarys, the McElmurrays, and of Standlee to those tracts of land lying on the Mississippi River just below Sante Fe. The surveys are numbered 525, 526, 527, 528, 529, and 684 and the claims 529, 530, 531, 680, 681, and 2564. William Rector made the surveys and this is noted on the government plat of Township Sixteen, South, Three West of the Third Principal Meridian, made in 1810. Jones was adjutant of the Randolph County regiment in the war of 1812, and a member from Gallatin County of the Constitutional Convention that framed our constitution of 1818. He was a member also of the first State Legislature and, it seems, received a vote or two for United States senator.\n\nWarren Brown was also a Federal officer of Kaskaskia and a portion of the time the Receiver of Public Moneys there. The will of John G. Comegys recites the payment by Comegys to Brown, as Receiver of Public Moneys, upon his purchases of July 26 and 28, 1817. Edward Humphreys is spoken of by Governor Reynolds as a man of fine education and an excellent teacher. Charles W. Hunter was a resident of St. Louis. He seems to have dealt extensively in lands in southern Illinois, and our records at the court-house, both before and after 1820, show many conveyances to and from him. Of the other two incorporators, Thomas H. Harris and Thomas F. Herbert, we know very little. They and Slade had resided in Virginia.\n\nEllas Kent Kane, one of the two trustees in the trust deed of January 14, 1818, was a native of New York and a graduate of Yale College. From New York he went first to Carthage, Smith County, Tennessee, in 1813, and in the following year he removed to Kaskaskia. He was a\n\n38\n\nmember of the convention which framed our constitution of 1818. He is spoken of as the controlling spirit of that body, and it is said that many of its most important provisions and in general, the whole type and character of the instrument were due to him. He was our first Secretary of State, and was appointed by Governor Bond. He was for a time editor and publisher of the Republican Advocate at Kaskaskia. He was twice chosen United States senator and was a member of the senate at the time of the death of our other senator, John McLean, of Shawneetown; and in the congressional debates for the year 1829 will be found his short but very appropriate address upon the death of his colleague, which occurred October 14, 1829. Kane died while senator and at Washington, December 11, 1835. Quite a full biographical sketch of him by Col. George W. Smith, of Chicago, is found in the Report of the Illinois State Bar Association for 1895. Many notices of him are also to be found in the publications of the Illinois State Historical Society.\n\nHenry S. Dodge, the other trustee or commissioner in the said deed of trust of January 14, 1818, was also a lawyer, and a resident of Kaskaskia and a prominent public man. He was the father of Mrs. Helen K. Dodge Edwards, who was born at Kaskaskia in the year 1819, and who died on the 18th day of March, 1909, in her ninetieth year, at Springfield. She was the widow of Judge Benjamin S. Edwards, a son of Governor Ninian Edwards, who was long one of the most prominent men of Springfield and of the central part of Illinois.\n\n39\n\nChapter V — Cairo's Site and Place from 1818 to 1836.\n\nNOW taking leave of the City of Cairo of 1818, let us note some of the important events which took place in the state during this period, from 1818 to 1836.\n\nDuring that time the administrations of Governors Bond, Coles, Edwards, and Reynolds, and two years of Governor Duncan's term, had passed. The population of the state had increased from 55,211, in 1820, to about 325,000, in 1836. Alexander County was the first new county created by the legislature. It was established by the act of March 4, 1819. Fifty other counties were established during the period above mentioned. The county seat was, by the act of January 18, 1833, removed from America, on the Ohio River, to Unity. The population of the county in 1820 was 626 and in 1830 it was 1390. The attempt to make Illinois a slave state was made in the year 1826, under the administration of Governor Coles. A number of the men who had been interested in the first Cairo enterprise were very prominent in that celebrated contest. Some of them were on the one side and some of them on the other. During this period the Black Hawk War took place. The congressional grant to aid in the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal was made March 2, 1827, and on March 2, 1833, the state was authorized to substitute a railroad for the canal. At the end of this period, the state was worrying along with this canal enterprise. No railroads were built or undertaken. The first railroad company, the Chicago and Vincennes, was incorporated January 17, 1835; the second, the Jacksonville and Meredosia, February 5, 1835; and the third, the Belleville and Mississippi, December 28, 1835. Fifteen were incorporated in January, 1836. They were the Alton and Shawneetown, the Alton, Wabash and Erie, the Central Branch Wabash, the Galena and Chicago Union, the Illinois Central, the Mississippi, Springfield and Carrollton, the Mt. Carmel and Alton, the Pekin and Tremont, the Pekin, Bloomington and Wabash, the Rushville, the Shawneetown and Alton, the Wabash and Mississippi, the Wabash and Mississippi Union, the Warsaw, Peoria and Wabash, and the Waverly and Grand Prairie.\n\nContrary to what has often been claimed, Comegys and his associates never thought of an Illinois Central Railroad nor of any railroad at all. When they procured their charter January 9, 1818, there was not a railroad anywhere in the United States nor a charter for one. If there was one in England at that time, it would not there nor here be called a railroad now. They had tram roads there then, but it was not until 1825 that a locomotive engine was used to draw cars on a railway track; and it was four or five years later that the first railroad, a short one, was put in operation in this country.\n\n40\n\nThis period of eighteen years, so far as it relates to Cairo, is not a blank entirely, but it is so nearly one that little need be said of it. So little had been done under the Comegys charter of January 9, 1818, and the enterprise seemed so wholly abandoned, that public attention was withdrawn from the place as seemingly unworthy of further notice or attention. The great rivers came more and more into use, and the keelboats and flatboats were in a large degree superseded by steam vessels almost everywhere on the rivers; but as to Cairo, or what had been planned to be Cairo, it was a mere wood-yard, at which the steamboats would land to take on wood for their furnace fires, and then proceed on their journeys up or down the rivers. Besides these, there were trading boats, which, while trading very little at the point, found it a convenient place to stop for a time; for while there was no town here, or anything resembling one, the point was a central one, a kind of half-way house, at which one would tarry a while before starting out on a long river journey northward, eastward, or southward. As Major Long and his party, on their way to the Rocky Mountains in 1819, observed, the grandeur of the place fell short of what one would suppose or expect from the conjunction of two such mighty rivers, draining so much of the world's surface; but while, as they said, there was no high elevation from which one could view the approaching and uniting rivers, there was yet that strange but well-known feeling arising at the sight of the giant-like streams coming together and uniting their forces to march onward to the sea. It was the mouth of the Ohio River, an expression in daily use since the time of Joliet and Marquette. It was a great landmark, measuring off almost all river distances in one of the world's greatest valleys.\n\nThe failure of Cairo encouraged the people of Trinity and America to think they might profit by the supposed proof that no city could be built at the point. Especially was this the conclusion at America, which at once set up the claim that it was the head of navigation for the two great rivers. We speak of this somewhat fully in the chapter on Alexander County, and therefore merely mention it here. Settlements multiplied everywhere and grew larger and stronger. All fear of the Indians had passed away; but the remembrance of them long remained with the old settlers, who took real pleasure in recounting the trying and perilous times of the earlier days they remembered so well. In many cases, it had been burned into their memories, and it was a kind of relief to have occasion to tell about it. There was little to read. The mails were like angels' visits, and neighbors were few and widely separated. The Indian was therefore made the subject of conversation to pass away the long winter evenings; and in this way many traditions had their origins. They are almost all gone now. The children's children of the first narrators have all gone their way, and those of the later generations have had so much to learn and know that there remain to us now only the pages of history.\n\n41\n\nChapter VI — The City of Cairo from 1836 to 1846 — The Illinois Central Railroad Company of 1836 — The Illinois Exporting Company — The Cairo City and Canal Company.\n\nMANY years ago I was in the office of Judge Thomas Hileman, of Jonesboro, Illinois, for whom I had charge of important litigation, to which he was a party. I was looking over the books in his office and saw a small volume which had the signature of H. W. Billings on the first blank page and the signature of D. B. Holbrook on the next page. Judge Hileman had found the book in the court-house yard, where it had been dumped with a barrel of old papers and documents. The book had probably last belonged to Mr. Cyrus G. Simons, a prominent lawyer of Jonesboro many years ago, who had also practiced law in Alexander County in the years 1840 to 1850, and represented Union county in the legislature. The book contained twenty-five separate documents or papers, all relating to Cairo. They were twenty-five small pamphlets, of various sizes, bound together. Some of them were printed by James Narine, No. 11 Wall Street, New York City, in the year 1837. Its table of contents is as follows:\n\nDOCUMENTS PRINTED RELATING TO THE CITY OF CAIRO\n\n1.

Plat of the \"City of Cairo,\" as laid off by the Prospectus, A. D. 1818.\n\nAs remarked about the City of Cairo of 1818, we know very little about the conferences, correspondence and other negotiations which lead up to the second attempt to establish a city here. The first attempt seems to have ended with the death of Comegys. The lands he and his associates had undertaken to purchase from the government and for which they failed to pay in full, had been forfeited, as provided by the act under which the purchases were made, and these being now gone or lost, the enterprise was wholly abandoned.\n\nIt was not until the year 1835, that the same lands again, and many others in the township, were entered and paid for as the law then required. These entries were for the same purpose as that which lead to the entries in 1817.\n\nFollowing these entries, came, first of all, the incorporation of the first Illinois Central Railroad Company, January 16, 1836. Two days afterward, the legislature incorporated the Illinois Exporting Company, whose general place of business was at Alton or elsewhere in the State as might be agreed upon. The incorporators were James S. Lane, Thomas G. Hawley, Anthony Olney, John M. Krum, and D. B. Holbrook.\n\nBy reference to the first of these two acts, it will be seen that the railroad provided for was to \"commence at or near the mouth of the Ohio river and run thence North to a point on the Illinois river at or near the terminus of the Illinois and Michigan Canal.\" Following the incorporation of the railroad company and the Exporting Company, came the incorporation of the Cairo City and Canal Company, March 4, 1837, the incorporators of which were Darius B. Holbrook, Miles A. Gilbert, John S. Hacker, Alexander M. Jenkins, Anthony Olney, and William M. Walker.—This company had a short but a very active career. The purchasers of those lands and the incorporators of this Company saw clearly how the establishment of their proposed city depended upon a railroad connection with the great upper country of the state; and, had it not been for outside interference, their undertaking might have fared very much better. But the spirit of enterprise that was in them was also in many other persons in the state whose actions they could not control and who thought the times required the state to enter upon a system of railroad construction worthy of its extent and the richness of its soil. One railroad from the mouth of the Ohio River to the end of the proposed canal on the Illinois River was a very small part of what it was thought the state needed; and accordingly on the 27th day of February, 1837, the legislature passed the celebrated act entitled, \"An Act to Establish a General System of Internal Improvements.\"\n\n43\n\nTo show how small an enterprise was that of the Central Railroad and the Cairo City and Canal Company, compared with that undertaken by the state, one has but to read the eighteenth section of the last-named act. It provided for the construction of eight different railroads and for the improvement of five of the rivers of the state, and for the establishment of a public mail route from Vincennes to St. Louis; and for these purposes, appropriations amounting to ten millions two hundred thousand dollars were made, a very large sum for those early days. The two hundred thousand dollar appropriation was for the benefit of counties through which none of the railroads were to pass, the same to be expended in the improvement of public roads therein. The seventh clause of the section is in these words: \"The Board of Commissioners of Public Work, provided for by this act, is required to adopt measures to commence, construct and complete, within a reasonable time, a railroad from the City of Cairo, at or near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, to some point at or near the southern terminus of the Illinois and Michigan canal, via Vandalia, Shelbyville, Decatur and Bloomington, and from thence via Savannah to Galena; and for the construction and completion of the said railroad and appendages, the sum of three millions and five hundred thousand dollars is hereby appropriated.\"\n\nThe situation the passage of this act produced was very embarrassing to the Cairo enterprise and its Central Railroad. The news of its introduction into the legislature must have produced in the minds of those Cairo people a state of feeling little short of consternation. They had their acts of incorporation and could well say that the act for their railroad was a contract which the state could not annul; and, no doubt, they made this claim and argument with great earnestness. But the whole state was not to be thwarted by the comparatively small part of it down here, and the Cairo people were soon brought to terms; but it was with promises that they should have a railroad from Cairo and about on the same line as that called for by their own charter of January 16, 1836; but it was not to be their railroad, but the state's alone. On the 27th day of June, 1837, Alexander M. Jenkins, David J. Baker, D. B. Holbrook and Pierre Menard, as directors of the railroad company and in its behalf, released to the state their rights and privileges under said last-named act, but on the condition of the restoration of their rights, should the state repeal the act of February 27, 1837.\n\nThe operations of the Cairo City and Canal Company, at Cairo, and the work of the state in and about the construction of its internal improvements and especially of its central railroad, are so connected together that it is not easy to give them separate treatment, and they will hereafter be spoken of as occasion seems to require.\n\nThis period of ten years witnessed not only another attempt at establishing a city, but it was characterized by such energy and management as gave promise of great and most favorable results. The long slumber of eighteen years was followed by activities which clearly\n\n44\n\nindicated that sleep and dreaming were to disappear, and give place to hard but hopeful work, conducted by men of ability and enterprise and supplied with means adequate to the great undertaking. The men and means were thought to be all that the situation required, and hence the hopes of all who were in anywise interested rose as correspondingly high as they had sunken low before.\n\nDarius Blake Holbrook, of New York, whom we may call the successor of John G. Comegys, of Baltimore, was the man in charge and what was done and probably what was not done may be traced with a fair degree of safety and justice to him. He has been criticised much and severely, but quite unjustly, at least in some important respects. He seems to have had what may be called a local or home policy and a foreign policy as well, the former of which does not seem to have always been such as the real interests of the enterprise required. But, inasmuch as I have elsewhere given a short biographical sketch of this Cairo man of affairs, I will now proceed to relate what he did and caused to be done here at Cairo during this period.\n\nThe building of the city and of the Central Railroad was intended to be largely one and the same enterprise; but the act of February 27, 1837, in relation to internal improvements, severed the two completely, and thereafter the city and the road had to proceed as separate and wholly independent undertakings. The road, or its construction, was transferred to the state, whose interest in the city was more or less remote, whereas, before, it was in the hands of men and a company whose chief interest was perhaps in the establishment and growth of the city. In proof of this difference in interest, we may here state that in January, 1839, while work on the road was going forward between Cairo and Jonesboro and on many other parts of the line, a strong effort was made in the legislature to change the line of the road from Vandalia southward through Salem, Mt. Vernon, Frankfort, Benton and Vienna, to a point on the Ohio River near Grand Chain. The citizens of these towns had petitioned the legislature concerning the matter, and committees were appointed to investigate and report, and January 28, 1839, there were two reports in the senate, a majority report in favor of the change, and a minority report against the change; and on January 31, 1839, a strong report was presented in the House by Mr. Smith, of Wabash, insisting on the retention of the line on which the work was going forward. The reading of these reports will show what an important matter this became. Those persons favoring the new line urged strongly that the site here was most undesirable, and especially did they dwell upon the encroachments of the Mississippi River on the western side of the town. They cited what the chief engineer of the railroad, Mr. Jonathan Freeman, had written about the matter in his letter to Kinney and Willard of December 24, 1838. Had the change been made, and it seemed very probable for a time, the subsequent acts of the legislature incorporating the second and third railroad companies would have likely required the same line to be followed. It was this well-grounded fear on the part of Holbrook and those acting with him\n\n45\n\nthat led them to insist as a condition to their surrenders to the state, one in 1837, and one in 1849, that the road should start at and be built from Cairo. Had they not thus insisted, the road might never have come here at all, so great were the doubts of the public at large as to the security of the Cairo site. But it was held here stubbornly and tenaciously, and to the great and lasting credit of Holbrook, which should well nigh annul all the criticisms that were ever made against him. He is indeed a wise man who knows well just what he can and what he cannot afford to surrender.\n\nThis act of February 27, 1837, establishing a general system of public improvements, gave no name to the state's railroad, nor to any of the others for the construction of which the act provided.\n\nThe Board of Commissioners of Public Works, provided for in the act, entered upon their work, and the road was commenced at and built from Cairo and most of the grading was done for the distance of twenty-three or more miles. A bridge across Cache River was partly constructed; and so on, at many places along the line, all the way up to Galena. The line of the road in Cairo began at or near what are now the freight yards of the present company between Fourteenth and Eighteenth Streets, where the state purchased ten acres of ground for station or depot purposes. From this point above Fourteenth Street, the road extended westward, curving northward, and passing not far from the present court house and on through what is now the east side of St. Mary's Park, and thence on northward and very near the present main line of the road and crossing Cache River not over one hundred feet west of the present railroad bridge. Parts of the old earth embankment are yet visible one hundred feet or less west of the present road and south of Cache River and of the levee of the Drainage District. In many places the ridges are four feet high and all of them overgrown with trees.\n\nThe seven commissioners of the Board of Public Works, one for each judicial district of the state, reported from time to time as the work progressed in their several jurisdictions. Elijah J. Willard, of Jonesboro, was the commissioner for this third judicial district. His report of December 10, 1838, sets forth many matters and things concerning the work, which we would like to give here did space permit. It gives the number of contracts made for work between Cairo and Jonesboro, through the latter of which the road was to run instead of over the site of the present city of Anna. The change of this line of the old Illinois Central Railroad of 1837 to the present line of 1851, running through Anna, occasioned a very unfriendly feeling between the two places, which did not disappear for many years if entirely gone now. The report gives the names of the contractors and of the men on the work and to whom moneys were paid. Among them were Bryan Shannessy, who took contracts Nos. 1, 2 and 3, covering the distance from Cairo to a point beyond Cache River. Mr. Shannessy is spoken of in the report as of the city of Alton. Of the two hundred or more\n\n46\n\nnames on Willard's pay-roll, many of them would be remembered by a few of our oldest residents. He further reports that early in 1838, a right of way was procured, by proceedings in our Alexander County Circuit Court, t"
