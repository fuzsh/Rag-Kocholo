        "text": "A lot of history could be made at the 2024 Oscars.\n\nThe 96th Academy Awards, set for March 10, could see both films and individuals land impressive and significant wins.\n\nMORE: See full list of the 2024 Oscar nominations\n\nBetter yet, these achievements could happen across all types of categories, from best picture and directing to acting and various technical categories.\n\nWhile you get your predictions in order for Hollywood's biggest night, we've got you covered on potential historic wins you should keep an eye on.\n\nHere are some moments to watch out for at the 2024 Oscars.\n\nLily Gladstone could make history for Native Americans\n\nLily Gladstone would be the first Native American woman to win the Oscar for best actress should her performance in \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" triumph against the competition.\n\nNot only that, but she would also become the first person of Native American heritage to win an acting Oscar.\n\nMORE: Lily Gladstone talks about her history-making Oscar nomination\n\nIn a phone call with ABC News after her historic nomination, Gladstone said she is excited for others in her community to \"feel seen and represented.\"\n\nGladstone is of Siksikaitsitapi and NiMíiPuu heritage and uses she/they pronouns, according to her Instagram.\n\n'Oppenheimer' could join -- or beat -- an elite group of films\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" scored an impressive 13 nominations this year, positioning the film to potentially tie -- or even break -- the record for the most Oscar wins by a single film.\n\nThe record currently stands at 11 and is held by \"Ben-Hur\" in 1960, \"Titanic\" in 1998 and \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" in 2004.\n\nMartin Scorsese could set a new record for best director\n\nWith his best director nomination for \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" Martin Scorsese became the most-nominated living director.\n\nThis is Scorsese's 10th nomination in the category, putting him two behind the late William Wyler, who holds the record with 12 nominations.\n\nThis year, Scorsese also became the oldest nominee in the category's history at 81 years old. If he wins the Oscar, he would become the oldest best director winner.\n\nSandra H ü ller could score a historic win\n\nIf she wins the best actress Oscar for her role in \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" Sandra H ü ller would become the 1st German-born actress to win in the category in more than 60 years.\n\nSimone Signoret, who was born in Germany but is best known as a French actress, won the best actress Oscar for \"Room at the Top\" at the 1960 ceremony.\n\nA non-English language film could make history in the best picture category\n\nThree films in the best picture category -- \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" \"Past Lives\" and \"The Zone of Interest\" -- could make history with a best picture Oscar win this year.\n\nOnly one non-English language film has won best picture. The first to do so, \"Parasite,\" won the top prize in 2020.\n\n\"Anatomy of a Fall,\" from France, features French, English and German spoken throughout the film. \"Past Lives,\" an American film, features both English and Korean.\n\n\"The Zone of Interest,\" a co-production between the United Kingdom and Poland and the U.K.'s submission for international feature film, is the only film to feature no spoken English. German is predominantly spoken throughout.\n\nEmma Stone could achieve a rare feat\n\nWith her nominations for best actress for her performance in \"Poor Things\" and for best picture for producing the film, Emma Stone could pull off a rare double win.\n\nStone would become the second woman to win for acting and best picture for the same film, the first being Frances McDormand for \"Nomadland\" in 2021.\n\nColman Domingo could win big for Afro-Latinos\n\nColman Domingo could make history if he wins the Oscar for best actor for playing gay Civil Rights activist Bayard Rustin in \"Rustin.\"\n\nShould he take home the trophy, Domingo would become the first actor of Afro-Latino descent to win in the category.\n\n'American Fiction' could deliver historic double win for Black actors\n\nJeffrey Wright and Sterling K. Brown play brothers in \"American Fiction,\" and each earned Oscar nominations for their work in the film.\n\nIf Wright wins best actor and Brown wins best supporting actor, it would mark the first time two Black male actors won Oscars for the same film.\n\nBradley Cooper could direct himself to acting win\n\nBradley Cooper, who is up for best actor for playing famed composer Leonard Bernstein in \"Maestro,\" could join a small group of people who have directed themselves to acting wins.\n\nIf he achieves this, Cooper would be just the third person to do so. The first was Laurence Olivier for \"Hamlet\" in 1949 and Roberto Benigni for \"Life Is Beautiful\" in 1999.\n\nThelma Schoonmaker could become most-awarded film editor\n\nThelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's longtime film editor, could make history as the winningest person in the best film editing category if she wins for her work on \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\"\n\nWith a potential fourth win, Schoonmaker would have more Oscars for best editing than anyone else in history.\n\nSchoonmaker has previously won Oscars for editing \"Raging Bull,\" \"The Aviator\" and \"The Departed.\"\n\nJohn Williams could hit a high note\n\nWith his nomination this year for best original score for \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" John Williams became the oldest person to be nominated for an Oscar across all competitive categories at the age of 91.\n\nHaving recently celebrated a birthday, the 92-year-old could become the oldest person to win an Oscar if he takes home the trophy this year.\n\nJames Ivory currently holds the record as the oldest Oscar winner with his win for best adapted screenplay for \"Call Me By Your Name\" at the age of 89 at the 2018 ceremony. Ivory is now 95.\n\nWilliams is the most-nominated living person in Academy Awards history with 54 nominations -- only behind the late Walt Disney, who has the most nominations ever for a person, with 59.\n\nJustine Triet could become latest female best director winner\n\nWith her nomination for best director, for \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" Justine Triet became only the eighth woman to be nominated in the category in Oscars history.\n\nShould she win, Triet would become just the fourth woman to win best director, following in the footsteps of Kathryn Bigelow, who won in 2009 for \"The Hurt Locker\"; Chloé Zhao, who won in 2021 for \"Nomadland\"; and Jane Campion, who won in 2022 for \"The Power of the Dog.\""
