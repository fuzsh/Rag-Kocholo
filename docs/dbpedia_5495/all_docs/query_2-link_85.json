The other nominees are Janet McTeer as a cross-dressing laborer in \"Albert Nobbs\" and Shailene Woodley as a troublesome teen in \"The Descendants.\"\n\nWinslet had a second nomination, as best actress in a TV miniseries or movie for \"Mildred Pierce.\" \"Downton Abbey\" and \"Mildred Pierce\" tied for the most television nominations with four, with both shows competing for best miniseries or movie.\n\nSeveral newcomers were among the nominees, including \"Boss, \"New Girl,\" \"American Horror Story\" and \"Homeland.\"\n\nAlong with\n\nthe Globes field helps narrow down prospects for the\n\n, whose nominations come out Jan. 24.
