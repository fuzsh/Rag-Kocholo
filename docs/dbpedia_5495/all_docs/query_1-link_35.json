        "text": "West End favorite and Olivier nominee Hannah Waddingham, who hosted the 2023 Olivier Awards, returns as host for the 2024 ceremony April 14 at 5:45 PM BST at Royal Albert Hall. A highlights package of the ceremony will be broadcast on ITV later in the evening.\n\nPerhaps best known for her Emmy-winning performance on Apple's Ted Lasso, Waddingham began her career on the stage. She was the Lady of the Lake during the original runs of Spamalot in the West End and Broadway, and has also starred in U.K. productions of A Little Night Music, Into the Woods, The Wizard of Oz, and Kiss Me, Kate. She received Olivier nominations for her work in Spamalot, Night Music, and Kiss Me, Kate. On the big screen, Waddingham appeared as a factory worker in Les Misérables and as Mother Witch in Hocus Pocus 2, and she's been seen in episodes of Game of Thrones, Sex Education, My Family, and Benidorm.\n\nThe Olivier Awards, the West End's top theatrical honors, were established in 1976 as the Society of West End Theatre Awards. Renamed for the British actor Laurence Olivier in 1984, they are considered the equivalent of Broadway's Tony Awards. Past hosts of the Olivier ceremony have included Michael Ball, Imelda Staunton, Clive Anderson, Gemma Arterton, Stephen Mangan, Hugh Bonneville, Sheridan Smith, Lenny Henry, and Catherine Tate.\n\nNominees for the 2024 Olivier Awards were revealed March 12. Leading the list of this year's nominees are the Broadway-bound minimalist revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard and the National's Dear England.\n\nJamie Lloyd's revival of Sunset Boulevard picked up 11 nods, including one for Best Musical Revival. Also recognized: the production's direction (Lloyd), choreography (Fabian Aloise), sound design (Adam Fisher), music direction (Alan Williams), set design (Soutra Gilmour, Nathan Amzi, and Joe Ransom), and lighting design (Jack Knowles). In the cast, the show got nominations in all four musical acting categories, including supporting actress for Grace Hodgett Young, supporting actor for David Thaxton, leading actor for Tom Francis, and leading actress for Nicole Scherzinger.\n\nThe dramatically reimagined take on Andrew Lloyd Webber, Don Black, and Christopher Hampton's stage musical of the 1950 film already has announced its Broadway transfer. Scherzinger is slated to reprise her now Olivier-nominated performance as faded silent film star Norma Desmond.\n\nAs for plays, the National Theatre's Dear England leads the pack with nine nods, including Best Play. Production star Joseph Fiennes received a nomination in the leading actor category, as did co-stars Will Close and Gina McKee, both in the supporting categories. The James Graham play, telling the story of England's men's football team and team manager Gareth Southgate, was also nominated for its choreography (Ellen Kane and Hannes Langolf), sound design (Dan Balfour and Tom Gibbins), set design (Es Devlin and Ash J Woodward), lighting design (Jon Clark), and direction (Rupert Goold).\n\nDear England also has further plans ahead. The piece is in the process of becoming a limited series for the BBC, with international distribution in the works as well. Fiennes will reprise his performance as Southgate.\n\nSeveral Broadway alums received nominations in the performance categories, including Charlie Stemp for leading actor in a musical for his performance in Crazy for You, Cedric Neal for supporting actor for Guys and Dolls, and both Caissie Levy and Marisha Wallace in leading actress in a musical, for their performances in Next to Normal and Guys and Dolls, respectively. Sarah Jessica Parker received a nomination in leading actress in a play for her work in Plaza Suite.\n\nAlso up for Best New Play are Jez Butterworth's The Hills of California, Jack Thorne's The Motive and the Cue, and Beth Steel's Till the Stars Come Down. Best New Musical nominations went to The Little Big Things, Next to Normal, Operation Mincemeat, and 2022 Tony winner A Strange Loop. The Oliviers also include a category for Best New Entertainment or Comedy Play, which went to Accidental Death of an Anarchist, Stephen Sondheim's Old Friends, Stranger Things: The First Shadow, and Cardy V Rooney: The Wagatha Christie Trial.\n\nSee the full list of nominees below:\n\nBest New Play\n\nDear England, James Graham\n\nThe Hills of California, Jez Butterworth\n\nThe Motive and the Cue, Jack Thorne\n\nTill the Stars Come Down, Beth Steel\n\nBest New Musical\n\nThe Little Big Things\n\nNext to Normal\n\nOperation Mincemeat\n\nA Strange Loop\n\nBest Revival\n\nThe Effect\n\nMacbeth\n\nShirley Valentine\n\nVanya\n\nBest Musical Revival\n\nGroundhog Day\n\nGuys and Dolls\n\nHadestown\n\nSunset Boulevard\n\nBest New Entertainment or Comedy Play\n\nAccidental Death of an Anarchist, Dario Fo and Franca Rame, Tom Basden (adaptation)\n\nStephen Sondheim’s Old Friends\n\nStranger Things: The First Shadow, Kate Trefry\n\nVardy V Rooney: The Wagatha Christie Trial, Liv Hennessy (adaptation)\n\nBest Actress in a Supporting Role\n\nLorraine Ashbourne, Till the Stars Come Down\n\nPriyanga Burford, An Enemy of the People\n\nHaydn Gwynne, When Winston Went to War With the Wireless\n\nGina McKee, Dear England\n\nTanya Reynolds, A Mirror\n\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nWill Close, Dear England\n\nPaul Hilton, An Enemy of the People\n\nGiles Terera, Clyde’s\n\nLuke Thompson, A Little Life\n\nZubin Varla, A Little Life\n\nBest Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical\n\nGrace Hodgett Young, Sunset Boulevard\n\nZoë Roberts, Operation Mincemeat\n\nAmy Trigg, The Little Big Things\n\nEleanor Worthington-Cox, Next to Normal\n\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical\n\nJak Malone, Operation Mincemeat\n\nCedric Neal, Guys and Dolls\n\nDavid Thaxton, Sunset Boulevard\n\nJack Wolfe, Next to Normal\n\nBest Actress\n\nLaura Donnelly, The Hills of California\n\nSophie Okonedo, Medea\n\nSarah Jessica Parker, Plaza Suite\n\nSheridan Smith, Shirley Valentine\n\nSarah Snook, The Picture of Dorian Gray\n\nBest Actor\n\nJoseph Fiennes, Dear England\n\nMark Gatiss, The Motive and the Cue\n\nJames Norton, A Little Life\n\nAndrew Scott, Vanya\n\nDavid Tennant, Macbeth\n\nBest Actress in a Musical\n\nNatasha Hodgson, Operation Mincemeat\n\nCaissie Levy, Next to Normal\n\nNicole Scherzinger, Sunset Boulevard\n\nMarisha Wallace, Guys and Dolls\n\nBest Actor in a Musical\n\nDavid Cumming, Operation Mincemeat\n\nTom Francis, Sunset Boulevard\n\nDaniel Mays, Guys and Dolls\n\nCharlie Stemp, Crazy for You\n\nBest Director\n\nStephen Daldry and Justin Martin, Stranger Things: The First Shadow\n\nRupert Goold, Dear England\n\nJamie Lloyd, Sunset Boulevard\n\nSam Mendes, The Motive and the Cue\n\nBest Theatre Choreographer\n\nFabian Aloise, Sunset Boulevard\n\nEllen Kane and Hannes Langolf, Dear England\n\nArlene Phillips with James Cousins, Guys and Dolls\n\nMark Smith, The Little Big Things\n\nSusan Stroman, Crazy for You\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nBunny Christie and Deborah Andrews, Guys and Dolls\n\nRyan Dawson Laight, La Cage Aux Folles\n\nHugh Durrant, Peter Pan\n\nMarg Horwell, The Picture of Dorian Gray\n\nBest Sound Design\n\nPaul Arditti.
