        "text": "\"Know your lines and don't bump into the furniture\"\n\nA line that may have originated with Noel Coward but which is most often attributed to SPENCER TRACY, a true acting great who was noninated for nine Oscars, winning two (above, Tracy in the 1950 film Father Of The Bride, with Joan Bennett).\n\nCulture stars who died in 2016\n\n\"I never said all actors are cattle, what I said was all actors should be treated like cattle.\"\n\nALFRED HITCHCOCK the acclaimed director of Psycho, The Birds, Vertigo and Rear Window, is photographed on a visit to the set of Coronation Street's pub, The Rovers Return, at Granada television studios in Manchester in June 1964. In response to his comments, actress Carole Lombard once brought some heifers on to the set of the 1941 film Mr and Mrs Smith with name tags of Lombard, Robert Montgomery and Gene Raymond, the stars of the film.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock: sadistic prankster\n\n“Every bad decision I’ve made has been based on money. I grew up in the projects and you don’t turn down money there. You take it, because you never know when it’s all going to end. I made Cop III because they offered me $15 million. That $15 million was worth having Roger Ebert’s thumb up my ass.”\n\nEDDIE MURPHY on the 1994 film Beverly Hills Cop III (above, Murphy with Theresa Randle). Esteemed film critic Ebert once wrote that Murphy had gone from \"a smart, funny street cop\" in the original film to a \"loud, arrogant boor\" in the sequels.\n\n\"Actors are there to entertain people. We're not up there to feel anything, nobody's interested. Peter O'Toole told me that when yout the script, you just perform as though you were late for a train. Don't get caught 'acting'\"\n\nJOHN GOODMAN, above in The Great Lebowski with Jeff Bridges. Goodman, who has also starred in films such as Argo and Raising Arizona, won a Golden Globe best actor award for his work in the comedy series Roseanne.\n\nWhat it's like to audition for the Coen Brothers\n\n\"As an actor you spend all your life trying to do something they put people in asylums for.\"\n\nJANE FONDA is seen her playing the part of Catherine (Cat) Ballou, who runs into a little trouble in Wolf City, Wyoming. That part came in 1965, before she was the infamous Hanoi Jane and before she won her two Oscars (for Klute in 1971 and Coming Home in 1978).\n\n\"It's what I learn from the great actors that I work with. Stillness. That's all and that's the hardest thing.\"\n\nMORGAN FREEMAN (above in his Oscar-nominated role as Nelson Mandela in the 2009 film Invictus) first took took acting lessons at the Pasadena Playhouse in San Francisco in the early Sixties after spending four years in the United States Air Force. He won an Oscar for Million Dollar Baby.\n\n\"The best thing about acting is that I get to lose myself in another character and actually get paid for it... It's a great outlet. I'm not really sure who I am – it seems I change every day.\"\n\nLEONARDO DICAPRIO first appeared in a film in 1991, when he was 17. He has since been involved with 39 films as an actor and producer. He is up for an Oscar for the sixth time for his role in The Revenant (above).\n\nRobbie Collin reviews The Revenant\n\n\"Acting is the perfect idiot's profession... acting is the most minor of gifts and not a very high-class way to earn a living. After all, Shirley Temple could do it at the age of four.”\n\nKATHARINE HEPBURN was 96 when she died in 2003 and was considered one of the true greats of Hollywood's golden age. Hepburn (pictured above in 1932) won four Academy Awards for Best Actress – Morning Glory (1934), Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1968), The Lion in Winter (1969) and On Golden Pond (1982) – a record for any performer. She was nominated a further eight times.\n\n\"Not to sound rude, but [acting] is stupid... Everybody's like, 'How can you remain with a level head?' And I'm like, 'Why would I ever get cocky? I'm not saving anybody's life. There are doctors who save lives and firemen who run into burning buildings. I'm making movies. It's stupid.'\"\n\nJENNIFER LAWRENCE (above as X-Men shape-shifting villain Mystique) had won an Academy Award for Best Actress by the age of 22, making her the second-youngest Best Actress Oscar winner ever.\n\nJennifer Lawrence in pictures\n\n\"Acting is the expression of a neurotic impulse. It's a bum's life. The principal benefit acting has afforded me is the money to pay for my psychoanalysis.\"\n\nMARLON BRANDO, who is said to have perfected the method acting style created b Constantin Stanislavski, won Oscars for his roles as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront (1954) and Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972).

He has campaigned for Barack Obama, gay rights and environmental issues.\n\nTom Hanks is outdated says his son Chester\n\n\"When you talk about a great actor, you're not talking about Tom Cruise.

He was really loving to me until I got more attention than he did. Then he hated me.\"\n\nTATUM O'NEAL may have proved Walter Brennan wrong, because there was enough expression in her face to become the youngest Oscar winner in history, picking up the best supporting actress trophy at the age of 10 for her role as tomboy Addie in Paper Moon (1973).
