        "text": "The Cecil B. DeMille Award is a signal honor for anyone in the entertainment business, but Michael Douglas is doubly delighted to be this year's honoree during NBC's telecast tonight of the 61st Annual Golden Globe Awards.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor (\"Wall Street\") and producer (\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\") is the very first second-generation DeMille honoree. In 1968, his father, Kirk Douglas, received the same award, which honors \"outstanding contribution to the entertainment field.\"\n\n\"I get an extra kick because of my father, because I think it does give you kind of a sense of immortality,\" the younger Douglas says. \"For him to be able to sit there and watch his son pick up a lifetime achievement award, there probably is a wonderful feeling for him - and certainly for me, too, because to be compared to someone like him is a lovely honor, too - even if it's coming much, much too early for me,\" he chuckles.\n\nIt's true that, at 59, Michael Douglas is still young and active enough to make a \"career achievement\" award seem a mite premature. Then again, he already stands with Laurence Olivier as the only two people in history to win Oscars in the categories of both best actor and producer of the best picture (Olivier scored both awards for his 1948 \"Hamlet\").\n\nWhile he grew up surrounded by actors and acting, however, Douglas says today his entry into the entertainment field was anything but a forgone conclusion.\n\n\"My mother (Diana Douglas) is an actress as well,\" he explains. \"She and my father met in acting school, so in a sense maybe you could say I was destined to become an actor. They met out of a love for acting. Growing up with my mother in Manhattan, I was struck by her love for doing theater and soaps, and my stepfather, who played a very big part in my life, was a Broadway producer.\n\n\"But having said that, I was undeclared in college into my junior year, so I was definitely a late bloomer. I had to declare something and, frankly, I think I picked theater mainly because I thought it would be easy. So it was a growth, a process. . .. It wasn't something I wished for as a kid.\"\n\nAfter attending the elite Choate School, Douglas was accepted at Yale, but passed on the Ivy League in favor of the University of California, Santa Barbara. It was among his first conscious attempts to keep his life on the right track, he says.\n\n\"To be honest, I just didn't much like the guy I was turning out to be in those prep schools back east,\" he reflects. \"It was probably one of the first big decisions I ever made, this notion that, 'No, I have to change.'\n\n\"My father probably thought it was mainly because I wanted to spend more time with him, but it had more to do with the brochure from this university campus by the sea,\" Douglas adds, laughing. \"They had guys walking down the beach with girls in two-piece bathing suits, and that was in 1963, when you didn't see too many girls in two-piece bathing suits back east. Certainly not at Yale.\"\n\nCalifornia also offered the young actor some new perspective via the burgeoning free speech movement and controversy over the Vietnam War. He returned to New York, consciousness raised, and paid his dues on stage and in a few early TV and film roles.\n\nIn 1972, Douglas bowed as Karl Malden's sidekick in \"The Streets of San Francisco,\" an ABC hit that expanded his fan base. He had a year to go on his contract when he finally got a shot at a long-held dream project, producing a film version of Ken Kesey's biting novel \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\"\n\n\"Karl Malden, who has always been a mentor to me, and the producer, Quinn Martin, let me leave (\"Streets\") . . . to go produce 'Cuckoo's Nest,' which was incredible, because I got an Oscar for that on my first time as a producer,\" Douglas says.\n\n\"As an actor, though, I was still having to make the transition from being a 'TV actor,' with movies like 'The China Syndrome' and 'Romancing the Stone.' The big year for me as an actor was in 1985-86, with 'Fatal Attraction' and 'Wall Street' - but before that, some people actually had asked me why I didn't just give up acting in favor of producing full time.\"\n\nIn addition to his busy acting and producing careers, Douglas today also devotes time to volunteer work for the United Nations (he was named a U.N. Messenger of Peace in 1998), and he and wife Catherine Zeta-Jones recently hosted the 2003 Annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway.\n\n\"I firmly believe we live on a very tiny planet, and ultimately we are going to have to resolve everything, and I believe the United Nations is the best organization for that,\" Douglas says.\n\n\"I am an internationalist, I guess you could say, and firmly against isolationism, which breeds all sorts of bad qualities, like paranoia. I must say, it's difficult to be an American traveling the world right now, because I think we are misunderstood in many areas. I support our armed forces during these tough times, but it's amazing how we are disliked in quite a number of areas.\"\n\nCloser to home, Douglas says his father's stroke in 1995, along with other challenges, have had a powerful impact on his own life.\n\n\"How that has affected me is . . . mainly in how lucky I have been to meet my beautiful wife and started a new family,\" he says. \"You know, at this point in my life, I certainly never anticipated having a 3¶-year-old and a 7-month-old.\n\n\"To be able to share this award with my family during what is a very beautiful time for us just shows how my priorities have changed very dramatically. Now my wife comes first, and my family, and only then my work, and that is something I am pretty sure I couldn't have said 20 years ago. I encourage a lot of fathers to get your career squared away before having a family.\""
