        "text": "It's Oscars season once again. The biggest stars in Hollywood and global cinema are competing to take home the most coveted prize in the film industry: an Academy Award.\n\nA total of 3,039 Oscars have been awarded since the inception of the Academy Awards in 1929, and some actors and filmmakers have more than others.\n\nLet's take a look at the stars who've been lucky enough to pick up multiple Oscars over the years.\n\nActors with most Oscar wins\n\nNo male actor has yet won four Academy Awards but three have achieved a hat-trick, with Jack Nicholson, Daniel Day-Lewis and the little-remembered Water Brennan, all in the 'three Oscars' club.\n\nJack Nicholson – 3\n\nWinning his first Oscar in 1976 for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Jack Nicholson thanked his agent \"who about ten years ago advised me that I had no business being an actor. Thank you.\"\n\nBest Actor: One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest (1975)\n\nBest Supporting Actor: Terms Of Endearment (1983)\n\nBest Actor: As Good As It Gets (1997)\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis - 3\n\nAccepting his most recent Oscar in 2013, the since-retired actor said: “I really don’t know how any of this happened. I do know that I’ve received so much more than my fair share of good fortune in my life, and I’m so grateful to the Academy for this beautiful honour.”\n\nBest Actor: My Left Foot (1989)\n\nBest Actor: There Will Be Blood (2007)\n\nBest Actor: Lincoln (2012)\n\nWalter Brennan - 3\n\nWalter Brennan is the only actor in Academy history to win three awards for Best Supporting Actor, and incredibly, they all happened within a space of four years.\n\nBest Supporting Actor: Come and Get It (1936)\n\nBest Supporting Actor: Kentucky (1938)\n\nBest Supporting Actor: The Westerner (1940)\n\nActresses with most wins\n\nKatherine Hepburn is the only actor ever to win four Academy Awards but both Meryl Streep and Frances McDormand are closing in on her.\n\nWill either of them scoop that coveted fourth Oscar in the next few years?\n\nKatherine Hepburn - 4\n\nIncredibly, the actor with the most Academy Awards never attended the ceremony to collect her Oscars. \"As for me, prizes are nothing,” she once said. “My prize is my work.”\n\nBest Actress: Morning Glory (1933)\n\nBest Actress: Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967)\n\nBest Actress: The Lion in Winter (1968)\n\nBest Actress: On Golden Pond (1981)\n\nMeryl Streep - 3\n\nCollecting her third Oscar in 2012, the most nominated actor in Oscars history said: \"When they called my name I had this feeling I could hear half of America going, \"Oh no! Oh, c'mon why? Her? Again?\" You know? But, whatever.\"\n\nBest Supporting Actress: Kramer vs. Kramer (1979)\n\nBest Actress: Sophie's Choice (1982)\n\nBest Actress: The Iron Lady (2011)\n\nFrances McDormand - 3\n\nWinning her third Oscar in 2021 for Nomadland during a pandemic-blighted awards season, Frances McDormand urged the audience to \"take everyone you know into a theatre, shoulder to shoulder in that dark space and watch every film that's represented here tonight.\"\n\nBest Actress: Fargo (1996)\n\nBest Actress: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017)\n\nBest Actress: Nomadland (2020)\n\nIngrid Bergman - 3\n\nWinning her third Oscar in 1975, Swedish actor Ingrid Bergman dedicated her award to fellow nominee Valentina Cortese who felt she'd been overlooked the previous year for her role in Day For Night. \"It's so ironic that this year she's nominated when the picture won last year,\" she said. \"I don't quite understand that, but here I am and I'm her rival and I don't like it at all. Please forgive me, Valentina. I didn't mean to. Thank you.\"\n\nBest Actress: Gaslight (1944)\n\nBest Actress: Anastasia (1956)\n\nBest Supporting Actress: Murder on the Orient Express (1974)\n\nActors with the most nominations\n\nJack Nicolson leads the pack with an impressive 12 noms, with Sir Laurence Olivier in second place with 10 (though he only won once, for 1948’s Hamlet). Spencer Tracy (two wins), Denzel Washington (two wins), Paul Newman (one win) and Al Pacino (one win) all have nine.\n\nJack Nicholson - 12\n\nLaurence Olivier - 10\n\nSpencer Tracy - 9\n\nDenzel Washington - 9\n\nPaul Newman - 9\n\nAl Pacino - 9\n\nActresses with the most nominations\n\nMeryl Streep boasts the most number of nominations of any actor, male or female, with an eye-popping 21. Katherine Hepburn may have more actual awards but she was only nominated 12 times.

Woody Allen, meanwhile, has three Best Original Screenplay statues but only one for directing (for Annie Hall). Also in the three Screenplay Oscars club are Paddy Chayefsky and collaborators Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder.\n\nWoody Allen - 3\n\nAnnie Hall (1977), Hannah and her Sisters (1986), Midnight in Paris (2011)\n\nPaddy Chayefsky - 3\n\nMarty (1955), The Hospital (1971), Network (1976)\n\nCharles Brackett - 3\n\nThe Lost Weekend (1945) (shared with Billy Wilder), Titanic (1953), Sunset Boulevard (1955) (shared with Billy Wilder and D.M.

Sadly for Lang, out of his 18 noms, he would win only once, for 1932's A Farewell to Arms.\n\nLeon Shamroy - 4\n\nThe Black Swan (1942), Wilson (1944), Leave Her For Heaven (1945), Cleopatra (1963)\n\nJoseph Ruttenberg - 4\n\nThe Great Waltz (1938), Mrs. Miniver (1942), Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), Gigi (1958)\n\nCinematographers with three Oscars: Robert Surtees, Conrad Hall, Robert Richardson, Emmanuel Lubezki, Arthur C Miller, Freddie Young, Vittorio Storaro, Winton C Hoch.\n\nPeople with posthumous Oscars\n\nIt’s happened many times in Oscar history that, by the time it’s come to the big event, a nominee has passed on, with the Academy having given out 29 posthumous Oscars over the course of its 96-year history, including 14 individuals with honorary awards.\n\nNotable winners include:\n\nWalt Disney - Best Short Film (Animated): Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968)\n\nPeter Finch - Best Actor: Network (1976)\n\nHoward Ashman - Best Music: Original Song, Beauty and the Beast (1991)\n\nConrad Hall - Best Cinematography: Road to Perdition (2002)\n\nHeath Ledger - Best Supporting Actor: The Dark Knight (2008)\n\nThe 2024 Oscars will take place on Sunday, 10 March and will be broadcast live on ITV.\n\nRead more: The Oscars\n\nHow to watch the 2024 Oscars\n\nWhere you can stream the 2024 Oscar nominees\n\nWho will win at the 2024 Oscars?"
