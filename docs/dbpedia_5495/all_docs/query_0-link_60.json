The series made HBO history as the first Original Series to grow viewership consistently week after week over the course of its season. She can also be seen portraying Angie Dickinson in Ryan Murphy’s Netflix adaptation of the hit-Broadway musical “The Prom,” alongside Meryl Streep, Kerry Washington, and James Corden – the film premiered on December 11th. She has recently wrapped production on Robert Eggers’ “The Northman” and “Nine Perfect Strangers” for Hulu, a project she is producing under Blossom Films.\n\nIn 2003, Kidman won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry’s “The Hours,” for which she also won a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award. She has also been honored with Academy Award nominations for her performances in Baz Luhrmann’s innovative musical, “Moulin Rouge!,” John Cameron Mitchell’s “Rabbit Hole,” and Garth Davis’ “Lion.” Kidman also served as a producer on “Rabbit Hole,” the first feature film produced under her production company, Blossom Films. She will next begin production on Aaron Sorkin’s “Being the Ricardo’s” with Javier Bardem.\n\nKidman took home her first Golden Globe for her performance in Gus Van Sant’s “To Die For.” Her next Golden Globe came in 2002 when she was nominated for both Best Actress in a Musical for “Moulin Rouge!” and Best Actress in a Drama for Alejandro Amenabar’s psychological thriller, “The Others,” winning for Best Actress in a Musical. She has also received Golden Globe nominations for the films “Billy Bathgate,” “Cold Mountain,” “Birth,” “Rabbit Hole,” “The Paperboy,” “Lion,” and “Destroyer.”\n\nHer other feature credits include “Eyes Wide Shut,” “Nine,” “Killing of a Sacred Deer,” “Beguiled,” “Boy Erased” and “Aquaman.” She was most recently seen in Jay Roach’s “Bombshell” opposite Charlize Theron and Margot Robbie.\n\nIn television, Kidman starred in HBO’s “Hemingway and Gellhorn” alongside Clive Owen in 2012 (Emmy, Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe nominations). In 2017, Kidman returned to the small screen with the limited series “Big Little Lies” alongside Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Zoe Kravitz, and Shailene Woodley for HBO, co-executive produced by Blossom Films. Kidman received Emmy, Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards for her portrayal of Celeste. “Big Little Lies” also received an Emmy Award, Golden Globe and Critics Choice Award for Outstanding Limited Series. The second season of the series premiered in June 2019.\n\nIn theater, Kidman made a highly-lauded London stage debut in the fall of 1998, starring with Iain Glen in “The Blue Room,” David Hare’s modern adaptation of Schnitzler’s “La Ronde.” For her performance, Kidman won London’s Evening Standard Award and was nominated in the Best Actress category for a Laurence Olivier Award. In 2015, Kidman was seen on the West End stage in Anna Ziegler’s “Photograph 51,” for which she received a London’s Evening Standard Award.\n\nIn January of 2006, Kidman was awarded Australia’s highest honor, the Companion in the Order of Australia. She was also named, and continues to serve, as Goodwill Ambassador of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, UN Women. Along with her husband, Keith Urban, she has helped raise millions over the years for the Women’s Cancer Program which is a world-renowned center for research into the causes, treatment, prevention, and eventual cure of women’s cancer. In 2017, the Cannes Film Festival honored Kidman with a special award for her body of work and longstanding history with the festival. She is one of only eight people to ever receive this honor in the 70-year history of the festival.\n\nLast December, Kidman announced her partnership with SeraLabs. She joins the brand as a strategic business partner and global brand ambassador. She will be working on the brand’s Seratopical line – a line of topical CBD products that support anti-aging as well as hydrating skin and relieving pain."
