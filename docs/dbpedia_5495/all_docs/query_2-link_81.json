        "text": "May 22, 1907 – July 11, 1989\n\nDespite his legendary reputation, nothing came easy for Laurence Olivier during his 65 years in the business known as “Show.” Spurred to pursue acting by his father, young Laurence eventually settled into a stage career – often shunning work in film and (eventually) television – for the live artform he felt allowed him to shine brightest. Alongside friend, Ralph Richardson, and rival, John Gielgud, Olivier is regarded as one the greatest actors of his generation.\n\nBut, his career was a mixed bag of success when all was said and done. He had countless successful performances that made money…but only accrued middling reviews. He brought brilliant roles to life that wowed critics…but failed to entice the public and flopped. It seems that he only very rarely got to enjoy both critical and commercial success in his projects. His career is one of the most honored in history, yet he spent the last years of his life making camera commercials. Legendary careers don’t always go the way you think. Through all the highs and lows, the thing about Laurence Olivier was: he loved the work.\n\nHis primary passion was Shakespeare. With Richardson, Olivier co-led the Old Vic Theatre Company on and off for many years, often directing or starring in Shakespeare’s tragedies and histories. Though he initially didn’t like working in film, he was able to shift his native, over-the-top theatricality to something more quiet and subtle, and eventually found success in Hollywood as well. But, even there, his work as both an actor and director never seemed to win EVERYONE over.\n\nStill, he was nominated for 11 Academy Awards (winning twice), 9 BAFTAs (winning 3 times), 9 Emmy Awards (5), 5 Golden Globe Awards (2), 3 Evening Standard Theatre Awards (3) and a Tony. Both the largest auditorium at London’s National Theatre AND the annual Society of London Theatre Awards are named for Olivier. He was conferred 4 honorary doctorate degrees. He was knighted. And, just for good measure, he was married to Vivien Leigh for 20 years during the height of both of their careers. His work paid off.\n\nHis health began to fail him in the 1970s and he spent the last decade of his life making commercials and cameo appearances on television. He died in his home at the age of 82 of kidney failure. His ashes were laid, quite fittingly, alongside some of the greatest artists in Britain’s history.\n\nBurial\n\nWestminster Abbey – London, UK\n\nSpecific Location\n\nThe South Transept (aka “Poets’ Corner”) – Southwestern section. To the left (south) of Samuel Johnson."
