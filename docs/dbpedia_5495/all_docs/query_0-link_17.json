The winning actress is given a gold-plated statuette known as an Oscar at the annual ceremony. The first Academy Awards presentation and banquet took place in 1929, but prizes for performances in supporting roles were not introduced until 1937, honouring films released in 1936. Below is a list of the winning actresses and the movies for which they won. The year is when the Oscar was presented."
