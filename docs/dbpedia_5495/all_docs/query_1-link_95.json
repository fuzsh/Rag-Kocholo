        "text": "01 of 18\n\nTom Hanks\n\nIt took until 2023 for Best Actor winner Hanks to become a Razzie winner after he picked up both worst supporting actor and worst screen couple (for his prosthetics and accent) for his role as Colonel Tom Parker in the 2022 biopic Elvis. The film itself was nominated for eight Oscars at the 2023 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for the man who portrays the King of Rock 'n' Roll himself, Austin Butler.\n\n02 of 18\n\nJared Leto\n\nIn 2022, Jared Leto — who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 2014 for his work in Dallas Buyers Club — scored his first Razzie for his supporting role as Paolo Gucci in the polarizing House of Gucci.\n\nThe actor won again in 2023 for worst actor in the Marvel film Morbius.\n\n03 of 18\n\nGlenn Close\n\nShe technically doesn't have either yet, but somehow in 2021, Glenn Close pulled off being nominated for both an Oscar and a Razzie for the same supporting role in Netflix's Hillbilly Elegy.\n\nThe film — which follows a Yale Law student who is drawn back to his Appalachian hometown and confronts his strained relationships with his mother and grandmother (played by Close) — was largely panned by critics and received a 25 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, though viewers gave it an 82 percent audience score. Close didn't win either award.\n\n04 of 18\n\nKim Basinger\n\nKim Basinger, who won Best Supporting Actress in 1998, was deemed worst supporting actress at the Razzies in 2018 for Fifty Shades Darker.\n\n05 of 18\n\nMel Gibson\n\nMel Gibson's 2017 Razzie was actually a good thing: He won the Razzie Redeemer Award for his directing work on Hacksaw Ridge. The actor was nominated for Best Director at the Oscars that year for the same film. Gibson previously earned two Academy Awards (Best Picture and Best Director) for 1996's Braveheart. He was recognized at the Razzies again in 2018 for his worst supporting actor-winning role in Daddy's Home 2.\n\n06 of 18\n\nBen Affleck\n\nBen Affleck won his first Oscar in 1998 for co-writing the Good Will Hunting screenplay with frequent collaborator and BFF Matt Damon. In 2013, he nabbed a win for Best Picture as a producer on Argo. In between that, he was named worst actor at the Razzies for three of his 2003 films, Daredevil, Gigli and Paycheck.\n\nIn 2017, he and his on-screen partner Henry Cavill were deemed the worst screen combo for their Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\n\n07 of 18\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio\n\nThe Revenant star didn't take home an Oscar until 2016, but DiCaprio claimed the Razzie for worst screen couple fairly early on in his career for 1998's The Man in the Iron Mask, where he portrayed both King Louis XIV of France and his imprisoned twin brother. His double-duty performance was memorable enough to edge out the stiff competition in that year's Razzie category, which also included Affleck and Liv Tyler's on-screen chemistry (or lack thereof) in Armageddon.\n\n08 of 18\n\nSandra Bullock\n\nSandra Bullock showed up at the 2010 Golden Raspberry Award ceremony with a cart full of copies of All About Steve, the film that earned her the award for worst actress. In her acceptance speech, captured in a video, Bullock challenged the audience to take their DVDs home and \"really watch\" her performance.\n\n\"I will show up next year if you promise to watch the movie, I mean really watch it, and really consider if it was really and truly the worst performance. And if you're willing to watch it, then I will come back next year, and I will give back the Razzie,\" she said.\n\nThe next day, The Blind Side star took home a statuette for Best Actress at the 82nd Academy Awards.\n\n09 of 18\n\nAl Pacino\n\nAl Pacino's work in Scent of a Woman won him Best Actor at the Oscars in 1993. Unfortunately, his choice to appear in Adam Sandler's critically panned 2011 film Jack and Jill resulted in Razzies for worst supporting actor and worst screen couple.\n\n10 of 18\n\nHalle Berry\n\nLike Bullock, the Monster's Ball Oscar winner had the gumption to personally accept her Golden Raspberry Award in a video shared by the Razzie Channel. Berry took to the Razzie award stage with her Oscar in hand, bursting into fake tears before delivering an eight-minute-long speech about her award-winning performance in Catwoman.\n\n\"I have a lot of people to thank because you don't win a Razzie without a lot of help from a lot of people,\" Berry said. \"First of all, I want to thank Warner Brothers — thank you for putting me in a piece of s---, God-awful movie.\"\n\n11 of 18\n\nLiza Minnelli\n\nIn her Oscar acceptance speech for Best Actress in 1973, Liza Minnelli called playing Sally Bowles in Cabaret \"one of the happiest times of my whole life.\" Winning the Razzie in 1988 for her lead roles in both Arthur 2: On the Rocks and Rent-a-Cop was a decidedly less happy experience.\n\n12 of 18\n\nLaurence Olivier\n\nLaurence Olivier won Best Actor for 1948's Hamlet, in addition to a 1944 Academy Honorary Award for Henry V (and was even celebrated with an honorary award for his entire body of work at the 1979 Oscars ceremony). However, the acclaimed actor also has the dubious honor of holding two Razzie Awards, one for worst actor in 1981's Inchon and a worst supporting actor Golden Raspberry for 1980's The Jazz Singer.\n\n13 of 18\n\nKevin Costner\n\nKevin Costner earned the Oscar for Best Director, Best Picture and a nomination for Best Actor for 1990's Dances with Wolves. Critics were less impressed with his performances in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Wyatt Earp and The Postman, all of which earned him worst actor awards at the Razzies.\n\n14 of 18\n\nPrince\n\nPrince won the Academy Award in 1985 for Best Music, thanks to Purple Rain. In 1987, the Razzies dubbed \"Love or Money\" from Under the Cherry Moon the worst original song. The film also helped the late musician — who later died at 57 in April 2016 — claim the awards for worst director and worst actor.\n\n15 of 18\n\nSofia Coppola\n\nSofia Coppola's infamously bad acting in The Godfather: Part III resulted in Razzie wins for worst supporting actress and worst new star. However, the writer-director was redeemed at the 2004 Oscars when she nabbed Best Original Screenplay for Lost in Translation.\n\n16 of 18\n\nFaye Dunaway\n\nFaye Dunaway has an Oscar and two Razzie wins to her name. The 1976 film Network earned her Best Actress, but it was her later roles in 1981's Mommie Dearest and 1993's The Temp caught the attention of the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation members.\n\n17 of 18\n\nMarlon Brando\n\nActing legend Marlon Brando was first recognized with an Oscar win for 1954's On the Waterfront. He famously declined the award for Best Actor in 1973, sending actress Sacheen Littlefeather to the ceremony in his place in protest of Hollywood's abysmal portrayal of Native Americans in film. Less nobly, Brando gave a worst supporting actor-worthy performance in 1996's The Island of Dr. Moreau."
