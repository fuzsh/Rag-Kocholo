        "text": "Let’s make one thing clear right off the bat: this article is a work in progress. It will be updated regularly and it’s worth checking in on from time to time.\n\nFor every year, I’ve listed a number of films I’ve seen in the past and need to rewatch. And I’ve mentioned, in most categories, the films I have yet to see. I’ve seen a lot of films over the years, some of them too long ago to properly rate by my current metrics, and some of them I simply didn’t rate at the time because I wasn’t paying quite enough attention to them, or what have you. Add in the films I’ve just plain never seen, and you’ve got a lot of room for improvement.\n\nBut even allowing for that, I’ve done my very best with those films I’ve seen, and I’ve seen some damned good ones in this decade – and more than a few of them are severely underrated and well worth looking into.\n\nIt works out like this: if I have at least five films for a given year which I rate a 77 or higher (***½ or ****), I can put together a Best Picture category, and a full set of nominees from all the films I’ve seen for that year. And if I have ten or more films which I rate highly enough, I do a full 10 nominees for Best Picture, which I generally prefer to do. At the moment, I can only do so for a few years this decade, but I hope to do so with all of them in due course of time.\n\nAnd in case you’re wondering why the 60s are the first decade I did a full post for, well, I’ve got enough films I rate highly enough to qualify for every year in the decade. I’m pretty sure no earlier decade can say that, at least at the moment.\n\nOne last note: it can be tricky to know what year to put a given film in, especially for foreign films, which would sometimes take years to play in the States. If a film was nominated for an Oscar in a given year, or submitted to the Oscars but not nominated in a given year, I’ll put it in that year. Otherwise, I typically go with the year it was initially released.\n\nOne asterisk (*) means an Oscar nominee, two asterisks (**) means an Oscar winner.\n\n1960:\n\nPicture:\n\nPsycho\n\nElmer Gantry*\n\nTunes of Glory\n\nHiroshima mon amour\n\nWild River\n\nI’ve seen four of the Best Picture nominees, two of which will appear on these lists – Gantry and The Sundowners (my #7) – and two which I need to rewatch – The Apartment (which won) and The Alamo (which isn’t all that great); the fifth nominee, Sons and Lovers, is rather hard to find. Other major films from this year which I’ve seen but need to rewatch include Can-Can, Exodus, Inherit the Wind, The Magnificent Seven, Ocean’s 11, and Sergeant Rutledge.\n\nDirector:\n\nAlfred Hitchcock, Psycho*\n\nAlain Resnais, Hiroshima mon amour\n\nRichard Brooks, Elmer Gantry\n\nElia Kazan, Wild River\n\nRonald Neame, Tunes of Glory\n\nAfter rewatching Psycho, Hitchcock ekes out the win for his iconic horror film, with Resnais’ nouvelle vague innovations a close second. Kudos to the directors for noticing Hitchcock here even if the Academy didn’t fully appreciate Psycho elsewhere. The Oscar winner was Billy Wilder; Fred Zinnemann was nominated for The Sundowners and just misses the top 5.\n\nActor:\n\nBurt Lancaster, Elmer Gantry**\n\nAnthony Perkins, Psycho\n\nAlec Guinness, Tunes of Glory\n\nRobert Mitchum, The Sundowners\n\nEiji Okada, Hiroshima mon amour\n\nIt’s hard to decide between Lancaster’s Oscar-winning turn and Perkins’ infamously snubbed performance; I’m honestly tempted to push Perkins Supporting (where he’d easily win), but for now he’s here, and a close second. Also snubbed was Mitchum, who was also snubbed for Home from the Hill (he won the NBR for both, however). But the Academy only nominated him once, for his breakthrough role in Story of G.I. Joe.\n\nActress:\n\nEmmanuelle Riva, Hiroshima mon amour\n\nDeborah Kerr, The Sundowners*\n\nLee Remick, Wild River\n\nJean Simmons, Elmer Gantry\n\nNancy Kwan, The World of Suzie Wong\n\nRiva would finally get an Oscar nomination 52 years later, for Amour. Kerr was nominated six times, but never won; the Oscar went to Elizabeth Taylor for BUtterfield 8, generally considered a terrible choice, especially over Shirley MacLaine in The Apartment. The only other nominee I’ve seen is Greer Garson as Eleanor Roosevelt in Sunrise at Campobello, but I didn’t think she was really that strong.\n\nSupporting Actor:\n\nJohn Mills, Tunes of Glory\n\nLaurence Olivier, Spartacus\n\nGeorge Peppard, Home from the Hill\n\nArthur Kennedy, Elmer Gantry\n\nGeorge Hamilton, Home from the Hill\n\nThe Oscar went to Peter Ustinov in Spartacus, who may well bump Hamilton whenever I go back to that film; I’ve only seen it once and wasn’t that impressed by it (it’s my #8 right now, a low ***½), but I really ought to give it another chance. Peppard won the NBR; it’s really odd, given that it was a fairly prestigious film by an Oscar-winning director, that Home got no Oscar nominations. I also considered nudging Martin Balsam onto this list for Psycho.\n\nThe other Oscar nominees that I’ve seen are Jack Kruschen in The Apartment (a bit strange that they chose him over Fred MacMurray), Sal Mineo in Exodus, and Chill Wills in The Alamo, who ran one of the most infamous campaign ads in Oscar history.\n\nSupporting Actress:\n\nShirley Jones, Elmer Gantry**\n\nJanet Leigh, Psycho*\n\nGlynis Johns, The Sundowners*\n\nJo Van Fleet, Wild River\n\nAnn Shoemaker, Sunrise at Campobello\n\nJones, playing against type as the prostitute who’d been corrupted by Elmer Gantry, wins with me and the Academy. Leigh is a pretty close second, but it drops off after that; I don’t remember if Eleanor Parker in Home from the Hill would be lead or supporting. There’s also Kay Walsh and Susannah York in Tunes of Glory to consider; I’ll need to rewatch the film to see where I put them.\n\nEnsemble:\n\nElmer Gantry\n\nTunes of Glory\n\nThe Sundowners\n\nHome from the Hill\n\nWild River\n\nAn easy choice here, with all the great performances in Gantry; there’s also Edward Andrews and Dean Jagger, who would probably be honorable mentions in Supporting Actor.\n\nOriginal Screenplay:\n\nHiroshima mon amour*\n\nJigoku\n\nThat’s all I’ve got for now, and Jigoku barely rates mention alongside Marguerite Duras’ amazing script for Hiroshima. The Oscar went to The Apartment (deservedly), which was the only Picture winner this decade to win Original Screenplay; in this decade only seven nominees in this category will even get Picture nominations, the absurdity of which will become very clear as we go along.\n\nAdapted Screenplay:\n\nElmer Gantry**\n\nTunes of Glory*\n\nPsycho\n\nHome from the Hill\n\nThe Sundowners*\n\nAnother instance where I agree with the Academy, at least for now; they do pretty well in his category, and they also nominated Inherit the Wind, which would easily have been my #3.\n\nCinematography:\n\nHiroshima mon amour\n\nPsycho*\n\nWild River\n\nElmer Gantry\n\nJigoku\n\nThe Oscars went to Spartacus and Sons and Lovers; I don’t remember being hugely impressed by the work in Spartacus, but that’s part of why I need to rewatch it (I’m pretty sure the print I saw was of the infamous 2010 restoration). I am surprised that they Academy passed over two Picture nominees in favor of BUtterfield 8 and Pepe.\n\nEditing:\n\nHiroshima mon amour\n\nPsycho*\n\nTunes of Glory\n\nElmer Gantry\n\nWild River\n\nHome from the Hill\n\nThe Oscar went to The Apartment and the nominees included The Alamo, Inherit the Wind, and Spartacus, which might at least be worth a spot on this list. But for now, I’m much more impressed by the fascinating editing in Hiroshima, though the shower scene alone puts Psycho a close second.\n\nProduction Design:\n\nSpartacus**\n\nJigoku\n\nPsycho*\n\nElmer Gantry\n\nWild River\n\nI will say, the sets in Spartacus are fantastic. The black-and-white Oscar went to The Apartment; Sunrise at Campobello was nominated for the color Oscar, not a bad choice but not interesting enough to get on here. Jigoku was never getting nominated, but the sets in the final sequence (set in Hell) are awesomely grotesque.\n\nCostume Design:\n\nSpartacus**\n\nElmer Gantry\n\nWild River\n\nSunrise at Campobello*\n\nJigoku\n\nAgain, Spartacus deserved this Oscar. And Campobello makes my top 5 here.\n\nMakeup:\n\nJigoku\n\nSpartacus\n\nHiroshima mon amour\n\nJust look at this.\n\nScore:\n\nPsycho\n\nSpartacus*\n\nHiroshima mon amour\n\nElmer Gantry*\n\nWild River\n\nThere’s no question for me that Psycho wins this; the shower scene is one of the most iconic pieces of film music ever written, but it’s a brilliant score all the way through. I’ve actually seen all the five of the Oscar nominees; the others are The Alamo (a solid score), the winner, Exodus (a good main theme, at least), and The Magnificent Seven (an iconic score). Alex North, who did the music for Spartacus, never did win the Oscar despite a whopping 15 nominations.\n\nSong:\n\nn/a\n\nThere’s just nothing in the films I’ve seen to qualify. The Oscar went to the title song from Never on Sunday (which is at least a good song) and “The Green Leaves of Summer” from The Alamo, so well-used at the beginning of Inglourious Basterds, was nominated (and would probably be my winner).\n\nSound Mixing:\n\nPsycho\n\nSpartacus\n\nWild River\n\nJigoku\n\nHiroshima mon amour\n\nThe Oscar went to The Alamo (as I recall, a decent choice); bizarrely, they passed over Spartacus, with its fight scenes and battles, for Sunrise at Campobello, whose sound design is hardly worth mentioning.\n\nSound Effects:\n\nPsycho\n\nSpartacus\n\nJigoku\n\nThe Bellboy\n\nThe Sundowners\n\nVisual Effects:\n\nJigoku\n\nThe Oscar went to The Time Machine, which I haven’t seen. But the Hell scenes in Jigoku have some very enjoyable effects work.\n\n1961:\n\nPicture:\n\nYojimbo\n\nSplendor in the Grass\n\nBlast of Silence\n\nThe Misfits\n\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians\n\nAnother year with a lot of big films I haven’t seen in years, including four of the five Oscar nominees (winner West Side Story, The Guns of Navarone, The Hustler, and Judgment at Nuremberg) as well as films like Breakfast at Tiffany’s, El Cid, King of Kings, One Two Three, and Pocketful of Miracles.\n\nDirector:\n\nAkira Kurosawa, Yojimbo\n\nElia Kazan, Splendor in the Grass\n\nAllen Baron, Blast of Silence\n\nJohn Huston, The Misfits\n\nMarlon Brando, One-Eyed Jacks\n\nFor now, Brando gets a nod for his only turn behind the camera – and Baron gets in for by far his most notable effort (he mostly worked in television). As in 1960, a foreign-language director beats four English-language efforts, but what Kurosawa does in Yojimbo is just breath-taking. The Oscar went to Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins for West Side Story – a very good choice as I recall, but I’ll probably stick with Kurosawa.\n\nActor:\n\nToshiro Mifune, Yojimbo\n\nClark Gable, The Misfits\n\nWarren Beatty, Splendor in the Grass\n\nVittorio De Sica, General della Rovere\n\nMarlon Brando, One-Eyed Jacks\n\nDe Sica and Brando won’t last long once I properly make room for Paul Newman (The Hustler) and Maximilian Schell (Oscar winner for Judgment). But the top three are very strong indeed, including Gable in his poignant final role.\n\nActress:\n\nNatalie Wood, Splendor in the Grass*\n\nMarilyn Monroe, The Misfits\n\nJust two nominees for now; the Oscar winner was Sophia Loren for Two Women, which I haven’t seen, nor have I seen Audrey Hepburn’s nominated performance in Breakfast at Tiffany’s (which, to be fair, I’m not that anxious to see). But I have seen Piper Laurie’s nominated turn in The Hustler, which will give Wood’s great performance a run for its money.\n\nSupporting Actor:\n\nPat Hingle, Splendor in the Grass\n\nEli Wallach, The Misfits\n\nTatsuya Nakadai, Yojimbo\n\nKarl Malden, One-Eyed Jacks\n\nLionel Stander, Blast of Silence\n\nHingle wins this pretty easily as Warren Beatty’s father; Montgomery Clift’s heartbreaking performance in Judgment will, at the very least, bump him to #2, to say nothing of George Chakiris’ Oscar-winning turn Bernardo in West Side Story and the great nominated performances by Jackie Gleason and George C. Scott in The Hustler.\n\nSpecial mention to Stander, who narrates Blast; it’s some of my favorite narration in film history.\n\nSupporting Actress:\n\nBarbara Loden, Splendor in the Grass\n\nPina Pellicer, One-Eyed Jacks\n\nIsuzu Yamada, Yojimbo\n\nBetty Lou Gerson, One Hundred and One Dalmatians\n\nThelma Ritter, The Misfits\n\nAgain, this line-up will change once I properly slot Rita Moreno (Oscar winner) and Judy Garland (Oscar nominee) in here. But Loden, who was in very few films (and directed just one, the little-seen but critically acclaimed Wanda) is fantastic as Warren Beatty’s free-spirited sister.\n\nEnsemble:\n\nSplendor in the Grass\n\nYojimbo\n\nThe Misfits\n\nOne-Eyed Jacks\n\nFor now, the great work in Splendor wins. For now.\n\nOriginal Screenplay:\n\nYojimbo\n\nBlast of Silence\n\nSplendor in the Grass**\n\nOnly three films for now, but they’re all great. One could argue Yojimbo is adapted from Red Harvest, but neither Wikipedia nor the IMDb list it as a source.\n\nSplendor won the Oscar, of course; it’s the only Oscar I’ve ever held, as screenwriter William Inge was an alum of my alma mater.\n\nAdapted Screenplay:\n\nThe Misfits\n\nOne-Eyed Jacks\n\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians\n\nGeneral della Rovere(*)\n\nThe Oscar went to Judgment at Nuremberg (a good choice) and the nominees included The Hustler and West Side Story. General della Rovere barely gets on – it’s not a great script, despite interesting elements – and while it was nominated for an Oscar, it was nominated as an original script, despite being adapted from either a short story or a novel (sources differ).\n\nCinematography:\n\nYojimbo\n\nBlast of Silence\n\nOne-Eyed Jacks*\n\nThe Misfits\n\nThe Sand Castle\n\nOne of the ironies of Jacks‘ long stint in public-domain hell is that the Oscar-nominated cinematography has been so hard to appreciate. The Criterion Collection fixed that. The Sand Castle is far from a great film (or even a very good one) but it has some neat imagery. The Oscar winners were West Side Story (very good) and The Hustler (solid).\n\nEditing:\n\nYojimbo\n\nBlast of Silence\n\nSplendor in the Grass\n\nThe Misfits\n\nAnother case where West Side Story won the Oscar, and rightly so; “Tonight” is one of the best-edited scenes I’ve ever seen. But there’s some fantastic work in Yojimbo and Blast.\n\nProduction Design:\n\nYojimbo\n\nSplendor in the Grass\n\nGeneral della Rovere\n\nOne-Eyed Jacks\n\nBlast of Silence\n\nAs with Editing, the Oscars went to West Side Story and The Hustler – two contemporary films. Yojimbo wasn’t nominated but The Absent-Minded Professor was.\n\nCostume Design:\n\nYojimbo*\n\nSplendor in the Grass\n\nBabes in Toyland*\n\nOne-Eyed Jacks\n\nGeneral della Rovere\n\nAt least Yojimbo was nominated, even if it lost the Oscar to La Dolce Vita (which I haven’t seen). The other Oscar went to West Side Story, a rare win for a contemporary film in Color Costume Design.\n\nMakeup:\n\nYojimbo\n\nBabes in Toyland\n\nOne-Eyed Jacks\n\nYes, Babes in Toyland is a stupid film, but Disney put a lot of money into it and, in some respects, it shows.\n\nScore:\n\nBlast of Silence\n\nYojimbo\n\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians\n\nThe Misfits\n\nGeneral della Rovere\n\nBlast has an awesome score by jazz musician Meyer Kupferman. The Oscar went to Henry Mancini for Breakfast at Tiffany’s, while the nominees include the great score from El Cid (and Fanny, which shouldn’t have qualified since the score itself was written for the stage musical – the film used the music but not the lyrics).\n\nIn 6th place is The Sand Castle, which is by no means a great film, but has a rather good score.\n\nSong:\n\n“Cruella De Vil,” One Hundred and One Dalmatians\n\n“Dressed in Black,” Blast of Silence\n\n“Tivoli Night,” Reptilicus\n\n“Dressed in Black” is a legitimately good song. “Tivoli Night”…it’s better than nothing. “Moon River” won the Oscar and should win this easily whenever I finally see Tiffany’s.\n\nSound Mixing:\n\nYojimbo\n\nThe Misfits\n\nBlast of Silence\n\nOne-Eyed Jacks\n\nGeneral della Rovere\n\nAnother worthy win for West Side Story, although the top three are pretty strong in their own right,\n\nSound Effects:\n\nYojimbo\n\nReptilicus\n\nGeneral della Rovere\n\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians\n\nBlast of Silence\n\nThe sound effects are by far the best thing about Reptilicus.\n\nVisual Effects:\n\nBabes in Toyland\n\nThat’s all I’ve got for now; the Oscar went to The Guns of Navarone, which is probably better.\n\n1962:\n\nPicture:\n\nLawrence of Arabia**\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nLast Year at Marienbad\n\nJules and Jim\n\nRide the High Country\n\nThe Trial\n\nCleo from 5 to 7\n\nLonely Are the Brave\n\nDivorce Italian Style\n\nNot only do I have a full 10 Picture nominees just from what I’ve ranked, but I’m working with an all-time great top 5: Lawrence is my pick for the greatest film of all time, Candidate is in my top 20, Liberty Valance might be my favorite Western ever made, Marienbad is one of the most fascinating enigmas I’ve ever seen, and Jules and Jim (which I saw only recently) is deservedly iconic. The rest of my top 10 are a bit heavy on films I need to rewatch.\n\nI’ve seen all five Best Picture nominees; Lawrence won, and is the best choice the Academy ever made, of course, but aside from The Longest Day (my current #12, a high ***), I haven’t seen the others in ages. They are The Music Man, Mutiny on the Bounty, and To Kill a Mockingbird. There are also a lot of major films I still need to see, but these lists can only get stronger; 1962 was really one of the great years in film history.\n\nDirector:\n\nDavid Lean, Lawrence of Arabia**\n\nJohn Frankenheimer, The Manchurian Candidate\n\nAlain Resnais, Last Year at Marienbad\n\nFrançois Truffaut, Jules and Jim\n\nJohn Ford, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nLean wins the Oscar, naturally, and wins with me fairly easily, though Frankenheimer and Resnais would strongly contend in most other years. I’ve actually seen two of the other Oscar nominees recently enough; Arthur Penn for The Miracle Worker and Frank Perry for David and Lisa. Neither really merited the nod, but at least Penn would earn his next nomination, in 1967; Perry, from what I’ve seen, never quite got there.\n\nThe other Oscar nominees were Pietro Germi for Divorce Italian Style – a good job of direction but outmatched in this year – and Robert Mulligan for Mockingbird.\n\nActor:\n\nPeter O’Toole, Lawrence of Arabia*\n\nFrank Sinatra, The Manchurian Candidate\n\nLaurence Harvey, The Manchurian Candidate\n\nAnthony Perkins, The Trial\n\nJames Stewart, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nO’Toole is easily my choice as well; he gives one of the greatest performances in film history. There’s a lot of competition for the remaining slots; in additional to the four above, there’s John Wayne in Liberty Valance, Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott in Ride the High Country, Kirk Douglas in Lonely Are the Brave, and Oskar Werner in Jules and Jim. And from the films I need to rewatch, there’s Oscar winner Gregory Peck in Mockingbird, Robert Preston in The Music Man, and whichever members of the Advise & Consent ensemble could be considered leads.\n\nAnd that’s before mentioning the other three Oscar nominees: Jack Lemmon in Days of Wine and Roses, Burt Lancaster in Birdman of Alcatraz, and Marcello Mastroianni in Divorce Italian Style (enjoyable but can’t crack this top 5). Just a jam-packed year.\n\nActress:\n\nAnne Bancroft, The Miracle Worker**\n\nCorinne Marchand, Cleo from 5 to 7\n\nJeanne Moreau, Jules and Jim\n\nJanet Margolin, David and Lisa\n\nDelphine Seyrig, Last Year at Marienbad\n\nA much weaker list than Actor; Bancroft is actually the only Oscar nominee I’ve seen, but she is very good indeed. She wins fairly handily; Marchand is quite good, but Moreau and Seyrig are in films more focused on the direction and writing than the acting (their roles are more enigmatic than three-dimensional), solid as they are. And Margolin is by far the best part of her film.\n\nThe other Oscar nominees were Bette Davis in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, Katherine Hepburn in Long Day’s Journey into Night, Geraldine Page in Sweet Bird of Youth, and Lee Remick in Days of Wine and Roses – none of which I’ve seen.\n\nSupporting Actor:\n\nOmar Sharif, Lawrence of Arabia*\n\nJack Hawkins, Lawrence of Arabia\n\nClaude Rains, Lawrence of Arabia\n\nLee Marvin, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nAnthony Quinn, Lawrence of Arabia\n\nIf you think this category favors Lawrence now, just remember that there’s also Anthony Quayle, José Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy, and Alec Guinness to be considered. And then you have to consider Edmond O’Brien and Andy Devine in Liberty Valance, James Gregory in The Manchurian Candidate, Walter Matthau in Lonely Are he Brave, and Orson Welles in The Trial.\n\nAnd that’s before getting into the rest of the Oscar category: winner Ed Begley in Sweet Bird of Youth, Victor Buono in Baby Jane, and Terence Stamp in Billy Budd. And, you know, all the supporting players in Advise & Consent, Brock Peters in Mockingbird, Paul Ford and Buddy Hackett in The Music Man…\n\nSupporting Actress:\n\nPatty Duke, The Miracle Worker**\n\nAngela Lansbury, The Manchurian Candidate*\n\nJanet Leigh, The Manchurian Candidate\n\nVera Miles, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nMariette Hartley, Ride the High Country\n\nAnother category where the Academy got it right; Candidate is by far the better film and Lansbury is excellent in it, but Duke’s performance as Helen Keller is just incredible. The other three nominees straddle the line between lead and supporting, but I didn’t have much else to work with. The other Oscar nominees were Mary Badham in Mockingbird (who’s really a lead), Shirley Knight in Sweet Bird, and Thelman Ritter in Birdman.\n\nEnsemble:\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nRide the High Country\n\nThe Trial\n\nIt feels a bit weird not to have The Longest Day, with one of the starriest casts in film history, on this list, but most of them are just there for their star power rather than their acting ability.\n\nOriginal Screenplay:\n\nLast Year at Marienbad*\n\nRide the High Country\n\nDivorce Italian Style**\n\nCleo from 5 to 7\n\nI’m not really surprised that Divorce beat Marienbad; it’s a far more accessible film and a very clever one. But for me, Marienbad wins by a long way. The other Oscar nominees were Freud, That Touch of Mink, and Through a Glass Darkly.\n\nAdapted Screenplay:\n\nLawrence of Arabia*\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nJules and Jim\n\nThe Trial\n\nThis, on the other hand, is one of the tightest top twos I’ve ever had. Manchurian Candidate has one of my favorite scripts ever written, with some of the most brilliantly offbeat dialogue in film history, but Lawrence is so brilliant in how it combines epic sweep, political turmoil, and personal drama that I give it the edge for the time being.\n\nThe rest of the Oscar category is a mixed bag. The winner was To Kill a Mockingbird (good, I’m sure), and they nominated Lolita, which probably deserved it, but they also nominated The Miracle Worker (solid but not great) and David and Lisa (pretty thin).\n\nCinematography:\n\nLawrence of Arabia**\n\nLast Year at Marienbad\n\nThe Trial\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate\n\nRide the High Country\n\nBack to an easy choice, with possibly the best cinematography in film history. It won the color Oscar, while The Longest Day won the black-and-white Oscar; an alright choice, but not on the level of Marienbad or Candidate.\n\nEditing:\n\nLawrence of Arabia**\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate*\n\nLast Year at Marienbad\n\nJules and Jim\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nAnother hard choice; the brainwashing demonstration in Candidate is a masterpiece of editing, but Lawrence‘s ability to hold our fascination for four hours is partly dependent on the genius of Anne V. Coates’ work (and, of course, there’s the cut from Lawrence blowing out the match to the sun rising over the desert). At least Candidate was nominated.\n\nProduction Design:\n\nLast Year at Marienbad\n\nThe Trial\n\nLawrence of Arabia**\n\nThe Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm*\n\nDivorce Italian Style\n\nIs it weird that I push Lawrence to #3? Maybe it deserves the win, but I just think of it as being so much more about the exteriors, about the glorious scenery, than about the actual sets. Marienbad, on the other hand, has magnificent design throughout, with all the ornate halls and bedrooms the characters inhabit. The black-and-white Oscar went to Mockingbird.\n\nOriginally, I had Liberty Valance as my #5, but for now I have Divorce in that spot; the crumbling mansion where most of the action takes place is really a superbly realized setting.\n\nCostume Design:\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm**\n\nJules and Jim\n\nWaltz of the Toreadors\n\nThe Miracle Worker*\n\nI can’t argue too much with Brothers Grimm winning, as it has some excellent costumes. But to not even nominate Lawrence (and to nominate Bon Voyage! and My Geisha instead) is just ridiculous. Baby Jane won the black-and-white Oscar, while Liberty Valance was nominated (its only nomination).\n\nMakeup:\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm\n\nThe Longest Day\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nWar Hunt\n\nThe use of brownface on Anthony Quinn and Alec Guinness is regrettable, but the work on Peter O’Toole throughout really helps to reinforce the grueling journey Lawrence goes on.\n\nScore:\n\nLawrence of Arabia**\n\nJules and Jim\n\nLast Year at Marienbad\n\nCleo from 5 to 7\n\nThe Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm*\n\nIt’s one of the greatest scores in film history (I think I had it at #2 behind Koyaanisqatsi), so of course it won with me and the Academy. I should note that the score for Mutiny on the Bounty, which was nominated, is really good – the best thing about the film – and will easily get a spot on this list when I rewatch it. I also considered squeezing Divorce Italian Style on here for its droll score, but decided not to.\n\nSong:\n\n“The Longest Day,” The Longest Day\n\n“Le Tourbillon,” Jules and Jim\n\n“Ah-Oom,” The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm\n\n“The Longest Day” is a really good song and I’m kind of surprised it wasn’t nominated. “Le Tourbillon” is a delightful song and does seem to have been written for the film, so it was an easy pick. “Ah-Oom” is the most memorable song in Grimm; it’s here more because I don’t have more to work with. The Oscar went to the title song from Days of Wine and Roses; one of the nominees was “Follow Me” from Mutiny on the Bounty which would probably be #3 on this list.\n\nSound Mixing:\n\nLawrence of Arabia**\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate\n\nThe Longest Day\n\nLast Year at Marienbad\n\nRide the High Country\n\nAn easy choice, what with all the battle and desert scenes. Very curious as to why Bon Voyage! and That Touch of Mink were nominated over The Longest Day.\n\nSound Effects:\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Longest Day\n\nThe Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate\n\nRide the High Country\n\nThe Academy would finally institute this category the following year, but I’m sure Lawrence or Longest Day would’ve won.\n\nVisual Effects:\n\nThe Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm\n\nThe Longest Day**\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nI actually don’t think the work in The Longest Day is that amazing (some is good, some is clunky), so I give Grimm the edge, with its Puppetoons, dragon, and so forth.\n\n1963:\n\nPicture:\n\n8½\n\nRevenge of a Kabuki Actor (also known as An Actor’s Revenge)\n\nAmerica, America*\n\nThe Haunting\n\nThe Birds\n\nBack to guesswork, with a lot of films I haven’t seen in years, and even those which appear in these lists deserve another look. Tom Jones is a particular example; it won four Oscars including Best Picture and got five acting nominations. I wasn’t a big fan when I saw it, rating it a 74 (high ***), but that was over a decade ago, and I suspect I’d find more to appreciate nowadays. On the other hand, if I rate Tom lower than most, I rate Oscar nominee Cleopatra higher than most, at a 67 (low ***). The other Picture nominees are How the West Was Won (haven’t seen recently) and Lilies of the Field (haven’t seen).\n\nOther major films I’ve seen and need to rewatch include The Cardinal, Ivan’s Childhood, The List of Adrian Messenger, The Nutty Professor, and The Sword in the Stone.\n\nDirector:\n\nFederico Fellini, 8½*\n\nKon Ichikawa, Revenge of a Kabuki Actor\n\nRobert Wise, The Haunting\n\nAlfred Hitchcock, The Birds\n\nElia Kazan, America, America*\n\nThe Oscar went to Tony Richardson for Tom Jones; I can’t imagine I’ll ever think he deserved it over Fellini, or even Kazan, who earned his final nomination after a really impressive run starting with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn in 1945. The other nominees were Martin Ritt for Hud and Otto Preminger for The Cardinal.\n\nActor:\n\nKazuo Hasegawa, Revenge of a Kabuki Actor\n\nBurt Lancaster, The Leopard\n\nMarcello Mastroianni, 8½\n\nOssie Davis, Gone Are the Days!\n\nAlbert Finney, Tom Jones*\n\nHasegawa, playing a dual role – and one of those roles being a male actor who plays female roles and presents as female offstage – is a pretty easy choice for me. The Oscar went to Sidney Poitier for Lilies of the Field, while the other nominees were Richard Harris for This Sporting Life, Rex Harrison’s Julius Caesar in Cleopatra (he is good, but not nomination-worthy), and Paul Newman in Hud.\n\nI should note that Stathis Giallelis in America, America got a Globe nomination and even earned their New Star award (along with Finney and Robert Walker Jr.), but I think his performance is the weakest aspect of the film, hence his not earning a nod from me.\n\nActress:\n\nJulie Harris, The Haunting\n\nTippi Hedren, The Birds\n\nRuby Dee, Gone Are the Days!\n\nAngie Dickinson, Captain Newman M.D.\n\nClaudia Cardinale, The Leopard\n\nElizabeth Taylor, Cleopatra\n\nI haven’t seen a single one of the Oscar nominees – winner Patricia Neal in Hud, Leslie Caron in The L-Shaped Room, Shirley MacLaine in Irma La Douce, Rachel Roberts in This Sporting Life, and Natalie Wood in Love with the Proper Stranger. Harris wins fairly easily, though Hedren and Dee are solid; I’m not sure Dickinson and Cardinale are really leads.\n\nSupporting Actor:\n\nPaul Mann, America, America\n\nJohn Marley, America, America\n\nLou Antonio, America, America\n\nBobby Darin, Captain Newman M.D.*\n\nSalem Ludwig, America, America\n\nWith its amazing supporting cast, America, America dominates this list; I really should probably bump one of them for Hugh Griffith in Tom Jones, but I’ll let a second viewing decide where he ends up. Mann was nominated for a Globe, as was Gregory Rozakis as the tragic Hohannes, but I didn’t think he was that good. I could also have made room for someone else from Captain Newman, but I might need to see that again as well.\n\nThe Oscar went to Melvyn Douglas from Hud; the other nominees were Nick Adams in Twilight of Honor, Griffith, and John Huston in The Cardinal (who I remember being good as the crotchety Glennon).\n\nSupporting Actress:\n\nLinda Marsh, America, America\n\nJessica Tandy, The Birds\n\nClaire Bloom, The Haunting\n\nSuzanne Pleshette, The Birds\n\nAyako Wakao, Revenge of a Kabuki Actor\n\nMore fine work from the America, America cast, with Marsh winning as Paul Mann’s tragically unhappy daughter and Elena Karam coming in 6th as Stathis Giallelis’ mother. I should note that Tom Jones got three nominations in this category: Joyce Redman (my #7), Edith Evans (probably should be here) and Diane Cilento (I recall her not doing much). The Oscar went to Margaret Rutherford in The V.I.P.s, and the other nominee was Lilia Skala in Lilies of the Field.\n\nEnsemble:\n\nAmerica, America\n\nThe Great Escape\n\nCaptain Newman M.D.\n\nThe Haunting\n\nRevenge of a Kabuki Actor\n\nAs with The Longest Day last year, it feels weird not to have It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World on here, especially since it allows for some actual performances among its cast (as does How the West Was Won, but I need to rewatch that). But for now, I can’t deny the wonderful cast in America – although I’m reminded that The Great Escape could probably contend for a Supporting Actor slot.\n\nOriginal Screenplay:\n\n8½*\n\nAmerica, America*\n\nIt’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\n\nElia Kazan had multiple Director nominations and wins, but this was his only writing nomination (and the Picture nomination was his only producing nomination). Despite nominating two great films (as well as The Four Days of Naples and Love with the Proper Stranger), the Academy gave the award to How the West Was Won, an ambitious script but not a great one by any means.\n\nAdapted Screenplay:\n\nRevenge of a Kabuki Actor\n\nThe Leopard\n\nThe Haunting\n\nThe Great Escape\n\nCaptain Newman M.D.*\n\nThe Oscar went to Tom Jones, probably a better choice than I gave it credit for being; the other nominees were Hud, Lilies of the Field, and Sundays and Cybele – Hud had Director, Screenplay, and three acting nominations, but somehow missed Picture. Very strange. I thought about bumping Captain Newman to 6th and slotting in The Birds, but that film is really more about the technical aspects than the writing.\n\nCinematography:\n\nRevenge of a Kabuki Actor\n\nAmerica, America\n\n8½\n\nThe Birds\n\nThe Haunting\n\nI really don’t know how Haskell Wexler’s amazing work in America, America was overlooked, given its Picture and Director nominations; the black-and-white Oscar went to Hud and the color Oscar went to Cleopatra, which looks nice, but more because the sets and costumes are so good.\n\nEditing:\n\n8½\n\nThe Haunting\n\nThe Great Escape*\n\nThe Birds\n\nRevenge of a Kabuki Actor\n\nThe Oscar went to How the West Was Won, maybe because they felt the editors, working with 3-strip Cinerama, had to edit the film three times over. All the nominees were epic-length films: The Cardinal, Cleopatra, and It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World were the others. It might be telling that four of the nominees didn’t have Director nominations.\n\nProduction Design:\n\nCleopatra**\n\nRevenge of a Kabuki Actor\n\nAmerica, America**\n\nThe Leopard\n\nTom Jones*\n\nBoth Oscar winners make my top 5, which is cool; it’s actually a very strong top 5 and The Haunting, Dr. No, and 8½ were all worthy as well (8½ was nominated).\n\nCostume Design:\n\nCleopatra**\n\nRevenge of a Kabuki Actor\n\nThe Leopard*\n\nTom Jones\n\nAmerica, America\n\nThe black-and-white Oscar went to 8½, which may well belong here, but I’ll need to see it again to judge the costuming. Kind of amazing that Tom Jones wasn’t nominated (kudos to them for nominating The Leopard, though), and very disappointing that America, America was snubbed in favor of The Stripper, Toys in the Attic, and Wives and Lovers.\n\nMakeup:\n\nRevenge of a Kabuki Actor\n\n8½\n\nCleopatra\n\nTom Jones\n\nThe Birds\n\nGee, you think a film about a literal kabuki actor might have some noteworthy makeup?\n\nScore:\n\nThe Great Escape\n\nIt’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World*\n\nCleopatra*\n\nAmerica, America\n\nDr. No\n\nAnother Oscar for Tom Jones, another snub for America, another snub for The Great Escape, and a snub for Dr. No, despite that score containing one of the most famous themes in film history (albeit one based partly on an existing song).\n\nSong:\n\n“It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World”, It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World*\n\n“Three Blind Mice,” Dr. No\n\n“Call Me Irresponsible,” Papa‘s Delicate Condition**\n\nThat’s all I’ve got for now. “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World” wins easily – it’s a really fun song. “Call Me Irresponsible” is okay, but the way it’s used in the film is bizarre; a drunk Jackie Gleason sings it to a mannequin wearing one of his wife’s dresses after she’s temporarily left him. I wonder if he performed it that way at the Oscars.\n\nSound Mixing:\n\nThe Great Escape\n\nThe Birds\n\nIt’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World*\n\nDr. No\n\nThe Haunting\n\nThe Oscar went to How the West Was Won, which is a perfectly solid choice, but why nominate Bye Bye Birdie and Captain Newman M.D. over The Great Escape?\n\nSound Effects:\n\nThe Birds\n\nThe Great Escape\n\nIt’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World**\n\nDr. No\n\nThe Haunting\n\nThe first year of this Oscar category and they make a solid choice. There was only one other nominee, the largely forgotten Air Force drama A Gathering of Eagles – I’m surprised they nominated The Birds for its visual effects but not for its brilliant sound effects.\n\nVisual Effects:\n\nDr. No\n\nIt’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\n\nThe Birds*\n\nThe Haunting\n\nThe Great Escape\n\nThe Oscar went to Cleopatra, which doesn’t really have that much in the way of effects, at least not memorable ones. The effects in The Birds haven’t aged seamlessly, but they’re still effective.\n\n1964:\n\nPicture:\n\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb*\n\nGoldfinger\n\nThe Americanization of Emily\n\nRed Desert\n\nFrom Russia with Love\n\nSeven Days in May\n\nThe Three Lives of Thomasina\n\nRobinson Crusoe on Mars\n\n7 Faces of Dr. Lao\n\nTopkapi\n\nThis year is particularly affected by doing additional research on what was eligible when. Originally I had Kwaidan on this list, in 5th place, but on discovering it actually belonged in 1965, had to shift all its nominations to that year – and then I had to bring From Russia with Love from 1963 to this year, which was to the detriment of 1963 but was welcome here.\n\nThis year will also change in the future as I rewatch a lot of major films; I’ve seen all five Picture nominees, but only one other factors into these lists, and unfortunately, I rate Zorba the Greek as a low *** and it only pops up in a few categories. The Oscar winner, My Fair Lady, was a great favorite of mine at one time, and Mary Poppins is a true classic; the fifth nominee was Becket, which I remember being quite solid. None are likely to dethrone Dr. Strangelove, however; it’s in my all-time top 10.\n\nOther major films I need to rewatch include Cheyenne Autumn, The Fall of the Roman Empire, A Fistful of Dollars, A Hard Day’s Night, Marnie, Sallah Shabati, and The World of Henry Orient.\n\nDirector:\n\nStanley Kubrick, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb*\n\nMichelangelo Antonioni, Red Desert\n\nGuy Hamilton, Goldfinger\n\nArthur Hiller, The Americanization of Emily\n\nJohn Frankenheimer, Seven Days in May\n\nThe Oscar went to George Cukor for My Fair Lady – not as good a choice as Kubrick would’ve been, but understandable. At least Kubrick was nominated; Frankenheimer, who easily got in 1962 and will appear once again in 1966, never was. The other Oscar nominees were Robert Stevenson for Mary Poppins (good), Peter Glenville for Becket (sure), and Michael Cacoyannis for Zorba (no).\n\nActor:\n\nPeter Sellers, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb*\n\nAnthony Quinn, Zorba the Greek*\n\nJames Garner, The Americanization of Emily\n\nSean Connery, Goldfinger\n\nTony Randall, 7 Faces of Dr. Lao\n\nQuinn is by far the best thing about Zorba (well, there’s one another great aspect I’ll mention later), but he can’t beat Sellers’ all-time great performance as the veddy-British Mandrake, the nebbishy Muffley, and the absurdly German Strangelove. The other three are good but just filling space for now; the Oscar winner, Rex Harrison for My Fair Lady, and nominees Richard Burton and Peter O’Toole in Becket, will probably bump them.\n\nActress:\n\nMonica Vitti, Red Desert\n\nJulie Andrews, The Americanization of Emily\n\nBarbara Barrie, One Potato, Two Potato\n\nHonor Blackman, Goldfinger\n\nOn the other hand, I’ve only ever seen the Oscar winner, Andrews in Mary Poppins; the other nominees were Anne Bancroft in The Pumpkin Eater, Sophia Loren in Marriage Italian Style, Debbie Reynolds in The Unsinkable Molly Brown, and Kim Stanley in Seance on a Wet Afternoon. Barrie won Best Actress at Cannes; the Globe nominees included Jean Seberg in Lilith, who I didn’t think was that good (but neither is the film) and Melina Mercouri in Topkapi (who isn’t that great either).\n\nVitti wins this handily; I was very impressed by Desert and her performance as the protagonist, struggling to adapt to the industrial landscape of modern Italy, is a big part of why.\n\nSupporting Actor:\n\nSterling Hayden, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nGeorge C. Scott, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nFredric March, Seven Days in May\n\nJames Coburn, The Americanization of Emily\n\nEdmond O’Brien, Seven Days in May*\n\nSome would consider Scott a lead, and he’d come in 3rd if I did, but I think he’s supporting. It’s harder to pick between him and Hayden; Hayden is as deadpan as Scott is hammy and they’re both perfect in their respective ways. March was considered a lead at the Globes, but I think most would put him here, and I rate him even higher than Oscar nominee O’Brien from the same film (and if I see the film again, there might be some other contenders for this list).\n\nThe Oscar went to Peter Ustinov for Topkapi, who’s solid but not, in my view, better than any of my picks (or Slim Pickens in Strangelove). The other nominees were Stanley Holloway in My Fair Lady (who’s really fun), John Gielgud in Becket, and Lee Tracy in The Best Man, which I’ve seen parts of and liked.\n\nSupporting Actress:\n\nElizabeth Ashley, The Carpetbaggers\n\nAva Gardner, Seven Days in May\n\nLotte Lenya, From Russia with Love\n\nMartha Hyer, The Carpetbaggers\n\nVinnette Carroll, One Potato, Two Potato\n\nThis is all I have for now, I’m afraid; most of the films I’ve got on my lists just don’t have much in terms of supporting actresses. (I guess Honor Blackman could be pushed here if I felt like it, but these lists should be a lot stronger in the future.) Ironically, the Oscar went to Lila Kedrova for Zorba, but I was not a particular fan of her performance; the other nominees were Gladys Cooper as Rex Harrison’s mother in My Fair Lady, Edith Evans in The Chalk Garden, Grayson Hall in Night of the Iguana, and Agnes Moorehead in Hush…Hush, Sweet Charlotte.\n\nEnsemble:\n\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nSeven Days in May\n\nThe Americanization of Emily\n\nThe Carpetbaggers\n\nGoldfinger\n\nBetween Sellers, Hayden, Scott, Pickens, and Peter Bull, Strangelove squeaks out a win, at least for now.\n\nOriginal Screenplay:\n\nRed Desert\n\nThat’s all I’ve got; One Potato, Two Potato was nominated for an Oscar, but the script is really quite flawed. I’m sure A Hard Day’s Night, which was nominated, is easily the strongest of the nominees, but the Oscar went to Father Goose; the other nominees were The Organizer and That Man from Rio.\n\nAdapted Screenplay:\n\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb*\n\nThe Americanization of Emily\n\nSeven Days in May\n\nGoldfinger\n\nRobinson Crusoe on Mars\n\nMuch, much better, with possibly the best adapted screenplay ever written taking top honors from me. The Academy went with Becket, a more respectable choice; the other nominees were the other Picture nominees, which means the script for Zorba, a key part of my dislike of the film, was nominated.\n\nI should mention that Americanization of Emily is written by Paddy Chayefsky, and it’s a brilliant, incredibly underappreciated satire of military values; Robinson Crusoe on Mars may seem a bizarre choice, but it’s actually quite a good film, a very clever adaptation of Defoe’s novel to a science-fiction setting. I really should rewatch it one of these days.\n\nCinematography:\n\nRed Desert\n\nRobinson Crusoe on Mars\n\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nLilith\n\nGoldfinger\n\nThe color Oscar went to My Fair Lady (like Cleopatra, it’s the production values that really make the film look good) and the black-and-white Oscar went to Zorba, which wasn’t especially deserved. Americanization of Emily was nominated, and would’ve been at least a better choice, but why they snubbed Dr. Strangelove is beyond me. Red Desert, in any case, looks amazing; it was Antonioni’s first color film and he made fascinating use of it.\n\nEditing:\n\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nGoldfinger\n\nFrom Russia with Love\n\nSeven Days in May\n\nThe Americanization of Emily\n\nAgain, how was Strangelove, which moves so perfectly between the three plot threads, not nominated but Father Goose was? The Oscar went to Mary Poppins.\n\nProduction Design:\n\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nRed Desert\n\nGoldfinger\n\nThe Three Lives of Thomasina\n\nRobinson Crusoe on Mars\n\nJust ridiculous. Americanization and Seven Days in May actually earned nominations; neither were great picks, but they’d have been better than Zorba, which won the black-and-white Oscar. The color Oscar went to My Fair Lady, a very good choice, but even when I rewatch it it’ll have to compete with the magnificent War Room set (and the bomber interior which had to be created with only a single photo as reference).\n\nCostume Design:\n\nThe Carpetbaggers\n\n7 Faces of Dr. Lao\n\nThe Three Lives of Thomasina\n\nRed Desert\n\nRight now, I don’t have much; Red Desert barely gets on here. The color Oscar went to My Fair Lady, of course, while the black-and-white Oscar went to Night of the Iguana.\n\nMakeup:\n\n7 Faces of Dr. Lao**\n\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nRobinson Crusoe on Mars\n\nWhile it would be another 17 years until the permanent makeup category was established, there were two special awards given in the 60s. Dr. Lao was the first, and the work on Tony Randall in his multiple roles certainly merited it.\n\nScore:\n\nZorba the Greek\n\nTopkapi\n\nGoldfinger\n\nLilith\n\nThe Golden Head\n\nThe Academy ate Zorba up, gave it nominations and wins it didn’t deserve, and what does it do with the great music that actually deserved a nomination? Snubs it. The Globes did nominate it, displaying a rare shred of common sense. The Oscar went to Mary Poppins, which is hard to argue with, but I might have to give my award, when the time comes, to the great score (which won the Globe and was Oscar-nominated) for Fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nSong:\n\n“Goldfinger,” Goldfinger\n\n“From Russia with Love,” From Russia with Love\n\nObviously rewatching Mary Poppins will help a great deal here; my own favorite songs there are “Let’s Go Fly a Kite” and “Feed the Birds,” but they’re all great. A Hard Day’s Night has some great songs as well, including the title song and “If I Fell.” The Oscar went to “Chim Chim Cher-ee” while the Globe went to, of all things, the title song from Circus World.\n\nI will say, I hope I don’t have to bump “Goldfinger” from my top 5, as it’s the first great Bond theme song.\n\nSound Mixing:\n\nGoldfinger\n\nRed Desert\n\nFrom Russia with Love\n\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nSeven Days in May\n\nThe Oscar went to My Fair Lady. Goldfinger wasn’t nominated, which is doubly ridiculous in light of the next category.\n\nSound Effects:\n\nRed Desert\n\nGoldfinger**\n\nRobinson Crusoe on Mars\n\nFrom Russia with Love\n\nThe Americanization of Emily\n\nWhile I go with the effects used to create the sense of alienation via industrialization in Red Desert, Goldfinger was a great choice for the Oscar; the other nominee was a racing film called The Lively Set. Don’t overlook the excellent work in Crusoe.\n\nVisual Effects:\n\n7 Faces of Dr. Lao*\n\nGoldfinger\n\nThe Three Lives of Thomasina\n\nRobinson Crusoe on Mars\n\nNot a bad list, actually, but Lao is a pretty hard winner to argue with; the Oscar went to Mary Poppins, which will probably snag the top spot when I go back to it.\n\n1965:\n\nPicture:\n\nWoman in the Dunes\n\nThe Collector\n\nKwaidan\n\nTokyo Olympiad\n\nThe Loved One\n\nThis year is a bit frustrating. I’ve seen three of the Oscar nominees, albeit none recently – winner The Sound of Music, Doctor Zhivago, and the fairly obscure A Thousand Clowns (the other two nominees were Darling and Ship of Fools). But as the next category will make clear, they could’ve beefed that category up considerably. As of now, Woman wins this easily; it’s a magnificent existential enigma of a film. But with that, Kwaidan, and Tokyo Olympiad, it’s a hell of a year for Japanese cinema. Pushing Kwaidan into this year helps a great deal; it bumps The Cincinnati Kid, a solid film, but one I don’t remember that well.\n\nOther major films I haven’t seen recently include The Agony and the Ecstasy, Cat Ballou, The Great Race, The Greatest Story Ever Told, The Pawnbroker, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.\n\nDirector:\n\nHiroshi Teshigahara, Woman in the Dunes*\n\nWilliam Wyler, The Collector*\n\nMasaki Kobayashi, Kwaidan\n\nTony Richardson, The Loved One\n\nNorman Jewison, The Cincinnati Kid\n\nHere’s where my frustration really kicks in. The Academy (well, the directors) very wisely nominated Teshigahara, the first Japanese nominee, for his brilliant work, and gave Wyler his 12th nomination (he’s the only person so far to have reached double digits) for his fantastic psychological thriller but nominated neither film for Picture. It would take 56 years for a Japanese film to be nominated, and while Wyler would get one more Picture nomination before he retired, it was for Funny Girl in 1968 – a film nowhere near as good as The Collector.\n\nAnd yes, Richardson gets into my top 5 here despite not getting a nomination for his Oscar-winning direction two years ago.\n\nActor:\n\nTerence Stamp, The Collector\n\nEiji Okada, Woman in the Dunes\n\nLaurence Olivier, Othello*\n\nNorman Alden, Andy\n\nEugene Troobnick, Harvey Middleman, Fireman\n\nNeither Andy nor Harvey Middleman are great films, but Alden is very strong and Troobnick is quite solid. Stamp’s portrayal of the creepy young collector is pretty hard to beat, however, though Okada (back again after Hiroshima mon amour) is very good as the man who finds himself trapped in the dunes.\n\nThe Oscar went to Lee Marvin for Cat Ballou; I’m a fan of Marvin but I remember hating that film and not being all that wild about his work in it. The other nominees were Richard Burton in Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Rod Steiger in The Pawnbroker (both very good, as I recall), and Oskar Werner in Ship of Fools.\n\nActress:\n\nKiyōko Kishida, Woman in the Dunes\n\nSamantha Eggar, The Collector*\n\nAnna Karina, Alphaville\n\nKishida is amazing as the titular woman, whose attitude towards her situation is part of the enigmatic fascination of that film. Eggar is really good as well (she actually won the Globe) as the girl Terence Stamp “collects.” Karina I remember being charming in a film I didn’t really love, but really should rewatch.\n\nThe Oscar went to Julie Christie for Darling, and the other nominees were Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music, Elizabeth Hartman in A Patch of Blue, and Simone Signoret in Ship of Fools.\n\nSupporting Actor:\n\nRod Steiger, The Loved One\n\nKatsuo Nakamura, Kwaidan\n\nHardy Kruger, The Flight of the Phoenix\n\nEdward G. Robinson, The Cincinnati Kid\n\nFrank Finlay, Othello*\n\nSteiger’s performance here is wildly different from his work in The Pawnbroker; there he plays an emotionally shattered Holocaust survivor, and here he plays an eccentric mortician and profound mama’s boy. (It’s a farce and a half.) Nakamaura is Hoichi the Earless, protagonist of the third and longest story in Kwaidan; Kruger was nominated for a Globe, but refused the nomination for some reason, and the Academy nominated Ian Bannen instead, who wasn’t especially memorable (Richard Attenborough would’ve been a better choice).\n\nFinlay is Iago, and he’s decent, but I found him just a touch flat compared to Olivier, who really tears into the role of the Moor. The Oscar went to Martin Balsam for A Thousand Clowns; the other nominees were Tom Courtenay in Doctor Zhivago and Michael Dunn in Ship of Fools.\n\nSupporting Actress:\n\nMaggie Smith, Othello*\n\nJoyce Redman, Othello*\n\nKeiko Kishi, Kwaidan\n\nJoan Blondell, The Cincinnati Kid\n\nAyllene Gibbons, The Loved One\n\nIf it weren’t for the Academy, Smith would go lead and be an easy nominee (she’s Desdemona, of course). Redman is the tragic Emilia, Kishi is the fearsome Woman of the Snows, veteran Blondell (who won the NBR) is the wisecracking Lady Fingers, and Gibbons is Steiger’s mother, who loves food (and food commercials) more than anything.\n\nThe Oscar went to Shelley Winters for A Patch of Blue; the other nominees were Ruth Gordon in Inside Daisy Clover and Peggy Wood as the Mother Abbess in Sound of Music.\n\nEnsemble:\n\nThe Loved One\n\nOthello\n\nThe Cincinnati Kid\n\nThe Flight of the Phoenix\n\nThose Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\n\nSince Woman in the Dunes and The Collector are essentially two-handers, the larger casts in these films rise to the top. The Loved One has an especially wild cast: Robert Morse, Jonathan Winters, Paul Williams, Anjanette Comer, Steiger, John Gielgud, Robert Morley, Roddy MacDowall, James Coburn, Milton Berle, Dana Andrews, Tab Hunter, Lionel Stander, and Liberace.\n\nOriginal Screenplay:\n\nn/a\n\nThe only film I even considered from what I’ve got on hand is Andy. The Oscar went to Darling; the nominees were Casanova 70, Those Magnificent Men (a fun film but I just don’t think the writing is strong enough), The Train (possibly should count as an adapted script), and Umbrellas of Cherbourg (which I remember being underwhelmed by).\n\nAdapted Screenplay:\n\nThe Collector*\n\nWoman in the Dunes\n\nThe Loved One\n\nThe Cincinnati Kid\n\nKwaidan\n\nI’m not sure whether to go with The Collector or Woman here. I remember the writing in Woman being just a bit weaker than the direction but still strong. Either way, those two scripts are by far the strongest here.\n\nThe Oscar went to Doctor Zhivago, and the other nominees were Cat Ballou (a terrible choice), Ship of Fools, and A Thousand Clowns. The Sound of Music was the last Picture winner until Titanic to win without a Screenplay nomination. It hasn’t happened again since.\n\nCinematography:\n\nWoman in the Dunes\n\nKwaidan\n\nTokyo Olympiad\n\nAlphaville\n\nThe Collector\n\nThe only Oscar nominee from either category I’ve even seen recently is In Harm’s Way, which is a pretty mediocre film, although the cinematography is passable. The Oscar winners were Doctor Zhivago and Ship of Fools. Another nod for Alphaville, which does have very good cinematography as I recall. But the three Japanese films – one black-and-white and set amongst sand dunes, one in color and heavily stylized, one in color and mixing documentary aspects with avant-garde flourishes – rightfully dominate. (Again, it’s really a shame that, aside from the Director nod, the Academy didn’t show Woman more love.)\n\nEditing:\n\nTokyo Olympiad\n\nThe Collector\n\nWoman in the Dunes\n\nThunderball\n\nKwaidan\n\nThe flair of Olympiad extends to the editing, which is really superb, even given the film’s nearly three-hour length. The only Oscar nominee that I’ve recently seen is Flight of the Phoenix, an odd choice since the editing isn’t really that good. The Oscar went to The Sound of Music (also an odd choice), and the nominees included Cat Ballou, which is just ludicrous.\n\nProduction Design:\n\nKwaidan\n\nThe Collector\n\nThe Cincinnati Kid\n\nOthello\n\nWoman in the Dunes\n\nThe sets in Kwaidan are a great mixture of medieval Japanese splendor and overt stylization. I’m not saying they won’t eventually lose the top spot to the Oscar-winning work in Doctor Zhivago, but I doubt they’ll fall out of my top 5. The other Oscar went to Ship of Fools.\n\nCostume Design:\n\nKwaidan\n\nOthello\n\nThose Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\n\nThe Cincinnati Kid\n\nMore fantastic Japanese costumes, Shakespearean costumes for Othello, Edwardian costumes for Magnificent Men, and 30s costumes for Cincinnati Kid). Still no Oscar nominees on my current lists – the Oscars went with Zhivago and the fashion-world outfits in Darling.\n\nMakeup:\n\nKwaidan\n\nThe Flight of the Phoenix\n\nOthello\n\nWoman in the Dunes\n\nThis version of Othello is controversial owing to Olivier’s use of blackface in the title role; it’s executed as well as possible, but it’s skilled work in the service of a problematic end. Luckily, I can put it well behind the great work in Kwaidan and the faces of the men in Phoenix as the desert takes its toll on them.\n\nScore:\n\nThose Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\n\nWoman in the Dunes\n\nThe Collector\n\nTokyo Olympiad\n\nThe Flight of the Phoenix\n\nThunderball\n\nMaurice Jarr won the Oscar for Zhivago (one of the most famous scores of all time), but for now he comes in 3rd for a very different score – and behind Ron Goodwin and Toru Takemitsu, neither of whom were ever nominated.\n\nSong:\n\n“Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines,” Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\n\n“Thunderball,” Thunderball\n\n“Those Magnificent Men” wins this easily – “Thunderball” is good, but more for Tom Jones’ rendition than for the actual song. He also sang one of Oscar nominees, “What’s New, Pussycat?” (from the film of the same name), but the winner was “The Shadow of Your Smile” from The Sandpiper.\n\nAnd while it’s not a good song, try not to get the title song from Fun in Balloon Land stuck in your head.\n\nSound Mixing:\n\nThunderball\n\nWoman in the Dunes\n\nTokyo Olympiad\n\nKwaidan\n\nThe Flight of the Phoenix\n\nNot sure why The Agony and the Ecstasy was considered a better choice for a nomination than Thunderball, but whatever. The Oscar went to The Sound of Music, the most aptly titled winner this side of Sound of Metal.\n\nSound Effects:\n\nWoman in the Dunes\n\nThunderball\n\nThe Flight of the Phoenix\n\nThose Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\n\nKwaidan\n\nThe Oscar went to The Great Race (an okay choice, but not necessarily better than some of these films), and the other nominee was Von Ryan’s Express.\n\nVisual Effects:\n\nKwaidan\n\nThunderball**\n\nThe Flight of the Phoenix\n\nHere, on the other hand, I have seen the winner, and it’s a solid choice, though I give the edge to Kwaidan. The other Oscar nominee was The Greatest Story Ever Told, which I don’t really get.\n\n1966:\n\nPicture:\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*\n\nSeconds\n\nBlack Girl\n\nA Man and a Woman\n\nKhartoum\n\nI’ve seen three of these films in the last year or so (#1, #3, and #4), which helps this year out a good deal. It also helps that, on going back to it, Virginia Woolf absolutely blew me away – it’s one of the greatest films ever made, as the rest of these awards will make clear.\n\nI’ve seen all five Oscar nominees, and three factor into these lists: Virginia Woolf, the winner, A Man for All Seasons (right now my #7, a low ***½, but probably at least a mid-high ***½), and The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, right now my #10, a mid ***. The other two are Alfie (which I quite like) and The Sand Pebbles (pretty solid).\n\nOther major films I’ve seen but need to rewatch include Andrei Rublev (which is a hard film to decide on a year for), Au Hasard Balthazar, The Bible: In the Beginning…, The Blue Max, Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round, The Fortune Cookie, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Grand Prix, Is Paris Burning?, The Professionals, and Torn Curtain.\n\nDirector:\n\nMike Nichols, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*\n\nJohn Frankenheimer, Seconds\n\nOusmane Sembène, Black Girl\n\nClaude Lelouch, A Man and a Woman*\n\nRichard Lester, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\n\nYet another nomination for Frankenheimer, who does a hell of a job here, but I have to give Nichols the win for bringing the play to such cinematic life – and for making one of the great directorial debuts in film history. Fred Zinnemann won his second Oscar for A Man for All Seasons, but the direction isn’t really the strength of that film (he’s my #6); it’s more about the acting and the script. The other Oscar nominees were Richard Brooks for The Professionals (which I remember not being a big fan of), and Michelangelo Antonioni for Blowup.\n\nActor:\n\nRichard Burton, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*\n\nPaul Scofield, A Man for All Seasons**\n\nRock Hudson, Seconds\n\nMax von Sydow, Hawaii\n\nCharlton Heston, Khartoum\n\nScofield is very good, but Burton gives one of the greatest performances of all time as George, the henpecked husband who’s not as helpless as he seems. It’s too bad Hudson and Heston didn’t get any attention for their performances, but at least they had some Oscar attention to their names. von Sydow was nominated for a Globe; it would be over 20 years before he’d get his first Oscar nomination.\n\nThe other Oscar nominees were the leads of the other three Picture nominees; Alan Arkin in The Russians Are Coming (not, as I recall, a very memorable performance), Michael Caine in Alfie (a brilliant performance), and Steve McQueen for The Sand Pebbles (his only nomination, and as I recall, he’s decent).\n\nActress:\n\nElizabeth Taylor, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?**\n\nAnouk Aimée, A Man a Woman*\n\nJulie Andrews, Hawaii\n\nAn easy win for Taylor, who gives an all-time great performance as Martha; Andrews is solid but is only here because I don’t have anyone else. The other nominees were Ida Kamińska in The Shop on Main Street, Lynn Redgrave for Georgy Girl, and her sister Vanessa for Morgan!\n\nSupporting Actor:\n\nGeorge Segal, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*\n\nJohn Randolph, Seconds\n\nRobert Shaw, A Man for All Seasons*\n\nMax von Sydow, The Quiller Memorandum\n\nWill Geer, Seconds\n\nYet another win for Virginia Woolf, this one for Segal as the younger man who endures an evening of fun and games at George and Martha’s. Randolph plays the protagonist for the first act of Seconds; surgery turns him into Rock Hudson for the rest of the film. Shaw, who was somehow only nominated once, plays the boisterous Henry VIII, von Sydow (playing against Segal, coincidentally) is always good, and Geer is very effective in his two-scene role as the man behind “the Company” in Seconds.\n\nThe Oscar went to Walter Matthau for The Fortune Cookie (probably a co-lead, but I remember him being good), and the other nominees were Mako in The Sand Pebbles (whom I recall being okay but not having much to do) and James Mason in Georgy Girl.\n\nSupporting Actress:\n\nSandy Dennis, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?**\n\nJocelyne LaGarde, Hawaii*\n\nJean Simmons, Mister Buddwing\n\nSuzanne Pleshette, Mister Buddwing\n\nSusannah York, A Man for All Seasons\n\nAnd that’s a clean sweep for the Woolf cast, with Dennis easily winning my award as the younger woman who has too much to drink before anyone else and can “dance like the wind.” LaGarde, in her only film role, is memorable as Ali’i Nui Malama. Simmons and Pleshette are the best parts of the middling Buddwing. Wendy Hiller actually got the nomination for Man as Thomas More’s wife, but I don’t remember her being that strong, and for now I go with York as his devoted daughter.\n\nThe other Oscar nominees were Vivien Merchant as the most tragic of Alfie‘s conquests, and Geraldine Page in the early Francis Ford Coppola film (a comedy, no less) You’re a Big Boy Now.\n\nEnsemble:\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\n\nA Man for All Seasons\n\nSeconds\n\nA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\n\nHawaii\n\nYes, Virginia Woolf has just the four performances, but when they’re that good and play off each other so well, there’s no other choice.\n\nOriginal Screenplay:\n\nA Man and a Woman**\n\nKhartoum*\n\nIt’s a thin year for original scripts and the Oscar nominees reflect that; A Man is fairly well-written but would at best be 5th in Adapted. Khartoum also has a solid script, but in a good year wouldn’t come near a nomination (from me or the Academy). The other nominees were The Fortune Cookie (a very good script), The Naked Prey (a mediocre film with very little dialogue), and Blowup.\n\nAdapted Screenplay:\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*\n\nBlack Girl\n\nA Man for All Seasons**\n\nSeconds\n\nA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\n\nIf I considered Black Girl an original script, it would easily win, but it appears to have been based on a previous work by Sembene, so it has to come in second to Ernest Lehman’s brilliant adaptation of Edward Albee’s brilliant play. I can’t argue too much with the Oscar for Seasons (Robert Bolt winning his second award in a row, this time for adapting his own play), as the dialogue is very strong throughout.\n\nThe other nominees were Alfie (very good), The Professionals (don’t remember it well enough), and The Russians Are Coming (meh).\n\nCinematography:\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?**\n\nSeconds*\n\nA Man and a Woman\n\nKhartoum\n\nThe Quiller Memorandum\n\nIn the last year of the black-and-white/color tech split, the Academy actually makes a very good choice, giving Haskell Wexler the black-and-white award for his brilliant work on Woolf, and nominating veteran James Wong Howe for his fascinating work on Seconds. The color Oscar went to A Man for All Seasons, a fairly blah choice; I’m surprised Khartoum didn’t get any tech nods, given that the script was nominated.\n\nEditing:\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*\n\nA Man and a Woman\n\nSeconds\n\nBlack Girl\n\nA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\n\nThe Oscar went to Grand Prix, which does have some very impressive editing in the race scenes. Given the relatively weak nominees otherwise (the middling Fantastic Voyage, the overlong The Russians Are Coming, the solid but very long The Sand Pebbles) the nomination for Woolf feels almost like a fluke. But then, it managed to get pretty much every nomination possible.\n\nProduction Design:\n\nKhartoum\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?**\n\nA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\n\nSeconds\n\nA Man for All Seasons\n\nAgain, the Academy managed to make a good choice in the black-and-white category; George and Martha’s house is an excellent set. But they didn’t even nominate A Man for All Seasons, let alone Khartoum, and gave the color Oscar to Fantastic Voyage while nominating the schlocky The Oscar.\n\nCostume Design:\n\nA Man for All Seasons**\n\nKhartoum\n\nA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\n\nHawaii*\n\nBlack Girl\n\nThe color Oscar was a good choice, at least, but nominating Gambit and The Oscar over Khartoum and Funny Thing? That’s another matter. The black-and-white Oscar went to Virginia Woolf, and the costumes are serviceable, but they probably should’ve gone with The Gospel According to St. Matthew (the only Pasolini film ever to get Oscar nominations).\n\nMakeup:\n\nA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\n\nA Man for All Seasons\n\nBatman\n\nKhartoum\n\nHawaii\n\nAncient Roman grotesques, 16th-century English aristocracy, comic-book heroes and villains, a milder version of Laurence Olivier in blackface (plus war injuries and exposure to the desert), and a mix of aging makeup and ritual self-mutilation.\n\nScore:\n\nA Man and a Woman\n\nKhartoum\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*\n\nSeconds\n\nMister Buddwing\n\nI’m really surprised, given how popular the score for A Man and a Woman was (and is – you still hear the main theme from time to time) that it wasn’t nominated. It’s a close win over Khartoum, but Oscar nominee The Bible has a brilliant score and will likely be my winner once I rewatch it. The Oscar winner was Born Free.\n\nI should also note that A Funny Thing Happened won the Oscar for Scoring – Adaptation or Treatment, and the nominees included Stop the World – I Want to Get Off!, which is referenced in the film Benediction, which I saw just the other day.\n\nSong:\n\n“A Man and a Woman,” A Man and a Woman\n\nThe Oscar winner was “Born Free,” and “Alfie” was nominated; the Globe winner was “Strangers in the Night,” which might not have been Oscar eligible for various reasons. Again, I’m surprised the Academy didn’t nominate the theme from A Man and a Woman; it’s certainly held up better than “A Time for Love” from An American Dream or “My Wishing Doll” from Hawaii, a brief song that’s there only so Julie Andrews could do a little singing.\n\nSound Mixing:\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*\n\nSeconds\n\nKhartoum\n\nHawaii*\n\nTokyo Drifter\n\nThe Oscar went to Grand Prix, a wholly deserving choice. For now, the verbal battles of Virginia Woolf make a suitable winner.\n\nSound Effects:\n\nKhartoum\n\nBatman\n\nTokyo Drifter\n\nSeconds\n\nFantastic Voyage*\n\nAnother well-deserved Oscar for Grand Prix. Here, at least, Fantastic Voyage deserved a nomination.\n\nVisual Effects:\n\nFantastic Voyage**\n\nKhartoum\n\nI really should rewatch Voyage. I remember not being all that impressed by the effects, but they’re good enough to win in a very weak year for them. The other Oscar nominee was Hawaii, which says more about what they had to work with than the actual effects.\n\n1967:\n\nPicture:\n\nPersona\n\nBonnie and Clyde*\n\nThe Graduate*\n\nPoint Blank\n\nIn the Heat of the Night**\n\nSpring Night Summer Night\n\nA Man Vanishes\n\nA Time for Burning\n\nDavid Holzman’s Diary\n\nFunnyman\n\nThis year took a step up when I saw Persona and was able to expand this list to 10. I’ve seen most of these films recently, and most of them are very good – only the top five are ****, but the top three all score over a 90, and if Bonnie was the best of the nominees (followed closely by The Graduate) Heat was a very solid Oscar choice. The other Oscar nominees were Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (#11) and Doctor Dolittle, which I saw years ago (I do remember it being better than its rather poor reputation).\n\nOther major films I need to rewatch in this year include Camelot, Cool Hand Luke, The Dirty Dozen, Far From the Madding Crowd, Fitzwilly (not certain I’ve actually seen the whole thing), Marat/Sade, Playtime, and Thoroughly Modern Millie.\n\nThis is also an interesting year in that the top four films are established classics, but they’re followed by a film that wasn’t even really given a real release at the time, and wasn’t widely known until decades later, a Japanese film which starts out as a documentary but develops into something rather different, a more traditional documentary, an experimental independent film that also wasn’t widely released at the time (but has achieved classic status), an independent film that has never been widely seen, and finally another established classic.\n\nI should also note that Persona was released in 1966 in Sweden and was the Oscar submission for Foreign Film (of course, it wasn’t nominated), but it was released this year in the States and won several NSFC awards. I could keep it in 1966, but then it would be a distant second to Virginia Woolf in Picture and Director, and the only awards it would contend for would be Original Screenplay (an easy win) and Cinematography (not necessarily).\n\nDirector:\n\nIngmar Bergman, Persona\n\nMike Nichols, The Graduate**\n\nJohn Boorman, Point Blank\n\nArthur Penn, Bonnie and Clyde*\n\nJoseph L. Anderson, Spring Night Summer Night\n\nEven if Bergman’s fascinating experimentation takes top honors, Nichols’ Oscar-winning work is inspired; it does mean Norman Jewison is the first director to direct the Oscar winner and lose director since 1956, but he doesn’t even make my top 5 (he’s #6). The other nominees were Stanley Kramer for Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (not especially memorable) and Richard Brooks for In Cold Blood, which I haven’t seen.\n\nApologies also to Shohei Imamura, who diverges enough from the documentary norm to merit mention for A Man Vanishes; he’s now my #7.\n\nActor:\n\nDustin Hoffman, The Graduate*\n\nSidney Poitier, In the Heat of the Night\n\nRod Steiger, In the Heat of the Night**\n\nWarren Beatty, Bonnie and Clyde*\n\nLee Marvin, Point Blank\n\nI’m kind of glad Hoffman is so good, because it spares me having to pick between Poitier and Steiger, who are equally fantastic. Poitier actually had a banner year this year, also having Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (I’m still not sure if he’s lead or supporting there) and To Sir, with Love, but the Oscars snubbed him for all three. Baffling.\n\nThe other Oscar nominees were Spencer Tracy in Guess Who’s Coming (who came very near my top 5) and Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke. I also have to mention my #6, Peter Bonerz in Funnyman, who’s really fantastic in a film I spent years trying to find.\n\nActress:\n\nFaye Dunaway, Bonnie and Clyde*\n\nAnne Bancroft, The Graduate*\n\nBibi Andersson, Persona\n\nLiv Ullman, Persona\n\nKatherine Hepburn, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner**\n\nA fantastic top four; I give Dunaway top honors, but Bancroft is also brilliant (although she’s really supporting – she’d win that category easily), and Andersson and Ullman are both very strong in their very different roles. There’s a drop to Hepburn, who’s fine, but didn’t need to win here.\n\nThe other Oscar nominees were Edith Evans in The Whisperers and Audrey Hepburn in Wait Until Dark – she was also in Two for the Road, which some might consider the better performance.\n\nSupporting Actor:\n\nMichael J. Pollard, Bonnie and Clyde*\n\nSidney Poitier, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner\n\nGene Hackman, Bonnie and Clyde*\n\nMurray Hamilton, The Graduate\n\nWarren Oates, In the Heat of the Night\n\nFor now, at least, I’ve got Poitier here; he’s certainly more deserving than the actual Oscar nominee from that film, Cecil Kellaway. And while most prefer Hackman, I actually found myself more impressed by Pollard’s performance as the guileless Moss.\n\nThe Oscar went to George Kennedy in Cool Hand Luke (certainly a good performance) and the other nominee was John Cassavetes in The Dirty Dozen (more as a representative of the ensemble, I think).\n\nSupporting Actress:\n\nBeah Richards, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner*\n\nKatherine Ross, The Graduate*\n\nEstelle Parsons, Bonnie and Clyde**\n\nAngie Dickinson, Point Blank\n\nSharon Acker, Point Blank\n\nParsons won the Oscar, but I can understand to a degree the real Blanche Barrow’s frustration at being made to look like “a screaming horse’s ass,” and give my award to Richards’ far subtler performance as Sidney Poitier’s mother, with Ross’ Elaine Robinson a close second (she’d probably be first if the film gave her a little more to actually do); coincidentally, Richards also has a small role in In the Heat of the Night. I also have to mention the excellent work by Dickinson and Acker as the ladies of Point Blank.\n\nJust outside the top five are Margaretha Krook as the perceptive doctor in Persona and Marjorie Johnson as the restless mother in Spring Night. The other Oscar nominees were Carol Channing in Thoroughly Modern Millie (a very broad performance) and Mildred Natwick in Barefoot in the Park.\n\nEnsemble:\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\nGuess Who’s Coming to Dinner\n\nThe Graduate\n\nIn the Heat of the Night\n\nPoint Blank\n\nFive nominations and two wins from me, plus solid work from the rest of the cast (including Gene Wilder in his first film), make Bonnie and Clyde the easy winner.\n\nOriginal Screenplay:\n\nBonnie and Clyde*\n\nPersona\n\nSpring Night Summer Night\n\nDavid Holzman’s Diary\n\nGuess Who’s Coming to Dinner**\n\nIt’s tough picking between Bonnie and Persona, but I give the more concrete storytelling and characterizations of the former the edge over the enigmas and ambiguities of the latter. It does mean pushing the tragically underseen Funnyman to 6th, but that’s just the luck of the draw.\n\nThe other Oscar nominees were Divorce American Style, Two for the Road, and Alain Resnais’ The War is Over.\n\nAdapted Screenplay:\n\nThe Graduate*\n\nIn the Heat of the Night**\n\nPoint Blank\n\nI’ve only got three nominees right now, but at least they’re both great films. Point Blank was actually completely passed over by the Oscars in 1967, but what do they know?\n\nThe other nominees were Cool Hand Luke, In Cold Blood, and Ulysses – and yes, that’s a film of the James Joyce novel.\n\nCinematography:\n\nThe Graduate*\n\nPersona\n\nSpring Night Summer Night\n\nBonnie and Clyde**\n\nPoint Blank\n\nA very strong list; I hate pushing Haskell Wexler’s great work on In the Heat of the Night (bizarrely snubbed by the Oscars) to #6, but The Graduate is quite brilliantly shot. Sven Nykvist’s magnificent work on Persona comes next, followed by the stark black-and-white of Spring Night, the dreamy nostalgia of Bonnie (an excellent Oscar choice), and the stylized neo-noir of Point Blank. The other Oscar nominees were Camelot, Doctor Dolittle, and In Cold Blood.\n\nEditing:\n\nPoint Blank\n\nThe Graduate\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\nPersona\n\nIn the Heat of the Night**\n\nAt least the Academy chose a solid winner, with Hal Ashby (who would become a major director in the 70s before burning out in the 80s) winning his only Oscar for it. I can at least understand not recognizing the astounding work in Point Blank, since they snubbed it entirely. But passing over the great work in The Graduate and Bonnie for Doctor Dolittle, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, and the obscure Beach Red? That’s a little harder to grasp.\n\nProduction Design:\n\nThe Happiest Millionaire\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\nThe Graduate\n\nYou Only Live Twice\n\nThe End of August at the Hotel Ozone\n\nNo, The Happiest Millionaire isn’t a very good film, but it does have really good sets (and costumes). You Only Live Twice and Hotel Ozone aren’t great either, but the volcano lair of the former and the post-apocalyptic settings of the latter are very well done.\n\nThe Oscar went to Camelot (a good choice), and the nominees were Doctor Dolittle, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (not a terrible choice but a weak one), The Taming of the Shrew, and Thoroughly Modern Millie (a good choice).\n\nCostume Design:\n\nThe Happiest Millionaire*\n\nCasino Royale\n\nBonnie and Clyde*\n\nChuka\n\nOf course the Academy passes over two worthy films in Art Direction (as it was called at the time), but recognizes them in Costume Design. Another Oscar for Camelot, and the other two nominees were The Taming of the Shrew and Thoroughly Modern Millie.\n\nI should note that Chuka is a pretty forgettable Western, but it has a rather good cast: Rod Taylor, Ernest Borgnine, John Mills, James Whitmore, and Luciana Paluzzi (Fiona Volpe in Thunderball).\n\nMakeup:\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\nInflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands\n\nCasino Royale\n\nYou Only Live Twice\n\nThe Comedians\n\nThe final shoot-out only seals the deal for Bonnie in this category. Inflatable Sex Doll, its memorable title aside, isn’t a great film, but it’s a fairly interesting one, part of the Japanese pink film genre, and has some very good gore effects for a film made on a very low budget\n\nScore:\n\nPoint Blank\n\nFunnyman\n\nInflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands\n\nIn the Heat of the Night\n\nCasino Royale\n\nThe score for Funnyman was written by Peter Schickele, who wrote very few film scores (most notably for Silent Running). The score for In the Heat of the Night was by Quincy Jones, who was at least nominated that year for In Cold Blood. The Oscar went to Thoroughly Modern Millie, a bit of an odd choice given that it has more vintage songs than original pieces; the other nominees were Cool Hand Luke, Doctor Dolittle, and Far From the Madding Crowd.\n\nSong:\n\n“You Only Live Twice,” You Only Live Twice\n\n“I Wan’na Be Like You,” The Jungle Book\n\n“In the Heat of the Night,” In the Heat of the Night\n\n“Col. Hathi’s March,” The Jungle Book\n\n“The Look of Love,” Casino Royale*\n\nThere are far worse films which have good or even great original songs. There are even worse Bond films with good original songs (A View to a Kill comes to mind). But while You Only Live Twice is a pretty middling entry in the series, “You Only Live Twice” is my favorite Bond theme of all and one of my favorite songs of all time. Naturally, it wins.\n\nThis is actually a pretty solid category, so of course the Academy passed over all but one of these songs; “The Bare Necessities” is a worthy choice (it’s 6th on my list) and “Thoroughly Modern Mille” is a catchy tune, but giving the Oscar to “Talk to the Animals” and nominating Quincy Jones for “The Eyes of Love” from the totally forgotten Banning instead of the title song from Heat of the Night is pretty absurd. Not as absurd as the Globes, who gave Score and Song to Camelot, despite all the music in that film coming from the original stage show.\n\nSound Mixing:\n\nPoint Blank\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\nIn the Heat of the Night**\n\nYou Only Live Twice\n\nA Man Vanishes\n\nAnother solid winner, another weak set of nominees, with The Dirty Dozen the only solid choice among the seemingly automatic nominations for the year’s big musicals: Camelot, Doctor Dolittle, and Thoroughly Modern Millie.\n\nSound Effects:\n\nPoint Blank\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\nYou Only Live Twice\n\nIn the Heat of the Night*\n\nCasino Royale\n\nThe Oscar went to The Dirty Dozen, a very good choice, even if they could’ve made better ones.\n\nVisual Effects:\n\nThe Equinox…a Journey into the Supernatural\n\nYou Only Live Twice\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\nCasino Royale\n\nI’m absolutely sincere about this choice. The Equinox was made for a few thousand dollars by teenaged amateurs (many of whom would go on to make a name for themselves in special effects), but the work on display isn’t just ingenious, it’s really quite accomplished. In a year without anything else that really dazzled me – the Oscar winner, Doctor Dolittle, is hardly dazzling (the other nominee was Tobruk) – it’s a choice I can stand by.\n\n1968:\n\nPicture:\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nThe Producers\n\nWar and Peace\n\nFaces\n\nTargets\n\nRosemary’s Baby\n\nPetulia\n\nThe Heart is a Lonely Hunter\n\nThe Profound Desire of the Gods\n\nBullitt\n\nThis is a very fine year, with one of my top 10 films of all time at #1 and one of my very favorite comedies at #2. It’s a really good top 5 (top 6, in fact), and as of this writing I actually have 15 films good enough for this category: the other five are Planet of the Apes, Night of the Living Dead, Bye Bye Braverman, Firecreek, and The Subject Was Roses.\n\nThe Academy makes a bit of a mess of this year. My top four films all had Oscar nominations, and three of them won an Oscar (as did my #6). But none of them got in for Picture, and the Picture category isn’t that great. I’ve only seen the winner, Oliver! (which is okay) and Funny Girl (which is a middling film built around a star-making performance), and neither recently. The other nominees were The Lion in Winter (which I think most would agree was the best of the nominees), Rachel, Rachel, and Romeo and Juliet (which I’ve still never seen because I tested out of freshman high school English).\n\nOther major films I’ve seen and need to rewatch include The Charge of the Light Brigade, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Finian’s Rainbow, The Firemen’s Ball, Ice Station Zebra, Once Upon a Time in the West, The Shoes of the Fisherman, Star!, and The Swimmer.\n\nDirector:\n\nStanley Kubrick, 2001: A Space Odyssey*\n\nSergei Bondarchuk, War and Peace\n\nRoman Polanski, Rosemary’s Baby\n\nShohei Imamura, The Profound Desire of the Gods\n\nPeter Yates, Bullitt\n\nSo we have possibly the greatest direction in film history, and the Academy is smart enough to nominate it – but they give the Oscar to Carol Reed for Oliver! So it goes. (I should note that Yates managed a BAFTA nomination.)\n\nThe other Oscar nominees were Anthony Harvey for The Lion in Winter, Gillo Pontecorvo for The Battle of Algiers, and Franco Zeffirelli for Romeo and Juliet.\n\nActor:\n\nZero Mostel, The Producers\n\nSergei Bondarchuk, War and Peace\n\nAlan Arkin, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter*\n\nJohn Marley, Faces\n\nGeorge C. Scott, Petulia\n\nBondarchuk directs himself to a nomination – no mean feat, given how much he had on his plate as a director – but I have to go with Mostel’s wonderful performance as the hilariously desperate Max Bialystock. Arkin, two years after his first Oscar nomination (not, I felt, a great choice), makes my list for his second nomination, a very fine performance in a very good film.\n\nThe Oscar went to Cliff Robertson in Charly, with the other nominees being Alan Bates in The Fixer (a hard film to come by these days), Ron Moody as Fagin in Oliver! (quite an enjoyable performance), and Peter O’Toole in The Lion in Winter (probably the most egregious of his Oscar losses).\n\nActress:\n\nLudmila Savelyeva, War and Peace\n\nMia Farrow, Rosemary’s Baby\n\nGena Rowlands, Faces\n\nPatricia Neal, The Subject Was Roses*\n\nJulie Christie, Petulia\n\nSavelyeva gives a truly remarkable performance as Natasha, especially considering it was her first film and she had trained not as an actress but as a ballerina. Farrow, of course, is Rosemary, and might well give the performance of her career (naturally, the Academy overlooked her). Neal’s performance is noteworthy because it was her first role after a stroke which nearly ended her career.\n\nThe Oscar was a tie between Katherine Hepburn in Lion and Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl; the other nominees were Vanessa Redgrave in Isadora and Joanne Woodward in Rachel, Rachel.\n\nSupporting Actor:\n\nGene Wilder, The Producers*\n\nSeymour Cassel, Faces*\n\nJack Albertson, The Subject Was Roses**\n\nKenneth Mars, The Producers\n\nDouglas Rain, 2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nNot only have I seen all five of the nominees in this category, but three of them make my current top 5! Wilder has to be the choice for his adorably ridiculous Leo Bloom, but Cassel and Albertson (yes, Grandpa Joe beat Willy Wonka) are very good as well. Albertson is arguably a lead in what’s a basically a three-character film (the third actor, Martin Sheen, was nominated in Supporting at the Globes). Mars, of course, is the fanatical Nazi playwright Franz Liebkind, and Rain is the voice of HAL, in one of the most iconic vocal performances of all time.\n\nThe other two Oscar nominees were Daniel Massey’s Noël Coward in Star! (he’s okay) and Jack Wild’s Artful Dodger in Oliver! (fine).\n\nSupporting Actress:\n\nLynn Carlin, Faces*\n\nSondra Locke, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter*\n\nRuth Gordon, Rosemary’s Baby**\n\nHideko Okiyama, The Profound Desire of the Gods\n\nShirley Knight, Petulia\n\nA strange coincidence, this category shaking out exactly the same as Supporting Actor. It’s a bit of a tighter top three than in that category, but Carlin really impressed me as the long-suffering housewife in Cassavetes’ fantastic Faces. Locke (arguably a lead) is really good as the girl who comes of age, and Gordon is a lot of fun as the sweet old lady who turns out to be a scheming Satan-worshipper. I also have to mention Okiyama as the semi-feral member of the very strange family in Profound Desire, a fascinating film I should really return to at some point.\n\nThe other Oscar nominees were Kay Medford in Funny Girl (a pretty brief and forgettable performance) and Estelle Parsons in Rachel, Rachel.\n\nEnsemble:\n\nThe Producers\n\nFaces\n\nWar and Peace\n\nRosemary’s Baby\n\nThe Profound Desire of the Gods\n\nA really strong top three; in addition to Mostel, Wilder, and Mars, The Producers also has Dick Shawn as L.S.D., Christopher Hewett as Roger De Bris, Estelle Winwood as “Hold Me, Touch Me,” Lee Meredith as Ulla, and Andreas Voutsinas as Carmen Ghia. But there are also the four great performances in Faces and the huge ensemble in War and Peace to consider.\n\nOriginal Screenplay:\n\nThe Producers**\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey*\n\nFaces*\n\nTargets\n\nThe Profound Desire of the Gods\n\nHere, the Academy not only made the right choice (one of their best choices ever, in my view), but they actually made great choices with the nominees – the other two were The Battle of Algiers (a good choice, I’m sure) and Hot Millions, an enjoyable film that probably didn’t need to be nominated, but I’m not really complaining.\n\nAdapted Screenplay:\n\nWar and Peace\n\nRosemary’s Baby*\n\nPetulia\n\nThe Heart is a Lonely Hunter\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nSergei Bondarchuk came in second for Director and Actor, but for the moment he wins this category for his epic-scaled adaptation of the epic-scaled novel. It’s kind of impressive that Rosemary earned a nomination, given that horror films don’t often get recognized for their writing. The Oscar went to The Lion in Winter (I don’t know why I’ve never seen it), with the other nominees being The Odd Couple (which I have as a *** film – it’s okay but I wasn’t that taken with it), Oliver! (meh), and Rachel, Rachel.\n\nCinematography:\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nWar and Peace\n\nThe Profound Desire of the Gods\n\nBullitt\n\nFaces\n\nIt’s really hard to pick between the precise brilliance of 2001 and the incredible sweep of War and Peace, but the Academy picked neither, giving the Oscar to Romeo and Juliet while nominating Funny Girl, Ice Station Zebra, Oliver!, and Star! Moving on.\n\nEditing:\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nBullitt**\n\nPetulia\n\nThe Producers\n\nWar and Peace\n\nAllowing that the deliberate pacing in 2001 isn’t for all tastes, I’m perfectly fine with Bullitt winning. And Petulia has some fascinating non-linear work (it’s another film I need to go back to at some point). The Academy picked a weird set of nominees, going with Funny Girl, The Odd Couple, Oliver!, and Wild in the Streets, a film about a rock star who gets the voting age to be lowered to 14 and is elected President. Ah, the 60s.\n\nProduction Design:\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey*\n\nWar and Peace*\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nRosemary’s Baby\n\nThe Producers\n\nA tight top two; the futuristic sets (and the lunar surface) in 2001 are pretty irreproachable, but the 19th-century aristocratic settings in War and Peace give them a run for their money. Another Oscar for Oliver! (the only one of its wins it really deserved), and the other nominees were Star! (fine) and The Shoes of the Fisherman (I guess?).\n\nCostume Design:\n\nWar and Peace\n\nPlanet of the Apes*\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nThe Producers\n\nWitchfinder General\n\nI’m a little surprised War and Peace wasn’t nominated here, given how much the Costume branch had embraced foreign films throughout the decade. I’m also a little surprised Planet of the Apes actually got on – it’s got solid costumes but it’s not the kind of film where they tend to get noticed. War and Peace wins this quite easily, by the way.\n\nThe Oscar went to Romeo and Juliet, the other nominees being The Lion in Winter, Oliver!, and Star!\n\nMakeup:\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nPlanet of the Apes**\n\nWar and Peace\n\nNight of the Living Dead\n\nThe Profound Desire of the Gods\n\nThe ape makeup in Planet is very good (it was the other special Oscar winner this decade), but 2001 wins on account of the ape-men and the aging makeup on Keir Dullea towards the end. The work in War and Peace is also worth noting, what with the scars of battle and the ravages of war and winter.\n\nScore:\n\nWar and Peace\n\nThe Producers\n\nBullitt\n\nRosemary’s Baby\n\nWitchfinder General\n\nWar and Peace has one of my favorite scores of all time; I even own it on vinyl. It’s an easy winner, as you might have guessed, though John Morris’ delightful score for The Producers and Lalo Schifrin’s awesome score for Bullitt are worthy nominees.\n\nThe Oscar went to The Lion in Winter, with the other nominees being The Fox (also by Schifrin), Planet of the Apes (just missed my top 5), The Shoes of the Fisherman (fairly good, as I recall), and The Thomas Crown Affair.\n\nSong:\n\n“Springtime for Hitler,” The Producers\n\n“Prisoners of Love,” The Producers\n\n“Love Power,” The Producers\n\n“The Cast and Crew,” Skidoo\n\n“A Lovely Way to Die,” A Lovely Way to Die\n\n“Springtime for Hitler” is one of the funniest songs ever written for a film, and I had to go with it. The Academy actually short-listed it, but I’m not surprised they didn’t actually put it on.\n\nThe Oscar winner was “The Windmills of Your Mind” from The Thomas Crown Affair; the other nominees included “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” which isn’t necessarily the best song from that film, but is certainly catchy as all get-out.\n\nSound Mixing:\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nBullitt*\n\nWar and Peace\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nThe Profound Desire of the Gods\n\nThe Academy really went for the musicals this year, giving the Oscar to Oliver! and nominating Finian’s Rainbow, Funny Girl, and Star! I guess the brilliant soundscape of 2001 and the battles and balls of War and Peace just weren’t to their taste.\n\nSound Effects:\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nBullitt\n\nWar and Peace\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nNight of the Living Dead\n\nThe sound effects category was retired and was a sporadically given special award until the 80s. They picked a hell of a year not to have it; the top three would all be worthy winners.\n\nVisual Effects:\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey**\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nWar and Peace\n\nKubrick was the only person listed as a nominee, despite a number of other artists being listed in the credits; this was the only Oscar he ever won. Given that the effects in 2001 are among the greatest in film history – possibly the greatest – it’s safe to say I agree with this choice. The other Oscar nominee is Ice Station Zebra, whose effects are not among the greatest in film history.\n\n1969:\n\nPicture:\n\nMidnight Cowboy**\n\nFuneral Parade of Roses\n\nThe Color of Pomegranates\n\nZ*\n\nOh! What a Lovely War\n\nHaving now seen Midnight Cowboy, it slides into my #1 spot for the time being – I don’t know if I’d rate it above Butch Cassidy, which I still need to rewatch, but it’s a fantastic film and a fine choice by the Oscars. I’m still only at two **** films for the year (Color of Pomegranates barely misses), but the top two are really strong. It doesn’t hurt that I’ve seen the top three films, as well as my #6 (Double Suicide) and #7 (The Arch) quite recently.\n\nThe other Oscar nominees are Anne of the Thousand Days (haven’t seen), Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (haven’t seen in years but loved at the time), and Hello, Dolly! (been a while but I thought it was okay).\n\nOther major films this year I need to rewatch include Battle of Britain, Easy Rider (which I remember hating), Krakatoa East of Java, Latitude Zero, Medium Cool, Paint Your Wagon (which I kind of like), Sweet Charity, Take the Money and Run, Topaz, and The Wild Bunch.\n\nDirector:\n\nJohn Schlesinger, Midnight Cowboy**\n\nToshio Matsumoto, Funeral Parade of Roses\n\nSergei Parajanov, The Color of Pomegranates\n\nMasahiro Shinoda, Double Suicide\n\nCosta-Gavras, Z*\n\nSome fantastic direction here; Schlesinger was a worthy Oscar winner, Funeral Parade is as anarchic and lurid as Pomegranates is restrained and symbolic, while Double Suicide, based on a bunraku play, has a lot of meta-dramatic elements. Kudos also to my #6, Tang Shu Shuen for The Arch.\n\nThe other Oscar nominees were Arthur Penn for Alice’s Restaurant, George Roy Hill for Butch Cassidy, and Sydney Pollack for They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? – a film which was nominated for just about everything but Best Picture.\n\nActor:\n\nJon Voight, Midnight Cowboy*\n\nPeter, Funeral Parade of Roses\n\nDustin Hoffman, Midnight Cowboy*\n\nKichiemon Nakamura, Double Suicide\n\nMilo O’Shea, The Adding Machine\n\nWhen I first wrote this, Jean-Louis Trintignant (who might be supporting in Z, I don’t remember for sure) had just passed away at the age of 91. He’d done some fantastic work over the following decades, including Three Colors: Red and Amour. Ironically, he’s now out of the top 5 (he’s #6).\n\nSeeing Midnight Cowboy really helped this year; Voight really should’ve won the Oscar for what might be the performance of his career, and while I think Hoffman is really supporting – and a touch broad – he would’ve been a good choice as well. It’s worth noting that, while the character Peter plays in Funeral Parade presents as female, Peter himself, as far as I have been able to find out, identifies as male. Either way, the performance is fantastic, as the Oedipal protagonist of a strange and endlessly fascinating film. Nakamura is comparably fine as the tragic protagonist of Double Suicide, while O’Shea is quite good as the pathetic Mr. Zero in the little-seen The Adding Machine.\n\nThe Oscar went to John Wayne for True Grit; neither the film nor the performance especially impressed me, especially compared to the remake, but it was very much a veteran award. The other nominees were Richard Burton in Anne of the Thousand Days (making him the third actor to be nominated for playing Henry VIII) and Peter O’Toole in the unmemorable musical remake of Goodbye Mr. Chips (currently my #7).\n\nActress:\n\nShima Iwashita, Double Suicide\n\nLisa Lu, The Arch\n\nDiana Rigg, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service\n\nNatalie Wood, Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice\n\nPetula Clark, Goodbye, Mr. Chips\n\nAn easy win for Iwashita, who’s fantastic in the dual role of the prostitute the protagonist is obsessed with and the wife he neglects. But Lu is quite good as the widow who rejects the love of a soldier for the sake of society’s expectations. Rigg is the ill-fated Tracy di Vicenzo – who becomes Tracy Bond for a very brief time.\n\nI haven’t seen any of the Oscar nominees; the winner was Maggie Smith for The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, and the nominees were Geneviève Bujold in Anne, Jane Fonda in They Shoot Horses, Liza Minnelli in The Sterile Cuckoo, and Jean Simmons in The Happy Ending.\n\nSupporting Actor:\n\nYoshio Tsuchiya, Funeral Parade of Roses\n\nElliott Gould, Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice*\n\nLi Ying, The Arch\n\nYves Montand, Z\n\nAlex Clarke, The Learning Tree\n\nI had to stretch a bit to fill this category, but Tsuchiya is very good as the equivalent of Jocasta in this singular riff on Oedipus Rex. Gould got his only Oscar nomination for Bob & Carol, which I honestly barely remember. The Oscar went to Gig Young as the MC in They Shoot Horses, and the other nominees were Rupert Crosse in The Reivers, Jack Nicholson (his first nomination of many) in Easy Rider (as I recall, he was the one part of the film I liked), and Anthony Quayle in Anne.\n\nI could slot Barnard Hughes or John McGiver in here for their roles in Midnight Cowboy, but I’ll leave them as honorable mentions.\n\nSupporting Actress:\n\nDyan Cannon, Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice*\n\nHilda Chou Hsuan, The Arch\n\nIrene Papas, Z\n\nPhyllis Diller, The Adding Machine\n\nBrenda Vaccaro, Midnight Cowboy\n\nAccording to my old notes, I really liked Cannon’s performance, so I’ll give her the win; I can say more confidently that Hsuan is quite good as the daughter in The Arch, while Diller, in the role of Mrs. Zero, gives a genuinely solid performance without any of her standard schtick. Sylvia Miles got nominated for Midnight Cowboy, but I didn’t think the performance really merited a nomination; Vaccaro is better and actually got a Globe nod, but even she’s kind of a distant fifth.\n\nThe Oscar went to Goldie Hawn for Cactus Flower (I haven’t seen the film but I saw the play once), with the other nominees being Catherine Burns in Last Summer (which is really hard to find), and Susannah York in They Shoot Horses.\n\nEnsemble:\n\nOh! What a Lovely War\n\nBob & Carol & Ted & Alice\n\nZ\n\nThe Adding Machine\n\nDouble Suicide\n\nOh! What a Lovely War is jam-packed with British stars, and whenever I get around to rewatching it, I’ll hopefully be able to pick out some notable performances to beef up my Supporting lists (since the film doesn’t really have a lead – it’s very much an ensemble piece).\n\nOriginal Screenplay:\n\nBob & Carol & Ted & Alice*\n\nPutney Swope\n\nNeither of these are great films, but that’s all I’ve got right now. Putney Swope is a personal favorite, even if I’ll admit it’s not actually that great (it’s a mid-high ***). The rightful Oscar winner was Butch Cassidy, and the other nominees were The Damned, Easy Rider, and The Wild Bunch.\n\nAdapted Screenplay:\n\nFuneral Parade of Roses\n\nZ*\n\nMidnight Cowboy**\n\nDouble Suicide\n\nThe Arch\n\nYou could argue that Funeral Parade is really an original script (and if I counted it as one, it would win easily), but it draws so much and so openly upon Oedipus Rex that I think it belongs here – where it still wins fairly easily. The Oscar went to Midnight Cowboy, a decent choice, though I think the acting and direction are what stand out more than the writing. The other Oscar nominees were Anne, Goodbye Columbus (which I’ve seen – it’s okay but hardly deserving of a nomination), and They Shoot Horses.\n\nCinematography:\n\nThe Color of Pomegranates\n\nMidnight Cowboy\n\nFuneral Parade of Roses\n\nThe Learning Tree\n\nThe Arch\n\nPomegranates may not have much in terms of acting, and the writing may be secondary to the imagery, but the imagery is absolutely stunning – I can’t argue with those who consider a great film for the visuals alone. The Learning Tree was directed by Gordon Parks (and mostly filmed in my native southeast Kansas), who was a professional photographer, and as such it’s quite a handsome film, despite its dramatic shortcomings.\n\nThe Oscar went to Butch Cassidy (a good choice), with the nominees being Anne, Bob & Carol (an odd choice – the cinematography didn’t really stand out to me), Hello, Dolly! (eh), and Marooned (fair). I’m shocked Midnight Cowboy didn’t get on, as that film has some really superb imagery.\n\nEditing:\n\nMidnight Cowboy*\n\nFuneral Parade of Roses\n\nZ**\n\nThe Arch\n\nDouble Suicide\n\nZ won the Oscar, a very good choice indeed, but I go with the flashbacks, nightmares, and montages of Cowboy and the wonderfully fractured editing of Funeral Parade over it. It’s worth noting that The Arch was edited by the documentarian Les Blank, and it has some rather fine work"
