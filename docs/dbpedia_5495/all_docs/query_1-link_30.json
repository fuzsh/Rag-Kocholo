The only stars to win both a Best Actor and a Best Supporting Actor (BSA) Oscar are the following:\n\nJack Nicholson (BA for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and As Good As It Gets (1997), and BSA for Terms of Endearment (1983))\n\nJack Lemmon (BA for Save the Tiger (1973), BSA for Mister Roberts (1955))\n\nRobert DeNiro (BA for Raging Bull (1980), BSA for The Godfather, Part II (1974))\n\nGene Hackman (BA for The French Connection (1971), BSA for Unforgiven (1992))\n\nKevin Spacey (BA for American Beauty (1999), BSA for The Usual Suspects (1995))\n\nDenzel Washington (BA for Training Day (2001), BSA for Glory (1989))\n\nThe Only Best Actor Tie:\n\nIn the Best Actor category, an unusual tie (the only occurrence among male acting performances) occurred in 1931/32 between Wallace Beery and Fredric March, for their respective performances in The Champ (1931/32) and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931/32).\n\nThe Most Best Actor Oscar Nominations - Without Winning:\n\nPeter O'Toole is the only star with eight Best Actor Oscar nominations without a single win. His record extends 44 years, from 1962 to 2006.\n\nRichard Burton was nominated seven times (and never won), although his first nomination was as Best Supporting Actor for My Cousin Rachel (1952) -- his last six nominations were as Best Actor.\n\nOscar-Winning Actor Roles and Trends:\n\nBiographies of remarkable, real-life individuals (military figures or soldiers, law-and-order enforcers, historical figures) and portrayals of the mentally ill are heavily represented among male Oscar winners, particularly in the acting awards. It helps an actor's chances of winning an Oscar if the character dies a tragic death during the movie, or is slightly eccentric (or genius).\n\nPhysical and Mental Disabilities or Diseases\n\nAn overwhelming number of actors have won (or been nominated for) the top acting (and supporting) awards for portraying characters with physical or mental disabilities (personality disorders, amnesia) or diseases (with handicaps, such as blindness or muteness, tics, etc.):\n\nFredric March won the Best Actor Oscar for his dual, split personality role as a respected doctor and as a fiendish mad-man in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931/32)\n\nRonald Colman was nominated as Best Actor for his role as shell-shocked amnesiac Charles Rainier in Random Harvest (1942)\n\nHarold Russell (real-life amputee) won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as courageous and resourceful returning sailor Homer Parrish in The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) [Note: Russell is the only performer to win two Oscars for the same performance.

Fonda should have won years earlier for any number of performances, including The Grapes of Wrath (1940) or The Ox-Bow Incident (1943)\n\nAlso, elderly nominees seem to fare better, such as 54 year-old Art Carney winning the Best Actor Oscar for Harry and Tonto (1974), 60 year-old Peter Finch's posthumous Best Actor award for Network (1976), 83 year-old Anthony Hopkins winning the Best Actor Oscar for The Father (2020), 80 year-old George Burns winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for The Sunshine Boys (1975), Melvyn Douglas winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Being There (1979), Don Ameche winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Cocoon (1985), and 72 year-old Alan Arkin winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Little Miss Sunshine (2006).\n\nMany other elderly actors have been nominated for supporting roles, including Eric von Stroheim for Sunset Boulevard (1950), Sessue Hayakawa for The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), John Mills for Ryan's Daughter (1970), Lee Strasberg for The Godfather, Part II (1974), Burgess Meredith for Rocky (1976), Robert Preston for Victor/Victoria (1982), Denholm Elliott for A Room With a View (1986), and Armin Mueller-Stahl for Shine (1996).\n\nPost-Humous Acting Nominations and Award(s):\n\nThere are only been eight post-humous performance nominees in Academy history. Only two posthumous nominees have won the Oscar: the first by Peter Finch and and the second by Heath Ledger - see below:\n\nJeanne Eagels - unofficially nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for The Letter (1928/29) posthumously (Academy records indicated that she was \"under consideration\" for an award)\n\nJames Dean - the only actor who was twice nominated (in two consecutive years) for a Best Actor Oscar after his death and lost, for East of Eden (1955), and Giant (1956)\n\nSpencer Tracy - nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967) posthumously\n\nPeter Finch - nominated and winning the Best Actor Oscar for Network (1976) posthumously - Finch was the first performer to have won the Oscar after his death\n\nRalph Richardson - nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984) posthumously\n\nItalian actor Massimo Troisi - nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for The Postman (Il Postino) (1995) posthumously\n\nHeath Ledger - nominated and winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for The Dark Knight (2008) posthumously - Ledger was the second performer to win posthumously\n\nChadwick Boseman - nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom (2020) posthumously\n\nThe Most Best Actor Nominations for a Single Film:\n\nThe film with the most Best Actor nominations (3) was Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), for Clark Gable, Franchot Tone, and Charles Laughton. It was the first film to have three acting nominations, and the first film to have three co-performers competing against each other in the same category - as Best Actor.\n\nAfrican-American (or Black) Notables:\n\nThere have only been twenty-eight African-American (or black) nominations for Best Actor, divided amongst seventeen different performers. Four actors (Poitier, Freeman, Washington and Smith) have been nominated twice (or more) for the top award. Some regard Denzel Washington as the first African-American performer to win Best Actor -- because previous Oscar-winner Sidney Poitier was of Bahamas descent:\n\n# Best Actor Nominee Film 1 Sidney Poitier The Defiant Ones (1958) 2 Sidney Poitier Lilies of the Field (1963) (win) 3 James Earl Jones The Great White Hope (1970) 4 Paul Winfield Sounder (1972) 5 Dexter Gordon 'Round Midnight (1986) 6 Morgan Freeman Driving Miss Daisy (1989) 7 Morgan Freeman The Shawshank Redemption (1994) 8 Denzel Washington Malcolm X (1992) 9 Denzel Washington The Hurricane (1999) 10 Denzel Washington Training Day (2001) (win) 11 Laurence Fishburne What's Love Got to Do With It (1993) 12 Will Smith Ali (2001) 13 Will Smith The Pursuit of Happyness (2006) 14 Don Cheadle Hotel Rwanda (2004) 15 Jamie Foxx Ray (2004) (win) 16 Terrence Howard Hustle & Flow (2005) 17 Forest Whitaker The Last King of Scotland (2006) (win) 18 Morgan Freeman Invictus (2009) 19 Denzel Washington Flight (2012) 20 Chiwetel Ejiofor 12 Years a Slave (2013) 21 Denzel Washington Fences (2016) 22 Denzel Washington Roman J.

Only six black performers have won the Oscar in the lead category (five Best Actor, one Best Actress).\n\nOnly five African-American actors have won the Best Actor Oscar:\n\nSidney Poitier for Lilies of the Field (1963)\n\nDenzel Washington for Training Day (2001)\n\nJamie Foxx for Ray (2004)\n\nForest Whitaker for The Last King of Scotland (2006)\n\nWill Smith for King Richard (2021)\n\nIn 2021, Denzel Washington became the most-nominated black actor in Oscar history with his Best Actor nomination for The Tragedy of Macbeth (2021).

He previously won Best Actor for Training Day (2001), and Best Supporting Actor for Glory (1989).\n\nIn 2020, six black African-American performers were nominated in three of the four acting categories. 9 of the 20 acting nominees were of color or from ethnic-minority backgrounds. Only one black nominee won: Daniel Kaluuya for Judas and the Black Messiah (2020).\n\n2016 was the first year in Academy history in which black actors/actresses were nominated in each of the four acting categories. Seven of the 20 acting nominations in 2016 were non-white nominees (six African-American and one Britisher/Indian). This bested the record of five nominated blacks in 2006 and 2004. In 2017, there were four non-white nominees. Three nominated blacks occurred in three different years (2001, 1985, and 1972).\n\nYears With Record Number of Black (Non-White) Nominees 2020\n\nChadwick Boseman, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\n\nViola Davis, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\n\nAndra Day, The United States vs. Billie Holiday\n\nDaniel Kaluuya, Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nLeslie Odom, Jr., One Night in Miami\n\nLaKeith (Keith) Stanfield, Judas and the Black Messiah\n\n2017\n\nDenzel Washington, Roman J.

And he was the first African American actor to win two Oscars for acting (one Best Actor and one Best Supporting Actor). He was then joined by Mahershala Ali with two acting Oscars (Ali won two Best Supporting Actor Oscars, in 2016 and 2018, and became the first black actor to repeat a win in the same category).\n\n[With Denzel Washington's nomination for Flight (2012), he became the most nominated African-American actor in Academy history. Then, with his nomination for Fences (2016), he broke his own record for most Oscar nominations for a black male actor, and then broke the record again for Roman J. Israel, Esq. (2017) and for The Tragedy of Macbeth (2021). He was the first black actor to have won two competitive Oscars (as Best Supporting Actor for Glory (1989) and as Best Actor for Training Day (2001). The second black actor to win two competitive Oscars (as Best Supporting Actor for Moonlight (2016) and Green Book (2018)) was Mahershala Ali.]\n\nTwo African-American actors have been nominated for Best Actor in the same year, numerous times:\n\nYear Best Actor Nominees 2021 Denzel Washington for The Tragedy of Macbeth (2021)\n\nWill Smith for King Richard (2021) 2006 Will Smith for The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)\n\nForest Whitaker for The Last King of Scotland (2006) 2004 Don Cheadle for Hotel Rwanda (2004)\n\nJamie Foxx for Ray (2004) 2001 Will Smith for Ali (2001)\n\nDenzel Washington for Training Day (2001)\n\nMorgan Freeman's Best Supporting Actor win for Million Dollar Baby (2004), paired with Jamie Foxx's Best Actor win for Ray (2004), was the first time that African-American actors won in their respective categories in the same year.\n\nIn three instances, African-Americans have won two of the four acting prizes:\n\n2006: Forest Whitaker for The Last King of Scotland, Jennifer Hudson for Dreamgirls\n\n2004: Morgan Freeman for Million Dollar Baby, Jamie Foxx for Ray\n\n2001: Halle Berry for Monster's Ball, Denzel Washington for Training Day\n\nLatino, Asian and Other Ethnic-Minority (Non-English) Performers:\n\nThere have been only a few Best Actor Oscar wins by ethnic/other minority (or non-English) performers:\n\nArab-American Rami Malek (of Egyptian descent) became the first Arab American to win the Best Actor Oscar for Bohemian Rhapsody (2018), and the second Arab-American to be nominated for an acting Oscar (Omar Sharif was nominated as Best Supporting Actor for Lawrence of Arabia (1962) )\n\nFrench actor Jean Dujardin won Best Actor for The Artist (2011) - he was the first French actor to win the Best Actor Oscar\n\nItalian actor Roberto Benigni won the Best Actor Oscar for Life is Beautiful (1998) - he was the first male actor to win an Oscar for a foreign-language film (his Best Actor Oscar win was only the second time a nominee won an acting Oscar for a foreign language film role - the earlier winner was Sophia Loren)\n\nBen Kingsley, with half-Indian (birth name Krishna Bhanji) and half-English descent, won the Best Actor Oscar for Gandhi (1982) - he became the first South Asian performer to achieve such a feat\n\nPuerto Rican-born Jose Ferrer won the Best Actor Oscar for his role in Cyrano de Bergerac (1950)\n\nNotable ethnic/minority performance nominations for Best Actor include:\n\nIrish-born Cillian Murphy was nominated (and won) Best Actor for Oppenheimer (2023) - the first ever Irish-born winner\n\nAfro-Latino Colman Domingo was nominated as Best Actor for Rustin (2023) - a first\n\nSouth Korean actor Steven Yeun was nominated as Best Actor for Minari (2020) - Yuen became the first Asian-American nominee for Best Actor\n\nEnglish (and Pakistani Muslim) actor Riz Ahmed was nominated as Best Actor for Sound of Metal (2020) - he became the first Muslim (and first of Pakistani descent) Best Actor nominee\n\nSpanish actor Antonio Banderas was nominated as Best Actor for Pain and Glory (2019, Sp.)\n\nAustralian actor Hugh Jackman was nominated as Best Actor for Les Miserables (2012)\n\nMexican-born actor Demián Bichir was nominated as Best Actor for A Better Life (2011)\n\nPart Indian/Britisher Ben Kingsley was nominated as Best Actor for House of Sand and Fog (2003)\n\nSpanish/Latino actor Javier Bardem was nominated as Best Actor for Before Night Falls (2000), Biutiful (2010), and Being the Ricardos (2021) - he was the first Best Actor nominee for a fully Spanish-language role\n\nAustralian actor Geoffrey Rush was nominated as Best Actor for Shine (1996) (win) and Quills (2000) - Geoffrey Rush became the first Australian actor to win Best Actor (for the role of the mad pianist in Shine (1996)) since Peter Finch won posthumously for Network (1976)\n\nItalian actor Massimo Troisi was nominated as Best Actor for The Postman (Il Postino) (1995)\n\nFrench actor Gerard Depardieu was nominated as Best Actor for Cyrano de Bergerac (1990)\n\nSwedish actor Max Von Sydow was nominated as Best Actor for Pelle the Conqueror (1988)\n\nMexican-American Edward James Olmos was nominated as Best Actor for Stand and Deliver (1988)\n\nItalian actor Marcello Mastroianni was nominated as Best Actor for Dark Eyes (1987)\n\nItalian actor Marcello Mastroianni was nominated as Best Actor for A Special Day (1977)\n\nItalian actor Giancarlo Giannini was nominated as Best Actor for Seven Beauties (1976)\n\nItalian actor Marcello Mastroianni was nominated as Best Actor for Divorce - Italian Style (1962)\n\nMexican-born Anthony Quinn was nominated twice as Best Actor for Wild Is the Wind (1957) and Zorba the Greek (1964)\n\nPuerto Rican-born Jose Ferrer was nominated as Best Actor for Moulin Rouge (1952)\n\nNote: In 1985, all ten of the Best Actor/Actress nominees were American-born - the first time in Oscar history.
