        "text": "Oscar Trivia: Can Angelina Jolie Make History?\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to realize that Angelina Jolie is a pioneer. A movie star par excellence, she's a figure recognized the world over for her incredible commitment to humanitarian causes, her beauty and style, and of course her many contributions to the world of cinema. This year, that includes only her third directorial achievement, following the documentary A Place in Time and her Golden Globe-nominated In the Land of Blood and Honey. With this movie (Unbroken, for those of you who don't live night and day for the Oscars), she is positioning herself to potentially win the Best Director prize at the Oscars, becoming the first woman to be nominated for both acting and directing, and the second woman potentially to win an Oscar for Best Director after Kathryn Bigelow a few years back.\n\nNote above that I said first woman nominated for acting and directing, because Jolie, ever the trendsetter, were she to win the Best Director prize, would become the first person to ever win Oscars for both directing and acting (she won in 1999 for Best Supporting Actress in Girl, Interrupted). While there are actors who have won for producing and acting (Michael Douglas comes to mind) and writing and acting (Emma Thompson comes to mind), no person has ever won both an acting Oscar and a directing Oscar. This could change this year, and in honor of Ms. Jolie and her potential achievement, I thought it would be worth going through the thirteen men who have tried before her and failed. Below I'll list the thirteen multi-hyphenate entertainers who have enjoyed nominations for both acting and directing (in chronological order of hitting this distinction).\n\nHonorable Mentions: Before we begin, it's worth noting that there are a number of famous actors who have been nominated for Oscars for performances that also direct, amongst them (and this is completely off the top of my head) Barbra Streisand, Jodie Foster, Charlie Chaplin, Charles Laughton, and Dennis Hopper. On the flip side are a number of actors that have been nominated for directing but never for acting, including Sydney Pollack, Mel Gibson, Sofia Coppola, Richard Attenborough, and Ron Howard. And then of course there's the bizarre case of Ben Affleck, who is most known as an actor-director, and yet has been nominated for neither and still won two Oscars (for producing and writing).\n\n1. Lionel Barrymore (1878-1954)\n\nActing Nominations: A Free Soul (1931), for which he won.\n\nDirecting Nominations: Madame X (1929)\n\nOther Nominations: Mr. Barrymore was only nominated for acting and directing.\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: Barrymore is most noted today for his work in It's a Wonderful Life as Mr. Potter, but was quite the Oscar enthusiast in other Best Picture nominees, and directed won of the most significant lost films of the 1930's, The Rogue Song. The film features one of the only Oscar-nominated performances to be considered \"lost,\" from famed Oscar singer Lawrence Tibbett. Barrymore's sister Ethel would go on to have a pretty robust career with AMPAS, winning an Oscar in 1944, but his brother John would have to settle for being \"The Great Profile\" rather than an Oscar nominee. His grand niece Drew is still a major star and feels like she'll someday be nominated, but so far no luck.\n\n2. Orson Welles (1915-1985)\n\nActing Nominations: Citizen Kane (1941)\n\nDirecting Nominations: Citizen Kane (1941)\n\nOther Nominations: Welles received an Oscar nomination for writing Citizen Kane, lucking out and winning for this particular citation. He also went on to win an Honorary Oscar in 1970 for career achievement. Funny story-Welles claimed at the time that he was filming The Other Side of Wind (his still unfinished last directorial work), but in fact was in his home in Hollywood at the time. John Huston, another actor-director, would pick up the trophy from the Academy and give it to Welles after the ceremony.\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: Welles spent most of his career as a director \"in the wilderness,\" working outside of Hollywood. He did, however manage to have a successful follow-up to Citizen Kane with The Magnificent Ambersons which won a Best Picture nomination and is heralded as one of the greatest films of all-time, though Welles was locked out of the editing room and so the public didn't get to see his intended vision of the classic Booth Tarkington novel.\n\n3. Laurence Olivier (1907-1989)\n\nActing Nominations: A titan of acting, Olivier received ten nominations for acting in his career for Wuthering Heights (1939), Rebecca (1940), Henry V (1945), Hamlet (1948), Richard III (1955), The Entertainer (1960), Othello (1965), Sleuth (1972), Marathon Man (1976), and The Boys from Brazil (1978); he won for Hamlet\n\nDirecting Nominations: Olivier directed himself as the forlorn Danish prince in Hamlet and was Oscar-nominated for it.\n\nOther Nominations: While he received no other nominations, Olivier did win two Honorary Oscars, one in 1945 specifically for writing, directing, and acting in Henry V, and then one in 1978 for his life achievement.\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: Despite an assumption that I had made that Olivier was in control of most of his later projects, he only directed three of his Oscar-nominated works. In addition to Henry V and Hamlet, Olivier also directed Richard III. Olivier would actually only direct two more films after Richard III: The Prince and the Showgirl with Marilyn Monroe (chronicled in the Oscar-nominated My Week with Marilyn) and Three Sisters (where he directed his wife, Oscar-nominee Joan Plowright).\n\n4. John Huston (1906-1987)\n\nActing Nominations: One of the rare men on this list that is more known for directing than acting, Huston nonetheless had a brief career as an actor, most notably as the evil Noah Cross in Chinatown. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Otto Preminger's The Cardinal (1963).\n\nDirecting Nominations: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), The Asphalt Jungle (1950), The African Queen (1951), Moulin Rouge (1952), and late in his career Prizzi's Honor (1985). He won for Treasure of the Sierra Madre.\n\nOther Nominations: Mr. Huston was nominated for producing for Moulin Rouge and for writing Treasure of the Sierra Madre (which won him his other Oscar), The Asphalt Jungle, and The African Queen, as well as Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet (1940), Sergeant York (1941), The Maltese Falcon (1941), Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957), and The Man Who Would Be King (1975).\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: Huston is the only person to ever direct both a parent and a child to an Oscar. His father Walter won the Best Supporting Actor trophy for The Treasure of the Sierra Madre while his daughter Anjelica won for Best Supporting Actress in Prizzi's Honor.\n\n5. Woody Allen (1935-Present)\n\nActing Nominations: Woody received his sole acting nomination for 1977's Annie Hall.\n\nDirecting Nominations: Annie Hall (1977), Interiors (1978), Broadway Danny Rose (1984), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), Bullets Over Broadway (1994), and Midnight in Paris (2011). Mr. Allen won for Annie Hall.\n\nOther Nominations: Allen's biggest claim to fame with Oscar is with his writing. He received screenplay nominations for all of the films he was nominated for for directing, as well as Manhattan (1979), The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), Radio Days (1988), Alice (1990), Husbands and Wives (1992), Mighty Aphrodite (1995), Deconstructing Harry (1997), Match Point (2006), and Blue Jasmine (2013). He won for Annie Hall, Hannah, and Midnight in Paris.\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: In addition to being the most nominated screenwriter of all time (beating one of his heroes, Billy Wilder), Allen is a good luck charm for actors when it comes to Oscar-seventeen actors have been nominated for their work in his films (though bizarrely never Mia Farrow).\n\n6. Warren Beatty (1937-Present)\n\nActing Nominations: Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Heaven Can Wait (1978), Reds (1981), and Bugsy (1991), making him one of those rare actors to have been nominated in four separate decades.\n\nDirecting Nominations: Heaven Can Wait (1978) and Reds (1981). Mr. Beatty won for Reds.\n\nOther Nominations: In addition to the Thalberg Award he won in 1999 (the same year his wife was starring in Best Picture winner American Beauty), Beatty has been nominated for producing Bonnie and Clyde, Heaven Can Wait, Reds, and Bugsy, as well as for writing Shampoo (1975), Heaven Can Wait, Reds, and Bulworth (1998).\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: Beatty kind of wrote the book on multi-hyphenate trivia. He is one of only two actors to have been nominated for acting/directing in two separate movies (the other one is Number 10 on this list), and is the only person to be nominated for writing, directing, producing, and acting all for one film, twice (for Heaven Can Wait and Reds). Beatty also has a bit of a history of turning down Oscar-nominated roles, including Rocky Balboa, Gorden Gekko, Richard Nixon (in Oliver Stone's Nixon), and Jack Horner in Boogie Nights.\n\n7. Robert Redford (1936-Present)\n\nActing Nominations: Despite being a matinee idol for decades now, Mr. Redford has only received one acting nomination so far in his career, for 1973's The Sting.\n\nDirecting Nominations: Ordinary People (1980) and Quiz Show (1994); he won for Ordinary People\n\nOther Nominations: Redford was also nominated for producing Quiz Show, and was given an Honorary Award in 2001 for his career, particularly for his role in conjunction with the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: Despite the Sundance Film Festival being one of the great Meccas of independent filmmakers and the event featuring a host of future writing and acting nominees with AMPAS, only a handful of movies from the festival have competed for Best Picture: Little Miss Sunshine, Winter's Bone, The Kids Are All Right, and Beasts of the Southern Wild (none of them ended up winning). However, if you want a guide to what documentaries will be nominated for the Oscar next year, just look at the Sundance lineup, as they almost always play there.\n\n8. Kenneth Branagh (1960-Present)\n\nActing Nominations: Henry V (1989) and My Week with Marilyn (2011)\n\nDirecting Nominations: Henry V (1989)\n\nOther Nominations: Sir Kenneth (he was knighted in 2012) has a bizarre history with AMPAS, having been nominated five times in five different categories (the only person ever to do that without doubling up...so far). In addition to the above nominations, he was also nominated for Best Live Action Short Film for Swan Song and in an odd situation (considering it was exactly the same as the Shakespearean text and hardly adapted at all) Hamlet in 1996.\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: Branagh is the only person on this list to never have won an Academy Award. All of Branagh's nominations relate either directly or tangentially to Laurence Olivier: Hamlet and Henry V were both roles that Olivier played earlier in his career to Oscar-nominated success, Swan Song stars Olivier's fiercest rival on the Shakespearean stage John Gielgud, and in My Week with Marilyn Branagh actually plays Olivier. Perhaps to keep with the symmetry of one nomination per category he should make a documentary about Olivier and see if that can finally land him a trophy.\n\n9. Kevin Costner (1955-Present)\n\nActing Nominations: Dances with Wolves (1990)\n\nDirecting Nominations: Dances with Wolves (1990), for which he won.\n\nOther Nominations: Mr. Costner was also nominated for producing Dances with Wolves, which also won him an Oscar.\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: Costner is one of only two men on this list to get their nominations to warrant inclusion in this list for only one film. Costner did star in Best Picture nominees both the year before and the year after Dances with Wolves, however: 1989's Field of Dreams and 1991's JFK (it might be hard to fathom now for younger audiences who only know him from random baseball films you see on cable, but Kevin Costner was once one of the biggest movie stars on the planet). Also, despite the general apathy with which it was received by critics and the public, Waterworld is a part of the OVP (I've never seen it-it'll be something to look forward to), getting a nod for Sound Mixing.\n\n10. Clint Eastwood (1930-Present)\n\nActing Nominations: Unforgiven (1992) and Million Dollar Baby (2004)\n\nDirecting Nominations: Unforgiven, Mystic River (2003), Million Dollar Baby, and Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)-he won for Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby\n\nOther Nominations: Clint was also nominated for producing Unforgiven, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, and Letters from Iwo Jima, winning for Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby. He won the Thalberg Award in 1994.\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: Clint had to temporarily host the 44th Academy Awards when his buddy Charlton Heston was stuck in traffic. Eastwood, not a comedian by nature, was not good at improvising and the material that was written for Heston made no sense for him. Eastwood swore he wouldn't return to the Oscars again unless he was nominated, and he stuck to his word, not showing up again until Unforgiven.\n\n11. Roberto Benigni (1952-Present)\n\nActing Nominations: Life is Beautiful (1998), for which he won\n\nDirecting Nominations: Life is Beautiful\n\nOther Nominations: Benigni was also nominated for writing Life is Beautiful, but lost. The film did win Best Foreign Language film, but since that honor technically goes to the country rather than the director Benigni's technical Oscar count stands at one even though you saw him win two (I have always felt this was a stupid rule, and think all directors of Foreign Language film nominees and winners should get to use their Oscar-nominated and Oscar-winning titles).\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: Both he and Kevin Costner are the only men on this list to get all of their Oscar nominations out of one film. Coincidentally, they share a far more dubious honor: they're the only two men to have directed themselves to Oscar nominations AND Razzie Awards (Costner for The Postman and Benigni for Pinocchio).\n\n12. Tim Robbins (1958-Present)\n\nActing Nominations: Mystic River (2003), for which he won Best Supporting Actor\n\nDirecting Nominations: Dead Man Walking (1995), one of those extremely rare films that gets nominated for both lead performances, directing, and writing and doesn't get a Best Picture nomination. Oddly enough, Leaving Las Vegas in the same year managed to do the same thing. Also, Robbins ended up losing to a fellow actor in Mel Gibson, one of the very rare times where two actor/directors competed against each other at the Oscars.\n\nOther Nominations: Robbins has had a long career with Oscar-nominated films, but those are his only two nominations to date.\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: Despite the men on this list being married to the likes of Vivien Leigh, Annette Bening, and Emma Thompson, Robbins is one of only two to have their longtime romantic partners win an Oscar for a role they directed, with Susan Sarandon in Dead Man Walking (the other was Woody with Diane Keaton in Annie Hall). Clearly Brad Pitt should have waited until he had his trophy before he and Angelina got hitched.\n\n13. George Clooney (1961-Present)\n\nActing Nominations: Syriana (2005), Michael Clayton (2007), Up in the Air (2009), and The Descendants (2011), with Clooney winning for Syriana\n\nDirecting Nominations: Good Night, and Good Luck (2005)\n\nOther Nominations: Clooney was also nominated for writing Good Night, and Good Luck as well as The Ides of March (2011), and was nominated for producing Argo (2012), which won him his second Oscar.\n\nA Random Bit of Trivia: I'll go with two for the quintessential movie star of our era. First, he isn't the only Oscar winner in the family: his uncle was Jose Ferrer, Best Actor of 1950 for Cyrano de Bergerac. Secondly, Clooney is the only person in Oscar history (to date) that has been nominated in six different categories: Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Original Screenplay, and Adapted Screenplay. $20 says he tries to get into one of the shorts categories before the decade is over.\n\nAnd those are the thirteen gentlemen that Angelina Jolie could well be in the company of by January. Do you think she'll do it? Can she be the first to actually win the big prize? And which of these men got the closest/should have sealed the deal? Share in the comments!"
