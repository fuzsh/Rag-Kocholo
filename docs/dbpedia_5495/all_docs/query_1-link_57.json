Winners receive a cash prize, an award certificate, and two tickets to the Circle’s annual gala, which is typically held in the first week of January.\n\nCurrently, there are two prizes of $2,500 each: One will go to an undergraduate student, the other to a graduate student. Applicants should be attending college in New York State and be studying or have an interest in film criticism/journalism.\n\nApplicants should submit two reviews/essays of 500-800 words each. One piece should be on a recent film from the current calendar year. The other should be on an older film from before 1980.\n\nThe contest officially opens after Labor Day of the current year. Deadline for all submissions is November 17. Winners will be announced after the NYFCC voting meeting in early December.\n\nAll questions and submissions should be directed to NYFCC member Keith Uhlich at keithuhlich@gmail.com.\n\nPast Winners"
