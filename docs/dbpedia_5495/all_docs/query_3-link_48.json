That year, Parker and co-stars Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall were nominated, but only Cattrall won.\n\nJessica Lange (2004)\n\nIn 2004, Jessica Lange (this year a nominee for best actress in a miniseries or TV movie for American Horror Story) attended the HBO afterparty.\n\n‘Six Feet Under’ (2004)\n\nJames Cromwell congratulated fellow Six Feet Under castmember Frances Conroy, who won for best actress in a drama series, at the HBO afterparty at the Beverly Hilton in 2004.\n\nSofia Coppola (2004)\n\nAt the 2004 Universal-Focus Features afterparty, Francis Ford Coppola posed with daughter Sofia, who won for best screenwriting for Lost in Translation, and nephew Nicolas Cage.\n\n‘All in the Family’ (1974)\n\nPeter Falk (left, with producer-director John Rich, who won best comedy series for All in the Family) presented a Globe to All in the Family’s Jean Stapleton in 1974 for best comedy actress. She tied with Cher for The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.\n\nLaurence Olivier (1983)\n\n1983 DeMille winner Laurence Olivier got love from Ben Kingsley (left), best actor in a drama for Gandhi, and Dustin Hoffman, best actor in a comedy or musical for Tootsie.\n\n‘Good Will Hunting’ (1998)\n\nBen Affleck (left) and Matt Damon’s breakthrough: their win for screenwriting for Good Will Hunting in 1998.

Robinson, Maurice Chevalier, Susan Kohner (1959)\n\nIn 1959, Edward G. Robinson (left) compared Cecil B. DeMille winner Maurice Chevalier’s statuette with the one belonging to New Star of the Year recipient Susan Kohner. Kohner, who earned both a Globe and an Oscar nom the next year for Imitation of Life (and whose father was superagent Paul Kohner), is the mother of American Pie directors Chris and Paul Weitz.\n\nShirley MacLaine, Barbra Streisand (1984)\n\nIn 1984, Shirley MacLaine (left) clutched her award for best actress (Terms of Endearment) while Barbra Streisand held two statuettes — for best director (Yentl) and for best comedy/musical.
