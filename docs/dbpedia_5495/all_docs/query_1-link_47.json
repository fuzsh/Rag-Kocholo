Racking up 11 nominations, Sunset Boulevard took home 7 awards, including Best Actress for Nicole Scherzinger.\n\nBorn as the Society of West End Theatre Awards in 1976, the Oliviers, as they're fondly called, were rechristened in 1984 to honor the legendary Laurence Olivier. London's answer to Broadway's Tonys, these awards hold the same weight as BAFTAs for film and television or BRIT Awards for music. Winning an Olivier is a pinnacle achievement in British theatre, as the 2024 ceremony's victors can surely confirm. Now, let's unveil the 2024 Olivier Award winners!\n\nBest Actors and Actresses\n\nLeading the pack, Sarah Snook triumphed as Best Actress for her captivating performance in The Picture of Dorian Gray.

Nicole Scherzinger's acclaimed performance in Sunset Boulevard earned her the Best Actress in a Musical Olivier, with co-star Tom Francis securing the Best Actor in a Musical award.\n\nMoving to the supporting roles, Will Close delivered a performance worthy of an Olivier in Dear England, while the late Haydn Gwynne received a posthumous Olivier for her work in When Winston Went to War with the Wireless.

Brilliant direction, paired with stunning sets, lighting, and sound design, brought the stories to life in unforgettable ways.\n\nJamie Lloyd masterfully helmed the critically acclaimed Sunset Boulevard, earning him the Best Director award.
