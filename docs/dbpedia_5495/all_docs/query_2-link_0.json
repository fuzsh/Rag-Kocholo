        "text": "Awards and nominations received by English actor, writer & director Laurence Olivier\n\nLaurence Olivier awards and nominations\n\nLaurence Olivier (1907–1989) was an English actor who, along with his contemporaries Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud, dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century.[1] He also worked in films throughout his career, playing more than fifty cinema roles. From 1956 he performed in television roles, for which he won several awards.\n\nIn 1939, Olivier appeared in the film Wuthering Heights in the quintessential role of Heathcliff, which garnered him his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The following year, he was again nominated for the same award for his portrayal of Maxim de Winter in Rebecca. In 1944, he produced, directed, and appeared as King Henry V of England in Henry V. The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, although it failed to win in any competitive category; instead Olivier received a \"Special Award\" for his work on the film.[3] His next film, Hamlet (1948), became the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and he also received the award for Best Actor.[4][a] In 1979 Olivier was presented with an Academy Honorary Award to recognise his lifetime of contribution to the art of film. In total, he was nominated for nine other acting Academy Awards, plus one for the direction of Hamlet.[7] For his stage work, Olivier won three Evening Standard Theatre Awards and was nominated for a Tony Award. He made his television debut in 1956, and was subsequently nominated nine times for an Emmy Award, winning on five occasions; he was also nominated for two British Academy Television Awards for his work in the medium.\n\nIn 1947, Olivier was appointed a Knight Bachelor,[9] and in 1970, he was given a life peerage;[10] the Order of Merit was conferred on him in 1981.[11] He also received honours from foreign governments. In 1949 he was made Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog by the Danish government; the French appointed him Officier, Legion of Honour, in 1953; the Italian government created him Grande Ufficiale, Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, in 1953; and in 1971 he was granted the Order of Yugoslav Flag with Golden Wreath.\n\nFrom academic and other institutions, Olivier received honorary doctorates from the university of Tufts, Massachusetts (1946), Oxford (1957) and Edinburgh (1964). He was also awarded the Danish Sonning Prize for outstanding contributions to European culture in 1966, the Gold Medallion of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities in 1968; and the Albert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1976.[12][b] In February 1960 for his contribution to the film industry, Olivier was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with a star at 6319 Hollywood Boulevard;[14] he is also included in the American Theater Hall of Fame.[15] In 1977 Olivier was awarded a British Film Institute Fellowship.\n\nIn addition to the naming of the National Theatre's largest auditorium in his honour, Olivier is commemorated in the Laurence Olivier Awards, bestowed annually since 1984 by the Society of London Theatre.[12] In 1991 Olivier's friend, the actor John Gielgud, unveiled a memorial stone commemorating Olivier in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey. In 2007, the centenary of Olivier's birth, a life-sized statue of him was unveiled on the South Bank, outside the National Theatre;[18] the same year the British Film Institute held a retrospective season of his film work.[19]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nAwards and nominations for Olivier's film work Film Year Award Category Result Wuthering Heights 1940 Academy Award Best Actor Nominated [21] Rebecca 1941 Academy Award Best Actor Nominated [21] Henry V 1946 National Board of Review Award Best Actor Won [22] Henry V 1946 New York Film Critics Circle Award Best Actor Won [23] Henry V 1947 Academy Award Best Actor Nominated [21] Henry V 1947 Academy Honorary Award Honorary award: \"To Laurence Olivier for his outstanding achievement as actor, producer and director in bringing Henry V to the screen\" Recipient [24] Hamlet 1948 Venice Film Festival Grand International Prize of Venice (Best Film) Won [25] Hamlet 1948 New York Film Critics Circle Award Best Actor Won [26] Hamlet 1949 Golden Globe Award Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama Won [27] Hamlet 1949 Academy Award Best Actor Won [21] Hamlet 1949 Academy Award Best Directing Nominated [21] Hamlet 1949 Bodil Awards Best European Film Won [28] Henry V 1950 Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Nastro d'Argento for Best Director (Silver Ribbon) Nominated [29] Carrie 1953 British Academy Film Award Best British Actor Nominated [30] Richard III 1956 British Academy Film Award Best Actor in a Leading Role Won [30] Richard III 1956 6th Berlin International Film Festival Silver Bear International Prize Won [31] Richard III 1957 Academy Award Best Actor Nominated [21] Richard III 1957 David di Donatello Awards Best Foreign Actor Won [32] Richard III 1957 David di Donatello Awards Best Foreign Producer Won [32] Richard III 1957 Jussi Awards Best Foreign Actor Won The Prince and the Showgirl 1958 British Academy Film Award Best British Actor Nominated [30] The Devil's Disciple 1960 British Academy Film Award Best British Actor Nominated [30] The Entertainer 1960 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival Best Actor Won [33] Spartacus 1961 Golden Globe Award Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama Nominated [27] The Entertainer 1961 British Academy Film Award Best British Actor Nominated [30] The Entertainer 1961 Academy Award Best Actor Nominated [21] Term of Trial 1963 British Academy Film Award Best British Actor Nominated [30] Othello 1966 Academy Award Best Actor Nominated [21] Othello 1967 National Society of Film Critics Best Actor Nominated [34] Oh!
