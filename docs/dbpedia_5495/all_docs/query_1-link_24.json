        "text": "Internationally recognised as the highest honour in British theatre, the Olivier Awards are equivalent to the BAFTA Awards, BRIT Awards, France’s Molière Award, and Broadway’s Tony Awards.\n\nThe first awards ceremony was held in 1976 at the Hotel Café Royal in London. The winners are decided by members of the public with a passion for London theatre, distinguished industry professionals, and theatre luminaries.\n\nFrom incredible performances to the hottest shows, the Olivier Awards recognise talent on and offstage.\n\nThe History of the Olivier Awards\n\nAwarded by the Society of London Theatre, the awards are held annually in London to professionals involved in West End productions alongside non-commercial theatres in the capital.\n\nOriginally named Society of West End Theatre Awards, these awards were changed to The Laurence Olivier Awards in 1984 in honour of actor Laurence Olivier. The awards have been held at a variety of distinguished venues, moving to the Royal Albert Hall in 2017.\n\nBorn in 1907, Sir Lawrence Olivier is seen by many as the greatest performer of any generation. This legendary actor and director had a 60-year long career resulting in multiple Academy Awards nominations and wins. He also received honours that no other actor before him had been given.\n\nDid you know that the award statues feature Lawrence Olivier as he appeared in 1937’s Henry V at the Old Vic?\n\nHow are the Winners Chosen Every Year?\n\nWith such stunning plays and performances nominated each year, it’s easy to imagine the intense and lively debates behind the scenes. The four panels judging the nominees – Opera, Theatre, Dance, and Affiliates – are overseen by the Society of London Theatre.\n\nThe Theatre awards are decided in two stages: the Theatre panel compiles a list of productions and individuals in categories that the panel deem are worthy of special attention. Afterwards, the list is submitted to members of the Society of London Theatre so they can vote. Except for the Supporting Actor/Actress categories, the members can vote outside of the list for the other categories.\n\nAfter the members vote, the list of nominees is created alongside the panellists’. In the second stage, both members and panellists vote on the overall shortlist of nominees to decide on the winners.\n\nWith the Opera, Dance, and Affiliates awards, panellists choose shows that they deem most worthy of receiving an Olivier Awards. The nominations in all relevant categories are then created and voted on at the end of the judging phase to decide on winners.\n\nOnly the Chief Executive of the Society of London Theatre, the statuettes’ engraver, and the Awards Office know who the winners are until the ceremony.\n\nThe Award Categories"
