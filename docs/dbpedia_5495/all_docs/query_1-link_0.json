The Oliviers were established as the Society of West End Theatre Awards in 1976, and renamed in 1984 in honour of English actor and director Laurence Olivier.\n\nThis award was first given in 1977, then was replaced in 1985 by the commingled actor/actress Best Performance in a Supporting Role, which replaced the 1977 to 1984 pair of Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role awards. From 1991 to 2012, the general supporting category vacillated at random between the commingled singular award (presented for 12 different seasons) and the pair of awards (presented for the other 11 seasons); the commingled award was last given in 2012, and the split pair of Best Actor and Best Actress awards have been presented every year since.\n\nYear Actor Play Character 1977 Nigel Hawthorne Privates on Parade Major Giles Flack Michael Pennington Romeo and Juliet Mercutio Paul Rogers The Madras House Henry Huxtable Patrick Ryecart Candida Eugene Marchbanks 1978 Robert Eddison Twelfth Night Andrew Aguecheek / Feste Michael Bryant The Double Dealer Sir Paul Plyant Julian Glover Coriolanus Aufidius Robert Stephens Brand Mayor 1979 Patrick Stewart Antony and Cleopatra Enobarbus Michael Bryant Undiscovered Country Dr. von Aigner Stephen Greif Death of a Salesman Biff David Suchet Once in a Lifetime Herman Glogauer\n\nYear Actor Play Character 1980 David Threlfall Nicholas Nickleby Angry Gentleman / Smike Simon Callow Amadeus Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Edward Petherbridge Nicholas Nickleby Newman Noggs John Rogan Juno and the Paycock Joxer Daly 1981 Joe Melia Good Maurice Tony Church Hamlet Polonius Norman Rodway Shadow of a Gunman Seuman Shields Tom Wilkinson Hamlet Horatio 1982 David Healy Guys and Dolls Nicely Nicely Johnson Geoffrey Hutchings A Midsummer Night's Dream Bottom Stephen Moore All's Well That Ends Well Parolles Paul Rogers The Importance of Being Earnest Rev.
