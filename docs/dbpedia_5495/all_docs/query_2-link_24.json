        "text": "— The black-and-white silent film The Artist came away with the most prizes with three wins at the Golden Globes, but the show spread the love around among a broad range of films and TV shows.\n\nWins for The Artist included best musical or comedy and best actor in a musical or comedy for Jean Dujardin, while the family drama The Descendants claimed two awards, for best drama and for dramatic actor for its star, George Clooney.\n\nOther acting winners were Meryl Streep, Michelle Williams, Christopher Plummer and Octavia Spencer, while Martin Scorsese earned the directing honor.\n\nStreep won for dramatic actress as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, her eighth win at the Globes.\n\nWilliams won for actress in a musical or comedy as Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn, 52 years after Monroe’s win for the same prize at the Globes. Dujardin won for musical or comedy actor for The Artist.\n\nThe supporting-actor Globes went to Plummer as an elderly widower who comes out as gay in the father-son drama Beginners and Spencer as a brassy housekeeper joining other black maids to share stories about life with their white employers in the 1960s Deep South tale The Help.\n\nScorsese won for the Paris adventure Hugo. It was the third directing Globe in the last 10 years for Scorsese, who previously won for Gangs of New York and The Departed and received the show’s Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement two years ago.\n\nHe won over a field of contenders that included Michel Hazanavicius, who had been considered by many in Hollywood as a favorite for his film The Artist.\n\nDujardin became the first star in a silent film to earn a major Hollywood prize since the early days of film. He won as a silent-era star whose career unravels amid the rise of talking pictures in the late 1920s.\n\nIt’s a breakout role in Hollywood for Dujardin, a star back home in France but little known to U.S. audiences previously. His French credits include The Artist creator Michel Hazanavicius’ spy spoofs OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies and OSS 117: Lost in Rio.\n\nThe Artist, which led the Globes with six nominations, also won the musical-score prize for composer Ludovic Bource but lost out on three other awards, including the screenplay prize for Michel Hazanavicius.\n\nWoody Allen won the screenplay honor for his romantic fantasy Midnight in Paris, the filmmaker’s biggest hit in decades. Never a fan of movie awards, Allen was a no-show at the Globes, where he previously won the screenplay honor for 1985’s The Purple Rose of Cairo.\n\nThe wins boost Williams, Spencer and Plummer’s prospects for slots at next month’s Academy Awards, whose nominations come out Jan. 24.\n\nThe Oscars are an honor for which Monroe herself never was nominated, though she was a two-time nominee at the Globes and won for best actress in a musical or comedy for 1959’s Some Like It Hot.\n\nIn My Week with Marilyn, Williams plays Monroe as an insecure performer struggling to establish herself as a genuine actress rather than a movie star sexpot just a couple of years before Some Like It Hot. The film chronicles Monroe’s contentious time shooting the 1957 romance The Prince and the Showgirl alongside exasperated director and co-star Laurence Olivier.\n\nThe prize for best animated film went to Steven Spielberg’s action tale The Adventures of Tintin, a Paramount-Sony co-production that dealt the first Globes loss to Disney unit Pixar Animation. Pixar films such as Ratatouille, WALL-E and Toy Story 3 had won all five previous times since the Globes added the category.\n\nThe Iranian drama A Separation was chosen as best foreign language film. Writer-director Asghar Farhadi uses a divorcing couple’s domestic troubles with a young child and an aging parent as the means to examine gender, religious and class distinctions in contemporary Iran.\n\nMadonna, Julie Frost and Jimmy Harry won the Globe for best song for “Masterpiece” from the King Edward-Wallis Simpson drama W.E., which Madonna also directed.\n\nAmong television winners were Kate Winslet as best actress in a miniseries or movie in Mildred Pierce, Idris Elba as best actor in a miniseries or movie in Luther, Laura Dern as comedy or musical actress in Enlightened, Kelsey Grammer as dramatic actor in Boss, Homeland for drama series and Downton Abbey for miniseries or movie."
