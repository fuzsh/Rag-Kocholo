        "text": "It may describe itself as a “small room” and “local theatre”, but the Almeida proved itself anything but a theatrical minnow as it took home a remarkable eight awards at the Oliviers on Sunday night - a third of the total.\n\nThe theatre, based in Islington and seating just 325 people, was home to Chimerica, which won five awards including best new play and best director, and Ghosts, which won three.\n\nActors hailed the small venue as being the “best way to do theatre”, as director Sir Richard Eyre said the experience was an “emancipation” after the pressure of the West End.\n\nHis play, Ghosts, won best revival as its star Lesley Manville beat Dame Judi Dench to win her first best actress award.\n\nManville triumphed over veteran Dame Judi, who has won seven Olivier Awards in her career as well as picking up Bafta, Oscar and Golden Globe nominations this year.\n\n“Where have you been all my life?” she asked as she picked up her first Olivier. “I’m so happy, I’m fizzing with delight.”\n\nWriting ahead of the announcement yesterday, he said the theatres of Shaftesbury Avenue were “heavily indebted” to the smaller houses, “where risk-taking and excellence are the watchwords.”\n\nIt is the first Olivier awards for the Almeida since 2006, when it won four for Hedda Gabler. The theatre is now run by artistic director Rupert Goold, following 11 years with Michael Attenborough at the helm.\n\nBest Actor Rory Kinnear and Best Actress Lesley Manville (PA)\n\nAt the National Theatre, which in contrast houses more than 1,000 ticket-holders in its Olivier theatre, Rory Kinnear took home the award for best actor for his role in Othello.\n\nIt is his first Olivier for best actor, after winning best supporting performance in 2008 for The Man Of Mode.\n\nLesley Manville took home her first best actress Olivier for her starring role in Ibsen’s Ghosts, which has since transferred to Trafalgar Studios, pipping Anna Chancellor for Private Lives, Hayley Atwell for The Pride and Dame Judi Dench.\n\nDame Judi, who was nominated for her appearance in Peter and Alice at the Noel Coward Theatre, missed out on what has been considered her final chance for a major award this season, after also being nominated for a Bafta, Golden Globe and Oscar for her film Philomena.\n\nIn a ceremony at the Royal Opera House, hosted by Stephen Mangan and Gemma Arterton, the industry hailed the Almeida Theatre and Chimerica as the “big winners” of the night.\n\nMangan himself also picked up an award, as Jeeves & Wooster In Perfect Nonsense won best new comedy.\n\nThe cast of 'The Book Of Mormon' (GETTY)\n\nThe Book of Mormon, which opened in London last year to critical and popular acclaim, dominated the musical categories, taking home four awards including best new musical and best actor in a musical for Gavin Creel.\n\nThe National Theatre was also recognised, with Sir Nick Hytner and Nick Starr, the artistic and executive directors, receiving a Special Award for outstanding achievement. It will be their last year working in partnership at the National before moving on to a new joint pursuit, with Rufus Norris set to take the helm.\n\nJack Lowden: Best Actor in a Supporting Role (PA)\n\nGhosts, directed by Sir Richard Eyre, won three awards in total, with Manville’s best actress matched by Jack Lowden for best supporting actor and the award for best revival.\n\nSir Richard missed out on the best director award, which went to Lyndsey Turner for Chimerica.\n\nFollowing the award for best revival, the first of the evening, he said the experience of working out of the West End had been “emancipating”.\n\n“You’re not panicking about what you can fill the theatre every night, there’s none of the hysterical pressure as when there’s an awful lot of cash and reputations hanging on it,” he said. “It’s relaxed, and people produce their best work when they’re relaxed.”\n\nManville and Lowden both praised the intimacy of a small theatre, with the proximity actors to their audience making it the “best way to do theatre”.\n\nMerrily We Roll Along, at the Harold Pinter Theatre, won best musical revival while the long-running Les Miserables took home the Radio 2 Audience Award.\n\nNigel Planer, Special Award winner Michael White and Kate Moss (GETTY)\n\nMichael White was presented with a special award for his long career in the industry, unexpectedly handed to him by his “good friend”, the supermodel Kate Moss.\n\nThe show, broadcast on ITV, also saw the reunion of ABBA’s Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus, for a performance to celebrate 15 years of Mamma Mia! on the stage.\n\nThe 2014 Olivier Awards were held tonight.
