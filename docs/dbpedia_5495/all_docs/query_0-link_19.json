        "text": "L et's talk about actors. That four out of the five Oscar nominees for best actor of 1983 are British must tell us something, though exactly what is open to interpretation. It could be that the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are feeling especially One Worldish this year, or that British actors really are better than American.\n\nThe truth, though, may be even more significant. That is, that most American films these days simply do not offer as many interesting roles for men as for women. This is something of an irony, considering all the words that have been written in recent years - sometimes in this space - on the scarcity of good roles for women. It may be time to hear it for the guys. They now seem to be the ones who are being stereotyped as sex objects, mostly brawny and often psychotic.\n\nI've no great quarrel with the recently announced list of best actor nominees: Michael Caine, ''Educating Rita''; Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay, ''The Dresser''; Tom Conti, ''Reuben, Reuben''; and Robert Duvall, ''Tender Mercies.'' Both ''Tender Mercies'' and ''Reuben, Reuben'' are American films, of course, with good roles for actors. By chance, the leading character in ''Reuben, Reuben'' is a Scottish poet, whom the British Mr. Conti plays beautifully. I doubt that any American actor except, possibly, Mr. Duvall, who's almost as facile with accents as Laurence Olivier, could have done it.\n\nYet the awful truth remains: If you are a good American actor and want to make it big in contemporary American movies, you've got to be able to upstage special effects and futuristic hardware, with little or no help from the screenwriters. That's not easy. Even as fine an actor as Roy Scheider couldn't compete with the space-age helicopter in ''Blue Thunder.''\n\nHarrison Ford is a highly competent performer, but it's unlikely he'll ever get a nomination for his continuing role as Han Solo in the ''Star Wars'' movies - he'll just get rich. He may have a better chance as Indiana Jones, though I doubt it. Richard Gere continues to do good work, in movies mainly about people, not machines, but neither the remake of ''Breathless'' nor ''The Honorary Consul'' provided him with material strong enough for serious consideration as an Oscar nominee.\n\nThere's certainly no conscious Hollywood policy behind the list of any year's Oscar nominees. Hollywood today is no more or less Anglophile than it's ever been. The Oscars have always been a crap game and, after all, only five people can be nominated. However, it's not simply a coincidence that this year the British dominate the best-actor category. There weren't really that many first-rate performances by American actors in leading roles.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
