        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 20 — With nominations for acting, writing, directing and best picture, Warren Beatty today became the 1978 Academy Award Renaissance Man for “Heaven Can Wait,” duplicating Orson Welles's four similar nominations for “Citizen Kane” in 1941. Strangely, another of the nominees for best picture in 1941 was “Here Comes Mr. Jordan,” the Robert Montgomery‐Claude Rains comedy about an athlete plucked out of his body 40 years too soon, on which “Heaven Can Wait” is based.\n\nWith nine nominations, “Heaven Can Wait,” a frothy comedy, joined two sober Vietnam War movies, “The Deer Hunter” (nine nominations) and “Coming Home” (eight), at the top of the Academy field. “Heaven Can Wait” and “The Deer Hunter” received nominations in five of the six major categories of best picture, direction and acting. (There are four acting awards.) “Coming Home” was nominated in all six categories.\n\nThere is usually a strong correlation between Academy nominations and box‐office success, but the blockbuster movie of the Christmas season, “Superman,” received only three minor nominations, and “Grease,” which has already taken in $130 million at the box office, was nominated only for best song. “Superman” has, however, already been voted a Special Achievement Award for Visual Effects.\n\nOlivier Is Nominated\n\nJoining “Coming Home,” “The Deer Hunter” and “Heaven Can Wait” in the race for best picture are “Midnight Express,” the saga of a young American narcotics smuggler trapped in a brutal Turkish prison, and “An Unmarried Woman,” the struggle, of a woman to make herself a new life after her husband walks out on her. Mildly surprising was the failure of “Days of Heaven,” the critically praised Gothic tale of itinerant farmer workers at the turn of the century, to secure a nomination.\n\nMore major surprises were the failure of Brad Davis, who played the hashish smuggler in “Midnight Express,” to be nominated as best actor and the nomination in that category of Laurence Olivier for his role as the aging Nazi‐hunter in “The Boys From Brazil.” Mr. Olivier has also been voted a special Academy Award by the Academy's board of governors “for the unique achievements of his entire career.”\n\nIn addition to Mr. Olivier and Mr. Beatty, the nominees for best actor are Gary Busey, for his portrayal of the young rock musician Buddy Holly in “The Buddy Holly Story”; Robert De Niro as the stalwart steelworker who survives Vietnam in “The Deer Hunter,” and Jon Voight as the paraplegic Vietnam veteran in “Coming Home.”\n\nThree previous Academy Award winners are in contention for the best actress award this year. Ingrid Bergman, who has won three Oscars, received her seventh nomination as the mother in Ingmar Bergman's claustrophobic examination of the relationship between a mother and daughter, “Autumn Sonata.” If she wins this year, she will become the only person to hold four Oscars for acting. Ellen Burstyn, who won an Oscar in 1974 for “Alice Doesn't Live Here Any More,” and Jane Fonda, who won an Oscar in 1971 for “Kiute,” were nominated for their roles as, respectively, a woman who has an adulterous affair one weekend each year for 25 years in “Same Time, Next Year,” and a young Army wife in “Corning Home.” The other two nominees are Geraldine Page as a tragic, suicidal wife in “Interiors” and Jill Clayburgh for “An Unmarried Woman.”\n\nWithin minutes after the nominations were announced at 9 A.M. today, insiders had zeroed in on the most surprising omission from the list of nominees - the failure of Paul Mazursky to be nominated as best director for “An Unmarrie4 Woman.” In recent years, the nominees for the Directors Guild of America Award have been almost identical to the academy's nominees and the winner of the guild's award has also won the Oscar. This year, Hal Ashby (“Coming Home”), Warren Beatty and Buck Henry (“Heaven Can Wait”), Michael Cimino (“The Deer Hunter”) and Alan Parker (“Midnight Express”) received both the guild's and the academy's nominations. However, Mr. Mazursky, a guild nominee, lost his place in the Oscar race to Woody Allen (“Interiors”). A victory for Mr. Allen would be his second\n\nCo‐Directors Are Cited\n\nThe failure of Terrence Malick (“Days of Heaven”) to get a nomination as best director was less unexpected. Despite the fact that Mr. Malick won the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, Mr. Malick's name had not appeared on the Directors Guild of America list. Another oddity in the directing nominations was the co-nomination of Warren Beatty and Buck Henry for “Heaven Can Wait,” the first time such a co‐direction has been honored.\n\nNone of the 10 nominees in the supporting actor and supporting actress categories has previously won a supporting‐player award. Maggie Smith —nominated, ironically, for her role as an Academy nominee in “California Suite” — did, however, win as best actress for “The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie” in 1969. Her four competitors are Dyan Cannon, as a hysterically murderous wife in “Heaven Can Wait”; Penelope Milford as the sister of a crazed veteran in “Coming Home”; Maureen Stapleton as the earthy woman who smashes the belljar of “Interiors,” and Meryl Streep as the girl who is left behind in “The Deer Hunter.”\n\nFour of the five actors nominated for best supporting actor are first‐time nominees for an Academy Award. They. include Bruce Dern as Jane Fonda's rigid Army‐captain husband in “Coming Home”; Richard Farnsworth as a grizzled ranch hand in “Comes A Horseman”; John Hurt as a prisoner who assuages his suffering with hashish in “Midnight Express,” and Christopher Walken as the sensitive boy who learns to love a deadly game in “The Deer Hunter.” Jack Warden, nominated for his role as Warren Beatty's trainer in “Heaven Can Wait,” was also nominated for “Shampoo” in 1975.\n\nAmerican Writers Lead\n\nNominations for best foreign-language film of 1978 went to “Get Out Your Handkerchiefs” (France), “The Glass Cell” (West Germany), “Hungarians” (Hungary), “Viva Italia!” (Italy) and “White Bim Black Ear” (U.S.S.R.). Nineteen countries entered films. Sweden originally refused to submit Mr. Bergman's “Autumn Sonata,” then changed its mind too late to place the picture in contention.\n\nFor the second year in a row the writing nominations went primarily to successful mainstream American pictures. For the best screenplay based on material from another medium, Neil Simon was nominated for “California Suite”; Elaine May and Warren Beatty for “Heaven Can Wait”; Oliver Stone for “Midnight Express,” and Bernard Slade for “Same Time, Next Year.” The only box‐office failure to be nominated in this category is “Bloodbrothers,” screenplay by Walter Newman.\n\nIn the original‐screenplay category, Ingmar Bergman was nominated for “Autumn Sonata”; Nancy Dowd, Waldo Salt and Robert C. Jones for “Coming Home”; Deric Washburn for “The Deer Hunter” ; Woody Allan for “Interiors,” and Paul Mazursky for “An Unmarried Woman.”\n\nJane Fonda and Jon Voight in “Coming Home,” nominated as the best movie. Miss Fonda and Mr: Voight won the best‐actor nominations, and Hal Ashby best director. Jill Clayburgh, nominated as best actress, with Alan Bates p “An Unmarried Woman,” nominated as best motion oicture."
