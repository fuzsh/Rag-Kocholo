The Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical is an annual award presented by the Society of London Theatre in recognition of achievements in commercial London theatre. The awards were established as the Society of West End Theatre Awards in 1976, and renamed in 1984 in honour of English actor and director Laurence Olivier.

This award was created in 2015, along with the Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical, to replace the singular award for Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Supporting Role in a Musical, which existed from 1991 to 2014.
