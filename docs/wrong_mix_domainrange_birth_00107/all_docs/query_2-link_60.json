        "text": "Michael Bryan Wang was born and raised in New Jersey, where he began his dance training at the age of 16. His passion for dance evolved from a love of the arts at a very young age. Michael pursued danced more fully following his experience with singing and musical theater. He went on to graduate magna cum laude from Marymount Manhattan College, where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Dance, with a concentration in ballet. Michael has also continued his training with intensives at Nederlands Dans Theater, Jacob's Pillow Contemporary Program, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago and Movement Invention Project.\n\nFollowing graduation, Michael performed with Los Angeles contemporary dance company, BODYTRAFFIC. He has performed in works by Yin Yue, Stephen Petronio, Gerald Arpino, Jiri Kylian, Stijn Celis, Doug Varone, Larry Keigwin, and Robert Battle, among others. Michael was a member of New York dance companies: ZviDance, 10 Hairy Legs, and Megan Williams Dance Projects. He was a full time resident of the McKittrick Hotel, performing in Punchdrunk’s Sleep No More NYC– the award winning immersive theater production. Soon after, Michael made his Broadway debut in Beetlejuice on Broadway. He is currently performing in Moulin Rouge! The Musical as a swing and the assistant dance captain.\n\nMichael is also passionate about sharing all he has learned to others. He believes in giving back to the community through sharing dance and has taught people of all different ages and abilities. He has taught students in studios and schools within the greater NY area, and has conducted educational outreach programs to children in public schools as well. Michael strives to instill the inherent values in dance training, such as creativity, discipline, problem-solving, communication, collaboration, and self-discovery, to name a few - to all of his students."
