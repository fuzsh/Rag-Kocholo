        "text": "Unquestionably, Bob and Mike Bryan are the faces of tennis doubles. Handsome, clean-cut faces for sure, but ones that few in the general public recognize. Together, they form the face of a largely invisible sport.\n\nAnd that's a shame, because tennis has no better ambassadors for the game. They are the caretakers of doubles, which too frequently gets shuttled to the background at tournaments. Some don't even put the players' pictures in the tournament program. They often play on back courts, unlike today when they take center stage for the lone Davis Cup doubles match in this quarterfinal tie.\n\nNo wonder the Bryans can walk undisturbed through airports, even though they are the sport's premier doubles team and are on a pace to end their careers — in a decade or so — as the winningest pair in sports this side of Andre Agassi and Steffi Graff.\n\n\"We have a good niche,\" Bob said. \"We play tennis, which we both love, but we can live normal lives.\"\n\nNormal, when you're talking about the Bryan brothers, is a relative term. These two Southern Californians — raised by their tennis-coach parents to play the game since they were 2 — are joined at the hip. And lip. They're unbelievably funny. They throw comical insults back and forth with rapid-fire volleys that equal anything they do on the court.\n\nThey are different. Bob's an inch taller, slightly heavier, and left-handed. Has a better serve. Mike's right-handed and great at returns. But they've been virtually inseparable since birth, identical twins born just two minutes apart.\n\nNot even marriage comes between them. So far. They insist little will change in their lives. Of course, they haven't been home since February. And they have lived on separate coasts since Bob married Miami lawyer Michelle Alvarez on Dec. 13. On a Monday, Bob pointed out.\n\n\"Monday weddings are cheaper,\" Bob said this week. \"Sunday weddings are cheap, but Mondays are even cheaper.\"\n\nEspecially when the caterer is ... Popeyes?\n\n\"Yeah, a little red beans and rice,\" Bob cracks.\n\nThe wedding was so small, the guest list totaled 12. Was Mike in the wedding party?\n\n\"He barely made the cut,\" Bob said.\n\nBut will he in the long run? They both insist yes, but it will be different. After all, these are two guys who, up until the I-do's, shared the same house, car, email address, ATM card — heck, the same checking account. So how did that work out, especially considering together they've earned more than $16 million in prize money?\n\nSurprisingly well.\n\nMike: \"It'd be like, ‘Hey, Bob, I'm at the store. You care if I get a computer?' ''\n\nBob: \"Yeah, as long as I get one.\"\n\nNow that Bob has taken a wife, one wonders if Mike will get one, too. For three years, he has dated Lucile Williams, an event coordinator from Wales. She just returned from a BMW corporate event in Monaco, but Mike admitted she has handled the logistics for a wedding before. Might she do another?\n\n\"He's feeling the shot clock,\" Bob said.\n\n\"Bob's kind of the test rat,\" Mike said. \"I'll give 'em a year (to see if it takes).\"\n\nGrowing up\n\nTheir world has shrunk some. The more they win, the more records they accumulate. Plus, as Bob said, \" ‘60 Minutes' helped.\"\n\nOr hurt. The iconic CBS newsmagazine show followed the pair for more than six months, and shot hours and hours of footage. While the piece has aired twice and showed them admiringly, their dad wasn't so fortunate.\n\nBoth of their parents are accomplished tennis players and top coaches. They tried to make tennis fun and even took the kids to play miniature golf after youth tournaments.\n\nBut Wayne Bryan was painted in a less than positive light. Like the time he threw their Nintendo video game off a cliff.\n\n\"Our dad was a little taken aback,\" Mike said. \"He sent the producer an email and ripped him apart.\"\n\nSince the show, the Bryans' tennis matches have attracted bigger crowds and more attention. Yet they're always reminded they're still playing doubles.\n\nDoubles is the equivalent of the eighth-inning setup man in baseball. Quick: Can you name the No. 2-ranked doubles team in the world? Try Max Mirnyi of Belarus and Daniel Nestor of Canada. Diane Sawyer's yet to interview them.\n\nUnlike a previous era, few top singles players enter doubles because the serve-and-volley singles game has given way to powerful baseliners, leading to longer, more physical matches and less energy for doubles competition.\n\nDuring three consecutive days in the first week of Wimbledon, the Bryans were primed to play on a show court, but singles matches went long, and their matches were postponed. Consequently, they had to play on six straight days and basically cram a Grand Slam event into one week.\n\nNo problem. They never faced a single match point, but were extended to a fifth set in one match before prevailing 16-14. Their Wimbledon title — their second — came a week ago today. Yet at 8 a.m. the next day, they caught a plane for a 10-hour flight to Austin to begin preparing for Davis Cup action.\n\nWith their 11th Grand Slam title, the Bryans matched the legendary Australian pair of Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde. And they're barely 33.\n\n\"They're far and away today the best team,\" Davis Cup teammate Mardy Fish said. \"They're going to go down as the best doubles team of all time. They still have five, six, seven, nine, 10 ... 20 years (left). They're not slowing down.\"\n\nToday, for one of the very few days on the sports calendar, the Bryans will be at the epicenter of the tennis world.\n\nWith the match between them and Spaniards Feliciano Lopez and Fernando Verdasco the only one of the day in this showdown, the stepchild of professional sports grows up.\n\nAfter today, the brothers will set their sights on Grand Slam No. 12 at the U.S. Open, a tournament they won last year for the third time.\n\nAnd their checking account? Well, they have separate ones now, revealing one bond that has been broken.\n\n\"My account details are secret now,\" Mike said.\n\n\"I know your password, dude,\" Bob chipped in. \"I could suck you dry.\"\n\nIn the meantime, they invigorate a sport they love and a part of tennis that is so much more than a sideshow.\n\nThey don't figure to quit any time soon.\n\n\"Yeah, when we're 80,\" Mike said. \"Bob will be on his seventh wife.\"\n\n\"And you'll be playing wheelchair tennis,\" Bob fired back.\n\nkbohls@statesman.com; 445-3772"
