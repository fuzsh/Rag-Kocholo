        "text": "Raised in California, Michael Bryan spent most of his life there until he and his wife, moved to Bartlesville, Oklahoma, in 2007. He began enjoying photography at the age of 8 and by age 10, he was in the dark room with his father, James Bryan. However, his photography was muted for many years when he lived in southern California, predominantly because of a fast paced life. Moving to the Osage in northeast Oklahoma has provided both time and a wealth of beautiful subjects that has taken Bryanâ€™s photography to a new level. His photography can be seen on the covers of magazines, journals and textbooks as well as in the home of a former Oklahoma Governor, the office of a former Oklahoma Congressman (Jim Bridenstine) and in the Prairie Room at the Pioneer Woman's (Ree Drummond) Boarding House Hotel in Pawhuska, Oklahoma.\n\nThe \"Sunflowers and Old Wood\" Barn photo is probably my most loved photo. It won the Nikonian International User Forum Best of 2011 contest for a High Dynamic Range photography. It was taken on Drummond property, about 5 miles west of Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Sadly the old barn blew down in 2018, but not before I captured it in summer, winter, spring and fall, with cattle, crop dusters, storm clouds and waiving grass.\n\nAn education in engineering and biology has enabled me to see the incredible design in nature around us. I am driven to capture such examples to share with others. My desire is that my photography will reflect well the beauty and design in the things that God has made."
