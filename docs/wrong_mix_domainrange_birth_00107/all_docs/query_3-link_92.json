        "text": "Livingston “Nut” Lewis, 84, U.S. Army Veteran of Bladenboro went home to be with the Lord on Thursday, July 11, 2024, while at UNC Chapel Hill Hospital. He was born and raised in Bladen County on October 3, 1939, the son of the late Jessie Lewis and Ada Jones Lewis.\n\nNut was a dedicated husband, father, grandfather, friend and citizen. He was a long time member of the New Center Baptist Church where he served in many capacities, including deacon, treasurer, and Sunday School Superintendent. He served as the Mayor of Bladenboro for 20 years and was a member of the Bladenboro Rotary Club for 31 years.\n\nAs a young man, he was a member of the Bladenboro Spinners, a semipro baseball team.\n\nNut enjoyed playing golf, shagging, and watching sports, especially his North Carolina Tar Heel's Team. He often joked about his golf game being better than his age. When not golfing, He could often be found seated at the “Table of Knowledge” at Diamond Dave’s Grill where they solved the community’s problems and had a meal all at the same time. He was the recipient of the Long Leaf Pine award. Nut truly was a man of many talents who lived a life upholding the Rotary Motto, “Service Above Self\" by serving his country, his town and his church. His legacy of love, dedication and citizenship will live on for years to come.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, his beloved wife, Margie Lewis and one sister, Edna Mae Hall. Left to cherish his memory are son, Michael Lewis (Tina) of Ocean Isle Beach, daughter Pamela D. Lewis of the home, sister Geraldine Nance of Bladenboro, grandchildren Kayla Meir, Kristin Long (J.T.), Cameron Lewis, and Kyle Lewis, two great grandchildren Blaize and Zoi Fowler, and a dear friend, Emmie Fitzgerald."
