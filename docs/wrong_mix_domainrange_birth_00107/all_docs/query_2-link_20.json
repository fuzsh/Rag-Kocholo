        "text": "I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, and worked as an illustrator, a graphic artist, and an electro-mechanical designer as an adult. I began working in the children’s ministry of my home church after accepting the Lord in 1977.\n\nI married my wife Sue in 1984, and immediately went into full-time ministry as the Youth Pastor and Outreach Director of East Bay Faith Center in San Leandro, California. There, my wife and I also became active in short-term missions work as well as with children and teens. In 1989, we moved to Tulsa Oklahoma, where I graduated from Rhema Bible College while working for Willie George Ministries and Church On The Move in Tulsa. We traveled as Children’s Evangelists in the U.S. and abroad until our move to The Rock Church and World Outreach Center in 1994. We served as the Children’s Pastors at The Rock until 2022.\n\nNow, my wife and I oversee a ministry for members over 60 years old called S.A.L.T. (Senior Adults Living Triumphantly), teach classes in The Rock Bible College, as well as oversee the Pastoral Care Department which includes weddings, funerals, baptisms, hospital visits, Lifeline, and Spiritual Guidance appointments.\n\nWe presently have three adult children and four grandchildren."
