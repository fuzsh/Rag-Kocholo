        "text": "New endorsements build upon Edwards' strong base of support in his home state\n\nColumbia, South Carolina â€“ Today, as Senator John Edwards campaigns in Charleston, the Edwards campaign announced new endorsements from state and local community leaders and released a list of more than 80 South Carolina endorsements from some of the state's most respected leaders. The new endorsements, which include State House Members Karl Allen of Greenville and Vida Miller of Pawleys Island as well as five current mayors, come at a time of growing momentum for the Edwards campaign in the Palmetto State.\n\nAs a sign of support and commitment to the state where he was born, Edwards is the first of the Democratic candidates to return to South Carolina following the New Hampshire primary. His homecoming trip to the state included a rally in Clemson, where more than 1,000 supporters came out to welcome back their native son. Edwards also held a rally in Columbia yesterday, and later today he will volunteer with supporters at a Charleston food bank.\n\nFueled by Edwards' strong finish in the Iowa Caucuses on January 3rd, the Edwards campaign has raised more than one million dollars online in the past week. Edwards leads the Democratic field in both campaign stops and money raised in South Carolina. Edwards is the only Democratic candidate to ever win election in a \"red\" state, and his campaign boasts an impressive statewide grassroots organization in South Carolina.\n\nThe list of South Carolina leaders who have endorsed John Edwards for president includes:\n\nSenator John Drummond, President Pro Tempore Emeritus, South Carolina State Senate\n\nAbbeville, Greenwood and Laurens Counties\n\nSenator John Land, South Carolina State Senate Democratic Leader\n\nCalhoun, Clarendon, Florence, and Sumter Counties\n\nSenator Brad Hutto, South Carolina State Senate\n\nAllendale, Bamberg, Barnwell, and Orangeburg Counties\n\nSenator Peden McLeod, Former South Carolina State Senator\n\nColleton County\n\nSenator Jim Bryan, Former South Carolina State Senator\n\nLaurens County\n\nRepresentative Vida Miller, South Carolina State House\n\nCharleston and Georgetown Counties\n\nRepresentative Bill Clyburn, South Carolina State House\n\nAiken and Edgefield Counties\n\nRepresentative Leon Howard, South Carolina Representative and State Legislative Black Caucus Chair\n\nRichland County\n\nRepresentative Karl Allen, South Carolina State House\n\nGreenville County\n\nRepresentative Bill Bowers, South Carolina State House\n\nColleton and Hampton Counties\n\nRepresentative Grady Brown, South Carolina State House\n\nLee and Sumter Counties\n\nRepresentative Chris Hart, South Carolina State House\n\nRichland County\n\nRepresentative Lonnie Hosey, South Carolina State House\n\nAllendale and Barnwell Counties\n\nRepresentative Leon Stavrinakis, South Carolina State House\n\nCharleston County\n\nRepresentative Ted Vick, South Carolina State House\n\nChesterfield County\n\nFormer State Representative Dave C.
