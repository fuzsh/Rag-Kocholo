        "text": "Henry W. Sharpe, III, known as \"Treye,\" was born in Augusta, GA, on March 24, 1972, to Henry W. Sharpe, Jr. and Toni Ann Purvis Satcher and is a lifelong resident of Graniteville, SC. Treye graduated from Midland Valley High School in 1991 and began his career in funeral service with George Funeral Homes Inc. in Aiken, SC, in 1992. In 1995 he entered Gupton-Jones College of Funeral Service in Decatur, GA and graduated with honors on August 13, 1996. After graduation, he returned to Aiken and in 2006 an opportunity to join the team at Hatcher Funeral Home became available and he became a part of the team. He has a daughter Amanda and a son, Noah. A master mason, he is a member of Star Lodge #99, A.F.M., where he currently is serving as Worshipful Master. He is the father of Amanda and Noah and also has two four-legged daughters....\"Trixie\" and \"Luna\". In his spare time, he enjoys \"wetting a hook\", gardening and working around the house. Treye holds funeral director and embalmer licensure in South Carolina (SC#2323)\n\nBryan grew up in Williston, SC, and is a 2008 graduate of Williston-Elko High School. Bryan has been working for Hatcher Funeral Home & Cremation Service since 2016 as a part-time employee and the opportunity became available for him to become part of our full-time staff in 2021. Prior to becoming full-time, he graduated in 2014 from the SC Criminal Justice Academy and is a former South Carolina State Trooper. He married Rachael in 2012 and they have two little boys, Colton and Camden. In his spare time, he likes to spend time with his family, be outdoors, and watch South Carolina Football and NASCAR. Bryan is currently pursuing his funeral directing and embalming license. Bryan is an South Carolina Apprentice Funeral Director/Embalmer (SC #4298).\n\nWilliam Henry \"Billy\" Martin, 85, of Aiken SC, beloved husband of 63 years to Mrs. Patricia \"Pat\" Haskell Martin, entered into rest on Wednesday, March 1, 2017.\n\nBorn in Barnwell County, South Carolina and a resident of Aiken County SC for the past 57 years, he was the only child of the late Chomet S. Martin and Annie Darnell Martin. As a young man who graduated from Williston-Elko High School, he was an Eagle Scout and performed numerous acts of service all his many years on Earth. He entered Clemson A&M College in 1949 and was called to military service by the U. S. Army in 1953 during the Korean War.\n\nHe married Pat August 1, 1953 and had three children, Kathryn, Marty and Joy. In 1960 they moved to Aiken County SC where he enjoyed a successful career in building supply sales – at B&B Lumber Company, Montgomery-Crawford, Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Wickes, and Howard Lumber Company. He also worked at Hatcher Funeral Home in his off time, helping others in their most critical times of need.\n\nNever a stranger he had numerous friends throughout the years, many through his civic activities and his church. Always thinking of others and how he might be of help, he had many extracurricular activities and could be counted on for lots of fun. The Daytona 500 was his favorite, second only to cheering for his Clemson Tigers, yet he looked forward each week to his reading time with his Good News students at Clearwater Elementary School and his daily routine of exercise with his Silver Sneakers friends at the Odell Weeks Center.\n\nIn addition to his wife and parents, his family also included his children – Kathryn Rebecca Martin (Buddy Werts) of North Augusta SC, William Henry \"Marty\" Martin, Jr. (Kim) of Aiken SC, and Patricia Joyce \"Joy\" Stephenson (Michael) of Graniteville SC. and five grandsons – Jason Alexander Stroup (Meredith McGee) of Savannah; John Adam Stroup of Grovetown GA; Thomas Andrew \"Drew\" Martin (Abby) of Atlanta; Ryan Scott Martin (Allison Kays) of Marina del Ray, California and Zachery Michael Long of Graniteville, SC.\n\nIn honor of his commitment to service, his love of others and his dedication to God, we celebrate his life and strive to emulate his journey on this side of Heaven.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to: Lakeside Baptist Church, US Highway #1 Aiken-Augusta Highway, P. O. Box 1730, Clearwater SC 29822."
