OBITUARY

DIED--On the night of the 24th ultimo, Col. James Overstreet, of Barnwell District, S.C. after a short but painful illness. He was returning from Washington City with his lady, (whom he had recently married,) to his seat in South Carolina, after having discharged his duty as one of the representatives of the people of that state during the first session of the seventeenth Congress, enjoying in anticipation the treasures of home, and the society of intimate friends and relatives. On the Saturday morning previous, he reached Salisburg; after eating breakfast, he resumed his journey; but ere he had travelled ten miles, he became seriously ill. Having reached Mr. Partee's, ten miles from Salisbury, on the road leading to Charlotte, he was unable to proceed farther; and then death, that inexorable monster, terminated his mortal career.___Carolinium
