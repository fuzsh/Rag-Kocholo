        "text": "Central Epidemic Command Center\n\nAfter SARS, a number of prominent public health leaders, such as Dr. Chen Chien‐jen (an epidemiologist who served as minister of health at the time and as vice president in 2020) and Dr. Kuo Shu‐song (director of the TCDC in 2003) realized that it was not a matter of “whether” but “when” a large‐scale infectious disease would threaten Taiwan. They suggested preventive hoarding of first‐response equipment and medicines (such as Tamiflu). To streamline leadership and avoid confusion, they advocated setting up the National Health Command Center (NHCC) in 2004. The NHCC is designed to respond to large outbreaks swiftly and acts as a nerve center to mobilize resources, coordinate personnel, and provide advice guidelines during pandemics. This mission‐oriented ad hoc system includes the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), the Biological Pathogen Disaster Command Center, the Counter‐Bioterrorism Command Center, and the Central Medical Emergency Operations Center. This joint framework serves as a comprehensive platform for preventing epidemics. Its legal foundation is based on the Communicable Disease Control Act and the Enforcement Regulations Governing the Central Epidemic Command Center.\n\nOn January 20, 2020, the TCDC announced the activation of the CECC for severe special infectious pneumonia. The TCDC director‐general, Chou Chih‐haw (周志浩), was appointed as commander to integrate resources across government agencies and to further protect the health of the Taiwanese public from the outbreak. A cross‐agency command center meeting and an expert consultation meeting were held that day (TCDC 2020b). It was a level‐3 emergency establishment.\n\nWuhan City, China, was shut down starting beginning at 10 a.m. on January 23, indicating increasing coronavirus infections. The CECC announced that starting on January 23, the outbreak level for the Wuhan pneumonia would be escalated to level 2 and that the minister of health and welfare, Chen Shih‐Chung (陳時中), would act as commander (TCDC 2020c).\n\nOn February 27, Premier Su Tseng‐chang announced that he had accepted Minister Chen's recommendation to upgrade the CECC to a level‐1 facility in light of the mounting global urgency to contain the novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19). Minister Chen continued as commander. The premier explicitly instructed all agencies concerned to maintain the highest vigilance as the government continued to combat the outbreak, provide economic relief, and stimulate local industries. A cabinet meeting was held to propose an economic relief act, which was passed by the Congress on February 25, 2020. According to the Preparedness and Contingency Planning in Response to COVID‐19 Epidemic, the CECC was gradually upgraded, as table shows.\n\nTable 1\n\nLevelExtent of Outbreak and Risk AssessmentCommand Unit Activation Protocol1COVID‐19 epidemic confirmed in Wuhan, ChinaOrganize contingency team2Evident ongoing community spread of COVID‐19 in Wuhan, ChinaEstablish Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), appoint Taiwan CDC director as chief commander3Confirmed imported cases of COVID‐19 in communities in TaiwanEstablish Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), appoint minister of health and welfare as chief commander4Community spreading of COVID‐19 in TaiwanEstablish Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), appoint premier as chief commander\n\nAccording to the authorization of Enforcement Regulations Governing the Central Epidemic Command Center, the CECC commanding officer has the unified authority to command, supervise, and coordinate government organizations at various levels, public enterprises, reserve servicemen's organizations, and nongovernmental organizations to implement disease control matters. When necessary, support of the army may be coordinated. The commanding officer may instruct government organizations at various levels to requisition, expropriate, and integrate resources, facilities, or manpower of organizations (institutions) concerned. The CECC may invite one deputy minister or designated representative of each ministry, council, and commission concerned to be a member of the center.\n\nThe CECC hosted a daily press conference to announce further information about confirmed cases, infection sources, and related treatments. Representatives from related ministries were also required to attend and provide necessary explanations. This demonstrated a transparent operation and government decision‐making process, including a Q&A briefing, which helped stabilize the public and clarify the rumors and fake news.\n\nThe CECC/TCDC produced many one‐minute programs to play on cable television channels almost every hour for public health education. These included how to wear a mask, how to wash one's hands completely, how to keep proper social distance, and so on. They invited all specialties of physicians to explain how to avoid virus infection, including how to reduce stress and anxiety caused by quarantine. Figure details the structural response of the government.\n\nTaiwan is a unitary state. The central government is responsible for policy formulation and the local governments for implementation. According to the Communicable Disease Control Act, local governments are in charge of the following responsibilities:\n\nDevelop implementation plans and implement those plans according to the communicable disease control policies and plans formulated by the central government and locality‐specific disease control practices. Also report to the central competent authority for reference.\n\nImplement various communicable disease control measures in the locality, including immunization, prevention of communicable diseases, epidemiological surveillance, case reporting, investigations, laboratory testing, management, drills, mobilization by level, training, pharmaceutical, device and protective equipment stockpile, and home isolation.\n\nConduct quarantine of local ports.\n\nImplement matters instructed or commissioned by the central government.\n\nOther matters that shall be implemented by local competent authorities.\n\nQuarantine\n\nBy January 5, 2020, the TCDC began monitoring all individuals who had traveled to Wuhan within 14 days and exhibited a fever or symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. These people were screened for 26 known pathogens, including SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), and those tested positive were quarantined (Wang, Ng, and Brook 2020).\n\nAs of March 14, people returning directly to Taiwan from most of Europe, plus people who had transferred through China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Dubai, had to quarantine at home for 14 days (New York Times 2020). As of March 17, the only foreign nationals permitted into the country—those holding Alien Resident Certificates or those on urgent diplomatic, business, or other special missions—could rent a room in a public quarantine center (MOFA 2020). On March 20, the CECC raised the global travel notice to level 3, and Taiwanese citizens were advised to avoid all nonessential travel (TCDC 2020e).\n\nLocal governments cooperated with the CECC to ensure the quarantine. Based on these and later border controls, the CECC required all travelers arriving in Taiwan to be quarantined for 14 days and their information to be passed to local governments. Next, street‐level officers in district governments visited those quarantined to make sure that they were healthy and abiding by the requirement, and they were provided with an antivirus pack including masks and disinfectant. Those quarantined were fined if they went outside. The district governments were responsible for monitoring those quarantined by tracking their cellphones. The police also worked to find those quarantined who went outside or even tried to escape the quarantine.\n\nSocial Distancing\n\nThe CECC announced social distancing measures on April 1 to encourage the general public, in phases, to maintain social etiquette and observe social distancing. This further reduced the risk of community transmission of COVID‐19, which continued to spread across the globe. These measures sought to protect people's rights while bolstering epidemic prevention and control efforts, which could be undermined by infected people who did not seek medical help or were asymptomatic (TCDC 2020g).\n\nVery few COVID‐19 cases were found in Taiwan: only 55 cases were attributable to community transmission, plus another 31 from the Panshi fast supply war ship. This was in contrast to the significant number of 343 imported cases, either early on from Wuhan or later from students and travelers returning from around the world. Because of the low infection and death rates, the high standards and professionalism of the health care system and workers, and the NHI scheme, Taiwanese abroad generally felt that they wanted to be back home. Their return also made quarantining and social distancing very important.\n\nThe rules specified separate social distancing standards for restaurants, school campuses, offices, mass transport, supermarkets, other commercial sites, locations with long lines of waiting people, and special institutions such as long‐term care facilities and prisons. During the continuing COVID‐19 outbreak, social distancing is to be followed to prevent community transmission and to protect oneself and others. Public participation and acceptance have been a crucial factor, and fines and charges for disobedience have been very few. This is an exceptional example of democratic concern for the public good.\n\nCellphone Tracking\n\nOn April 8, the CECC announced that a Line Bot system called Disease Containment Expert, developed jointly by the CECC, Line Taiwan, and HTC Corporation's health care unit DeepQ, would be officially launched for use on April 3 to track people in home quarantine. The CECC also added a new function to the current SMS (Short Message Service) reporting mechanism, allowing those in home quarantine or isolation to report their health status via SMS (TCDC 2020h).\n\nWith the Line Bot system, those in home quarantine can voluntarily report their health status to the disease prevention staff every day and obtain information concerning disease prevention. Those in home quarantine can use the Line Bot system by clicking a link, sent to them via SMS, to add the Disease Containment Expert to the friend list on Line and then complete the identity verification process. In addition to information on disease prevention and health status reporting, the system sends home quarantine–related details and notes to users two days before the end of the home quarantine period to remind them to conduct an additional seven‐day period of self–health management. In addition to the Line Bot system, on April 5, the CECC began to send SMS messages every day to track the health status of those in home quarantine and home isolation. The quarantined and isolated people can directly reply to the messages to report their health conditions."
