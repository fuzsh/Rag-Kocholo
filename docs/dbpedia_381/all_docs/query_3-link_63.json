        "text": "by Brian Hioe\n\nOn Saturday 13th Janurary, Taiwan will vote for the general elections. This year the independence-leaning pan-Green camp, headed by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its presidential candidate Lai Ching-te, will compete not only with its traditional rival, the China-friendly pan-Blue camp led by the Kuomintang (KMT) and its candidate Hou Yu-ih, but also with Ko Wen-je’s Taiwan People’s Party (TPP). However, the present election cycle is not, in fact, the first time that there has been a three-way split in the Taiwanese presidential election.\n\nIt may not be surprising, then, that some have drawn comparisons between the three-way race that put DPP president Chen Shui-bian in power in 2000. This, too, involved a split in the pan-Blue camp that resulted in a DPP victory, as many predicted as the likely outcome of the current race.\n\nIronically, the 2024 presidential election is the only race since 2000 that James Soong – one of the two candidates that split the pan-Blue vote in 2000 – did not run in. This marks Soong’s departure from the Taiwanese political stage after a career that spanned several decades.\n\nBut the 2024 presidential election could have very nearly been a four-way contest if Foxconn founder Terry Gou had remained in the race. Unlike TPP candidate Ko Wen-je, who has always positioned himself as independent of both major parties, Gou’s motivations in running can be compared to Soong, because the KMT did not pick him for the presidential nomination, deciding to run as an independent and securing a number of signatures for the petition drive he needed to qualify for running only second to the record previously set by Soong.\n\nThe political cohesiveness of the two traditional camps\n\nThis historical antecedent shows how certain dynamics have long existed in Taiwanese politics. A major part of the pan-Green camp’s likely success is on the basis of that, cognizant of the potential for a divided vote, the pan-Green camp united quickly behind Lai Ching-te. While it was originally thought that Taoyuan mayor Cheng Wen-tsan could potentially challenge Lai, or that President Tsai Ing-wen preferred her former vice president Chen Chien-jen to be the DPP’s candidate, such challenges ultimately did not materialize.\n\nAlthough there were questions raised in past presidential election cycles as to whether pan-Green third parties such as the New Power Party (NPP) could potentially challenge the DPP, there was no question of this taking place in the 2024 election cycle. The NPP itself fragmented and suffered major blows because of splits in the party in the lead-up to 2020 elections about whether to endorse Tsai or whether to compete with the DPP and so it was in no position to challenge the DPP this time, while the other major pan-Green third party, the Taiwan Statebuilding Party (TSP), has explicitly never sought to challenge the DPP for the presidency.\n\nBy contrast, the pan-Blue appears not to have learned from its past. That there were potentially a total of four candidates before Gou’s withdrawal and that negotiations between the TPP and KMT to unite proved tortuous before dramatically imploding is revealing of deep splits in the pan-Blue camp.\n\nThese splits can be traced back to the aftermath of the 2014 Sunflower Movement, which indicated that the pan-Blue camp had lost the support of a generation of Taiwanese young people: as of four years ago, the KMT had less than 9,000 members under 40, though it claims that recruitment is up 40% since then. But after the movement, the party faced the question of whether to reform, to change its pro-China image or to double down on party fundamentals. That debate has never been solved for the party and the internal split hampers effective political action by the pan-Blue to this date. As such, some of the pan-Blue camp’s struggles in past years can be traced to how a generation of young people – who identify as Taiwanese and not Chinese, as successive identity polls shows – has moved onto political identities that the KMT can no longer appeal to.\n\nThe rise of a third political force\n\nYet the rise of the TPP is noteworthy, particularly since the party appears to have significant appeal to young people. This occurs despite that party chair Ko Wen-je has expressed support for reviving the Cross-Strait Services Trade Agreement – the controversial FTA that the KMT hoped to sign with China in 2014 and which provoked the Sunflower Movement – and has repeatedly referred to Taiwan and China as “one family on both sides of the Taiwan Strait that share a common destiny.”\n\nAlthough Ko originally emerged in the wake of the 2014 Sunflower Movement as a largely pan-Green politician, if independent of the DPP, he has since pivoted to the pan-Blue camp. It is possible that some young people support him because they are unaware of the full extent of his shift in views. It is also thought that members of Gen Z, who have never experienced the KMT in power during the time that they have been old enough to be politically conscious, do not take the cross-strait threat as seriously and identify with Ko’s message that Taiwan needs not just the partisan politics of the two major parties, but also discussing of domestic issues regarding the economy. For members of Gen Z who may have only recently become eligible voters at age 20, watershed events such as the 2019 Hong Kong protests were a long time ago, much less the 2014 Sunflower Movement.\n\nBut more broadly, one suspects the rise of the TPP is because of the demand for new alternatives beyond just the DPP and KMT. It was this same impulse that led to the formation of the NPP and other “Third Force” parties after the Sunflower Movement unearthed widespread discontent towards the KMT, rather than voters simply siding with the opposition then led by the DPP. What surprised about the NPP is that they were able to appeal to swing voters, who were not necessarily just firm pan-Green voters. When the NPP was still viable as a party, it was firmly conscious that it shared much of its voter base with the TPP, and after its decline, now it is the TPP that attracts many of these voters.\n\nA political system that is expected to change\n\nIt may be, then, that the rise of the TPP signifies the changing tide in Taiwanese politics, in which many voters – especially young people – hope for alternatives to the DPP and KMT. Even if the DPP may remain in control of the presidency for another four years, if not eight years, this trend is likely here to stay. Consequently, whatever the outcome, one can expect efforts to push for a “Third Force” outside of the DPP and KMT to persist, perhaps taking advantage of splits in the DPP or KMT. This is to be seen but will play a powerful role in Taiwanese politics going forward, with questions afloat about how the DPP intends to remain in power beyond Lai.\n\nOn the other hand, most predictions to date in the election are that the DPP will fail to maintain its current majority in the Legislative Yuan. The KMT may not hold the absolute parliamentary majority either, but it could work with the TPP in coalition governance: that candidates of both parties have maintained outreach to each other suggests that both parties expect this to take place."
