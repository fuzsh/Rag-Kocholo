        "text": "Vice president of Taiwan since 2024\n\nIn this Taiwanese name, the surname is Hsiao.\n\nHsiao Bi-khim[note 1] (Chinese: 蕭美琴; pinyin: Xiāo Měiqín; Wade–Giles: Hsiao1 Mei3-ch'in2; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Siau Bí-khîm; born Bi-khim Louise Hsiao[1] on 7 August 1971) is a Taiwanese politician and diplomat. She is the incumbent vice president of the Republic of China (Taiwan) after winning the 2024 presidential election, and is Taiwan's first biracial vice president. She was the Taiwanese representative to the United States from 2020 to 2023, and formerly served as a legislator of the Legislative Yuan from 2002 to 2008 and again between 2012 and 2020.\n\nBorn in Kōbe, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, to a Taiwanese father and an American mother, Hsiao grew up in Tainan, Taiwan, before moving to the United States. She graduated from Oberlin College and Columbia University with a master's degree in political science. A member of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),[2] she is an important figure in the party's foreign policy circles.[3] She formerly served as a vice president of Liberal International.[4]\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nHsiao was born on 7 August 1971 in Kōbe, Japan. Her father Hsiao Ching-fen is Taiwanese while her mother Peggy Cooley is American. Hsiao's maternal family's presence in the United States dates back to the Mayflower (1620).[5]\n\nHsiao grew up in the city of Tainan in southern Taiwan. She spoke Mandarin, Taiwanese, and English, and she was raised in a Presbyterian family.[6][7][8] She moved to the United States as a teenager and graduated from Montclair High School in Montclair, New Jersey.[9] Hsiao graduated from Oberlin College in 1993 with a Bachelor of Arts in East Asian studies. She then did graduate study in political science at Columbia University and received a Master of Arts in 1995.[3][10][11]\n\nEntry into politics\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the United States, Hsiao became active with the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) representative office in the US, serving as an activity coordinator. On returning to Taiwan, Hsiao became the party's international affairs director, and represented the party at various international conferences for over a decade.[10]\n\nAfter Chen Shui-bian took office as the President of the Republic of China in 2000, Hsiao served as his interpreter and advisor for nearly two years.[10] Her dual US and Republic of China (Taiwan) citizenship while she was holding a government position became an issue, and she renounced her US citizenship in 2002, as required by the Civil Servants Employment Law passed in 2000.[12][1]\n\nLegislative career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2001, Hsiao announced her intention to run for the Legislative Yuan on the DPP ticket as a supplementary member representing overseas constituencies, citing her experience in international relations.[13] She was subsequently elected in December the same year.[10]\n\nIn the legislative elections of December 2004, Hsiao was reelected to the Legislative Yuan representing Taipei's first constituency, covering the northern districts of Xinyi, Songshan, Nangang, Neihu, Shilin, and Beitou. As a legislator, she served on the Foreign and Overseas Affairs Committee (外交及僑務委員會), the Procedure Committee (程序委員會), and the Discipline Committee (紀律委員會).[2]\n\nHsiao worked on a number of issues in the legislature, notably women's rights, the rights of foreigners in Taiwan, and other human rights. Hsiao supported amending the Nationality Law to allow individuals born to at least one parent of ROC nationality to also claim ROC nationality irrespective of age,[14] and has also proposed and cosponsored anti-discrimination and anti-domestic violence amendments to the Immigration Act.[15] She has also been a proponent of animal rights, proposing amendments to the Animal Protection Act,[16] and also pushed for the passage of the Sexual Harassment Prevention Act in January 2005.[17]\n\nIn May 2005, Hsiao represented the DPP at the annual congress of Liberal International in Sofia, Bulgaria, during which she was elected a vice-president of the organization. Hsiao alleged that she and other DPP representatives were followed throughout their visit to Bulgaria by two unidentified persons sent by the People's Republic of China embassy in Sofia.[18]\n\nThe same month, Hsiao also started a campaign to encourage Taiwanese baseball fans to write e-mails to the New York Yankees to ask them to keep Taiwanese pitcher Chien-Ming Wang at the major league level.[19]\n\nHsiao was one of the DPP lawmakers targeted by some party supporters as being insufficiently loyal, with a pro-independence radio show dubbing her \"Chinese Khim\" (中國琴) in March 2007, charging that she was close to the DPP's former New Tide faction.[20] Defended by some other DPP members, Hsiao was still not nominated to stand for re-election by the DPP in the January 2008 legislative elections,[21] a move some attributed to being the result of that controversy.[22]\n\nHsiao left the Legislative Yuan after her term expired on 31 January 2008. She served as spokesperson for Frank Hsieh's unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign.[23] She is also vice chairman of the Taiwan Tibet Exchange Foundation,[24] a member of the board of trustees of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy,[25] a member of the executive committee of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats,[26] and a founding member of the Taiwan Association for Women in Sport (台灣女子體育運動協會).[27]\n\nFrom 2010, Hsiao spent a decade representing the DPP in Hualien County, a strongly pro-Kuomintang conservative region. In the same year, she lost with a slim minority in a by-election, but was still regarded as having broken the \"iron vote\" of the Kuomintang.[28] She then set up a Hualien service office, and continued making weekly journeys between Taipei and Hualien.[28]\n\nHsiao returned to the Legislative Yuan in February 2012, elected via party list proportional representation. In 2016, Hsiao succeeded Wang Ting-son as legislator for Hualien County. In 2018, an unsuccessful recall campaign was organized against Hsiao because of her strong support for same-sex marriage legalization. Hsiao did not yield to pressure, and continued to speak out for Hualien Pride.[28] In August 2019, she received the Democratic Progressive Party nomination to run for another term in Hualien County.[29] She lost her seat to Fu Kun-chi in the 2020 legislative elections.[30]\n\nDiplomatic career\n\n[edit]\n\nHsiao stepped down from the Legislative Yuan upon the end of her term in 2020, and was subsequently named an adviser to the National Security Council in March 2020. That June, Hsiao was appointed Taiwan's representative to the United States. She succeeded Stanley Kao, and was the first woman to assume the role.[31][32] Hsiao was sworn in to the office on 20 July 2020.[33]\n\nOn 20 January 2021, Hsiao was officially invited to and attended the inauguration of US President Joe Biden, the first time Taiwan's US representative had officially attended a US presidential inauguration since the US broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979. Standing in front of the US Capitol at the inauguration, she said \"Democracy is our common language and freedom is our common objective.\"[34]\n\nOn Taiwan National Day 2021, Hsiao threw the ceremonial first pitch before a New York Mets game, celebrating the 16th annual Mets Taiwan Day.[35]\n\nVice presidency\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 2024 Taiwanese presidential election\n\nOn 20 November 2023, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Lai Ching-te officially named Hsiao his vice presidential candidate for the 2024 presidential election.[36]\n\nOn 13 January 2024, Lai and Hsiao were elected president and vice president in the DPP’s third consecutive presidential race victory.\n\nOn March 2024, she made a personal visit to the United States, her first foreign travel since being elected as the vice president. In response to her visit, the spokesperson of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the United States Liu Pengyu said that \"Beijing firmly opposed any visit by Hsiao to the US in any name or under whatever pretext\" and called Hsiao a “diehard ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist”, and that there should be no form of contact between US government officials and Hsiao. Later on the same month, Hsiao visited Czech Republic where she was invited to speak at the Czech think tank Sinopsis. In response to her visit to the Czech Republic, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated that the Czech government should \"severely restrain certain (Czech) politicians\" and \"take effective measures to remove the negative influence of this incident.\"[37][38]\n\nDuring her visit to the Czech Republic, a car belonging to a diplomat from the military section of the PRC embassy in Prague was stopped by authorities after running a red light while apparently tailing Hsiao's convoy.[39] Czech authorities launched an investigation in response to the incident.[40]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHer father, Hsiao Ching-fen, was a former president of the Tainan Theological College and Seminary.\n\nIn November 2000, The Journalist, a local tabloid magazine, wrongly claimed to have been told by Vice President Annette Lu that Hsiao was having an affair with President Chen. No evidence supported the false claim,[41] and Lu sued the magazine for libel in civil court. The magazine was eventually ordered to apologize and issue corrections admitting it had fabricated the story.[42]\n\nDuring her political career, Hsiao and fellow legislators Cheng Li-chun and Chiu Yi-ying gained the nickname \"the S.H.E of the DPP.\"[43] Hsiao has been a long-time supporter of gender equality and LGBT rights in Taiwan.[44][45]\n\nHsiao is a cat lover, saying in July 2020 that she planned to take her four cats with her when she moved to the US as Taiwan's top representative to the country.[46] As Taiwan's envoy, she said that she would combat China's allegedly aggressive \"wolf warrior\" (戰狼) diplomacy with her own brand of \"cat warrior\" (戰貓) diplomacy.[47][48]\n\nSanctions\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 17 August 2022, in the aftermath of then Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan on 2–3 August, China blacklisted seven Taiwanese officials including Hsiao due to their alleged support for Taiwanese independence. The blacklist bans them from entering mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, and restricts them from working with Chinese officials. Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times labelled Hsiao and the six officials as \"diehard secessionists\".[49]\n\nIn April 2023, Hsiao was sanctioned by China for the second time in aftermath of the meeting between President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen and then Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy in the United States. The second set of sanctions also include preventing investors and firms related to the sanctioned individuals from cooperating with mainland China organisations and individuals.[50]\n\nHonors\n\n[edit]\n\n2024 Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon[51]\n\nNotes and references\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial Website of Bi-Khim Hsiao (Archived)"
