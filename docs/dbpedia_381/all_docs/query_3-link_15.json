        "meta_description": "This article considers definitions of semi-presidential systems, distinguishing prescriptive criteria (constitutional regime) and descriptive criteria (political system). Applying prescriptive criteria to the Taiwanese situation, it concludes that the Taiwanese Constitution prescribes a semi-presidential regime. The article then analyses the descriptive features of Taiwan’s political system. The conclusions are enhanced by a close analysis of the situation in the aftermath of Taiwan’s 2004 parliamentary elections and also from the events in the spring of 2006 (the delegation of constitutional powers and recall motion). Taiwan’s political system exhibits both very strong majoritarian and delegative tendencies, the main reasons for the lack of functionality under the present constitutional regime. That the political system is resistant to change means, for this article, that the only possibility for democratic government functionality for Taiwan is a change of constitutional regime to one that is parliamentary.",

        "text": "Presidential and parliamentary systems\n\nConstitutional regimes and political systems\n\n7The Constitution can only have “potential” relational properties, which are actually implemented (in various different ways and to different degrees) into the political system. In his discussion of relational properties, Elgie, as other authors, mix the potential relational properties and their actual realisation. They mix the power positions of players prescribed by the Constitution and the actual power positions in the system.\n\n11We divide the definition of the Taiwanese system of government into the definition of its constitutional regime and into the characterisation of its political system. Only the constitutional regime can be defined and therefore the trichotomic classification of regimes is applicable only to the first part of the definition. The political system can be merely described or characterised, and therefore only the tendencies towards presidentialisation of a respective non-presidential constitutional regime (parliamentary, semi-presidential) can be observed.\n\nTaiwanese constitutional regime\n\n12The President is directly (popularly) elected according to the Article 2, paragraph 1 of Additional articles to the Constitution of the Republic of China (AA). He is, according to Article 2, paragraph 6 of AA, elected for a fixed term of four years. Article 3, paragraph 1 of AA creates the Prime Minister (president of Executive Yuan) and cabinet (Executive Yuan). Both are responsible to Parliament (Legislative Yuan) according to Article 3, paragraph 2. The Legislative Yuan has the specific right to vote on a call of no confidence, which would remove the Prime Minister and cabinet. All the dispositional properties of the definition of semi-presidential constitutional regime are therefore met.\n\nMajoritarian government on Taiwan\n\n16Until 2000 the system was clearly dominated by executive power. It was a logical outgrowth of the situation where the presidency and the ruling party chairmanship were dominated by one person (as in the case of the Chiangs and Lee Teng-hui). The situation was changed by the 2000 presidential elections and Parliament has acquired a more important role. The executive branch has retained the agenda-setting power, but Parliament has begun to learn how to be a veto player (especially after Ma Ying-jeou’s accession to the KMT party chairmanship).\n\n21The Taiwanese political system can be characterised by strong majoritarian tendencies, which reflect Taiwan’s authoritarian past, and these were sustained after the beginning of democratisation due to the prevailing presidential government during Lee’s era, even while already having established a semi-presidential constitutional regime. The type of democratisation on Taiwan―the ruling elite engineered type, which retained the elite in power long after successful regime transition―has therefore retained part of the previous authoritarian regime’s political culture―the majoritarian behaviour. These tendencies were only mildly moderated after the 2000 presidential elections by Taiwan’s constitutional regime and voting system.\n\nDelegative democracy on Taiwan\n\n22Delegative democracy influences the functioning of the government, and especially the move towards personalised (presidentialised) government, while having a semi-presidential constitutional regime can be viewed as less behaving the way prescribed by the Constitution and so less representing the election results.\n\n26Revising the DPP party charter and making the incumbent President automatically the chairman of the DPP has also strengthened the position of the President in the political process. However this characteristic has changed since the 2004 parliamentary elections. President Chen stepped down from his position of party chairman, and the DPP party situation now appears to be reverting more to the consensual politics of three key players (President, Prime Minister, party chairman) and is becoming more representative.\n\n29Taiwan exhibits a clear drift toward the situation where the real decision-making power in the system is “delegated” to the President. It is also conforming to Poguntke’s definition of presidentialisation of governments.\n\nAftermath of the 2004 parliamentary elections\n\nPresident Chen's New Year's Day Address\n\n31The choice of the people [in the 2004 elections] sent a clear message: The governing party must rule with humility while the opposition parties are rational in providing oversight. Taiwan's society does not need bifurcation between the blue and green camps, nor does it need ongoing confrontation between the governing and opposition parties. The governing and opposition parties each have their own roles to play. Fair competition, co-operation rather than confrontation, checks and balances, and solidarity rather than infighting―these are now the ardent expectations of the people of Taiwan. I myself identify very strongly with the voice of the people, and fully grasp where my duties and responsibilities as President lie...I would like to hereby advocate openly that Taiwan must head towards a new era of consultation and dialogue.\n\nTaiwan President Names New Premier\n\nPremier Hopes for Political Reconciliation in 2005\n\nThe New Chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party\n\n10-point agreement signed\n\n36Marking a milestone in inter-party co-operation, President Chen Shui-bian and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong held a historic meeting yesterday where they reached a consensus to acknowledge and respect the current definition of Taiwan's status, create a legal basis for cross-Strait peace, and reiterated their support for the Republic of China.\n\n37After the meeting at the Taipei Guest House yesterday morning, Chen and Soong signed a joint 10-point agreement on cross-Strait relations, national defence and ethnic reconciliation. The consensus was hailed as the beginning of dialogue and discussion between the governing and opposition camps...\n\nThe parliamentary gridlock, “constitutional” transfer of powers and the recall motion\n\n39The situation in the spring of 2006 became quite the reverse of the DPP’s proclaimed attempts for consolidating government. After losing in the 2005 local elections the DPP was pushed back onto the defensive and as a result the prime ministerial post changed yet again. Frank Hsieh was replaced by Su Tseng-chang. The DPP tried to gain ground by abolishing the National Unification Council and National Unification Guidelines in February 2006, angering the pan blue camp, being a move that could be viewed as aimed towards an independent Taiwan. The situation in Parliament became tense, and after a series of corruption scandals that pointed to the top-most echelons of the DPP, also implicating the President’s son-in-law and the President’s wife, the PFP and the KMT began to consider the recall of the president. Amidst the recall discussions Chen publicly handed some constitutional powers to the Premier.\n\n40The state of gridlock in the Legislature can best be described by citing from the article published in Taipei Times on June 1st 2006, page 8: “Unsurprisingly [emphasis added], the Legislative Yuan ended its spring session in chaos, failing to pass a number of critical bills that seriously affect the livelihoods of ordinary people and the national interest. Amendments to the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area failed for a third time after physical confrontation between the governing and opposition parties. The pan-greens stopped the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) from putting the amendment to a vote on the legislative floor. The pan-blues, in return, blocked all of the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) proposals, and the legislature went into its summer recess on Tuesday amid pandemonium”.\n\n42President Chen resolved on 31st of May 2006 that from now on all Cabinet-related matters would be in the hands of the premier. The President also said that he would respect Su's nominations for Cabinet personnel. Chen said that although as a member of the DPP he had an obligation to make a contribution to the party, he would no longer participate in DPP internal affairs, nor campaign on behalf of party members running for public office.\n\n46The events of spring 2006 clearly show the delegative feature of Taiwan’s political system. The President feels he can make decisions about constitutional powers himself. His handing-down of presidential powers to the Prime Minister can be seen as a strong example of a President ignoring the Constitution. Either he exercised extra-constitutional powers before his move and, as is being claimed by DPP, he has now restored constitutional behaviour; or he moved his constitutional powers to the Prime Minister and is therefore behaving unconstitutionally now. Because if the President feels that he has lost the ability to exercise the powers prescribed to him by the Constitution he has the only constitutional solution―resign from office and let the vice-president do his job. That is, as a matter of fact, the reason for the existence of the vice-president’s office—that he/she can step into the place of an inept President without having to go through new elections.\n\n47The majoritarian features in Taiwanese politics are being enhanced. Legislative gridlock is deepened by the inability to pass any relevant bills. The transfer of powers to the Prime Minister was aimed at strengthening executive power amid the bribery scandal touching the President and the recall motion has also strengthened the bipartisan features of Taiwan’s political system, because the pan-blue and pan-green camps were set against each other during the campaign surrounding the motion process.\n\n50Taiwan is exhibiting only few minor signs of moving towards a more consensual or more representative government, even though such a movement would be its only possibility under the present constitutional regime for achieving democratic government functionality. The political system is unused to compromise and consensus, and views any yielding of ideals towards the pursuit of a common goal as a betrayal or weakness. The consensual approach as seen in the aftermath of the 2004 parliamentary elections will probably remain only a rhetorical figure of the past and another weapon in the majoritarian political game."
