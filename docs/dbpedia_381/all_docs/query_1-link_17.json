        "text": "2008-05-20 to\n\n2016-05-20\n\nAfter four months since taking office in 2008, encounters the global financial tsunami, and responds by lowering interest rates seven times, declaring a blanket guarantee for all bank deposits, investing NT$500 billion for five years to spur domestic demand, and issuing a consumption voucher worth NT$3,600 to every member of the population. Because of these measures, Taiwan is able to weather the global financial meltdown. Taiwan's economic growth rate in 2010 reaches 10.63%, hitting a record high in 23 years, and is ranked 7th in the world. Taiwan is ranked 6th, the best ranking Taiwan has ever earned, in the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2011 compiled by Switzerland's International Institute for Management Development. After being hit by the eurozone debt crisis and declines in global export for three consecutive years, the economic growth rate in 2014 still stands at 3.92%, the highest growth rate of the Asia's four little tigers for the first time in 16 years. In 2016, the International Monetary Fund releases the rankings of annual per capita GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP), in which Taiwan's average per capita GDP of US$46,783 is ranked 21st worldwide, up 11 slots in eight years. That puts Taiwan ahead of the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Denmark, Japan and Korea.\n\n2008-05-20 to\n\n2016-05-20\n\nThe number of cabinet-level ministries and commissions is reduced from 37 to 29. Twenty five cities and counties are merged and upgraded to six special municipalities and 16 cities and counties. In addition, implements a volunteer military service system, a partial (50%) credit imputation tax, the consolidated housing and land tax system, 12-year public education, and integration of kindergartens and nursery schools. Pushes forward with national pension, labor pension systems, and the second-generation National Health Insurance. The number of people eligible for social assistance has been expanded from 260,000 to 700,000. Cracks down on production of tainted foods, determines oil and electricity prices by market forces, and develops photovoltaics and wind power energy to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions. The Wu-Yang Viaduct freeway section and electrification as well as double tracking of the more congested sections of Taiwan Railways' Hualien-Taitung Line have been completed earlier than scheduled.\n\nIn the development of tourism, overseas tourists make over 10 million visits to Taiwan in 2015, an increase of nearly three-fold. Actively launches more efficient usage of agricultural land and Rural Rejuvenation to achieve the goal of a 50% reduction in currently fallow lands and increase the incomes of farmers. In addition, reforms the monthly subsidy to elderly farmers in an effort to prevent imposter scams and save large amounts of funds.\n\n2008-05-20 to\n\n2016-05-20\n\nTaiwan signs the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with mainland China in 2010 and the Taiwan-Japan Bilateral Investment Arrangement (BIA) with Japan in 2011. And in 2013 Taiwan and New Zealand sign the Agreement between New Zealand and the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu on Economic Cooperation (ANZTEC). At the same year, Taiwan and Singapore sign the Agreement between Singapore and the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu on Economic Partnership (ASTEP).\n\nIn cross-strait relations, consistently seeks, under the framework of the ROC Constitution, to maintain the status quo, defined as \"no unification, no independence, and no use of force\" in the Taiwan Strait, and acts on the basis of the 1992 Consensus—whereby each side acknowledges the existence of \"one China\" but maintains its own interpretation of what that means—to seek peaceful cross-strait relations. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have signed 23 agreements to date. In February 2014, the ministers in charge of cross-strait affairs from both sides meet for the first time and refer to each other by their official titles. On November 7, 2015, meets mainland Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) in Singapore under the principles of \"dignity and equality\". The meeting marks the first time that the cross-strait leaders have met since Taiwan and mainland China came under separate rule 66 years ago, and cements a strong foundation for sustainable cross-strait peace."
