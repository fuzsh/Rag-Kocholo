        "text": "On August 5th, Consul General Tang Zhongdong published signed article on Star and Business Day under the title The US Fire-playing Provocation Over the Taiwan Question Will Eventually Lead to Self-burning.\n\nThe full text is as follows:\n\nOn August 2, 2022, Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, visited Chinaâs Taiwan region and met with the so-called âleaderâ of Taiwan region, despite Chinaâs firm opposition and strong condemnation at all levels. It is a serious violation of the one-China principle and the provisions in the three Sino-US joint communiquÃ©s. It dealt a heavy blow to the political foundation of China-US relations, seriously infringed on Chinaâs sovereignty and territorial integrity, and significantly undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.\n\nI.The US breach of its commitment cannot shake the solemn position of the Chinese Government and people on the one-China principle\n\nThere is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and the Government of the Peopleâs Republic of China is the sore legal government representing the whole of China. This is the core of the one-China principle, which has become the consensus of the international community and a basic norms in international relations. In October 1971, the 26th session of the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758, which decided to ârestore all its rights of the Peopleâs Republic of China and recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nationsâ. To date, 181 countries around the world, including the US, have established diplomatic relations with China on the basis of the one-China principle.\n\nThe one-China principle is the centerpiece of the three Sino-US joint communiquÃ©s and the premise and foundation for the establishment and development of China-US diplomatic relations. In 1979, the United States made a clear commitment in the Sino-US CommuniquÃ© on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations that âthe United States of America recognizes the Government of the Peopleâs Republic of China as the sole legal government of Chinaâ and âwithin this context, the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwanâ. The US Congress, as part of the US Government, is obliged to follow the one-China policy of the US Government and shall not engage in any official interactions with Chinaâs Taiwan region. Pelosi is the incumbent Speaker of the US House of Representatives and ranks second in the US presidential line of succession. Her visit to Taiwan, in whatever form, under whatever pretext and at whatever time during her tenure, would cause a serious violation of the US Governmentâs commitment to the one-China policy, mark a major political provocation upgrading official interactions and substantive relations between the US and Taiwan, and signal connivance and support for the âTaiwan independenceâ separatist forces.\n\nOn July 28, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke with US President Joe Biden on the phone at the request of the latter. Xi highlighted that the historical ins and outs of the Taiwan question are crystal clear, and so are the fact and status quo that both sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to one and the same China. The three Sino-US joint communiquÃ©s embody the political commitments made by the two sides, and the one-China principle is the political foundation for China-US relations. China firmly opposes separatist moves toward âTaiwan independenceâ and interference by any external force, and it never allows any room for âTaiwan independenceâ forces in whatever form.\n\nII.The US political manipulation cannot change the steadfast determination of all the Chinese to realize the complete reunification of the motherland.\n\nThe Taiwan question concerns Chinaâs sovereignty and territorial integrity, and thus there is no room for compromise and concession. The Anti-Secession Law issued by China makes clear provisions on such major issues as upholding the one-China principle, curbing âTaiwan independenceâ secession, and opposing external interference in the Taiwan question. The position of the Chinese Government and people on the Taiwan question has been consistent. To resolutely safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country represents the unbending will of the over 1.4 billion Chinese people. To realize the complete reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration and sacred obligation of all Chinese sons and daughters. Any attempt to obstruct Chinaâs complete reunification and great rejuvenation is doomed to failure.\n\nThe Taiwan question is the most important, most central and most sensitive matter in China-US relations. At present, the situation across the Taiwan Straits is becoming increasingly tense, complicated and serious, with the main reason that the Taiwan authorities are constantly changing the status quo under the instigation and support of the US. The Taiwan authorities have kept seeking US support for their independence agenda, refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus that embodies the one-China principle, and promoted âde-sinicizationâ in an attempt to realize âincremental independenceâ. The US side, in an effort to use Taiwan to contain China, has continues to distort, obscure and hollow out the one-China principle, stepped up official interactions with Taiwan, supported Taiwan in developing âasymmetric capabilitiesâ, and spread the idea that âthe status of Taiwan is undeterminedâ, thus emboldening âTaiwan independenceâ separatist activities.\n\nNo matter how politically manipulated by the US, the Taiwan question is purely Chinaâs internal affair. No other country, including the US, has the right to act as a judge on the Taiwan question. We will continue to urge the US to stop playing the âTaiwan cardâ against China, stop meddling in Taiwan affairs and Chinaâs internal affairs, stop supporting and conniving at âTaiwan independenceâ separatist forces in any form, stop distorting, obscuring and hollowing out the one-China principle. The US side must honor the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiquÃ©s with concrete actions in line with the âfive noesâ commitment made by the US leader (not seek a ânew Cold Warâ; not seek to change Chinaâs system; not seek to strengthen its alliance against China; not support âTaiwan independenceâ; and not look for conflict with China).\n\nIII.China will resolutely take necessary countermeasures against the US provocative acts and âTaiwan independenceâ separatist activities\n\nDespite Chinaâs repeated clarification on the serious consequences of her visit to Taiwan, Pelosi made a deliberate and malicious provocation to create a crisis, seriously violating the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiquÃ©s and undermining the political foundation of China-US relations. The move by the US sent a seriously wrong signal to the âTaiwan independenceâ separatist forces and further escalated the tension across the Taiwan Straits. Supported by foreign forces, the Taiwan authorities insisted on inviting Pelosi to visit Taiwan, which was very dangerous and bound to cause serious consequences. The Chinese Peopleâs Liberation Army is on high alert and will certainly respond with a series of targeted military actions to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and thwart external interference and separatist attempts for âTaiwan independenceâ.\n\nIn response to the recent fallacies made by the US side, it is necessary to clarify some truths.\n\nFirst, the US side claims that China should exercise restraint and not overreact to avoid the escalation of the tension across the Taiwan Straits. However, it is the US side that insists on having Pelosi visit Taiwan, keeps challenging Chinaâs red line, undermines Chinaâs sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, and causes continuous escalation of tension. China has every right to take countermeasures to defend its sovereignty and territorialâintegrity. The current situation is caused purely by the US side, so of course it has to bear the responsibility. The US pressuring China to exercise restraint is a flagrant act of hegemony, bullying and coercion.\n\nSecond, the US side claims that the Speakerâs visit to Taiwan has a precedent and does not represent a change in US policy towards Taiwan. However, former US Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrichâs visit to Taiwan in 1997 was totally wrong. The Chinese side firmly opposed it from the very beginning. The US should draw lessons from it instead of making repeated mistakes while knowing it was wrong. For a period of time, the US has been using Taiwan to contain China, distorting the one-China principle and emboldening âTaiwan independenceâ separatist activities, which exactly mean changes in its policy on Taiwan.\n\nThird, the US side claims that in the system of three powers, the executive branch (the White House) cannot interfere with the legislative branch (the Congress). However, the executive, the legislative and judicial branches are all parts of the US Government and must implement the one-China policy committed by the US Government. As Speaker of the House of Representatives, Pelosi of course represents the US government in everything she says and does. The executive branch of the US Government has the responsibility to dissuade her from visiting Taiwan.\n\nFourth, the US side claims that it opposes the non-peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question. However, Taiwan is Chinaâs Taiwan and no other country is entitled to act like a judge on the Taiwan question. China strives for the prospect of peaceful reunification with greatest sincerity and utmost efforts, but will not renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary measures.\n\nIV. China highly appreciates South Africaâs and ANCâs long-standing commitment to the one-China principle\n\nFor a long time, China and South Africa have enjoyed a special friendly relationship of âcomrades plus brothersâ. Under the guidance of the leaders of both countries, China and South Africa continue to deepen political mutual trust and promote practical cooperation. The China-South Africa Comprehensive Strategic Partnership has become a good example of solidarity, cooperation and mutual benefit. China highly appreciates South Africaâs long-standing commitment to the one-China principle and its firm support to Chinaâs position on the Taiwan question. On 18 March, President Ramaphosa said in a phone conversation with President Xi Jinping that South Africa firmly adheres to the one-China policy and steadfastly supports Chinaâs stance on the issue related to Tibet and other major issues. On July 30, Lindiwe Zulu, Chairperson of the ANCâs International Relations Committee and South Africaâs Minister of Social Development, reiterated the ANCâs firm commitment to the one-China policy at a media briefing of the ANCâs National Policy Conference.\n\nWe believe that South Africa will continue to honor the one-China principle, firmly support China on the Taiwan question and other issues concerning Chinaâs core interests, and admire Chinaâs efforts to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity."
