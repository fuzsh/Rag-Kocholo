Beginning in the early 1990s, this role has gradually changed, and the NPC has begun to exercise more control over the legislative and policy agenda in accordance with its constitutional mandate. This change follows leadership efforts to define more clearly the scope of the NPC's legislative powers, to unify the legislative system to prevent conflicts of laws, and to improve the overall quality of legislation.\n\nThe major functions of the NPC are to:\n\namend the state constitution and enact laws;\n\nsupervise the enforcement of the state constitution and the law;\n\nelect the president and the vice president of the republic;\n\ndecide on the choice of premier of the State Council upon nomination by the president;\n\nelect the major officials of government;\n\nelect the chairman and other members of the state Central Military Commission;\n\nelect the president of the Supreme People's Court and the procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate;\n\nexamine and approve the national economic plan, the state budget, and the final state accounts;\n\ndecide on questions of war and peace; and\n\napprove the establishment of special administrative regions and the \"systems to be instituted there.\"\n\nThe 3,000 members of the NPC meet once a year and serve 5-year terms. Delegates are elected by the people's congresses at the provincial level as well as by the People's Liberation Army. Provincial delegations meet before each NPC session to discuss agenda items. Because of the infrequent meetings, the NPC functions through a permanent body, the Standing Committee, whose members it elects. The Standing Committee's powers were enhanced in 1987 when it was given the ability to \"enact and amend laws with the exception of those which should be enacted by the NPC,\" thus giving this body legislative powers. The Standing Committee presides over sessions of the NPC and determines the agenda, the routing of legislation, and nominations for offices. The NPC also has six permanent committees: one each for minorities, law, finance, foreign affairs, and overseas Chinese and one for education, science, culture, and health. Leaders of the NPC Standing Committee are invariably influential members of the CCP and leaders of major mass organizations. The Standing Committee has within it a smaller group that is led by the chairman of the Standing Committee.\n\nTo read about the legislative transparency of the NPC, click here.\n\nThe State Central Military Commission\n\n中华人民共和国中央军事委员会\n\nThe 1982 State Constitution established the state Central Military Commission as the key governmental body charged with \"directing the armed forces.\" While the party Central Military Commission provided the political direction for military policy-making, the state Central Military Commission oversaw key military personnel appointments, managed PLA financial and material resources, developed regulations, and implemented statutes to provide a more rational and professional organizational basis for the PLA. The chairman of the state Central Military Commission--in a departure from earlier practices that put either the state president or the party chairman in command--was designated as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.\n\nThe Standing Committee of the NPC\n\n全国人大常委会\n\nWhen the NPC is not in session, its Standing Committee assumes legislative responsibilities until the next time the entire Congress convenes. The Standing Committee consists of delegates elected from the NPC and has a similar structure and virtually identical procedures to the NPC. The Standing Committee has more limits on the types of laws it can draft than the NPC as a whole, but because the Standing Committee controls the legislative agenda for a longer period each year, it has produced a larger body of law. The Standing Committee is responsible, among other things, for:\n\nconducting the election of NPC delegates;\n\ninterpreting the State Constitution and laws;\n\nsupervising the work of the executive, the state Central Military Commission, and judicial organs;\n\ndeciding on the appointment and removal of State Council members on the recommendation of the premier;\n\napproving and removing senior judicial and diplomatic officials;\n\nruling on the ratification and abrogation of treaties; and\n\ndeciding on the proclamation of a state of war when the NPC is not in session.\n\nLike the NPC as a whole, the Standing Committee has made efforts to improve the quality of the legislation it promulgates. In 2003, the Standing Committee expanded from 155 to 175 members. The 20 new members serve as full-time delegates (as opposed to many older Standing Committee members who serve only on a part-time basis) and have professional backgrounds in subjects such as law and economics. The Standing Committee also has its own specialized bureaucracy to assist in drafting and supervising legislation.\n\nThe Supreme People's Court\n\n最高人民法院\n\nThe State Constitution of 1982 and the Organic Law of the People's Courts that went into effect on January 1, 1980, provide for a four-level court system. At the highest level is the Supreme People's Court, the premier appellate forum of the land, which supervises the administration of justice by all subordinate \"local\" and \"special\" people's courts. Local people's courts--the courts of the first instance--handle criminal and civil cases. These people's courts make up the remaining three levels of the court system and consist of \"higher people's courts\" at the level of the provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities; \"intermediate people's courts\" at the level of prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and municipalities; and \"basic people's courts\" at the level of autonomous counties, towns, and municipal districts.\n\nIn China, courts have limited power and authority. The NPC and its Standing Committee have the ultimate authority to interpret law and to enforce the Constitution. As China is a civil law jurisdiction, courts have no formal power to make law in the sense that judicial decisions are not binding precedent. Similarly, courts are not empowered to interpret administrative regulations--ultimate authority over the interpretation and application of such rules rest with the issuing agency. Even with this limited authority, Chinese courts are subject to detailed supervision by the people's congresses and the procuratorate. Court officials typically are outranked by public security and other law enforcement officials in the Party hierarchy, limiting their influence over Communist Party policy related to legal work.\n\nOne consequence of the limited power of Chinese courts is that many court judgments are not enforced. As a July 2003 report by China's official Xinhua News Agency notes, most court enforcement orders remain unresolved, \"leaving a blemish on the reputation of the judiciary.\" The problem is serious enough that judicial leaders have made improving the enforcement of judgments a key reform goal. In the criminal context, the weak position of the courts in relation to public security and prosecutors makes it difficult for the courts to check abuses by these institutions or to resist interference from law enforcement chiefs in sensitive cases.\n\nTo read more about judicial independence in China, click here.\n\nThe Supreme People's Procuratorate\n\n最高人民检察院\n\nThe 1982 State Constitution refers to the procuratorates as the state organs for \"legal supervision.\" However, the procuratorates exercise both prosecutorial and watchdog functions. In their prosecutorial roles procuratorates review cases investigated by public security officials, decide whether to approve arrests and prosecute criminal suspects, and carry out public prosecutions on behalf of the government. As the watchdogs of China's bureaucracy and legal system, however, procuratorates are also responsible for investigating cases involving official graft, corruption, and dereliction of duty; supervising criminal investigations, trials, and the execution sentences; and investigating citizen complaints against state personnel. These supervisory powers include the right to appeal verdicts if a procuratorate determines that a criminal or civil court has made errors.\n\nThe State Council\n\n国务院\n\nGeneral Office of the State Council (国务院办公厅)\n\nChinese People's Political Consultative Conference ( 中国人民政协全国委员会)\n\nThe State Council executes laws and supervises the government bureaucracy and thus carries out the administrative functions of the Chinese government. The Premier heads the Council and is assisted by the Vice-Premiers and the ministers and chairmen of the commissions. Subordinate to the State Council are ministries, commissions, and direct offices, which constitute the State Council's principal policymaking and supervisory offices.\n\nThe Chinese Constitution directs the State Council to assure that laws passed by the NPC are promptly and properly executed. Thus, it serves a primarily administrative function. The Constitution gives the State Council specific power \"to adopt administrative measures, enact administrative rules and regulations, and issue decisions and orders in accordance with the Constitution and statutes.\" Before the Legislation Law was enacted in 2000, a tradition of vaguely drafted laws and deference to the State Council left it with a wide mandate to regulate. The Legislation Law defined the subjects that must be addressed in the form of \"laws\" and thus are exclusively within the competence of the NPC. Together with a trend toward more precise drafting within the NPC, the Legislation Law now provides more concrete guidance on the State Council's rulemaking powers.\n\nThe State Council maintains a large staff that enacts detailed regulations and instructions on how to execute the laws. Since the early 1980s, this staff has reflected an overall trend in Chinese government institutions toward greater professional competence and specialization. Improving the quality of its regulations and avoiding conflicts between law and administrative and local regulations on important issues have been high priorities.\n\nThrough organizational changes, the State Council has sought to improve efficiency, combat corruption, and advance market-oriented economic reforms. In its March 2003 reform plan, the NPC made several important changes to the State Council that reflect China's interest in developing a \"market economy with socialist characteristics.\" The merger of a number of government bodies that administer China's domestic and foreign trade regimes into a new Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) may prove to be the most significant of these changes. MOFCOM may simplify access to China's economy for foreign businesses and investors through greater centralization and coordination of regulatory activities. In other potentially important changes, the NPC created a new commission to supervise state-owned enterprises, with a mandate to supervise state capital, but not to participate in the management of the specific enterprises. The NPC also created a new commission to supervise the People's Bank of China, apparently to coordinate efforts to shore up the shaky state-owned banking sector--a risky and complex task.\n\nOrgans Composing the State Council\n\n国务院组成部门\n\nMinistries\n\nCommissions\n\nAgriculture\n\n农业部\n\nCivil Affairs\n\n民政部\n\nCommerce\n\n商务部\n\nCommunications\n\n交通部\n\nConstruction\n\n建设部\n\nCulture\n\n文化部\n\nEducation\n\n教育部\n\nFinance\n\n财政部\n\nForeign Affairs\n\n外交部\n\nHealth\n\n卫生部\n\nInformation Industry\n\n信息产业部\n\nJustice\n\n司法部\n\nLabor and Social Security\n\n劳动和社会保障部\n\nLand and Resources\n\n国土资源部\n\nNational Defense\n\n国防部\n\nPersonnel\n\n人事部\n\nPublic Security\n\n公安部\n\nRailways\n\n铁道部\n\nScience and Technology\n\n科技部\n\nState Security\n\n安全部\n\nSupervision\n\n监察部\n\nWater Resources\n\n水利部\n\nNational Development and Reform Commission\n\n国家发展和改革委员会\n\nCommission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense\n\n国防科学技术工业委员会\n\nState Ethnic Affairs Commission\n\n民族事务委员会\n\nState Population and Family Planning Commission\n\n中国人口与计划生育委员会\n\nState Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission\n\n国务院国有资产监督管理委员会\n\nOther\n\nPeople's Bank of China\n\n中国人民银行\n\nNational Audit Office\n\n国家审计署\n\nOrgans Directly Under the State Council国务院直属机构\n\nInstitutions Directly Under the State Council国务院直属事业单位\n\nWorking Organs of the State Council国务院办事机构\n\nGeneral Administration of Customs\n\n中国海关总署\n\nState Administration of Taxation\n\n国家税务总局\n\nState Administration for Industry and Commerce\n\n国家工商行政管理总局\n\nState Environmental Protection Administration\n\n国家环境保护总局\n\nGeneral Administration of the Civil Aviation of China\n\n中国民航总局\n\nState Administration of Radio, Film and Television\n\n国家广播电影电视总局\n\nState General Administration of Sport\n\n国家体育总局\n\nNational Bureau of Statistics\n\n国家统计局\n\nState Forestry Administration\n\n国家林业局\n\nState Drug Administration\n\n国家药品监督管理局\n\nState Intellectual Property Office\n\n国家知识产权局\n\nNational Tourism Administration\n\n国家旅游局\n\nState Administration of Religious Affairs\n\n国家宗教事务局\n\nCounselors' Office of the State Council\n\n国务院参事室\n\nGovernment Offices Administration of the State Council\n\n国务院机关事务管理局\n\nState General Administration for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine\n\n国家质量监督检验检疫总局\n\nGeneral Administration of Press and Publication\n\n中国新闻出版署\n\nNational Copyright Administration\n\n国家版权局\n\nState Administration for Work Safety\n\n(State Administration of Coal Mine Safety)\n\n国家安全生产监督管理局\n\n(国家煤矿安全监察局)\n\nXinhua News Agency\n\n新华通讯社\n\nChinese Academy of Sciences\n\n中国科学院\n\nChinese Academy of Social Sciences\n\n中国社会科学院\n\nChinese Academy of Engineering\n\n中国工程院\n\nDevelopment Research Center of the State Council\n\n国务院发展研究中心\n\nNational School of Administration\n\n国家行政学院\n\nChina Seismological Bureau\n\n中国地震局\n\nChina Meteorological Administration\n\n中国气象局\n\nChina Securities Regulatory Commission\n\n证券监督管理委员会\n\nChina Insurance Regulatory Commission\n\n中国保险监督管理委员会\n\nNational Council for Social Security Fund\n\n全国社会保障基金理事会\n\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China\n\n国家自然科学基金委员会\n\nState Electricity Regulatory Commission\n\n国家电力监管委员会\n\nChina Banking Regulatory Commission\n\n中国银行业监督管理委员会\n\nOverseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council\n\n国务院侨务办公室\n\nHong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council\n\n国务院港澳事务办公室\n\nLegislative Affairs Office of the State Council\n\n国务院法制办公室\n\nEconomic Restructuring Office of the State Council\n\n国务院经济体制改革办公室\n\nResearch Office of the State Council\n\n国务院研究室\n\nTaiwan Affairs Office of the State Council\n\n国务院台湾事务办公室\n\nInformation Office of the State Council\n\n国务院新闻办公室\n\nOffice of the Leading Group for Western Region Development of the State Council\n\n国务院西部开发领导小组办公室\n\nState Council Informatization Office\n\n国务院信息化工作办公室\n\nState Bureau for Letters and Calls\n\n国家信访局\n\nState Administration of Grain\n\n国家粮食局\n\nState Tobacco Monopoly Administration\n\n国家烟草专卖局\n\nState Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs\n\n国家外国专家局\n\nState Oceanic Administration\n\n国家海洋局\n\nState Bureau of Surveying and Mapping\n\n国家测绘局\n\nState Post Bureau\n\n国家邮政局\n\nState Administration of Cultural Heritage\n\n国家文物局\n\nState Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine\n\n国家中医药管理局\n\nChina Atomic Energy Authority\n\n国家原子能机构\n\nState Administration of Foreign Exchange\n\n中国外汇管理局\n\nState Archives Bureau\n\n国家档案局\n\nNational Administration for Protection of State Secrets\n\n国家保密局\n\nLocal People's Congresses"
