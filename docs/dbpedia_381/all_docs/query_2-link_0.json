This post in its current form was first established in the Constitution in 1954, with the official English-language translation of \"state vice chairman\". The post of vice chairman was abolished under the Constitution of 1975 together with the chairman, then reinstated in the Constitution of 1982. Since 1982, the title's official English-language translation has been \"vice president\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged. The new constitution stipulated that the vice president could not serve more than two consecutive terms; the term limits were removed in 2018.\n\nUnder the current constitution, the president serves at the pleasure of the National People's Congress (NPC), the legislature. According to the constitution, the principal duty of the vice president is assisting the president in their duties. The vice president also assumes the presidency in case the office becomes vacant until a new president is elected by the NPC. The incumbent vice president of China is Han Zheng, who took office in 10 March 2023.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe office was first established under the Beiyang government when Li Yuanhong became the first Vice President of the country when the Republic was founded in 1912. The post was abolished in 1917, but it was restored after the end of the Nationalist government as Li Zongren became the first modern Vice President under the 1947 Constitution of the Republic of China. The office of the vice president along with the government of the Republic of China, was relocated to Taiwan in 1949, where it exists today.\n\nThe PRC post, which began as the state vice chairman was first established under the 1954 Constitution, together with the chairman.[2] It was, along with the state chairman, abolished in the new Constitution adopted by the 4th National People's Congress (NPC) in 1975. The office, now called the vice president, was restored in the 1982 constitution together with the presidency. The new constitution mandated term limits for the office, stipulating the president and vice president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. On March 11, 2018, the first session of the 13th National People's Congress, by a vote of 2,958 in favor, two opposed and three abstaining, passed a constitutional amendment that removed the previous term limits for the president and the vice president.[3]\n\nSelection\n\n[edit]\n\nEligibility\n\n[edit]\n\nArticle 79 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for being elected for the vice presidency. To serve as president, one must:\n\nbe a Chinese citizen;\n\nhave the right to vote and stand for election;\n\nbe at least 45 years old.[4][non-primary source needed]\n\nElection\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the Organic Law of the National People's Congress (NPC), constitutionally China's highest organ of state power, the vice president is nominated by the NPC Presidium, the Congress's executive organ.[5] However, the nomination is effectively made by the Chinese Communist Party, with the decisions being made among Party leaders.[6] Although the Presidium could theoretically nominate multiple candidates for the presidency, leading the election to be competitive, it has always nominated a single candidate for the office.[6]\n\nAfter the nomination, the vice president is elected by the NPC, which also has the power to remove the vice president and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[4][non-primary source needed] The length of the vice president's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years.[4] Since 2018, the vice president is required to recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[6]\n\nPowers\n\n[edit]\n\nThe vice president's duties constitutionally include assisting the president, and exercise part of their functions and powers on behalf of the president.[4][non-primary source needed] The vice president also becomes the president in case the office becomes vacant until a new president is elected by the NPC.[4][non-primary source needed] In case the vice presidency becomes vacant, the NPC elects a new vice president.[5][non-primary source needed]\n\nIn practice, the position of the vice president is mostly ceremonial;[7] Vice presidents Hu Jintao, Zeng Qinghong and Xi Jinping have been members of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Central Secretariat, the country's main decision making bodies; these three served concurrently as the first secretary of the Secretariat, in charge of party affairs.\n\nThe vice president may play a major role in foreign affairs. For instance, the vice president generally sits on the Central Foreign Affairs Commission, a policy coordination body of the CCP. The vice president has also typically sits on the Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs. Therefore, while the vice president may not actually have substantive powers as defined in the Constitution, the office nonetheless carries significance and prestige. The holders of the office have all been individuals with a degree of political clout.[citation needed]\n\nList of vice presidents\n\n[edit]\n\nGenerations of leadership\n\nFirst Administration Second Administration Third Administration Hu–Wen Administration Xi–Li Administration/Xi Jinping Administration\n\nCentral People's Government (1949–1954)\n\n[edit]\n\nVice Chairmen of the Central People's Government\n\n(co-serving, 1 October 1949 – 27 September 1954)\n\nZhu De\n\nLiu Shaoqi\n\nSong Qingling\n\nLi Jishen\n\nZhang Lan\n\nGao Gang (until his suicide on 17 August 1954)\n\nThe 1st Constitution (1954–1975)\n\n[edit]\n\nVice Chairmen of the People's Republic of China Portrait Name\n\n(Birth–Death)\n\nConstituency Term of office NPC Chairman 1 Zhu De\n\n朱德\n\n(1886–1976)\n\nSichuan at-large 27 September 1954 27 April 1959 I Mao Zedong The first Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China. 2 Song Qingling\n\n宋庆龄\n\n(1893–1981)\n\nShanghai at-large Dong Biwu\n\n董必武\n\n(1886–1975)\n\nHubei at-large 27 April 1959 17 January 1975 II · III Liu Shaoqi Served jointly as Vice Chairmen.
