        "text": "Badass. Cat warrior. A diehard “Taiwan independence” separatist. These are just a few of the adjectives used to describe Hsiao Bi-Khim, the government’s former top emissary to the US. She’s used to walking a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Taipei. That’s why she gave herself the moniker of cat warrior — a deliberate contrast with China’s wolf-warrior diplomacy — and a recognition of how useful the nimble and flexible characteristics of felines are when trying to stay on the fine line that is Taiwanese politics.\n\nAnd now she will get a chance to put those skills to work. In a widely expected move Monday, Vice President William Lai of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party selected Hsiao as his running mate in January’s election. The endorsement makes good sense — she has strong ties to Washington and is well-liked in both foreign policy and business circles."
