        "text": "It’s been a challenging start to Lai Ching-te’s presidency. Taiwan’s new leader was only sworn in on Monday, and he’s already dealing with the biggest Chinese military drills in a year and a significant challenge from the opposition in parliament that’s drawn thousands of protesters onto the streets.\n\nThe threat from China is growing, and these exercises in the Taiwan Strait — the narrow strip of water that separates the mainland from the self-ruled island — show what the start of an invasion might look like. The last time China launched a response of this magnitude was following the visit of the former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August 2022."
