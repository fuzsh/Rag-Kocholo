Exhibitors in New York state were this week just ending engaged, with diligence, handbills, letters and trailers, con- spicuously led by the Buffalo office of the Motion Picture Theatre Owners, in a fight on a proposed amendment to the constitution to legalize pari-mutuel betting at race tracks — both horse and dog. The issue goes to the voters of New York Tuesday next. Public gambling facilities and devices for the multitude are thrill-sales, vistas of \"escape\", that compete in time, attention, money with the emotional merchandise of the screen. There are just incidentally other factors. Very few, if any, cashiers have been found tapping the till to buy movie tickets, but at the moment it is possible to count over rather an array of wrecked careers in our own show world resulting from chas- ing the rainbows over the horse tracks. WHAT the occasional plunger does, or the time and money spent by the magnate class, does not matter. What counts alike to society in general and the box office in particular is the draining of slender margins of play- money in the pockets of the multitude. The motion picture, by the movement from Buffalo, and in many other manifestations, has found that it does not exist alone in a world of its own, but that it is an integrated part of the social and economic fabric. This fact has, to be sure, brought some abrupt surprises now and again, resulting in the necessity for such devices as a Production Code to attune the screen's wares to the American mores; or such awakening developments as a flood of legislation and litigation denoting a public concern about how it does business. AND with gambling issues afresh before us, it may be remarked that the motion picture theatre in campaign opposition to the pari-mutuel or other systems of bet- ting, legal or illegal, must be mindful of a certain inconsistency with its frequent resort to lottery lures at the box office. There has been experience enough so that the most obtuse must know that when the attraction at a motion picture theatre becomes anything but a motion picture the screen industry is invaded. It is to be observed that when the headline attraction is a personal appearance, a \"name\" band, a \"Lucky Night\", or whatever, the tendency is ever to present the cheapest and weakest picture on the schedule. This cuts the cost of that show, but it does not make for customers of the motion picture. And it is with motion pictures that the screen theatre must stand or fall. Also, there are many competitions besides petty gambling that seriously compete with th'e box office: among them base- ball, football, bridge and golf — and most of them getting a deal of promotional publicily on Ihe sueen. uDEMOCRACY\"-AGAIN BEGINNING in December of 1938 and running into suc- cessive issues in January of this year, Motion Picture Herald asked \"Films for Democracy\" to \"clearly, of- ficially and publicly declare its position with respect to: 1 — The political theories commonly known as Communism; 2 — The political theories commonly known as Fascism; 3 — The politi- cal theories characteristic of both Communism and Fascism, and commonly described as Totalitarianism, under which the state reserves to itself complete rights over the life, liberty and pursuits of the individual, denying to the individual those rights held under the traditional American system as a natural and inalienable heritage.\" This was signed by Martin Quigley, pub- lisher and editor-in-chief. October 21, under the heading of \"No Answer\", this page recorded that the merger born \"Film Audiences for Democ- racy\", taking in the late \"Associated Film Audiences\", had still made no answer, was still \"evasive, confused, reticent in con- fusion\". NOW under date of October 25 comes response from Henry Pratt Fairchild, president of \"Film Audiences for Democracy\", addressing Mr. Quigley to bring atten- tion to the organization's new letterhead which bears a foot- note reading: \"TO ENCOURAGE films that uphold American democracy, civil liberties, and peace; that promote better understanding and improve neighborly relations between racial and religious groups; that present an accurate, undistorted as well as socially useful portrayal of the contemporary scene. TO OPPOSE all total- itarian trends, attacks on labor, and films contrary to the prin- ciples of the Bill of Rights.\" \"That being so,\" writes Mr. Fairchild, \"there would seem to be no necessity for the editorial appearing over your sig- nature in the October 21 issue of Motion Picture Herald unless you wish to impute to Film Audiences for Democracy motives which it neither holds nor desires, sentiments which it neither expresses nor harbors.\" NINE months have elapsed since the Herald raised and reiterated the question. Since then the Hitler-Stalin pact has joined Nazism and Communism, and quite as closely as Nazism and Fascism were joined on \"the axis\" before. The answer comes on a footnote to a letterhead. It still does not declare specifically against Communism, specifically against Fascism, and lays a soft blanket in the phrase \"all totalitarian trends\". Meanwhile scanning the letterhead's boastful array of literary and militant names, one discovers the roster to include a num- ber of profound sympathizers with the Communists' cause, and others variously known for their identification with movements that many consider invasive of the American system. So far, so good. Mr. Fairchild's footnote denotes progress. There is considerable distance yet to go. Meanwhile, having declared against \"attacks on labor, and films contrary to the principles of the Bill of Rights\", it might be considerate too to include \"attacks on capital\"- — which seems yet to be and to have been from the beginning a part of the American Democracy. Terry Ramsayc 8 MOTION PICTURE HERALD November 4 , 1939 This Week in the News Hollywood Wants Labor to Concede REACTIONS to a war-bound world market continued this week to predominate in the motion picture business, East and West. The squeeze of budget revision and the costs problem officially reached at last to the extreme of trying to get militant Labor to cooperate. Interestingly, indeed, this came in the form of written appeal from the Pro- ducers' labor negotiation committee to none other than William Bioff, as western rep- resentative of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes, for relinquish- ment of the ten percent increase for 12,000 workers, won under strike threat September 25, last. Mr. Bioff's return to Hollywood authority is both spectacular and acknowl- edged. This represents the first official and di- rect approach to the problems posed by the one basic and vital element of production cost really subject to blanket negotiation, organized craftsmanship. All other costs in picture making are elements which are in theory under the control of individual execu- tive decision. Labor, thus for the day, has become the most important of the factors in answer to the continuing problem of 'What is Holly- wood going to do about the war?\" Labor, in general, however, indicated no answer and through its various voices some skepticism. Some leaders saw in the move a \"smoke screen\" for events to come, while others felt it was rather an endeavour at forestalling demands of other crafts. There were murmurings that the producers might well support their contentions by fig- ures on losses in foreign gross. Some an- ticipated a general attempt to break down all talent and craft salaries. Meanwhile Frank Carothers, secretary of the International Alliance's studio basic agreement committee, said the four inter- nationals, still remaining in their basic agreement, were proceeding on an \"as was\" basis with plans for demands for wage increases to come up at a New Jersey con- ference early in December. Labor wants to look at the books. (See page 15). The regular quarterly meeting of the board of directors of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America was continued Wednesday for another week, un- til next Wednesday, the sixth week in suc- cession, all of the discussions being princi- pally on the subject of studio and home of- fice economics and their relation to the international situation. Agents Under a Code AFTER YEARS of travail Hollywood tal- ent as represented by the Screen Actors Guild came to victory over racketeering practises of the much cursed agents, and their allies, just before the dawn of last Tuesday when the directors of the Artists Managers Guild ratified a seventy-nine page code of do's and don'ts. Agents are to be limited to ten percent commissions, and only one commission per deal. Inside deals between agents and pro- ducers and studios are forbidden. A certain long view of what might hap- pen, and an indication of fears in the minds of some, is presented in arrangements that, if lower maximum commissions are sought, it must be shown that salary levels are lower than '38-'39, \"or that the relative standing of the film industry as a branch of the entertainment world has suffered ma- terially so as to reduce the motion picture to a position of substantially less impor- tance ...\" It is a brave code, addressed at clearing abuses condemned long enough by both art- ists and employers. All that now remains is to enforce it. (See page 41). Why Flanagan? THE NEATEST eyebrow lifting surprise of the week came with the announcement from Vassar's president, Henry Noble Mc- Cracken, that by a special grant of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation Hallie Flanagan, former national director of the Federal Theatre, will supervise \"theatre re- search based on the records, experiments and productions of the Federal Theatre.\" It was to be recalled that Hallie Flana- gan and her administration gave the Fed- eral Theatre such amazing productions as \"Injunction Granted,\" \"Power,\" \"Horse Eats Hat\" and others just as good but cer- tainly no more red, radical and rampant. Some \"theatre research\" to discover who let this loose upon the nation has indeed been indicated but not why Rockefeller money should employ Hallie Flanagan to study herself and her works. 30 Gallon Act THE UPWARD and onward movement in the show business continues apace. The Star Theatre in Brooklyn advertises \"the sensation of two continents,\" in the act of \"The girl in the milk bath,\" and \"actually using 30 gallons of milk each show.\" Years ago Anna Held had a milk bath for the press agent's purposes, but not on the stage. Time marches on. How Free Speech ? OFFICIALS of the National Association of Broadcasters continue efforts to convince all hands that its new code provision regulating discussion of controversial public issues serves to preserve free speech. The efforts are meeting with considerable objection. Among the big name objectors are John Shepard III of the Yankee Network and Elliott Roosevelt, who has announced that he is taking his Texas stations out of the asso- ciation, as a slight indication of how he feels about the matter. The plight of the broadcasters is not an easy one. Whether the proposed method is the best way out of a bad situation remains to be seen. That it will make no contribu- tion to the American ideal of free speech goes without saying. It is quite the reverse of this in the sense that, stripped of circum- locutions, it simply says that the stations will determine who shall speak, when and about what. There is little doubt that the broadcasters do not relish the task before them. The peculiar nature of radio breeds new and different problems, and its custodians appar- ently are seeking to treat with them the best they know how. Notable among the new and different problems which appear in radio, and with u'hich the broadcasters must contend, is the fact that the continuance in business of any particular station depends upon the attitude of the Federal Communications Commission, including its political proclivities, if any. It is therefore a foregone conclusion that the broadcasters make no important policy decisions unless they know — or think they know — that any such decisions are agreeable to the commission. Bureaucrats usually have little interest in free speech beyond the first person, singular. Fiddlesticks MANY a radio listener's ear perked sharp- ly Tuesday evening along about 7:20 when Jimmie Fidler, film-news gossip commenta- tor, boomed into a microphone the \"scoop\" statement that Hollywood producers were contributing to a \"fund\" to buy up \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" from Columbia Pictures and to withdraw the production from circulation to save the industry from further Federal taxation and trust suit at- tacks that might result from wrathful Con- gressmen displeased with the manner in which Frank Capra pictured \"a\" Senator in his picture. To Mr. Fidler's \"scoop,\" which was November 4, 1939 MOTION PICTURE HERALD 9 scooped out over a coast-to-coast audience in the interests of the Procter and Gamble cleansers for house and hands, the Motion Picture Producers Association early next morning replied : \"Fiddlesticks.\" A few Washington Senators last week were reported to have become \"insulted\" by Mr. Capra's \"Mr. Smith,\" when the Chicago Tribune Syndicate's Washington political correspondent wrote from the Capital that the Senators were insulted, several days after the Senators had applauded the pic- ture at its local premiere. Drunkard's Reward THE OTHER DAY— October 18, for the record — Charlie Ruggles passed his eleventh anniversary on the Paramount lot in Holly- wood, where he has played mainly roles of reporter drunks, beginning with \"Gentle- men of the Press.\" He shows progress now, however, being promoted to sports editor in \"Opened by Mistake,\" current produc- tion. In this he also gets drunk. The other day the publicity department stood him against the wall with Adolph Zukor and shot them both, recording that Mr. Zukor as chairman of the board of Paramount Pic- tures Corporation had presented Mr. Ruggles with a full ten-reel print of his \"Gentlemen of the Press.\" Had Mr. Ruggles then chosen to go get personally and really drunk he would have been justi- fied. Openings IN SOME TOWNS never before visited officially by motion picture \"royalty,\" where the tom-toms of a blazing \"world premiere,\" have never been heard, natives this week goggled at their movie favorites, at touch- ing distance, as the new trend in exploita- tion continued. On Thursday, Twentieth Century-Fox beat its \"Drums Along the Mohawk\" simul- taneously in five cities of New York's his- toric Mohawk Valley — Albany, Utica, Am- sterdam, Schenectady, and Gloversville. On the same day, RKO took its \"Alle- gheny Uprising\" to Pittsburgh. On Wednesday, Warners screened \"Eliza- beth and Essex\" for the first time, publicly, in Philadelphia. RKO will open \"That's Right, You're Wrong,\" starring band leader Kay Kyser, in Kay's home town, Rocky Mount, North Carolina, on November 15th. Paramount in January will open \"Seven- teen\" at Indianapolis, home of Booth Tark- ington, author of the story from which the picture was adapted. (See page 39). Trade Relations THE FIELD of distributor-exhibitor re- lations continued as diversely complex as ever with the flow of time seeming to wear off some of the sharper edges of contro- versy— and new controversy still available. The Department of Justice, having agreed to an extension of time on the return of the interrogatories addressed to defendants in the anti-trust suit, to November 1, has now granted fifteen days more, and, im- portantly, has agreed to narrow some of the interrogatories. (See page 61.) Back from White Sulphur Springs and the Motion Picture Theatre Owners of America directors' meeting, Ed Kuykendall was of the opinion that most of the major distributors would be following the process of Warner Brothers and Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer in embodying phases of the late- and- debated trade practise code. (Page 16.) And then, this week, too, that hardy per- ennial issue of protection-and-zoning flared up again conspicuously in a protest from the Allied organiaztion of California, Ari- zona and Nevada that agreements were be- ing broken down in favor of the Wiltern, a Warner second run, in Los Angeles. There appeared a disposition on the part of the exhibitor organization to make the issue a broad cause. (See page 16.) Paramount 9s Mystery CLINTON J. SCOLLARD, more exten- sively known as \"Pat,\" is the mystery man, now giving Paramount Pictures Corporation, its records and works, a going over — and for the second time. The first time it was at the behest of Joseph P. Kennedy, when Mr. Kennedy was experting and preparing that famous unpublished report on the cor- poration. The staff has been informed that Mr. Scollard is just an \"efficiency man,\" but the fact is that he is doing some compiling for the purposes of defense against the Thurman Arnold anti-trust suit. Mr. Scollard came by his nickname of \"Pat\" way back yonder when he was a small boy in South Braintree, Massachusetts. The story is that a group of mischievous lads stoned the windows of a cobbler's shop and that when the village constable charged the scene it was \"Clint\" that he nabbed. Ever since they've called him \"the Patsy.\" Walking Distance HALCYON DAYS in a glamoured career were recalled to the observant few this week when Broadway program media appeared with a little blackfaced type advertisement, reading : PENTHOUSE — Originally built for a Hollywood star. Above 18th floor [75' X 100'). Overlooking Central Park, eight rooms with private terrace all around and above. All exposures. Living room, din- ing rooms, 3 large bedrooms, 4 baths. Complete kitchen. Moderate rental, 5 min- utes' walk from Radio City. It was there in more effulgent days that Gloria Swanson was domiciled, there that ill-fated \"Queen Kelly\" was planned. Came the day when Miss Swanson came no more to her aerie over mid-town. Last of pic- ture name to occupy it was E. J. (Ted) O'Leary, in the process of passing from pictures to liquor, Somerset Importers, Ltd. Edison Twice A NEAT QUESTION of exploitation arises with MGM's doubled barrelled proj- ect of substantially simultaneous production of \"Young Tom Edison\" with Mickey Rooney and \"Edison, the Man\" with Spencer Tracy. Both are being put before the cameras, in the order of their age, by John W. Considine, Jr., the first two weeks in November. Whether they are to be sequen- tially released, or separated by a time in- terval, will be determined, along with other elements, after screen examination and pre- views. Admitting the genius of the late Thomas A. Edison, it is only by the devices of the Hollywood that has arisen from his invention that he is empowered to relive two parts of his career at once. He will be meeting himself at Culver City.

BEFORE AND AFTER the big Roxy rug laying ceremony. Above, the 22 Gae Foster girls, tak- ing time out from rehearsals, prepare to unroll what is called the largest oval rug ever to be woven in one piece, bought by the theatre management from the Mohawk Mills in Amsterdam, N. Y., to replace the one purchased in 1927 by the late S. L. Rothafel when the theatre was opened. Publicity men turned statisticians hurriedly estimated that 70,000,001 persons had crossed the old carpet, the one being the sole customer who went back to scrape up the gum he had dropped. Below, the girls, having completed the laying ceremony, try out the one inch pile. \"31 TRIP TO HOLLYWOOD, below.

(All phdtdi »V Staff FhoMtjrhphtr) November 4, 1939 MOTION PICTURE HERALD 15 HOLLYWOOD PLEADS WITH LABOR TO TAKE SALARY CUT IN EMERGENCY Screen Actors Cuild Rules Players' Free uGuest\" Appearances Off the Air A move determined to prevent possible recurrence of the \"forcing\" of screen players to make free radio appearances on sponsored shaivs was made this week by the Screen Actors Guild, in Hollywood, which informed the Association of Motion Pic- ture Producers that such practice of any studio would be considered a violation of the Guild's basic agreement with the producers. In another move, the national board of the American Federation of Radio Actors was asked by Laurence Beilenson, Guild attorney, and I. B. Kornblum, Hollywood representative, of the American Federation of Radio Artists to suspend or discipline appropriately any member who works on air shows below an ordinary salary. The move hinged upon the disclosure that Lonella O. Parsons, Hearst radio column- ist would introduce players appearing on a \"Drums Along the Mohawk\" dramatiza- tion on the Kate Smith air show Friday night, which was regarded by the Guild as an opening wedge for free performance shows. Miss Parsons declared she had nothing to do with arranging the show but merely would introduce, at the request of the studio, various players who appear. But Organized Talent Ridicules Cry for Economy at Expense of Wage and Personnel Re- ductions; Other Union Notes Pleading a desperation caused by \"stop- page of revenues from Europe\" and the fear that the motion picture industry may face \"absolute ruin\" from a combination of that and increased labor costs, and appealing to the \"sense of fairness and decency\" of the Hollywood crafts unions, the producers on Monday asked William Bioff, western repre- sentative of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, to relinquish the 10 per cent wage increase which he, act- ing for the 12,000 studio workers under threat of a strike, gained September 25th. While the producers were delivering this appeal, various studio creative talent groups, headed by the Screen Actors Guild, were de- precating the cry for an \"economy\" that in- volved wage and personnel cuts. Bioff Undecided Mr. Bioff on Tuesday said that he might de- cide to ignore the plea altogether, adding that he was undecided on what course to take in the unusual situation. Mixed reactions among leaders of other Hollywood unions met the producers' appeal, some believing the move is a \"smoke screen\" for events to come in connection with the economic situation growing out of the international prob- lem, others thinking the plea is a move to fore- stall demands of other studio crafts for wage increases. The producers' appeal was in a four page let- ter from E. J. Mannix, chairman of the pro- ducers' labor negotiating committee, to Mr. Bioff, a letter which repeatedly attacked the union spokesman's resistance to the arguments of the producers that economy was necessary in the present emergency and that the union should refrain from starting a series of wage demands by all workers. \"We attempted to show you,\" the letter to Mr. Bioff said, \"the inevitable and tremendous effect in closing or part time closing of theatres in warring countries, depreciation in value of English currency, embargo on export of money by many countries, and many detrimental changes to our business taking place not only in the war zone but throughout the world.\" The letter referred to the producers' request for a postponement of negotiations, a postpone- ment which, on that September day, and night, the union had refused; and it declared that the producers \"regretted\" granting the increase. Mr. Mannix this week urged the IATSE to \"become a constructive force for the preserva- tion of the industry, rather than an element which destroys it.\" He said that on the earlier occasion Mr. Bioff had \"callously and with argument of threatened force insisted on in- crease.\" \"Even in the short time that has now elapsed,\" the letter continued, \"we realize more fully the disaster which your ill-considered action must cause this industry. The foreign situation is even more threatening and difficult than at the time of our negotiations. . . . Granting of our demands has loosed a flood of demands from other employee groups . . . which collectively are impossible to grant and must mean absolute ruin.\" At the time the producers granted the IATSE 10 per cent advance, it was estimated that this alone would mean an annual increase in studio costs of $5,000,000. Meanwhile, the Screen Actors Guild which, with the Screen Directors Guild and other talent guilds, has \"doubted\" the producers' arguments that stringent economy is necessary, gave of- ficial voice to these sentiments in the October issue of its official bulletin. It suggested to the producers, in their search for economy methods, \"Walk, don't run.\" While the producers were appealing for a waiving of the wage increase, which was retro- active to August 12th, Moving Picture Painters Local 644, led by Herbert Sorrell, was still de- manding a 15 per cent wage increase, under a strike threat. The International Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paperhangers of America and the Los Angeles district council of painters have approved the proposed strike, according to Mr. Sorrell. Producers were facing another strike threat, this by the Studio Publicists Guild, which wrote the AMPP demanding that a contract, pur- portedly agreed upon by the producers on Octo- ber 9th, be made effective immediately. Business representatives of Hollywood crafts unions met last week and opposed formation of any office workers' unions except in the Amer- ican Federation of Labor. They also said they would invite AFL office workers' unions. The Universal Office Employees Association is asking the studio for a contract, and seeking recognition by the National Labor Relations Board. Both Paramount and MGM on the Coast have agreements with their office workers. J. W. Buzzell, secretary of the Los Angeles Central Labor Council, has called the Universal Studio Employees Guild a \"company union.\" Joseph Touhy, secretary of the Conference of AFL Studio Crafts Unions, said the federation would organize all studio office workers to prevent formation of \"company,\" independent or C.I.O. unions. Laboratory Technicians Local 683 last week warned the majors it might strike unless they stopped giving work to four laboratories with which the union has failed to agree on bargain- ing terms. The four are Cinecolor, Mercer, Williams and Pacific Title. The directors of the Artists Managers Guild this week ratified a licensing agreement with the Screen Actors Guild (see page 52). The new agreement between Actors Equity and the Screen Actors Guild, whereby the Guild no longer will pay dues for members of Equity working in films, went into effect Thursday. The new plan provides that all Equity members are covered by the interchangeability plan evolved by the Associated Actors and Artistes of America, parent union of actors. Last _ week the National Labor Relations Board, in Washington, ordered bargaining agent elections within 30 days, at the studios of Wal- ter Lantz Productions, Loew's, Inc., Raymond Katz Studio, and Leon Schlesinger. The elec- tion was asked by the Screen Cartoon Guild, unaffiliated. Negotiate Exchange Wages Negotiations on a new contract between the majors and their exchange workers, are sched- uled. The present local and master pacts, in effect for two years, expire November 30th. Try Nick Again The extortion trial of John P. Nick, deposed head of the St. Louis projectionists' union, Local 143, is expected to begin next Monday in that city's circuit court. It is a retrial. The first action against Mr. Nick charging ex- tortion of $10,000 from theatre owners in 1936, was declared a mistrial two weeks ago. Hear Picket Petition Hearing on petitions of Fanchon and Marco, Eden Theatre Company, and St. Louis Amuse- ment Company for a restraining order against St. Louis projectionists Local 143, for picket- ing their neighborhood houses, was called this Thursday in St. Louis circuit court. More St. Louis Strikes The St. Louis Motion Picture Theatre Ushers and Attendants Union this week was picketing the Bremen and O'Fallon theatres, operated by Clarence H. Kaimann, an important witness in the Nick trial. The strike was over Mr. Kai- mann's refusal to enter into a separate agree- ment with the union. Settle Wisconsin Strike The strike of the Wisconsin projectionists union, Local 164, against Ross Baldwin, owner of the Tosa theatre, in Wauwatosa, has been settled. The union is negotiating with Mil- waukee County exhibitors on a new two-year contract. 16 MOTION PICTURE HERALD November 4, 1939 MPTOA PREDICTS MORE CONCESSIONS; COAST EXHIBITORS ATTACK CLEARANCE Allied of California, Arizona and Nevada Accuses War- ners of Trying to Break Down Zoning Agreements Following the lead of Warner Brothers and MGM, most of the majors will include some of the trade practice code's provisions in their new contracts, according to Ed Kuy- kendall, president of the Motion Picture Theatre Owners of America. Mr. Kuyken- dall, who expressed this opinion in New York over the weekend, after attendance at the MPTOA board of directors' meeting in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, early last week, also outlined future proce- dure of his organization, including efforts to have revised the present theatre liability and fire insurance rates. California Allied Protests Warner Brothers this week was considering the protest by the Allied of California, Arizona and Nevada, against what it called an attempt \"to break down zoning agreements\" in Los An- geles, in favor of the Warner-affiliated theatre, the Wiltern. Copies of the written protest to Gradwell Sears, vice-president and general sales manager of the distributing company, were sent by Allied to the trade press. In New York this week, and even as Max Cohen, president of the New York Allied (ex- pelled by the National Allied recently) was opening the meeting in Syracuse of his unit, it appeared as if he had won complete victory over the dissidents in his organization who fa- vored reaffiliation with the national group. Thir- teen members of the board of directors have voted confidence in Mr. Cohen, accepted the resignation of E. Thornton Kelly (leader of the dissidents), and resolved that the New York unit should continue independently. Washington MPTO Reorganizing In Seattle last week, the Motion Picture The- atre Owners of Washington appeared ready to reorganize as an independent state group, affiliated only with the new Pacific Coast Conference of Theatre Owners, a group of Coast independent units. Other exhibitor organization highlights of the week were the annual meeting of the In- dependent Theatres Protective Association of Wisconsin and Upper Michigan, in Milwaukee, on Monday and Tuesday of this week ; the com- ing convention on next Sunday and Monday in Dallas, of the Texas Allied; the meeting of the board of managers of the United Motion Picture Theatre Owners of Eastern .Pennsyl- vania, New Jersey and Delaware, last week in Philadelphia ; a special bulletin of the Mo- tion Picture Theatre Owners of Western New York, warning against passage of a pari-mu- tuel race betting amendment to the New York State constitution ; the forthcoming annual con- vention of the Independent Theatre Owners of Ohio ; an all-day membership meeting of the Allied of New Jersey, in Passaic, New Jersey, on November 9th; the appointing of commit- tees for the December convention of the The- atre Owners of North and South Carolina, and the affiliation of Allied Theatres of Connecticut with the New England Allied branch, Inde- pendent Exhibitors, Inc., of Boston. Mr. Kuykendall, in predicting that all dis- tributors would \"come about\" to the Warner and MGM point of view, in inclusion of trade practice reforms in their contracts, said he 26 STATE UNITS ARE CLAIMED FOR ALLIED Both national exhibitor organiza- tions— Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors and the Motion Picture Theatre Owners of America have zealously guarded the number of members within its ranks. On occasion, however, they report on the number and identities of state and local exhibitor groups which claim affiliation. In The Indiana Exhibitor, official publication of the Associated Theatre Owners of Indiana, 26 units are listed as being affiliated with Allied, as fol- lows : Allied of Connecticut, District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota and Da- kotas, combined, and Allied of New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklohoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Ver- mont, Eastern Pennsylvania and Cali- fornia-Arizona-Nevada, in combina- tion. Also: MPTO of Maryland, Montana Exhibitors Association, Independent Exhibitors of New England, North Dakota Exhibitors Association, Inde- pendent Theatre Owners of Virginia, ITO of Ohio, MPTO of Western Pennsylvania-West Virginia and Inde- pendent Theatres Protective Associa- tion of Wisconsin-Upper Michigan. did not even believe it necessary personally to \"persuade\" executives of the other companies. However, he qualified by saying that if re- forms did not come within \"a reasonable time,\" MPTOA discussions with majors' executives would resume. Twentieth Century-Fox and Paramount would soon make concessions, Mr. Kuykendall said he was informed. The MPTOA has appointed a committee to negotiate for more favorable fire insurance and liability rates, Mr. Kuykendall said. This did not mean cooperative insurance buying, he noted. On the committee are Arthur Lock- wood, chairman; Lewen Pizor, Charles Hay- man, and Mitchell Wolfson. The committee will try to equalize theatre and department store fire insurance ratings, he said, noting that the stores enjoy a lower rate, though more liable to fires. The committee will try to have liability de- termined by the number of seats per house, rather than by the annual patronage, Mr. Kuy- kendall said. The appointment of a fact-finding commit- tee to determine the extent to which Holly- wood production is being cut, in quality, and how much the war has affected revenues — a move authorized by the board of directors last week — is being delayed, the MPTOA prexy said. Speakers' Bureau Tryout As for the MPTOA plan for regional speak- ers' bureaus to combat publicity unfavorable to motion pictures, that will be tried first by the MPTO of Northern California, he said. The bureaus will \"educate\" civic, social, and business forums with speakers \"friendly\" to the industry. For the next 12 months, the MPTOA will concentrate on the industry's \"most important\" problems, cancellation, overbuying, unreason- able clearance, and unfair competition, Mr. Kuykendall advised. In connection with Mr. Kuykendall's state- ment that the Northern California unit of the MPTOA would be the first to form a speakers' bureau, it was reported from Buffalo this week that the MPTO of Western New York was this week considering the immediate dispatch of speakers to women's organizations to explain the motion picture industry's (or some portion of it) opposition to Governmental regulation, as exemplified by the Neely Bill. Protest Made to Sears The protest by the California, Arizona, and Nevada Allied against the Warner Brothers' alleged favoring of their own theatre, the Wil- tern, in Los Angeles clearance, detailed the \"discrimination.\" The letter to Mr. Sears said, in part: \"An alarming situation has been suddenly pre- cipitated by your Los Angeles branch in their decision to sell the Wiltern Theatre (a War- ner Bros. Theatre) your pictures on the basis of 21 days after Los Angeles first run closing at a 40c admission price — calling it an ex- clusive second run in the whole city of Los Angeles, which is nothing but a fraud and subterfuge. Furthermore any and all other 40c theatres located in any of the 24 separate zones in the city would have to play their pictures not sooner than 28 days after Los Angeles first run closings and in addition the rest of the price schedule such as 3Sc-30c-25c-20c and 15c houses would all be thrown back seven days later. . . . \"To deprive independent exhibitors of the right to play pictures 21 days after Los An- geles first run closings at 40 cents is indeed unfair and unjust, and in our opinion a direct violation of the so-called 'consent decree' which even at the present time the United States Government is attempting to enforce by the complaint filed in Federal Court against the various motion picture distributors.\" The Allied letter called attention to the \"statement of policy\" by Jack Warner, placed in the trade publications as an advertisement, ami quoted the \"promises\" given by it. \"Now we ask you, why in Heaven's name can you publicly go on record with such an adver- tisement, and then turn around and break up the entire zoning and clearance schedule in Southern California,\" the letter to Mr. Sears said. Mr. Sears made no comment on the Allied protest. Max Cohen Wins Vote Max Cohen, president of the erstwhile tur- bulent New York Allied, recently expelled from the National Allied States Association, presided at a state-membership meeting in Syra- cuse this Wednesday, after winning a signal vote of confidence from his board of directors. These, meeting last Friday, in New York City, backed Mr. Cohen, unanimously accepted the \"resignation\" of E. Thornton Kelly as executive secretary of the unit (Mr. Kelly hav- ing unsuccessfully attempted to rally New York members into a \"new\" New York Allied to be affiliated again with the National Allied). The membership expressed a hope for a state film code. At the directors' meeting were Joseph Ro- (Continued on parte 18, column 1) November 4, 19 3 9 MOTION PICTURE HERALD 17 NEW FLOOD OF WAR FILMS FROM HOLLYWOOD, EUROPE AND VAULTS 28 Productions Newly Avail- able Include Features from England, France and Italy; Many States Rights The business of bringing out war films and international topicals pertaining thereto is booming. Another score of military and related subjects has reached the market since Motion Picture Herald first reported on the trend, which shaped up last September as abruptly as came England's weekend de- cision to go to war with France against Germany. Twenty-eight films are newly available in the form of new releases from Hollywood and Europe, and reissues from the dusty vaults of both. Two from Leichter Mitchel Leichter, independent producer and distributor, was expected to leave Hollywood next week for a tour of key cities, in which he will offer distribution franchises on a state right basis for his war picture, \"She Goes to War,\" a United Artists release of 1930 to which Mr. Leichter obtained rights and to which he added footage, reducing total length to eight reels from the old 10. Eleanor Boardman is starred; Henry King directed; Rupert Hughes wrote the story. Another Leichter acquisition is \"Hell's Harbor,\" from Inspiration Pictures, released by United Artists in 1922. Report \"Dead Men\" Dates Alliance Films Corporation's \"Dead Men Tell No Tales,\" British made, and recently arrived, stars Emlyn Williams. It has played first runs in Rochester, Albany and Akron, and has been booked first-run in Cincinnati, Day- ton. Middletown, Danville, Portsmouth, Mans- field, Niles, and Springfield, Ohio; and in Hartford, Conn. \"Battle Fleets\" Another RKO reports that the March of Time produc- tion, \"Battle Fleets of England,\" is receiving a full quota of bookings, interest having been enhanced by the German airplane raids upon the British fleet in the North Sea and in Scottish bases. RKO on Tuesday also announced \"The Marines Fly High,\" for immediate production in Hollywood by Robert Sisk, and starring Steffi Duna, Hungarian actress and Richard Dix. \"Double Crime\" Held Over \"Double Crime in the Maginot Line\" is on a run at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse, in New York, and has been booked by Tower Pictures, its distributor, into the Skouras and Walter Reade circuits in lower New York State and northern New Jersey territories. The film was made in France. \"Grande Gloire\" Here \"Grande Gloire,\" the first picture completed in France since the war, and about the war, is being released by Transatlantic Films. It stars Mireille Balin and Erich von Stroheim. French News Short Here \"What Hitler Did and What Hitler Said,\" first issue of a new \"War Bulletin\" series from French Cinema Center, New York, has arrived in the United States and has been CANADA BARS NAZI FILMS AS WAR MOVE Motion pictures made in Germany or shipped from that country since the opening of the war are banned from Canada under penalties provided by the Trade with the Enemy Regulations of the War Measures Act, even i&hen they are to be imported from a neu- tral country. The stand is taken that the use of such pictures constitutes trading with an enemy country on the ground that payment for rental provides a form of revenue for Germany, even in a remote and indirect method. The regulations apply to all commodities in which there would be financial ad- vantage for the \"opposition.\" booked into the World theatre there. The series will be released monthly ; commentary is in English, each in two reels. Revise \"Hell's Angels\" \"Hell's Angels,\" war story which marked the late Jean Harlow's star debut, is being revised to bring it up to date. Bob Savini, distributor, arrived in California this week to assist in the revision which will be completed in time for a January 1 release. \"Beast\" Title Stays Ben Judell, president of Producers' Picture Corporation, said last week in Hollywood that no change was expected in the title of \"Hitler — Beast of Berlin\" and that the release, on last Sunday, would be observed. The picture is built on Shepard Traube's novel, \"Goose- Step,\" was directed in Hollywood by Sherman Scott, and stars Steffi Duna, Lucien Prival, Vernon Dent, and George Roesner. The story details the adventures of an anti-Hitler group in Germany. Saying it was \"inhuman, sacrilegious and tended to incite crime,\" the New York censor board Monday banned \"Hitler, Beast of Berlin.\" Henry Rathner, New York representative of the producer, charged that \"the decision of the censors is a violation of constitutional rights.\" He said the censors' order would be fought, if necessary, in the highest courts. The MPPDA withheld its Production Code seal from the picture, according to Mr. Rathner, on the basis of the title alone. Pennsylvania censors approved the film Tuesday. \"All Quiet\" Repeats Universal reports additional repeat bookings on its reissue of the old war film, \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Capitalizing on the current war situation and recollecting the play it received when it was revived six months ago, the Orpheum in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., for example, has scheduled another repeat of \"All Quiet.\" \"Nazi Captive\" on the Coast \"I Was a Captive of Nazi Germany,\" war film reputedly telling the true life experi- ences of Isobel Lillian Steele, young American girl who was held in a Nazi prison, had its west coast showing at the Cinema theatre, Hollywood, Wednesday. The film, which is based on Miss Steele's book, was produced by Albert Mannon and distributed by Bert Gold- berg. She plays the lead. \"That They May Live\" \"That They May Live,\" a French condemna- tion of war and its horrors, will have its Amer- ican premiere Monday at the Filmarte theatre, New York. Abel Gance directed and Pierre van Paassen wrote the English titles. Les Gueules Cassees, the mutiliated veterans of the last World War, appear in the picture, starring Victor Francen, supported by Paul Amiot, Rollin, Andre Nox, Walter, Line Noro, Jean Max and others. Arthur Mayer and Joseph Burstyn are dis- tributing the film nationally. (A review appears in this issue.) Pathe News War Film Pathe News is producing a one-reel film on the war with commentary by Major George Eliot Fielding, of the U. S. Army, who will also do the narration. By means of war pictures and diagrams, Major Fielding will explain strategy on the Western front and what may happen when either the Allies or Germany starts the \"big push.\" Production is under the supervision of Frederic Ullman, Jr., Pathe News producer. Neil Sullivan, Pathe News cameraman, who went over to cover 'the war, is now in Berlin. He had been in Holland awaiting a German permit. Red Cross Pictures Warners has announced plans for the produc- tion of \"Clara Barton and the American Red Cross\" as a two-reel color subject, to be su- pervised by Gordon Hollingshead. MGM on last May 20 released a John Nes- bitt \"Passing Parade\" short, titled \"Angel of Mercy,\" which featured Clara Barton's fight for organization and acceptance of the Red Cross. Hold Over \"Espionage Agent\" \"\"Espionage Agent,\" Warner war film, is now in general release. It was held over for a second week at the New York Strand. The picture stars Brenda Marshall and Joel McCrea. Film Brings Reacting Monogram's release, \"The Fight For Peace,\" an anti-war compilation of topical material with a commentary written by the historian, Hendrik Willem Van Loon, and narrated by David Ross, was the subject of debate recently, by Thomas Mann, author, and Albert Einstein, mathematician. ' \"Gold Star Mothers\" Ben Judell's Producers Pictures Corporation was reported attempting to get ready a second film concerning war, \"Gold Star Mothers,\" for release November 11th. William Ullman, Jr., wrote the script. Didn't Ban UA Film United Artists' British-made film, \"An Eng- lishman's Home,\" was not, as reported, banned in_ England by the request of the British air ministry, the United Artists' foreign depart- ment said. The picture has had a run at the London Pavilion theatre, according to Arthur Kelly, UA foreign chief.

The move by the Motion Picture Theatre Owners of Washington for an affiliation with the Pacific Coast conference of independent coast exhibitor units was inaugurated at a state convention last week in Washington. L. 0. Lukan, 1939 president of the unit, and James W. Hone, secretary, will reorganize the unit, eliminating all state officers except a board of trustees and an executive secretary. The convention elected no new officers or board members. However, when the new unit is organized, a new board will be chosen. The present officers and board members in- clude Paul Aust, B. F. Shearer, John Danz, Harry Black, Al Rosenberg, and John Ham- rick, of Seattle ; Milton Kenworthy, of Mos- cow, Idaho ; Cecil Gwinn, of Olympia ; Wil- liam Ripley, of Longview ; Fred Mercy, Jr., of Yakima; and Mildred Bishop, of Lewiston, Idaho. Milwaukee Independents Meet In Milwaukee the Independent Protective As- sociation of Wisconsin and Upper Michigan attacked double features ; urged friendly rela- tions with circuits and advised harmony within industry ranks. Among the speakers were Bert Fischer, Charles Trampe, August Berkholz and Harry Perlowitz. Nearly 600 guests and mem- bers attended. Colonel Henry Albert Cole, president of the National Allied States Association, and a Texan ; Abram F. Myers, its general counsel ; W. A. Steffes, Northwest Allied leader; James R.

The luncheon meeting last week in Phila- delphia of the United Motion Picture Theatre Owners of Eastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey, and Delaware, was occupied most- ly with a discussion of sales policies and the Neely Bill. Lewen Pizor, the president, re- ported on the MPT OA meeting in White Sul- phur Springs, early last week. The Motion Picture Theatre Owners of Western New York, in a special bulletin op- posing passage of an amendment to the state constitution allowing pari-mutuel betting, warned that passage would \"ruin\" the film business and that repeal might take five years. It advised that theatre men might buy a trailer for $1.80 from National Screen Service and Greyhound Film Laboratories, the latter in Buf- falo, advising voters to vote \"no\" on the amendment, in this month's balloting. Ohio Board To Meet The board of directors of the Independent Theatre Owners of Ohio are to meet shortly after the November 7th elections to decide whether the annual convention should be post- poned.

Scenes in the pic- ture were photographed aboard the warship. \"U-Boat\" Publicity Columbia's \"U-Boat 29\" also played at the Globe Theatre, in New York, concurrently with the attacks by the German submarine fleet upon the British fleet in its Scottish bases. It was produced for Columbia by Irving Asher, in England, and stars Conrad Veidt. Hold Cummins Picture \"Why This War?\", a Jewel Productions (Samuel Cummins) release, was held over for a second week at the Cameo Theatre, New York. Italian War Film \"Scipio Africanus,\" Italian film for which Milton Doushkess has written English titles, began an engagement at the Cinecitta theatre, 44th Street and 8th Avenue, New York, on Thursday. With the Second Punic War its background and with Isa Miranda, Francesca Braggiotti and Annibale Ninchi its stars, the film is to be shown in cooperation with Latin and history teachers in New York high schools and col- leges. \"Scipio Africanus,\" called the most expensive film ever made in Italy, was directed by Carmine Gallone and more than 6,000 play- ers are said to appear in the battle scenes. It has a musical score by I. Pizzetti. Hays Office Wants War Films 'Neutral' A policy of complete neutrality is being pur- sued by the office of the Motion Picture Pro- ducers and Distributors of America on matters relating to war pictures. Church and peace groups and individuals are said to have made many complaints against motion pictures with martial themes, since the European war began last September. Specific objections have been made against MGM's \"Thunder Afloat,\" RKO's \"Nurse Edith Cavell,\" and \"U-Boat 29,\" a Columbia picture produced in England. Complaints to the office of Will H. Hays and the MPPDA call these pictures \"war mongering.\" The answer to all the objections is that the pictures were com- pleted or in production before the outbreak of war and were not calculated to inflame Ameri- can public opinion or get us into the war. The MPPDA reports that no complaints have been received since the war began on Warners' \"Confessions of a Nazi Spy,\" because that film was released before the fighting began. The Hays office is interpreting strictly the provision of the Production Code which covers national feelings : \"The history, institutions, prominent people and citizenry of other nations shall be represented fairly.\" The general ten- sion caused by the world situatfon and the indi- vidual protests have brought special attention to this section of the Production Code. Joseph I. Breen, Production Code Adminis- trator in Hollywood, arrived in New York Wednesday morning and went into conference immediately with Will H. Hays, in his suite at the Hotel Vanderbilt.

DEPINET VICE-PRESIDENT RKO RADIO PICTURES November 4, 1939 MOTION PICTURE HERALD 23 BRITISH TRADE SEES RAYS OF HOPE BREAKING THROUGH THE BLACKOUTS Optimists Predict War Boom in Entertainment After the Na- tion Adjusts Itself to War Basis; Transport and Labor Problems by AUBREY FLANAGAN in London With Britain, at the time of writing, com- paratively free from bombing raids, the fierceness of war on the domestic front not yet fully felt, the British exhibitor is cur- rently adjusting himself to the new condi- tions. Though the process of adjustment may take, before it is complete, six months or more, the feeling is daily gaining ground that the future may not be so bad as the more pessimistic think. Prosperity Seen Currently aggravating the British exhibitor are a series of headaches, result of new and acute trade problems which have, as yet, not been solved. With these settled, and it is but a process of time and evolution before they are settled, more sanguine spirits in the trade here foresee, with the virtual elimination of most other forms of competition and the likely in- crease in money circulation and spending power, a period of prosperity. Though there are more problems than four facing the British theatre owner at present, the most acute form a tantalizing quartette: (a) The rising costs aggravated by transport conditions, trade restrictions, and so forth. (b) The likelihood of a future shortage of product ; this linked with the difficulty of ob- taining supplies. (c) Staff difficulties aggravated by mobiliza- tion and the diversion of labor. (d) The gradual undermining of the whole system of economics and trading which has en- tirely changed the value of the motion picture. Other Restrictions Irk Trade Add to these such minor but aggravating in- cidentals as the question of matinee prices, re- striction of opening hours, the arbitrary be- havior of local authorities, the abolition of queues in certain areas, the complexities of air raid warnings, etc., and the result is a pretty little tangle for the trade operator to unravel. Despite this, the optimists in our midst fore- see in the not far distant future, the motion pic- ture having a virtual monopoly of the enter- tainment business in war stricken Britain. Taking these considerations in reverse order, the economics of the business presents itself as not the least complex problem. Exhibitors are finding that the pre-war estimates of the eco- nomics values of films are now far out. Pro- grams booked at SO per cent before last Sep- tember might have been economic. Today they are more often suicidal. No safe estimate can be made of the earning capacity of the motion picture in a country girt for battle. Until con- ditions adjust themselves it is not easy to formu- late, establish or operate a satisfactory system of economics. Time, however, will tell. Shortage of Labor The mobilization of thousands of men into the armed forces, most of them admittedly the younger generation, has seriously depleted the labor market and exhibitors are finding acute difficulties in fully staffing the projection box, in training linkmen and ushers, and developing firemen to the degree of efficiency compelled by DISCUSS SUPPLY OF FILMS TO TROOPS Negotiations are being carried on among the Cinematograph Exhibitors Association, Kinematograph Renters Society (distributors) and the British War Officce for a new basis for the supply of films to English troops. The aim is to make^effective the pre- war agreement to leave the matter of film entertainment for the army to a trade committee, handling films from all distributors, including American. A similar basis is expected to be worked out with the Naval Film Corp. The release version of \"The Lion Has Wings,\" produced by Alexander Korda, was screened Monday, with long waiting lines despite a morning air raid warning, for the long awaited premiere of the patriotic film at the Leicester Square theatre. It is the first feature sponsored by the Ministry of Information. It pro- vides intimate glimpses of fighter con- trol centers, British bombers at Kiel, a balloon barrage and the like. Ralph Richardson and Merle Oberon are starred. It is not likely now that the Stock Exchange will move to Denham Studios, as was originally planned. Stockbrokers and others opposed the evacuation, considering it unlikely that members in any great numbers would be able to reach Denham. wartime circumstances. The question of train- ing women as projectionists is currently being explored and the prospect of Phoebe — or, maybe, Hecate — in the wartime booth is not far distant. The drainage, however, is at present keeper than the supply. Though the product shortage is potential rather than immediately actual, its mark is al- ready apparent on the exhibitors' business. The complications of the Quota situation and the likelihood that film supplies from Hollywood will be restricted either voluntarily or invol- untarily, are causes of no small concern for the future. The present itself offers a product problem to many exhibitors, thanks to the release tangle following the interruption of opening, and to the chaos which admittedly exists in some quar- ters, and is likely to happen anywhere on the slightest provocation as a result of the transport tangle. Many Transport Complaints Though a new transport organization exists in skeleton form, with pooled resources, clear- ing houses and dumps outside the larger towns, results seem to have been far from satisfying. Complaints continue to be made in exhibitor circles all over the country that it is worse than difficult to get film supplies, that they arrive so late preliminary advertising is often impractic- able, that wrong programs go to the right the- atres and vice versa, and that copies arrive in deplorable condition. The complaints are, how- ever, incidental rather than general. Until experience has ta.ugl.it * the trade how to operate its new transpor t* fnachinery, until train schedules, currently drastically reduced, are established and stabilized, and road trans- port, at present virtually monopolized for war supplies, comes nearer normal, matters are not likely to reach no criticism stage. Over and above all this the general rise in the cost of living, the alarming increase in un- employment, the difficulty of obtaining supplies — other than films — and the effects of the black- out and war dislocation in general, have put up operating costs considerably. Bargain Prices Sought Meeting such situations CEA policy has been definitely and unequivocally against cheap prices or bargain matinees, formally made it a mat- ter of Association policy. In many cases ex- hibitors have refused to fall into line. Legislative pinpricks to which the exhibitor has had to subject himself include the need for special licenses for the sale of chocolate and sweetmeats — and others for the sale of other foods, new safety rules to cope with air raid conditions, staggered openings, the abolition of the football forecast pool, the restricted horse and greyhound racing, with restrictions on at- tendances, and the interruption of other forms of entertainment like boxing, wrestling and ice hockey, leave the picture house a clear field. Money is not yet circulating as it is likely to in the near future, when employment is stimu- lated and spending increased, as it was in 1914. During the last war it was between four and six months ere the West End houses in London began to boom, as boom they did for four years. Despite the blackout that process may yet repeat itself. Already in most towns, though some houses are feeling the breeze, the larger central cinemas are doing more than adequate business. The CEA will hold a special executive meet- ing Tuesday to discuss product shortage with particular reference to the possibility of coop- erative production and abolition of the six months booking period. Judge Halts RCA Suits Further stockholders' suits against RCA were stayed yesterday by New York su- preme court Judge Levy. The action was taken pending final determination of five consolidated suits which will be tried in the near future. The suits charge RCA of- ficers and directors with mismanagement and waste.

General Theatres and subsidiary com- panies, excluding Cinema Building Corpora- tion, J. M. Wall Machine Company, Inc., and Zephyr Shaver Corporation report con- solidated net profit, after provision for de- preciation and estimated federal income tax, for the three months ended September 30th, subject to year-end adjustments, of $154,347. This compares with a consolidated net profit of $218,524 for the corresponding period last year. The capital stock outstanding as of September 30th, was 597,397 shares. Consolidated Film Industries, Inc., and subsidiaries report consolidated net earnings for the nine months ended September 30th, after depreciation and normal federal taxes but before provision for surtax on undis- tributed profits, of $574,258, equal to $1.45 per share on 400,000 outstanding shares of $2 preferred stock. This compares with net earnings of $536,206, or $1.34 for the similar period in 1938. For the three months ended September 30th, net earnings, after depreciation and normal federal taxes but before provision for surtax on undistributed profits, were $218,140, equal, after provision of 50 cents per share, to 3J^ cents per share on 524,973 shares of common stock. This compares with $218,763 for the third quarter of 1938. A net loss of $138,402 for the nine months ended September 30th was announced this week by Heywood-Wakefield. This com- pares with a loss of $144,739 for the same period last year. However, sales were re- ported at 1 1 per cent in excess of those filled to September 30, 1938. UA Has 15 More Films for 1939-40 United Artists has 15 new productions to be released within the next few months, according to Murray Silver stone, chief of the company's operations. These, combined with the pictures already released, form the largest program since the company was formed 20 years ago by Mary Pickford, Charlie Chap- lin, Douglas Fairbanks and D. W. Griffith, said the company's statement. The pictures now in production are said to involve a $12,000,000 negative expenditure. The films ready for release are \"The House- keeper's Daughter,\" Hal Roach production starring Joan Bennett and Adolphe Menjou, and \"Over the Moon,\" Alexander Korda's color production starring Merle Oberon. The fol- lowing pictures are being edited : \"Thief of Bagdad,\" also produced by Korda and with Sabu and Conrad Veidt ; Samuel Goldwyn's \"Raffles.\" David Niven and Olivia de Havil- land; Walter Wanger's \"City for Sale,\" Pat O'Brien, Ruth Terry, Broderick Crawford and Edward Arnold, and Hal Roach's production of the John Steinbeck novel, \"Of Mice and Men,\" Burgess Meredith and Betty Field, di- rected by Lewis Milestone.

Radio City Completed Completion of the last building in the New York City Rockefeller Center \"Radio City\" development, home of many motion picture companies and of Quigley Publica- tions, was marked by special ceremonies this Wednesday, with a National Broadcasting Company Blue Network broadcast from 3 :30 to 4:30 P. M., and addresses by David Sar- noff, president of the Radio Corporation of America and chairman of the board of NBC ; John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who drove the final rivet; and Nelson Rockefeller, president of Rockefeller Center, Inc. November 4 , 1939 Stress on Quality Asked by Branch Ray Branch, president of the Michigan Allied, this week advised exhibitors to stop worrying about the war's effect on the mo- tion picture industry, about Governmental regulation, trade practices and all the other current scares, and to concentrate on ob- taining quality pictures from the producers. The title of his warning was \"Let's Do Something for the Box-office.\" Mr. Branch said \"quickies\" were driving more people than ever away from theatres ; that the combination of these and double, \"and even triple\" bills, were ruinous. \"Let's settle down to where we were a few years ago, and deliver something worth while to the public, and we won't be long in getting them back,\" he said. Mr. Branch criticized double bills as an opportunity for the public to compare good with bad pictures. He suggested that if production budgets must be cut, they should be cut by produc- tion of less pictures, and that if exhibitors must cut their rentals, they should cut them by running fewer pictures. AM PA Forum on Latin America American film companies must carefully regard Latin American character and in other ways revise their present methods of doing business below the Rio Grande, guest speakers were scheduled to tell members of the Associated Motion Picture Advertisers, at a special luncheon, Thursday, in New York City, arranged by the organization with the cooperation of Teatro al Dia, a Quigley Spanish-language publication. \"What Is Wrong With American Meth- ods in Latin America\" was to be the topic of the speakers, who were to be Nathan D. Golden, chief of the motion picture division of the United States Department of Com- merce; Rene Borgia, South American writer, director of features and producer of newsreels on that continent, and a former scenarist with Columbia Pictures ; Eddie Le Baron, president of Eduardo Le Baron Pro- ductions, producer of Spanish-language films ; and Robert Socas, South American newspaper man and film critic. \"Birth of a Nation\" Ruling \"The Birth of a Nation,\" David Wark Griffith's Civil War days epic, seems des- tined for temporary obscurity again, as the result of a victory won in New York Federal Court Tuesday by Thomas Dixon, author of \"The Clansman\" (from which the picture was made) and Epoch Producing Corpora- tion. Federal Judge Coxe ruled that the two plaintiffs were correct in their legal attempt to restrain Treo Film Exchange of New York, Major Film Exchange, Stone Film Library, Marion T. Stone, and David Soh- mer from exhibiting the film. During the lengthy trial, Skouras Theatres Corpora- tion, Esquire Amusement Corporation, and Max Cohen, other defendants, agreed to set- tle. Epoch claims exclusive distribution rights. November 4, 1939 MOTION PICTURE HERALD 27 CANADA WILL SIMPLIFY EXCHANGE; \"BLACKOUT\" PROBLEM IN MONTREAL Circuits Restrict New Construc- tion; Marquee Darkening in Test Undecided; Full Censor- ship Clamped on Broadcasting Canada at war gives virtually all motion picture news of the Dominion these days a strong war flavor, as these developments at- test: Wartime regulations on international ex- change are affecting all fields, importantly the motion picture business, with the result- ant confusion bringing promises this week of simplification. Canadian circuits have started curtailing- new theatre building. The list of motion picture military recruits and home service men is increasing. Announcement by police of \"blackouts\" for Montreal brings a new problem to ex- hibitors whose marquee lights have not been darkened in 25 years, since the last World War. Full wartime censorship was placed this week on Canadian broadcasting. Canadian theatres are turning to war shows for the Dominion's regiments. Distributors Awaiting Relief from Regulations Because of the confusion in international cur- rency transactions caused by its wartime regu- lations, the Foreign Exchange, Control Board of Canada has promised, in an official statement, to end protested \"red tape\" insofar as it affects the operations of Canadian companies which are subsidiary to parent firms in the United States and Great Britain. This move, which is of direct importance to Canadian film distributors, is expected to bring considerable relief to overworked office staffs of film and other companies, but the board will still require monthly returns on for- eign exchange involved in shipments between related companies and in payment of funds to home offices in another country. Foreign bank accounts are also to be permitted under license for those who already had such accounts for international trade. War Stops Building N. A. Taylor, general manager of Twentieth Century Theatres, Ontario circuit, with head- quarters at Toronto, has announced a cessation in theatre building activities because of the war, following completion of the Community theatre at Trenton, Ont, which opened Wed- nesday. Film Leaders in Service Paul Nathanson, vice-president of Empire- Universal Films, Ltd., and son of N. L. Nath- anson, president of Famous Players Canadian Corp., has joined the Canadian Officers Train- ing Corps. Gurston Allen, son of Jules Allen of Colum- bia Pictures of Canada, Ltd., and of Premier Theatres, Ltd., also has enlisted in the COTC. Other new enlistments of film men from the Toronto area include Gordon Snider of Asso- ciated Theatres, Ltd., who has joined the Royal Canadian Artillery; Andrew Sinclair of Em- pire-Universal, now with the Navy ; Allan Iron- side of Associated Screen News Ltd., who has joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, and Wm. WAR NEWS FROM PARIS The French motion picture indus- try has formed a special union com- mittee of workers to deal with the war situation. The aims of the new or- ganization are: The reopening of all theatres closed or taken over by the government ; A fight against limiting the num- ber of theatres; Organization of the film transport system; Local censorship, and, Organization of motion picture pro- duction during war. The French trade publication, La Cinematographic Francaise, in Paris, calls on non-mobilized theatre men and the wives of those who are under arms to reopen their theatres to the public and have continuous perform- ances. Theatre operators are urged to keep their usual distributor connec- tions and change their programs as often as transportation facilities make film available. It was said that many old pictures in the exchanges would be well received. Keeping theatres open was considered not only the first social obligation of film men but also the best commercial step possible.

Montreal Owners Look To \"Blackouts\" by COLIN R. HAWORTH in Montreal With air raid precautions, including \"black- outs,\" definitely on the winter schedule for Mon- treal, exhibitors are beginning to wonder just what effect the \"lights out\" orders will have on their business. Police have announced that in the near fu- ture, probably in December, Montreal will be plunged into darkness in a trial blackout as precaution against any possibility of German bombing attacks. The consensus is that it will make for a bad time. Crowds will probably desert the the- atres on the trial night in hope of \"seeing\" the blackout, though advance warnings of po- lice have ordered the public to avoid crowding the streets. Another possibility is that police may order as many persons as possible to \"spend the night at home\" to avoid congestion of thor- oughfares. One worry that recently has beset exhibitors is the suggestion made by police that all illumi- nating advertising signs — and this may mean all theatre marquees — be darkened at night for the duration of the war. Police have ex- plained that many of the overnight advertising signs of the downtown sector are controlled from their immediate location and that the own- * er, living in a suburb, would be unable to turn them off quickly enough in the event of air raid warning. To overcome this, Police Direc- tor Fernand Dufresne has expressed the opin- ion that they should not be left on. If this ruling, however, is not to apply to such signs as can be readily turned off, such as theatre marquees, the exhibitors might gain in adver- tising value by a lack of other signs. Orders by police to persons \"on the street when raid warning is sounded\" are that they take shelter in the nearest open building, church or other edifice. Exhibitors see possibility of this bringing hundreds of non-paying \"raid refugees\" surging into theatres downtown in the rush. Canada's Radio Censored Censorship regulation and other wartime re- strictions have been imposed upon the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a result of war conditions. This announcement was made by L. W. Brockington, chairman of the BBC governors' board, following a meeting with Transport Minister Howe, at Montreal. CBC governors will continue in control of broadcasting developments and radio policy, however, Mr. Brockington said. Vancouver Starts Shows for Soldiers by E. S. ROBERTS in Vancouver The Strand, Famous Players downtown house in Vancouver, was the first motion picture house to give over an evening for a regimental benefit concert in the current war. The First Anti-Aircraft Regiment produced \"Shellzapoppin \" for one night to a crowded house. It was complete with a 2,000-pound gunners' chorus in feminine attire, female im- personators, and all the trimmings of old war- time concert parties. To Manager Norm Duncan of the Strand goes the credit of breaking all house records through promotion of \"U-Boat 29.\" Playing at the Strand a month after the outbreak of the war there was more than ordinary interest. Projectionist Ruling Good news for the small theatres of British Columbia came when the provincial govern- ment removed the two-operators regulation. Now, theatres which are open to the public 40 hours per week or less are only required to employ one projectionist. This is a new move in a long-standing con- troversy between theatre owners and projec- tionists. The previous regulation obtained by the operators' union required that two operators be employed in the projection booth at all times, wherever there were two or more machines. Projectionists Union Local 348 will fight the new order, F. C. Graham,- business manager, stated. It will mean that 118 union men will be put out of work with a loss of about $195,000 in wages each year, he stated. Mr. Graham claimed that the two-operator rule had reduced fires to a minimum, that with the present high-intensity lamps in use there is a definite fire hazard. In Vancouver 23 suburban theatres operating evenings and holiday matinees are affected by the new order, as well as a large number of houses in smaller towns throughout the prov- ince.
