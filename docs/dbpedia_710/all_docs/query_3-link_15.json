LETTERS Under The Influence Online Access To Music Can Help Fuel Creativity And Innovation BY STEVE PURDHAM For years, the debate over the Inter- net's impact on the niusic induslr>' has centered on piracy, which has put a siz- able dent in the wallets of artists and labels alike. But Duran Duran bassist John Taylor recently shifted the discussion to a new area, arguing that the Web is hurting artis- tic creativity. In a speech delivered at UCLA in Oc- tober. Taylor asserted that online plat- forms like YouTube and Tv^'itter were mining music, suggesting that the un- precedented access to musical influences stretching back decades is having a neg- ative impact on the creativity of modem- day artists. By being influenced by music from the past, Taylor seemed to argue, aspiring musicians will dilute innovation. He also maintained that consumers, able to hear the music of their heroes at any opportu- nity, will quickly tire of it — negatively af- fecting the longevity of music. All of this is patently untrue and quite the opposite lo what wc are trying to achieve ai wc7. a streaming music serv- ice that provides consumers with legal access to millions of tracks. Modern-day music is a patchwork of innucnccs from previous genres. Such tracks as Procol Harum s \"Whiter Shade of Pale\" demonstrate this explicitly. The track has an organ line influenced by |o- hann Sebastian Bach. Far from under- mining the power of the piece, the Bach-influenced organ line made the song one of the enduring musical clas- sics of the '60s. Similarly, the Last Shadow Puppets, a side project of Arc- tic Monkeys fronlman Alex Turner, re- leased a debut album last year that referenced the music of '60s stars Scott Walker and David Bowie and was met with critical acclaim. llie online arena is a vital stepping- stone for any artist trying to find an au- dience. Scottish singer/songwriter Sandi FOR THE RECORD ■ Universal Music Publishing Group became the vtrorldwide ad- ministrator for the Warner Bros. Entertainment music catalog in 2009. A story in the Nov. 21 issue was incorrect on this point. The story also misspelled the name of Rondor Music Publishing. ■ John Mayer's musical direc- tor is Steve Jordan. A story in the Nov, 21 issue was incorrect on this point. NOVEMBER 28. 2009 Thom famously drew thousands of on- line fans to concerts streamed from her kitchen, which led lo a record deal with RCA and an international No. 1 hit. \"1 Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair).\" Similarly. Lily Allen started with a My- Space profile and an audience of tens of thousands before she signed with EMI imprint Regal Recordings and produced two hit albums and a slew of top-ranking singles. Without the channels now af- forded to unsigned artists, would these two have made it? Possibly, but it's far from being a likelihood. Innovation isn't stifled by access lo music. Ifanytliing, great new music often emerges from the ashes of previous mu- sical movements. Punk was a direct reac- tion to the music that preceded it. in the same way that Brit pop paid homage to the songs of the '60s and '705. The sug- gestion that consumers become tired of their favorite artists through overexpo- sure can easily be challenged by looking at the recent U.K. download and we? streaming charts, where long-established acts like Fleetwood Mac. )ourney and Shirley Bassey all made an appearance. In terms of the dues owed to online music by established artists, there's now an argument that the reason there are such premiums for tour tickets, long after an act's records have gone out of production and the original fans have developed families and expanding waist- lines, is because their music remains rel- cvant and accessible through online channels. U.K. music festivals arc now awash with veterans of the 'GOs and 70s. because music fans in their teens and 20s are not only aware of Neil Young. Bruce Springsteen and Tom )ones but have downloaded their music and know the words too. It's a situation that was unthinkable a decade ago. A key factor in the latter-day relevance of new acts is the ability to find, discover and share music online. When a fan dis- covers the original recording of Leonard Cohen's \" Hallelujah.\" it's a personal rev- elation. When that fan can share it across social networks and on his or herblog, it can be the catalyst for a revolution. Streaming is increasingly used as a means to preview tracks, letting consumers sam- ple and explore a wide variet>' of music — which can only be a positive for all artists, especially those not promoted through mainstream channels. Ultimately, music couldn't evolve with- out artists having access to new influences and audiences. Our aim is to provide sus- tainable access to every great track de- manded by consumers. • • Steiv Purdham is co-founder /CEO of U.K. music streaming sen'ice wc7.

BY ED CHRISTMANj FACETHE MUSIC EMI's Fate Hangs In The Balance As Owner Terra Firma Tries To Address Debt Terra Firma s recent ofTer lo inject £\\ bil- lion ($1.7 billion} into EMI Group was a bold move by tJie U.K. private-equity firm to shore up its investment in the strug- gling major label. But the outcome of this latest maneu- ver could be that the firm shares owner- ship of EM I with creditor Citigroup or is {breed out altogetlier. And llial, in turn, could have implications lor a prospec- tive and long-speculated tie-up with Warner Music Group (WMG). Neither Terra Firma nor Citigroup would confirm media reports that the former's o(Ter was made in hopes thai Citigroup would forgive a commensu- rate portion ofTcrra Firma's £1.1 billion {$4.5 billion) loan to buy EMI. Of course. Citigroup isn'l about to forgive any debt, because the Terra Firma cash injection wouldn't give it any more up- side than it has now. Right now. it's out /'2.7 bil- lion, and even if an equity in- jection by Terra Firma could eliminate EMI's worries, all il would do for Citi- group is push oflUiose worries Luilil 2015. That's when FMI balloon payments come due on Terra Firma's two term loans: £\\.S billion ($2.5 billion) for the bridge loan since converted into a term loan against EM I's healtliy music publisliing business and £\\ . 1 billion ($1.8 billion) for Ihe term loan against recorded music and music publishing, according to Terra Firma s financial report for the fiscal year ended March 31.2008. So what was Terra Firma chairman Guy Hands thinking? Hands maybe banking on the fact tlial Citigroup has al- most certainly already written down llic value of the EMI loan and that il was a recipient of the U.S. government's Troubled Asset Relief Program ^ h;)iIout money. The only way Citigroup is Ukcly lo forgive any of \"terra Firma's debt is if il gels equity in EMI. In fact. Citigroup did such a deal earlier this year with Source Interlink, the parent of music wholesaler Alliance EnlerlainmenL After Source In- terlink filed for a prepackaged Chapter 1 1 bankruptcy earlier this year its equity own- ers were forced out and replaced by a bank- ing consortium led by Citigroup and ].V. Morgan, which agreed to covert nearly $1 billion in debt into equity, leaving the wholesaler witli a much cleaner balance sheet and mucli lower interest payments. Could the same scenario play out be- tween Terra Firma and Citigroup? If the two sides were to Viold talks on a debt-for- equity swap. Terra Firma would try to keep as much equity as possible, while Citigroup would Ukcly push for a Source Interlink-like conclusion. Since the debt is divided almost equally between rccorded-music and publishing assets, the talks also could center on whether Citigroup gets control of one of the as- sets in cxdiangc for a debl-lo-equity swap. An alternative scenario is that the two sides begin playing a waiting game. Citi- group might simply sitback to see ifTerra Firma defaults on its loans. whileTerra Fimia bank.s on revived revenue growth at EM 1 and an improved global economy with more abundant credit that would allow for a more favorable environment for restructuring debt. But if it is a waiting game. Citigroup may have to make itself comfortable. EMI officials are privately saying that the company's performance is improv- ing. EMI Group's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amor- tization grew to more than £200 mil- lion ($333.3 million) during tJie fiscal year ended March 31 . up from EB ITDA of jf 163 million ($271 .6 million) in the previous fiscal year. Moreover, while Terra Firma has had to periodically inject equity into EMI to remain compliant with its covenant-Ughl loans, sources suggest EMI's recently improved performance thanks to cost cutting and rccorded-music sales buoyed by the label's reissue of the Beatles cat- alog has negated the need for additional equity in this quarter or Ihe next. What does all of this mean for a po- tential merger between EM I and WMG? Until WMG pays off its nearly $2binion in debt or unless EMI's debt issues are resolved, the deal won t happen. WMG recently issued nearly $1 . 1 mil- lion in notes, due |une 1 5, 2016. to replace bankdebt. which give die major more Qex- ibility wi tli less onerous financial covenants on its loan.'i. But it still leave.'; the company with the same amount of debt. Nonetheless, if EMI's debt is elimi- nated through a Citigroup takeover, the label could remain independent or con- sidera mergerwith WMC. Wamerwould have the inside track on any pairing with EM I because the two larger majors. Uni- versal Music Croup and Sony Music En- tertainment, would face tough antitrust questions if they tried lo acquire EMI. WMC. which says it declines lo com- ment on nimor or speculation, would also have an advantage over other poten- tial non -major-label EMI bidders because it could gain the most economies of scale by doing the deal. .biz MOBILE: For 24/7 n«ws and analy- sis on your cell phone or mobile devlc9, go to: moblls.blllboard.blz.

Among those trying to create paid-content mod- els is Steve Brill, co-foimder of Journalism Online, which is assisting publishers in devising ways to charge readers for online content. Once more consumers start paying, advertisers will follow, Brill predicted, reasoning that advertisers are willing to pay more for paying users than free users. Time Inc.

As cable giant Comcast nears a deal to acquire NBC Universal. News Corp. president/COO Chase Carey said he doesn't think it will spur \"a hot period\" of mergers and acquisitions in the media industry. Carey said that after media companies endured \"a challenging time.\" there has been \"a little bit of pcnl-up activity.\" But he said he viewed other recent media deals, such as Disney's purchase of Marvel, as transactions \"driven by unique events.\" not the beginning of new media M&A boom. The most troubled companies at the moment? Radio, newspapers and local TV stations — all have experienced plummeting advertising and have yet to see their digital initiatives pay off, according to Royce YudkofF. co-founder/president of ABRY Part- ners, a private-equity fimi that specializes in media and communications investments. Yudkoff said areas of interest to investors at the moment are non-advertising-dependent companies, such as information and data distributors. CREATIVES NEED BIZ GROUNDING TOO Although best-known as a judge on \"Ameri- can Idol, \" Kara DioGuardi is also a hitmak- ing songwriter, an A&R executive at Warner Bros. Records and the co-owner/ co-founder of the music publishing com- pany Arthouse Entertainment. In a keynote interview wqth Billboard edi- torial director Bill Werde, DioGuardi explained how gaining an understanding of entertainment in- dustry economics, such as the value of owning copy- rights and running your own business, has helped her career. Working at Billboard from I99i to 1998 helped acquaint her with the music business before going out on her own . she said. \" I was educated about where revenue streams came from. Eventually I bet on my- self and I knew, unlike many artists who can't pay the rent, I'd make a living.\" While DioGuardi kept her pubhshing. she still had to share money with co-songwriters and pro- ducers, even though she was the one getting them the work. \"I thought to myself 'This is silly.' \" she said. So she launched Arthouse as an investment and to nurture young writers. DioGuardi eventually sold a minority interest in Arthouse to Bug Music, which gave her a part- ner with deep pockets and expertise in adminis- tering copyrights. Despite the industry's recent challenges, music is still in demand and publishing is the core of the industry. DioGuardi said, noting, \"It's always about the great songs.\" Addiiional reporting by £d Christman, Evan Lucy and Lucia Moses. HOME FRONT 360 DEGREES OF BILLBOARD LATIN MUSIC CONFERENCE HEADS TO PUERTO RICO The 2010 Billboard Latin Music Conference & Awards will take place in San Juan, Puerto Rico, marking the first time that the two events will be held outside the continental United States. The 21st annual awards show, presented by State Farm, will be broadcast live April 29 by NBC Universal's Telemundo network. The show will take place at the new, state-of-the-art Coliseo de Puerto Rico, under an agree- ment involving Telemundo, Billboard and the Puerto Rico Tourism Co. It will mark the first time that any major Latin music awards show has been held in Puerto Rico. The Latin Music Conference, widely recognized as the most important Latin music event in the world, will take place April 26-29 at the Conrad San Juan Condado Plaza. Billboard's move to Puerto Rico has been discussed for several years. The island is one of the hotbeds of Latin music: Of the 17 acts that have reached No. 1 on Bill- board's Top Latin Albums chart during the past 12 months, five hail from Puerto Rico and boast a large sales base in their home market. The Puerto Rican govern- ment sees the conference and awards as a major economic driver. Puerto Rico Tourism Co. director Jaime A. Lopez says the company will invest $2.2 million in the events, estimat- ing that they will generate as much as $12 million in revenue for local businesses. \"All the activities related to the event are expected to gen- erate 12,000 hotel nights to create a direct impact of $8.6 million, plus there will be a mul- tiplying effect that they will have in sales and other activi- ties.\" Lopez says. Billboard has been increas- ingly expanding into other territories. In October, BPP Promocoes e Publicacoes LTDA began publishing Bill- board Brazil, a monthly Por- tuguese-language magazine covering Latin America's largest music market. \"The move to Puerto Rico is a very exciting opportunity for Billboard, as it extends the in- creasing international pres- ence of the brand and allows us to expand the Billboard Latin Music Conference audi- ence,\" Billboard publisher Howard Appelbaum says. The move to Puerto Rico is also a homecoming of sorts for the show's longtime ex- ecutive producer, Tony Mo- Hola, San Juan: Telemundo president DON BROWN, Puerto Rico Tourism Co. executive director JAIME A.

Artists Start To Embrace Augmented Reality To Boost Fan Interaction Ask any label executive what new technology- excites them most and many of them will have the same, ready answer augmented reality. Simply put. augmented real- ity is the process of overlaying graphics, animation or other computer-generated images over a real-life video. A simple, early example of the technology is the first-down marker that sports broadcasters add to their live shots of football games. Tn the music industrv. it's taken the form of interactive music videos. Participating artists ask fans to visit their Website, where they can down- load and print out an image needed to launch the aug- mented reality application. Once held to the fan's webcam, the image launches a video player on the artist's site that will stream whatever footage the artis t has recorded into the scene captured by tfie webcam. For example, John Mayer used the technology for the on- line video of ihc song \"Heart- break Warfare,\" from his new album \"Battle Studies.\" Fans who download tlie \" Battle Stud- ies\" logo and hold ii to tlieir web- cam launch an Adobe Flash player that plays the music video with the fan's image added to the background as an extra. Sean Kingston did some- thing similar, allowing fans to film llieniselves dancing and/or singing his single \"Fire Burn- ing' while an animated Ur Sean character performed alongside them. Aussie rockers Lost Valentines assigned each band member a different logo so fans could choose which one they wanted to see in their music video and perform next to. And David Guetla used the technol- ogy to let fans discover an ex- clusive track from his \"One Love' album during a daylong series of online events as part of a 'One Day Online With David Guella' promotion. oilier acts have become in- volved tlu-ough the augmented reality campaigns of consumer product brands.

Users could move the bag around in front of the web- cam to change the position of the performance and add their own background to the scene. According to Mick Manage- ment marketing director Kris- tin Zovich. whose agency ran the |ohn Mayer augmented re- ality video campaign, fans are beginning to respond. \"We found a really positive reaction to it.\" she says. \"It's just a difrcrcnl way to deliver content to fans so it's not just 'click here and go to YouTube.' It's a little bit more creative. \" However, it will likely be some time before augmented reality videos become main- stream. For starters, it's still a clunk>' teclmology to use. Users need lo give permission for the artist's Web site to access their webcam, but even when they do. pop-up blockers and other security- technolog)' can inter- fere with the connection. In ad- dition, lighting issues and low webcam resolution often results in unrecognizable images. But the largest barrier is sim- ply the relative lack of webcams among potential users. Accord- ing to Parks Associates, only 18% of U.S. households with broadband Internet access owned a webcam as of April. Analyst firm Research and Mar- kets expects that figure will in- crease, forecasting the global market for webcams to increase from $1 .8 billion in 2008 to S J.2 billion by 201 S. ABl Research. meanwhile, points to the rapidly growing smart-phone market as hav- ing great potential for aug- mented reality applications, driving the global augmented reality-related revenue from S6 million in 2007 lo more than $350 miUion by 2014. \"I see il much more mobile- based, jusl because of the util- ity of the ability to j us t aim and gel information.\" ABI analyst Larry Fisher says. \"It's just eas- ier lo use.\" Fisher points lo such uses as aiming a phone's camera at buildings, businesses or points of interest lo launch an app thai will provide various types of ac- tionable infonnation aboul thai location on the phone's screen.

That could have a number of valuable applications for the music induslr)'. such as getting information ai concert venues or in retail stores. But no matter whether the augmented-reahty future is on desktop computers or mobile phones , those in the music in- dustry already dabbling in the technology foresee a long fu- ture ahead. \"There is some longevity lo this technology,\" Zovich says. \"I don't think by any means this is goingtobea flash in the pan.Tlib; will be something that will be- come more commonplace.\" • • I3ITS& BRIEFS MIXMATCHMUSIC UNVEILS DIY APP SERVICE MixMatchMusic introduced a new service called MobBase that helps artists create their own iPhone apps.

Or was it all a big \"sham,\" an extortion racket in which large cor- porations indiscriminately sued helpless de- fendants based on weak and unreliable e\\idence, hoping to force quick settlements? Industjy proponents and critics will be de- bating those questions for years. But for now, and much to the labels' relief, a federal court ruled recently that the labels didn't act improp- erly in filing more than 7.000 lawsuits against accused infringers, largely vindicating their controversial litigation taclics. The case in question started out routinely. As with all of their lawsuits, the labels first had to identify the proper target. They began only with an IP address and the Kazaa user ID \"gotenkito.\" detected by their Internet-trolling forensic investigators at MediaSentrj'. who spied this user \"sharing\" 1 .288 song files. The labels then sued the \" Doe\" assigned to that IP address and issued a subpoena to Veri- zon, thesubsaiber's Internet service provider (ISP), Ver- izon provided the subscriber's name, Tanya Andersen, and the labels filed a new lawsuit against her in her home state of Oregon. Unhke most de- fendants. Andersen didn't settle. The la- bels took depositions and examined her com- puter, but they couldn't tie her to the illegal downloading, so they dropped the case, llic judge, obviously miffed that the labels had put Andersen through the wringer but couldn't prove their claims, awarded her $103,175 in at- torneys' fees — one of only two cases in which the labels have had to make such payments. But Andersen wouldn't drop the matter. She sued the labels, the RlAAand MediaSentr)', al- leging a massive conspiracy to abuse the fed- eral courts by suing innocent individuals with no probable cause. And in a move thai consid- erably upped the ante by potentially subjecting the labels to millions of dollars in damages, she sought class action status, purporting to repre- sent all of those 'who were sued ... or were threatened with suit by [the major labels], for copyright infringement . . . who have not en- gaged in violation of copyright laws.\" Ander- sen's theory was that an 1 P address coupled with a folder \"sharing\" songs is insufficient evidence even to file a complaint, let alone prevail. In a maforvictorj'forthe labels, U.S. District Court |udge Anna Brown ruled Nov. 12 that even though they ultimately lost the case against Andersen, they had enough evidence at the out- set to bring it. T'he evidence gathered by the la- bels and MediaSentry \"was strong enough to Whet her or not one ajj^rees with the laljels' lej^al stralejjjy, copyright owners have every right to bring lawsuits in good faith based on the available rorensic evidence. support 'a chance' that the defendants had cor- rectly identified an individual engaged in wrong- ful activity, ■ she wrote. And more broadly. Brown observed in her 27-page order \"The court . . . concludes on this record that plalntiffhas not established defendants filed a series of law- suits based on a policy of iniriating legal pro- ceedings without regard to the merits,\" Andersen's case isn't entirely over. The court hasn't yet ruled on her claims that accuse the labels of confinuing to litigate her case even after the evidence demonstrated that they should have dropped it. And Andersen's motion to cer- tify the case as a class acfion remains pending, though last week's order, wliich rejected the theory' that filing a lawsuit based on 1 P addresses is improper, makes it considerably less likely that a court could identify the common legal is- sues that are a prerequisite for a class action. \"|udge Brown's ruling certainly vindicates our evidence-gathering process, finding it gave us the right to bring a case against Ms. Ander- sen.\" RIAA senior VP of fitigation and legal af- fairs Jennifer Pariser says. \"Since the only thing Ms. Andersen had in common with other defendants ac- cused of copyriglit in- fringement was the evidence-collection process, it makes sense that the class claims also should be dismissed.\" Andersen's attor- ney. Lory Lybcck. dis- agrees, saying that the labels' \"monu- mental abuse of the federal judiciary\" is still susceptible to a class action, citing survey evidence that he says in- dicates more than one-third of downloaders were too young oven to have their own ISP ac- coimt. Lybecksayshc is 'looking at all options,\" inchiding seeking other plaintiffs who w-ere al- legedly wrongfully accused and could act as class representatives. With fewer than 100 remaining pending law- suits. only a few of which are being activel>' liti- gated, the labels' campaign against individual infringers is winding down. But countersuits like Andersen's remain a danger. Luckily for the labels, Brown's ruling confirms what several other courts have aheady held: Whether or not one agrees with the labels' legal strategy, copy- right owners have every right to bring lawsuits in good faith based on the available forensic ev- idence, without facing massive liability should they happen, on rare occasion, to lose a case. • • • Ben Sheffher is a copyright attorney ivho has represented mo\\ne studios.

But a well-designed Web site offers almost limitless opportunities for fan interaction, communica- tion and monetization that social networks can't. Laura O'Connell, creative director at Web design firm Gupta Media— which has created Web sites and online content for Pink, Fall Out Boy and the Bonnaroo Music Festival— offers her advice on how to put together the right mix of style and substance to get the most out of your site. 1. FANS WANT MEANING, NOT MARKETING When creating a Web site you may have a cer- tain goal in mind (selling CDs or showcasing a new video), but you have to keep the artist and tlieir persona in the forefront. Whether it's through specialized font treatments, poignant imager)' or bare-bones acoustic videos, the site should embody the artist and their style. Diehard fans will get the CD or watch the video eventually. Your Web site is a chance to make a connection in a meaningful way with poten- tial new fans, so don't scare them off with an obvious sales pitch. 2. SHOWCASE YOUR CONTENT You've accomplished the hard task of getting someone to your site. Don't lose them by bury- ing your content under a confusing interface. If there is something you want your audience to know or see. put it out in the open. The top end of a Web page is the \"money area\" and that's where your best content should be. Having to click on a rocket that flies past the screen or even to a different page for a song sample is not good. TJiere are a lot of sites out there with fantastic content that never go viral because the right people never see it. 3. HAVE AN INCENTIVE If you want people to blog, tweet and other- wise talk about your site, they need to feel that it's worth sharing. Offer users something that's free or exclusive, but don't make them jump through hoops to get it. Asking for llieir e-mail is fine, but not the e-mails of five friends. There has to be a balance between what you give ver- sus what you're asking for in return. The pur- pose of the incentive is to start the conversation, not end it. Getting a free song or seeing the first cut of a video gets people talking, and more importantly, sharing. 4. STAY RELEVANT Most people use and experience the digital world as something that is timely, useful and personable. They are checking on what's hap- pening within their community on their local news site, what's happening within their in- dustry and interests on blogs and media sites and what's happening with their friends on Twitter and Facebook. Keep this in mind when you are creating your site. There's no point in revisiting a site that is static, so stay relevant for your audience by posting new content and infor- mation at least once a week, if not daily for more emerging acts. Let them know what's going on. and more im- portantly show them that they can come back for new and useful information. Additionally, give them the tools to update the site themselves. Embrace user-generated content. Make Twitter available on your site so Your Web site is a chance to make a connection in a nicanin^rul way w ith |)otcntial now fans, so don't scare Ihern off w ith an obvions sales pitch. your fans can Twitter for you. If a user missed a concert, let them see how fans from their area enjoyed it by letting fans upload photos to your site. Engage them by using the formats they use, 5. MAKE THE MOST OF FREE ASSETS Unless you're a wizard at search engine opti- mization, the odds are fans searching the Inter- net for information about you are landing on MySpace. Facebook or Wikipedia first. Make sure that these sites mimic what you are try- ing to do with your site. That means maintain- ing a consistent tone in your online presence in both design and mes- sage. When you post content to one, make sure it's available on all. or at least make it known on all that new content is available. The idea is to have all these onUne outlets working together rather than in- dependently. Fans will learn about artists in the most random of ways , so the more you can con- trol that experience and make it consistent, the faster people will understand what you're try- ing to convey. — Inicrvitiv by An/ofiy Bruno Get your message front and center with the Billboard Country Update* The Country Music Industry's Must-Have Source for Weekly News and Chart Info! \"Loved the first edition.

Apple's new 3GS iPhonehas been doing blockbuster business since its launch in |une, following a major i Phone marketing campaign that coincided with a rise in online music sales. Universal International Japan managing director Kimitaka Kato is convinced there is \"a correlation be- tween the iPhone boom this year and the rise in on- line music sales ...

Warner Music Japan's sales at iTunes \"liave definitely been increasing over the past few months.* label spokesman Tetsiiya Ikeda says. \"This is simultaneous with the iPhone boom in Japan.\" Apple declines to provide sales figures, but market research firm GfK identified the 32GB 3GS iPhone as Japan's top-selling mobile handsel during September. While GfK wouldn't divulge unit sales figures, Nobi Hayashi, author of the 2007 book \"iPhone Shock' (Nikkei Business Publishing) and widejy acknowledged as one of Japan's foremost Apple experts, estimates the model moved about 300.000 units in September. The rollout of iTunes and the iPlione has coincided with an increase in online music sales in Japan, ac- cording to sales data from the IF-PI, which classifies iTunes music sales as online sales rather than mobile. In 200-4, the year before iTunes arrived, ordine sales accounted for 4% of Japan's mobile-dominated digi- tal music market, with 507 milhon yen ($4.9 million at 2004 rates). By 2007. one year before the iPhonc s arrival, that figure had risen to 8% of digital sales, or 5.4 billion yen ($45.8 million at 2007 rales). In 2008. the year the first-generation iPhone 3G arrived, the online share rose to 10% of sales, or 8.5 billion yen ($82.1 million). Tlie market-share gains for online music sales came despite continued growth in mobile music sales during llie same period. But sales during the first six montlis of 2009 suggest a shift in market dynamics, with mo- bile sales declining 2% from the same period a year ear- lier to 39 billion yen ( $4 30 million) . wliile online sales rose 13% to4.6 biUion yen ($50.8 million), according to Ihe Recording Industry Assn. of Japan. RIAJ spokesman Masaki Suenaga downplays the sales impact of the iPhono. \"Consumers are buying Head lines; Japanese consumers awaiting the IPhone's arrival in 2008 spent days standing in line so they coutd be among the first to own the handset. full [digital! album releases with extras like photos,' he says. \"Tliis is the most important factor for the strength of online sales.\" But Hayashi says he sees a clear link between the iPhone and online music's rise. In addition to the suc- cessful launch of the 3GS model, the iPhone has also benefited from savvy marketing, he says. Mobile operator SoftBank, Apple's exclusive iPhone partner in Japan, launched an \"iPhonc for Everybody\" campaign in Pcbruary that ollcred monthly subscrip- tion rates that subsidized the cosl of the 8GB 3G iPhone, making die handset effectively free. The 32G B iPhone 3GS costs new SoftBank subscribers 960 yen ($10.61) per month for the handset on top of calling and data plan charges. \"The SoftBank 'iPhonc for Everybody' campaign started in l\"cbruar>', \" Hayashi says. 'and online music seems to have done well in the same lime.' Japan's Telecommunications Carriers Assn. re- ported that SoftBank had attracted the mosl new sub- scribers in September, adding 108.000. SoftBank ranked third in market share wilh 18%. or 21.3 mil- lion subscribers. Market leader NTT DoCoMo, which accounted for 50% of the market with 55.2 million subscribers, added only 66.000 new users in Septem- ber, according to the TCA.

Still, the iPhone and iTunes sales face growth chal- lenges. For example, the iPhone isn't compatible with leading Japanese digital music stores like Mora.)p, Morawin.j p and Music.jp. Also. Apple's tcclinical spec- ifications mean iPhone users can only access iTunes through a Wi-Fi network, which is problematic in a country where free Wi-Fi access is much rarer than in the United Slates or Europe. If the iPhone \"could access [iTunesJ through 3G. it would certainly have a great impact.\" Fukao says.

Along wilh the i Phone. \" ihey will increase the num- ber of music consumers and help increase downloads overall.\" predicts Nobuhiro Sato, president of Sony- owned mobile/online digital music retailer Label Gate, w^liich operates the Mora and Morawin sites. Sato says the popularit)' of the iPhone hasn't hurt the sites' sales. Label sources estimate lhat iTunes accounts for more than 50% of Japan's online music sales, with the Mora sites jointly accounting for up to 25% and smaller sites making up the remainder. The competitive position of the iPhone and iTunes is Ukely to strengthen in the coming months, amid speculation that Sony Music is nearing a deal with iTunes that will finally see its repertoire made avail- able at the online retailer. (Sony did not comment.) Others are already tailoring their digital marketing to reflect iTunes\" strength. Warner, for example, has introduced a range of exclmives ranging from bonus tracks, videos or photos for iTunes-only compilations to bulk-buy discounting. Increased iPhone-driven iTunes sales could also give international repertoire a much-needed boost in Japan, where it has been fading in recent years (Bill- board, April 4). According to Warner s ikeda. iTunes \"definitely moves more international repertoire com- pared to mobile music stores — and Warner's sales of international music have been increasing since this iPhone/iTunes boom has taken hold. \" •••• Cc.:; BY MARK WORDEN MILAN— Warring factions at Italian publishers and authors' society SIAE have called an un- easy truce after the re-election of president Giorgio Assumma— but members warn the so- ciety's financial performance must improve if the peace is to hold. While Assumma was re-elected unopposed at a Nov. 6 meeting in Rome of SI AE's 64-mem- ber representative assembly. 25 delegates ab- stained from voting. Two earlier attempts to confirm Assumma in the role, on June 23 and Oct. 27, both failed, with the earlier meeting marked by a mass walkout of delegates un- happy with both Assumma's presidency and the society's 2008 financial report. The assembly's \"La Nuova SIAE\" (The New SIAE) grouping— composed mainly of major publishers, prominent writers/composers and larger Independent publishers critical of As- summa's four-year tenure— says it dropped its opposition to his re-election in order to pre- vent a permanent split, which could have resulted in the so- ciety being placed under gov- ernment control. But La Nuova SIAE, which had the majority of assembly delegates at the 2007 elec- tions but has suffered a num- ber of defections since, insists Assumma and new director Which SIAE are you on? AFI's LEOPOLDOLOMBARDI(right) , and FEM's FILIPPO SUGAR ' CEASE FIRE Italian Collecting Society Stays United— For Now general Gaetano Blandini, elected by SIAE's nine-member governing council Oct. 26, must now put the society's financial af- fairs in order. \"Like any business, SIAE must increase its revenue and reduce its costs,\" says delegate Filippo Sugar, president of publishing group FEM and chairman/CEO of Milan-based Sugar Music, a leading indie label with a large pub- lishing catalog. \"We will offer our full coopera- tion in endeavoring to solve the society's problems.\" SIAE says it col- lected €671 million ($996.4 million) in 2008, with music accounting for €475 million ($705.3 million) of that figure. But, while total collections were up 5.7% from 2007 (music rose by 4.6%), the society still reported a pretax loss of €12.4 million ($18.4 million), although SIAE's accounts attribute this to the loss of €35.2 million ($52.3 million) stemming from the collapse of Lehman Brothers. SIAE was placed under government control for four years in 1999 after reporting a loss of 53 billion lira ($53 million at 1999 exchange rates). Members were also alarmed by a decline in collections from digital licensing to €5.1 million ($7.6 million) from €7.2 million ($10.7 million) in 2007. \"Most collecting societies redistribute royalties rapidly,\" says delegate Toni Verona, GM f Modena-based indie publisher/label Alabianca. \"But SIAE often keeps the money for as long as 16 months. The interest the money gathers by sitting in the bank is used to finance the so- ciety's considerable running costs.\" Verona also claims \"at least a third\" of SIAE's 85,000 members earn such minimal royalties that \"the money spent on administering their membership is greater than the amount they generate for the society.\" The Italian government must still confirm Assumma and Blandini's appointments. In the meantime, both have declined to talk to the media. Members of SIAE's other main faction, \"La SIAE di Tutti\" (SIAE for Everyone), which largely comprises smaller publishers and less- well-known writers/composers, insist the new management is well-qualified to address the problems. \"Assumma ts an excellent 'super partes' [im- partial] president with a good relationship with the political world,\" says delegate Leopold© Lombardi, president of independ- ent publishers' group AFl. \"We are confident Blandini will prove a capable manager.\" Lombardi and Verona both agree that one positive aspect of the dispute has been an in- crease in dialogue between the factions. \"We now have a relationship,\" Verona says, 'They, like us, now understand that if SIAE con- tinues like this, it will eventually become un- governable. Between now and the next SIAE elections in 2011, we must all work together to change things.\" •••• Here And Now New Services Simplify Direct-To-Consumer Sales The Indies At first, singer/songwriter Coffey Anderson jusl wanted a way to save his voice. ■* I was singing on the street in Santa Monica [Calif.I all day long, and while I'd sell a lot of CDs. I'd be hoarse.\" he says. Looking for another way to expand his audience, Anderson started post- ing videos online. He then started working with Ustream to hold live video chats with his audience, seeking their input as he worked out new tracks. But he still didn't have a quick niean.s lo sell them the tracks they'd watched him labor over. Anderson then discovered Audio- hfe. one of a growing number of di- rect-to-consumer sales tools. Working with Audiolife, Anderson was able to sell songs to fans directly on his Web site (icoffey.com) only minutes after they'd watched him record them. Now CORTNEY HARDING Anderson says that not only do his fans not have lo wait for a proper album release to buy his music, they can create customized versions of al- bums, select which version of a song they want to buy and even buy per- sonalized songs, which he sells for $19 a pop. Direct-lo-consumer sites are giv- ing independent artists and labels the opportu- nit>^ to fully control what they'll sell, and when. The technology also gives them the ability to collect information about who is buying the goods — information they don't get when their music is sold through Amazon or iTunes. \"The biggest value of selling direct- to-fan is that the artist or label get more data and more money,\" Echospin co- founder Jon Lowy says. \"The artist or label can also control the price and availability — if they want to sell a track for a limited time or at a certain price point, llieycan.\" SclUngdirect-to-consumer also al- lows an act to supcr-scr\\'c an existing fan base. 'I'or one of our bands. Kill Hannah, we sell everything from branded pillowcases to versions of the album with audio coinmentar).\" Orig- inal Signal Recordings head of digital Danny Da Sllva says. \"Of course, we also have them on iTunes and in stores, because they're still a growing act. and we need to make sure we en- able discovery.\" But selling direct-to-consumer doesn't have to stand apart from music discover)\" — and perhaps in the future, it will be able to enhance it. For in- stance, Audiolife CRO Brandon Hance says that while band-centered stores and affiliate stores might not exist in large numbers now. they could soon. For example, fans of Dirty Projectors could visit the band's store and not only buy its tracks, but albums by contemporaries in the Brooklyn music .scene like Grizzly Bear and Animal Collective. And while direct-to-fan commerce might have been dif6cult to enable in the past, a host of new companies is simplifying Ihe process. \"Tlie first time we did online stores for labels in the early part of the decade, we did about 15 or 20 and then pulled out, ' InSound founder Matt Wishnow says. \"The process was just too cumbersome. But more recently, we started getting re- quests to get back Into the business again, and I decided that we would only do it if we could build a platform that could launch an online store in a day. We did. and now we have another group of labels working with us.\" Wishnow says he's seen bands use the platform to do everything from throwing limited-time sales they pub- Ucize on Twitter to getting albums out quickly in response to leaks. \"There is almost no waiting with direcl-to-con- sumer sales,\" he says. \"From the fan perspective, ease of use is king,\" l.owy says. \"While there have always been low-tech ways to sell directly to fans, Echospin provides a platform that's as easy as iTunes for the consumer. If it's a painless process and the fan can just do everything on one page, they're much more likely to actually spend the money.'

NOVEMBER 2B, 2009 www.biHboard.biz I 13 iterial The Miracle Workers Latin Indie Publicists Are Now Expected To Work Magic In Many Different Areas Latin Notas Once upon a rime, a publicist's job definition was simple: send out press releases and coordi- nate interviews. But now. in ad- dition to getting ink, the role of the indie music publicist has grown and evolved to include strategy, marketing and spon- sorship coordination. Tliis is particularly true ofthe Latin music world, where print outlets have shuttered left and right, opportuni- ties are limited to begin with, and there are only a handful of national media outlets with vast reach. \"The publicist is now such a bigger part of the pie.\" says Xlmena Acosta. who calls herself an entertain- ment marketing consultant. \"It's hkf the marketing direc- tor and llie publicist have merged into otic.\" Acosla is one of many indie publicists or marketing con- sultants who have opened iheir own businesses in recent COBO years after working in a label. What they've all found is a marketplace rife with artists — signed and unsigned, maior and indie — that are willing to pay for services but not con- tent with a flack merely sending out a press release or getting a write-up. A few years ago, indie pub- licists were largely the realm of Latin artists who wanted to cross over into mainstream media. Today, with shrinking label staffs, hav- ing an indie publicist to complement label efforts is increasingly common, espe- cially as priority shifts from merely selling albums to cre- athig and exploiting an artist s brand, a task thai requires steady, long-term attention. \"Five years ago. the label would hire me and my role was to provide an added value, such as a review in the Dallas Morning News.\" says Mayna A fight over performance royalties has come to a head in Costa Rica, where the government has sided with the country's broadcasters and Is not enforcing a performance rights law for artists and labels. According to a declaration it made to the World Intellec- tual Property Organization, Costa Rica's government sard that as of Nov. 14, it would apply a performers' and pro- ducers' (meaning, labels') royalty only to broadcasts \"for commercial purposes,\" and not to \"traditional free, noninteractive over-the-air broadcasting.\" Songwriters aren't affected by exemption. The move has sparked an outcry from the local record- ing industry and the IFPI, which have been pushing for the ability of Costa Rican la- bels' group Fonotica to col- lect 1% of broadcasters' ad- vertising revenue for artists and labels. Artists' advo- cates say Costa Rica has been a party to international treaties governing such a right for almost 30 years. \"They're hurting their own artists, international artists, local producers, interna- tional producers.\" says Raul Vazquez. Latin America re- gional director for the IFPI. \"They're going against the tide of expanding rights for creators all over the world.

The publicist has to adapt to the speed of the news — not only blasting a press release, but putting the information up on Face- book, on Twitter, informing fans and being plugged into the pulse ofthe territory to keep the artist relevant.\" And while developing a press plan for. say, Alicia Keys is a publicist's dream, the real challenge lies in generating opportunities for developing acts.

Inspired by the fa mod songwriter rounds at Nashville's Bluebird Caf6, the New York Song- writers Circle has long provided a home for the city's local acoustic scene. The company's twice-monthly showcases at the Bitter End in Manhattan's Greenwich Village have featured an impressive roster of artists who've gone on to enjoy successful careers, including Norah Jones, Gavin DeGraw, Vanessa Carlton, Lisa Loeb and Jesse Harris. In recent years, the company has been expanding its ambitions, launching an annual songwriting contest, starting a monthly \"Loft Series\" of educational seminars and releas- ing a compilation album in November featuring some of the circle's most accomplished artists. It's also started songwriter circles in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Ange- les and is going international in February, with chapters in Milan and Hamburg. The company hosted the finale of its fourth annual songwriting contest Nov. 18-19 at the Bitter End, featuring performances by 12 finalists selected from more than 4,000 entries. Kate Voegele, the winner of the inaugural contest in 2006, has since secured an In- terscope deal and a recurring part on the CW network's \"One Tree Hill.\" This year's grand prize includes $10,000 cash, a Gibson guitar, an invitation to record with producer Glenn Barratt and to perform with John Oates of Hall & Gates, as welt as live perform- ance opportunities. Since 1991. the circle's director has been singer/songwriter Tina Shafer, whose songs have been recorded by artists like Celine Dion, Donna Summer and Bette Midler. In an interview with Billboard, Shafer talks about the circle's aims and its expanding artist- development efforts. How would you describe the fundamental purpose of the Songwriters Circle? I always believe what goes around comes around and that's one of the reasons why I believe the circle works. It s kind of a farmland to nourish and discover new talent. Ifs where all these people come to us and we Iry to find the right connections for ihem. We are much more interested in part- nering and servicing than we are in owning and taking. Can the Songwriters Circle format be applied to any genre of music, these inde- pendent organizations acting like mini A&R companies? I think that [scenario] is the fu- ture. I have a really small listen- ing team with people I really respect and love, and that is the innermost heart of our company because ifs really my ears and our decisions. And I'm .sure that could go across the board for any type of music. When I was a httle girl grow- ing up in the 'lOn. so much of music was produced and man- aged by people that were musi- cians. I'm a musician, and I'm a writer and an artist, and I gel what it is to be that, so 1 feci like 1 have this edge when 1 listen to people's art. The business got so thrown off the track — Ihey took it out of the hands of the artists and musi- cians and put it into business hands, and we were just like a Campbell's soup can. It wasn't about the music. What's coming back is un- derstanding what great content is. Absolutely. You take some of the lop producers — the Arif Mardins. the Russ Tilelmans — all ihese people really knew music. That kind of went by the wayside for many years and that's coming back, and I couldn't be happier. It's called the Songwriters Ctr- cle, but many writers who have come out of there have gone on to artist careers themselves. Do you focus on developing talent with the po- tential of becoming both writ- ers and artists? There are two tiers in Ihe com- pany. One tier is that every song that comes into the circle, I flag with my team if I love lhat song. It may nol make the top 12 for a contest or it may nol be the next Kate Voegele. but if the song is amazing. I will give it to our music supervisor and say, \"Hey. can you try this at 'One Tree I till' or whatever?\" What sort of stake does your organization have in the artists? We gel a fee that an agent would receive if we get a song placed in a film or TV [show] or an ad. just like anybody else. We're partner- ing — we're not taking publishing, we're not doing any of the old- school things. And then the sec- ond thing i.-^. for the [songwriting contest] winner, we have an 18- month period to try lo find them a proper home, either a publish- ing deal and/or a record deal — and that's it. So basically, we're asking them to trust us for a year- and-a-half to try and find them great homes. Singer/songwriter music seems to be more difficult to spread virally than other gen- res. Does the Internet facili- tate the success of certain types more than others? 1 wish 1 had a crystal ball. 1 can only say that I have found that if great content gets a chance to be heard, if il gets to be on a TV pro- gram, then I think that your chances are huge, that people will love you and will want to spread the word. I think being a singer/songwriter is probably more of an intellectual, cerebral- based genre. But look what happened to Norah lones. 1 remember her talking to me at the Bitter End. I was like. \"What are your fears.^ What are your fantasies? You just moved to New York. \" She's like, \"I just want lo own a VW Bug and sell 1 0.000 records and just do my jazz act.\" And I'm like, oh, my God, she got that tiines 500 tril- lion. So who knows? What kind of response have you had in other cities? It's been great in every city, but different. [In] Boston, we're part- nered with Berklee [College of Music], and it's all songwriters from the college, so that's been ex- plosive. it s always sold out. Cliicago is at Schuba's. the best club for that genre in Chicago. And the kids have nowhere to go. so they're excited. We're trying to give a home to a genre that hasn't had a home. The only one that's really dilferenl is L.A. — what they want to see are established hit writers, and maybe bring along one up-and-comer. so [it's] a little bit different balance than what I originally had. In Milan, we're opening in February, and that's going lo be established acts because the stars have never done anything like this. They're going to have cir- cles with their established talent. So ifs going to be a httle bit fla- vored according lo the state or the country. Why did you pick Italy for the international start? Well, il kind of picked me. This guy named Dado kept Facebook- ing me and sending me stuff and talking about how much he loved what we did, and I said, \"Well, hey, dude, you want to start a Facebook group there for us? And maybe we could get some talent to our contest.\" And then the next conversation was — he had a great manager — \"Well, what about us doing a circle here? Everybody would go crazy.\" They're over the moon about having a Songwrit- ers Circle there.

His worrv' is, ofcourse, all a joke, an act, a perfonnance. Because, true to his album title. Lambert is here for our entertainment. When \"American Idol\" launched in 2002. creator Simon Fuller must have dreamed of a contestant like the 27-year-old lambei i — one that mixes style andsubstance, one that can sing anything and gives a damn about cultivating his public image. In a year, Lamberts gone from being one of a herd of auditioners at the San Francisco trj'outs to landing the covers of Entertainment Weekly and Rolling Stone before his album was even released. For 19 Fntertainment, the eighth season of \"American Idol \" was something of an embarrassment of riches — the eventual win- ner, Kris Allen (see stoiy, page 20) has sold I.l million digital downloads ofliis \"Idol\" songs, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and contestant Allison Iraheta. with her preternaturally gravelly vocals and artful red and blue hair (see stor>'. page 1 9) is prepared to court the Hayley Wllliams/Avril l.avigne demographic. But in a year when the clubby stj'lings of Lady Gaga and the Black Eyed Peas are setting sales records, it's Lambert's slink)' set of dance songs that are poised to steal the spotlight. \"For Your Entertainment\" will be released Nov. 23; the title track lead single sold 18.000 in its first week of release, according to Sound- Scan, while \"Time for Miracles\" has sold 68,000 in three weeks. This comes on top of the 997.000 digital tracks sold of Lam- bert's songs from \"Idol.\" \"He's an artist with a true sense of who lie is.\" RCA Music Group GM/executive VP Tom Corson says, \"U's our job to work with him and presen t him with options to help steer the ship- but ultimately it s his call. He has a vision.\" EHTERTAINMENT'TONICHT The cover of \"For Your linlerlainmcnt\" shows Lambert as a three-dimensional version of Patrick Nagel's artwork for Duran Durans \"Rio\": all glam makeup and sharp angles. Its not sub- tle in any way — Lamberi is gleeful as he points out that he wore all that makeup — but ii's true to his image as a showman that combines singing talent with a theatrical bent. I fs an image he flaunted throughout \" Idol\" — and was never more exemplified than in Lambert's retort lo judge Simon Cow- ell's critique that one of his performances was too \"Rocky Hor- ror.\" ( '1 like Rock)' Horror,' ' Lambert patiently explained.) Bui it's rare tliat a persona crafted on \" idol\" doesn't go througli some sort of intensification as the performers transition from contestant lo professional: Texas cutic Kelly Clarkson took on a pop sheen: Carrie Underwood's counlr>- chops were honed on the show. For Lambert, he was \"Glambert\" from the start. \" I think there's a misconception — people think that ' Idol' is Uke a Svengah puppeteer.\" Lambert says. \"I think that maybe the perception because certain people that have gone through the system didn't have a strong idea of what they wanted to do visually. 1 think the minute you do. they respond to that. And I've been ver>' verbal and opinionated about what I want to cre- ate, and they've been nothing but supportive of that.\" When Lambert moved to Los Angeles from San Diego eight years ago and began working in theater and as a session singer, he quickly learned that business acumen was just as important as musical talent. At 27. he's in the upper age range of \"Idol\" contestants — the cutoff for the show is 28 — and the simple fact of his added life experience could ser\\'e him well as he transi- tions away from the spotlight that is built into the show. \"I do consider myself pari artist, part businessperson,\" Lam- bert says. \"! find marketing interesting. I find publicity inter- esting. I find the whole process interesting. I think there's some artists that are really focused on the music and the artistry, but I also think being a showman and being an entertainer is more than just being a musician. It's everything — it's something to look at and to listen to.\" Tlie songs on \" For Your Entertainment\" rely heavily on dance beats, but there are a number of ballads for contrast. \"When I We are the champions: ADAM LAMBERT Cleft) and KRIS ALLEN (right) perform with QUEEN during the 'American Idol' finale in May. was picking my singles, I thought maybe I should do more of a rock thing because that's what people expect. But if I did what people ex-pected of me, I don't think I would have gotten through 'Idol' the way i did,\" l^mbert says. \"It's part of my shtickas an artist to keep surprising people.\" One defining characieristic is the A-list writing and produc- tion credit throughout the album: ''Soaked.\" which Lambert says is about a one-night stand, was written by Muse's Matthew Bellamy and produced by Rob Cavallo. who worked on four tracks on the album; \"Strut\" was written by Lambert, \"Idol\" judge Kara DioGuardi and Greg Wells, who also produced; Ryan Tedder wrote and produced \"Sleepwalker\" alongside co- writers Aimee Mayo and Chris Lindsey. \"If an artist has tlie skills and ambition to write songs, then we will actively encourage and pursue tliis. often by pairing our artists with the world's very best songwriters. allowing them to learn and develop their writing skills.\" 19 Entertainment foundcr/CEO Simon Fuller says. AMERiaK IDOL BY THE NUMBERS It's a reality show that doubles as a 360-deal: Thanks to 19 Entertainment, contestants with the chops and audience popularity get record deals, a tour— and plenty of media exposure. —AD AMERICAN IDOL AVE RACE RATIHCi 30.6M 25.1 M The announcement of the pairing of lambert and Lady Gaga on the track \"Fever \" was fodder for gossip blogs. but Gaga doesn't actually perform on the track, Lambert says, explaining, \"She was on the other side of the glass just egging me on.\" The title track — which was produced by Dr. Luke, who co-wrote it with Claude Kelly — is now being worked to top 40 and hot AC radio. \"I wanted to release something that would be played in a dub. that would make you dance on New Year's,\" Lambert says. He means that fiterally — \"Dick Clark's Rockin' New Year's Eve With Ryan Seacrest\" is one of the TV appearances lined up for Lambert in the coming months; the campaign starts Nov. 22 with his show-closing performance at the American Music Awards. Besides the typical rounds of morning and late-night talk shows. Lambert will be interviewed as one of the \"Most Fascinating People\" of 2009. \"Adam is so telegenic. It's going to be a visual laundi.\" Corson says. A video for \"For Your Entertainment\" is forthcoming.

At this time in 2008, he was waiting for the Holl)■^^■ood elimination rounds of \"Idol\" tostart. In TV time, it takes six months for \"Idol\" to crown a winner, but the production process runs year-round. Despite the artifice of the show, it does drop-kick contestants into ihe media spotliyht — a valuable lesson for any pop star. \"They put you through it to see if you can hang. \" Lambert says. Tlie 2009 season of \"Idol\" attractedan averageof25.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen, the lowest average in several years: but it's still the most-watched show on TV, as it has been since 2004 (see chart, page 18). The finalewhere Allen was proclaimed the winner over Lambert was watched by 28.8 million viewers — 10 million more than the 2009 Grammy Awards. \"The finale of 'Idol' was pretty epic.\" Lambert says. \"I got up there and was singing with Queen and Kiss — I got to put on a costume. I really feel tJie finale summed up what I'm trying to do, and what I'm going to do. I think that being onstage with leg- endar)' people like that reminds you of what showmanship is.\" Weeks after the \"Idol\" season wrapped, the top 10 contest- ants embark on the Idols Live tour — a valedictory sprint of 52 cities in three months that grossed $30 million this year, ac- cording to Billboard Boxscore (see chart, page 18). Wliile group numbers are a standard part of the show, cacli high-finishing \"Idol\" contestant gets his or her chance to shine in a solo. Lambert did a medley of David Bowie's \"Life on Mars?.\" \"Fame\" and \"Let's Dance. He saw it as a chance to stage-test the sound he had in mind for his debut. \" 1 always wanted to do Bowie songs, and 1 never did tliem on Idol' because it wasn't ever the right fit.\" he says. \"We did a different, slightly modern production, which is basically what I'm doing on my album.\" And much like the TV show, the \"idol\" tour puts its partici- pants through the wringer. \"I've done (heater for years and I've sung for a long lime, but I've never done a solo set in concert night after night while (raveling, \" Lambert says. \"It was a good way to learn about how to take care of yourself and how to pace yourself while on the road.\" With the fame comes accompanying challenges: Lambert has become a favorite subject of the tabloids and paparazzi. \"Yeah, it's weird.\" he says. \"You know, it's Uke. 'Hi. I'm jusi walking to my car — why do you care?' \" It's ver>' likely that they care because of the wink-wink, nudge- nudge game that was played in the media about Lambert's sex- uality during his \"Idol \" tenure. Lambert demurred on the questions about whether he was gay until the Rolling Stone ar- ticle; since then he's unwittingly become Adam Lambert. Icon for Gay Youth. It's not a mantle he shoulders easily. '1 don't want to be a spokesperson for anybody, no matter who they are, \" he says. \"I'm not following this career path lo be a role model or to be a poster child for an)thing except for music. If there's an indirect impact that my presence has on certain issue, then I think that's a good thing.\" It's a mature point of \\iew to take as Lambert's private life becomes inextricably Unked to his pubUc persona. 1 1 s an issue that will get raised again and again — as he walked the red car- pet for \"2012.\" for example, he was asked if he brought a date. His laughing response? \"My date is my jacket, actually. ' A few days after the premiere. Lambert is sitting in Fuller's office, s wiveling back and forth in a white office chair as he pre- pares for another long day of media interviews. The movie, as it turned out. was a blast, and \"Time for Miracles\" was warmly received. \" People stayed and listened,\" he says, honestly happy. Of course they did. That's entertainment. • ■ • ■ RED HOT Season Eight's Punk Princess ALLISON IRAHETA Wants To Parlay Her Big Voice Into Hefty Sales It's a moment that Allison Iraheta isn't fond of recalling.
