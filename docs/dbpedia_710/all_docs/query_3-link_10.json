Any autograph item sold which is determined to be not authentic by two independent dealers or authenticators acceptable to both parties to the sale may be returned by the original buyer at any time for an immediate refund of the purchase price (only). Non-autograph items are guaranteed genuine for a period of twenty-one (21) days of receipt.

Items may also be returned if the catalog description differs significantly from the item's actual state; such returns must be made within three (3) days of pur- chaser's receipt of the lot(s). All returned lots must be in the same condition as shipped. All items are in very good condition unless stated otherwise. 1 7. Any lot containing five or more items is not subject to return for any reason. 1 8. We do not examine the condition of items contained within frames beyond what is readily visible. Such defects may include, but may not be limited to: mounting, silking, marginal damage, closed tears, \"mat burn\", etc. That being the case, we are not responsible for such hidden damage. Bidders are further advised that we are selling the autograph, not the frame, and therefore the condition of the frame shall not be considered reason for return. Shipping costs for framed items may vary greatly depending on the size and/or weight of the frame, and at times these charges may be quite substantial. Customers may request us to remove an autograph from its frame to reduce shipping charges. We will accommodate customers in that respect for an additional charge of $10.00 per framed item, but such service will be undertaken at our sole discretion. Alexander Historical Auctions will be responsible for any damage caused to the VISIBLE area of the item as it appears in the frame. We will in no way be responsible for any pre-existing hidden damage or defect, nor will we be re- sponsible for any damage caused by us to any previously hidden portion of the autograph, its mount, or any material matted with the autograph during removal from the frame. 19. Property purchased and paid for by successful bidders but remaining unclaimed after 1 20 days will be deemed abandoned and title will be ceded to Alexander Historical Auctions, LLC. 20. The placing of a bid shall constitute acceptance of the preceding terms and conditions of sale as well as the Bidding Procedure guidelines posted in this catalog. We are proud members of the PROFESSIONAL AUTOGRAPH DEALERS ASSOCIATION, THE MANUSCRIPT SOCIETY, THE EPHEMERA SOCEITY and the U.A.C.C. and adhere to their respective codes of ethics.

SIGNATURE: NAME: ADDRESS: CITY: STATE ZIP PHONE: FAX: LOT BID LOT BID LOT BID LOT BID A Message from the President August 2013 \"Where have you been?\" Seems I've heard that question a hundred times since our last auction. There's certainly been a lot of water under the bridge since then. As is the case with everyone, some- times urgent personal matters call for one's complete attention, at the cost of time devoted to business. I'm happy to report that that \"late unpleasantness\" is now behind us, and we're back on track and keenly looking forward to this sale. As many of you already know, we've left the cramped and crowded confines of the Northeast Corridor for our new location in historic Chesapeake City, Maryland, at the head of the beautiful Chesapeake Bay and only an hour or so from both Philadelphia and Baltimore. The entire region is steeped in history, from Elkton, where the British landed in 1777 to march (and take) Philadelphia, to scenic Georgetown, Fredericktown and Havre de Grace, destroyed by the British in the War of 1812. The county also served as a conduit for the Under- ground Railroad, and provided soldiers to both North and South during the Civil War. Now that it's a lot calmer here, we invite you to visit and perhaps indulge in a \"crab feast\", an outing you'll never forget. Accommoda- tions and dining are plentiful, and in all price ranges. Getting back to our sale, we have what I believe are some of the most enticing items we've ever offered. Lot 171, the Rudolf Hess archive, is particularly historic in that it is the first time that the full scope of Hess' \"peace negotiations\" and writings concerning his abortive 1941 mission have been made public. This is perhaps the most important World War II grouping ever to be offered. In Lot 627, we see John Hancock appoint Joseph Olney captain of the Cabot, an armed brig. Why is it important? While commanding the Cabot, Olney became the first American naval officer to fire upon an enemy vessel. I personally like the fact that this document came out of an attic near Detroit - if it could only speak! In an incredible expression of modesty, tinged perhaps with fear, in Lot 798 Frederick Douglass insists, as late as 1892 that blacks had not advanced as far enough from the level of slavery to earn the appellation \"famous\". And there are plenty of other gems as well, including \"hard\" items: Edo period samurai armor, several American World War II \"jump\" jackets, a battle flag from the USS BARB, rare Damascus steel daggers and swords, a letter from Winston Churchill sold with one of his cigars, and letters by Dashiell Hammett discussing his masterpiece, \"The Maltese Falcon\". And speaking of gems, there will be offered two long-lost pieces of exquisite jewelry once treasured by two of the world's worst criminals - Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goring. Hitler's prized ruby swastika ring, made by Germany's leading goldsmith, was often displayed by him to admir- ing sycophants, and Goring's bejeweled Reichsjagermeister collar pin was so striking, he wore it for a Time Mag- azine cover photograph. These items, further testament to the excesses of the Third Reich, were recovered by American G.I.s at war's end and have never before been offered at auction. Needless to say, we have some catching-up to do. I apologize to you all for the delay in this sale, but promise you that what you see within these pages will more than thrill you! Our next sale is scheduled for December/January, and since we are now running \"leaner\", we have low- ered consignment rates across the board. Contact us soon for this sale which is already filling up. Thank you all for your continued support, business-wise and as friends. It has meant a lot to us! Basil A.

ADOLF HITLER (1889 - 1945) Fuhrer of Germany and Nazi Party leader, Hitler's bloody rise to power, his military seizure of most of Europe and North Africa and his genocidal racial policies culminated in suicide in his Berlin bunker as Russian troops approached. Very important signed document in which Hitler creates the Anti-Partisan Award in order to recognize those in the armed forces fighting in- creasingly fierce guerillas in German-occupied territories. The document is 2pp. legal folio on \"Der Fuhrer\" letterhead with blind-em- bossed national eagle and swastika, \"Fuhrer Headquarters\", Jan. 29, 1944. It reads in full: \"ORDER Regarding the institution of the Anti-Partisan Award of 30 January 1944 1.) In recognition of the enemy's employment of increasingly stricter organization and deploy- ment of Partisan warfare, I hereby institute the Anti-Partisan Award. 2.) The Anti-Partisan Award is a valor and service award. The be- stowal of the Anti-Partisan Award will follow three classes (Bronze, Silver, Cold). 3.) The Anti-Partisan Award will be worn on the left breast side of the service tunic. 4.) The recipient will receive an award document. 5.) Upon the death of the recipient, the Anti-Partisan Award shall remain the property of the surviving relatives, as a remembrance. 6.) The implementing rules will be established by the Re- ichsfuhrer-SS. Boldly signed with Hitler's late-war cramped signature. Light toned spot at bottom of first page, else very good. This is the first document we have ever seen in which Hitler creates an award - and this is one of the most notable of awards. Partisans or guerrilla fighters were active in almost every country Germany invaded during the war. Partisans became large and dangerous move- ments, requiring increasing German manpower and resources to resist them. The badge existed in three grades: bronze, for 20 combat days, silver, for 50 combat days, and gold, for 100 combat days against partisans. In the case of the Luftwaffe, \"days\" were counted as sorties. The design of the badge constituted a wreath with a sword in the center. The handle has a sun wheel swastika, which represents the Nordic and auxiliary forces. The sword plunged into the \"Hydra,\" a multi-headed sea serpent that represented the Partisans. The mythical Greek creature was almost impossible to destroy since its heads grew again if they were cut off: this shows an interesting parallel with the ever growing presence of partisan activities. Members of the Wehrmacht avoided wearing it, fearing retribution if cap- tured, while the Waffen SS men wore it with pride, claiming it was \"their\" badge. $5,000-7,000 5. ) Das 3andenkaai?f-,\\aztMchen verbleibi naoh Ablebfn des 3el1eiiencn sis ^Mnneningsstuck den H1nierbl1ebenen. 6. ) Die Curchflihrungsbestinniungen erliisst der Relchsfllhrer-tt. Live Auction - Part I - Tuesday, September 10, 2013 All lots fully illustrated on our website 2. KING GEORGE VI AND BERNARD LAW MONT- GOMERY Superb S.P., 9 3/4\" x 7 3/4\" b/w, a full- length view of British King GEORGE VI who signs \"George R.I.\" and British Field Marshal BERNARD LAW MONTGOMERY who signs \"B. L. Montgomery Field Marshal\", the pair seated before seven other British military officers, likely Monty's staff officers. At bot- tom Montgomery has added: \"Holland: Oct 1944\". Fine. Following the disastrous failure of Operation Market Garden only a few weeks earlier, Montgomery was obliged to embark upon a self-promotion cam- paign to restore his damaged credibility. Here, King George throws his weight behind Monty's efforts. $2,000-3,000 Mass murderer Heinrich Himmler sends his mistress \"a very special lovely kiss\" 3. HEINRICH HIMMLER (1900 - 1945) Hitler's Chief of the Gestapo placed in charge of security and responsible for the construction and operation of extermination camps. He chose suicide rather than face a hangman's noose at Nuremburg. Rare (and incredibly ironic) A.L.S. sent to his mistress and signed with an asterisk (*) as was his custom, lp. oblong 12mo., a 1940-41 postcard supporting the Volkshiftswerk, Friedrichs[?], Jan. 19, 1942. In part: \"...my dear [?] / can't write much to you right now, only a very, very dear greeting. You wrote to me so lovely, you are get- ting a very special lovely kiss. More tomorrow, With love!

Heydrich and Keitel discuss Abwehr chief Wilhelm Canaris 4. REINHARD HEYDRICH (1904 - 1942) \"The Hangman\", Nazi head of the dreaded SS and architect of the \"Final Solution\", his assassination in Prague caused a retribution of the destruction of Lidice and murder of many of its inhabitants. Fine content T.L.S. on his official letterhead, lp. large 4to., Berlin, Feb. 7, 1942 to Field Marshal WILHELM KEITEL concerning WILHELM CANARIS, head of the Abwehr and already under suspicion by Keitel and Himmler as having anti-Hitler sentiments, if not having even already been in contact with the British. Heydrich relates, in part: \"...As discussed over the telephone, I enclose a transcript of my handwritten letter to Canaris. As you can see, I strive to keep the negotiations objective and according to the directions of the Reichsfuhrer-SS. Keitel has heavily docketed the letter and initialed it \"K\" twice: \"In the meantime I spoke to the Reichsfuhrer SS...who will advise Heydrich to continue...\". The notorious Wannsee Conference was held only weeks earlier, and although Canaris was largely responsible for Heydrich's promotions from the Kriegsmarine, up, Heydrich was already warning his colleagues of Canaris' 'snooping'. Worthy of further research! $3,000-4,000 5. HERBERT BACKE (1896 - 1947) Reichsminister for Nutrition and Agriculture even- tually responsible for the deaths of millions of Russians as they were starved in order to supply the Wehrmacht and the German population. T.L.S. on official letterhead, lp. 4to., Berlin, Jan. 10, 1945 to Reichsmarshal Hermann Coring. In part: \"...for your birth- day my best wishes. ..may the new year of life bring the full success of your responsible task. ..be sure the German people will fulfill their duty to the nation in the hard year before us, and thereby promote victory!... \". Tipped to another sheet, very good. $250-350 Live Auction - Part I - Tuesday, September 10, 2013 All lots fully illustrated on our website 6. PIETRO BADOCLIO (1871 - 1956) Italian field marshal who conspired with King Victor Emmanuel to depose Mussolini, succeeded Mussolini as Premier and surrendered Italian forces to the Allies. Fine I.S.P., 9\" x 11 1/4\" b/w, a chest, up pose in uniform inscribed to a security officer, Tripoli, 1934. Toned area and a ding affect signature slightly, trimmed at top, still very good. $300-400 7. IVAN BACRAMYAN (1897 - 1982) Russian marshal, instrumental in the planning of two Soviet counter-offensives against the Ger- mans, including the major push made by Soviet forces during the battle of Moscow, and in the battle of Kursk, Type D.S. in pencil with multiple holograph corrections, 3pp. 4to., [n.p., n.d., ca. 1960], a biographical quation and answer corrected throughout by the great general who boldly signs at conclusion. Fine. $300-400 8. HARRY H. BANDHOLTZ (1864 - 1925) American major general of World War I, saved treasures at the Hungarian National Museum and was a U.S. military representative to Hungary. S.P. 8\" x 10\", a chest, up portrait in uniform signed with rank at bottom. Very good. $100-150 9. CUNTHER BLUMENTRITT (1892 - 1967) German general, instrumental in planning the German invasion of Poland and France, par- ticipated in Operation Barbarossa, and afterward bore a large part of the responsibility for planning the defense of the Atlantic Wall and Normandy. S.P. 4\" x 5 1/2\" b/w, a chest, up pose in uniform signed with rank in 1965. Fine. $150-200 10. CUNTHER BLUMENTRITT S.P. 2\" x 2\" b/w, a printed chest, up pose signed with rank in 1965. SOLD WITH: an A.L.S. lp. 12mo., 1965 giving the address of a colleague, with the transmittal envelope bearing his name in the return address. Two pieces. $150-200 11. KARL BODENSCHATZ (1890 - 1979) German Luftwaffe minister and previously a member of von Richthofen's \"Flying Circus\", also served as Hitler's adjutant. A.L.S., lp. large 4to., Erlangen, Nov. 15, 1970. A response to an inquiry, in part: \"...The signature on the document reads Jeschonnek. He was a Ceneraloberst and chief of the general staff of the Luftwaffe. Towards the end of the war he de- parted from life by his own free will. Dr. Critzbach, who lived here in Erlangen, passed away two years ago. I admire your great interest in the memories of our great army commanders...\".

Both the current requirements and proposed new requirements are indicated, and essentially the conditions are eased: the words \"can be awarded...\" are replaced with \"will be awarded...\", and generally it is recognized that smaller groups of combatants fighting under less supervision should be more easily rewarded for their bravery and not be obliged to face the enormous amount of bureau- cracy and paperwork previously required. Even those who had not previously been awarded Iron Crosses would become much more eligible for the Knight's Cross. At bottom, Burgdorf notes in his hand: \"Approved by the Fu h re r March 18, 1945...\", makes three minor holograph corrections, and signs, further ordering that this new stan- dard be properly distributed.

ADOLF EICHMANN COMMENTARY ON HIS DEATHS ENTENCE Startling typed manuscript, 5pp. legal folio, [Jerusalem, ca. Jun 7, 1962]. A week after the pronounce- ment of his death sentence and the drafting of a more- softly-worded statement concerning his fate, Eichmann issues this commentary, signed in type, with the excuse for his actions which he used throughout his defense: \"follow- ing orders\", and blaming others for his crimes. This historic document reads in part: It is over. I heard the verdict last week: Guilty. I know the sentence already: Death. And for this, my fate, I feel nothing. Nothing at all...l confess a moral guilt... I was a part of the inferno. But I will never con- fess to being more than a loyal obeyor of orders in a state where all values had been reversed. ..It was the Great Ones - Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich - who turned their backs on the crying of the people. ..No, I do not want a clergyman. ..They cannot send me to Hell because I am in Hell. ..I'm longing to be dead - the quicker the better...\". Eichmann describes his readiness to commit suicide should he have been recognized while in American custody, spec- ulates that a friend betrayed him to Mossad, and says that he hopes that he may meet him before he hangs. He states that all that matters to him at this point are his memoirs and his family. Ironically, he discusses the fact that his own children would never undertake a task without wondering if he would have asked them to do so. He writes: \"I like that. I am proud when they ask for my orders. That is the result of my care for them. ..I am only sorry that I cannot finish the job... I like it that this son of mine hides his feeling for his father... I wish, without hypocrisy, to apologise to the Jewish people for what they suffered in the years of the last Reich...\". Rusty staple marks, else very good to fine.

Until then, troops will stay in the city and announce this decision in appropriate form to the Danish Foreign Min- ister...\". Near fine.

WILHELM KEITEL Heavily annotated typed memo signed \"Keitel\" and also initialed, 2pp. large 4to., [Berlin], April 15, 1945, stamped \"Secret\", also signed by the memo's author, unidentified. The memo concerns the removal of \"K-Stoff, methyl chloroformate, which was used as a rocket fuel. Unfor- tunately, if the compound is burned, it releases phosgene, a deadly gas widely used in trench warfare during World War I. The memo mentions that the remove of the chemical cannot keep pace with the rapid advances of Allied forces. Warehouses are in the line of fire from both sides, and bombardment may cause release of gas affecting \"friend and foe\". He also states that K-Stoff will undoubtedly fall into the hands of the enemy, and the combination of these possibilities may give the Allies the opportunity to blame Germany for accumu- lating and using poison gas. In a worst case scenario, the Allies might choose to use their own gas and with their superior air strength the result would be \"disadvantageous to our warfare\". The author concludes that all K-Stoff reserves should be immediately segregated but in any event the Allied powers must be made aware of its presence and the Germans' intention not to use it for purposes of gas warfare. On the front of the report, Keitel writes notes that he had spoken with Hitler on April 16th and had acknowledged his question, and the difficult text may mention that Hitler ordered that a reserve of fuel be held. Ini- tialed by Keitel. On the verso, Keitel writes several paragraphs beneath the end of the report and signs \"Keitel\". He comments on several sections of the report, basically despairing of the situation. He states that it will be impossible to avoid having the deadly fuel in either side's line of fire, nor does he feel there will be any way to avoid the Allies' blaming Germany for starting the use of gas warfare. He also accepts the fact that the enemy may use gas to quickly end the war should phosgene gas escape. As to notifying the enemy of the existence and location of the fuel stockpiles, Keitel relates that Hitler had denied any such exchange of information. Kei- tel also refuses to permit the Foreign Office to initiate communications with the West (\"Nein! K.') and concludes: \"... it begs the question, how much does the enemy know regarding the locations of the K-Stoff warehouses. ..they already know.\". Surprising content considering that Hitler is believed to have foresworn all use of chemical weapons - he himself had been gassed during his service in World War I. $1,000-1,500 68.
