        "text": "The Malmstens programme changed Sebastián's life\n\nPeople around me said it was impossible. And my portfolio has to be the ugliest they'd seen. But I was accepted into the Malmstens cabinetmaking programme, on Lidingö.\n\nA teacher can choose to be committed\n\nWhat makes a really good teacher? Commitment and maybe the ability to get up early in the morning. When the first two award winners of Ingemars Lärarpris get together, the discussion ranges from teachers as role models to students who learn for life.\n\nMaster carpenter wins major teaching award\n\nHe has been a teacher almost all his life. Being engaged, caring about his students and showing what’s possible. These things are what motivates Leif Burman, second recipient of Ingemars Lärarpris, an award for excellence in teaching.\n\nMalmstens mirrors contrasts in central Stockholm\n\nA rare thing these days: a physical indoor event that is actually being held! The final-year students at Malmstens Linköping University have packed up their best work and taken it from the quiet Lidingö campus to Sergels torg in central Stockholm.\n\nSummer furniture from Malmstens\n\nThe joy of gymnastics, the opportunity to climb to the top and perch, or to gather in a group for quiet chat – all are inspiration for students of furniture design at Malmstens LiU. They plan to fill pop-up parks this summer with relaxation and joy.\n\nCompact living a la Malmstens\n\nStudents in the Furniture Design programme at Malmstens accepted the challenge of designing the interior of a young person’s apartment measuring 23 square metres. The result is a window seating, a rail system for wall storage and a room divider.\n\nFirst master’s graduates in design\n\nThe first year-group from the international master’s programme in design has graduated.“It suited me perfectly that the programme was new and a bit disorganised. I’ve benefited from everything in the master’s programme” Caspar Reuterswärd assures us.\n\nBringing 17th century technology to life\n\nShapes that we now may be able to make in 3D printers could be made by the most skilled 17th century craftsmen using lathes, chisels and knives, with the aid of ingenious machines.\n\nMalmstens makes global design contacts in Milan\n\nFor the first time since 2013, Malmstens Linköping University is exhibiting at Milan Design Week. In an old monastery in the city centre, ten new pieces highlight the students’ design and craft skills.\n\nMalmstens preparing to travel to Salone de Mobile in Milan\n\nThe international design and furnishing event Salone de Mobile is considered to be the most important of its type in the world. This year’s Malmstens Linköping University will be there. The students will exhibit innovative furniture for modern times.\n\nSoft gold enables connections between nerves and electronics\n\nGold does not readily lend itself to being turned into long, thin threads. But researchers at LiU have now managed to create gold nanowires and develop soft, stretchable electrodes that can be connected to the nervous system.\n\nOpening doors that should already be open\n\nThere are people in Sweden who have relevant skills but who are still an untapped resource in the labour market. Alumnus Farzad Golchin, CEO of recruitment company Novare Potential, wants to change this by opening doors that should already be open.\n\nExisting drug can repair ion channel linked to epilepsy\n\nMutated variants of a particular ion channel cause difficult-to-treat epilepsy. A study published in the journal Nature now shows that a commonly used anaesthetic drug, propofol, can restore the function of this ion channel.\n\nGame at work – for your health\n\nHumans are hunters and gatherers. But in today’s modern society, we are sitting more than ever, which is bad for our Stone Age body. Researchers Aseel and Erik Berglund want to change this with the help of computer games at work.\n\nWoody surfaces of trees remove methane from the atmosphere\n\nIt is well-known that trees help the climate by taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. But it is now clear that trees have another important role to play.\n\nLiU alumni help the industry save energy – and money\n\nHe left a high-paid job in the gas and oil industry in India for a master’s programme at LiU. Sajid Athikkay does not regret his U-turn. He now runs a company in Linköping that helps industries track and save energy.\n\nLiU involved in a megastudy on climate behaviour\n\nWhat is the best way to make people behave in a more climate-friendly way? Researchers at Linköping University and Karolinska Institutet have contributed to a worldwide study on this topic.\n\nNerve damage from cancer treatment can be predicted\n\nMany women treated for breast cancer using taxanes, a type of cytostatic drug, often experience side effects in the nervous system. Researchers at LiU have developed a tool that can predict the risk level for each individual.\n\nHer mission is difficult – but fun and achievable\n\nWe are in the midst of a tough transition towards more sustainable development. This requires innovation and knowledge, says Marie Trogstam, a LiU alumna who is now head of sustainability and infrastructure at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise.\n\nA liver biopsy may predict spread of pancreatic cancer\n\nMicroscopic changes in the liver can be used to predict spread of pancreatic cancer. The discovery may provide new ways of predicting the course of the disease and preventing pancreatic cancer from spreading to other organs.\n\nShe wants to make robots behave better\n\nResearcher Hannah Pelikan believes that we will see increased conflicts between humans and robots in the future. In her research, she films everyday encounters between humans and machines to see what happens.\n\nInternational collaboration lays the foundation for AI for materials\n\nAI is accelerating the development of new materials. Large-scale use and exchange of data on materials is facilitated by a broad international standard. A major international collaboration now presents an extended version of the OPTIMADE standard.\n\nFrom sketches to a robot with artificial intelligence\n\nHow do you develop a product with as little human involvement as possible? LiU students built a robot using generative artificial intelligence.\n\nMore effective cancer treatment with iontronic pump\n\nWhen low doses of cancer drugs are administered continuously near malignant brain tumours using so-called iontronic technology, cancer cell growth drastically decreases. This is demonstrated in experiments with bird embryos.\n\nElectronic medicine – at the intersection of technology and medicine\n\nSwedish researchers have developed a gel that can form a soft electrode capable of conducting electricity. In the long term, they aim to connect electronics to biological tissue, such as the brain.\n\nAgreement signed – supercomputer Arrhenius to Linköping\n\nThe hosting agreement between NAISS at LiU and EuroHPC JU has been signed. This means that LiU is now officially hosting the European supercomputer Arrhenius, which will become one of the world’s fastest computers.\n\nCancer survivors are at increased risk of disease throughout life\n\nA study, led by researchers at LiU and Region Östergötland, shows that cancer survivors are at greater risk for cardiovascular diseases, other cancers and other diagnoses later in life.\n\nPathway to a renewable and more democratic energy system\n\nThe EU requires member states to facilitate local renewable energy production through so-called energy communities. But in Sweden, the system is structured in a way that counteracts such solutions, conclude researchers from LiU.\n\nSimple methods made teachers better at teaching\n\nAll teachers improved their teaching considerably after receiving visits and feedback from experts on their performance during lessons. This is shown in a report from Linköping University that compiled observations from 30 compulsory schools.\n\nThey grow nose tissue in the lab\n\nLiU researchers are among the first in the world to have grown human nasal tissue from stem cells. It is used to study how different viruses infect the airways.\n\nWASP extended with a new initiative: AI for Science\n\nKnut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation grants SEK 70 million to WASP for a new initiative that promotes the uptake of AI based methodologies in academic research in Sweden.\n\nYour clothes will soon be extra muscles\n\nTextile muscles is a young research field. In the long run, the technology can be built into clothes that can give an extra boost during heavy lifting, give hugs at a distance and help the visually impaired navigate the urban environment.\n\n“The Swedish academic world is very unique”\n\nKeti Chukhrov has appreciated her year at LiU as the Tage Danielson visiting professor. She is impressed by the democratic organisation and the true spirit of assistance and collaboration at IKOS, LiU.\n\nSupercomputer Berzelius to be upgraded to double capacity\n\nThe supercomputer Berzelius is used for research in fields such as life sciences, machine learning and artificial intelligence. This autumn, it will be upgraded thanks to a donation of SEK 125 million from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.\n\nMaking remanufacturing profitable\n\nReturning end-of-life products to as-new condition is called remanufacturing. For more industrial companies to take an interest in it, remanufacturing needs to be economically viable. Johan Vogt Duberg has investigated how this can be accomplished.\n\nDisturbed blood flow can damage the aorta\n\nAbnormal blood flow in the aorta is linked to inflammation and breakdown of the vessel wall in conditions where the aorta is dilated. These findings by LiU researchers can contribute to better diagnosis.\n\nBarnafrid supports war-torn Ukraine\n\nThose working to help traumatised children in Ukraine are themselves in great need of support. Barnafrid at LiU, has been commissioned by the government to assist with working procedures and methods.\n\nHe heals skin and shares his knowledge\n\nAhmed Elserafy spends his days researching skin and stem cells and how they can be used in the treatment of burns and wounds that do not heal properly. Over the last few years, he has also written a popular science book – in Arabic.\n\nMajor AI investment - LiU contributes to competence programme\n\nMicrosoft is investing heavily in AI in Sweden, and Linköping University is contributing to the work of improving skills in the field.\n\nFrom the Campus of LiU to the ice fjords of Greenland\n\nAn adventurous exchange programme to icy Greenland might not be for everyone. But LiU student Filip Puljiz saw the opportunity of a lifetime. A scholarship through the Erasmus+ programme made it possible.\n\nRisky path to meeting climate targets for Stockholm\n\nStockholm aims to capture more carbon dioxide than is emitted by 2030.
