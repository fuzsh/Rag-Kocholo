        "text": "Freight train coming at you at full speed. Accurate description! Not only does cancer affect the person who has to physically go through the treatment, it also has a ripple affect on many around the patient. Whether it be family, children, employers or just the general public who stare at the sadness and pain behind someone's eyes, it puts undue pressure on the community. This is why research is so important. With new discoveries comes new hope, better treatments, less side effects and the possibility that patients can actually live better with cancer and defeat it, AND then go on to live the rest of their lives!! I work with a team of dedicated researchers at #ONJCRI , every single one of them living and breathing the will and passion to lessen the suffering. Reach out to me if you would like to know more about what we do and how YOU and your business can help fund vital research to defeat this beast. #giveback #corporatefundraising #giving #majorgifts #majorprojects #grantfunding #communityfundraising #sponsorshipopportunity #partnershipsmatter\n\nAccording to EU figures 78% of occupational cancers in member states are #asbestos related, while a 2018 study by the German Social Accident Insurance Institute, later published by the American Journal of Industrial Medicine in 2022 has shown locksmiths are the profession most at risk of an occupational asbestos related #cancer, the widespread use of asbestos in #fire resistant office #document, #data cabinets, safes and doors, which continued well into the late 1990s, the likely culprit. Despite this, not only has #Ireland’s regulator of locksmith services to the public, the Private Security Authority, refused to raise awareness of the potential of those services to release highly carcinogenic asbestos dust when working with such units, but as recently as November 2023, when a member of the public asked the PSA via LinkedIn “asbestos is dangerous and as far as I am aware has not been used in safe manufacturing for 40/50 years. If I am wrong, please let me know”, PSA CEO Paul Scallan replied, “Locksmiths may work on old safes\". The PSA Ireland has had data since 2019 showing asbestos was used in safe and office cabinets into the late 90s, and a copy of the German Social Accident Insurance Institute study showing locksmiths are most at risk, yet even when directly asked PSA CEO Paul Scallan would not share information that could prevent inadvertent exposure to the deadly #carcinogen. The idea that Ireland’s locksmith service regulator has encouraged the profession to “work on old safes” without asbestos awareness training, in the full knowledge of the proven risk and the documented consequences of such work, is frankly beyond belief. Prevention is always far better than cure.
