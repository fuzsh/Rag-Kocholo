        "text": "What exactly are the colors that represent positive energy? If you’re wondering this, then you’re in the right place!\n\nSelecting a color family is one of my all-time favorite things about design strategy. Of course, you want to choose colors you personally enjoy for your brand – but did you know that colors go waaaay past personal preferences? There’s a ton of psychology behind color selection, and I’m here to share some of it with you today.\n\nKeep reading to learn about colors that bring positive energy, so you can bring some positivity to your brand.\n\nWhy Choosing The Right Colors Is Essential\n\nColors evoke reactions in us and stir up specific feelings even when we’re not aware of them consciously. If you’ve been focusing solely on your messaging and content, it’s time to take this thing to another level because aesthetics have a lot to do with the way your brand is perceived.\n\nChoosing the right colors can give your brand a boost before you ever say a word.\n\nMy strategic design process always employs color psychology when building brands and design elements – and it’s actually one of my first steps (after the strategy, of course).\n\nI’ve seen it for myself – the right color can stir up the perfect emotion, send some serious nonverbal cues, and influence buyers! When you work with me, we’ll find out exactly who you are, what kind of brand you want to build, and what kind of customer you want to sell to – and I’ll build a brand that caters to that specific persona based on your brand archetypes.\n\nColors That Show Positive Energy\n\nSome businesses want their clients to feel calm and cozy, but today, we’re focusing on businesses that bring the hype. Positive energy, here we come!\n\nBrands that focus on good vibes and good times can use aesthetics, like fonts and colors, to bring the party and attract clients who also radiate hope and joy. Some of these positive energy colors include pink, yellow, and orange.\n\nPINK: Hope and Love\n\nPink is formed from a combination of red, white, and blue – and it pulls some key characteristics from all of these. Red, as we discussed in What Color Represents Strength, is full of passion and high energy, while blue contributes a kind of trustworthiness that inspires hope.\n\nAdd white to soften things out a bit, and you get pink, a color known for the softer side of love and romance, as well as all things fun, flirty, and feminine. Psychologically speaking, pink is an effective mood regulator, so adding it in the right proportions for your brand offers a calm but hopeful presence in your brand – a perfect color of positivity.\n\nYELLOW: Optimism and Happiness\n\nOf all the colors in the world, yellow wins the prize for “most noticeable to the human eye.” If you’re looking to turn heads and capture attention with a fun-loving brand and positive colors, yellow is a must-have in your color palette.\n\nYellow has been psychologically proven to boost energy, awareness, and even metabolism! It stimulates our creative process, which can help us get “unstuck” and make quick decisions. It’s a seriously powerful color when it comes to colors that represent positive energy.\n\nLike any color, though, yellow must be used correctly. Its brightness and boldness can cause eye fatigue and even mood agitation if it’s not broken up with complementary colors – turns out, there can be too much of a good thing! But when properly applied, yellow can symbolize happiness, creativity, and a bright future ahead.\n\nORANGE: Energy and Confidence\n\nOrange, a perfect blend of red and yellow, is cheerful – it brings an enthusiastic energy to every brand. Because of its boldness, you’ll see it prominently featured in the colors of many sports teams, as well as traffic signs and bold advertisements. It’s an eye-catcher every time!\n\nMany people associate orange with happy, cheerful things – think refreshing citrus or vivid sunsets. In the world of color psychology, we think of orange as a color that audiences have a “gut reaction” to, rather than an analytical one. This can be a plus or minus, just like any color. It all depends on the strategy employed by your designer!\n\nLet You & Your Colors Bring the Positivity!\n\nIf good energy is a cornerstone of your brand, which color aligns most with your vibe? Are you a bold, high-energy brand that inspires joy in others, or do you draw them in with your hopeful, loving presence?\n\nThere’s plenty of room for all three of these bright and fun colors to thrive in a brand, and there are strategic design choices that can show off your personality, no matter which colors you’re drawn to – so pick colors that feel right to you, and watch dream clients come knocking at your door."
