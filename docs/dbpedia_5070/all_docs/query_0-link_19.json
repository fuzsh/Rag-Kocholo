A link to the ticket Web site is also posted on Union Board's Facebook Fan page and Twitter page (unionboardiu). IU Bloomington was selected to host the Victoria's Secret 2009 PINK Nation Party during a nationwide online competition among five American universities. Indiana Memorial Union Board, VS PINK, Relevant Productions and the IU Auditorium are collaborating on the PINK Nation Party.\n\n\"As students stress out over midterms, Union Board decided to shake students out of their studying haze and blow off some midterm steam for free,\" said Union Board Concerts Director Caitlyn Kuhs. \"IU students deserve a break, and with the help of PINK, they can party with Girl Talk and Cobra Starship and support a local charity.\"\n\nThe theme for the event is \"B-Town Bash: Let Love Bloom,\" and the evening will feature Victoria's Secret PINK apparel, an opportunity to partake in an IU student-driven local philanthropic project, and the chance to buy PINK clothes sporting the IU logo. Royalty revenue generated from the sale of PINK's IU products -- online and in stores -- will directly support the university's academic scholarship programs and IU Athletics. Thus far, IU branded merchandise has been among the best performers.\n\n\"The Victoria's Secret PINK Nation Event, 'B-town Bash', will provide a great opportunity for our students, staff and fans to enjoy an evening of free music and games in Dunn Meadow, while supporting a worthy cause,\" said Valerie Gill, director of IU's Licensing and Trademarks. \"We are pleased with the recent success of Indiana licensed merchandise in the Victoria's Secret PINK Collegiate Collection. It is our hope that this partnership will continue to directly benefit the university's academic scholarship programs and athletics in the future.\"\n\nIU students will be collecting clothing and toiletry items for Bloomington's Middle Way House. The Middle Way House's goal is to create a community where individuals live free from violence and the threat of violence. More information about Middle Way House can be found at https://www.middlewayhouse.org/.\n\nThe Pop Up Shop will be selling the IU/PINK apparel from the Collegiate Collection as well as the PINK holiday collection at the event. In addition, a Limited Edition Tee for the event has been created, and 100 percent of the proceeds from this tee will be donated to Bloomington's Middle Way House.\n\nHOPE, a philanthropic program started by PINK, is on select university campuses that are included in the PINK Collegiate Collection. The HOPE Initiative focuses on women, children and education and is a way to give back to the local community. Each college has student representatives who help coordinate the philanthropic program with PINK.\n\nMary Deneen, a junior majoring in journalism with a minor in marketing is one of three IU students that are VS PINK campus representatives. Deneen will be at the \"B-Town Bash\" collecting clothing and toiletry donations for the Middle Way House. Deneen said that each person who makes a donation will receive a free gift (while supplies last).\n\n\"PINK is a brand that celebrates college women, and we want to support women in our community that are in need,\" Deneen said. \"Our mission is to address and make students aware that domestic violence is a prevalent issue. We hope students will donate toiletries or gently used clothes to Middle Way House.\"\n\nThe donation boxes will be at the \"B-Town Bash\" as well as at Plato's Closet, 1145 S. College Mall Road, and the Charity Fall Fashion Show that is taking placing in early November at IU Bloomington. PINK will sponsor the fashion show -- themed \"This is How I PINK.\" The show will highlight how girls on campus wear PINK clothing and also showcase the IU Pink Collegiate Clothing Line.\n\nIU students Alexa Altman and Lizzy Gerard are also working to coordinate PINK events at IU and will be assisting with the \"B-Town Bash\" and Charity Fall Fashion Show donation collections. Altman, a junior studying journalism, says she is enjoying her internship with VS PINK and is looking forward to the fall events that are scheduled.\n\n\"We want to make hope possible for those who have experienced tragedy, and bring light to the lives of those in need,\" Altman said. \"I think the HOPE wall is a really creative way to bring people together. We all need a little hope, and everyone can make a difference -- all it takes is a little effort.\"\n\nThe night will consist of two musical acts -- Cobra Starship and Girl Talk. Cobra Starship is an American pop band known for its hit single \"Good Girls Go Bad\" off the group's new album Hot Mess. Girl Talk is an American musician named Gregg Michael Gillis who specializes in combining two or more songs (mashup) and digital sampling. More information about Cobra Starship can be found at https://www.cobrastarship.com/. Learn more about Girl Talk at https://www.myspace.com/girltalk.\n\nIU's logo is new to the VS PINK line, which is a fully articulated lifestyle collection for young women. IU's logo was selected this past summer to become a part of the Victoria's Secret \"Class of 2009\" PINK Collegiate Collection.\n\nThe collection is available in 13 Victoria's Secret stores across the state as well as online. The IU PINK Collegiate Collection includes boyfriend pants, pullover hoodies and tees, ranging from $26.50 to $54.50. At this time, only two universities in the state -- IU and Purdue University -- are included in the PINK Collegiate Collection.\n\nPINK Nation is a free loyalty program to thank VS PINK's best customers by providing rewards, special content online, privileges and the opportunity to vote for the PINK Nation Event cities competition. More information can be found online at www.vsPINK.com.\n\nThe Indiana Memorial Union Board is IU's largest student programming organization and also serves as the governing body of the Indiana Memorial Union. Founded in 1909 by John Whittenberger, Union Board is currently celebrating its centennial year, a year marked by reverence for tradition and commitment for innovation. The Board is composed of 16 student directors, four non-student directors and student committee members. Union Board provides the IU Bloomington campus with an array of event and activities, including concerts, lectures, films, a campus arts magazine and more."
