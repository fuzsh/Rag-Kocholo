        "text": "A support group for women with hereditary cancer has launched Australia's cheapest private genetic test for identifying the BRCA gene mutation linked to breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nSince actress Angelina Jolie revealed her struggle with cancer in 2013, demand for services has surged, with long waiting lists and women who do not qualify under the public health system having to pay as much as $2,000 to be tested.\n\nPink Hope founder Krystal Barter hopes the new cheap test, which costs $200, will save lives.\n\n\"I never want to know that someone's feeling lost and unsure and doesn't have the financial stability to be able to potentially have a test that could save their lives and that of future generations to come,\" she said.\n\nUnable to find a cheap supplier in Australia, the group turned to Silicon Valley in the United States, where tests cost $400 dollars. Pink Hope will subsidise half the cost.\n\nThe saliva-based test is carried out by a GP and the results are returned in about four weeks.\n\nMs Barter hopes it will be a game changer for women slipping through the cracks.\n\n\"I think that this may be the change. And I'm so proud that the little charity that could is doing it,\" she said.\n\nFamily history inspiration for Pink Hope charity\n\nIt is a personal mission for Ms Barter, whose family has endured hereditary cancer. She has had surgery to have her breasts and an ovary removed.\n\n\"My nan died when I'd just got out of surgery and I was really, really close to her and she was the inspiration for everything that I did at Pink Hope,\" Ms Barter said.\n\nSydneysider Stacey Gadd also knows the pain of learning you carry the BRCA gene mutation.\n\n\"I wanted to get tested because my mum has had a significant journey with breast cancer,\" she said.\n\n\"She's faced it five times. Her first diagnosis was very young at 26, so I knew that was something I would potentially consider in my lifetime and I wanted as much information as I possibly could.\"\n\nAt just 22, Ms Gadd had surgery to have both her breasts removed.\n\n\"I was lucky I had a very smooth surgery experience, I didn't have any complications.\"\n\nGovernment needs to do more, says expert\n\nProfessor Geoff Lindeman, director at the Parkville Integrated Familial Cancer Centre, said the Pink Hope initiative was a worthy move but that more support needed to come from Government.\n\n\"I think one of the challenges here is that Pink Hope is offering to assist patients who have fallen just short of the testing guidelines and are in financial need, so they are going to help subsidise some of these tests. Now that is really helpful but that is essentially going to be for about 170 patients,\" he said.\n\n\"My back-of-the-envelope calculations are that there are about 25,000 gene carriers across the country, so what we really need is a truly coordinated effort with more resources put behind it from Government to help us implement this with meaningful outcomes.\""
