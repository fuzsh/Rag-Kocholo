The new release is packed full of so many fun new products and I love that they all can be mixed and matched to give you so many options.\n\nI started my card by making my card panel with the Layered Halloween Wreath stencil set. This is a set of three stencils that layer together to make a fun Halloween background. I used finger daubers and dye ink for my blending. Once my panel was finished I added a few splatters with a little black paint.\n\nNext, I used the Ghost Holder dies to die cut my ghost and treat bag. I filled the bag with a few candies that I die cut from the Spooky Mug Additions die set. The ghost fits perfectly in the center of the panel, though it will also be so cute to use as a Halloween tag or to tie onto a bag of treats! Lastly, I used the Halloween Corners set for my sentiment.\n\nPRIZES: be sure to leave comments on each stop.

Barbara here sharing a project I made using the new Big Halloween Cupcake die set. I was inspired by traditional Halloween colors for my palette.\n\nI began with a panel cut from white cardstock to fit a top folding A2 card base with a bit of a white border showing. I then inked the edges of that panel using distress ink and a blending tool. I wanted to create a fun background so using several of the candy corn images from the die set and randomly adhered them to the ink blended panel.\n\nNow I wanted to create a fun spooky cupcake, so I chose lots of images from the Big Halloween Cupcake die set. I used distress ink and a blending tool to color most of the pieces that I cut that I assembled. I used the small and smaller circle dies in the set to create eyeballs to add on top of the cupcake. So fun!!\n\nI cut out a couple of pumpkins that are also included in this amazing die set to sit next to my cupcake. I adhered the cupcake and pumpkins to a scalloped oval die that I cut from white cardstock to frame the cupcake with foam squares.\n\nI then stamped the “spooky” from the new Halloween Train stamp set and the Birthday Wishes using black ink. I used the sentiment and the coordinating die to cut it out. I then adhered it to the cupcake with liquid glue. I then centered the oval frame and added it to the inked candy corn background which I then adhered to the white card base.\n\nPRIZES: be sure to leave comments on each stop.

The New Halloween Release is here! It is Spooktacular! I’ll just tell you now, I love this Candy Bucket die set. Who am I kidding? I’m like a kid in a candy store, I can’t get enough because I love it all!\n\nI started off with the background using the new Halloween Words Stencil. Knowing I wanted to use the Distress Texture Black Opaque Paste. I found it easiest to grab a panel of pink card stock. Lightly ink blend black on the edges with remaining ink on your brush. Then add Mica spray Picked Raspberry and let dry. I then did the Black Opaque paste with the Halloween Words Stencil on the panel using a grip mat.\n\nThen die cut out the Candy Bucket with the window die from White card stock and White Foam. With the Candy bucket die cut a piece of acetate for the shaker window and one more white card stock for the back. Attach the layers, foam and acetate together then add the new Spooktacular Mix in the well and then attach the back. The lid has a lot of foam squares under it to make it flush. The handle is attached directly to the panel with liquid glue.\n\nThe ghost face is cut out of Black Glitter card stock. The candies are from the Ghost Holder die set. Using matching colored card stock and adding Star Dust Stickles to the candies.\n\nSentiment is from the Halloween Corners stamp set.

It’s Lauren and I am so excited to be sharing a sneak peek at two of the new stencils that will be released in a couple of days!\n\nNew release will be available August 12th\n\nFor my first card, I just had to use the Layered Halloween Wreath stencils! All of the adorable images just needed to be stenciled. I started with the (A) stencil and used purple, green and yellow inks, then the (B) stencil with orange and yellow inks, the (C) stencil with orange, black and green inks, and finally the (A) stencil again to add Frostbite Astro Paste to the tops of the candy corn and ghosts. I set it aside to dry and once it was dry, I trimmed it down to a 4×5.25” panel.\n\nWhile my background was drying, I stamped and embossed the Happy Halloween sentiment in white from the Halloween Corners stamp set and used the coordinating dies to cut it out. I also cut the Candy Bucket Dies in orange and black cardstock to make the classic Jack-o-Lantern Treat Bucket! I made it into a shaker with acetate and Classic Halloween Shaker Beads.\n\nI adhered the stenciled panel to a piece of black cardstock cut to A2 in size and adhered them to a card base. I adhered the Candy Bucket to the center of the card base and popped up the sentiment under the handle with foam adhesive. I just love this classic looking Halloween card!\n\nFor the second card, I really wanted to make a night scene with the Layered Birch Trees stencils. I stenciled the (A) layer with Picket Fence Distress Ink and then sprayed the whole panel with Iridescent Glitter Dust. When it was dry, I used the (B) stencil with Grrr! Lunar Paste to add in the tree details. I sent it aside to dry and once it was, I trimmed the panel to 4×5.25”.\n\nNext I stamped and colored in my images from the Batty About You stamp set with alcohol markers and used the coordinating dies to cut out the images. I also die cut the third Stitched Torn Rectangle from purple cardstock and stamped my Spooky Wishes sentiment from Upright Greetings: Halloween stamp set with black ink. I adhered the moon image to the purple rectangle and popped up the bat and branch with foam adhesive.\n\nI adhered the stenciled panel to an A2 card base and popped up the purple rectangle with the images to the center of the card with foam adhesive.\n\nI hope you enjoyed these card with two of the new stencils – you’re going to love all of them!\n\nHello crafty friends, Marine here! I’m happy to be sharing with you this extra fun and super colorful sneak peek featuring two brand new products from the upcoming August 2024 Release: Build A Monster and Candy Bucket. The Candy Bucket comes with different funny faces, including a monster face, which matches the monsters to perfection.\n\nNew release will be available August 12th\n\nI started off by cutting an 8,5 x 3,5 inches Strathmore bristol smooth slimline panel that I colored with bright colors in a rainbow order. I first created a light base with, from left to right, kitsch flamingo, dried marigold, squeezed lemonade, twisted citron, salvaged patina and shaded lilac oxide inks. Next I created a pattern on my panel, and thought that big dots would add more fun to the card, so I used the Medium Polka Dots stencil along with, from left to right, picked raspberry, carved pumpkin, fossilized amber, mowed lawn, peacock feathers and wilted violet to create a tone on tone look.\n\nI splattered water all over my panel, and dried it using a paper towel. For contrast, I mixed some black soot oxide ink with water and used a small brush to add more splatters, and for brightness I did the same with copic opaque white ink mixed with water.\n\nNext I cut all the bits and pieces out of different colored cardstock, and assembled everything on my panel using 1mm and 2mm foam squares, liquid glue and 3mm glue dots. I used all the Build A Monster dies to create my three little guys, used the bucket and monster face dies from Candy Bucket to create the bucket, and multiple Candy Treats dies to make all the yummy treats.\n\nI embossed my “Sending monster hugs” greeting from Monster Hugs in white, glued Onyx pearls on the monsters’ eyes, and Iridescent Mini Star Confetti here and there on the background, applied white blizzard nuvo drops to the monsters’ hearts and swirling icing, added a drop of glossy accent on the bucket’s eyes, and finally added highlights and details using a white gel pen.\n\nHere’s a look at some more of the new dies coming in this release…..\n\nAnd that’s it! I hope you like those cute and friendly little monsters! Thanks so much for stopping by!\n\nHi friends! It’s Dana here today and I am excited to be sharing a sneak peek of the fun new Batty About You stamp set along with the Upright Greetings: Halloween stamp set for the upcoming Halloween release.\n\nNew release will be available August 12th\n\nI began my first card by making my card panel with the Scattered Bats Stencil. I used white pigment ink for my blending and splattered the panel with a little white paint for added detail. Once my panel was dry I trimmed it down and attached it to an orange cardstock mat.\n\nNext, I stamped my bats with the Batty About You stamp set. I colored the bats orange with a few Copic markers and then used the Batty About You coordinating dies to cut them out. I die cut my circle with the Scallop Circle die and attached it to my panel. I then attached my bats with foam adhesive to add a little dimension.\n\nTo finish my card, I stamped my You’re Fang-tastic sentiment with the Batty About You stamp set. I then used the Upright Greetings: Halloween stamp set to stamp the Eek sentiment. Lastly, I used the Sentiment Strips dies to die cut my sentiments before attaching them to my card.\n\nFor my next card, I used the Upright Greetings: Halloween stamp set and my Misti to create my card panel. I placed the Batty For You stamp in my Misti and then moved my cardstock to the left on my grid paper to stamp my sentiment in a rainbow of colors.\n\nLastly, I used the Batty About You stamp set to stamp my bat. I colored the bat with Copic markers and then used the Batty About You coordinating dies to cut it out. Such a fun and easy card to create! I know you are going to love these fun new products.\n\nThanks for joining me today and I hope you enjoyed my cards. Make sure you stop back by tomorrow for another sneak peek!\n\nEnjoy your day, Dana\n\nHi Everyone! Carly here and I’m delighted to share a sneak peek of the new Halloween Train! I have been obsessed with PPP’s trains ever since the Valentine Train because they are not only adorable but so versatile! Let me show you what I mean…\n\nNew release will be available August 12th\n\nBlack & white images with a colorful sentiment is one of my favorite card designs for critter cards but it works for the new Halloween Train set too!\n\nI die cut the Spooky Wishes from a card panel and then stamped the train cars beneath it. I added “sending” from Sentiment Strips: Birthday and then adhered the panel to a folded card.\n\nI ink blended a scrap panel with Distress Oxide Dried Marigold & Kitsch Flamingo and then die cut Spooky Wishes again and inlaid the colorful one on the card.\n\nFor this next card I had fun stamping, die cutting and coloring a bunch of train cars.\n\nCopic colors: RV63, RV52, RV10, RV00, RV000, B00, B00, T4, T2, YR07, YR04 & E02.\n\nThen I stamped the sentiment and the train tracks on the front of a folded card. BTW, it’s easy to curve the train tracks on your acrylic block/stamping tool before stamping.\n\nI arranged the cars on the tracks (but didn’t adhere yet) and then positioned the link stamp, moved the cars out of the way and stamped the links on the card front. I also added a few bats and faux splatter with a pen.\n\nFinally I foam mounted the cars to card front and trimmed the bits that hung off the edge.\n\nAnd of course I couldn’t resist creating another treat train!\n\nIt’s really such an easy project and you can see the process in this video.\n\nCopic colors: B99, B97, B95, RV63, RV52, T4, T2, YR07, YR04 & E02.\n\nThanks so much for stopping by and don’t forget to mark your calendars for the release!\n\nHello crafty friends, Arsenia here! I’m super excited to share this fun sneak peek using Halloween Icons stamp set with coordinating dies and Halloween Corners stamp set with coordinating dies. The images are so cute from these sets! My favorite time of year is Fall and I adore all fall crafting, it’s the best! Let’s get started!\n\nNew release will be available August 12th\n\nFirst, I stamped and colored the images from the Halloween Icons stamp set with an array of alcohol markers from my crafty realm. Next it was time to work on my background, I used an oldie but goodie from my stash called Stacked Edges 1 Dies! I added some faux black splatters to the top left and bottom right of the card panel.\n\nI needed a resting place for each of the cute Halloween Icons I colored, the Halloween Icons Die set has the perfect Circle and Medallion Die! I used coordinating cardstock to match the images and added splatters to the white circles. The Halloween Icons stamp set is perfect to make a grid card! Next step was to make a smaller panel for the actual grid, once I had this piece it was easy peasy!\n\nThe next and final step was the sentiment. The Halloween Corners stamp set with coordinating dies has wonderful sentiments! I took a sentiment and heat embossed it in white on black cardstock. The sentiment needed a resting place, I went to one of my most used die sets called the Sentiment Strips Dies! I die cut two sentiment strips from coordinating cardstock and Ta-Da card done! I adore the nontraditional color palette and the card is so stinking adorable with all the little images!\n\nFor my second card I’m using the new super cute Halloween Corners stamp set with coordinating dies, these images are the cutest! I stamped and colored the images in an array of alcohol markers. Next, I took the coordinating dies and did some die cutting.\n\nFor my background, card base, I did some ink blending using two new stencils form the release. I took the Layered Birch Trees stencils and made a light pink forest. I wanted to add a bit more interest in the background and decided to use the new Scattered Bats stencil. I did partial stenciling in the upper left corner and bottom right corner. I decided to use another favorite die set called Wonky Stitched Square Dies! I die cut two of squares and did some light ink blending. I adhered the squares to my card base with some foam tape, next I added the super cute images from the Halloween Corners stamp set.\n\nNow for the finishing touches, I die cut a few sentiment strips from the Sentiment Strips Dies and adhered them to the top left corner of the card I took one of the sentiments from the Halloween Corners stamp set and heat embossed it in white on black card stock, voila card is done! I can’t stress enough how stinking cute these images are and you’ll see them throughout my spooky crafting this fall!\n\nThank you so much for stopping by and you’re going to LOVE the new release, it’s chock full of Halloween goodness Have a great day!\n\nHi Everyone! Rebecca here with the easiest fun fold birthday card that you will ever make! You start with the Fancy Card Dies. I used each flap die to cut a different color of cardstock, but you can use the same color if you prefer. Each of the die cuts will have a small scored flap where you can adhere it with some strong double sided tape to the back of an A2 piece of cardstock.\n\nWatch the video above I Watch the video in HD on YouTube\n\nOnce all the flaps are adhered it’s time to have fun decorating! For the first smallest flap, I used the Party Hats Dies to cut out three colorful hats. On the next flap I used the Birthday Candles Dies and on the largest flap I used the Stitched Stars Dies.\n\nI even decorated the A2 piece of cardstock with the Party Balloons Dies. Next I stamped a sentiment with the Sentiment Strips: Birthday Stamp Set and cut that out with the Sentiment Strips Dies. I added some white gel pen details to the different cardstock elements and THAT IS IT!\n\nI love the interactive fun fold of this card and how EASY it is to create with the Fancy Card Dies.\n\nThanks so much for stopping by!\n\nRebecca"
