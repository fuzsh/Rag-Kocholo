        "text": "Love, Hope & Pizza\n\nHungry Howie’s is committed to a cause near and dear to the hearts of many – the fight against breast cancer. According to the National Breast Cancer Foundation®, 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Most of us know someone who has been affected by this disease, which is why since 2009, we’ve been dedicated to spreading awareness and raising funds for the National Breast Cancer Foundation® through our Love, Hope & Pizza campaign.\n\nWe partnered with the National Breast Cancer Foundation® because they’re recognized as one of the leading breast cancer organizations in the world. NBCF’s mission is to help women now by providing help and inspiring hope to those affected by breast cancer through early detection, education and support services. A recipient of Charity Navigator’s highest 4-star rating for 11 years, NBCF provides women Help for Today…Hope for Tomorrow® through its National Mammography Program, Beyond The Shock®, Early Detection Plan, MyNBCF online support community, and breast cancer research programs. For more information, please visit www.nbcf.org.\n\nEach October, during our Love, Hope & Pizza campaign, for every pizza purchased in a pink pizza box, Hungry Howie’s makes a donation to the National Breast Cancer Foundation®. In addition, your local Hungry Howie’s gives you the opportunity to donate even more to NBCF by purchasing special Love, Hope & Pizza merchandise. To date, together we've raised over $2.5 million for the National Breast Cancer Foundation®, which has led to free breast cancer screenings, breast cancer research & more.\n\nLocal Community Involvement\n\nOur independently owned and operated franchises are deeply rooted in their communities. Typically, when a new Hungry Howie’s opens its doors, the franchise owner donates a certain percentage of sales from the opening to a local school or charity. This charitable spirit continues far beyond a store’s opening.\n\nRecently, we have been assisting our front line workers and first responders in our local communities. These individuals have shown exceptional bravery and selflessness during this critical time. Hungry Howie's Pizza recognizes all that they are doing and has been doing their part in making sure these heroes have food always ready.\n\nNot only are we assisting our front line and first responders but all members of our local communities. With the current stay at home order, many people are isolated and away from loved ones. Hungry Howie's Pizza has been helping bring joy back to community members through our Random Acts of Pizza initiative.\n\nAnother amazing example of how our franchisees get deeply involved in their local communities is found in Phoenix, AZ. Our independently owned and operated franchises in the Phoenix, AZ market have built a close relationship with Phoenix Children’s Hospital since 2012. This relationship involves many inspiring initiatives, such as:\n\nProviding Phoenix Children’s Hospital with free pizza certificates for their nursing staff during Nurses Appreciation Week\n\nHelping out with Phoenix Children’s Hospital annual telethon\n\nDonating pizza to “the Zone”, an area of Phoenix Children’s Hospital where patients and their families can relax, play games, create crafts, etc.\n\nHaving a Hungry Howie’s booth for Phoenix Children’s Hospital’s end of the year dance for kids who can’t go to their prom\n\nRaising over $30,000 for the Phoenix Children’s Hospital Foundation, which is dedicated to providing philanthropic funding for vital, life-saving care to kids in Arizona\n\nDonation Requests\n\nOur headquarters receives hundreds of donation requests each year and it’s unfortunately impossible for us to participate in all of them. National charities and non-profit organizations may email proposals to Hungry Howie's Corporate Headquarters."
