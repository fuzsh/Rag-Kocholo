The urn is made by a very talented artist who is an expert in the art of forming clay. This piece features a Celtic knot design and is finished with a matching ceramic lid. Ceramic has long since been utilized to create vessels to house cremation ashes, and the earthen material and traditional process will help bring one back to their roots with a modern touch. These urns are made by hand, so no two pieces will ever look the same. This helps ensure that each vessel will be as unique as the individual it memorializes.\n\nTop opening lid could be sealed with adhesive."
