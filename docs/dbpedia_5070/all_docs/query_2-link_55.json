        "text": "SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) - An annual heartwarming tradition involving the Springfield Thunderbirds is taking place, once again, this weekend. It is ‘Pink in the Rink’ night as the Thunderbirds will be playing a game on pink ice and money will be raised for breast cancer research.\n\nFor the seventh time, the team is partnering with Rays of Hope for the ‘Pink in the Rink’ game, which is a way to show support and solidarity with those who either survived or are currently battling breast cancer. Baystate Health Foundation’s Director of Annual Giving and Events Kathy Tobin told Western Mass News that this is the kickoff to the fundraising campaign for Rays of Hope, which is now in its 30th year, and is eager for this night to take place.\n\n“We’re asking people to not just come to the game and participate, but to form their own teams, so that they can start fundraising because without the funds, we can’t provide the wonderful wraparound services that Rays of Hope has come to represent,” Tobin said.\n\nIt actually took the MassMutual Center a whole day to dye the ice pink and the theme for this year’s event: Barbie.\n\n“The founder of Mattel toys, who was part of Barbie, was a breast cancer survivor herself and very active in the campaign against breast cancer, so we thought it was fitting, we thought it would be fun and we are absolutely going to have a blast. We have some very special things planned,” Tobin added.\n\nLast year’s ‘Pink in the Rink’ night raised approximately $25,000 for Rays of Hope. For Thunderbirds President Nate Costa, this kind of night is not only meaningful, but also a little personal.\n\n“My aunt had breast cancer. I’m fortunate enough that she beat it and she survived. I think that’s a big part of what the night is all about, too. There’s life after going through breast cancer in many ways,” Costa explained.\n\nAll of the Thunderbirds players will be wearing special pink jerseys, which will be auctioned off after the game with the money going to breast cancer research. As for the thousands of fans, including hundreds of breast cancer survivors and fighters who will be in attendance, Costa said there will be plenty of pink to go around.\n\n“They are going to be doing light-up bam-bam thundersticks at the game. Everybody come out to the rink. It’s going to be a really cool atmosphere in the building and then, there will be different things throughout the concourse that fans can participate in,” Costa said.\n\nMeanwhile, Tobin said seeing people care about an issue like this is heartwarming and can be a real game changer.\n\n“When you’re in this building on Saturday night, you are going to feel that love and empowerment. You’re going to see over 100 breast cancer survivors take the ice with the players to kick off the game and you are going to feel the enthusiasm and hope that we signify,” Tobin explained.\n\nThe Thunderbirds take on the Toronto Marlies on Saturday with the puck set to drop shortly after 7 p.m. If you are unable to make Saturday’s game, you can watch watch it live on COZI TV."
