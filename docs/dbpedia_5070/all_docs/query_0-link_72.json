        "text": "Our hearts are full to bursting with excitement for this new sew along! The Woven Hearts Quilt Pattern has us all aflutter, and with the Woven Hearts Sew Along this October, you can join us as we highlight the importance of community and support for those facing the life-changing diagnosis of breast cancer.\n\nThe Woven Hearts Quilt measures 70.5″ square and is designed using the Woven Star Foundation Paper Pads. We made our quilt with the Dainty Meadow collection by My Sew Quilty Life for Moda Fabrics! You can reserve the Woven Hearts Quilt Kit and Backing Set to make one like ours (these are due in September!), and the fabric requirements can be found on the free pattern if you would like to sew with your own fabrics. The Woven Hearts Sew Along Supplies Page has all the supplies you need.\n\nDouble Your Impact with a Donation to BCRF\n\nThe Woven Hearts Quilt Pattern is a Fat Quarter Shop exclusive, designed especially for this fundraiser for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The way the fundraiser works is that we provide the quilt pattern for free and encourage you to donate $15 to our campaign for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation from now through November 19, 2024. Fat Quarter Shop will match up to $5,000 of the donations raised. Together, we can reach our goal of $10,000 to fund lifesaving research to end breast cancer.\n\nWe’re thrilled to be able to auction this beautiful quilt generously donated by our friend Gina Tell! She pieced the quilt AND did the longarm quilting on it, and it’s beautiful! In October, we’ll auction her quilt to one lucky bidder, and 100% of the proceeds from the auction will go to BCRF.\n\nMark your calendars! The Woven Hearts Sew Along runs from October 1 – November 19. We’ll share our fundraising progress here on the Jolly Jabber blog as well as on our socials, so make sure that you’re subscribed and following us.\n\nSince 2021, Fat Quarter Shop is proud to have donated more than $45,000 to breast cancer charities with the support of the generous quilting community. This year, our fundraising goal is $10,000 for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF). This amazing charity is responsible for discovering the BRCA genes and they fund scientists who’ve made numerous breakthroughs in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. For people everywhere, more wins against cancer can’t come fast enough, and we’re proud to join the fight. Will you join us?\n\nJoin Us for Woven Hearts!\n\nRight-click the badge above to download and share to show you’re participating in The Woven Hearts Sew Along. EVERYONE can sew along, and we hope you will! To participate, all you have to do is gather your supplies and follow along with us when we release the schedule in September. Get inspired and share your progress with #FQSWovenHearts\n\nThis year’s slogan is “No one should face breast cancer alone,” so show the community that they are anything but alone by using the hashtags#FQSWovenHearts and #BCAM2024 on Instagram.\n\nYou can find Gina Tell on her blog, YouTube Channel, and Instagram (@gina_tell_threadgraffiti)."
