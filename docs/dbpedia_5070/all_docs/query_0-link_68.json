Research shows that bosses’ behavior can lead to high blood pressure or psychiatric problems in their subordinates. By learning how to set boundaries, says Lauren Sontag, the president of a consulting firm specializing in executive coaching, leadership development, and talent management, David might be able to improve his relationship with Thaddeus.
