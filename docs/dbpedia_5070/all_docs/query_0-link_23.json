Only about 5% of overall breast cancer research in the U.S. goes to MBC research. If we can find a cure for MBC, we can end death from breast cancer.\n\nApproximately 30% of early stage breast cancer survivors will have a recurrence as metastatic disease, even after completing successful treatment.\n\nMetastases can occur as early as several months to 25+ years after treatment.\n\n685,000 people a year die from metastatic breast cancer globally.\n\nOnly 31% of U.S. MBC patients live longer than 5 years, and only 11% of live longer than 10 years.\n\nDue to a lack of public knowledge about MBC compared with early stage breast cancer, there are many widespread misperceptions. There is NO CURE for MBC.\n\nWhy green, teal and pink?\n\nThe pink ribbon is well-known for representing the fight against breast cancer, but most MBC patients feel that pink does not encapsulate their experience. Metastatic Breast Cancer may start in the breast, but its spread to vital organs makes the disease fatal.\n\nTo highlight the uniqueness of the disease and show its commonality with other Stage IV cancers, METAvivor designed a base ribbon of green and teal to represent metastasis.\n\nGreen represents renewal, hope, and immortality\n\nTeal symbolizes healing and spirituality\n\nPink signifies the metastatic cancer originated in the breast\n\nSee this story from Glamour for more info on the tri-color ribbon and how this #LightUpMBC campaign has become a movement for change.\n\nThe inspiration behind the campaign\n\nJessica Moore was a nurse at a skilled care unit. She embodied the word “care”, dedicated her life as a healthcare worker to helping others, and was even recognized with the “Caregiver of the Year” award by the organization that she worked for. At the age of 32, she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer and passed away from the disease less than 4 years later. During her treatment, her family formed the Moore Fight Moore Strong (MFMS) organization to shine a light on the need for MBC awareness & research. In October 2017, the first bridge to light in MBC colors was the Memorial Bridge in Portsmouth, NH near her hometown. #LightUpMBC is the result of years of hard work from MFMS to light up the world to bring awareness and funding to critical MBC research.\n\nParticipating Landmarks\n\nCheck HERE to see if your city is participated in the 2024 #LightUpMBC.\n\nSnap a photo of a participating landmark in your city on 10/13 and be sure to tag #LightUpMBC #METAvivor on Facebook or Instagram for a chance for your photo to be featured in #LIghtUpMBC Live!\n\nFeel the unity of the night as landmarks around the world shine a light on the importance of awareness and funding for Metastatic Breast Cancer research.\n\nShawn Pierce Photography\n\nShimmer By Cindy\n\nComplement your #LightUpMBC apparel perfectly with jewelry from the Shimmer for the Cure™ - MBC Collection from Shimmer By Cindy! 25% of the profits of every purchase is donated to METAvivor.
