        "text": "Bella Muntean-Angel Heart of HOPE Ministry was founded by and is in memory of Bella Muntean. Bella spent most of her 15 years performing selfless acts for others in need, giving all the glory to God.\n\nShe has shown how God can take the efforts of one small individual and touch thousands of hearts worldwide - even in the midst of her struggle with cancer. Imagine what God can do through you! We invite you to not only read the miraculous stories of Bella and her friends but to share your stories as well.\n\nBella was your typical fun loving, joyful and healthy child. She only had an antibiotic once in 12 years prior to her diagnosis. She was in gymnastics, then spent several years in jazz and ballet dance, was part of the Jr. Cotillion, an avid flute player (accepted into State a week before her cancer diagnosis) and a straight A student being part of the Duke Tip program. Her dream was to attend Clemson or Harvard. She had a passion for photography, traveling and community service. While growing up in MI before she moved to SC in 2nd grade, Bella enjoyed ringing the bell with her sister, Julia, for Salvation Army, was active in the church, helping out at the soup kitchen and serving the homeless.\n\nOne man who was homeless, Chris, rode his bicycle everywhere, even during the Michigan winter, and Bella befriended him. Bella and her mom would meet him at McDonald's across from where they lived and visit with him. He would have icicles in\n\nWhile visiting Dorin's family in Romania when Bella was 6 years old, it was during a trip to an orphanage that impacted Bella's heart forever. Bella heard her parents speak about the orphanages there, insisting to pack a suitcase full of her clothes and toys for the children. When they delivered the items, a 4-5 yr old mute girl in a crib was excitedly reaching her hands out to Bella.\n\nBrenda said, \"The most memorable thing happened next. Bella removed the necklace around her neck and placed it around the little girl's neck and hugged her. I stood there with tears streaming down my face and the girls were both full of smiles and laughing! They couldn't speak to each other but the language of love is universal and of God. We wanted to take all of the children home with us. Bella often spoke of this memory which inspired her continuation with selfless acts of kindness.”\n\nAlso, in 5th grade, out of the 10 hours required for community service through Beta Club, Bella completed 106 hours by the end of the school year. She performed many deeds for the residents of the nursing home where her grandma resided at the time. But, one of her favorite things was raising money for a local boy, Joe, who had cancer and wanted to go to Legoland through Make A Wish. Bella made loom band bracelets and sold them everywhere including the grocery lines, at school, church, and at a garage sale where she had a table just for Joe:) She raised over $600 by herself and her parents added an additional amount. Bella mentioned several times during her cancer journey that she never realized one day she would be a recipient of an amazing Make A Wish trip.\n\n​\n\nIn the same 5th-grade year, Bella was nominated by her lovely teacher, Bakita Knebel, and selected as one of \"10 Students Who Make A Difference\" in the Upstate Parent's Magazine. In this article, Bella is holding a photo of an acrylic painting that she painted when she was 10 years old, competed against 5th-8th graders in the State of SC at the Beta Club Convention, and won 2nd place. She wanted to paint the bird yellow (which is her type of cancer ribbon color) and gave it the title \"Random Acts of Kindness.\" This was all part of God's plan.\n\n​\n\nEven during her cancer treatment, Bella raised $1,100 by herself on Instagram to purchase over 40 various sized American Girl dolls at the AG Benefit Sale to give to children with cancer and life-threatening illnesses. Brenda said, “We always tried to teach Bella and Julia the importance of giving back because your life can truly change in an instant, like ours did, and you never know when you will be needing help.”\n\nIt is every parent's worst nightmare hearing the words \"Your child has cancer or a life-threatening illness.\" On January 16, 2016, at the age of 12, Bella was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. Despite all of her daily suffering and numerous physical challenges, Bella gave it all to God. With a smile on her face and unwavering faith, Bella inspired people of all ages worldwide, even those of different languages, religions, and cultures.\n\n​\n\nBella was inspired to create her charity, Angels Of Hope, during her cancer treatment from an angel drawn on her pillowcase by her pre-operative nurse, Pam Wrobel. The angel brought her so much comfort and hope that she kept it with her at every hospital stay. Bella suggested taking the pillowcases and filling them with gifts to help children undergoing chemotherapy.\n\n​\n\nA Note From Bella’s Mom:\n\n“Bella died peacefully in my arms with my husband, Dorin, at her side but my greatest joy is knowing that Bella is with God and more alive than ever. I have received messages from people all over telling me how Bella's unwavering faith impacted their life and how she ministered to their problems. We had no idea until she passed that she was ministering to others. This was ALL God, using Bella’s immense love while suffering to ignite faith and change lives!! We are so blessed. God is Love which is our HOPE.”\n\nBrenda continues Bella's Instagram account at which had over 24,000 followers worldwide. Bella was an avid American Girl photographer within the AGIG community but her ministry and unwavering faith is what drew people from all ages, different countries, religions and races to her. She told and taught everyone with humility that \"GOD is LOVE.\"\n\n1 John 4:8\n\nAlso, since Bella was 4 years old, continuing throughout her life and cancer journey, she shared with her mother many instances where she could see spirits and angels. Bella was never afraid of death and her family knows this is because God showed her a glimpse of the beauty and peace on the other side. It was evident that God had His hand on her life protecting her with His angels, love and mercy.\n\nEventually, Brenda plans to write a book to give others hope in the Love of God by sharing these spiritual experiences along with Bella's ministry to others, unbeknownst to her parents, with stories and messages sent to them after her passing.\n\n​\n\nNow, as Brenda, Dorin and Julia continue daily to face the painful loss of their beloved Bella, they are forever inspired and encouraged by their young daughter/sister who never wavered in her faith for God. They felt led to continue her legacy by honoring God and His blessing of bringing Bella's dreams of this non-profit to fruition. 2 Corinthians 12:9 My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness."
