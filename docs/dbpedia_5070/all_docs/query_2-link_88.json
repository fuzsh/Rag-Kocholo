        "text": "The Beginning\n\n​The Pink Queen Foundation, a Nonprofit Organization, was born out of my desire to impact the lives of women who are currently undergoing treatments for Breast Cancer. While I personally have a story in reference to breast cancer, The Pink Queen Foundation is not about me, but about men and women who are in need of a little extra help while they battle this dreadful disease CANCER.\n\nI am a proud survivor, my experience with this journey has allowed me to witness what is lacking in our communities with reference to support from current local and national organizations. I have assisted many individuals and I have shared with them my knowledge, gifts that I received, and experiences which could help them as they enter into their own journey with this disease. This has truly developed into a passion of mine. I will continue to keep the journey behind the Pink Ribbon alive every 365."
