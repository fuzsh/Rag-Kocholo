Each holiday season, a portion of the Pink Award's proceeds goes towards supporting survivors in need.\n\nSix years ago, founder April Love incorporated the Pink Awards ceremony to celebrate and honor the accomplishments of individuals who are a positive force within their respective industries and surrounding communities.
