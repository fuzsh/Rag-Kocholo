        "text": "In 2009, thanks to the collaboration of the Royal Bucintoro Rowing Society and AVAPO Venice, an association which has been assisting cancer patients and their families for over 30 years, the group Pink Lionesses in Venice was formed.\n\nFounded along the lines traced by the initiative “Abreast in a boat” by Canadian physiotherapist Donald C. McKenzie who saw in rowing a particularly efficient means of recovery for breast cancer patients, the Venetian Women in Pink have become an important element in the social life of the Bucintoro. On board their dragon boat, they send daily a message of solidarity and hope, an example for all women who, like them, have gone through this difficult experience.\n\nIn recent years they have participated in numerous dragon boat competitions with the colours of the Bucintoro, as well as in Venice’s social and rowing events. They also promote meetings related to the treatment, rehabilitation and prevention of breast cancer, and are associated with similar groups worldwide, who often come to row together at the Vogalonga.\n\nIn 2014, they were the proud recipients of the Panathlon Social Award. In October 2015, a month dedicated in Italy to breast cancer prevention, they participated in numerous events and welcomed to Venice the Belgian group Pink Ribbon for a week of meetings and rowing together. On 10 October 2015, they organised Venice’s very first Camminata Rosa (Pink Walk), with the support of the City of Venice and many other entities of the city, an event greeted with an outpouring of solidarity for the rehabilitation and prevention of cancer.\n\nThe Pink Lionesses in images"
