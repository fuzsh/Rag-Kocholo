        "text": "Creighton seeks to close January with another win\n\n1/25/2024 4:56:00 PM\n\nGame #21: DePaul Blue Demons (3-16, 0-8) at #17 Creighton Bluejays (15-5, 6-3)\n\nSaturday, Jan. 27, 2024 • 6:00 p.m. • Omaha, Neb. • CHI Health Center Omaha\n\n| LIVE VIDEO | LIVE AUDIO | LIVE STATS | CU NOTES | DEPAUL NOTES | PROGRAM |\n\nNext Game\n\nNo. 17 Creighton (15-5, 6-3 BIG EAST) hosts DePaul (3-16, 0-8 BIG EAST) on Saturday evening as part of the program's annual Creighton vs. Cancer Pink Out. Tip-off at CHI Health Center Omaha in Omaha, Neb., is scheduled for 6:00 p.m.\n\nA sold out CHI Health Center Omaha (17,352) in Omaha, Neb., will host the action, with the first 16,000 fans receiving a free pink t-shirt thanks to CHI Health and Methodist Hospital.\n\nRadio Broadcast Information\n\nKOZN (1620 AM) and KOOO (101.9 FM) will carry all Creighton men's basketball games during the 2023-24 season. John Bishop and Ross Ferrarini will call the action.\n\nThe audio is webcast at 1620thezone.com and can also be heard on SiriusXM channel 160 or 201 as well as https://sxm.app.link/964.\n\nTelecast Information\n\nSaturday's game will be called by Lane Grindle and Jess Settles and televised on FS1.\n\nSaturday's contest will also be video webcast at https://FoxSports.com/live. Cable authorization may be required.\n\nLive Stats Information\n\nAll of Creighton's games this season will have free live stats. Visit www.gocreighton.com and click on the small bar graph icon on the scoreboard at the top of the page for the event of your choosing.\n\nScouting No. 17 Creighton\n\nCreighton is 15-5 this season, including home wins over Iowa (92-84), Alabama (85-82), No. 23 Providence (69-60), St. John's (66-64) and Xavier (85-78), and road victories at Oklahoma State (79-65), Nebraska (89-60) and Seton Hall (97-94 in 3OT). The Bluejays lost their first two BIG EAST games this season by a combined seven points, but are 6-1 since the calendar turned to January.\n\nThe nucleus of the team is formed by three returning starters as senior forward Baylor Scheierman (17.9, 8.1 rpg., 3.9 apg), senior center Ryan Kalkbrenner (16.3 ppg., 7.6 rpg., 2.8 bpg., 63.2 FG%), and junior guard Trey Alexander (16.7 ppg., 6.2 rpg., 4.6 apg.) all put their professional aspirations on hold and came back.\n\nAdd in senior transfer Steven Ashworth (8.9 ppg,. 3.8 apg.), the USBWA District VII Player of the Year last year at Utah State, and it's easy to see why CU was one of three BIG EAST teams picked in the top-10 nationally in the preseason.\n\nThe Bluejays boast an offense that shoots 48.0 percent from the floor and 35.6 percent from three-point land while draining 10.4 three-pointers per contest (12th-best nationally), which contributes to CU's 79.4 points per game. The Jays also outrebound foes by 5.0 caroms per contest.\n\nCU's defense has held teams to 67.4 points per game and allowed opponents to make just 108 three-pointers all year. Creighton's 11.25 fouls per game are the fewest in the nation.\n\nScouting DePaul\n\nDePaul is 3-16 on the season and the BIG EAST's only remaining winless team in league play (0-8). Saturday will mark the second game under interim head coach Matt Brady after head coach Tony Stubblefield was relieved of his duties earlier in the week.\n\nThe Blue Demon line-up features two men who average in double-figures, Chico Carter Jr. (11.8 ppg., 3.7 apg.), and Da'Sean Nelson (11.2 ppg.). One other player to keep an eye on is guard Jalen Terry (7.2 ppg.), who has led DePaul in scoring the past two games.\n\nDePaul averages 65.6 points per game and shoots 43.4 percent from the field, 34.9 percent from three-point land and 71.6 percent at the line. The Blue Demons allow 78.7 points per contest and are outrebounded by 5.9 caroms per contest.\n\nThe Series With DePaul\n\nCreighton has won 24 of the last 25 (including 19 straight) meetings with DePaul to take a 29-16 lead in the all-time series. Creighton is 22-1 in the series since joining the BIG EAST, including an 84-58 win in Chicago on January 9th.\n\nTwenty-one of the last 23 meetings in the series have been decided by double-figures, including the past 12 meetings in Omaha since 1986.\n\nGreg McDermott is 22-1 against DePaul but has never faced interim head coach Matt Brady.\n\nThe Creighton Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) owns a 315-155 record in his 14th season with the Bluejays. He ranks 16th among active coaches in victories with a career mark of 595-350 in his 30th season, and is 464-286 in his 23rd Division I campaign.\n\nMcDermott led Creighton to its first BIG EAST regular-season title in 2019-20, taking a Bluejay team that was picked seventh in the league's preseason poll and ending the year ranked seventh nationally. The Cascade, Iowa native has coached Creighton to a share of its first regular-season BIG EAST title in 2019-20 its first Sweet 16 since 1974 in 2020-21 and first Elite Eight since 1941 in 2022-23.\n\nMcDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000).\n\nHe is assisted by Ryan Miller, Jalen Courtney-Williams and Derek Kellogg.\n\nWith A Win...\n\n- Greg McDermott would pass Jamie Dixon for 10th in BIG EAST history with his 116th regular-season league win.\n\n- Creighton would improve to 10-1 this season at home.\n\n- Creighton would finish January 7-1, tying its most wins in the month of January since 2017.\n\n- Creighton would improve to 7-0 in BIG EAST games this season when former Seton Hall coach Bill Raftery isn't on the call.\n\n- Creighton would reach the midpoint of league play 7-3 for the third time in the last four seasons, with the previous two such teams making the Sweet 16 (2020-21) and Elite Eight (2022-23).\n\n- Creighton would win its 20th straight meeting vs. DePaul and improve to 23-1 against the Blue Demons since joining the BIG EAST.\n\nMilestone Watch\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner is seven points shy of becoming the 14th player in Creighton history to reach 1,500 career points.\n\nBaylor Scheierman owns 995 career defensive rebounds (415 at Creighton) and is five shy of 1,000. His next assist will also be his 200th at CU.\n\nFredrick King owns 196 career points as the sophomores eyes 200.\n\nIt's Suits And Sneakers Week\n\nThe NABC and Coaches vs. Cancer host one of their biggest initiatives of the year from Jan. 22-28 for Suits and Sneakers Week.\n\nIt'll see the Creighton coaching staff wear suits with sneakers to bring awareness of the importance of cancer screening and health equity.\n\nOne-third of people in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer, but regular screening increases the chances of detecting certain cancers early before it has a chance to spread. More information about screening and saving lives can be found at Cancer.org.\n\nIn 2018 Coaches vs. Cancer presented Greg McDermott with the Champion Award, which recognizes a college coach who has shown extraordinary leadership and a commitment to the American Cancer Society's mission of saving lives, celebrating lives and leading the fight for a world without cancer.\n\nMatching Donations On Gameday\n\nAs always the Creighton vs. Cancer Pink Out game directly supports cancer patients staying for free at the American Cancer Society Hope Lodge right here in Omaha.\n\nThis year Nebraska Cancer Specialists has generously agreed to match all donations to Hope Lodge raised at the game, up to $30,000.\n\nAll fans – both at home and at the game are asked to consider a donation. Visit http://cancer.org/pinkout to make your gameday donation.\n\nCreighton's Pink Out History\n\nThis year will mark Creighton's 14th Pink Out, which coincides with the arrival of head coach Greg McDermott. The Bluejays are 9-4 in the first 13 Pink Out games, while playing in front of an average of 17,930 fans per game (excluding 2021, when COVID limited attendance), as seen below:\n\nDate Result Attendance\n\n01/29/11 Creighton 83, Indiana State 69 16,044\n\n01/28/12 Creighton 73, Bradley 59 18,436\n\n02/02/13 Creighton 75, Bradley 58 18,111\n\n01/25/14 Creighton 76, Georgetown 63 18,859\n\n01/17/15 Providence 74, Creighton 65 17,640\n\n01/30/16 Seton Hall 75, Creighton 65 17,924\n\n01/28/17 Creighton 83, DePaul 66 17,611\n\n01/27/18 Creighton 85, Georgetown 77 18,518\n\n01/25/19 Creighton 75, Butler 61 18,089\n\n01/26/20 Creighton 77, Xavier 66 17,796\n\n02/03/21 Georgetown 86, Creighton 79 1,845\n\n01/29/22 Xavier 79, Creighton 69 17,850\n\n01/28/23 Creighton 84, Xavier 67 18,277\n\nYearly Pink Out Totals\n\nCreighton has raised $532,969.64 since the start of the 2011-12 season during its annual men's basketball Pink Out auctions, plus additional money collected on gameday, underwriting or matching donations.\n\n2011-12: $20,600\n\n2012-13: $24,444\n\n2013-14: $48,247.11\n\n2014-15: $16,384.03\n\n2015-16: $16,527.90\n\n2016-17: $26,361.64\n\n2017-18: $28,796\n\n2018-19: $19,595\n\n2019-20: $31,803.18\n\n2020-21: $40,381\n\n2021-22: $24,165\n\n2022-23: $27,432\n\n2023-24: $36,002.46\n\nAdditional Donations: $172,230.32\n\n13-Year Totals: $532,969.64\n\nPink Out Auction Raises $36,002.46\n\nWhen Creighton hosts DePaul on Saturday, January 27th in its 14th Annual Pink Out game, Bluejay players will wear pink shooting shirts and pink-trimmed jerseys for the game.\n\nFans had the opportunity to honor a friend or family member who has battled cancer or is currently battling cancer by purchasing the apparel via auction (the shooting shirt can be personalized – last name, nickname, etc.).\n\nAll funds raised go to benefit Hope Lodge Omaha.

In fact, only twice has CU beaten the same BIG EAST team by 20+ points in both regular-season meetings, as seen below:\n\nIn 2013-14 Creighton beat No. 4 Villanova 96-68 in Philadelphia, then won the rematch in Omaha 101-80 over the then-No. 6 Wildcats.\n\nLast season, Creighton beat Butler 78-56 in Omaha, then took the rematch at Hinkle Fieldhouse by a 73-52 count.\n\nJumpin' In January\n\nCreighton is 6-1 in January as it heads into its final game of the month.

Regardless of the result, Creighton will own a winning percentage of .500 or better at the midway point in league play for the 26th time in the past 28 seasons.\n\nHere's how Creighton's teams have fared in the various halves of the MVC/BIG EAST season since 1995-96.\n\nYear Midway Thru League Play League\n\n2023-24 6-3 so far BIG EAST\n\n2022-23 7-3 BIG EAST\n\n2021-22 5-5 BIG EAST\n\n2020-21 7-3 BIG EAST\n\n2019-20 6-3 BIG EAST\n\n2018-19 4-5 BIG EAST\n\n2017-18 6-3 BIG EAST\n\n2016-17 6-3 BIG EAST\n\n2015-16 5-4 BIG EAST\n\n2014-15 1-8 BIG EAST\n\n2013-14 8-1 BIG EAST\n\n2012-13 7-2 Missouri Valley\n\n2011-12 8-1 Missouri Valley\n\n2010-11 5-4 Missouri Valley\n\n2009-10 5-4 Missouri Valley\n\n2008-09 5-4 Missouri Valley\n\n2007-08 5-4 Missouri Valley\n\n2006-07 6-3 Missouri Valley\n\n2005-06 7-2 Missouri Valley\n\n2004-05 5-4 Missouri Valley\n\n2003-04 7-2 Missouri Valley\n\n2002-03 8-1 Missouri Valley\n\n2001-02 8-1 Missouri Valley\n\n2000-01 5-4 Missouri Valley\n\n1999-00 5-4 Missouri Valley\n\n1998-99 6-3 Missouri Valley\n\n1997-98 5-4 Missouri Valley\n\n1996-97 5-4 Missouri Valley\n\n1995-96 4-5 Missouri Valley\n\nTotal 167-97 (.633)\n\nMcDermott Among The Best\n\nGreg McDermott ranks 10th in league history with 115 regular-season league wins.\n\nMcDermott, along with Ed Cooley and Rick Pitino, are the only three active coaches with 100 regular-season BIG EAST wins.

Since 2005-06, the only other 7-footer to play 53 minutes or more in any college game was former Connecticut center Hasheem Thabeet. The 7-foot-3 UConn big man played 53 minutes in a memorable six-overtime loss to Syracuse that started on March 12, 2009 at the BIG EAST Tournament.\n\nSpeaking of Kalkbrenner, his seven blocked shots tied the most ever by one of Greg McDermott's players in his 750 games as a Division I head coach. Gregory Echenique had seven vs. Missouri State on Jan. 22, 2011.\n\nKalkbrenner's 12 blocked shots last week made him the only player in the nation with more than 10 swats last week. It also moved up him to fourth in the country for the entire season with 54 rejections.\n\nKalkbrenner became the first player from a \"Power 6\" conference with at least 28 points, nine rebounds and seven blocks in a game since Providence's Herbert Hill (29/15/8) vs. Syracuse on Feb. 24, 2007.\n\nLast but not least on Kalkbrenner, his 23 field goal attempts were a career-high and came on the heels of a season-low five attempts in a loss at UConn.\n\nBaylor Scheierman (20/10/6/0) became the first BIG EAST player since Georgetown's Jessie Govan (20/10/6/0) vs. UNC Greensboro on Dec. 22, 2016) to finish with at least 20 points, 10 rebounds, six assists and no turnovers.\n\nKadary Richmond attempted 32 field goals were the most against Creighton by a single player in at least 40 seasons, four more than the 28 by Western Michigan's Jim Havrilla on Dec. 8, 1990.\n\nCreighton had 82 field goal attempts at Seton Hall, its most in a game in at least 35 years. Seton Hall had 86 field goal attempts on Saturday, the most by a Creighton opponent in at least 35 years. It was the first BIG EAST game since at least 2010 in which both teams attempted 80 or more shots.\n\nSaturday was Creighton's first true road win when being outrebounded by 11 or more since a Jan. 7, 2017 win at Providence, and just the fifth road win when losing the rebound battle by 11 or more under Greg McDermott.\n\nOn Saturday Creighton made 13 three-pointers and blocked 10 shots. It was its first time with 10 or more in both categories since Feb. 17, 2002 vs. Wichita State.\n\nCreighton is the nation's only team from a \"Power 6\" conference with five road wins in both men's and women's basketball this season. The only eight teams nationally that can say that are Creighton, Eastern Washington, Fairfield, Green Bay, Montana, Princeton, St. Thomas and Toledo.\n\nYou Can't Spell McDermott Without OT\n\nSaturday marked Greg McDermott's first triple-overtime game as a Division I head coach.\n\nMcDermott is 17-13 in single-overtime games (9-7 at Creighton), 6-3 in double-overtime games (2-1 at Creighton) and 1-0 in triple-overtime games (1-0 at Creighton).\n\nMcDermott's first overtime game as a Division I head coach was a 2002 Northern Iowa win over Creighton. His first double-overtime game as a Division I coach was a 2004 victory over Missouri State in the MVC Tournament title game, which clinched his first appearance in the NCAA Tournament as a Division I head coach.\n\nWorking Overtime\n\nCreighton's 97-94 triple-overtime win at Seton Hall on Jan. 20th was its second overtime contest of the season, having also gone an extra five minutes to Villanova one month earlier (losing 68-66) on Dec. 20th in Omaha.\n\nIt was just the second triple-overtime game in history for Creighton, joining a Feb. 1, 1978 loss (85-82) in Omaha to No. 13 DePaul in a non-conference contest.\n\nCreighton's last overtime win had been its 72-69 win over San Diego State during the 2022 NCAA Tournament.\n\nCreighton is 62-52 all-time in all games with at least one overtime, including a 12-8 mark under Greg McDermott. The Jays are then 10-10 in the next game after an overtime battle.\n\nOn The Triple\n\nSaturday's triple-overtime thriller was the first BIG EAST game to go three overtimes or longer since No. 11 Providence beat Xavier 99-92 on Feb. 23, 2022.\n\nIn fact, that's the only other triple-overtime game since the BIG EAST reconfigured on July 1, 2013.\n\nThis season, there's only been five games nationally to go three overtimes or longer, as seen below:\n\nDate Winner Loser Score\n\n11/16/23 Nicholls at South Alabama 102-97\n\n11/29/23 at Temple La Salle 106-99\n\n01/03/24 Fordham at George Washington 119-113\n\n01/13/24 at Winthrop Radford 92-88\n\n01/20/24 #18 Creighton at Seton Hall 97-94\n\nDoing It All\n\nCreighton's Baylor Scheierman and Providence's Devin Carter are the only two men in the BIG EAST to average at least 15.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game this season.\n\nPrior to this year, only eight BIG EAST players have ever accomplished that feat over the course of a full season.\n\nBIG EAST Players To Average 15 PPG, 8 RPG, 3 APG\n\nSeason Name, School PPG RPG APG\n\n1979-80 Louis Orr, Syracuse 16.0 8.5 3.5\n\n1989-90 Billy Owens, Syracuse 18.2 8.4 4.6\n\n1990-91 Billy Owens, Syracuse 23.3 11.6 3.5\n\n1995-96 Adrian Griffin, Seton Hall 19.5 8.3 3.1\n\n1999-00 Ricardo Greer, Pitt 18.1 9.8 3.2\n\n2004-05 Ryan Gomes, Providence 21.6 8.2 3.2\n\n2009-10 Greg Monroe, Georgetown 16.1 9.6 3.8\n\n2018-19 Alpha Diallo, Providence 16.0 8.1 3.1\n\n2023-24 Baylor Scheierman, CU 17.9 8.1 3.9\n\n2023-24 Devin Carter, Providence 18.0 8.2 3.4\n\n55 Minutes For Number 55\n\nBaylor Scheierman played all 55 minutes in Saturday's game at Seton Hall, setting a Creighton single-game record.\n\nHe's the first BIG EAST player to play 55 minutes or more in a game since four men 60 by Eric Atkins; 56 each by Pat Connaughton, Chane Behanan and Russ Smith) did in a five-overtime Louisville/Notre Dame game on Feb. 9, 2013.\n\nHe's the first BIG EAST player to play 55 minutes or more without leaving the floor since DePaul's Will Walker played all 55 minutes vs. St. John's on March 5, 2010.\n\nScheierman is the second player in the country to play 55 minutes or more this season in a game, joining La Salle's Khalil Brantley at Temple on Nov. 29th.\n\nScheierman leads the BIG EAST with 39.9 minutes per game in conference action this winter, a number made even more preposterous when you consider he logged just 26 minutes in a lopsided win at DePaul.\n\nOvertime Is Trey Time\n\nTrey Alexander's three-pointer with 28.4 seconds left in triple-overtime gave Creighton a 93-91 lead it would not surrender at Seton Hall, but it's not the first time he's provided overtime heroics. He had also given CU a 90-89 lead with 55.6 left on a jumper.\n\nAlexander has been on the field for all 35 overtime minutes of each of Creighton's last four games to go beyond 40 minutes, and he's been excellent each time.\n\nHe's shot 10-for-16 from the field (.625), including 1-for-2 from three-point range (.500) while making 7-of-8 free throws (.875). Alexander also has two assists and two blocked shots in that span.\n\nAlexander has scored 28 of Creighton's 61 overtime points in those four contests.\n\nIt's All Coming Back To Me Now\n\nCreighton allowed the first five points of triple-overtime and trailed 88-83 with 3:10 left before embarking on a 14-3 run en route to a 97-94 victory at Seton Hall on Jan. 20th.\n\nIt was Creighton's first win after trailing by five or more points in overtime since overcoming a pair of five-point deficits (including 65-60 with 1:03 left in the first overtime) of an eventual 75-69 double-overtime win at Marquette on Jan. 1, 2022.\n\nBlock Party\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner owned a career-high seven blocked shots on Jan. 20 at Seton Hall. That made him the first Bluejay since Gregory Echenique had seven rejections on Jan. 22, 2011 at Missouri State.\n\nThe only other Bluejays in the last 30 seasons with seven or more rejections in a game are Kenny Lawson Jr. (7 at Evansville on Jan. 3, 2010) and Doug Swenson (8 at UMKC on Nov. 18, 1998).\n\nBenoit Benjamin dominates Creighton's single-game blocked shot list, as seen below:\n\nBlk. Name, Opponent Date\n\n12 Benoit Benjamin at Bradley 02/02/85\n\n11 Benoit Benjamin vs. Tulsa 02/16/84\n\n10 Benoit Benjamin vs. Omaha 12/22/83\n\nBenoit Benjamin at Illinois State 03/08/84\n\nBenoit Benjamin vs. Southern Illinois 01/17/85\n\n9 Benoit Benjamin vs. West Texas A&M 01/21/84\n\n8 Benoit Benjamin vs. Iowa State 12/10/83\n\nBenoit Benjamin at Chaminade 12/19/84\n\nBenoit Benjamin at Tulsa 01/12/85\n\nDoug Swenson at UMKC 11/18/98\n\nWhat's Your 20?\n\nTuesday's game vs. Xavier was Creighton's 20th contest of the season.

That's the seventh-best mark in the nation, and better than all other \"Power 6\" schools (North Carolina is next-closest at +46).\n\nBest Point Differential, True Road Games (1/24)\n\nRk.

Purdue (3), Auburn (2), Illinois (2), Duke (2) and Kansas State (2) are the only other \"Power 6\" schools with more than one against \"Power 6\" competition.\n\nThis season marks the first time that Creighton has picked up multiple road wins by 25 points or more since 1963-64.\n\nPure Charity\n\nCreighton has shot 70 percent or better at the free throw line in each of its last 16 conference games.\n\nThat's the program's longest such streak since at least 1987-88, and is also the nation's longest active such streak, three games longer than Ball State and Niagara's 13.\n\nCreighton is shooting 75.5 percent from the line this season, while last year's team set a program-record by converting 78.3 percent of its charity tries.\n\nScheierman Makes Wooden Award Cut\n\nCreighton's Baylor Scheierman has landed a spot on the Midseason Top 25 for the John R. Wooden® Award presented by Principal®. Chosen by a poll of national college basketball experts, the list is comprised of 25 student-athletes who are the early front-runners for college basketball's most prestigious individual honor.\n\nThis year marks the seventh time in the past 13 seasons that Creighton is represented on the Wooden Award Midseason 25 list. Creighton's Doug McDermott won the Wooden Award following the 2013-14 season after also being a finalist in both 2011-12 and 2012-13. Maurice Watson Jr. was on the list of 25 in 2016-17 and Marcus Foster was among those listed a year later, as was Marcus Zegarowski in 2020-21. None of those three most recent men advanced to the final cut.\n\nThe only other BIG EAST players to make the Midseason Top 25 list are Tyler Kolek and Tristen Newton.\n\nChairmen Of The Boards\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner owns 728 rebounds, and has grabbed eight or more boards in 10 of his last 11 games.\n\nHe enters Saturday's contest eighth in program history after moving up two spots on the road last week.\n\nReb.

That makes him one of just two players nationally since 2010-11 with more than 10 such contests, joining Weber State's Dillon Jones (22).\n\nOne other quirky stat about Scheierman? He owned 1,088 career rebounds in his first 145 career games. Those are the exact same numbers that Doug McDermott finished his college career with.\n\nMeet The Alexander's\n\nThough they're not related, the stats of Ty-Shon Alexander (2017-20) and Trey Alexander (2021-Present) are pretty similar through 92 career games.\n\nThat's a positive development considering that Ty-Shon was a First Team All-BIG EAST choice who helped Creighton to a share of the 2020 BIG EAST title and later played for the 2021 NBA runner-up Phoenix Suns.\n\nThrough 92 Career Games\n\nName PTS REB AST BLK STL FG% 3FG% FT%\n\nTy-Shon 1128 341 201 20 79 .414 .368 .810\n\nTrey 1094 410 273 41 85 .439 .352 .814\n\nScheierman The Scorer?\n\nBaylor Scheierman is fourth in the BIG EAST Conference in scoring at 17.9 points per game, but does own a league-high 358 points scored.\n\nBefore being held to nine points on Jan. 6 vs. Providence, Scheierman had become just the third Creighton player in the last 25 seasons to score in double-figures each of the first 14 games of a year, joining Doug McDermott (all 35 games in 2011-12) and Marcus Foster (first 15 in 2017-18).\n\nThe fifth-year senior is aiming to become the first Creighton player to lead the BIG EAST in scoring since Doug McDermott in 2013-14. McDermott led the nation with 26.7 points per game en route to National Player of the Year accolades.\n\nKeep in mind that Scheierman has proven he can do way more than score. Two years ago at South Dakota State, Scheierman led the Summit League in the rare combination of both rebounds and assists.\n\nTriple Trouble\n\nBaylor Scheierman has made 308 three-pointers over the course of 147 collegiate games, but he'd never had seven three-pointers in the same game until Dec. 30th at Marquette.\n\nScheierman's performance was tied for 10th-most in program history. The only other Bluejay to make seven triples against a top 10 foe had been Ethan Wragge's nine trifectas at No. 4 Villanova on Jan. 20, 2014.\n\n3FG Name, Opponent Date\n\n11 Mitch Ballock vs. DePaul 03/09/19\n\n9 Kyle Korver vs. Evansville 01/15/03\n\nEthan Wragge at Villanova 01/20/14\n\n8 Tad Ackerman at Drake 01/23/95\n\nKyle Korver at Xavier 12/31/02\n\nTerrell Taylor vs. Florida 03/15/02\n\nIsaiah Zierden at DePaul 01/17/16\n\nMitch Ballock vs. Marquette 12/14/20\n\nRyan Hawkins at Georgetown 02/12/22\n\n7 Gary Swain vs. Nebraska-Omaha 12/11/86\n\nRyan Sears vs. Wyoming 12/06/97\n\nKyle Korver vs. Notre Dame 11/26/02\n\nKyle Korver vs. Fresno State 02/22/03\n\nNate Funk at Nebraska 11/18/06\n\nBooker Woodfox at Saint Joseph's 12/06/08\n\nEthan Wragge at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\nDoug McDermott vs. DePaul 03/13/14\n\nCole Huff vs. Seton Hall 03/10/16\n\nTy-Shon Alexander vs. Clemson 11/21/18\n\nMitch Ballock at Nebraska 12/08/18\n\nMarcus Zegarowski vs. Butler 02/23/20\n\nMitch Ballock at Seton Hall 01/27/21\n\nTrey Alexander vs. DePaul 12/25/22\n\nTrey Alexander vs. Georgetown 03/01/23\n\nBaylor Scheierman at Marquette 12/30/23\n\nFool Me Once...But Nine Times?\n\nCreighton has met or exceeded its preseason BIG EAST prognostication all but one year since joining the league in 2013, as seen below.\n\nLast year marked the seventh straight year that Creighton has finished in fourth place or better.\n\nCreighton's BIG EAST Preseason Poll History\n\nYear Preseason Actual Preseason All-BIG EAST\n\n2013-14 3rd 2nd Doug McDermott (1st)\n\n2014-15 9th T-9th -\n\n2015-16 9th 6th -\n\n2016-17 3rd T-3rd Maurice Watson Jr. (1st); Marcus Foster (HM)\n\n2017-18 5th T-3rd Marcus Foster (1st); Khyri Thomas (HM)\n\n2018-19 9th T-3rd Martin Krampelj (HM)\n\n2019-20 7th T-1st Ty-Shon Alexander (1st)\n\n2020-21 2nd 2nd Marcus Zegarowski (1st); Mitch Ballock (2nd)\n\n2021-22 8th 4th -\n\n2022-23 1st 3rd Ryan Kalkbrenner (1st); Arthur Kaluma (2nd)\n\nRyan Nembhard (2nd); Baylor Scheierman (HM)\n\n2023-24 2nd ??

He notched a career-high seven rejections on Jan. 20 in a triple-OT win at Seton Hall.\n\nThat's now 11 times in his Bluejay career that he's had five or more rejections. During his four years at Creighton, all his teammates have combined for one such game, a five-swat effort by Fredrick King last year in Las Vegas. Kalkbrenner is the only Creighton player with multiple games of five or more swats since the Bluejays joined the BIG EAST in 2013 as King, Jacob Epperson and Justin Patton have each done it once.\n\nKalkbrenner's 254 career blocked shots rank third among the nation's active players.\n\nIn January, Kalkbrenner had four or more blocks in four straight games, Creighton's longest such streak since Benoit Benjamin did it in an incredible 12 straight games from Jan. 12-, Feb. 20, 1985. The streak featured games of 8, 10, 5, 4, 7, 12, 6, 5, 5, 6, 4 and 4 blocks.\n\nSeeing Three's\n\nCreighton has made 14 or more three-pointers in five different games this year, tied for fifth-most nationally. It's already tied for the second-most games of 14 three-pointers in any year under Greg McDermott, trailing only the 2018-19 squad that did it eight times in 35 games.\n\nCreighton owns four different games this season in which it has made 10 or more three-pointers than its opponent, which is also second-most behind Liberty (5).\n\nThe Bluejays have had three different games this season in which they've made 10 or more triples before halftime.\n\nCreighton has made three or more three-pointers in all but three halves this season.\n\nCircling The Target\n\nBenoit Benjamin has the only three triple-doubles in Creighton history, but each one consisted of 10 or more points, rebounds and blocks.\n\nThough that means Creighton's never had a traditional points/rebound/assist triple-double, it seems like both Trey Alexander and Baylor Scheierman are flirting with one seemingly every time out.\n\nHere's a look at games this season when those men have had at least six points, six rebounds and six assists.\n\n6+ Points, 6+ Rebounds, 6+ Assists This Season\n\nName Opponent Pts.

The only better game was when it shot 22-for-26 (.846) in a March 2, 2013 win over Wichita State in CU's final regular-season game as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference.\n\nCentury Mark\n\nCreighton's 109 point effort on Dec. 9 vs. Central Michigan was the 25th time under Greg McDermott that Creighton has scored 100 or more points.\n\nThat ranks third-most among all Power 5/BIG EAST teams nationally in that span, trailing only North Carolina (37) and Iowa (26).\n\nNo other BIG EAST team has cracked the century mark more than 12 times since 2010-11.\n\nGreg McDermott's teams at Northern Iowa (153 games) and Iowa State (127 games) never scored more than 100 points in any game.\n\nRoad Dubs\n\nBefore its Dec. 13 loss at UNLV, Creighton had started 2-0 on the road this season, doing so in impressive fashion in both games.\n\nOn Nov. 30 Creighton beat Oklahoma State 79-65, its second-biggest non-conference home loss since 1978.\n\nFour days later on Dec. 3, Creighton won 89-60 at Nebraska, handing the Cornhuskers their largest non-conference home loss since 1938.\n\nIt's the first time that Creighton has won its first two true road games since 2016-17, when the Jays won their first five road contests.\n\nIt's also just the 12th time in the last 50 seasons that CU has won each of its first two true road games.

They shot 14-for-16 from the field, including 9-for-11 from three-point range. Both Miller and Traudt finished off a four-point play.\n\nFor the season Miller leads the BIG EAST with 46.4 percent marksmanship from three-point land while Traudt is sixth at 41.7 percent.\n\nScheierman's Week Earns Honors\n\nBaylor Scheierman was named the BIG EAST Player of the Week and Oscar Robertson U.S. Basketball Writers Association National Player of the Week on Dec. 4th after helping the Bluejays to a pair of double-digit road wins over Power 5 teams.\n\nScheierman averaged 22.5 points and 9.0 rebounds during the week, sinking nine three-pointers.\n\nScheierman had 21 points, eight rebounds and two steals in a BIG EAST – Big 12 Battle victory at Oklahoma State. The 79-65 loss was OSU's second-largest non-conference home loss in 45 years.\n\nThe Aurora, Neb,. product concluded his week by scoring 20 of his game-high 24 points in the first half of Creighton's 89-60 win over Nebraska, matching its largest margin of victory ever over its in-state rival. Scheierman made six three-pointers in the first half to remain (at the time) the nation's only player with three or more three-pointers in every team game this season.\n\nScheierman contributed 10 rebounds for his 40th career double-double, which also moved him over 1,000 career rebounds. The loss was Nebraska's largest in a non-conference home game since 1938.\n\nBig Half Baylor\n\nBaylor Scheierman has had at least 20 points before halftime twice this season.\n\nHe had 21 points in the first 20 minutes against Loyola Chicago on Nov. 22, then poured in 20 points in the first half on Dec. 3 at Nebraska. Scheierman is the first Bluejay with multiple games of 20+ points at halftime in the same season since Marcus Foster did it three times in 2017-18 (22 vs. UT Arlington, 21 vs. Butler, 20 vs. Georgetown).\n\nFor the year, Scheierman leads Creighton with 9.80 points per game before halftime. No Creighton player has averaged more than 10 points per first half since Doug McDermott averaged 14.0 points per first half in 2013-14, a season that saw McDermott lead the nation in scoring.\n\nOn The Triple\n\nBaylor Scheierman drained six three-pointers before halftime on Dec. 3 at Nebraska.\n\nNo Creighton player had done that since Trey Alexander had six triples in the first half vs. Georgetown on March 1, 2023.\n\nIn case you're wondering, the Creighton record for three-pointers in a half is eight, done in a pair of memorable victories.\n\nEthan Wragge made eight three-pointers in a 96-68 win at No. 4 Villanova in 2014, while Terrell Taylor made eight after a scoreless first half in a double-overtime win vs. No. 15 Florida in 2002, though some of those trifectas came during the overtime sessions.\n\nAin't Life Grand?\n\nBaylor Scheierman owns 1,944 points, 1,102 rebounds, 519 assists and has made 308 career three-pointers in 147 total games when you combine his Creighton and South Dakota State stats.\n\nCreighton's only other players to reach 1,000 career rebounds (only at Creighton) have been Paul Silas (1,751), Bob Harstad (1,126), Doug McDermott (1,088) and Benoit Benjamin (1,005).\n\nIf you're curious, how many games it took to get to 1,000 rebounds for each man, we've got you covered:\n\nGames to 1,000 Rebounds\n\nName GP Opponent, Date\n\nPaul Silas 47 at Utah State, 2/23/63\n\nBenoit Benjamin 89 at Bradley, 3/5/85\n\nBob Harstad 115 Siena, 2/3/91\n\nDoug McDermott 132 DePaul, 2/7/14\n\nBaylor Scheierman* 135 at Nebraska, 12/3/23\n\n*includes games at South Dakota State\n\n1,000+ Rebounds, 274+ 3FG Nationally, Since 1992-93\n\n**Stats earned at Division I schools only**\n\nName, School(s) REB 3FG\n\nBaylor Scheierman, SDSU/Creighton 1,102 308\n\nDoug McDermott, Creighton 1,088 274\n\n1,050+ Rebounds, 500 Assists Nationally, Since 1992-93\n\n**Stats earned at Division I schools only**\n\nName, School(s) REB AST\n\nBrian Voelkel, Vermont 1,168 679\n\nJohn Konchar, IPFW 1,149 553\n\nBaylor Scheierman, SDSU/Creighton 1,102 519\n\nCan't Stop Scheierman\n\nBaylor Scheierman made a three-point basket in all 37 games he played last season and each of his first 11 contests this season, stretching his streak dating to last year to 58 in a row if you include his final 10 games at South Dakota State in 2021-22. The streak ended on Dec. 20, 2023 vs. Villanova, when Scheierman went 0-for-7 from deep.\n\nScheierman's streak of 48 straight as a Bluejay was the longest streak in Creighton history, 15 more than Ty-Shon Alexander's 33.\n\nScheierman was also the only player in the nation who had made three or more three-pointers in every game his team has played this season until the streak was snapped on Dec. 9 vs. Central Michigan.\n\nConsecutive Games With A 3-Pointer, Creighton History\n\nStreak Name Dates of Streak\n\n48 Baylor Scheierman Nov. 7, 2022 - Dec. 16, 2023\n\n33 Ty-Shon Alexander Feb. 27, 2018-March 6, 2019\n\n31 Booker Woodfox Nov. 25, 2008-March 23, 2009\n\n28 Kyle Korver Feb. 4, 2001-Feb. 6, 2002\n\n27 Kyle Korver Feb. 13, 2002-Jan. 20, 2003\n\nScheierman Drains 300th Trey\n\nBaylor Scheierman has made 308 three-pointers in his college career, doing so at a 39.0 percent clip.\n\nScheierman also owns 1,944 points, 1,102 rebounds, 519 assists and 140 career steals.\n\nPer Basketball-Reference.com, Scheierman is the nation's only player in the last 30 years with career totals of at least 300 three-pointers, 500 assists and 1,000 rebounds.\n\nScheierman is one of 28 players since 1992-93 with 500 or more assists and 300 or more three-pointers. Scheierman's 1,102 rebounds are well ahead of the next-most (658 by ASU/Toledo guard Marreon Jackson).\n\nAmong the nation's active players Scheierman is fifth in rebounds, trailing only Armando Bacot (North Carolina), Fardaws Aimaq (California), Norchad Omier (Miami Fla.) and Enrique Freeman (Akron).\n\nRoad Openers\n\nCreighton is 7-7 under Greg McDermott in its first true road game of the season.\n\nThe road opener has been the barometer for Creighton's postseason plans in the previous 13 years. Creighton has made the NCAA Tournament all six times it has won the road opener, and missed the NCAA Tournament four of the other six years where a postseason was contested.\n\nThat's encouraging since CU defeated Oklahoma State 79-65 in its road opener this winter.\n\nCU would have made the 2020 NCAA Tournament that was canceled even though it lost its road opener that year.\n\nCreighton in Road Openers, Last 14 Years\n\nYear Opponent Score CU in NCAA's?\n\n2010-11 Northwestern L 52-65 No (CBI)\n\n2011-12 UAB W 70-60 Yes\n\n2012-13 Nebraska W 64-42 Yes\n\n2013-14 Saint Joseph's W 83-79 Yes\n\n2014-15 Tulsa L 64-77 No\n\n2015-16 #14 Indiana L 65-86 No (NIT)\n\n2016-17 Nebraska W 77-62 Yes\n\n2017-18 #20 Northwestern W 92-88 Yes\n\n2018-19 Nebraska L 75-94 No (NIT)\n\n2019-20 Michigan L 69-79 No (Postseason CCD)\n\n2020-21 #5 Kansas L 72-73 Yes\n\n2021-22 Nebraska W 77-69 Yes\n\n2022-23 #2 Texas L 67-72 Yes\n\n2023-24 Oklahoma State W 79-65 TBD\n\nAmong The Best...EVER!\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner has made 604 of 916 career shots, putting him at 65.9 percent overall.

McDermott did it the first six games of his senior season in 2013-14 and went on to be named National Player of the Year that season.\n\nAlexander is the first Bluejay to score 20 points or more in four consecutive games at any time of year since Marcus Foster did it in seven consecutive contests from Jan. 16-Feb. 10, 2018.\n\nBahamas Bounce\n\nCreighton got a jump start on the season with nine practices in July before heading to the Bahamas to play in three games during the first week of August.\n\nCreighton won all three games by 14 points or more, averaged 98.3 points, and outrebounded foes by 21.3 caroms per contest.\n\nTrey Alexander led CU by averaging 20.0 points before missing the final contest, but Ryan Kalkbrenner (11.0 ppg.), Baylor Scheierman (10.0 ppg.) and Fredrick King (10.0 ppg.) also scored at a double-digit clip.\n\nSteven Ashworth led CU with 15 assists, King and Brock Vice had a team-high 18 rebounds and Kalkbrenner topped the team with 10 swats.\n\nA 2019 trip to Australia helped the Bluejays open the year 12-2.\n\nA 2015 trip to Italy helped the Bluejays start the season 5-1.\n\nA 2011 trip to the Bahamas helped get the Bluejays ready for a 7-0 start.\n\nA 2007 trip to Canada paid dividends as Creighton started 5-0.\n\nIn 2003, the Bluejays also went to Canada and started the subsequent season 12-0.\n\nWho's Back?\n\nWith Creighton returning seven of the 13 men who appeared in a game last season, it's no surprise that a similar ratio of the production from 2022-23 is also gone. Below is a breakdown of what is back:\n\nStat Returners Departures\n\nBlocks 126 (82.9%) 26 (17.1%)\n\nRebounds 860 (67.9%) 411 (32.1%)\n\n3FG Made 207 (64.9%) 112 (35.1%)\n\nPoints 1833 (64.8%) 995 (35.2%)\n\nSteals 119 (64.3%) 66 (35.7%)\n\nMinutes 4693 (63.0%) 2757 (37.0%)\n\nStarts 111 (60.0%) 74 (40.0%)\n\nCharges Taken 16 (59.3%) 11 (40.7%)\n\nAssists 308 (53.0%) 273 (47.0%)\n\nA Dozen Will Do\n\nCreighton finished 14-6 in the BIG EAST last season and is the only school in the BIG EAST with 12 or more league wins each of the previous four seasons.\n\nAmong the other BIG EAST or \"Power 5\" Conference schools, Kansas, UCLA and Virginia have also done it the previous four years.\n\nCreighton has now owned a .500 mark or better in league play 27 times in the last 28 seasons.\n\nThe only BIG EAST teams to finish .500 or better in league play each of the previous six seasons are Creighton, Villanova and Seton Hall.\n\nPreseason Top 10\n\nThe Creighton men's basketball team was ranked eighth in the Associated Press Preseason Top 25 poll, its highest preseason AP ranking ever. That's one spot better than the previous best, done last year, when the Bluejays started the season ranked ninth. CU is ranked 17th in the January 22nd AP poll.\n\nThe announcement marks just the sixth time in program history the writers have voted CU to the top-25 in the preseason, joining 2006-07 (No. 19), 2012-13 (No. 16) and 2016-17 (No. 22), 2020-21 (No. 11) and 2022-23 (No. 9). All five of those teams would end up in the NCAA Tournament, with the last two making the Sweet 16 and last year's club reaching the Elite Eight.\n\nCreighton has been ranked in the Top 10 on 27 different occasions in program history, with all but one of those occasions happening under head coach Greg McDermott. Creighton's best ranking in program history is seventh, done five times (Jan. 16, 2017, March 10, 2020, March 18, 2020, Jan. 7, 2021 and Nov. 28, 2022).\n\nCreighton has now been ranked 132 times in program history, with 105 of those under the direction of McDermott. Creighton is 165-68 all-time as a ranked team, including a 131-56 mark under McDermott. Creighton has now been ranked at least one week in 10 of McDermott's 14 seasons on The Hilltop after doing it just five different seasons in program history before his 2010 arrival.\n\nCreighton is one of four schools to be ranked in the preseason top-10 each of the past two seasons, joining Kansas, Duke and Houston.\n\nAlong with No. 5 Marquette, No. 6 Connecticut and No. 8 Creighton, this year marked the first time since 2011-12 that the BIG EAST had three Preseason Top-10 teams.\n\nCreighton was also eighth in the preseason USA Today Coaches poll, its best preseason mark ever. CU is 16th in the Jan. 22nd Coaches poll.\n\nPreseason BIG EAST Poll\n\nThe Creighton men's basketball team was picked to finish second in the BIG EAST Conference in the annual survey of league coaches, which was unveiled as part of BIG EAST Media Day.\n\nIt's the second time in Creighton's 11 years in the BIG EAST Conference that the Bluejays have been picked second, as the 2020-21 squad was also picked second (and eventually finished second). The Bluejays also had three players receive recognition on one of the Preseason All-BIG EAST teams, tied with preseason favorite Marquette for the most in the league.\n\nThe Bluejays collected four first-place votes and earned 92 points in the poll, trailing only Marquette's seven first-place votes and 96 overall points. Defending national champion Connecticut was tabbed third with 79 points, just ahead of Villanova's 76 for fourth place. Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino's first St. John's team garnered 59 points to be chosen fifth, just ahead of Xavier (57) and Providence (51). The bottom four teams in the poll are Georgetown (34), Seton Hall (30), Butler (16) and DePaul (15).\n\nCreighton finished 24-13 overall and 14-6 in BIG EAST play last season and are the only league team to return three of its scorers that averaged at least a dozen points per game. The Bluejays won three NCAA Tournament games to advance to its first Elite Eight since 1941.\n\nIn 2023-24, Creighton will be led by senior center Ryan Kalkbrenner, who is a Preseason First Team All-BIG EAST selection. Kalkbrenner becomes the first player in program history to earn Preseason First Team All-BIG EAST honors multiple times, and along with Preseason Player of the Year Tyler Kolek from Marquette was one of two men to be named on every ballot.\n\nJoining Kalkbrenner with the Preseason First Team All-BIG EAST acclaim was junior guard Trey Alexander. Alexander was an Honorable Mention All-BIG EAST choice at the end of last season, as was teammate Baylor Scheierman. A senior guard from Aurora, Neb., Scheierman earned Preseason Second Team All-BIG EAST plaudits in 2023-24.\n\nThis year marks the second time that Creighton has had more than two players land on the Preseason All-BIG EAST Team, and comes 12 months after Creighton had four men listed prior to the 2022-23 campaign. Creighton last had two men named Preseason First Team All-Conference in its Missouri Valley Conference days in 2006-07 (Anthony Tolliver, Nate Funk).\n\nKolek was named 2023-24 BIG EAST Preseason Player of the Year by a vote of the league's head coaches, which comes as little surprise after the point guard was named 2023 BIG EAST Player of the Year and BIG EAST Tournament MVP after leading the Golden Eagles to both the regular-season and tournament titles. Connecticut guard Stephon Castle was chosen BIG EAST Preseason Freshman of the Year. The coaches, who were not permitted to select their own players, also chose an All-BIG EAST First Team, All-BIG EAST Second Team and All-BIG EAST Honorable Mention.\n\nCreighton has matched or exceeded its preseason projection in all but one season since joining the BIG EAST in 2013-14, the best showing in the league in that time. The Bluejays are seeking an eighth straight finish in the top four of the league standings. CU's team two years ago was predicted to finish eighth in the BIG EAST, then ended up in fourth. Four years ago, a team picked seventh in the BIG EAST's preseason poll went 13-5 in league play to share its first league title with Villanova and Seton Hall. That Bluejay team ended the year ranked seventh in the entire nation.\n\nFour Of A Kind\n\nCreighton has four players that were named to a Preseason Watch List in Steven Ashworth (Bob Cousy Point Guard), Trey Alexander (Jerry West Shooting Guard), Baylor Scheierman (Julius Erving Small Forward) and Ryan Kalkbrenner (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Center).\n\nCreighton is one of six schools to have four men listed at a position, joining Duke, Kansas, Kentucky, Marquette and UConn.\n\nThose same four men were named to CBS Sports Preseason Top 100 And 1 player listings, with Kalkbrenner (5), Alexander (12), Scheierman (26) and Ashworth (76) making CU the only school with three of the top 30 players or four of the top 76 players. Kansas and Duke were the only other teams with four players listed in the Top 100 And 1.\n\nLast but not least, both Alexander and Kalkbrenner were two of 20 players on the NABC's Preseason Division I Player of the Year Watch List. The only other schools with two players on that list were Duke and USC.\n\nDowntown Duo\n\nOnly two players nationally that are returning in 2023-24 had 120+ assists, 87+ three-pointers and 38+ steals in 2022-23.\n\nBaylor Scheierman and Steven Ashworth.\n\nBoth are playing for Creighton this season.\n\nLet's Go On A Run\n\nCreighton has won at least one NCAA Tournament game in 2021, 2022 and 2023. That makes CU one of seven teams in the country to have a win in each of the last three NCAA Tournaments, joining Arkansas, Baylor, Gonzaga, Houston, Kansas and UCLA.\n\nThe only other time that Creighton has won an NCAA Tournament game in consecutive seasons came in 2012, 2013 and 2014, also under Greg McDermott.\n\nCreighton is one of six schools with 20 or more wins in each of the last eight seasons, joining Belmont, Gonzaga, Houston, Kansas and Oregon.\n\nCreighton is one of seven teams to post 22 or more wins in each of the last four seasons, joining Baylor, Gonzaga, Houston, Liberty, San Diego State and Southern California.\n\nCreighton is one of just eight teams to have reached at least two of the last three Sweet 16s. Gonzaga, Houston and UCLA have done it each of the last three seasons, while Alabama, Creighton, Michigan and Villanova have done it twice each.\n\n23 of 25 Seasons With 20 Wins\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 23 of the previous 25 seasons, a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust two schools have had 20 or more wins each of the last 25 years: Gonzaga and Kansas. Duke has done it 24 times, Creighton and Kentucky 23 times.\n\nMost 20-Win Seasons, Previous 25 Seasons\n\nTeam 20-Win Seasons 2022-23 W-L\n\nGonzaga 25 31-6\n\nKansas 25 28-8\n\nDuke 24 27-9\n\nCreighton 23 24-13\n\nKentucky 23 22-12\n\nDynamic Duo\n\nCreighton is also one of eight schools to have men's and women's basketball programs to both own 22 wins or more each of the previous two seasons, a list that includes Creighton, Gonzaga, Liberty, Princeton, Tennessee, Texas, Toledo and UConn.\n\nThis season, Creighton was one of eight teams with a preseason top-25 squad on both the men's and women's side, joining Baylor, Connecticut, Illinois, North Carolina, Southern California, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nThe only five schools to be ranked in the preseason men's and women's basketball Top 25 of the AP Poll both this season and last season are Baylor, Creighton, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nCreighton is one of 11 schools to make the NCAA Tournament in both men's and women's basketball each of the past two seasons, a list that consists of Arizona, Baylor, Creighton, Gonzaga, Indiana, Iowa, Iowa State, Miami (Fla.), Tennessee, Texas and UConn.\n\nThe only schools with at-large bids in each of the previous two years in both men's and women's basketball are Baylor, Creighton, Indiana and Miami (Fla.).\n\nBig Deficits, No Big Deal\n\nCreighton owns 27 victories since the start of the 2010-11 season after trailing by double-figures at some point.\n\nThirteen of those 27 comebacks have come away from home.\n\nIf you're curious, CU's largest comeback win since 2000 came on Jan. 28, 2006, when the Jays trailed 25-6 early before rallying to beat Wichita State on a buzzer-beater by Anthony Tolliver.\n\nCU's Double-Digit Comebacks Under McDermott\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n16 at Seton Hall 01/27/21\n\n16 SIU Edwardsville 11/27/21\n\n15 Arkansas-Pine Bluff 11/09/21\n\n14 Evansville 02/21/12\n\n14 vs. San Diego State 03/17/22\n\n13 at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\n13 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n13 #22 Xavier 12/23/20\n\n12 Saint Joseph's 12/11/10\n\n12 at DePaul 01/17/16\n\n12 East Tennessee State 11/11/18\n\n11 at Wichita State 12/31/11\n\n11 Northern Iowa 01/10/12\n\n11 vs. Alabama 03/16/12\n\n11 vs. Ole Miss 11/21/16\n\n11 vs. Connecticut 03/12/21\n\n11 DePaul 01/22/22\n\n10 UAB 11/14/12\n\n10 vs. Drake 03/02/12\n\n10 at Nebraska 12/07/14\n\n10 South Dakota 12/09/14\n\n10 St. John's 01/03/18\n\n10 at DePaul 02/07/18\n\n10 Bemidji State 02/13/18\n\nRelease, Rotation, Splash, Repeat\n\nCreighton has made at least one three-pointer in 1,005 straight games. The streak is the nation's 10th-longest active streak.\n\nCreighton's last game without a three-pointer came at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993, when the Jays were 0-for-5. Creighton's last win without making a three-point basket came on March 3, 1991 when the Jays went 0-for-2 from three-point range in a 71-66 win over Southern Illinois in the championship game of the MVC Tournament.\n\nBelow is a list of the nation's longest active three-point streaks.\n\nLongest Active 3-Point Streaks (1/24)\n\nRk.

CU's 100th win came on Nov. 17, 2010, a 63-58 win over Louisiana.\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 27,266-22,792 in games at CHI Health Center Omaha, an average margin of 12.86 points per game. Creighton has not trailed 90 different times.\n\nIncredibly, Creighton hasn't trailed in its home opener in 10 of the past 23 seasons (2000-01, 2002-03, 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2009-10, 2011-12, 2014-15, 2016-17 and 2019-20).\n\nCreighton is also 32-36 all-time in the 68 games at the arena in which it's fallen behind by double-figures at any point, 8-11 when down by 10+ points at halftime in the facility, and 41-29 when trailing at halftime at CHI Health Center Omaha.\n\nCreighton is 190-43 (.815) at CHI Health Center Omaha under Greg McDermott and hasn't trailed in 65 of those games. In that same span, CU owns a 101-9 home record (.918) vs. non-conference teams.\n\nFactor in a 17-0 home mark at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in 2002-03 and two wins at the Civic in the 2010 CIT, and the Bluejays are 306-61 (.834) at home since the start of the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nHome Run\n\nUnder Greg McDermott Creighton is averaging 80.57 points per home game (18,772 points in 233 home games), a figure that climbs to 84.37 points in non-conference home games (9,281 points in 110 home games).\n\nCreighton is 142-6 all-time at CHI Health Center Omaha when scoring 80 or points.\n\nMcDermott Ranks Second On CU Wins List\n\nGreg McDermott has 315 victories at Creighton, good for second place on CU's all-time wins list.\n\nMcDermott's .670 winning percentage is Creighton's best since Arthur A.

McDermott was a three-time All-American (2012, 2013, 2014) and consensus National Player of the Year (2014) during an incredible four-year career spanning from 2010-14.\n\nMcDermott finished his career with an NCAA-record 135 double-figure scoring games and wrapped up his time on The Hilltop with 3,150 points, which was fifth in NCAA history. He was named winner of the Oscar Robertson, John R. Wooden and Naismith trophies as the National Player of the Year in 2013-14, when he led the country in scoring and helped Creighton to a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe son of current Bluejay head coach Greg McDermott, Doug McDermott was a three-time Conference Player of the Year and remains the sport's only three-time Associated Press First Team All-American since 1985.\n\nMcDermott received his Marketing degree from Creighton in 2014 and is currently in his 10th year in the NBA, as a member of the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nMcDermott's number hangs in the rafters on the west side of the arena alongside five other Bluejay greats (#25 Kyle Korver, #30 Bob Harstad, #33 Bob Portman, #35 Paul Silas, #45 Bob Gibson).\n\nMcDermott In The NBA\n\nDoug McDermott is in his 10th year in an NBA career that saw him selected 11th overall by Denver, with stops in Chicago, Oklahoma City, New York, Dallas, Indiana and San Antonio.\n\nHe is averaging 6.2 points per game this season and shooting 44.9 percent from three-point range for the Spurs, which ranks seventh in the NBA.\n\nIn his career, McDermott has played in 630 games and averaged 9.1 points per game. He ranks 22nd in NBA history with 41.2 percent marksmanship from three-point range in his career.\n\n11 Crazy Stats on Doug McDermott\n\nWhat better time than now to remind you of some of the highlights of Doug McDermott's Creighton career?\n\n1) In 2013-14 he was honored as National Player of the Year by the USBWA (Oscar Robertson Trophy), John R. Wooden Award, Naismith Trophy, Adolph F. Rupp Trophy, Associated Press, NABC, CollegeInsider.com Lute Olson Award, Sporting News, Basketball Times, NBCSports.com, CBSSports.com, BleacherReport.com, USA Today and Dick Vitale.\n\nIn addition, he was also honored with the Senior CLASS Award that takes into account his off-court contributions.\n\n2) Doug McDermott finished his career fifth (he's currently seventh) in NCAA history with 3,150 career points.

With 6-8, 6-9, there's nothing he can't do. He can take you off the dribble. He guards, he's tough as hell guarding. He defends. He rebounds. He moves without the ball. He seals. He's the best post player that we've played against and he's the best perimeter player, and maybe one of the best passers, and he's 6-8, 6-9. I think he's as good a basketball player as I've seen.\"\n\n#ProJays\n\nFormer Creighton All-American Doug McDermott is back for a third season with the San Antonio Spurs, giving Creighton at least one NBA player in 40 of the last 41 seasons.
