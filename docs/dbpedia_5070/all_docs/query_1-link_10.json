        "text": "Frisco, TX—June 30, 2022— Pink, the vitamin and supplement brand created by women for women with a cause, returned to partner with National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) for National Pink Day on June 23rd. Pink proudly stepped up to donate $5,000 to help fulfill the NBCF Mission of Helping Women Now®.\n\nPink began its partnership with NBCF in 2020. They have been strong advocates of the HOPE Kit Program as well as partners for Giving Tuesday. Their partnership has helped provide breast health education and mammography services to women at every step of their breast cancer journey.\n\n“Pink is more than a line of women’s supplements – our vision has always been advocacy for women and touching people’s lives in a meaningful way,” said Kimberly Vigliante, SVP of Wholesale Sales and Marketing. “We are honored to partner with NBCF on National Pink Day to give more women access to necessary life-saving support and services.”\n\nIn addition to signing on as the official NBCF sponsor for National Pink Day, Pink donated products for two bundle giveaways on NBCF social media platforms, including a year’s supply of its flagship Multi for Her Gummies. This nutrient-rich gummy was designed by women, for women to ensure they receive their daily essentials from A to Zinc, and is non-GMO, gluten free, dairy free, and artificial flavor free.\n\n“We are grateful to call Pink Vitamins a partner and sponsor for National Pink Day,” said Emily Millender, Senior Partnership Coordinator for NBCF. “Aside from their giving efforts, Pink threads breast cancer awareness into the core of their messaging and continues to be a strong supporter of NBCF’s mission to help provide support and hope to those affected by breast cancer.”\n\nAbout National Breast Cancer Foundation, Inc.®\n\nRecognized as one of the leading breast cancer organizations in the world, National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) is Helping Women Now® by providing early detection, education, and support services to those affected by breast cancer.
