        "text": "MCGRATH FOUNDATION LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TO SELL OVER 150,000 VIRTUAL PINK SEATS TO SUPPORT TO FAMILIES WITH BREAST CANCER\n\nMcGrath Foundation Co-Founder & President, Glenn McGrath was at the Sydney Cricket Ground today to launch the 15th NRMA Insurance Pink Test, calling on Australians to come together to make this Pink Test ‘one to remember’ and support families experiencing breast cancer.\n\nMarking the 15th Pink Test milestone, McGrath was joined by Australian Men’s Cricket Team Head Coach Andrew McDonald, who made his Test debut for Australia at the first ever Pink Test in 2009, as well as South African Cricketer, Morne Morkel who also played in the now historic match.\n\nAnnouncing that the Virtual Pink Seat campaign is back by popular demand, McGrath said all funds raised during the Pink Test will go directly to funding McGrath Breast Care Nurses to support families experiencing breast cancer.\n\n“This year marks the 15th Pink Test and with Australia’s help we want to make it one to remember.\n\n“Our goal for this Pink Test is to sell 150,000 Virtual Pink Seats which will ensure 2,100 families will have the crucial care and support of a breast care nurse this year.\n\n“Over the last couple of years, we’ve seen the Virtual Pink Seats have come to represent more than just a seat. The messages of support, memories and thanks that are shared along with the seat show just what this annual moment means to people.\n\n“With 57 people diagnosed with breast cancer in Australia every day the sad reality is that most people know someone who has been, or will be, impacted by the disease. We’re calling on people around the country to get behind our Virtual Pink Seat campaign to remember where the Pink Test all began and honour those who have been touched by breast cancer,” McGrath continued.\n\nSince the Pink Test was first established in 2009 following the passing of McGrath Foundation Co-Founder Jane McGrath, Cricket Australia, the SCG and the cricket community have continued to rally together in an outpouring of support with the Pink Test becoming a symbol of hope and unity for people with breast cancer.\n\nAndrew McDonald, Australian Men’s Cricket Team Head Coach, said, “15 years ago I made my Test debut during the first Pink Test, which was incredibly special. It’s been phenomenal to watch how this Test grows and gets pinker each year. This is my first Pink Test as Australian men’s coach and I’m proud to be here with the players to help the Foundation make it one to remember.”\n\nMorne Morkel, Former South African bowler said, “This is the first time South Africa has played at the SCG since that first Pink Test in 2009, which was fantastic to be part of. It’s really a Test match unlike any other and I love that people right across Australia and South Africa can feel part of it by buying a Virtual Pink Seat.”\n\nAlex Carey, Australian Test Cricketer, said, “The Pink Test is always a really special day in the calendar for Glenn and the McGrath Foundation, and to be a part of it last year was really special. To hand over the pink baggy caps is something that all the playing group are really happy supporting.”\n\nCricket Australia CEO, Nick Hockley said, “The NRMA Insurance Pink Test is such a recognisable highlight of the Australian sporting calendar. We are inspired by the incredible work of the McGrath Foundation and are so proud that our partnership continues to grow and provide such critical support to families affected by breast cancer.\n\n“I can’t wait to see the SCG once again dressed in pink and encourage everyone to get behind the Virtual Pink Seats campaign to help fund more McGrath Breast Care Nurses right across Australia.”\n\nSydney Cricket Ground CEO, Kerrie Mather said, “It’s an honour to host the 15th Pink Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground and we are so proud to have been a key supporter of the McGrath Foundation from the very beginning. We look forward to helping make this Pink Test one to remember, honouring the legacy of Jane McGrath and all people impacted by breast cancer.”\n\nTo help the McGrath Foundation make this Pink Test one to remember you can purchase Virtual Pink Seats for $20 each at pinktest.com.au and share them with your story across your socials. If you’re at the SCG you can make a donation to receive a limited-edition NRMA Insurance Pink Test bandana.\n\nUp to five seats, as well as group Virtual Pink Seats are available that can be personalised and shared with #PinkTest #McGrathFoundation."
