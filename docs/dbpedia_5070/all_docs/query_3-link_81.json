        "text": "Battling with breast cancer is not a desolate journey. 1 out of 19 women in Malaysia is at risk for breast cancer. Providing a safe space for the survivors can begin with a strong understanding and awareness of the condition. Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among women and with early detection, it can help increase their survival rate.\n\nEmpowering everyone, not just women, is a crucial approach to improving the prevention and disease prevalence. It can start with us and even through this article. With more exposure and information, breast cancer awareness and screening practices can be broadly spread.\n\nSigns & Symptoms\n\nObserving the appearance of the breast for symptoms should be the first step to promote early detection and could be a life-changing approach for the survivors. Here are some details in inspecting unusual symptoms of the breast:\n\nBreast Self-Examination\n\nBreast Self-Examination (BSE) is a practical and convenient method to examine breast tissue. It is recommended to practice this self-examination at least once a month for all age groups of menstruating women. Below are the simple step-by-step for the breast self-examination:\n\nWhile not all lumps are cancerous, if there are any signs or symptoms presented, consult your doctor or health expert immediately for further examination.\n\nBreast cancer screening tests\n\nEarly detection may not be able to completely remove the cancer, but having frequent tests done can provide an easier treatment and better prognosis.\n\n1. Mammogram\n\nMammogram is an early detection tool for unusual lumps or tumor that are too small to be felt through touch. Regular mammograms are recommended for women, typically starting around the age of 40, and they may be performed more frequently for individuals with certain risk factors or family history of breast cancer.\n\n2. Clinical Breast Examination (CBE)\n\nExperts like doctors, nurses, and other trained medical personnel will make a physical inspection of the patient’s breast and examine the overall breast shape and condition. The examination will consist of their visual inspections, palpation with their hands, and nipple evaluation.\n\nThe awareness we built today may not necessarily cure cancer as a whole, but the knowledge we gain will guarantee a better and more efficient approach toward disease prevention. Reach out to experts and doctors with just one click here and get a direct consultation through our BookDoc app if you have further inquiries or concerns.\n\nAmirah, Dietitian\n\nReference:\n\n1.
