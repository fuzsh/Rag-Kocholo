        "text": "Coral reefs are hubs of biodiversity, rivaling rainforests on land. They provide shelter for marine plants and animals, form a buffer between land and sea, bolster the global economy and are a source for new, potentially life-saving medicines. Despite their importance, coral reefs cover less than 1% of the entire ocean — and they are rapidly disappearing. Reefs are threatened by over-fishing, harvesting, development and pollution. The damaging effects of climate change, such as ocean acidification and warming waters, also make corals more susceptible to bleaching and disease.\n\nHalf of the world’s corals have died in the last 100 years alone, and three quarters of the ocean’s remaining coral reefs are expected to experience annual bleaching events by the end of the century. The Caribbean has already lost 98% of its elkhorn coral.\n\nAs coral populations are threatened and die, fewer individuals are left to reproduce, causing these populations to become less genetically diverse. Genetic diversity is critical for wildlife health, especially for animals that are impacted by a changing environment. A biodiverse population of coral is better equipped to endure environmental pressures, like warming waters, because it is more likely that some individuals will have genetic variations to help them adapt and survive.\n\nMaintaining genetic diversity among corals can be challenging. The adults are attached to a sea bottom, while the floating larvae are restricted by ocean currents and the space available to settle. This limits the number of genes that can be shared among corals. For example, the eastern population of elkhorn coral in Curaçao would not naturally meet and reproduce with the western population in Florida. One population might have advantageous traits that could help corals survive warming waters, so how can two separate populations come together?\n\nScientists are creating these long-distance romances by taking coral sperm from one area and introducing it to coral eggs from another area. This process is called assisted gene flow and was first demonstrated with coral on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. However, corals from the same species that live far apart don’t always spawn at the same time. To overcome this obstacle, Smithsonian scientists developed an advanced reproductive technique, called sperm cryopreservation.\n\nThey first collect and freeze coral sperm to preserve it. Then, they can transport the cryopreserved sperm, thaw it and introduce it to fresh eggs when the time is right. For the first time, the researchers tested assisted gene flow on corals using frozen sperm to match the eastern and western populations of elkhorn corals. The coral sperm that they used had been frozen and stored for nearly 10 years, and the young elkhorns that resulted are thriving under human care in Florida. The success of this first trial introduces a brand-new tool for coral restoration and the future survival of the ocean’s reefs."
