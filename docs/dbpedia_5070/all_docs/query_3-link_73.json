I always enjoy those, even if they do mean I’m about to carry a human and teach a lesson. Puffing myself up and laying my ears back I thunder toward the gate and the human standing there. The rest of the herd parts to let me through. They honor my lead mare status and know to make room. They wouldn’t dare try to usurp those treats.\n\nThe human woman stands her ground, smiling. Hmm. I push past her, then circle back for what she holds in her hand. She drops her head a bit, taking a step backward. Ah-ha! Maybe we can communicate after all.\n\nHalter. Hmm. The first test. One arm goes around my neck while I warily munch alfalfa pellets from the other hand. This one seems to know what she’s doing. Maybe I won’t run off. Maybe we’ll become friends.\n\nMy human generally sends people she works with out to the fields to test their fear levels and experience with horses. She asks if their training included tacking up, or if they are used to hopping onto an already saddled pony and riding around a ring. I didn’t hear their first conversation, as I was busy out under the trees. I didn’t need to hear. I have my own ways of making sense of things."
