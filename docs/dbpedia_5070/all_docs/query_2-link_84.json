        "text": "She has been referred to as Australia's Angelina Jolie, but as well as them both carrying the faulty BRCA1 gene, Pink Hope founder Krystal Barter also shares the Oscar-winner's influence and star pulling power.\n\nFor the charity's latest project, Bright Pink Lipstick Day, a social media campaign that encourages more people to discuss their hereditary health, the 30-year-old preventative cancer activist enlisted the support of Margie Abbott, a Victoria's Secret model and a usually publicity shy Rinehart sibling.\n\nWhile chasing the family dog Maisie – both dressed for the occasion in hot pink ensembles – Ms Abbott welcomed a throng of media and fashion industry personalities to Kirribilli House, including Bauer Media publisher Sebastian Kadas, WAG and soon-to-be reality TV contestant Kyly Clarke and fashion designer Carla Zampatti, to spread the word about the lipstick movement set to launch on September 26.\n\n\"I don't think breakfast at Kirribilli has ever been this glamorous,\" Ms Abbott said while unveiling the campaign's official pink lipstick, created by Victoria's Secret model Jess Hart for her Luma cosmetics line.\n\nThe 56-year-old mother of three, who only recently discovered her grandmother died of breast cancer, stressed the importance of sharing family health history.\n\n\"As a mother, I encourage my daughters to be proactive with their health. I want them to be aware of the importance of regular breast checks, pap smears and mammograms.\"\n\nMs Barter, who launched the charity in 2009 while in a hospital bed recovering from a preventative double mastectomy – fours years before Jolie's surgery – is now working towards expanding her cancer support network and establishing an online genetic counselling service.\n\n\"More than 240,000 women and men are at risk of hereditary illness or carry a genetic fault that could lead to breast, ovarian, prostate and other cancers,\" Ms Barter said. \"The issue for many carriers of a hereditary gene is that they're not aware of their family history, and often many find out about their condition when it's too late.\"\n\nAnother Pink Hope ambassador for Bright Pink Lipstick Day is Bianca Rinehart, daughter of mining magnate Gina Rinehart.\n\n\"I speak to her all the time,\" Barter told Fairfax Media. \"She's amazing, really lovely, and she just adores her son, talks about him all the time.\"\n\nRinehart, together with her childhood friend and former British Vogue art director Steph Adams, approached Pink Hope about participating in the project.\n\nThe oldest daughter of Australia's richest person, who is estranged from her mother and this year made an attempt to run the family trust, lost her great aunt Alix Mellowes and her grandmother Hope Hancock to breast cancer in 1983."
