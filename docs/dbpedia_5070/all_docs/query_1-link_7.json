        "text": "October marks the beginning of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and we at West Jefferson Medical Center are here to show our support. Louisiana has one of the highest death rates of breast cancer in the country, which is why we’re on a mission to change the statistics by caring for the women in New Orleans and beyond.\n\nIf you’re wondering what you can do to increase awareness, we believe education can go a long way. That’s why we’re highlighting what Breast Cancer Awareness Month is all about, including the importance of breast cancer screenings and helpful tips. Continue reading and share this information with the women in your life to help them prevent breast cancer and show support for their community.\n\nThe iconic pink ribbon\n\nShould you decide to attend a breast cancer awareness event this October, you’ll see hundreds of people wearing pink ribbons. In 1992, Evelyn H. Lauder co-created this iconic design to highlight the growing need for national funding for breast cancer research. Since then, the ribbon has been a symbol of hope and unity for people everywhere affected by breast cancer.\n\nTo show your love and support for those affected by breast cancer, wear a pink ribbon to honor survivors and raise breast cancer awareness!\n\nBreast cancer screenings\n\nTime is precious, and so is your health. No matter how busy life gets, women should set aside 30 minutes for a screening mammogram each year. This type of breast imaging uses low-dose X-rays to detect breast cancer at earlier stages when it’s most treatable. When the exam is over, you can get back to your day!\n\nIf further tests are needed, ultrasound or MRI may be an option. At West Jefferson Medical Center, we have a comprehensive diagnostic center that offers 2D and 3D mammograms, breast ultrasounds, bone density scans and more.\n\nWhile screenings are typically done yearly, we also encourage women to perform a breast self-exam monthly to check for new lumps or changes in the look and feel of their breasts. The National Breast Cancer Foundation offers simple instructions on how to perform a breast self-exam.\n\nWhen to get a screening and why\n\nOne of the biggest motivators behind Breast Cancer Awareness Month is to help women know when it’s time to get screened. You can let the women in your life know to start annual screenings by age 45, according to the American Cancer Society, or possibly earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer.\n\nHere are just a few of the benefits of annual screenings:\n\nEarly detection. Radiologists use screening mammograms to find possible signs of breast cancer before you have symptoms.\n\nFinding changes. Radiologists can compare previous mammograms to the current one to find breast cancer or changes. They'll be able to tell how recently any abnormal lumps or masses may have formed.\n\nLowering anxiety. By going in for your annual screening, you’ll stay in the know about your breast health and won’t spend as much time worrying about your risk.\n\nWhen it’s time for your screening mammogram, dress in comfortable clothing and a shirt that can be easily slipped off. To ensure accuracy, remember not to wear any powders, deodorants or perfumes. Skin and hygiene products can show up as small white spots in the mammogram images and can affect test results.\n\nAt West Jefferson Medical Center, we offer healthcare that cares about you. That’s why we’re proud to support women with compassionate and comprehensive breast care."
