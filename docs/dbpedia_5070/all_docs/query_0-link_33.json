After nearly 20 years as our auctioneer, he has played a vital role in raising extraordinary funds during our events.\n\nHe tells us that he is proud to stand on our stage not only as an auctioneer but as an advocate in the fight against cancer. He knows the pain this disease can cause after losing his brother, sister & father to cancer.\n\nHowever, LeGrande’s generosity is not limited to the fight against cancer, he has supported nearly every charity in the Capital Region and beyond. During his 50+ year career as an auctioneer, LeGrande has raised over $28 MILLION through 2,200 (and counting) philanthropic events in our community.\n\nWhen we named the Beacon of Hope Award after Jeanne, she defined the future recipients as people who “walk the walk, open doors & open their heart.” When thinking of a perfect honoree to celebrate our 20th anniversary, LeGrande was a clear choice as he continues to be a Beacon of Hope, walking the walk, opening doors and his heart to our entire community.\n\nThank you to our 2024 Planning Committee\n\nChair- Lisa Taber\n\nAmanda De Vito, Catherine Hover, Chris Diamantopoulos, Colleen Kohler, Gabby Calabrese, Jaime Kazlo, Jennifer MacPhee, Karen Heath, Matthew Pappis, Nancy Ragosta\n\nOther Important Event Information:\n\nAttire: Black tie optional\n\nValet: complimentary valet brought to you by Lia Auto will be available\n\nSilent Auction: Our silent auction will open up prior to the event.
