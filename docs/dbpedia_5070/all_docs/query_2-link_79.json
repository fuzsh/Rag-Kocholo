        "text": "We extend our deepest appreciation to the Pink Ribbon Army for their generous donation of $50,000. It was a joyous occasion to join in celebrating the success of their third annual event. Founded by Kelly and Danny Vo along with their army of supporters in 2021, the Pink Ribbon Army emerged from Kelly’s own breast cancer diagnosis that year. With the aid of friends and family, they established the Pink Ribbon Army to offer assistance to others facing the challenges of battling breast cancer, mirroring Kelly’s journey. Each year since its founding, the Pink Ribbon Army’s Golf Tournament, 5k, and 1k events allocate 100% of their proceeds to benefit Northwest Hope & Healing. We take immense pride in collaborating with them to provide financial stability to local individuals fighting cancer.\n\nMark your calendars for their upcoming events on October 6, 2024, at Chambers Bay Golf Course!"
