Breast cancer is something I will have to keep a close eye on, as my Mum had breast cancer and secondary breast cancer.  Unfortunately, we don’t know if it is in the family as Mum was adopted. So in the next few weeks, I will undergo tests to see if I have the gene and if I am at risk of developing breast cancer, so please support Pink Hope and the fantastic work they do. Krystal Barter founded Pink Hope in 2009 after recovering from a preventive double mastectomy. Krystal is a young woman whose family has been affected by the BRCA1 gene fault for four generations. Pink Hope was created because Krystal wanted a community for women like her. Pink Hope provides a unique community where high risk women can access support and information any time of the day or night. Today, I am wearing pink lipstick in support of Bright Pink Lipstick day. I am wearing Revlon Colourburst in Pink Truffle. Did you wear pink lippy today?",
