        "text": "Thomas Lane Pink Elementary School proudly opened its doors for the first time on August 25, 1997. Serving the community of North Richmond, the school was named for the distinguished African-American educator, Thomas Lane Pink. Following his retirement, Pink was quoted as having said: \"The greatest accomplishment during my 65 years of life is the inspiration and motivation I feel I have given to...children.\"\n\nThomas Lane Pink was born in Kendleton, Texas, the youngest of 10 children. He grew up on a farm, picking cotton. Before becoming an educator, Pink was an accomplished baseball player who traveled extensively throughout Canada, Mexico, Cuba, and the United States in the late 1920's and early 1930's. Pink played second baseman for the Houston Black Buffaloes and the San Antonio Black Indians, both Minor League teams in Texas. He is also reported to have played for the Chicago American Giants in the Negro Major League. Pink’s widow, Callie M. Pink, a retired school teacher, said her husband often would tell her stories about his time as a baseball player. “They would go miles and miles over many roads, and they lived in one big car.” The life of a black baseball player provided opportunities of considerable travel and adventure. Pink has been quoted in newspaper reports about his time as a baseball player: \"Some folks have put down the black baseball leagues, but it was good to me back then. We had our transportation and rooms paid for as well as $5.00 a day. During the Depression, this was pretty good compared to .50 cents a day picking cotton at home.\""
