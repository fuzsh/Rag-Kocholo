        "text": "Terri Alvino Meyer was a wife, mother of two great kids (Ellese and Evan) and a pharmaceutical sales representative.\n\nTerri was diagnosed with breast cancer in her late 30’s. She underwent surgery and chemotherapy and within a year and regained her health.\n\nAlthough Terri was very busy, she was a large contributor to the formation of the Young Women’s Breast Cancer Awareness Foundation. Creating awareness of breast cancer in young women and finding ways to help them deal with their diagnosis was very important to her.\n\nWithin three years, Terri found the cancer had returned. Throughout the next two years the cancer had traveled to her brain, bones, lungs and liver. She had radiation to her brain, to her eyes, over 5 different chemotherapy agents and hip replacement surgery. She was on several trials and even traveled out of state to research her options. The days were challenging, but Terri rarely complained. She illustrated the definition of strength.\n\nWhen Terri and I spent time together she often shared her dream. She wanted to make it to her son’s high school graduation.\n\nSadly, in June of 2009 Terri passed away before her son entered his freshman year of high school.\n\nDifficult to imagine, this brought about an earth shattering change for her family. As we were all dealing with our grief, Ellese decided to honor her mother with an idea she thought of just weeks after she lost her mother.\n\nEllese was a high school senior and the captain of the Mt. Lebanon cheerleading squad. She wanted to turn the Football stadium pink to honor her Mom and raise money for the YWBCAF. She took her idea to the Mt Lebanon Athletic director and PINK OUT was born.\n\nThe entire high school embraced the idea. The volleyball team, the soccer teams, and the lacrosse team all went pink and collected money during games in October.\n\nAnd, it didn’t stop there. Mt. Lebanon’s Athletic Director John Grogan emailed the idea to every school in the WPIAL conference. It took off like wildfire. 42 schools participated in the first PINK OUT on Oct 30 2009. High school stadiums across Western Pa turned pink. They honored their own local heroes. These students were inspired and came up with many creative ideas. The most incredible part was to see the passion in the high school students.\n\nHer one idea raised over $15,000 the she graciously donated to the YWBCF.\n\nWe encourage high schools to PINK OUT in October. Use whatever you may have available to you and help us fund our mission of education and support. Send us your stories , photos and videos.\n\nDonations can be sent to:"
