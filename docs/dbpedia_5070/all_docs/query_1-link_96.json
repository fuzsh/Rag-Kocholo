FOR WHAT PURPOSES WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA\n\nIn this paragraph we further explain for what purposes each category of data is processed by each Data Controller or Joint Controller.\n\n3.1 PURPOSES OF DIESEL USA Inc. (DIESEL)\n\nDiesel is the company that manages the e-commerce via the Site and the shop where you purchased a product and to which you have requested assistance services. In some cases, it may be necessary for Diesel to become aware of some information concerning you, to process specific requests you may have. Diesel will process Personal Data for the following purposes.\n\na. Sales activities and response to other requests made by customers\n\nIf you purchase Diesel products through the e-commerce service on the Site or in shops, Diesel will process your identifiers, contact data, biographical data, sales data and purchase data to conclude the sale, as well as for all activities strictly connected and related to it, such as delivery or other administrative and accounting obligations.\n\nSimilarly, Diesel may need to verify the requirements for participating to special discount programs (e.g. verifying if the purchase made is a first purchase or other requirements of the regulation) and to process your identifiers, contact data, and biographical data to respond to any further requests that you may formulate through the Site or through the Customer Service, through telephone or chat, such as requests for information, assistance, or to be notified by email when a desired product or size becomes available again on the Site, through the “Notify Me” functionality.\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the performance of a purchase contract to which you are a party; the provision of the Personal Data listed above is necessary for this purpose, since otherwise Diesel will not be able to process your request.\n\nb. Sales related services\n\nDiesel may need to process your Biographical Data, Contact Data and certain Sales Data (tax code and/or VAT number, passport number and Global Blue card number) to manage your purchase when concluded by phone or other methods provided for by Diesel, or issue an invoice, should you request it. Moreover, these data will be processed also to re-contact you for reasons connected with your purchase, for example in case of complaints, to recall a faulty and/or unsafe product or, in general, for technical reasons, e.g., related to the management of problems with refused credit card payments and similar.\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the performance of a purchase contract to which you are a party; the provision of the Personal Data listed above is necessary for this purpose, since otherwise Diesel will not be able to process your request.\n\nc. After-sales services\n\nDiesel may collect your identifiers, contact data, and biographical data to process specific requests that you may formulate in the shop, during post-sales; for example, to arrange a repair, a customization, a home delivery or to manage a return.\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the performance of a purchase contract to which you are a party; the provision of the Personal Data listed above is necessary for this purpose, since otherwise Diesel will not be able to process your request.\n\nd. Loyalty program Registration\n\nThe identifiers, contact data, purchase data, loyalty data and biographical data will also be collected by Diesel to manage your request to join the loyalty program (called “House of Diesel”, whose Regulation is available at the following link). These data will be processed to complete your membership and for all purposes strictly connected to it or instrumental, including – firstly – all the activities provided for in the loyalty program. Registration could take place: i) both online through the Site; ii) offline in the participating shops, by completing the application form present in electronic (tablet or another smart tool) format or through flyers (distributed in shops) with a special QR code, through which customers can join the program themselves via the Site, iii) through further official channels of Diesel S.p.A., (for example, but not limited to social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, WeChat etc.), or iv) through the Customer Service.\n\nAll communications relating to the loyalty program may be made by Diesel via the Site, SMS, MMS, Wallet, e-mail, newsletter, social networks and/or any other official communication channel of Diesel. All these communications relating to the program itself are sent solely for the purpose of making available the benefits related to it and do not constitute marketing communications.\n\nFurthermore, by creating an account on the website in the reserved area, the User will become part of the Diesel’s loyalty program. If you wish to take advantage of the services available on the Site (e.g., purchase products) without joining the program, simply choose the “Guest” option where available (e.g., during checkout for payments).\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the performance of a contract for joining the loyalty program to which you are a party; the provision of the Personal Data listed above is necessary for this purpose, since otherwise Diesel will not be able to process your request.\n\ne. Participation in prize contests\n\nDiesel will be able to process your identifiers and biographical data to allow you to participate in prize contests that Diesel could organize.
