        "text": "National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program\n\nMichigan receives funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as part of the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP).\n\nMichigan was one of six programs to receive funding in 1998 when the NCCCP was established. Now, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, eight U.S.-associated Pacific islands/territories, and seven tribes and tribal organizations are part of the NCCCP. Through the NCCCP, Michigan is required to maintain a cancer plan and statewide cancer coalition.\n\nTo learn more, go to About the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program | CDC.\n\nIn Michigan, and the United States, cancer is the second leading cause of death. It is estimated that over 60,000 Michiganders will get cancer and over 20,000 Michiganders will die from cancer in 2020.\n\nThe Michigan Cancer Plan, 2021-2030, which was developed for all Michiganders, is a strategic plan to reduce the cancer burden in the state. Approximately 82 people participated in the five workgroups that developed the cancer plan. Each workgroup consisted of an average of 15 active participants.\n\nCurrent Priority Objectives\n\nThe Michigan Cancer Consortium Board of Directors followed a prioritization process to select priority objectives from the Michigan Cancer Plan, 2021-2030. The following five were selected as priorities for the MCC from January 2024-December 2026.\n\nClick on an individual priority to open a PDF with more information about that item.\n\nOpen the next accordion section (\"Michigan Cancer Plan Dashboard\") to see our continuing progress on these five priority objectives."
