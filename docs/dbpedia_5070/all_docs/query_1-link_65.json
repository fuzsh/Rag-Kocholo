        "text": "A lot has changed since that sunny morning of Sept. 18, 1994, when a sea of some 500 walkers, mostly women and many wearing pink, showed up at Temple Beth El in Springfield to lend their support to the first Rays of Hope – A Walk Toward the Cure of Breast Cancer.\n\nNow 17 years later and the most successful fund-raising walk in Western Massachusetts for breast cancer, this year's 18th annual Rays of Hope Walk, presented by Health New England, will step off in two locations in Springfield and Greenfield on Oct. 23.\n\nWhat has changed over the years is the increasing support for this grassroots effort, founded nearly two decades ago by Springfield native Lucia “Lucy” Giuggio Carvalho, a registered nurse and breast cancer survivor who had worked in the oncology unit at Baystate Medical Center.\n\nToday, her vision to help others like herself in their breast cancer journey, has grown to 19,000 walkers strong, including 500 teams raising nearly $1 million annually in recent years.\n\n\"Since 1994, Rays of Hope has raised $9.25 million, all of which has remained in our local communities on behalf of patients and their families affected by breast cancer,\" said Susan Toner, vice president of development, at Baystate Health, and executive director of the Baystate Health Foundation.\n\nOver the years, Rays of Hope funds administered by the Baystate Health Foundation, have supported programs and services for breast cancer patients and survivors, breast health education, and the purchase of state-of-the art equipment at Baystate Regional Cancer Program's Comprehensive Breast Center and the D'Amour Center for Cancer Care in Springfield, Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Baystate Franklin Medical Center in Greenfield, Baystate Mary Lane Hospital in Ware, and various community projects throughout western Massachusetts.\n\nAlso, in April, the Rays of Hope made a significant contribution to the support of local biomedical research with a $1.5 million donation to establish the Rays of Hope Center for Breast Cancer Research at the Pioneer Valley Life Sciences Institute (PVLSI). The donation is intended to continue locally-based research on a broader scale at PVLSI.\n\nBut, it’s not only the numbers that have changed in terms of walkers and dollars raised, it’s the complexion of the event, which has become a family affair for many — including more men showing their support for the cause by walking alongside their wives or in memory of another loved one or friend.\n\nOne of those men is Steven P. LeFebvre of Somers, Conn., who attended his first Rays of Hope walk about 13 years ago to honor his friend’s wife after she lost her battle with breast cancer.\n\nSoon after, he was asked by Rays of Hope officials to join their steering committee and help to organize the yearly event.\n\nLast year, LeFebvre became the first man to chair the event. He will end his two-year term after this year’s walk.\n\n“The chairmanship isn’t about me — it’s about the whole team. The Rays of Hope steering committee is like family who all come together to do their jobs. We’re most proud of the fact that we’ve been able to continue Lucy’s vision — ensuring that women diagnosed with breast cancer, a scary two words, don’t have to go it alone as they navigate the health care maze and face the many challenges that lie ahead in their treatment and recovery,” LeFebvre said.\n\n“When I get up on stage at the walk and see all of the survivors in front of me, I’m personally very proud that we are doing this for them — to make sure there are more survivors in the future — and that I am involved with such a wonderful event that provides breast cancer patients with so many opportunities to get support,” he added.\n\nAccording to Dr. Grace Makari-Judson, medical director of the Comprehensive Breast Center, part of the Baystate Regional Cancer Program at Baystate Medical Center, a patient becomes a survivor from the day he or she is diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n\"There are some 2.5 million breast cancer survivors in the United States today thanks not only to improved treatments, but to efforts like the Rays of Hope that help get out the important message about screening, quality care and healthy lifestyles,\" Makari-Judson said.\n\nAs Rays of Hope chair, LeFebvre has his own special message to men.\n\n“I tell them not to wait until a loved one in your family is diagnosed with this devastating disease to get involved in the crusade against breast cancer. I tell them 1 in 8 women in their lifetime will be diagnosed with breast cancer, so the odds are good that someone in their life will be touched by this disease, whether a daughter, wife, sister or mother,” LeFebvre said.\n\nAnd, being informed was a great help to LeFebvre in supporting his own sister, Diane Tabb of Holyoke, who was diagnosed with early stage, non-invasive breast cancer five years ago.\n\n“I was walking in the Rays of Hope long before my diagnosis, and if I wasn’t walking, I was helping out as a volunteer. Personally, I am very happy that Steven is the first male chair of the Rays of Hope. It pleases me immensely to have more men involved in breast cancer issues, and the result is that it makes it a lot more comfortable for women like me to discuss breast cancer with some men,” Tabb said.\n\n\"My tumor was discovered strictly by mammogram, and I'm a big believer in women following the guidelines and having their first mammogram at age 40. I had my first mammogram at the age of 35, which my physician recommended earlier as a baseline because of microcalcifications in my breast. Then, at age 45, I had a biopsy done of a particular spot in the microcalcifications and was diagnosed with what they call DCIS,\" she added.\n\nDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the most common type of non-invasive breast cancer.\n\nTreated at Baystate Medical Center's Comprehensive Breast Center — which offers routine mammography services, as well as diagnostic mammography and core biopsy, diagnostic evaluations, multidisciplinary consultation, high risk screening, education and outreach services, and support services –—Tabb underwent three lumpectomies followed by radiation and is taking the drug Tamoxifen for five years.\n\nThe drug helps prevent Tabb's type of breast cancer from returning and also helps prevent the development of new cancers in the other breast.\n\n\"I had no risk. I led a healthy lifestyle, didn't smoke and had no family history of breast cancer,\" Tabb said.\n\nYet another survivor shares Tabb’s enthusiasm about her brother’s role as Rays of Hope chair.\n\n\"It's a wonderful thing that Steve is so involved. I think it's especially gratifying that as a man his support began not for a family member, but for a friend's wife,\" said Thomas A. Welch, principal at East Street School in Ludlow.\n\n\"We need to get more men involved, not only because women need our support in their breast cancer journey, but to bring greater attention to the fact that men like myself can get breast cancer, too,\" he added.\n\nWelch, who lives in Longmeadow, has a story of his own to tell when it comes to breast cancer. His mother died fighting the disease 36 years ago when he was just 14 years old.\n\nBut his story didn't end there. In 1997, his wife, Dianne, died two years after having a double mastectomy. Then, several years after remarrying a woman in 2005 whose husband had died of cancer, Welch felt a little tenderness on the right side of his chest.\n\n\"I knew what it was, because I knew all of the signs,\" said Welch, who just one day shy of his 49th birthday had a full right breast mastectomy to treat his stage 1 tumor.\n\n\"Now, every year, my wife Laurie and our children, as well as both sides of our families, and friends and co-workers walk along with us in the Rays of Hope as part of Team T. And, to thank them, we have a get-together at our home,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Welch's surgeon, Dr. Richard Arenas, chief of surgical oncology at Baystate Medical Center, breast cancer in men is \"a rare event.\"\n\n“Despite the fact that it is uncommon, it must be considered a real possibility in any man who develops pain, swelling or discharge in their breast. There is more evidence that most cases of breast cancer in men may be genetically-linked,” Arenas said.As a result, he noted men who are diagnosed with breast cancer may be candidates for genetic testing to look for mutations in either of the BRCA 1 or 2 genes.\n\nWhile both Welch and LeFebvre have been successful at attracting more men to the Rays of Hope, even the wlk's founder, Lucia Giuggio Carvalho, of Longmeadow, has done her share to involve more men in walking for the cause.\n\nKnown for many years as Lucy Giuggio by family and friends, as well as those familiar with her countless efforts on behalf of women and men diagnosed with breast cancer, the 18-year breast cancer survivor met her soul mate and was married in 2007.\n\nBut, she didn’t wait until walking down the aisle to introduce her husband, Springfield banker James Carvalho, to the Rays of Hope.\n\n“To meet Lucy is to love her. She is so genuine and caring. Not a day goes by when she doesn’t smile about something, and she’s an inspiration not only to me, but to the many people she touches through her efforts. I remember on our first date, she talked about her involvement with the Rays of Hope, which I knew of, but never fully understood what it was all about,” said Carvalho, who jokingly calls himself “the man behind the woman.”\n\n“I told Lucy it was a great cause that she started and that I would support anything she does. So I began walking alongside her in the Rays of Hope the first year we met, and now my children, Alicia and Kyle, join us,” he added.\n\nAnd, while Lucy always had plenty of people walking alongside her at the Rays of Hope Walk each year, she said it’s “extra special” having her new family with her.\n\n\"I like it — it's comforting to have Jim there along with Alicia and Kyle,\" she said.\n\nAs in past years, the Springfield walk begins at Temple Beth El on Dickinson Street where registration is set for 9 a.m. The walk in Greenfield begins at Energy Park on Miles Street with registration at 10 a.m. The Springfield walk steps off at 10:30 a.m., followed later in Greenfield at noon.\n\nWalkers in Springfield can choose from a two- or five-mile route. The shorter route follows the loop around the ball field in Forest Park, then back to Temple Beth El. It is accessible to handicapped participants. The five-mile stroll, in and around historic Forest Park, is a little more challenging with some hills.\n\nIn Greenfield, participants can enjoy a two or the more challenging three-mile route, both of which travel up Main Street before taking different directions. Both routes wind through Greenfield neighborhoods, past Baystate Franklin Medical Center, then head back to Energy Park.\n\nAlso, the 2nd Annual Run Toward the Cure 8K, held only in Springfield with the assistance of Fast Feet in West Springfield and Westfield, continues again after the success of its inaugural run last year.\n\nRunners will lead the way for the day’s event as they sprint through the route at 10:15 a.m., just 15 minutes before walkers step off. While the Run Toward the Cure 8K is considered a “fun run,” there will be a time clock at the finish line for runners who want to see and record what may hopefully be their “personal best.”\n\nLarge tents, pink balloons, music, colorful flags and a festive, hopeful atmosphere welcome all participants in Springfield and Greenfield. Local businesses and services will offer information and giveaways in the Exhibitor Tent.\n\nThe Rays of Hope Store will be selling sweatshirts, fleece vests, zip-up hoodies, scarves, eco-friendly shopping bags and more. There will also be a Food Tent with all kinds of treats to purchase, with sales benefiting Rays of Hope.\n\nAlso, the Pink Hope Lounge in Springfield, sponsored by The Walking Company, and in Greenfield, will welcome breast cancer survivors with special treats followed by the 2011 survivors’ photo at 10 a.m. in Springfield and at 11:30 a.m. in Greenfield.\n\nThose who want to support the Rays of Hope, but are unable to walk due to other commitments, can participate in the 10,000 Steps Toward a Cure program. Participants receive a pedometer to keep track of their steps throughout the month of October and raise donations similar to other walkers.\n\nParticipants can register for both the Walk and Fun Run online at baystatehealth.org/raysofhope, where they can also create their own personal webpage to assist them in their fund-raising efforts.\n\nSponsors for this year’s Rays of Hope are Health New England, Balise, Chicopee Savings Charitable Foundation, The Pink Petal and Radiology & Imaging.\n\nFor more information about this year's Rays of Hope Walk and 8K Run, held rain or shine, call (413) 794-8001 or visit baystatehealth.org/raysofhope.\n\nSubmitted by Baystate Health."
