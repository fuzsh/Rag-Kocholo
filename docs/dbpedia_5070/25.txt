FOR Bianca Rinehart, the fight to beat breast cancer is a personal crusade.

The oldest daughter of mining billionaire Gina Rinehart has joined forces with her childhood friend, fashion identity Steph Adams, to become ambassadors for Pink Hope, a charitable organisation that urges women to take control of their hereditary breast and ovarian health.

Ms Rinehart said the cause was close to her heart after the loss of her grandmother, Hope Hancock.

“Breast cancer is the leading cause of premature death in Australian women,” she said.

“We lost my beautiful grandmother, Hope, too young, and her sister Alix, also suffered from the disease.

Pink Hope was founded by Sydney woman Krystal Barter as she lay in hospital in 2009, recovering from a preventative double mastectomy at 25 because she carries the faulty BRCA1 gene.

Ms Adams, one of the NSW Fashion Ambassadors for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week 2014, said she was proud to be joining the charity in the lead-up to its “kiss and tell” campaign.

The campaign urges Australians to start a conversation about hereditary breast and ovarian health on Bright Pink Lipstick Day, on Friday, September 26.

“Cancer is something that has been in my family and has affected people close to me,” Ms Adams said. “I also had a health scare a couple of years ago, so when I was approached by Pink Hope to come on board, I immediately said yes.

“It is also something that is very close to Bianca’s heart so she was on board right from the beginning. Biancs and I grew up together in Perth. Our friendship started in kindergarten and we have been friends ever since. We are thrilled to be a part of helping to raise awareness to possibly save someone’s life.”
