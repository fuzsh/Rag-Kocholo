Pucker up

Pucker up and put on your pink lippy on today for a cause particularly close to my own heart! Revlon Australia and charity Pink Hope, Firday September 28th is Bright Pink Lipstick Day, a day to raise awareness for hereditary and high risk breast and ovarian cancer. Breast cancer is something I will have to keep a close eye on, as my Mum had breast cancer and secondary breast cancer.

Unfortunately, we donâ€™t know if it is in the family as Mum was adopted. So in the next few weeks, I will undergo tests to see if I have the gene and if I am at risk of developing breast cancer, so please support Pink Hope and the fantastic work they do.

Krystal Barter founded Pink Hope in 2009 after recovering from a preventive double mastectomy. Krystal is a young woman whose family has been affected by the BRCA1 gene fault for four generations.

Pink Hope was created because Krystal wanted a community for women like her. Pink Hope provides a unique community where high risk women can access support and information any time of the day or night.

Today, I am wearing pink lipstick in support of Bright Pink Lipstick day. I am wearing Revlon Colourburst in Pink Truffle.

Did you wear pink lippy today?
