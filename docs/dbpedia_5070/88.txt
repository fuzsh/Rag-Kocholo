Pink Hope

Pink Hope is an Australian preventative health hub that allows every individual the necessary tools to assess, manage and reduce their risk of breast and ovarian cancer, while providing personalised support for at risk women. Founded by the author and philanthropist Krystal Barter, in 2009, Pink Hope has grown exponentially the last years, reaching awareness and empowering women to take control of their health all over Australia and the world.

My role as a graphic designer has been focused on different aspects and platforms, from graphics for their multiple social media channels, printed material, indoor advertising via oOh! Media in Shopping centres and Airports, to outdoor advertising such as billboards published throughout Australia.
