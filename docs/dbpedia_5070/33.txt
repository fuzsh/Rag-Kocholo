Little Pink Houses of Hope empowers breast cancer patients and families to live each day to the fullest, with direction, purpose, and hope for the cancer journey. We accomplish this through free, week-long vacation retreats.

While retreats offer a much-needed respite from schedules dictated by medical appointments and the heavy burden of healthcare bills, the real value of retreats is in the supportive environment that helps families rediscover hope and joy. Patients and families reconnect and cultivate relationships with each other and with volunteers and other families. Patients and families consistently tell us Little Pink Houses of Hope is one organization that truly understands the impact of diagnosis and treatment.

The Inspiration for Little Pink Houses of Hope

Little Pink Houses of Hope was started by breast cancer survivor Jeanine Patten-Coble in 2009, just after receiving her diagnosis.
