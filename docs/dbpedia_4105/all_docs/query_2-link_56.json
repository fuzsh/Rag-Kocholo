        "text": "Nemai Ghosh (1934-2020) is primarily remembered today as the photographer who, through his lens, composed a visual biography of Indian filmmaker, Satyajit Ray, for a period spanning close to three decades. This exhibition draws from DAG's extensive collection of Nemai Ghosh's ouevre to explore his work with Ray, while also exploring his contribution to documenting and immortalising the best of Indian cinema.\n\nThe exhibition is a testament to Ghosh’s intuitive understanding of the visual potential of a moment, even in a form like cinema where the narrative unfolds through time. His photographs reveal the versatility of his vision and offer testament to his popularity across a wide spectrum of artists and practitioners working in Indian cinema and theatre, whom he captured in his frames.\n\nSATYAJIT RAY\n\nIt was in 1967 or ‘68 that Nemai Ghosh held a camera for the first time, when a friend gave him one as repayment for an overdue loan. The next year he found himself on the sets of Satyajit Ray's film Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne at Rampurhat, in Birbhum district, where he took his first tentative shots of the master auteur. Since then, for close to thirty years, Ghosh documented Ray's work—the faces of the actors, the director's many moods, and the details of every aspect of filmmaking that he was involved in. Sometimes we find Ray designing the cover of the children's magazine, Sandesh, or posters for his own films. On other occasions we see him hunched at the back of an Ambassador, shooting a scene through the bustling streets of Calcutta. Sometimes pensive, at others magisterial, Ray comes across as Ghosh's primary muse, towering over his actors and contemporaries.\n\nSATYAJIT RAY'S CINEMA\n\nFrom fairy-tales for children to gritty representations of Bengal’s troubled decades, from popular detective stories to the music Awadhi culture, Satyajit Ray’s oeuvre exhibits an unparalleled range of themes, subjects, and emotions. Ghosh’s lens had the unique ability to remain true to the master filmmaker’s own visual language, while adding an extra perspective to the cinematic moments that he borrowed and froze in time. In some, we see actors preparing, perhaps sharing a lighter moment over lunch, at others, we notice them during performance, entirely lost in their commitment to their characters.\n\nACTOR PORTRAITS\n\nNemai Ghosh encountered several actors during his work on Satyajit Ray’s sets, many of whose faces he was able to capture with compelling effect. But beyond Ray’s films, Ghosh also worked independently in Mumbai and beyond, interacting with actors, dancers and musicians. He caught them occasionally in their jovial moments, and sometimes when they looked pensive or momentarily let their guards down. What emerges from his archive is a beautifully sensitive series of portraits that reveal the intersections between the performers and the human beings.\n\nWORK WITH OTHER DIRECTORS\n\n'Single-minded in his documentary pursuit of the moving image, Ghosh produced some of the most important stills of Indian cinema, allowing us hitherto unseen insights into the movie-making process, best exemplified by work in progress on the sets of Satyajit Ray and other leading contemporary filmmakers... With no experience in photography or movie-making, Nemai Ghosh nevertheless created a persuasive case for himself as India’s best-known and most prodigious archivist of the movie business, one that provided celluloid fantasies for millions of Indians.'\n\nPramod Kumar KG\n\n'The stunning black and white photographs reaffirm Nemai Ghosh as the ultimate documentarian, a diarist with an archival essence who has given the world of photography an enchanting album of Indian aesthetics filled with vintage vitality.'\n\n– 'Step inside Nemai Ghosh's cinematic photographs at DAG New Delhi', Uma Nair, Architectural Digest, 21 May 2018"
