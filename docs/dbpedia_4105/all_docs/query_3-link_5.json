        "text": "About\n\nThis children's musical is a departure from Satyajit Ray's usual social realist films and brings out the director's delight in fantasy and song composition. Goopy and Bagha are musicians banished from their respective kingdoms due to their terrible lack of talent. They meet by chance in a forest and their music captures the attention of a ghost king who, enchanted by the pair, grants them three wishes.\n\nRestored by the Satyajit Ray Preservation Project at the Academy Film Archive, with funding from the Film Foundation."
