        "text": "Thinking where to start from, when it comes to Photography. We may see many people taking ‚Äòinterest‚Äô and ‚Äòimmense interest‚Äô in photography. Must say, in today‚Äôs era, ‚Äòphotography‚Äô is playing a wide & varied role.\n\nEarlier photography was limited to few but today it has spread like wild fire. Each and every one of us celebrates ‚Äòclicking‚Äô in our own individual ways. Today, it takes just seconds to share our clicks across the planet.\n\nAugust 19, the #WorldPhotographtDay is celebrated widely all across. Whether an amateur or professional or hobbyist, photography embraces each and every one in one platform irrespective of how good you are in ‚Äòclicking pictures‚Äô. For many this profession is their daily bread and butter whereas for others it is a hobby. But the story line is for whatever reason you use your camera it leads you to explore endlessly.\n\nAbove all these, it is very essential to learn about the origin and significance of #worldphotographyday. It instigated right after the creation of the ‚ÄòDaguerreotype photographic‚Äô procedures. This was developed by Louis Daguerre and Joseph NicephoreNiepce in 1837. However, on August 19, 1839, there was an announcement from the French Government where they made the invention by Joseph and Louis to be the first concrete gift to the planet. What could have been better than this event to iconize the World Photography Day?\n\nToday, in this fast paced world when sharing each moment has almost become mandatory, none can imagine the globe without ‚Äòcameras‚Äô. ‚ÄòPhotography‚Äô is open to all, not just limited to people who have a sound knowledge on it. True, a basic knowledge is required when you are clicking picture but there is no hard and fast rule to know all the technicalities or else you will be penalized. Photography is an art. Of course users with technical knowledge are well appreciated and you can get the best out of them.\n\nWhen reminiscing the first stint of photography, it will take you back to the old days where photographers used to carry film cameras. What a tough time it was backed with some brilliant ‚Äòclicks‚Äô. Earlier when cameras were costlier and handful people could use it, and was time consuming ‚Äì still we got to see the excellent outputs. No wonder, compared to the old days today we are blessed with the digital thrill. Hats Off to the advanced technology.\n\nNow, expressing the feelings with different strokes, colors and captures is no more a big deal as today we have turned Digital. Unlike those days, today you click and view it right away with the comfort of editing the pic in your own way.\n\nThe ‚ÄòWOW‚Äô moment =============\n\n‚ÄúFocus on what you feel not just what you see‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòBhooter Raja Dilo Bor‚Äô, Imagine the beauty of the words, how charismatic and innocent are they at the same time. Yes MISS my childhood days, though it did not stop the Ray lovers to dig into and get the flavor of the maestro‚Äôs works. Even today, if anyone asks me ‚Äúwhat is your favorite movie?‚Äù; no wonder the immediate answer would be none other than Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne. Lots and lots of memories attached with this particular movie, especially the Ghost‚Äôs song ‚ÄòBhooter Raja Dilo Bor‚Äô, it gives me goosebumps whenever I listen to it. No, it‚Äôs not out of fear but the uniqueness of the expert‚Äôs creation.\n\nIf you want to cook Bangali fantasy, adventure and comedy into one bowl, then nothing can beat Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne and its sequels ‚Äì Hirak Rajar Deshe and Goopy Bagha Phire Elo. Who can deny the explicit and unique illustrations by Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury (Ray‚Äôs grandfather), which were used for the creation of the movie! In fact this was the kick start for Ray to contemplate the idea of creating the magic in disguise of film for us. Creating records was no big deal for the Maestro üôÇ\n\nYes, we did read fairy tales, books on adventure, but for me it was Ray‚Äôs collection that kept me energetic and still craves for more. Truly, how many could have thought of creating such a distinctive character like the ‚ÄòBhooter Raja‚Äô. Hopefully, today many might come up or may have worked on such creation of characters, but this would not have come to one‚Äôs mind if Ray wouldn‚Äôt have given birth. In our childhood days watching this movie used to be a blessing in disguise. We used to literally daydream, such a friendly and unique personality ‚Äòbhoot‚Äô (ghost) staying with us and showing us the right path.\n\nWhy blessing in disguise, because in one of his dialogues he states ‚Äúalways use the power for good and if you are sincere and have faith in yourself nothing can ruin you‚Äù. Growing up with such beautiful thoughts does really create magic. May be at this age also, I imagine ‚Äòbhooter raja‚Äô sitting right beside me and whispering the same words. Bhooter Raja, the king of ghost, when you see him you will be stunned completely. It is a marvelous creation by Ray. So ugly, a bit frightening but the innocent smile, unmatched words, the reflection of tuni bulbs on his face, his facial expressions simply created the supernatural personality.\n\nThe story revolves around two people majorly. Goopinath (Gopi), who wanted to become a singer but unfortunately, a husky voice, became a barrier and Baghanath (Bagha), who wanted to be a drummer but unfortunately he turned out to be a bad drummer. Both of them were driven out from their respective villages. Cast out in the forest, Gopi meets Bagha in the same place. The initial meeting turned out into mockery, they made fun out of each other with their ability of singing and drumming. As it was a dense forest, they could hear the footsteps of the roaming tiger. Just to scare off the animal they started with their own music. In this process a strange melody got created attracting a group of ghosts. It seemed the ghosts were fascinated by the music which called for the King of Ghosts right there. The appearance of the spirits (bhoot) was a beautiful presentation by Ray, the Genius. The cinematography was completely out of the world. It seemed the audiences were enjoying a magical depiction of a LIVE dance show. It was and is still a fantasy to every audience. I wonder if I could be a part of his work.\n\nThe King was mesmerized by their music and found them to be loyal. Bhooter Raja granted three boons to Goopy and Bagha thereby making their life all the more exciting. The most amazing thing of Bhooter Raja was none other than his unique voice. It was the voice of the mastermind Satyajit Ray. Truly the King complimented the King himself. Another best part of this movie is the role of the protagonists sharing rhyming dialogues between each other.\n\nSo, do you want the Magic King beside you? ‚Ä¶. Stay tuned then There is a secret behind‚Ä¶ üôÇ"
