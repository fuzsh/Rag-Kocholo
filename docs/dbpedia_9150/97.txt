The 2023 version of the Oregon Festival of American Music, popularly known as OFAM, makes its debut at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 2, with a concert called In the Mood. The show features Chuck Redd and his Festival Big Band, plus vocalists Shirley Andress, Lynnea Barry, and Bill Hulings. Together, they’ll perform some of the best Big Band Swing from the World War II era, emphasizing the music of Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw.

The full program of events, titled If Only In My Dreams — America at War, 1939-45, runs Aug. 2 through 12 and is the 32nd year of OFAM at The Shedd Institute. It includes a wide array of activities, including concerts, films, and talks, plus a community sing-along and a Sunday Jazz Party. Each major concert is offered twice, once in the evening and also as a matinee.

All events take place at The Shedd Institute at 868 High St.

Here’s how The Shedd describes the background of this year’s OFAM festival:

By the end of World War II the Age of Big Band Swing was effectively over. There are many theories as to why this happened. World War II itself, with its ever-increasing call for young men and women to join the armed forces and its equally exacting toll on the U. S. economy in general with various government imposed restrictions and various taxes was one point of pressure on big bands. The American Federation of Musicians (AFRS) boycott strikes against record companies and radio stations was another. And finally there were the internal cultural pressures on big band swing itself as many of the best sidemen and bandleaders tired of playing for audiences who, according to Artie Shaw, “just wanted to hear dance music” and turned to their own inclinations towards jazz.

Whatever the reasons (and they were indeed complex), by the mid-1940s the big bands were effectively gone. Yet during the years of World War II many of the elements of Big Band Swing remained, with persisting vitality, much of which “lived” in the ongoing effort of the AFRS to boost morale and the general sentiment among many musicians and band leaders to do their part in the war effort. Two standouts were Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw. In 1942 Glenn Miller disbanded his civilian big band, joined the Army Air Forces and led the AAF orchestra until his death over the English Channel in December 1944. Artie Shaw joined the Navy soon after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and led a morale-raising Navy band in the Pacific through 1943.
