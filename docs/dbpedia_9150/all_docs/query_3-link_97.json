        "meta_description": "1962 was the year Bossa Nova landed in North America. Carnegie Hall hosted the first Bossa Nova Concert on November 21, 1962, presenting Antonio Carlos Jobim, João Gilberto, Sérgio Mendes, Luiz Bonfá, Roberto Menescal and others in a historic evening that changed the landscape of music in North America and worldwide. ROBERTO MENESCAL began his career as a professional musician playing with renowned artists such as Silvinha Telles, Elis Regina and others. In the late fifties his composer career blossomed, and together with artists such as Carlos Lyra, Tom Jobim and Ronaldo Bôscoli, he created Bossa Nova. From then on, his guitar's different beat became famous world wide. Menescal helped to show Brazil around the world with some of his compositions such as “O Barquinho,”“Você,” “Nós e o Mar,” “Bye, Bye Brasil,” “Rio,” among other remarkable songs. Downbeat Magazine calls DANIELA SOLEDADE a “master of classic samba and bossa nova.” An heir to the Bossa Nova legacy, Soledade is highly acclaimed for her poignantly expressive vocal style and intimate aesthetic. Drawing from authentic bossa nova, samba, MPB, and American Popular Song, Soledade is the sound of contemporary Bossa Nova. Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Soledade’s family roots are steeped in Bossa Nova’s inception. Her grandfather, Paulo Soledade composed popular songs with renowned Bossa Nova founders Antônio Carlos Jobim, Vinicius de Moraes, Toquinho, Baden Powell, Fernando Lobo, and others. Daniela’s latest album Pretty World is out now on Blue Line Music Records. Guitarist NATE NAJAR is one of this decade’s finest modern jazz guitarists. Nate’s newest album, Jazz Samba Pra Sempre, pays homage to Jazz Samba, the 1962 landmark album by Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz that launched bossa nova in the United States. Playing Charlie Byrd’s own instrument (a gorgeous-sounding 1974 Ramirez 1A nylon string classical guitar), Najar is joined by tenor saxophonist Jeff Rupert, bassist Herman Burney (playing Keter Betts’ bass played on the original Jazz Samba), keyboardist Patrick Bettison on Fender Rhodes electric piano and drummer Chuck Redd (previously of the Charlie Byrd Trio). Daniela Soledade guests on two tracks, Joao Gilberto’s classic “O Pato\" and Ary Barroso’s “É Luxo Só.” The results are as dreamy as they are exhilarating. Rick Andersen of the All Music Guide called Nate \"one of the most consistently interesting and stylish young guitarists on the jazz scene….\" Becky Byrd, wife of the late guitarist Charlie Byrd says it best: \"There is no doubt that there is a piece of Charlie's soul in Nate's mind, heart and fingers. Get ready world, here comes Nate Najar!!!\" Drummer, percussionist, composer, and producer MAGRUS BORGES will join the group this evening. Magrus is Grammy-nominated together with Bebel Gilberto (daughter of legendary father of Bossa Nova, Joao Gilberto) for her album “Agora”. Magrus started out his career at the age of 16 with one of Bossa Nova’s founding fathers, Johnny Alf. While living in New York, he performed and toured with Astrud Gilberto, Shakira, Chuck Mangione, Nestor Torres, Tania Maria, Larry Coryell, Moacir Santos, and Grace Jones. Magrus has released various albums of Brazilian Jazz with his group “The Rainforest Trio” and his solo album “Futurezon” which features him as a composer plus his 6th CD “Manissadu” recorded in Brazil. Since 2014, Magrus has also started a duo project with his daughter Ella, named Ella & The Bossa Beat.",
