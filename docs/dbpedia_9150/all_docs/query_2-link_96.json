        "text": "There, beginning in 1952, he wrote songs such as “Ida Bell” (later named “Maybelline”), “Sweet Little Sixteen,” “School Day,” “Roll Over Beethoven,” “Rock and Roll Music,” and the classic “Johnny B. Goode” along with others.\n\nIn 1958 his young family, now with two children, moved to a bigger house not far away. He continued to own the house for years, letting one of his employees live in it. Eventually he sold it and the house passed through several owners before being purchased by the Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority in 2010.\n\nBy now the house, which was included on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008, had badly deteriorated. Chuck Berry was known to occasionally drive by his old house, remembering the birth of rock ‘n’ roll he conceived and delivered in the basement.\n\nThe house is in the part of St. Louis known as The Greater Ville or just The Ville. Once the neighborhood of the black middle class—including comedians Dick Gregory and Redd Foxx, dancer and singer Josephine Baker, tennis champ Arthur Ashe, singer Tina Turner, and heavyweight boxer Sonny Liston—The Greater Ville is now one the most distressed parts of the city."
