The event will be held on Sunday, December 16 at 3:00 pm.\n\nChuck Redd made his international debut when he joined the Charlie Byrd Trio in 1980 at the age of 21. That year, he also began performing extensively with the Great Guitars. With Byrd, Redd traveled around the world and throughout the United States. Robert Redd was born and raised in the Washington, DC, area, where he continues to base his musical career. He co-leads a group with his brother, Chuck Redd, and appears often as a free-lance musician at Blues Alley with local and national artists and is a current member of the Duke Ellington orchestra.\n\nFor more information please call 410-226-5134."
