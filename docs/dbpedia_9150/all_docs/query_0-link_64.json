The chairperson acts as the point-person between the Moot Court Board and the greater law school and administration. Additionally, the chairperson oversees all planning, coordination, expenditures and communication for the internal competition, external competitions and additional extracurriculars.\n\nVice Chairperson\n\nThe vice chairperson assists the chairperson and all other executive board members to successfully complete their tasks. The vice chairperson frequently acts as an intermediary for the chairperson, other executive board members and other Moot Court board members, keeping the communication and relationships among the board strong. Additionally, the vice chairperson maintains relationships with the Moot Court Board's alumni, assists with organizing alumni events and connects current members with alumni in their interested fields.\"\n\nExternal Competition Coordinators\n\nThe external competition coordinators are responsible for organizing the Moot Court Board’s participation in competitions across the country, including submitting applications, organizing travel and determining who competes at which competitions. The external competition coordinators also play a role in judging the summer competition and determining the pairing and coaching assignments.\n\nReimels Administrators\n\nThe Reimels administrators work with Professor Jessica Webb and coordinate her fall LW3–Litigation/Appellate Advocacy course with the Moot Court Board's Theodore L. Reimel Moot Court Competition. The Reimels administrators are in charge of not only the logistics of the competition but also grading competitor briefs, providing feedback to Professor Webb on the competition problem prior to the fall semester and engaging with students in the 2L class competing in the competition.\n\nDirector of Recruitment, Retention and Inclusion\n\nThe director of recruitment, retention and inclusion plans, executes and oversees the administration of the annual summer competition—the primary means to gain membership to the Moot Court Board. Additionally, the director plans and executes events aimed at promoting Board unity and retention. The director also oversees the Moot Court Board's DEI Committee and directs all diversity and inclusion initiatives to recruit diverse members and engage with Villanova Law's various affinity groups.\n\nStudents can attain membership on the Moot Court Board in one of two ways:\n\nCompeting in the annual Moot Court Summer Competition; or\n\nStellar performance in the intra-school Theodore L. Reimel Moot Court Competition.\n\nSummer Competition\n\nThe Director of Recruitment and Alumni Relations organizes a competition for rising 2L and 3L students to compete for membership on the Moot Court Board. Each competitor writes an appellate brief and argues on-brief in front of the Executive Board, a panel of five members. The oral argument is 12 minutes and is followed by a short interview. The brief and oral argument are each worth 50% of the overall competition score. The Moot Court Board selects approximately 10-12 new members from this competitive process. Although students may try out for Moot Court Board and the Villanova Law Review write-on, students who join Moot Court Board cannot jalso join a journal.\n\nReimel Competition\n\nThe Chairperson and Vice Chairperson of the Board may decide to extend an invitation for Membership on the Moot Court Board after stellar performance in the Reimel Competition. The Moot Court Board may choose to select one competitor in a team or both partners in a team. This decision is made after considering a team’s brief score, oral argument performance and advancement in the competition.\n\nFirst-Year Member Responsibilities:\n\nCompete in Theodore L. Reimel Moot Court Competition in the Fall\n\nAll first-year Moot Court board members are required to compete in the fall intraschool competition in preparation for their spring outside competitions. The first-year Moot Court board members participate in the intraschool competition in tandem with enrollment in the LW3–Litigation/Appellate Advocacy course with Professor Webb.\n\nCompete in External Competitions in the Spring\n\nEach first-year Moot Court board member competes with a partner at a national moot court competition. The Moot Court board members are tasked with competing against other schools’ Moot Court teams at national competitions hosted by various law schools. Competing in an external competition will require members to write an appellate brief and argue before distinguished panels of judges.\n\nAssist with the 1L Legal Writing Program in the Spring\n\nThe Moot Court Board helps the first-year legal writing faculty members administer and judge the first-year law students’ spring semester oral arguments. Each Moot Court board member provides constructive feedback to first-year students to assist in preparation for their graded arguments.\n\nSecond-Year Member Responsibilities:\n\nMentor First-Year Board Members Throughout the Year\n\nEach second-year Moot Court board member will mentor a first-year member throughout the year.

The Moot Court board members are tasked with competing against other schools’ Moot Court teams at national competitions hosted by various law schools. Competing in an external competition will require members to write an appellate brief and argue before distinguished panels of judges.\n\nCoach First-Year Members in External Competitions in the Spring\n\nEach second-year Moot Court board member competes and serves as a student coach for a first-year or second-year team. Coaches organize oral argument practice schedules and coordinate with faculty, alumni and subject matter experts to assist with judging practice rounds in order to best prepare the Moot Court board members for their competitions.\n\nAssist with the 1L Legal Writing Program in the Spring\n\nThe Moot Court Board helps the first-year legal writing faculty members administer and judge the first-year law students’ spring semester oral arguments. Each Moot Court board member provides constructive feedback to first-year students to assist in preparation for their graded arguments.\n\nCOMPETITIONS\n\nEach year, the Moot Court Board competes in Villanova Law's annual Theodore L. Reimel Moot Court Competition as well as a number of external competitions.\n\n2023 Reimel Moot Court Competition winners, Daniel Rooney ’25 and Jillian Updegraff ’25, pictured with the final round judges\n\nThe Theodore L. Reimel Moot Court Competition is an annual intra-school tournament and a hallowed tradition at Villanova Law. Named in honor of the late Theodore L. Reimel, Judge for the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas from 1953 to 1973, the competition is designed to foster student development in written and oral advocacy through simulated appellate argument. Many alumni and other esteemed members of the legal community come to the law school to judge the oral arguments and provide advice and feedback to our students.\n\nIn 2015, the Reimel Competition was integrated with the LW3–Litigation/Appellate Advocacy course to provide second-year students with a more comprehensive, authentic and practice-oriented educational experience. Students enrolled in Appellate Advocacy participate in Reimels as part of the course. Third-year students are also encouraged to participate in the competition. All participants work in teams of two and are required to write an appellate brief and participate in oral arguments.\n\n2L students enrolled in Legal Writing III: Litigation/Appellate Advocacy compete in teams of two writing an appellate brief and arguing twice (once on-brief and once off-brief) in the preliminary round of the competition. The top-scoring teams advance to the elimination rounds of the competition. Villanova alumni, professors, local practitioners, and distinguished federal and state judges serve as panelists in the intra-school competition.\n\n64th Annual Theodore L.

Each team consisted of two students from the Moot Court Board, the principal oral advocacy organization at Villanova Law which aims to enhance and showcase students’ courtroom advocacy skills.\n\nParticipants analyzed and argued cutting-edge legal issues for hypothetical cases, from either the plaintiffs’ side or the defendants’. They used procedures modeled after those employed in state and federal appellate courts.\n\nThis year, the Moot Court Board is excited to return to in-person external competitions and continue to meet success!\n\nInterested in getting involved with the Moot Court Board?"
