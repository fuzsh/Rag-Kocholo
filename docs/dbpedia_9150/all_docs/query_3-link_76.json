        "text": "Ricky Malichi was born in Riverside, California and grew up in El Paso, Texas. His love of music was evident very early. The journey of a lifetime commenced when he began private percussion studies at eight years of age.\n\nAchieving multiple music honors in both High School and College, he studied Special Education at the University of Texas at El Paso while continuing his musical studies and activities in the Fine Arts Department. He fueled his thirst for musical knowledge outside the classroom as well to travel back East to study privately with legendary drum great Alan Dawson and others.\n\nRicky’s early jazz performing began in college when he joined a Quartet alongside the Jazz great and mentor Trumpeter Gerald Hunter. During that period and after, he worked with many jazz greats, including Jack Sheldon, Joe Newman, Tommy Newsome, and Charlie Rouse. One of Ricky’s highlights was when he subbed a night for the legendary Shelly Mann with Herb Ellis and Monty Budwig, after that performance he worked with them several times. His career has progressed since then throughout the United States and Europe, performing places such as the A – Trane International Jazz Club in Berlin, Germany and The Philharmonic Concert Hall in Lviv, Ukraine, and the International Jazz Festival in Sydney, Australia. In 2016 he toured with The Juarez/Chihuahua Symphony, performing pieces arranged for Jazz Quartet and Orchestra and many Jazz Festivals through out Mexico. Ricky has shared the stage or recorded with David “Fathead” Newman, Herbie Mann, Mose Allison, Chris Calloway (Cab’s Daughter), Richie Cole, Anita O’ Day, Ernie Watts, Bobby Shew, Bud Shank, Bobby Hutcherson, Regina Carter, Tia Fuller, Majic Fontuna (Trpt.) from Poland, Chuck Berry and the list goes on.\n\nThis year Ricky will be performing across the country and abroad. He has been invited back to play the 13th Annual Roswell Jazz Festival where in 2015 he was named the Guest of Honor (www.roswelljazzfestival.org). For years he has performed many prestigious Jazz Festivals and Parties with Internationally known musicians such as, Dan Barrett, Chuck Redd, Houston Person, Eddie Erickson, Frank Tate, Allen Vache, Scott Robinson, Randy Sandke, Rebecca Kilgore, Harry Allen, Nicki Parrott, Rossano Sportiello, Howard Alden, Howard, Elkins, Dr. Roger Dickerson, Ehud Asherie, Randy Reinhart and more.\n\nThere are two musical groups Ricky is always excited about. He helped established “New Impressions” and “EP Jazz Quartet.” Recording and touring across the country, Mexico, and Europe has been a joy. Working with Erik Unsworth (Bass), Curt Warren (Guitar), Mack Goldsbury (Sax), Shaun Mahoney (Guitar), and the late great Vince Genova has been a wonderful journey. Keeping the Art form of Latin music alive he was co-founder of the award winning Latin Jazz Quartet (Yoboso) appearing on B.E.T. program “Jazz Central”. Ricky has been a part of a rhythm section with a great Latin Jazz/ Salsa Ensemble “Spice of Life” under the direction of pianist and longtime friend Michael Francis.\n\nWith such richly musical experience and commitment to being a “team player”, Ricky is equipped to consistently contribute outstanding, stylistically authentic performances to any ensemble, regardless of the genre.\n\nMalichi’s accomplishments are substantial in the field of music education. He takes his talents into public schools and universities as a clinician, and as an adjudicator in and out of the country. Ricky has had the privilege to perform at the Chautauqua Jazz Party but, was one of the clinicians at the (Traditional Jazz Workshop). In Poznan, Poland he was honored to teach at The I. J. Paderewski Academy of Music (International Jazz Workshop), La Universidad Automa De Aguascalientes in Mexico, and workshops and performances in Australia to name a few places abroad. He is the President for Southwest Arts Alliance, Inc. and is on staff (Percussion Instructor) with the El Paso Music Conservatory."
