        "text": "The Album That Redefined Bossa Nova Receives A 60-year Compliment\n\nNate Najar’s Jazz Samba Pra Sempre explained: Tribute or reimagination, here’s an album that’s earned a place next to the original.\n\nby Scott Adams\n\nIf you’re of a certain age, then you know.\n\nIf not, go ahead and ask around. Jazz Samba, by saxophonist Stan Getz and guitarist Charlie Byrd, occupies rare air in the universe of essential albums for Brazilian jazz fans.\n\nIn strictly jazz terms, we’d put it right up there with Kind of Blue.\n\nIt’s that special.\n\nJazz Samba was recorded in a single 50-minute session – with no retakes – on February 6, 1962. Importantly, it was the first of Getz’s five Bossa Nova albums recorded within two and a half years.\n\nIt’s fair to say that Jazz Samba popularized Bossa Nova when it was released 60 years ago this month. And while the sax player was Jazz Samba’s headliner, there’s no doubt that Charlie Byrd’s guitar was the story.\n\nFollowing The Path First Taken\n\nSix decades later, Charlie Byrd’s guitar is still the story. “When I first heard Charlie’s records, I thought, ‘That’s what I want to do,’” recalled Najar, while reflecting on his early years.\n\nThe St. Petersburg Florida native continued. “I loved his sound. There was just this elegant simplicity in his playing. It always seemed like just the right way to do it.”\n\nNajar’s interest resulted in several visits to Byrd’s hometown, Washington D.C. A pivotal moment occurred during one of those visits. Impressively, Najar took creative custody of Byrd’s personal 1974 Ramirez 1A classical guitar.\n\nMusician and guitar. The two became fast friends. Tuning, traveling, rehearsing, recording, and performing. All the while watching the calendar for this day to arrive.\n\nJazz Samba Pra Sempre Explained\n\nFurther visits to D.C. reinforced the musical bond. One brought Nate Najar in touch with Chuck Redd, former drummer with the Charlie Byrd Trio. Another trip led to the upright bass that Keter Betts used on Jazz Samba. Ultimately, it was made available for Herman Burney to play on Jazz Samba Pra Sempre.\n\nThey join tenor saxophonist Jeff Rupert and Patrick Bettison’s Fender Rhodes electric piano. Vocalist Daniela Soledade sings on ‘O Pato’ and ‘E Luxo So.’\n\nThis is where things get interesting.\n\nCreating something new from the threads of time\n\nOne by one, these are the steps Nate Najar has taken to pay homage to an iconic album. The arrangements, the musicians – even the instruments they play – are thoughtfully chosen to honor what has come before.\n\nWith this comes creative risk.\n\nRecreating the aural core of Byrd’s ’62 trio is the key. Listen to the seven songs on Jazz Samba Pra Sempre. You’ll be pleasantly surprised to discover that authenticity is second-nature with this ensemble.\n\nNajar is equally careful to place a contemporary patina upon this foundation.\n\n“There were certain places on this record where I wanted you to really feel the aesthetic of the original. And there are certain places where I wanted to be sure to depart from it,” he explained.\n\n“‘One Note Samba,’ ‘Samba Dees Days’ and ‘Desafinado’ are most like the original record. However, they’re still different in enough ways to be us playing it.”\n\nJazz Samba Pra Sempre’s Contemporary Flourish\n\nRupert’s sax is rightfully front and center. He’s empathetically in the moment. He provides a delicate balance between respect for Jazz Samba’s signature sound and the alchemy needed to meet Najar’s vision.\n\nJazz Samba Pra Sempre is so carefully crafted that several moments may pass before you appreciate the album’s biggest departure from Jazz Samba.\n\nPatrick Bettison’s keyboard style is understated and complimentary. “I thought about having a second guitar. But I really love the sound of the Rhodes and how it blends with the guitar. Additionally, having the Rhodes gives it a little bit of a contemporary sound,” said Najar.\n\nFinally, there’s the cover art from abstract expressionist painter Olga Albizu. It’s a familiar touch to echo the contemporary vibe she created for Jazz Samba, 60 years ago.\n\nFor Nate Najar, Jazz Samba Pra Sempre “shows my love and appreciation for what this music has done for me while paying tribute to it with my own voice.”\n\nNate Najar’s Jazz Samba Pra Sempre\n\nBlue Line Music Records\n\nVisit Blue Line Music Records\n\nBrowse Nate Najar’s recordings\n\nSend a message to Nate\n\nRead Nate Najars’s Bio\n\nFollow Nate Najar On\n\nWebsite | Facebook | YouTube | Instagram | Twitter\n\nOrder Here | Amazon | Apple Music\n\nListen To This Album On:\n\nThe Sounds of Brazil’s live streaming station\n\nAlso On These Channels\n\nBossa Nova Love Affair\n\nBrazilian Jazz\n\nNew Music: Brazil\n\nWomen Of Brazilian Song\n\nSunday Brazilian Brunch\n\nJazz Samba Pra Sempre Track List"
