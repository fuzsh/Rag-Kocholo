Sign In\n\nSubscribe to Our Newsletter\n\nAre you a musician who has performed at Smalls or Mezzrow in the past and doesn’t have an artist account then please contact us directly at musician@smallslive.com.\n\nFoundation\n\nThe SmallsLIVE Foundation for Jazz Art & Education is a not-for-profit arts organization. Our mission is to subsidize the operation of our venues, recording projects, tours and educational initiatives. During this Covid-19 pandemic our mission is to keep the clubs floating until business can be restored. We will also sponsor live-streamed concerts from the club that will keep the musicians working during this period. We will also be offering emergency aid for Jazz musicians in need due to this calamity.\n\nArchive\n\nThe SmallsLIVE Archive is an audio/video library of all the shows at Smalls & Mezzrow. Royalties are paid directly to the musicians by The SmallsLIVE Foundation. Members sponsor their favorite musicians by listening to their music.\n\nLive Stream\n\nSmalls Jazz Club has been a pioneer in live streaming and began streaming shows live from the venue in 2007. There is no cost to watch our live streams. During normal operating times the entire evening is streamed. During this Covid-19 pandemic period there will be special live concerts scheduled in advance."
