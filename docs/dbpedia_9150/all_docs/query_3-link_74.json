        "text": "I am Nathaniel Blaine Warren. I am a woodwind instrumentalist (saxophone being my primary) residing in Shawnee, Okahoma. I perform almost any style of music on several instruments. Although I am quite partial to Jazz and Funk, I also excel in the genres of rock, pop, blues, acoustic, alternative, and classical. As a multi-instrumentalist, I am profficient on saxophone, flute, clarinet, piano, and voice.\n\nI began my studies in music at the age of 8 and found my passion for saxophone when I began in middle school. In high school, I was awarded the Oklahoma Jazz Educators High School Jazz Musician of the Year (2009).\n\nUpon high school graduation, I attended Oklahoma Christian University under the direction of Dr. Heath Jones. There, I quickly became the lead alto saxophonist in the Jazz Ensemble. I also began performing in Oklahoma City, joining house bands as the saxophonist and pit orchestras as a woodwind instrumentalist. I attended Oklahoma Christian University for 3 semesters before making the decision to join the US Army, serving my country as a Radio Operator. I did my best to keep music as an integral part of my life, performing in both Germany and Seattle.\n\nOnce I decided to leave active duty military, I joined the Oklahoma National Guard Band. I performed at an OU Halftime show, the 45th Infantry Division Museum, and the Oklahoma History Center. In September 2016, I relocated to Roswell, New Mexico to be closer to my parents. As part of the New Mexico National Guard Band, I performed throughout the state at many events and venues including the Spencer Theater of Performing Arts, San Juan College Amphitheater, and the Roswell Jazz Festival. Some of the notable artists I performed with include: Nicki Parrott, Chuck Redd, Johnny Varro, and Michael Frances.\n\nIn 2018, I decided to go back to school full time at the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma. I was awarded scholarships and joined the Concert Band, Concert Choir, and the Brass and Wind Chamber Ensemble. In the spring of 2020, I earned the privilege of performing with the OkMEA Intercollegiate Honor Band as the principal/1st chair alto saxophonist.\n\nAfter a year at USAO, I chose to further my education by transferring to Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. I spent two years there studying Jazz Studies under world class instruction as the lead alto saxophonist in Big Band I and many small ensembles. My private instructors while at Wayne State were Gene Parker, Chris Collins, and Marcus Elliot. I performed at many venues throughout the city: Parts and Labor, Cliff Bell's, Aretha's Jazz Club, Marble Bar, Bert's Marketplace, etc...\n\nI look forward to the future opportunities my music career has to offer."
