        "text": "CELEBRATE THE SEASON with NYC vocalist Lizzie Thomas and her swinging jazz band. Get into the spirit as Lizzie reimagines the holiday & Christmas classics you know and love. She dazzles!\n\nLizzie Thomas is an inventive jazz singer with a beautiful voice and a swinging style who loves to perform fresh and heartfelt versions of standards from the Great American Songbook. On her five recordings and in her popular and entertaining live performances, she introduces audiences to classic songs that are still timeless and relevant today.\n\n​\n\nLizzie Thomas - vocals\n\nJohn Di Martino- piano\n\nYoshi Waki- bass\n\nChuck Redd-drums\n\nAntoinne Drye - trumpet\n\n​\n\nDUO Encounters, which will be released by Dot Time in March 2023, teams Lizzie Thomas with a dozen major instrumentalists on one duet apiece. Rather than sing a conventional set in front of an accompanying pianist or guitarist, the interpretations are adventurous, filled with close interplay between the artists, and contain plenty of variety in instrumentation, mood, and tempos. Lizzie shares the spotlight with pianists Helio Alves, John Di Martino, and Rossanno Sportiello, guitarists Russell Malone, Ron Affif, and Guilherme Monteiro, bassists Ron Carter (“Willow Weep For Me”), Noriko Ueda, and Dezron Douglas (a version of “Have You Met Miss Jones” that includes the rarely heard verse), percussionist Café (“Nature Boy”), tenor-saxophonist Wayne Escoffery (“Lush Life”), and cellist Mairi Dorman-Phaneuf (a haunting version of “’Round Midnight”). The result is a memorable set of superbly sung and often-surprising music, Lizzie Thomas’ most rewarding recording to date.\n\nAs usual, she digs deep into the lyrics and uplifts each song, but these performances also convey a sense of happiness and joy at finally having the opportunity to interact with other musicians after the worst days of the pandemic.\n\nWhen asked what qualities a song needs to have for her to want to perform it, Lizzie shares, “I'm a lover of melody and lyrics. I love uncovering tunes that are unknown, but also reimagining standards with a great arrangement. Within my live show, surprising my audience with folk and nontraditional jazz selections is a must, and I have a special love for Brazilian music. I enjoy educating my audience about the songs, the stories, and the composers. If I have someone come up after my set and say they were inspired to daydream and think of new ideas, I know I did a great job. My favorite comment is, ‘I was transformed- as if I was in another space and time.’”"
