        "text": "Ryan Crawford enters his fourth season on the Wake Forest football staff after joining head coach Dave Clawson in February 2018. Crawford, who spent six seasons as the special teams coordinator and secondary coach at Harvard, serves as the assistant special teams coordinator and coaches Wake Forest’s rovers.\n\nCrawford stepped into a new role in 2020 adding assistant special teams coach responsibilities as well as leading the backend of the Demon Deacons defense.\n\nUnder Crawford's tutelage, Wake Forest's rovers played an instrumental role in helping the Demon Deacons' defense finish this past season as one of seven FBS schools with a turnover margin of at least +10, the highest in the Dave Clawson era. AJ Williams (two) and Traveon Redd (one) also contributed to a defense that became one of five programs in the country to post back-to-back seasons with at least 13 interceptions. Redd finished the 2020 season with 46 tackles, the fourth-highest on the team, while Williams finished with 30 defensive stops, a career-high.\n\nIn his first year working with the special teams in 2020, Wake Forest scored their first kickoff return touchdown since 2003 while Donavan Greene finished the season with the fourth-highest kickoff return average in the nation at 34.0 yards per return.\n\nOver the 2018 and 2019 seasons as the cornerbacks coach, Crawford has played an integral role in the development of Essang Bassey and Amari Henderson. The cornerback duo ended their Demon Deacon careers ranked second and third among active players in passes defended with Bassey finishing with 50 while Henderson defended 48 passes.\n\nPrior to making the move to Winston-Salem, Crawford spent six seasons as the secondary coach at Harvard.

The duo helped the Demon Deacon's defense become one of five FBS schools to post 13 or more interceptions in consecutive seasons.\n\nThe ballhawking defense was an immense factor in holding the highest turnover margin (+10) in the Dave Clawson era.\n\nWake Forest's special teams saw an uptick in production in 2020, led by Donavan Green's 34.0 yards per return average (fourth-best in the country) and their first kickoff return touchdown in 17 years.\n\nUnder Crawford’s tutelage, cornerback Essang Bassey earned third team All-ACC honors in the 2019 season and went on to be selected for 2020 Reese’s Senior Bowl. Bassey finished tied for 27th in the country in passes defended with 11 on the season.

He led the nation with a 18.8 punt return average while also returning a nation best two punt returns back for touchdowns. The Crimson’s punt return defense also ranked 23rd in FBS, allowing less than five yards per return.\n\nDuring the 2015 season, the backend of the Crimson defense played a key role in Harvard ranking second in FCS in scoring defense, fifth in red zone defense and 23rd in total defense\n\nThe Crimson were the best defense in all of FCS in Crawford’s third season on campus. They led the country with 12.3 points allowed per game while ranking 11th in the country in passing efficiency defense and 12th in total defense.\n\nUnder the teaching of Crawford, Crimson defensive back D.J. Monroe led all of FCS with 18 passes defending in 2013 as Harvard finished 23rd in the country in scoring defense in 2013.\n\nCrawford helped make an immediate impact on the Harvard defense in his first season.
