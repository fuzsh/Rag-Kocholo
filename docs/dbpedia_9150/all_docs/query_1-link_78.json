        "text": "Looks like Ride Snowboards is owning the airwaves for the month of August in snowboarding. After dropping Jed’s timeline earlier in the month, they have\n\nThe clips that earned Jed Rider of the Year! Check out his timeline from Ride’s Rated R!\n\nThe summer of 2024 is alive and well! Check in to see what happened during Burton’s week at Mt. Hood.\n\nAn interview from the back of a pickup truck with the newest star in snowboarding.\n\nClimbing the ladder quickly among up-and-comers in the streets, Montana-raised Iris Pham is on a trajectory rarely seen these days in snowboarding.

Enjoy these elegant studies…\n\nWe watched it so you don’t have to… unless you are into that sort of thing.\n\nTHe Japan rumor has gone down, but who will advance to Revelstoke?\n\nThe newest episode of Sunday in the Park just dropped, and it’s all hammers, all the time.\n\nA snowboard’s camber is all about transferring energy, and nothing does it quite like Never Summer’s Triple Camber profiles.\n\n91% of the pros we asked still want a cover… which is good for us! 50+ riders answer right here.\n\nIf you’ve ever ventured down the road of building your own splitboard, you’re well aware that the process can be an…uphill battle.\n\nLane’s creations at HFM Welding are on hills all over North America, including a new public park in NH.\n\nThere are plenty more, these are just the first 20 from the mag.\n\nThanks to a whole lot of…Intuition, Ride Snowboards uses heat-moldable liners, which can be custom-fit to your custom feet.\n\n“I like…looking for details and things that most people maybe haven’t seen before, trying to pull back the curtain a little bit when I can.”\n\nWin a Stalefish and pair of Cleaver Bindings from Rome by entering our giveaway right now!\n\nNot one, but two! Take home two boards in one step right now!\n\nAre you sick and tired of struggling with stubborn boot laces? The yanking. The pulling! OUCH! Enough is enough!\n\n“I’m just trying to push the ones who got left behind to the front of the pack.”\n\nIt was early last winter when Marie France-Roy, Mary Rand, and Stefi Luxton had planned to head into a remote cabin in the BC backcountry.\n\nThat electric stream of first light emerging in the gradient of cobalt-blue twilight has been frozen in Elena Hight’s signature Smith Squad MAG.\n\nSilver gelatin emulsions are the best means for capturing ectoplasm. This is why ghost photos are always so grainy, duh.\n\nAlready a triple threat in pipe, slope, and big air… Valentino talks habits and plans to take over the snowboarding world.\n\nA ski resort may seem like a pretty simple operation–build some lifts, maybe a lodge or two, and just add snow—but in reality, even the smallest resorts rely on a complex web of intertwining departments…\n\nOn the way home back to France, I made a little Whatsapp group (very Euro of me) and started brainstorming…\n\nIn the fifth episode of Backcountry’s Venture Out series, Nils gives us a look behind the curtain of hitting the iconic jump.\n\n“I thought my weekend was going to be spent resting. Joke was on me when we decided to start building on Thursday.”\n\nFact: brain trauma knows no gender. It’s a good idea to wear a helmet, but fits can be tricky, and let’s be honest, looks matter.\n\nThere’s something to be said about when things are just easier.\n\nIf it’s good enough for Stale, it’s good enough for the rest of us.\n\nIn which we check in with one of our favorite snowboarders about filming last year.\n\nWhen your backyard is the Wasatch and it’s the 2023 season, you’re hitting from home.\n\n“It was only going to be possible to ride this thing if we hit a large number of consecutive green lights.”\n\nGear editor Mike Basher tore into one a pair of Ride boots to figure out how it works.\n\nA crew of Ride’s Euro team left it all out in the streets for this one.\n\nA family finds a home in Austria after leaving their country during the war.\n\nWhat makes a boot popular year after year?

Editor’s Note: We might be using ‘prequel’ wrong.\n\n“Every time I leave NYC I miss it that much more.”\n\n“Snowboarding has shaped my life and brought me some of my best friends, so why not pass the torch for someone else to experience that and work to share the love with others?”\n\nDusty talks about his winter, being named the overall slope champ from ’23, and more.\n\nThis shifted my perspective on being pregnant to “Okay, I am not in control.”\n\n“At Culture Shifters, we leaned unto each other and stopped waiting for the industry.”\n\nFollowing the final CORE Nation event of the season, supported by Smith and evo, we caught up with Erik Leon.\n\nIt got to a point that it wasn’t feeling therapeutic to push myself in a dangerous way.\n\nFear Feature: A look at our relationship with fear and risk. In part 1, Elena Hight shares her perspective.\n\nNate talks about his latest rail jam wins and what he is doing with all the cash.\n\n“Whenever we get a bunch of great riders coming to Bear, I get all excited and nostalgic at the same time.”\n\n“Head injuries are complex and hard to understand which is why people stray away from learning anything about them.”\n\nThere has been plenty of powder days, but the constant storms are a challenge that the resort and community weather together.\n\nWhy write about them when you can just watch them?\n\nJosh Fisher is for the people and his impact is felt in big ways.\n\nWe checked in with one of snowboarding’s favorite boarders after his first place in Detroit.\n\nA few outtakes and in-betweens from Erik Leon, Frank April and Marie-France Roy’s time up in Alaska while filming for their new movie Marshmallow Walrus.\n\nRed Bull Heavy Metal has touched down in Detroit!
