        "text": "Ricky Malichi was born in Riverside, California and grew up in El Paso, Texas. His love of music was evident as a youngster and the journey of a lifetime commenced when he began private drum studies at eight years old. Achieving multiple musical honors in both high school and college, he earned a Special Education degree at the University of Texas at El Paso in 1977 but continued his musical studies in the fine arts department. He fueled his thirst for musical knowledge outside the classroom by studying privately with legendary drum great Alan Dawson and others.\n\nRicky’s early jazz performing experience began while still in college when he joined the Mike Frances Quartet and worked alongside the great trumpeter Gerald Hunter. During this period, he had the opportunity to work with many jazz greats including Herb Ellis, Monty Budwig, Jack Sheldon, Tommy Newsome, Joe Newman, Charlie Rouse and many others. As his career has progressed, Ricky has shared the stage with David “Fathead” Newman, Herbie Mann, Chris Calloway (Cab Calloway’s daughter), Richie Cole, Ernie Watts, Dave Young, Houston Person, Chuck Redd, Nicki Parrott, Dan Barrett, Eddie Erickson, Harry Allen, Allan Vache’, Randy Sandke, Chuck Berry and the list goes on!\n\nHis richly diverse musical experience and his commitment to being a ‘team player’ has equipped him to consistently contribute outstanding stylistically correct performances to any ensemble, regardless of the genre.\n\nRicky was co-founder of Santa Fe, New Mexico’s ‘Yoboso’ Latin Jazz Quartet. The group was named “Instrumental Winner” in the Black Entertainment Television (BET) Jazz Discovery competition. In the December 1998 Latin Beat Magazine, Yoboso’s recording, ‘It’s a Shame’ was listed in the Top 10 Hit Parade. The group toured the United States, Mexico and Australia.\n\nMalichi is excited about being a part of the jazz quartet ‘New Impressions’, which he helped establish. Curt Warren, guitar, Erik Unsworth, bass and the late, great Vince Genova, piano, with Ricky on drums, have produced and recorded a CD titled, ‘New Impressions. He also enjoys performing with and co-directing the ‘Spice of Life’, 11-piece Latin Jazz Ensemble. The group has recently been invited to perform with world-class jazz musicians at the prestigious West Texas Jazz Party in Midland, Texas.\n\nRicky’s accomplishments are substantial in the field of musical education. He takes his special teaching talent in to festivals, clinics and workshops, public schools and universities as clinician and adjudicator in and out of the country. His dedication to teaching is always a top priority, setting aside his time for private students and conducting student recitals. He has recently been honored to teach drum-set at the famed Chattaqua, New York Jazz Festival (Jazz Workshop) under the direction of Dan Barrett.\n\nMalichi is co-director of the El Paso Youth Jazz Ensemble, a year round eighteen-piece Jazz Band representing young, talented high school students from various El Paso school districts. He is also Assistant Director of Education for Southwest Arts Alliance, Inc. and on staff with the El Paso Music Conservatory.\n\nRicky has been named to the Spaun Drum Co. artist roster and plays Spaun drums exclusively. Brian Spaun and staff create wonderful custom handcrafted drums, which are featured during his performances, clinics, and recordings.\n\nwww.rickymalichi.com"
