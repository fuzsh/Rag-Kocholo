Or just listen and laugh. The theme changes every month. This month the theme is Dedication.\n\nHOW THE SHOW WORKS:\n\nAnybody can put their name in the hat for a chance to tell their true, personal story on the theme.\n\nStorytellers will be mostly picked at random from the names in the hat. We may have one or two special picked guests. We usually have time for 8 to 10 open-mic storytellers. We also present one or two Featured Storytellers from our wonderful storytelling community. These are people who have won awards at various shows, or just are known to us for their great storytelling style and charisma. The Featured Storytellers tell true, personal stories, but a little longer than the open-mic'ers.\n\nTickets at StorySlam Oakland\n\nView Event →\n\nGeorge Brooks Quintet w special guest Roopa Mahadevan\n\nAcclaimed saxophonist and composer George Brooks, known for his masterful blend of jazz and Indian classical music, is coming to Oakland’s Sound Room on August 22nd for an evening of genre defying music.\n\nBrooks will be joined by a powerhouse ensemble featuring longtime allies Kai Eckhardt, on bass, Frank Martin on piano, Deszon Claiborne on drums and in her premiere performance with the group, vocalist Roopa Mahadevan (fresh off her debut with Winton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra).\n\nGeorge Brooks Brooks is a pioneer in the world of Indian fusion. He has collaborated with Indian music giants Zakir Hussain and Hariprasad Chaurasia, jazz greats John McLaughlin and Larry Coryell, R+B superstar Etta James and minimalist pioneer Terry Riley. His compositions are praised for their depth and beauty and his improvisational skills are nothing short of awe-inspiring.\n\nKai Eckhardt brings an unparalleled level of energy and creativity to the stage. He has been a foundational member of groups led by John McLaughlin, Trilok Gurtu, Billy Cobham, his own Garaj Mahal and Brooks’ super-group Summit. His distinctive bass work is the perfect complement to Brooks' saxophone.\n\nBay Area first call pianist Frank Martin is lauded for his work with such luminaries as Sting, Stevie Wonder, Angela Bofill and Narada Michael Walden (to name just a few). He is a sought-after producer and arranger and Sound Room favorite.\n\nAnother Bay Area favorite is drummer Deszon Claiborne who has performed with Peter Apfelbaum, Don Cherry, Charles Brown, Angela Bofill, Les McCann, Dr. Lonnie Smith, Robin Ford, Boz Scaggs, Greg Howe, Henry Butler, Giovani Hildalgo, John Handy, Taj Mahal, Donald Harrison, Rodney Franklin, and many others.\n\nVocalist Roopa Mahadevan has recently relocated to the Bay Area from New York City. She is a leading Indian classical vocalist and crossover artist in the South Asian diaspora known for her powerful and emotive voice, scintillating stage presence and collaborative spirit. Roopa's artistic projects take her to diverse soundscapes and corners of the world - from Chennai's Music Academy to the cutting-edge venues of New York City.\n\nTickets at George Brooks Quintet\n\nView Event →\n\nJazz Mafia celebrate 50th Anniversary of Herbie Hancock THRUST/HEADHUNTERS\n\nIn the year 2000, trombonist, bassist, composer, arranger, and producer Adam Theis co-founded Jazz Mafia – an eclectic artist collective of forward-thinking and accomplished players in Electro, Hip-Hop, World, Classical, and Jazz. Twenty years in the making, Jazz Mafia is a prolific staple of the quintessential San Francisco sound, uniting creative and accomplished Bay Area instrumentalists, vocalists, MCs, composers, and arrangers.\n\nThe collective quickly garnered a reputation for its collaborative and risk-taking spirit, and over the years has worked with Roy Ayers, Lyrics Born, Zion-I, Rebelution, Latyrx, Galactic, Ledesi, Blackalicious, and Jackie Greene, to name a few. Recently, the collective performed sold out residencies at the SFJAZZ Center and served as the house band in The Soiled Dove – its large-scale cirque-inspired collaboration with The Vau de Vire Society. Jazz Mafia has also recently collaborated with the Oakland Symphony at Paramount Theatre of the Arts, as well as with GRAMMY-winning composer Mason Bates and his Mercury Soul project at the Kennedy Center in DC. Jazz Mafia also curates musical experiences for Stanford University, Oakland Art & Soul Festival, and many other presenters.\n\nThis event featuring The Hogan Brothers and Jazz Mafia Horns: Daniel Casares & Adam Theis\n\nHerbert Jeffrey Hancock is an American jazz musician, bandleader, and composer. Hancock helped to redefine the role of a jazz rhythm section and was one of the primary architects of the post-bop sound. In the 1970s, Hancock experimented with jazz fusion, funk, and electro styles. It was during this period that he released perhaps his best-known and most influential album, Head Hunters\n\nTickets at Jazz Mafia Celebrate Herbie Hancock Headhunters\n\nView Event →\n\nMitch Polzak\n\nThe big guy from out West and larger than life energy (he’s also 6’5’) performer, guitarist, singer, banjoist, songwriter, composer, entertainer, musical historian and teacher Mitch Polzak wears his heart on his sleeve and his playing in his heart.\n\nPolzak performs rockabilly and 60’s country music with the religious fervor of Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Cash and delivers a Honky Tonk ballad with the sincerity of Merle Haggard and Waylon Jennings. Mitch will bring a room to a fevered pitch of joyous energy on the dance floor and then tell you a story in a song like two old friends sitting at a kitchen table at midnight.\n\nHis virtuosic guitar skills and influences range from the blazing flying fingers of Joe Maphis, Marty Stuart, Roy Clark, and Don Rich to the timeless dreamlike state of “Sleepwalk” by Santo and Johnny along with the vast valleys of deep rumbling twang associated with Duane Eddy.\n\nThere is not one singular definition of Polzak’s music but that is very specific to what he does. Being fluent in the musical languages of Country, Rockabilly, Honky Tonk, The Bakersfield Sound, Surf, early Rock and Roll, Bluegrass, Cajun, Blues, and Truck Driving music gives Polzak the unique voice of the melting pot of the American musical experience. This is why he consistently connects with so many people directly at every show.\n\nPolzak’s abundant joy in communicating with people through music leaps off the stage through every fiber of his being. His near-constant genuine smile can be seen clear across the room and invites you in without any pretense or judgements. Some call him “The Honky Tonk Mister Rogers”!\n\nMake no mistake though. Underneath that smile is a deep and reverent respect for the history and integrity of the music and musicians who came before him and created the sounds and told their stories.\n\nTickets at Mitch Polzak\n\nView Event →\n\nJules Leyhe & the Family Jules Band pay tribute to Jeff Beck\n\nJoin us for our monthly Blues Blowout. You won't want to miss these!\n\nJules Leyhe might look like your everyday, average, unassuming guy, but he’s one of the world’s foremost blues slide-guitar players—so much so that even Premier Guitar magazine called his music “the best blues slide licks since Derek Trucks, maybe even Duane Allman.” Those might sound like some big boots, but this Oakland native not only fills them, he wears them out and has to order new ones. This year, he is showcasing a new blues series at the Sound Room, where Leyhe and his Family Jules Blues Blowout will be joined by local blues players from around the Bay each month.\n\nThis month they pay tribute to the recently departed guitar icon, Jeff Beck. Beck rose to prominence as a member of the rock band the Yardbirds, and afterwards founded and fronted the Jeff Beck Group and Beck, Bogert & Appice. In 1975, he switched to an instrumental style with focus on an innovative sound, and his releases spanned genres and styles ranging from blues rock, hard rock, jazz fusion and a blend of guitar-rock and electronica. Beck was ranked in the top five of Rolling Stone and other magazines' lists rankings of the greatest guitarists. He was often called a \"guitarist's guitarist\". Rolling Stone described him as \"one of the most influential lead guitarists in rock\".\n\nBeck earned wide critical praise and received the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance six times and Best Pop Instrumental Performance once.

Now he’s taking on his most challenging musical costume yet, covering arguably the greatest singer of the 20th Century, Frank Sinatra. Sinatra may have been the greatest singer, but he was far from a perfect man. Bergey is pulling no punches as he tells sordid stories of the singer’s life against the musical backdrop of some of the best-known songs of the Great American Songbook.\n\nBergey has spent the past decade zig-zagging through multiple genres of music and comedy. He’s been channeling the voice of Gregg Allman in Freestone Peaches: A Tribute to the Allman Brothers Band for a decade. As a solo act and live-looper, he’s negotiated thousands of covers in an anything-goes show at Belle Cora in North Beach since the pandemic. He’s a featured vocalist with Jazz Mafia’s Grateful Brass and will soon be taking on the David Byrne role in a Talking Heads tribute in the fall. As a vocalist and bandleader he’s lead hundreds of bands on private and corporate events all over the Bay Area as well as corporate events in Barcelona, Hawaii, Cancun, Dallas, and Arizona. Based on a handbook he wrote inspired by his dynamic and colorful experiences at the helm as a wedding singer, Bergey conducts training seminars all over the west coast where he teaches young bandleaders the ropes on running a tight ship under the pressure of high-end private events.\n\nWhen asked why Sinatra, Bergey says “It feels like everything I’ve done professionally over the past decade including the music-comedy, the gameshow hosting, MC-ing large events, and singing music from the past 75 years has funneled me into finding the music of Sinatra and the Rat Pack. The music has pulled me all of the way in. There’s something so classic and timeless about the songs and the way that he sang them. But then I started to learn about his life and that sent me down a rabbit hole that I’m still digging deeper into and I’m eager to share the stories and my discoveries with an audience.”\n\nHe also warned that this is not a classic, note-for-note tribute. “I’m not doing a Frank Sinatra impression. I won’t be wearing a fedora or tuxedo. If I quote him, it will be in context of a story I’m telling about the man and these will not be well-known stories! I’m singing his songs, but I’m also telling tales that are not the normal, bland fanfare and publicist-approved points that would introduce him on a prime time television show in the 60’s. This show will present both the bright accolades and the dark sins of a nuanced artist while showcasing the songs that make him undeniable for any generation.”\n\nBergey will be backed by some of the best of the Bay Area including Andrew Dixon on tenor sax and all three of the incredible Hogan Brothers. Expect some very-special musical guests as well.\n\nTickets at Sinatra’s Saloon\n\nView Event →\n\nAn Evening of Flamenco\n\nFlamenco is an artistic expression fusing song (cante), dance (baile) and musicianship (toque). Andalusia in southern Spain is the heartland of Flamenco, although it also has roots in regions such as Murcia and Extremadura. Cante is the vocal expression of flamenco, sung by men and women, preferably seated, with no backing singers. The gamut of feelings and states of mind – grief, joy, tragedy, rejoicing and fear – can be expressed through sincere, expressive lyrics characterized by brevity and simplicity.\n\nFlamenco baile is a dance of passion, courtship, expressing a wide range of situations ranging from sadness to joy. The technique is complex, differing depending on whether the performer is male (heavier use of the feet) or female (gentler, more sensual movements). Toque or the art of guitar playing has long surpassed its original role as accompaniment. Other instruments, including castanets, hand-clapping and foot-stamping are also employed.\n\nFlamenco is performed during religious festivals, rituals, church ceremonies and at private celebrations. It is the badge of identity of numerous communities and groups, in particular the Gitano (Roma) ethnic community, which has played an essential role in its development. Transmission occurs through dynasties, families, social groups and Flamenco clubs, all of which play a key role in its preservation and dissemination.\n\nTickets at Flamenco\n\nView Event →\n\nOakland Samba Revue\n\nOakland Samba Revue is the San Francisco Bay Area’s premiere banda de gafieira.

King, Albert King, Ray Charles, and a pinch of Albert Collins. Add in dazzling blues and jazz guitar chops, a rich soulful baritone vocal delivering original, often wry and beleaguered lyrics with sophisticated chord changes and instrumentation, and skills on various horns and keyboards, all delivered with an uptown cool that never lacks searing passion. It all adds up to the one and only Chris Cain, who has gone from being a newcomer phenomenon bursting onto the blues scene in 1987 with a classic debut release, to being a legend, inspiration and long-established member of the blues pantheon.\n\nHis jazz-informed blues guitar playing is fiery, emotional and always unpredictable. His vocals—gruff, lived-in and powerful—add fuel to the fire. His indelible original songs keep one foot in the blues tradition and both eyes on the future. The pure joy Cain brings to his playing and singing is palpable, and draws fans even closer in.\n\n\"Hands down my favorite blues player on the scene today. He’s an absolute blinder of a guitarist, with the voice of B.B. King and the chops of Albert King.\" –Joe Bonamassa\n\n\"Chris Cain? Now that boy can PLAY the guitar!\" –B.B.

He is highly respectful of blues traditions, yet understands how to interpret it in innovative ways. I think we will look back in 20 years and realize we witnessed something very special in the evolution of the blues.\" Michael Kinsman, San Diego Blues Festival\n\nCharlie Musselwhite-endorsed Aki Kumar proves to traditionalists that singing in Hindi can co-exist with Chicago blues conventions. This Indian-American’s intense sense of musical discovery as an able vocalist and harmonica player drives worry-and-regret makeovers of Bollywood film songs and adds bounce to a reggae version of “Watermelon Man.” Boosted by top West Coast blues personnel and cross-cultural extras, Kumar proves that the integrity of his music marks the difference between novelty and substance.\n\nKumar was born and grew up in Mumbai, where his parents' upbringing and eclectic tastes—his father spoke Kannada, his mother Telugu—exposed him to a broad range of sounds—everything from rock 'n' roll and pop to the more traditional sounds of Bollywood film scores and Indian classical music. In his youth, he studied both keyboards and tabla, and acquired his first harmonica from his father. He listened to \"everything from Bach to John Denver, from Stevie Wonder to the Police\" in addition to music that dominated the Indian subcontinent.\n\nHe moved to the US in 1998 to study computer science, initially in Oklahoma City and then at San Jose State University in Silicon Valley. He was first attracted to American oldies radio, and then discovered the blues by visiting nightclubs and bars in the Bay Area.Soon after completing a degree, he went to work at Adobe. He has now turned to music full-time.\n\nKumar's harmonica playing is rooted in the classical style invented by Little Walter and others, but his blues style is eclectic.He developed his skills by studying with David Barrett, who operates the School of the Blues in San Jose. He played regularly in the band Tip of the Top for several years before forming his own band and launching a solo career.\n\nKumar expresses his pride in his Indian heritage by blending melodies from Hindi movies and Indian classical music with American blues, creating a fusion of East and West that he calls \"Bollywood blues\".\n\nTickets at Aki Kumar\n\nView Event →\n\nStorySlam Oakland\n\nStorySlam Oakland is Oakland's longest-running true storytelling show, where people tell short and true stories from their lives.

Choro is one of Brazil’s earliest popular musics, dating back to the late 1800s, and, similar to jazz, it reflects the melding of African rhythms with a melodic and harmonic structure closely resembling Baroque Classical music.\n\nG.F.B.’s exploration of choro spans nearly 100 years, including everything from the traditional to more contemporary versions and jazz influenced reinterpretations. In addition to performing and touring, Grupo Falso Baiano has worked in collaboration with the Pasadena Pops, Around the World Music Program, Young Audiences of Northern CA, and Youth in Arts, to bring choro and Brazilian music to students throughout California.\n\nG.F.B. is Zack Pitt-Smith (reeds), Brian Moran (7-string guitar), Jesse Appelman (mandolin), and Ami Molinelli (percussion).

Johänntgen‘s new pieces are powerful with an experimental, sometimes melancholic flair of the Motown era of the 70s.\n\n“Labyrinth” is jazz as Nicole Johänntgen understands it. It is the art of resolving contradictions. Everything sounds as if it had been created somewhere outside, spontaneously at a session. But there is much more behind it. The unconventional instrumentation of saxophone, tuba and percussion offers unexpected new possibilities.\n\nTickets at Nicole Johänntgen Trio\n\nView Event →\n\nKelly Park's Parliament of Owls\n\nOwls are noted for their wisdom and knowledge and for this event we have gathered a group, or parliament, to bring you some sage musical insight.\n\nBandleader Kelly Park brings a group of close friends together for a night of original jazz, peppered with a couple of standards.

This year, he is showcasing a new blues series at the Sound Room, where Leyhe and his Family Jules Blues Blowout take a look at new music each month.\n\nNamed one of Guitar Player Magazines 12 Players of Christmas in 2014 as well as the Bay Area Blues Foundations All Stars in 2015, Leyhe has already shared the stage with many of Blues greatest talents including Buddy Guy, Barry Goldberg, Fantastic Negrito, Nick Gravenites, Elvin Bishop, and Maria Muldaur.\n\nLeyhe has performed with with Buddy Guy, Taj Mahal, Charlie Musselwhite, Chris Cain, Jimmy Vivino, Fantastic Negrito, Elvin Bishop, and Maria Muldaur, played the national anthem at the Oakland Coliseum, and been featured in guitar player, premier guitar, and vintage guitar.

The project is rooted in her childhood fascination with the jazz music of some of the ballsiest women of the Jazz and Blues world, including unsung trailblazers – Nellie Lutcher and Julia Lee – whom she discovered hidden on the shelves of her father’s record collection.\n\nCaptivated and enchanted by these “unapologetic” chanteuses of the 40’s/50’s (along with Pearl Bailey, Dinah Washington, Blossom Dearie, Peggy Lee, Julie London), Owen made it her mission to dig deep and find out more from both a musical and historical perspective.\n\nThe album was recorded at Esplanade Studios in New Orleans – the city Owen now calls home – with a stellar cast of musicians, including Jason Marsalis, Donald Harrison, Charlie Gabriel, Nicholas Payton, David Torkanowsky, Kevin Louis, Evan Christopher, Ricardo Pascal and many more.\n\nThe result is the most joyful, uplifting, and empowering project.

It wasn’t a hard choice, she recalled, and now it’s become a large part of my life. She’s been able to connect with new friends and build community. It’s also been easier for her to talk to people who are going through similar experiences.\n\nShe returns to the Sound Room with an amazing band:\n\nRay Obiedo guitar\n\nPeter Horvath keys\n\nDan Feiszli bass\n\nPhil Hawkins drums\n\nJon Bendich percussion\n\nTickets at Chloe Jean\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Best of Brazil: Guinga, Monica Salmaso, Teco Cardoso\n\nIf you are a fan of Brazilian music, this concert is a must see, featuring the beloved Brazilian vocalist Monica Salmaso, who catapulted to renown with her 1995 album with guitarist Paulo Bellinati, Afro Sambas, which premiered Baden Powell’s and Vinícius de Moraes’ complete Afro Sambas collection.

Over the months, they assembled a studio in his fathers aircraft hangar and invited the three other musicians to rehearse new music to livestream and record.\n\nSelf-recorded in an airplane hangar in rural Alaska during a pandemic exile, 2021’s “Second Wave” delivered the story of a group of young musicians using exceptional circumstances to create personal & musical connection, and ultimately, a stirring documentation of time-well-spent.\n\nWith this script in hand, Meridian Odyssey returned to Big Lake in August 2021, settling in for six days of intense rehearsals of nine new originals, with time off for sailing, flying and hiking together.\n\nWith trumpeter Noah Halpern joining the core band of saxophonist Santosh Sharma, bassist Ben Feldman, pianist Dylan Hayes, guitarist Martin Budde, and drummer/producer/engineer Xavier Lecouturier, the group found a new power and focus in their sound, with the expanded front line and the growing conceptual openness the band had developed.\n\nBorn from the perceivably “lost” years of ’20 & ’21, “Earthshine” will speak to the creative read and react of six musicians on the literal threshold of their careers. While a marvelous tale of its own, it portends to be but an entrance into a musical beyond.\n\nFor longtime fans of jazz, this is your opportunity to enjoy premium talent at the beginning of their journeys.

Their music stands in stark contrast to the typical blues heard in bars these days and would more likely be shaking the floors of a Southern juke joint some 70 years ago.\n\nFrom Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf to Son House and B.B. King, blues artists have claimed some of the most evocative monikers in American music. With its intimations of primal sacred cries, HowellDevine embodies that legacy in word and deed, delivering elemental blues and boogie like juke joint prophets. Featuring Eli’s Mile High Club-honed Joshua Howell on slide guitars, harmonica, and vocals, percussion expert Roll ’Em Pete Devine on drums and washboard, and the relentlessly propulsive Joe Kyle Jr. on bass, the combo taps into red clay Delta roots while embracing fierce grooves that speak to urban realities. While debates about authenticity and the blues often devolve into tiresome stalemates, the fact that HowellDevine was the first blues act signed by Chris Strachwitz to his Arhoolie Records label in a quarter century speaks to the band’s unusual feel for the tradition. The result was 2013’s Jumps, Boogies & Wobbles, which neatly sums up their irresistible sound. ​~ Andrew Gilbert\n\nTickets at HowellDevine\n\nView Event →\n\nKelyn-Kai-Lorenzo-Martin\n\nCome on out for a great evening of music!

Andalusia in southern Spain is the heartland of Flamenco, although it also has roots in regions such as Murcia and Extremadura. Cante is the vocal expression of flamenco, sung by men and women, preferably seated, with no backing singers. The gamut of feelings and states of mind – grief, joy, tragedy, rejoicing and fear – can be expressed through sincere, expressive lyrics characterized by brevity and simplicity.\n\nFlamenco baile is a dance of passion, courtship, expressing a wide range of situations ranging from sadness to joy. The technique is complex, differing depending on whether the performer is male (heavier use of the feet) or female (gentler, more sensual movements). Toque or the art of guitar playing has long surpassed its original role as accompaniment. Other instruments, including castanets, hand-clapping and foot-stamping are also employed.\n\nFlamenco is performed during religious festivals, rituals, church ceremonies and at private celebrations. It is the badge of identity of numerous communities and groups, in particular the Gitano (Roma) ethnic community, which has played an essential role in its development. Transmission occurs through dynasties, families, social groups and Flamenco clubs, all of which play a key role in its preservation and dissemination.\n\nTickets at An Evening of Flamenco\n\nView Event →\n\nHannah Mayer Quartet\n\nHannah Mayer is a 21-year-old pianist and composer from El Cerrito, currently attending Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, MD.

Standing not quite five-foot-two, he's an oversize talent who can scat with the harmonic daring and rhythmic command of a bebop saxophonist, croon with the simmering soul of Donny Hathaway, and interpret standards with such intelligence and emotional commitment it's like Rodgers and Hart wrote \"I Didn't Know What Time It Was\" with him in mind.\" -- Andrew Gilbert, eastbayexpress.com\n\nSo what happens when you put them together?

He is highly respectful of blues traditions, yet understands how to interpret it in innovative ways. I think we will look back in 20 years and realize we witnessed something very special in the evolution of the blues.\" Michael Kinsman, San Diego Blues Festival\n\nCharlie Musselwhite-endorsed Aki Kumar proves to traditionalists that singing in Hindi can co-exist with Chicago blues conventions. This Indian-American’s intense sense of musical discovery as an able vocalist and harmonica player drives worry-and-regret makeovers of Bollywood film songs and adds bounce to a reggae version of “Watermelon Man.” Boosted by top West Coast blues personnel and cross-cultural extras, Kumar proves that the integrity of his music marks the difference between novelty and substance.\n\nKumar was born and grew up in Mumbai, where his parents' upbringing and eclectic tastes—his father spoke Kannada, his mother Telugu—exposed him to a broad range of sounds—everything from rock 'n' roll and pop to the more traditional sounds of Bollywood film scores and Indian classical music. In his youth, he studied both keyboards and tabla, and acquired his first harmonica from his father. He listened to \"everything from Bach to John Denver, from Stevie Wonder to the Police\" in addition to music that dominated the Indian subcontinent.\n\nHe moved to the US in 1998 to study computer science, initially in Oklahoma City and then at San Jose State University in Silicon Valley. He was first attracted to American oldies radio, and then discovered the blues by visiting nightclubs and bars in the Bay Area.Soon after completing a degree, he went to work at Adobe. He has now turned to music full-time.\n\nKumar's harmonica playing is rooted in the classical style invented by Little Walter and others, but his blues style is eclectic.He developed his skills by studying with David Barrett, who operates the School of the Blues in San Jose. He played regularly in the band Tip of the Top for several years before forming his own band and launching a solo career.\n\nKumar expresses his pride in his Indian heritage by blending melodies from Hindi movies and Indian classical music with American blues, creating a fusion of East and West that he calls \"Bollywood blues\".\n\nTickets at Aki Kumar\n\nView Event →\n\nErik Jekabson Quintet\n\nErik Jekabson is a trumpet player, composer, arranger and educator who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.
