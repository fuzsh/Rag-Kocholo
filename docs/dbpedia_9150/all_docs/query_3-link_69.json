The multi-talented siblings have been playing together since they were 10 and 11. They continue to strive with their gifts as they travel, playing with some of the best local, national and international recording artists. Their performances can be described as two different voices coming together to create a healing, ethereal, and emotional experience for the listeners, as well as themselves.\n\nEbban Dorsey, 19-year-old alto saxophonist, composer, and bandleader, is from Baltimore, Maryland and has studied with Blake Meister, Carl Grubbs, Tim Green, and Gary Thomas. Ebban has gained a lot of experience playing Jazz and has even performed with Carl Grubbs, Gary Bartz (Performed on a live recording for the documentary titled, Blues Chronicles), Kamasi Washington, John Lamkin, Warren Wolf, Benito Gonzales, Kenny Garett, Tia Fuller, Sean Jones, Wycliffe Gordon, Tanya Darby, Erica Von Kleist, Mimi Jones, Shamie Royston, Reginald Thomas, Allison Miller, José James, Matthew Stevens, The Chuck Redd Band, Christian Scott, and many more. She was a member of NYO Jazz 2020 as well as NYO Jazz 2021 and recorded an album with the 2021 Jazz band. She has also performed a jazz rendition of This Land is Your Land at the Baltimore Orioles stadium as part of the Women of Music concert series, and later performed the national anthem alongside Ephraim Dorsey for the 2020 season opener. Ebban Dorsey is an extraordinary musician with a bright future ahead of her.\n\nEphraim Dorsey, 20-year-old tenor saxophonist, composer, and bandleader, is from Baltimore, Maryland and has studied with Blake Meister, Carl Grubbs, Tim Green, and Gary Thomas.
