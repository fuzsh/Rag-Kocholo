        "text": "ROCKFORD, Ill. (WIFR) - A suspect is in custody after four people died and seven others were hurt during a stabbing attack on Rockford’s southeast side.\n\nAccording to the Winnebago County Sheriff’s Office, a total of 11 victims were involved.\n\nThe Rockford Police Department identified the deceased as a 15-year-old girl, a 63-year-old woman, a 49-year-old man and a 22-year-old man. Investigators confirmed during a news conference one of the deceased is a mail carrier for the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nPolice say five others are being treated for serious injuries at area hospitals. The Winnebago County Sheriff’s Office said two more people were hurt in its jurisdiction.\n\nAround 1:15 Wednesday afternoon, first responders were called to the 2300 block of Holmes Street. Officials say dispatchers received more calls for medical and police help at nearby addresses on Cleveland Avenue, Winnetka Drive and Eggleston Road. Rockford Police Chief Carla Redd says the case is multi-jurisdictional with the Winnebago County Sheriff’s Department and federal officials joining the investigation.\n\nAt 1:35, about 20 minutes after the first call came in, authorities took a 22-year-old man into custody. Chief Redd said investigators do not believe any other suspects are at large and they do not have a clear motive. No charges have been filed at this time.\n\n“I think like most Rockfordians, I’m just totally shaken by this act of violence and the impact that it’s having now on multiple families’ lives. So I’m certainly- my prayers are with them as they’re just beginning to deal with what will be really difficult days and weeks ahead,” Rockford Mayor Tom McNamara said.\n\nPolice clarified that not all victims in the attack were stabbed and none were shot.\n\nThe City of Rockford is partnering with Rosecrance and Rockford Public Schools to offer free emotional support and counseling services to loved ones and residents of the neighborhood. The services will be available 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday, March 28, and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday, March 29, at Flinn Middle School, 525 Ohio Parkway.\n\nChief Redd asked residents in the area to check their home security systems and reach out to police with any footage to help with their investigation. She said officers will remain in the area for “quite some time” as they work to figure out what happened.\n\nThis story is developing and will be updated as more information becomes available."
