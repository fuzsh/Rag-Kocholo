Guided by Jeroloman's hitting instruction, Florida swatted a program-record and nation-leading 145 home runs while performing as one of the top offenses in the country. The Gators finished the campaign ranked seventh in slugging percentage (.545), eighth in runs (566) and 10th in hits (686). Perhaps most impressively, Florida scored in 43.3% of its batted innings over the course of the year (254 of 586).\n\nUnder Jeroloman's tutelege, seven different Gators collected All-American honors in 2023 including two Unanimous First Team hitters in Wyatt Langford and Jac Caglianone. That is on top of Florida’s league-high seven All-SEC selections. The Gators comprised the entire All-SEC starting infield with the exception of third base.\n\nThe two-way playing Caglianone produced perhaps the best offensive season in school history. He set single-season program records with 33 home runs and 90 RBI while slashing .323/.389/.738. As the lone Gator to start all 71 games, Caglianone’s 33 homers led the nation and established a new BBCOR era record in college baseball. On the mound, the 2023 ABCA Player of the Year went 7-4 with a 4.34 ERA, .190 BAA and 87 strikeouts across 18 weekend starts.\n\nJeroloman also got remarkable contributions out of the Freshman All-SEC tandem of second baseman Cade Kurland and catcher/DH Luke Heyman, who both earned everyday spots in the starting lineup while swatting double-digit homers. Kurland in particular was named First Team All-SEC and a Freshman All-American, slashing .297/.404/.555 with a program-record 17 homers at the second base position – the most by a UF freshman since JJ Schwarz’s 18 in 2015. Meanwhile, Heyman concluded the year hitting .314/.366/.555 backed by 12 homers, 39 RBI and 30 runs over 51 starts.\n\nElsewhere on the diamond, Langford earned All-America status for the second-straight year, becoming a Unanimous First Teamer after being named a Unanimous Preseason All-American in February. The Trenton, Fla. native bashed 20 home runs for the second-consecutive season, becoming the third Gator to do so alongside Brad Wilkerson (1997-98) and Jud Fabian (2021-22). He finished the year with a .373/.498/.784 batting line, 21 homers, 83 runs, 57 RBI and 28 runs – which tied Mike Zunino’s program record.\n\nLastly, Jeroloman helped lift shortstop Josh Rivera to arguably the most impressive campaign of any middle infielder in team history, crushing a middle-infield record 19 homers in Orange & Blue accompanied by a .348/.447/.617 slash line. That performance made Rivera a Brooks Wallace Award Finalist, First Team All-SEC standout and Second Team All-American. The four-year Gators star also swiped a team-high 18 bags and delivered a .965 fielding percentage across 254 chances.\n\nGoing back to his third campaign with the Gators in 2022, Florida continued its program-best streak of consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances.The 2022 season marked the 18th time that Florida has hosted an NCAA Regional in addition to the program’s 37th NCAA Tournament appearance. After opening the first 40 games of the season with a 23-17 record (.575) and 6-12 mark in SEC play, Florida went 19-7 (.731) down the stretch, winning the final four SEC series of the season (9-3) while posting a 13-5 record against SEC teams. That included a trip to the SEC Tournament Championship, as the Gators were one of two teams to make it to the SEC Tourney semifinals each of the last two years.\n\nThanks in large part to Jeroloman, the Gators hit 121 home runs as a team in 2022 – the second-highest total in program history. For the first time ever, two Gators hit 20-plus home runs in the same season: outfielders Wyatt Langford (26) and Jud Fabian (24). Langford’s 26 home runs tied Matt LaPorta’s team record set in 2005. Highlighted by his memorable, two-run walk-off home run over No. 20 Florida State on May 17, outfielder Sterlin Thompson turned in a sensational sophomore season at the plate as well. Across 254 at bats, Thompson batted .354/.443/.563 with a career-high 11 home runs, two triples, team-high 16 doubles, 59 runs, 51 RBI, 143 total bases and a team-high 10 steals.\n\nIn Jeroloman's second year on staff in 2021, the Gators went 8-1 in home series in the inaugural season at Florida Ballpark, ending the year on an eight-series home winning streak. En route to earning a school-record 13th-straight NCAA Regional berth, the Gators secured series wins over No. 3 Ole Miss, No. 2 Vanderbilt and Georgia. The Gators also started 3-0 at the SEC Tournament for the first time in 21 years, outscoring Kentucky, No. 8 Mississippi State and Alabama by a combined 24-4 margin.\n\nIn 2020, Jeroloman's first season on staff, Florida won its first 16 games, eclipsing the school record for consecutive wins to open a season previously set with 11-0 starts in 1989 and 2002. The Gators' winning streak was also the third-longest in school history, behind an 18-game run in 2012, and a 17-game streak in 2016. The run of season-opening wins included a sweep at No. 1 Miami, a series in which the Gators have won 15 of the last 18 meetings.\n\nFollowing Florida's only loss of the year, the COVID-19 pandemic led to the season's cancellation. Florida finished as the No. 1-ranked team all four of collegiate baseball's rankings, though only Collegiate Baseball Newspaper and the USA Today Coaches' Poll officially published rankings following the season's cancellation.\n\nAt the time of the cancellation, Florida ranked 10th nationally in fielding percentage (.984) and 12th in home runs (21).\n\nRedshirt junior third baseman Kirby McMullen finished second on the team with a .458 on-base percentage, in large part due to his team-leading 14 walks. McMullen's 14 runs also ranked second on the team.\n\nPrior to Florida\n\nFollowing a seven-year professional playing career, Jeroloman entered the coaching ranks and accumulated eight seasons of collegiate coaching experience, including six years in the state of Florida, helping lead both Jacksonville and USF to NCAA Regional berths. He is also familiar with the Southeastern Conference, having started 170 games at shortstop for Auburn from 2002-04 before being drafted by the Boston Red Sox.\n\nJeroloman joined the Gators after spending the 2018 and 2019 seasons at South Florida, where he served as the lead assistant coach and recruiting coordinator. He primarily worked with the Bulls’ hitters, infielders, outfielders and base running.\n\nIn 2019, Jeroloman was key in the development of senior first baseman Joe Genord, who earned First Team All-AAC honors after hitting .333 with 13 home runs and 52 RBI. In total, three players hit over .300 on the season, including redshirt sophomore Jake Sullivan, a converted catcher who became the Bulls’ everyday third baseman and hit .340 over the team’s last 31 games.\n\nIn his first season with the Bulls in 2018, USF had its highest finish in AAC history (2nd place) and earned a berth in the NCAA tournament. The offense led the nation with 2.49 doubles per game and finished second in the entire country with 147 doubles. Five hitters finished the season batting over .300 as USF broke conference offensive records in doubles, slugging percentage (.464), batting average (.296) and total bases (951). Six Bulls earned All-Conference honors, led by third baseman David Villar, who also earned Third Team All-America honors.\n\nIn four seasons coaching at Jacksonville University, Jeroloman helped the Dolphins improve their win total each season, culminating in 2017 as JU went 36-23 and won its first regular season A-SUN Conference Championship in 11 years with a 16-5 record in league play.\n\nJeroloman served as Jacksonville’s recruiting coordinator and primarily worked with the hitters, infielders, outfielders and catchers. In four seasons, he helped guide six position players to All-Conference honors and four freshmen to A-SUN All-Freshmen honors. In 2014, infielder Scott Schaub earned Third Team All-America honors from the NCBWA and finished fifth in the nation with a .407 batting average.\n\nUnder Jeroloman, the Dolphins were consistently near the top of the A-SUN in fielding percentage and hitting. In his four years, Jacksonville compiled a .299 batting average in conference play and hit over .300 in two seasons. In the same span, JU had a .975 fielding percentage in league games. In 2014, JU led the league in conference play in fielding percentage (.979). The team broke the school record for single-season fielding percentage in 2016 (.971).\n\nJeroloman joined the TCU staff under Jim Schlossnagle for the 2012-13 seasons and helped lead the Horned Frogs to the Mountain West title and NCAA Super Regional appearance in 2012. He worked primarily with TCU’s hitters, infielders and catchers. In the second half of the 2012 season, he helped the team surge to a .294 batting average and .488 slugging percentage.\n\nUnder his tutelage, TCU finished third nationally in double plays in 2012 with a pair of freshman playing the middle infield positions. In the 2013 regular season, TCU led the Big 12 and ranked in the top 25 nationally in fielding percentage (.976).\n\nFollowing his playing career, Jeroloman entered the coaching ranks at Palm Beach Central High School (2008-11). In three seasons, every infielder and catcher he coached received a college scholarship.\n\nWhile at Auburn, Jeroloman was the starting shortstop for three seasons on the Plains and played in 175 games, totaling 12 home runs and 91 RBI for the Tigers. He was selected in the 21st round of the 2004 MLB Draft by the Boston Red Sox and played four seasons in their organization, reaching as high as Triple-A Pawtucket. He also played four seasons of Independent baseball.\n\nBorn in Suffern, New York, Jeroloman attended Wellington High School in Wellington, Florida. Jeroloman and his wife, Tara, have three sons, Owen, Chase, and Brady. His brother, Brian, was a catcher for the Gators from 2004-06.\n\nTHE CHUCK JEROLOMAN FILE\n\nBirthdate: Sept. 14, 1982\n\nHometown: Suffern, N.Y.\n\nHigh School: Wellington HS (Wellington, Fla.)\n\nEducation: Auburn University, 2001-2004 (drafted by Boston Red Sox following junior year)\n\nBachelor of Science, Management – University of Phoenix, 2011\n\nCoaching Career:\n\nAssistant Coach, University of Florida, 2020-present\n\nAssistant Coach/Recruiting Coordinator, University of South Florida, 2018-19\n\nAssistant Coach/Recruiting Coordinator, University of Jacksonville, 2014-17\n\nVolunteer Assistant Coach, TCU, 2012-13\n\nAssistant Coach, Palm Beach Central HS, 2008-11\n\nCollegiate Playing Career:\n\nAuburn University, 2002-04\n\nProfessional Playing Career:\n\nBoston Red Sox Organization (Drafted in 21st round in 2004)\n\nLowell (Mass.)
