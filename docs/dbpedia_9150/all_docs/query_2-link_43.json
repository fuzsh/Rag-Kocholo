        "text": "Thursday, April 11 at 7:30pm\n\nThe TowneBank Jazz Series celebrates one of the world’s greatest composers and jazz saxophonists of all time – Wayne Shorter. As equally renowned for his compositions as his saxophone playing, Shorter contributed many songs to the jazz canon while participating in some of the major changes in jazz music for more than 50 years. He received 12 GRAMMY awards for his recordings and was recognized with a lifetime achievement honor from the Recording Academy in 2015. Shorter was a seminal member of Mile Davis’ famous quintet of the 1960s and co-founded one of the most successful jazz fusion bands ever, Weather Report. In 2023, Netflix released Zero Gravity, a moving documentary on his life, produced by Brad Pitt.\n\nMore Info Buy Tickets\n\nThursday, May 16 at 7:30pm\n\nGiacomo Gates does more than sing “a bunch of songs.” He is truly an entertainer for all ages and styles. Audiences will enjoy his music, his interaction on the bandstand with his musicians, his spontaneity and humor, the stories about the music and composers and their relation to everyday life. Everyone will be smiling and having a good time, while thoroughly enjoying the music. What often lacks in many of today’s performances will be obviously present… fun!\n\nMore Info Buy Tickets\n\nThursday, June 20 at 7:30pm\n\nUnassumingly virtuosic and emotionally genuine, New York-based, London-born vocalist Tessa Souter has recorded five critically acclaimed CDs - Listen Love (Nara, 2004), Nights of Key Largo (Venus, 2008), Obsession (Motema, 2009), Beyond the Blue (Motema-Venus, 2012), and her latest, Picture in Black and White (NOA, 2018). “There are many singers who can wow us with vocal prowess, yet there’s something raw and real about hearing Tessa Souter sing,” wrote John Payne in the LA Weekly. “Basically a self-taught musician, she is not afraid to take big risks in her performances with surprising takes on often just as surprisingly un-standard repertoire, from jazz arrangements of ‘Eleanor Rigby,’ Cream’s ‘White Room’ and Nick Drake’s ‘River Man’ to covers of Brazilian compositions by Milton Nascimento and Dori Caymmi, modern jazz tunes by Wayne Shorter and Kenny Barron, originals such as her own mesmerizing ‘Usha’s Wedding’ and superb arrangements of classical stuff by Chopin, Beethoven, Debussy and others. Picture in Black and White explores the tangled roots of her biracial heritage. It’s the sound of an artist doing things her own way.”\n\nMore Info Buy Tickets\n\nThursday, July 18 at 7:30pm\n\nThe TowneBank Jazz Series remembers David Crosby, who died in 2023. Crosby was a singer, songwriter and guitarist who helped create two of the most influential and beloved American bands of the classic-rock era of the 1960s and ’70s – the Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Mr. Crosby was inducted twice into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, as both a founding member of the Byrds and a founder of Crosby, Stills & Nash. He brought jazz influences to both groups, and in the process, broadened the possibilities of vocally driven folk-rock.\n\nMore Info Buy Tickets\n\nFeaturing Nate Najar & Daniela Soledade\n\nThursday, August 15 at 7:30pm\n\nInternational Brazilian music star Daniela Soledade and virtuoso jazz guitarist Nate Najar transport you to tropical Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with \"Love & Bossa Nova\" – an intimate performance of Bossa Nova music. Partners in life and music, Soledade and Najar travel the world doing what they love most – sharing their passion for Brazilian music.\n\n\"Following in her father’s and grandfather’s footsteps, vocalist Daniela Soledade is making her mark on the Brazilian jazz world... the singer evinces the quiet, intimate style of João Gilberto as she caresses the lyric — in English and Portuguese — with apparent affection.”\n\nOf Nate Najar: “Nate’s playing is quietly spectacular and the sound he gets out of his unamplified guitar is a gorgeous song itself.” – Jazz Lives\n\nMore Info Buy Tickets\n\nThursday, September 19 at 7:30pm\n\nChuck Redd is an accomplished performer on both drums and vibraphone.
