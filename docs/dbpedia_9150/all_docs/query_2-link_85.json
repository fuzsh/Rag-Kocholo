        "text": "Julian Berkowitz is a drummer and educator residing in Washington, DC. Rooted in the deep tradition of American jazz, fusion, funk, and the rhythms of Brazil, Julian has quickly become one of the DC area’s most in-demand drummers. The son of a Jewish-American father and Brazilian mother, Julian was born and raised in the small town of Easton, Connecticut. His first experience with the drums began at the age of 5, when he discovered the pots and pans in the kitchen doubled as a makeshift drum kit. In sixth grade, middle school band director and drummer Robert LaValle noticed Julian’s talent on the drums and became his first drum instructor, introducing him to funk and jazz music for the first time.\n\nUpon moving to Washington, DC in 2013 to attend The George Washington University, Julian was fortunate to study jazz with virtuoso Brazilian drummer Alejandro Lucini. Lucini’s mentorship was crucial in Julian’s development in both the straight-ahead jazz and Brazilian/Latin jazz spheres. Julian graduated from GWU in 2017 and began to explore the D.C. jazz scene.\n\nJulian has performed and/or recorded with musicians such as Benny Benack III, Kris Funn, Chuck Redd, Michael Bowie, Corcoran Holt, Mike Pope, Bill Heid, Tedd Baker, Herman Burney, Thad Wilson, Herb Scott, Alex Tremblay, and José André. Additionally, Julian played with international artist Michel Nirenberg on his 2017 and 2018 U.S. tours and accompanied smooth Latin jazz artist Debora Galan on her 2019 East Coast tour.\n\nJulian has performed at a number of venues in the DC metro area and beyond, including Blues Alley, Westminster Jazz Night in DC, Mr. Henry’s, Sharp 9 Gallery, Rams Head on Stage, Alice’s Jazz and Cultural Society, Twins Jazz, An Die Musik Live, Avalon Theatre, Jojo, and 49 West. He’s also performed at festivals such as the DC Jazz Festival and the West Virginia Jazz & Wine Festival.\n\nAs a bandleader, Julian frequently leads his own groups in trio, quartet, and quintet configurations at various music venues in the DMV area. Currently, Julian has a weekly Sunday night residency at Library Tavern, hosting a jam session with his trio.\n\nAs an educator, Julian teaches private drum lesson in DC. He’s also on staff as the drum instructor at Capitol Hill Day School."
