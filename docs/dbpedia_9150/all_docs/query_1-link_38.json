        "text": "25 Year Anniversary for Friends of Butte Creek!\n\nIn 1999, several Butte Creek aficionados, decided that to protect, restore and enhance the watershed, an environmental advocacy group was needed. That year they began drafting a mission, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to guide the future of the organization. FBC received Federal non-profit 501(c)3 status in early 2000. We have been growing ever since. In 2007, while visiting the South Yuba River Citizens League annual Film Festival, we decided to join the Wild and Scenic Film Festival on Tour program and brought the program to Paradise. We are now bringing the 18th Annual Wild and Scenic Film Festival On Tour to Chico, October 5th, at the ARC Pavilion at 2040 Park Avenue.\n\nAnd, this year we are celebrating our quarter century of efforts with a special dinner and films!\n\nTickets are available online here. More information will be forthcoming on the website and in our newsletter. Stay tuned and SAVE THE DATE, October 5th!\n\nSponsors and Silent Auction Donors are needed. Get your business, name or donate anonymously to help this great cause. Click here for more information about sponsorships.\n\nSpring Run Salmon Collapse\n\nEarly reports are indicating less than 100 spring run Chinook salmon have returned to Butte Creek this year. With the remains of last year run assaulted by sediment from a PG&E canal failure, It looks like two years in a row with less than 100 returning adults. Although Butte Creek is known for remarkable recoveries, the current trend is a disaster in light of climate change. We need the agencies to step and help us recover these iconic California Salmon! Photo collage by Michael Smith, Â© 2008.\n\nIt was a Lively Music Event at the End of Normal June 7!\n\nThe 3rd Annual Summer Kick-off Party with Butte Creek's own Dylan's Dharma, Smokey the Groove and Chico Favorites, The Funnels stoked the 300+ crowd. Nono San Pedro warmed up the crowd at 5:30. Tom Tom's Island Style, Tacos Puerta Vallarta and Green Paradise served the huge crowd and the usual libations of water, wine, and hometown beers from Mulberry Station and Sierra Nevada kept the crowd satiated.\n\nThank you S&S Produce, Melody Records and Pullins Cyclery , for providing direct tickets sales!\n\nHerbicides in the Canyon\n\nLast year Butte County used regualar untrained work crews, failed to report the usage and violated the label requirements for the herbicides when they sprayed the roadsides. The Ag Commissioner provided this summary and a complete report. They will be online soon. See for yourself how they have abused their authority. We need to stop herbicide spraying anywhere near our drainages, streams, creeks and rivers. We are slowly killing ourselves and our wildlife! Pictures are available in the complete report (19mb).\n\nEmergency Spring Run Salmon Rescue!!!\n\nThe BREAKING NEWS just keeps coming. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife and NOAA Fisheries began collecting yearling spring run salmon from Deer and Mill Creek this week. On Butte Creek they have captured 300 young of the year salmon for the program. This rescue is very unique as they are taking the fish into a captive breeding program, just like the California condors 40 years ago. This a serious situation to be in. We apparently have not had the where-with-all to figure out how to protect the habitat for these iconic fish, although some of us have been trying. It is time to step it up!\n\nSF Chronicle\n\nDaily Kos\n\nCDFW Press Release from Maven's Notebook\n\nReal Wild and Scenic Recommendation from BLM\n\nFilm Festival - Flume Failure - Float the Feather\n\nRead on..........\n\nBureau of Land Manangement Recommends Wild and Scenic River Status for Butte Creek\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is recommending that 5.7 miles of Butte Creek flowing through public lands in Butte County be added to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The recommendation is included in the agency’s draft Northwest California Integrated Plan (NCIP). The public has until December 28, 2023, to comment in support of protecting Butte Creek and many other streams flowing through public lands managed by the BLM in northern and northwestern California. Read more and comment.\n\nWild and Scenic Film Festival October 6th at the ARC Pavilion.\n\nLocal films on the devastating PG&E canal failure are ready for viewing! Click here\n\nIt was an evening of inspiration. We all know it takes a CommUNITY to achieve real change. We all learned that only 3.5% of the population can change the world. The takeaway from the Festival was \"Be part of the 3.5%\"!\n\nYou can join the mailing list here for regular updates.\n\nMourning the loss of Spring Run Salmon\n\nWe updated the community (over 100 people showed up) with details of the catastrophic landslide and sedimentation of Butte Creek caused by the failure of a PG&E canal. The situation, August 10-13, was devastating to the creek and the wildlife. We must not let PG&E continue to get away with destroying our watershed. The District Attorney and California Departmenet of Fish and Wildlife are investigating the incident and potential legal actions are possible. The full meeting was recorded is available here! It is quite entertaining!\n\nVideo of the canal failure and resulting landslide and sediment pollution. Click here..\n\nHere is more information about how to take action!\n\nSample letter to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, here, Action Alert, here.\n\nSample letter to Chuck Bonham, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, here.\n\nPresentation by Allen Harthorn on a path forward here.\n\nFloat the Feather next year!\n\nFriends of Butte Creek worked with our Feather River Partners to offer Spawning Salmon Tours on the river! The program has concluded for the year but we'll be back again next year.That's right, you can float the river with salmon scientists and see and learn about the importance of Spring Run Chinook Salmon in the Feather River and the close relationship with Butte Creek Spring Run.\n\nFriends of Butte Creek now owns a Water Right!\n\nOn March 17th, 2023, the Butte County Clerk/Recorder finalized the Grant Deed transfer of a water right on Butte Creek to the Friends of Butte Creek. Thanks to the visions of many, in particular, Huey Johnson, the 33 year process has been completed. Huey, former California Secretary of Resources, founder of the Trust for Public Land and Resource Renewal Institute, envisioned a water trust, modeled after the land trust philosphy, and he found his test case on Butte Creek. Thanks to the Wildlife Conservation Board for providing for the purchase and their guidance through the water rights transfer. \"It is a historic time for Butte Creek, we now have a dedicated instream flow for salmon and steelhead and all other aquatic life owned by a local non-profit group.\" Read the Press Release and how you can help! Please contribute to the water endowment. Read the info below, Michael Smith Salmon Water Endowment.\n\nSaving our Foothills-Saving Salmon-Saving our Hometown - Join us to Stop the Sprawl\n\nStop the Sprawl-Save our Hometown\n\nA watershed is exactly that. a basin where all the water runs off into creeks, streams, rivers, lakes and the ocean. Butte Creek’s upper basin drains mostly intact conifer forests, and healthy meadows, with very little development. There are but a few hundred homes, cabins and businesses in Butte Meadows, Jonesville, Stirling City and Forest Ranch that drain to Butte Creek, from over a hundred thousand acres. Magalia, Paradise and the Little Butte Creek watershed represents around 10 % of the watershed and although it was a large urban area it now has less that half of the homes and businesses prior to the Camp Fire.

Sadly, the genius who helped set it up and paid for all the equipment passed away in June. We are still grieving the loss of such an incredible human being. We are searching for people who can help us get it back on line.We hope to expand the Salmoncam program to have a couple wildlife cameras and possibly an underwater camera.\n\nWild and Scenic Film Festival on Tour - Another Big Success\n\nThere are Currents of Hope in the future that will bring great promise to the lives and habitats of the Spring Run Chinook Salmon and Steelhead on Butte Creek. Thank you for all your support through the years and please join our email list. Please consider a donation to FBC.\n\nOur Appraisal fund for the Butte Creek Water Right we are acquiring is still in need of $$ to offset the out of pocket $25,000 we paid for the appraisal.\n\nThe big DONATE button to the left will help fund our general support.\n\nBelow is the Endowment Fund set up to pay the watermaster fees for the water right in perpetuity.\n\nAppraisal Fund\n\nEndowment Fund\n\nThe Michael Smith Salmon Water Endowment Fund\n\nLong-time board member, close friend and fishing compadre, Michael Smith, passed away November 9, 2021. The void in our hearts is vast, but his spirit is filling it with love. He has literally been on this Friends of Butte Creek journey since the day we first met 26 years ago. I know he sits on my shoulder, flies with the eagles and swims with the salmon.\n\nAnd to ensure his legacy is never forgotten, we have established the MIchael Smith Salmon Water Endowment Fund with the North Valley Community Foundation. This fund will provide the annual costs of maintaining a dedicated instream water right for salmon that Friends of Butte Creek is purchasing. It will also support future stream flow enhancements that we are currently working on. Contributions can be made online, via credit card, through ACH or by check. Should you want to mail a check, the address is: 1811 Concord Avenue, Suite 220, Chico CA 95928. Please make the check out to: Michael Smith Salmon Water Endowment.\n\nVisit North Valley Community Foundation\n\n2021 Final Report on Adult Monitoring - Bad News!\n\nCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife releases the bad news about the 2021 Phoenix Butte Creek Salmon. Although an estimated 21,580 salmon returned from brood year 2018 (Camp Fire), 19,773 died before spawning due to elevated water temperature and poor water management. We are running out if time, running out of options and the only safe place for Butte Creek Spring Run Salmon is higher in the watershed! It is time to get it done before we start losing entire year classes of these remarkable fish. View the report.... Also read the FBC blog post response from the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance here.\n\nHere they come again!!! Spring Run Salmon also Fly!\n\nFish Flow Forever Fund\n\nFriends of Butte Creek is getting an appraisal of the value of a water right of 5 cubic feet per second (cfs) that is dedicated to Butte Creek from April 15 through October 15 and an additional 1.5 cfs dedicated to the stream the rest of the year. The combined volume of water for fish is over 2000 acre-feet. The appraisal must be completed prior to the transfer of the water right. FBC is responsible for the cost associated with the initial appraisal. all other costs are covered by the grant funds from the California Wildlife Conservation Board. With this in mind we are asking for your help to cover these initial cost. We have established a GoFundMe site for you to donate to help us reach our goal. Read more on the donation page.\n\nThe 2021 Return!\n\n2018 was a tough year for Butte Creek and the spring run salmon. Less than 2000 fish were estimated to have spawned successfully. The Camp Fire broke out just as salmon were emerging from the gravel. Massive efforts to protect the creek from toxic runoff most likely helped usher the juveniles out of the canyon and on to the ocean. Now we are seeing the adults return, and return they are. Record numbers have been seen everywhere in the system, from Colusa to the upper reaches above Centerville. We will keep you posted! Follow the Facebook page.\n\nWatch the video: Helltown Pool #1\n\nButte Creek Water Legacy\n\nWe have exciting news on our Wildlife Conservation Board grant for the purchase of a water right dedicated to the creek and its' creatures. The water that was formerly dedicated to agricultural use was no longer needed by the right holder and was transferred to instream flow dedication. We have finished all the apprasial process and will be going into escrow in 2023 to formalize the purchase and transfer to FBC. We have established an Endowment for Butte Creek through the North Valley Community Foundation(see above). We need to raise another $10,000 to guarantee the funds necessary to maintain that right in perpetuity. In addition we are pursuing other opportunities to build upon this success.\n\nSpawning 2020\n\nOur spring run salmon are doing their thing. Scroll down to see past years' video action. The run is small, but healthy and ready to complete the cycle. The growing bear population is feasting on the carcasses and sharing the nutrients far and wide in the environment. Bear video As this crazyyyyyy year winds down, we complete our annual cycle as well.\n\nFriends of Butte Creek assisted the Butte Creek Canyon Volunteer Fire Company to apply for a grant to upgrade their fire protection equipment and were successful! The California Fire Foundation awarded the Company $15,000 toward the purchase and installation of a Skid Unit Pumper that fits in the department pickup truck. It carries 300 gallons of water and can carry fire fighting foam also. Friends of Butte Creek donated our time to write the grant and added $1000 to the project as a local match. We are proud to help our brave firefighters and the Company!\n\n2019 Salmon Count\n\nThe last we heard in September 2019 was that there were probably just over 6000 wild spring run salmon in Butte Creek based on the annual snorkel survey and fish counter data from the spring. California Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists do a follow up survey counting spawned out carcasses in late September and through October. The final count: a whopping 15,000 salmon. This represents over 90% of the total Central Valley Spring Run population. Once again, the resiliency of these fish amazes everyone.\n\nWe SAVED OUR TREES Butte County removed nearly 700 trees along Centerville and Honey Run Roads. Surveys by Friends of Butte Creek and two retired arborists found many trees with very little, and in some cases, no damage as a result of the fire. Many trees still had green moss almost to the base, little scarring, and no loss of bark thickness. The Butte County Public Works Department heard from you and the Supervisors and dozens of trees were saved including this Oracle oak on Centerville Road.\n\nInteractive Tree Map\n\nSave These Trees\n\nFROM FIRE TO FLOOD.

You can browse the County website on the Overlay by clicking here. Information workshops were held onÂ June 30, and October 27, 2016 and January 26 and April 27, 2017 in Oroville. The revised overlay has been approved by the Planning Commission. February 27, 2018 the proposed Overlay was presented to the County Supervisors for approval to include this as part of the General Plan, a process that was started eight years ago. The Supervisors approved the Overlay on April 24th.\n\n2018 Salmon are not yet spawning but you can watch the action from 2017 here! Day 1 and 2.\n\nBreaking News\n\nCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife proposes a minimum instream flow of 120 cfs below Durham Mutual Dam for safe passage for salmon and steelhead. Currently there is no minimum flow and almost every years dozens, and in some cases hundreds of spring run salmon have died before spawning below this dam on their migration to upper Butte Creek. The unusually hard and resistent Lahar rock formation has limited channels with sufficient width and depth for safe passage for the salmon, especially at low water. Water diverters may have to limit their diversions until all fish have moved upstream. The list of priority streams, the Butte Creek flow study and plan, and the Public Resources Code are available at these links.\n\nPriority Streams; Butte Creek Flow Study; Public Resources Code\n\nAbove: Durham Mutual Dam and the downstream rock formation\n\nBreaking News: PG&E wants to cut and run on the DeSabla-Centerville hydroelectric project, read the article.\n\nPG&E has decided to withdraw their application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for the continued operation of the DeSabla-Centerville Hydroelectric Project. Essentially they are nullyfying 12 years of work by agencies, NGO's and their own staff, not to mention millions of dollars, and they have put the project on the market. Read the press release. If a buyer is not found PG&E could be forced to decommission the whole project. Meanwhile the deadbeat Centerville Head Dam will continue to block fish passage for no reason.\n\nSpring Run Chinook Salmon Symposium\n\nJuly 26-28, 2016\n\nChico, CA\n\nSalmonid Restoration Federation and Friends of Butte Creek brought back this Symposium focused on Spring Run Chinook Salmon. The first day was updates and research presentations followed by two days of tours of Butte, Mill, Deer, Clear Creeks.\n\nClick here for more information.\n\nBears in Butte Creek\n\nBears appear to have taken a serious toll on the few salmon that made it up to spawn in 2015. Low water and lots of hungry bears made it easy pickings for the bears. Check out the great shots from Suji Roland of a spawning salmon snatched from her redd by the mama bear. Her two cubs were waiting on shore for lunch. We will be creating a wildlife page to share all the great pictures that Friends have been taking.
