In 2008, he was a featured soloist in the finale concert at The Lionel Hampton International Jazz Festival with The Lionel Hampton Big Band and the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. In February 2013, Redd performed with the Dream Band co-led with Jeff Hamilton in a salute to vibes legend Terry Gibbs.[3]\n\nRecent engagements include stints with Bucky Pizzarelli and Ken Peplowski at Dizzy's Club (Jazz at Lincoln Center) performances at Smalls Jazz Club and Jazz at the Kitano in New York City, jazz cruises, and jazz festivals around the US. He has toured and performed with Dizzy Gillespie, Mel Tormé, Tommy Flanagan, Dick Hyman, Ray Brown, Monty Alexander, Laurindo Almeida, Tal Farlow, Rebecca Kilgore, Scott Hamilton, Mickey Roker, and Houston Person.[2]\n\nRedd is a regular featured performer at The Shedd Institute's Oregon Festival of American Music, The Roswell Jazz Festival, The Newport Beach Jazz Party and The W. C. Handy Music Festival. He has been the director of Oregon Festival of American Music 2019.\n\nRedd served as Artist-In-Residence at The Smithsonian Jazz Café in Washington, DC from 2004–2008.[3] In addition to leading his own groups, he was a member of the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra for 15 years.[3]\n\nRedd is on the faculty at The University of Maryland School of Music and presents master classes, workshops and lectures around the country.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nRedd is featured on over 75 recordings, including his Arbors Records albums, The Common Thread, Happy All the Time: Chuck Redd Remembers Barney Kessel, and All This and Heaven Too; Chopin Jazz with Rossano Sportiello, You're My Everything with Dick Hyman and Jay Leonhart, and Can't Take My Eyes Off You with vocalist Nicki Parrott. He can be heard on the soundtrack to the television series, The Great Chefs and the NPR broadcast Jazz Smithsonian.[3] His Arbors album Happy All the Time is a critically acclaimed tribute to his mentor, Barney Kessel, featuring Monty Alexander and Jeff Hamilton. When Redd is Blue is a collaboration with his brother, pianist Robert Redd, featuring saxophonist Harry Allen.
