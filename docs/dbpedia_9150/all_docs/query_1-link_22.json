        "text": "By Lillian Landreth\n\n“When rodeo comes around, that’s my family. That’s my circle. It’s the cowboy lifestyle, being gentlemen, hardworking, God fearing, country loving, raising your family, and trying to do right. That’s what I see, and I like to portray that to the younger generation,” says rodeo photographer Chuck Miner.\n\nA ranch raised cowboy from Mandan, North Dakota, Chuck rode bulls from his teens until hanging up his spurs in 2018. COVID hit just as he was pursuing a new adventure in rodeo announcing in 2020 and shut down most of his shows. Chuck, who is an artist at heart, decided to pursue photography. He had dabbled in wildlife photography while working for the Fish and Game Department. A good friend helped him buy his first camera and he drove to South Dakota to shoot their high school rodeos. “Growing up around rodeo, you know what to look for, and I got a lot of encouragement from a lot of people.”\n\nCapturing Goals\n\nChuck met his goal of being hired to shoot the North Dakota Rodeo Association Finals in 2021. He was also hired in 2021 by the company who shot the NHSFR in Lincoln, Nebraska. In 2022, he completed his PRCA permit and his first photo was published in ProRodeo Sports News. Last year, he shot the 2023 WNFR as a media photographer, and his next goal is to be nominated as the official photographer of the WNFR, National Breakaway Roping Finals, or National Steer Roping Finals.\n\nBetter ‘n Bulls\n\n“I shoot a Nikon D850. It only shoots 9 frames per second, but it’s challenging to me to know when to time it, and I like to challenge myself.” Chuck especially enjoys capturing breakaway and tie-down roping. A highlight of his upcoming summer schedule is Cheyenne Frontier Days, while shooting high school rodeos and even senior photos continues to feed his hometown roots. “I thank God for what I’m doing. It’s a heck of a lot better than when I was riding bulls. Any little part of still being involved in the sport I grew up in and love is a feather in my cap.”\n\nChuck’s work can be found on his Facebook page Chuck Miner, or Instagram cm_4_bar_c_photos\n\n#ChuckMinerPhotography, #RodeoPhotographer, #WesternLifestyle, #CowboyCulture, #RodeoLife, #WesternPhotography, #NikonPhotography, #RodeoGoals, #PRCAphotographer, #CheyenneFrontierDays #RodeoFamily #RodeoCommunity #ThatsRodeoToMe #RodeoLife"
