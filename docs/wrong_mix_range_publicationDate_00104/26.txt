"The Canterbury Tales" is a collection of stories written in Middle English, set within a narrative frame of a group of pilgrims traveling to the shrine of Thomas Becket in Canterbury.

The tales cover a wide range of genres and themes, including romance, humor, morality, and social commentary.

The Contribution of the Knight to Early English Literature Thomas Malory - Sir Thomas Malory (c. 1415- 1471) was an English writer and knight known for his work "Le Morte d'Arthur," one of the most famous and influential works of Arthurian literature. Malory is believed to have been a member of the gentry and a soldier, although his life details are somewhat obscure. He wrote "Le Morte d'Arthur" while imprisoned, likely in the 1460s, during the Wars of the Roses, a series of conflicts for control of the English throne. "Le Morte d'Arthur" is a compilation of Arthurian legends, bringing together various tales of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, and their adventures. 3 At the end of the lesson, the learners should be able to: The Ballad in the Philippines: A Cultural Exploration The Ballad in the Philippines: A Cultural Exploration Enrichment Activity: Formative Assessment: English communication Arts and Skills Psalm 95:1-2 (NIV):

Historical ballads narrate significant events, such as battles, revolts, and important milestones in Philippine history. Folk heroes and heroines are often celebrated in ballads, highlighting their courage and contributions. 3. Cultural Importance: Ballads serve as a means of passing down oral traditions, cultural values, and historical knowledge from one generation to the next. These narratives contribute to the preservation of local languages and dialects, as they are often composed in regional languages. 4. Performance and Adaptation: Traditionally, ballads were performed orally, often accompanied by musical instruments like guitars or traditional Filipino instruments.

Introduction: This early part of the story includes exposition—backstory information about the setting and the protagonist, or main character. After introducing the key elements of your story, present an inciting incident—also known as an exciting force—that disrupts the status quo of the story and sets the plot into motion. 2.

42. 3. Climax: The rising action culminates in a climax, or the turning point of the story arc. At this stage, the protagonist faces their main conflict head-on, opposing the antagonistic force of the story—typically a villain. 4. Falling action: Immediately following the climax, the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist unravels, creating suspense about the final outcome. The falling action is often out of the protagonist’s control. 5. Resolution: Sometimes called the denouement, the resolution of a story concludes the plot, tying up loose ends and answering final questions. 3 English Punctuation A Short History of Punctuation Engagement activity: Formative assessment: Online Links: SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE

Speech Choir Speech choir or choral speaking has a hallowed and proud tradition. The first plays put on by Greeks featuring choruses of speakers. Today, speech choir is a popular teaching tool, as well as a performing art in itself. Speech choir operates like a music choir minus the music. Instead of singing, speech choirs perform spoken-word pieces. It is a powerful art that is experiencing a revival. A. Conventional Speech Choir - also called “traditional”. Has no use of costumes, nor props, nor choreography the choir simply speaks or reads a literary piece. Engagement activity: Video Clip with guide questions.

SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE INTEGRITY “Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, and please the widow’s cause.” (Isaiah 1:17)

61. B. Theatrical Speech Choir - also called “dynamic”. The reverse of the conventional speech choir. Elements of a Speech 1.Members A speech choir is typically the same size as a singing choir having anywhere from 12-100 members or more. More schools and competitions feature choirs of 25 to 40 members. The group is typically are divided into groups based on the members’ natural voices or speaking voices. 2. Pieces Selections are typically poems or poetic passage such as

62. from Greek dramas or Shakespeare's plays. The conductor gives some thought to the passage, breaking into parts. Facial expressions and intonation are also carefully planned so all the members can practice in unison. Solo parts for specific members can add dramatic effect. 3. Choreography Choreography of movement is not necessary component for speech choir. Many successful competition choirs recite their pieces while standing in place with their hands at their sides, attention directed solely at the conductor. Thus, movement is a part of the rich history of speech choir and some conductors choose to choreograph elaborate movement to accompany their pieces. In the Greek tradition, speech choirs marched from side to side in alternating patterns

63. called “strophe” and “aristrophe”. The sequence of steps and movements in dance. 4. Costuming As with any other performance art, thought should be put into how the speech choir will dress. Costumes can be as simple as matching outfits or robes, such as a vocal choir would wear, or elaborate theatrical garb. Plain uniforms allow the audience to concentrate on facial expressions and allow the choir to recite several very different pieces in one performance. *Themed costume for a single piece can highlight its meaning or help to differentiate between voice groups. 5. Voice quality The ability to combine successfully the light, medium, and dark voices in the choir. The ability to communicate, through voice, reactions to thoughts or emotions.

64. 6. Number of Voices The ability to add or subtract whole sections, banks, smaller groups, or solo speakers to increase or diminish the power or richness of the sound to better express the meaning. 7. Pitch - It refers to the variations of the voice on the musical scale is generally referred to as infection. Children generally have little problem with pitch because they use it naturally and freely. 8.. Power Ability to use volume, force or loudness as emphasis in appropriate places to better express feeling and meaning. A power build should be related to the elements of a sentence and growing emotion. 8. Tempo It refers to the rate of speed at which a reading progresses. The ability to balance the rhythm of a piece and the tempo of performance. Tempo should relate to the

65. central “beat” of the poem. If it is too fast or too slow. 9. Staging The ability to successfully organized and position the choir on stage or risers for performance effect. The ability to stage entrances and exits which enhance the mood of the poem and performance. The ability to stage entrances and exits which enhance the mood of the poem and performance. 2 At the end of the lesson, the learners should be able to: To prepare oneself for Speech Choir; To rehearse presentation with peer.
