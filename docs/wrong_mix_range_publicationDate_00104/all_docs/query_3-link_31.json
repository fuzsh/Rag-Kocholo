The primitive audience was an audience of shock-heads, gaping round the campfire, fatigued with contending against the mammoth or the woolly rhinoceros, and only kept awake by suspense. What would happen next? The novelist droned on, and as soon as the audience guessed what happened next, they either fell asleep or killed him.”\n\n—E.M. Forster, Aspects of the Novel\n\nWhere does writing come from? By looking at examples of literature that were initially meant to be spoken aloud, we will explore how they were placed, elegantly and not, onto the page. How does this happen? The bardic boom, the pulpit pitch, the mad futurist with a megaphone—so many of the great works of literature were first delivered orally, then spelled out and called literature. Speeches, psalms, slams, rants, anecdotes, manifestos, declarations, sermons, lectures, yarns, ballads, brags, jeremiads, prayers, incendiary instructions for the coming revolution—we’ll investigate as many as we can of these in the readings, considering, as writers, how we can get performative narratives of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction from the stage to the page. We will discuss, too, the instructive aspect of art and literature, the difference between voice and style, and how oral culture differs from written culture, with a serious take on Walter Ong’s Orality and Literacy. We will consider formal prosody, rhetoric, and poetic forms, and original and amusing methods inventive writers come up with to interpret the sound of speech. Readings may include sermons by John Donne, Toni Morrison, and Herman Melville; prayers and suras from Adam Zagejewski and the Koran, Brags from Beowulf, Beastie Boys, Sharon Olds, and Shmuel HaNagid, anecdotes from Ivan Turgenev, Tatyana Tolstaya, and Olga Tokarczuk, murder ballads from Cole Porter and Dolly Parton, speeches and declarations from Susan B Anthony and Frederick Douglass, and jeremiads by Jamaica Kincaid, Valerie Solanis, and Joy Williams.\n\nWhile writing your own fictions (not necessarily from the oral tradition), we will discuss the instructive aspect of art and literature, the difference between style and voice, how delivery by great orators can change the meaning of the material, and how the speech on the page has its own specific power that makes it, in its way, a second, separate work of literature.\n\nTeaching Method Reading, lecture, discussion, workshop.\n\nEvaluation:\n\n4 short creative writing projects in fiction, prompts as given\n\n1 long creative writing project in fiction\n\n1 optional revision of one of the 4 projects for revised grade\n\n2 short papers (2-3 pages), called annotations\n\nCourse Requirements:\n\nCreative work (50%)\n\nShort Papers (30%)\n\nClass participation (20%)\n\nEnglish 309Advanced Creative Cross-Genre Writing: Spoken Word and the Radiophonic ImaginationBresland\n\nTTh\n\n11-12:20\n\nEnglish 309 Advanced Creative Cross-Genre Writing: Spoken Word and the Radiophonic Imagination\n\nCourse Description: Students write and produce multiple prose and poetic works, layering spoken word with evocative sonic textures, tones, instrumentation and silence. This course places equal emphasis on literary quality, vocal performance and production value. We act as writers, performers, producers as we listen deeply into contemporary radio practice. We also encourage one another to experiment, to try weird ideas, to take risks. We will investigate what it means to write for the ear (as opposed to the page or screen), and we will learn to connect with the listener. In the process of producing multiple audio works, we will acquire numerous audio production skills. We will write frequently, speak frequently and in varied styles. We will use field mics and studio mics as we harness our unique voices and the voices of others. We will also compute a fair bit as we learn to use audio editing software to produce polished, multilayered soundscapes. By winter’s end, we will be more practiced writers, more accomplished multimedia performers and producers, possess a greater number of technological skills and a greater range of artistic expression.\n\nEnglish 392Situation of WritingBouldrey\n\nMW\n\n12:30-1:50\n\nEnglish 392 Situation of Writing\n\nCourse Description: The situation of writing requires that we create literature, as well as the contexts in which literature is shared, appreciated and understood. We are the inheritors, perpetuators and innovators of literary culture, and in this class, we will position our inquiries on the present and future, even as we acknowledge the enduring humanistic values of creative writing. We will begin with a discussion of ideas about shaping the literary traditions of the United States starting with Melville, and moving quickly to those who have led or lead in shaping that tradition by shaping it or walking away from it—Roxane Gay, Adrienne Rich, Richard Baldwin, and others. Then we will build on these ideas practically with a service learning assignment and a creative work that reaches a new public, coordinates new media or engenders community. Our class will be enhanced by the annual Return Engagement series, featuring visits and readings from alumni of Northwestern’s Writing Program. My intention is to have a conversation that will unfold in real-time between us all, and will evolve into a learning experience that is both pragmatically useful and philosophically illuminating. My hope is that this class will help us to become more conscious of our motives and processes as writers; that it will allow us to more lucidly defend creative writing as an art form and a vital contribution to society; and that it will acquaint us with the productions of literary culture, including their changing technological platforms and their relationship to social structures. This course is part of the Hewlett Diversity Initiative, and as part of this program, we will investigate literature and culture through the lens of social inequalities and diversities.\n\nEnglish 393-1Theory and Practice of PoetryAbani\n\nMW\n\n3:30-4:50\n\nEnglish 393-1 Theory and Practice of Poetry\n\nCourse Description: This selective-enrollment, yearlong \"Sequence\" is designed to make students 64 Return to Calendar increasingly informed readers and self-sustaining apprentices of poetry. The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry -- including description, rhetoric, story and song -- and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of \"Daily Poems,\" thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others -- work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing.\n\nNote: No P/N registration.

As the genre of what Milton called “heroic song,” though, epic predates even the invention of writing, and is perhaps the oldest form of poetic production. What has allowed such epic success? The persistence of epic through cultural and linguistic change is one of the form’s central themes: how can words heroically uttered and deeds heroically dared be passed on from one lifetime to those that follow? How are they transformed? What does it mean to take up as one’s own something that has been passed down from a culture no longer present? Such questions become even more pressing in moments when one culture encounters another and in its new context must confront what to retain, what to adopt, and what to invent. In this course we will consider how epic narrative projects, recalls, and reworks its history as tradition. Benefitting from several recent translations of epic poems by women, we will consider the role of gender in epic. Finally, we will look at contemporary epics that push back against the histories that have often been associated with the genre and find new themes in the form.\n\nTexts: Homer, Iliad (transl. Wilson); Vergil, Aeneid (transl. Bartsch); Beowulf (transl. Headley); Milton, Paradise Lost; Atwood, The Penelopiad; Wolcott, Omeros; as well as selections from other epic poems\n\nObjectives: Students will become acquainted with the principal formal features of the genre of epic through the study of a number of representative works in the genre. In addition they will be introduced to some theories of epic, both current and historical. They will learn something of the genre’s history of self-reflection, cultural contexts within which epic appears, and some of the cultural uses to which epic has been set. They will consider how epic differs from two other long narrative forms, novel and romance. Using these materials, they will sharpen critical argumentation skills orally and in writing.\n\nEnglish 200Literary Histories: All the Single Ladies: Spinsters, Wives and Madwomen from 1800 to the Present (Historical Breadth Post 1830)Winter\n\nTTh\n\n12:30-1:50\n\nEnglish 200 Literary Histories: All the Single Ladies: Spinsters, Wives and Madwomen from 1800 to the Present (Historical Breadth Post 1830)\n\nCourse Description: Following Beyoncé’s iconic call to action, this course takes a look at a number of “single ladies” - and a few who managed to “put a ring on it” - in literature, film and TV from the last two hundred years. Together, we will investigate archetypal figures of femininity, from the spinster to the madwoman to today’s “girlboss.” How do our literary and popular media construct and deconstruct these categories at different moments in history? Pairing feminist theory with primary texts, we’ll ask: how does marriage function to resolve class tensions? How does it construct and enforce constructions of race and gender? And how, according to these texts, can women find social, emotional and financial independence? Texts may include selections from Jane Eyre, The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands, A Room of One’s Own, Conversations with Friends, Sex and the City, and The Bachelor.\n\nTeaching Method: Seminar discussion, short lectures\n\nEvaluation Method: Participation, analytical essays and a final project\n\nTexts including ISBNs: Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte (ISBN 9780141441146), Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands by Mary Seacole (ISBN 0140439021), A Room of One's Own by Virginia Woolf ( ISBN 0156787334), Conversations with Friends by Sally Rooney (ISBN 0156787334), Bridget Jones's Diary dir. Sharon Maguire (2001), selections from Sex and the City created by Darren Star (1998-2004) and The Bachelor created by Mike Fleiss (2002-2024)\n\nTexts will be available at: Required novels at Norris Bookstore.

In response to Taylor’s outrage, Kim Kardashian released a recorded phone call between Taylor and Kanye in which she seemed to approve the controversial lyric, and called Taylor a “snake.” This suggestion of Taylor’s deceit spread quickly through public opinion, and #TaylorSwiftisaSnake went viral across social media platforms. What does it mean to call a woman a snake? What does such a comparison seek to express about someone’s intentions, or even their ethics? And what happens when women accused of sn(e)akiness lean into rather than away from the comparison? We will consider these questions in a winding investigation of snakey women through the ages and across a variety of narrative forms. From the bond between Eve and a serpent in the biblical story of Adam and Eve’s fall from grace to the bond between dragon-rider Rhaenyra Targaryen and her dragon (HBO series, “House of the Dragon”), from Melusine, a medieval folkloric figure cursed with the body of a serpent from the waist down, to Medusa, the monstrous snake-haired woman of Greek mythology, this class will examine how premodern and modern representations of serpentine femininity treat issues of gender and power.\n\nTexts may include: Excerpts from the Old Testament; Ovid’s Metamorphoses; Melusine; the HBO series “Game of Thrones”; and “House of the Dragon”; as well as selections from medieval illuminated manuscripts and social media.\n\nEnglish 200Literary Histories: American Nightmare: Race Science from the 18th Century to the Present (Historical Breadth Post 1830)Bergh\n\nMW\n\n2-3:20\n\nEnglish 200 Literary Histories: American Nightmare: Race Science from the 18th Century to the Present (Historical Breadth Post 1830)\n\nCourse Description: Is the American dream only a white dream, even a fantasy? Jordan Peele’s Oscar-winning 2017 horror film Get Out, in which a white liberal family systematically transplants the brains of their aging family members into the bodies of Black people, satirizes the postracial fantasy of colorblindness. White wealth and flourishing (and eternal youth) are based on a horrifying techno-fix: the exploitation and extraction of Black life, the production of a living nightmare. Peele’s film raises unsettling questions about the American conception of race—questions with deep histories—which this class aims to explore: How has race been mobilized as a structure of white supremacist social control? What has racialization meant for those being racialized? Centralizing the work of Black and Indigenous thinkers, our goal will be to interrogate what race has meant in American culture over time. We will read a selection of excerpts and short texts from the 18th and 19th centuries to learn about the development of “race science” as a logic underpinning violently imposed social hierarchies. In tandem with this material, we will analyze Peele’s film and two contemporary novels with historical roots: Colson Whitehead’s The Nickel Boys (2019), the story of a young Black man in a “reform school” in 1960s Florida, and Tommy Orange’s Wandering Stars (2024), which traces the experience of two Indigenous boys at the Carlisle Indian School, an institution designed to destroy Native culture. In doing so, we will aim to investigate the question: What are our contemporary inheritances of these histories?\n\nEnglish 200Literary Histories: Songs and Sonnets (Historical Breadth Pre 1830)Phillips\n\nTTh\n\n3:30-4:50\n\nEnglish 200 Literary Histories: Songs and Sonnets (Historical Breadth Pre 1830)\n\nCourse Description: Beginning with the sonnet craze in the late sixteenth century and ending with twenty-first-century reinventions and deconstructions of the sonnet, this course will explore questions of literary history by taking up the relationship between poetry and popular culture, investigating the ways in which poets draw on the latest trends in popular and literary culture and in turn the ways in which that culture incorporates and transforms poetry—on the stage, in music, and on the screen. Thinking of literary history as a set of conversations in verse across the centuries, we will consider how poets borrow from and respond to one another, experimenting with traditional forms and familiar themes to make the old new. In order to recognize and interpret this experimentation, we will first study those traditional forms, learning to read and interpret poetry. While we will be reading a range of poems in modern editions, we will be situating them in their social, historical, literary and material contexts, analyzing the ways in which these contexts shape our interpretation. Readings may include poetry by Shakespeare, Agbagi, Donne, Hughes, Sidney, Keats, McKay, Rosetti, Yeats, and Eliot.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): class attendance and participation required; two papers, short assignments, and discussion board posts.\n\nTexts include: The Norton Anthology of Poetry, 6th edition, eds.

We will consider how classical thinkers like Aristotle and Epicurus, early Modern ones like Cavendish and Shakespeare, and modern ones ranging from Charles Dickens to productivity vloggers on Youtube use “energy” as a metaphor to name a variety of dynamics, including those of race, gender, class, empire, nature, and god. Reading literary texts alongside a social history of science, we’ll ask: how does the science of energy make its way through literature into our imaginations about work? Through what literary maneuvers and historical conditions have we come to imagine work and productivity as ultimately good? What political horizons emerge when we argue that writing about energy negotiates the complex acts of doing work, forcing work, shirking work, and refusing to work?\n\nTeaching Method: Discussion.\n\nEnglish 210-1British Literary Traditions, Part 1 (Historical Breadth Pre 1830)Thompson\n\nTTh\n\n11-12:20, plus discussion section\n\nEnglish 210-1 British Literary Traditions, Part 1 (Historical Breadth Pre 1830)\n\nCourse Description: This class surveys major texts in the development of English literature from the epic Beowulf (c. 750 – 950) to Olaudah Equiano’s Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African (1788). A central goal of the class is to develop tools for approaching literary texts as creative expressions as well as challenging reflections on society, power, knowledge, and difference. The millennium-long sweep of English 210 will help us approach literature not as escapist leisure but as social thought expressed in new representational modes. We will pay special attention to the role of transoceanic travel, exploitation, and mercantile capitalist trade in the development of English literary forms. At a time of unprecedented encounters with other peoples and places, how did English literary forms represent—and contest—these new realities?\n\nRequired Texts\n\nAphra Behn, Oroonoko: or, The Royal Slave.

This course surveys the most powerful genres of Hollywood cinema's \"classical\" era, the period of studio production from the 1910s to about 1960. Focusing on the sound era this course introduces students to the study of Hollywood cinema as a mode of industrial cultural production at the dynamic intersection of art and mass culture. Our approach will be to study one film per week with an emphasis on formal analysis supplemented by readings from film theory and history. Films will likely include The Wizard of Oz (1939), Sullivan's Travels (1941), Now, Voyager (1942), Double Indemnity (1944), Sunset Boulevard (1950), and Singin' in the Rain (1952), among others. Readings may include writings by Bordwell, Thompson, and Staiger, Altman, Cavell, L. Williams, and others. Assignments will include short papers, a video editing exercise (no expertise required), and a final project.\n\nTeaching Methods: Lecture & discussion.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Short writing assignments.\n\nEnglish 215Topics in Literature, Film and Media: Speculative Fictions of Race and EmpireGutierrez-Lowe\n\nTTh\n\n3:30-4:50\n\nEnglish 215 Topics in Literature, Film and Media: Speculative Fictions of Race and Empire\n\nCourse Description: TV shows like The Mandalorian, House of the Dragon, and The Boys have sought to portray great empires: the Galactic Empire, Targaryen House, and Vought International. All-powerful, authoritarian kingdoms and state and/or corporate powers abound in the many genres of speculative fiction—from fantasy to space western, from superhero to dystopian. This class is an exploration of how empires are conceived and constructed and what role race plays in their creation. Working with both contemporary popular media and the literary works of writers of color, we’ll ask: How are empires built? How do they construct (and deconstruct) the meanings of race and gender? And how do they, to follow Luthen Rael from the Star War’s series Andor, breed rebellion? Texts and media may include selections from Helena María Viramontes’ The Moths, Vanessa Angélica Villareal’s Magical/ Realism, Octavia E. Butler’s Parable of the Sower, Fernando A. Flores’ Tears of the Trufflepig, The Mandalorian, Andor, House of the Dragon, and The Boys.\n\nEnglish 220The Bible as LiteratureSchwartz\n\nTTh\n\n9:30-10:50\n\nEnglish 220 The Bible as Literature\n\nCourse Description: This course is meant to familiarize you with the most influential text in Western culture from a literary perspective. No previous acquaintance with the Bible is presupposed. We will consider such questions as the variety of literary genres in the Bible—primeval myth, epic, lyric poetry, prophecy, proto-novel; the representation of God as a literary character; and dominant images and themes. We will focus on those books that have had greatest literary interest or influence. From the Torah we will read Genesis, Exodus, and parts of Numbers, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy; from the Prophets, Amos, Hosea, Jonah, selections from Jeremiah and Second Isaiah; and from the Writings, the books of Judges, Ruth, Psalms and the Song of Solomon, along with the stories of Kings Saul and David and portions of the Wisdom literature. In the New Testament, we will read selections from the Gospels according to Matthew, Luke, and John and the book of Revelation. (We’re skipping Paul because he’s more a theologian than a literary writer.)\n\nReading Requirement: The Bible, (either the Oxford Annotated Bible (ISBN‎ 0190276088) or the Jerusalem Bible ‎(ISBN 0525573194) are preferred).\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nBernhard Anderson, Understanding the Old Testament\n\nRobert Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative\n\nRegina Schwartz, The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism\n\nBart Ehrman, The Bible: A Historical and Literary Introduction\n\nEnglish 234Introduction to ShakespearePhillips\n\nMW\n\n9:30-10:50, plus discussion section\n\nEnglish 234 Introduction to Shakespeare\n\nCourse Description: This course will introduce students to a range of Shakespeare’s comedies, tragedies, histories and romances. During the quarter, we will be considering these plays in their Early Modern context—cultural, political, literary and theatrical. We will focus centrally on matters of performance and of text. How is our interpretation of a play shaped by Shakespeare’s various “texts”— his stories and their histories, the works of his contemporaries, the latest literary fashions, and the various versions of his plays that circulated among his audience? Similarly, how do the details of a given performance, or the presence of a particular audience, alter the experience of the play? To answer these questions, we will consider not only the theaters of Early Modern England, but also recent cinematic versions of the plays, and we will read only our modern edition of Shakespeare but also examining some pages from the plays as they originally circulated. Our readings may include Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Merchant of Venice, Othello, Macbeth, and the Tempest.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Lectures with discussion; required weekly discussion section.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Section attendance and participation, discussion board posts, a midterm, a scene performance and short papers\n\nTexts will be available at: Norris Center Bookstore.

Students will engage topics in Black study—including questions of freedom, fugitivity, nationalism, and racial justice—as well as literary and cultural history to analyze and explain the development of Black letters in the U.S. Our course will move quickly through four periods in black literature and cultural production: enslavement, Emancipation, and Reconstruction, Jim Crow and segregation, Civil Rights and the Black Arts Movement, and multiculturalism and the 21st century. Throughout, will read a range of sources including poetry and prose, and long- and short-form works to understand the ideas and imaginaries that inhere in Black literature. We will also listen to Black music, including, the Blues, jazz, and Hip Hop and view television and films that have been important entries in the cultural history of Black life.\n\nReadings will include:\n\nHansberry, A Raisin in the Sun 978-0679755333\n\nShange, for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuff 978-0684843261\n\nWhitehead, The Nickel Boys 978-0345804341\n\nEnglish 270-1American Literary Traditions, Part 1 (Historical Breadth Pre 1830)Grossman\n\nTTh\n\n11-12:20\n\nEnglish 270-1 American Literary Traditions, Part 1 (Historical Breadth Pre 1830)\n\nCourse Description: This is part one of a two-quarter survey that explores writings produced in North America between the time Native peoples encountered Europeans for the first time and the turn of the twentieth century. (Students are welcome to take one or both parts of English 270.)\n\nIn the first quarter we’ll explore the history of North American literature from its indigenous beginnings—including the migration by Europeans to what they imagined as a “new world”—through the crisis of slavery in the mid-1850’s. We will be centrally engaged with a set of related questions: What is American literature? Who counts as an American? Who shall be allowed to tell their stories, and on whose behalf? We embark on this literary journey at a moment of questioning the relations between the present and our “literary traditions”: various organizations are debating how to commemorate the four hundredth anniversaries of the years 1619 (the year the first ship bearing enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia) and 1620 (the year of the Plymouth settlers’ landing in what is now Massachusetts); at the same time, people are calling for the removal of monuments to Christopher Columbus and to the Confederacy. We will be reading authors that canonical literary histories have usually included—Mary Rowlandson, Anne Bradstreet, Frederick Douglass, and Nathaniel Hawthorne—alongside Native American authors who told stories of European encounter and African American accounts that radically contest the meanings of some of the key terms of U.S. literature, history, and culture: discovery, citizenship, representation, nation, freedom.\n\nTeaching Method: Two lectures per week, plus a required discussion section.\n\nEvaluation Method: Evaluation will be based on two short (3-page) essays, in which students will perform a close reading of a literary passage from one of the texts on the syllabus; a final examination, involving short answers and essays; and active participation in section and lecture. Attendance at all sections is required.\n\nSome of the authors whose works we will read include: Mary Rowlandson, Anne Bradstreet, Christopher Columbus, Frederick Douglass, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Benjamin Franklin, Phillis Wheatley, Powhatan.\n\nEnglish 275Topics in Asian American Literature (Historical Breadth Post 1830)Huang\n\nMW\n\n11-12:20, plus discussion section\n\nEnglish 275 Topics in Asian American Literature (Historical Breadth Post 1830)\n\nCourse Description: Asian American, Asian-American, Asian/American: from Chinese Americans to Hmong Americans to mixed race Asian Americans, from fourth-generation Californians to cosmopolitan college students, from desert internment camps to New York City office buildings, what do the many subjects and locations of Asian American literature tell us about the capaciousness of the category itself? This class has two goals—first, providing an overview of literature written by Asian Americans in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries and placing these texts in conversation with key concepts from Asian American culture and history. Second, interrogating the constructed, pan-ethnic nature of Asian American identity, a category that came into use only in the 1960s as a coalitional entity defined by shared histories of labor, discrimination, and national and cultural unbelonging.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Lecture, discussion, discussion section, writing assignments\n\nEvaluation Methods: Attendance, class participation, writing assignments, quizzes, readings, papers\n\nTexts include:\n\nDavid Henry Hwang, M.

We discuss the Latino vote, the Hispanic population, and the Latinx community. This course explores the nuances of these labels through stories narrated by Latinx authors. As we follow characters through conflicts and inhabit their quotidian lives, we will navigate between the specificity of a story and the complexity of a Latinx identity. Class discussions will study emotional ties to language, feminist thought, Latinx Indigeneities, and queer storytelling. Our readings will alternate between short stories, poetry, non-fiction writing, and one novel. As we move between forms and genres, we will pay particular attention to what Latinx authors achieve by choosing to tell their story in a poem, a short story, an essay, or a novel, as well as what each of these forms asks of us as readers.\n\nA nine-week course cannot do justice to the rich genealogy of Latinx writing. This course follows an illustrative sample of Latinx authors from the 1980s to the present. It aims to provide students with a historical, political, and literary foundation for further exploration of Latinx literature.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Lecture and discussion-based course.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Midterm and final papers, personal essay, attendance and participation.\n\nTexts include: We the Animals by Justin Torres (9780547844190).

Tailored to the time constraints of the quarter, it introduces students to a series of episodes in the recent history of the study of literature and culture: the influential heroes of these episodes are engaged intellectuals who have together helped to inform how we read today. Pairing a handful of shorter primary texts with field-defining theorists and readers of the past and present, students will not only build fluency in the vocabulary of “literary theory,” they will emerge as more worldly, technically savvy, and theoretically sophisticated readers themselves. In this course, we are not interested in theory for its own sake, but in the ways the thing we call “theory” — like literature — is not only shaped by, but helps to shape the world around us.\n\nTeaching Method: Brief lectures and engaged discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method: Attendance & participation; short writing assignments; one presentation; and a final project.\n\nAuthors may include: Germaine de Staël, William Hazlitt, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Zora Neale Hurston, Octavio Paz, Franz Fanon, Simone de Beauvoir, Jacques Derrida, Paolo Freire, Stuart Hall, Gayatri Spivak, Edward Said, Rey Chow, Barbara Johnson, and Lauren Berlant.\n\nAll texts for the course will be available on Canvas.\n\nEnglish 288Topics in Literature and EthicsSchwartz\n\nTTh\n\n9:30-10:50\n\nEnglish 288 Topics in Literature and Ethics\n\nCourse Description: What is the right thing to do? This course will examine ideas of justice in western cultural and literary traditions. Biblical ideas of justice, utilitarianism, rights theory, and more justice theories will be explored. We will read literature alongside these theories, following how such ideas of justice shape the public and intimate lives of people. We will ask how religious ideas of justice inform and depart from secular ideas of justice, how retributive and distributive ideas of justice are imagined and critiqued, and how the relation between justice and law has been conceived.

In the early nineteenth century, murder and other forms of gothic violence were often confined to remote castles or the wilds of the English moors. With the explosion of detective stories and crime fiction, however, these middle-class nightmares invaded both the supposedly blissful domestic scene and the modern city. Writers started to use murder as an occasion to pose radical questions about which deaths are considered “grievable.” Increasingly, authors depicted amateur detectives who were skeptical of the social and legal order they were reestablishing through their work. Beginning with founders of the genre Edgar Allen Poe and Pauline Hopkins (author of the first Black murder mystery), this course follows the transatlantic tradition forward through Raymond Chandler’s hard-boiled tales, mid-century psychological thrillers by Patricia Highsmith, and recent detective fiction by Walter Mosley. Paying particular attention to how gender and race shape the narration of these tales, we will conclude with a survey of twenty-first-century chart-toppers by Paula Hawkins and others. Readings will be supplemented with films, including excellent adaptations of The Girl on the Train and The Talented Mr. Ripley. Please note that this class is not open to students who took an earlier version of this course.\n\nEnglish 300Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Time-travelling Heroes of the Multiverse!: History and Cultural Difference in Modern FictionGodfrey\n\nMW\n\n12:30-1:50\n\nEnglish 300 Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Time-travelling Heroes of the Multiverse!: History and Cultural Difference in Modern Fiction\n\nCourse Description: Since H.G. Wells’s unnamed time-traveler first rocketed forward to the distant future, time travel has been a favorite thought exercise for writers, day-dreamers, and artists. What does it mean to fantasize about the future and to reimagine the past? How does time travel undercut or complicate commonplace linear narratives, progress narratives, or coming of age stories? In this course, we’ll investigate the genre as a way into thinking about the fundamentals of literary analysis and methodology. We’ll combine readings of literary classics like H.G. Wells’s The Time Machine (1895) and Marghanita Laski’s forgotten The Victorian Chaise-Longue (1953) with selections by modern sci-fi writers like M. John Harrison and N. K. Jemisin. We’ll also consider mixed-media additions to the canon, including the anime The Girl who Leapt Through Time (2006) and the movies Interstellar (2014) and Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022). Together, we will confront questions about cultural difference and blur the boundaries between “past,” “present,” and “future.”\n\nTeaching Methods: Short lectures, seminar discussion, collaborative group exercises.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Participation, discussion posts, short analytical paper, final project.\n\nTexts Include: H.G. Wells, The Time Machine; Marghanita Laski, The Victorian Chaise-Longue; Virginia Woolf, Orlando (ISBN 0156031515); N.K. Jemisin, “Too Many Yesterdays, Not Enough Tomorrows”; the Daniels, Everything Everywhere All at Once.\n\nEnglish 300Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Austen and Other GenresThompson\n\nTTh\n\n9:30-10:50\n\nEnglish 300 Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Austen and Other Genres\n\nCourse Description: As a critical methods seminar for English majors and minors, English 300 will enhance your interpretive, analytic, and argumentative skills. To that end, this class explores new ways to read Jane Austen in both her historical context and our contemporary moment. Whether you’re a stranger to Austen or a devoted Janeite, this class will give you surprising insights into her connections to the social, domestic, and aesthetic movements of her time. We will pair three Austen texts with three earlier novels: Pride and Prejudice and Mary Hays’s radical feminist novel The Victim of Prejudice (1799); Emma and Daniel Defoe’s criminal autobiography Moll Flanders (1722); Northanger Abbey and the mass-popular Gothic novel A Sicilian Romance (1790) by Ann Radcliffe. We’ll accompany each pairing with critical texts in contemporary feminism and queer studies; narratology; and genre studies (on the Gothic). The class will conclude by looking at some contemporary TV or film renderings of Austen (e.g., Bridgerton, Clueless, or Pride and Prejudice).\n\nAttendance at first class meeting is mandatory.\n\nRequired texts:\n\nJane Austen, Emma.

In our seminar we'll explore poetry as an art of words, voice, song, speech, story; of describing, expressing, transforming, translating, and revealing worlds visible and invisible; of hiddenness and discovery, paradox and mystery, epiphany and surprise, the everyday, the extraordinary, and the otherworldly. Reading selected poems and related prose texts on poetics by Baudelaire, Whitman, Dickinson, Yeats, Eliot, Pound, H. D., Williams, Bishop, Hughes, Brooks, and other poets both earlier and later, we'll see how particular poems emerge in creative dialogue with other poems across historical moments, locales, languages, cultural surrounds, and sensibilities. We'll practice close reading, analytic, and comparative skills to discuss, appreciate, and write about the formal and linguistic virtuosity by which poets create poems-as-worlds that enrich the resources of English poetry: verse lines and forms, sound patterns (meter, rhythm, music, tone), diction, rhetorical tropes, figurative language, personae, voices. We’ll visit our Special Collections Library to learn about print culture and to see first editions of some of the works we'll be studying. We’ll conclude with a Poetry Fest for which everyone will choose and read, recite, or perform a poem for the class.\n\nEnglish 312Studies in Drama: Men Dancing (Historical Breadth Post 1830/Race & Ethnicity/Gender, Sexuality & Embodiment)Manning\n\nW\n\n9:30-11:50\n\nEnglish 312 Studies in Drama: Men Dancing (Historical Breadth Post 1830/Race & Ethnicity/Gender, Sexuality & Embodiment)\n\nCourse Description: This course examines men dancing in diverse genres onstage and onscreen—blackface and Black minstrelsy, ballet and tap, modern and postmodern dance.
