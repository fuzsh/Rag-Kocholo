        "text": "The Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, as we read it, is already the literary place of a cultural encounter over centuries between an old Germanic heroic story and the Christian culture of the writer, a novel of our days which re-uses the story is the continuation of a tradition already inscribed in the old poem. But in the poem another main cultural encounter takes place. If a culture can, or can try to define himself and narrate its own survival through its hero, a hero needs an antagonist to define itself: Beowulf’s antagonist is the well-known monster called Grendel. The article focuses on the encounter with the otherness represented by Grendel in the 'original' Beowulf and on how it changes in its rewriting in eater of the Dead by Michael Crichton (1997): from the threat morally and ethically posed of the medieval poem to the contemporary anthropological threat revealing our fear of stages of evolution. Crichton’s novel combines Beowulf’s story with Ibn Fadlan’s account of his journey among the Bulghars, which gives the novel a geographical and multi-cultural approach that was absent in the Anglo-Saxon poem. An epic poem is always a literary space where cultural encounters take place, but these encounters have to change their features to be felt as relevant in another time and in another culture."
