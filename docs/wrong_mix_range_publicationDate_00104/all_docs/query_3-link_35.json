        "text": "5000-Level\n\nEnglish 5191: Internship in English Studies - Promotional Media Internship\n\nInstructor: Scott DeWitt\n\nThis internship opportunity will offer students experience in creating timely, relevant and compelling short-form promotional media (primarily video and audio) for the Department of English. Students will work closely with their supervisor (Professor DeWitt) as well as with key communications personnel to develop projects and set priorities and deadlines. English 5191, Promotional Media Internship, will be intensely hands-on and focus almost exclusively on digital media production and related work-management skills in professional settings. This internship opportunity is especially applicable to students across majors who would like to develop their digital media skills in a workplace setting and for those who have digital media skills with nowhere to apply them. Media skills are NOT a pre-requisite for this internship; students will have the opportunity to learn all media skills necessary for the class. (This internship fulfills the digital media requirement for the Writing, Rhetoric and Literacy concentration in the English Major.)\n\nPotential Assignments: YouTube videos, podcasts.\n\nGuiding Questions: What are some guiding questions that this course will explore?\n\nHow can a promotional media internship opportunity help students across majors develop their digital media skills in a workplace setting?\n\nAdditional Materials: Experience with technology is helpful, but you will learn all of the skills you need in class.\n\nEnglish 5664: Studies in Graphic Narrative - Graphic Memoir\n\nInstructor: Jared Gardner\n\nThis seminar will explore the unique ways in which the comics form engages with representing and reimagining time and its relation to space, focusing especially on graphic narrative that seeks to represent temporalities that step outside of the synchronized clocktimes of global modernity. The second half of the seminar will focus on attempts to apply the possibilities of visualizing spacetime in graphic narrative to consider projects focused on reimagining our relationship with the environment and the futures of climate change.\n\nPotential Texts: Works we will read will include experiments with serial time in early newspaper comic strips, representations of the multiverse in superhero comics, and graphic novels such as Kevin Huizenga’s The River at Night, Gilbert Hernandez’s Julio’s Day, Richard McGuire’s Here, Maggie Umber’s Sound of Snow Falling, stories by Peter Kuper, Rachel Hope Allison, James Romberger and non-fiction graphic narrative such as Philippe Squarzoni’s Climate Changed: A Personal Journey Through the Science and Lauren Redniss’s Thunder and Lightning: Weather Past, Present, Future and Joe Sacco’s Paying the Land.\n\nPotential Assignments: Students write weekly reading responses and do two kinds of oral presentations, one a commentary on a critical reading and one a close reading of a single page of graphic memoir. Each student creates a one-page graphic memoir. For the final project, students may choose to write a research paper or to create a more extended graphic memoir.\n\nGuiding Questions: How do comics make meaning through graphic design? What can graphic narrative do for autobiography that prose narrative can't do? How (and why) do comics artists use their medium to represent personal, national and familial traumas?\n\nEnglish 5723.01: Tree, Forest, Pasture, Garden, Animal: The Literature and Politics of the Natural World in Seventeenth-Century England\n\nInstructor: Luke Wilson\n\nAt the heart of this course is the importance of the tree in the British literary and political imagination. One tree – the so-called Royal Oak – is central to some of the mythologies that shaped the English experience of the Civil War period. Pursued by the Parliamentary forces Charles II hid in it before fleeing to the continent; and the regicide of 1649 was represented as its felling at the hands of, or at least at the direction of, Oliver Cromwell. But trees were of far broader significance to English national identity. The seventeenth century gave rise to the phenomenon of what Keith Thomas has called “trees as pets” – singular, fetishized trees loaded with personal, familial, or historical significance. At the same time, trees collectively – forests, and the timber they produced – were esteemed as the symbolic and literal source of English power abroad and prosperity at home, but one that was increasingly recognized as under threat of exhaustion as the consequences of centuries of deforestation.\n\nIn this course we’ll try, then, to see the forest for the trees, and the trees for the forest. But we’ll also read about other natural and artificial configurations of the landscape, including gardens, pastures, and fields, and about the animals that inhabited them. Some of the most important literary works of the century are shaped around these figurations of the natural world: Shakespeare’s As You Like It; Jonson’s The Forest, Marvell’s garden and country house poems; the spiritually-inflected landscapes of Herbert and Vaughan; Milton’s Paradise Lost and Masque at Ludlow Castle; Margaret Cavendish’s animal poems; country house poems by various writers; and many more, including works by Amelia Lanyer, Robert Herrick, Thomas Carew, Edmund Waller, and Richard Lovelace. The Civil War period saw land-use disputes that called into question the traditional order of the landed gentry and its rights and obligations; we’ll read material related to the Digger and Leveller movements, which called for the conversion to public use of privately held farm and pastureland. The course will (probably) begin with As You Like (c. 1599) and end with excerpts from Paradise Lost (1667).\n\nPotential Texts: An anthology of seventeenth-century poetry; an edition of Shakespeare; most other material on canvas.\n\nPotential Assignments: Short paper; final research paper; class presentation.\n\nGuiding Questions: Why were the English so obsessed with trees? How was the natural world understood by the English in the seventeenth century? How did the political and social upheavals of the seventeenth century affect representations of the natural world?\n\n6000-Level\n\nEnglish 6715: Introduction to Graduate Study in the Middle Ages\n\nInstructor: Ethan Knapp\n\nThis course will provide an introduction to the rich and diverse traditions of literature in later Medieval England. I will be aiming to make these texts accessible both to students who plan to specialize in medieval literature as well those working in later periods – it would be an excellent choice both to satisfy the pre-1800 requirement as well as providing some historical background for anyone who may be called upon to teach a survey course in the future. I would welcome anyone who wants to audit the course or take it pass/fail.\n\nIn this course, we will focus on both cultural backgrounds of late medieval literature as well as current theoretical issues in both medieval and broader literary studies. The selections for readings will range from canonical figures such as Chaucer, Langland and Gower to less frequently studied figures, such as Thomas Hoccleve, Margery Kempe, and Christine de Pisan. These readings will be chosen to give us the chance to consider a set of major cultural and theoretical questions: the shape of gender and sexuality in the pre-modern period; the political upheavals that shaped this society in the wake of the pandemic that shook many of its cultural norms (the Black Death); the relationship between narrative form and philosophical content; and the rise of autobiographical writing in the late-medieval period.\n\nPotential Assignments: For requirements, students may choose to write either three short papers or one longer project.\n\nEnglish 6716.01/.02: Introduction to Graduate Study in the Middle Ages\n\nInstructor: Ethan Knapp\n\nThis course will provide an introduction to the rich and diverse traditions of literature in later Medieval England.

In the last few years, cultural historians of the long eighteenth century have returned with new rigor to a rather old domain of interest, one grounded in Horace’s dictum ut pictura poesis (“as is painting, so is poetry”), an epigrammatic restatement of Simonides’ poesia tacens, pictura loquens (“painting is mute poetry, poetry a talking picture”). The story of the relationship between literature and the other arts (painting, sculpture, architecture, and sometimes music) has gone something like this: in the Renaissance, the “speaking picture” of a text complements the “silent poetry” of an image (as, for example, in Renaissance allegory or emblematics); but by the late seventeenth century one encounters a gradual emancipation of image from text (as in still-life painting). This is an uneven development, however, given the popularity of, say, William Hogarth’s graphic narratives, the pictorialism of much eighteenth-century poetry, and the ekphrastic descriptiveness of the early realist novel. But in 1766, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s Laokoon: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry ushers in the beginning of the end of ut pictura by insisting upon an irreducible difference between verbal and plastic arts. And by the close of the eighteenth-century, an anti-poetic realism takes hold in the novel, while poetry and painting shift toward the non-mimetic logic of the Sublime. We will use this story—and its refinement and revision in contemporary criticism—to frame our survey of the various media, modes, forms, and genres that comprise the cultural history of the Enlightenment. Because this story is also a story about the development of aesthetics as a new branch of philosophy, the course will not only fulfill a pre-1800 distribution requirement but also appeal to students with interests in the history of criticism or poetics, the history and theory of the novel, theories of form and genre more generally, and those whose objects are not primarily literary texts (for example, graphic narrative, popular culture, or film). I welcome auditors and those taking the course pass/fail.\n\nPotential Texts: Poems by Milton, Marvell, Dryden, Finch, Pope, Young, Blake; novels by Defoe and Burney; aesthetic treatises by Hogarth, Diderot, Lessing and Burke; secondary criticism on connections between verbal and visual art, and on questions of form, matter and signification.\n\nPotential Assignments: Weekly response papers, an oral presentation, a creative or critical Ekphrasis and a final paper.\n\nEnglish 6756 .01/.02: Introduction to Graduate Study in American Literature, 1840-1914\n\nInstructor: Susan Williams\n\nThis course will provide an introduction to advanced study of and current critical conversations about American literature from 1840-1914. Rather than undertaking a comprehensive survey of the period, we will study selected texts with a focus on the overlapping ways in which they are shaped by and participate in cultural and legal understandings of race, gender, region and nation. We will pay particular attention to the ways in which the rise of photography contributed to the construction of authorship in this period. Our study of primary texts and criticism will be accompanied by project-based explorations of research resources in American literature available at Ohio State, including the Charvat Collection of American Literature, the Rinhart Collection of early photographs, the Sarah Piatt Recovery Project and the archives of the Centenary Edition of the Works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, which was housed in the English department for 40 years.\n\nPotential Texts: Louisa May Alcott, Little Women; Charles Chesnutt, The Marrow of Tradition; Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter; Walt Whitman, Song of Myself; Shorter works by Dion Boucicault, Rebecca Harding Davis, Emily Dickinson, Frederick Douglass, Sophia Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe, among others.\n\nPotential Assignments: In-class presentations and projects; 2-3 short research reports on library resources and/or scholarly articles; final paper.\n\nEnglish 6763.01: Graduate Workshop in Poetry\n\nInstructor: Marcus Jackson\n\nA graduate-level workshop in the writing of poetry.\n\nEnglish 6765.01: Graduate Workshop in Fiction\n\nInstructor: Lee Martin\n\nThis is a writing workshop that will invite the study and practice of literary fiction. We'll consider professional models in addition to the creation, discussion, and revision of our original work.\n\nEnglish 6765.02: Graduate Workshop in Fiction\n\nInstructor: Austen Osworth\n\nGraduate Workshop in Fiction (Fiction B)\n\nPoets! Memoirists! This workshop is for you. It is a truth universally acknowledged that fiction is the art of lying, crafted by the lying liars who tell them. \"Art is the lie that tells a truth,\" Picaso said, or maybe he didn't. Point is, it feels like something a Picaso would say, and the sentiment strikes at the heart of what we fiction writers must puzzle through: by learning how to lie (and lie with gusto) we somehow discover our own authentic voices. Curious? Come join me.\n\nPotential Texts: An online anthology of various stories and craft essays.\n\nPotential Assignments: We will spend the first half of the semester writing flash, and then we will move on to longer stories.\n\nEnglish 6767.01/.02: Introduction to Graduate Study in 20th Century Literature, 1945-Present - Literature, Environment, and Politics\n\nInstructor: Thomas S. Davis\n\nThis course introduces graduate students to the ways post-45 literary and cultural studies has been reshaped by its interactions with ecocriticism, the Environmental Humanities and the Energy Humanities. Among other questions, we will explore the ways cultural production has disclosed and sometimes participated in the onset of what is now called the Anthropocene, a geologic epoch in which human forces have altered trajectory of the Earth System. How do worsening ecological conditions reconfigure the way we approach questions of vulnerability, time and justice? How do we understand the historical relations between settler colonialism, racial capitalism and environmental transformation? What ideas of nature, culture and the human enabled those historical relations to take shape? Can artworks unmake those ideas and perhaps initiate others? What role have artworks played in environmental and climate justice movements? And, finally, we will take stock of the various methods and approaches scholars use to answer these questions.\n\nPotential Texts: Possible authors/artists: Gwendolyn Brooks, Rachel Carson, Octavia Butler, Craig Santos Perez, Layli Long Soldier, Cannupa Hanska Luger, Jesmyn Ward, Juliana Spahr, Ada Limón, Ross Gay, Ben Okri, N.K. Jemisin, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Camille Dungy and others. Critical and theoretical works from Cedric Robinson, François Vergés, Andreas Malm, Jennifer Wenzel, Max Liboiron, Jessica Hurley, Karl Marx, Robin Wall Kimmerer, Zoë Todd, Amitav Ghosh, Rebecca Solnit, Rob Nixon, Robert Bullard and others. We may also explore a video game like Norco.\n\nPotential Assignments: Two conference papers, class presentation and active participation.\n\nEnglish 6768.01: Graduate Workshop A in Creative Nonfiction\n\nInstructor: Lee Martin\n\nGraduate Workshop in Creative Nonfiction: This is a writing workshop that will invite the study and practice of literary nonfiction. We'll consider professional models in addition to the creation, discussion, and revision of our original work.\n\nEnglish 6769: Special Topics in Creative Writing - Professionalization\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Angus Fletcher\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Elissa Washuta\n\nThe goal for this class is to prepare you as much as humanly possible for what lies ahead, careerwise, writing life wise, publishing wise and otherwise. We'll cover everything from artist statements, grant applications, research on and querying literary agents, writing book proposals and giving readings of your work to academic cover letters and CVs, job talks, interviews and non-academic careers [not an all-inclusive list by any means]. This class is open to creative writing MFA students in their 2nd and 3rd years of the program.\n\nEnglish 6779.01/.11: Introduction to Graduate Study in Rhetoric - Classical to Early Renaissance\n\nInstructor: James Fredal\n\nEnglish 6779 is a foundational class in the history and theory of rhetoric. We will read and discuss primary historical texts (treatises and speeches) and issues concerning rhetorical practice, theory and culture from ancient Greece to the Renaissance. We will also examine historical connections between rhetoric and other cultural practices and forms of knowledge, including (for example) politics, law, literacy, education, literature, performance, philosophy, gender, colonialism, religion and others.\n\nPotential Texts: Primary authors will include Lysias, Gorgias, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, Augustine, Petrarch, Ramus and others. Current secondary sources will complement and complicate primary texts.\n\nPotential Assignments: A set of shorter papers (weekly or every other week) based on readings and discussion. Some form of longer paper: annotated bibliography, review essay, research paper, or application essay, etc. Student presentations (one each week).\n\nGuiding Question: Why is ancient rhetoric so darn fascinating and influential?\n\nCourse Poster/Image\n\nEnglish 6788.01/.02: Studies in Theory and Practice of Imaginative Writing\n\nInstructor: Kathy Fagan Grandinetti\n\nYou're a grad student writer NOT in the Creative Writing MFA Program and you want to study and make poems with like-minded grad students from across the university. Register for this spring 2023 course. We'll approach poems, our own and others, in both experimental and traditional ways, with the goal of incorporating the work we make into our fields of expertise. MFA students in the non-literary arts like dance, art, and music; PhD students in English, languages, philosophy: all are welcome. Let's practice making poems together!\n\nPotential Texts: Texts will be provided online and in-class.\n\nPotential Assignments: All work is creative; poetry prompts will be assigned.\n\nGuiding Questions: What's a poem? How do I read one? How do I write one? What does it mean to the other work I do?\n\nAdditional Materials: Computer access and an email address are essential.\n\n7000-Level\n\nEnglish 7350.01: Theorizing Folklore I – Tradition and Transmission\n\nInstructor: Dorothy Noyes\n\nThe transmission of cultural forms through time and space across social networks, with special attention to the dynamics of conservation, and innovation, reflexivity, and habit.\n\nEnglish 7820.01/.02:Seminar in Shakespeare\n\nInstructor: Luke Wilson\n\nAn intensive consideration of selected problems in the scholarly study of Shakespeare.\n\nEnglish 7844.01/.02: Seminar in Victorian Literature\n\nInstructor: Clare Simmons\n\nVictorians tended to place cultural value on being objective—yet Victorian Britain also produced memorable examples of novels, autobiographies, poems, memoirs and essays written from a first-person perspective. In this course we will read some significant examples of Victorian writing that make extensive or exclusive use of the “I” voice and consider how matters of class, gender, sexuality and cultural identity relate to an understanding of oneself and the representation of others. The course should be of interest to anyone working in 19th-century literature, narrative, or life-writing.\n\nPotential Texts: Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre; Charles Dickens, David Copperfield; George Du Maurier, Trilby; poetry by Arnold, Tennyson, the Brownings; the Rossettis, Amy Levy and others; John Stuart Mill’s Autobiography; travel writings to the Americas, Africa, and Asia by Mary Seacole, Mary Kingsley, Anna Leonowens and others.\n\nPotential Assignments: Requirements for grade: reading in advance and participation in class and online discussion; a presentation; two essays.\n\nEnglish 7861.01/.02: Studies in Narrative and Narrative Theory - A Rhetorical Approach to (Non)Fictionality: Problems and Possibilities.\n\nInstructor: Jim Phelan\n\nThis course will investigate the still-developing rhetorical approach to fictionality (discourse that departs from direct reference to actual states of affairs) and nonfictionality (discourse that directly refers to actual states). The key principles of the approach are (1) fictionality and nonfictionality are not binary opposites but rather different means for accomplishing similar ends (changing the world, or at least small piece of it); (2) global nonfictions frequently integrate local uses of fictionality into their construction and global fictions frequently integrate local uses of nonfictionality. The course will explore this cross-border traffic in a range of narratives, paying special attention to its affective, ethical, and aesthetic consequences.\n\nPotential Texts: T.C. Boyle's, Chicxulub; Jesmyn Ward's, On Witness and Respair; J.M. Coetzee's Scenes from Provincial Life; Ian McEwan's Saturday; Roz Chast's Can't We Talk about Something More Pleasant?; Colson Whitehead's Underground Railroad; the docudramas Apollo 13 (dir. Ron Howard) and The Trial of the Chicago 7 (dir. Aaron Sorkin).\n\nPotential Assignments: agenda setting, weekly writing exercises, close reading paper, final paper tailored to the student's interest.\n\nEnglish 7864.01/.02: Postcolonial/Transnational Literatures\n\nInstructor: Adélékè Adéẹ̀kọ́\n\nTopics include postcolonial and transnational literature in English; theories of colonial, postcolonial, and transnational literature and culture.\n\nEnglish 7872.01/.02: Seminar in English Linguistics\n\nInstructor: Galey Modan\n\nThis interdisciplinary course examines how social actors coordinate language with spatial relations in the physical world, use language to construct identities for various kinds of places -- particularly cities -- and relate their own identities as community insiders or outsiders to those constructions. Reading materials are drawn from the fields of sociolinguistics, linguistic and urban anthropology, and cultural geography, with an emphasis on ethnographic work. Students will conduct their own mini-ethnographies of a place of their choice within the Columbus area. Although no knowledge of discourse analysis or linguistics is assumed, readings and discussions include (but are not limited to) close analysis of the linguistic features and strategies that speakers or writers use in their constructions of place.\n\nEnglish 7879.01/.02: Seminar in Rhetoric\n\nInstructor: Wendy Hesford\n\nThis seminar builds on the idea that knowledge-making is a dialogic process, that the act of writing is social and iterative, and that scholarship constitutes a dialogic engagement with a community of researchers. In its critical approach to scholarship as conversation, this seminar considers whose voices and which communities have been privileged or excluded from certain scholarly conversations. Students will read the works of OSU faculty and alumni and visiting scholars working at the intersection of rhetoric and African American Studies, Asian American Studies, critical race theory, digital media, disability studies, environmental studies, transnational feminist studies, medical humanities, museum studies, and/or science and technology. Through in-person and virtual dialogues, students will have the opportunity to engage OSU alumni about scholarly and career trajectories, research methodologies, and writing processes, among other topics.\n\nPotential Texts: Selected Works by OSU alumni in WRL: Louis M. Maraj, Black or Right: Anti/Racist Campus Rhetorics Pritha Prasad (with Louis M. Maraj) The Benevolent Gaslight: A Technology of Whiteness Haivan Hoang, Writing Against Racial Injury: The Politics of Asian American Student Rhetoric Lauren E Obermark, Engaging Museums: Rhetorical Education and Social Justice Rebecca Dingo, Networking Arguments: Rhetoric, Transnational Feminism, and Public Policy Writing, (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2012). M. Remi Yergeau, Authoring Autism: On Rhetoric and Neurological Queerness Tim Jensen, Ecologies of Guilt in Environmental Rhetoric Among others TBD\n\nPotential Assignments: This course will help students develop skills for academic writing and publishing through consideration of the scholarly conversations that students hope to enact through their research. Course requirements include weekly reading responses, activities such as mapping scholarly conversations and tracing citations, developing a research statement, and writing the first ten pages (minimum) of an article for publication, for a dissertation chapter, or for a writing sample and/or advising portfolio essay, which will be workshopped by the class.\n\nEnglish 7889.01/.02: Seminar on Digital Media Studies – Language in Digital Media\n\nInstructor: Lauren Squires\n\nThis course will take digital media as a site of social and linguistic practice, exploring English as it is used in social media, text messaging, and other sites of digital discourse. We will see how the theories and methods from sociolinguistics and allied fields (which have traditionally focused on spoken language) can be applied to better understand the social experiences, meanings, and effects of digital media contexts. A key focus will be exposure to and discussion of a range of sociolinguistic research methods, including linguistic variation analysis, linguistic ethnography, corpus linguistics, conversation analysis, semiotics, and (critical) discourse analysis. Our discussion will also be tailored to the interests of course participants, for instance by discussing how these theories/methods provide perspectives and starting points for analysis that may differ from those of other approaches within English studies, or how these approaches may complement thinking about digital media from a production or composition perspective.\n\nEnglish 7891.01/02: Seminar in Disability Theory - Disability and the Early/Modern\n\nInstructor: Amrita Dhar\n\nIn this seminar, we shall study disability in the context of a global early modernity, with specific attention to the crossings between race, empire and disability. We shall also study this early modernity’s dialogic relationship to the present, particularly through explorations of some generative afterlives of canonical texts. Here are some of the questions we shall consider: how was disability perceived, represented and negotiated in premodern societies? How was disability theorized in premodern societies—and particularly, for purposes of this class focused on literatures in English, how was disability theorized by premodern English authors on stage and page at the moment of inception of the British empire? What was—is—the relationship between disability and racial formation? And how do these theorizations, representations and negotiations continue to inform current understandings of disability and its intersections with gender, race, sexuality and nationality/citizenship?\n\nPotential Assignments: Class presentations, two short essays and a final project.\n\n5000-Level\n\nEnglish 5612: The History of the Book in Modernity\n\nInstructor: David Brewer\n\nThis course will explore books from the past two centuries as physical objects and consider what difference that makes for our understanding of the texts and images they bear and the uses to which they've been put. We will range widely in terms of genre, language and price point, and be completely embedded in the holdings of Ohio State's Rare Books and Manuscripts Library (indeed, we may never set foot in our assigned classroom in Denney). By the end of the course, you'll understand not only why judging books by their covers is impossible to avoid, but also why it's actually a good thing and how it can help us make sense of the many ways in which books work in and on the world.\n\nGuiding Questions: We've all been told not to judge a book by its cover. Yet we do it every day, and the world of books depends on our doing it. Let's learn to do it in better, more interesting and more far-reaching ways.\n\nPotential Text(s): We will be considering a wide range of books, pamphlets, periodicals and zines from Ohio State's Rare Books and Manuscripts Library, not all of which we'll be able to read in the conventional sense. But we'll quickly see how much we can grasp about the function and use of books whether or not we know the languages in which they're written.\n\nPotential Assignments: Course requirements will include active participation in our discussions, a weekly object journal, a few short written exercises, researching and deciding with your colleagues on a few new items to acquire for the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library [to be purchased by you with at least $5,000 of OSU funds], and a collectively curated exhibition of materials from the RBML collection that will be open to the public.\n\nEnglish 5710.01/.02: Introduction to Old English Language and Literature\n\nInstructor: Christopher Jones\n\nThis course teaches students to read and declaim Old English, which was the spoken language of the English people in the early Middle Ages (up to ca. 1150), and the original language of evocative poems including Beowulf and The Wanderer. In the first half of the semester, we will learn declensions, conjugations, and vocabulary; in the second half, we will translate works of Old English prose and poetry. No prior knowledge of Old English or other languages is required.\n\nPotential Texts: Mitchell and Robinson's A Guide to Old English\n\nPotential Assignments: Students are graded on their preparation for each class meeting, eight quizzes, three written translation assignments and a final exam.\n\nEnglish 5721.01/.02: Graduate Studies in Renaissance Drama: The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher: Genre, Kingship, Sexuality and Colonialism\n\nInstructor: Alan B. Farmer\n\nFrancis Beaumont and John Fletcher were two of the most popular and innovative playwrights in Renaissance England. Their plays were regularly performed at court, were best-sellers in print, and were eventually monumentalized in a 1647 folio collection. The plays they wrote—by themselves, collaboratively with each other and collaboratively with other playwrights—radically changed the genres and forms of English drama. Beaumont’s wildly allusive The Knight of the Burning Pestle challenged audiences to follow its ironical, metatheatrical plots, while their tragicomedies The Faithful Shepherdess, Philaster and A King and No King astonished—and confused—audiences with their complex plots and surprise endings. Their plays often explored gender and power, as in The Woman's Prize, which centers on the revolt of a wife against her shrew-taming husband, and in The Maid's Tragedy, which ends with the King’s mistress taking revenge on her former lover, while several of the later plays of Fletcher, most notably The Island Princess and The Sea Voyage, present searing representations of European colonialism. In this course, we will read several well-known and lesser-known plays by Beaumont and Fletcher as we consider how these plays engage with such important early modern topics as courts and kings, gender and sexuality, London and colonialism, revenge and tragedy.\n\nPotential Assignments: Several short research assignments, a presentation and a final essay.\n\n6000-Level\n\nEnglish 6410: Introduction to Medical Humanities and Social Sciences\n\nInstructor: Jim Phelan\n\nThis course functions both as the core requirement for the Interdisciplinary M.A. in Medical Humanities and Social Sciences and as an elective for other students with an interest in its subject matters. The course addresses the question of how our understanding of medicine alters when we shift from conceiving it primarily as a science to conceiving it as a cultural practice, something that inevitably has political, ethical, ideological and even aesthetic dimensions. We will divide our inquiry into the following units: medical inquiry; history of medicine; sociology of medicine; cultural critiques of medicine; disability studies and narrative medicine. A recurring issue will be the relationship between the practices of Western medicine and social justice. By the end of the course, students should have a deeper understanding of the methods and some key findings of the medical humanities and social sciences, and in that way, be well-equipped for further study in the field.\n\nGuiding Questions: What are the strengths and limitations of current Western medicine as revealed through the lenses of the humanities and social sciences? How might the perspectives of the humanities and social sciences provide avenues for improving the status quo in medicine? How does disability studies productively complicate ideas of medical and health norms? How can narrative medicine contribute to the art of medicine?\n\nPotential Text(s): Sidharth Mukherjee, The Laws of Medicine; Paul Starr, The Social Transformation of American Medicine; How to Survive a Plague (documentary by David French); Anne Fadiman, The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down; Damon Tweedy, Black Man in a White Coat; Harriet Washington, Medical Apartheid; Christina Crosby, A Body Undone; Rita Charon, et al. The Principles and Practice of Narrative Medicine; Arthur Frank, The Wounded Storyteller: Body, Illness, and Ethics; Miriam Engelberg, Cancer Made Me a Shallower Person.\n\nPotential Assignments: Weekly writing exercises; short analytical essay; three steps for a course paper of student's own interest: abstract, presentation, final paper.\n\nEnglish 6662: Literary Publishing\n\nInstructor: Elissa Washuta\n\nThis course is designed for writers in the MFA Program in Creative Writing and explores the world of publishing—its past, present and future. From placing work in literary journals to querying agents, we will study this ever-changing landscape and prepare writers for what they may encounter on their journey to publication.\n\nPotential Text(s): Making a Literary Life: Advice for Writers and Other Dreamers by Carolyn See; Before and After the Book Deal: A Writer's Guide to Finishing, Publishing, Promoting, and Surviving Your First Book by Courtney Maum; Literary Publishing in the Twenty-First Century edited by Travis Kurowski, Wayne Miller and Kevin Prufer.\n\nPotential Assignments: Reading for The Journal; presentations on literary journals and small presses; book reviews; author interviews; editorial projects; copyediting exam.\n\nEnglish 6700: Introduction to Graduate Studies in English\n\nInstructor: Amanpal Garcha\n\nTo introduce you to graduate study in English, this course will help you understand some answers to a number of large questions: What are some of the main theoretical assumptions that underlie the field’s practices? What counts as research in English studies? What counts as knowledge? What are some of its concrete, lived realities – in terms of its system of graduate education and the job prospects of its scholars?\n\nWe will approach these questions in a variety of ways – through close readings of literary texts, discussions of essays in literary theory, reviews of recent and past examples of criticism in English studies and analysis of research by OSU faculty members. To ground our discussions throughout the semester, we will often focus on a few particular problems in literary and cultural studies including the following: how to understand what language refers to and how it gains meaning; the history of nationalism and its relationship to language and literature; the history and theory of prose narrative, one of the contemporary age’s most ubiquitous, distinctive literary forms; the concept of social power and that concept’s relationship to language; and the ideas of individuality, social collectivity, and social action as it is conceived by some scholars in our field.\n\nPotential Text(s): Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf\n\nEnglish 6761.01/.02: Introduction to Graduate Study in Narrative and Narrative Theory\n\nInstructor: Amy Shuman\n\nThis course focuses on one of the most significant and pervasive modes that humans have developed in order to come to terms with their experiences in the world, narrative. We will seek to establish a dialogue between primary narratives and narrative theory. We will ask both how narrative theoretical constructs can illuminate our selected narratives and how those narratives push back against or elude those constructs in ways that require responsible theorists to revise their ideas. In this way, the course seeks to engage students with the process of knowledge construction in narrative studies.\n\nPotential Texts: The theoretical readings will fall under the rubric of \"Foundations and Innovations,\" which means we will read some older texts that remain crucial to work in the field--Aristotle's Poetics, Shklovsky's \"Art as Technique,\" Genette's Narrative Discourse and some recent work on fictionality, cognitive narratology, intersectionality, and, most likely narrative medicine. Our primary narratives will come from multiple media (print, graphic, film, television) and from the two macrogenres of fiction and nonfiction. Likely texts include Whitehead's The Underground Railroad, Jesmyn Ward's \"On Witness and Respair,\" Barry Jenkins' Moonlight, a graphic narrative to be selected later, and a range of short fictions and nonfictions.\n\nPotential Assignments: Exercises in reading theory; close reading paper; theory and interpretation paper; final paper designed by the student so that it's tailored to their interest.\n\nEnglish 6763.01: Graduate Workshop in Poetry\n\nInstructor: Kathy Fagan Grandinetti\n\nThis is a workshop course for CW MFA poets and those other MFA writers who have experience reading and writing poetry. The course is studio-based and will focus on student poems. Other requirements include but are not limited to full participation orally and in notes for peers, learning journals, poet presentations, artists' statements and attendance at local poetry readings.\n\nGuiding Questions: This is a process-oriented course. We'll read and write like we mean it.\n\nPotential Text(s): Texts will be provided.\n\nPotential Assignments: 6-8 poems minimum (see above).\n\nEnglish 6765.01: Graduate Workshop in Fiction\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nThis is a fiction workshop for graduate students enrolled in the MFA Program in Creative Writing. In this course we will explore and analyze the craft of writing fiction through reading, discussion, and practice. The aim of this workshop is to cultivate a supportive community of writers invested in helping their classmates develop their craft and achieve their aesthetic goals. In this weekly workshop we will focus on the way original language and style, the creation of lifelike and surprising characters, and the use of form and seamless structure support that undertaking. We will look closely at narrative structure, complex and intriguing characterization, vivid and detailed setting, scenes and summary, and so on.\n\nPotential Texts: Best American Short Stories, 2020\n\nPotential Assignments: Several flash pieces and one or more longer stories or novel excerpts.\n\nEnglish 6768: Workshop in Creative Nonfiction\n\nInstructor: Elissa Washuta\n\nThis course is devoted to furthering MFA students' development of the craft of creative nonfiction. Through the study of published nonfiction pieces and craft texts, development of new work, peer critiques and revision, students will continue to refine their individual approaches and further their understanding of how to most effectively use craft elements to shape their work. Open only to MFA students in creative writing. This course is most appropriate for writers who have been admitted to the MFA program in creative nonfiction or have completed at least one OSU MFA course in creative nonfiction.\n\nPotential Text(s): The primary texts will be the workshop essays. Additional weekly readings will be assigned as needed and will be made available via Carmen.\n\nPotential Assignments: Two workshop essays, weekly written responses to peer essays, robust participation, final assignment TBD.\n\nEnglish 6778.01/.02: Introduction to Graduate Study in Film and Film Theory\n\nInstructor: Jesse Schotter\n\nAn advanced survey of the methodologies, contexts, and development of film and film theory.\n\nEnglish 6779.22: Introduction to Graduate Study in Rhetoric: Renaissance to 20th Century\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nEvery student of rhetoric should have a basic grasp of rhetorical history, a nuanced understanding of modern and contemporary developments in rhetorical theory, a finely attuned critical eye and skill at close reading and rhetorical analysis, and the ability to locate interesting rhetorical texts and to unpack them in discussion and in writing. I want to honor the design of the course and review some important historical developments in rhetoric from the Renaissance forward, but the bulk of our time will be split between digging into modern and contemporary rhetorical theory and in practicing theoretically informed methods of rhetorical analysis and criticism. Class periods will alternate between discussing rhetorical theory, discussing methods of rhetorical analysis, and performing critical readings of (primary) rhetorical texts. Students will take turns presenting one set of readings on an important theoretical term, concept or system and then teaching us how to perform one kind of rhetorical analysis (these two are not necessarily linked). Each presentation should be accompanied by a short outline/summary and annotated bibliography for that topic. We'll do a variety of short papers including, reading notes, rhetorical analyses, reviews of rhetoric journals, and then some sort of longer project relevant to your interests: annotated bibliography, conference paper, traditional research paper, etc.\n\nPotential Texts: Articles like Charland \"The People Quebecois\" and \"Constitutive Rhetoric.\" Books like Burke's Rhetoric of Motives and Austen How to Do Things with Words.\n\nPotential Assignments: Short Papers; Rhetorical analysis, Reading Response, Annotated Bibliography. One longer paper.\n\n7000-Level\n\nEnglish 7818.01/7818.02: Seminar in Later Medieval Literature: Medieval Women\n\nInstructor: Karen Winstead\n\nWe will examine works written by, for, and about women in the Middle Ages. Our texts will range from romances to saints’ legends to personal letters. Their subjects will include sovereigns, entrepreneurs, wives, recluses, visionaries, warriors and cross-dressers. Margery Kempe, Julian of Norwich and Marie de France are among the authors. Though our focus will be medieval England, we will also read Continental works, including the infamous letters of Abelard and Heloise, the autobiography and feminist writings of Christine de Pizan and the gender-bending Romance of Silence. Our investigation will problematize popular views of medieval women as either denizens of an idealized chivalric world or as victims of a malignant patriarchy, and we will consider how stereotypes about women in the past inflect views of women in the present. If you’re not a medievalist, don’t worry: readings in Middle English will be available either in modern English translations or in editions geared towards students with little experience in the language.\n\nPotential Text(s): Lais of Marie de France; Book of Margery Kempe; Capgrave, Life of Saint Katherine; Trial of Joan of Arc; Paston Letters; Monodies of Guibert of Nogent; Letters of Abelard and Heloise.\n\nPotential Assignments: Requirements will include informal close reading assignments that will be the basis of our discussions and a research project you develop in consultation with me.\n\nEnglish 7858.01/.02: Seminar in U.S. Ethnic Literature and Culture: U.S. Empire, Race, and Sexuality\n\nInstructor: Pranav Jani\n\nTaking a transnational approach to US Ethnic Studies, this course employs an interdisciplinary lens to explore the histories, interactions—political and cultural—of African and Asian peoples across the globe. Investigating key moments of Afro-Asian connections within the regions of Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and the United States, we will develop a transnational understanding of racialization in the context of capitalist modernity while paying careful attention to the specific national dynamics that have shaped race differently in each location.\n\nOverall, we will explore race and racialization as complex historical processes that have involved multiple groups of people simultaneously – and thereby complicate the dichotomy of “whiteness” and “Blackness” that dominates US discourse of race. Poets, musicians, novelists, activists, comedians, and film directors, along with historians and cultural critics, will guide us through these rich histories and interactions.\n\nEnglish 7860.01/.02: Seminar in 20th Century British and/or American Literature: Climate Culture\n\nInstructor: Elizabeth Sheehan\n\nAnthropogenic climate change has already altered the Earth system, giving us record breaking weather events, inaugurating another mass extinction, and exacerbating existing inequalities across the globe. And yet we also know that both the responsibilities and vulnerabilities of climate change are unevenly distributed; historically, the capitalist class in the Global North have contributed the largest amount of carbon emissions since the 19th century while the poorest in the Global South bear the lion's share of the risk. What is the role of cultural production in the face of widespread ecological breakdown? How do we refashion knowledge systems built around the segregation of historical time and geologic time, human and nonhuman nature, and social relations and environment?\n\nThis class will explore these questions through the vast and ever-growing field of literature, visual art, video games, and other media that constitute \"climate culture.\" We will undertake two large tasks: first, we will consider the ways the environmental humanities are reshaping modern and contemporary literary studies; second, we will explore the unique ways climate cultural production internalizes, configures, discloses and conceals the realities of life on an altered planet. We will take up a range of genres, forms, and aesthetic practices as we try to develop alternative literary and cultural histories and employ reading practices that take seriously the epistemological, aesthetic, and political challenges of climate change.\n\nPotential Texts: H.G. Wells The Time Machine, Sam Selvon A Brighter Sun, Octavia Butler Parable of the Sower, Jesmyn Ward Salvage the Bones, and poetry by Juliana Spahr, Craig Santos Perez, Ross Gay, and Camille Dungy. We will read widely in the Environmental Humanities and ecocriticism, including works by Stephanie LeMenager, Kyle Powys White, Heather Houser, Alexis Shotwell, Rob Nixon, Sonya Posmentier, Francois Verges, Anna Tsing, and Nick Estes, among others. We may also explore recent video games and multimodal projects that address the Anthropocene.\n\nPotential Assignments: Students will be expected to help run discussion, produced an annotated bibliography, offer a \"report from the field\" that addresses some form of climate culture, and draft a conference paper.\n\nEnglish 7871.01 (10): Seminar in the Forms of Literature\n\nInstructor: Kathy Fagan Grandinetti\n\nThis is a course intended for CW MFA students in all genres/years. We'll study poetic forms from traditional English prosody up through free verse to the poetic inventors of the 21st century, and practice writing in those forms.\n\nPotential texts: TBD\n\nPotential assignments: Each student will choose to be responsible for discussing one poetic form before we practice each.\n\nGuiding Questions: What does form mean to poetry? What are the limits to shaping your own poems?\n\nEnglish 7871.01 (20): Seminar in the Forms of Literature\n\nInstructor: Lee Martin\n\nThis is a seminar designed for writers in our MFA program, but I'm also open to graduate students from other fields who have an interest in examining short fiction from a writer's perspective. We'll consider matters of characterization, structure, point of view, detail, and language as we think more fully about the techniques crucial to the writing of short stories. There will be a creative writing element to the seminar in the respect that each student will have the chance to submit at least one of their stories to the group for workshop discussion.\n\nPotential Texts: TBD\n\nPotential Assignments: The creation and significant revision of at least one original short story.\n\nGuiding Questions: What makes a short story memorable? What are the artistic choices short story writers make, and what effects do those choices produce?\n\nEnglish 7880.01/7880.02: Seminar in Composition: The Writing Center as a Scholarly and Pedagogical Site\n\nInstructor: Beverly J. Moss\n\nWriting Centers have, in the past, been primarily examined as pedagogical sites, specifically sites focused on one-on-one, face-to-face discussion between an inexperienced writer and an expert reader/writing consultant about a specific writing task. However, in the past 15-20 years, this master narrative of the work of the writing center has been challenged. Writing Center practitioners push back against the “only for inexperienced writers” label by emphasizing that they work with all writers from all disciplines. Emerging technologies challenge the traditional model of how writing center work is carried out: do we need to be face-to-face; how do we accommodate writing groups and writers with multimodal texts? The growing body of scholarship on writing centers also establishes the writing center as a viable scholarly site where important questions about writing theories and practices are investigated. In addition, writing centers are now moving from marginal positions within universities and colleges to foundational spaces where interdisciplinary discussions about the role of writing in the university and beyond take place. In this seminar, we will examine the relationship between the growth of writing center scholarship and evolving writing center tutorial practices. We will read canonical theoretical and pedagogical texts (North, Grimm, Boquet, Lerner, Sheridan, among others); discuss the relationship between race, racism and writing center practices; explore the role of technology on current writing center practices as well as explore how writing centers serve English language learners. Other topics will include how writing center work is named and valued within the academy and the future direction of writing centers. This course will be valuable for those interested in working in writing centers as writing consultants, for those interested in directing writing centers, and those interested in engaging in writing center scholarship.\n\nPotential Assignments: Writing Center Website Rhetorical Analysis; Writing Center observation; final project.\n\n8000-Level\n\nEnglish 8858.01: Seminar in Folklore\n\nInstructor: Amy Shuman\n\nAdvanced seminar on current or specialized topics in folklore studies.\n\n*This is a combined-section course. Cross-listed in CompStd.\n\nEnglish 8997: The Dissertation Seminar\n\nInstructor: Jacob Risinger\n\nVirginia Woolf declared that writing was “like being harnessed to a shark”—thrilling, yes, but also precarious and (to put it mildly) something of a struggle. Anyone who’s waded into the murky waters of dissertation writing may have had a similar set of reactions. How do you manage this beast while also enjoying the ride?\n\nIn this convivial seminar, grad students from all corners of the English Department will convene to support and think collectively about the often-solitary work of dissertation writing. Most weeks we’ll follow a workshop model, with members of the seminar sharing work in progress with the rest of the group. In other words, this seminar will be a great way for anyone at any stage in the process to stay motivated, to get some quality feedback on your writing, and to think together in community. Short readings will also help us think pragmatically about how to navigate the dissertation writing process with aplomb. We’ll have occasion to consider time management, writing goals, the rhythm of a chapter and the shape of a project, as well the best ways to manage evidence and scholarship, cultivate an audience and isolate your own scholarly voice. We’ll also reflect on the place of the dissertation in one’s evolving professional life.\n\nFor the past two years, academic camaraderie and exchange has been in short supply. Register for a reminder of the dialogic exchange that makes graduate study in the humanities so worthwhile.\n\nNote: open to English grad students in all fields; grad students beginning work on a program of study might also benefit from the seminar.\n\n5000-level\n\nEnglish 5191: Internship in English Studies\n\nInstructor: Scott DeWitt\n\nThis internship opportunity will offer students experience in creating timely, relevant and compelling short-form promotional media (primarily video and audio) for the Department of English. Students will work closely with their supervisor (Professor DeWitt) as well as with key communications personnel to develop projects and set priorities and deadlines. English 5191, Promotional Media Internship, will be intensely hands-on and focus almost exclusively on digital media production and related work-management skills in professional settings. This internship opportunity is especially applicable to students across majors who would like to develop their digital media skills in a workplace setting and for those who have digital media skills with nowhere to apply them. Media skills are NOT a pre-requisite for this internship; students will have the opportunity to learn all media skills necessary for the class. (This internship fulfills the digital media requirement for the Writing, Rhetoric and Literacy concentration in the English Major.)\n\nPotential Assignments: YouTube videos, podcasts.\n\nGuiding Questions: How can a promotional media internship opportunity help students across majors develop their digital media skills in a workplace setting?\n\nAdditional Materials: Experience with technology is helpful, but you will learn all of the skills you need in class.\n\nEnglish 5664: Studies in Graphic Narrative: Graphic Memoir\n\nInstructor: Robyn Warhol\n\nA course designed for both graduate students and advanced undergraduates, “Graphic Memoir” will introduce the styles, structures and strategies of autobiographical life stories told in comics form. Starting with “how-to” texts by comics artists, we will investigate the relationship among form, content and medium in graphic memoirs in a variety of styles. The readings fall into three groupings: lifewriting set in the context of larger historical events; memoirs of illness and recovery; and women’s memoirs focusing on gender and sexuality.\n\nGuiding Questions: How do comics make meaning through graphic design? What can graphic narrative do for autobiography that prose narrative can't do? How (and why) do comics artists use their medium to represent personal, national and familial traumas?\n\nPotential Texts: David B (1996), Epileptic; Lynda Barry (2005), One! Hundred! Demons!; Alison Bechdel (2006), Fun Home; Bethany Brownholtz (2013), Exercises in Style: 21st-century Remix pdf; Phoebe Gloeckner (2002), Diary of a Teenage Girl; Matt Madden (2005), 99 Ways to Tell a Story: Exercises in Style; Marisa Acocella Marchetto (2009), Cancer Vixen; Scott McCloud (2006), Making Comics; Khale McHurst, I Do Not Have an Eating Disorder (web comic); Raymond Queneau (1947/1981), Exercises in Style pdf; Marjane Satrap (2000), Persepolis; Art Spiegelman (1991), Maus; GB Tran (2011), Vietnamerica.\n\nPotential Assignments: Students write weekly reading responses and do two kinds of oral presentations, one a commentary on a critical reading and one a close reading of a single page of graphic memoir. Each student creates a one-page graphic memoir. For the final project, students may choose to write a research paper or to create a more extended graphic memoir.\n\nEnglish 5721.01/5721.02: Graduate Studies in Renaissance Drama\n\nInstructor: Christopher Highley\n\nThis course will introduce students to current critical approaches, methodologies and resources in the study of Early Modern drama. It defines drama broadly, in a way that encompasses many forms of performance, from adult and boy plays on the public stage, to school plays and court masques. Topics include: the business of theater; playwrights, players, and playgoers; the control and regulation of the stage; drama in print; the closing of the public theaters; and editing Early Modern plays. The plays we read will depend on student interests, but there will be a mix of the canonical (Marlowe's Dr Faustus) and the more obscure (Ralph Roister Doister). We will also read modern scholarship, as well as documents from the period.\n\nGuiding Questions: What forms did dramatic performance take in early modern England? What functions and whose interests did it serve? Why did a culture of public playgoing emerge in London and its suburbs in the later sixteenth centuries? How was public theater organized, managed and regulated? What sorts of questions and approaches have guided recent criticism of this drama and English theatrical culture more generally? What new resources are available for the study of this subject?\n\nPotential Texts: Various paperback versions of plays as well as lots of Carmen readings.\n\nPotential Assignments: Students will give in-class reports and write a research paper (which may be based on an examination of a play in the library's rare book room). There will also be various short exercises that utilize resources like the Early English Books Online (EEBO) database; the Database of Early English Playbooks (DEEP); Martin Wiggins, British Drama: A Catalogue; the Records of Early English Drama (REED); and the Map of Early Modern London (MOEML).\n\n6000-level\n\nEnglish 6718.01/6718.02: Introduction to Graduate Study in Chaucer\n\nInstructor: Ethan Knapp\n\nIntroduction to advanced study in Chaucer, with a focus on The Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Criseyde.\n\nEnglish 6751.02/6751.22: Intro to Graduate Study in Folklore II: Fieldwork and the Ethnography of Communication\n\nInstructor: Gabriella Modan\n\nIntroduction to fieldwork and ethnology in the humanities: interviewing, participant observation, ethics, ethnographic representation. The ethnography of communication as an approach to community-based expressive forms.\n\nEnglish 6757.01/6757.11: Introduction to Graduate Study in African-American Literature, 1746-1900\n\nInstructor: Adélékè Adéẹ̀kọ́\n\nA survey of creative texts and critical interpretations representing and reflecting black culture and literary expression in the United States from 1746 to 1900.\n\nEnglish 6765.01/6765.02: Graduate Workshop in Poetry\n\nInstructor: Marcus Jackson\n\nA graduate-level workshop in the writing of poetry for MFA students in fiction or creative non-fiction with limited experience as poets.\n\nEnglish 6765.01: Graduate Workshop in Fiction\n\nInstructor: Lee Martin\n\nThis is a writing workshop for students enrolled in our MFA Program. We'll study the craft of fiction through assigned readings and the discussion of student-written manuscripts.\n\nEnglish 6765.02: Graduate Workshop in Fiction\n\nInstructor: Nick White\n\nPoets! Memoirists! This workshop is for you. It is a truth universally acknowledged that fiction is the art of lying, crafted by the lying liars who tell them. \"Art is the lie that tells a truth,\" Picasso said, or maybe he didn't. Point is, it feels like something a Picasso would say, and the sentiment strikes at the heart of what we fiction writers must puzzle through: by learning how to lie (and lie with gusto) we somehow discover our own authentic voices. Curious? Come join me.\n\nPotential Texts: An online anthology of various stories and craft essays.\n\nPotential Assignments: We will spend the first half of the semester writing flash, and then we will move on to longer stories.\n\nEnglish 6766.01/6766.02: Introduction to Graduate Studies in 20th Century Literature, 1900-1945: Modernist Studies Today\n\nInstructor: Jesse Schotter\n\nThis course will give students a snapshot of modernist studies today by focusing on the most frequently discussed texts, methodologies, and topics at the Modernist Studies Association conferences over the last five years. Topics may include new media (film, radio, comics), transnationalism, gender, disability studies, travel, periodical studies and others. Alongside primary texts we will read critical articles predominately by early career scholars.\n\nPotential Texts: Texts may include The Waste Land, Montage of a Dream Deferred, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, The Return of the Spirit, As I Lay Dying, The Lonely Londoners, Voyage in the Dark, The Last Lunar Baedeker, Krazy Kat comics and others.\n\nPotential Assignments: Assignments will include two conference length papers or one article length paper, one presentation, and participation in class discussion.\n\nEnglish 6768: Graduate Workshop in Creative Nonfiction\n\nInstructor: Elissa Washuta\n\nThis creative nonfiction workshop is open to current students in the MFA program in creative writing. Students primarily working in other genres in the program are welcome, but prior instruction in creative nonfiction is very strongly recommended.\n\nPotential Texts: Students' essays will be the primary texts for the course; others may be added to supplement as needed.\n\nPotential Assignments: New essays, revision and peer critiques.\n\nEnglish 6769: Graduate Workshop in Creative Writing\n\nInstructor: Angus Fletcher\n\nA special topics course in the writing of fiction, poetry, and/or creative nonfiction.\n\nEnglish 6780.01/6780.02: Current Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing\n\nInstructor: Susan Lang\n\nModern theories of composition; topics include: invention, style, sentence combining, evaluation, and the composing process.\n\nEnglish 6788.01: Studies in the Theory and Practice of Imaginative Writing\n\nInstructor: Timothy Griffin\n\n“What if there were a hidden pleasure/ in calling one thing/ by another’s name?,” writes poet Rae Armantrout in her Pulitzer Prize-winning 2009 volume Versed. That even the words we use everyday can mean more than one thing—and that phrases may be understood more than one way—is key to understanding both the pleasure and speculative power of poetry. And, in fact, the idea is a core premise of this course for graduate students coming from fields outside of writing: how ordinary and specialized language alike can take new shape and form, giving new weight and possibility to our most idiomatic expressions. Through both reading and writing assignments, students will both learn the discipline of poetry and, moreover, discover the poetry in what they already do.\n\nGuiding Questions: How have poets sourced and used language differently in recent decades, and how have poems taken different form over time? How might these shifts relate to those taking place in other fields of study?\n\nPotential Texts: Examining the recent history of poetry, students will read and discuss the works of modern and contemporary poets such as Amiri Baraka, Rita Dove, June Jordan, Marianne Moore, Fred Moten, George Oppen, Claudia Rankine, Layli Long Soldier, Wallace Stevens, and Ocean Vuong, among others.\n\nPotential Assignments: Composing and sharing imitations of the above poets; writing and workshopping a final independent creative work.\n\nAdditional Materials: Readings will be available on Carmen.\n\nEnglish 6795.01/6795.02: Introduction to Research Methods in Rhetoric and Composition\n\nInstructor: Christa Teston\n\nEnglish 6795 prepares graduate students to conduct research in writing, rhetoric and literacy studies. This course provides an introduction to methods for analyzing texts and contexts, studying writing instruction and researching literacy practices. It also introduces students to methodological and epistemological issues related to these activities.\n\nPotential Texts: Saldaña & Omasta's Qualitative Research (2nd edition).\n\nPotential Assignments: Textual, empirical, and archival research projects.\n\n7000-level\n\nEnglish 7837.01/7837.02: Studies in 18th Century Genre; The Early Novel, Slavery and the Black Atlantic 1660-1817\n\nInstructor: Roxann Wheeler\n\nWhile this course will highlight the early novel’s contribution to practices of narration, character and incident, it will focus on the novel’s robust engagement with enslaved characters and colonization and study selected influential poetry and non-fiction about slavery, including the slave narrative. While there is surprising overlap between fiction and non-fiction, the novel itself is one of the most important ways that so-called common slaves were first imagined as important figures with interiority: we will study a very long literary engagement with noble and commoner characters who become enslaved. At its heart, this course is both a cultural and literary exploration of slavery and the Black Atlantic world.\n\nGuiding Questions: How did the racial formation of the slave-based colonies differ from Britain's? Why did novelists continue to be captivated by nobly-born slave characters into the nineteenth century? When common enslaved characters were ventriloquized, what did they say? Why were Englishmen's narratives the most attentive to the violence of slave-based Caribbean societies?\n\nPotential Texts: Saidiya Hartman, Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route (2006); Omi and Winant, Racial Formation in the United States, 3rd. ed. (2015); Aphra Behn, Oroonoko; or, The Royal Slave (1688); the Inkle and Yarico stories; Daniel Defoe, Colonel Jack (1722); Samuel Richardson, Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded (1741); The Memoirs of Unca Eliza Winkfield, or the Female American (1767); John Gabriel Stedman, Life in an Eighteenth-Century Slave Society (Surinam) (1790); Anon. The Woman of Color (1808); Mary Prince, The History of Mary Prince (1831).\n\nPotential Assignments: Annotated bibliography and in-class presentation; research paper on literary, theoretical or cultural topic.\n\nEnglish 7844.01/7844.02: Seminar in Victorian Literature; Undoing Victorian Realism: Character, Form and World\n\nInstructor: Jill Galvan\n\nThis course asks what Victorian realism looks like when, untying it from traditional literary historical accounts, we pay active attention to its characterology, form and world-making. The Victorian “novel” has been canonized as a genre bent on moral didacticism and social consensus, kind of like an ideology-delivery mechanism. It is also often a major foil in the narrative of the rise of modern aesthetics, based on the premise of the Victorians’ non-interest in form, perception and sense experience. Our class will undo these presumptions by analyzing the intricacies of Victorian realism’s most distinctive features—interiority; the multiplot form; and the fine, novel-length tracing of human being in the world. To catch these features, we will read novels slowly. We will also pursue realism’s aesthetics by exploring how it extends outside the Victorians per se and persists even today. While deliberately hitting nineteenth-century British “classics,” we will open up, rather than close down, their social and ethical complexities (e.g., their treatment of whiteness), and we will trace both transatlantic and transhistorical affinities, reading the Victorians alongside American and modern/contemporary texts.\n\nPotential Texts: Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre; Charles Dickens, Bleak House; Hannah Crafts, The Bondwoman’s Narrative; Thomas Hardy, Tess of the D’Urbervilles; James Baldwin, If Beale Street Could Talk; either Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway or Elizabeth von Arnim, Vera.\n\nPotential Assignments: Engaged participation, two brief analytical responses, a researched presentation and a final seminar paper.\n\nEnglish 7861.01/7861.02: Studies in Narrative and Narrative Theory; Storytelling in Everyday Life: Interactive, Dialogic Approaches to Narrative\n\nInstructor: Amy Shuman\n\nStudies of narrative interaction take into account how participants in a storytelling occasion manage their relationships to each other, to their larger worlds and to the events and characters within the narrative. Narrative is one cultural resource for negotiating meaning across these relationships in both local and larger cultural, historical and social contexts. This is not to say that narrative does successfully negotiate meaning, but rather that it holds out this possibility. Interaction implies relationships between tellers and listeners but also invokes other relationships beyond the narrative occasion, including cultural institutions, ideologies and other social frameworks. This course explores a variety of narrative interactions, including face-to-face conversation, social media exchanges, legal affidavit and other written communication. In each course session, we will cover both formal elements of narrative (how narrative works) and examples that integrate ideologies and narrative exchanges (for example, in disability rights discourses, in political asylum hearings, in human rights narratives, in classrooms, in families, in ritual occasions, etc.)\n\nGuiding Questions: How does narrative work in everyday life, and how are personal narratives entangled in cultural, societal ideological frameworks?\n\nPotential Texts: All readings will be available on Carmen.\n\nPotential Assignments: Students will design a final project, for example, a paper for a conference presentation, a creative work, a blog or podcast or annotation of further readings.\n\nEnglish 7872.01/7872.02: Seminar in English Linguistics: Introduction to Discourse Analysis\n\nInstructor: Gabriella Modan\n\nThis course is an overview of some major approaches to analyzing spoken and written discourse used in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology, including interactional sociolinguistics, conversation analysis, ethnography of communication, pragmatics and critical discourse analysis. We will explore how social interaction both constructs and is constructed by discourse which occurs in or in relation to it. The approach that we will take to analyzing texts is a micro one, focusing on the details of linguistic structure and how those details connect to more macro spheres of social engagement. Students will collect examples of spoken and written texts, and analyze them in short paper assignments. For students interested in examining discourse as a methodology in social science or humanities research, this course will give you the tools to investigate how language structure – not just content – shapes perceptions and social interaction in ways that can have material consequences.\n\nPotential Assignments: 3 short papers, discussion leading, a final paper.\n\nEnglish 7878.01/7878.02: Seminar in Film and Media Studies: Transmedia Affects: Race, Indigeneity, Gender and Sexuality in Visual Culture\n\nInstructor: Jian Chen\n\nThis seminar explores theories, histories, and practices of film, video, performance and digital media which engage with symbolic systems of racism, white supremacy, settler colonialism and cis-hetero-patriarchy as they have shaped dominant visual culture. How have these different mediums been used to visualize racial, indigenous, gender and sexual differences, and how have these visualized differences affected social imaginations and hierarchies? How have these mediums been repurposed to re-imagine and potentially transform social hierarchies? We will discuss media forms in their specificity, while building a collective sense and analysis of their transmedia connections, especially in the age of networks. The seminar will rely heavily on film and media studies scholarship in critical race, indigenous and ethnic studies and feminist, queer and transgender studies—and also the vital work of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color), feminist, queer and trans/ Two-Spirit/ nonbinary/ gender variant artists.\n\nPotential Text(s): Course materials may include work by Kara Keeling, Fatimah Robing Rony, Leticia Alvarado, Wendy Chun, Nicholas Mirzoeff and Eliza Steinbock.\n\nPotential Assignments: Course requirements may include a final research paper and assignments focused on developing components of the final paper.\n\nEnglish 7889.01/7889.02: Seminar on Digital Media Studies: History, Theory and Practice of Digital Media\n\nInstructor: John Jones It is safe to say that all of our media is now digital—from television and newspapers to movie theaters and books, while the final media product may take different forms, it is nearly impossible to find a mass media that does not include digital tools in some stage of its production. Given the ubiquity of digital media, its study is inherently interdisciplinary and multifaceted. In this course, we will study the uses and impacts of digital media through its history and development in the 20th and 21st centuries with the goal of better understanding the origins of current digital communication technologies. The course will touch on topics like the pre-history of digital media, networks, race, accessibility, multimodality, the digital humanities, maker culture and rhetorics of code. While this course is located in the Writing, Rhetoric, and Literacy program, students from all concentrations who are interested in the history and future of digital media are welcome. We will read widely in digital media theory and history.\n\n8000-level\n\nEnglish 8858.01/8858.02: Seminar in Folklore: Ecocritical Fairy Tales\n\nInstructor: Mary Hufford\n\nOver the past four centuries Fairy Tale has been continually rescripted as a staging ground for ideological debate between a Voice of modernity and the voices (masks) of its Others. This graduate seminar brings ecofeminist and ecocritical perspectives to bear on the study of fairy tales. Linking the domination and exploitation of women and nature under patriarchal capitalism, ecofeminism offers an angle onto myriad Others inhabiting Fairy Tale: poor woodcutters laboring at forest edges far from castles, dwarves toiling in mines, giants and dragons guarding their hoards, together with a coterie of more-than-human others: animals, vegetables, minerals, and those category defying mycelia, aka toadstools. Ecocriticism, the critique of the environmental effects of the literature we produce and consume, frames our exploration of the literary ecology of fairy tales, an ecology intertwined with industrialization, modernity and the fate of the global forest.\n\nUsing critical and social theory, we will explore the transformations of fairy tale landscapes, players, and plots, and meanings made of these in contemporary literature and cinema. Our guides will include leading scholars of fairy tale, social history, forest ecology, environmental history, and ecofeminist and ecocritical theory. How might worldwide historical variants and contemporary revisions of fairy tales model and enact struggles over gendered, racialized, colonized, naturalized, spiritualized, and post-humanized social identities? Modelling stages of transformation, how might contemporary renditions of fairy tales ratify or contest dominant narratives of development (human, industrial, post-industrial and more)?\n\nCoursework will include in-class presentations, contributions to the course discussion board and leading discussion, writing and archival exercises, and a term project. On the way, you’ll become acquainted with tools indispensible to folk tale scholars and fairy tale revisionists: motif and tale-type indexes. Your term project could be: 1) an ecofeminist or ecocritical comparison and analysis of international variants of a tale type; 2) an analysis and comparison of revisions (including emergent memes) of a particular tale type; 3) description and analysis of an ecocritical trope characterizing contemporary fairy tale revisions; or 4) a curriculum module for educational or therapeutic use – well-annotated and theorized, and designed to contribute to an unfolding, unfinalizable conversation on the fate of Fairy Tale in the Anthropocene.\n\nGuiding Questions: Why are fairy tales so popular? What social functions are ascribed to fairy tales? How do revisionists use fairy tales to question norms and assumptions? How have historical and contemporary revisionists repurposed fairy tales for both ecological restoration and social change?\n\nPotential Texts: Maria Tatar, ed. The Classic Fairy Tales; William McCarthy, Cinderella in America; Robert Pogue Harrison, Forests: The Shadow of Civilization; Carolyn Merchant, The Death of Nature; Angela Carter, Burning Your Boats; Iiro Kuttner and Ville Tietavainen, Tales by Trees; Diana Beresford-Kroeger, The Global Forest: Forty Ways Trees Can Save Us; Emma Donaghue, Kissing the Witch; Patrick Chamoiseau, Creole Folktales; selected articles, variants, and films posted to Carmen; Lapine and Sondheim, Into the Woods; and a shadow syllabus to include readings identified and agreed upon by students in the seminar.\n\nPotential Assignments: Identify and analyse fairy tale references in the media; locate variants of a particular tale type by consulting the ATU Tale Type index; correspond with and for Dr. Henwife, an obscure but extremely wise advice columnist; post and respond to prompts on the discussion board; complete a term project (for examples please see the course description above)\n\nAdditional Materials: Access to Carmen and to films that I will assign\n\n*This is a combined-section course. Cross-listed in CompStd.\n\nEnglish 8982.01/8982.02: Textual Criticism and Editing\n\nInstructor: Sarah Neville\n\nEvaluation of literary editorial methods, past and present; training in skills requisite to the textual critic and scholarly editor; practice in textual editing.\n\n5000-level\n\nEnglish 5710: Introduction to Old English\n\nInstructor: Leslie Lockett\n\nThis course teaches students to read and declaim Old English, which was the spoken language of the English people in the early Middle Ages (up to ca. 1150), and the original language of evocative poems including Beowulf and The Wanderer. In the first half of the semester, we will learn declensions, conjugations and vocabulary; in the second half, we will translate works of Old English prose and poetry. No prior knowledge of Old English or other languages is required.\n\nGuiding question(s): What did English look and sound like in the centuries before Chaucer, and long before Shakespeare? How is classical Old English poetry radically different in form from any other English poetry since the age of Chaucer? How did non-literate poets compose their poems, and how were poems passed down in manuscripts when printing was not yet available?\n\nPotential text(s): Mitchell and Robinson's A Guide to Old English.\n\nPotential assignments: Students are graded on their preparation for each class meeting, eight quizzes, three written translation assignments and a final exam.\n\nEnglish 5720: Shakespeare's Dramaturgy\n\nInstructor: Sarah Neville\n\nThis course for graduate students and advanced undergraduates will examine Shakespeare’s stagecraft and consider both his playwrighting techniques and the way his practices responded to the ever-changing circumstances of the theatrical ecosystem in which he worked. We will ask (and try to answer) questions about matters like properties (“How spectacular is a severed head?”), juxtaposition (“How do repeated entries train audiences to see patterns?”), character (“Who gets to speak soliloquies?”), structure (“Why do plays often begin with figures we never see again?”), pace (“How much time elapses between scenes?”), genre (“Why are the comedies set in foreign countries?”) and the way that such choices affect the relationship between actors and an audience.\n\nGuiding question(s): How does Shakespeare...DO THAT?\n\nPotential text(s): Titus Andronicus, King Lear, Macbeth, Richard III, Henry IV, Two Gentlemen of Verona, Much Ado About Nothing, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, The Winter’s Tale.\n\nPotential assignments: Students will be evaluated by short writing assignments, a minor presentation and a long paper.\n\n6000-level\n\nEnglish 6410: Introduction to Medical Humanities and Social Sciences\n\nInstructor: Jim Phelan\n\nThis course functions both as the core requirement for the Interdisciplinary MA in Medical Humanities and Social Sciences and as an elective for other students with an interest in its subject matters. The course addresses the question of how our understanding of medicine alters when we shift from conceiving it primarily as a science to conceiving it as a cultural practice, something that inevitably has political, ethical, ideological and even aesthetic dimensions. We will divide our inquiry into the following units: medical inquiry, historical foundations, cultural critiques of medicine, disability studies and narrative medicine. By the end of the course, students should have a deeper understanding of the methods and some key findings of the medical humanities and social sciences, and in that way, be well-equipped for further study in the field.\n\nGuiding question(s): What happens to our understanding of medicine when we shift from conceiving of it as driven by science and technology to conceiving of it as a cultural practice?\n\nPotential text(s): Mukherjee, Sidharth, The Laws of Medicine; Starr, Paul. The Social Transformation of American Medicine; Anne Fadiman, The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down; Tweedy, Damon, Black Man in a White Coat; David, Lennard, ed. The Disability Studies Reader; Crosby, Christina, A Body Undone; Charon, Rita, et al. Principles and Practices of Narrative Medicine; Frank, Arthur, The Wounded Storyteller: Body, Illness, and Ethics; and the documentary How to Survive a Plague, dir. by David French, and the film Gattaca, directed by Andrew Nicoll.\n\nPotential assignments: Weekly writing exercises (in class); agenda setting; short analytical paper; abstract, presentation and final paper.\n\nEnglish 6662: Literary Publishing\n\nInstructor: Nick White\n\nThis course is designed for writers in the MFA Program in Creative Writing, and explores the world of publishing—its past, present and future. From placing work in literary journals to querying agents, we will study this ever-changing landscape and prepare writers for what they may encounter on their journey to publication.\n\nPotential text(s): Making a Literary Life: Advice for Writers and Other Dreamers by Carolyn See; Before and After the Book Deal: A Writer's Guide to Finishing, Publishing, Promoting, and Surviving Your First Book by Courtney Maum; Literary Publishing in the Twenty-First Century edited by Travis Kurowski, Wayne Miller and Kevin Prufer.\n\nPotential assignments: Reading for The Journal; presentations on literary journals and small presses; book reviews; author interviews; editorial projects; copyediting exam.\n\nEnglish 6700: Introduction to Graduate Study in English\n\nInstructor: Aman Garcha\n\nTo introduce you to graduate study in English, this course will help you understand some answers to a number of large questions: What are some of the main theoretical assumptions that underlie the field’s practices? What counts as research in English studies? What counts as knowledge? What are some of its concrete, lived realities—in terms of its system of graduate education, the job prospects of its scholars and its mechanisms of publication and advancement?\n\nWe will approach these questions in a variety of ways—through close readings of literary texts, discussions of essays in literary theory, reviews of recent and past examples of criticism in English studies, and analysis of research by Ohio State faculty members. To ground our discussions throughout the semester, we will often focus on a few particular problems in literary and cultural studies including the following: how to understand what language refers to and how it gains meaning; the history of nationalism and its relationship to language and literature; the history and theory of prose narrative, one of the contemporary age’s most ubiquitous, distinctive literary forms; the concept of social power and that concept’s relationship to language; and the ideas of individuality, social collectivity and social action as it is conceived by some scholars in our field. To ground our discussions even further, we will take Virginia Woolf’s 1925 novel Mrs. Dalloway as our object text, which will help us understand something about literary history, cultural studies, popular culture, rhetorical analysis, theoretical controversies, and how research is and has been done.\n\nPotential text(s): Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway\n\nEnglish 6700.01: Introduction to Graduate Study in English\n\nInstructor: Kay Halasek\n\nThis course will prepare students for future success both in other graduate courses in the Ohio State Department of English and throughout their careers as teacher‐scholars of English. This class introduces students to tools, research methods, and theoretical approaches used to make and share knowledge in the field of English Studies. It also reviews strategies for effective academic writing and argumentation and issues related to teaching in contemporary college classrooms.\n\nGuiding question(s): What constitutes an effective scholarly \"reading\" of a text or artifact? What critical and theoretical questions have informed and continue to inform research and scholarship in English studies? How and why have those questions changed over time? What does it mean to situate a reading within or from a particular critical perspective? How does one evaluate the success of a scholarly argument? What generic principles and practices typically inform successful scholarly arguments? How do I go about reading, researching and writing successful academic arguments?\n\nPotential text(s): Culler, Jonathan. Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2011; Shelley, Mary. Frankenstein. 1818. Norton Critical Edition. W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 2012; Wilder, Laura. Rhetorical Strategies and Genre Conventions in Literary Studies: Teaching and Writing in the Disciplines. Southern Illinois University Press, 2012. (Note: This text is available for free via Project Muse).\n\nPotential assignments: Frankenstein reading log; discussion posts; scaffolded research activity sequence; final project.\n\nEnglish 6755: Introduction to Graduate Study in American Literature—Origins to 1840\n\nInstructor: Elizabeth Hewitt\n\nThis course will introduce students to graduate study in early U.S. literature (both before and after the establishment of the nation). We will read a wide range of genres (sermon, poetry, slave narratives, political tracts, autobiography, epic and novel) from the 17th through the early 19th centuries. In reading and studying the archive of early American literature, we will also consider some of the major theoretical and historical problems central to current scholarship in the field. Where do we locate the historical “origins” of the field? What are the geographical borders of a colonial territory that is “owned” by many nations? How do you represent literary voices that were not documented by the emerging print culture of 18th-century North America? How do writers living in North America invent a national literature? How is literature used to establish and police racial, national and gendered identities? Although our study will interrogate the fallacies of American exceptionalism, we will also investigate the ways that the establishment of a legitimate national literary culture was an inextricable component of political legitimacy broadly conceived.\n\nPotential text(s): Anne Bradstreet, Jonathan Edwards, Mary Rowlandson, Samson Occom, Benjamin Franklin, Olaudah Equiano, Thomas Jefferson, Phillis Wheatley, Charles Brockden Brown, Hannah Webster Foster and Catherine Maria Sedgwick.\n\nPotential assignments: Short response papers; an annotated bibliograpy; and a longer essay/final project.\n\nEnglish 6761: Introduction to Narrative and Narrative Theory\n\nInstructor: Jim Phelan\n\nThis course focuses on one of the most significant and pervasive modes that humans have developed in order to come to terms with their experiences in the world: narrative. We will seek to establish a dialogue between primary narratives and narrative theory. We will ask both how narrative theoretical constructs can illuminate our selected narratives and how those narratives push back against or elude those constructs in ways that require responsible theorists to revise their ideas. In this way, the course seeks to engage students with the process of knowledge construction in narrative studies.\n\nGuiding question(s): What is narrative? Why is it so pervasive? What are its dangers? How do we work on it, and how does it work on us?\n\nPotential text(s): The theoretical readings will fall under the rubric of \"Foundations and Innovations,\" which means we will read some older texts that remain crucial to work in the field: Aristotle's Poetics; Shklovsky's \"Art as Technique\"; Genette's Narrative Discourse; and some recent work on fictionality, cognitive narratology, intersectionality, and, most likely, narrative medicine. Our primary narratives will come from multiple media (print, graphic, film, television) and from the two macrogenres of fiction and nonfiction. Likely texts include Whitehead's The Underground Railroad, Jesmyn Ward's \"On Witness and Respair,\" Barry Jenkins' Moonlight, a graphic narrative to be selected later and a range of short fictions and nonfictions.\n\nPotential assignments: Exercises in reading theory; close reading paper; theory and interpretation paper; final paper designed by the student so that it's tailored to their interest.\n\nEnglish 6763: Graduate Workshop in Poetry\n\nInstructor: Kathy Fagan Grandinetti\n\nThis is a workshop course for MFA poets. We will read and write poems and discuss strategies for improvement.\n\nPotential text(s): Visiting poets and texts chosen to be shared by instructor and the class.\n\nPotential assignments: Your poems; an aesthetics statement or learning journal; weekly poet presentations.\n\nEnglish 6765.01: Graduate Workshop in Fiction\n\nInstructor: Nick White\n\nThis is a fiction workshop for graduate students enrolled in the MFA Program in Creative Writing. In this course we will explore and analyze the craft of writing fiction through reading, discussion and practice. The aim of this workshop is to cultivate a supportive community of writers invested in helping their classmates develop their craft and achieve their aesthetic goals. In this weekly workshop we will focus on the way original language and style, the creation of lifelike and surprising characters and the use of form and seamless structure support that undertaking. We will look closely at narrative structure, complex and intriguing characterization, vivid and detailed setting, scenes and summary, and so on.\n\nPotential text(s): Best American Short Stories, 2020\n\nPotential assignments: Several flash pieces and one or more longer stories or novel excerpts\n\nEnglish 6768: Writing Creative Nonfiction\n\nInstructor: Michelle Herman\n\nThis is the workshop in creative nonfiction for MFA students admitted to the program in nonfiction and other MFA students who feel confident enough to join us in the undertaking of writing and revising to completion personal essays, memoirs, lyric essays and any other of the many subgenres under the capacious umbrella of creative, or literary, nonfiction.\n\nPotential text(s): We will create a class anthology of recommended readings to discuss—details to come.\n\nPotential assignments: Short assignments based on prompts; two complete essays; revisions.\n\nEnglish 6768: Writing Creative Nonfiction\n\nInstructor: Lee Martin\n\nThis is a creative nonfiction workshop designed for poets and fiction writers in our MFA program, and, if space permits, interested students outside the program. In other words, this is a workshop for those who have minimal or no experience with the genre. It's a safe space to try writing personal essays, lyric essays, pieces of memoir or whatever form of creative nonfiction that appeals to you. Most of our time will be spent studying and practicing the craft with students having the chance to present essays for our workshop discussion. I'll ask students to give me a significant revision of one essay at the end of the semester.\n\nEnglish 6769: Special Topics in Creative Writing\n\nInstructor: Kathy Fagan Grandinetti\n\nThis is a course for MFA students in creative writing who carry service loads either inside or outside the program. We will use this course as an internship experience while also exploring, with the help of professionals in the field, ways to translate service to post–MFA job skills.\n\nGuiding question(s): How can we perform meaningful service for the MFA that can carry over into professional opportunities?\n\nPotential assignments: Ongoing service work and detailed records of that work.\n\nEnglish 6778: Introduction to Graduate Studies in Film\n\nInstructor: Jesse Schotter\n\nThis course provides students with an introduction to the questions, methods and approaches to film studies from the beginnings of film up to the contemporary era. We will examine films from different eras, cultures, and cinematic traditions and look at them through various critical and theoretical lenses. We will survey formalist, historicist, auteurist, genre-based, Marxist and feminist approaches. We will explore issues ranging from the rise of the New Wave to contemporary trends in world cinema and Slow Cinema, from the universalism of silent film to the current transition to digital cinema, from questions of race and representation to debates about film spectatorship. In so doing we will also touch on the histories of avant-garde and documentary films.\n\nPotential text(s): Daughters of the Dust, Bush Mama, Imitation of Life, Within Our Gates, The Last Laugh, Man with a Movie Camera, M, The Conversation, Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard, Vertigo, Killer of Sheep, Jeanne Dielmann, Chronicle of a Summer, Close-Up, Children of Men, Holy Motors, In the Mood for Love.\n\nPotential assignments: Two presentations and a final seminar paper.\n\nEnglish 6779.02: Introduction to Graduate Study in Rhetoric—Renaissance to Contemporary\n\nInstructor: James Fredal\n\nEvery student of rhetoric should have a basic grasp of rhetorical history, a nuanced understanding of modern and contemporary developments in rhetorical theory, a finely attuned critical eye and skill at close reading and rhetorical analysis, and the ability to locate interesting rhetorical texts and to unpack them in discussion and in writing. I want to honor the design of the course and review some important historical developments in rhetoric from the Renaissance forward, but the bulk of our time will be split between digging into modern and contemporary rhetorical theory and in practicing theoretically informed methods of rhetorical analysis and criticism. Class periods will alternate between discussing rhetorical theory, discussing methods of rhetorical analysis and performing critical readings of (primary) rhetorical texts. Students will take turns presenting one set of readings on an important theoretical term, concept or system and then teaching us how to perform one kind of rhetorical analysis (these two are not necessarily linked). Each presentation should be accompanied by a short outline/summary and annotated bibliography for that topic.\n\nPotential text(s): Articles like Charland's \"Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the Peuple Québécois\"; books like Burke's Rhetoric of Motives and Austin's How to Do Things with Words; additional primary texts.\n\nPotential assignments: A presentation with an outline and annotated bibliography; short papers (including reading notes, rhetorical analyses and reviews of rhetoric journals); and one longer paper relevant to the student's interests (annotated bibliography, conference paper, traditional research paper, etc.).\n\n7000-level\n\nEnglish 7350.01: Folklore Theory—Tradition\n\nInstructor: Amy Shuman\n\nNo concept is more central, or more fraught, in folklore studies than the concept of tradition. Long ago, folklorists rejected static concepts of tradition and instead understand traditionalizing as a process of recreating and inventing the past in the present. That said, some forms, stories, ways of making things endure, inviting the study of transmission of knowledge and cultural practices across generations and across cultures. Tradition is a weighty term, invoking questions of who controls the transmission of culture, what counts as transmittable and how is tradition from one context borrowed, appropriated and/or remade in another? To address these questions, we will explore tradition as part of the circulation of culture, centering not only on the appearance of stability in objects and practices but also on the complexity of performers, audiences, apprentices and masters and on the dynamic processes of transmission, including learning, memory, invention, imagination, transformation, creolization, appropriation, censorship and adaptation.\n\nGuiding question(s): How is the concept of tradition used to claim attachment (or distance) from the past?\n\nPotential text(s): Reading packet on Carmen\n\nCross-listed in CompStd\n\nEnglish 7858: Seminar in U.S. Ethnic Literature and Culture—U.S. Empire, Race and Sexuality\n\nInstructor: Martin Joseph Ponce\n\nThis course brings to bear the frameworks of U.S. empire, race and sexuality to the comparative study of 20th- and 21st-century U.S. ethnic literatures. In what ways can the analytic of U.S. empire facilitate meaningful connections across different racial formations resulting from settler colonialism, chattel slavery, overseas war and colonization, immigration and refugee policies, economic and cultural neocolonialism, and neoliberal bio/necropolitics? What kinds of literary forms and techniques have African American, American Indian, Arab American, Asian American and Latinx authors used to address histories of colonial, racial and sexual domination and violence? What possibilities for "
