        "text": "I have taken on the challenge to become better-read.\n\nMy post-college ambitions included waking up prior to six in the morning, hustling to and from the metro station and K Street, and arriving home post seven in the evening. Somewhere in the vortex that is city ambition and adulting, my love of reading became a forgotten and unnoticed lost indulgence.\n\nEarlier this year I began a resolution with myself to read the classics that I hadn't studied in all of my schooling, an aspiration that directed me to an understanding of the immensities of content that I had sadly missed in all of great literature. I then willingly and dutifully led myself down the rabbit hole of a forlorn and obsessive quarter-life crisis; this steered me to a boundless search of reading content and a variant of book challenges, to which I then found one entirely too long and seemingly unattainable, which of course, by then, fit the bill instantly. Being an avid fan of the bookish Rory Gilmore, a girl who made smart cool, since Gilmore girls premiered like an after-school special on ABC Family (because I missed the WB years), I've taken it upon myself to become not only well-read but also well-directed in my endeavors.\n\nAmy Sherman-Palladino created a truly fantastic, false-reality world that is the show Gilmore girls, which has created its own cult-like following. This brings me to the core of my choosing this particular challenge first, this show is brilliant. Gilmore girls exemplifies how brilliant ASP is, simply by how well the dialogue is written, and good writing comes from reading, and reading in mass. Alas, here I will postmark my reading challenge and contribute any synopses linked below from the books she purposely chose to include in each episode as props and character development enhancement.\n\nAccording to Australian writer Patrick Lenton, there are 337 books captured from the complete seven seasons of the Gilmore Girls series. While I know that this list of 337 books is not absolutely correct in entirety, I plan to use the list as a catalyst and edit as I see fit. Although I would aspire to read them in the order they are presented, I am following along with The Rory Gilmore Reading Challenge on Goodreads. It presents a read-along and discussion every month on any listed book and also a chosen quarterly catch-up book. Follow my progress on my Goodreads account here. I plan to read each book with the group, but I am subject to pick up any listed book that strikes my fancy intermittently, including those from AYITL. The books are alphabetically organized below for reference.\n\n2020 UPDATE: Click for the true, updated, and edited list here: The Gilmore Project. This page is dedicated to a correct and curated list of books as referenced and mentioned in the entirety of ASP's Gilmore girls. I have distinguished which authors, actual books, and movies are mentioned throughout the show for the most accurate list of all references. I have also signaled which books are physically read by each character and which movies were watched during the multitude of Gilmore movie nights. As a bonus, I also denote which textbooks are featured as they are seen. What can I say? I like to be thorough.\n\nⓡ = referenced book pertaining to general pop culture, no visual or mention of being read\n\nⓜ = referenced movie pertaining to general pop culture, context of being seen or watched\n\nFollow me on Goodreads\n\nFollow my rg-challenge\n\n#\n\n1. 1984 by George Orwell\n\nA\n\n1.

The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion\n\n“Headmaster Charleston, faculty members, fellow students, family and friends, welcome. We never thought this day would come. We prayed for its quick delivery, crossed days off our calendars, counted hours, minutes and seconds and now that it’s here, I’m sorry it is, because it means leaving friends who inspire me and teachers who’ve been my mentors, so many people who’ve shaped my life, and my fellow students lives impermeably and forever.\n\nI live in two worlds. One is a world of books. I’ve been a resident of Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha County, hunted the white whale aboard the Pequod, fought alongside Napoleon, sailed a raft with Huck and Jim, committed absurdities with Ignatius J. Reilly, rode a sad train with Anna Karenina and strolled down Swann’s Way. It’s a rewarding world, but my second one is by far superior. My second one is populated with characters slightly less eccentric, but supremely real, made of flesh and bone, full of love, who are my ultimate inspiration for everything.\n\nRichard and Emily Gilmore are kind, decent, unfailingly generous people. They are my twin pillars, without whom I could not stand. I am proud to be their grandchild. But my ultimate inspiration comes from my best friend, the dazzling woman from whom I received my name and my life’s blood, Lorelai Gilmore. My mother never gave me any idea that I couldn’t do whatever I wanted to do or be whomever I wanted to be. She filled our house with love and fun and books and music, unflagging in her efforts to give me role models from Jane Austen to Eudora Welty to Patti Smith. As she guided me through these incredible eighteen years, I don’t know if she ever realized that the person I most wanted to be was her. Thank you, Mom: you are my guidepost for everything.”"
