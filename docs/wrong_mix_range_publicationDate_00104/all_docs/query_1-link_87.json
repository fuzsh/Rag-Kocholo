        "meta_description": "The Rory Gilmore Reading List What is the Rory Gilmore Reading List? After mindlessly watching one too many episodes of Gilmore Girls, I had to admit that I found myself wanting to read. Rory Gilmore reads so much that I actually felt like turning of the tv and explore my bookcases instead. Because one reading challenge just isn’t enough, I thought it would be fun to find out exactly what books Rory is seen with or referencing throughout the series. Some book nerd like me must have compiled them somewhere. I was right, someone had indeed collected all the Rory Gilmore books, and I found them here on Buzzfeed! So now, it’s just about getting started! Obviously, due to studying dramaturgy, I’ve read most of the Shakespeare plays before, along with a handful of other novels. For this challenge however, I will start from scratch and review every single one as I read them! I’ll be linking to my reviews in the list below, when I’ve read them and it’s up on the blog. It will take a while before I finish this challenge. In the meantime, why don’t you join me and read some of these books? It’s always nice to read something else than what you’re used to and Rory Gilmores reading list offers quite a variety. If you’re curious to see what other books I’ve read and reviewed on the blog, have a look at this collection here>> or the book shelf Okay, let’s go!
