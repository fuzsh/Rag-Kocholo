As the genre of what Milton called “heroic song,” though, epic predates even the invention of writing, and is perhaps the oldest form of poetic production. What has allowed such epic success? The persistence of epic through cultural and linguistic change is one of the form’s central themes: how can words heroically uttered and deeds heroically dared be passed on from one lifetime to those that follow? How are they transformed? What does it mean to take up as one’s own something that has been passed down from a culture no longer present? Such questions become even more pressing in moments when one culture encounters another and in its new context must confront what to retain, what to adopt, and what to invent. In this course we will consider how epic narrative projects, recalls, and reworks its history as tradition. Benefitting from several recent translations of epic poems by women, we will consider the role of gender in epic. Finally, we will look at contemporary epics that push back against the histories that have often been associated with the genre and find new themes in the form.\n\nTexts: Homer, Iliad (transl. Wilson); Vergil, Aeneid (transl. Bartsch); Beowulf (transl. Headley); Milton, Paradise Lost; Atwood, The Penelopiad; Wolcott, Omeros; as well as selections from other epic poems\n\nObjectives: Students will become acquainted with the principal formal features of the genre of epic through the study of a number of representative works in the genre. In addition they will be introduced to some theories of epic, both current and historical. They will learn something of the genre’s history of self-reflection, cultural contexts within which epic appears, and some of the cultural uses to which epic has been set. They will consider how epic differs from two other long narrative forms, novel and romance. Using these materials, they will sharpen critical argumentation skills orally and in writing.\n\nEnglish 200Literary Histories: All the Single Ladies: Spinsters, Wives and Madwomen from 1800 to the Present (Historical Breadth Post 1830)WinterTTh 12:30-1:50\n\nEnglish 200 Literary Histories: All the Single Ladies: Spinsters, Wives and Madwomen from 1800 to the Present (Historical Breadth Post 1830)\n\nCourse Description: Following Beyoncé’s iconic call to action, this course takes a look at a number of “single ladies” - and a few who managed to “put a ring on it” - in literature, film and TV from the last two hundred years. Together, we will investigate archetypal figures of femininity, from the spinster to the madwoman to today’s “girlboss.” How do our literary and popular media construct and deconstruct these categories at different moments in history? Pairing feminist theory with primary texts, we’ll ask: how does marriage function to resolve class tensions? How does it construct and enforce constructions of race and gender? And how, according to these texts, can women find social, emotional and financial independence? Texts may include selections from Jane Eyre, The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands, A Room of One’s Own, Conversations with Friends, Sex and the City, and The Bachelor.\n\nTeaching Method: Seminar discussion, short lectures\n\nEvaluation Method: Participation, analytical essays and a final project\n\nTexts including ISBNs: Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte (ISBN 9780141441146), Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands by Mary Seacole (ISBN 0140439021), A Room of One's Own by Virginia Woolf ( ISBN 0156787334), Conversations with Friends by Sally Rooney (ISBN 0156787334), Bridget Jones's Diary dir. Sharon Maguire (2001), selections from Sex and the City created by Darren Star (1998-2004) and The Bachelor created by Mike Fleiss (2002-2024)\n\nTexts will be available at: Required novels at Norris Bookstore.

Students will engage topics in Black study—including questions of freedom, fugitivity, nationalism, and racial justice—as well as literary and cultural history to analyze and explain the development of Black letters in the U.S. Our course will move quickly through four periods in black literature and cultural production: enslavement, Emancipation, and Reconstruction, Jim Crow and segregation, Civil Rights and the Black Arts Movement, and multiculturalism and the 21st century. Throughout, will read a range of sources including poetry and prose, and long- and short-form works to understand the ideas and imaginaries that inhere in Black literature. We will also listen to Black music, including, the Blues, jazz, and Hip Hop and view television and films that have been important entries in the cultural history of Black life.\n\nReadings will include:\n\nHansberry, A Raisin in the Sun 978-0679755333\n\nShange, for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuff 978-0684843261\n\nWhitehead, The Nickel Boys 978-0345804341\n\nEnglish 270-1American Literary Traditions, Part 1 (Historical Breadth Pre 1830)GrossmanTTh 11-12:20English 277Introduction to Latinx LiteratureRodriguez PliegoMW 11-12:20English 288Topics in Literature and EthicsSchwartzTTh 9:30-10:50English 300Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Murder on the Bestseller ListSyvertsenMW 11-12:20\n\nEnglish 300 Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Murder on the Bestseller List\n\nCourse Description: Recent bestsellers such as The Girl on the Train are part of a long legacy of wildly popular murder fiction. In the early nineteenth century, murder and other forms of gothic violence were often confined to remote castles or the wilds of the English moors. With the explosion of detective stories and crime fiction, however, these middle-class nightmares invaded both the supposedly blissful domestic scene and the modern city. Writers started to use murder as an occasion to pose radical questions about which deaths are considered “grievable.” Increasingly, authors depicted amateur detectives who were skeptical of the social and legal order they were reestablishing through their work. Beginning with founders of the genre Edgar Allen Poe and Pauline Hopkins (author of the first Black murder mystery), this course follows the transatlantic tradition forward through Raymond Chandler’s hard-boiled tales, mid-century psychological thrillers by Patricia Highsmith, and recent detective fiction by Walter Mosley. Paying particular attention to how gender and race shape the narration of these tales, we will conclude with a survey of twenty-first-century chart-toppers by Paula Hawkins and others. Readings will be supplemented with films, including excellent adaptations of The Girl on the Train and The Talented Mr. Ripley. Please note that this class is not open to students who took an earlier version of this course.\n\nEnglish 300Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Time-travelling Heroes of the Multiverse!: History and Cultural Difference in Modern FictionGodfreyMW 12:30-1:50\n\nEnglish 300 Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Time-travelling Heroes of the Multiverse!: History and Cultural Difference in Modern Fiction\n\nCourse Description: Since H.G. Wells’s unnamed time-traveler first rocketed forward to the distant future, time travel has been a favorite thought exercise for writers, day-dreamers, and artists. What does it mean to fantasize about the future and to reimagine the past? How does time travel undercut or complicate commonplace linear narratives, progress narratives, or coming of age stories? In this course, we’ll investigate the genre as a way into thinking about the fundamentals of literary analysis and methodology. We’ll combine readings of literary classics like H.G. Wells’s The Time Machine (1895) and Marghanita Laski’s forgotten The Victorian Chaise-Longue (1953) with selections by modern sci-fi writers like M. John Harrison and N. K. Jemisin. We’ll also consider mixed-media additions to the canon, including the anime The Girl who Leapt Through Time (2006) and the movies Interstellar (2014) and Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022). Together, we will confront questions about cultural difference and blur the boundaries between “past,” “present,” and “future.”\n\nTeaching Methods: Short lectures, seminar discussion, collaborative group exercises.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Participation, discussion posts, short analytical paper, final project.\n\nTexts Include: H.G. Wells, The Time Machine; Marghanita Laski, The Victorian Chaise-Longue; Virginia Woolf, Orlando (ISBN 0156031515); N.K. Jemisin, “Too Many Yesterdays, Not Enough Tomorrows”; the Daniels, Everything Everywhere All at Once.\n\nEnglish 307Advanced Creative Writing: Anecdotes and Yarns: Getting Voice to the PageBouldreyTTh 2-3:20\n\nEnglish 307 Advanced Creative Writing: Anecdotes and Yarns: Getting Voice to the Page\n\nCourse Description:\n\n“Neanderthal man listened to stories, if one may judge by the shape of his skull. The primitive audience was an audience of shock-heads, gaping round the campfire, fatigued with contending against the mammoth or the woolly rhinoceros, and only kept awake by suspense. What would happen next? The novelist droned on, and as soon as the audience guessed what happened next, they either fell asleep or killed him.”\n\n—E.M. Forster, Aspects of the Novel\n\nWhere does writing come from? By looking at examples of literature that were initially meant to be spoken aloud, we will explore how they were placed, elegantly and not, onto the page. How does this happen? The bardic boom, the pulpit pitch, the mad futurist with a megaphone—so many of the great works of literature were first delivered orally, then spelled out and called literature. Speeches, psalms, slams, rants, anecdotes, manifestos, declarations, sermons, lectures, yarns, ballads, brags, jeremiads, prayers, incendiary instructions for the coming revolution—we’ll investigate as many as we can of these in the readings, considering, as writers, how we can get performative narratives of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction from the stage to the page. We will discuss, too, the instructive aspect of art and literature, the difference between voice and style, and how oral culture differs from written culture, with a serious take on Walter Ong’s Orality and Literacy. We will consider formal prosody, rhetoric, and poetic forms, and original and amusing methods inventive writers come up with to interpret the sound of speech. Readings may include sermons by John Donne, Toni Morrison, and Herman Melville; prayers and suras from Adam Zagejewski and the Koran, Brags from Beowulf, Beastie Boys, Sharon Olds, and Shmuel HaNagid, anecdotes from Ivan Turgenev, Tatyana Tolstaya, and Olga Tokarczuk, murder ballads from Cole Porter and Dolly Parton, speeches and declarations from Susan B Anthony and Frederick Douglass, and jeremiads by Jamaica Kincaid, Valerie Solanis, and Joy Williams.\n\nWhile writing your own fictions (not necessarily from the oral tradition), we will discuss the instructive aspect of art and literature, the difference between style and voice, how delivery by great orators can change the meaning of the material, and how the speech on the page has its own specific power that makes it, in its way, a second, separate work of literature.\n\nTeaching Method Reading, lecture, discussion, workshop.\n\nEvaluation:\n\n4 short creative writing projects in fiction, prompts as given\n\n1 long creative writing project in fiction\n\n1 optional revision of one of the 4 projects for revised grade\n\n2 short papers (2-3 pages), called annotations\n\nCourse Requirements:\n\nCreative work (50%)\n\nShort Papers (30%)\n\nClass participation (20%)\n\nEnglish 312Studies in Drama: Men Dancing (Historical Breadth Post 1830/Race & Ethnicity/Gender, Sexuality & Embodiment)ManningW 9:30-11:50\n\nEnglish 312 Studies in Drama: Men Dancing (Historical Breadth Post 1830/Race & Ethnicity/Gender, Sexuality & Embodiment)\n\nCourse Description: This course examines men dancing in diverse genres onstage and onscreen—blackface and Black minstrelsy, ballet and tap, modern and postmodern dance. The inquiry will focus on the intersection between gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and nationality in theatrical performances from the early 19th through the early 21st century. Readings will be complemented by visual documentation and by visits from guest artists.\n\nEnglish 324Studies in Medieval Literature: Pagan and Christian in Medieval Literature (Pre 1830)NewmanMWF 10-10:50\n\nEnglish 324 Studies in Medieval Literature: Pagan and Christian in Medieval Literature (Pre 1830)\n\nCourse Description: Medieval culture was overwhelmingly Christian, but it was heir to several pre-Christian religions. Germanic paganism brought monsters, defiant heroism, and expectation of a coming “twilight of the gods,” while Celtic paganism supplied magical objects and mysterious Otherworld visitors. Contrary to popular belief, the Church did not suppress the use of pagan sources, but medieval writers transformed the materials they inherited, producing sophisticated texts that present a Christian point of view layered above tantalizing and elusive pagan subtexts. In this class we’ll look at (1) the Old English world of Beowulf with an apocalyptic novel based on it, Maria Dahvana Headley’s The Mere Wife; (2) three tales about magical shape-shifting characters: Marie de France’s Yonec, The Wife of Bath’s Tale by Geoffrey Chaucer, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; and (3) the romance of the Holy Grail—a Celtic magical cauldron that evolved into a prized Christian relic. The class may also include film adaptations such as the comedy classic, Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), and David Lowery’s imaginative retelling of The Green Knight (2021).\n\nTexts:\n\nBeowulf, trans.

What is the nature of moral and ethical transgression: is sin a disposition, a thought, an action, or an external force? And how does one make amends for such transgression? Over the course of the quarter, we will attempt to answer these questions by exploring the shifting representations of sin, secrets and confession that pervade late medieval literature. Analyzing the texts of preachers and poets alike, we will investigate the ways in which medieval writers adapted their depictions of sin to address the major social and political issues of their day, highlighting certain sins while hiding others as the moment required. Along with sin, we will examine the practice of confession in its historical and literary contexts, discovering how priests, poets, and playwrights exploited and transformed this pastoral tool for narrative and social ends. While giving students with a background in confessional practice and the discourse of Seven Deadly Sins, this course will also provide an introduction to some of the major works of the late Middle Ages: Dante’s Purgatory, Langland’s Piers Plowman, and Everyman. We will also explore how David Fincher’s 1995 film, Se7en reworks these medieval concepts for a contemporary audience.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Discussion and some lecture\n\nEvaluation Method(s): class attendance and participation are required; discussion board posts; two papers, short assignments and an oral presentation.\n\nTextbooks will be available at: Norris Center Book Store.

As their worlds widened, deepened, and multiplied, English writers and thinkers invented new worlds of their own: fairy realms, enchanted islands, kingdoms of darkness, lunar landscapes, perfect polities and nightmare ones, imagined worlds that could critique of their own or propose and explore things that seemed impossible in it. Despite being avowed as fictions, usually, these speculative worlds claimed value, seriousness, and even kinds of truth through the extravagance of their fantasies, while also asserting their pleasurableness and recreativity. In this class we will explore some of these worlds of imagination and how and why early modern writers crafted them, including Thomas More’s Utopia, Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene, and Margaret Cavendish’s The Blazing World, as well as related works on exploration and science by Columbus, Cortes, Galileo, and others.\n\nEnglish 338Studies in Renaissance Literature: Queering the Crown: Marlowe, Shakespeare, and their Afterlives (Pre 1830/Gender, Sexuality & Embodiment)MastenTTh 3:30-4:50\n\nEnglish 338 Studies in Renaissance Literature: Queering the Crown: Marlowe, Shakespeare, and their Afterlives (Pre 1830/Gender, Sexuality & Embodiment)\n\nCourse Description: How can we think about the transhistorical nature of queerness in English culture? Moving from the Renaissance to the present, the course follows the literary careers of two influential tragedies -- Christopher Marlowe’s Edward II and Shakespeare’s adaptation and rewriting of it in Richard II -- to think about the representation of queer kingship over time. Together we’ll analyze theatrical revolutionary Bertolt Brecht’s landmark early twentieth-century adaptation of Marlowe’s play and its “alienation effect,” twentieth-century productions and films of Marlowe tied to the early gay-liberation movement (Ian McKellen) and the early AIDS crisis (Derek Jarman’s), and twenty-first century rewritings, including a companion play that incorporates figures in/against queer culture from Gertrude Stein, Harvey Milk, and Julie Andrews to Margaret Thatcher (Tom Stuart’s play After Edward). We’ll conclude with the recent gay rom-com “Red, White, and Royal Blue.” Critical readings will delve into the history of sexuality, queer readership and book history, and theories of dramatic adaptation and performance.\n\nTeaching method: Discussion and mini-lecture.\n\nEnglish 365Studies in Postcolonial Literature: Postcolonial Sexualities (Post 1830/Gender, Sexuality & Embodiment/Race & Ethnicity/Postcolonial & Comparative Literatures/Identities, Communities, and Social Practice/Transnationalism and Textual Circulation/Global Overlay)MwangiMW 11-12:20\n\nEnglish 365 Studies in Postcolonial Literature: Postcolonial Sexualities (Post 1830/Gender, Sexuality & Embodiment/Race & Ethnicity/Postcolonial & Comparative Literatures/Identities, Communities, and Social Practice/Transnationalism and Textual Circulation/Global Overlay)\n\nCourse Description: This course responds to shifts in paradigms of gender and sexuality in writing from the global south. Should we use western terms (e.g., \"gay\" and \"lesbian\") to describe sexual practices in the global south? What are the main theoretical issues in postcolonial studies, and how would the positions change if we factored in gender and sexuality? How are sex relations used as an allegory of the national condition? How does sexuality intersect with other postcolonial concerns (e.g., environmental crises). What are the attitudes toward inter-species sex among postcolonial writers? How best do we integrate activist positions in postcolonial concerns? Authors to be discussed include Jessica Hagedorn, Witi Ihimaera, H. Nigel Thomas, Nawal el Saadawi, Chris Abani, K. Sello Duiker, Suniti Namjoshi, and Lawrence Scott. We will consider postcolonial theoretical statements by a wide range of thinkers (e.g., Keguro Macharia, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, Gayatri Gopinath, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Chinua Achebe etc.).\n\nTeaching Method: Interactive lectures, debates, role play, one-on-one meetings, and small-group discussions.\n\nEvaluation Method: A 6-page paper, Canvas postings, regular self-evaluation, peer critiques, class participation, pop quizzes (ungraded), and 1-minute papers (ungraded).\n\nTexts May Include:\n\nCliff, Michelle, No Telephone to Heaven, New York: E.P.

By tracing different representations of urban life, this course examines the signification of the metropolis in African American cultural production. Although our focus will primarily center on cultural texts, we will address a number of the “push and pull” factors that prompted the Great Migration and the social forces that have subsequently kept many African Americans in the city. In focusing on a set of cultural texts, we will consider the ways in which African Americans have imagined both the allure and dangers of life in the city. Literature may include work by Nella Larsen, Ralph Ellison, and LeRoi Jones; artists may include the photographers Wayne Miller and Camilo José Vergara as well as the painter Jacob Lawrence; film media may include Coolie High and Good Times; music may include hip hop artists from Public Enemy to Common. Critics may include W.E.B. DuBois, St. Clare Drake, Raymond Williams, Mike Davis, and Mary Pattillo.\n\nTeaching Methods: Lecture.\n\nEvaluation Methods: 2 essays; in-class Final Examination.\n\nTexts include:\n\nJames Baldwin, If Beale Street Could Talk\n\nTeju Cole, Open City\n\nLorraine Hansberry, A Raisin in the Sun\n\nJames Weldon Johnson, Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man\n\nNella Larsen, Passing\n\nPaule Marshall, Brown Girl, Brownstones\n\nTexts will be available at: TBA\n\nEnglish 375Studies in Asian American Literature: Interracial Encounters (Post 1830/Race & Ethnicity/Identities, Communities, and Social Practice/US Overlay)HuangMW 12:30-1:50\n\nEnglish 375 Studies in Asian American Literature: Interracial Encounters (Post 1830/Race & Ethnicity/Identities, Communities, and Social Practice/US Overlay)\n\nCourse Description: The United States is set to become a majority minority country by 2045. What are the many promises—and what are the many pitfalls—of interracial encounters, and what do they reveal about the country writ large? How do minority writers understand and narrate each other? This class brings contemporary African American, Native American, Latinx, and Asian American literature into relation with a focus on interracial dynamics. By examining complex topics from Black/Asian conflict during the 1992 LA Riots to the shared border migrations of indigenous and Latinx subjects, we will develop an analytical framework attuned to how American racial identity has been differentially and unevenly constructed through history, culture, and politics. A central goal of the course is decentering whiteness as the primary locus of literary analysis, to allow for more nuanced interpretations of topics such as U.S. imperialism, mixed race identity, activism, labor history, and immigration. In the process, we will familiarize ourselves with the richness and diversity of multiethnic American literature by considering a variety of genres, including poetry, novels, short stories, and film.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Seminar-based discussions.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Graded participation; in-class presentation; regular reading responses; two short essays; and one longer essay.\n\nTexts include:\n\nAnna Deavere Smith, Twilight Los Angeles, 1992\n\nKaren Tei Yamashita, Tropic of Orange\n\nNatalie Diaz, Postcolonial Love Poem\n\nTexts will be available at: Primary texts will be available at the Norris Bookstore and on reserve in the library. Other texts will be available on Canvas.\n\nEnglish 377Topics in Latinx Literature: Latinx and Indigenous Literatures of the U.S.-Mexico Border (Post 1830/Race & Ethnicity/Identities, Communities, and Social Practice/US Overlay)Rodriguez PliegoMW 3:30-4:50\n\nEnglish 377 Topics in Latinx Literature: Latinx and Indigenous Literatures of the U.S.-Mexico Border (Post 1830/Race & Ethnicity/Identities, Communities, and Social Practice/US Overlay)\n\nCourse Description: The U.S.-Mexico border was first envisioned in writing when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) imagined the course that a new dividing line would run: from the Gulf of Mexico through the Rio Bravo/Rio Grande until the town called “Paso,” west toward the Gila River and onto the Pacific Ocean. This line would mark not only land and water but also racial and ethnic formations. Indigenous nations saw their territories split in half by a border that considered their homelands wilderness. Mexicans who found themselves north of the imagined line had to grapple with a new vocabulary to define themselves as they lost their lands to settlers. Those who ended up south of the border attempted to reconcile their recent independence from Spain with the loss of half of the country as they, too, tried to piece together a narrative for their new identity. This course will walk students through the text and maps of the 1848 treaty and the literary works that continue to process its aftershocks throughout the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. Some of the authors we will read include Chicana theorist Gloria Anzaldúa, Laguna Pueblo author Leslie Marmon Silko, and Mexican writer Yuri Herrera. We will learn about the discourse of Manifest Destiny, the Chicano Movement, and contemporary literature from Latinx, Indigenous and Mexican writers who continue to tell the stories about their ancestral lands, their migration journeys, and their encounters with a line that became both border and borderlands.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Discussion-based.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Midterm and final paper, creative mapping project, attendance and participation.\n\nTexts include: Signs Preceding the End of the World by Yuri Herrera (9781908276421). Short stories, poetry and excerpts from Leslie Marmon Silko, Gloria Anzaldúa, Ofelia Zepeda, Cristina Henríquez, Tommy Orange, and others.\n\nTexts will be available at: Signs Preceding the End of the World will be at the Northwestern bookstore and all other materials will be uploaded to Canvas.\n\nEnglish 378Studies in American Literature: The Jazz Age: Love and Art in the 1920s (Post 1830)SavageTTh 12:30-1:50\n\nEnglish 378 Studies in American Literature: The Jazz Age: Love and Art in the 1920s (Post 1830)\n\nCourse Description: In “Echoes of the Jazz Age,” F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that “it was an age of miracles, it was an age of art, it was an age of excess, and it was an age of satire. “ During the cultural crisis of Modernism, when a variety of intellectual revolutions and the unprecedented carnage of the Great War suggested that Western civilization was either a sham or doomed, writers and other artists created new literary forms. Their aesthetic innovation often depicted art and love (or sex) as parallel (or contradictory) ways to create meaning the wasteland of Modernity. In this class, we will read and discuss canonical, lesser-known, and popular texts of ‘20s in order to explore how these revolutionary writers saw love and art in their own time and, maybe, in the future.\n\nTeaching Method: Lecture & Discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method: Participation in class discussion; short one-page responses to each text; plus a variety of options for critical papers, ranging from several short argumentative essays to one long research paper.\n\nTexts include: Eliot’s The Waste Land, Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises and In Our Time, Boyle’s Plagued by the Nightingale and The First Lover and Other Stories, Fauset’s Plum Bun, and Dos Passo’s Manhattan Transfer, as well as Herriman’s Krazy Kat and Walt Disney’s Mickey Mouse.\n\nEnglish 381Literature and Medicine: Underlying Conditions: Race, Health, Medicine (Post 1830/Race & Ethnicity/Identities, Communities, and Social Practice)HuangMW 2-3:20\n\nEnglish 381 Literature and Medicine: Underlying Conditions: Race, Health, Medicine (Post 1830/Race & Ethnicity/Identities, Communities, and Social Practice)\n\nCourse Description: Race is socially constructed—but how is it medically constructed? This seminar surveys Black, Latinx, Asian, and Indigenous American literary and cultural production to question how “healthy” bodies in the United States are constituted, and in turn, what these racialized processes reveal about the essential role of race in producing a body politic. Concomitantly, we will also read scholarship from ethnic studies that charts racialized comorbidities, pre-existing conditions, and environmental racism, as well as work that expands our understanding of race’s imbrications with medical paradigms such as eugenics, genetics, informed consent, reproductive rights, disability, mental illness, and, of course, pandemics.\n\nIn addition to excavating the long histories and present problems surrounding medical racism, another goal of this course is tracking the medicalization of race itself. As such, we will challenge commonly held perceptions of bodies, pain, ability, and the constitution of equitable futures. We will also supplement our reading with guest lectures from medical professionals working at the intersection of race and medicine. Students will take away from the class a deeper grasp of the discourse surrounding race and medicine, as well as how to deploy this knowledge in their critical interpretations of cultural production. Some conceptual questions for consideration include the following: how do texts by writers of color challenge normative assessments of what constitutes health and wellness? How do we ethically consider race and medicine without resorting to postracial idealism? And to what extent can creative experiments generated in art and literature re-envision the medicalized terms under which race is understood?\n\nTeaching Method: Seminar-based discussions.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Graded participation; in-class presentation; regular reading responses; two short essays; and one longer essay.\n\nTexts include: Please verify before purchasing. Assigned primary texts will likely include pieces such as Helena María Viramontes’s Under the Feet of Jesus, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson’s Noopiming, Chang-rae Lee’s On Such a Full Sea, Carmen Maria Machado’s Her Body and Other Parties, Oscar Cásares’s Brownsville, Rafael Campo’s What the Body Told, Susan Power’s The Grass Dancer, Roxane Gay’s Hunger, Rachel Khong’s Goodbye, Vitamin, Leslie Marmon Silko’s Ceremony, I Am Legend, Octavia Butler’s “Speech Sounds,” Audre Lorde’s The Cancer Journals, Reservoir Dogs, Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, the art of Felix Gonzalez-Torres.\n\nTexts will be available at: Primary texts will be available at the Norris Bookstore and on reserve in the library. Other texts will be available on Canvas.\n\nEnglish 382Literature and Law: Ideas of Justice (Pre 1830)SchwartzTTh 11-12:20\n\nEnglish 382 Literature and Law: Ideas of Justice (Pre 1830)\n\nCourse Description: This course will examine ideas of justice in western cultural and literary traditions. The focus will be the classical tradition, the biblical tradition, and Shakespeare who inherited both and reworked them in the early modern period. The trial of Socrates, the trial of Jesus, biblical prophecy, tragedy in Shakespeare, and a modern work by Melville will be included. Our exploration will be done in the context of theories of justice, and we will read those theories alongside the literature. But we will also heed how literature itself offers elaborations of theories of justice, following their consequences both within legal frameworks and beyond, as they shape the public and intimate lives of people. We will ask how religious ideas of justice inform and depart from secular ideas of justice, how retributive and distributive ideas of justice are imagined and critiqued, and how the relation between justice and law has been conceived.\n\nTexts Include:\n\nBible excerpts (can use online)\n\nThe Last Days of Socrates (Penguin) ISBN 0-14-044582-X\n\nUrsula La Guin, The Ones Who Walked Away from Omelas https://shsdavisapes.pbworks.com/f/Omelas.pdf\n\nRomeo and Juliet by Shakespeare (Arden Edition) ISBN 1903436915\n\nSaint Joan by Bernard Shaw (Penguin Edition) ISBN 0140437916\n\nBilly Budd (TOR) ISBN 0143107607\n\nThe Case for Reparations by Ta-Nehisi Coates (I will send you the online link)\n\nJustice: What’s the Right Thing to Do by Michael Sandel (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux) ISBN 0374532508\n\nEnglish 383Special Topics in Theory: Black Feminist Theory (Post 1830/Gender, Sexuality & Embodiment/Race & Ethnicity/Identities, Communities, and Social Practice)BeyTTh 2-3:20\n\nEnglish 383 Special Topics in Theory: Black Feminist Theory (Post 1830/Gender, Sexuality & Embodiment/Race & Ethnicity/Identities, Communities, and Social Practice)\n\nCourse Description: This course begins not from the premise, necessarily, of an intellectual and political genealogy of black women. Though also not to the exclusion of this. Rather, this course is one that thinks black feminist—not black “women’s”—theory and theorizing; this course chronicles the ways that the political, intellectual, ethical, and social resound radically and progressively and names that resonance—and all its vibrations and textures—black feminist theory. Thus, we will, of course, be reading a variety of black women along the jagged gendered spectrum between and beyond “cis” and “trans,” but more specifically we will be tracing the ways radical politics and ethics arise in such a way as to interrogate the established parameters of race and gender normativity, of our social world.\n\nEnglish 384Studies in Literature and the Environment: Climate Change Literature (Post 1830)DimickMW 12:30-1:50\n\nEnglish 384 Studies in Literature and the Environment: Climate Change Literature (Post 1830)\n\nCourse Description: This course focuses on climate change literature, the most active and popular arena of contemporary environmental writing. Examining a variety of 20th and 21st century works—including science fiction, spoken word poetry, narrative fiction, and film—we will analyze how literature shapes and responds to planetary crisis. Which imaginative currents—apocalyptic, technocratic, communalist, militaristic—are molding readers’ visions of the climatic future? Is it possible to narrate climate change as a multi-century catastrophe rooted in colonialism and the acquisition of capital? What can we learn about climate change from literature that we can’t grasp through other fields of study? Since the works in this class cover a broad geographic range and include both award-winning texts and relatively unknown books, we will also theorize how—and why—particular writers’ voices become central or peripheral within climate discourse.\n\nEnglish 385Studies in Literature and Culture: Romantic Obsession, Colonial Possession: Romancing 19th and 20th-Century Colonial Literature (Post 1830/Postcolonial & Comparative Literatures/Transnational & Textual Circulation)GodfreyMW 9:30-10:50\n\nEnglish 385 Studies in Literature and Culture: Romantic Obsession, Colonial Possession: Romancing 19th and 20th-Century Colonial Literature (Post 1830/Postcolonial & Comparative Literatures/Transnational & Textual Circulation)\n\nCourse Description: Pocahontas and John Smith are making goofy, animated eyes at each other as British colonials push further into the New England interior. Outlander’s Claire and Jamie steal passionate moments during the fight for Scottish independence. And when he died, David Ochterlony—British Resident to the Mughal Court in the early 1800s—left behind thirteen Indian wives. This course asks: how and why are the tropes of possessive romance so often refigured in the colonial context? What can tracing these affects, fetishes, and motifs allow us to uncover about the emotional resonances of imperialist discourse and resistance? After grounding ourselves in classic tales of romantic obsession, we will map these romantic forms onto larger concepts of empire. Edward Said described the Orientalist impulse as “fatally tend[ing] toward the systematic accumulation of human beings and territories.” To trace these fatal, obsessive drives to possess, we will move from classic novels like Brontë’s Wuthering Heights and George Orwell’s Burmese Days to shorter texts such as Clarice Lispector’s The Hour of the Star and V.S. Naipaul’s “In a Free State.” Films include Alfred Hitchcock’s Rebecca and Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon. This course will also include readings in postcolonial and affect theory.\n\nTeaching Methods: Seminar discussion, group exercises.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Participation, discussion posts, short analytical paper, final project.\n\nTexts include: Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights (1847); Jamaica Kincaid’s “Girl” (1973); Clarice Lispector’s The Hour of the Star (1977); Jane Campion’s The Piano (1993); Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon (2023).\n\nEnglish 385Studies in Literature and Culture: Mobsters, Desperados, and Samurai: Outlaws across Genres and Cultures (Post 1830)SyvertsenMW 3:30-4:50\n\nEnglish 385 Studies in Literature and Culture: Mobsters, Desperados, and Samurai: Outlaws across Genres and Cultures (Post 1830)\n\nCourse Description: As iconic anime such as “Cowboy Beebop” and GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan’s classic album “Liquid Swords” demonstrate, the outcast samurai, the desperado, and the mobster have been adapted and (re)purposed across national boundaries and divisions of genre. Japanese artists are experimenting with Western gunslingers at the same time as American rappers are imagining themselves as the Ronin of Staten Island. What explains the persistent and global appeal of these rebellious figures? And how are they transformed as they move from one cultural context to another? Looking at a broad range of film, anime, manga, music, and literature from the 20th and 21st centuries, this course pays specific attention to the way outlaws associated with a particular culture or genre are adapted beyond their original formulations to express new social realities. From the samurai in Paris to the highwaymen of Neo-Tokyo, we will attempt to understand how and why these icons of outlaw culture have been able to captivate audiences all over the planet.\n\nTeaching Method: Seminar style, discussion-based; small group exercises.\n\nEvaluation Method: Participation, two short analytical papers, final project.\n\nTexts to include: “Cowboy Beebop” (selected episodes); GZA’s “Liquid Swords”; “Sukiyaki Western Django” (Dir. Takashi Miike); “Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai” (dir. Jim Jarmusch); “A Fistful of Dollars” (dir. Sergio Leone); “Cruel Gun Story” (dir. Takumi Furukawa); “City of God” (dir. Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund); “Le Samouraï” (dir. Jean-Pierre Melville); “Yojimbo” (dir. Akira Kurosawa).\n\nTexts will be made available through a combination of course reserves or Canvas. In the occasion a text is unavailable via the library, students may be required to purchase a temporary streaming subscription.\n\nEnglish 386Studies in Literature & Film: The Horror Film (Post 1830)HodgeTTh 3:30-4:50\n\nEnglish 386 Studies in Literature & Film: The Horror Film (Post 1830)\n\nCourse Description: This course surveys the modern American horror film from Psycho in 1960 to the present. Likely films to be studied include Night of the Living Dead, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Exorcist, Alien, Jennifer's Body, It Follows, Get Out, Midsommar, and others. The course will focus on one major feature-length film per week proceeding chronologically. We will analyze films textually; and we will also focus on acquiring critical vocabularies for discussing horror cinema. Major themes and questions will include not only the question of why it's fun (or not) to be scared but also what social and philosophical themes the genre of horror opens up in surprising and provocative ways (from gender, violence, and technology to childhood, evil, and race). To catalyze discussion we will read a variety of secondary sources by authors from a range of disciplines.\n\nTeaching Methods: Discussion and short lecture.\n\nEvaluation Method: Essays.\n\nRequired Texts: None.\n\nEnglish 393-1Theory and Practice of PoetryAbaniMW 3:30-4:50\n\nEnglish 393-1 Theory and Practice of Poetry\n\nCourse Description: This selective-enrollment, yearlong \"Sequence\" is designed to make students 64 Return to Calendar increasingly informed readers and self-sustaining apprentices of poetry. The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry -- including description, rhetoric, story and song -- and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of \"Daily Poems,\" thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others -- work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing.\n\nNote: No P/N registration.

Admission by application only.\n\nEnglish 394-1Theory and Practice of FictionMartinezMW 3:30-4:50\n\nEnglish 394-1 Theory and Practice of Fiction\n\nCourse Description: This course will allow you to explore how fiction works. We’ll be looking at, discussing, writing about, commenting on, and researching the elements of fiction, but mostly what we’ll be doing is writing buckets (you will be turning in a completed piece every other week during the Fall quarter), so we’ll be reading mostly to steal: we’ll figure out what works and we’ll use it for our own material. We’ll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we’ll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people’s scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we’re doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks. The more you do both of these activities, the better and more confident you’ll get.\n\nTeaching Method: Lectures, discussion, small- and large-peer workshops.\n\nEvaluation Method: This is a portfolio- and participation-based course. Grade based on timely delivery of all assigned work, with equal weight placed on your own stories and revisions and on your peer feedback.\n\nTexts Include: TBA\n\nNote: No P/N registration. Attendance at first class mandatory.

Indigenous writers have taken on the power and histories of archives—from national libraries like the Library of Congress to small, local historical societies to anthropological repositories—and made experimental literatures that challenge these institutions of power and memory. Examples include Pequot William Apess’s 19th century texts assembled out of extracts from newspapers and testimonies from other Pequots to the Oglala Lakota poet Layli Long Soldier’s intervention in legal documents at the level of the page in Whereas to Deborah Miranda’s (Ohlone-Costanoan Esselen Nation of California) assemblage of personal and institutional histories in her memoir Bad Indians. This seminar pairs Indigenous literatures with archival theory and practice. We will develop our own archival practices by learning how to work with materials in Northwestern’s Special Collections, how to identify and interpret archival materials, how to develop a research question in conversation with archival research and theoretical readings, and how to develop a sustained argument with strong evidence.\n\nTeaching Method: seminar discussions, hands-on workshops, classes in Special Collections\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nDeborah Miranda, Bad Indians (ISBN 9781597145862)\n\nLeAnne Howe, Miko Kings (9781879960787)\n\nBeth Piatote, The Beadworkers (9781640094277)\n\nBlaire Morseau/ Simon Pokagon, As Sacred to Us (9781611864625)\n\nEnglish 398-1Honors SeminarGrossmanTh 3:30-4:50\n\nEnglish 398-1 Honors Seminar\n\nCourse Description: Part of a two-quarter sequence for seniors pursuing honors in the English Literature major, consisting of a seminar in the fall quarter and an independent study with an honors adviser in the winter quarter.\n\nPrerequisites: Seniors only.

We know that narratives require some form of animating force, and we know that this force hinges on a series of causally-linked events, sometimes. Not always. In this seminar we’ll work through two disparate novel genres---autofiction and the campus novel---to tease out what makes for compelling story-telling energy: a political or cultural or personal crisis, a disconnect between public and private behavior, subgenres and their expectations (there’s a hilarious epistolary novel in our list, but there are also striking examples of science fiction, horror, the fantastical, and the crime novel), hunger, desire, hypocrisy, satire (academic and otherwise), setting, ticking clocks and timetables, and our direct lived experience. The latter is crucial: we find our most interesting plots in life. We’ll also be sure to connect these elements beyond the novel and into each of our genres: we’ll discover how these same narrative engines animate poetry and creative nonfiction.\n\nOur reading list will include Sofia Samatar’s The Practice, The Horizon, and the Chain, Annie Ernaux’s Simple Passion, Claire Louise Bennett’s Pond, W.G.

But I’ll also ask each of you to bring in a short published piece that you love that we’ll all read; it should be a piece in your primary genre---a short story or a poem or an essay---that you feel best exploits one of the topics discussed.\n\nEvery week, we will all (1) read a novel, (2) respond, (3), read the short piece chosen by one of our classmates. In addition, one of us will be responsible for a presentation on the chosen short piece.\n\nTeaching Methods: Discussion, critical and creative responses, presentations.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Discussion, critical and creative responses, presentations.\n\nTexts include: Sofia Samatar’s The Practice, The Horizon, and the Chain, Annie Ernaux’s Simple Passion, Claire Louise Bennett’s Pond, W.G.

Examining the history of English as a discipline and the emergence of different methods of analysis, we will discuss both established and emergent critical approaches and assess their applicability in the reading of a particular set of texts and in engaging different audiences. Of particular interest to us is the future of humanistic knowledge, research and writing practices in the neo-liberal academy. How do creative writing, literary theory, and literary research inform one another? In what ways can we be innovative and “marketable” in the neo-liberal realities of our times while remaining true to the core values of humanistic education? In a world that is inundated with theoretical approaches, how do we choose a methodology that best suits our goals? How can we enfold activism in our research and maintain academic standards? The main aim of the course is to equip ourselves with skills to handle different types of texts—activist, theoretical, creative etc. —in the classroom, during research, and in public-facing engagements. At the end of the course, the student should be able to analyze a primary literary text (or a set of texts) using the most appropriate theory and methodology and in a way that the analysis would have resonance beyond the narrow confines of the academy.\n\nTeaching Methods: Class discussions, library visits, guest lectures.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Weekly self-evaluation, presentations, 13-page essay.\n\nTexts include:\n\nToni Morrison, Playing in the Dark\n\nGiorgio Agamben, What is an Apparatus and Other Essays\n\nGayatri Spivak, Death of a Discipline\n\nBruce McComiskey, English Studies Reimagined\n\nJames F.

Taking Fanon’s polemic as a cue, this graduate seminar will look at a number of late twentieth-century textual and performance sites with radical instances of experimentation where articulations of blackness move into the interstitial space between meaning and non-meaning, coming into being precisely at the moment when the compositional logic of their anticipated forms are ruptured. The course will focus on three primary sites where black artists engage what might be called the poetics of dissolution to examine and critique the processes of racial formation: poetry (where the form of the line or stanza dissolves); music (where sonic interpolations puts additional, if not different, claims on the lyrical content), and visual culture (where the moves toward graphic mimesis are refused delineation). The material under consideration may include work by the poets Nathaniel Mackey, Douglas Kearney, and Harriet Mullen; sound alchemists King Tubby, Alice Coltrane, and MF Doom; and visual artists Glenn Ligon, Hank Willis Thomas, and Bethany Collins. Theoretical texts may include work by Emily Apter Barthes, Baudrillard, Fred Moten, and Saussure, as well as ethnomusicologists and linguistic anthropologists.\n\nTeaching Methods: Seminar\n\nEvaluation methods: Research essay.\n\nTexts include:\n\nDarby English, How to Read a Work in Total Darkness\n\nDouglas Kearney, The Black Automaton\n\nNathaniel Mackey, Discrepant Engagement.\n\n————.

It follows the long representational career of Christopher Marlowe’s Edward II (c. 1592): from Holinshed’s Tudor-era chronicle history and other “pre-texts” through Shakespeare’s adaptation/revision/rewriting in Richard II, to the emergence of the theatrical-alienation effect in Bertolt Brecht’s early twentieth-century translation/adaptation Leben Eduards des Zweiten, twentieth-century productions and films tied to the early gay-liberation movement (Ian McKellen in repertory as both kings) and the early AIDS crisis (Derek Jarman and “New Queer Cinema”), to contemporary re-writings -- Tom Stuart’s play After Edward; a German opera that weaves together antisemitism and homophobia; the recent rom-com “Red, White, and Royal Blue.” Critical readings in the history of sexuality, queer theory, “source” study, history of the book, adaptation theory, theory of tragedy, critical race studies and casting, and performance studies.\n\nEnglish 465Studies in Colonial & Postcolonial Literature: Postcolonial Lit and US EmpireNadimintiT 2-4:50\n\nEnglish 465 Studies in Colonial & Postcolonial Literature: Postcolonial Lit and US Empire\n\nCourse Description: TBA\n\nEnglish 496MFA Poetry WorkshopAbaniM 10-12:50\n\nEnglish 496 MFA Poetry Workshop\n\nCourse Description: TBA\n\nEnglish 498MFA Creative Nonfiction WorkshopSchulmanW 2-4:50"
