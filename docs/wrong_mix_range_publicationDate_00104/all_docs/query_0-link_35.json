        "text": "Fireside this week! I had hoped to have the start of the Imperator Teaching Paradox series ready for this week, but it has been a bit stubborn and I do not want to derail my book writing/revising schedule in order to push it out before it is ready. So that will almost certainly come next week.\n\nFor this week’s musing, I want to talk a bit about the illusion of historical stability. This was occasioned by a particularly foolish tweet that went around Twitter declaring the “feudalism was actually a pretty good system” in part because “it’s[sic] hierarchy ensured long-term stability.”\n\nNow we’ve already talked here a bit, in the context of the Crusader Kings III series, on the problems with imagining ‘feudalism’ as a coherent political-economic system. The term has been in largely ill-repute among medieval historians since E.A.R. Brown’s famous “The Tyranny of a Construct: Feudalism and Historians of Medieval Europe” AHR 79.4 (1974). Part of the problem is that feudalism bundles together a number of aspects of medieval societies (notice the plural) which need not be so bundled. In particular, the concepts being bundled are vassalage-based polities (a political system), manorialism (an economic system) and serfdom (a status for commoners), which need not go together. They did go together for a few hundred years in some (but not all) of Europe and that leads to the deceptive conceptual bundling.\n\nPerhaps the best way to demonstrate the problem, the tyranny that the construct imposes, is to simply ask the question of when feudalism started and ended. The popular answer – assumed by the original tweet, which asserts a thousand years of feudalism – is to give the date brackets for the Middle Ages itself, from around 500AD to 1500AD, but that is on its face utterly unworkable. If feudalism means anything it means vassalage based polities where individual military aristocrats were bound to each other in a hierarchy by a grant of lands, a feodum, which carried an obligation of military service from whence the term comes.\n\nBut that system, in fact, comes quite a bit later than the sixth century. We might see some early roots of the system in Charles Martel’s (r. 718-741)’s use of certain kinds of leases to exert control over his territory, but the practice was sporadic and key administrators (comites or counts) remained largely appointed and could be dismissed by the king. It’s only in the 9th and 10th century that first these titles, and then the subordinate titles below them, begin to become hereditary that we get the emergence of a vassalage-based polity rather than simply a monarchy with appointed aristocratic administrators and regional commanders.\n\nOn the other hand, as a military system, ‘feudalism’ – armies that were retinues of retinues, raised from lords who pledged fealty and homage to a king (their titles having become hereditary in the manner described above) is dying in the 1400s and dead by 1500, replaced by early modern armies of professional soldiers commanded by aristocrats acting as military entrepreneurs in the service of kings who increasingly sat at the head of unified, centralized states.\n\nMeanwhile, manorialism, the economic side of the system where landholders, often living in a fortified manor house, administered and profited from large rural estates through the exploitation of the labor of dependent farmers, that is a sort of economic system that crops up (pardon the pun) repeatedly in all sorts of agrarian societies, including many not based on vassalage. We connect it with the concept of serfdom – the creation of a semi-free underclass tied to their land and compelled to work the lands of their landlords without quite being reduced to slavery – but these systems are not coextensive and manorialism as an economic system persists past the abolition of serfdom in many places.\n\nSo the stability of an economic-political system called feudalism is largely an illusion created by taking a lot of different systems and violently cramming them into the same box labeled ‘feudal’ and then declaring that nothing changed, because the box is labeled ‘feudalism’ at the beginning and the end. And of course some parts of Europe simply weren’t ‘feudal’ in any real sense in the first place, like the Eastern Roman (‘Byzantine’) Empire, the communes of Italy, and of course many towns with civic systems of governance which might function as gigantic singular vassals of a king or emperor, but which otherwise existed outside of this system.\n\nBut even inside of that box, the ‘stability’ of the system is an illusion created by historical distance, a form of long-distance historical nostalgia that I cannot help but notice a great many reactionary social media accounts exploit. Imagine the problem this way: you are given a single paragraph – perhaps just a few hundred words – to describe the history of the last, say, century of European or American history. The Second World War and the Cold War surely merit mention, but do the Troubles or the Yugoslav Wars? Vietnam probably makes it in for the United States, but does Korea? The First Gulf War? The Second?\n\nAs we ‘zoom out’ historically, closer to what can be covered in, say, a high school world history course, or even a college-level ‘Western Civ’ survey, many of those wars, disturbances and crises first blur and then fade out of the memory entirely, producing vast swathes of apparent ‘stability’ – of periods where nothing much seems to be happening.\n\nAnd so the history of ‘feudal’ France perhaps includes the wars of Charlemagne (r.768-814) and maybe the catastrophic breakup of his empire in three civil wars under Louis (running from 818-840), but then mostly nothing (except some vague mention of ‘Vikings’) until the First Crusade (1096-1099) which is in any event far away. If we are quite lucky, the next thing someone might have heard of is the Albigensian Crusade (1209-1229) but probably not in the English speaking world; public memory might actually pick up with the Hundred Year’s War (1337-1453) and by the end of that we’re basically out of the ‘feudal’ era and the whole thing looks like centuries of stability punctuated by the occasional bit of unpleasantness.\n\nBut of course that isn’t the case: the ‘blank space’ of that history is, in fact, filled with minor wars and struggles and even some major ones. After all, the Treaty of Verdun (843) didn’t actually settle much and the status of the ‘middle’ Carolingian kingdom, Lotharingia, is in turn the subject of regular warfare until the issue is settled by Robert Capet (the Pious) in 1023. Robert’s son, Hugh, rebels against him to seize the throne at age 18 and dies fighting in 1025. His successor, Henry I was first at war in Normandy in 1047 to support William (‘the bastard’ soon to be ‘the conqueror’) against his rebelling subsidiary nobles before being at war in Normandy in 1054, 1057 and 1060 to oppose William. I could keep going, but the point is the Kingdom of France was never long at peace, just in wars that – while very significant at the time – aren’t going to make the cut in a modern history survey.\n\nOne of the things that is usually mentioned in an introductory survey but not delved into in much depth is the endemic, small-scale warfare in vassalage-based polities, because even if the Kingdom of France is not at war, that doesn’t mean it is at peace. It’s been a long time since I’ve taught the European Middle Ages, but in the past I’ve used a reading of the agreement between Hugh IV of Lusignan, a baron, and his liege Count William V of Aquitaine, which is in the venerable Rosenwein reader but you can also read online. The run-up to explain the agreement – essentially a list of all of Hugh’s grievances – provides a great sense of the continuous, petty warfare this system generated: Hugh is always at war with someone, often at war with multiple someones, notably Viscount Ralph of Thouars and a castellan, Aimry of Rancon and at points with Count William V of Aquitaine.\n\nThese sorts of smaller wars might not be as destructive as the big ones (or as destructive as wars in later or earlier periods) because state capacity was so much lower, but they were hardly stable. A peasant outside the castle at Mouzeuil (which Hugh calls the fort of Parthenay) in the first two decades of the 11th century certainly enjoyed no political stability: he was ruled first by Joscelin, then by Ralph, who was at war with Hugh, then by Hugh (briefly at peace and then back at war with Ralph), then the place was seized by force by Geoffrey (successor to Ralph) and that poor peasant’s farmland was probably raided or foraged every damn time. That poor peasant experienced at least four ‘regime changes’ in just a couple of decades (since it was the local lord that was ‘the government,’ not the king).\n\nThis same ‘flattening’ effect can happen with much more recent history. One sees this in the assertion of some sort of recent, idyllic American past (often with wildly incorrect ideas about what average Americans could afford, based on TV shows that feature either affluent families or families inexplicably living in affluent circumstances and foolishly taking them as normal). And I always find myself wondering exactly when this was supposed to be? Not the 1940s, with the Second World War. But the 1950s, with the Korean War, conscription and – by modern standards – skyhigh defense spending? The 1960s, with the country torn by the battle to end Jim Crow and establish civil rights and Vietnam? Or was it the 1970s, the famous decade of ‘malaise?’ All, of course, under the pressing thread of nuclear annihilation; I never had to do an ‘aid raid drill’ at school, but my parents did. All of that is painted over with this vague sense of a time ‘before’ where things were ‘stable.’\n\nThat isn’t to say some periods aren’t better than others: it is much better to live now than it was to live a thousand years ago, basically anywhere on Earth. But it is to caution against the assumption that periods in the past that look stable at a very basic level of knowledge were stable.\n\nOf course the more troubling thing to me here is the general rise of these distinctly reactionary ‘history’ accounts, not because I dislike their implied politics (though I often do), but because the history they are peddling is very bad. It is deeply flawed, the sort of thing that would get an undergraduate marked down for errors filled with simplistic misstatements like the ‘pyramid chart’ of ‘feudal society’ (which incorrectly implies, among other things, that the relations between lords and vassals were understood in the same term as those between lords and peasants; they were not, peasants were not vassals, they did not take oaths of fealty or homage) or that VIRILITAS was a chief Roman value. The past these low-quality pseudo-history accounts imagine is almost entirely astro-turf: half-mis-remembered and twisted into flattering shapes that have as much to do with the past as the upcoming Gladiator sequel, which is to say, almost nothing.\n\nAnd yet these accounts are massively successful despite their terribly low quality, first because their audience doesn’t know any better but also, I suspect, because their audience is flattered by the historical narrative being advanced, which almost invariably hinges on the ‘greatness’ of something called ‘western civilization,’ the bounds of which are intentionally left conveniently vague and undefined, to which the speaker and the listener belong, but not those scary others. Of course any working definition of ‘western civilization’ is going to include many of those others: the Islamic world are the heirs of Mesopotamia and Rome as much as Europe, while ‘Christendom’ includes huge swathes of the ‘Global South’ and always has.\n\nI admit, the whole thing sometimes leaves me rather despairing, because I am actually pretty successful when it comes to public history outreach and yet my reach is often far less than these low-quality, no-research meme accounts. However I am determined to continue to try, because while these sort of pseudo-historical channels do little more than replace a beautiful historical forest with astroturf, I am myself one in a long line of tenders to a 2,400 old living tradition of actual history inquiry and preservation and that legacy brings with it a duty to preserve that “exact knowledge of the past” not as an essay for the moment, but a “possession for all time.”\n\nOn to Recommendations!\n\nFor a bit more film criticism by a historian, over at The Long Library, Peter Raleigh has a long take on The Misfits (1961), which ends up as a fascinating rumination on masculinity and its connection to the theme of the dying frontier so present in Westerns, but viewed essentially with an interloper’s lens. I think its also a useful reminder that this sense of masculinity-ennui that seems especially strong in the past few years is not a new thing, but a regular and consistent strain in the culture.\n\nIn the latest Pasts Imperfect, Javal Coleman and Cole M. Smith lead in with a short essay on the value of amphorae as evidence not merely for the movement of goods, but also the movement of people, particularly enslaved people. The reminder that human beings were ‘commodities’ being moved on the same ships as the liquids (garum, olive oil and wine, generally) moving in the amphorae that we can see archaeologically is a valuable one, but the essay is also a really useful first step generally into how we can learn so much from what are basically the shipping containers (for liquids) of the ancient world.\n\nMeanwhile, behind the War on the Rocks paywall, but Rob Lee and Michael Kofman have come back from a trip to the front lines in Ukraine and have been discussing what they’ve seen on The Russia Contingency; they’ve got two podcasts out on it now and at least one more part coming. I’ve found their observations (this is hardly their first trip out to Ukraine) from talking to the folks on the front lines very valuable for understanding the conflict, avoiding a lot of the media driven ‘wonder weapon’ hype and instead getting at the impact that events are having in the conflict itself.\n\nAlso at War on the Rocks, but not paywalled today is an interesting article by Shanshan Mei and Dennis J. Blasko looking at how one actually goes about counting the personnel strength of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. The exercise is interesting both for the current security policy import but also in revealing just how complex these questions can be, even about what seems like it should be a simple question with reliable figures: how many troops do they have? The complexity of unpacking that question can also serve as a useful antidote to the common paper-strength comparisons one finds all over the internet, trying to judge military strength merely by counting tanks.\n\nAnd for this week’s book recommendation, it really had to be J. Ma, Polis: A New History of the Ancient Greek City-State from the Early Iron Age to the End of Antiquity (2024). As it says on the tin, John Ma has written a monumental history of the polis, from its origins as a political community in the Archaic period past the normal terminus for such studies in the Late Classical, proceeding through the Hellenistic and Roman periods to the end of antiquity in the fifth century CE. It is a work more than a decade in the making, not merely because Ma started it in 2011, but even more than that because it is fundamentally built up on the foundation of material produced over the last forty-or-so years, perhaps most notably years of work by the Copenhagen Polis Center published in 2005 as the Inventory. Throughout, Ma makes a clear effort to get beyond the largest and most famous poleis, instead treating the whole of what we might call the polis-world, the network of autonomous but interconnected poleis, often drawing examples from smaller and more obscure communities, a welcome change in focus as compared to what one would get in, say, a historical survey.\n\nThe book proceeds chronologically, beginning by setting the stage before the polis in the Late Bronze Age. I think this precis on what is known or suspected of pre-Archaic political systems will actually be very valuable for many readers whose knowledge of that earlier period is sketchy, if it exists at all. The book then moves into the formation of the polis from 675 to 450, understanding the polis as a fundamentally legal, political and ideological community, one identified by declarations made in laws and pronouncements as much as something subject to a neat definition, as well as how social tensions produced drifts either to the ‘open’ polis (with a relatively broadly defined citizenship, think Athens) or the ‘closed’ polis (with a narrowly defined one, think Sparta). From there the narrative moves into the crises of the classical period: the tension of polis autonomy and empire-building poleis, the challenge of stasis (domestic civil strife) and eventually towards the end of this period the steady convergence towards a more common model of the polis with “omni-democratic” and “omni-autonomous” features both as an internal political development but also as a response to Macedonian domination. Finally, we see the poleis interact with Rome, first with the brief ‘Indian Summer’ of polis autonomy brought about by Rome’s loose handling of Greece between the Macedonian wars, followed by a long process of negotiation with Roman imperial power, leading to increasingly elite-controlled poleis and a process of negotiation with Rome. After this long (c. 400 pages) narrative, we then get a series of what are, in effect, topical essays, looking as polis society, its ideology, the balancing of interests within the polis and then looking at its structure from the viewpoint of those it treated the worst.\n\nThe amount of material Ma brings together is absolutely massive, often with simple statements about developmental trends in various regions supported by paragraph long end-notes of archaeological and historical material that Ma is assimilating together into a single, coherent narrative. The scope of this book is astounding. It is thus very fortunate that Ma is a talented writer: the prose here is easy to follow, almost meditative in its flow, punctuated by illustrations and vignettes that give a sense of place and feel, especially in the chronological chapters. Consequently, while this is one of those books I have no doubt will be a mandatory addition to every grad-school comprehensive exam reading list for quite some time, it is also a great thing for the lay reader to read if they just want to learn more about the Greek polis: where it came from, what it valued, how it was structured and defined. There are a few instances where terms are used without being so clearly defined (though Ma has a talent for self-explanatory terminology, one does not really need to define ‘clusterville’ as opposed to the more technical pre-urban nucleated settlement) and some information introduced with an ‘of course’ that the lay reader may yet be meeting for the first time.\n\nIn short, the book is, I think, a masterpiece – an astonishingly learned study of the Greek polis as a political, social and cultural institution, putting together an enormous amount of material to do so. It is usable by non-specialists in a way that something like the Inventory is not. The chronological scope makes the book even better, as it begins before the beginning and proceeds all the way through the ending, rather than simply trailing off in the late classical as so many treatments of the polis do. If you ever wanted to know more about the Greek polis, in all of its periods and all of its forms, this is the book for you."
