        "text": "Anyone who's watched an episode of Gilmore Girls knows that Rory is something of a book lover and aren't surprised to find out that nearly 339 different texts were either read or mentioned throughout all seven seasons. From Rory's time at Chilton to her graduation from Yale and everything in between — including her oh, so literary relationship with Jess — it's abundantly clear to viewers that loving Rory also means loving her infatuation with literature.\n\nA lot of us grew up watching Rory grow up and were unintentionally influenced by the books she read and talked about. They played a role in shaping the adult she became, and they also impacted viewers in a way that helped us become the people we are, too. When she graduated from high school, Rory eloquently addressed her love for books in her valedictorian speech.\n\n\"I live in two worlds, one is a world of books,\" she said. \"I've been a resident of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, hunted the white whale aboard the Pequod, fought alongside Napoleon, sailed a raft with Huck and Jim, committed absurdities with Ignatius J. Reilly, rode a sad train with Anna Karenina and strolled down Swann's Way. It's a rewarding world.\"\n\nLast year, Australian writer Patrick Lenton compiled a massive list of every single book that was referenced in the Gilmore Girls series, and set out to read each one in an attempt to complete what's known as the \"Rory Gilmore Reading Challenge.\" Lenton's currently on book number 18 — Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress — and estimates if he reads one book every two weeks, it'll take him two more years to complete the challenge.\n\nHere is the full list of all 339 books:\n\n1. 1984 by George Orwell\n\n2.
