        "text": "One of the great issues in the study of what is conveniently – albeit perhaps uncritically – known as ‘Germanic heroic poetry’ has always been the pretextual evolution of the various narratives belonging to the genre. The main problem is that this requires a complex understanding of 'Germanic heroic' texts as simultaneously belonging to two worlds – the culturally and socially prestigious one of (Latinate) literacy, drawing on Classical models, and the world of (vernacular) orality, rooted in a poetics of anonymous memorial tradition. My paper argues for the relativization of this sharp dichotomy which is to be replaced by the model of a large spectrum of textual variation. More concretely, I will discuss the earliest attestations of the Sigurd/Siegfried-Brunhilda story, from the historical events related by Gregory of Tours, to the thirteenth-century Nibelungenlied and Völsungasaga. Previous understandings of the evolution of 'Germanic heroic' texts in time have been based on reconstructing various stages of development, from short action-driven lays to lengthy dialogue- and drama-laden epics. My paper will argue that rather than seeing these narratives as a series of more recent textual variants deriving in linear fashion from the earlier ones, it would be more helpful to envision the nature of Germanic heroic poetry as rhizomatic, consisting of a flux of narratives in a variety of forms (classifiable as ‘heroic lay’, ‘folk-tale’, ‘historical morality tale’ etc,) which interact with one another and with the cultural traditions into which they are adapted. The different narrative strands emerging in different milieus and shaped by them were never separate, reified objects, but rather expressions of these different cultural worlds which continuously communicated with one another. Thus, rather than attempting to reconstruct these different stages, one would gain more by looking at the forces of change – vectors for the flux of narratives and also at the interactions between the texts as such and the different cultural and social encodings of narrative and historical truth.\n\n(Call for Papers) Historical literature – here framed as material composed before the twentieth century – represents a budding area of focus within current stylistics research. Building on long traditions established in literary criticism and historical pragmatics, this increasing engagement with historical style is observable in recent publications, collaborative research projects, and special events (such as the ‘In honour of Sylvia Adamson’ symposium at the University of Sheffield this past September). These efforts have produced dynamic and interdisciplinary research clusters oriented around prominent historical literary periods including Victorian and even Shakespearean literature. This symposium seeks to embrace this interest by providing a platform from which to explore the application (and adaptation) of stylistic tools and approaches to Old, Middle, and Early Modern English texts. Our focus on early English literatures underscores our wish to facilitate the more widespread analysis of medieval texts, as well as to further engage with the rapidly growing corpus of scholarship evidenced in the language of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. To this end, the symposium ultimately aims to promote the consideration of earlier historical material than generally addressed in conventional stylistic inquiry. This event also offers an opportunity for critical evaluation of these practices, promoting discussion of how to best integrate modern stylistic approaches with the textual requirements of (and features unique to) early literary genres. This has potential not only to significantly enhance our understanding of the literature being analysed (and the cultures that produced that literature), but also to help us refine our methods and ultimately broaden the scope of their utility. The symposium encourages more widespread consideration of these historical texts by exploring questions such as: • How does the temporal distance between discourse world and present-day audiences affect stylistic appreciation of these early texts? • How might these interpretative challenges be addressed with present tools and methods? • What changes can be made to our current stylistic methods to complement the unique character of these historical materials? • How does the stylistic analysis of early texts enhance our understanding of those texts, the cultures that produced them, and the diachronic development of human cognition? We invite abstracts for 15-minute presentations discussing any aspect of literary linguistics as applied to texts composed in Old, Middle, or Early Modern English. Submissions are welcome featuring methods and topics including, but not limited to: • Synchronic or diachronic approaches • Quantitative or qualitative analysis • Historical discourse analysis • Intertextuality • Narratology • Cognitive poetics • Corpus linguistics/stylistics • Non-digital topics and approaches (i.e. manuscripts) • Stylistics and translation • Characterization • Speech and thought presentation • Metaphor • Metre • Any other topic with stylistic impact and significance to the field\n\nThe terminology and the concepts used to define the post-folklore epic chronicle in this study are based on those developed in some of the papers studying Serbian and Croatian folklore. The terms folk song/singing (песма/ певање на народну), popular folk songs (народске песме), popular culture genres (пучка књижевност), wild literature and folklorism are critically analysed. The (re)definition of the field and the subject matter of folklore studies is also discussed, as well as the concepts tradition, folklore and community, among others. In this study, the term post-folklore (Neklyudov 1995) has been modified to exclude strict chronological determinants, and has been preferred to the term књижевност/literature (from the syntagm пучка књижевност/popular culture genres and књижевни фолклор/literary folklore), so as to transfer the analysed phenomena from the narrower framework of literary heritage into a much wider domain. In addition to gaining a wider framework, by doing this, a possible devaluation of this creative tradition and its bearers (and in a wider sense, the related culture) is avoided. In this work, post-folklore is defined as a polycentric phenomenon, associated with the tradition of social groups (and individual tradition). This shift in emphasis, moving folklore in a wider cultural context, led to a consideration of the research into mass media and popular culture, so as to account for the multitudinous available range of communicative codes and mo- dels, modes of existence, transmission and reception. Thus, in this monograph the term post-folklore covers a cultural, aesthetic, structural and stylistic complex understood in the widest possible sense, a complex which functions as the signifier for a type of culture and/or of a verbal text. Consequently, certain issues regarding the transmission and reception of a post-folklore text have also been analysed. This analysis considers the epic tradition spanning two centuries, with the traditional signing accompanied by the gusle, and places particular emphasis on 20th century transformations resulting from the institutionalisation of the tradition and the introduction of the gusle into the world of the music industry, mass media and popular culture. While presenting the genre of the post-folklore epic, an overview of its relationship with other genres is also given. One such relationship is that with panegyric literature, which includes the so-called pesme budnice (wake-up-call songs whose purpose is to galvanize the addressees into joining the fight for a cause), laments and mourning songs. This analysis of genre encompasses the structural, stylistic and ideological levels. Special attention is devoted to the positioning of epic chronicles and laments within the tradition of political satire and the pamphlet. During their development, historic and documentary laments remained in contact with the semantic fields and pragmatic functions of epic chronicles, reflecting political and historical events and public and political personalities. In this way, these chronicles are related to the heritage of political satire and the pamphlet, but also to the tradition which gave rise to wake-up-call songs. Epic chronicles also share common ground with the tradition of mourning: the similarity between these genres is evident not only at the level of concepts, but also at the level of function (character glorification and the codification of memory), and even at the level of minimal magical formulative structures (e.g. glorification formulae and the alternation of toasts and curses). Within this work, the pragmatic analysis of genre is directed at the role of the post-folklore epic chronicle in the construction of the cultural and communicative memory of a community. Examination of the temporal planes in an epic text reveals the processes through which history is compressed and the past is idealised. as such, ahistoricism becomes a basic aspect of the epic projection of reality. The epic is a genre which connects individual and political memory, thematising the official, but also forbidden and suppressed memories, “great” and “small” histories. The epic chronicle, whether traditional oral or post-folklore, is also the first step (or attempt) in the transferral of events and personalities from the domain of biography into the domain of the cultural memory of a community. Therefore, chronicled singing about events from the recent past is not common property (as it is sometimes deemed to be), but is subject to reflection, evaluation, re-evaluation and dispute. Polemical discourse surrounding the post-folklore chronicle is registered and analysed on several levels – as scientific discourse, as a representation of the views of the tradition bearers and as public discourse in which the epic survives on the crossroads between national cultural heritage and the heritage of compromise. This research into the discourse is then profiled in relation to anthropological discussions regarding the ideology of the tradition. The concept of the ideology of the tradition is complementary to the concept of language ideology which is developed within the framework of anthropological linguistics. Ideology of the tradition comprises the study of the complex of positions and attitudes that are formulated and expressed about tradition. This is why individual understandings of epic tradition(s), the place tradition occupies in the creation of individual and collective identities, but also the researcher’s place in the ideology of tradition are all problematized in this book."
