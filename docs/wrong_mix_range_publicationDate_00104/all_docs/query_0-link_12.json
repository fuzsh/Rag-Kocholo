During his twenty-two years in the capital city, he helped develop first the television distance learning initiative and then the English department’s online major and its writing courses. In 2016 he relocated to the Troy campus to oversee English offerings throughout the entire system. Thanks to his time in Montgomery, his research interests have focused on F. Scott Fitzgerald. For many years he served on the board of the Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum in Montgomery and since 2013 has served as the executive director of the international F. Scott Fitzgerald Society. He is the author of several works of fiction and criticism on not only Fitzgerald but Toni Morrison, William Faulkner, the 1970s, and popular music. He teaches both online and on the Troy campus, focusing on creative writing, American literature, senior seminar, and—finally, after many years of begging the music department to let him—the history of rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nTroy Campus Office: Smith Hall, Room 270 | Tel. 334-670-3308\n\nE-mail: kcurnutt@troy.edu | Web site: www.kirkcurnutt.com\n\nPatrick Bonds\n\nPh.D (LSU), M.Phil (Trinity College Dublin), M.A. (Univ. of New Orleans), B.A. (Baylor University)\n\nLecturer of English\n\nI joined the Department of English in 2010 and teach on the Troy campus.

Strategic Communication, (Troy University).\n\nWith Troy as an Academic Advisor since July 2019, I have been an adjunct faculty member for the JWS Center for Student Success since 2022 and the Troy University English Department since January 2023. Prior to TU, I taught multiple subjects, including English and writing, online as part of charter schools and ESL programs. That time period followed many years as an award-winning journalist, and work in other related fields. I am also a professional podcaster with listeners in 22 countries, and I executive produce for a podcasting/video production company in Auburn. I'm a self-published author and also edit and format books for others, in addition to freelancing as a journalist when the opportunity arises. Other than my passion for my students, teaching, and advising, scuba diving is my non-professional passion--any day under the surface is a great day!
