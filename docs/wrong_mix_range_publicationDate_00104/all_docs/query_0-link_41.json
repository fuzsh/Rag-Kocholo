        "text": "As the Star Wars series go, I'd probably rank this below Zahn and Tyers and on par with Wolverton's effort. It is a very readable and fast-paced series with the characters drawn pretty much true to form along with some entertaining additions (a droid named Q9, who acts like an arrogant cross between 3P0 and R2D2, is my favorite new character) and new species.\n\nThe story involves all the main characters converging on Han's home system of Corellia to try to negotiate some kind of new trade agreement to essentially bring the system into the New Republic fold unofficially (it being Han's home, of course, we run into a relative). There are some pit stops along the way (Luke and Lando's trip seemed rather unnecessary, given the foreshadowing build-up it was given in the first part of the first book, though I can appreciate the results and liked the subplot), but they aren't too distracting. The main plot remains as unpredictable as a story written with Star Wars limitations can be, but there are a few rough spots.\n\nOnce again, Han and Leia's Jedi children are more or less to perform feats well above and beyond the call of duty, which is not awful for me but a little absurd. Surely the series could've been set 5-6 years later just as easily, so the older children showing such skills would be credible. Of course, the fact that they are Jedi explains everything, I suppose, so this is a minor quibble.\n\nHan and Leia are both well-done here, though I have to admit that it is becoming increasingly difficult to accept the two of them continuing to be on the front lines in combat. Perhaps the SW authors need to agree to \"Kirk\" them like in the Star Trek movies...get them in some kind of trouble so that they are forced to accept positions of much less power and influence so they are free to stir up trouble like the good old days.\n\nAnyway, all of this baggage comes with the SW genre, and with that in mind, you won't go wrong with this series.\n\nI could just stick to the classic one-line review of this and say \"Lord of the Rings with global substitution,\" but I liked it a little more than that. Sword was a definite ripoff, but Elfstones/Wishsong had a little more originality, and I liked the story. I didn't like it enough to go back to the series later when newer books were released, though.\n\nSince I wrote the first paragraph of this review upon starting up my reviews page, I've gotten my share of unhappy mail from Brooks fans, so allow me a little time to clarify my opinion on this series: First, I *DID* enjoy Sword and Elfstones to some extent, but I can't deny that I was distracted to a large extent by the similarities between Sword and elements of LotR. I normally review books based upon my enjoyment alone, without giving pause to consider more abstract properties like \"literary merit\", but when the other qualities of a book infringe upon my enjoyment of the book, the review suffers. That happened here.\n\nWith that said, I would recommend Sword and Elfstones to younger readers who haven't had much exposure to the genre, but I would definitely *not* recommend it to serious Tolkien fans (i.e. if you've read anything by Tolkien more than once) of any age. If you enjoy Sword/Elfstones, then you'll also like Wishsong, though not as much as the first two.\n\nThe first four books of this series are a much more continuous sequence compared to the Ender series. This is a series set in the distant future in which Earth has been rendered uninhabitable by mankind, but a small foresighted part of society has apparently designed an artificial intelligence mechanism to disperse Earth's population to a variety of planets, each watched by an \"oversoul\" that monitors the civilization to ensure it never again acquires the ability to destroy itself.\n\nOn one of these worlds, Harmony, in the city of Basilica, the series begins as the oversoul of the world, after millions of years, begins to break down to such an extent that people are starting to overcome its desires, thus making war on a large scale and taking the first steps along the path to weapons of mass destruction. The series follows a group of humans selected by the oversoul to help it overcome its problems, perhaps by establishing communications with the master computer, the \"Keeper of Earth\".\n\nAs usual, Card has come up with a variety of very interesting ethical dilemmas, rather than your simple, everyday good vs evil story. While there is a focus on a central \"good\" character, Nafai, who brings back strong memories of Ender Wiggin, there are several good subplots and lots of space given to the development of other characters. The books are fairly fast-paced, and I found myself flying through the middle books of the series (whereas I've found with other long series, I tend to bog down near the middle).\n\nThe only weakness from my perspective is in the establishment of motivation for some characters. For example, a very important character in the first four books acts in an increasingly brutal and immoral fashion. This fact in and of itself doesn't bother me. Every series needs a good villain or two, but I had two problems. First, I didn't find the motivation for this character (essentially, jealousy and immaturity) to be very convincing over time. Second, I couldn't believe how much of his behavior was tolerated. I couldn't believe it was that important to everyone that this character remain as part of the group, given his potential to ruin everything.\n\nAnother minor problem with the series was the sheer number of characters. This wasn't a problem at the beginning, even though there were a lot of names to digest from the very first page. But as the series went on and new generations of characters were introduced, I found them melting together. Very few of the second-and-beyond generation characters were established well enough for their names to be memorable. This was especially a problem for all but 2-3 characters in the final book, which takes place long after the continuous events of the first four books. I would almost recommend reading only the first four books of this series, which make a great self-contained set and leave few plot threads hanging.\n\nIn any case, I liked this series too much to end a review with two paragraphs of criticism, so I'd like to reiterate the strengths that I've come to expect from Card. First were the excellent ethical dilemmas presented (even though I may not agree with how they were dealt with). Second was the fast-paced plot. There is an interesting religious subtext throughout the series as well, which wasn't surprising for Card. This added a lot to the richness of the characters, but to say more would be to bias the reader to watch for certain things. I think that's best left to be discovered.\n\nThis series revolves around a very interesting premise: a powerful political figure dies, but the science of genetic (and social) engineering is so advanced that she can be cloned and brought up again from childhood in a carefully controlled environment (because her allies want to effectively reproduce their leader and enable her to inherit her predecessor's power). This story is set in the future on a distant human colony that is at the center of political controversy, but to be honest, I was so interested in the basic premise that I felt the vast majority of the political intrigue in the book was a waste of space.\n\nThe strongest element of the plot comes in the second book when the young Ariane Emory is \"introduced\" to an archive of computer programs and tapes created by her predecessor. I find it fascinating to think about the concept of actually \"visiting yourself in the past\" and giving yourself advice about growing up and so forth. If the entire series had been boiled down to one book, throwing out the purely political subplots and concentrating more on the relationship between Ariane and her predecessor, it would've been a \"9\" or a \"10\". As written, though, the series seems to drag and I had trouble slogging through a lot of it. The ending was extremely disappointing and left too many loose ends (perhaps this was on purpose, I'm not sure). I can't say I would recommend this to everyone, but it wasn't bad. The good ideas were just diluted by too much unnecessary extraneous activity (and too many characters) outside Ariane's immediate circle."
