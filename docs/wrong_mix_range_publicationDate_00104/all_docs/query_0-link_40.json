        "text": "With the rapid rise of electronic media, it was once feared that books might lose their relevance and audience. Not so, says Clay Smith, San Antonio Book Festival literary director.\n\nIn a news release announcing the 2019 lineup of more than 100 festival authors, Smith is quoted saying, “Readers have been grappling in the past year with the ways the world is rapidly changing and book sales reflect their desire to know more.”\n\nThe Book Festival will take its place at the Central Library and Southwest School of Art on April 6 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with a slate of lively discussions, book signings, food trucks, and plentiful activities for kids.\n\nThe news release touts nationally recognized authors Tayari Jones, whose novel An American Marriage was a featured pick for Oprah’s Book Club 2.0 last March, along with Meg Medina, who won a John Newbery Medal in January for her young adult novel Merci Suárez Changes Gears.\n\nFans of nonfiction will look forward to appearances by Susan Page, USA Today Washington bureau chief; historian Douglas Brinkley; and for the lighter side of the menu, Alabama native Rick Bragg, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Best Cook in the World: Tales from My Momma’s Table.\n\nSan Antonio will be well represented by two figures who have literally shaped its landscape, Lila Cockrell and Nelson Wolff. Both released books in 2019 charting their roles in the city’s history: Love Deeper Than a River: My Life in San Antonio by Cockrell and The Changing Face of San Antonio: An Insider’s View of an Emerging International City by Wolff.\n\nOther locals include Natalia Treviño, poet and Macondo Writers Workshop director, who will represent her new volume of poems VirginX, and prolific author David Bowles, who will lead a lighthearted, slightly haunted event based on his 2016 book Ghosts of the Rio Grande Valley.\n\n“He’s a good performer,” Smith said of Bowles.\n\nSmith emphasized the festival’s goal of reflecting local and regional culture, adding “in a year when readers are flocking to weighty nonfiction about trenchant political or cultural issues, we want to program some fun events as well.”\n\nNotable Texas author Lawrence Wright will present God Save Texas: A Journey Into the Soul of the Lone Star State, which scrutinizes manifold stereotypes of the once-republic, and Ojibwe author David Treuer will discuss The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America from 1890 to the Present, which presents “a compelling counternarrative to popular U.S. history,” according to BookReads.\n\nFurther information is available on the festival’s website, to be updated as the event dates approach. Several special events surround the one-day festival, including a fundraiser on April 5, the popular live literature event The Moth later that day (tickets go on sale Feb. 22 on the Majestic Theatre website), a special BookIt! author luncheons at Club Giraud on April 6, and a new GET LIT with Susan Page event on April 7 at Trinity University.\n\nThe full author lineup for the 2019 San Antonio Book Festival, with author names and featured titles, is listed below:\n\nCamille Acker (Training School for Negro Girls)\n\nReniqua Allen (It Was All A Dream: A New Generation Confronts the Broken Promise to Black America)\n\nCristela Alonzo (Untitled Memoir)\n\nLaurie Halse Anderson (Shout)\n\nJulissa Arce (Someone Like Me: How One Undocumented Girl Fought for Her American Dream)\n\nChris Barton (What Do You Do with a Voice Like That?: The Story of Extraordinary Congresswoman Barbara Jordan)\n\nSarah Bird (Daughter of a Daughter of a Queen)\n\nAaron Bobrow-Strain (The Death and Life of Aida Hernandez: A Border Story)\n\nDavid Bowles (They Call Me Güero: A Border Kid’s Poems; Ghosts of the Rio Grande Valley)\n\nRick Bragg (The Best Cook in the World: Tales from My Momma’s Table)\n\nH.W.
