        "text": "Lineup includes Cecile Richards, JuliÃ¡n Castro, + 280 more\n\nFall just got a little closer, readers, not in a meteorological sense but a literary one. The Texas Book Festival has released the full list of authors for its 2018 event, and you can look forward to more than 280 great guests to attend, among them Cecile Richards, JuliÃ¡n Castro, Susan Orlean, and Dessa.\n\nThe Lone Star State's annual bibliophilic extravaganza is set for Sat., Oct 27 and Sun., Oct. 28 on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol and environs, and you can expect the authors to cover almost every kind of book people read.\n\nGuests run the gamut from fiction writers such as Texas literary treasure Sandra Cisneros (she's written and illustrated her short story Pura Amor), Walter Mosley (the latest from the creator of Easy Rawlins is John Woman), and Tommy Orange (author of the widely praised new novel There There) to journalists such as The Orchid Thief writer Susan Orlean (covering the 1986 L.A. Public Library fire in The Library Book) and Pulitzer Prize winner Jose Antonio Vargas (here with his memoir Dear America; Notes of an Undocumented Citizen). Ben Fountain, familiar to many as a novelist from the National Book Criticsâ Circle Award winner Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, will have his reporter's hat on for his new nonfiction book Beautiful Country Burn Again, a look back at the incendiary 2016. Comedian Phoebe Robinson of 2 Dope Queens will discuss her essay collection Everything's Trash, But It's Okay, while NASA astronaut Scott Kelly will tell tales of his year off-planet from Endurance: A Year in Space, a Lifetime of Discovery. Longtime Planned Parenthood leader Cecile Richards has a down-to-Earth story to tell in Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the Courage to Lead â My Life Story, and rapper/essayist Dessa brings home tales from her travels in My Own Devices: True Stories From the Road on Music, Science, and Senseless Love.\n\nFormer San Antonio mayor and Obama-era HUD Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro will be talking about his An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up From My American Dream, one of several titles looking at immigration issues and playing off the idea of the American Dream. (See also Lauren Hilgers' Patriot Number One: American Dreams in Chinatown, Laura Wides-MuÃ±oz's The Making of a Dream: How a Group of Young Undocumented Immigrants Helped Change What It Means to Be American, Julissa Arce's Someone Like Me: How One Undocumented Girl Fought for Her American Dream, and Bryan Mealer's The Kings of Big Spring: God, Oil, and One Family's Search for the American Dream, plus the previously mentioned Dear America, Fey Berman's Mexamerica: Una Cultura Naciendo, Alfredo Corchado's Homelands: Four Friends, Two Countries, and the Fate of the Great Mexican-American Migration, and Stephanie Elizondo Griest's All the Agents and Saints: Dispatches From the U.S. Borderlands.\n\nAnd that's not even taking into account the authors of memoirs, cookbooks, YA novels, political books, children's books, music books, art books, and so much more.\n\nThe 2018 TBF will launch, as usual, with the First Edition Literary Gala, held this year on Fri., Oct. 26, at the Four Seasons Hotel. Tapped to present will be presidential historian Michael Beschloss (Presidents of War), New York Times bestselling author Celeste Ng (Little Fires Everywhere), award-winning essayist Luis Alberto Urrea (The House of Broken Angels), and National Ambassador for Young Peopleâs Literature Jacqueline Woodson (Harbor Me). Jake Silverstein, writer and New York Times Magazine editor-in-chief, will emcee.\n\nFor more information on the Texas Book Festival, please visit www.texasbookfestival.org.\n\nAnd now for the full list of authors:\n\nAdult Fiction\n\nJeffrey Abbott â The Three Beths\n\nHeather Abel â The Optimistic Decade\n\nNana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah â Friday Black\n\nRumaan Alam â That Kind of Mother\n\nXhenet Aliu â Brass\n\nChloe Benjamin â The Immortalists\n\nLou Berney â November Road\n\nChaya Bhuvaneswar â White Dancing Elephants\n\nSarah Bird â Daughter of a Daughter of a Queen\n\nDavid Bowles â Feathered Serpent, Dark Heart of Sky: Myths of Mexico\n\nMargaret Bradham Thornton â A Theory of Love\n\nJamel Brinkley â A Lucky Man: Stories\n\nRita Bullwinkel â Belly Up: Stories\n\nEdward Carey â Little\n\nElaine Castillo â America Is Not the Heart\n\nAdrienne Celt â Invitation to a Bonfire\n\nSandra Cisneros â Pura Amor\n\nAlyssa Cole â A Duke by Default\n\nNaima Coster â Halsey Street\n\nElizabeth Crook â The Which Way Tree\n\nJennifer Donaldson â Lies You Never Told Me\n\nAja Gabel â The Ensemble\n\nMeg Gardiner â Into the Black Nowhere\n\nJasmine Guillory â The Wedding Date\n\nLouisa Hall â Trinity\n\nJulia Heaberlin â Paper Ghosts: A Novel of Suspense\n\nRachel Heng â Suicide Club: A Novel About Living\n\nDebra Jo Immergut â The Captives\n\nShelley Jackson â Riddance, or The Sybil Joines Vocational School for Ghost Speakers and Hearing-Mouth Children\n\nChelsey Johnson â Stray City\n\nCaleb Johnson â Treeborne\n\nTayari Jones â An American Marriage\n\nSophie Jordan â Beautiful Sinner: A Devil's Rock Novel\n\nJack Kaulfus â Tomorrow or Forever & Other Stories\n\nR.O.
