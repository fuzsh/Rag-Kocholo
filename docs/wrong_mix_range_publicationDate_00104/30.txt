Hello awesome nerds and happy Thursday everyone! üßÅ

With summertime slowly coming to an end, I felt this need to rewatch one of my absolute favourite TV series, and that is of course Gilmore Girls. ‚òïÔ∏èüß°üçÇ

Although I feel pretty upset right now, as I‚Äôm currently watching the third season and I was never a Team Jess person, still, this gazillionth rewatch of mine reminded me that there are 339 books referenced in the series, and today I‚Äôm here to share with you Rory‚Äôs reading list.

A bookworm can never have too many books, right?

Naturally, I don‚Äôt expect you to read every single one of these books, but this list will hopefully give you (and me) and excuse to check what we have read, and what we haven‚Äôt.

Here we go then‚Ä¶
