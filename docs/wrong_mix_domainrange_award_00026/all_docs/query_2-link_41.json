        "text": "In the next few years, I’d like to read at least one work by each Nobel laureate in literature and write a short reflection on my reading. I have already read works by a few of them. Depending on how well I remember those books, I may either re-read them or write reflections now about works I read a while ago.\n\nI’m not doing this project because I think the Nobel prize winners wrote the best literature of the last 110 years, which I’m sure they didn’t, but because I think it will be an interesting trip through literary history. I read a fair amount, but the majority is from the perspective of English speakers, usually from the US, and with a bias towards newer works. I think that reading Nobel laureates will help me broaden my literary experience, especially in the northern European direction, and might help me understand some of the controversy surrounding some of the choices.\n\nI don’t have a systematic plan for what order I’ll be going in. I’ll just read whatever is available and appeals to me at a particular time. And I’m not going to confine all my reading to Nobel laureates. I’ll probably read a few other books in between each one of these. If I read a Nobel book a month, it’ll take roughly 10 years to finish this, but I might try to read them a bit faster than that. As I read and write, I’ll post links to my reflections on this page. I’ll also update the list of laureates as more are added."
