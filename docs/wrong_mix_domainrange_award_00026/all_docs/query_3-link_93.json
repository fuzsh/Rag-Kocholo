        "text": "Using the Nobel Prize as a prism through which to view the life and literature of a difficult-to-define artist, this article argues that Dylan’s output is one in which life and literature become, and have always been, indistinguishable. It is the life which has made the literature, through years lived in a particular niche of 1960s counter-cultural history; the lyrics gave voice to a man who was never at ease in the formalities of interview. For a supposed spokesman of a generation Dylan spoke very little except through his songs. So too in the more difficult-to-define later decades, little of his life was spoken of except through song, and some samplings of autobiography. Detailing the historically distinctive features of the Nobel Prize, the article shows how Bob Dylan has, through life and literature, broken down the boundaries between the literary and the popular. The article’s title is drawn, of course, from a famous line in Bob Dylan’s era-defining “Like a Rolling Stone,” one ...\n\nReading the Nobel Prize Lectures delivered by Polish Nobel laureates in literature from 1905 to 2019 as one mutually influencing narrative (the so-called \"collective narrative\") clearly suggests the changing direction of how Polish writers perceive the world, Poland, and the social obligations of literature towards humanity. The early focus on Poland's loss of independence and the injustice of fate (Henryk Sienkiewicz) gave way to seeing the entire world as a unity (Wisława Szymborska, Czesław Miłosz, Olga Tokarczuk). The mutually exclusive participation in life and being a detached observer. although seen as an insolvable contradiction (Miłosz) is acknowledged. but now with the urgent need for an engagement with the world's fate (Szymbo-rska, Tokarczuk). Literature is seen as a vehicle for painful memory and the acknowledgment of the injustices of the twentieth century (Miłosz), a tool of analysis of the human and non-human condition in general (Szymborska), and as a way of telling stories that represents the only remaining path to universal human understanding and bond (Tokarczuk). For Tokarczuk, \"the tender narrator\" represents the powerful connection necessary for searching I would like to thank those without whose help this article could not be written as I worked on it during the coronavirus pandemic, in almost completely locked-down London (first lockdown) and edited it during the third lockdown. Thus, my gratitude for providing me with suggestions, quotes, copies, photos, and PDFs of texts and books that are not accessible online to,\n\nWe briefly discuss a letter written by physicist of German origin Albert Einstein (1879-1955) to the Norwegian Nobel Committee nominating the Brazilian military officer, geographer, explorer and peacemaker Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon (1865-1958). Einstein nominated other eleven scientists, and all them were Nobel Prizes laureates. We also examine and discuss the Nobel Peace Prize Nominators and Nominees from 1901 to 1964. Just taking into account data up to the year of the Nobel Prize, the highest number of nominations was awarded to an organization, the Permanent International Peace Bureau in 1910, with a total of 103 nominations, followed by two women: Bertha von Suttner (101 nominations, 1905) and Jane Addams (91 nominations, 1931). Data show that the average number of nominations per Nobel Prize awarded was 17.7, and only 18 of the total 62 laureates exceed this average. At the other extreme there were often prizewinners who had just zero, one, two or three nominations-a highly subjective indicator. We also verified that there were at least 25 nominations by National Parliaments, there were determinants for some winners. Considering the results presented, it is possible to affirm that Rondon received sufficient nominations to be awarded the Nobel Prize, even not considering Einstein's letter.\n\nIntersectionality describes overlapping or intersecting social identities and related systems of oppression, like gender, sex, race, ethnicity, class, age, religion, etc. It is discussed in various disciplines and therefore often used in inter-/transdisciplinary research. Recently, intersectional theory has found its way into literary studies; especially narratology, dealing with the structure and function of narrative, has expressed interest in an intersectional approach (Klein and Schnicke 2014). However, Euro- and androcentric presuppositions in literary studies are also an issue on a more structural level. As Hill Collins and Chepp (2013) argue, the attractiveness and influence of intersectionality often stems from an “epistemological recognition that a field’s dominant assumptions and paradigms are produced within a context of power relations, where white, middle-class, heterosexual, male, able-bodied experiences are taken as the (invisible) norm” (p. 64–65). Accordingly, feminist, queer, and postcolonial literary critics and activists have demonstrated during the past few decades that neither the literary market nor literary studies are free of class, ethnic, gender, national, racial, and other prejudices. This attendance to the problem of recognition helped to clarify and address the structures that render people who deviate from the white, male, middle-class, heterosexual etc. norm invisible. As comparison is quite a common method to reveal such existing inequalities, the relative unpopularity of intersectional theory within comparative literature and cultural studies comes as a surprise; especially since its scholars traditionally move between a number of philological as well as cultural areas and, thus, call the suspenseful field of (in)commensurabilities their very own territory. In times of ever-increasing globalization and transnational connectedness, world literature studies have proven to be one particularly contentious field, within which the question why (not) compare (cf. Radhakrishnan; Friedman) – ultimately, a question of power – is lively debated. Some researchers even proclaim a “new world literature” (Löffler 2014; Sturm-Trigonakis 2007) which clearly differs from the old canonical concept and its reputation of being “a white male affair in large part” (Damrosch 2003, p. 16; paraphrasing Guillory 1993, p. 32). Whiteness respectively race/ethnicity and gender stand out as the central markers of inequality. Based on a number of influential agents in the literary market, or what I call the outer gatekeepers (e.g. publishers, literary criticism, literary prizes), who also (re)produce certain mindsets, which I refer to as inner gatekeepers , I am going to explore to what extent Euro- and Androcentrism are still present in current world literature discourses. In other words: if white men dominate the “old” world literature, is the “new” world literature by implication a “black female affair”?"
