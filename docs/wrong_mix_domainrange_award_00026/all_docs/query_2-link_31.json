        "text": "SYMPOSIUM\n\nDid Bob Dylan deserve to win the Nobel Prize in Literature?\n\nAdrian Matejka\n\nDo You Love Your Monkey or Do You Love Me?: An Incomplete Personal History of Calling Songwriters “Poets”\n\nWhen I was in high school, my overworked English teacher Mrs. Jones decided the best way to introduce our group of apathetic, jean-jacketed sixteen-year-olds to poetry was through song lyrics. One Monday, she told the twenty-three faces yawning in her direction that we had the opportunity to transcribe the lyrics of our favorite song from the liner notes of an LP (it was 1988) and submit them to her for consideration to be part of our class discussion about poetry. She would then decide which of the submitted lyrics would be the most “apropos” to use in our class conversation.\n\nThe real lesson, as she explained it, was something like “using song lyrics to discover the sophisticated uses for metaphor and rhyme, which are the foundations of poetry.” She kept going on about the beauty of words and how language works just like music if music were made out of letters, and when she finally finished with blah blah blah metaphor blah blah blah arti> blah “you can bring in whatever lyrics you want,” we were no longer yawning and slouching. We were straight up and down in our desks, and we were all about English class.\n\nThe next day, a classmate with a large Adam’s apple and a mullet presented Mrs. Jones with a mimeograph of the lyrics from the Run DMC and Aerosmith partnership, “Walk This Way.” “It’s rock and rap,” he said. Another longhair brought in Black Sabbath’s “Crazy Train” while offering the hand-written lyrics in his right hand and presenting his left fist to the teacher so she could see that “OZZY” was printed in ballpoint pen on his knuckles. My backcourt mate on the basketball team typed up Public Enemy’s “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos.” Three of us put up power fists while he turned it in.\n\nThe girl I had a crush on handed in Guy’s “Groove Me”—which was the same song I brought in—and I almost lost my mind imagining our future peg-legged, New Jack romance. “I brought that song, too,” I told her. “You want to come over after school and listen to the album?” She didn’t even turn her gold bangle earrings and beauty mark in my direction, ignoring me the same way she ignored me for the next two years because she wanted “a man with prospects.”\n\nSome dude whose name I don’t remember brought in GN’R’s “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” and he might have been the most in tune with Mrs. Jones’s agenda of us all. The lyrics aren’t good, but they are influential thanks to the combination of demonstrative language and the music behind it. “Where do we go? Where do we go now?” Axl Rose growls like he is the line of demarcation between the parents and children at the tail end of the Reagan era. In the end, the teacher chose George Michael’s song “Monkey” from his multi-platinum album Faith. The chorus of the song goes:\n\nWhy can’t you do it?\n\nWhy can’t you set your monkey free?\n\nAlways giving into it\n\nDo you love your monkey or do you love me?\n\nMrs. Jones explained that this was a metaphor for obsessions and the rhyme of “free” and “me” was really a subliminal message that recast the great Funkadelic credo, “Free your mind and your ass will follow.” Of course she couldn’t say “ass” in a room full of tenth graders and probably never listened to Funkadelic. And of course, the whole class was about to crack up because in suburban Indianapolis slang, the word “monkey” was a nom de guerre for either sex or sexual parts. We couldn’t decide which because we had no direct knowledge of either yet.\n\nStill, Mrs. Jones was on to something. The extended metaphor of George Michael’s lyrics, the whole thing about loving your monkey more than X, resonated in our knuckled heads. Whether you’re Bubbles the Chimp or a guy in the GN’R T-shirt holding out the bouquet of flowers to the turned back of a woman, you need freedom and permission and obsession to be in love.\n\nWhich brings me to Bob Dylan. Had my tenth grade class somehow transported back to 1965 and our newly striped and bell bottomed, big heel wearing teacher (who would have told us to call her “Roberta” instead of “Mrs. Jones”) asked us to bring in song lyrics, someone would have come in with a transcription of Dylan’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues.” “This is real poetry” they would say like so many others have said about Dylan’s work. And they would have been right as long as what constitutes poetry is, to quote The Dude, “just like, your opinion, man.”\n\nHowever we try to classify it—poetry, song, both, or neither— “Subterranean Homesick Blues” is a revelation, as is all of the songwriting on Bringing It All Back Home. And to bolster the person advocating for Dylan as poet, the song doesn’t even have a chorus. It has a refrain like a poem: “Look out kid” followed by some warning about what’s to come. Just like a poet, Dylan communicates, appraises, and worries with the best of them.\n\nBut Dylan is not a poet any more than George Michael is a poet. Bob Dylan is a wordsmith with gorgeous backing rhythms, and he often uses the same tools we poets use. There is a reason teachers use his lyrics in the classroom. In the conversation of “please bring your favorite song lyrics to class so we can talk about poetry,” Dylan certainly has a seat at the long table. Bob Marley, Joni Mitchell, Stevie Wonder, Leonard Cohen, and Nina Simone are maybe closer to the head in my arrangement, but he is definitely there.\n\nIt is the job of the poet to weave music out of words and imagined rhythms. If you take the music away and make those drum snares imaginary, most of Dylan’s language folds up under its own weight. It’s not a bad thing that he’s not a poet in the truest sense. It’s safe to say that Bob Dylan made more money yesterday sitting in his slippers and reading the paper than all of the poets combined made reciting their poems in coffee shops, classrooms, and protests in the last seven years.\n\nSo when I heard Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel in Literature, my first thought wasn’t of him or the jilted poetry smiths in their high back chairs all over the world wanting to break into blossom. It was of exhausted Mrs. Jones and her English lesson. It feels like the Nobel committee had its own Monday, 8 a.m. moment and was trying to convince a world full of frustrated and pinch-faced consumers—some of whom really want it to be 1965 again—that, hey, it is still 1965 as far as our Nobel committee is concerned. At least we can show some love to Bob Dylan and pretend things haven’t gone so sideways in the last fifty years that we ended up with a game show host as president. Besides, if we call Bob Dylan a poet, maybe poetry will still matter to those who aren’t inclined to pick up a book. Or maybe the committee was just too lazy to learn about some of the brilliant poets (check into Yusef Komunyakaa please, committee) whose work transcends the page in our midst. The ones who don’t need backup singers and tambourines to make the audience understand the metaphor.\n\nRobert Zaller\n\nIf Bob Dylan’s a Writer, Who’s This Guy Shakespeare?\n\nFirst question to the house: What’s the use of prizes? I know what the Academy Awards are about: they’re Hollywood publicizing itself. The same can pretty much be said of any other prize competition; at best it’s a harmless parlor game; more often it’s simply a form of politicking or self-promotion; sometimes it’s a joke and occasionally a menace. In giving the Nobel Prize in Literature to Bob Dylan, the Swedish Academy has tipped into the third category, where it’s often been before, and entered the fourth. Literature is in bad enough trouble in the age of Twitter. It doesn’t need to be stood completely on its head by the Scandinavian boneheads.\n\nFirst, let’s dispense with the Nobels themselves. The idea of, say, giving a Most Valuable Player award in baseball has at least the merit of a statistical foundation. There is no way to discriminate in literature, or the arts generally, except by taste, and the consensus that taste occasionally reaches about relative degrees of merit. But taste, even at its most cultivated, has a notoriously labile relationship to value, and the best any award—or any canon—can represent is the snapshot of a particular present.\n\nBy that standard, the Swedish camera has veered in some very odd directions. Among the recipients of the Nobel in Literature have been such stellar names as Sully Prudhomme, Verner von Heidenstam, Karl Anton Gjellerup, and Henrik Pontoppidan, not to mention more recent notables including the court jester Dario Fo or the unreadable Elfriede Jelinek. Among the Academy’s omissions: Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, Thomas Hardy, Marcel Proust, Paul Valéry, Rainer Maria Rilke, Robert Musil, Franz Kafka, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges, and Vladimir Nabokov. That’s virtually a Who’s Who of twentieth-century Western literature, at least as most informed judgment would define it, assuming such a list to be useful.\n\nIt’s one thing to overlook a genius and choose a duffer, however, and another to make a selection that questions the nature, values, and boundaries of literature itself. Of course, the avant-garde of the past century and a half has been precisely about testing such boundaries in all the arts. But literature is irreducibly tied to language and the meanings it can generate, and those meanings in turn to the force, elegance, and novelty by which they are expressed. Here is a not unrepresentative sample of Bob Dylan, from “Bringing It All Back Home”: When preachers preach of evil fates Teachers teach that knowledge waits Disillusioned words like bullets bark One hardly knows where to begin with language of such flatness, banality, and subliteracy; it destroys all possibility of meaning. Really, Bob? Words become “disillusioned,” which makes of them “bullets” that somehow “bark”? Maybe what you’re trying to say is that words that have become expressively empty—you know, like the clichés you’re so fond of using—lend themselves to abuse as propaganda, which impose themselves on us as a dull, imperative repetition, like dogs barking? Oh, but I forgot, it’s the “bullets” they’ve become that somehow bark. . . . These words, in this arrangement, do not express but preclude meaning, and the labor of trying to induce meaning into them is a futile business, as anyone who’s ever tried to correct a really bad student paper knows.\n\nAh, but these are, after all, song lyrics, not meant to be dissected in themselves but experienced in the expressive whole of music and vocalization. This was precisely the argument made by the Swedish Academy, invoking the ghost of—God save the mark—Homer. We don’t know how Homer sang, but we do know what he sang, and, sorry, the sow’s ear of Dylan’s lyrics isn’t turned into a silk purse by a rasping voice and mediocre strumming.\n\nI know there are critics, such as Christopher Ricks, who profess to find arcane virtues in Dylan worthy of comparison with Shelley and Yeats (and may their ghosts rest). There’s no accounting, after all, for at least some taste. I know, too, that there have been writers, perennially disappointed at the Nobel altar, who have rushed to praise the Academy’s choice as bold and refreshing; but then, we have also been witnessing the spectacle of Republican bigwigs making their pilgrimage to Trump Tower after denouncing its owner as a demagogic fraud.\n\nThe issue, then, isn’t Bob Dylan’s worthiness for recognition as a literary figure, a proposition I find ridiculous to entertain. It’s the power of self-anointed nonentities in a remote corner of the republic of letters, none with a reputation of his or her own, to set themselves up as a supreme court of literary value. We’ve humored them long enough. The best response we can make to their annual charade, for as long as it continues, is to ignore it. Dylan himself, to his credit, has essentially done this. It’s one thing, anyway, to praise.\n\nKatie Moulton\n\nStuck Inside of Nobel with the Memphis Blues Again\n\nMy mother doesn’t read much, but she listens to Bob Dylan.\n\nShe got Dylan from her older brother, who worked on cars. She gave Dylan to my father, the heady, stoned young man who loved Chaucer and Tom Robbins and Hendrix. That my upbringing would be steeped in Dylanology was never a question.\n\nWhen I was ten, Mama—who’s never known which books to buy me—took me to my first Dylan show in a small arena in Terre Haute, Indiana. Since then we’ve seen Bob in once-grand theaters, college auditoriums, and three times at a Triple-A ballpark in East St. Louis. Mama is a woman dug deep in the day-to-day, not one for too much solitude or contemplation. Yet I’ve watched her sway in reverie to Dylan, mouthing lines like “My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drum . . .”\n\nNow tell me that’s not American literature.\n\nAs a music critic and writer, I meet people from both industries. The distance between these spheres can seem vast—writers talk more and drink harder, musicians look better in leather and dirty hair—but not for lack of mutual interest. Many musicians idolize writers, and most writers wish they were musicians (just duck into any karaoke room near AWP). Yet when Dylan won the Nobel Prize in Literature this year, many writers reacted with indignation. I get it. If the Nobel honoree was determined by the artist’s contributions to literature today, the prize should have gone to someone like Zadie Smith, for example. Claudia Rankine. Ta-Nehisi Coates. Personally, I would vote for a collective Nobel awarded to Beyoncé and all the young poets writing about her, because that would signal that the committee recognizes the collaborative, pluralistic world we’re moving toward. There are a hundred others who aren’t cis-male, heterosexual septuagenarians who spent the last two decades tinkering with the so-called Great American Songbook and performing like lounge lizards in Night Vale.\n\nThere’s no arguing that Dylan’s influence is everywhere in modern literature. He did what they say he did: “created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” But Dylan shouldn’t have won the 2016 Nobel for going electric. Nor for his character-driven polemics that energized white allies during the ’60s Civil Rights movement. Nor for his jumbled literary references, nor his formal and thematic innovating of Homer and Ovid. The only reason I’m cool with Dylan as Nobel Laureate is because he continues to disrupt his own legacy in pursuit of the work.\n\nDylan has been on the road non-stop for almost thirty years, doggedly reinventing his songs on stage. In the 1980s, he adopted an “odd-numeric value system” to re-enter and re-create his songs. In Chronicles: Volume One, he described the approach: “With any type of imagination you can hit notes at intervals and between backbeats, creating counterpoint lines. . . . The listener would recognize and feel the dynamics immediately. Things could explode or retreat back at any time and there would be no way to predict the consciousness of any song.” Nowadays, if he plays an old hit, he still changes the tempo, instrumentation, vocal phrasing, even lyrics. No matter how precious certain lines or recordings are to the listener, Dylan takes them apart. It’s not to be contrary—well, not just that—but destruction as a means of creation. His songs may be monuments, but the man has never allowed himself to be.\n\nOnce I interviewed the young British folk singer and actor Johnny Flynn for the Village Voice about the time he met his idol. “I looked up, and there was Bob Dylan coming toward me, in a wooly hat and long gloves,” Flynn said. “Actually, I bowed a bit to him as if he were a Japanese sensei. It was some kind of initiation, a rite of passage.”\n\nThat’s how most stories about unexpected encounters with Dylan go: He appears, looking bedraggled and asking if you’ve got a car in Indiana or if your house is for sale in Jersey. He deals in irony, subverts a dark lyric with a melodic uplift, and dismantles expectation. Dylan is less a sensei, as Flynn put it, than a fellow student, committed to exploration of his own wild hairs. As New Yorker critic Alex Ross wrote, “Stubborn persistence is his main characteristic: although he has often vanished . . . he never fails to trudge back with some new twist on his obsessions.”\n\nIf poetry is found in how form relates to content, lasting literature is found in how audience relates to the work. When reviewing a show, I often watch the crowd. I’m not interested in whether the artist fits the pedestal but in how the music exists in the world, the relationships that listeners forge with the art. For example, the question of whether Dylan qualifies to be Nobel Laureate doesn’t matter to Mama. (To hear him tell it, it doesn’t matter much to Dylan either.)\n\nLast summer at Red Rocks, I listened as Dylan gravel-crooned his way through a pedal-steel-infused Frank Sinatra cover. Then he swung into a spoken-word ramble over a laid-back, jazzy bed—which we eventually realized was “Tangled Up in Blue.” Fans got to their feet, and the original Blood on the Tracks tune was playing in my head, even as Dylan rasp-rapped Taaangled UPinbluuue—a palimpsest of song and histories—and damned if I didn’t hear something new.\n\nAs artists, readers, and citizens, we could take a cue from Dylan’s stubbornness. His intrepidness in meeting America on the ground, in its Triple-A ballparks and graveyards. His dedication to moving forward, his resistance to sliding into the tyranny of self-parody.\n\nAs a writer, I aim for essays that launch like Springsteen songs. I hope to channel Beyoncé’s fierce control and expansion of her craft. I dream of writing an epiphanic moment that breaks open like Merry Clayton’s voice in “Gimme Shelter.” Most of all, I wish for the courage to deconstruct my own work, these materials we’re given, the way that Dylan does. Let’s not constantly question whether our work is worthy of accolades or even rates as literature—let us be too damned busy making, sharing, and listening.\n\nAndrew Weinstein\n\nShould the pop singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, as great and influential as he is, have won the Nobel Prize for Literature? The question makes me uneasy. Say no and I suddenly see myself as some cultural conservative, which would put me on the wrong side of history. I’d find myself with Stephen Metcalf of Slate in the awkward position of having to defend the antiquated Modernist dogma that text, to be pure and true, must first be unadulterated by music or anything else. I’d have to endorse an archly problematic high/low cultural divide like the Telegraph’s Tim Stanley, who blames lowbrow thinking for the Nobel pick as well as the Trump phenomenon. Bound to fixed definitions of what art used to be, I’d face the unhappy prospect of having to marry the past rather than flirt with ever-evolving conceptions of art, which, as history shows, can be anything, anything.\n\nTo figure out my answer to the Dylan question, I’ve plodded through a lot of media reaction from mid-October, when Sara Darius of the Swedish Academy announced the controversial choice. It meant, of course, passing over literary heavyweights like Philip Roth, Don DeLillo, Adonis, and Haruki Murakami. Maybe that’s why Darius defended the decision by invoking Homer and Sappho as Dylan’s forebears in joining words with music. Following her lead, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone compared Dylan to Shakespeare for his lifelong commitment to popular performance that had left no time for him to worry about literary aspirations. (With more humility, Dylan made much the same case in the acceptance speech he sent to Stockholm.) New York Times critic Dwight Garner ranked him alongside Whitman and Dickinson as “an authentic American voice.” For his part, Bloomberg View’s Cass R. Sunstein argued that Dylan “surpassed” Whitman as “the defining American artist, celebrating the capacity for self-invention as the highest form of freedom,” then quoted Dylan: “he not busy being born is busy dying.”\n\nA different Dylan line resonated with me this fall: “the times they are a-changing.” Darius quoted it in her post-announcement remarks, and a lot of critics did, too, either in exasperation or delight. With its enormous cultural authority and in one go, the Swedish Academy broadened the definition of literature: “It’s not just your grandfather’s novels anymore,” declared the Dylan scholar David Gaines, sounding cavalier and sexist. But in sizing up traditional notions of literature as old-fashioned, he has a point. We all know the general public hardly buys or reads literary books the way it used to. Only when an author gets the sort of big-time attention the Nobel bestows does that larger public seem to notice or care. Anna North of the New York Times put it this way: “Bob Dylan does not need a Nobel Prize in Literature, but literature needs a Nobel Prize.”\n\nHere’s a question: did the Nobel Prize for Literature need Bob Dylan? Did its minders hope to spare the prize from an increasingly compromised association with nothing but old-fashioned literature by choosing a singer-songwriter and a cool countercultural hipster at that? In turn, some of Dylan’s fans probably think less of him for getting his stuffy Nobel. Probably his delay in acknowledging the prize and absence from the award ceremony had something to do with maintaining his reputation as an anti-establishment renegade.\n\nI don’t fault Dylan for that. Promoting and managing a reputation has long been central to an artist’s job. Since at least the middle of the nineteenth century, avant-garde fine artists and entertainers alike have marketed themselves as provocative and unique and easily recognizable through trademark styles or porkpie hats. By now, millions of us regular people have followed suit and routinely self-promote, updating our Facebook profiles, uploading new videos to our YouTube channels, tweeting fresh remarks, and measuring success by our number of “likes,” views, and followers. Surely it’s a culture of narcissism as some have said, but I think there’s something else in the way so many of us invent and cultivate our personal brands. Business is in us. It’s a part of us. Dylan’s admonishing line, “he not busy being born is busy dying,” really does define America (and the world) today: his words about busy-ness could be quoted in business school. Long before these values permeated the avant-garde and then the rest of us, eighteenth- century manufacturing and marketing pioneers like Josiah Wedgwood studied trends and managed public perceptions of their companies to compete for market share. The Nobel, new and improved for the twenty- first century, may well be an example of the infusion of business values into a cultural institution that had once seemed impermeable to them.\n\nThen again, maybe I’m overthinking things. Maybe our new Nobel Laureate deserves the last word: “don’t think twice, it’s all right.”\n\nBrigitte Leschhorn\n\nWhen it comes to Bob Dylan, I have always been intrigued by the reverent title of “the voice of a generation.” I recognize that Bob Dylan’s work means much less to me than to the people who personally experienced the America in which he evolved as an artist. His songs persist with incredible relevance in my own generation, and yet I am caught on one word—deserve. What specific prerequisites and qualities does the Swedish Academy discuss as they consider their nominees? I wonder if Bob Dylan deserves the Medal of Freedom, too, which he received for his influence on American culture over the last half-century. It’s easier to understand what the Medal of Freedom seeks to honor—significant contribution of some sort—than what the Nobel Prize does. Perhaps we should look to why Dylan is the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature in the year 2016 and what that communicates about the current global perception of America.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize for having “captured the world’s attention and given its people hope for a better future” through his Cairo speech. Like many others, I questioned this gesture by the committee and what they were trying to tell the world, to tell America. After all, a prize is simply a form of communication to say this is what we value most, what has inspired us, what has led our imaginations into a new place we’ve always wanted to visit. President Obama represented the idea that the most unlikely part of the American dream could be made into reality if, as the announcement states, we focus on the “values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world’s population.”\n\nThe announcement avoids naming these values and attitudes. This was in part the key to President Obama’s own success—being ambiguous in his support so that he could say he supports us all. The irony, of course, is that the rhetoric of racial and ethnic divisiveness cemented its twenty-first-century revival during the Obama presidency, and we have found ourselves in 2016 in a climate that does not at all resemble the hopefulness the world saw in our nation in 2009.\n\nNow Bob Dylan has won a Nobel Prize, which like Obama’s own award, many have come in to question. Again, the Nobel Prize committee seems to be talking directly to us with its unique international authority. But to parse it out, we have to go back further to the last time an American won the literature prize—Toni Morrison. She was chosen in 1993 for being a “visionary force.” The wording of her announcement reflects a hopeful glance into the future, like Obama’s. In contrast, Dylan has created “new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” While Morrison gives the world “an essential aspect of American reality,” Dylan returns us to the past, to American tradition and poetry. It’s in making this choice that the committee is attempting to be visionary, to go back to the past while forging a new sense of what should be considered literature in the future. But this acknowledgement that Bob Dylan is more tradition than vision is a sign that something has been lost in terms of our own sense of what America is, and both American people and the world are desperate to find it.\n\nIn reading up on Bob Dylan, the most useful sources to me, personally, are those written in Spanish and French by people who only know Americanness as it is portrayed within a global mosaic. I have a harder time understanding the commentary and even the odes written about Bob Dylan by American scholars because they talk about Dylan in a context that feels too separate from the America I know. I turn to the scrutinizing eyes of the world instead. The Spanish literary magazine Revista Litoral published an essay about Bob Dylan in its 1989 issue themed “The Poetry of Rock.” The essay saw the poetic reality in Bob Dylan’s early albums, which were rooted in its generation and time. The essay claims that Bob Dylan’s poetry loses its power when it becomes self-aware—as it does in the later albums—that it is the voice of a generation.\n\nImmerse yourself in the Bob Dylan of tradition, the product of his love for Woody Guthrie and the deep influence of the blues in his music, and you will find a world you recognize. In The Times They Are A’Changin’, Dylan’s lyrics demand self-reflection. The songs dive into the kind of alienation that many people have felt in the last year, myself among them. I found an echo of my solitude in the stories of Hollis Brown, Medgar Evers, Hattie Carroll. Bob Dylan isn’t my kind of poet, but he is my kind of storyteller. Over the years, he has collected pieces of American stories—marginal and mainstream—and woven them together as though he had merely stumbled upon their natural state. Even the darkest of misfits has a place in Dylan’s portrait of America. But here lies the catch-22. Dylan’s earliest songs harken to our own individual and national darkness, and in making him the voice of a generation, his own voice loses the power it had by singing stories that America once refused to acknowledge.\n\nI honestly think the committee meant to give us a vision of hope and regeneration by choosing Dylan. But the problem is that Bob Dylan’s win would have meant much more decades ago than it does now. He has been absorbed into the American bloodstream, and his potent voice realized its political and cultural might a little too late. He is now an American reverie, deserving of our honor, yes, but not a reflection of the bodies of literature trying to carve a better world than the past ever cared to give us.\n\nAnis Shivani"
