        "text": "Literary prizes rarely go without controversy - sometimes that seems the entire point of them - so the award of the Nobel to Harold Pinter is unsurprisingly controversial. Christopher Hitchens said the prize would never redeem its reputation, while a theatrically knowledgeable friend of mine emailed to say he'd written only three decent plays and those a long time ago. These are opinions, to be argued over but never quashed. A letter-writer to the Guardian, however, went too far when he wrote that the Nobel was a meaningless guide to greatness in literature and Pinter should be \"categorised with former winners Pearl S Buck, Rabindranath Tagore, Bertrand Russell and Winston Churchill - whose literary works are now almost completely unread\".\n\nAs I read Tagore's name, I could see a thousand Bengalis reaching for the electronic equivalent of green ink. To say that Tagore is \"unread\" poses the question, unread by whom? Tagore is the greatest writer, the greatest artist, the greatest public figure, that one of the world's largest language groups has ever produced. A comparable figure is hard to find. Burns in Scotland? Shakespeare, Dickens in England? In their grip on the general population none comes close. In Bengal people read Tagore, recite Tagore, sing Tagore. The national anthems of India and Bangladesh are his words. An express train is named after his book of verses, Gitanjali, for which he won the Nobel Prize.\n\nIn the early 1980s I lived for a time with my then mother-in-law in the city then known as Calcutta. Domestically, there was some melodious exposure to Tagore. She had attended his university, had a fine voice and sang Tagore songs.\n\nMore prolonged tuition in the great man's work happened in the public relations offices of the Eastern Railway, where I went every day for a week or two in the hope of finding a few facts and pointers for a book I never wrote about India's railways. The chief public relations officer was only marginally interested in railways. Most days, he would sit in his office with a group of friends - journalists from the local papers, perhaps a colleague from the ticketing department - and they would instruct me in Tagore. A railway servant would bring lunch. From outside the darkened room, shutters closed, a fan spinning lazily from the ceiling, came the clanging of trams in the heat of Old Court Street.\n\nAs well as Tagoreans there were post-Tagoreans, just as Victorian Britain contained a few atheists. One office visitor argued that Yeats had pretty well rewritten Tagore's own English translation of Gitanjali before it was published, another that it was Sweden's pro-German leanings that had led the Nobel committee to award the prize to a dissenting member of the British empire. It happened in 1913, but in the offices of the Eastern Railway it might have been yesterday. When I mentioned my failure to like the serene, numinous Gitanjali, a man said: \"Reading poetry in translation is like looking at embroidery from the back.\"\n\nTagore translated the poems that became Gitanjali during his voyage to England, his second visit, in 1912. He was 51 and sailing west partly to seek treatment for piles. Famously, he lost the only copy of his manuscript on the tube between Charing Cross and Russell Square (though recovered it from the left-luggage office). Yeats read it, loved it, suggested a few cuts and minor changes, and wrote an introduction.\n\nMacmillan published the first edition in October 1912, not even five months after Tagore had stepped off the boat. It ran to 10 editions in its first year, during which time the poet and critic Thomas Sturge Moore proposed it to the Nobel committee, which was also considering the merits of Thomas Hardy and of the favourite, a French \"moralist\", Emile Faguet. Verner von Heidenstam, a Swedish poet who later won the Nobel himself, seems to have clinched the debate when he wrote to the committee that in \"purity of heart\" and the \"total impression of deep and rare spiritual beauty\" no living writer could compete. The prize was sensational, the first Nobel awarded to a person who wasn't white, the first sign that the west had no monopoly of literary culture. The New York Times reported that \"Babindranath [sic] Tagore, if not exactly one of us, is, as an Aryan, a distant relation of all white folk.\"\n\nIf only for its wake-up call to the west, Tagore's Nobel should be remembered. Its causes and consequences should also be remembered because they give the lie to the idea that the world of publishing and prizes has fallen from a previous state of grace. According to Tagore's biographer, Krishna Kripalani, Macmillan cashed in quickly with several more books, which were poorly translated. His later biographers, Andrew Robinson and Krishna Dutta, felt the Nobel committee needed to \"discover\" somebody, to create a big name before, in the words of Von Heidenstam, \"it has already spent years haunting the newspaper columns\".\n\nIs Gitanjali any good? Wilfred Owen thought well enough of it to write down its first lines and preserve them in a pocket book, where they were discovered by his mother when he died. But anyone who has sat in a publisher's office or on a prize committee will know that, when it comes to a decision, extra-textual considerations cannot always be excluded."
