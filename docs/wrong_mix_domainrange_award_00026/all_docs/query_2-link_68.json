        "text": "Strindberg and Karlfeldt\n\nKarl-Ivar Hildeman\n\nDespite his eminence within Swedish literature Strindberg never received a Nobel Prize from the Swedish Academy. The generation that succeeded him could, however, boast of three Nobel Prize winners, the last of whom was Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1864–1931). Just after his death in 1931 the prize was awarded to “the poetry of E. A. Karlfeldt”; at the time of his death he was poet laureate and had dominated the Swedish literary scene for many years by virtue of artistic talents quite different from those of Strindberg.\n\nTo his Swedish contemporaries Strindberg never ceased to be regarded as both the major proponent of Swedish naturalism and the literary leader of the 1880s. But in the nineties the symbolist movement emerged, emphasizing aestheticism, fantasy, and “the joy of life” as qualities integral to literary expression: the Swedish audience was apparently satiated with realistic novels and social criticism, and the nineties became the golden age of lyric poetry and imagination, a tendency that overshadowed Strindberg’s works at a time when he was usually living abroad and his production was less prolific because of personal crises. The vanguards of this new movement were Verner von Heidenstam (1859–1940) and his learned friend Oscar Levertin (1862–1906). In 1891 Selma Lagerlöf (1858–1940) and Per Hallström (1866–1960) also published their first works in accordance with this new trend, as did the most popular and most genuinely lyric poet of that generation, Gustaf Fröding (1860–1911). Karlfeldt did not really appear on the literary scene until 1895, with his breakthrough coming three years later with his second collection, Fridolins visor (Fridolin’s Songs). He strengthened his position with Fridolins lustgård (Fridolin’s Pleasure Garden) in 1901, and in 1904 he became a member of the Swedish Academy, the first representative of the younger generation. Until then the new literati had systematically been rejected by the dictatorial secretary of the Academy, Carl David af Wirsén, who did battle with the schools of the eighties and of the nineties with equal energy and contempt. At that time Strindberg had returned home and enjoyed a unique position because of his extensive literary output and his international reputation. But in many respects he did not seem to fit in with the pattern of current Swedish literature. The old warrior occasionally renewed his attacks on the establishment, as in Svarta fanor (Black Banners), with the same cannibal appetite that once had almost made him an outlaw within these circles. And although he was admired for his talent as an author, his aggressiveness made him very controversial to large, influential segments of the Swedish audience.\n\nKarlfeldt’s position was quite the opposite: he was unobtrusive and sensitive, quick to take offense, and disliked public quarrels, all of which led him to refuse to participate in the kind of literary feuds in which Strindberg seemed to bask. During a journey to Italy in 1901 Karlfeldt wrote for instance to a friend of his: “Vänlig hälsning från Rom. Jag kom först i går tillbaka hit … och strax grep mig lifvets allvar och bitterhet på nytt. Jag fann här två bref—det ena uppfordrar mig att ge mig med i en litterär fejd, som ej alls rör mig … Idyllen förbi.”1 Karlfeldt was not interested in political–literary parties and programs, and his works were not concerned with social, political, or even literary topics, but were quite simply lyric poetry of emotion and mood evocation. His production did not challenge any powerful group, and he was respected as an independent artist. Karlfeldt was sixteen years younger than Strindberg and it was only during a twelve-year period, 1900–1912, that they could possibly have met as equals. But one wonders to what extent they really did meet or know each other?\n\nFew written sources can help us with this problem. Evidently they knew each other and had some close mutual friends, in particular Albert Engström, artist and writer. In his biography of Karlfeldt written in 1931, C. Mangård states that “mellan Karlfeldt och Strindberg rådde ett mycket gott förhållande trots olikheten i livssyn och temperament. Då de träffades, samspråkade de kordialt om också med någon spydighet å båda hållen.”2 Apparently Mangård has his information from Karlfeldt’s friend Otto Silfwerskiöld, who tells us about several situations when Strindberg and Karlfeldt accidently met, and Karlfeldt’s wording indicates a rather intimate attitude, incidents that may well be the entire basis for this statement. Mrs. Gerda Karlfeldt, ninety-six years old, recalled that they were not intimate friends: “de tyckte inte om varandra.”3 Her point of view is Karlfeldt’s, of course, but he himself never confirmed this attitude (or any other) in print. On Strindberg as an author he has just one comment in all his production: in his book on the romantic poet C. F. Dahlgren, he praises Dahlgren’s concrete metaphors and realistic style as “en stilkonst, som får sin glans i svensk litteratur genom Strindberg.”4 But he never comments on him as an individual. According to the register of letters preserved at Karlfeldt’s home, Sångs in Sjugare, Leksand, there are no records of Strindberg.5 In the rather limited collection of books at Sångs, Strindberg is represented by one drama, Stora landsvägen (The Great Highway), and four prose works, among them Svarta fanor, but by no lyric works (moreover, there are no dedications by Strindberg in any of the volumes at Sångs).\n\nBut what, one may ask, was Strindberg’s attitude towards Karlfeldt? Professor Walter Behrendson’s register of names in Strindberg’s production is to be found in the Royal Library in Stockholm, where there is no mention of Karlfeldt. His name does not appear in Strindberg’s letters, preserved in the same library,6 and none of Karlfeldt’s works have been found in Strindberg’s library.7 Relatives who had close contacts with him at that time do not recall that he had anything to say about Karlfeldt,8 a fact that may be traced to his lack of enthusiasm for Karlfeldt’s genre. Gunnar Ollén has pointed out that Strindberg despised lyric poetry: “Någon poesinjutare tycks han inte ha varit.”9 Harriet Bosse, his third wife, has verified that “om han någon gång tittade i en lyrikbok, så gick läsningen med svindlande fart.”10 It is furthermore doubtful that Strindberg paid much attention to the development of Swedish lyric poetry during his last years, when he was occupied mainly with theater, with, however, one important exception: the Strindberg Feud.\n\nIn the spring of 1910 Strindberg launched his last and most direct attack on the establishment, mainly the literary establishment, or those he regarded as his competitors as leaders of Swedish literature. Strindberg’s target was the generation of the nineties, represented by the program writers—among them Heidenstam and the late Levertin—because they enjoyed a wide reputation that could rival Strindberg’s. Strindberg was of the opinion that he had anticipated their program and that their laurels for the literary rebellion against gloomy naturalism in fact belonged to him. The country was divided in two parties, for and against, as were the newspapers, which quoted Strindberg’s articles with applause or scorn. On the whole, rather few of the participants in the debate disputed Strindberg’s literary importance, but even fewer approved of the way he treated his opponents. Levertin was dead and Heidenstam kept silent for almost one year in spite of Strindberg’s repeated and insulting attacks. Until then Hallström was the only one of the poets of the nineties who made counterattacks and defended his school,11 even though his name had never been directly mentioned by Strindberg. Nor had Karlfeldt’s, but the mere absence of Karlfeldt’s name does not necessarily indicate that Strindberg was not concerned with him and his role in Swedish literature. Certainly Karlfeldt was unobtrusive, and he was no intimate friend of the men whom Strindberg initially attacked, Heidenstam and Levertin. One of Karlfeldt’s closest friends was Fröding, and everyone in the battles of the nineties treated him as an exception because of the quality of his poetry, the popular themes in his works, and his gentle and human genius—a heritage to which Karlfeldt was regarded as successor. Fröding had been legally prosecuted for immoral writing (like Strindberg) and thus could hardly be accused of ties with the establishment, even by the suspicious Strindberg.\n\nBut Karlfeldt could: he was more or less accepted by both sides, except that he was a member of the Swedish Academy. At that time the Academy was detested by the authors of the eighties and of the nineties alike; Wirsén, the secretary, accepted neither Strindberg nor Heidenstam. But in 1904 Karlfeldt was elected a member of the Academy as the first “modern poet,” apparently because he ostensibly did not belong to any particular group and thus was not controversial from Wirsén’s point of view. Wirsén’s acceptance almost assured Strindberg’s rejection. Strindberg started his literary feud by attacking the Academy as a part of the royal establishment. Nobody was mentioned by name, nor was anybody excepted. But at least one sentence seemed to have certain implications: “Och man märker strax, även på de modigaste, så snart de inträtt i Sv.A., om också i föregiven avsikt att reformera, att där råder en atmosfär och hovluft, som kväver, och fruktan att skriva om någonting driver den nödställde att öva ‘konsten att säga någonting vackert om ingenting.’”12 Karlfeldt’s entrance into the Academy was interpreted as a sign: he was expected to break down barriers and introduce a new generation into the formerly closed circle. In 1910, six years later, little had happened to justify those expectations. Hallström had been accepted by the Academy in 1908, but Wirsén stubbornly continued to reject Heidenstam; Strindberg was out of the question as even more “immoral,” and not until Wirsén’s death in 1912 was Karlfeldt, as his successor, able to reform the policy of the Academy, by which time Strindberg was also dead.\n\nFrom Strindberg’s comment about “reformers” we cannot conclude whether his attack was aimed at Karlfeldt in particular or at him and some of his other colleagues. But we can notice the way at least part of the contemporary audience interpreted this passage and others. A poet with close contacts with both the school of the nineties and the labor movement (which largely supported Strindberg wholeheartedly) was K. E. Forsslund. He criticized Strindberg in the social-democratic periodical Fram and objected “att i en tidning intas en hånfull, groft okunnig artikel mot andliga stormän, sådana som Levertin och Karlfeldt (åtminstone åsyftad, såvitt jag förstått rätt)”13 Another author, the young Lubbe Nordström, used other tactics in defending Karlfeldt and tried to separate him from the rest of the Academy: “Funnes mer rättvisa i världen borde Karlfeldt befrias ur denna samling (Sv. A.), ty jämte Fröding och Strindberg hör han till det levande folket.…”14 Strindberg did not renew his attack on the “reformers” of the Academy Other participants in the quarrel, who were numerous and frequently as violent as Strindberg, expanded the front and included several of the other poets of the nineties, but Karlfeldt remained uninvolved. As the debate concerning the nineties continued, both sides made a distinction between Heidenstam and Levertin on one hand and Fröding and Karlfeldt on the other. Heidenstam and Levertin were regarded as too sophisticated; Fröding and especially Karlfeldt as more simple, popular, genuine, and “Swedish.” Therefore, they did not fit in with “the School” of the nineties. Even a moderate critic like Hj. Haralds could put it this way: “Huru sjuklig, osund och dekadensmättad står icke Heidenstams och Levertins diktning mot Karlfeldts, Fridolins diktare!”15\n\nThe leftists in particular were eager to recruit Karlfeldt as a member of the Strindberg group. The Strindberg Feud was not only a literary battle; it had also a political and social basis. Strindberg identified himself with the radicals and the workers; Heidenstam with his aristocratic roots and Levertin with his academic background were regarded as rightists, accepted by the establishment as its representatives. From that point of view Karlfeldt was more of a representative of the people. He came from a farmer’s family and he emphasized the fact in his poetry, which was concerned with rural life. When Karlfeldt published his first collections he used the modest term “visor” instead of poems (i.e., popular songs in a less sophisticated manner than the traditional academic style), and partly because of his lack of pretension they actually became popular and were often described as “genuine” by the critics. Among the Strindberg defenders who strove to enlist Karlfeldt in their ranks, the most militant was Professor Bengt Lidforss. He used the Strindberg Feud for a personal war on Levertin and accused him of unfair treatment of Strindberg. “Även den konsekventa tystnad, som Levertin ständigt intagit gentemot Karlfeldt, är påtagligen ett utslag av hans antipati mot allt som är svenskt i djupare mening.”16 Levertin was a Jew, and Lidforss an anti-Semite; Levertin had not reviewed Karlfeldt’s collections but acknowledged him as “a genuine poet.” Karlfeldt disliked the decadent trend in Levertin’s poetry but was nevertheless attracted and influenced by it. This influence was, however, never discussed by either Karlfeldt or his contemporaries, perhaps because he was supposed to be “Swedish in a more profound meaning,” as was Strindberg, according to Lidforss and his faction.\n\nThe attitude of Strindberg’s proponents may have convinced him, if he were not already convinced, that he could find better targets for his attack on the nineties and on the Swedish Academy. It can hardly be doubted that he knew how Karlfeldt had come to be included in the Academy, for it was no secret at that time. Count Snoilsky, the old poet and a friend of the king, had been rather intimate friends with Karlfeldt, for he was the director of the Royal Library where Karlfeldt was employed. It was well known that he liked Karlfeldt’s poetry and wanted him as his successor in the Swedish Academy. Snoilsky’s opinion was important to the king and to Wirsén, who also felt that in the long run he could not prevent a younger generation from entering the Academy. But when Karlfeldt was offered a seat in the Academy, he refused, compelling Wirsén to make a futile trip to Dalarna in an attempt to persuade him. At least this was Wirsén’s official version—in fact, he favored a different candidate.17 There were also rumors that Karlfeldt had rejected the seat because of pressure from Heidenstam’s supporters, who wanted their leader to be chosen instead.18 The following year another seat was open, and this time Karlfeldt was elected by the Academy without being asked in advance, and he could show his independence only by turning down the royal order that at that time was given to members of the Academy. Thus everyone could clearly see that Karlfeldt dissented from the rest of the assembly.\n\nStrindberg may have noticed this protestation, but the main reason that he never attacked Karlfeldt directly was probably that Karlfeldt “aldrig uppträtt med några pretentioner på att vara andlig förare, och hans dikt har dessutom en manlig öppenhet och blygsamhet, som ställer honom vid sidan av klicken (kring Heidenstam),” as one of Strindberg’s supporters put it.19 In fact, Karlfeldt had rebelled against Wirsén already in 1906, but this was hardly known outside the Academy.20 During the entire Strindberg debate Karlfeldt himself kept silent; nor did he ever subsequently mention the feud.\n\nWhatever personal relations may be, authors usually influence each other by their works. In this case it is a priori not very likely that Karlfeldt’s poetry was of any importance to Strindberg’s. Gunnar Ollén, however, thinks that there are some indications of such an influence in Strindberg’s lyric collection Ordalek och småkonst (Word Play and Minor Art) of 1905. In the poem “Vargarna tjuta” (“The Wolves Howl”) “diktaren ger sig tid med ett par bilder, ‘Högt Orion svärdet svänger, Karlavagnen står på stup,’ vilka har något av de Karlfeldtska Dalmålningarnas festliga livfullhet.”21 Celestial constellations of this type are used by Karlfeldt in his “poetic transcription” of rural wall paintings with biblical motifs from his home province Dalarna. He uses them as metaphors; the constellations become active persons, animals, and facts in accordance with their names. In this case it is Karlfeldt’s poem “Elie himmelsfärd” (“Elijah’s Journey to Heaven”) that is relevant. In that poem Elijah travels in his chariot through the sky surrounded by the Scorpion, the Bears, the Dog, the Lion, and the Snake—all Swedish names for constellations, like Karlavagnen (“Charles’s Wain”) and Orion in Strindberg’s work. Ollén also indicates that Strindberg’s second part of the poem “Holländarn” (“The Dutchman”), which has the microcosm motif in common with Karlfeldt’s poem “Mikrokosmos,” may point in a similar direction.22 The two Karlfeldt poems are to be found in Fridolins lustgård (1901), but the parallels are hardly obvious, and Ollén’s caution is certainly justified. In his book August Strindberg (1979), Olof Lagercrantz asserts that Strindberg has used Karlfeldt’s poem “Häxorna” (“The Witches”) for one of his last dramas, Den siste riddaren (The Last of the Knights). The parallels are, however, hardly evident enough to prove such a claim.23\n\nOne would rather expect Strindberg to be of importance to Karlfeldt and his poetry, and on a certain level the inheritance is clear. Karlfeldt has a taste for bold realistic metaphors that has often been admired. Some of them have been quoted so often that they are classics in the Swedish tradition—“höstmånens röda kastrull” (“the red saucepan of the autumn moon”) and others. The only time Karlfeldt comments on Strindberg’s function in Swedish literature he applauds the same tendency. As far as their linguistic tools are concerned, the poets of the nineties continued to be naturalists, drastic and daring. Many authors continue to this day to be indebted to Strindberg, for the modern Swedish language really starts with him and his vigorous prose. Apparently Karlfeldt was aware of his impact, accepted it, and tried to follow suit. Many of his metaphors in the bold realistic style that were once so admired appear doubtful today, and his copper saucepan is artificial compared with Strindberg’s linguistic paintings. (This is the case with many of Karlfeldt’s metaphors but certainly not all of them.)\n\nLikewise, there is little evidence that Strindberg’s lyric works were of any importance to Karlfeldt. As far as temperament and poetic technique are concerned, they were totally different as lyric poets. Nor are Strindberg’s novels and short stories reflected in Karlfeldt’s production in other ways than that mentioned above, although Strindberg’s openness to nature should have attracted Karlfeldt. All of this leads us to investigate Karlfeldt’s interest in Strindberg’s dramatic works. Karlfeldt’s interest in the theater seems to have been slight. Mrs. Karlfeldt recalled that he went there “sometimes.” “På teatern gick han endast två eller tre gånger om året, utan att därför på minsta sätt underskatta den sceniska konsten,” says Mangård.24 Karlfeldt comments critically on a drama by C. F. Dahlgren from the 1820s, but he finds that “jämnt ett hundra år efteråt lyssnar man kväll efter kväll till likartade men dummare dialoger på landets främsta teater.”25 Evidently he had been to the theater often enough to form an opinion of his own. We do not know how many of Strindberg’s plays Karlfeldt may have seen or read, but there are indications that at least one of them made a lasting impression, Folkungasagan (The Saga of the Folkungs) from 1899.\n\nKarlfeldt wrote his last great poem in 1930, the year before he died. It is called “Vallfärd” (“Pilgrimage”).26 It deals once again with a recurring motif in Karlfeldt’s poetry, the concept of sexuality. But here it is not a problem of guilt or lust as it often had been before, for Karlfeldt had encountered Freud, and the power of sexuality (“the mountain storm”) is no longer a threat from evil forces. The background of the poem is medieval: a plague forces the people to set out for a pilgrimage to the monastery of Gudsberga in Dalarna, where one of the residents is Staffan, who is considered to be a saint and a seer (as a matter of fact he seems to have existed historically, and Karlfeldt uses certain local legends for part of his poem). The pilgrimage concludes in a religious and sexual ecstasy: “Syntes ock kvinnor, häxor lika, som ryckte sitt hår, flängde sin hud med spö, så lemmarna dröpo av sår.”27\n\nKarlfeldt alludes to the medieval scourgers, the flagellants, who also appear in Folkungasagan. Strindberg’s drama has a similar background; a plague in the Middle Ages compels the people to penance. Here we encounter flagellants, “halfnakna människor, som deltaga i Litanian och gissla sig under ett slags högtidlig dans,” according to Strindberg’s instructions in the drama.28 In this connection he has used a song out of popular Swedish tradition from olden times as a recurrent theme; it is intoned already in the first act and is echoed repeatedly later on. It is a kind of prophecy in rhyme, called “Stenen i grönan dal” (“The Stone in the Green Valley”). According to popular tradition it was attributed to Staffan in Gudsberga, which Strindberg may or may not have known, for the song and the tradition are not widespread and Staffan is not mentioned by name in his drama. But we can be sure that Karlfeldt knew this background because we can date a visit he made to Gudsberga where he was informed of its history, including that of a stone called Staffan’s Stone, which we meet both in the song and in the poem.29 The flagellants and the song in particular are not common material and I know of no other source where they are to be found in combination except in Strindberg’s drama. So it seems probable that Folkungasagan contributed to Karlfeldt’s image of the Middle Ages, as it is reflected in “Vallfärd.”\n\nAlready in his third collection, Fridolins lustgård, which, we recall, was published in 1901, Karlfeldt has another pastiche from the Middle Ages or the Renaissance, called I kungalunden (In the Royal Grove). It is written in quite a different mood, as an elegant courtly poem, depicting a royal wedding long ago. A princess from “Vendens land,” northern Germany, arrives at a castle in Sweden and is welcomed by the prince and the king. The poem is pure pastiche: Karlfeldt has amused himself by painting a milieu without any other function. There is just one historical situation that coincides with the plot (a Swedish crown prince who married a princess from northern Germany in the Middle Ages): the marriage of King Magnus Eriksson’s oldest son, Erik, to Beatrix of Brandenburg in 1356. This is not an incident to which the history books pay much attention, but in Strindberg’s Folkungasagan King Magnus is the main character and the young couple play a touching part as innocent victims of a retributive family guilt. A Swedish audience of today is aware of their existence only because of Strindberg’s play, and Karlfeldt may well have belonged to that audience. Folkungasagan was published in 1899 and was performed for the first time in January 1901. Karlfeldt’s poem was published in the spring that same year and the author’s attitude to the young couple is strikingly similar to that of Strindberg. Indeed, to plead coincidence here would be to deny Strindberg his due.\n\nThe result of this investigation is almost as negative as one might have predicted. Scanty exceptions cannot eliminate the main impression of distance between the dominating dramatist and the leading lyric poet in early twentieth-century Sweden. Their domains, temperaments, and interests were so different that they effected a mutual lack of interest and also a lack of competition. Nevertheless, there are indications that even Karlfeldt could not withstand the omnipresent impact of Strindberg.\n\nNotes\n\n1.
