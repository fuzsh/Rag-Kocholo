No "Sweden's Bjornsterne Bjornson" ever received the Nobel Prize for Literature as stated in footnote on p. 40, TIME, Nov. 19. Alfred Nobel's Sweden has to be satisfied with Literature Prize Winners Selma Lagerloöf (1909), Verner von Heidenstam (1916) and Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1931).

What you intended to say was "Norway's Björnstjerne Björnson," wasn't it? The year (1903) is correct.

... I imagine that Belgium likes and admires her very own Maurice Maeterlinck. So repatriate him, too.

TIME gladly repatriates Björnson to Norway, Maeterlinck to Belgium.ED.

Sirs:

TIME'S report (TIME, Nov. 19, p. 40) of the recognition once accorded such literary greats as "France's" Maeterlinck and more especially Sweden's" Björnson serves only to accentuate the injustice done that staunch English patriot Eamon De Valera. Surely his contributions in word and deed to the development of a better understanding between neighboring people call for the award of a Nobel prize, that for the promotion of peace being perhaps the most appropriate. . . .

In the same garbled footnotes the names of Spain's Jacinto Benavente & José Echegaray, and Italy's Grazia Deledda & Giosué Carducci were misspelled or wrongly accented. To TIME'S Theatre Department, rebuke for stupid errors.ED.

Southern Gentleman

Sirs:

Characteristic, without prejudice, was the TIME, Nov. 19 account of the Negro "Gentleman from Illinois." I fear many Southernersnot only "hot-blooded Congressmen from the South"will let the color of Chicago's new Democratic Representative Arthur Mitchell shade their opinions of his ability. . . . Moving here eight years ago a Chicagoan until thenI have failed miserably in an earnest attempt to find justification for the Southern attitude toward all Negroes. . .

Sirs:

Is it your intention to be deliberately offensive to Southern people? Surely not. But if not, then why these frequent references to alleged racial differences between whites and blacks? . . .

Your latest effusion is captioned "Gentleman from Illinois" and is shown under the caption of "Races."

Had it occurred to you that if Chicago's Negro Congressman-Elect Mitchell is a native of Alabama, and has a little common sense, and "would not keep thinking about the fact that" he "was colored," there is not likely to be very much racial embarrassment?
