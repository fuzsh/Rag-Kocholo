This 1975 Pontiac Astre hatchback was purchased new from McKee Pontiac GMC of Oregon City, Oregon, and is said to have remained with its original owner until the current owner acquired the vehicle in 2012. Powered by a 140ci inline-four paired with a Turbo-Hydramatic three-speed automatic transmission, the vehicle is finished in silver with red and orange stripes over gray cloth upholstery. The car is equipped with the Li’l Wide Track package, which was composed of the aforementioned accent striping as well as cast-aluminum cross-lace wheels, a front air dam, and a rear spoiler. Other features include front disc brakes, a Delco AM radio, woodgrain interior trim, a fold-down rear seat, and dual side mirrors. The engine reportedly was resealed in 2022, and the tires, belts, and hoses were replaced under current ownership. Now showing 64k miles, this Astre is offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with 1975 purchase paperwork, PHS documentation, manufacturer’s literature, and a clean Oregon title.

Based on the Chevrolet Vega, the Astre was a subcompact model that Pontiac launched in the Canadian market in 1973 and offered in the United States for the 1975–1977 model years. This two-door hatchback is finished in silver with Li’l Wide Track–specific red, orange, and yellow striping. The Li’l Wide Track package also brought a rear spoiler, a front air dam, and quarter-window louvers; this car is missing the louvers for the driver side, and the remaining louvers were removed for most of the photos provided in the gallery below. Chipped paint, dents, and scratches are pictured in the gallery, as is wear on the quarter panels beneath the spoiler’s outer edges.

Cast-aluminum cross-lace 13″ wheels with yellow and red centers are mounted with 185/70 Thunderer Mach I tires that show 2011 date codes. Braking is provided by unassisted front discs and rear drums, and the car has coil springs at all four corners.

Li’l Wide Track lettering is called out on the hood panel. The hood striping is faded. Approximately 3,000 Astres are said to have been built in Li’l Wide Track specification.

The front bucket and rear bench seating surfaces are upholstered in gray cloth with vinyl trim. Appointments include a Delco AM radio, woodgrain interior trim, a floor-mounted shifter, a heater/defroster, Radial Tuned Suspension badging, a passenger-side grab handle, front shoulder belts, rear lap belts, and a fold-down rear seat. Imperfections in the carpeting in the driver’s footwell area are shown in the gallery, and the struts for the hatchback will not hold the component open.

The three-spoke steering wheel fronts a 120-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 5,500-rpm redline, a clock, and gauges monitoring coolant temperature, fuel level, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 64k miles, approximately 200 of which have been added under current ownership.

The 140ci SOHC inline-four is topped by a two-barrel carburetor and produced a factory-rated 87 horsepower. The belts and hoses were replaced under current ownership, and the engine was resealed around 2022. A spare battery tray is included in the sale.

Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Turbo-Hydramatic three-speed automatic transmission. Corrosion is noted on underbody components, including a rust hole ahead of the right-front wheel in the vicinity of the battery.

Documentation from Pontiac Historic Services will accompany the vehicle along with 1975 purchase paperwork, photocopies of 1970s titles and registration slips, manufacturer’s literature, and service records from current ownership.

Former Pontiac advertising executive Jim Wangers signed the car’s sun visor in 2012 for the vehicle’s current owner.
