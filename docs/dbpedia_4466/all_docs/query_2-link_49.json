Properties from Product additionalProperty PropertyValue A property-value pair representing an additional characteristic of the entity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.\n\nNote: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. https://schema.org/width, https://schema.org/color, https://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. asin Text or\n\nURL An Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a 10-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by Amazon.com and its partners for product identification within the Amazon organization (summary from Wikipedia's article).\n\nNote also that this is a definition for how to include ASINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of ASINs in general - see documentation from Amazon for authoritative details. ASINs are most commonly encoded as text strings, but the [asin] property supports URL/URI as potential values too. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. award Text An award won by or for this item. Supersedes awards. brand Brand or\n\nOrganization The brand(s) associated with a product or service, or the brand(s) maintained by an organization or business person. category CategoryCode or\n\nPhysicalActivityCategory or\n\nText or\n\nThing or\n\nURL A category for the item. Greater signs or slashes can be used to informally indicate a category hierarchy. color Text The color of the product. colorSwatch ImageObject or\n\nURL A color swatch image, visualizing the color of a Product. Should match the textual description specified in the color property. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. countryOfAssembly Text The place where the product was assembled. countryOfLastProcessing Text The place where the item (typically Product) was last processed and tested before importation. countryOfOrigin Country The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative works such as movie and TV content.\n\nIn the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of CreativeWork it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as contentLocation and locationCreated may be more applicable.\n\nIn the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here. depth Distance or\n\nQuantitativeValue The depth of the item. funding Grant A Grant that directly or indirectly provide funding or sponsorship for this item. See also ownershipFundingInfo.\n\nInverse property: fundedItem gtin Text or\n\nURL A Global Trade Item Number (GTIN). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.\n\nA correct gtin value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a \"GS1 Digital Link\" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a valid GS1 check digit and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also GS1's GTIN Summary and Wikipedia for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The gtin property generalizes the earlier gtin8, gtin12, gtin13, and gtin14 properties.\n\nThe GS1 digital link specifications expresses GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Digital Links should be populated into the hasGS1DigitalLink attribute.\n\nNote also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details. gtin12 Text The GTIN-12 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. The GTIN-12 is the 12-digit GS1 Identification Key composed of a U.P.C. Company Prefix, Item Reference, and Check Digit used to identify trade items. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details. gtin13 Text The GTIN-13 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This is equivalent to 13-digit ISBN codes and EAN UCC-13. Former 12-digit UPC codes can be converted into a GTIN-13 code by simply adding a preceding zero. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details. gtin14 Text The GTIN-14 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details. gtin8 Text The GTIN-8 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This code is also known as EAN/UCC-8 or 8-digit EAN. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details. hasAdultConsideration AdultOrientedEnumeration Used to tag an item to be intended or suitable for consumption or use by adults only. hasCertification Certification Certification information about a product, organization, service, place, or person. hasEnergyConsumptionDetails EnergyConsumptionDetails Defines the energy efficiency Category (also known as \"class\" or \"rating\") for a product according to an international energy efficiency standard. hasGS1DigitalLink URL The GS1 digital link associated with the object. This URL should conform to the particular requirements of digital links. The link should only contain the Application Identifiers (AIs) that are relevant for the entity being annotated, for instance a Product or an Organization, and for the correct granularity. In particular, for products:\n\nA Digital Link that contains a serial number (AI 21) should only be present on instances of IndividualProduct\n\nA Digital Link that contains a lot number (AI 10) should be annotated as SomeProduct if only products from that lot are sold, or IndividualProduct if there is only a specific product.\n\nA Digital Link that contains a global model number (AI 8013) should be attached to a Product or a ProductModel.\n\nOther item types should be adapted similarly. hasMeasurement QuantitativeValue A measurement of an item, For example, the inseam of pants, the wheel size of a bicycle, the gauge of a screw, or the carbon footprint measured for certification by an authority. Usually an exact measurement, but can also be a range of measurements for adjustable products, for example belts and ski bindings. hasMerchantReturnPolicy MerchantReturnPolicy Specifies a MerchantReturnPolicy that may be applicable. Supersedes hasProductReturnPolicy. height Distance or\n\nQuantitativeValue The height of the item. inProductGroupWithID Text Indicates the productGroupID for a ProductGroup that this product isVariantOf. isAccessoryOrSparePartFor Product A pointer to another product (or multiple products) for which this product is an accessory or spare part. isConsumableFor Product A pointer to another product (or multiple products) for which this product is a consumable. isFamilyFriendly Boolean Indicates whether this content is family friendly. isRelatedTo Product or\n\nService A pointer to another, somehow related product (or multiple products). isSimilarTo Product or\n\nService A pointer to another, functionally similar product (or multiple products). isVariantOf ProductGroup or\n\nProductModel Indicates the kind of product that this is a variant of. In the case of ProductModel, this is a pointer (from a ProductModel) to a base product from which this product is a variant. It is safe to infer that the variant inherits all product features from the base model, unless defined locally. This is not transitive. In the case of a ProductGroup, the group description also serves as a template, representing a set of Products that vary on explicitly defined, specific dimensions only (so it defines both a set of variants, as well as which values distinguish amongst those variants). When used with ProductGroup, this property can apply to any Product included in the group.\n\nInverse property: hasVariant itemCondition OfferItemCondition A predefined value from OfferItemCondition specifying the condition of the product or service, or the products or services included in the offer. Also used for product return policies to specify the condition of products accepted for returns. keywords DefinedTerm or\n\nText or\n\nURL Keywords or tags used to describe some item. Multiple textual entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas, or by repeating the property. logo ImageObject or\n\nURL An associated logo. manufacturer Organization The manufacturer of the product. material Product or\n\nText or\n\nURL A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. mobileUrl Text The mobileUrl property is provided for specific situations in which data consumers need to determine whether one of several provided URLs is a dedicated 'mobile site'.\n\nTo discourage over-use, and reflecting intial usecases, the property is expected only on Product and Offer, rather than Thing. The general trend in web technology is towards responsive design in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established url property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all url markup to use mobileUrl for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily Product and Offer) have extra URLs hosted on an additional \"mobile site\" alongside the main one. It should not be taken as an endorsement of this publication style. model ProductModel or\n\nText The model of the product. Use with the URL of a ProductModel or a textual representation of the model identifier. The URL of the ProductModel can be from an external source. It is recommended to additionally provide strong product identifiers via the gtin8/gtin13/gtin14 and mpn properties. mpn Text The Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. negativeNotes ItemList or\n\nListItem or\n\nText or\n\nWebContent Provides negative considerations regarding something, most typically in pro/con lists for reviews (alongside positiveNotes). For symmetry\n\nIn the case of a Review, the property describes the itemReviewed from the perspective of the review; in the case of a Product, the product itself is being described. Since product descriptions tend to emphasise positive claims, it may be relatively unusual to find negativeNotes used in this way. Nevertheless for the sake of symmetry, negativeNotes can be used on Product.\n\nThe property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most negative is at the beginning of the list). offers Demand or\n\nOffer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.\n\nInverse property: itemOffered positiveNotes ItemList or\n\nListItem or\n\nText or\n\nWebContent Provides positive considerations regarding something, for example product highlights or (alongside negativeNotes) pro/con lists for reviews.\n\nIn the case of a Review, the property describes the itemReviewed from the perspective of the review; in the case of a Product, the product itself is being described.\n\nThe property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most positive is at the beginning of the list). productID Text The product identifier, such as ISBN. For example: meta itemprop=\"productID\" content=\"isbn:123-456-789\". productionDate Date The date of production of the item, e.g. vehicle. purchaseDate Date The date the item, e.g. vehicle, was purchased by the current owner. releaseDate Date The release date of a product or product model. This can be used to distinguish the exact variant of a product. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. size DefinedTerm or\n\nQuantitativeValue or\n\nSizeSpecification or\n\nText A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured SizeSpecification; in other cases, the width, height, depth and weight properties may be more applicable. sku Text The Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), i.e. a merchant-specific identifier for a product or service, or the product to which the offer refers. slogan Text A slogan or motto associated with the item. weight QuantitativeValue The weight of the product or person. width Distance or\n\nQuantitativeValue The width of the item. Properties from Thing additionalType Text or\n\nURL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text or\n\nTextObject A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or\n\nText or\n\nURL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or\n\nURL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or\n\nURL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details.\n\nInverse property: mainEntity name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork or\n\nEvent A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.\n\nInverse property: about"
