        "text": "History of the Hatchback\n\nThe first hatchback vehicle was manufactured in 1938, with a two-piece tailgate. It wasn’t until after WWII that the design changed to a one-piece tailgate, with a hatchback that attached to the roof of the car, much like today’s designs. Today, nearly every car manufacturer on the market has its own hatchback design, making it easy for you to find the right model to fit your needs.\n\nThe body style of the hatchback has changed over the years and continues to evolve based on the car manufacturer. The typical style is a type of a saloon with a more squared-off roof. The shape of the roof makes it easy for a hatch to attach to the back of it that can be lifted. This takes the place of a standard boot."
