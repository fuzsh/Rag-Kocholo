Convertibles come in various designs, with some using automatic hydraulic or electrical actuators for a smooth and effortless conversion process.\n\nInformation\n\nPopular convertible models include the Mazda MX-5, BMW Z4, and Chevrolet Camaro.\n\nSedans\n\nSedans are the quintessential family cars.

Electric vehicles, known as EVs, make the most of the incredible efficiency of electric motors. They’re already improving all types of cars: faster yet more efficient, cheaper to power but able to charge at home, and they allow for creative ways to design interiors, improving space, safety, and handling. However, challenges to green cars persist, such as the high cost and weight of batteries and the lack of widespread dependable charging stations. The industry is actively working to address these issues.\n\nHybrids\n\nA hybrid vehicle runs on two different energy sources, usually electricity and gasoline. These cars often use the gasoline engine to charge batteries that power electric motors. Some hybrids, called plug-in hybrids, can also charge from a wall socket, like fully electric cars. Electric motors are more efficient than gas engines, so when a hybrid uses electric power, it saves a lot of fuel. Many hybrids can run only on electric power for short trips, letting you do errands without using gasoline.\n\nLuxury Car\n\nLuxury cars are all about comfort and extravagance. They’re pricey and loaded with the latest comforts for a smooth ride. While they boast powerful engines, they might not excel in speed on winding roads or tracks because they tend to be heavy due to their many comfort features. Some luxury cars can also be supercars or sports cars, generally known for being costly and incredibly comfortable.\n\nInformation\n\nExamples include Bentley Continental GT, Ferrari Portofino, and Rolls-Royce.\n\nTrucks\n\nTrucks outsell SUVs in the U.S. despite SUVs having more variations. Initially, pickup trucks were primarily used for work, transporting crews and their tools in an open bed behind the cab.

Nowadays, with family-friendly quad-cab designs, pickup trucks are among the most popular vehicles on the road. They now offer improved efficiency, comfort, and capability compared to passenger cars and to their earlier versions.\n\nTourer/ Touring car\n\nTouring cars, prevalent in the early 20th century, seated four or more passengers and lacked a fixed roof, offering minimal weather protection. The folded top created a “fan” behind the rear seats. In the U.S., these cars evolved into four-door models with convertible tops, like Ford’s iconic Model T. However, the popularity of touring cars diminished as enclosed vehicles became more affordable. In British English, a “tourer” refers to any open car. The torpedo, a distinct tourer style, boasted a straight waistline from front to back, distinguishing it within the tourer category.\n\nPickup Truck\n\nPickup trucks have become increasingly popular lately. They typically feature a cab for passengers and an open cargo area. Unlike most, the Honda Ridgeline has its cabin integrated into the frame.

Hardtops come in various styles, including sedans, coupes, and SUVs, catering to different preferences and needs.\n\nFastback\n\nThe fastback is a car body style characterized by a sloping roofline that smoothly transitions into the vehicle’s rear. This design gives the car a sleek and aerodynamic appearance. Fastbacks are often associated with sports cars and high-performance vehicles. The aerodynamic shape of fastbacks improves their fuel economy and efficiency and reduces drag, resulting in better acceleration and handling.
