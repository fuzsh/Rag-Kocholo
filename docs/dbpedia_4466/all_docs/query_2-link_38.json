        "text": "The main difference between a hatchback and a sedan is the number of boxes that make up the vehicle body. Sedans are built on a 3-box body and have a separate trunk, while hatchbacks are built on a 2-box body with a connected hatch. Sedans also typically come as a 4-door, while hatchbacks feature 3 or 5 doors, with the hatch counting as a door.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore the differences between hatchbacks and sedans, shedding light on their benefits and potential disadvantages so that you are equipped with the information to help you determine which option is right for you.\n\nWhat is a sedan?\n\nLike a hatchback, sedans are usually designed to accommodate up to 5 passengers. But sedans are built on a 3-box body, where one box houses the engine, the next box the passengers, and the third is for the trunk. Since the trunk is separate from the passenger area—and typically smaller than that of a hatchback—the rear roofs of sedans tend to slope more dramatically toward the trunk than the roofs of hatchbacks.\n\nLearn more about what makes a sedan a sedan in our article: What Is a Sedan?\n\nWhat is a Hatchback?\n\nAs mentioned above, hatchbacks are built on a 2-box body. What this means is that one box houses the engine, while the other box holds the passengers and the cargo area, with a hatch that opens upward. The combined passenger-cargo box is the hatchback’s defining feature and gives the hatchback the ability to hold more cargo than your typical sedan, especially if you can fold down the vehicle’s rear seats. Hatchbacks frequently seat up to 5 passengers but come in a variety of sizes and trims.\n\nLearn more about what makes a hatchback a hatchback in our article: What Is a Hatchback?\n\nWhat is the difference between a hatchback and a sedan?\n\nSedans and hatchbacks are often lumped together since they are both smaller cars but, as you’ve started to see, they do have elements that make these classic car types quite distinct. Let’s look at these a little closer.\n\n● Cargo space: The high profile, combined passenger and cargo box, and rear liftgate design of a typical hatchback means that this car type generally offers more cargo space than sedans\n\n● Headroom: Although both car styles can accommodate a similar number of passengers, hatchbacks often provide more headroom—particularly for rear passengers—due to their higher profile and their roof design.\n\n● Legroom: Larger, full-size sedans tend to have longer body styles compared to hatchbacks. These longer profiles often tend to result in more legroom for passengers.\n\n● Maneuverability: The longer profile of the sedan can make it harder to maneuver in tight urban spaces than a hatchback—but keep in mind that sedans and hatchbacks are both smaller cars, especially when compared to conventional trucks and SUVs.\n\n● Noise: Hatchbacks may have slightly more road and wind noise due to their open cargo area design—passengers are seated in the same compartment as the cargo area, which is located over the rear wheels. Sedans, with their walled-off trunk spaces, thus often have better noise insulation and provide a quieter cabin experience.\n\n● Availability: Hatchbacks are more popular in other parts of the world, particularly Europe, so dealers in the U.S. may keep fewer units and trim levels in stock. Sedans will typically have more on-hand variety compared to hatchbacks.\n\nBuyer’s tip: While the above is true for more classic designs of sedans and hatchbacks, it’s also true that there are some models that blur the lines between these two car types. For example, some hatchbacks are intentionally designed with a smaller hatch, which in turn leads to a roofline that slopes in the rear like a sedan and ultimately creates less rear passenger headroom. For this reason, it’s always wise to test drive any vehicle you’re interested in and to look up the specifications of the models you’re interested in purchasing.\n\n2024 Mazda3 2.5 Turbo Sedan Premium Plus and Mazda3 2.5 Turbo Hatchback Premium Plus shown.\n\nShop the Mazda3 sedans and hatchbacks\n\nWhile there may be some differences, choosing between a sedan and a hatchback ultimately comes down to your needs and desires for your next vehicle.
