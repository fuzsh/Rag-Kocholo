        "text": "Whether you’re a novice casually browsing the market for a new car or a fully-fledged petrolhead, there’s a good chance you’ve heard the term ‘hatchback’.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, a hatchback is a type of car featuring a boot lid that swings upward to provide easy access to the boot compartment. Some people assume that any small city car is considered a hatchback, although this is not always the case.\n\nIn this article, we’ll take a more detailed look at what defines a hatchback, the various types available, their features, benefits and drawbacks.\n\nWhat is meant by ‘hatchback’?\n\nThe term ‘hatchback’ usually refers to smaller cars with a boot lid that incorporates the rear window, with a hinge at the top. A hatchback has, in effect, an additional full-height door at the back. That’s why you’ll often see cars described as three or five-door, even though you’ll only ever get in and out via the doors at the side.\n\nIs an SUV considered a hatchback?\n\nIn technical terms, there are plenty of cars that have a hatchback boot that you might not refer to as a hatchback. Estate cars, for example, have hatchback boots, but are usually called estates. The same logic applies to SUVs, as they have a different body style beyond the boot lid - and aren’t classified as hatchbacks based on other elements of the design.\n\n4-wheel drive hatchbacks in the UK\n\nThere are numerous 4-wheel drive hatchbacks available, including the 2022 Polestar 2 and certain hot hatches, such as the Mercedes AMG A45 and the Audi RS3. These offer all the benefits of a standard hatchback, with improved traction on uneven terrain, making them ideal for off-roading.\n\nWhat is the difference between a hatchback and a saloon?\n\nThe key feature that distinguishes a saloon car from a hatchback is the boot. On a saloon car, the boot lid hinges beneath the rear window, whereas on a hatchback, it hinges at the top. Additionally, saloons are often more expensive than hatchbacks due to their larger sizes.\n\nIs a hatchback a coupe?\n\nCoupes have a sloped roof tapering to a sharper point, giving a more aerodynamic and flowing look than the typically boxy, flat-roofed hatchbacks. However, larger coupes such the Audi A7 are sometimes also classed as hatchbacks because of the way their boot opens.\n\nSmall five-door cars\n\nA five-door car has two front and two back doors on either side, as well as a hatchback boot. Hatchbacks are mostly small five-door cars, suitable for city driving or for families who require some extra space, without the potentially cumbersome nature of an SUV.\n\nThree-door hatchbacks\n\nMany three-door cars are hatchbacks, with the exception of coupes. A three-door car has just one door on each side for the driver and passengers to use, as well as a boot."
