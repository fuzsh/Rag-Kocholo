        "text": "Mercedes-Benz A-Class - Renault\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz A-Class is already in its fourth generation. Since the launch of the latest model, the manufacturer has been offering several engine options. In the A180d, under the hood is a 1.5-liter dCi Renault diesel engine, also used by Dacia and Nissan. In the premium hatch it generates 116 horsepower (86 kilowatts) and 192 pound-feet (260 Newton-meters) of torque.\n\nAlfa Romeo Giulia QV - Ferrari\n\nThe Alfa Romeo Giulia QV is the only real Italian rival for the high-performance German compact premium sedans. To achieve 510 hp (380 kW), the Giulia QV relies on a 2.9-liter V6 biturbo engine developed jointly with Ferrari.\n\nBMW 116i (F20) - PSA\n\nBMW and the French group PSA collaborated to develop the engines from the EP family. These are 1.4-liter (EP3) and 1.6-liter (EP6) motors, found in some Mini, BMW 1 Series / 3 Series, and PSA Group cars.\n\nPagani Huayra - Mercedes-AMG\n\nThe Pagani Huayra is an Italian supercar that was introduced in 2011. Under its beautiful body, there is a V12 engine that comes directly from the workshops of Mercedes-AMG. Depending on the version, this engine develops different levels of power. In the range-topping Pagani Huayra BC, this V12 offers no less than 789 hp (588 kW)!\n\nAston Martin Vantage - Mercedes-AMG\n\nAston Martin has recently introduced its new supercar, better known as the Vantage. Like its bigger brother, the DB11, it gets a 4.0-liter V8 biturbo engine from Mercedes-AMG.\n\nLamborghini Huracan Performante - Audi\n\nThe Lamborghini Huracan Performante is one of the fastest supercars on the Nurburgring. The Italian sports car's performance is possible thanks to a V10 FSI engine, which is also found under the hood of the Audi R8.\n\nDonkervoort D8 GTO-RS - Audi\n\nThe Donkervoort D8 GTO is a car that, like any Lotus, is hunting for unwanted pounds. This car weighs less than 1,543 pounds (700 kilograms), and is powered by Audi's 2.5-liter five-cylinder turbo engine. We find this same engine under the hood of Audi RS3 and TT RS.\n\nLotus Evora - Toyota\n\nThe Lotus Evora was launched in 2009 and is still available on the market today. Its V6 engine is developed by Toyota and delivers up to 436 hp (325 kW) in the Lotus Evora GT430.\n\nIn the marvelous automotive world, it is not uncommon for a model to borrow its engine from another manufacturer, especially in the mainstream segments. The examples are numerous, and this is especially true for manufacturers owned by a single large conglomerate.\n\nIf you take the Volkswagen Group for example, the Volkswagen Golf GTI shares its 2.0-liter turbo engine with several other performance models from brands within the group, including the Skoda Octavia RS and SEAT Leon FR.\n\nBut sometimes, even manufacturers with different philosophies and from different families decide to collaborate and exchange technologies, engines, platforms, and components. In the next couple of slides we will present you 10 such models, which have the engine of another manufacturer â€“ and these are not only mainstream, everyday cars. To discover them, click the \"Next\" button at the top right."
