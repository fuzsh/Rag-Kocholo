        "text": "Disclosure: This site may receive compensation from some link clicks and purchases.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, U.S. automakers scrambled to build more fuel-efficient vehicles in the wake of spiking gasoline prices. Pontiac, for one, had no subcompact offering, so they rebadged a Chevrolet Vega and called it the Astre (“star”). It remained in production until 1977 when General Motors moved on to something else. This 1975 Astre GT isn’t your ordinary little grocery-getter – it has a 262 cubic inch V6 sandwiched under the hood! Located in Grand Park, Illinois, the restomod of sorts is available here on Craigslist for $6,500. Rocco B. continues to deliver great tips!\n\nThe Astre would not be the first time Pontiac borrowed from Chevy to fill a product void. They had done so just a few years earlier with the Ventura II, a Nova by another name. Though a few minor styling differences separated the Astre from the Vega, the Pontiac used the same trouble-prone inline-4 the Chevy did. The Astre started in Canada in 1973-74 and arrived in the U.S. in 1975-77. Sales were below those of the Vega, at less than 148,000 units vs. more than two million of the Chevy (though that car included four more production years).\n\nThis “Poncho” was on the receiving end of a 4.3-liter V6. It also has a 700R automatic transmission with overdrive. We don’t know when this transformation took place, but the seller says that no cuts in the firewall were needed to squeeze the bigger engine inside. But you have to wonder how hard it might be to get at some of the spark plugs! To add even extra power, a 4-barrel Q-Jet carburetor sits atop a high-rise manifold that the hood may have been modified to close properly. Headers and a dual exhaust are also part of the mix.\n\nThe body and paint look good on this Pontiac, though we don’t know if any exterior cosmetic work has been done. The interior is acceptable though worn in terms of the upholstery on the driver’s bucket seat (after all, the odometer has flipped over). We’re told this hot rod runs and drives great and should be an eye-raiser for Saturday night cruises or Cars & Coffee. Perhaps this is the kind of Astre/Vega that GM should have built?"
