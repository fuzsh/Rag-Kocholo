        "text": "In the crowded automotive market, there are 10 basic types of vehicles. Sedans and hatchbacks both fall into the category of \"passenger cars,\" vehicles that are neither a truck, a minivan, or an SUV. But while it was once easy to tell a sedan from a hatchback, that's no longer the case. Let us clear up the confusion for you, as we explain each type's key characteristics and their pros and cons.\n\nSedan\n\nThe Volkswagen Jetta is the sedan version of the Golf.\n\nThe current definition of a sedan is much the same as it's always been: a passenger car with four doors and a separate trunk. A trunk is a wholly enclosed cargo hold, separated from the passenger compartment by the rear seatback and the immovable package tray below the rear window. Many sedans do offer a fold-down rear seatback that opens a pass-through to accommodate large objects that wouldn't normally fit in the trunk. But with the seatback in its upright position, the trunk is sealed off from access and prying eyes.\n\nSedans are described as having \"three-box\" bodies: the front box is home to the engine; the middle box is larger and houses the passengers; and the third box, located in the rear, is the trunk. These are the classic proportions of a sedan and have been for more than 70 years.\n\nHatchback\n\nThe squared-off Volkswagen Golf is a direct descendant of the econoboxes of yesteryear.\n\nDeciding what is and what is not a hatchback, however, isn't as easy. Not long ago, hatchbacks were small, cheap, boxy, economy cars—Car and Driver coined the derisive term \"econobox\" to describe them. They were called \"two-box\" cars, with the engine up front in the first box and a second box for the passengers and cargo area—but no trunk. Hatchbacks had either two or four doors and a one-piece flip-up tailgate, called a hatch, on their squared-off tails. Cars like the early VW Golfs, Renault Le Cars, Ford Escorts, and Dodge Omnis were typical of that breed.\n\nMazda 3 Hatchback\n\nToday, most small hatchbacks are hardly what we would call econoboxes; they're much sleeker, with stylish rooflines that sweep gently down to their rear bumpers. They're well-built, often nicely appointed inside, and in some cases, anything but cheap. Examples of newer hatchbacks include the Mazda 3, Honda Civic Sport, Hyundai Elantra GT, and Toyota Corolla hatchback. Volkswagen has stood by its squared-off, traditional two-box design for the Golf, though the model has been given much more modern styling. (If you want a Golf with a trunk, VW offers the Jetta.)\n\nThe New Generation\n\nBut hatchbacks have also grown up—way up, into an entirely new breed. Today, there are numerous vehicles that might pass for four-door sedans but in fact have a rear hatch incorporated into their low, sleek roofline that flips up to reveal a large cargo hold. These cars tend to be compact or mid-size sporty or luxury-oriented cars. The list includes cars like the Audi A5 Sportback and A7, Buick Regal Sportback, Kia Stinger, and Mercedes-AMG GT53.\n\nKia Stinger\n\nTheir lines are sexy, and their roofs slope into what could be taken for a small trunk. Confusing things further, manufacturers refer to some of these cars as four-door coupes, because their low, fastback rooflines recall the look of two-door sports coupes or sports cars of the past. It may be marketing mumbo jumbo, but one thing's for certain: these racy cars are indeed hatchbacks.\n\nMercedes-AMG GT53\n\nCargo Capability\n\nBeyond differences in how hatchbacks and sedans look, the biggest difference in what they provide an owner is found in their relative cargo-hauling capabilities. For a given-size car, a hatchback body style can carry larger pieces of cargo and can be loaded and unloaded more easily than a sedan. A hatchback's large, flip-up rear hatch door opens to a tall, unimpeded space because there's no package tray in the way.\n\nThe wide-open hatch and cargo area of this VW Golf hatchback enables it to handle bulkier objects than the VW Jetta's smaller trunk (seen in the photo below).\n\nMost hatchbacks have either a solid, swing-up package tray or a soft pull-out cargo-area cover to hide valuables from view—both of which are easily removed. The large hatch door enables tall, bulky objects that you could never fit into a sedan's trunk to be slid into the rear of the car once the rear seat is folded (virtually all hatchbacks have fold-down rear seats). Flip the rear seat down, and a hatchback morphs into a mini-SUV.\n\nThe size of the VW Jetta's trunk opening and the height of its rear package tray limit its cargo-carrying capability compared with its Golf sister ship (seen above).\n\nThe size of the objects you can load into a sedan's trunk is limited by both the rear-deck opening when the lid is raised, and by the height of the rear package tray, which is fixed in place at the bottom of the rear window. That also keeps you from piling cargo high, much like you can in an SUV.\n\nHatchback Pros and Cons\n\nHatchbacks come with two minor potential downsides. If a hatchback lacks a cargo cover, then whatever is in the wayback will be visible to passersby. And because the rear area of a hatchback isn't sealed off from the rest of the cabin as well as it is in a sedan, some additional road noise can seep in.\n\nWith Chevy's Cruze and Ford's Focus regrettably dead, few automakers today offer both sedan and hatchback versions of the same model. One that does is Honda, whose compact Civic hatchback boasts 22.6 cubic feet of cargo room with the rear seat up, versus 15.1 cubic feet of trunk space for the sedan. Fold the Civic hatchback's rear seat down, and that cargo area swells to 46.2 cubic feet of cargo space. Of course, you can pile extra cargo into the rear-seat area of a sedan, especially if the parcels are smaller. But a hatchback almost always will be more flexible and better able to accommodate larger, bulkier objects.\n\nIf you're in the market and trying to decide between hatchback and sedan models, we advise researching to narrow your choices—as always. But then it's imperative that you visit car dealers to check out the models you're interested in. And be sure to take an extended test drive. Brochures, measurements, and test numbers can tell you only so much. Experiencing the differences between hatchbacks and sedans yourself is the best way to make a final decision."
