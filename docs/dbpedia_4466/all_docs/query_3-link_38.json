        "text": "Hatchback overview\n\nThere is some debate about the hatchback vehicle’s origins, with some people arguing the first hatchback was developed by a French automobile brand in 1938. In the vehicle, the trunk had a rear door with a split configuration that allowed the bottom half to be folded down (like a tailgate) and the top half to be folded up (like a traditional hatchback). However, because of this unique split configuration, some argue the vehicle wasn’t a true hatchback and that the actual first hatchback was invented by a different French automaker in 1965.\n\nToday’s hatchbacks come in a variety of models typically with 3 or 5-door options. The defining characteristic of a hatchback is a hatch in the rear of the vehicle, which makes them convenient for loading cargo into the trunk. Additionally, hatchbacks may allow you to fold down the rear seats to increase the cargo space even more, which can be helpful when transporting bulky items. Passengers will also notice a spacious interior, which comes from the vehicle’s higher roofline. The unique design of hatchbacks allows them to feel spacious inside, but are easy to maneuver like small vehicles.\n\nHatchbacks are well known in the U.S., but they’re more common in other parts of the world, like Europe. So while many hatchbacks are on the market and available in the U.S., there may be fewer options than other vehicle types, for those who are seeking them.\n\nHatchbacks vs SUVs and CUVs\n\nSUVs are also typically built on a 2-box body and with cargo and passenger room in mind—so what makes them different from hatchbacks? Historically, SUVs have been built using a “body-on-frame” method, in which the car body and chassis (the load-bearing part of the car) are constructed separately, then attached. Among other things, this makes it easier for SUVs to handle driving in rough terrain. Meanwhile, hatchbacks and sedans are built using the unibody method, in which the chassis and body are constructed as a single unit. However, crossover SUVs, also called CUVs, are built using the unibody method, making this distinction less clear (you can learn more about this in our article on SUVs.) The next biggest differentiator is the size, shape, and ground clearance of SUVs and CUVs vs. hatchbacks; SUVs and CUVs typically have a taller and boxier frame than hatchbacks, but smaller compact and subcompact SUVs and CUVs continue to blur this distinction.\n\nPros and cons of hatchbacks\n\nIf you’re interested in purchasing a hatchback, here’s a quick list of advantages and potential disadvantages to consider.\n\nAdvantages\n\n● Adaptable cargo spaces: Hatchbacks provide easy access to cargo areas through their rear hatch. In some models, the cargo area can be made more expansive by folding down the rear seats.\n\n● Maneuverability: Hatchbacks run on the smaller side compared to many mid- and full-size SUVs or trucks, making them easier to park and navigate through congested city streets or tight parking spaces.\n\n● Higher roofline: Hatchbacks often sit taller than sedans, featuring more headroom for passengers in the cabin, particularly those in the rear seat.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n● Inventory: Hatchbacks are less common than other vehicle types in the U.S .; lower demand can sometimes mean lower inventory, which means less availability of stock at some dealers.\n\n● Aerodynamics: Hatchbacks may not always be as streamlined as sedans, which can reduce their fuel efficiency and impact how often you fill up your tank.\n\n2024 Mazda3 Hatchback pre-production models with options shown throughout"
