        "text": "Seller is Probably Correct that his is the only 1 left. The H-body community had been wondering if any still existed for along time when this one appeared last year.\n\nBought from the original owner by a Chevy guy that was going to make a drag car out of it until he found out what he had. Sold for about 1/2 the current asking price last year. Neat car but it is only a Spoiler and stipe package done by a outside vender and sold thru Pontiac Dealers. The only thing it is missing is the odd rear 1/4 glass louvers. Nice looking car. But I would not dream of paying any more than $5000.00 for it.\n\nI spoke to Jim Wangers about these cars years ago, he claims they built 3000 I don't think they actually Built 300 of them myself.\n\nI was disappointed to learn that every car they actually built was Silver, non of the optional colors of the last flyer I posted made it into production. Also every car was equipped with the base 1bbl Engine, and every car had an automatic trans. I have found that the 2bbl equipped cars with a 4 or 5 speed trans can be fun to drive. But I test drove a single 1bbl automatic car and it was so sloooow I never looked at another one.\n\nSo these cars were the best example of the 70's Stripe and Spoiler performance cars I can think of. Jim Wangers is still an ad man so I should consider the source of the car.\n\nhttp://seattle.craigslist.org/see/cto/4692224710.html\n\nHere's the Sales Brochure\n\nAnd some shots from Jim Wangers of the original Prototype\n\nAnd of the Artist conception of a Possible Wagon Version that was never Built."
