        "text": "There are only a few other human inventions that have had such a phenomenal evolution journey as cars. Starting from being just a mere faster mode of transportation to having such a glorious legacy over the years. Along this journey, one aspect of cars that has diversified and changed dramatically is how they look. With the advancements in technology and engineering and also with the changing preferences of customers, cars have evolved from being a boxy machine to some of the most iconic sculptures.\n\nImagine a world having just one type of car, of a similar shape. Well, that world would be plain boring and also impractical as just one type of car cannot cater to the unalike needs of people. So thank god for cars with different shapes and sizes. And today, we take a look at some of the most popular car body types that have around for quite some time.\n\nFun Fact: Most of the names of the car body types are derived from popular vintage horse carriages due to certain similarities in configuration, styling and purpose.\n\nSedan/Compact Sedan\n\nWhen someone says the word “car” to you, chances are that the first image that comes to your mind of a sedan. The sedan is the longest existing body style. It is named after an ancient chair carriage. A sedan is characterised as a three-box configuration design with four-doors and a closed roof.
