        "text": "In the realm of car battles, the estate vs. hatchback one is definitely worth discussing. Both of those vehicle types are renowned for their practicality and overall high quality. However, there are some areas where there is a clear distinction between them. Those differences can make or break your choice of which vehicle body type you should hire. Today, we’ll tackle this very subject in our article.\n\nThe main difference between both body styles is the design. An estate car is a longer vehicle that boasts an extended rear end, which results in a large boot space. Hatchback cars, on the other hand, have a compact and trendy appearance.\n\nThere are many reasons for the hatchback car’s popularity but its compactness and practicality are the main factors of great interest. Its most famous model, the Renault 4, was such a hit in Europe that it sold over seven million units.\n\nEstate vehicles generally have more cargo space due to their extended rear ends. Both hatchback and estate car models are widely used in Britain, and each of them comes with its own benefits.\n\nDue to their large size, estates can be adapted to various needs. You can use them for family vacations or to transport bulky objects. They’re also very practical, prioritising space over everything else. Hatchbacks are also very practical. Their compact size makes them useful if you’re living in larger cities. You’ll have the privilege of being able to park in tight spots and navigate high-traffic roads with ease.\n\nYes, the estate can offer you premium features like a bigger boot, but those (as with everything in life) will come at a higher price than you’d have to shell out for a hatchback. If you count every penny and aren’t ready to spend a fortune on a new car, hatchbacks won’t empty your bank account.\n\nWhether you should hire or buy an estate car or a hatchback will depend on your personal needs and preferences. Larger families and professionals who need more cargo space and legroom should choose an estate car. But if you’re frugal and looking to save money, a hatchback is the perfect vehicle. It’s also suitable for those who reside in urban areas.\n\nIf you’re a stylish person who cares about appearances, you might prefer to drive a hatchback. Their sleek and modern look is sure to catch attention. Sporty fans will be particularly drawn to the aesthetics of sportback cars. To learn more about this type of car, click here.\n\nIt’s been a wild ride in this estate vs. hatchback breakdown, and now you have enough information to decide who your winner is. Both of those can be a great choice, depending on what exactly you need a vehicle for. Whether you want to hire an estate for its spaciousness or a hatchback for its practicality, one thing is sure- you’ll get value for your money with these vehicles."
