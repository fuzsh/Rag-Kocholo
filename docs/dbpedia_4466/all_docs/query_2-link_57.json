        "text": "No matter how desirable they may be, you can't buy these vehicles in the U.S.\n\nPeugeot\n\nQuickTakes:\n\nNissan Micra\n\nChevrolet Orlando\n\nVolkswagen Amarok\n\nPeugeot Landtrek\n\nRam 700\n\nKia Rondo\n\nToyota Hiace\n\nMercedes-Benz C-Class Wagon\n\nSuzuki Swift\n\nChevrolet Tornado\n\nDue to the safety and emissions regulations governing vehicle importations to the United States, not all automakers go through the time and expense of certifying their full lineup for the U.S. market. Even within North America, some cars are sold exclusively in Canada or Mexico due to their particular appeal to customers in those countries.\n\nIf you're curious about vehicles that weren't ever sold here but can be found north and south of the U.S. border, take a look at these 10 examples of automotive forbidden fruit.\n\nNissan\n\nNissan Micra: 2015 to 2019\n\nCanada loves its small cars, which gave the Nissan Micra an advantage it didn't enjoy in the U.S. market. Arriving for 2015 and discontinued after the 2019 model year, the Micra was a commuter hatchback with a 109-horsepower four-cylinder engine and an available five-speed manual transmission. For its final year, the Micra started at about $10,000, and to take advantage of its lightweight agility and low starting cost, the Nissan Micra Cup racing series was designed around the car.\n\nChevrolet\n\nChevrolet Orlando: 2012 to 2014\n\nThe Chevrolet Orlando was a small people mover that resembled a mix between a crossover and a minivan. Originally intended for sale in North America, the Orlando was shipped exclusively from its South Korean factory to Canada, where it was sold between 2012 and 2014. The Chevy featured a 174-hp four-cylinder engine, an uninspired interior, and three rows of seating stuffed into its compact confines. Pricing started around $20,000.\n\nVolkswagen\n\nVolkswagen Amarok: 2010 to Present\n\nFor truck fans, it might come as a surprise that Volkswagen has been selling a midsize pickup called the Amarok in Mexico for more than a decade. Redesigned for 2022, it rides on the platform used by the global version of the Ford Ranger, and despite being shorter, it actually has the same wheelbase. In Mexico, the Amarok is currently available with a 224-hp V6 diesel and costs around $50,000.\n\nPeugeot\n\nPeugeot Landtrek: 2020 to Present\n\nThe most intriguing thing about Peugeot's midsize Landtrek pickup is that it's not a French vehicle. The Landtrek was developed with Changan, a Chinese automaker, to be exported to markets including Mexico, South America, and Africa. The truck uses a 210-hp turbocharged 2.4-liter engine, comes with a choice of manual or automatic transmission, and is available exclusively in a four-door crew cab body style. With a starting price around $36,000, the Landtrek is a fascinating example of a company not known for pickups taking advantage of a global alliance to exploit a profitable segment.\n\nRam\n\nRam 700: 2020 to Present\n\nThe Ram 700 is a compact pickup that's smaller than the Ford Maverick and sold only in Mexico. Featuring a Firefly 98-hp 1.3-liter three-cylinder engine, the front-wheel-drive trucklet is found exclusively with a five-speed manual transmission. It can haul up to 1,653 pounds, and is based on the same platform used by the European-market Fiat Strada. Pricing for the pint-size Ram starts around $18,000.\n\nKia\n\nKia Rondo: 2013 to 2017\n\nAlthough the Kia Rondo disappeared in the U.S. following its second generation, Canada received an updated version of the small crossover for the 2013 model year. The Rondo's story continued with a new 164-hp four-cylinder engine, two rows of seating, and an affordable purchase price of around $22,000.\n\nToyota\n\nToyota Hiace: 2019 to Present\n\nToyota has never tested the commercial van waters in the U.S. In Mexico, however, it enjoys respectable sales of the Hiace, which is also one of its more popular Japanese-market models. The Toyota Hiace retails for about $37,000 and features up to 12 passenger seats across multiple removeable rows. Think Ford Transit but with a Toyota badge, and you've got the right idea. The Hiace is available with either a 174-hp 2.8-liter I4 diesel or a 277-hp V6, and it can also be ordered in a Super long window model that includes a trio of sliding windows to keep riders feeling breezy.\n\nMercedes-Benz\n\nMercedes-Benz C-Class Wagon: 2018 to 2021\n\nMercedes-Benz currently only offers the midsize E-Class to U.S. buyers. But Canada briefly retained the smaller C-Class wagon, thanks to the C300 4Matic and C43 4Matic editions, which carried a starting price of around $53,742. The latter, tuned by AMG, is the more exciting of the pair, as it features a 385-hp twin-turbo V6, and rear-biased all-wheel drive.\n\nSuzuki\n\nSuzuki Swift: 2017 to Present\n\nBack in the early 1990s, the Suzuki Swift was best known to U.S. buyers as the Geo Metro. Eventually, the global edition of the tiny hatchback evolved into a model that, like the Nissan Micra, was an affordable commuter. In Mexico, the Swift is currently available with a four-cylinder engine or a Boosterjet 108-hp turbocharged three-cylinder. The Swift's starting price is around $18,000.\n\nChevrolet\n\nChevrolet Tornado: 2015 to 2020\n\nSold until 2020, the Chevrolet Tornado was a direct competitor to the Ram 700 in the Mexican micro-truck market. This single-cab runabout featured a useful cargo bed, a thrifty 105-hp four-cylinder engine, and a five-speed manual transmission. While its load capacity was a bit lower than the Ram (1,615 pounds), it made up for it with a purchase price of around $18,000, slightly undercutting its competitor.\n\nBenjamin Hunting\n\nBenjamin Hunting is a writer and podcast host who contributes to a number of newspapers, automotive magazines, and online publications. More than a decade into his career, he enjoys keeping the shiny side up during track days and always has one too many classic vehicle projects partially disassembled in his garage at any given time. Remember, if it's not leaking, it's probably empty."
