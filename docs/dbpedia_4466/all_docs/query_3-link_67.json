        "text": "Young working adults, college graduates, and empty nesters in Pueblo County need a commuter car that’s affordable, efficient, and reliable. For many shoppers at Southwest Motors, a sedan or hatchback fits the bill. Which vehicle type would be best for you: a hatchback or a sedan? Here are the differences to consider.\n\nCargo space\n\nMost sedans and hatchbacks are built on the same platforms with the same underpinnings. The primary difference comes from the form and dimensions of the rear end.\n\nThe Honda Civic Sedan versus Civic Hatchback body shapes provide a great example. Both models have the same wheelbase, width, and peak height. However, the hatchback has 24.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear row instead of only 15 like the sedan. That’s because of the roofline extends further to give the rear end a boxier shape on the hatchback.\n\nTrunk accessibility\n\nIn addition to the extra cargo room, hatchbacks also can accommodate wider items. Their fifth-door hatch has an opening that’s wider and taller than the narrow trunk on the sedan. The hatchback’s lift-up door is twice as big as the sedan’s decklid because it incorporates the rear window glass.\n\nImpact on passenger space\n\nIn a hatchback, the cargo area is technically part of the passenger compartment instead of being fully enclosed and separated from the passenger space. Engineers consider the trunk a separate compartment on a sedan but not the hatchback.\n\nPassenger space is typically unaffected between hatchback and sedan bodies, providing comparable seating space for passengers. Sometimes hatchbacks offer more headroom for rear-seat passengers because of the square, horizontal roofline, whereas the sedan’s roofline slopes down gradually for longer.\n\nDriving comfort and performance\n\nSedans are longer and have an extended rear overhang that imitates the shape of the front end. This form and weight distribution typically make sedans more balanced and have greater stability around turns. Sedans also tend to have less road noise because the rear axle is below the segregated trunk rather than the open hatchback area that reaches passengers’ ears.\n\nThe Civic sedan and hatchback have the same engine and transmission with equal power output, but the sedan averages higher mpg on combined city/highway driving (35 vs. 33).[1]\n\nAvailability and price\n\nBy far, sedans are produced in higher quantity and wider variety than hatchbacks here in the U.S. Here in America, sedans far outsell hatchbacks, so you’ll find 10 times as many sedan models on the market as hatchbacks. This abundance means sedans are more widely available, are abundant on the used car market, and have lower prices than hatchbacks. Hatchbacks have niche appeal and can hold a steady resale value but only if you can find an interested buyer.\n\nWhether you prefer a hatchback or a sedan, we sell both vehicle types here at Southwest Motors. Visit our used car dealership in Pueblo to buy one that suits your needs."
