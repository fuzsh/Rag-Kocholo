        "text": "Did you know that hatchback cars get their name from the 'hatch-type' design of the rear door? This door, which covers the boot space, is hinged at roof level and lifts upwards for easy access. As this boot lid is counted as an extra door, this is why you'll have a choice between a 3-door or a 5-door hatchback when you look for your next vehicle.\n\nThis design feature is one reason why hatchback cars are such a popular choice. It means their overall design is more compact if you compare them to saloons or other bodystyles. By making the most of the available space, hatchbacks are an incredibly practical car. They give you space to fit in passengers, as well as the flexibility of folding seats to increase the boot space.\n\nBut the compact design has other advantages too. Small hatchback cars are easier to park and drive in a busy city, while the fuel efficient engines you often find under the bonnet make them more affordable to run. You might also pay less (or even no) tax on newer used hatchback cars for sale, because of their lower emissions.\n\nFor learners, a hatchback car can make perfect sense thanks to their easy handling style. More experienced motorists, meanwhile, might well value their comfort and strong Euro NCAP safety scores. And don't forget how hot hatches are among the most iconic cars on the road. Think the Mini or the Fiat 500 for eye-catching examples of used hatchback cars that you can find here.\n\nWith the depth of choice available through AA Cars, it can be hard to decide exactly which used hatchback car is right for you. But don't worry - we can help you find the options that'll provide you with everything you need in your next vehicle. From our huge collection of used hatchbacks for sale, you'll be able to find the ideal option to suit your individual sense of style too.\n\nAre you a learner or newly-qualified driver? Small hatchback cars could prove the most effective choice. Fuel efficient engines, lower emissions, handling ease and more affordable running costs are likely to be important features you want. The Vauxhall Corsa or the Ford Fiesta are excellent examples of used hatchback cars for sale that fit this particular bill.\n\nDo you need a new runaround for the family - something that can handle the commute and the school run? With flexible boot space and comfortable interiors, hatchback cars are a surprisingly practical option for some. Models such as the Peugeot 3008, VW Golf, Audi A3 or Skoda Octavia are more than well-equipped - and buying used can get you exceptional value for your money.\n\nFor something a little sportier, however, a hot hatch is your best bet. Despite what might seem like a smaller engine, you can find used hatchbacks for sale that offer plenty of agility and pace to enhance your driving experience. The Seat Leon, Mazda 3 or even the SUV-styled Ford Focus have the potential to make you think again about what a used hatchback car is capable of.\n\nMost used hatchback cars listed for sale on our website - particularly the most recent models - come with an impressive range of features. Air conditioning, in-car entertainment systems, LED headlights and parking sensors are some of the advanced features you can find. But getting the right deal and best value in your next vehicle can mean a balance between features and price.\n\nFor a used hatchback car that comes with the latest features, you'll often have to pay a higher price. But if the car has a high mileage too, there's always a chance of finding a bargain. It's a good idea to look at the CO2 emissions figure too. If the vehicle was registered between March 2001 and April 2017, for example, you might not have to pay any vehicle tax at all.\n\nOne thing that you don't have to compromise on is how practical you need your next vehicle to be. Some of the options available will be better than others. So, if this is important to you, look for those used hatchback cars that come with more flexible seating arrangements in the back - are they split-folded, do they fold as one and can they create an extended, flat boot space.\n\nSome might even come with sliding rear seats so you can increase boot space without having to do without the kids' seating space in the rear.\n\nHow high is the rear bumper? Does the door frame rise higher than the floor? You may not give these features a second thought, but they could have an impact on how you get things in or out of your boot. You might not find it easy to slide heavier or bulkier items in over the bumper. It'll also leave the risk of scuffing the bumper or paintwork."
