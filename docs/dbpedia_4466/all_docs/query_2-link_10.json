        "text": "Vehicles, including passenger cars and truck-based SUVs, can be grouped into 20 vehicle types, from sedans to hatchbacks and pickups. It is easy to classify all types of cars.\n\nIt informs and guides you to better understand the special features of your vehicle. But sometimes it can be misleading.\n\nAs useful as this classification is, its usefulness should not prevent us from understanding the value and unique characteristics of a car. The easiest way to define a vehicle is its appearance.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice when a car approaches you on the road? This is called “body style”. Big and boxy? How many low and flat doors are there? The body style is the easiest way to categorize your vehicle.\n\nTypes Of Cars Body Style\n\nHere are the top 20 cars on the market, sorted by body style.\n\nSEDAN\n\nA sedan is a typical example of a four-door passenger car. Sedans often have a three-box design with the engine, passenger, and cargo in separate compartments for better weight distribution and a more stable ride.\n\nIn addition, the unibody structure significantly reduces the vehicle’s weight and improves fuel efficiency. This sedan does not have glass windows in the cargo compartment, which provides good protection for the cargo against theft.\n\nThis sedan has four doors and a regular trunk. As with many car categories, they range from small (subcompacts like the Nissan Versa and Kia Rio) to compact (Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla), midsize (Honda Accord, Nissan Altima), and full-size (Toyota Avalon, Dodge Charger). Luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz and Lexus have similarly sized sedans.\n\nCOUPE\n\nA coupe is a type of car defined by simplicity. The word “coupe” conjures up images of compact sedans. That is a two-door car with a trunk and a fixed roof. But the exciting attraction of this car is the sloping roofline that gives it a more stylish and sportier look.\n\nAs far as looks go, coupes are usually loaded with extra bells and whistles, from sharp handling to hundreds of horsepower. This coupe takes up minimal space and is an impressive minimalist car. Not together with family or friends. For single riders or couples who want to explore the world.\n\nPreviously, a coupe was considered a two-door car with a trunk and a fixed roof. This includes cars like the Ford Mustang and Audi A5, as well as two-seater sports cars like the Chevrolet Corvette and Porsche Boxster.\n\nRecently, however, automakers have started using the term “coupe” for four-door cars or crossovers with low, sleek rooflines that they consider “coupe-like.” This includes vehicles as diverse as the Mercedes-Benz CLS sedan and the BMW X6 SUV. But we still think of the coupe as a two-door.\n\nSPORTS CAR\n\nA sports car is a car designed with an emphasis on dynamic performance, such as handling, acceleration, top speed, or the thrill of driving.\n\nA sports car is a small luxury type of car designed for speed and minimal cargo and cabin space. It’s usually a two-seater and has high stats for handling and speed. Although the sports car is usually considered a luxury car, it is strictly designed for performance.\n\nBy definition, sports cars are two-seater convertibles that allow for open-air driving and have a sporty appearance.\n\nAutomakers have incorporated remarkable features such as nimble maneuverability, excellent acceleration, and great handling into their sports cars, contributing significantly to their huge amount of power and thrilling ride.\n\nCars like the Porsche 911 and Mazda Miata are typical sports cars, but you can expand the definition to include muscle cars like the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger.\n\nThen there are the exotic high-end dream cars with sky-high prices of one percent, cars like the Ferrari 488 GTB and the Aston Martin Vantage, which stop traffic with their spaceship look.\n\nSTATION WAGON\n\nMost notably, station wagons, also called estate cars, have a shape of an elongated version of a sedan, offering extra cargo space. The easier way to think about it is it’s a combination of a sedan and a hatchback.\n\nStation wagons are considered to be perfect for large families requiring a reliable hauler. Aside from extra space, station wagons provide better fuel economy in comparison to their SUV equivalents, too.\n\nSome, like the Subaru Outback or Audi A4 Allroad, have elevated ground clearance and some rugged body cladding to make them more like a sport-utility vehicle (SUV), but they are nonetheless closely related to sedans.\n\nWagons have fallen from favor during the past few decades and there are relatively few available for sale in the United States.\n\nHATCHBACK\n\nThe most noticeable part of a hatchback is its hatch or a rear door that swings upward. This types of car usually come with two or four doors, excluding the trunk’s door. Hatchbacks are very similar to sedans, with both categorized as passenger cars.\n\nThe biggest difference between them is their cargo capacity. Hatchbacks typically haul more pieces of cargo compared to their sedan counterparts.\n\nMoreover, you can remove bulky shopping bags or other heavy pieces more easily. If you prioritize increased cargo capacity and better fuel economy, then a hatchback can be a good fit for you.\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf and Kia Rio are two typical hatchback models. More recently, hatchbacks have made their way into some larger cars like the Audi A7 and the Kia Stinger.\n\nThey look like sedans, but they actually have a steeply sloping tailgate that provides easier access to the cargo space and greater load capacity than a conventional trunk.\n\nCONVERTIBLE\n\nConvertibles have been known for their recognizable aesthetics and loving design for decades. These types of cars have been popular for decades because they became icons of cinema and symbols of freedom and youth.\n\nThey have retractable canopies and minimal passenger cabins that sometimes only accommodate two people. They also have a small hold.\n\nCan the roof retract into the body and leave the passenger cabin open to the elements? If so, it’s a convertible. Most convertibles have an all-electric fabric roof that folds down, but some have to be lowered by hand.\n\nThere are also a number of models with a retractable hardtop as well as some unusual quasi-convertibles (so-called “Targa-Tops”) such as the Mazda MX-5 Miata RF, Porsche 911 Targa and Corvette; only the front part of their roofs can be retracted or removed by hand.\n\nSPORT-UTILITY VEHICLE (SUV)\n\nA Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) is defined by its off-road capabilities and roominess. These types of cars are built with a long journey in mind.\n\nIt boasts a comfortable ride in rough, rugged cross-country terrain. It offers a relatively high seating position which allows a better view of the road.\n\nThese functionalities have been made possible by its sturdy body-on-frame construction that is borrowed from trucks. Hence, if you are one of those who enjoy outdoor adventure and expect to tow dirt bikes, an SUV might be best suited to you.\n\nThey include a station wagon-like cargo space accessed through a flip-up hatchback door, and many offer all-wheel drive. The larger ones have three rows of seats.\n\nSizes start at small cars (Hyundai Kona, Nissan Kicks), ranging from medium to full size (Ford Expedition, Chevrolet Tahoe). Luxury brands offer many SUV models in most of the same size classes.\n\nMINIVAN\n\nWhen designing minivans, the focus is usually on the size of the cabin space rather than the size of the storage space. These types of cars are often associated with station wagons and family cars.\n\nIt was made with the specific idea of accommodating a whole family in it. It has a lot of cargo space, but not much compared to the hatchback.\n\nMinivans are the workhorses of the world of family cars, the best way to move people and cargo in one efficient package. They are called minivans, but they are far from “mini”.\n\nThat’s because they’re tall boxes on wheels with sliding side doors for easy access and a tailgate that opens up to large cargo space.\n\nMost minivans have reclining second and third-row seats that can often be removed or even folded into the floor to create huge open cargo space. The Honda Odyssey and Chrysler Pacifica are great examples of this breed.\n\nPICKUP TRUCK\n\nA pickup is one of the most recognizable types of cars in the world. It is distinguishable from other automobiles due to its distinct design. Its cargo space is completely divided from its cabin space and it usually seats no more than 3 or 4 individuals at a time.\n\nA pickup truck has a passenger cab and an open cargo bed in the rear. Virtually all pickups offer some form of all-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive the latter for off-road use only. With one exception the mid-sized Honda Ridgeline pickup bodies are cabs mounted to a separate steel frame.\n\nThe Ridgeline is more like a crossover with the rear section of the roof lopped off to expose a cargo bed. Currently, pickup trucks come in two size categories: full-size and mid-size.\n\nJEEP\n\nJeep is like Kleenex. It’s a product model that’s become synonymous with an entire product line. Jeep, as a model, is designed and built by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The Jeep hit the scene in November 1940, just before the USA entered WWII.\n\nThey were widely used throughout the war and subsequent wars due to their ability to travel on all kinds of terrain.\n\nIn 1987 Chrysler bought the Jeep brand and has expanded the models ever since. While the traditional design is still popular, Chrysler also developed the SUV model Cherokee.\n\nELECTRIC CAR\n\nI cannot wait to lease my next car, which will be an electric car. This is an exciting time because, over the next few years, most automobile makers will be rolling out many electric car options. Audi, Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes are all rolling out a fleet of electric cars.\n\nTesla, of course, is the current top dog in the arena but will be facing tougher and tougher competition over the next 5 years. GM’s Volt is also a good option.\n\nWhile I like Tesla’s designs, it doesn’t come close to how cool the first Porsche electric car looked. Check it out… Mission E. What I love about Mission E is it’s a 4 door and still looks super cool. I have young kids so a 2-door is out of the question.\n\nCROSSOVER\n\nIf we had to summarize crossovers in a single phrase, it would be “a combination of an SUV and a hatchback”.\n\nCrossovers have the practicality of an SUV but also come with superb fuel efficiency like hatchbacks do, as they are built on a unibody construction that is lighter and consumes less fuel.\n\nSPYDER\n\nThe Spyder is a type of car that has two seats and the appearance of a sports car. It has many variants, one of which is the popular Lamborghini Spyder. Its use has spread all over the world and is recognized as a luxury car.\n\nThere was a time when it was used as a racing car in the United States Auto Club during the 50s and 60s. The Spyder is also often called the Roadster, which was originally used to describe a horse that is suitable for traveling on open roads.\n\nOriginally the Spyder was only fit for one person to ride, but it has gradually adapted to the two-seater model that is internationally known.\n\nHOT HATCH\n\nThe hot hatch car is a high-performance car that takes its design from the hatchback. It has the same door that swings open in the back and a similar shape.\n\nThough not as spacious or large as the hatchback, it can still fit up to 5 passengers and quite a bit of cargo. It began being manufactured in the late 1980s and is a favorite among consumers in Europe and Asia.\n\nLIMOUSINE\n\nA limousine is considered one of the most luxurious cars in the world. These types of cars are noted for its large length and the partition between the back and the front.\n\nThe limousine is driven by a chauffeur in most cases and is pre-booked for formal affairs. Limousines are usually owned or used by movie stars, businessmen, dignitaries, or politicians.\n\nUTE\n\nA UTE, an abbreviation of utility, is a term for a car typically purchased in Australia and New Zealand for cars standing behind the passenger cabin.\n\nIt can be driven with a regular driver’s license. It was originally used to refer to cars built on passenger car chassis with the bed attached to the passenger body.\n\nAny vehicle with an open cargo area at the rear is now referred to as a UTE in the New Zealand-Australia region.\n\nPONY CAR\n\nThe Pony car has its roots in the Ford Mustangs of the 1940s and 50s. These types of cars were wildly popular in the 1960s and even broke sales records in the US.\n\nIt created the pony car craze and was designed as an affordable, compact, and highly stylized alternative for Americans.\n\nIt was a direct consequence of customers’ interest in small cars that had sporty and luxurious designs.\n\nSPORTS SEDAN\n\nThe Sports Sedan or the Sports Saloon is a very subjective term for a car. It is designed for great performance and impeccable handling features. The term goes back to the 1930s and includes the Rover 14 and 16 cars.\n\nSports Sedan was a term that began being applied to sports versions of cars for different manufacturers in the 1960s. The originals used manual transmissions and rear-wheel drives. However, as time passed, a number of other transmission types and layouts became common.\n\nSome important cars that fall into the category are the BMW M5, the Jaguar XJR, the Maserati Quattroporte, and the Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG.\n\nMILITARY VEHICLE\n\nMilitary vehicles are designed for combat and endurance on the battlefield. They are designed to withstand bullets and blasts and are equipped with extensive armor and protection.\n\nCapable of transporting soldiers, ammunition, and lots of cargo, they run at top speed while transporting cargo.\n\nDRAGSTER\n\nDragsters are modified racecars. With modified engines, they are specially built for drag racing. They were first built during the 1960s and fitted with front-engine rails, and slingshots. Dragsters can be supercharged or turbocharged based on their designs.\n\nThey can run on alcohol, natural gas, or a mixture of nitromethane and gasoline. Rear engine dragsters have now become the standard dragster design because of their durability and performance benefits.\n\nSHOOTING BRAKE\n\nThe Shooting Brake is a term for a vehicle with a specific body shape. It was once used for horse-drawn wagons used to transport rifle squads to their hunting grounds. The first with automotive capabilities were developed in the early 1900s.\n\nThey are known for their elongated sterns and large cabin spaces. They take several clues from the tailgate. One of the most commonly manufactured Shooting Brake cars is the Mercedes-Benz CLS.\n\nClassification Of Cars\n\nCars are classified into various categories depending on several factors.
