        "text": "A hatchback is a classification of vehicle with the defining characteristic being a “rear door” that swings upward to allow access to the cargo area. You may often hear hatchbacks referred to as “3 door” or “5 door” hatchbacks, as the back hatch is counted as a door. They differ from the standard wagon or estate vehicle in the sense that wagons typically are longer, taller, and have a steeper slope on the back door (typically, straight down).\n\nYou can see the difference between a sedan, a wagon, and a hatchback depicted below:\n\nThe top image is the typical sedan, or what is sometimes referred to as a “3-box” design – 1 box for the engine, 1 box for the passengers, and 1 box for the cargo. Hatchbacks and wagons instead sport a 2-box design, in which the passengers and cargo “share” a box. The notable difference between wagons and hatchbacks is the length, as well as the addition of the D-pillar in the rear.\n\nIn more recent years, you may see cars labeled as “fastbacks” or “liftbacks.” These are hatchbacks that have an extremely-sloped rear roofline, giving it a more sporty, sedan-like appearance while having the increased practicality of a hatchback. Some modern examples include the Audi A7, the Kia Stinger, and even the Tesla Model S.\n\nSo why is demand for SUVs so high when hatchbacks (and even wagons) exist? Well, for a long time, the demand wasn’t that high. Early SUVs that were sold to consumers in the 1980s, 1990s, and even 2000s were more expensive than their smaller counterparts and were extremely inefficient.\n\nThey were typically body-on-frame SUVs – meaning their body panels and steel frame were assembled separately, then put together – which drove like the trucks they were based on (clunky and rough). Add to this the fact that minivans (and some station wagons) were all the rage for their perfect combination of practicality and efficiency, SUVs were a tough sell to many families.\n\nBut that all changed when crossovers were introduced.\n\nCrossovers – like the name suggests – is essentially a cross between an SUV and a car. It takes the space, (most of the) size, and practicality of an SUV, but utilizes manufacturing techniques, platforms, and even engines from cars. To be specific, a crossover is a type of automobile with an increased ride height that is built on a unibody chassis as opposed to typical body-on-frame SUVs.\n\nMany “SUVs” today are actually crossovers – the Toyota RAV4 is actually often credited as the first crossover SUV! Other examples include the Honda Pilot and CR-V, Nissan Rogue, Volkswagen Tiguan, the BMW X3, X4, X5, X6… we could go on. There are definitely still traditional body-on-frame SUVs out there – like the Ford Expedition and Chevrolet Tahoe – but consumers appreciate the efficiency and car-like mannerisms/maneuverability of crossovers.\n\nSo, these “SUVs” that consumers are fawning over, like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, are actually more similar to their car counterparts than their truck counterparts… sounds like a hatchback to me…\n\nIf you can forego the extra few inches of ground clearance that a crossover or SUV offers, a hatchback is a really good alternative. In some cases, the hatchback and crossover may have more similarities than you think.\n\nFor example, the Subaru Crosstrek and the Subaru Impreza look nearly identical, and when you compare those 2 cars in the TrueCar Compare tool, you see that their similarities go even further. The perks of the hatchback? In this case, multiple thousands of dollars less in MSRP and better fuel efficiency."
