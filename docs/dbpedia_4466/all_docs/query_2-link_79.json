        "text": "There are several types of cars circulating in the Indonesian automotive market, such as city car, MPV, SUV, hatchback, and sedan. Each car has a fan, so does the hatchback and the city car. People often consider that hatchback and city car are similar, but they are different. Then, what are the differences between hatchback cars and city cars? Now take a look deeper at this article.\n\nThe Difference between Hatchback Cars and City Cars\n\nThere are at least three differences between hatchback cars and city cars. The first difference is the car dimension. If it is seen from the sizes or the car dimension, hatchback types tend to be longer than city car types. That makes the hatchback has more roomy cabin space. The second difference can be seen from the interior sides and the car features which are pinned by car producers.

Thus, the price of hatchback cars is more expensive than city car types.\n\nThe third difference is in the engine capacity. The size of a city car tends to be smaller than a hatchback. This makes the engine capacity used is smaller. To understand more about these two car types, it is better to know about their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe Strengths and Weaknesses of Hatchback\n\nHatchback cars are identical to youngster cars since their sizes are quite small.
