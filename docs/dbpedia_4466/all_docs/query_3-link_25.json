        "text": "Some of the types that are available in India include hatchback, sedan, SUV, crossover, MPV/MUV, sportback, coupe, SUV coupe, convertible and pickup truck.\n\nBHPian Aditya recently shared this with other enthusiasts.\n\nWhich one is your preferred body style and why?\n\nCars come in various body styles. Manufacturers are continuously looking to attract more customers by coming up with new body styles. While some would prefer an SUV for its butch looks, some prefer small hatchbacks and others want the exclusivity that a coupe or convertible gives. Here's a look at some of the body styles that cars available in India come in.\n\nHatchback\n\nSome of the cheapest cars you can buy today are hatchbacks. They have a shorter wheelbase and are smaller in size than other types of cars. This means that they are easier to drive and park in crowded cities. If the rear seatbacks are folded, a hatchback can carry a good amount of cargo too.\n\nComing to the drawbacks, since the cars are small in size, interior space is limited, especially at the rear. Also, with all seats occupied, the boot is smaller in size compared to other cars. Apart from this, many hatchbacks have low roofs making ingress & egress difficult.\n\nSedan\n\nSedans, in general, have more cabin space than hatchbacks, making them more comfortable. They also have more boot space than hatchbacks and you can keep your luggage out of sight of others in the covered boot. Out on the open roads, these cars ride and handle well making them fun to drive.\n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks to be considered as well. Because of the extra length (due to the boot), these cars are not as easy to drive and park in crowded areas. They have low roofs which hamper ingress & egress. Many sedans ride low and have poor ground clearance.\n\nSUV\n\nPeople love SUVs for their commanding driving positions. Their large size gives them an advantage on our roads where \"might is right\" and other road users tend to give you way. SUVs have a lot of space on the inside, and usually also get a third row of seats. Most have four-wheel drive and high ground clearance which makes them capable off-roaders. Their large wheels and chunky tyres help them tackle bad and broken roads with ease.\n\nOn the downside, their size makes SUVs cumbersome to use in the city and because of their high floor, ingress & egress are an issue, especially for the elderly. The cars are bulky and have lower fuel efficiency. They are not very good to drive on the road either and many of them have a bouncy ride.\n\nCrossover\n\nCrossovers are generally just hatchbacks with more ground clearance and plastic cladding and roof rails which lend them a rugged look. Those who find SUVs too large, but still want a rugged-looking car, will find them appealing. The increase in roof height also aids ingress & egress and the higher ground clearance helps them tackle high speed-breakers and broken roads with ease.\n\nHowever, very few crossovers come with all-wheel drive (let alone four-wheel drive) and that means they may not be as capable as traditional SUVs off the road and not as good to drive on the road as sedans or hatchbacks due to their taller stance. Crossovers are usually 5-seaters and rarely get a 7-seater option which makes them less practical than SUVs.\n\nMPV / MUV\n\nRecently, we had a thread on why MUVs / MPVs are the most competitive body style today. They come with higher seating which means a better view of the road and seating for 5-7 people. Their large size & butch styling along with commanding road presence is important in India where \"might is right\" on the road. They have large and powerful engines and high ground clearance which is necessary to deal with the large bumps and uneven & unpaved patches of road - a common problem in India.\n\nHowever, like SUVs, the highway manners of these cars are also not as good as other body styles. Besides, many of them have a utilitarian image which may not go down well with urban buyers. Again, due to their large size, driving and parking in crowded cities will be a problem.\n\nSportback\n\nA sportback is a sedan with a sloping rear end to give it a sleek and sporty look. Such cars are rare in India and appeal to those wanting some exclusivity. These cars have a liftgate rather than a boot lid. This gives one a large boot opening.\n\nOn the downside, the sloping roof restricts headroom for rear seat passengers. Low-placed seats can make ingress & egress difficult too.\n\nCoupe\n\nCoupes are two-door cars with a low roof. They look sporty and usually feature powerful engines. They are more driver-focused. They bring exclusivity and desirability.\n\nOn the downside, coupes are expensive and low on practicality. Low seating means ingress & egress is not easy. Some come with rear seats but the rear headroom is compromised. Coupes also have low ground clearance which means the driver has to be careful while negotiating speed breakers and potholes.\n\nSUV Coupe\n\nBMW first came out with this new body style with the X6, combining the high ground clearance of an SUV and the sporty looks of a coupe. Very soon other players like Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Volvo introduced similar cars. SUV Coupes have seating for four and good luggage space.\n\nLike regular coupes, they are expensive and the rear headroom is compromised thanks to their sloping roof line. Their styling can divide opinions too. Rear visibility is poor as well.\n\nConvertible\n\nOne of the coolest body styles out there. Convertibles are exclusive and very desirable. With very few of them on our roads, you easily stand out. The biggest plus point of a convertible is the wind in your hair feeling.\n\nHowever, the cars are expensive and are generally heavier than coupes thanks to the roof mechanism and they also need extra strengthening for their chassis. Even with the modifications, many convertibles are not as sporty to drive as their coupe siblings. Convertibles can't be used regularly in dusty, hot or rainy conditions. Besides, most convertibles are suitable for two occupants rather than four.\n\nPickup Truck\n\nPickup trucks are popular in countries like the US and Australia where they are used as workhorses. Some of them have great off-road capability as well. They have seating for four and a large loading bay that can hold more cargo than any other car.\n\nJust like MPVs, pickup trucks suffer from the utilitarian image. They are also too big for Indian cities and parking a pickup truck can be very difficult. Additionally, if the loading bay does not have a cover, the cargo in it is at risk of being stolen.\n\nHere's what GTO had to say about the matter:\n\nMy picks:\n\nSedans, especially fast sedans. I love European sedans (Virtus, Octavia, 5-Series, M340i, S-Class)\n\nSUVs: Big & tough ones like the Thar, Scorpio-N, Safari, Endeavour are really my style. Great looks + practicality.\n\nCrossovers: We have such great crossovers in the market today! Among the affordable ones, I love the Kia Seltos & Nexon EV.\n\nCoupe: Will definitely own a Mustang, 911 or F-Car one day.\n\nNot my scene:\n\nMPV / MUV could never be my primary car due to the \"van\" styling & image. I am a sucker for vanity.\n\nSUV Coupe is just a way-too-confused & awkward bodystyle to my eyes.\n\nConvertible isn't my scene (unless it's a 4x4). I'd rather own a Cayman over a Boxster. There isn't a single sportscar I'd buy in convertible guise.\n\nPickup Truck: In the USA, yes, because of models like the F150 in luxury editions. In India, it's a pointless bodystyle, although very stylish.\n\nHere's what BHPian MotorDev had to say about the matter:\n\nVoted for Sedan.\n\nI still favour them over any crossover or SUV because of the generous boot space they provide and their appealing aesthetics. Plus, they handle quite nicely as well.\n\nHere's what BHPian vattyboy had to say about the matter:\n\nVoted for SUV Coupé\n\nLooks Delicious\n\nHere's what BHPian CArspeed had to say about the matter:\n\nIt’s Sedan for me for the following reasons:\n\nComfortable ride\n\nFlickable and agile\n\nThat proper car-like classic looks\n\nThe SUV may be good for the ingress and egress but my dad and other elders prefer my Altis to Compass since according to them they don’t feel tired in Altis even after a long ride plus their feet don’t swell in Altis since they are able to stretch their legs without bending it too much."
