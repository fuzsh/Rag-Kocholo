        "text": "Governmental agencies, businesses and others seeking to obtain information from motor vehicle records must complete a Mississippi Motor Vehicle Records Disclosure Form. This form will allow the applicant to designate the use of the information permitted pursuant to this rule. Once the applicant has been approved, the information may be obtained for a fee based on the number and type of records obtained. The cost is set by the Department of Revenue based on the cost to provide, maintain, and access the information required. The request for information should be mailed or faxed to the Department. Certain records may also be accessed through our internet query system. There is an annual fee to use this online system. Request for bulk information related to permitted uses should be submitted in writing to the Department.\n\nMiss. Code Ann. Section 27-19-3(25) provides that a “private carrier of property” means transporting property on Mississippi highways as one of the following:\n\n1. Any person, or their employee, transporting farm products produced on his own farm, farm supplies, materials, and/or equipment used in the growing or production of his own agricultural products in his own truck.\n\n2. Any person transporting his own fish, including shellfish, in his own truck.\n\n3. Any person, or their employee, transporting unprocessed forest products or timber harvesting equipment, wherein ownership remains the same, in their own truck.\n\nA motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of 10,000 pounds or less is to be registered at the county tax collector’s office in the county where the vehicle is domiciled or where it is parked overnight. A motor vehicle with a GVW over 10,000 pounds that only travels in Mississippi is registered at the county tax collector’s office in the county where the vehicle is domiciled. A motor vehicle with a GVW over 10,000 pounds that travels across state boundaries must be registered directly with the Department of Revenue.\n\nVehicles, which are used in business, shall be registered in the county, city and taxing district in which they are domiciled. If a business vehicle remains at the business location when not in use, the vehicle should be registered at the business location. If a business vehicle goes with an employee of the company, the vehicle should be registered where the employee is located. The vehicle is to be registered in the name of the owner but the address should reflect the correct location.\n\nTax collectors are not to register any vehicle in any county, city and taxing district other than the county, city and taxing district in which the vehicle is domiciled. If a vehicle is found to be registered in the wrong county, city or taxing district, then that vehicle is considered not to have been registered at all and the owner is liable for full annual taxes due in the correct county, city and taxing district plus a 25% penalty with no credit allowed for the incorrect taxes paid.\n\nAll applications for certificate of title for 1970 or later year model motor vehicles must be accompanied by the manufacturer’s certificate of origin, formerly known as manufacturer’s statement of origin, or the certificate of title unless the vehicle comes from a non-title state. A manufacturer’s certificate of origin from the selling dealer will be required with an application for a new vehicle purchased in a non-title state. The application for a used vehicle purchased in a non-title state must be supported by proper bills of sale and the last out-of-state registration or tag receipts.\n\nWhen a natural person carries on business as a sole proprietor, it is required in both the title application and in the certificate of title, that the name of the owner be stated as the name of the individual natural person, whether or not the trade name is added. The use of the trade name alone in the title application and in the certificate of title, without the name of the individual who owns the business, does not comply with the requirements of the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Title Act. The burden is put on the lender or conditional seller to find out whether the business name of his customer represents a corporation, partnership, association, or natural person.\n\nAn abandoned motor vehicle means a vehicle that:\n\n1. Has been left by the owner or on the owner’s behalf with an automobile dealer, repairman, or wrecker service and has not been picked up by the owner within forty (40) days from the agreed retrieval date. If there is no agreed retrieval date, the forty (40) days begins the day the vehicle is turned over to the dealer, repairman or wrecker service;\n\n2. Is left unattended on a public street, road or highway or other public property for at least five (5) days; or\n\n3. Has been lawfully towed to property owned by someone other than the vehicle owner, at the written request of a law enforcement officer and left there for at least forty (40) days without anyone claiming the vehicle.\n\nAny authorized person intending to sell an abandoned vehicle must notify the owner and any lienholder by certified mail within ten (10) days that unless a claim on the vehicle is made within thirty (30) days or before the scheduled sale, whichever is later, the vehicle will be sold. The ten (10) days begins to run when the vehicle actually qualifies as an abandoned vehicle. The party initiating the sale should use the last known address of both the owner and lienholder. Such information may be obtained from the Mississippi Department of Revenue (Department) or from another appropriate authority. Any information obtained from an authority other than the Department may not be complete. If the Department determines that all required notifications were not made, a new title will not be issued.\n\nIf the owner of a towed vehicle has not contacted the towing company within five (5) days of the initial tow, the towing company must obtain the names and addresses of any owner and lienholder from the Department or from another appropriate authority. If the information is not available from the Department or an appropriate authority, the towing company must make a good faith effort to locate ownership. The towing company must then notify the owner and lienholder by certified mail the amount due within ten (10) days following the initial tow. Any information obtained from an authority other than the Department may not be complete. If the Department determines that all required notifications were not made, a new title will not be issued.\n\nThe proceeds of the sale of such property, in excess of the amount needed to pay the towing and reasonable storage fees and the other necessary expenses of the sale, shall be held by the towing company for a period of six (6) months, and, if not reclaimed by the owner of the vehicle, shall become the property of the county and be paid to the chancery clerk of the county in which the sale was held to be deposited into the county general fund, subject, however to any rights of the recorded lienholder.\n\nWhen a motor vehicle is leased under a conditional sales agreement with the right of purchase or immediate right of possession available upon performance of the conditions stated in the agreement, the lessor is considered the owner and the registration and title will be issued in the name of the lessor in care of the lessee. The lessor of the vehicle is recorded on the certificate of title as first lienholder. If the lessor has given a security interest in the vehicle to a lender, the lender will be listed as the second lienholder. This type lease will be referred to as a Purchase Lease.\n\n“Salvage vehicle” shall mean a motor vehicle, which an insurance company obtains from the owner as a result of paying a total loss claim resulting from collision, fire, flood, accident, hail damage, trespass, un-recovered theft, or other occurrence. A motor vehicle which is ten (10) years old or older with a value of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) or less, or a motor vehicle with damage which will require the replacement or repair of five (5) or fewer minor component parts will not fall under the definition of salvage vehicle.\n\nIn the event an insured motor vehicle becomes a total loss and the insurance company becomes the owner of the motor vehicle and subsequently sells this vehicle to a salvage or junk dealer, the vehicle is considered as salvage and ceases to be a motor vehicle. The original title should be forwarded by the owner, properly filled out and signed, to the Department of Revenue along with the vehicle identification plate. If, on the other hand the vehicle is to be repaired, it would be brought within the definition of a motor vehicle. When the motor vehicle status has reached state of repair, the previous title must be attached to the application for certificate of title and properly assigned to the new owner. This, of course, would not be the insurance company because it would have surrendered all claims to said vehicle.\n\nInsurance Company to Apply for Certificate of Title:\n\n1. An insurance company that becomes the owner of a motor vehicle as a result of paying a total loss claim shall apply to the Department for a salvage title within seventy-two (72) hours after obtaining the insured’s certificate of title. Such application shall be made by the insurance company in the manner and in such form prescribed and provided by the Department. In order to obtain a salvage title, the insurance company must:\n\na.\n\nSurrender the current certificate of title and odometer disclosure statement with the title application\n\nb.\n\nSubmit documentation to show that the title application is for a salvage vehicle;\n\nc.\n\nSubmit with the application a signed statement written on company letterhead showing the type of occurrence:\n\n​i. collision damage;\n\n​ii. hail damage;\n\n​iii. flood damage;\n\n​iv. recovered theft; or\n\n​​v. unrecovered theft.\n\n​d.\n\nIndicate in the statement whether or not the vehicle will require replacement of six (6) minor component parts.\n\ne.\n\nStaple this statement to the certificate of title and note on the face of the certificate the type of occurrence.\n\n2. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a vehicle which is ten (10) years old or older with a value prior to the loss of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500), or less or which will require the replacement of five (5) or fewer minor component parts in the reconstruction process.\n\n3. If ownership of a salvage vehicle has not been acquired by an insurer, the owner must surrender the certificate of title for such vehicle to a designated agent of the Department prior to any sale or disposition of such vehicle and not later than thirty (30) days from the date that the vehicle becomes a salvage vehicle.\n\nInsurance Company May Re-assign Certificate of Title in Certain Cases:\n\nAn insurance company that acquires ownership of a motor vehicle in this state and is not required to apply for a salvage certificate of title as provided in Section 201 will use the First Reassignment by Licensed Dealer section on the back of the title to transfer ownership of said vehicle. The insurance company will list the purchaser, who may be the insured, a rebuilder or dismantler, in the reassignment section. The purchaser must attach to the certificate of title a signed statement which indicates the type of occurrence: collision damage, hail damage, flood damage, recovered theft or unrecovered theft. If the purchaser is a company, the statement must be on company letterhead.\n\nInspection of a Rebuilt Motor Vehicle Prior to Retitling:\n\n1. The owner/rebuilder of a motor vehicle which is described in a salvage certificate of title shall, after reconstruction in this state and before sale of such vehicle present the same to the Mississippi Department of Public Safety at an appointed date, time, and place for the purpose of inspection of said rebuilt vehicle.\n\na.\n\nThe owner/rebuilder must present his Application for Inspection of Salvage Vehicle, including Salvage Certificate of Title, notarized bills of sale for all major component parts used in the reconstruction process, and invoices for minor component parts used in the reconstruction process.\n\nb.\n\nBills of sale and invoices for component parts shall include the name of the person from whom parts were acquired, his address and telephone number, and in the year, make, model and vehicle identification number of the vehicle from which the parts were removed and sold. All such parts shall be described in the Application for Inspection for Salvage/Rebuilt Vehicle form.\n\nc.\n\nThe Department of Public Safety inspection officer shall endorse the application for inspection, or explain on said application the reason why retitling should not occur.\n\n​d.\n\nWhen the vehicle successfully passes inspection, the inspector will issue a Completion/Certification of Vehicle Inspection form. The rebuilder shall then apply for a certificate of title as the owner, and surrender the current title, Application for Inspection of a Salvage Vehicle, Completion/Certification of Vehicle Inspection, and proof of ownership of parts used in the rebuilding process.\n\ne.\n\nThe application for certificate of title shall also include the documentation as prescribed in Section 210 paragraphs 1 and 2.\n\n2.The inspection and certification shall include an examination of the vehicle and its parts, which the applicant for inspection has designated as replaced or repaired, to determine that the identification numbers of the vehicle or its parts have not been removed, falsified, altered, defaced or destroyed; that the vehicle information is true and correct; and that there are no indications that the vehicle or any of its parts are stolen. Such certification shall not attest to the roadworthiness or safety condition of the vehicle.\n\n3. Any vehicle branded as a salvage vehicle in another jurisdiction must be repaired and pass inspection in the other jurisdiction prior to bringing the vehicle into this state. The title application to retitle the vehicle in this state must be accompanied with the necessary documentation to substantiate the vehicle passed inspection in the other jurisdiction.\n\nDepartment of Revenue to Brand Title:\n\n1. There shall be “rebuilt” brand affixed to the certificate of title of a motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle, where the following are repaired or replaced in the reconstruction process:\n\na.\n\none (1) major and five (5) minor component parts;\n\nb.\n\nsix (6) or more minor component parts;\n\nc.\n\ntwo (2) or more major component;\n\n​d.\n\ncowl or firewall;\n\ne.\n\nboth the front-end assembly and a rear clip.\n\n2.There shall be a “rebuilt” brand affixed to the certificate of title of a motorcycle when one (1) component part listed in Section 108 above, is replaced in rebuilding the motorcycle.\n\n3. The rebuilder of a vehicle or motorcycle described in a Salvage Certificate of Title issued by this or any other state, or comparable ownership document of a vehicle which is capable of being rebuilt, must present documentation showing the parts that have been repaired or replaced.\n\n4. Brands that reveal a pertinent fact or facts about the vehicle, which appear on titles issued by this state or another state, will be maintained or carried forward on certificates of title issued by this state.\n\n5. The Department may brand a title with “Damage History”, “Flood Damage”, “Hail Damage”, or use other brands where appropriate.\n\n6. If vehicle damage is from collision or hail and no more than one (1) major and four (4) minor component parts or no more than five (5) minor component parts are repaired or replaced in the reconstruction of the vehicle, the new certificate of title shall be free of any brands.\n\nRetitling After Inspection\n\n1. The application for certificate of title shall be made by the owner/rebuilder in the same manner as provided in Section 204. A subsequent title on a flood or hail damaged vehicle shall be issued with a “Flood Damage” or “Hail Damage” brand affixed.\n\n2. A motor vehicle for which a salvage certificate of title or a certificate of title that contains a brand or sub-brand indicating “CERTIFICATE OF DESTRUCTION”, “JUNK”, “NON-REBUILDABLE”, or “PARTS ONLY”, was previously issued by any titling jurisdiction shall not be titled in this state.\n\nRebuilder Takes Ownership by Re-assignment of Title in This State:\n\nA rebuilder in this state who takes ownership of a vehicle by reassignment of title by an insurance company shall include with his application for a new certificate of title the documentation required in Sections 204 and 210, except a Department of Public Safety Completion/Certification of Vehicle Inspection form is not required. The Department may require inspection of any vehicle prior to issuance of a new certificate of title. On such requirement, the rebuilder shall proceed according to Sections 204 and 210, except the certificate of title reassigned to the rebuilder shall be attached instead of the salvage certificate of title.\n\nRepair and Titling Rebuilt Vehicle:\n\n1. Repair does not include cosmetic repair, such as surface scratches or blemishes to the painted finish, key dings, minor dents and scrapes to minor component parts when such are documented by color photographs as set out in Section 210 paragraph 2, whether the current title is “Salvage” or has been reassigned to a rebuilder by the insurer.\n\n2. The rebuilder must include with every Application for Inspection of a Salvage/Rebuilt Vehicle form a minimum of four (4) color photographs of the vehicle in its unrepaired condition. The photographs must be submitted with the rebuilder’s application so that they are available to the Department of Public Safety inspector at the time of the inspection. The photographs must be made as follows: one (1) from each of four different angles looking from a fender on a line diagonally to the fender on the opposite side and end of the vehicle taken from a distance not more than six (6) feet from the vehicle and clearly showing the back or front, side and top of the vehicle from each angle. The rebuilder may include additional photographs that the rebuilder deems necessary to show other areas of concern.\n\n3. If the photographs do not clearly show prior existing damage as claimed, repair of such damage will be counted as one component part for each such part(s) so repaired."
