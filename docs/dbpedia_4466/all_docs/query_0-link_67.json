        "text": "Back in high school my then-friend Clare inherited her aunt's '77 Sunbird coupe. She called me to come check it out, and being a Pontiac person I was excited to see it. Jumped in my blue '79 Bonneville and ran to her house. Got there, and it looked just like the car below, except it was dark brown with brown cloth interior. Same colors as my recently-departed 79 Electra.\n\nThis was around 1990-91, and this was New Jersey. Considering the age of the car and where it had lived, it was gorgeous. Not the styling, the condition. I liked the look of the front end, clearly a Pontiac, but the notchback roof was a little odd-looking...the fastback version of these looked worlds better.\n\nIt was clealy and old-lady car. Had that musty-perfume smell inside, but it was clean, had clearly lived in a garage, and with 87K miles showing on the odometer was in nice shape. It car had no rust, the paint shined, it had the nicer LJ interior with cloth high-back bucket seats that looked like something from a Firebird. Wood trim on the dash. The curved automatic shifter stuck out of a box below the dash...odd looking thing. The parking brake was a chrome lever that sat on the bare floor between the front seats. The dash had two big round gauges for a speedo and a fuel gauge. The rest were idiot lights.\n\nClare wanted to go see a movie in Morristown, and she handed me the keys to the Sunbird with a smile. On sitting in the car, I was surprised how small it was. The doors were long and heavy, but the roof was low, and we were nearly shoulder-to-shoulder in the car. The dashboard sat up really high too, making you feel like you were sitting on the floor. It had a fixed column, and the steering wheel sat really high...if ever a car needed a tilt, it was that one.\n\nThe next curious thing was the steering column itself. It had the same round GM steering column we all know so well, but the lock cylinder where you insterted the key was angled downward a bit, like the column had not been installed straight...but the turn signal lever sat level...so this was by design....weird.\n\nI turned the key, and the entire car shook to life. Shook...A Lot. This was my first meeting with The Iron Duke, the famous 2.5 4cyl GM used though the 80's. It has a square 2-jet carburetor, and when cold it barely idled.\n\nI pulled the odd-angled automatic into reverse, felt the shaking grow worse, and backed out. Pulling into traffic the engine was noisey and rough. Buzzy and course. It felt slow too, but was ok until I got on the highway headed north. The engine smoothed out at speed, but the car was just totally gutless....LOUD, and beyond 55 it felt/sounded like I might actually be hurting the car. It was flat not happy above 55.\n\nIt had the stock Delco AM/FM in it, no cassette. I turned it on and the sound was horrible...tinny and hollow. It distorted if you turned it up where you could actually hear it over the engine. After a while I just shut it off.\n\nWe got to the movie and back. Clare, not knowing any better at barely 17, asked me what I thought of the car. I told her it was in really nice condition and it was nice of her aunt to give it to her, and left it at that.\n\nI did check under the hood to make sure all the plug wires were attached that night. Everything was fine. It really just was that loud, weak and course. All I can say is it's amazing how BAD some of the cars from the 70's were. That Sunbird sure had a spud of a motor, and I never did get used to the odd interior packaging.\n\nShe drove that car a year...I personally never drove it again, we took my Bonny. She finally sold it when her Mom found her an '84 Delta 88 a friend was giving away. It only had a 3.8 V6 in it, but it was WORLDS better than that Sunbird.\n\n-Mike\n\nI understand the pain of driving an Iron Duke equiped car!!!!!! My mother had a 78 Pheonix with a 2.5 auto and every option known to man at the time, thank the Lord that the speed limit was 55 MPH at the time, as I think 63 MPH was about all that car could manage, but it did get 25 MPG and that was great at the time. She only drove it for a few months (between totalling her 76 455 powered GP and getting the 78 301 4-speed GP she had ordered, yes my Mom always like to shift her own gears!!!!!)\n\nSome shots of the steering wheel I just finished, The Formula Steering wheel was part of the Astre Formula Package, but believe it or not who ever ordered my particulare car actually paid $18.00 extra to not get a Formula Steering whell, and got a 3 spoke Delux wheel, as seen in the interior pic's. I did have a fairly nice Tan Formula wheel that someone had Dyed Red!!!! So the project was to remove as much of the red dye as possible, without damaging the rubber material\n\nAfter asking alot of opinions about cemicals or sand paper, someone suggested using a \"magic Eraser. It required quite a bit of elbow grease, but it removed the dye without damaging the wheel. And after redying it Camel it looked like this\n\nThe worst part of the wheel is the horn button, it is pretty dry rotted, but it will work for now. The next step was to find a center emblem to fill the spot that the T/A's Screaming Chicken emblem was. My choices were a very damaged Sunbird /Astre emblem, a repo 70-72 GTO Emblem for $90.00 or as Luck would have it this summer while junk yarding I ran into a early 80\"s T-1000 Sport!!!!! That had this emblem for the steep price of $1.00\n\nNext are some shots of the car being stripped of parts and paint.\n\nAnd Finally of the Base Yellow on after all the Visable metal interior panels are painted the proper shade of Camel.\n\nNow with the Yellow applied, and getting the Charcoal Accent panels applied."
