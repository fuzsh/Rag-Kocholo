        "text": "Hatchback Questions Answered\n\nWith an ever-growing car market, choosing the right car for you can be hard! Cars now come in every shape, size and style, from hatchbacks and saloons to SUVs and crossovers. With so much choice on offer, there is the perfect car out there for everyone.\n\nWhether you've decided on a hatchback, or still researching the best car for you, there could be many questions you feel need answering before taking the plunge. To help, we've put together a list of frequently asked questions to help make your used hatchback car buying journey easier.\n\nWhat is a hatchback car?\n\nWhat makes a hatchback different, is the car shape itself, or more specifically, the boot. Often the large boot space sits within the back of the car itself and incorporates the rear window with a hinge at the top. When the boot is opened, the back seats can then be folded down to expand the space.\n\nHatchbacks also come in three or five-door formation, offering even more choice. In comparison, a saloon car, with its elongated body, has a boot which acts as a separate compartment, with the boot hinging from underneath the rear window.\n\nIs an SUV, estate car, or coupe a hatchback?\n\nTechnically, yes, estate cars, SUVs and crossovers can count as a hatchback because of boot style. However, given other design features of these cars, we know them as other names that better describes them.\n\nOn the other hand, a coupe sits in a grey area, as they are generally a more sporty car with two doors and a sloped rear. Some have a hatchback boot, like a Volkswagen Scirocco, and others have a saloon boot, such as a BMW 2 Series, so it depends on the car you're looking as to whether or not it is technically classed as a hatchback.\n\nWhat is the difference between a Saloon and a Hatchback?\n\nA Hatchback incorporates the rear window with a hinge at the top, allowing a larger opening. In comparison, a saloon car, with its elongated body, has a boot which acts as a separate compartment, with the boot hinging from underneath the rear window.\n\nWhat's the difference between a three or five door hatchback?\n\nMany hatchbacks will offer a choice of body styles, with either three and five doors, with car manufacturers counting the boot as the third or fifth door. Sometimes a fifth door can be slightly larger, though mostly the differences between the two are mild, and choosing between them comes down to personal preference.\n\nA three-door car is known to be more dynamic in shape with two front doors, and if they have rear seats, these can be accessed by folding the front seats forward. These are often smaller city cars, such as the Peugeot 208, and are known for looking sporty. In comparison, a five-door car has four doors, two at the front and two at the back, offering easier access to the rear seats making it perfect for families. Often outselling their three-door counterparts, they continue to be top-selling vehicles in the UK.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a hatchback?\n\nThere are several benefits to owning a hatchback in comparison to other car styles including:\n\nLarge boot opening and versatile folding seats.\n\nTraditionally easier to park than a saloon car given the rounded rear.\n\nOften, manufacturers will have a variety of hatchbacks across their range so there is plenty of choice.\n\nWhat are the drawbacks of a hatchback?\n\nAlthough the majority of drivers will love hatchbacks, there are some disadvantages to be aware of, such as:\n\nDue to some boot sizes, the back seats can be cramped with less legroom.\n\nAs the boot space is open to the cabin, you are more likely to hear road noise compared to the enclosed boot of a saloon car\n\nWhat is the fastest hatchback?\n\nKnown as hot hatchbacks, there are plenty of options out there for drivers looking for a bit more speed. These more powerful versions of the traditional family car are ever-evolving, with manufacturers often bringing new models to the market to compete for the top spot. Although measured by their 0-62mph speed and engine size, some will still debate which car is the best hot hatchback. There are still a few cars you might hear mentioned as the fastest around, including:\n\nMercedes AMG A45 - With more than 400bhp, the A45 uses its 2 litre engine to do 0-62mph in just 3.9 seconds, and reach a top speed of 168mph. With this vehicle, you can enjoy power with all the luxury and comfort Mercedes has to offer.\n\nToyota GR Yaris - Completely different from its namesake, this GR Yaris three-cylinder engine delivers 257bhp to do 0-62mph in 5.5 seconds and is designed to offer you a rally-inspired road car experience.\n\nWith plenty of choice on the market, there is a hot hatchback for everyone. Why not read our Ultimate Guide to Hot Hatchbacks to find yours?\n\nWhich hatchback has the biggest boot?\n\nWhether you're a family constantly on the go, or an individual who loves packing up the car for long road trips, having a big boot to store the essentials is a must. Here a couple of hatchbacks with the biggest boot:\n\nPeugeot 308 - Giving you 501 litres of boot space, increased to 1,309 litres when the seats are folded down, you certainly won't be short of room! In addition, you'll find two under floor storage units in the boot which add 35 litres of space, perfect for hiding valuables out of sight.\n\nVolkswagen Golf - A popular choice, this VW offers 380 litres of boot space in either the three or five door design. With the addition of under-floor storage, bag hooks and a ski-flap for longer items, you don't need to worry about packing everything you might need for your next adventure.\n\nFor more information on these cars, or to explore other options, read our full guide: The best family hatchbacks with big boots.\n\nWhat is the safest hatchback?\n\nCar safety is always developing, with new materials and technology being introduced to reduce any injuries in the event of an accident. To ensure cars meet set conditions, the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) tests every new car to determine the level of safety that they provide, and give them a score out of five stars. Therefore, five-star rated cars are the safest and offers the best protection for the driver and passengers.\n\nIn the 2021 Car of the Year awards, it was determined that the Volkswagen ID.3 was the year's top scorer in the safety category and is one of VWs new pure electric vehicles. Following closely behind was the Toyota Yaris and Seat Leon, offering both affordability and safety, making either a great choice for your next car.\n\nAre hatchbacks cheap to insure?\n\nLike any type of car, the cost of car insurance varies depending on different factors, such as:\n\nDriving experience\n\nPast claims\n\nType of car\n\nAge/year of vehicle\n\nUsage\n\nHowever, there are certain cars, including hatchbacks, which can help reduce the cost of your insurance. By choosing a hatchback in a lower insurance group, your insurance premium could be less, so why not consider:\n\nCitroen C1 - This small hatchback offers a nippy 1.0-litre three-cylinder engine, and by sitting in insurance group one, could offer you the low-cost insurance you're looking for.\n\nFord Fiesta - As a great all-rounder, it's not surprising that the Ford Fiesta can offer you low insurance too.
