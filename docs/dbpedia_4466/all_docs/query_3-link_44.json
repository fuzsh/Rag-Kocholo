        "text": "Buying a new car can be challenging, whether you are a first-time buyer or a seasoned veteran. Since there are different car body types out there, it can be overwhelming for a person to fixate on a particular make or model and choose the best body type that fits their lifestyle and specific needs. Before buying a car, several factors must be considered – family size, fuel type, mileage, and price. Broadway Automotive dealership located in Green Bay, WI, has broken down the list of vehicle choices into nine categories by covering all basic types of vehicles in this buyer’s guide to different car body types.\n\nCar Body Types and Styles Explained\n\nOne of the easiest ways to define a vehicle by its looks is the shape, called the “body style” – tall or boxy, low or sleek, the number of doors it has – body style can define a vehicle easier. Let’s look into each one of the car body types.\n\nSedan: A sedan comes with four doors and a conventional trunk. Available in a variety of sizes from small subcompacts (Kia Rio, Nissan Versa) to compacts (Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic) to mid-size (Nissan Altima, Honda Accord) and full-size sedans (Dodge Charger, Toyota Avalon).\n\nCoupe: Considered a two-door car with a solid roof and a trunk, a coupe is a car like the Ford Mustang or Audi A5 and even includes two-seat sports cars like the Porsche Boxster and Chevrolet Corvette. However, these days the word “coupe” also refers to four-door cars or crossovers with low and sleek rooflines deeming their designs “coupe-like.”\n\nConvertible: A convertible lets the roof retract into the car body, leaving the cabin open to the outside elements. They possess a fully powered fabric roof that can fold down. However, some need to be lowered by hand, or some have a retractable hardtop. Examples include Porsche 911 Targa, Chevy Corvette, and Mazda MX-5 Miata RF.\n\nSports Car: Sports cars are sporty and cool coupes and convertibles with sleek and low-to-the-ground designs, which are expensive. Cars like Porsche 911 and Mazda Miata are examples of sports cars, but muscle cars like the Dodge Challenger and Ford Mustang also come into the limelight. Ferrari 488 GT8 and Aston Martin Vantage are the exotic dream cars in the sports cars segment, which are super-expensive.\n\nSport Utility Vehicle (SUV): Often referred to as crossovers, SUVs are taller and boxier than sedan cars and provide elevated seating positions with high ground clearance. It includes a station wagon-like cargo area accessed via a flip-up rear hatch door, and many SUVs provide an all-wheel drivetrain. Some popular SUVs are Hyundai Kona, Ford Expedition, Nissan Kicks, and Chevy Tahoe.\n\nStation Wagon: Station wagons are similar to sedans in look but come with an extended roofline and a hatch door at the rear. Audi A4 Allroad and Subaru Outback are examples of station wagons, and they have rugged body cladding and high ground clearance.\n\nHatchback: they are a compact or subcompact sedan with a rear flip-up hatch door, cargo access, and a squared-off roof. Though they may look similar to sedans, hatchbacks have a steeply raked hatchback with easy accessibility to the cargo area and higher carrying capacity. Some examples are Kia Rio, Volkswagen Gold, and larger versions like the Kia Stinger and Audi A7.\n\n[Read: Performance of the 2022 Hyundai Santa Fe – Green Bay, WI]\n\nMinivans: A favorite for large families, minivans carry a lot of people and cargo. They are tall, have sliding side doors for easy access, and a rear hatch opens to ample cargo space. They have adjustable seats in the second and third rows, which can be removed or folded into the floor to create large cargo space. Chrysler Pacifica and Honda Odyssey are some examples.\n\nPickup Truck: Extremely versatile and practical – pickup trucks are usually designed and built to last longer than regular vehicles. It will have a passenger cab and an open cargo bed in the back. Most pickup trucks offer all-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive for off-roading and come in two sizes – full-size and mid-size. Chevrolet Silverado, Toyota Tacoma, and Ford F-150.\n\n[Read: What Are the Performance Specs of the 2022 Ford Expedition?]\n\nVisit Broadway Automotive in Green Bay, WI"
