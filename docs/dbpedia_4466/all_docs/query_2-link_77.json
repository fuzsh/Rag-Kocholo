Find out what those terms mean and why your car's make and model matters.\n\nWhat Is the Make of a Car?\n\nThe make of a car is the brand that manufactures it. This includes companies like Ford, Honda, and Chevrolet.\n\nMany manufacturers around the world build cars. In the U.S., you can buy vehicles made by domestic, Japanese, Korean, and European car manufacturers.\n\nSome auto manufacturers produce two brands of vehicles: standard and luxury. For example, Acura is made by Honda. Acura is the luxury brand, and Honda is the standard brand. Despite being manufactured by Honda, they are sold at separate car dealerships.\n\nWhat Is the Model of a Car?\n\nThe model of a car is the specific product name. For example, a Corvette is a model made by Chevrolet. For a Honda Accord, Honda is the make and Accord is the model.\n\nThe model doesn't have to be a word. In the case of the Audi Q3, it can be a combination of letters and numbers.\n\nDomestic vehicles (those made in the U.S.) are the most popular cars in the nation. Asian imports come in second.\n\nIdentifying your car gets even more specific. Car models can come with different equipment and features. This is called the trim level. Learn more about the differences below.\n\nWhat to Know About Trim and Body Style\n\nWith any car, the base model is the trim level with the least equipment and features. A fully loaded model offers the most equipment and features. There are also trim levels in between.\n\nTrim is usually designated by letters or numbers after the model name. Some common ones are: DX, LS, or a series, like 300 or 500.\n\nTrim levels can affect:\n\nTransmission: automatic, automated manual, or all-wheel drive\n\nType of engine: powertrain and suspension\n\nSafety options: blind-spot monitoring, backup camera\n\nInterior features: material on the seats, navigation and entertainment systems, etc.\n\nThere can also be model versions with different body styles. Body style refers to the shape of a car: coupe, sedan, SUV, etc. For example, the Mazda 3 is available as a hatchback or a sedan.\n\nHow to Find My Car's Make and Model\n\nA vehicle's make and model is listed in several places. Here's how you can find yours:\n\nOutside of Your Vehicle\n\nThe back of your car should have the manufacturer's name on one side and the model on the other side. Plus, the car maker's logo is usually on the front and back of your car.\n\nOwner's Manual\n\nThe make and model of the vehicle is usually located on the cover of the owner's manual. Or, it can be found within its first few pages.\n\nTitle or Registration\n\nYour car make and model is prominently displayed on both documents.\n\nUse the Car's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)\n\nYou can enter your VIN into the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's VIN Decoder web page. It'll reveal your car's make, model, and other details.\n\nThe VIN is a 17-digit code made up of letters and numbers. It can be found:\n\nOn the driver's side of the dashboard where it meets the windshield\n\nOn the driver's side door jamb\n\nPrinted on your vehicle's registration\n\nCar History Report\n\nIf your car was preowned, you can get its make and model by requesting a vehicle history report from your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). You will need the car's title, VIN, and proof of identification.\n\nThe car history report contains:\n\nRecord of past ownership\n\nVehicle's title\n\nOdometer settings\n\nExisting liens on the vehicle\n\nPast maintenance\n\nYour car make and model tells insurance companies a lot about your future driving behavior. See how it could affect your rates below.\n\nHow Make and Model Affect Car Insurance\n\nDo you have expensive car insurance? It might have to do with your car. Auto insurance companies consider your car when setting your premium.\n\nBe sure to provide the entire model when you request an insurance quote. This includes all letters, numbers, and trim level indicators. You don't want rates for a higher-priced model when you have a lower one.\n\nHere are some ways your car make and model affect your rates:\n\nFactors That Raise Insurance\n\nThe car has a high value with higher costs for comprehensive and collision coverage.\n\nMany claims are filed for that specific car.\n\nThe vehicle does not have advanced safety features.\n\nFactors That Lower Insurance\n\nThe vehicle has a high safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nAdvanced safety features are equipped on the vehicle.\n\nThe make and model is equipped with anti-theft features.\n\nFor example, the MSRP for the Toyota Camry Hybrid LE is higher than the LE. But the Hybrid LE owner pays less for car insurance because the Hybrid LE has more safety features.\n\nHere's how annual insurance rates for a 2019 Toyota Camry stack up:\n\nModel/Trim LevelMSRPAnnual Insurance RateCamry L$24,095$1,944Camry LE$24,600$2,405Camry Hybrid LE$28,400$2,355Camry SE$25,800$2,395Camry Hybrid SE$30,100$2,365Camry XLE$29,175$2,403Camry Hybrid XLE$32,975$2,380Camry XLE V6$34,300$2,403Camry XSE$29,725$2,405Camry XSE V6$34,850$2,406\n\nIf you can't decide between two types of cars, get auto insurance quotes for their make and model. The cost difference just might be the deciding car buying factor.\n\nHow to Buy Insurance for Your Make and Model\n\nTo buy insurance, start by getting a quote for your make and model. You can do this online, through an agent, or by calling an insurance company directly.\n\nFind out below what it takes to get insured from start to finish.\n\nAvoid This Car Insurance Red Flag\n\nIf you get a loyalty discount with your insurance company, you're probably overpaying. Insurance companies raise their prices every year. The only way to get cheap insurance is to compare quotes from different companies.\n\nCompare Quotes\n\nRequesting an Auto Insurance Quote\n\nWhen applying for an auto insurance quote, you'll need to provide the following information:\n\nMake, model, and year of your car, including trim level and body style\n\nVIN\n\nYour age and gender\n\nDriver's license number of anyone who will be on the policy\n\nVehicle registration\n\nDriving history\n\nCredit history\n\nAn auto insurance policy only covers personal driving. It does not cover the use of your car for commercial purposes, like delivery driving or ride-sharing. Some auto insurance companies offer extended coverage for these purposes.\n\nCustomizing Your Quote with Coverages\n\nMost U.S. states require certain coverage minimums. But you can purchase higher amounts. Your insurance amount should be enough to cover the cost of a serious accident.\n\nRead on to learn the coverages you should consider for your auto insurance policy.\n\nMandatory Coverage (in most states)\n\nBodily injury liability pays for the costs of injuries and death caused by you or someone driving your car.\n\nProperty damage liability pays for damages you cause to someone else's car or property, like a utility pole, fence, or building.\n\nMedical payments and personal injury protection (PIP) pays your and your passengers' medical expenses in a car accident. The coverage also reimburses for lost wages and other expenses.\n\nUninsured/underinsured motorist covers you if you are in an accident caused by an uninsured or underinsured motorist. It also applies to hit-and-run situations.\n\nOptional Coverage\n\nCollision insurance covers damage to your car from a collision you caused. It applies whether you collide with another car or an object like a guard rail.\n\nComprehensive covers theft and damage caused by something other than an accident. Some examples are:\n\nTree falling on your car\n\nFlood\n\nFire\n\nFalling rocks\n\nHail\n\nVandalism\n\nIf you lease or finance your car, most lenders require you to purchase comprehensive coverage.\n\nGlass coverage deals with damage to your windshield, side and rear windows, and sunroof.\n\nGap coverage pays off what you owe your lender/leasing company if your car is stolen or totaled. Usually, this coverage is included in the lease amount of a car.\n\nAuto insurance covers you and other household members on your policy. It applies to your car or someone else's car if you have permission to drive it. It can also cover someone not on your policy if they have your consent to drive your car.\n\nApplying for an Auto Insurance Policy\n\nOnce you receive quotes from at least 3 auto insurers, you can compare:\n\nCoverage deductibles, limitations, and exclusions\n\nCoverage amount\n\nDiscounts\n\nFinancial stability rating from Moody's or AM Best\n\nCustomer service and claims ratings from J.D. Power\n\nPrice in relation to above factors\n\nNext, select the best auto insurance company for your needs and complete your application. The auto insurer will review your application and give you the final price for your car insurance policy.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCars are identified by make and model. The make identifies which auto manufacturer built it, while the model identifies the product line.\n\nSome car models have several versions, each with added features or trim levels. A model of the same make might be a coupe vs. a sedan, or a 6-cylinder vs. a 4-cylinder car.\n\nIt's important to know the make and model of your car. It'll come in handy for many purposes throughout your car's life. You'll need the information to register it, insure it, identify it, or sell it."
