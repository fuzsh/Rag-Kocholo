        "text": "All you need to know to make the best choice.\n\nSUVs and hatchbacks are both fantastic options loaded with unique advantages for owners. The question is – which model best suits your situation and requirements?\n\nThat’s where we come in. We want to help you to decide.\n\nFirst of all, then, let’s answer these simple but important questions: what is an SUV? And what is a hatchback?\n\nWhat is an SUV?\n\nAn SUV – the abbreviation for Sports Utility Vehicle – is a big car (sometimes with a four-wheel drive) designed for comfortable driving on most types of terrain. An SUV stands taller than other vehicles, allowing it to pass easily over rough terrain without scraping the underside. It’s spacious, too, and usually seats five to seven passengers comfortably.\n\nBenefits of SUVs include:\n\nBetter view of the road: Because an SUV stands taller than most vehicles, it offers the driver a high level (literally!) of road visibility.\n\nMore space: Again because of its size, an SUV is generally quite roomy in terms of both interior and rear storage. It often seats more passengers than a hatchback; or at the least, it can seat passengers more comfortably.\n\nGround clearance: The height of an SUV allows it to glide over rough and bumpy terrain more easily, which is great if you live in an area that requires off-road driving.\n\nWhat is a hatchback?\n\nA hatchback is a smaller vehicle with a boot located directly behind the rear passenger seats, but still in the main body of the car. It’s distinct from a sedan, which has a boot that projects out of the body in a separate compartment. Hatchbacks are smaller than SUVs, and usually hold four to five passengers.\n\nBenefits of hatchbacks include:\n\nFuel efficiency: A hatchback is smaller and is thus generally more fuel efficient than an SUV.\n\nRunning costs: There are cost factors to consider beyond fuel, too; for example, a hatchback will have smaller tyres than an SUV, which means they will cost less to replace.\n\nPricing: Hatchbacks are usually cheaper than SUVs when buying new, and in some cases they may even depreciate in value more slowly over time."
