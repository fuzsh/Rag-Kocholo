This opens upwards, to make it easier to get mobility equipment in and out.\n\nTwo-to-three door models generally have wide doors with large opening angles, which makes them harder to park in tight spaces.\n\nFive-door models have rear doors, which are useful if you often have more than one passenger.\n\nMany of the small and medium hatchbacks are suitable for drivers under 25 years old. They also tend to have lower Advance Payments, running costs and CO2 emissions."
