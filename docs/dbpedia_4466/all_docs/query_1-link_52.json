The first subcompact car design developed by GM, the rear-wheel drive H platform initially underpinned the Chevrolet Vega and its Pontiac Astre counterpart. For 1975, the H platform was expanded from entry-level vehicles to sport compacts, adding the Chevrolet Monza, Buick Skyhawk, Oldsmobile Starfire, and Pontiac Sunbird.\n\nIn contrast to the globally-developed T platform (later sold alongside it), the H-platform was sold nearly exclusively in North America.\n\nFollowing the downsizing of its larger car lines (the B-body full-size, A-body intermediate, E-body personal luxury), GM moved to redesign the rest of its major model lines. Following the 1980 shift of the X-body compacts to front-wheel drive, the H platform ended production for the 1980 model year. For 1982, the H-body vehicles were replaced by the front-wheel drive J-body; while again shrinking in length, the interiors of the J-body vehicles grew in size, becoming compact-segment vehicles.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1999, the H platform designation was revived for front-wheel drive full-size sedans of the Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac divisions.\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile primarily intended for the Chevrolet Vega, the H platform was not developed by the Chevrolet Division itself, but became the first vehicle architecture developed by a centralized GM design and engineering team.[1][2][3] Replacing two subcompact cars separately in development by Chevrolet and Pontiac, development of the H-body began in 1968. In slightly over two years, GM sought to develop its first subcompact with a sub-2000 pound curb weight, an all-aluminum engine, and priced at or less than the Volkswagen Beetle; assembly of the vehicle was to be primarily automated.[2]\n\nDesign overview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe unibody H-platform is rear-wheel drive, using a 97-inch wheelbase.[3] Scaling down the design of larger GM platforms, the H platform uses unequal-length A-arm front suspension; the rear suspension is a coil-spring solid rear axle.[3]\n\nThe fourth character in the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for an H-body car is \"H\".[4]\n\nBody design\n\n[edit]\n\nFor 1971, the Chevrolet Vega was introduced in four body styles, including a two-door sedan, a three-door hatchback and a three-door station wagon and panel delivery. For 1973, the front bumper was relocated forward; for 1974, both front bumpers were redesigned.\n\nThe Pontiac Astre was introduced for 1973, styled with a different front grille from the Vega. Initially exclusive to Canada, Pontiac released the Astre in the United States for 1975.\n\nFor 1975, the Chevrolet Monza was introduced as a three-door hatchback, alongside the Buick Skyhawk, and Oldsmobile Starfire; a two-door notchback coupe was introduced during the model year. For 1976, the Pontiac Sunbird was introduced, sharing the body of the Monza notchback coupe; a Sunbird hatchback was introduced during 1976 (the Skyhawk and Starfire were only offered as hatchbacks).\n\nFor 1978, the Vega and Astre were discontinued, with the station wagon body style rebadged as a Monza and Sunbird wagon; the station wagon was dropped for 1980.\n\nPowertrain details\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Chevrolet Vega was introduced with a Chevrolet-designed 140 cubic-inch inline-4 engine; while using an aluminum engine block, the cylinder head was of cast-iron construction. The later Chevrolet Cosworth Vega was fitted with a 122 cubic-inch all-aluminum inline-4. An advanced design for the time, the Cosworth Vega engine used dual overhead camshafts, 4 valves per cylinder, and electronic fuel injection; in total, 5000 engines were assembled for 1975.[5]\n\nFor 1975, the introduction of the Chevrolet Monza saw the introduction of V8 engines to H platform (not offered in the Vega and Astre). In 1975, the H-platform also adopted a Buick-designed 231 cubic-inch V6. For 1978, the 140 cubic-inch inline-4 was replaced by a Pontiac-designed 151 cubic-inch inline-4 (later known as the \"Iron Duke\" engine).[6]\n\nIn addition to the Cosworth Vega engine, the H platform served in the development of several advanced GM engine designs. In 1972, a prototype Vega powered by a 302 cubic-inch aluminum-block V8 (derived from CERV I) was tested, but did not progress to production.[7] While the Vega served in its development, the GM-rotary Wankel engine (GMRCA) was intended to be a key feature of the Chevrolet Monza hatchback and its counterparts; following its 1974 cancellation, the GMRCA was replaced by 262 and 305 cubic-inch Chevrolet V8s.\n\nModels\n\n[edit]\n\nYears Model Wheelbase Previous platform Next platform 1971–1977 Chevrolet Vega 97.0 in (2464 mm) 1973–1977 Pontiac Astre 1975–1980 Chevrolet Monza 1976–1980 Pontiac Sunbird GM J platform 1975–1980 Buick Skyhawk GM J platform 1975–1980 Oldsmobile Starfire\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nChevrolet Vega\n\nChevrolet Cosworth Vega\n\nPontiac Astre\n\nChevrolet Monza\n\nPontiac Sunbird\n\nBuick Skyhawk\n\nOldsmobile Starfire\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
