        "text": "Most people compare based on price or fuel economy, but one of the most important features is the body type. There are two basic body styles for cars:two-door and four-door. There is a third choice, the hatchback, that is somewhere in between. The sedan and hatchback have their own merits and drawbacks, so you'll have to choose what best fits your needs.\n\nCan body type affect car life expectancy? Which is better? And it is impossible to give a definite answer to it. Since the final decision depends on the operating conditions, travel routes, luggage compartment load, and personal preferences.\n\nPerhaps you are trying to decide which body type is better, or maybe you've already made your choice but are curious about the other one. Either way, there are several considerations that can help you to make an informed decision:\n\nWhat is a Sedan?\n\nA sedan is a closed type of car body in which the luggage compartment and engine compartment are structurally separated from the passenger compartment. Therefore, the sedan is also considered one of the few three-volume body types. Initially, sedans had two or four doors, but later a three-volume body with two doors was isolated into a separate body type - a coupe.\n\nRELATED: The 5 Best Midsize Sedans for 2022\n\nWhat is a Hatchback?\n\nA hatchback is a type of two-volume passenger car body with a shortened rear overhang and a door at the rear of the car. In such a car, only the engine compartment is structurally separated, and the passenger compartment and luggage compartment are combined into a total volume.\n\nThe hatchback cabin can have one or two rows of seats, and the number of doors can vary from three to five, including the tailgate. In addition, among the varieties of the hatchback body, there are also liftback, fastback, and notchback.\n\nRELATED: The 5 Best Used Hatchback Cars for 2022\n\nRELATED: The 10 Greatest Hot Hatchbacks of All Time\n\nSedan vs. Hatchback: Which is Better?\n\nThe sedan, as a body type, provides more comfort to passengers, but, alas, is not as practical. The hatchback, on the other hand, does not provide the same level of comfort as the sedan, despite its high practicality and ease of use. So, if comfort is more important for you when operating a car, then it is better to pay attention to sedans, and if practicality, then hatchbacks.\n\nIn the production of high-end cars, companies tend to use better parts and innovative solutions. This allows automakers to extend the life of vehicles. For this reason, many prefer SUVs, crossovers, and trucks.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf one were to ask which car is better, a sedan or hatchback, the answer depends on what you're looking for. Sedans look great, but with their four doors they cost more than a hatchback. Similarly, hatches are cheaper, but they aren't as comfortable as sedans because of their smaller size and seating. Of course, there is another way to view this issue: do you prefer door handles or not?\n\nWhen you have to choose a car, carefully study all the advantages and disadvantages of the models, evaluate the external data of the bodies, and be sure to try a test drive. Thanks to this, you will take into account not only the external features of the car but also be able to evaluate how the car will behave in different operating situations.
