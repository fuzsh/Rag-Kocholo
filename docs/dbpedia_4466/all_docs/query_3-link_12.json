        "text": "When it comes to cars, there are a few basic body styles. A coupe is a two-door model, usually with a traditional trunk, while a sedan is a four-door option. A hatchback is a model that, instead of a trunk, comes with a high back end and an extra rear door that opens into a large cargo area. In this blog post we are going to answer the question “Should you get a sedan or a hatchback?” and explore some pros and cons of both of these body styles.\n\nRead More: What’s the difference between a crossover and an SUV?\n\nShould you get a sedan or a hatchback?\n\nWhether you get a hatchback or a sedan will ultimately come down to personal preference and availability, but there are a few things to think about when comparing these two vehicles. Both options have both pros and cons.\n\nWindow Visibility\n\nHatchbacks have better visibility for the driver because of the large rear windows, but most hatchbacks will require a wiper for the rear window. This means another moving part that may break, and windshield wiper fluid that needs to be refilled periodically.[/wrc_column]"
