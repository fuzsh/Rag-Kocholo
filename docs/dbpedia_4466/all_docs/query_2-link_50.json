        "text": "More people buy small hatchbacks than any other type of car. However, there are an awful lot to choose from, so here we count down the top 10 – and reveal the model to avoid...\n\nThe small car market is one of the most fiercely contested, which is great news if you're after this sort of vehicle, because it means there are stacks of models to choose from.\n\nTo have a chance of topping the class, a small car – also known as a supermini – must be as comfortable at speed on the motorway as it is in the city, as well as being easy to weave around tight urban roads. It must have enough boot space for weekly shopping trips, and an interior that's practical enough to cope with the demands of families. And it must, of course, be competitively priced and cheap to run.\n\nOur road testers have spent countless hours evaluating every small car on the market. That means we're able to give you the definitive, trusted and authoritative list of the best small cars on sale today. After all that testing, we have concluded that the Renault Clio is the best small car you can buy. To find out why, and which version we recommend, read on.\n\nWe've also named nine other small cars which are well worth looking at, as well as the small car you should avoid. If anything takes your fancy, just click on the relevant links to read more about it or see the latest and best small car deals.\n\nThe 2024 What Car? Reliability Survey is live, tell us about your car now\n\n1\n\nRenault Clio\n\nOur pick: 1.0 TCe 90 Techno 5dr\n\n0-62mph: 12.2 sec\n\nMPG/range: 54.3mpg\n\nCO2 emissions: 119g/km\n\nSeats: 5\n\nBoot: 284 litres\n\nInsurance group: 11E\n\nReliability\n\nSafety\n\nCosts\n\nQuality\n\nPerformance\n\nStrengths\n\nSmart interior is packed with equipment\n\nGood ride and handling balance\n\nPractical boot\n\nWeaknesses\n\nTight for taller adults in the rear seats\n\nSlightly firm low-speed ride\n\nHigh boot loading lip\n\nThe latest Renault Clio is a fantastic all-rounder, offering the kind of space, comfort and convenience which you’d normally expect to pay top dollar for. Yet the Clio actually undercuts most of its rivals on price – including our former favourite in this class, the Honda Jazz.\n\nYou can fit more into the Clio’s boot than you can into that of the rival Skoda Fabia. And while the Fabia is slightly quicker, the Clio’s more responsive steering and tighter body control makes it the more enjoyable car to drive.\n\nDespite this, ride comfort is good. Plus, the interior is smartly finished, with a portrait-oriented infotainment screen that looks great and is quick to respond to inputs.\n\nFor those reasons, the Renault Clio is our reigning Small Car of the Year.\n\n“I found the physical switches below the touchscreen and to the right of the steering column (for functions such as deactivating the lane-keeping assistance) much easier to operate than touch-sensitive equivalents.” – Will Nightingale, Reviews Editor\n\nRead our in-depth Renault Clio review\n\n2\n\nHonda Jazz\n\nReliability\n\nSafety\n\nCosts\n\nQuality\n\nPerformance\n\nStrengths\n\nSpacious interior with flexible rear seats\n\nLots of standard equipment\n\nSlow depreciation\n\nWeaknesses\n\nVery pricey by small car standards\n\nNot the quietest cruiser\n\nSome rivals are more fun\n\nThe Jazz's space and seating flexibility – including rear seat bases that flip up like those in a cinema – puts other small cars to shame. But crucially it's not just a box on wheels; it’s brilliant even if you take practicality out of the equation.\n\nIts hybrid engine, for example, delivers strong performance and excellent real-world fuel economy. Meanwhile, a soothing ride and generous luxury and safety equipment add further to its appeal.\n\nOnly a steep purchase price stops it topping this list, although slow depreciation partially makes up for this and also ensures PCP finance rates are competitive.\n\n“The Jazz’s three-knob air-con set-up is easy to adjust on the move and large cut-outs in its windscreen pillars mean you have a great view out when tackling roundabouts and junctions. I found the Jazz exceptionally easy to live with.” – Lawrence Cheung, New Cars Editor\n\nRead our in-depth Honda Jazz review\n\n3\n\nSkoda Fabia\n\nOur pick: 1.0 TSI SE Comfort 5dr\n\n0-62mph: 10.7 sec\n\nMPG/range: 55.8mpg\n\nCO2 emissions: 115g/km\n\nSeats: 5\n\nBoot: 380 litres\n\nInsurance group: 11E\n\nReliability\n\nSafety\n\nCosts\n\nQuality\n\nPerformance\n\nStrengths\n\nHuge boot\n\nRoomy interior with clever features\n\nFairly supple ride\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRenault Clio has a smarter interior\n\nNot as practical as the Honda Jazz\n\nEntry-level engine only suited to town driving\n\nWhile it's not the cheapest new car you can buy, the latest Skoda Fabia is still very well priced, undercutting most rivals – including the closely related Volkswagen Polo.\n\nTrue, the interior of the Fabia is a bit drab, but there's excellent space for both passengers and luggage; only the Honda Jazz is significantly more practical.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Fabia is more comfortable and a lot safer than the Dacia Sandero; the independent experts at Euro NCAP awarded it five stars out of five, whereas the Sandero managed just two stars.\n\n“Boot space is impressive, although I think it’s a bit of a shame the Fabia misses out on the Clio’s height-adjustable floor.” – Neil Winn, Deputy Reviews Editor\n\nRead our in-depth Skoda Fabia review\n\n4\n\nSuzuki Swift\n\nDriving\n\nInterior\n\nPracticality\n\nBuying & Owning\n\nStrengths\n\nExcellent fuel economy\n\nTidy handling\n\nLots of standard kit\n\nWeaknesses\n\nFirm ride\n\nRoad noise\n\nRivals offer better practicality\n\nIt might be based on the same underpinnings as its predecessor, but the latest Suzuki Swift does get a new 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine. It's not turbocharged like the engines you'll find in most rivals, but it makes the most of its 81bhp and feels perfectly peppy for most situations.\n\nUnlike most rivals, you can have the Swift with four-wheel drive – and those models carry the Allgrip badge. Those cars also get a jacked-up ride height, so look like a cross between a small car and a small SUV. No matter which version of the Swift you go for, you get mild hybrid technology to help lower your fuel bills.\n\nThe Swift has a footprint that's smaller than most rivals, but despite that, it's not as cramped inside as you might fear. Indeed, a couple of six-footers will be perfectly fine on the rear bench, with more head and leg room than they'd find in the rival Dacia Sandero.\n\n“Its interior might be mostly made of plastics, but a broad range of colours and textures mean that it does at least look and feel interesting – plus it all feels built to last” – Doug Revolta, Head of Video\n\nRead our in-depth Suzuki Swift review\n\nOur pick: 1.0 VVT-i Edge 5dr\n\n0-62mph: 14.9 sec\n\nMPG/range: 58.9mpg\n\nCO2 emissions: 110g/km\n\nSeats: 4\n\nBoot: 226 litres\n\nInsurance group: 6A\n\nDriving\n\nInterior\n\nPracticality\n\nBuying & Owning\n\nStrengths\n\nCheap to run\n\nGood level of safety kit\n\nWarranty of up to 10 years\n\nWeaknesses\n\nCramped in the back\n\nSmaller boot than rivals\n\nLacklustre performance\n\nLike the Suzuki Ignis, the Toyota Aygo X combines rugged SUV looks with city-friendly dimensions, but it's a far more rounded car.\n\nA tight turning circle makes low-speed manoeuvres easy, plus the Aygo X handles neatly on faster roads, thanks to taut body control and well weighted steering.\n\nThrow in low running costs and a long list of standard safety kit, and there's a lot to like. Just bear in mind that it's cramped in the back seats and the boot is small.\n\n“The driver's seat in the Aygo X is supportive, but I found I had to stretch slightly to reach the steering wheel due to the lack of reach adjustment.” – Steve Huntingford, Editor\n\nRead our in-depth Toyota Aygo X review\n\n6\n\nDacia Sandero\n\nOur pick: 1.0 Tce Bi-Fuel Expression 5dr\n\n0-62mph: 11.6 sec\n\nMPG/range: 52.3mpg\n\nCO2 emissions: 109g/km\n\nSeats: 5\n\nBoot: 328 litres\n\nInsurance group: 14E\n\nReliability\n\nSafety\n\nCosts\n\nQuality\n\nPerformance\n\nStrengths\n\nAmazingly good value\n\nLots of space for passengers and luggage\n\nComfortable ride\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPoor safety rating compared with rivals\n\nThere are more entertaining small cars to drive\n\nSome other small cars are quieter\n\nThe Dacia Sandero offers a supple ride, comes generously equipped (at least in our recommended Comfort trim) and is very spacious.\n\nAdd in the fact that the TCe 90 and TCe 100 Bi-Fuel engines are both great, and the Sandero would be well worth considering even if it cost the same as its rivals. Except it doesn’t; the Sandero is one of the UK's cheapest new cars.\n\nJust bear in mind that there are quieter and safer small hatchbacks if you're prepared to spend more, including the Skoda Fabia which appears above the Sandero in this list, as well as the more frugal Toyota Yaris.\n\n“If you plan to carry adults or tall children in the rear seats, they’ll be happy in the Sandero. I managed to load six carry-on suitcases in the boot, too, which is a square shape and easy to pack.” – Stuart Milne, Digital Editor\n\nRead our in-depth Dacia Sandero review\n\n7\n\nVolkswagen Polo\n\nOur pick: 1.0 TSI Life 5dr\n\n0-62mph: 10.8 sec\n\nMPG/range: 54.3mpg\n\nCO2 emissions: 118g/km\n\nSeats: 5\n\nBoot: 351 litres\n\nInsurance group: 9E\n\nReliability\n\nSafety\n\nCosts\n\nQuality\n\nPerformance\n\nStrengths\n\nGood to drive\n\nGenerous interior space\n\nAttractive PCP finance deals\n\nWeaknesses\n\nFiddly touch-sensitive controls\n\nGutless entry-level petrol\n\nReliability could be better\n\nVolkswagen's latest Polo is available with a broad range of engines and trim levels, ensuring that there's something for almost everyone in the line-up.\n\nIt also has a classy interior that's well equipped even in entry-level Life trim. And few small cars are as good at soaking up bumps in the road or do a better job of suppressing wind and road noise on the motorway.\n\nPreviously, the Polo has lost out to the rival Seat Ibiza because it couldn’t justify its additional expense, but the impressive deals and monthly finance rates that are often available mean that's no longer an issue. Then again, the Ibiza is still more fun to drive.\n\n\"I found rear leg room almost as plentiful as in the Honda Jazz, although there’s less head room and a big hump in the floor for the middle passenger to straddle. The front seat slides back a long way to accommodate long-legged drivers.” – Darren Moss, Deputy Digital Editor\n\nRead our in-depth Volkswagen Polo review\n\n8\n\nSeat Ibiza\n\nOur pick: 1.0 TSI 95 FR 5dr\n\n0-62mph: 11 sec\n\nMPG/range: 52.3mpg\n\nCO2 emissions: 123g/km\n\nSeats: 5\n\nBoot: 355 litres\n\nInsurance group: 12E\n\nReliability\n\nSafety\n\nCosts\n\nQuality\n\nPerformance\n\nStrengths\n\nGreat to drive\n\nRoomy by class standards\n\nStrong TSI petrol engines\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLots of road noise\n\nResale values could be better\n\nFirm ride in FR versions\n\nWith the Ford Fiesta now off sale, the Seat Ibiza takes up the mantle as the most engaging small car to drive. Key to that is its steering; it starts off light to suit town driving, before progressively weighting up and providing impressive feedback as your speed builds.\n\nAt the same time, the Ibiza is more spacious than many rivals – particularly in the rear seats – and it holds its value better, meaning it will cost you less in the long run.\n\nYou do have to put up with quite a lot of road noise, though, and FR versions have a firm ride.\n\n“I was able to stretch out in the Ibiza, because it has more leg room than the Fabia and Polo. All three have similarly shaped boots, but the Ibiza is the only one not available with a height-adjustable boot floor.” – Dan Jones, Reviewer\n\nRead our in-depth Seat Ibiza review\n\n9\n\nAudi A1\n\nOur pick: 30 TFSI Sport 5dr\n\n0-62mph: 9.7 sec\n\nMPG/range: 51.4mpg\n\nCO2 emissions: 124g/km\n\nSeats: 5\n\nBoot: 335 litres\n\nInsurance group: 20E\n\nReliability\n\nSafety\n\nCosts\n\nQuality\n\nPerformance\n\nStrengths\n\nSmooth ride and tidy handling\n\nRelatively quiet at higher speeds\n\nVery slow depreciation\n\nWeaknesses\n\nCheaper trims not well equipped\n\nMini feels much plusher inside\n\nPeugeot 208 offers more for less money\n\nNow in its second generation, Audi's smallest car combines a smooth and well controlled ride with reassuring handling. Plus, it does a fine job of delivering peace and quiet, even at motorway speeds.\n\nIt’s also roomy enough for two adults to sit comfortably in the back. And there’s even a spacious boot, remedying one of the criticisms of the first-generation Audi A1.\n\nHowever, while there are some nice touches, the interior doesn’t feel significantly classier than the cheaper and closely related Volkswagen Polo's, which is why the A1 goes no higher on this list.\n\n“I found the A1’s 8.8in touchscreen more distracting to use than the rotary controller fitted to older models. Smartphone mirroring is standard, but for built-in sat-nav you need the optional Technology Pack, which includes a bigger 10.1in display.” – George Hill, Staff Writer\n\nRead our in-depth Audi A1 review\n\n10\n\nMG3 Hybrid+\n\nOur pick: 1.5 Hybrid SE 5dr Auto\n\n0-62mph: 8 sec\n\nMPG/range: 64.2mpg\n\nCO2 emissions: 100g/km\n\nSeats: 5\n\nBoot: 241 litres\n\nInsurance group: 23A\n\nDriving\n\nInterior\n\nPracticality\n\nBuying & Owning\n\nStrengths\n\nAttractively priced\n\nInterior looks fairly smart\n\nWell equipped\n\nWeaknesses\n\nInterior build quality could be better\n\nPoor rear-seat versatility\n\nRenault Clio is more fun to drive\n\nEventually, you'll be able to buy an MG3 both with and without hybrid power, but for now it's only available with – meaning you get a 1.5-litre petrol engine and an electric motor which allows the car to drive for short distances using electric power alone. That's especially helpful in the city, where the flow of urban traffic means it can maximise that electric power – indeed, an official fuel economy figure of 63mpg means the MG3 could be very cheap to run.\n\nIt's a shame that while the MG3's driver's seat is comfortable and easy to adjust, the steering wheel only adjusts up and down, rather than in and out as well – and that means some drivers might struggle to find a position which suits them. At least you get good visibility, and every car comes with rear parking sensors and a reversing camera to help you park.\n\nWe managed to fit three carry-on suitcases into the MG3's boot, and that's likely to be plenty for most drivers. Just be aware that some small car rivals – including hybrid alternatives like the Honda Jazz and Toyota Yaris – can carry more still.\n\n“It might be built to a price, but I found the 10.25in touchscreen in the MG3 clear to see and quick to respond to my inputs – it only lagged slightly when I was using certain features, or switching quickly between screens.” – Claire Evans, Consumer Editor\n\nRead our in-depth MG3 review\n\nFor all the latest reviews, advice and new car deals, sign up to the What Car? newsletter here\n\nAnd the small car to avoid...\n\nCitroën C3\n\nWith its funky looks inside and out, the C3 does a great job of turning heads. Unfortunately, it's poor to drive and not very practical, so any number of rivals are more recommendable on an objective level. Read our review\n\nHow we choose the best family cars\n\nWhen we put a new family car through our comprehensive testing regime, we assess it in dozens of areas, with a particular focus on those which family car buyers consider most important when looking for a new car.\n\nTo find out what these are, we conduct an annual survey of more than 20,000 readers, in which we ask them to list the things they look for in a new model. Here are the top three:\n\nReliability – a key attribute for 71% of family car buyers\n\nIn our annual Reliability Survey, we ask thousands of owners if their cars have let them down, how serious the faults were and how much they cost to put right. We then use this exclusive data to produce an overall reliability score for hundreds of models aged up to five years old.\n\nComfortable driving position – a key attribute for 55% of family car buyers\n\nA wide range of adjustment in the seat and steering wheel is important, because it increases the odds that everyone can get comfy behind the wheel; that consideration becomes all the more important in a family car which often needs to be driven by multiple family members. Plus, a supportive driver’s seat – ideally one with adjustable lumbar support – can make a huge difference on a long family road trip.\n\nStandard equipment – a key attribute for 55% of family car buyers\n\nFrom the basics like electric windows to nice-to-haves such as adaptive cruise control or a panoramic glas roof, our expert road testers pore over manufacturers’ sales brochures to work out which models give you the most kit for your money.\n\nWe don’t stop there, though. Every car undergoes a rigorous programme of testing, and you can read more about that in our how we test cars feature.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhich small car offers the best value for money?\n\nValue means different things to different people, but to us a small car majoring in value must be deceptively spacious, frugal and good to drive – and can't cost a lot to buy. When all those attributes are considered, we think the best value small car is the Renault Clio.\n\nThe latest Clio is more spacious than some small car rivals and, crucially, costs less than most of them to buy too. Indeed, that value is what led the Clio to be crowned as our Small Car of the Year at the most recent What Car? Car of the Year Awards.\n\nWhat is the most reliable small car?\n\nEvery year, our Reliability Survey collects the real-world experiences of car owners to reveal which models are faultless – and which are nothing but trouble. Our most recent data suggests that the most reliable small car is the Suzuki Swift, which recorded a reliability rating of 99.5% – meaning hardly any owners had trouble with their cars over the previous year.\n\nWhat is the best used small car?\n\nWe think the Honda Jazz is the best small car to buy used. Not only will it be cheap to run, thanks to its hybrid setup, but data from our Reliability Survey is encouraging. Even though you could bag a used Ford Fiesta, Seat Ibiza or Toyota Yaris for similar money, the Jazz's is our go-to choice for used buyers and our reigning Used Hatchback of the Year.\n\nWhat is the cheapest small car?\n\nThe Kia Picanto is the UK's cheapest small car – and that's before you factor in our Target Price savings, which can make it even cheaper. Despite its bargain price, there's a lot to like about the Picanto, from its tidy handling to its frugal 1.0-litre petrol engine and excellent infotainment system on our recommended '3' models. However, being engineered to a price that's even less than that of the Dacia Sandero means a couple of compromises – the Picano is pretty cramped inside and its ride is firm.\n\nTop 10s >\n\nBest of\n\nBest used small cars for less than £10,000\n\nSmall doesn’t have to mean stingy, and cheap really can be cheerful, as these fantastic used small cars prove\n\nLong term tests >\n\nFeature\n\nRenault Clio long-term test\n\nIn January, we named the latest Clio our Small Car of the Year.
