        "text": "New Delhi: As Akshay Kumar delivers Singh Is Bliing, his fourth release this year after Baby, Gabbar Is Back and Brothers, many are cynical about his constant film-churning abilities in an era where most actors prefer to take their time and work on one film in one, and sometimes, two years. But that wasn’t always the case and Kumar has certainly not been the busiest actor. Here’s a look at 10 actors who’ve belted out more movies in a year than one can keep count of.\n\nRajesh Khanna: At the peak of his career in 1972, Khanna had 11 film releases, including a Telugu movie called Bangaru Babu directed by V.B. Rajendra Prasad. Some of his Hindi films that year included superhits like Amar Prem, Apna Desh and Mere Jeevan Saathi, which together earned more than ₹ 5 crore.\n\nShatrughan Sinha: Right at the beginning of his career in 1971, the actor had 13 releases. These included several guest appearances but Gulzar’s highly acclaimed Mere Apne saved the day for him.\n\nJeetendra: In 1972, Jeetendra appeared in 10 films. While these included two special appearances in Chori Chori and Garam Masala, his most memorable turn was as the kind teacher in Parichay, director Gulzar’s adaptation of The Sound of Music.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan: Before he hit super-stardom and was trying to find his feet in the industry, Bachchan was credited with nine releases in 1972. While these include special appearances and voice-overs as well, none of them, except S.Ramanathan’s romantic-thriller Bombay To Goa that crossed the ₹ 1 crore mark, are particularly memorable.\n\nDharmendra: In 1977, Dharmendra was seen in 12 movies, including some big hits. Dream Girl, Dharam Veer and Chacha Bhatija together crossed nearly ₹ 12 crore. His special appearance in Gulzar’s critically-acclaimed Kinara is memorable.\n\nMithun Chakraborty: For the year 1986, Chakraborty has a record-breaking 15 movie releases to his credit. While few would remember titles like Karamdaata and Avinash, there’s no taking away from the feat itself.\n\nGovinda: Three years after he debuted, Govinda appeared in 15 films in 1989. These included hits like Do Qaidi and Taaqatwar which together crossed ₹ 3 crore at the box office. The latter was also his first film with director David Dhawan, with whom he delivered several hits later.\n\nJackie Shroff: At the peak of his career in 1989, Shroff had nine film releases. Interestingly, they were all lead roles. While he received critical acclaim for Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s trendsetting gangster flick Parinda, Subhash Ghai’s Ram Lakhan crossed nearly ₹ 10 crore at the box office.\n\nAmrish Puri: The popular character actor starred in 18 films in 1989. While some like Daata and Nafrat Ki Aandhi left no mark, Tridev and Ram Lakhan together crossed nearly ₹ 20 crore at the box office.\n\nAjay Devgn: Fairly established as he was, Devgn appeared in seven movies in 1999. While his own home production Dil Kya Kare sank with earnings of ₹ 9 crore, hits like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Kacche Dhaage and Hogi Pyaar Ki Jeet brought in collections of nearly ₹ 40 crore in total."
