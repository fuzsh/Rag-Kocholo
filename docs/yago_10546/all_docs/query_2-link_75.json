        "text": "For David Dhawan and Govinda, it is time to set records. Between 1989 and 2009, the duo worked in an astonishing 15 films together. These were Taaqatwar, Swarg, Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Coolie No. 1, Saajan Chale Sasural, Hero No. 1, Deewana Mastana, Banarsi Babu, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, Haseena Maan Jayegi, Kunwara, Jodi No. 1 and Kyonkii Main Jhuth Nahi Bolta.\n\nWith an exception of 'Banarsi Babu', box office outcome of each of the remaining 14 films ranged from coverage to blockbuster status.\n\nIn 2003, they reunited with 'Ek Aur Ek Gyaarah' but the film wasn't any great shakes. They made history though with 'Partner' (2007) which turned out to be their biggest money spinner together. Now they are back in their 18th film - 'Do Knot Disturb' (2009).\n\nSays David Dhawan, \"Govinda and I have been a team for years now and our motive has always been to entertain people. And what better way to do that than to make them laugh. Our track record over the years pretty much demonstrates that.\"\n\nIn fact this is one reunion that was pretty much being talked about once the first look of 'Do Knot Disturb' was unveiled at the recently concluded International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Awards 2009. Industry insiders who had a dekko at the film's promos can't stop raving about it.\n\n\"Believe me, the film is going to be a 'baap of all comedies' once it releases\", comments a trade expert, \"David Dhawan and Govinda combo is at work again. They know what is required to attract the masses and with Riteish Deshmukh joining the fun, the fun element has only gone up exponentially.\"\n\nAdds David Dhawan, \"'Do Knot Disturb' follows the same objective i. e. make people laugh and let them forget their worries. With actors like Govinda, Riteish Deshmukh, Lara Dutta, Sushmita Sen, Sohail Khan, Ranvir Sheorey and Rajpal Yadav - all of whom have a natural flair for comedy - I am sure audiences worldwide would be seen smiling once 'Do Knot Disturb' arrives on screen.\"\n\nIncidentally this is the first time that Riteish is working with either David or Govinda though with Vashu, the young actor has worked earlier in 'Out Of Control' and most recently 'Kal Kissne Dekha'.\n\nWith music by Nadeem-Shravan, the film would be released later this year. -Sampurn Media"
