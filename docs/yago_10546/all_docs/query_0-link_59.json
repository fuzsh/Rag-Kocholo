        "text": "“I don’t know [if I want to direct]; not right now, for sure. At least, I am not thinking about this (direction) for the next decade. I don’t think I have it in me now, but maybe, I might [direct] one day in life. I think most actors want to direct one day. Har actor ko ek film ka keeda hota hai (smiles),” says Varun.\n\nBut even if he decides to direct films it won’t come as a surprise. “Yes, I am aware but there is still time to think about it. I don’t think my father wants me to direct a film and even I don’t want to. I’m happy being his kid and I am also working with some wonderful people and learning a lot,” he says with a smile.\n\nAt the same time, Varun credits his “knowledge of cinema” to his father. “I can’t take that away from him. In fact, I give him a lot of credit, and especially now, with Rohit being a director as well. Eventually, a director makes the film and whenever I get the chance, one thing that I really love is to hang out with a senior,” says the actor, adding that he loves to “hear about what their experiences have been” and “how they made their films”.\n\nIn the same vein, the Badrinath Ki Dulhania actor recounts his meeting with Neerja (2016) director Ram Madhvani. “I watched Neerja in Abu Dhabi (UAE) and loved the way Ram made it. It shook me, so when I came back, I called up Ram,” says Varun, who met the director and “spent some time with him”.\n\n“I asked him how you did what you did [in the film] and I was really fascinated to learn the process of making Neerja. It was a very enriching experience. I learnt a lot during the 50 to 55 minutes that I spent with him. Spending time with film-makers is one of the best and inspiring things,” says the actor."
