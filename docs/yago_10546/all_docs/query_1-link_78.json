        "text": "David Dhawan, who has been associated with comedy for close to three decades now, is gearing up for his 43rd feature comedy. The filmmaker doesn’t intend to go slow any time soon. He says, “I can’t believe how fast time has flown. I started my career as a director with my first film Taaqatwar in 1989. Prior to that, I was a film editor. It was here that I learnt to not waste footage on plot development. I’ve always considered audiences to be intelligent.”\n\nAs David looks back, he can’t believe how far he has come. “In 1997, I was directing Salman Khan in Judwaa. In 2017, I am directing my son Varun in Judwaa 2. God has been kind. Luckily, I’ve been able to change my style of filmmaking with time. The style in which Judwaa was made is very different from Judwaa 2.”\n\nDavid says he leans unabashedly on his two sons, filmmaker Rohit and actor Varun, to get a feel of what the young viewers like. “When I feel I am getting repetitive and stale, I consult my sons. It happened to me when I made Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya. I asked my son Rohit to help me use a younger visual and spoken language,” says David appreciatively.\n\nDavid is also filled with parental pride at Varun’ stardom. “My sons have luckily turned out into the kind of children every parent wants. I am aware of how popular Varun is. More than his popularity, it is his good conduct and decent attitude that I am proud about. The entire credit for this must go to my wife. I was busy working around the clock while my wife looked after my children. I am still working. But my children are now part of our journey of filmmaking.”"
