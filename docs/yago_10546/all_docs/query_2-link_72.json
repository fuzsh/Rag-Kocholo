        "text": "Mumbai, Oct 6 (IANS) Director David Dhawan, who has worked with Sanjay Dutt in eight films -- the latest being \"Rascals\" -- says the actor hasn't changed a bit over the past 20 years.\n\n\"He (Sanjay) is like an open book. He doesn't hide anything. I think he is basically the most simple guy I have ever seen. I started my career with him 20 years back as a director, and he is still the same. There is no change in him,\" Dhawan, who first worked with Sanjay in 1989 film \"Taaqatwar\", told reporters here.\n\nComedy film \"Rascals\", which released Thursday, also stars Ajay Devgn.\n\nSanjay, who considers Ajay as his younger brother, says even after delivering many hits, the latter is very down to earth.\n\n\"Ajay comes across as a very serious person which actually he is not. He is a very easy person. He has got a fantastic sense of humour. He is so grounded. He has given hits like 'Golmaal', 'Singham' and I pray that 'Rascals' is also a big hit...but all this doesn't affect him,\" said Sanjay.\n\nSanjay will next be seen as a villain in Karan Johar's \"Agneepath\" remake while Ajay is busy shooting Rohit Shetty's \"Bol Bachchan\".\n\nClick the Movie button below for more info:\n\nRascals\n\nDavid Dawan Pictures"
