I create sound texture by working on the tonal quality of the actor’s voice his or her footsteps and other Foley sounds. Other than that, what will be the sounds the audience will be hearing in the acoustical space of the story? That’s, what I create, what we term as the ‘soundscape’. ‘What the audience hears’, meaning, if it’s an outdoor night scene, will the audience hear the night crickets or an owl, which sound from the hundreds of options will help the narrative best, is what I attempt to create as the film’s sound designer. For me, this acoustical space is something very close to the story, because it subconsciously affects the perception of the audience and draws their attention to what the character is experiencing, feeling, hearing and reacting. - Rakesh Ranjan.\n\nRakeshji Rakesh Ranjan​ amongst the finest Audiographer and Sound Designers.
