        "text": "Govinda and David Dhawan spelled magic at the box office during the ‘90s with over 15 consecutive hits. The actor-director duo had managed to pull off one mad comedy caper after another and their No1 series films are still popular among the audience. However, the actor says that he “doubtful” that he will ever work with the director again. Dhawan had, in fact, made his directorial debut in 1989 with Taaqatwar that starred Govinda in the lead.\n\nApparently, now there is no love lost between the actor and the director. Govinda said during a media interaction that he had approached Dhawan for a project but was “hurt” by his negative response. In a recent interview, Govinda said, “I am doubtful about reuniting with David Dhawan. The reason is that he made a film Chashme Badoor. I had narrated the subject to him. (But) he started making the film with someone else. I was surprised when I came to know about it. I called him and said, 'David, I really wanted to do our 18th or 19th film together'. He never called me back.”\n\nRECOMMENDED READ: Ganesh Chaturthi: Govinda, Rishi Kapoor, Nana Patekar and Sonu Sood welcome Bappa home\n\nHe further added, “Then my secretary offered him a film to which he gave a rude reply saying, 'Tell Govinda, he has started asking too many questions. Whatever part he is getting in the film, he should just do that'. It hurt me a lot. I am sure his sons must be asking him questions. He probably never expected that I will one day reach this level or I will grow up or I will come back to movies after becoming a Member of Parliament.”\n\nGovinda said that he had called Dhawan to let him know that he will not work with him if they do not collaborate by 2010. He said, “He took me casually. In late 2009, my wife and I were at some party and she told me, he was calling me. But I said, 'I will not go to him right now'. I have seen so much success with him and I believe come what may one should always be thankful to God for those experiences.\"\n\nGovinda believes that he and Dhawan both contributed a lot to each other’s career and also denied the claims that he took the credit for the director’s success. He said, “It is not about credit or discredits. There is a fundamental system and one should not disrespect that. I brought 23 new directors in the industry and he is one of them. It's not a pride issue, but I feel it is time which allows you to be successful. And I respect that factor the most.\"\n\nHowever, the actor said that he would work with Dhawan if only the director offers him a film. He maintained that everyone, including his family wants him to reunite with the director with whom he had such a winning stride. He said, “Everyone is in love with the kind of films we did together. My family tells me why are you hiding from yourself by not working with him. But I believe there is a right time to move ahead.”\n\nGovinda and Dhawan worked in such blockbusters like Aankhen, Shola Aur Shabnam, Saajan Chale Sasural, Hero No 1, Coolie No 1, Dulhe Raja and Bade Miyan Chote Miyan. Partner, which released in 2007, was their last film together; it also starred Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif and Lara Dutta.\n\nMeanwhile, on the work front, Govinda will be next seen in Fryday that releases on October 3. Dhawan, on the other hand, is planning to take the No 1 series forward with son and actor Varun Dhawan."
