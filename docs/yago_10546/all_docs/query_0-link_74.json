        "text": "David Dhawan has floored us with his cinema over and over again. But which one worked BEST for you?\n\nUnpretentious and unabashed, that's David Dhawan's brand of crowd-.\n\nPartner demonstrates the power of solid chemistry.\n\nDhawan ropes in his favourite boys -- Govinda and Salman Khan -- and plays them against each other by casting them as chalk and cheese in this Hitch rip-off and allows their spontaneous camaraderie to take care of the rest.\n\nRead the review here\n\nSanjay Dutt and Govinda essay Kader Khan’s spoilt, mischievous sons idling away their time in childish pranks till they fall for a pair of sisters.\n\nTrust Dhawan to blend a mix of catchy tunes, buffoonery and star power to turn Haseena Maan Jayegi into box office jackpot and Sanju-Chi Chi’s bonding in Jodi No 1.\n\nRead the review here\n\nKarisma Kapoor plays the title role to the hilt in Dhawan’s flippant take on infidelity.\n\nAfter her hubby, played by Salman Khan, strays to get cozy with Sushmita Sen, she gangs up with his best buddy Anil Kapoor to teach him a lesson.\n\nA chartbusting soundtrack and some well-timed comic moments ensure the gag works.\n\nAnd it does.\n\nRead the review here\n\nAmitabh Bachchan and Govinda coming together in a David Dhawan comedy was never a small deal.\n\nThe duo play cops and musicians in a double role around this comedy of errors, which is, yet again, boosted by the leading actors’ impeccable comedic chops and snazzy songs -- Kissi disco mein jaaye or Makhna, the latter featuring Madhuri Dixit in a special appearance.\n\nRead the review here\n\nLong before Hera Pheri, Mr and Mrs Khiladi displayed Akshay Kumar’s flair for comedy.\n\nAs the good-for-nothing, daydreaming, astrology buying, heiress-fishing nitwit, Akki steps out of his action hero skin with goofy conviction.\n\nThat’s no less than a feat considering his co-stars are champion rib ticklers -- Juhi Chawla and Kader Khan.\n\nQuite easily one of Dhawan’s cleanest entertainers, Hero No 1 features Govinda paying tribute to Rajesh Khanna in Bawarchi in style.\n\nBrimming with his trademark humour, inimitable dance and seamless chemistry with Karisma Kapoor, Hero No 1’s family-friendly tone is a complete contrast from the double-meaning innuendoes of Dhawan’s worst film ever, Andaz.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan, Sanjay Dutt, Chunky Pandey, Rajesh Khanna and Anil Kapoor... Dhawan has practically paired Govinda along side every prominent hero of his time.\n\nIn Deewana Mastana, he brings together Govinda and AK as two diametrically different suitors vying for Juhi Chawla’s affections.\n\nThe hilarious schemes they concoct in the process and their hopeless outcome is what makes Deewana Mastana a delight to sit through.\n\nSalman Khan plays both a carefree tapori and a sophisticated gentleman in Dhawan’s giant hit, Judwaa.\n\nThe twins theme never runs out of steam in Bollywood.\n\nAnd the superstar’s antics whilst romancing a spunky Karisma Kapoor and sizzling Rambha against Anu Malik’s catchy music in Judwaa are a case in point.\n\nIn the remake of Tamil hit, Chinna Mapillai, Govinda demonstrates why he’s the master of comedy with his proficiency at clowning around.\n\nPlaying a coolie masquerading as a prince to marry his sweetheart and later a roguish chap to escape trouble, the actor transforms average mumbo jumbo into something memorable.\n\nRegardless of all flak it received for the Sarkailo Khatiyas and pelvic thrusts, which seem rather tame in today’s scenario, Raja Babu went on to acquire the status of a full-on entertainer.\n\nDhawan’s influx of sillies, Govinda’s effortless horseplay, Karisma’s raw glamour and Shakti Kapoor’s 'Nandu Sabka Bandu' squeals, continue to amuse even after 25 years.\n\nGovinda plays the tease, the cadet, the falsely framed absconder and, subsequently, the rescuer in Shola Aur Shabnam.\n\nEven as the film shifts tracks from romance and comedy to serious action in the second half, Govinda's intensity, Divya Bharti's charisma and Anupam Kher's loony manners contribute greatly to the film's super success.\n\nOne of the biggest hits of his career, Dhawan mishmashes the usual masala ingredients of comedy, romance, thriller, action and music (remember the craze around O Laal Dupatewaali Tera Naam Toh Bata) to deliver a complete package in the multistarrer Aankhen.\n\nFrom casting Raj Babbar in a curious role to Govinda’s twist-lending lookalike and Chunky Pandey’s revival along side new finds Raageshwari and Ritu Shivpuri, the 1993 entertainer packs in quite a punch."
