        "text": "The maker of films like 'Partner', 'Mujhse Shaadi Karogi', 'Haseena Maan Jaayegi' in his kitty, Dhawan is back with Sanjay Dutt-Ajay Devgn starrer action-comedy 'Rascals'.\n\nThe film released today on Dussehra, a day ahead of the Friday to cash in on the holiday crowd.\n\nDhawan, 51 feels that comedy will always rule in Bollywood.\n\n\"Though I started my career with action film but my films never had full-on action in it. It always had the tinge of comedy in it. When I tasted success in comedy with 'Aankhen' (1993), I understood that these kind of films will always be loved by the audience.\n\n\"After spending so much money on ticket, a moviegoer wants a good experience. They want to relax with the comedies in the film and I think that after the success of Salman's 'Dabangg' and 'Ready', serious cinema has taken a backstage,\" he told PTI in an interview.\n\nThe veteran filmmaker says the new directors are also experimenting with the genre.\n\n\"Now we get to see a lot of youth-centric comedies by the young directors. Almost all these are huge hits on the box-office and I really appreciate them. They have given comedy genre completely a new avatar,\" he said.\n\nDirector's son, Rohit Dhawan is also making his debut with Akshay-John starrer 'Desi Boyz' which will hit the theatres next month.\n\n\"Rohit has worked with me in many of my films. He knows the basic nuances of comedy films and he had the script in his mind a long ago.\n\n\"I didn't involve myself while he was filming it but when he showed me the complete film it was an emotional moment for me,\" Dhawan said.\n\nAfter a long time, Dhawan has teamed up with Dutt for the film 'Rascals'.\n\n\"I have done a lot of film with Sanjay and even started my career with him in 'Taaqatwar'. Sanju is very close to me and he always stands with me whenever I need him. He has evolved as an actor with the passage of time and has got a brilliant comic timing,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he had the idea of 'Rascals' in his mind eight year ago.\n\n\"The idea came into my mind eight years ago but I didn't start working on it because I didn't get the correct starcast for the film because Sanju and Ajay were both busy with their respective projects. So, I had to wait for them,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he would like to remake any of his films again, he has a long list.\n\n\"I have many good films in my career which will make good remakes. When I will be short of scripts, I would like to remake 'Shola Aur Shabnam', 'Bol Radha Bol' and 'Aankhen',\" he said."
