However, due to the flight from Poland of his older brother Boleslaw II the Bold in 1079, he was elevated to the rank of Duke of Poland. Opinions vary on whether Wladyslaw played an active role in the plot to depose his brother or whether he was handed the authority simply because he was the most proper person, being the next in line in the absence of the king and his son Mieszko Boleslawowic.\n\nIn 1080, in order to improve the relations between Poland and Bohemia, Wladyslaw married Judith, the daughter of the Duke (and first King from 1085) Vratislaus II. After this, the foreign policy of the Duke levitated strongly towards appeasement of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nHe accepted overlordship of the Empire, and when in 1085 while in Mainz the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV announced that his father-in-law Vratislaus II to be King of Bohemia and Poland, Wladyslaw did not object. He also never pursued the Royal crown due to his subservient status. Soon after, he was forced by the barons of Poland to recall from exile in Hungary his nephew and rightful heir to the Polish throne, Mieszko Boleslawowic. The young prince accepted the overlordship of his uncle and gave up his hereditary claims in exchange for becoming first in line of succession. Wladyslaw was forced to accept the terms of his nephew, because his eldest and only son at that time, Zbigniew, was illegitimate because he had been born from a union not recognized by the church. Wladyslaw's relations with the Emperor were considerably improved after his second marriage with his sister Judith (also Dowager Queen of Hungary) in 1089, who took the name Judith of Swabia after her wedding in order to distinguish herself from the late first wife of Wladyslaw (Judith of Bohemia).\n\nWladyslaw abandoned the alliance with Hungary favored by his deposed brother, and joined the anti-Papal camp. Also, he resumed paying tribute for Silesia to Bohemia. In addition Kraków and Cieszyn were ceded to Bohemia, Lubusz Land was lost to Germany while Przemysl Land in the east was lost to Halych-Ruthenia. Wladyslaw did make attempts to regain the control of Pomerania, and through numerous expeditions was temporarily (10901091) able to do so.\n\nAlthough Wladyslaw was formally Dux and an Overlord of Poland, in reality the barons who banished his brother used this victory to strengthen their position. It's not surprising therefore, that within a short time the Duke was forced to give up the government to his Count Palatine, (Polish: wojewoda) a high born noble named Sieciech. Sieciech's administration of the realm was negatively perceived by those of the barons who were not the beneficiaries of the power shift.\n\nThe birth of the future Boleslaw III completely changed the political situation in Poland. Mieszko Boleslawowic was already seventeen at that time and was, by the previous agreement made after his return, the first in line to succeed. In 1089 Mieszko died under mysterious circumstances, probably poisoned on the orders of Sieciech and Duchess Judith-Sophia. Almost immediately, Zbigniew was sent to Germany and placed in the Quedlinburg Abbey. With the idea of forcing his first-born son to take the holy vows, Wladyslaw intended to deprive him of any chance of succession.\n\nIn 1090 Sieciech, with help of Polish forces under his command, managed to gain control of Gdansk Pomerania, albeit for a short time. Major towns were garrisoned by Polish troops, the rest were burned, in order to thwart any future resistance. Several months later, however, a rebellion of native elites led to the restoration of the regions independence from Poland.\n\nSieciech's tyrannical rule reflected negatively on Wladyslaw, causing a massive political migration out of Poland. In 1093 Silesia rebelled, and the comes Magnus with the assistance of the Bohemian and Polish knights welcomed Zbigniew after he escaped from Germany; however, soon Sieciech captured the prince and imprisoned him. The increasing dissatisfaction in the country forced the release of Zbigniew in 1097. Immediately after this Wladyslaw (after an unsuccessfully retaliatory expedition against Silesia and forced to recognized Zbigniew as the legitimate heir) appointed his sons as commanders of the army which was formed in order to recapture Gdansk Pomerania.\n\nSimultaneously a great migration of Jews from Western Europe to Poland began circa 1096, around the time of the First Crusade. Wladyslaw, a tolerant ruler, attracted the Jews into his domains, and permitted to settle throughout the entire country without restriction.\n\nSoon Zbigniew and Boleslaw decided to join forces and demanded that the reigns of the government should be handed over to them. Wladyslaw agreed to divide the realm between the brothers, each to be granted his own province while he himself kept control of Mazovia and its capital at Plock. Wladyslaw also retained control of the most important cities i.e. Wroclaw, Krakow and Sandomierz. Zbigniews province encompassed Greater Poland including Gniezno, Kuyavia, Leczyca and Sieradz. Boleslaws territory included Lesser Poland, Silesia and Lubusz Land.\n\nHowever, Sieciech, alarmed by the evident diminution of his power, began to intrigue against the brothers. Wladyslaw decided to support him against his own sons. Defeated, in 1101 and after the mediation of the Archbishop of Gniezno Martin, the Duke was forced to confiscate Sieciech's properties and exiled him.\n\nWladyslaw died on 4 June 1102, without resolving the issue of succession, leaving his sons to struggle for supremacy. His body was interned in the Plock Cathedral.[2][3][4][5]\n\nChurches Founded\n\nWladyslaw founded several churches in Poland. Most notably he was the founder of the Romanesque Wawel Cathedral of which the Silver Bells Tower still remains standing. He was also very fond of Saint Giles (Polish: Idzi) to whom he founded no less than three churches: in Kraków, Inowlodz and Giebultow. This is attributed to the fact that while his first wife was finally pregnant after six years of childless marriage, the Duke sent rich gifts to the Benedictine monastery of Saint Gilles in southern France, begging for a healthy child. When a boy was born, Wladyslaw began building churches in his honor. According to legend, he also founded a church \"on the sand\" dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which was later granted to the Carmelites.\n\nHealth issues\n\nAccording to Gallus Anonymus, Wladyslaw long suffered from a debilitating ailment that affected his legs. There is also a legend which states that in 1086 Wladyslaw was affected by a terrible pox, with abscesses that affected his nose and face. According to the legend Holy Virgin appeared in the duke's dream and led him to find the cure in the sandy area outside the city. Once healed Wladyslaw founded a Church of Holiest Virgin Mary \"on the sand\" in the spot where he found the cure.\n\nMarriages and Issue\n\nBefore Wladyslaw took the title of Duke of Poland, probably during the 1070s, he had a relationship with certain Przeclawa, whose exact origins are unknown, although some sources stated that she belonged to the Prawdzic clan.[6] Her status is also a matter of dispute among the historians: some believed that she only was Wladyslaw's mistress and others asserted that she was his wife, but this union was performed under pagan rituals and in consequence not recognized by the Church as a valid marriage. By 1080, one year after Wladyslaw ascended to the Polish throne, Przeclawa either died or was sent away; it's believed by some sources that after she was dismissed by the Duke, Przeclawa took the veil under the name of Christina (Polish: Krystyna) and died around 1092.[7] This union produced a son, Zbigniew (b. ca. 1070/73 - d. ca. 1112/14), who was considered illegitimate.\n\nIn 1080 Wladyslaw married firstly with Judith (b. ca. 1056 - d. 25 December 1086), daughter of Duke (and since 1085 King) Vratislaus II of Bohemia. They had one son:\n\nBoleslaw III Wrymouth (b. 20 August 1086  d. 28 October 1138).\n\nIn 1089 Wladyslaw married secondly with Judith (b. 9 April 1054 - d. 14 March ca. 1105), daughter of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor and widow of King Solomon of Hungary. They had four daughters:\n\nSophia (b. ca. 1089 - d. bef. 12 May 1112), married bef. 1108 to Iaroslav Sviatopolkovich, Prince of Volyn (see Sviatopolk II of Kiev and Kingdom of GaliciaVolhynia)\n\nAgnes (b. ca. 1090 - d. 29 December 1127), Abbess of Quedlinburg (1110) and Gandersheim (1111).\n\nAdelaide (b. ca. 1091 - d. 25/26 March 1127), married bef. 1118 to Dietrich III, Count of Vohburg and Margrave of the Northern March.[8]\n\nA daughter (b. ca. 1092 - d. bef. 1111), married ca. 1111 with a Polish lord.\n\nNOTES:\n\n1 http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/POLAND.htm#WladislawIHermandied1102A\n\n2 Antoni Czubinski, Jerzy Topolski - \"History of Poland\" Ossolineum, Warsaw (1988)\n\n3 Lech Bielski, Mariusz Traba  \"Poczet Krolow i Ksiazat Polskich\" Park, Bielsko-Biala (2005)\n\n4 Przemyslaw Wiszewski, \"Wladyslaw Herman and his Epoch\" Wydawnictwo Dolnoslaskie, Wroclaw (2002)\n\n5 Gallus Anonymus  \"Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum\" (c.1115)\n\n6 K.
