        "text": "Presumably between 1310 and 1313, scribes produced a manuscript for Bolesław II of Mazovia, which contained a prayer for the ruler. The intercession was formulated as \"una cum papa, et episcopo, et duce,\" which suggested that ducal power and ecclesiastical authority, while not explicitly equal, shared a similar importance. In a world dominated by rituals, this had quite an important meaning, especially in light of the fact that the chant was performed during the most solemn liturgy of the year, the Easter Vigil, which is meant to represent the deeds of Redemption. The text itself suggested that those who participated in the solemnities were a part of the history of salvation. The invocation of the political and ecclesiastical elite marked the path from Adam to the heavenly Jerusalem, where bishop John, duke Bolesław and his sons Siemowit and Wańko should be present. The insertion of their names in gold was meant to grant them eternal presence with God. However, the name of the duke was written in gold majuscule script with the use of red ink, suggesting that the prayer was meant to reinforce political majesty of Bolesław II even after the restoration of the Polish kingdom by other rulers. The prayer was also a part of the phenomenon of sacrality of ducal power in Mazovia which had a longer tradition. This phenomenon was modeled on the approaches used by Piast dynasty after the loss of their royal title in the second half of the eleventh century. The sacrality of ducal power in Mazovia, however, is not very different from that of other contemporary European duchies. Mazovia may have been located on the edge of the Christian world, but the course of its history in the Middle Ages – marked by crusades against Baltic pagans, preparations for campaigns against the Mongols, attempts at the unification of the kingdom of Ruthenia with Rome, and diplomatic relations with both the papacy and the most important rulers of Central Europe – demonstrates that it should not be marginalised in scholarship, especially in regard to the phenomenon of sacralised political power.\n\nRitual of penance in the Early Middle Ages was a powerful tool for ecclesiastical authorities to intervene in secular affairs, to correct king’s sins and bring the Empire back on its way to salvation. At the same time, a figure of a crying repentant king was often utilized in royal ceremonies, illustrating his humbleness and piety – the characteristics of a true Christian. In this article, I investigate another dimension of royal penance, namely representation and interpretation of this royal ritual in narrative sources of the Ottonian age (919-1024), which were until recently somehow neglected in respect to the royal penance. My main argument is that royal penance could be interpreted as a rhetorical literary construct which enabled authors to express not only the course of events on their own, but also to find an explanation of the past, or, in some cases, to create a “useful past”. These descriptions of penances performed by kings and emperors from the Ottonian dynasty corresponded to the contemporary needs of the individual or the whole community involved in the production of a text, especially when it concerned the status of the diocese, its history, ​and prestige. In chronicles and histories of Ottonian age, royal penance gained a new specific function such as legitimating king’s decision that followed the described repentance. For example, King Otto I made a rather controversial decision, from the standpoint of ecclesiastical law, to establish dioceses in Magdeburg and Merseburg, which later was followed by abundant disputes between ecclesiastical communities and the king. The most important narrator of these events, Thietmar, bishop of Merseburg, legitimated this dubious royal decision in his Chronicle by imagining Otto’s repentance at the battle of Lechfeld, where he made an invocation to form a new diocese. Similarly, other Ottonian historiographers gave the same kind of power to the ritual of the royal penance, so that it could act as a retrospective legal argument in disputes between royal wish and canon law."
