        "text": "Bolesław III (born Aug. 20, 1085—died Oct. 28, 1138) was a prince of Poland who introduced into his country the senioriate system, by which the eldest son received the major part of the royal inheritance. He converted the people of Pomerania to Christianity.\n\nSon of Władysław I Herman, ruler of Poland, and Judith of Bohemia, Bolesław III and his illegitimate elder half brother, Zbigniew, each ruled a Polish province during their father’s lifetime. Bolesław III succeeded to his father’s princely title (no Polish ruler assumed the title of king from 1082 to 1296) in 1102 and spent the next several years fighting Zbigniew for control of the country. Not long after repelling an invasion of Silesia (1109) by the German king Henry V, Bolesław, who had exiled Zbigniew in 1107, allowed his half brother to return; soon, however, he accused Zbigniew of treason and had him blinded. Zbigniew died shortly thereafter."
