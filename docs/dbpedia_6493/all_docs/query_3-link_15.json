        "text": "The ancestors of today’s inhabitants of Plock erected their castle on the bank of the Vistula river in the 10th century, believing that the place would guarantee them better defence. This strategic location was at a crossroads of shipping routes and has been inhabited for centuries.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Płock was one of the most important administrative and cultural centres in Poland. For a decade between 1037 and 1047, it was capital of the independent Mazovian state of Miecław. Moreover, between 1079 and 1138, during the reign of Władysław I Herman and Bolesław III Wrymouth, Plock was the capital of Poland.\n\nPłock received city rights in 1237.\n\nModern era\n\nThe royal city and capital of the Plock voivodeship lived its golden age in the 16th century. This was not meant to last long, however, as it suffered plague, fires and war with Sweden over the next two centuries.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century Plock was rebuilt as a new town with many German immigrants. Later being annexed by Prussia, included into the Duchy of Warsaw and integrated into the Congress Poland (or Kingdom of Poland) in 1815, it was finally entirely annexed by the Russian Empire.\n\nDuring WWI the city suffered German occupation (1915-18) and in 1920 showed heroic bravery during the Polish-Soviet war. Following the German invasion during the Second world war, Plock was renamed Schröttersburg.\n\nIn the Royal Chapel of the Cathedral Basilica, there is a sarcophagus with the remains of the then rulers: Władysław I Herman and Bolesław III Krzywousty. The castle was once the seat of the Mazovian dukes.\n\nSource: City of Plock"
