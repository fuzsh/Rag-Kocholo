        "text": "I have been writing Babciaâs Closet for almost five years and none of my articles have received as much attention as Feb. 16âs \"George Washington, the United States' First Polish-American President.\" The comments Iâve received have ranged from, âWowâ and âNeatâ to âI would need to see some proof to believe that.â and âHeâs not REALLY a Polish American.â So Iâm going to use this article to address some of these comments, cover a correction, and include a bibliography to the Feb. 16 article at the end.\n\nBut first, while weâre on the subject of Washington, genealogy, and proofs, you can now order the America the Beautiful Quarters 2017 Silver Proof Set from the U.S. Mint, and this year one of the locations is Ellis Island. With the now standard Washington obverse, the reverse depicts an immigrant family, with a mix of excitement and trepidation, arriving at Ellis Island. This image was designed by Barbara Fox, sculpted by Phebe Hemphill, and will be released for circulation on Aug. 28, so the quarter should be showing up in your pocket by autumn.\n\nWhen I researched Washingtonâs genealogy, I ended up with over two dozen sources. After doing all that work, I subsequently learned of Dr. Justin Glenn, the registrar of the National Society of Washington Family Descendants, and his 9 volume history of the Washingtons.\n\nIn Volume 3: Royal Descents of the Presidential Branch, Glenn traces a number of lineages from Edward I King of England to the first president. His path connecting George to the Kings of Wessex turned out to be the same path I used to get to Mieszko, and became a great double check to my other documentation.\n\nOnce Washington was connected to Edward I, you can just click through Wikipedia or Geni to reach the Polish kings, but neither of those websites is truly reliable.\n\nTo connect Edward to his mother and her family I used Eleanor of Provence: Queenship in 13th-century England, and then went even further back to her great grandfather Alfonso II of Aragon, husband of Sancha of Castile with The chronicle of William of Puylaurens: the Albigensian crusade and its aftermath. I also breezed through Eagles of Savoy to clear up some of the connections.\n\nThe kingdom of León-Castilla under king Alfonso VII, 1126-1157 covered Sancha, her mother Rica (Richeza ), wife of King Alfonso VII of Castile and connected the whole family to Boleslaw III Wrymouth. With the link to Boleslaw, I just flipped to the back of my well worn copy of A Concise History of Poland listing off the Piast dynasty all the way back to Mieszko I.\n\nThen the question becomes, can these sources be trusted? For me the answer is yes. Most of the authors have PhDs, all are experts in their fields, half the books were published by a university press, and each has an extensive bibliography with scores of citations. I live by the motto, a book is only as good as its bibliography, and by that standard all these books are excellent.\n\nAs for was Washington really a Polish-American? Yes, in so that he was an American of Polish ancestry. Now, was he fully embracing Polish culture and traditions, trading pączki recipes with Pulaski, and discussing the works of Kochanowski with Kosciuszko? Probably not.\n\nAnd while the Poles can claim him as one of their own, especially since he is a lineal descendant of Mieszko I, so too can the Aragonese (Spain), Austrians, Bohemians, English, French, Germans, and Ukrainians, and thatâs just from one line. Considering that we all have 134,217,728 25th great-grandparents, Iâm sure that there are plenty more nationalities that can be hyphenated with American and applied to Washington.\n\nFinally a correction; it was pointed out that in the published article, King Boleslaw I the Brave and his son, Mieszko II Lambert had the same birth and death years, 967-1025. It should have read, Mieszko II Lambert (990-1034).\n\nBibliography for George Washington, the United States' first Polish-American President:\n\n- Cox, Eugene L. Eagles of Savoy.
