        "text": "The last few days have been a bit of a blur for me, as any good Englishman would do, I celebrated the Royal wedding with beer, good food and DIY.\n\nBut now, I live in a republic and I am happy to be in this republic, but Poland once had a monarchy and early this morning with the aid of Wikipedia and Norman Davies, I set about finding the three most Kick-ass Polish Monarchs.\n\n1- Bolesław I Chrobry\n\nBorn in 967, Bolesław is the kind of guy you either rate or hate. Many people think he liked to fight a little too much and this overzealous battle nutter of a king caused nothing but serious fiscal problems for the Polish people. However, I disagree. Bolesław was the sort of king no one messed with, Bolesław wasn’t afraid to fight both the Germans and the Russians at the same time. Bolesław even sent crack troops to help his nephew Canute in his conquest of England. Look at the map and appreciate the extent of his kick-ass abilities. As for his poor financial abilities, in 967 what else are you going to spend your money on? if not on battling and general war-mongery?\n\nSmall man syndrome?\n\n2 – Władysław I the elbow-high / the short arse\n\nIn 1138, the not so bright Polish king Bolesław III Wrymouth left Poland divided up into principalities. Władysław was born in 1260, inherited some land and through a little good fortune inherited some more and in 1304, decided to take upon the arduous task of re-uniting Poland. To do so he would need to fight a few Germans, please some nobles and twist the arm of the pope. However by 1320, Władysław had returned Poland to the point in left off in 1138 and left the basis and foundations for future Kings to build Poland into one of the greatest European empires.\n\nPolish – Lithuanian Commonwealth 1686\n\n3- Jan III Sobieski –\n\nA few hundred years later and Poland, through the help of a union with Lituania had become one of the most powerful countries in Europe, but it desperately needed stability and Sobieski gave it just that. Sobieski rocks because he was a more than good military commander who beat the Turks black and blue in the 1683 Battle of Vienna. He was such an able military commander that he controlled not only Polish forces in the battles but also German and Austrian troops. He was so impressive, other European monarchs nicknamed him ‘The saviour of western civilization’ – what a nick name! – oh and Sobieski Vodka is named after him.\n\nOf course, these are just my opinions but I do love reading about Polish kings and Polish history in general. For anybody who would like to know more about Polish history I’m sure any British Council libraries will have copies of Norman Davies’ work about Poland – I specifically recommend ‘Heart of Europe’ because it’s more easy going than the immense two tome ‘God’s Playground’\n\nThis must be the number one most common question people ask me and it’s an impossible question to answer, second most common question is probably, ‘how much money do I NEED to earn in Poland’ which again is impossible to answer because I’m not you and you will need a different sum of money to live on than me but nevertheless I do give some advice\n\nWhen I moved to Poland I made a whole lifestyle change and promised myself to start again. Out with the old and in with the new so to speak. I decided not to be dependent on a car and not to be dependent on credit. After making these two changes my lifestyle is now pretty relaxed. I no longer feel I have to work here in Poland more like I work to go on holiday or work to buy a new floor for the kitchen.\n\nOnce more I will regurgitate a post I made a long time ago and I think it adequately answers the second question, ‘How much do I need to earn in Poland’ plus it will give many other perspective workers in Poland a figure that they should aim for. Basically, If you earn 710PLN per week you will survive. You can buy some ciggies, drink a few beers, maybe even be able to save some away and importantly, not live in a complete shit hole. But saying that, If you plan to live in Poland long term you need to adjust your sights somewhat and aim for around 1000PLN per week. However you need to then increase that figure if you will factor children or a car into the equation.\n\nI remember when I first started in Poland that figure was the holy grail for me and other teachers, and it seemed a little unrealistic to achieve. We all heard the rumours of English teachers who worked for themselves and earned 1000PLN per week and thought they were either fictitious or living the life of riley. But I will say this, If you work hard in Poland and continue to develop yourself (Even as an English teacher) there is no reason why you can’t earn plus 0f 1000PLN per week or even more.\n\nFor those interested below is my original attempt at tackling this subject; from around August 2010 (I think)\n\nA very common question I get asked is ‘How much money will I earn in Poland teaching English’…\n\nI will try to answer it here using my Economics degree…\n\nYou will be working as a teacher and teachers are never rich, please bear that in mind! but it’s easily possible to earn a better than average income in Poland as a language teacher.\n\nLook at this scenario…\n\nPolish GDP per capita is somewhere around $11,000.\n\nIgnore the bullshit about PPP or GDP being an unreal average income value, look at what this figure represent… It is the sum of everything produced in Poland divided by the number of people living in Poland. Therefore it is the empirical average income and your best indicator as to what to aim for in terms of income.\n\nlet’s take that figure of $11,000 and turn in into PLN, using an exchange rate of 3.1 as an approximate 12 month average.\n\nSo $11.000 x 3.1 = 34,100PLN\n\ndivide that figure by 48 weeks – the other four weeks of the year are your holiday 😉\n\nleaves 710PLN per week.\n\ndivide this figure by 25 hours per week, an average language teacher workload…\n\nleaves 29PLN as an average lesson fee. Now check this figure by browsing on Ang.pl\n\nand you will see that the average lesson fee is around 30PLN.\n\nMarket forces, supply and demand, whatever you want to call it, 710PLN is the figure I aim to earn every week and I do OK. If I want I nice holiday, I work a few more hours. Your ability to manipulate your workload is a useful luxury as an English teacher. Achieving an average lesson fee of 30PLN is easy to do also, in fact most hours you get working for a school will generate you between 40 and 60PLN per hour. You’ll never be rich as an English teacher but maintaining a nice lifestyle with a little bit of effort is easy to do here in Poland.\n\nOf course, depending on your lifestyle and location, you might need more or less money but 710PLN is the magic number for me and the magic number I quote to all the other newbies who ask. You might here stories of English teachers who earn 6k or 7k per month here in Poland, it’s possible to do, especially in Warsaw, but I bet they’ll be working there arses off to achieve it. Once or twice over the past year I took home 6K in a month but I worked practically everyday to do it and it just isn’t necessary.\n\nIf everyweek you take home 710PLN, you’ll do fine.\n\nMy first post on this matter was here\n\nZameldowanie and dreams of riches\n\nwhich was back in 2009 when I dreamt up a crazy idea to make the British banking system even more fragile than it was using my shiny new Polish passport. I still don’t have the passport but I’m hoping it will change this year 🙂\n\nOne of the first things you will need to do when you settle down in Poland is apply for your ‘Adres Zameldowania’. This is basically your ‘official’ address, and yes your actual address can be different but the government will generally communicate with you to your ‘official’ address. The idea is a communist relic but it serves a purpose today as being the governments way of communicating with you, serving official documents as well as being the first place they look if you’ve been naughty.\n\nWhy do I need to get an ‘Official’ address? Well, it shows the Polish government that you have somewhere to live and so they will grant you permanent residency (which I’ll talk about in a later blog post) and secondly you need it in order to complete the correct tax registration. Also, I have read that without an official address you’re, in theory, required to pay tourist tax for everyday you’re in Poland, although of course this is impossible to prove – many people survive in Poland without an official address but from my experience life is just easier if you have one. If your long term plans are in Poland and you’re thinking of a passport like me, it’s best to get it all over and done with.\n\nYou can read loads of blog posts and forums with commentary on the topic but the one flaw is that people assume their experiences are the ‘correct’ experiences however all newcomers to Poland should realise that bureaucratic procedures can vary immense between regions and tax authorities. So today I have tried to collate and collect all the best information possible to give newbies a fighting chance against Polish bureaucracy.\n\nTo get your Zameldowanie, you need to find someone that is willing to let you be registered officially at their house. There’s no requirements concerning who this person is or isn’t – it can be anyone. But finding this person can be difficult because once you’re registered to one official address you always have right to abode and it can be difficult for the landlord to revoke this. For me, I used my father in law – but I know others that have just paid random people for the permission.\n\nOnce you’ve found this person – you need to head to your local Urząd Miasta and go preferably with the landlord of the property you will become resident at. Take your passport with you and if you can take an extra body who can help translate between all the involved parties!\n\nThe main point of my story here is that there are many conflicting ideas to as of whether the landlord need to be there in person. In my experience they do so I think it’s just best to assume they are necessary than to have loads of wasted journeys.\n\nFinally you need to do this in office hours so it can be challenging to get everyone in one place and be prepared to ask loads of random questions concerning you, your background and your family. And if your registering to an address in a small town or village don’t expect the person in the tax office to have any idea what to do. I remember when I first went to my local tax office and said I wanted to apply for an official address – the women looked like I had just eaten her child or something… pure terror.\n\nNot long ago I added my email address to this blog so people could make contact and apart from the friendly ‘hellos’ (which I always enjoy) a few people have been asking more general questions about living in Poland.\n\nTherefore, Welcome to my new series of posts titled\n\n“Living in Poland tips for beginners”\n\nFirst up ‘Finding a house’\n\nDan from Norwich ( I assume U.K.) – asked ‘What are the best accommodation options for me if I’m thinking of moving to Poland? Where do I begin to look?‘\n\n0. Tip number ‘0’ is not even a tip, it’s common sense. Do your research first. Newspapers and the Internet will give you the background knowledge you need. Learning the absolute basic associated Polish words i.e. Dom, will also help you.\n\n1. I would firstly recommend looking around at local Polish community websites where you live now. Most big citites or even small towns will have some kind of Polish community in the U.K. and obviously large cities in the U.S and other places will have the same. Go into Polish shops or look around in local newspapers. I remember when I lived in Stoke, quite a few Polish shops had a small notice board offering services or even accommodation back in Polska. It’s a good place to begin because odds are; you can meet somebody and arrange everything face to face PRIOR to leaving the country. So you get the peace of mind value. Plus you can find out about associated services such as movers or people with a van driving across the continent in your general direction.\n\n2. Check out and post on sites like PolishForums. The community on sites like PF is pretty strong and is very regional. If you post a question about ‘Looking for a house in Oława’ – Somebody from Oława will point you in the best general direction to start. Try Facebook and search for ‘Wrocław expats’, ‘Łodz expats’ etc… to find other online communities you can pester.\n\n3. Consider ‘Hostelling’ for the first few weeks. This is a popular option by many people I know in Wrocław. Come to Poland lightweight at first, stay in a hostel and then get your feet on the ground and talk to people. Meet other expats, meet the locals and ask if they know anybody. The friend of a friend scenario in Poland always works best and you can find yourself a reliable good deal this way or if you’re inclined, find accommodation with other expats with your native tongue… If you don’t fancy jumping into the deep end straight away. When you’re in the city you want to live in, just by walking around and looking out for the little home-made ads on lampposts or notice boards will also be your best opportunity to find a good value room.\n\nWhen everything is sorted, pop home and get ready for the big move.\n\n4. Maybe you want to buy a house? If you have any kind of equity from your home country, it’s possible to find a very cheap but decent home in Poland. In my experience villages offer the lowest house prices (plus a more authentic cultural experience). This option may be suitable for people wanting to live in Poland for the longer term but obviously there is shit loads more hassle and worry involved. But it’s possible. And I dare say 30% of the expats I know here are all fully fledged home owners. Companies like ‘Connect Overseas’ will help you with the finance as for the paperwork… I have no good advice, get the help of a local lawyer then grin and bare it.\n\n5. Advice on Price. This is impossible to give because in varies wildly. From my experience, last year I rented a two bed room apartment in a town for 700PLN but I know people who rent shared rooms in big cities and pay 500PLN. Generally, I think it’s easily possible to find yourself a nice place in big cities for around 1500PLN but you need to add another 500PLN for rates. But everything is subjective; my idea of nice might be your idea of shit or even luxurious.\n\nWarsaw will obviously be the most expensive and generally, the further east you go the cheaper (everything) gets.\n\nThere you have it, my advice for newbies but as this is a dynamic blog (or I like to think it is), If any readers want to contradict or share there experience, please feel free.\n\nThe Immam let us have a good look round despite being underdressed and 50% female\n\nTo begin with, if you want to read a good blog post about expat Englishmen in Egypt,\n\nEDIM already beat me to it here:\n\nSnow to Sand\n\nFor me, going to Egypt was a chance to have a well deserved break in the sun and to learn a bit about a new country, culture and to suss out any potential teaching opportunities… should I need to leave Poland in a hurry 😉\n\nQuite a few peeps have commented that I must be crazy to go there now but let’s be realistic: no body wants tourists to be hurt.\n\nIn Egypt I tried to pass myself off as a Polish man because things are inevitably cheaper if you say you’re Polish and not English. Russians are not well liked in Egypt because they are seen as being rude which I kind of understand but also think it’s a bit harsh. English people are seen as drunkards which is true, Americans as cowards because they have all disappeared since the ‘crisis’ but Polish people are seen to be people Egyptians have a shared history with. Years of oppression overturned by protesting and the hopes of a bright future powered by European economies.\n\nFrom my perspective as a fake Pole Englishman. The closest correlation I saw between Egyptian culture and Polish culture was the fact that both are hardcore workaholics. Sorry for these generalisations but it has to be said, I saw the similarities.\n\nIt’s also pretty clear to see that Murbarak was/is hated by everybody on the street. Without fail through the hundreds of people I spoke to in a bizarre mixture of English/Polish and Arabic everyone said that Murbarak going was a good thing. The picture to the left was given to me buy someone I spoke to, it celebrates the revolution and for some reason blogger won’t let me orientate it correctly\n\nAPC – for traffic control and sun shelter\n\nIn terms of the army. They seem to have everything under control. Movement is monitored by checkpoints on the edge of all cities and towns but the army rarely bothers any form of transport carrying tourists. Taxis and minibuses are often spot checked by uniformed or plain clothes Police officers giving the overall all round effect of feeling quite safe.\n\nThe only unusual thing I thought was that our hotel had a sort of security procedure similar to an airport with a metal detector and a pat down. Sometimes they just waved us through but once or twice we had to do the procedure properly. I’m not entirely sure what they were expecting to find on us tourists but hey ho, it all added to the sense of adventure.\n\nWe had planned on doing a lot of travelling but that went to pot when I realised how luxurious life can be in an all-inclusive resort with limitless beer but we did get out and about for a few days. Heading west towards Libya was not an option because travelling through Cairo takes a long time so we headed north towards Israel and Jordan (subject of a future post). The biggest benefit of travelling outside of the cosy resorts is the fact you can really see the level of development. In some places the standard of living was shocking.\n\nReally shocking.\n\n2$ a day is what the average Egyptian lives on and when you see all the tourists and the Suez canal – you begin to see why people got cheesed off. Egyptians should be rolling in cash. The people who have jobs in the resorts are the lucky ones. They have health care, free holidays (at other resorts) and the possibilities of tips from tourists but for everyone else…it’s a pretty bleak, dog eat dog world.\n\nThe haggling for absolutely everything you buy would be the main reason why teaching in Egypt would be a problem. Everyone would constantly take you for a tourist and try to charge some ludicrous price like the guy in the petrol station who tried to make me pay 10$ for 1.5l of Pepsi. If you wanted to be a teacher I’m not sure who would pay you. I mean a lot of the rich people in Egypt now are slightly pre-occupied with where the hammer will fall next although I’m sure in Cairo you could find easy work. But aside from the rich people, everybody else just couldn’t afford your services. If you earn 2$ a days how much can you spare for an English teacher?\n\nAlthough I have to say, In a few years and if Egypt does begin to develop… I’ll head out there like a shot. I can’t imagine how good my tan will be after a few months living out there. I have found a few job adverts online for English teachers claiming to pay 500$ (in Egypt you would live very well) but obviously they are for international schools and I’m not sure how recent or genuine they are.\n\nFinally, I have had the good fortune to have visited many places in our small world but Egypt would definitely be a place I would return to. Good people, Good weather.\n\nPrior to flying out to Egypt, I had the chance to spend 1 day walking around Warsaw, the often underrated capital city of my beloved Polska. So this post is for anybody who is new to Warsaw or finds themselves unexpectedly in said city with a few hours to spare and wants to see some interesting stuff.\n\nThe DYSP Tour of Warsaw…\n\nIcon of Warsaw: The palace of Culture and Science\n\n1.Warsawa Centralna: Start off by grabbing a quick beer in the underground maze of shops, bars and coffeeshops at the train station. If you have a lot of cash to burn you can go to the huge shopping centre next door and when you’re poor again you can head outside and take in a good look of the Pałac Kultury i Nauki: the symbol of Warsaw and a gift from Uncle Stalin… for free.\n\n2. Head North to Ul. Prózna: This street has been left more or less exactly the same as it was in WWII. Fresh with shrapnel scars etc… interesting and eerie.\n\n3. Head North East to Plac. Piłsudskiego: Here you can see the tomb of the Unknown Soldier which appears to be constantly guarded and nearby is the University and Ogród Saski, which is a good place to drink a takeaway coffee early in the morning.\n\n4. Head North along Krakowskie Przedmieście: Along this route you can see the beautiful Hotel Bristol and the slightly boring Presidential Palace.\n\n5. Continue North into the Old town: This is the more touristy part of Warsaw. Good place to buy souvenirs and see some of the medieval architecture.\n\nCiekawy…no?…\n\n6. Head East along Most Śląsko past the Zoo. Metropolitan Orthodox Cathedral of St. Mary Magdalene – cathedral of Polish Orthodox Church in Warsaw built in second half of XIX century: For me this is the best thing in Warsaw. The church looks exactly like orthodox churches I associate with Russia and is genuinely a beautiful sight to behold. Also the area you are now in is called Praga, where you can visit the Zoo and take a cheap dinner in the shopping centre opposite the church.\n\n7. Catch the tram south to Park Łazienkowski: This is the part of the journey most suitable for couples looking to indulge in a bit of romance. You can take a walk through the park and take a look at the squirrels (everyone loves squirrels) and I remember peacocks in the park and a floating palace but more importantly, a good place to buy waffles. Close by is the British Embassy and also in the park is a quite interesting Chopin monument.\n\n8. Take a slow walk North back to Warsawa Centralna: Along the way north from the park I remember seeing a ‘genuine’ British fish and chip shop which might interest the Brits but for others I also remember a place where you can buy a beer for 5pln… keep your eyes open.\n\n9. Arrive at Warsaw train station i.e. Warsawa Centralna.\n\nSo, that’s it, my tour. I’m not saying that everything to see in Warsaw is here or that my route is good/optimal/interesting in anyway, but it was to route I took.\n\nI’m also welcome to any other suggestions or amendments people might want to suggest.\n\nGenerally, people I have spoken to don’t like Warsaw because it’s a cold place full of unfriendly people and it’s style is some crazy mix of the old and the new. Well, In my opinion all capital cities fall into these traps but Warsaw has something else, notably interesting churches, communist towers and cheap beer! enjoy!\n\np.s. some other good links for sightseeing in Warsaw:\n\nThings to do in Warsaw\n\nPZU Warsaw posts\n\nTours in Warsaw\n\nVideo guide to Warsaw\n\nMłochów"
