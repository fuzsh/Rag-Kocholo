        "text": "Back | Next\n\nContents\n\nChapter Sixteen\n\nMy third endeavor was the loom. The count insisted that we set up the loom as a permanent fixture in his hall. The situation in the cloth industry annoyed him, and he wanted the loom as a showpiece for his summer guests. The concept of keeping a profitable trade secret was entirely foreign to him. I never saw him really concerned about money at all. What he wanted was the prestige of being the man who cracked the strangling cloth monopoly.\n\nUnderstand that the hall was a large room. It could handle a hundred people at a sit-down dinner. It took up most of the ground floor of the castle, and the ceiling was fully four meters high.\n\nIn order to use as little floor space as possible, my loom design was more vertical than horizontal. A loom, in essence, is a simple device. It has a framework to support a few thousand spools of thread that go lengthwise through the cloth produced. Whether this was the warp or woof, I didn't know. I wasn't a weaver, and in fact I made up my own terminology as I went along. We didn't have a warp or a woof. We had long threads and short threads.\n\nThere are some frames that loop around the long threads to spread them apart in the proper order so that the short threads can be passed through. The simplest number of these spreaders would be two, but I wanted the loom to be able to produce more complicated weaves, like tweeds, so I built it with six spreaders, each of which connected with one-sixth of the long threads. There is a shuttle that holds the short thread as it gets tossed back and forth, and there is a thing that beats the short threads tightly together. Finally, there is a roll for the finished cloth.\n\nI was sure that on modern looms there is a friction device that holds the long threads tight, yet lets them advance as cloth was made. However, I couldn't think up a simple way of doing it. It would have to be very simple, since we needed a thousand of them.\n\nI solved the problem by bypassing it. The carpenter drilled an array of holes, thirty-six wide by forty-eight high, directly into the wooden wall of the count's hall. Into these he pounded 1,728 pegs to hold the long spools of thread. This was a convenient number, since it was twelve cubeda thousand in our new base-twelve arithmetic.\n\nFrom there, the threads were to loop up over a pole near the ceiling, down under a suspended pole that could be raised as the threads were consumed, and then up to the four-meter ceiling again and down through the spreaders, the beater, and the cloth bolt.\n\nThis arrangement let you make eight meters of cloth before you had to loosen each of the thousand spools and lower the suspended pole again.\n\nA working solution if not a perfect one.\n\nThe finished loom took up about four square meters of floor space, eight if you counted the area for the two operators. It produced a band of cloth two meters wide.\n\nSir Stefan waddled in one sunset as I was talking to Vitold about the spreaders. Sir Stefan was in full armor and heavily bundled and cloaked against the cold. \"Another piece of witchcraft, Sir Conrad?\" His voice was weary.\n\nVitold crossed himself but remained silent.\n\n\"A loom for making cloth,\" I said. \"I wish you would knock off this nonsense about witchcraft.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, is it? Then how do you explain that witch's familiar of a mare you own?\"\n\n\"I bought Anna in Cracow not two months ago. She's nothing but a good, well-trained horse.\"\n\n\"Indeed? Do you know what I saw last night? I saw your familiar leave the stables, go to the latrines, and relieve herself there! I followed her back to her stall and saw her putting the bar back in place. That's no natural horse!\" He was glaring at me.\n\n\"Yeah, the stable boy told me she didn't soil her stall, but so what? If a dog can be housebroken, why not a horse? I told you she was well trained.\"\n\n\"Well trained? She's some manner of demon! Conrad, know that my father is Baron Jaroslav, the greatest of Lambert's vassals and well known to Duke Henryk. I swear that they will hear of your warlock's tricks!\" he shouted as he stomped out into the snow.\n\nVitold crossed himself again.\n\n\"Damn it, Vitold, don't you start believing that horseshit! You've been building this thing. You know there is nothing magic in it!\"\n\n\"I can only do as my betters bid me.\" He returned to work, but you could tell that his heart wasn't in it.\n\nWe were a month getting the loom built, and then I asked for 1,728 spools of thread, each perhaps 500 meters long, to string it with.\n\nI was looked on with horror. That amount of thread simply did not exist.\n\nI said that I had to have it or I couldn't thread the loom. At least that much more would be needed for the short threads.\n\nSo the girls dug out their distaffs and went to work.\n\nIt was my turn to be horrified. The distaff was nothing more than a small wooden cross. You stretched some wool between the cross and your left hand, and then your right hand gave the cross a spin. This twisted the thread. Then you wrapped the half meter of thread around the cross, stretched some more wool, etc.\n\nThe truly labor-intensive part of clothmaking wasn't in the weaving at all. It was in the spinning. I had taken off on a project without first knowing what all the parameters were. You might expect this of a beginner but not of a seasoned engineer.\n\nI told the girls to put away their distaffs and went to work on a spinning wheel.\n\nWe were five weeks getting a spinning wheel working, partially because I had to come up with a wood lathe first. Also, we lost a week because I didn't realize that you have to have two loops of string from the wheel to the spindle, one to turn the spool and one to turn the twister a little faster.\n\nOur first spinning wheel looked a lot like what you would see in a modern museum, because that's what I modeled it on. There were a lot of design flaws that were cleared up on subsequent models. The bench seat was uncomfortable, and one couldn't wear a long dress while using it. Our ladies wore a floor-length dress or nothing. Calf-length dresses were for field workers. The foot pedal gave the operator leg cramps, and it was discovered that if one tied a string from one's big toe to the crank of the wheel, it worked a lot easier.\n\nI had learned a long time ago that if the operators don't approve of your engineering, your machines don't work. If they wanted a string on their big toe, they got a string on their big toe.\n\nIt was a lot easier to work if the spindle faced the operator at about an arm's length rather than being placed horizontally under her breasts.\n\nOur third model had places for six operators, who sat facing each other in a circle. The job was boring, and they liked to talk.\n\nIt took six spinsters to keep up with the loom. Lambert solved this problem by putting on a few more ladies-in-waiting.\n\nAlso, it took two menone holding the chisel, one turning the cranksix weeks on our new wood lathe to make enough spools to put the thread on.\n\nI subsequently found out that spinning and weaving are two of the seven production steps necessary in making the crudest of homespun cloth. To produce the best commercial cloth required some thirty production steps.\n\nIt was going to take a while.\n\n\"Look, Sir Conrad, you'll be able to get this going by Easter, won't you?\" the count asked.\n\n\"Well, the spinning and weaving at least, my lord. I don't think that we have enough washed and carded wool to keep us going for long.\"\n\n\"I'm ahead of you there. I've already sent word to my knights to send me all of their wool, and all of it washed and carded. Also, they are to send me two-thirds of the wool from this spring's shearing, and the acreage in flax is to be doubled.\"\n\n\"Excellent, my lord. You realize that weaving linen takes a slightly different loom, don't you? It takes more threads, closer together, and only two spreaders.\"\n\n\"What of it? Vitold can build more now that you've shown him the way. We'll have a dozen looms going by next year! You just put your mind to the problems of washing and carding.\"\n\n\"The washing is simple enough, but I'm still not sure of the carding.\"\n\n\"You will solve it.\" I wasn't sure if he was expressing confidence in my abilities or giving me an order. Sheep's wool is much finer than human hair and a sheep goes all year without combing it. As a result, it is incredibly tangled, and untangling it is what carding is all about.\n\n\"Sir Conrad, thus far you have seen us only as a small agrarian community. You must realize that Okoitz is the capital of a fair-sized province. After Easter, all sorts of people will be coming through, my uncle and liege lord, Duke Henryk the Bearded, among them. It is essential that we make a good impression.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord. You say that Henryk is your uncle?\"\n\n\"Well, of sorts. Henryk's father was Boleslaw the Tall; my grandfather, Miesko the Stumbling, was Boleslaw's brother, both sired by Wladyslaw the Exile.\"\n\nWestern countries give their rulers numbers. We Poles prefer nicknames. It's friendlier.\n\n\"In addition, after our father's untimely death, Henryk raised my brother Herman and me until we came of age. Being the eldest, he got the established city of Cieszyn and its environs. I got the Vistula-Odra Road and perforce have had to build my own town.\"\n\nAnother difference between eastern and western Europe was that in the west, inheritance was by primogeniture. The oldest son inherited everything, and the rest were out of luck. They might get a good job with the Church or in the army, but they were commoners.\n\nIn Poland, the rule was to divide things fairly evenly between the sons, with a very substantial dowry for the daughters. This was a nicer system, but it had the disadvantage of shattering the country and weakeningoften destroyingcentral authority. A hundred years before, Boleslaw the Wrymouth, the last king of Poland, had divided the country up among his five sons, giving only nominal authority to the eldest. That is all very well unless you are about to get invaded.\n\n\"Certainly an ambitious project, my lord.\"\n\n\"So it is. But we are midway on the road, and Okoitz has to grow. Now that you've had time to look it over, what do you think of it, Sir Conrad?\"\n\nThe place to build cities is at the end of a road, where pack mules change cargoes with riverboats, but I thought it wise not to mention this. And as a military defense, wooden walls only four meters high were a sick joke. The Mongols could take it in hours. But for now, there was nothing I could do about it, and I saw no reason to irritate my liege lord. \"In many ways excellent, my lord. This business of building cottages side by side, sharing a wall and built against the outer wall, saves materials and heat. But I worry about fire. A single fire could burn down all of Okoitz. I have seen places where they build every other dividing wall out of brick to serve as a fire-stop.\"\n\n\"I can see that you haven't priced bricks and mortar, Sir Conrad.\"\n\n\"No, my lord, I haven't. But the new mill should give some protection. It will have a water tank higher than the church. I plan on having a fire hose long enough to reach any part of Okoitz.\"\n\n\"Then see to it.\"\n\nDismissed, I went out to the bailey just as a strange procession was coming through the main gate. Sir Stefan was riding proudly in the lead, followed by a dozen peasants holding on to strong chains. Between the peasants, snarling, tugging, trying hard to get away, was a fair-sized brown bear chained around the neck.\n\n\"What on earth\" I said to Stefan.\n\n\"A bit of sport, Sir Conrad,\" he said, getting down from his horse. \"We were a month trapping him and most of the day getting him chained and out of the pit. But he's a beauty, hey?\"\n\n\"But what would you want with a live bear?\"\n\n\"Why, to bait him, of course! Look you, Sir Conrad, what would you say to a gentlemanly wager? I'll bet you a thousand pence that that bear can kill six dogs before it's brought down. What say you?\"\n\nI heard someone behind me whisper, \"That's a sucker bet. That bear is good for a dozen, easy.\" But I ignored it.\n\n\"What do you mean, bait him?\" I asked.\n\n\"You don't know the sport? Well, we'll chain him to that post and turn the dogs on him. A good bear like this one can go for hours before he's ripped apart.\"\n\n\"That's horrible!\" I said, meaning it. \"What a disgusting, brutal, ugly thing to do.\"\n\n\"Well, damn! If you don't like it, don't look!\"\n\n\"But you can't do this! There are children here!\"\n\n\"What of it? They've seen bear baiting before. Anyway, how do you dare tell me what I can or cannot do with my property?\"\n\n\"Then I'll buy it from you! What is a bear worth?\" I poured some silver out of my pouch and into my hand. \"Is a hundred pence enough?\"\n\nHe swatted my hand aside, spraying my money onto the snow. None of the peasants dared touch it.\n\n\"It's not for sale, damn you! Anyway, what would you do with a bear? Make another warlock's familiar out of it?\"\n\nActually, discounting the stupidity about familiar creatures, Stefan had posed a good question. What could I do with a bear? I couldn't possibly keep itit might break loose and kill somebody. I couldn't let it goas angry as it was, it would surely kill somebody.\n\nBy this time, the bear had been fastened to the post, and a large crowd had gathered in a wide circle around the animal. It was on its hind legs, straining at the chains, trying desperately for vengeance.\n\nI walked into the circle. \"Blood sports are cruel and wicked!\" I shouted. I looked to the priest for support, but he just looked away. \"If you won't think about the bear, think about the brutality to your dogs!\"\n\n\"What else are the dogs for?\" Stefan smirked. \"Sir Conrad, you look as funny as the bear.\"\n\nThe peasants had sense enough to keep quiet, to not get involved. But they didn't want to miss the action, either.\n\n\"Laugh if you want to, but I won't let you do this.\"\n\n\"Just how do you plan to stop it?\" Stefan had an ugly laugh.\n\nAnother good question. Once the bear was chained to the post, he couldn't be unchained without getting past him, and that bear was irate. The only thing I could do for the animal was to give it a clean death.\n\n\"Like this,\" I said. I drew my sword and stepped close to the beast. On his hind legs, he was taller than I and must have weighed three times as much, swatting at me with his massive paws.\n\nI timed his swipes and swung at him when both his paws were down, catching him horizontally at the neck a centimeter above the chain.\n\nThe head flew clear in a spray of blood, and the suddenly freed body lunged at me, almost falling on top of me. As I leaped aside, it brushed my leg.\n\n\"All right!\" I shouted, trying not to show the pity that was welling up in me. \"I want that carcass skinned and the hide tanned. And I want the meat served up for tomorrow's supper.\"\n\nAs I turned to leave, sheathing my sword, Stefan shouted, \"You bloody bastard! You filthy scum. You by-blow of an incestuous\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Count Lambert shouted, running up to us. \"You two are supposed to be knights, not kitchen dogs fighting over garbage! We will speak of this in private! Come with me, both of you.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" I said, following him to the castle, trying to control my emotions.\n\n\"It's not over, Conrad!\" Stefan shouted, but I didn't turn.\n\nSomething heavy hit me square in the back, knocking me flat on my stomach in the dirty snow. I looked up to see the bear's head bouncing down the path toward the castle. Rage enveloped me as I got up.\n\nAs I turned toward him, Stefan hit me square in the face, almost knocking me down again.\n\nI was too angry to fight efficiently, but Stefan didn't know anything about unarmed combat in the first place. For a few seconds we swung at each other wildly, and I gave a lot more than I got.\n\nSuddenly, a naked sword divided the space between us. Lambert's.\n\n\"I swear, the next one of you who strikes will get this in his guts,\" Lambert hissed. \"My own sworn knights fighting in the dirt, in front of the peasants no less! Now, to my chambers, and this time both of you walk in front of me.\"\n\nIn his chambers, Lambert ordered us to sit on opposite sides of the room but was so angry that he couldn't sit down himself.\n\n\"Dog's blood! My own knights! Men who are supposed to enforce the peace, fighting each other like squalid beggars! You shame me, the both of you!\n\n\"First you, Sir Conrad! I saw you deliberately destroy the property and sport of a brother knight. I fine you two hundred pence for that and order you to pay Sir Stefan another fifty in damages.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Is that all you have to say? Just why did you do such a despicable thing?\"\n\n\"My lord, he was going to torture that animal, chain it to that post, and turn the dogs on it.\"\n\n\"So? Bears kill our people and our cattle. We have the right to vengeance! You don't like our sports? I know you don't like our holidays. Very well! You can sleep through them, doing night guard duty before every one of them from now till Easter.\"\n\nI groaned. Lately one day in three had been a holiday of one sort or another. Stefan smiled.\n\n\"Wipe that damn smirk off your face, Sir Stefan,\" Lambert said. \"Your sins are worse than his! On slight provocation, you struck a brother knight with a dishonorable weapona bloody bear's headwithout proper challenge and in the back! You did it when I had specifically ordered you to follow me immediately! Some lords would have you hung for that, and were it not for your father I'd be sorely tempted. Instead, I'll be lenient. I fine you three months' additional guard duty, from Easter to midsummer, on the night shift.\n\n\"Now I want no more bad blood between you two. Knights of the same lord should be like brothers! Stand up and give each other the kiss of brotherhood, then get out of my sight!\"\n\nAs I kissed the smelly bastard, he whispered, \"It's not over!\"\n\n* * *\n\nStanding guard duty for fourteen hours in the dark gives you a lot of time to think. My engineering work was seriously hampered for lack of a decent system of weights and measures. In the cities, the guilds used a hodgepodge of gills and pennyweights and yards, mostly unrelated except that a pint of milk was supposed to weigh a pound. Nobody cared if the specific gravity of milk varied by five percent, with richer milk being lighter.\n\nHere in the country, things were even worse. The blacksmith and the baker did things until they felt about right. The saddler just cut and trimmed until it fit. The carpenter did a bit of measuringin cubits and spans and finger widthsbut he used his cubit, from his elbow to his fingertips.\n\nWe didn't even have a meter stick.\n\nOf course, I could invent my own system of weights and measures easily enough, and it would at least have the advantage of consistency.\n\nBut I would lose a lot doing it. Every person, and certainly every engineer, knows hundreds of numbers. I knew the speed of light and the diameter of the earth and the distance from the earth to the sun. I knew the tensile strength of wrought iron and what could be expected of concrete and, well, all sorts of things.\n\nBut I knew all these values in terms of the metric system. Without a meter stick, I was stuck with guesswork. With one, I could derive all of the weights and measures and from there translate the data I remembered into any other system at all.\n\nBut none of my equipment contained a single reliable measurement. I had nothing that I knew was a definite length or weight.\n\nAt gray dawn, the answer hit me. I had my own body! My weight might not be reliableI had put on muscle and lost some fat since arrivingbut surely my height hadn't changed. I was precisely 190 centimeters tall. I had only to measure myself in stocking feet, divide by nineteen, multiply by ten, and I had my meter stick. With that, a cube of cold water ten centimeters to the side has a volume of a liter and a mass of a kilogram.\n\nFrom there it was simple arithmetic to translate it into the base-twelve system that these people could use.\n\nDead tired, I got Krystyana out of bed and had her standing on a chest, marking my height on the wall with a piece of charcoal.\n\n\"Sir Conrad,\" Lambert said as he saw us. \"Just what are you doing now?\"\n\nI tried to explain how I was developing a standard meter and about engineering constants. Some things I had to repeat three times, perhaps because I hadn't slept in twenty-four hours and Lambert was just out of bed and bleary-eyed.\n\n\"So by measuring yourself, you will somehow know the distance from earth to moon? My dear Sir Conrad, God may have spanned the universe to his own measure, but it is rank blasphemy and profound hubris for a mere mortal to do so. In all events, the standard of measure here is the Silesian yard, not this foreign meter thing. I won't have you changing it.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\" After yesterday the last thing I wanted was to irritate Lambert. \"Uh, how long is a Silesian yard?\"\n\n\"I'll show you.\" Taking Krystyana's charcoal, he marked it on the wall. With his head turned left, it was the distance from his nose to his right fingertip.\n\n\"Thank you, my lord,\" I said, and he left.\n\nForever after, I used yards instead of meters rather than offend my liege lord. I soon knew the ratio of yards to meters and that was enough to save my data.\n\n* * *\n\nMy fourth endeavor was engineering the mills.\n\nUnderstand that I had no reference books, no instruments, and no measuring devices. I had no drawing equipment and darned little parchment. These last two wouldn't have done me much good anyway, because I didn't have anyone who could read a blueprint.\n\nFor the comparatively small items I'd had to build thus far, it was possible to give instructions like \"We need a piece of wood that's this long, and it's got to have holes in it so it can fit into this thing and that thing.\"\n\nThis technique was not suitable for building a mill, and we needed two of them; I built one-twelfth scale working models, because the people had to see how things moved in order to understand them.\n\nOkoitz didn't have a stream suitable for damming, so that left wind power. The problem with wind power is that it works only when the wind is blowing. This is not a great complication on something like a flour mill, because only one operator is required and he can work strange hours if the situation requires it. But a lot of processesbeating flax and sawing woodare both energy- and labor-intensive. If a crew is working and the wind stops, twenty people are left standing around, which is blatantly inefficient. An intermediate energy shortage device is needed, and we had water.\n\nThe first windmill was a water pump and some storage tanks. Actually, it was two sets of water pumps. One set of four pumps pumped water from a new well to a tank near the top of the mill. We needed a new well anyway because the old well was entirely too close to the latrines. The top tank provided fresh water to the community and supplied the lower, working tanks. I used four small pumps because I did not know how much power the mill would produce. If we only had enough torque to operate two pumps, the other two could be disconnected and used as spares. Also, if one pump malfunctioned, it could be repaired while the others continued in operation.\n\nThis is called contingency planning, or in the colorful language of my American friends, \"keeping your ass covered.\"\n\nFour larger pumps operated between the lowest tank and the middle tank. These provided water power to several machines in a circular shed that ringed the base of the windmill.\n\nThe sawmill, for example, had a straight saw blade operating vertically between two ropes. These ropes were connected by a pulley system to two short, fat barrels mounted at the ends of long pivot arms. A barrel, reaching the top of its stroke, pushed open a weighted door that allowed water from the middle tank to fill it. Filled, it descended, pulling the saw blade and raising the other barrel. Reaching the bottom, a fixed peg pushed up another weighted door on the bottom of the barrel, which drained the water into the lowest tank. At the same time, the second barrel was filling and the process reversed itself.\n\nThis \"wet mill\" was a fairly big thing. The body of it was a truncated cone twenty-four yards across at the bottom and twelve at the turret. The walls were vertical logs flattened on two sides. The cone shape resulted from the natural taper of the logs. I was learning.\n\nThe foundations went a full story into the ground, and from the ground to the top of the highest blade the thing was as tall as a nine-story building.\n\nA windmill must be kept facing the wind, so the turret has to rotate. Ours did this on ninety-six wooden ball bearings, each as big as a man's head. One of my college professors had shown us a device to accomplish this automatically. A second, much smaller windmill was built on the back of the large turret, with the blades at right angles to the main blades. This was geared down to rotate the turret if the small windmill wasn't parallel to the wind. He claimed it was the world's first negative feedback device.\n\nI could have made the turret manually rotatable, but I wanted the mill to operate unattended at night.\n\nOne of the engineering problems I faced was that the weight of the water tanks, besides pushing downward, also pushed outward. Some crude calculations indicated that a wrought-iron band strong enough to hold the middle tank together would have weighed eight tons. I wasn't sure that there was that much iron available on the market, and in any event the cost would have been fabulous.\n\nMy solution was exactly the same as that used by my contemporaries, the Gothic cathedral builders. These cathedrals have purely decorative internal stone arches that produce an outward thrust. I say purely decorative because the cathedrals were topped by wooden truss roofs that kept the rain out and didn't touch the arches. They actually built the outer walls and wooden roof first and then built those magnificent arches later, working indoors out of the rain.\n\nI used the circular work shed as a flying buttress, leaning into the tower and squeezing it together.\n\nBetween the high-water level of the lowest tank and the bottom of the middle tank was a space of four yards. This was at ground level, but the area would be dark and wet, and I could think of no good use for it. I didn't bother putting a floor there.\n\nThis resulted in the lowest tank being used, over my protestations, as a swimming pool.\n\nBy the time I got the model of the wet mill done, the weather had broken. The bitter cold of winter was over, the snow had melted, and the first warm breezes kissed the land.\n\nA mood of wondrous relief and joviality filled the community. It was so glorious that I had to rip my shirt off and stand in the warm sunshine, soaking up the vitamin D. I wasn't alone in doing this; Krystyana and Natalia were suddenly standing naked next to me.\n\nThis mood lasted for about a day, and then it was time for spring plowing and planting, an all-out effort for those people, who got up before dawn and performed fifteen or sixteen hours of grueling labor before collapsing exhausted, only to repeat the process the next day.\n\nThe count kept equal hours supervising, and the carpenter and the smith were kept busy repairing tools. There were only three or four weeks to complete the task, and if the planting didn't get done, next winter we would starve.\n\nI seemed to be the only one at loose endsas a knight, I was not allowed to workso I wandered about observing things, seeing what improvements could be made. What they needed most was a good steel plow, and I saw no way of providing one.\n\nLambert owned more than half the land surrounding Okoitz. Well, actually, he owned two hundred times as much besides, but much of it was farmed out to his knights, most of whom ran manors similar to, but smaller than, his.\n\nPeasants were expected to work three days a week on his land and had the balance of their time \"free\" to work their own. Special workersthe bakers, carpenters, etc.had their own separate and often quite complicated arrangements, but in general it amounted to a fifty percent taxation, with the count being the entire government.\n\nIn return, the people got what amounted to police and military protection, much of their clothing, and a fixed number of feasts per year. In addition to the Christmas season, there were twenty-two days of feasting. I estimated that twenty-five percent of the food consumed by the commons was eaten at these feasts.\n\nAlso, and very important, the count made arrangements for the sick and needy. Since Lambert was an intelligent and decent person, it really wasn't a bad system. Under a stupid or greedy lord, you could see where it could be pure hell."
