        "text": "M. Trzeciecki 2016. \"The emergence of the territorial state\", in P. Urbańczyk, M. Trzeciecki (eds), \"The Past Societies. Polish lands from the first evidence of human presence to the early middle ages\", vol. 5: 500 AD – 1000 AD, 257-306. Warsaw, The Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology, Polish Academy of Sciences The present work offers an overview of the key issues in the study of the emergence of state structures in Polish territory between the beginning of the 10th century and the middle of the 11th century. The introduction outlines the history of research and describes its current state. Particular emphasis is placed on issues related to the so-called millennium research program and its impact on contemporary trends and areas of study. The development of the territorial state is demonstrated using the example of the changes in the structure, form and function of defensive sites. The article also presents a brief description of early-Piast central strongholds and an outline of the process of the emergence of a network of central sites in the territories controlled by the Piast monarchy. The development of early state structures is closely linked with the adoption of Christianity. The present work discusses issues related to the archeologically discernible evidence of Christianisation, namely sacral buildings, changes in burial customs and items associated with liturgy or individual worship. The conclusion points to the small (both territorially and socially) scale of religious conversion and the close links between the early Church and the structures of the state.\n\nFor the last 120 years, a debate has been unfolding over the relations in the triangle between Great Moravia, Bohemia and Poland in the early Middle Ages. For years, the dispute has been revolving around a few most crucial and at the same time controversial problems. The first problem concerns the role of Duchess Doubravka of Bohemia in the Christianization of Greater Poland. The second one, which is widely reflected in the professional literature, is the incorporation of the Land of Kraków into Great Moravia or strong ties of \"the Land of the Vistulans\" with that early state organism. There are some other controversies widely discussed by historians and archaeologists. One of them is the incorporation of the Land of Kraków into Bohemia in the middle of the 10th century. In this case the annexation, which is now accepted by most of the scholars, is not a subject of controversy, but the role of the possible Bohemian influence on the alleged Christianization of Lesser Poland, which resulted in the construction of sacral stone buildings. The verification of the old theories has shed light on several issues, changing the perspective of future considerations, or rather introducing alternative possibilities of interpretation. Studies on those problems must carried out in future as interdisciplinary research of archeologists, art historians and historians."
