        "text": "Interesting characters from your country?\n\nHi, guys. This is a topic for people with plenty of time on their hands, so don't force yourself to read the whole thing if your time is scarce.\n\nWith half the world going into quarantine these days, I thought it could be a good idea to come up with some interesting characters to play.\n\nMany of us are history buffs, so we're all qualified to name characters from various parts of the world, but there's something unique in the way people look at rulers from their own countries and cultures. So this is by no means exclusive, but I would like us to focus on playable characters from our home countries that may be less known outside the country.\n\nSo in my case this is mostly Poland.\n\nBe warned: as you can see this is a long post with a lot of potential to become boring if you aren't already interested in the subject. There is no TL;DR version except simply following the wikipedia links to get the reign/death dates for rulers to check out without reading my descriptions. It would be great if the posters after me could also provide Wiki links and good start dates for their recommended characters.\n\n1. Casimir the Great is playable in the 1337 start, but I would like to mention that the starting date of his reign was 2 March 1333, so you can play four years longer at the expense of having a less balanced setup than the game's own bookmark.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_III_the_Great\n\n2. Władysław Łokietek, his father, is playable much earlier on, but the truly interesting date for him is 8 February 1296, which is when in-game Poland — as a matter of gross simplification — is represented as being held by the King of Bohemia from the Premyslid dynasty, while all dukes and almost all 'counts' in Poland are still Piasts. The historical turmoil of the period (associated with the assassination of the native Polish king, Przemysław II, at the behest of probably Brandenburg and internal opposing factions) is not represented, nor is Władysław even an independent character with a claim on the Kingdom.\n\nHowever, being Vaclav of Bohemia's vassal enables Władysław to plot for a claim on the kingdom and eventually oust Bohemia's kings from Poland in a country-wide coup instead of having to grab province by province from a stronger enemy.\n\nThere are also Teutonic Knights menacing from the north, as well as Mongols threatening Władysław's Ruthenian relatives, and there's some potential (historically realized in Casimir's marriage) for dynastic marriage with Lithuania, many of whose dynasts are already Christian unlike the main ruler (and, of course, one of those Christian relatives may well succeed to Lithuania as a whole).\n\nHistorically, Władysław relied heavily on his Hungarian alliances and navigating between German imperial claimants while staying close to the papacy.\n\nIn Poland, Władysław is remembered as a reuniter of the country after almost 200 years of gavelkind fragmentation following a failed experiment with seniority succession.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_I_%C5%81okietek\n\nNOTE: Near the end of Władysław's life, with 1 January 1329, Poland loses three Silesian counties in CK2.\n\n3. Boleslaus the Wrymouth — ruling the country (king tier) since 4 June 1102 but playable a bit earlier on as a duke under his father, who was the younger brother of Poland's 1066 king — is the guy who introduced the seniority experiment. In-game, Poland's fragmentation and loss of the royal dignity is not represented, the high dukes simply represented as kings and the junior dynasts as proper vassals. Hence there is no experience of the fragmentation period in CK2, but you could use Boleslaus as a starting point for your own experiment with either gavelkind or seniority for, let's say, 200 years, in CK2.\n\nUnder his plan the various stem duchies were supposed to go gavelkind, with Lesser Poland descending in seniority along with supremacy over the whole country.\n\nInitially, Boleslaus contents against his older 'bastard' brother, who in reality may simply have had a non-royal mother in a legitimate marriage.\n\nBoleslaus has to watch the situation in all of Pomerania, Prussia, Lithuania, Ruthenia, Hungary, Bohemia and Germany to stay alive and avoid losing territory county by county to stronger opponents using Jade Dragon CBs and fabricating claims. You will also need to watch who you marry your daughters to, to avoid e.g. the HRE pressing vassal claims on your kingdom.\n\nInteresting dates to start playing him include:\n\n11 Jan 1131. He holds all of de iure k_Poland plus four Pomeranian counties. On this day Obotritia appears as an independent pagan high chiefdom again, rather than part of the HRE (which it was on the dates before), while Dymin+Rana is an independent double county. Forming k_Pomerania is feasible. Forming k_Lithuania looks easy on the map but is difficult to achieve in practice due to the high numbers and high quality of pagan tribal troops, the rulers' high propensity to join holy wars as defenders (much, much solidarity there) plus defensive attrition. But if you manage to do that, you can create a custom empire or even form the Wendish Empire, which is about the last time period when it makes sense. But you have to act quickly because the HRE is both powerful and greedy. You know what? Historical Boleslaus got in trouble with the HRE precisely for messing with Pomerania.\n\nStrategic options include 'the unthinkable', i.e. swearing fealty to HRE, which was a realistic possibility at the time and even at times appeared to have been the case. Being part of the HRE enables control over Bohemia. You could try to inherit Bohemia and then quit the HRE, to form the Slavic Union eventually. Or you could try to form the Slavic Union as the HRE. The funny thing is, this isn't really ahistorical, though it's a long story. It's plausible alternative history. Due to its positioning Poland was targeted by the HRE for making it a tributary state or vassal, while as a vassal the ruler of Poland would easily have been in the top 3 or 5 if not the top 1. If not running in and winning the imperial elections, the Polish ruler would have had much say in them (and historically did intervene to support those of the HRE's princes who were his relatives). Poland didn't take the path of becoming an HRE member state, but it remained a realistic possibility for almost two centuries.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boles%C5%82aw_III_Wrymouth\n\n4. Przemysł II — the king assassinated on 8 Feb 1296. Before his death, he is inaccurately represented as having all of Poland as his vassals, while in reality he had zero practical control over Silesia, not even nominal control of Lesser Poland, and Mazovia and Kuyavia functioned more as allies than vassals, as did . But in game he's a strong king with the whole of his country as his vassals.\n\nWhat is interesting from the in-game perspective is that he holds almost all of the country's de iure counties (with only c_Lebus missing) plus access to the sea through 4 Pomeranian provinces. Also, all dukes and almost all counts are from his dynasty. The duke of Sandomierz is none other than Władysław the Elbow High. The count of Lower Silesia, Henryk, is Łokietek's future native Polish competitor for uniting the country — a guy reputed for being Just, Honest and Cruel and possibly Shrewd, in terms of CK2 traits, while Władysław was more along the lines of Deceitful, Unyielding, erratic and not up to the huge challenge initially.\n\nPrzemysł's daughter is the one who was historically married to Vaclav of Bohemia to give a semblance of legitimacy to his claims to rule Poland.\n\nPrzemysł was the last king of Poland who pursued a Western orientation, while Władysław the Elbow-High, Casimir the Great and their successors looked to the East. (In-game, Władysław's demesne on 8 Feb 1296 will also be Greater Poland + Pomeralia, meaning a more Western/Baltic orientation).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przemys%C5%82_II\n\n5. Leszek the White — he is playable as early as 1194 and as late as 24 Nov 1227, which is the date of his assassination.\n\nHowever, an interesting date to play him is 31 Dec 1224. The reason is that this is the last day in CK2 during his reign when Poland holds c_Lebus (and the rest of its full de iure) and the Teutonic State in its eventual form does not yet exist (only the earlier Livonian Order up north). Pruthenian and Lithuanian pagans are no doubt hostile but are not exceedingly strong. Poland still holds two counties on the Baltic coast (Gdańsk & Bytów). Pomeranian rulers are either independent or vassalized to Denmark rather than to the HRE. Denmark is no pushover but no superpower either. On the south Hungary is strong, and on the East Ruthenian states are still independent, though facing a huge Cumania. Confrontation with the Mongols is likely to follow several decades later or even sooner. Gotland is an independent republic. Angermaland in Sweden is ruled by the last independent Germanic count. The period is also interesting in having strong Muslim powers in the Mediterranean — the Almohads in Maghreb + Andalusia (ready to make a comeback against the Christian rulers holding the majority of the Spanish provinces) and the Ayyubids (Saladdin descendants) in Egypt + Syria, not to mention a strong Rum, while Byzantium is shattered.\n\nA similar setup exists as early as 1 January 1212, if you prefer to start 12 years earlier.\n\nThe difference is that in 1224 the HRE holds Sicily, while in 1212 Sicily is independent, the Almohads are much stronger, the Ayyubids are also stronger, Latin Empire is not yet a pushover, the Mongols have not yet arrived, and there are more pagans up north in Sweden.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leszek_the_White\n\nNOTE: 1 Jan 1136 to 31 Dec 1154 is the largest extent of independent Catholic Pomerania in the game. On 1 Jan 1136 the reigning duke is Ratibor, who has the land for 2 duchies (making him a 'grand duke' with +1 demesne bonus) and a powerful demesne and is neighboured by two small Pomeranian pagan states (a double county and a duchy of 2 counties). This is what separates him from k_Pomerania. Of course, if he manages to get 3 ducal titles, then he can create a custom kingdom. Hence the guy is as close as you can get to creating a Catholic Pomerania as a kingdom.\n\n6. Zbigniew, the (non-)bastard. On 4 June 1102 the game represents Boleslaus Wrymouth as king, aged 15, with Zbigniew, aged 29, as his powerful vassal duke and illegitimate elder brother. The historical reality is that in June 1102 Boleslaus was far from king, Zbigniew was his overlord (before the situation was inverted several years later), and Zbigniew's mother was possibly a legitimate wife (possibly something close to a handfast marriage but definitely not your usual adultery with a kitchen maid). If you would play Boleslaus as the beginning of his in-game reign, you might as well play Zbigniew. Note that Poland doesn't control Pomerania yet, and that Pomerania is held by pagans, as is Lithuania. And of course as Zbigniew you want to remove Boleslaus and claim the crown. This means you likely won't be able to do as much as Boleslaus if you start as Zbigniew with the objective of seizing the crown. But you can avenge the displaced elder brother from a less royal mother.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_of_Poland\n\n***\n\nThere are plenty of interesting rulers variously represented as king of the whole thing or vassal duke, depending on the year, throughout the 1138 to 1296 period. They shift very often, so you can pick them at the various heights of their power, using various dates from their lives as a guide. Here are some suggestions:\n\nHenry the Righteous — Germanized Bohemian lover who still came close to uniting the country before Przemysł, with whom he competed for the crown: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henryk_IV_Probus\n\nHenry of Lower Silesia (Głogów) — Henry the Righteous's former vassal, Władysław the Elbow-High's future competitor; unlike Władysław, he never bent knee to Bohemia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_III,_Duke_of_G%C5%82og%C3%B3w\n\nBolesław the Horned — started as the high duke as a child in 1241 (and would have been the king under strict primogeniture, being the dynasty's seniormost descendant), directly ruling most of the country and gradually losing province by province and becoming more and more forgotten and reduced to intriguing against his neighbours — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boles%C5%82aw_II_the_Horned\n\nHenry II the Pious — the Horned's father, who came close to uniting the country but died on 9 April 1241 in battle against the Mongols, and his realm collapsed — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_the_Pious (canonization process started in the Catholic Church)\n\nWładysław the Exile — Wrymouth's older son and allegedly cruel, arbitrary and authoritarian, some unstable ruler nonetheless described largely from the perspective of his ambitious, greedy younger brothers and their mother — initially (28 Oct 1138) the last of Poland's original all-country rulers — you could play him to see if you manage to stay in power and avoid the fragmentation of the country (which is what all his predecessors, including his father, the Wrymouth, had to do); you could also play his descendants in their hereditary provinces to see if you can manage to grab the crown and the rule the whole country — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_II_the_Exile\n\nBolesław the Chaste — various dates from 1 Jan 1243 to 6 Dec 1279, so you can see how much the situation in Europe changes throughout his 'reign' (historically, he only held the capital province without primacy in the rest the country) — as an adult he should be a celibate married to a celibate wife, daughter of the king of Hungary — an important alliance, concerning the Mongol threat and the state of Ruthenian affairs; he's the dynasty's another unsuccessful male candidate for sainthood (none ever succeeded); Władysław the Elbow High's elder brother (playable from 7 Dec 1279 for a couple of years onward) was his appointed adoptive heir — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boles%C5%82aw_V_the_Chaste\n\nHenry of Sandomierz — from 28 Oct 1138 onward to 18 October 1166 — you can start at age 7 — Poland's sole high-profile crusader, who went to the Holy Land and later died in a holy war against Prussia without ever having married or left children. He left his lands to his younger brother, Kazimierz the Just, who was too young initially to get his own duchy (nor were there any spare duchies to give him). I suppose one could play him to participate in a crusade and perhaps play on as the beneficiary, while leaving Poland behind (the best Polish character to do so), or perhaps you could go back to Poland (as he did) and wait until he had a holy war CB against a neighbour (e.g. enlist a holy order — in his case Hospitallers rather than Templars — to fight Lithuania for Ruthenian lands). Of course, like the historical guy, you could never marry and thus continue on as his younger brother, meaning you would play both of the historical Dukes of Sandomierz in succession — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Sandomierz"
