The slogan is also used by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Regiment).\" ~ Alastair Lorne Campbell of Airds, Unicorn Pursuivant, A History of Clan Campbell, Volume 2, From Flodden to the Restoration (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), page 290.\n\n(Pronunciation: CROO a han/CROO a h ' n)\n\nClan March\n\n\"The Campbells Are Coming!\" Also known under a variety of names including, in the Gaelic \"Baile Inneraora\", \" The Town of Inveraray\". Read More.\n\nClan Tartan\n\nThere are four patterns of tartan authorized by Mac Calein Mór. Campbells of Breadalbane, or Campbells of Cawdor, or Campbells of Loudoun, may wear their respective tartans, but all Campbells may wear the blue, green and black Campbell sett. Often sold as \"Ancient Campbell\" or \"Campbell Ancient\" or simply \"Clan Campbell\". Offically known in tartan registeries as \"Tartan #1\".\n\nThe sett known as \"Campbell of Argyll\" is NOT authorized by the Chief of Clan Campbell and members of Clan Campbell are strongly urged not to buy or wear \"Campbell of Argyll\" setts.\n\nClan Crest / Clanmans' Badge\n\nThe Chiefs full heraldic achievement includes, as Crest on his helmet, \"a boars head, erased\" or torn from its shoulders. This boar's head, on the wreath of twisted threads that bound the 'Mantling' or cloth protection to the back fo the helmet against the sun, may be worn by Clansmen and Followers of Mac Cailein Mór within a buckled strap on which is displayed the chief's motto \"Ne Obliviscaris\".\n\nOrigin of the Campbell Name\n\nIt was Sir Cailean Mòr Campbell's grandfather Dugald on Lochawe who is said to have been the first given the nickname \"Cam Beul\" since he apparently had the engaging trait of talking out of one side of his mouth. Cam beul means \"Curved Mouth\" (or Wry-Mouth) in the Gaelic. This Dugald was so much loved by his family that they took his nickname as their family name and held to it even beyond Argyll.\n\nThe spelling of the surname (family name) was originally Cambel. Then when Robert the Bruce's son King David came to the throne as King of Scots he brought with him a number of Norman knights to whom he gave lands in an attempt to introduce Norman efficiency in administration. David had been at the English court and admired the Norman system of feudalism. The use of the spelling \"Campbell\" may perhaps have been as a result of Norman rather than Gaelic scribes attempting to write the Gaelic name.\n\nThe name Cambel was first used by the family in the 13th century. The first chief of the clan to appear on record as \"Campbell\" may well have been Sir Duncan of Lochawe when he was created Lord Campbell in 1445.\n\nIn November 2006, C. Randell Seale of the Clan Campbell Society (NA) proposed a new theory that the \"Campbell\" name had a medical origin. In part, he noted that Einar Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney (died 1020), was called Einar Wry-Mouth as was Bolesław III Wrymouth, Duke of Lesser Poland, Silesia and Sandomierz between 1102 and 1107 and over the whole Poland between 1107 and 1138. Surviving artwork of Einar of Orkney and Boleslaw of Poland indicate a similar facial curvature even though the two men are not directly related. The modern medical explanation for this facial curvature is a form of Torticollis (from the Latin torti, meaning twisted, and collis, meaning neck), or \"wry neck\". A condition in which the head is tilted toward one side (cervical rotation), and the chin (mouth) is elevated and turned toward the opposite side (cervical extension) thereby producing a \"Cam beul\" or curved mouth in some cases. \"This explanation of naming Dugald as 'Wry Mouth' or 'Cam Beul' after his physical characteristic of a 'crooked mouth' is absolutely consistent with the Scottish Gaelic naming tradition of the time period; such as the Clan Cameron progenitor being named 'Cameron' for his 'crooked nose', or someone being named 'The Red' or 'The Fair' after their hair color or good looks.\" Seale explained.\n\nHighland Customs"
