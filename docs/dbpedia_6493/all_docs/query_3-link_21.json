        "text": "Presidentsâ Day is almost here which means there will be some amazing sales on furniture and home appliances. But it also means we get to celebrate the birth of Americaâs greatest president, George Washington. A few months ago, I said that had Bernie Sanders been elected, he would have been the first Polish American president. Well I was wrong; we have already had a Polish American president, George Washington. And not only was he the Father of Our Country, but he was a True Son of Poland, being a lineal descendant of Mieszko I of Poland.\n\nSkipping the legendary and semi-legendary Piast rulers, we will start with Mieszko I of Poland (ca.930-992) who we know was an actual person. Mieszkoâs son King Boleslaw I the Brave (967-1025) would have a son, Mieszko II Lambert (967-1025) who was the father of Casimir I the Restorer (1016-1058) whose son Wladyslaw I Herman (1044-1102) would have a son Boleslaw III Wrymouth (1086-1138). Boleslaw III would father Wladyslaw II the Exile (1105-1159) whose daughter Richeza of Poland Queen of Castile (1140-1185) would be the mother of Sancha of Castile Queen of Aragon (1154-1208) who then mothered Alfonso II Count of Provence (1174-1209) who then fathered Ramon Berenguer IV Count of Provence (1198-1245).\n\nRamon was the father of a number of daughters including Eleanor of Provence Queen consort of England (1223-1291) and spouse of King Henry III of England. Her son King Edward I âLongshanksâ of England (1239-1307) would have a son Edmund of Woodstock the 1st Earl of Kent (1301-1330) whose daughter Joan the Fair Maid of Kent (1328-1385) secretly married Thomas Holland 1st Earl of Kent and mothered Thomas Holland 2nd Earl of Kent (1350-1397).\n\nThomasâ daughter Alianore Holland Countess of March Baroness Cherleton (1370-1405) had a daughter Joyce (1403-1446) who married John Tiptoft 1st Baron Tiptoft and also had a daughter named Joyce (1430-1483). Joyce Tiptoft married and became Ms. Edmund Sutton mother of John Sutton (1453-1483) whose daughter Margaret (1485-1563) married John Butler Sr of Aston. Margaretâs son William Butler Sir of Tyes Hall (1540-1587) had one daughter Margaret (1570-1652) who fell in love with the Esquire of Sulgrave Manor and Mayor of Northampton Lawrence Washington.\n\nThe couple had 18 children one of which Lawrence Washington, Jr (1602-1653) became a minister and Rector of Little Braxted. Reverend Washington only had 10 children including Colonel John Washington (1632-1677) who while working on a ship found the Colony of Virginia to be a pleasant place and decided to stay.\n\nIn this new world, John caught the eye of Anne Pope and a year after they were married had their first son Lawrence Washington (1659â1698). Like his father Lawrence was active in politics as well as law. He would serve as a militia Captain, Sheriff of Westmoreland County, and was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1685.\n\nLawrence married Mildred Warner and had three children, with the middle child being Augustine Washington (1694-1743). As a member of the landed gentry Augustine was active in his church, served justice of the peace and like his father, became a sheriff. At age 37, Augustine welcomed his first child with his second wife Mary Ball into the world. They decided to name him George (1731-1799).\n\nTo write that out, Mieszko I of Poland was George Washingtonâs great-great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great- great grandfather. So the next time you see a quarter, a dollar bill, or a little Marx toy just remember he was the first Polish American president."
