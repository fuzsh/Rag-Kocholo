How Famous People Are Determined

So...people love to email and say, "you think this person is the most famous!??!?!" Well, let us explain...our current method of determing the most famous people is an inexact science. We rank people using the person's Wikipedia page views and links. So if the person is linked to in lots of other pages and the page is viewed often they have a higher rank. Because of this, we miss some people, and the later the year, the less effective the rankings will be. We will work on improving this ranking system in future versions.
