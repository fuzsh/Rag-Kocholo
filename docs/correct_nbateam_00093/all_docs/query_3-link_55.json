        "text": "Mike Miller chuckles when asked about traveling with his son, Mason, to the prestigious Pangos All-American Basketball Camp in Los Angeles last week.\n\nMason, a fast-rising 16-year-old recruit who is already taller than his famous father, had a simple request for the recently retired NBA veteran as they approached the facility.\n\n“He told me to walk in 10 minutes after him,” says Miller, 39, the former Mitchell High standout who won a pair of NBA titles with the Miami Heat. “He didn’t want the other players to know I’m his dad. He wants to be his own man.”\n\nAs laudable as that sentiment is, it might be tough to pull off. While there clearly are differences between father and son – Mason is a lefty growing up in big-city Memphis who doesn’t play in a palace of corn – it’s also not hard to spot similarities.\n\nBoth sprouted in their early high school years and waited for their body to catch up, leading to Mike being nicknamed “Skinny” by Mitchell coaching legend Gary Munsen. Both can shoot the lights out while also finding teammates with timely passes.\n\nAnd both blew up as Division I prospects between their sophomore and junior years, with 6-foot-8 Mike becoming the most coveted recruit in South Dakota history on his way to joining Billy Donovan’s up-and-coming Florida program in 1998.\n\n“It’s a long journey, but it goes fast,” says Miller, an assistant coach at the University of Memphis, one of the many schools interested in his son’s services. “I told him to just enjoy it and stay focused. A lot of kids get caught up in rankings and what schools offered them, but it’s not about that. It’s about getting better every day and seeing the big picture.”\n\nMason, a 6-9 forward who plays AAU ball for Hoop City out of Memphis, will appear at next week’s NBPA Top 100 Camp at the University of Virginia and has offers from Creighton, Memphis and TCU (where his uncle, Ryan Miller, is associate head coach). He is currently ranked 73rd nationally among 2021 recruits by 247Sports.\n\nSouth Dakota hoop fans will get a look at him this December when his Germantown Houston high school team plays at the Hoop City Classic, with games against Yankton (featuring major D-I prospect Matthew Mors) at the Sanford Pentagon and Mitchell at the Corn Palace.\n\nThat latter matchup will stir fond memories for his father, who ushered South Dakota into the summer AAU basketball era more than 20 years ago as a cold-blooded Kernel bound for greatness.\n\n“You have to feel for the guys who recruited me,” laughed Miller during a phone interview this week, recalling his days as the state’s first and only McDonald’s All-American. “It must have been difficult to get into Mitchell those days without any GPS and fewer flights. But I appreciate that time and those memories. It was part of my life and always will be.”\n\nRecruit on the rise\n\nOn a November morning in 1997, Miller and several of his buddies strolled into a press conference at the Mitchell High library wearing caps adorned with the Florida logo.\n\nFor Billy Donovan and the Gators, it was a splendid sight.\n\nBy beating out Kansas’ Roy Williams and Kentucky’s Tubby Smith in the recruiting battle for South Dakota's basketball phenom, Donovan completed a top-tier class and laid the groundwork for a young program seeking to build a tradition.\n\nSkeptics wondered why Miller, one of America's top 15 prospects, would pass up traditional blue-blood powerhouses to play for a football-dominated school starting from scratch with a young coach.\n\nBut it made sense to Miller, whose recruiting rise started the previous summer with stellar performances with the Dakota Schoolers and at national camps. He saw an opportunity to help build a new powerhouse, which is exactly what happened.\n\nThe prized recruit led Florida to the NCAA championship game as a sophomore in 2000, after which he turned pro and was named NBA Rookie of the Year with the Orlando Magic.\n\n\"Sometimes it has to be a leap of faith,\" says Miller, whose 17-year NBA career included stops with seven different teams, finishing up with Denver Nuggets in 2016-17. \"I wanted to do something different, and (Donovan) offered that. He sold me on his vision.\"\n\nIt capped a chaotic recruitment battle unprecedented in these parts, with big-name coaches descending on Mitchell to pursue a three-time all-state pick who helped the Kernels claim state titles in 1996 and '97. Miller and his teammates sported Nike apparel as perks of his blue-chip status.\n\n“That was a pretty crazy time,” says Ernie Kuyper, Miller’s cousin and former Mitchell teammate, who now runs the Hoop City program in Memphis. “Every coach in the country was coming to see him, flying into town in their private jets.”\n\nDonovan’s aggressive recruiting style set the tone, as illustrated by an episode in the frenzied summer of ‘97.\n\nMiller had just finished an MVP performance at the Adidas Big Time tournament in Las Vegas when Donovan learned the team was driving to Long Beach, Calif., for the next event. The coach canceled his flight and drove with his assistant instead, basically trailing the vehicle their prime recruit traveled in.\n\nMiller watched the young head coach through his rear-view mirror and was amazed at his persistence.\n\n\"He worked the hardest to get me,\" says Miller, but he pushes back at the notion that his recruitment signaled a rise in the quality of prospects in this state.\n\n“As much as it was exciting, there has always been great basketball in South Dakota,\" he insists. \"There have always been great players. It’s just easier to recruit there now because of social media and so much information available.\"\n\nStill, there’s no denying that Miller mania was real. Teddy Dupay, another Florida recruit who roomed with Miller as a freshman, recalled seeing Gators assistant John Pelphrey at a summer tournament and asking why he bothered to watch a South Dakota team play.\n\n\"He pointed to the court just as Mike took a rebound above the rim, made a move on a guy on his way up the court and pulled up to drain a three,\" said Dupay. \"At that point Mike had just grown to 6-foot-8. It was sort of like, 'Holy smokes.'\"\n\nThe courtship gained steam in September of 1997, when Miller attended Florida's football game against Tennessee. Just two hours before that SEC battle at \"The Swamp,\" Gators coach Steve Spurrier strode into athletic director Jeremy Foley's office to speak with Miller.\n\nSeated on a leather couch in front of a statue of two entangled alligators, Spurrier looked Mitchell's favorite son in the eye and asked him to become part of the Florida family.\n\nTwo months later, in the Mitchell High library, he did just that.\n\nFinding a new role\n\nMiller’s recruiting experience has served him well as an assistant coach at Memphis, where he joined Penny Hardaway’s staff in April of 2018.\n\nTogether with Hardaway, the former Memphis phenom and NBA standout, Miller has helped bring star power to living rooms while building a 2019 recruiting class ranked No. 1 nationally by most scouting sites, beating out Kentucky, Arizona and Duke.\n\n“It’s a learning situation that has helped me grow as a person,” says Miller of his coaching role. “The basketball doesn’t change, so a lot of it comes down to relationships. You work hard to get kids and families to trust that you’ll have a positive effect on their lives. The city of Memphis is excited with this class, as it should be, but the real work starts now.”\n\nOutside of coaching duties, Miller spends quality time at the gym with Mason and younger son Mavrick, who will be a high school freshman in the fall. He also has an 8-year-old daughter, Jaelyn, with wife Jennifer, a former volleyball standout he met while at Florida and married in 2004.\n\nJaelyn was born during the 2011 NBA Finals when Miller was playing for Miami, which lost to Dallas that year. She spent time in pediatric intensive care with a congenital heart defect before recovering, and Mike had to be talked into suiting up for the Heat during difficult days.\n\n“You sometimes take things for granted,” he said at the time. “Her being here is a blessing.”\n\nConnections from that Miami era still hold meaning for Miller, who last week tweeted a photo of Nike shoes sent by close friend and former teammate LeBron James, now with the Los Angles Lakers. James responded in kind to his 43 million followers.\n\n“Me and Bron have always had a special relationship, and that just shows the kind of guy he is,” says Miller. “He’s not just a teammate but a friend. And he’s a very good friend to have.”\n\nIt was James who persuaded the Mitchell native to sign with talent-laden Miami as a free agent in 2010, a radical departure from Miller's first 10 years in the league, when his teams failed to win a playoff series.\n\nThe ensuing three-year run of trips to the NBA Finals are among Miller’s most treasured memories from a playing career that included 1,032 games played and nearly 11,000 points.\n\n“I've been out of the game two years, and the only things I really miss are the relationships in the locker room and the playoffs, when you’re competing at that high level,” he says. “Try all you want, but you're never going to be able to replace that feeling.\"\n\nMiller manages to fill the void with family time, coaching duties and acting as a mentor during Mason’s recruiting rise. But with the NBA Finals in full swing, it’s impossible not to think back to his performance in the decisive Game 5 of the 2012 championship series, when the Corn Palace kid was on top of the basketball world.\n\nFighting through a rash of injuries, the veteran came off the bench that night to score 23 points behind seven 3-pointers in a 121-106 win over Kevin Durant and Oklahoma City, limping every step of the way to clinch his first NBA crown.\n\n“The reason I went to Miami was to challenge myself and be on that big stage,” he says. “To be fortunate enough to rise to the occasion in a game like that, I’ll always cherish that. That’s definitely a fond memory, with hopefully more on the way.”\n\nArgus Leader Media columnist Stu Whitney can be reached at swhitney@argusleader.com. Follow him on Twitter @stuwhitney"
