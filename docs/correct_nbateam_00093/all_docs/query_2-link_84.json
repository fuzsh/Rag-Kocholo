        "text": "Mike Miller ,LeBron James\n\nMike Miller (13) and LeBron James (6) laugh at an official's call during the second half of Game 6 of the NBA Finals basketball game against the San Antonio Spurs, Tuesday, June 18, 2013 in Miami. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\n(Wilfredo Lee)\n\nINDEPENDENCE, Ohio â€“ \"We're as close as teammates than any I've had in my career. I've always wanted to play alongside of him. When you go through tough times in an NBA season, you get to know each other even more beyond the game of basketball.\"\n\nThose were the words of Cavaliers superstar LeBron James after Monday's practice when we asked about his relationship with teammate Mike Miller.\n\nIf you ask around the league, Miller gets along with everyone. Regardless of their race, religion, or political belief, the sharpshooter has a personable knack for making one feel comfortable around him.\n\nBefore they teamed up, James said he had always admired Miller from afar. When the two came together in Miami four years ago, they clicked from the onset. Miller said at times they were inseparable.\n\nMiami putting together a super-team like no other rubbed folks the wrong way. It was a team structure most weren't willing to embrace. They went through it all, from the scrutiny, the sold-out hostile arenas and the 2011 NBA Finals debacle. It was a painful experience, but it would only draw them closer.\n\nThat growth materialized to back-to-back titles the following two seasons. They were the favorites going into the 2013-14 season, on a mission to be the first team to three-peat since the Los Angeles Lakers accomplished the feat in 2002.\n\nThe close-knit Miami group was ready to take on the challenge and then it happened. The Heat used their amnesty provision on Miller, releasing him from the team. It was a move that saved the organization approximately $17 million in luxury taxes.\n\nThe decision to waive Miller didn't sit well with James. It was one of the first times he began to question the Heat's brass.\n\nAlthough Miller played in only 139 of 246 games because of various injuries with the Heat in three seasons (he played in all 82 games last season for Memphis), his impact in the locker room always kept the team's morale in the proper state.\n\nHe was James' guy and when you start to point to all the different reasons to why The King exited South Beach, the way and timing in which the Heat dumped Miller shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nA three-peat quest without Miller didn't fare well. Not to say that Miller would have put them over the top of the San Antonio Spurs, however, his departure was definitely felt.\n\nIt was a departure James was highly against.\n\n\"LeBron thought it was an unnecessary change,\" Miller revealed to Northeast Ohio Media Group. \"I'm not saying I would have been a difference-maker. San Antonio was unbelievable last year and there are a lot of things that go into a season, but it was difficult for LeBron.\n\n\"It was difficult for all of us. It was difficult for me. I had to uproot my family and move again. It was tough. I think he was disappointed because he understands legacies and he understands what he wants to do in life. That's what makes him special.\"\n\nJames was one of the first of his old teammates to reach out to Miller after he was amnestied. The two expressed their extreme frustration with the move. Miller found himself comforting James just as much as James tried comforting Miller.\n\nA brotherhood was formed in Miami and it seemed as if they were being torn apart forever.\n\n\"It was a tough pill to swallow for both of us,\" Miller said. \"That team went through a lot. The same thing this team is hoping to go through. You're going to have ups and downs and you grow close. For me, I had a great relationship with LeBron and still have. It was extremely difficult.\n\n\"But it also meant a lot to me to see how much they cared, specifically LeBron and those guys, that I meant so much to them. Because at the end of the day, all you have are your teammates.\"\n\nSo when James made the decision to return home, the first call he made for spot-up shooting assistance was to none other than his brother.\n\n\"He's hoping I'm a lucky charm for him,\" Miller said with a smile.\n\nIt has been a reunion of sorts in Cleveland with former Heat, James Jones, on the Cavaliers' squad as well. With Kevin Love and Shawn Marion also in the fold, James has shown that his recruiting skills have blossomed.\n\n\"I guess I had to prove I could win a championship,\" James said. \"I was able to do that twice.\"\n\nThe business side of the NBA is the most complicated facet for players to deal with. James found that out the hard way. Even though it's been over a year since that fateful transaction occurred, Miller still wrestles with what could have been.\n\n\"It was difficult for me because we had a chance to do something special,\" said Miller. \" At this point in my career, right now, it is about finding ways to do something special.\n\n\"It's not about getting out on the court, or playing or making shots. We had a chance to three-peat in Miami. That was difficult but I understand their move, the business side. I'm glad it's behind me. I'm happy where I'm at.\""
