        "text": "Mike Miller came to Syracuse as an assistant coach in February 2010 and was named the program's recruiting coordinator in 2011.\n\nSince joining the Orange, Miller has been integral to bringing several youth national team and U.S. Soccer Development Academy League players to Syracuse. Miller's 2011 recruiting class was ranked No. 40 in the country by College Soccer News and included Nick Perea, who was named one of the top 100 freshmen in the nation by TopDrawerSoccer.com. The Orange's 2012 class was rated No. 14 nationally by College Soccer News and featured BIG EAST All-Rookie selection and freshman All-American Alex Bono as well as Stefanos Stamoulacatos. Both players were ranked in the top 150 by ESPN Rise.\n\nIn addition to his recruiting responsibilities, Miller mentors the Orange goalkeepers, is involved in all team training, and handles various administrative duties related to marketing, game operations, video editing and opponent scouting. He is the founder of the Syracuse Soccer Goalkeeper Academy and he organizes the program's various camps and clinics.\n\nMiller's work was essential to the Orange's breakout 2012 campaign. Syracuse was the most improved team in the nation, posting a 14-6-1 record after going 3-12-1 in 2011. The team earned the program's second NCAA Tournament berth and advanced to the Sweet 16 (third round) before being eliminated on penalty kicks by eventual national finalist Georgetown. In addition, the Orange finished the year ranked 17th in the final NSCAA/Continental Tire Poll, the second time in school history Syracuse appeared in the organization's final rankings.\n\nFor their efforts, Miller and the rest of the Orange coaches were selected as the 2012 BIG EAST Coaching Staff of the Year.\n\nPrior to joining the Orange, Miller worked as an assistant at the University of Evansville from 2006-09. While with the Purple Aces, Miller helped bring in two College Soccer News Top 40 recruiting classes, including the 23rd-rated class in 2008. He also mentored the Evansville goalkeepers and assisted in opponent scouting.\n\nDuring his tenure there, he trained goalie Alec Dufty, who signed with the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer (MLS) in 2009 before joining the Columbus Crew. He also coached Phil Boerger, a U.S. youth national team performer and All-Missouri Valley Conference honoree who concluded his collegiate career at Syracuse in 2011.\n\nWhile in Evansville, Miller also worked as the head coach of the Evansville Soccer Club U-18 and U-16 teams. He was a member of the Indiana State ODP staff from 2006-08 and served as a national goalkeeper coach for the Super Y League in 2006 and 2007.\n\nPrior to his appointment at Evansville, Miller was an assistant coach at the University of North Florida from 2004-06 and worked as a youth coach for the Clay County Soccer Club in Jacksonville, Fla. for several years.\n\nMiller played his college soccer at Jacksonville University from 1999-2003. A goalkeeper himself, Miller started for two seasons and totaled 84 saves with four shutouts in his career. He was named to the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASC) All-Tournament Team as a junior and was the ASC Defensive Player of the Week twice. He also played for the PDL Cocoa Expos.\n\nA member of the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA), Miller holds several national coaching licenses and serves on the group’s committee that is responsible for selecting the national assistant coach of the year.\n\nMiller received a bachelor’s degree in physical education from Jacksonville in 2004 and earned a master’s degree in public administration from Evansville in 2009.\n\nMiller married the former Morley Zachman in June 2011. The couple resides in Syracuse with their dog, Gracie."
