        "text": "Just before training camp and preseason was underway, the Washington Wizards announced a restructured coaching staff for the 2023-24 season under Head Coach Wes Unseld Jr.\n\n“With the additions we’ve made during the offseason and the personnel that we have returning, I’m very confident that we have assembled a top-notch staff that will prioritize and facilitate internal growth and development for all of our players,” said Unseld Jr. “We are all looking forward to working as a group as we begin training camp next week.”\n\nThe Wizards added Brian Keefe and David Vanterpool as assistant coaches and Sammy Gelfand as assistant coach/analytics during the offseason, all of whom come to Washington with over 10 years of experience in the NBA. Returning coaching staff are Joseph Blair, Mike Miller, Zach Guthrie and James Posey.\n\nWizards President Michael Winger and General Manager Will Dawkins have spoken specifically about the organization’s increased focus on player development. Landon Tatum, who spent last season as associate head coach of the Capital City Go Go will lead player development. He will be joined by player development assistants Ryan Lumpkin, Joe Ajike and Pete Fusilero.\n\nWashington Wizards 2023-24 Coaching Staff\n\nWes Unseld Jr - Head Coach\n\nBrian Keefe - Assistant Coach\n\nJoseph Blair - Assistant Coach\n\nDavid Vanterpool - Assistant Coach\n\nMike Miller - Assistant Coach\n\nZach Guthrie - Assistant Coach\n\nJames Posey - Assistant Coach\n\nSammy Gelfand - Assistant Coach/Analytics\n\nLandon Tatum - Player Development Lead\n\nRyan Lumpkin - Player Development\n\nJoe Ajike - Player Development/Video\n\nPete Fusilero - Player Development/Video\n\nDaniel Villareal - Video Coordinator\n\nAddison Lee - Assistant Video Coordinator"
