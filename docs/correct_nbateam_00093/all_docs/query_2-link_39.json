The longtime NBA player will coach his sons Mason and Mavrick Miller on the team.\n\nMason Miller is a 6-foot-9 forward who is the No. 1 prospect in Tennessee for the Class of 2021, according to the 247Sports Composite. Mason has multiple Power 5 offers, but said he is focusing on Indiana, Ohio State, and Creighton as his top schools. Mavrick Miller is a sophomore who played on the team last year.\n\nMike Miller replaces Charlie Leonard, who led the Mustangs to a 29-4 record and their first state tournament appearance last season.\n\n“I’m excited to be a part of an outstanding school like Houston,\" Miller said in a news release. \"The opportunity to coach these kids is going to be an awesome experience. I’m thankful for everything Coach Leonard has done for my children. I’m ready to do my best to continue the culture he quickly created and continue to build a basketball program our community will be proud of!!”"
