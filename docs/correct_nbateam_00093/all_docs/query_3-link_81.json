        "text": "DENVER â€” The Denver Nuggets have waived 37-year-old shooting guard Mike Miller.\n\nThe team announced the news on its Twitter account Tuesday.\n\nMiller played only 20 games last season as he served more of a coaching role from the bench for a Nuggets team that missed out on the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.\n\nOver his career, Miller also played for Cleveland, Memphis, Miami, Washington, Minnesota and Orlando. He suited up in 1,032 games and averaged 10.6 points.\n\nMiller was the sixth man of the year in 2005-06 while with the Grizzlies. He averaged 13.7 points that season and made 138 3-pointers.\n\nIn addition, Miller was named to the All-Rookie team in 2000-01 after being taken with the fifth overall pick by the Magic.\n\n[relatedlinks]"
