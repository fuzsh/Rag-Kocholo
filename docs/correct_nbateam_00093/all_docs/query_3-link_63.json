        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — The Minnesota Timberwolves have agreed to trade guards Randy Foye and Mike Miller to the Washington Wizards for the fifth overall draft pick and three players, according to Yahoo! Sports.\n\nThe deal would give Minnesota the fifth and sixth overall selections in Thursday's NBA draft, as well as forwards Etan Thomas, Darius Songaila and Oleksiy Pecherov.\n\nThe Web site cited anonymous sources. New Timberwolves president David Kahn did not immediately return a message left by The Associated Press.\n\nThe Timberwolves also have the 18th and 28th selections in the first round, which gives them plenty of ammunition to potentially create a package to move up even higher in the draft to go after either Spanish guard Ricky Rubio or Connecticut center Hasheem Thabeet.\n\nThe Wizards, unlike most lottery teams, feel they can afford to deal a high first-round draft pick because they're already adding a major impact player next season. Gilbert Arenas is expected to return at full strength after missing most of the last two seasons due to multiple knee surgeries, putting Washington in contention to return to the playoffs immediately despite coming off a 19-63 season that matched the worst 82-game record in franchise history.\n\nThe Wizards also have a plentiful supply of youngsters who are supposedly up-and-coming — Nick Young, JaVale McGee, Andray Blatche, Dominic McGuire — and are in need of more veteran poise in the locker room rather than another developing rookie.\n\nKahn is off to an aggressive start heading into his first draft at the helm of the Timberwolves.\n\nLast week he chose not to bring back Kevin McHale, the longtime Timberwolves executive, as coach and now he has cut the chord with what was viewed as one of McHale's biggest draft-day gaffes.\n\nIn 2006, McHale drafted Brandon Roy before trading him to Portland for Foye and cash. Roy developed into an All-Star and one of the best young players in the game. Foye has been solid, but not spectacular, while struggling with a knee injury.\n\nHe picked up some of the scoring load when Al Jefferson went down with a knee injury in February. Foye averaged 16.3 points and 4.3 assists, but the Wolves had difficulty deciding whether to play him at point guard or shooting guard.\n\nMiller, a former Gator star, came to Minnesota from Memphis nearly one year ago in a package that included Kevin Love in exchange for O.J. Mayo and a handful of retreads.\n\nViewed as one of the best perimeter shooters in the game, Miller played a far more passive game in his only season with the Wolves. He averaged a career-low 9.9 points per game and frustrated fans with his seemingly stubborn refusal to shoot the ball.\n\nThomas has an opt-out clause in his contract that would allow him to become a free agent on July 1. He averaged 3.1 points and 2.5 rebounds in just 26 games last season for the Wizards.\n\nSongaila averaged 7.4 points and 2.9 rebounds in 77 games last season."
