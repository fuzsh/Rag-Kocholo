        "text": "American baseball player (born 1989)\n\nBaseball player\n\nMichael Ryan Miller (born September 27, 1989) is an American former professional baseball infielder. He has played in one Major League Baseball (MLB) game, with the Boston Red Sox in 2016. Listed at 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) and 170 pounds (77 kg), he bats and throws right-handed.\n\nMiller attended De La Salle High School in Concord, California,[1] Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo, California,[2] and California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo.\n\nFor Cuesta, Miller hit .392 during the 2009 season.[3] In 2012, he earned first-team All-Big West selection after pacing the Mustangs with a .354 batting average.[4]\n\nMiller was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the ninth round of the 2012 MLB draft, with the 301st overall pick. From 2012 through 2015, Miller played for several Red Sox farm teams: the Low–A Lowell Spinners, the Single–A Greenville Drive, the High–A Salem Red Sox, the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs, and the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox.\n\nMiller began the 2016 season with Double-A Portland,[5] and was subsequently promoted to Triple-A Pawtucket. On June 27, Miller was added to Boston's major league roster.[6][7] Miller made his MLB debut in that day's game against the Tampa Bay Rays, entering as a defensive replacement at second base in the eighth inning, and grounding out in an at bat in the ninth inning.[8] On July 2, Miller was sent outright back to Pawtucket,[9] removing him from the 40-man roster. Miller finished the season in Triple-A, appearing in 90 games while batting .228.\n\nIn 2017, Miller appeared in 85 games for Pawtucket, batting .261. He also made four appearances as a relief pitcher, registering a 12.71 ERA in 5+2⁄3 innings pitched. In 2018, he batted .284 with four home runs and 31 RBI in 102 games with Pawtucket.[10] He became a free agent after the 2018 season,[11] then re-signed with the Red Sox organization in February 2019.[10]\n\nMiller began the 2019 season with Pawtucket,[10] and was granted his release on August 3.[12]\n\nOn August 5, 2019, Miller signed a minor league deal with the Minnesota Twins and was assignment to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings. He elected free agency on November 4, 2019."
