        "text": "While Brian Keefe isn’t technically among this offseason’s new head coaches — he took over Washington’s job midway through the 2023-24 campaign when Wes Unseld Jr.transitioned to a front office role — the Wizards have revamped his coaching staff heading into Keefe’s first full season at the helm.\n\nAccording to a press release from the team, veteran assistant David Vanterpool is the only member of last season’s staff returning for 2024-25. The new additions, some of whom were previously reported, are as follows:\n\nAdam Caporn, a former G League head coach for the Long Island Nets who spent the past three seasons as an assistant in Brooklyn.\n\nJ.J. Outlaw, an assistant coach with the Cavaliers for the past five seasons who also had stints with the Lakers and Grizzlies.\n\nBrian Randle, who spent last season as a Pistons assistant and previously worked for the Suns (as an assistant) and Timberwolves (as a player development coach).\n\nT.J. Sorrentine, a longtime assistant coach at Brown University.\n\nAlexis Ajinca, a seven-year NBA veteran who also played professionally in France and transitioned into coaching in 2023 as an assistant for the Capital City Go-Go, Washington’s G League affiliate.\n\nJoseph Blair, James Posey, and Mike Miller were among the notable assistants the Wizards let go when the club cleaned house in April."
