He served as Tight Ends coach each season and added co-Offensive Coordinator duties in 2022. In 2021, he was the Passing Game Coordinator. Miller, who was born in Irmo, S.C. and spent much of his childhood in Charlotte, also coached at Charlotte Christian High School.\n\n\"Mike's name was at the front of every conversation and recommendation when I spoke to people about up-and-coming play callers,\" said Poggi, who was named 49ers' head coach in November. \"He has coached with Brian Daboll and Nick Saban at Alabama, Dabo Swinney and Mike Locksley. These men are some of the best in our profession. Mike is a great teacher and mentor. Players love him and he loves his players. We have a star in Mike Miller.\"\n\n\"I'm humbled and thankful that coach Poggi would offer me this opportunity,\" said Miller. \"Megan, our children and I are thrilled to be back home. Being a former high school coach in Charlotte I always thought that Charlotte football was a sleeping giant. Hearing coach Poggi's vision, I know he's going to take this place to a standard of excellence that people in this community can be proud of.\n\nWe came here to develop young people and we came here to win, and win now. I can't wait to get started.\"\n\nHIGH-SCORING TERRAPINS\n\nThe high-scoring Terrapins have posted 27 or more points in 11 straight wins, including a 54-10 win over Virginia Tech in the 2021 New Era Pinstripe Bowl. Miller helped the Terps set numerous school records as Passing Game Coordinator during the 2021 season, including the single-season program marks for total yards (5,740), passing yards (3,960), completions (339) and completion percentage (69.3%). Maryland quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa also set seven single-season Maryland records, including program best marks for passing yards (3,860), completions (328), completion percentage (69.2) and passing touchdowns (26, to tie school record).\n\nTight end Chigoziem Okonkwo hauled in 52 receptions for 447 yards and five touchdowns to rank first in the Big Ten in receptions in conference games (41) and second in receiving touchdowns (five). Fellow tight end Corey Dyches had 19 grabs for 208 yards and four touchdowns. In Miller's first year leading the unit, Maryland's two tight ends, Okonkwo and Tyler Mabry, combined for 32 receptions for 356 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nMiller was recognized by 247 Sports as one of college football's rising stars in their 2019 '30 Under 30' list. He was also named to the American Football Coaches Association's 35 Under 35 Coaches Leadership Institute in December of 2021.\n\nNATIONAL CHAMP\n\nHe joined the Terrapins in 2019 after spending two seasons (2017-18) as an offensive graduate assistant at Alabama where he worked primarily with the Crimson Tide quarterbacks and wide receivers.\n\nIn 2018, Alabama's offense set school records for points scored (684), single-season total offense (7,830 yards) and passing yards (4,854) in a season. The Crimson Tide finished the season averaging 47.9 points and 527.6 yards per game. Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was named first-team All-SEC, won the Walter Camp and Maxwell Awards, and finished second in the Heisman Trophy balloting and threw for 3,189 yards and a school-record 37 touchdowns. Wideout Jerry Jeudy, the 2018 Biletnikoff Award winner, caught 68 passes for 1,315 yards (19.3 avg.) and 14 touchdowns. The Crimson Tide won the 2018 SEC Championship and the 2019 College Football Playoff Semifinal Orange Bowl.\n\nIn 2017, Miller helped coach All-SEC first team selection Calvin Ridley, who hauled in 63 passes for 967 yards and five touchdowns as the Crimson Tide won the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship.\n\nLOCAL TIES\n\nIn 2016, Miller served as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Charlotte Christian (N.C.) High School. Charlotte Christian finished the season 10-2 and averaged 40 points per game.\n\nMiller helped coach the quarterbacks as a student coach at Clemson University in 2015. The 2015 Tigers had a school-record 11 consecutive games with at least 500 yards of total offense behind Deshaun Watson, who became the first player in FBS history with at least 4,000 passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards in a season. The Tigers had a perfect regular season, won the 2015 ACC Championship and the 2016 College Football Playoff Semifinal Orange Bowl.\n\nOriginally a walk-on quarterback at UAB, he would go on to earn a scholarship in 2013. He began his career as a defensive student coach at UAB in 2014 and earned his degree in Communications from UAB in 2015.\n\nFOOTBALL FAMILY\n\nMiller's father, Mike Miller Sr., played wide receiver at Ole Miss from 1975-79. His Grandfather, Art Miller, played offensive guard at Duke University for legendary head coach Wallace Wade from 1939-1942.\n\nHe and his wife, Megan, have three children, Bo, Grisham and Mary Caitlin."
