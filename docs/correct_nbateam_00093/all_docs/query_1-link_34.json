        "text": "He apparently wants to become a part of what’s going on in Cleveland.\n\nVeteran long-range shooter Mike Miller agreed to a two-year, $5.5 million deal with the Cavaliers on July 15.\n\nThe deal was first reported by ESPN’s Chris Broussard\n\n, who said Miller turned down more money from Houston and Denver to play with LeBron James.\n\nThe second year of the deal will be a player option. The Cavs used their ‘room exception’ on the 6-foot-8, 218-pound Miller.\n\nThe first year of the contract is worth $2.7 million.\n\nThe Cavs made a run at Miller last summer, but he went to Memphis and played for the veteran’s minimum. He played in all 82 games for the Grizzlies and averaged 7.1 points and 2.5 rebounds. He shot 45.9 percent from the 3-point line.\n\nThat will be his role with the Cavs: Spread the floor and shoot 3s, which is summed up in his Twitter profile, which reads: #letitfly.\n\nIn his 14-year career, the 34-year-old has shot 40.9 percent from behind the arc.\n\nMiller, the fifth overall pick in the 2000 draft by the Orlando Magic, played three seasons with James in Miami. The Heat used their amnesty clause on him on July 16, 2013, a move that didn’t go over big with James. He ended up signing with the Grizzlies for $1.4 million.\n\nWhen Miller signs with the Cavs, they will have 13 players on their roster. They are still in need of a big man.\n\nMiller has played for Orlando, Memphis, Washington and Miami in his career."
