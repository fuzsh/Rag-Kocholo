He was promoted to Associate AD for Marketing, Ticketing and Fan Engagement in July of 2022.\n\nAt Columbia, Miller’s responsibilities will focus on overseeing the University’s athletic marketing, ticketing and fan development areas.\n\n\"We are excited to add someone of Mike’s caliber to our staff,” Senior Associate Athletics Director for External Relations Bob Steitz said. “Mike's experience and knowledge of strategic marketing and demonstrated success in revenue generation will be a tremendous asset to the department.”\n\nMiller arrives in Morningside Heights after spending the past eight years at Wagner College as its Associate Athletic Director for External Relations. During his time at Wagner, Miller’s main duties centered around developing and implementing strategic marketing plans for football, men’s and women’s basketball, coordinating community service events and projects with student-athletes and local charities, executing plans for each event to gain maximum exposure and managing and cultivating a client base of national and local corporate partners with sponsorship revenue and overseeing all athletic branding and licensing opportunities. He also developed strategic plans to upgrade facilities, organized fundraising events and athletic alumni events and functions and served as the creative director for videoboard content. In addition, he served as the sport administrator for the Wagner men’s and women’s tennis and men’s and women’s golf teams, along with the cheerleading, dance and marching bands squads.\n\nAmong his many accomplishments at Wagner include increasing ticket revenue by 17 percent for men’s basketball and 15 percent for football, increasing attendance in both men’s basketball and football, cultivating a client base of corporate sponsors with a 25 percent surge, growing merchandise revenue by 10 percent and expanding Touchdown Club memberships by 30 percent.\n\n\"I’d like to thank Peter Pilling and Bob Steitz for this tremendous opportunity to work at such a prestigious institution as Columbia University,\" Miller said. \"I am excited to work with such great student-athletes and promote their success on and off the field.\"\n\nPrior to his stint at Wagner, Miller served as an assistant sports information director at Fordham University (2009), marketing & promotions and sports information graduate assistant at Wagner (2007-08), worked for four years in the Mount St. Mary’s Sports Information Department (2003-07) and gained experience with MSM television (2005-07). He also served summer public relations internships in minor league baseball with the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (2006) and Camden Riversharks (2005).\n\nA 2007 graduate of Mount St. Mary’s University with a bachelor’s degree in Communications Studies, he went on to earn a Master’s of Business Administration in International Business from Wagner College in 2013.\n\nMiller resides in Clark, N.J. with his wife Danielle and son Carson."
