A mercenary is one who engages in battle as a hired person rather than in service to a particular country through patriotism. A "Soldier for Hire".

The primary mercenaries of the American Revolution were German Hessians fighting for the British. Some American Indian Tribes were recruited on both sides, and when the French allies with the Colonies some of their troops were also mercenaries.
