        "text": "Day-to-day life in the Military varies depending on Service branch, career choice and location, but there are several experiences service members have in common. Preparing for Basic Training, taking care of a family on base or deploying for the first time are just a few examples. Get a complete picture of military life by learning about all its unique challenges and benefits.\n\nJump to Section\n\nDaily life\n\nTravel and deployment\n\nFamily and support\n\nDaily Life\n\nLength of Commitment\n\nA service member's length of commitment largely depends on the Service branch, career choice and required training. Most first-term enlistments are four years of Active Duty, followed by four years in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). Active Duty is not a 24-hour job; service members have off-work hours, similar to people in civilian jobs.\n\nOn the other hand, the IRR could be described as an \"on-call\" job. You don't train, and you live at home maintaining a civilian job, but you may be called to duty, if necessary, until your term expires. Some service branches also have an annual muster requirement to check in on basic health and fitness. Most local recruiters have all the details you'll need about terms of service.\n\nPhysical Fitness\n\nPhysical fitness has always been a large part of military training. It's a crucial element of Basic Training and strongly encouraged throughout a service member's military career.\n\nBasic Training\n\nEvery recruit must pass the Physical Fitness Test (PFT) at Basic Training to graduate. The best way to approach any PFT is to come in as physically prepared as possible. Review the specifics of your Service branch's PFT and focus on the required exercises. Also, remember to time yourself; it will help you practice pacing.\n\nPreparing for Basic Training\n\nAfter Basic Training\n\nPhysical fitness requirements for service members vary according to branch and career choice. Though fitness goals are different for each branch, all service members are required to pass the PFT. Based on their fitness scores, some service members may need to to take the PFT every six months.\n\nHousing\n\nOn-base housing varies by rank, location and family situation. All recruits live in the barracks during Basic Training. Upon completing Basic Training, most single service members are required to live on base for a period of time. On-base housing varies from one location to the next, but, generally speaking, it is similar to living in modern college dormitories and apartment complexes. Service members with families who live on base have a variety of options, such as apartments or single-family homes.\n\nIn addition to the living quarters, most bases feature many amenities and recreational facilities accessible only to military personnel and their families at greatly reduced prices. Some examples include gyms, pools, bowling alleys, movie theaters, riding stables, libraries, camping grounds and golf courses.\n\nService members who live in off-base housing are given a Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), which varies depending on the cost of living in their area. Also, keep in mind that off-base housing is granted based on a service member's rank and family status.\n\nBasic Allowance for Housing (DoD Travel Management Office)\n\nUniform\n\nEach Service branch uniform is different, and service members take great pride in their distinct dress. From the black silk neckerchief worn with Navy Service Dress Whites to the Outer Tactical Vest worn with Army and Marine Corps Utility uniforms, service member dress caters to both form and function. Generally speaking, uniforms can be broken down as follows:\n\nEvening/Full/Mess/Dinner Dress\n\nThis is considered formalwear. This uniform would be worn to special occasions such as balls, graduations, award ceremonies and weddings.\n\nService Dress\n\nThis refers to daily uniforms, roughly equivalent to the civilian \"business suit.\" These uniforms are worn in office environments and at certain public events.\n\nUtility/Working Uniform\n\nThese are work-duty uniforms. These uniforms are worn in combat and during day-to-day functions.\n\nPhysical Training Uniform\n\nThis is considered fitnesswear. These uniforms are worn during any type of physical training exercises.\n\nAll service members are provided an initial issue of required uniforms upon enlistment. Some service members are also given an annual clothing allowance to buy or replace uniforms.\n\nSocial Life\n\nBeing part of the Military doesn't mean giving up a social life. In fact, it's quite the opposite. From recreational facilities on base and special entertainment to sports leagues and discounted leisure travel, military personnel often maintain very active social lives.\n\nThere are plenty of on-base entertainment resources available to service members and their families: gyms, movie theaters, bowling alleys, parks and more. In addition to facilities, the Military also works with Armed Forces Entertainment to bring exclusive entertainment shows. Today, Armed Forces Entertainment hosts hundreds of exclusive entertainment shows around the world each year at various military installations, featuring some of the most popular musicians, comedians, athletes and actors.\n\nFor service members who like sports, the Military also has its own sports league: Armed Forces Sports. The program includes 25 different sports categories open to all active-duty personnel and features nine national championships and 16 international championships.\n\nThe Military also offers discounted vacation opportunities to service members and their families. Each Service branch has a Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) department dedicated to helping personnel with travel, recreation and social activities. You can learn more by visiting each program's site:\n\nArmy MWR\n\nNavy MWR\n\nAir Force Lifestyle\n\nCoast Guard MWR\n\nMarine Corps Community Services\n\nTravel and Deployment\n\nTravel Opportunities\n\nThere are many opportunities to travel the world in the Military. Your first step after Basic Training will most likely be “A” School or Advanced Individual Training (AIT), followed by travel to your first duty assignment. While there's no guarantee of placement, you can volunteer for overseas duty if you want to see more of the world. The Military has bases in Hawaii, Japan, Germany, England, Italy, Spain and other unique locations. And no matter where they are based, depending on their current assignment, service members have opportunities to travel the world through deployment and recreation.\n\nIf you're looking to travel on your own, many commercial airlines offer discounted fares for service members. In addition, you can often take a free \"hop\" on a government airplane when extra seats are available through the Military's Space-Available (Space-A) program. The Military also operates low-cost rest and relaxation lodges and hotels in Korea, Hawaii, Germany and other popular destinations—even Disney World.\n\nWorld Travel(Today's Military)\n\nDeployment\n\nGenerally speaking, deployment is the moving of military personnel and materials from a home station to a specified destination. It's never guaranteed that a service member will be deployed, and it depends on an individual's Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) and unit of assignment (the group of service members you work with).\n\nKeep in mind that deployment doesn't automatically mean going to war. Service members can be deployed for support in noncombat areas or foreign humanitarian missions, or they may even be deployed domestically to help with disaster relief. The U.S. Military has bases in multiple countries besides the United States. During deployments, service members may have some time for recreation and exploration.\n\nWith that said, deployment can present legitimate concerns. Proper preparation, especially for service members with families, can help minimize stress and anxiety. Online communities are available that offer guidance and support to service members and their families. It's also important to note that during deployment, service members usually have access to postal mail, email, instant messaging and phone service (even at sea). While communication may be restricted during certain missions, modern technology makes it relatively easy for service members to keep in touch.\n\nDeployment (Military OneSource)\n\nFamily and Support\n\nFamily\n\nThe Military understands that family is an important part of service members' lives. More than half of the active-duty force, approximately 50 percent, are married, and approximately 40 percent of families with active-duty service members include children. As a result, the Military makes family support a top priority.\n\nLearn More About Family and Community in the Military\n\nThe Military has established exclusive programs addressing every aspect of family life to help service members and their loved ones. Some examples include affordable family housing, military spouse education, child care, affordable shopping, youth education and development, family health care, family advocacy, services for families with special needs, family citizenship, family recreation, financial stability, family relocation and family counseling. The Military is constantly developing and expanding programs to maximize service member families' stability and quality of life. Here are some of the better-known organizations:\n\nNational Military Family Association\n\nMilitary OneSource\n\nMarine Corps Community Services\n\nSupport Networks\n\nWhether a service member needs help with relocation, parenting, deployment, education, stress or any other aspect of military life, there are several support networks available to service members and their families. See the following sites for more information on these support networks:\n\nMilitary OneSource"
