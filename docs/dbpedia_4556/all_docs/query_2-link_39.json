        "text": "See Dogs of War for more information about mercenary armies and mercenary bands.\n\n\"It's the hero's job to die gloriously; it's my job to get paid.\"\n\n—Marcello Finetti, Tilean mercenary[1b]\n\nA mercenary, also known as a Dog of War, a hired sword, a sell-sword, or a soldier of fortune, is a soldier who fights in the wars of the Old World for pay. War never ends in the Old World and that means there is always a need for fighting men and women. While the Empire does maintain a standing army, its strength is sometimes bolstered with mercenaries.[7a]\n\nMercenaries use all sorts of armour and equipment, but most wear at least a mail shirt and leather jack for protection. Many mercenaries favour the crossbow and carry one of these weapons with a quiver of a dozen bolts. Mercenaries often carry a magical healing draught to fortify them on a military campaign.[8a]\n\nRole[]\n\n\"All for one and every man for himself!...\"\n\n—Common mercenary tactic[3a]\n\nIn addition to the demand for mercenaries from realms like the Empire or the Tilean city-states in the Old World, individual nobles and rich merchants hire mercenaries to protect their interests, many maintaining what amounts to a private army. Mercenaries range from wild youths with a taste for adventure to grizzled professional soldiers who have seen a dozen battles or more. These sell-swords come from all over, though Tilea is particularly famed for its mercenary regiments, who are commonly known as \"Dogs of War.\" All mercenaries dream of untold riches; for most of them, the reality is an early death and an unmarked grave.[1a]\n\nMercenaries that have found themselves down on their luck could take work on a merchant vessel or a ship on a voyage of exploration. Neither are ideal due to the dank conditions and lack of freedom. Also the basic pay is not always the best and some voyages can last for years. Free passage may not be ideal but there is a fate far worse. Press gangs are a constant threat for the unwary in any port, coastal town or city of the Old World. Tilean captains are the most notorious for this practice when they become short of crew.[5a]\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Empire has repelled invasions from foreign powers and has stood steadfast in the face of marauding Greenskins or Norscan barbarians from the northlands. At other times, the Empire has been riven with internal divisions, such as the civil wars fought during the Age of Three Emperors or the bloody siege of 1865 IC prosecuted by the Elector Count of Middenland against his rival in the city of Carroburg.[8a]\n\nEven in periods of relative peace, or in areas that have not seen conflict for years, there is always a job available for a fighting man. Nobles often hire mercenaries to garrison their holdings, to provide muscle for expeditions, or to pursue a feud with a rival. Merchant houses employ mercenaries to guard caravans and warehouses, while priests hire them as bodyguards or to provide security for temples. Guild masters, wizards from the Colleges of Magic, organised criminals, and even the agents of Chaos have all commissioned sell-swords at times.[8a]\n\nMost of the mercenaries in the Empire are men and women who once fought as militia alongside the Imperial army. Such troops often find they develop a taste for conflict and bloodshed, and so join mercenary bands known as Free Companies.[8a]\n\nBut even in the heart of the Empire, mercenaries often originate from foreign lands.[8a]\n\nMercenaries by Realm[]\n\nAraby - The horsemen of Araby are widely considered to be among the best in the Known World -- though Kislevite horsemen might disagree. Most Arabyan mercenaries who travel northwards to the Old World arrive without mounts, but they can serve as cavalry if equipped by their employers.[2a]\n\nBorder Princes - Mercenaries are the mainstay of Border Prince armies, travelling from across the Old World to make their living. Native Border Prince mercenaries typically fight as the core troops of an army.[2a]\n\nBretonnia - Bretonnian lords do not hire mercenaries in their armies, considering them a waste of money when peasants cost nothing at all. Bretonnian mercenaries are therefore rare, but not unheard of.[2a]\n\nDwarfs - It is rare, but not unknown for Dwarfs to join Tilean Condottieri or mercenary companies as foot soldier and artillerists.[4a]\n\nEstalia - Estalian mercenaries are skilled swordsmen with hot tempers. Because they don't cooperate well with other mercenaries, Estalians are often hired in smaller groups and given special objectives to handle on their own. They perform well at this role.[2a]\n\nKislev - Bravery and resilience are the qualities sought by the employers of Kislevite mercenaries. These mercenaries are often hired to bolster standing armies against Chaos threats. Kislevite horsemen, however, are loyal only to their own clans, and do not work as mercenaries.[2a] Mercenaries are less common in Kislev, reducing the availability of this military resource in their motherland.[6b]\n\nNorsca - Norscan mercenaries are considered too unreliable for regular use, because they sometimes disregard orders in the heat of battle. Nevertheless, Norscan mercenaries are occasionally employed for their sheer intimidation value.[2a]\n\nOgre - Ogres are big, ugly humanoids, with coarse features and an imposing presence. Ogres enjoy eating, fighting, and eating some more. While they may be brutal and can eat nearly anything, Ogres are not evil per se. Since dumb muscle is always welcome in almost any army, Ogres can be found throughout the Old World, far beyond their origins in the Ogre Kingdoms of the Far East. They make formidable mercenaries and bands of Ogre sell-swords are a common sight in the Empire, Tilea, and the Border Princes. They have also been known to fight alongside the armies of the Orcs, Goblins, and the forces of Chaos. Far to the northeast of the Empire are the Ogre Kingdoms, but few Imperial Ogres have cause to go there.[6a]\n\nThe Empire - The Empire's mercenaries are adventuring ruffians armed with a wide assortment of weapons. These mercenaries form free company regiments in the Empire's armies, or travel to the Border Princes when there are no wars to fight at home.[2a]\n\nTilea - Mercenaries are so common in Tilea that they are represented by guilds. Tilean mercenaries are known for their bargaining skills and have even switched sides during battles when offered more money by their opponents.[2a] And yet Tilean mercenaries have a reputation for professionalism that other sell-swords do not. Other foreign mercenaries, such as Kossars from Kislev, the almost feral berserkers from Norsca, or the enormous Ogres who ply their trade in the Empire are often viewed with distrust if not open hostility.[8a]\n\nSources[]"
