        "text": "\"19K\" redirects here. For the chemical element (19K), see potassium.\n\nThe United States Army uses various personnel management systems to classify soldiers in different specialties which they receive specialized and formal training on once they have successfully completed Basic Combat Training (BCT).\n\nEnlisted soldiers are categorized by their assigned job called a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS). MOS are labeled with a short alphanumerical code called a military occupational core specialty code (MOSC), which consists of a two-digit number appended by a Latin letter. Related MOSs are grouped together by Career Management Fields (CMF). For example, an enlisted soldier with MOSC 11B works as an infantryman (his MOS), and is part of CMF 11 (the CMF for infantry).\n\nCommissioned officers are classified by their area of concentration, or AOC. Just like enlisted MOSCs, AOCs are two digits plus a letter. Related AOCs are grouped together by specific branch of the Army or by broader in scope functional areas (FA). Typically, an officer will start in an AOC of a specific branch and move up to an FA AOC.\n\nWarrant officers are classified by warrant officer military occupational specialty, or WOMOS. Codes consists of three digits plus a letter. Related WOMOS are grouped together by Army branch.\n\nThe Army is currently restructuring its personnel management systems, as of 2019.[1][2][3] Changes took place in 2004 and continued into 2013. Changes include deleting obsolete jobs, merging redundant jobs, and using common numbers for both enlisted CMFs and officer AOCs (e.g. \"35\" is military intelligence for both officers and enlisted).\n\nOfficer\n\n00A Duties Unassigned\n\n00B General Officer\n\n00C Relieved from Duty; Sick in Hospital or Quarters\n\n00D Newly Commissioned Officers Awaiting Entry on Active Duty for
