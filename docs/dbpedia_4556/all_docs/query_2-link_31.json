        "text": "Yevgeny Prigozhin and the origins of the Wagner Group\n\nPMC (private military company) Wagner was created as a legal entity in Russia in December 2022, but the mercenary group’s activities predate its official founding by nearly a decade. Because Wagner has spent most of its existence in a gray area of plausible deniability, its origins and organizational structure are, by design, murky. The most credible account of the group’s creation involves Dmitry Utkin, a former GRU and Spetsnaz officer, and a short-lived mercenary company called the Slavonic Corps. The Slavonic Corps was formed in 2013 to provide support for the regime of Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian Civil War, but the unit was routed in its first engagement, a clash with fighters from the Islamic State (ISIL) outside Homs in October 2013. In early 2014 Utkin became associated with a GRU-backed mercenary company that drew at least part of its membership from the Slavonic Corps, and its name—Wagner—was reportedly derived from Utkin’s former radio call sign.\n\nIn February 2014 Ukraine’s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, fled Ukraine for Russia after a wave of popular protest drove him from office. Russia responded to the loss of its asset in Kyiv by invading the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea. Russian troops overthrew the regional government and installed a Moscow-backed regime. On March 18 Putin signed a treaty incorporating Crimea into the Russian Federation, an illegal act that was recognized by only a handful of countries. While Russia solidified its hold on Crimea throughout the spring, small groups of armed men—in fact, Russian troops in uniforms that lacked insignia—took over administrative buildings in the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv.\n\nIt was at this time that the Wagner Group began to take shape. The group’s founding document, dated May 1, 2014, established Utkin as “commander,” responsible for training, recruitment, and discipline, and named Yevgeny Prigozhin as “director,” tasked with securing weapons and funding, as well as shielding personnel from Russian laws that prohibited mercenary work. Prigozhin was an oligarch with a checkered past; he had spent most of the 1980s in prison on charges of burglary and armed robbery. After his release in 1990 Prigozhin opened a chain of hot dog stands in St. Petersburg that he eventually parlayed into a sizable restaurant and catering enterprise. Prigozhin’s restaurants were frequented by the business and political elite of post-Soviet St. Petersburg. At some point during this period Prigozhin established ties with Putin, whose personal power base was located in the city, and Prigozhin benefited from Putin’s rise. In time Prigozhin acquired the nickname “Putin’s chef,” and his access to government catering contracts made him fabulously wealthy.\n\nAmong Prigozhin’s other endeavours was the Internet Research Agency, a “troll farm” that he established in 2013 outside St. Petersburg. The Internet Research Agency promoted conspiracy theories and pro-Putin propaganda on a variety of social media platforms. Its most notable operations were influence campaigns—orchestrated alongside Russian government hacking operations—that sought to affect the outcome of elections in Western countries. Security and intelligence services in Britain and the United States concluded that Internet Research Agency trolls were used to sway the outcome of the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom and the 2016 United States presidential election. These campaigns were deemed to be part of a larger Russian effort to undermine faith in Western democratic institutions. Thus, the Internet Research Agency and the Wagner Group were ostensibly private enterprises operated by Prigozhin, but both acted as agents of Russian foreign and defense policy.\n\nWagner’s first known operations took place during the Russian proxy war in Ukraine’s Donbas region in 2014. Putin implausibly denied that Russian troops were fighting in Ukraine; the official Russian government position was that Ukrainian separatist militias were battling Ukrainian government forces. The use of Wagner fighters allowed the Kremlin to support that narrative. The bodies of dozens of Wagner mercenaries were identified in the aftermath of a battle at Luhansk airport, and it was believed that Wagner was responsible for the downing of a Ukrainian transport plane that killed 49 people on June 14. During the most active phase of the war in the Donbas (2014–15), Ukrainian security services identified nearly 1,600 Wagner mercenaries fighting as Russian proxies.\n\nWagner in Syria and Africa\n\nWar crimes and the scramble for resources\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nAs the war in the Donbas settled into a state of frozen conflict, Wagner’s activities expanded to the Middle East and Africa. Mali, Libya, Sudan, Madagascar, Mozambique, and the Central African Republic were among the countries that hosted Wagner garrisons. The mercenaries acted as bodyguards for government leaders and conducted military operations alongside the regular armies of those countries. Prigozhin also secured valuable mineral contracts for himself and the Kremlin.\n\nIn Sudan Prigozhin’s M-Invest company operated a gold-processing plant, and his Wagner fighters aided Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in their conflict with the military government in Khartoum. Lobaye Invest, a Prigozhin shell company operating in the Central African Republic, was awarded valuable gold and diamond concessions in exchange for supporting the government of Pres. Faustin-Archange Touadéra. In Mali, a UN-appointed investigatory body found that the country’s ruling junta had increased its reliance on Wagner to fill “traditional military functions,” while companies tied to Prigozhin expanded their control of the country’s mineral resources. Virtually everywhere Wagner operated, the United Nations and human rights organizations uncovered evidence of mass killings, torture, rape, and war crimes. In March 2022 government troops and Wagner mercenaries massacred more than 500 people and raped dozens of women and girls in the village of Moura, Mali.\n\nWagner versus the U.S.: the Battle of Conoco Fields\n\nThe Kremlin’s support for Syria dates to the Soviet era, during which Moscow dispatched significant military aid to Syrian Pres. Hafez al-Assad. That relationship continued after Assad’s death in 2000, when he was succeeded as president by his son Bashar al-Assad. When the Arab Spring protests reached Syria in 2011, Assad ordered a bloody crackdown that soon spiraled into a full-scale civil war. In 2015 Russian troops and air crews were deployed to support the Assad regime, and these forces were soon joined by a sizable Wagner contingent. As many as 5,000 Wagner mercenaries were believed to be active in Syria, carrying out attacks on regime opponents and securing oil and gas fields for the Assad government.\n\nOn the night of February 7–8, 2018, a mixed force of Syrian troops and Wagner mercenaries assaulted a position held by Kurdish and American troops at a Conoco gas plant in Khushām, outside Dayr al-Zawr in eastern Syria. The Wagner force comprised some 500 infantry and more than two dozen vehicles, among which were as many as 10 tanks and several armoured fighting vehicles. The American force, numbering perhaps 30, consisted of Delta Force operators and U.S. Army Rangers. About 10:30 pm on February 7, the Wagner-led column unleashed a mixture of artillery, mortar, and tank fire on the American outpost. U.S. commanders contacted the Russian military liaison in Dayr al-Zawr and confirmed that no regular Russian troops were present in the Wagner force. At that point U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis gave the order for the Wagner force “to be annihilated.” A small team of marines and Army Green Berets was dispatched to reinforce the American outpost, but even that addition left the defenders outnumbered more than 10 to 1. While the American ground forces engaged Wagner infantry, waves of U.S. aircraft pounded the armoured vehicles. After four hours, the Wagner force withdrew, having lost as many 300 mercenaries and at least 3 tanks in the attack. The U.S. force did not suffer a single casualty.\n\nWagner in Ukraine and the June 2023 mutiny\n\nIn February 2022 Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Although Russian forces made significant gains in the first days of combat, Ukrainian defenders rebuffed attempts to seize Kyiv and other major cities and were soon launching counterattacks on Russian positions. As the Russian war effort foundered, Putin shuffled commanders and finally outsourced a portion of the fighting to Prigozhin and the Wagner Group. Prigozhin responded by launching a recruiting drive in Russian prisons. From a core of 5,000 professional mercenaries prior to the invasion of Ukraine, the Wagner Group’s ranks swelled to more than 50,000. Prigozhin’s convict army was soon carrying out sanguinary attacks in the Donbas.\n\nThe winter and spring offensives launched by Russia’s regular army went nowhere. Wagner forces intensified their focus on the besieged city of Bakhmut in an effort to deliver some kind of victory for the Kremlin. For months, poorly equipped Wagner convict troops and freshly mobilized Russian army conscripts conducted bloody human wave attacks while trying to encircle Ukrainian forces, but Ukrainian defenses held. In May 2023 the Ukrainians withdrew from the ruins of Bakhmut, and Prigozhin declared victory. It was estimated that Russian casualties in the battle exceeded 100,000, with more than 20,000 killed in action. Still, it was Russia’s first battlefield success in nearly a year, and Prigozhin’s stock rose accordingly.\n\nInfighting between Prigozhin and the Russian military establishment had begun during the siege of Bakhmut, when the Wagner chief accused defense officials of withholding supplies from his mercenaries. Putin, for his part, did little to dampen the feud between Prigozhin and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and armed forces Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov. The clash of personalities reached a dramatic climax in late June when Prigozhin “declared war” on the Russian defense ministry and crossed from Ukraine back into Russia at the head of an armoured column composed of some 25,000 Wagner mercenaries. On June 24 the Wagner force downed more than half a dozen Russian aircraft and proceeded to occupy the Southern Military District headquarters in Rostov-on-Don. While Prigozhin remained in Rostov-on-Don, a column led by Utkin headed north, encountering no meaningful resistance as it passed through Voronezh before it finally halted just 120 miles (roughly 200 km) south of Moscow. Prigozhin then abruptly ordered his men to return to their positions in Ukraine while Belarusian Pres. Alexander Lukashenko announced that he had brokered an agreement between Prigozhin and the Kremlin. In exchange for Wagner halting its mutiny, the mercenaries would be granted amnesty and offered military contracts; Prigozhin would live in exile in Belarus.\n\nPutin’s whereabouts during the rebellion were subject to much speculation. Although his presidential jet was tracked leaving Moscow while Prigozhin was still on the march, a spokesperson insisted that Putin was “working at the Kremlin.” It is beyond dispute, however, that Putin kept an unusually low profile during one of the most tumultuous days in recent Russian history. His public statements, when they finally did come, appeared desperate and contradictory. He excoriated Prigozhin as a traitor, but Putin’s security services made no immediate move to apprehend him. He praised the Wagner fighters as patriots, despite the fact that the mercenaries had killed dozens of Russian service members during their advance on Moscow. Putin also lauded the Russian army for preventing “a civil war,” even though the regular Russian military appeared wholly unequipped to halt the rebellion.\n\nThe fate of Prigozhin and Wagner seemed uncertain in the weeks following the failed mutiny. Russian state media reported that Prigozhin and Putin had met in Moscow in late June and that Putin had offered Wagner commanders “further options for employment and further combat use.” In July thousands of Wagner mercenaries relocated to Belarus, where they established a barracks at Tsel, on the site of a former Belarusian missile base. A video on the social media platform Telegram appeared to show Prigozhin welcoming his fighters to Belarus, but after that post, the Wagner leader kept an unusually low profile. Prigozhin resurfaced in August when he posted a recruitment video, apparently filmed at a Wagner garrison in Africa, stating that Wagner was “making Russia even greater on all continents.” On August 23, just days after the release of that video, Prigozhin’s business jet crashed north of Moscow. Wagner-affiliated social media channels immediately claimed that the aircraft had been downed by Russian air defenses. Both Prigozhin and Utkin were listed on the flight’s passenger list, and Russian authorities confirmed that the dead bodies of both men were among the 10 recovered from the crash site."
