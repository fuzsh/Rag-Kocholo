        "text": "Believe it or not, building a foundation for military learning started on the first day you took the oath of enlistment and boarded that strangely uncomfortable bus to basic training. Since then, you have been exposed to a myriad of formal training and learned many new skills on the job. All these experiences have helped to build the foundation which will assist you succeeding in a post-secondary environment.\n\nMany service members are eligible for college course credit at academic institutions based on knowledge already gained during military service. Through DANTES' Military Training Evaluation Program (MTEP), a service member's learning from military training, education, and occupational experiences is evaluated by the American Council on Education (ACE) and documented on the Joint Services Transcript (JST). Your JST is an official academic record that contains college credit recommendations based on your military experience, academic exam scores (e.g. CLEP, DSST, etc.), and academic courses completed while in the military. Visit the JST website to LOG IN and request an official copy of your military transcript."
