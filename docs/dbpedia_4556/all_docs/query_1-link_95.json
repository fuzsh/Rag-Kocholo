I understand mission first and people always.\n\nI am the past-the spirit of those warriors who have made the final sacrifice.\n\nI am the present-the scholar and apprentice soldier enhancing my skills in the science of warfare and the art of leadership.\n\nBut above all, I am the future-the future warrior leader of the United States Army.\n\nMay God give me the compassion and judgment to lead and the gallantry in battle to win.\n\nI will do my duty."
