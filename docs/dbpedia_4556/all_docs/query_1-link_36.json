        "text": "Below are some of the Career Management Fields. Each of these fields has anywhere from a few to over a dozen possible MOS designations.\n\nMOS 09: Interpreter/Translator\n\no Interprets and translates foreign languages (both spoken & written) into English, and vice versa\n\nMOS 11: The Infantry Branch\n\no These designations make up the main combat force on the ground, tasked with defeating enemy ground troops. Recruits are assigned MOS 11X as enlistees, and are assigned as Infantryman (11B) or Indirect Fire Infantryman (11C) during training.\n\nMOS 12: The Corps of Engineers\n\no Specialists who are adept at building, demolition, and mobility.

Military personnel also have the option to move laterally and switch to other MOS designations to gain additional training and skills in that field. As you can see, while some servicemembers work in occupations specific to the military, many work in occupations that also exist in the civilian workplace, such as administration, maintenance, information technology, logistics, and healthcare. These skills become transferable if they choose to leave the military at the end of their enlistment.\n\nThe other branches of the US military, the Marines, Navy, Coast Guard, and Air Force, each use similar systems to the Army’s, but their designations and jargon vary.\n\nSelecting an MOS\n\nThe main component of choosing an MOS is taking and passing the Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude Battery, or ASVAB. But this is not the only thing to take into consideration when choosing a specialty.\n\nThe ASVAB\n\nThe Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude Battery, or ASVAB is a required test in order to qualify for enlistment into the military. This aptitude test determines which MOS you would be best suited for.\n\nThe ASVAB is comprised of 10 subsections that measure your knowledge in specific areas, which provides an indication of your academic and technical ability. The aptitude areas include general science (GS), arithmetic reasoning (AR), word knowledge (WK), paragraph comprehension (PC), mathematics knowledge (MK), electronics information (EI), auto information (AI), shop information (SI), mechanical comprehension (MC) and assembling objects (AO). The AR, WK, PC and MK sections comprise the Armed Forces Qualification Test, which determines whether or not you can enlist. The rest of the exam determines your qualification for the different career paths within the Army.\n\nIt is highly recommended to study hard for the ASVAB in general, but especially if you’re interested in a particularly sought-after or niche MOS. There are study guides and practice tests available online that can help you get the score you want. When you sign your enlistment contract, you will be able to choose from a list of available MOS designations that you qualify for. Depending on how in-demand a job is, some MOS designations may come with an enlistment bonus!\n\nResearch\n\nIt is also highly recommended to research the different MOS designations outside of test-prep. Your recruiter will be able to give you information on the available MOS designations that you qualify for or connect you with recruiters from that specific branch. You can also ask about job shadowing, which will give you an opportunity to see firsthand how the job functions on a day-to-day basis. While job shadowing is not available for all MOS designations, your recruiter can also connect you to someone in that particular role via phone or email. This will allow you to ask specific questions that your recruiter might not be able to answer and figure out which jobs are right for you.\n\nAnother thing to consider in your research is transferable skills. While this does require a lot of forethought, it’s a good idea to consider what jobs within the military have skills that are transferable to civilian life. Many MOS designations prepare you for non-military careers in the same field and will make transitioning back to civilian life after enlistment much easier."
