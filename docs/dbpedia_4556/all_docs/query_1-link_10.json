Others are purposely generalized.\n\nMoreover, while every MOS has a military function, not every occupation is military-specific. MOS designations can include civilian workplace equivalents, such as administration, engineering, construction, information technology, communications, logistics, maintenance, healthcare, and so on\n\nHow Are Military Occupational Specialty Lists Used?\n\nMOS lists are used to define and detail jobs/specialties in the armed forces. Specialties that are similar or related are gathered into branches and categorized within various Career Management Fields. Each job is given a unique designation; related specialties within a category get the same two numbers, followed by a letter assigned to a particular specialty.\n\nTraining for each job is as specialized as the specialty itself. Opportunities for advancement are available in each, as are opportunities to move laterally, change to other MOS ratings, and expand skills through training.\n\nArmy MOS List\n\nThe U.S. Army lists roughly 160 MOS designations available to enlistees, from frontline warriors (infantrymen, field artillery soldiers, combat engineers) to aviators and aviation support (including piloting unmanned drones) to special forces and armor to civil affairs (communications, planning, agency coordinators) to chaplains’ assistants, interpreter/translators, and mechanics and beyond.\n\nCheck it out:\n\nInterpreter/Translator (MOS 09L) provides interpreting and translating of foreign languages — spoken and written — into English, and vice versa.\n\nThe Infantry Branch comprises the main combat force on the ground.
