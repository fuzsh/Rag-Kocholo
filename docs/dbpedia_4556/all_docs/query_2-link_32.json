        "text": "For years, it was shrouded in secrecy, then infamy, and after claims of a \"rebellion\" in Russia in June, questions about the notorious Wagner Group and the intentions of its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin — who Russian officials said was killed in an airplane crash Aug. 24 — were swirling.\n\nThe group has been a key piece of Russia's strategy in Ukraine, with Wagner forces being used to hold cities like Bakhmut. Prigozhin had sharply criticized Russian military leaders for weeks before the rebellion calling the top brass incompetent, even traitorous.\n\nTension between Russia's defense ministry and Wagner escalated dramatically when Prigozhin alleged that Russian forces had attacked Wagner camps in eastern Ukraine, killing dozens of his men. Prigozhin issued video taped remarks that appeared to call for a rebellion against Russian military leadership, but he was characteristically vague in defining his plans.\n\nPrigozhin's Wagner forces left Ukraine and marched into Russia on June 23 seizing control of the Russian military headquarters for the southern region in Rostov-on-Don, which oversees the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nWagner boss, \"Putin's butcher,\" says Russia at risk of facing \"revolution\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin called the uprising \"a stab in the back\" in a televised address in June 2023.\n\n\"All those who prepared the rebellion will suffer inevitable punishment,\" Putin said. \"The armed forces and other government agencies have received the necessary orders.\"\n\nOn Aug. 22, Prigozhin appeared in his first video since leading the failed mutiny against Russian commanders in June. He appeared to be somewhere in Africa, where the Wagner Group has been active. Standing in arid desert land and dressed in camouflage with a rifle in his hand, he said in the video that Wagner was making Russia great on all continents and making Africa \"more free.\" CBS News has not verified Prigozhin's location or when the video was taken.\n\nOn Wednesday, Aug. 23, Prigozhin was listed as a passenger on a plane that crashed in Russia, killing 10 people, authorities said. However, officials had yet to officially confirm the identities of the passengers.\n\nWhat is the Wagner Group?\n\nWagner is actually a group of entities that operate as a private military company, or PMC. These PMCs can be hired by governments for security or combat services.\n\nThey aren't uncommon: The United States has used private military companies during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, there are differences between the commonly accepted definition of a PMC and Russia's version of the companies.\n\n\"In NATO countries, in Western countries, the main logic behind using private contractors when it comes to security and defense policy has been the flexibility of resources,\" said Dr. András Rácz, a Russian expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations. \"However, on the Russian side, the logic has been different. Russia, from the beginning, perceived these companies as a way of exerting state power in a covert way.\"\n\nWho is Yevgeny Prigozhin?\n\nAs Wagner's publicity has grown, so has that of its shadowy founder, Prigozhin. His work running a catering company with Kremlin contracts earned him the nickname \"Putin's chef,\" but Prigozhin long denied any connection to the group before finally admitting to being its founder last year.\n\n\"Prigozhin is a mastermind of media and also is the mastermind of social media,\" said Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, a public policy research based in Washington, D.C. \"While Putin and his propagandists have been dominating the Russian television and traditional outlets, Prigozhin is innovative because he had weaponized a network of military correspondents, military correspondents and bloggers.\"\n\nPrigozhin is wanted by the FBI for \"Conspiracy to Defraud the United States.\" The federal law enforcement agency is offering a $250,000 award for information leading to Prigozhin's arrest for allegedly overseeing the political and electoral interference of the St. Petersburg, Florida-based Internet Research Agency from 2014 to 2018. The agency, for which Prigozhin was the primary funder, worked to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the FBI alleged.\n\nPrigozhin openly and increasingly criticized Russia's top military commanders as the country failed to make significant gains in Ukraine. Meanwhile, he has positioned himself as a hero.\n\n\"He knows that his key differentiator from the Kremlin propaganda is that level of criticism, level of honesty, you know, that things are not really going as well, and criticism sells,\" Stepanenko said. \"And I think that that's the platform that he's really trying to advance on and solidify himself as a prominent figure in Russia.\"\n\nSeemingly squaring off against Putin in the brief weekend \"rebellion\" and being subsequently banished to Belarus stoked rumors he would be assassinated. His purported death on Aug. 23 fueled speculation of retaliation by the Russian president.\n\n\"People keep saying that he's marked for assassination,\" Jeff Hawn, a Russia expert at the London School of Economics, told CBS News in June, as the Kremlin tried to show it was business as usual after the chaotic weekend.\n\n\"There's a very good chance,\" said Hawn, adding that if there was an attempt on Prigozhin's life, \"I don't think it might come from the Kremlin. I think it might come from the Ministry of Defense, because he embarrassed them hugely. But then again, he's been marked for assassination since the nineties.\"\n\nThere have been no official statements from Russia on the cause of the crash, but one U.S. official told CBS News the plane was likely brought down by an onboard explosion and not shot down by a surface-to-air missile.\n\nWhere else has Wagner worked and how does it make money?\n\nWagner first popped up in Ukraine in 2014, when soldiers in unmarked uniforms appeared to help pro-Russian forces illegally annex territory for Russia. Before that the group is believed to have been involved in supporting Russian forces in Syria.\n\nIn 2022, the private army became a major part of Russia's invasion, even recruiting fighters from Russian prisons and promising them pardons to beef up numbers on the battlefield, though Prigozhin said in February that the practice would be stopped.\n\nIn addition to deploying Wagner troops to Ukraine, the Wagner Group has been active in Africa, where some nations have turned to the private army to fill security gaps or prop up dictatorial regimes.\n\n\"In most cases, they provide training for local military forces, local security forces, but they are also engaged in VIP protection, also in guarding. And if necessary, they are able to conduct also high intensity operations, I mean real combat,\" said Rácz.\n\nWagner Group accused of using rape and murder to control African mining town\n\nIn some countries, like the Central African Republic, Wagner exchanges services for almost unfettered access to natural resources. A CBS News investigation found that Russian cargo flights stopped in the country twice a week, possibly smuggling billions of dollars worth of gold back to Russia.\n\nIn addition to gold, CBS News also found Wagner was involved in illegal timber harvesting in CAR, another lucrative source of income.\n\nPutin said on June 27, just after the failed Wagner uprising, that the Russian government had paid more than $1 billion to the Wagner Group during over the last year.\n\n\"The state paid to the Wagner group 86.262 billion rubles (around $1 billion) for salaries for fighters and incentive rewards between May 2022 and May 2023 alone,\" the Russian president said in a televised meeting with law enforcement officials.\n\nWagner Group charged with war crimes\n\nAs the operations of the once-shadowy group have become more public, so have their tactics.\n\nWagner mercenaries have been accused of atrocities, including mass murder and rape, across Africa and alongside Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\nIn Ukraine, fighters have been charged with thousands of war crimes. When previously asked for comment, the Wagner Group dismissed questions from CBS News as boorish and provocative, and insisted the company did not commit these crimes.\n\nIn addition to their actions on the battlefield, military experts say Wagner recruits have been poorly equipped or even used as cannon fodder. U.S. officials estimate that about 30,000 Wagner fighters have been killed or wounded so far in Ukraine, all while Russia's advance has stalled or been pushed back, raising questions about the future of the group, and its leader, Prigozhin.\n\nExperts said it's possible the group could be replaced by Putin.\n\n\"I think that Wagner, insofar as it's been useful in Ukraine, could certainly be replaced by others. Where you start to have much more of an issue in replacing Wagner and in replacing Prigozhin is in a place like sub-Saharan Africa,\" said Catrina Doxsee, an associate director and associate fellow for the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"As the U.S. and other Western countries, including in Europe, try to dislodge Russia's influence and try to make the argument against Wagner, there really needs to be this conversation about viable alternatives,\" for countries in the developing world to meet their security and development needs.\n\nWhere does the Wagner Group's name come from?\n\nThe group's name appears to come from a man credited with co-founding it, Dmitry Utkin, a former officer in Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU. Utkin retired from the Russian security services but went on to serve as a senior military command for the Wagner Group, a role he's believed to still hold.\n\nA nationalist with Nazi sympathies, Utkin's callsign in the Russian services was said to have been \"Wagner\" — a nod to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's love for the 19th-century German composer of the same name. Utkin was also reportedly killed in the Aug. 23 crash.\n\nReporting contributed by Andy Triay, Debora Patta and Cara Tabachnick"
