        "text": "DOD finds its canine recruits from elite breeders around the world, but a select group - about 13% - are born and bred into the U.S. military, through the DOD Military Working Dog Breeding Program, aka the Puppy Program. These puppies come from one place: the 341st Training Squadron at Joint Base San Antonio. About 50 to 90 puppies are born into the program every year.\n\nAt six to eight weeks old, the puppies go live with foster families for about six months to get the kind of socialization beneficial for all puppies. Most of the families live in the San Antonio area, and the squadron still works with the puppies at least once a month in this time to develop their basic hunting instincts and stability in different environments.\n\nWhen they leave their foster families, the pups enter an intensive training phase on base. They practice basic obedience and bite work. They learn to release things when told, recognize odors and respond to them with a specific behavior, like sitting. Trainers also expose the dogs to situations and environments they may encounter on an installation or in a combat zone.\n\nBiting into the Mission\n\nDogs like Benny, at the Air Force's 673rd Security Forces Squadron, have a couple of weeks to build rapport with their handlers when they arrive from San Antonio, and then it's training, training, training. Benny's handler explains what they do, why they do it and what it's like to have a coworker who chomps on his arm on a regular basis.\n\nFlying High\n\nJust as dogs need training in their specific job skills, like sniffing out bombs or catching bad guys, they also need training to get used to the sounds, sights and sensations they could encounter at work. For Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class James Grant, that means getting his partner, Sonya, used to the wind, noise and motion of being hoisted into a helicopter high above the ground.\n\nDogged Devotion to K-9 Care\n\nThe jobs that military working dogs do are both risky and physically demanding. Training keeps them in tip-top shape, but the military also makes sure they have state-of-the-art medical care when they need it. The Lt. Col. Daniel E. Holland Military Working Dog Hospital in San Antonio is the Defense Department's premier veterinary hospital, serving all military working dogs globally.\n\nBest in Show\n\nWith any job, there are primary responsibilities and the extra stuff you get asked to do from time to time. If a VIP is visiting your workplace, for instance, you might have to help out with the dog and pony show. And so do dogs - just without the ponies.\n\nDuring the Civil War, troops marching off to battle brought dogs along as unit mascots and companions. Among the most famous was Sallie, the mascot of the 11th Pennsylvania Infantry. She was with the unit from puppyhood, licking the wounds of her human comrades and lifting their spirits.\n\nTwo months before the war's end, she died of a bullet wound on the front line. Years later, the 11th Pennsylvania Regimental Association built a statue in her honor at Gettysburg National Military Park.\n\nStubby was a stray, smuggled to Europe by a soldier with the 102nd Infantry Regiment during World War I. He charmed troops by learning bugle calls and how to salute with his right paw.\n\nBut he contributed in more important ways too: He alerted soldiers to gas attacks and even captured a German spy dressed as a U.S. soldier, ultimately serving in 17 battles.\n\nHis heroics earned him the distinction of being the first dog to receive a rank – sergeant – from the U.S. armed forces, according to the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nNot all military working dogs in recent history have fancy pedigrees. One heroic pooch from Operation Iraqi Freedom, Gabe, was a pound puppy before he was adopted and trained for military service.\n\nJust weeks after completing training in 2006 with his handler, Army Staff Sgt. Chuck Shuck, the two deployed to Iraq, where Gabe sniffed out insurgent explosives, ammunition and other weapons.\n\nHe was exceptionally productive, racking up 26 finds during his 170 combat patrols. Gabe returned home laden with accolades, and Shuck adopted him when he retired.\n\nEven then, Gabe worked on behalf of the nation, visiting with kids and wounded soldiers in hospitals. The American Humane organization named him its Hero Dog of 2012, a distinction that came with $15,000 for the charity of his choice, the U.S. War Dogs Association.\n\nA Marine Corps explosives detection dog, Lucca served deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan during her six-year career, leading nearly 400 patrols and identifying about 40 improvised explosive devices.\n\nNot a single Marine was injured while following the half German shepherd, half Belgian Malinois. But on March 23, 2012, Lucca was, while leading a patrol in Afghanistan with her handler.\n\nShortly after she found an IED, another device detonated, badly injuring Lucca. Her handler applied a tourniquet and she was quickly medevaced for advanced treatment. She survived, but she lost her left front leg.\n\nLucca was medically retired, but quickly adjusted to life with three limbs and a new home with her original handler. In 2016, she became the first U.S. military working dog to receive the Dickin Medal for animal valor.\n\nA German shepherd-collie-husky mix, Chips served overseas during World War II as one of the members of the military's newly formed K-9 Corps.\n\nDuring the invasion of Sicily in 1943, Chips attacked an enemy machine gun team firing at soldiers in his platoon. He got a scalp wound and powder burns, but was credited with saving the lives of his human teammates.\n\nSome 75 years later, Chips received a posthumous Dickin Medal, a prestigious international award for valor in animal warriors."
