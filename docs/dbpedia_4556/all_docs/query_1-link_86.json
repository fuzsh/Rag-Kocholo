        "text": "Who wants to be a Ranger?\n\nApplications are being accepted for potential selection and assignment to the 75th Ranger Regiment — one of the Army's most diverse and demanding units.\n\nThe rigorous training and assessment program is open to active-duty soldiers, male and female, in the ranks of private through master sergeant, warrant officer 1 through chief warrant officer 4, and second lieutenant through major.\n\nSeparate procedures are used to select and assess field-grade officers.\n\nThe regiment, headquartered at Fort Benning, Georgia, has been a males-only unit since its activation during World War II. However, with the recent opening of all specialties to women, to include the combat arms, the males-only restriction has been lifted for the 75th, just as it has for Special Forces.\n\nThe 75th Regiment is one of the most diverse units in the Army, with personnel requirements in more than 110 officer and enlisted combat arms, combat support and combat service support specialties. (Scroll down for full list.)\n\nApplication requirements are listed below. Waivers will be considered on a case-by-case basis, according to Army personnel officials.\n\nThe 75th Ranger Regiment includes more than 110 officer and enlisted combat arms, combat support and combat service support specialties.\n\nPhoto Credit: SPC Justin English/Army\n\nBasic requirements:\n\n• Be on active duty, volunteer for an assignment and be a U. S. citizen.\n\n• Enlisted soldiers must have a GT (General Technical) score of 105, or higher, on the Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude Battery, while officers must be a graduate of a commissioned officer or warrant officer branch-specific Basic Officer Leader Course.\n\n• Be capable of passing initial entry physical requirements, to include the Ranger Fitness Test (58 push-ups, a five-mile run in 40 minutes or less and six chin-ups); a water survival assessment test, and a 12-mile foot march with a 35-pound rucksack and weapon in less than three hours.\n\n• Must be airborne-qualified or volunteer to attend airborne training.\n\n• Do not have any drug- or alcohol-related incidents within the last 24 months, and do not have any Uniform Code of Military Justice actions pending.\n\n• Enlisted soldiers must be eligible for a secret security clearance, with possible upgrade to top secret. Officers must be eligible for a top secret clearance.\n\n• Women soldiers must have a negative pregnancy test within 30 days before their Ranger Assessment and Selection Program report date.\n\nCandidate applications will be screened and reviewed by leaders within the 75th Ranger Regiment, a process that can take as long eight to 12 weeks before a final decision is rendered.\n\nRanger School opened to women for the first time last year for a series of pilot tests. Today the school is open to both men and women.\n\nPhoto Credit: Pfc. Antonio Lewis/Army\n\nApplicants who pass the unit screening will be invited to attend the Ranger Assessment and Selection program, which is conducted at Fort Benning.\n\nRASP 1 is about eight weeks long, and is required for enlisted soldiers in the ranks of private through sergeant. RASP 2 is about three weeks long, and is required for applicants in the ranks of staff sergeant through major.\n\nUpon successful completion of RASP, candidates will be assigned to the 75th Ranger Regiment, which has four battalions, two at Fort Benning, another at Hunter Army Airfield, Ga., and a fourth at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash.\n\nOfficers who have questions about the program, or who want to submit an application, should send email correspondence to 75officerrecruit@soc.mil.\n\nEnlisted soldiers should submit correspondence to 75recruit@soc.mil.\n\nApplicants who pass an initial screening will receive specific instructions on submitting additional documents, which may include a one-page letter of intent addressed to the regimental commander, letters of recommendation from the applicants current rater and senior rater, a recent (within six months) DA Form 705 (PT test scorecard), and a leader validation memo, pre-screening questionnaire and a DA Form 4187 reassignment request.\n\nFor additional application details, soldiers should consult MilPer Message 16-097, dated April 5.\n\nEnlisted and officer specialties required in the 75th Ranger Regiment are:\n\nEnlisted
