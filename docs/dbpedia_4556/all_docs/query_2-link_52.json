        "text": "A private military company with suspected links to the Kremlin is understood to be prepared to \"send large numbers of personnel\" into Ukraine to fight alongside Russian troops, the head of GCHQ has said.\n\nSir Jeremy Fleming said Wagner group mercenaries are likely to be used as \"cannon fodder\" to try to limit Russian military losses.\n\nThe Ukrainian military previously said there had been clashes near Kyiv with members of Liga, formerly known as the Wagner Group.\n\nThe MoD has said Russia is expected to deploy more than a thousand mercenaries, including senior leaders of the Wagner Group, to undertake combat operations in Ukraine.\n\nLive updates from Ukraine war\n\nSky News looks at the Wagner Group and why its contractors are believed to be in Ukraine.\n\nWhat is the Wagner Group?\n\nThe Wagner Group is a Russian mercenary organisation.\n\nSorcha MacLeod, who heads the UN's working group on the use of mercenaries, told the Economist that from a legal perspective, Wagner does not exist.\n\nIt is a network of companies and groups rather than a single entity.\n\nThe group is believed to be funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close links to Vladimir Putin who is also alleged to run Russia's \"troll farm\", the Internet Research Agency.\n\nMr Prigozhin is one of the many oligarchs recently sanctioned by the West in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHe has always denied any connection with Wagner.\n\nRead more: What are cluster and vacuum bombs - and do they break international law?\n\nThe European Union said Wagner was founded by Dmitry Utkin - a former Russian soldier reportedly adorned with Nazi tattoos.\n\nIt is said to have been named after Richard Wagner, Hitler's favourite composer.\n\nThe Wagner Group is privately owned but its management and operations are \"deeply intertwined\" with the Russian military and intelligence community, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), an American think tank.\n\nThe Russian armed forces reportedly provide the group with munitions and transport aircraft, and the head of Ukraine's security services has described it as a \"private army of Putin\".\n\nThe company has at least 6,000 employees and is said to be registered in Argentina, with offices in Saint Petersburg and Hong Kong.\n\nValery Zakharov, a former member of the Russian state security service, is \"a key figure in the Wagner Group's command structure and keeps close links with the Russian authorities\", according to the EU.\n\nThe Russian government denies any involvement with the group and insists it does not legally exist because private military contractors are not legal in Russia.\n\nWhy is the Wagner Group in Ukraine?\n\nThe Wagner Group is said to be used by the Russian government in conflicts where plausible deniability is required.\n\nThe use of these mercenaries - described as \"ghost soldiers\" - also allows Russia more secrecy about its military operations abroad and the number of losses.\n\nSome believe that the organisation does not actually exist as a private company but is in reality a hidden branch of the Russian Ministry of Defence that reports to the Russian government.\n\nPrivate security companies and private military companies are essentially \"freelance soldiers\" who can be hired cheaply and are more efficient than a regular military force because a small number of them can be deployed for a targeted operation, according to CSIS.\n\nRead more: First Lady Olena Zelenska condemns 'mass murder of Ukrainian civilians'\n\nWhat is the Wagner Group doing in Ukraine?\n\nFor years Ukraine has accused Wagner of fighting in Luhansk and Donetsk, the disputed parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nRecently, the Ukrainian military confirmed there had been clashes near Kyiv with members of the private military company Liga, formerly known as Wagner.\n\nMore than 400 mercenaries belonging to the group were sent to Kyiv to assassinate Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, according to a report in The Times.\n\nThe Ukrainian government reportedly received information about this early on 26 February, after which it declared a 36-hour \"hard\" curfew to sweep the capital for \"Russian saboteurs\".\n\nBy 3 March, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy had survived three assassination attempts - two of them allegedly orchestrated by the Wagner Group, The Times reported.\n\nOn 8 March, the Ukrainian military claimed it had killed the first Wagner contractors since the start of the invasion.\n\nIn late March, UK defence intelligence and US officials said Wagner has about 1,000 personnel in Donbas and eastern Ukraine.\n\nRead more: West has 'serious concern' Putin could unleash chemical weapons on Kyiv\n\nWhat has the Wagner Group previously been accused of doing?\n\nWagner has been accused of war crimes in areas where it has been deployed.\n\nLast year, the EU imposed sanctions on three people and three entities from the group in relation to human rights abuses in the Central African Republic.\n\n\"Wagner Group has recruited, trained and sent private military operatives to conflict zones around the world to fuel violence, loot natural resources and intimidate civilians in violation of international law, including international human rights law,\" the EU stated.\n\nSubscribe to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\n\nIt accused the group of torture, arbitrary executions and killings, and \"destabilising activities\" in regions like Donbas in Ukraine.\n\nWagner was believed to have been active in the 2014 annexation of Crimea, conducting sneak attacks, reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering.\n\nSky News previously spoke to a group of young Russian men who claimed they were recruited by Wagner and flown on Russian military planes to assist troops loyal to Bashar al Assad in Syria.\n\nRussia had claimed its campaign in Syria was only an aerial operation with a limited number of \"instructors and advisers\" - but these recruits said this was not the case.\n\nIn Sudan, the EU said Wagner mercenaries are thought to have been involved in training as well as the protection of officials and mining sites.\n\nIn Mozambique, Wagner has helped the army in its fight against the Islamist militant insurgency in the north.\n\nCSIS has said that Wagner Group troops have also now deployed to Mali with the support of the Russian armed forces to tackle instability in the Sahel."
