        "text": "NASA Recognizes Veterans’ Preference and Special Hiring Authorities\n\nMany of the iconic figures at the agency–our astronauts–were former members of the armed services, including Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, John Glenn, Alan Shepard, Jim Lovell, Jr and Guion Bluford.\n\nHowever, veterans are not only found in the astronaut corps.\n\nAcross the agency, veterans deliver subject matter expertise, years of on-the-job training, and advanced skills in everything from information technology to transportation logistics and from supply-chain management to public relations. In addition, there are many opportunities for veterans and military spouses available such as in:\n\nAerospace and Aviation\n\nElectronics Engineering\n\nProgram Management\n\nCyber Security\n\nSecurity Administration\n\nIf you’re a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces and were separated under honorable conditions, you may be eligible for special hiring authorities for veterans’ preference, as well as other veteran specific hiring options.\n\nVeterans Preference\n\nThis term refers to individuals, who, as a result of military service or as a result of their connection to someone with military service, are entitled to special preference in the Federal Hiring process. This includes disabled veterans, spouses of disabled veterans, widows/widowers of deceased veterans, and parents of deceased veterans. If you are 10-point preference eligible, you may apply for employment consideration event if there are currently no open announcements for positions in which you are interested.\n\nTo check for eligibility or learn more about veterans’ preference visit USAJOBS page on veterans or the veterans’ preference page on fedshirevets.org. View this one-pager for more information on 10 Point Preference Eligibles.\n\nFedsHireVets.gov provides detailed information to veterans, transitioning service members and their families, including veterans’ preference eligibility, special veteran appointing authorities, and other veteran related topics. For more information on special hiring authorities for military spouses please go to USAJOBS – Military Spouses.\n\nVeterans’ Hiring Authorities\n\nIf you’re a veteran, you may also be eligible for one of these special hiring authorities:\n\n30% or More Disabled Veteran: An authority that allows an agency to non-competitively appoint any veteran with a 30% more service-connected disability to a temporary or term appointment.\n\nSupporting Documentation: Upon request, you will be required to submit proof of veterans preference to include DD-214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty), Standard Form (SF-15) and proof required by SF-15.

If you are interested in a vacancy announcement this is currently open, we encourage you to apply directly to the announcement on USAJOBS. If you are a 10-point veteran, you will be given preference in hiring in according with applicable federal policies.\n\nIf you are a 10-point veteran and wish to submit a late or unsolicited application, please submit an online inquiry to the NASA Shared Service Center Customer Contact Center. Please specify the Category as “Human Resources”, the Area as “Inquiry” and in the Description include that you are requesting to apply as a 10-point later filer and list the specific vacancy announcement for which you would like to be considered, if applicable.\n\nFor more information, visit https://www.fedshirevets.gov/job-seekers/veterans/veterans-preference.\n\nVeterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA): An excepted authority that allows an agency to non-competitively appoint an eligible veteran to a two-year appointment at the GS-11 level or below. VRA eligibles may apply to merit promotion job announcements (those open to federal employees), if the job announcement is open to individuals outside that agency.\n\nVeterans Employment Opportunity Act (VEOA): A competitive appointing authority that allows eligible individuals to apply to merit promotion job announcements (those open to federal employees), if the job announcement is open to individuals outside that agency.\n\nFor more information, visit https://www.fedshirevets.gov/job-seekers/veterans/special-hiring-authorities.\n\nCertain Military Spouses\n\nA non-competitive appointment of certain military spouses to a competitive service position.\n\nEligibility\n\nActive Duty Spouse: Spouse of a member of the armed forces on active duty.\n\nSpouse of a 100% Disabled Veteran: Spouse of a military member who was retired under Chapter 61 of title 10 U.S.C. with a 100% disability rating from the military; or was released from active duty with a disability rating of 100% from the Department of Veterans Affairs or a military branch.\n\nWidow/Widower: Un-remarried widow/widower of a service member deceased while on active duty (does not have to combat-related).\n\nSupporting Documentation\n\nMarriage certificate and your spouse’s military documentation that shows you meet one of the above criteria.\n\nFAQs\n\nDoes Military Rank and Grade Qualify Me for a Specific Federal Pay Grade or Level?\n\nEmployee Resource Groups for Veterans and Military Spouses\n\nNASA employees can join one of many Employee Resource Groups which support development activities and positive team dynamics.
