        "text": "Soldiers have one job: to protect their country. However, there are many different ways to do this. If the country is at war, many soldiers fight in combat. They use weapons and technology to help defeat the enemy. During peacetime, soldiers are alert to any danger or threat to their country. In addition to training for combat, each branch of the armed forces offers training for hundreds of different job opportunities. These jobs can be in such fields as engineering, medicine, computers, or finance.\n\nThere are different levels, or ranks, of soldiers. A soldier rises through the ranks with experience and training. Soldiers who enlist in the military without a college education enter as privates. There are requirements in order to become a private. For instance, soldiers must be at least 18 years old, have a high school diploma, and be in good physical shape. (Soldiers younger than 18 must have their parents’ permission to join.) They then go to basic training where they are prepared for a life in the military. Basic training teaches new soldiers physical strength, mental discipline, self-confidence, loyalty, and the ability to follow orders. The U.S. armed forces require 7–13 weeks of basic training.\n\nOfficers in the military must have a college education. Many officers in the U.S. military come from a program called the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). Students participate in ROTC while they are in college. After graduation, they become officers and go to a specialized training school. Officers can also be trained at military academies. Each branch of the armed forces has a military academy.\n\nIn Canada the army, navy, and air force merged into a single fighting team—the Canadian Armed Forces—in 1968. The basic training for enlisted soldiers lasts 12 weeks."
