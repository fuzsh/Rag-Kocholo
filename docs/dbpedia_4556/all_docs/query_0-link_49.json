        "text": "I’ve learned over the years how important it is to hire missionaries and to avoid hiring mercenaries. In this post, I’m going to share some tips how to spot where a candidate falls on the missionary – mercenary spectrum.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, one definition of a missionary is someone who is “very enthusiastic and eager about doing a job or supporting a cause.” The missionary is fully invested into the company’s ultimate mission and culture, and has chosen to work there for more than purely financial or status reasons. Missionaries typically don’t leave because another company offered slightly more pay or a better title.\n\nOn the other hand, a mercenary isn’t committed to the company’s mission, but rather took the job largely for more compensation, a better title, or the cachet of a better employer brand. Merriam-Webster defines a mercenary as \"a soldier who will fight for any group or country that hires him.\"\n\nBefore we get to the tips on how to identify missionaries, it’s worth highlighting why it is so important to hire them. There is considerable research that shows companies with strong missions and cultures outperform companies that are driven primarily by purely financial returns. Companies like Southwest Airlines, Zappos, and Google are great examples of mission driven companies who have thrived over time and are consistently ranked as top places to work.\n\nThree tips to identify missionaries and mercenaries:\n\n1. Watch out for a Strong Pattern of Job Hopping Behavior\n\nIn today’s ever changing economy, lifetime employment is no longer a reality in most markets and we therefore switch jobs frequently during our careers. In a recent study, The US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that Americans held approximately 11 jobs during their career. So we shouldn't be surprised that even missionaries will switch jobs frequently during their careers and may leave within months of a new job if he/she quickly determines it was the wrong company, role, or manager.\n\nHowever, if there is a pattern of very short job stints, that could be a signal of a job hopper (or other issues). Each one could be explained but if you see three out of four jobs that lasted less than 1 or 2 years, I think your antennae needs to go up that you may have a mercenary on your hands. One helpful interview question is to ask the candidate if he/she had any full time jobs that are not listed on their CV or LinkedIn profile, even if it was only for a few months.\n\n2. Don’t Pay the Absolute Highest Dollar to Smoke out the Mercenaries\n\nThe best talent in the world should be paid highly competitive compensation. But I don’t necessarily believe in offering the absolute highest pay because that may attract mercenaries who join your company because you pay them 5% or 10% more, and then are prone to leave for the next company who offers more than you do. I think the sweet spot is to pay in the highest quartile and then provide additional value in things like a highly desirable culture, a heavy investment in career development, and other benefits that clearly send a signal you value and appreciate your employees.\n\nIt’s a tough call, but if a highly desirable candidate is considering another offer for slightly more money, than in many cases, I would advise to not match exactly dollar for dollar as it suggests that candidate doesn’t attribute much value to your mission, your culture, and the other unique things your company offers.\n\n3. Dig Deep into Mission Building Activities\n\nDuring the interview, ask the candidate about their current company’s mission and why did they choose to work there. You’d be surprised how many candidates can’t articulate their current company’s mission or have little enthusiasm when you probe deeper into what the mission means to them. I also like to ask what they are passionate about and look for examples where they started an initiative or volunteered to work on projects that were outside of their immediate scope of work.\n\nIt’s not just important to hire missionaries for the company. It’s also important on a personal level. If your team is full of Missionaries, I think you’re far more likely to want to jump out of bed in the morning and get to the office. I know I am!\n\nDo you have other ways to help determine whether a candidate is a missionary or mercenary? Please share your thoughts below."
