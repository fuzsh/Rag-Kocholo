        "text": "Overview\n\nA Job Zone is a group of occupations that are similar in:\n\nhow much education people need to do the work,\n\nhow much related experience people need to do the work, and\n\nhow much on-the-job training people need to do the work.\n\nThe five Job Zones are:\n\nJob Zone 1 - occupations that need little or no preparation\n\nJob Zone 2 - occupations that need some preparation\n\nJob Zone 3 - occupations that need medium preparation\n\nJob Zone 4 - occupations that need considerable preparation\n\nJob Zone 5 - occupations that need extensive preparation\n\nJob Zone One: Little or No Preparation Needed\n\nEducation\n\nSome of these occupations may require a high school diploma or GED certificate.\n\nRelated Experience\n\nLittle or no previous work-related skill, knowledge, or experience is needed for these occupations. For example, a person can become a waiter or waitress even if he/she has never worked before.\n\nJob Training\n\nEmployees in these occupations need anywhere from a few days to a few months of training. Usually, an experienced worker could show you how to do the job.\n\nJob Zone Examples\n\nThese occupations involve following instructions and helping others. Examples include food preparation workers, dishwashers, floor sanders and finishers, landscaping and groundskeeping workers, logging equipment operators, and baristas.\n\nSVP Range\n\n(Below 4.0)\n\nJob Zone Two: Some Preparation Needed\n\nEducation\n\nThese occupations usually require a high school diploma.\n\nRelated Experience\n\nSome previous work-related skill, knowledge, or experience is usually needed. For example, a teller would benefit from experience working directly with the public.\n\nJob Training\n\nEmployees in these occupations need anywhere from a few months to one year of working with experienced employees. A recognized apprenticeship program may be associated with these occupations.\n\nJob Zone Examples\n\nThese occupations often involve using your knowledge and skills to help others. Examples include orderlies, counter and rental clerks, customer service representatives, security guards, upholsterers, tellers, and dental laboratory technicians.\n\nSVP Range\n\n(4.0 to < 6.0)\n\nJob Zone Three: Medium Preparation Needed\n\nEducation\n\nMost occupations in this zone require training in vocational schools, related on-the-job experience, or an associate's degree.\n\nRelated Experience\n\nPrevious work-related skill, knowledge, or experience is required for these occupations. For example, an electrician must have completed three or four years of apprenticeship or several years of vocational training, and often must have passed a licensing exam, in order to perform the job.\n\nJob Training\n\nEmployees in these occupations usually need one or two years of training involving both on-the-job experience and informal training with experienced workers. A recognized apprenticeship program may be associated with these occupations.\n\nJob Zone Examples\n\nThese occupations usually involve using communication and organizational skills to coordinate, supervise, manage, or train others to accomplish goals. Examples include hydroelectric production managers, desktop publishers, electricians, agricultural technicians, barbers, court reporters and simultaneous captioners, and medical assistants.\n\nSVP Range\n\n(6.0 to < 7.0)\n\nJob Zone Four: Considerable Preparation Needed\n\nEducation\n\nMost of these occupations require a four-year bachelor's degree, but some do not.\n\nRelated Experience\n\nA considerable amount of work-related skill, knowledge, or experience is needed for these occupations. For example, an accountant must complete four years of college and work for several years in accounting to be considered qualified.\n\nJob Training\n\nEmployees in these occupations usually need several years of work-related experience, on-the-job training, and/or vocational training.\n\nJob Zone Examples\n\nMany of these occupations involve coordinating, supervising, managing, or training others. Examples include real estate brokers, sales managers, database administrators, graphic designers, conservation scientists, art directors, and cost estimators.\n\nSVP Range\n\n(7.0 to < 8.0)\n\nJob Zone Five: Extensive Preparation Needed\n\nEducation\n\nMost of these occupations require graduate school. For example, they may require a master's degree, and some require a Ph.D., M.D., or J.D. (law degree).\n\nRelated Experience\n\nExtensive skill, knowledge, and experience are needed for these occupations. Many require more than five years of experience. For example, surgeons must complete four years of college and an additional five to seven years of specialized medical training to be able to do their job.\n\nJob Training\n\nEmployees may need some on-the-job training, but most of these occupations assume that the person will already have the required skills, knowledge, work-related experience, and/or training.\n\nJob Zone Examples\n\nThese occupations often involve coordinating, training, supervising, or managing the activities of others to accomplish goals. Very advanced communication and organizational skills are required. Examples include pharmacists, lawyers, astronomers, biologists, clergy, physician assistants, and veterinarians.\n\nSVP Range\n\n(8.0 and above)"
