        "text": "Much like the wide range of jobs found in the civilian working world, the Military offers hundreds of rewarding opportunities across many different career fields. Visit Explore Careers to discover opportunities that match your interests and skill sets.\n\nTo hear from service members about their own career experiences in the Military, visit Career Stories.\n\nFirst, candidates need to confirm the career field or Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) they want are available by working with the service enlistment counselor at a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS). Thousands of different jobs are available, but not in each Service. Jobs are assigned based on several factors:\n\nCurrent and anticipated military needs\n\nIndividual career aspirations\n\nIndividual skills and qualifications\n\nResults from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test (ASVAB)\n\nPotential recruits and parents should review the job categories in the careers section of this site and then discuss possible career paths with a recruiter.\n\nThe short answer is “yes.” However, many military jobs come with time commitments, so a service member might be obligated to remain in a specific career for the length of his or her contract. It is best to ask a recruiter for specifics, or, if already serving, to speak with the command career counselor.\n\nFor many service members, the Military serves as a foundation of skills and experience that translate into civilian careers. In addition to government programs that provide transition assistance, many organizations also provide employment resources and opportunities for those who are returning to civilian life."
