        "text": "The UK government is set to put the Russian mercenary group, Wagner, on its list of terrorist organisations.\n\nWagner's future is very uncertain, after the death of its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, in a plane crash in western Russia in August.\n\nWhat is the Wagner group and how big is it?\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin said he founded Wagner in 2014.\n\nAlthough mercenary forces are technically illegal in Russia, Wagner registered as a \"private military company\" in 2022.\n\nPrigozhin was a wealthy businessman and convicted criminal, known as \"Putin's chef\" because he provided catering for the Kremlin.\n\nWagner's first field commander was Dmitry Utkin, a former Russian special forces officer. The group was named after his radio call sign.\n\nMost Wagner mercenaries initially came from Russia's special forces and other elite units, and in its early days the group was thought to number about 5,000.\n\nHowever, in 2022, Prigozhin recruited prisoners from Russian jails to fight in Ukraine, in exchange for pardons. In June, he said the group had 25,000 fighters.\n\nThe group has also operated in Syria, Mali, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Libya.\n\nWhat is the UK doing about Wagner?\n\nThe order would also make it illegal to be a member of Wagner, or to support it.\n\nMs Braverman said Wagner fighters \"are terrorists, plain and simple,\" and a \"threat to global security\".\n\nIn response, the Kremlin said that the group does not exist from a legal point of view.\n\nIn January 2023, the US designated Wagner a \"Transnational Criminal Organization\".\n\nA number of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have called on the EU to add the group to its terrorist list.\n\nWhat crimes have Wagner fighters been accused of?\n\nUkrainian prosecutors say three Wagner mercenaries killed and tortured civilians near Kyiv in April 2022, alongside regular Russian troops.\n\nGerman intelligence says Wagner troops may also have massacred civilians in Bucha in March 2022.\n\nIn July 2023, the UK sanctioned Wagner's businesses in Africa, accusing it of \"executions and torture in Mali and the Central African Republic and threats to peace and security in Sudan\".\n\nThe US military previously accused Wagner mercenaries of planting landmines in and around the Libyan capital, Tripoli.\n\nWhat did Wagner do for Russia in Ukraine?\n\nWagner troops were heavily involved in the battle for Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, which they captured for Russia in May 2023.\n\nDuring the fighting, Prigozhin repeatedly criticised Russia's army chief, Valery Gerasimov, and defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, for under-supplying Wagner's troops, many of whom were killed or injured.\n\nIn June 2023, some 5,000 Wagner fighters staged a mutiny. They occupied the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, and marched on Moscow, with the stated aim of ousting Gerasimov and Shoigu.\n\nPrigozhin halted the advance after making a deal with Russian President Putin, which was brokered by the Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nPutin said Wagner's fighters could either join the Russian army or go to Belarus with Prigozhin.\n\nIn July, a US military spokesman said Wagner troops were no longer thought to be \"taking part in hostilities\" in Ukraine.\n\nWhat has Wagner been doing in Belarus?\n\nThey are thought to be based at military camps in the south of the country, at Tsel and Brestsky.\n\nThe Belarusian defence ministry says they are training the country's territorial forces.\n\nWhat has Wagner been doing in Africa?\n\nIn a speech to Wagner mercenaries in Belarus in July, Prigozhin said the group would expand its operations in Africa.\n\nAn estimated 1,000 Wagner fighters have been in Mali, in western Africa, since December 2021.\n\nThey were hired to combat armed Islamist groups, replacing the UN and French peacekeeping forces which had previously operated there.\n\nThere are an estimated 1,000 Wagner fighters in the Central African Republic (CAR), who the UK says operate behind a front organisation called the Officers Union for International Security.\n\nWhat do we know about the plane crash which killed Prigozhin?\n\nSenior Wagner fighter Dmitry Utkin was also on board.\n\nUK defence sources told the BBC that Russia's FSB intelligence agency was thought likely to have been responsible."
