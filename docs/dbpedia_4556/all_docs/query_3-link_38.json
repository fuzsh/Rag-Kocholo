        "text": "Rank does not factor into bonuses available for first-time enlisted Soldiers, since most join with the same starting rank. Instead, the values of initial enlistment bonuses are determined by other factors like job specialty (called MOS) or how quickly you can report to Basic Combat Training.\n\nOnce you’re serving and near completion of an enlisted contract, rank and length of service can be factors for receiving a reenlistment bonus.\n\nBonuses for commissioned Officers are more rare but offered during service for some specialties and in-demand jobs. These are also offered to some civilians with special in-demand skills who join the Army as commissioned Officers.\n\nYes. A Soldier currently serving in the Army may be eligible for a reenlistment bonus, provided the Soldier has completed at least 17 months of continuous active duty (other than for training), is qualified in a military skill designated as critical, and reenlists for a period of at least three years.\n\nThe timing of your bonus and how it’s paid out will depend on which ones you qualify for and the details of your contract. Generally, initial payments for new enlistment bonuses are made after the completion of your training, but timing may vary. It’s important to work with your recruiter and get all the details of the bonuses you’re eligible for and how to receive payment during your joining process."
