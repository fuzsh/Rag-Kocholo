VA can use this information to facilitate its 4th mission â€” which is to respond to a national public health emergency, including those declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C 247d). This information may be shared with partnering federal agencies as identified in Public Law 117-263, Section 5127(a) (i.e. Health and Human Services, Department of Defense, Public Health Service).\n\nNote: This portal is for support of our emergency response mission in a national health emergency. Signing up does not initiate employment consideration with VA.\n\nYour medical training and experience can be critical to enhance health care services, internal and external to VA."
