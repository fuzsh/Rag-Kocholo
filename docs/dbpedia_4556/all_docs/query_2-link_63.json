        "text": "Mercenary models are normally allowed to be included in the armies of other factions as friendly, non-faction models on a theme-by-theme basis where they are seen onesy-twosey.\n\nAs a faction unto itself, Mercenaries are comprised of NINE mostly unrelated theme forces that allow wildly different models from nearly every faction in the game.\n\nThe Mercenary \"faction\" serves as a way for players to branch out and expand their collections. A Cygnar or Protectorate player could build a Llaelese Resistance army. A Cryx or Convergence player could expand into Strange Bedfellows. And once you have one of those forces built, an army in The Irregulars theme is usually easy to acquire. And so it goes.\n\nTip !\n\nNew players often misunderstand how they can include Mercenary models in a non-Mercenary Faction (especially how they can include Mercenary warjacks/warcasters).\n\nMercenary warjacks can only be controlled by a Mercenary model.\n\nIn a normal game, this means other Factions need to hire a Mercenary 'Jack Marshal or a Mercenary \"Junior Warcaster\".\n\nA Mercenary warcaster can only be put in a non-Mercenary army if you're playing a 2+ caster game.\n\nIf you're only playing with 1 caster, and that caster is a Mercenary warcaster, then by definition you're playing a Mercenary force.\n\nMercenary units, solos, and battle engines can hire themselves out to any non-Mercenary army that is listed on their card.\n\nMost non-Mercenary Theme Forces place a limit on how many Mercenaries can be included.\n\nThere are many exceptions to the above rules, such as Partisan, Limited Employment, and Maker's Mark.\n\nStarting your own Mercenary force\n\nIntroduction\n\nMercenaries are the largest, most expansive faction with no central unifying theme. Pirates, dwarfs, holy warriors, divine manifestations, undead, and clockwork angels are all considered mercenaries, but all fight for different reasons, so there is no concise way to sum it up.\n\nPlaystyle\n\nThere is so much variety in the faction that essentially any playstyle is possible. You will never shoot as well as Cygnar or fight as well as Grymkin or Cryx, so combined arms is usually the best way to go.\n\nMercenary warjacks tend to be cheap and no-frils.\n\nMercenary warcasters tend to be low focus (usually 6), support-oriented, and most have unusual and very powerful feats. Few are capable caster-killers.\n\nMercenaries do not feature fire, ice, lightning, force, or corrosion themes like the other Warmachine factions, but they do have the most blast weapons of any faction by a huge margin.\n\nStarter Sets\n\nNo mercenary starter set exists or likely ever will.\n\nWorthwhile early purchases\n\nThe Mercenary faction has nine theme forces, each at least as large as a mini-faction. Most factions have four or five. There is also very little model overlap between the themes so you need to plan your first purchases carefully.\n\nIt is best to pick your favorite caster and build around them. Research which theme forces they play in (the Talion Charter theme only allows Privateer warcasters, for example) and make a plan to build your army for those themes.\n\nAfter your warcaster you'll need to buy a battlegroup. Human, Rhulic and Cephalyx casters are restricted to different types of models in their battlegroup. Human casters cannot run Rhulic warjacks and vice-versa. Cephalyx can run only monstrosities.\n\nAll the human merc warjacks are solid picks. For those on a budget, get 3 Nomad kits and magnetize the arms.\n\nCephalyx monstrosities can also be magnetized so 3 heavies will start you off on the right foot.\n\nRhulic players should start with 1-2 Drillers and 4 Gunners, then ask the Privateer Press online store if they sell you 4 Blaster gun bits to magnetize the Gunner/Blasters.\n\nUnit and solo purchases are far more theme-dependent. In brief, your first purchases for each theme should be:\n\nThe Irregulars - Two units of Kayazy Eliminators, Hermit of Henge Hold, Gastone Crosse, Anastasia di Bray, Asphyxious4, Scythe\n\nSoldiers of Fortune - Two units of Steelhead Halberdiers, one unit of Steelhead Heavy Cavalry, Stannis Brocker, Anastasia, Gorman1, Alexia2 (with three Thrall Warriors), Sergeant Nicholas Verendrye and the Steelhead Arcanist\n\nKingmaker's Army - Trencher Infantry, Trencher Long Gunners, Boomhowler, Solo Artist Kell Bailoch, Orin Midwinter and Steelhead Halberdiers\n\nLlaelese Resistance - Ragman, Gorman1, Anastasia, Major Harrison Gibbs, two Morrowan Archons, two Thamarite Archons\n\nHammer Strike - 1-2 units of Horgenhold Forge Guard with Stone Lord Guvul Godor, 1 Hammerfall Siege Crawler, 2 units of Horgenhold Artillery Corps, Harlowe Holdemhigh and Gudrun the Wasted\n\nTalion Charter - Three Powder Monkeys, Aiyana and Holt, Lord Rockbottom, First Mate Hawk, Bosun Grogspar, Doc Killingsworth, The Commodore Cannon & Crew, one each of Scharde Pirateswith their CA, Press Gangers and Sea Dog Pirates with Mr. Walls\n\nOperating Theater - Asphyxious4, two Void Archons, Cephalyx Dominator, Doctor Stygius\n\nFlame in the Darkness - Three Morrowan Battle Priests, Precursor Knights, two Thamarite Archons, Hermit of Henge Hold, Grand Master Gabriel Throne, and two Morrowan Archons.\n\nStrange Bedfellows - Asphyxious4, Prefect Hypatia, Hermit of Henge Hold, three units of Negation Angels, two Void Archons\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven the sprawl, there is quite a bloat of models to collect in the Mercenary faction. You can mix-and-match so many different permutations of models/units and it is perfectly fine to field an army with Humans, Trollbloods, Dwarves, Undead, Gatormen, Ogrun, Farrow, Iosans, and Nyss. You can do almost anything. On top of all these options, a mercenary player has access to almost every unit from Cygnar, Protectorate, and Crucible Guard in the Llaelese Resistance theme force, and even a bit of Cryx, Khador, and Convergence at your disposal in other themes making the options nearly endless.\n\nTheme Forces\n\nFlame in the Darkness\n\nThis theme represents the Thamarite and Morrowan forces putting aside their ideological differences and teaming up to fight off the Infernal invasion. It is shared with Cygnar and Khador and grants access to their warjacks. It is a very melee-oriented force featuring angels and holy warriors.\n\nHere are some examples of the model aesthetic for this theme\n\nHammer Strike\n\nRhul is a nation of Dwarves and Ogrun located in an impregnable mountainous region between Khador, Llael, and Ios. Primarily a trade empire, Rhul has a military on par with any of the Iron Kingdoms, and they defend their own borders meticulously, but only involve themselves in the conflicts of the other nations to keep the trade lanes open and provide combat experience to its troops. On the tabletop, Hammer Strike plays to all the standard tropes of dwarves: slow, sturdy, well-trained, and well-equipped.\n\nHere are some examples of the model aesthetic for this theme\n\nLlaelese Resistance\n\nA guerilla force made up of Llaelese patriots engaged in a desperate struggle to restore Khadoran-occupied Llael as a free and independent nation. Most importantly, it grants you access to any 2 units from any one of Cygnar, Protectorate or Crucible Guard, which is super exciting.\n\nHere are some examples of the model aesthetic for this theme\n\nOperating Theater\n\nCephalyx are a reclusive and pitiless race of psychically powerful creatures that live underground. They capture and experiment upon live creatures, turning them into lobotomized brutes to wage their wars for them. On the tabletop, they are meant to play as a swarm of expendable infantry interspersed with hulking Monstrosities and backed by powerful psychic overlords. However, the best armies have Asphyxious4 and Void Archons as mainstays.\n\nHere are some examples of the model aesthetic for this theme\n\nSoldiers of Fortune\n\nSoldiers of Fortune represents the professional mercenary companies of the famed Steelheads, with a few free agents tagging along. The theme places a heavy emphasis on combined arms and features some of the best artillery in the game.\n\nHere are some examples of the model aesthetic for this theme\n\nStrange Bedfellows\n\nDuring the Infernal invasion, Aurora, and her followers broke away from the Convergence along with Nemo in an attempt to save humanity. This theme is shared with the Convergence and it allows you to mix Cryx, Convergence, Mercenary, and Cygnar models in the same force. It allows only Aurora and Mortenebra warcasters and features a mix of Clockwork Angels, Stormsmiths and Thralls.\n\nHere are some examples of the model aesthetic for this theme\n\nThe Irregulars\n\nA catch-all theme for the weirdos who won't work for the other themes. This theme allows Mercenary character models/units and a few non-character partisan units. It gives bonuses to marshaled warjacks. If you want to field the lesser warlocks, this is the place. It is less cohesive than the other themes, but has more solos than you can shake a stick at to hand out the bonuses you want.\n\nHere are some examples of the model aesthetic for this theme\n\nThe Kingmaker's Army\n\nCygnaran rebels and hired sellswords led by Magnus in his ultimately successful effort to install a new king of Cygnar. Very similar to Soldiers of Fortune, but with a few Cygnaran units thrown in. Trencher Infantry, most importantly.\n\nHere are some examples of the model aesthetic for this theme\n\nThe Talion Charter\n\nThe Charter is a group of pirates and privateers who also happen to sell their services as armies for hire.
