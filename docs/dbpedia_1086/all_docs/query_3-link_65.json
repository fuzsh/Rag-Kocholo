        "text": "Juan Manuel Martinez suddenly passed in his home at the age of 52, peacefully in his sleep, on the morning of February 7, 2024. Juan had a passion for being a great father, DJ-ing and entertaining all over the Salt Lake Valley. He was always attentive to family members and friends. When someone walked in, he would play their favorite song or even just a song that he knew would brighten their day.\n\nMost importantly, Juan's son Juan Jr. was the center of his world. They had a father and son bond full of love and they were the best of friends. He took a lot of joy in attending his son's sporting and school events. He was always proud of JJ's achievements and bragged all the time about his one and only son. JJ is going to miss their regular calls, playing around, talking sports, and hanging out with his dad on the weekends ordering their Doordash.\n\nDJ Juan Love is now performing on the biggest stage up in heaven.\n\nHe is survived by his son Juan Jr. Martinez, Christina Aguilar (Juan Jr's mother), his parents Robert (father) and Carol Valdez (mother), Joe (father) and Sandy (stepmother) Martinez, Joe Martinez (brother), Ben Valdez (brother), Stacey Martinez (sister), Melissa Martinez-Rogers (sister) and many nieces and nephews whom he loved dearly.\n\nServices will be held on Friday, February 16, 2024.\n\nA viewing will be held from 4pm-6pm followed by the funeral at McDougal Funeral Home, located at 4330 S Redwood Road, Taylorsville, Utah."
