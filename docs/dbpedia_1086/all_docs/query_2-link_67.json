        "text": "Sandy Alomar Jr., Edgar Martinez and George “Catfish” Metkovich are the Class of 2013 in the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame.\n\nSandy Alomar Jr., born on June 18, 1966, in Salinas, Puerto Rico, played in parts of four seasons in the Pacific Coast League with the Las Vegas Stars (San Diego Padres,1988-89), Colorado Springs Sky Sox (Cleveland Indians, 1991) and New Orleans Zephyrs (New York Mets, 2007). His 1989 campaign with the Stars will forever be remembered as one of the best performances by a catcher in league history. Over the course of the season, Alomar batted .306 while collecting 160 hits, 101 RBI, 88 runs, 33 doubles and 13 home runs. Alomar was named Pacific Coast League Most Valuable Player in 1988 and 1989, catapulting him into 20 years of Major League service for seven different organizations. He ended his Major League career with a .273 average, 112 home runs and six All-Star appearances.\n\nAlomar Jr. is currently serving as Bench Coach for the Cleveland Indians. He and his wife, Margred, reside in Chicago, Ill. and have four daughters.\n\nEdgar Martinez, born on January 2nd, 1963, in New York, New York, played both third base and designated hitter and delivered four of the best seasons the PCL has ever seen. Over his four-year career in the PCL (1985, 87-89), all with the Calgary Cannons (Seattle Mariners), Martinez posted a .344 average, registered 327 hits and knocked in 107 RBI. He was crowned the PCL Batting Champion in 1988 after hitting an outstanding .363 for the season. After his stint in the minor leagues, Martinez went on to play 18 Major League seasons, all with the Seattle Mariners. In 2004, Major League Baseball named the Outstanding Designated Hitter Award after Martinez, a five-time recipient of the honor. He joins Cy Young, Hank Aaron, Roberto Clemente and Ted Williams as the only players to have MLB awards named after them.\n\nMartinez currently resides in Bellevue, Wash. with his wife, Holli, and their three children.\n\nGeorge “Catfish” Metkovich, born October 8th, 1920, in Angel’s Camp, California, sandwiched seven seasons as an outfielder in the Pacific Coast League, around a 10-year Major League career. In 1950, after having already played six years in the Major Leagues, Metkovich produced one of the greatest seasons in PCL history as a member of the Oakland Oaks when he batted .315 with 24 home runs and 141 RBI. After playing four more years in the Majors, he returned to the PCL in 1955, where he spent his last three seasons of professional baseball. Metkovich played for four different teams including the San Francisco Seals (1943), Oakland Oaks (1948-50, 55-56), Vancouver Mounties (1956) and San Diego Padres (1957). He finished his PCL career with a .320 average, 88 home runs and 447 RBI.\n\nMetkovich died in Costa Mesa, Cal., at the age of 74.\n\nImage of Edgar Martinez during his first season with the Cannons.\n\n—-\n\nShare your news with the baseball community.
