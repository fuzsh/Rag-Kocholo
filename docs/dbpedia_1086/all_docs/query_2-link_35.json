        "text": "Have you tried living a healthy lifestyle but still struggle to maintain a normal weight?\n\nGastric Sleeve Surgery costs $4,500 (all-inclusive). It's no wonder many of our patients choose it for safe and healthy weight loss.\n\nGastric sleeve is the one of the most popular bariatric surgeries performed by Dr. Sandy Martinez at her facility in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nMedical tourism at our Tijuana, Mexico practice allows us to offer bariatric procedures like gastric sleeve and gastric bypass at more affordable prices than you would see in the U.S.\n\nMedical tourism doesn't mean you have to sacrifice quality care. Our Tijuana surgical center uses state-of-the-art equipment that meets the same standards as surgical equipment in the U.S. When performing gastric sleeve surgery, Dr. Martinez uses surgical tools that use thermal energy for a safe and effective procedure and better long-term results.\n\nGet started on your weight loss journey in Tijuana by contacting us online or calling us for a free consultation.\n\n(619) 484-9903\n\nI am forever grateful for Dr. Sandy and her incredible team! I had the best care and the most respectful, comforting nurses ever. The experience was beyond amazing. From the minute I arrived, I was treated with dignity and respect in a very vulnerable time. I will always be thankful for Dr. Sandy and her team for giving me a second chance for myself. I am three months post op and I have lost 50 pounds. My heart rate, both rearing and walking has decreased and so has my blood pressure. I am FOREVER grateful and would recommend Dr. Sandy to anyone. Thank you always\n\nView On Google\n\nI can't really tell you much about the surgery because it was all so quicks since I was knocked out lol. But very little pain, they gave me meds and drinks and their 24/7 nursing staff takes really good care of you. They speak English and are very accommodating. You get a tv, a call button for assistance, private bathroom, etc. Then Dr. Sandy and Consuelo come visit with you a few times in person. They want to make sure you are happy... I was just amazed and very thankful for how much service you get from what little money it cost compared to what it would cost in the United States and the lack of service you would get for that money compared to what Dr. Sandy and her professionals offer.\n\nView On Google"
