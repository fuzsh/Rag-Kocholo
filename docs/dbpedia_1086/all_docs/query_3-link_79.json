        "text": "The Indians minor-league system features several talented players, including catcher Francisco Mejia in Columbus and right-handed pitcher Triston McKenzie in Akron.\n\nRight-handed pitchers Shane Bieber and Adam Plutko are in Cleveland with the big-league club along with center fielder Greg Allen, but the cupboard is certainly not bare with the likes of Mejia, McKenzie, first baseman Bobby Bradley, third baseman Nolan Jones and shortstops Willi Castro and Yu-Cheng Chang in the pipeline.\n\nRubberDucks pitcher Henry Martinez is not one of those highly touted minor leaguers, according to several publications, but he is having a successful season as a closer.\n\nThe right-hander is quite comfortable taking the ball in save situations for the Ducks, even though he is not among the Indians’ top prospect lists compiled by Baseball America, MLBPipeline.com, Athlon Sports, Street & Smith’s and Sporting News.\n\nMartinez converted his 10th save in 10 chances Thursday when the Ducks defeated the visiting Binghamton Rumble Ponies 3-2 at Canal Park.\n\nMartinez started the 2018 season in Class-A Lynchburg and was 4-of-5 in save chances. He received a promotion to Double-A Akron on April 27 and has been solid. Overall, he has a 1-1 record with a 2.25 ERA and 36 strikeouts in 32 innings.\n\n“In the past, I was always a thrower with a good arm, but last year I went to play winter ball in the Dominican Republic and that really helped me understand how to pitch a little bit better being around older players and older pitchers,” Martinez said through his interpreter, Ducks pitching coach Rigo Beltran.\n\n“I have learned how to sequence my pitches and I am really happy with where I am at.”\n\nA native of Santo Domingo, the 6-foot-1 and 175-pound Martinez, 24, relies on his fastball, slider and changeup in his fifth season as a pro.\n\n“He has been working on his slider, and that pitch has come a long way,” Beltran said. “That has helped him get a lot of those saves. ... I think the biggest thing for him is never letting the game speed up on him. He does a good job of slowing things down and understanding the situation.\n\n“Even though he has a good arm, he still uses his changeup and slider. I think his slider is the pitch that will help him get to that next level.”\n\nThe Indians have had a lot of success with Latin American players through the years, including shortstop Francisco Lindor, second baseman Jose Ramirez, pitchers Carlos Carrasco and Danny Salazar and catchers Yan Gomes and Roberto Perez on the current team.\n\nIn past years, Sandy Alomar Jr., Roberto Alomar, Carlos Baerga, Omar Vizquel, Victor Martinez and Carlos Santana have played for the Indians.\n\nCould Henry Martinez be next?\n\n“To see him do well, go through some bumps, and then do well again is a really good sign of a young player making an adjustment when the league adjusts to him,” Ducks manager Tony Manso­lino said. “I am not so sure that always happens with young guys.”\n\nWhile Martinez can throw his fastball in the mid-to-high 90s, Mansolino said he likes the way his changeup and slider are developing.\n\nFather and son\n\nDucks outfielder Connor Marabell had an “eventful” Tuesday and Wednesday at Arm & Hammer Park in Trenton, N.J.\n\nThe 24-year-old Florida native participated in the Eastern League Home Run Derby on Tuesday and then went 1-for-2 with an RBI in the All-Star Game.\n\n“It was a lot of fun,” Marabell said. “It was definitely a dream come true with my dad [Scott] throwing BP to me for the Home Run Derby. That went well, and then the next day, the All-Star Game was good, too. I got a couple of at-bats and then got outta there.”\n\nMichael Beaven can be reached at 330-996-3829 or mbeaven@thebeaconjournal.com. Follow him on Twitter at www.twitter.com/MBeavenABJ."
