        "text": "Recent years have seen fewer and fewer high school players appearing in Arizona and Florida Complex League lineups after being drafted.\n\nHere are the top 10 takeaways from Baseball America’s correspondent organization reports in August.\n\nDrake Baldwin doesn’t get nearly as much hype as he deserves, plus how close is Rhett Lowder to making some noise in the majors?\n\nDemetrio Crisantes suffered two major injuries in high school, but now that he’s healthy, he’s showing what he can do. The best may be yet to come.\n\nRoboScout’s top players for this week include a first rounder who has returned to form, a DSL pitcher who is now lighting up Low-A and a sidearming Ranger.\n\nChandler Simpson and Craig Yoho have the Hot Sheet Show’s attention, plus a deep dive on the state of high school recruiting.\n\nGeoff Pontes welcomes an experienced dynasty baseball manager onto the podcast to discuss potential buys and sells heading into next season.\n\nIn this week’s 90th Percentile Podcast, Geoff Pontes & Matt Pajak look into how athleticism and top speed are evaluated in MLB prospects.\n\nWith the trade deadline now passed, J.J. Cooper and Geoff Pontes lead a deep-dive discussion on the state of each NL West organization."
