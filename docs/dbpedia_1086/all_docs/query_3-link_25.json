        "text": "The Cleveland Guardians have promoted infielder Angel Martinez to the parent club.\n\nThe switch-hitting Martinez is taking the role of Gabriel Arias, who was placed on the Major League Baseball family emergency list June 21.\n\nMartinez, 22, has been on fire recently, and graduates to the big leagues after hitting .333 with three home runs so far this season in 74 plate appearances at Triple-A Columbus.\n\nMartinez got a late start to this season following a foot contusion he suffered during spring training. He was placed on the 60-day Injured List after he also fractured his left hamate bone.\n\nNow healthy, Martinez has opened eyes with his very hot bat in the International League.\n\nIn a Columbus Clippers game against the Worcester Red Sox June 19, Martinez hit a double, and two home runs, scoring four runs, and driving in four.\n\nAbout Angel Martinez:\n\nIn 2018, Angel Martinez was signed by the (then) Cleveland Indians as an international free agent from the Dominican Republic.\n\nMartinez received a $500,000 signing bonus.\n\nThe son of former major league catcher Sandy Martinez, Angel Martinez made his professional debut at the age of 17, when he played for the Indians Dominican Summer League team.\n\nMartinez hit .306 in 261 plate appearances in that first professional experience .\n\nMartinez has flown through the Cleveland Guardians farm system, having played just parts of five seasons. He did not play in the 2020 season due to the pandemic.\n\nScouting Angel Martinez:\n\nMartinez is 6-0, 200 pounds.\n\nMartinez was placed on the Guardians 40-man roster in November 2022. He has been on the rise in the organization since.\n\nAs well as scouting him in the 2022 Arizona Fall League, this old scout got to evaluate Martinez in all 13 games he played this past spring training.\n\nMartinez impressed this writer with his strong frame, excellent barrel skills, and outstanding overall play in the middle-infield.\n\nMature beyond his age, it is evident to this observer that Martinez has the athletic ability and overall skills on both sides of the ball to be impactful at the major league level.\n\nOffensively, Martinez hits well from both sides of the plate. He can barrel the ball to all fields.\n\nMartinez has strong hands and wrists, and his excellent bat speed is a highlight of his hitting mechanics.\n\nMartinez has the ability to let the ball travel a bit, and then, using a measured swing, hit line drive ropes to the gaps.\n\nAs evidenced by his recent Triple-A results, Martinez is flashing power from his strong frame. There is every reason his power surge can continue as he adapts, adjusts, and learns how major league pitchers try to get him out.\n\nAn excellent contact hitter, in his entire minor league career so far, Martinez has struck out only 323 times in 1,793 plate appearances.\n\nMartinez knows the strike zone well, but he goes to the plate to hit. Not to take a walk. He has recorded only 184 minor league walks.\n\nRanked as the No. 9 prospect in the Guardians organization by MLB.com, Martinez is at his best when he sees lots of pitches per at-bat, which is a hallmark of the Guardians organizational hitting philosophy.\n\nTo this scout, if he gets decent playing time, Martinez could hit 20 home runs in a big league season.\n\nDefensively, the Guardians have played him at second base, shortstop, third base, and in the outfield in his development years.\n\nFor this scout, Martinez probably fits best at second base. But his arm strength is strong enough to make every play from shortstop, with good carry on his throws.\n\nIf there is one flaw to his defense, Martinez may not have the first-step quickness to the ball some scouts may like. However, he gets the job done with good footwork, and that strong arm.\n\nMartinez has enough speed to steal bases, but he isn’t a burner.\n\nAfter observing Martinez in the 2022 Arizona Fall League, this scout wrote:\n\n“Athletic, switch-hitting middle-infielder with potentially surprising power. Excellent contact hitter, with ability to spread the ball from foul line to foul line from both sides of the plate. Baseball savvy. Makes good game decisions. Can force his way to the big leagues.”\n\nMartinez’ excellent spring reinforced those thoughts.\n\nMartinez will wear No. 1 with the Guardians.\n\nScouting Grade: 50\n\nMartinez has the ability to be a regular middle-infielder at the big league level. If needed, he can play third base. He has a great eye at the plate, makes contact, and should hit for a good batting average, with potential power. He is good defensively.\n\nIt will take some time for Martinez to play his way to the starting lineup.\n\nThis scout values Angel Martinez as a Grade 50 player-or one that can be counted upon for an eventual regular place in a major league lineup."
