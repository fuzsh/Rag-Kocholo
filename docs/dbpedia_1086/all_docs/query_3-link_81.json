He broke into the big leagues with the Chicago Cubs in 1986 at the age of 21 and was the 10th-youngest player to appear in Major League Baseball during the season.\n\n\"We are honored to have Dave Martinez return as our special guest and keynote speaker at the 2020 First Pitch Dinner,\" Mason baseball head coach Bill Brown said. \"It is exciting that he will be spending the evening of Jan. 24 with us sharing his insight on the Nationals World Series Championship and his incredibly accomplished professional baseball career.\"\n\nAn MVP Table for the event can be purchased for $3,000 and includes six tickets, entry to an MVP reception with Dave Martinez, silent auction, dinner, seating with two members of the 2020 Mason baseball team and names listed in the event program.\n\nTable sponsorship is available for $2,000 and includes six tickets, entry to social hour, silent auction, dinner, seating with two members of the 2020 Mason baseball team and names listed in the event program.\n\nGeneral individual tickets can be purchased for $250, Baseball Alumni and Young Alumni (undergraduate degree holders of the last five years) for $200 and the cost for youth 12 and under is $50. All tickets include entry to the social hour, silent auction and dinner. The MVP reception begins at 6 p.m., followed by the social hour at 6:30 p.m. and dinner at 7:30 p.m.\n\n\"What a fantastic experience for the players, alumni, friends of Mason Baseball and the entire baseball community to have the opportunity to hear from the man who led the Washington Nationals to the 2019 World Series Championship,\" Brown said. \"Our thanks to Dave Martinez for agreeing to be part of what will be an incredibly special evening for the Mason Baseball program, our athletic department and George Mason University.\"\n\nFor more information, contact LeeAnn Bushar at lbushar@gmu.edu or 703-993-4147.
