        "text": "Expos 7, Dodgers 4\n\nPedro Martinez improved to 7-0 with seven solid innings and Mike Lansing matched a career high with five hits, including a home run, to lead the Expos to a 7-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers yesterday in Montreal.\n\nMartinez allowed three earned runs for the first time in 14 starts since last Aug. 24, and his earned run average jumped from 0.79 to 1.20. He struck out seven, walked one and joined the Mets' Bobby Jones (7-2) as the National League's only seven-game winners.\n\nCubs 5, Giants 3\n\nSammy Sosa hit two home runs, leading host Chicago before a standing-room crowd of 37,958.\n\nSosa homered in the first inning, a two-run shot, for his 150th with the Cubs, 10th most in team history. Sosa led off the seventh with a shot to center. It broke a 3-3 tie.\n\nMarlins 5, Pirates 3\n\nGregg Zaun hit a pinch-hit go-ahead single in the 10th, one pitch after apparently thinking he had walked, and Florida overcame Midre Cummings's pinch-hit two-run homer in the ninth to defeat Pittsburgh. Florida had never won a series in Pittsburgh.\n\nPhillies 5, Astros 3\n\nScott Rolen hit a two-run homer and Garrett Stephenson allowed only six hits and one unearned run over seven innings as host Philadelphia defeated Houston.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
