        "text": "There's an element to paying it forward in every action Roger and Jordan Martinez take coaching in Pueblo.\n\nRoger Sr., the pair's father and namesake of the eldest brother, had his own journey in the coaching ranks. He led the Pueblo County boys basketball program to multiple Final Four appearances and coached each of his sons for most of their lives.\n\nHe was also their inspiration. They were given a behind-the-curtains looks at how he impacted the youth of their community, and the joy he was able to both give and receive on the sidelines. It's made their desire to do the same stronger.\n\nThe trio's goals are simply stated: change lives. They want to use coaching as an avenue to build up youth and give them an outlet — a way to grow into valuable members of society.\n\nCSU Pueblo schedule recap: National title or bust: A week-by-week breakdown of CSU Pueblo football's 2021 schedule\n\nThe branching out process\n\nJordan and Roger were just children, barely able to operate their still-developing limbs, when their father handed them a basketball.\n\nTheir mother, Sandy, also has two decades of coaching middle school basketball and volleyball on her resume.\n\nRoger Sr. began his own coaching career because of non-basketball factors. He knew the way things were being done could improve, but more importantly, he saw the teens who were unable to participate.\n\nIn many cases, their inability to take part in basketball was due to race or socio-economic status. He wanted everyone to be able to play, and the best way he knew how was to apply at the school he'd graduated from, Pueblo County, in 1973.\n\nEach player, including his children, was schooled on the fundamentals of basketball. They often modeled the old school basketball that exemplified the era they were in, much like the storyline of the film \"Hoosiers.\"\n\nIn his career, he missed, by his count, only five freshmen games in 10 years. As the varsity coach, he built from the bottom.\n\nWhen his sons reached high school — at Pueblo County like the rest of the Martinez family — both had their times on varsity, including Roger Jr.'s stint that parlayed into a college career at both Trinidad State Junior College and then the University of Memphis-Lambuth.\n\nBasketball was the favorite of his three sports that included baseball and football.\n\nJordan went a more direct route. During his junior year, he tore his patella tendon, leaving him with a choice between football and basketball. He chose the latter, but wasn't able to fully recover in time to play collegiately.\n\nStory continues below\n\nHe came right back to Pueblo County and began his assistant coaching career for its girls basketball team. He manned the freshmen team on the side and also helped with softball.\n\n\"I saw my dad have an amazing time with it. I saw my brother have an amazing time,\" Jordan said. \"Both had so much success in their career as head coaches, and so the apple doesn't fall from the tree. It just comes natural to me.\"\n\nRoger Jr. spent several years under multiple college coaches and picked up the nuances which crafted his own philosophy. His pair of coaches at Trinidad State Junior College, Jim Toupal and Rich Holden, had differing philosophies.\n\nThe former focused on having a court system and trusting the players to fit into it. The latter focused more on fundamentals — something Roger says molded his desire to focus on the little things, too.\n\nHis dad's lesson, even if unspoken, was one of respect; respect for opposing coaches, your players, the fans and referees alike.\n\nIn his decade-long career, Roger Sr. received only one technical foul. In his nine seasons as coach of the Dolores Huerta Prep boys hoops squad, Roger Jr. never received one.\n\n\"He's a people-person,\" Roger Jr. said. \"He knows how to flirt with that fine line but not cross it. (He taught us) about just developing those relationships with not only your players, but the officials and the fans and everybody that you knows you and supports your program.\"\n\nBoth Roger Jr. and Jordan basked in the ability to contact their father whenever help was needed. Even after he retired, he'd make his way into the DHPH locker room to give a piece of his mind during a slump. It was welcomed, too.\n\nThey all work together, though they've seldom done so in an official context. One day, they hope to change that.\n\nReturning to Pueblo's gridiron: 15 returning players to watch out for in Pueblo high school football's 2021 season\n\nWhat's next for the trio\n\nIn the most utopian of worlds, the Martinez family would finally get the chance to team up and lead the Hornets.\n\nRoger Sr. led the boys in his head coaching days, Roger Jr. led the Scorpions for nearly a decade and Jordan has spent several years aiding various programs throughout the Pueblo County athletic department.\n\nThe years haven't overlapped, though.\n\n\"That's actually a dream of mine — to either coach with my brother or my father, or even against my brother,\" Jordan said. \"That would probably be the highlight of my coaching career.\"\n\nRoger Sr. has often helped both his sons. He's been a scorekeeper and beacon of knowledge when they've needed it. And on game days, he and Sandy sit in the stands, close enough to pick up every nuance.\n\n\"When we won the South-Central league three years ago, just him being there and sharing that moment with him is a memory I'll never forget,\" Roger Jr. said. \"My mom was right there in the first row of the stands cheering me on. They just played a huge role in every aspect of my life, but most importantly, the sport that we love as a family.\"\n\nJordan needed to step away from the basketball program for his career after last season, much like his brother who needed to tend to his family.\n\nThe latter is returning, though this time it'll be on a diamond, rather than a court. He'll become an assistant coach for the Pueblo County softball team this year.\n\nRoger Jr. has coached his daughter in softball for several years, and though he stepped away from DHPH, he never stopped. She's in eighth grade, so his hope to coach her again next year in high school.\n\nEach of the brothers marveled in their experience of being coached by their father, and have voiced their desire to do the same for each of their children.\n\nEven for their players who aren't blood, they're simply hoping to impact lives. They've already had the experience of graduated players coming back and thanking them — a reward that's simply incomparable to anything else in everyday life for them.\n\nIt's a sign that their goal, and their father's goal, is one that can help the world.\n\n\"Just being able to give my kids and not just my kids, but the kids that I coach, everything,\" Roger Jr. said about the family's goal. \"They deserve someone who, whether it's the slabs or at the park and they're just, can just give them the opportunity to be successful.\n\n\"I set the bar high, but man, kids will (always) rise to the occasion.\"\n\nChieftain reporter Luke Zahlmann can be reached at lzahlmann@gannett.com or on Twitter: @lukezahlmann"
