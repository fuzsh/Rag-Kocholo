I reached out to Dr. Sandy and her team to help me through this process and I thank God that I met such a lovely person. Dr. Sandy was so willing to answer any and all of my questions. She visited me in the hospital room multiple times and made sure her team took great care of me. I am so impressed with her level of expertise in this field and her passion to help people get healthier. You are truly amazing, Dr. Sandy! You stand above all the doctors I’ve ever known because you are great at what you do and you are so compassionate with each patient! Her coordinator Joan was an absolutely pleasure to work with. He is organized, detailed oriented, compassionate, and funny! He was an amazing support throughout the entire process and his communication was impeccable. I never had to worry about a single thing while I was there. Overall, I am thankful for my experience and I know I made the right choice. I am so excited to see my progress! – Barbie"
