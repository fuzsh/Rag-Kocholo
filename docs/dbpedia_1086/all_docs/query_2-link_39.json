        "text": "SANDY MARTINEZ, Producer\n\nSandy has managed actors for more than 20 years and been working as a producer for\n\n17. As a die-hard fan of independent film and its artisans, she is interested in helping to\n\ndevelop exportable projects with universal appeal.\n\nShe began producing in 2003 on the pilot Midnight Shift, where she was responsible for\n\nproduction, casting and was Second AD. As Associate Producer of the cult genre feature\n\nEternal, she produced the evocative teaser which launched the film’s successful\n\nrelease.\n\nSandy came on board on Jim Donovan's feature 3 Saisons as Co-Producer and rose to\n\nthe challenge of making it on a very low budget. The film went on to receive a myriad of\n\nawards, nominations and critical acclaim. Shortly thereafter, director Charles-Olivier\n\nMichaud enlisted her to produce his first feature Snow And Ashes. The stakes were\n\nhigh as director wanted to recreate war-torn Chechnya with snowy landscapes and have\n\na cast of Russian speaking characters, all on a challenging shooting budget. The film\n\nreceived many accolades and awards in Canada and abroad, prominently the Grand\n\nJury Award at the Slamdance Film Festival 2010.\n\nSandy has a keen understanding of all aspects of the entertainment industry. With her\n\nrecent production experiences under her belt, Sandy continues to manage artists around\n\nthe world and to evolve in the industry as producer. With the original series The Last\n\nTribe, Sandy is enthusiastic to bring to life a story that is so unique, epic and primal."
