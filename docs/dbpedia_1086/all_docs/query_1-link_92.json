Having studied in production, dabbled in radio and then worked in animation, dubbing and other spheres of post-production – becoming an agent seemed like the perfect way to unite all those realities. And she wanted to do it in both languages!\n\nGuiding actors to craft their career path, to learn the business of acting and to present their best self is all part of what she loves.\n\nShe truly feels that this career chose her as much as she chose it !\n\nNicole Raviv is an international musical artist.

What turns you on. What makes you and your body feel alive and empowered! Start noticing what and who sucks that from you in your life. Is it too many screens? People who don’t encourage and truly unconditionally support you….. Notice. Become aware and make a new choice.\n\nLike nature, we, our bodies, the industry, life, is ALWAYS changing. So nothing, not even the slow times or hard times will stay the same, they are sure to change, just as the seasons do. So in the meantime, why not make choices that uplift and empower you?\n\nTwo quotes from two beloved acting coaches: Warren Robertson used to say,\" if it ain’t fun….RUN!” and a coach from Women In The Director’s chair at the Banff School Of Fine Art’s, I hold dear every day: \"There will always be a role with your name on it.”\n\n\"So, why not be you? Everyone else is taken\" from Oscar Wilde.\n\nFelicia is passionate about moving and telling stories; that started at the ripe old age of three when she saw her first play and became hooked.

Indeed, singing, dancing, acting and traveling around the world are part of her day-to-day life. This lifestyle draws a very unusual path for her…\n\nDespite a classical music influence at home, it is her rebellious side that will push Elyzabeth towards rock music when she sees Pat Benatar’s first video on MTV during a trip to New York where mother was singing at the Metropolitan Opera. She later discovers that she has this in common with the singer as she, also, had a singer mom. This style allows her a greater freedom of expression and after playing in a student musical when she was 17, participating in various cover bands at age 18, she starts her quest to conquer the large Quebec bar scene with her own band Dizzy Miss Lizzy, singing the best rock & top 40 hits.\n\nIn 2010, she envisions the creation of her own ONE WOMAN SHOW to pay tribute to the great female icons who revolutionized the world of rock of the last four decades and it is in 2012 that the QoR adventure begins with the collaboration of two important sponsors Claude de Grandpré of the THC & Mario Gauthier of Media Musique.\n\nIn 2013, Queens of Rock comes to life on the stage of The Hector-Charland Theater in L’Assomption, Quebec in front of a full house.
