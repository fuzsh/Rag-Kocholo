        "text": "Buy the Gossip, Sell the News... an old adage in the market place. BUT at the end of the day a few comments: 1. The club is priced at a sponsorhsip/licensing valuation not a consumer or media valuation. I've written a ton on that in the past. 2. They get attacked for the debt they have but actually the capital structure has probably been good for the club (and the owners) and has never held them back form buying players. But I suspect a new stadium will need much more debt... 3. If you want to release valuation metrics you need to be more than a B2B company...not saying its easy just the reality of things. There is value in having access to 1bn people. But until the fans come first it's unlikely. 4. you have to hand it to the management at MUFC in the past. They proved that with a real brand in sports, you can get revenue growth (and normally profitable) without winning titles. You want to win them as its an accelerant on growth but impressive none the less. 5. When Glazers actually sell the price will jump again...\n\nWhat is happening at Manchester United? The Glazers announce they are willing to entertain buyers and the share price doubles. Ineos steps in and the share price almost halves back to where it had been languishing for years. On the surface the Ineos purchase generated genuine excitement for the next decade as a new stadium and some serious thought/resource would be put towards the playing side of the team. The market says otherwise. - Is the structure too complicated so nothing gets achieved? - Is the realisation of what needs doing overwhelming? - Can 3 years consecutive losses (20/21/22) be turned around? - The Financial Times (Lex) valued the club at $1.6bn which is way below the current price. - Trophy assets have been rising across the IPL, NFL and even EPL (think Chelsea Football Club recent sale and RedBird Capital Partners buying AC Milan) and applying conventional valuation techniques misses one vital but intangible factor: opportunities to own truly global sporting franchises are vanishingly rare.

I learned that lesson the hard way early in my career when a consumer electronic startup received an editor's choice award due to my public relations efforts. When planning any major campaign, marketers must always ask if a company can meet demand. A generic yes is not a good enough answer. Ask for specific numbers. Not being able to fulfill demand can result in reputation damage and a possible crisis communication situation. #demandgen #demandgeneration #productfulfillment #crisiscommunications\n\nIn the world of #football, yesterday's Quarter Finals match between Manchester United and Liverpool unfolded as an epic saga of determination and grit. Against all odds, the seemingly weaker team, Manchester United, triumphed over the formidable Liverpool with a stunning 4-3 victory. It was a match that echoed the essence of keeping one's focus on the goal, no matter the challenges faced. In the world of business and branding, this triumph mirrors the journey of iconic brands like Kentucky Fried Chicken(KFC). Originating from humble beginnings, Colonel Sanders faced countless rejections before his finger-lickin' good recipe finally gained traction. His unwavering determination and belief in his product eventually turned a roadside eatery into a global phenomenon. Similarly, in the realm of #marketing and #PR, the lesson is crystal clear: persistence pays off. Building a brand isn't always a smooth ride; it requires relentless effort and a refusal to be deterred by setbacks. Just as Manchester United rallied against Liverpool's onslaught, businesses must stay resilient in the face of challenges, consistently delivering their message and value proposition to the world. Every successful brand has its own underdog story, its own journey of overcoming obstacles to reach the summit of success. So, let's take inspiration from yesterday's match and the legacy of KFC: keep your eyes on the ball, stay determined, and never underestimate the power of perseverance in making your brand great. ‚öΩÔ∏è #BrandBuilding #MarketingStrategies #NeverGiveUp #football #footballfans #staymotivated #stayfocused #publicrelations PS: Massu Antony what do you think\n\n‚öΩüí∏Champions Made or Bought?

A surge in demand brings fresh challenges for dedicated in-house teams. The quest for swift order processing and accurate fulfilment is vital. That's why an increasing number of sports teams and clubs are embracing collaboration with 3PL partners, paving the way for seamless operations. In our latest article, we explore the three cornerstones of seamless and efficient fulfilment even during times of peak demand: - Reaching international audiences - Scalability and growth - Meeting fan expectations Read more: https://lnkd.in/eZMVa2zF\n\nOnce more, the Sydney Swans have claimed the top spot on the annual Roy Morgan AFL supporter ladder, standing as the sole club boasting more than one million loyal fans. The Swans' fan base has now swelled to 1,344,000 supporters, marking an impressive surge of 209,000 supporters. Just as interesting is the AFL - Australian Football League 'Supporter Conversion to Membership Rates' also published by Roy Morgan. The top five clubs with the most successful supporter-to-member conversion rates were Port Adelaide FC (with 21% of their fans as members), North Melbourne FC (20.4%), Melbourne Demons (20%), Gold Coast SUNS (19.8%), and the Richmond Tigers FC (18.3%). Interestingly, three of these clubs did not advance to the Finals in 2022, which then required their sales teams to focus on selling \"hope\" as they fought hard to boost member conversion rates for the 2023 season. In a previous role, I was the Membership Sales Manager for a football club that was perennial cellar dwellers. Over 6 years, we endured multiple wooden spoons, however, we were able to grow the membership by 200% in 3 years by sticking to our core membership sales principles. This is effectively where the magic happens and proves that you can achieve positive commercial outcomes without on-field success. Want to learn more? Let's chat BYRVIL LIVE #sport #sportbusiness"
