        "text": "Starting in December and ending on Opening Day, Joe Posnanski will count down the 100 greatest baseball players by publishing an essay on a player every day for 100 days. In all, this project will contain roughly as many words as “Moby Dick.” Yes, we know it’s nutty. We hope you enjoy.\n\nPedro Martínez still remembers — he will always remember — just standing there, on a dirt path, under an open window at Campo Las Palmas. He could hear Los Angeles Dodgers scouts and coaches clearly talking about him. Martínez was 16 years old then, and he had just finished his Dodgers tryout, and he felt great about it. He always felt great about his pitching. At that exact moment, Martínez was entirely certain that he was destined to become one of the greatest pitchers in all of baseball. No other possibility had ever occurred to him.\n\nOnly, through the open window, he heard otherwise.\n\n“He is not going to develop,” one of the voices said.\n\n“Was he anything special?” asked another.\n\n“To be honest, there’s nothing I like so much.”\n\nMartínez stared at the window, and he felt an emotion that he had never experienced before. “I started to feel the ground beneath me giving way,” he wrote in his autobiography. It was not just rejection. It was not just sadness. It was earth-shaking shock, like walking outside one day and seeing fish floating all around you. He simply could not make sense of what they were saying; his entire reality, his understanding of the world, his entire sense of self was being rocked.\n\nAt that age, he knew only three things for sure.\n\n1. He knew the Dodgers were going to sign him.\n\n2. He knew that he was going to America.\n\n3. He knew that he was going to become one of the greatest pitchers in all of baseball.\n\nIt wasn’t a question of faith. It wasn’t about dreams. No, it was knowledge, like two-plus-two-equals-four knowledge, like the knowledge that the sun comes up each day. And yet the more the men on the other side of the window spoke — he’s too small, he’s too thin, he doesn’t project, he’s not like his brother — the more confused Martínez felt. How are you supposed to feel when everything you know turns out to be a lie?\n\nAnd with the lie came questions: What if the Dodgers didn’t sign him? What if he was not destined to be one of the great pitchers in all of baseball? What would he be then?\n\n“It felt,” he wrote, “like a machete took another hack at the branch I was standing on. I could hear the frightening, splintering sound as the branch began to give way under my scrawny legs and sent me tumbling down into a black void so deep I couldn’t fathom where I’d land.”\n\nThen came salvation in the form of a new voice. Eleodoro Arias had once been a pitcher for the Dominican national team. He later became the winning manager of the team. He was a voice of power in his country, particularly when he talked about pitching. He understood pitching in ways that simply eluded others.\n\nEveryone quieted to hear what Arias had to say.\n\n“Tiene el corazón de un león,” he said.\n\nHe’s got the heart of a lion.\n\nAnd that is how the legend of Pedro Martínez began.\n\nThere is a marvelous evolution of pitchers who came from the Dominican Republic. We might call it: The Road to Pedro. The road begins — if such roads can be said to have a beginning — with a glorious pitcher named Bombo Ramos. Ramos was an electrifying and charismatic right-handed pitcher in the 1940s; he was basically the country’s Satchel Paige, to the point where he, like Satch, would actually name his pitches. His best pitch he called “La Diabla,” which translates to “She Devil.”\n\nRamos died tragically at age 25 in the “Tragedy of Rio Verde” plane crash in 1948, which killed 32 players on the Santiago team.\n\nJuan Marichal saw Ramos pitch. Marichal was just 10 years old then but his life changed; he knew from that moment on that he was destined to become a great pitcher himself. He enthusiastically copied Ramos’ side-armed pitching motion and threw hard enough that he was signed by the Giants. When he got to the minor leagues, a manager named Andy Gilbert saw him pitch and worried that his motion was too violent. There was no way he could stay healthy throwing the ball that way.\n\n“Do you want to learn how to throw overhand?” Gilbert asked. Marichal nodded. They worked together and, curiously, Marichal found that when throwing overhand, he felt most comfortable if he kicked his front leg high to the sky. That became his trademark. And he pitched his way to the Hall of Fame.\n\nJoaquín Andújar idolized Marichal and wanted to become a pitcher in the major leagues, too. He could not do that high kick the way Marichal could, so instead, he came at hitters with attitude and fury and a million different pitching angles — over the top, three-quarters, side-arm. Andújar was a whirlwind, a tornado. He got to the major leagues just as Marichal was departing, and he made four All-Star teams and led the league in wins one year and he was fantastic in the 1982 World Series. He struck out more than 1,000 hitters, and after many of those whiffs, he would point at the hitter and fire, as if his index finger and thumb was a Derringer. Yes, Andújar was, as he often said, “One Tough Dominican.”\n\nShortly after Andújar came Mario Soto. He was around the same size as Marichal and Andújar, but he too had his own unique style. He developed a bewildering swing-and-miss circle changeup that left hitters baffled. Soto twice led the National League in strikeouts per nine innings — in fact, his 9.6 strikeouts per nine innings in 1982 was, at the time, the most for any National League pitcher not named Sandy Koufax or J.R. Richard.\n\nThen there was José Rijo. He was a phenom; the Yankees signed him at 15. He was too young to see Marichal pitch at his best (though he would marry Marichal’s daughter, Rosie) but he resembled the great man in many ways. He was a complete pitcher — fastball, slider, splitter, changeup — and from 1988 to 1994 (after a sluggish start to his career) he was about as good as anybody in the game. He went 87-53 with a 2.63 ERA over those seven years, and in 1990, he led the Cincinnati Reds to the World Series and then went 2-0 with a 0.59 ERA against Oakland. He was named World Series MVP.\n\nFinally: Ramón Martínez. He was different from the rest in that he was much taller (6-foot-4) and he wasn’t a pure power pitcher. He grew up idolizing Soto, the strikeout king, and Ramón was a strikeout pitcher himself. In his first full season, 1990, he went 20-6 with a 2.92 ERA and led the league in complete games. He also struck out 223, including 18 in one shutout against Atlanta. He finished second in the Cy Young voting to Doug Drabek, coming as close as any Dominican pitcher ever had to winning the award (his hero, Soto, had also finished second one year).\n\n“He throws fastballs,” Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda said when asked what he liked about Martínez. “No tricks. No funny stuff. He throws fastballs like the great ones did.”\n\nAnd here the road leads to the greatest of them all, one of the greatest who ever lived: Ramón’s little brother Pedro. Their father, Paolino Martínez, might have been part of that road, too, had circumstances been different. Paolino was a superb pitcher; he reputedly had a nasty sinker. He was invited to join his friends Matty and Felipe Alou at a Giants tryout. They went and signed. He did not go. It is probably because he could not afford the cleats and was too embarrassed to go without them.\n\nAll of the pitchers had so much in common. They all grew up poor, grew up playing baseball with some variation on tree branches as bats and rolled-up socks as balls. Pedro found that the best baseballs of all were the heads of his sister’s dolls. He grew up like Marichal and Soto and Rijo had, poor, hungry, exhausted from work, listening to the rain crash against their zinc roofs. Curtains separated the rooms in the Martínezes’ dirt-floor house in Manoguayabo.\n\nBut while Marichal and Andújar and Soto had to imagine what a baseball life might look like, Pedro knew. The extraordinary part was the confidence. Pedro will say that all through his childhood, he never shut up. And much of the time he talked about what life would be like when he was a great pitcher. He was so sure. The way he saw it, he was all of the great Dominicans rolled together — he had Marichal’s majesty and Andújar’s rage and Soto’s changeup and Rijo’s resourcefulness …\n\nAnd he had his brother, Ramón, to guide him.\n\nHow could he miss?\n\nPedro Martínez raced through the minor leagues — but not fast enough for his own taste. He almost quit when he didn’t make the club out of spring training in 1993, he was so angry. But his brother settled him down, and the Dodgers brought him up after three days when Todd Worrell blew out his arm.*\n\n*There’s a story about this; Martínez had been so good in spring training in 1993, he couldn’t believe it when the Dodgers sent him down. It was not unlike hearing those scouts bash him when he was standing under that window in the Dominican Republic. He was standing by the bus and he was close to tears when suddenly Dodgers star pitcher Orel Hershiser came off the bus. He handed Martínez a baseball and went back on.\n\nOn the ball, it said: “You’re a true big leaguer. I’ll see you soon. Orel.”\n\nMartínez pitched in relief in 1993, and he was pretty spectacular. He struck out 119 batters in 107 innings and allowed the league to hit just .201 and slug just .283 against him. Dodgers executive Fred Claire was so awed by young Martínez’s arm and presence that he told everyone to stop even asking him about the trade rumors.\n\n“I won’t trade Pedro Martínez,” he told a reporter from the Ocala Star-Banner. “I don’t care who they offer.”\n\nClaire then traded Martínez to Montreal for Delino DeShields.\n\nWhat the heck happened? What makes teams trade away once-in-a-lifetime stars like Martínez? For the Dodgers, it came down to a couple of things. One, they really wanted a second baseman. They had made an offer during the season to their regular second baseman, Jody Reed, but they couldn’t reach an agreement (it didn’t go well for Reed either, who became a free agent and signed for a huge pay cut with Milwaukee).\n\n“If he had said ‘yes’ to our offer,” Claire said of Reed, “we would not have traded for a second baseman.”\n\nAnd DeShields had been pretty good for Montreal at second base in 1993 — he hit .295 with 72 walks, he stole 43 bases, he was an above-average defender. No, he would never be that good with the Dodgers, but Claire didn’t know that at the time of the trade.\n\nBut the bigger thing was this: They totally whiffed on Martínez. They had seen the arm. They had seen the confidence. They had seen the feistiness — which, yes, sometimes seemed over-the-top. They knew what Martínez was about … and they just could not see that he was about to become one of the greatest starting pitchers in baseball history. How did they miss it?\n\nWell, it seems, they simply let a bunch of old scouting methods impact their thinking. Scouts thought he was too small — not even 6 feet tall! Scouts thought he was too slight — he would probably end up in the bullpen! Scouts thought he was too volatile a personality — he might implode! Scouts thought his delivery was too violent — an injury hazard!\n\nThere are always reasons to doubt. It’s always safer to doubt.\n\nBut then you trade Martínez for DeShields and it wrecks your franchise for a generation. That’s not an exaggeration. From 1994 to 2003, the Dodgers were often good but never good enough. They twice made the playoffs but didn’t win a single playoff game. They brought in an international field of talented young pitchers — Hideo Nomo (Japan), Chan Ho Park (South Korea), Ismael Valdéz (Mexico), Pedro Astacio (Dominican Republic), Darren Dreifort (Kansas) and, of course, Ramón — but never found their ace.\n\nAnd Martínez became the greatest pitcher in the game.\n\nWhat made Martínez so great? It is one of baseball’s most challenging and wonderful puzzles. There are obvious pieces there. He had a good fastball, a great changeup and brilliant control, he was a ferocious competitor, etc.\n\nBut how do those pieces add up to make PEDRO MARTÍNEZ, all capital letters, as he was from 1997 to 2003? He was not of this world. In a time when hitters dominated the game, when home runs sailed, Martínez went 118-36 with a 2.20 ERA (with an unprecedented 213 ERA+) and 1,761 strikeouts against 315 walks, and hitters hit .198 against him with a .297 slugging percentage.\n\nHow good was he? Well, look at him through the FanGraphs prism — you probably know that FanGraphs evaluates pitchers based on how many strikeouts, how many walks and how many home runs they allow. By those measures, Martínez’s 1999 has an argument as the greatest season ever. He struck out 313, walked 37 and allowed only nine homers all year. By FanGraphs’ WAR, it’s the second-greatest season of the last century behind only Steve Carlton’s famous 1972 season.\n\nOr look at him through the Baseball-Reference prism — you probably know that Baseball-Reference evaluates pitchers based on how many runs they allow, the ballpark where they play and how good the defense is behind them. Well, by those measures, Martínez’s 2000 season has an argument as the greatest ever. That year, he had a 1.74 ERA (when the league-wide ERA was 4.92), struck out 284 in 217 innings, and walked 32, even fewer than he had in 1999. His ERA+ of 291 that year is the highest in modern baseball history by a long shot.\n\nHighest ERA+ in baseball history\n\nPedro Martínez, 2000, 291\n\nDutch Leonard, 1914, 279\n\nGreg Maddux, 1994, 271\n\nMaddux, 1995, 260\n\nWalter Johnson, 1913, 259\n\nIn the last 100 years, only four pitchers — each of whom threw many more innings — had a higher Baseball-Reference WAR than Martínez’s 11.7.\n\nSo, how does a puzzle like that come together? Did Martínez have the greatest fastball in history? No. The greatest slider or curveball? No. The greatest changeup? Well, that was one heart-stopping changeup, but no, probably not the greatest. Was he the most intimidating pitcher ever? He was intimidating — who can forget him plunking Cincinnati’s Reggie Sanders late in a perfect game? — but, I mean, so were Bob Gibson and Don Drysdale and Randy Johnson and a bunch of others.\n\nSo what separated him? What took him to his own planet?\n\nBill James has a theory. He calls it the power of exponentials in “The New Baseball Abstract.”\n\n“How can he be so much better than the other pitchers? His fastball is good, but there are 20 or 50 people in the league who throw just as hard. His curve isn’t better than anyone else’s … but he is vastly better in toto because he has some additional factors — his ability to change his arm angle, his ability to change speeds on all of his pitches without losing control — which interact to make geometric combinations.”\n\nI like to compare it with the story of the rice and the chessboard. There are countless versions of the legend, but the way I always heard it was that a man saved the king’s life and, in return, wanted to marry his daughter. The king said no but offered anything else in his kingdom. So the man pulled out a chessboard and said, “Then all I want is this. Give me one grain of rice for the first square on the board, then double it for every square after that — one piece of rice for the first square, two for the second, four for the third, eight for the fourth until the end of the board.”\n\nIt seems so little to ask. The king says yes … but you know how this ends. There are 64 squares on a chessboard. By the 21st square, simply by doubling, we are over a million grains of rice.\n\nBy the 30th, we have crossed a billion.\n\nAt the 39th square, the number is larger than a trillion.\n\nBy square 64, the number is 9,223,372,036,854,780,000 — which is not quite as many stars there are estimated to be in the galaxy, but close enough that you could almost count off the difference. It is more rice than there is in the known universe.\n\nAnd so Martínez’s skills are the grains of rice that keep doubling. You start with a mid-to-high-90s fastball, that’s already the core of an excellent pitcher. Now double it because of Martínez’s absurd command. Now double it again because he had that time-stopping changeup. Now double it again because he could mix in a cut fastball that worked like a slider and make hitters chase doom into the dirt. Now double it again because he was an intense competitor who insisted that the inside of the plate belonged to him. Now double it again because he came at hitters with all sorts of different arm angles, leaving them to wonder where the ball would come from next.\n\nNow double it again because nobody in baseball history — nobody at all — was more confident, more sure, more certain about his greatness than Martínez.\n\nNow double it again because …\n\nIt is true that Martínez was mostly done at 33. He did not quite get to 3,000 innings for his career. The fact he won 219 games (against 100 losses) probably cost him a few Hall of Fame votes — he didn’t appear on 49 ballots — even though it is really unimportant. It is true, Martínez did not have the huge numerical careers of his great contemporaries Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens or Greg Maddux.\n\nBut at his best, he was better than they were, I think. I’ve said it before; if the Devil ever gives me one pitcher to play for my soul, I’m taking Martínez circa 1999 and 2000. He wasn’t just the greatest pitcher I ever saw. He was the one pitcher who you knew would damn well move the devil off the plate.\n\nNote: Portions of this series were adapted from previous work that originated on my personal blog.\n\nCheck out the complete series on this topic page"
