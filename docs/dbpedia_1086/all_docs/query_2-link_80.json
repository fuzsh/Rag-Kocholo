        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio — Utility man Angel Martinez had a great spring training, but his chances of breaking camp with the big league club were ruined when he fouled a ball off his right foot.\n\nThings were further hampered when Martinez broke the hamate bone in his left hand a few days into his minor league season. On Friday, however, the Guardians recalled the switch-hitting Martinez from Class AAA Columbus after placing fellow infielder Gabriel Arias on the family medical emergency list.\n\nMore Guardians coverage\n\nIt’s all over but the watching and sweating: Guardians breakfast\n\nGuardians, Kansas City Royals series preview, starting pitching matchups\n\nGuardians take advantage of opportunities in 4-2 win against Rangers\n\nMartinez, 22, was hitting .333 (20 for 60) with four doubles, three homers and 11 RBI in 17 games in two tours with Columbus. He went 4 for 4 with two homers and four RBI on Tuesday for the Clippers.\n\nAfter hitting .389 (7 for 18) with one homer and five RBI in spring training, Martinez opened the season on the injured list because of his bruised foot. He was activated and optioned to Columbus in April, but after playing just three games suffered a broken hamate bone in his left hand that required surgery.\n\nMartinez, like Arias, can play all over the diamond. In Columbus this season he started games at third base, second base, shortstop, center fielder and DH. Manager Stephen Vogt told reporters before Friday’s game the thing that stood out most about Martinez from spring training, though, was his smile.\n\n“This is a kid that is just happy all the time and he had a great spring before he got hurt and we’re happy he’s here,” Vogt said. “He’s earned it and we’re excited.”\n\nVogt said Martinez is another versatile player who keeps Cleveland’s roster flexible.\n\n“The versatility he brings to both sides of the plate, he can drive the ball, he could play six different positions on the field,” Vogt said “It’s always exciting.”\n\nCleveland signed the native of the Dominican Republic as an international free agent in 2018. He has played in 410 minor league games at five different levels. He is the son of former catcher Sandy Martinez, who played 218 games in the big leagues, one with the Indians in 2004.\n\nMartinez, who will wear jersey No. 1, said he benefitted tremendously from watching his father’s career in the big leagues as he grew up.\n\n“Knowing that he’s been through all these stages that you go through and becoming a minor leaguer and being supported and getting the help you need, I feel that’s kind of a dream come true to have somebody who’s been through what I’ve been through,” Martinez said via Guardians interpreter Agustin Rivero. “I know he’s my unconditional support and kind of like my superhero in a way.”\n\nTeams are allowed to place a player “experiencing a family emergency or the death of a loved one on the Family Medical Emergency list with permission from the commissioner’s office. The player may spend between three and seven days on the list, and during that period, his club may replace him on the active 26-man roster.”\n\nArias has not played since June 12 against the Reds. He’s hitting .214 (27 for 126) with seven doubles, two homers and 11 RBI. He’s struck out 43 times and walked five.\n\nHe has started games at second, third, shortstop, left field, right field, center field and DH."
