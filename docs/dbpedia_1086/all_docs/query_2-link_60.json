        "text": "On Thursdays, Luis Martinez plays soccer for Los Catrachos.\n\nThe team name is a nod to his heritage. Martinez is from Honduras, where \"Catrachos” is the nickname of the people and their national team. He arrived here in 2015 with his single mother in search of a better life.\n\n“It was a very difficult situation in Honduras in my city,” Martinez said. “I think many of (my friends) ended up in gangs.”\n\nTo stay above the fray, he played soccer. From the time he was 6 years old, he trained with the youth teams in his hometown of Siguatepeque, which is nestled in the mountains between San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa.\n\nMartinez didn’t speak English when he enrolled at Eastside Memorial High School and found it difficult to adapt to his new world. He turned to soccer again and found a community of kids facing similar challenges who shared a common love of the world’s game. On the Eastside Memorial campus is the Austin school district’s International High School, which provides an intensive English program for ninth and 10th grade immigrant and refugee students from across the district.\n\nThe school’s soccer team won its second straight District 26-4A championship this spring. Martinez starred, scoring 12 goals, dishing 13 assists and asserting himself as the best player in nearly every match.\n\nBut now, the Thursday matches with Los Catrachos — on the bumpy, sandy pitches at Northeast Metropolitan Park in Pflugerville — are the only ones he has access to. For a variety of reasons, college soccer isn’t an option.\n\n“It might not be culturally feasible or the infrastructure isn’t there to transition them to the college level,” Eastside Memorial coach Joshua Zapata said of the situation many of his players, including his All-Central Texas midfielder, find themselves in after high school.\n\n“A lot of the concerns that they have aren’t being answered. Who is going to watch out for Luis’ little brothers and sisters? It’s easy on the outside to say, ‘Go to college. Go to college.’ ”\n\nMartinez wants to keep playing. It’s all he’s ever known. Without the game, he admitted, he probably wouldn’t have had much incentive to finish high school. Later this month, he’ll receive his diploma.\n\nSo what’s next? Martinez’s face contorts as he ponders the question. He’s never been in a position to make long-term plans. Every day is its own adventure. If he were good enough to play for the best club teams in town, he didn’t know they existed, and they never came knocking.\n\n“Here it is more difficult because we need a lot of money” to play, he said. “I play mostly with my family and friends. I’m looking for a university to keep playing, but I don’t know yet. I need to work, so it’s very difficult to get an opportunity. We need to have money.”\n\nMartinez works a landscaping job on the weekends, and plays for Los Catrachos and a men’s league team. Despite his and his teammates’ achievements, he didn’t receive any individual accolades from the district coaches. Eastside Memorial has scored more than 150 goals and allowed only 20 the past three seasons, but its players have received only four district superlatives.\n\nUntil a recent interview, Martinez and Zapata knew little about the new professional teams in town, Austin Bold FC in the USL Championship and Austin FC, which will launch as a Major League Soccer expansion team in 2021.\n\n“We’re almost landlocked over here on the east side,” Zapata said. “There’s not much exposure to what we’re doing. It’s almost like you’re on a little island by yourself. How are they going to be exposed to these opportunities if they don’t know what the options are?”\n\nBoth pro franchises have touted increased opportunities for young players, especially those who can’t afford the pay-to-play model. Organizations such as Upper Ninety — a soccer-focused youth development program for low-income Austinites — are doing their best to fill the void, but all of these initiatives are in their infancy.\n\nZapata just wants them to know that players like Martinez exist. He might not be ready for college, but he’s come a long way since arriving in Austin.\n\n“There’s no easy answers,” Zapata said. “That’s why I hope the teams popping up give these guys opportunities to be seen.”"
