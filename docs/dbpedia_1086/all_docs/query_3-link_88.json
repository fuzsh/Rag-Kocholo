        "text": "Since taking the job, Mets general manager Jared Porter, among other things, has emphasized a need to build roster depth.\n\n\"Those smaller decisions that you make are sometimes just as important as the big ones,\" Porter said during a recent interview with SiriusXM NHL Network Radio.\n\nA potential example: The Mets on Thursday announced they signed Jose Martinez to a one-year contract. Martinez is a first baseman, outfielder and designated hitter whose bat greatly exceeds his defensive ability.\n\nAccording to USA TODAY Sports' Bob Nightengale, Martinez is receiving a split contract that will pay him $1 million plus $500,000 in potential incentives if he makes the major league roster.\n\nThis move is not as flashy as acquiring Francisco Lindor and Carlos Carrasco, or potential signings of George Springer or Brad Hand. But can it help the Mets?\n\nLINEUP: Projected Mets lineup, rotation after Francisco Lindor, Carlos Carrasco trade\n\nIt's possible.\n\nHere are three things to know:\n\nHow Martinez could fit on big league roster\n\nIf you knew Martinez was a first baseman and outfielder, your first question was probably: How the heck does he fit on this team?\n\nFair.\n\nThe Mets have two first basemen in Pete Alonso and Dominic Smith. Martinez likely wouldn't play there.\n\nIn the outfield, metrics say he is not good. Per FanGraphs' defensive runs saved metric, Martinez has cost his team runs with his outfield defense in every year of his career that he's played there. And recently, president Sandy Alderson said it wouldn't be ideal to play Smith — who isn't a natural outfielder — in left field, so why would the Mets throw Martinez in the outfield?\n\nWell, his value comes as a potential designated hitter — if the universal DH were to return — or bench bat.\n\nIf you take out a rough 2020, Martinez slashed .298/.363/.458 with 41 homers from 2016-19 with the Cardinals. Perhaps more importantly: Martinez, now 32, has a .915 OPS against lefties over his career, which would make him a valuable bench bat if the Mets had room.\n\nNY METS: 3 thoughts on Francisco Lindor trade and where they stand in NL East\n\nOrganizational depth\n\nDepth, depth, depth. Even as Alderson has discussed the Mets shopping in the gourmet aisle, he and Porter have pointed to trying to fill out the organization.\n\nMore specifically, Alderson in November said the Mets were thin in the upper minors. If he doesn't make the big league club, Martinez could be a veteran minor leaguer in their system, someone who could always be recalled if needed.\n\nIf you're looking at first base, the Mets may not have much of a plan past Alonso and Smith. They don't have any highly touted prospects who are first basemen —definitely no one who would be ready anytime soon.\n\nSigning Martinez is a good way for the Mets to ensure they're covered at first base, even if he doesn't make the major league\n\nPlus, this is low-risk for the Mets. Martinez's contract will only pay the $1 million if he makes the big league roster.\n\nWhy not give him a shot?\n\nPart of a trade that looks bigger now\n\nRandy Arozarena. That name ring a bell?\n\nWell, Martinez was part of the deal you heard about all throughout last postseason. He and Arozarena went to the Rays in the trade.\n\nIt was, by no means, a blockbuster.\n\nIt just looks much bigger now because Arozarena took center stage and dominated during a postseason run, fueling the Rays to the World Series.\n\nJustin Toscano is the Mets beat writer for NorthJersey.com.
