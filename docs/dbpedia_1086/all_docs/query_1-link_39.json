        "text": "Should you hire a former athlete with no professional experience? I was a high-performance athlete for more than half my life, successfully balancing my studies, professional life, and athletic career. However, when the time came to prioritize, I chose to focus on the path I believed was best for me, gradually leaving behind my athletic dream. I understand that not everyone has made the same choices. Some pursued even bigger dreams, while others had no other option. Unfortunately, life can change course for various reasons, forcing some athletes to leave their athletic careers behind and start another life, facing new challenges. Many of these athletes begin their professional careers at an unconventional age, making it harder for them to be considered for positions. If you are part of a hiring team, I encourage you to give these talented individuals an opportunity to join your company. I am confident they will exceed your expectations. If you are not convinced whether this is good idea, here are some reasons to consider hiring them: 1. Athletes are accustomed to fulfilling long-term commitments. 2. Discipline is an integral part of their personality. 3. They have a results-oriented mindset, that will lead to high efficiency for your team. 4. They excel under high-pressure situations. 5. They are effective team players. 6. They will bring innovative and fresh perspectives from their diverse experiences. 7. We’ve all experienced the challenges of the first job hunting; maybe your next high performer is out there waiting for the opportunity to shine :) I might not be that kind of an athlete anymore, but I understand the struggle of changing paths and don’t know where to start. P.S.: If you are a former athlete and don’t know where to start, I’d be happy to do my best to help you. :) #newhires #athlete #opentowork #sports #jobopportunity"
