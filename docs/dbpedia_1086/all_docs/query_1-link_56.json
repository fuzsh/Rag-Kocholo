        "text": "Drew Martinez started 162 of his 163 career games for Memphis. Martinez was a two-time Second-Team All-Conference USA selection (2010-11) and was also named to the 2009 Conference USA All-Freshman Team. His 2010 campaign was one for the record books, when he led the team, C-USA and ranked 29th nationally with 98 hits. He also led the Tigers and ranked fifth in the league with his 62 runs scored. Martinez’s 98 hits, 260 at-bats and 22-game hit streak in 2010 all rank second all-time on Memphis’ single-season lists. For his career, Martinez batted .342 with 152 runs scored, 237 hits, 35 doubles, five triples, 78 RBI and 48 stolen bases.\n\nAfter being taken in the 23rd round (692nd pick) in the 2010 MLB Draft by the New York Mets, Martinez returned to Memphis for the 2011 campaign. Following his third season, he was selected in the 10th round (315th pick) in the 2011 MLB Draft by the Angels. Martinez played six seasons professionally in the minor leagues, reaching as high as the AA level."
