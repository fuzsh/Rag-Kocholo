        "text": "Join us in congratulating Sandy Martinez as our “2017 Employee of the Year”!\n\nSandy – who has been with us since 2015 – is the Team Leader at our East Charlotte office where she serves as Team Leader and front desk associate. She was among 17 DOC employees nominated for the award, which honors a staff person for: being productive and committed to their job; taking initiative; being dependable and reliable; having a positive attitude; and providing excellent customer service and patient care.\n\n“We are proud to have Sandy among our DOC family and to honor her with this well-deserved recognition,” said Clark Hammock, DMD, P.A., executive vice president/C.B.O. of Dentistry of the Carolinas. “In addition to being the backbone for our East Charlotte location, she keeps the team motivated and successful, is an extremely hard worker and our patients love her.”\n\nOriginally from Honduras, Sandy lived in New York and moved to Charlotte nine years ago. In her spare time, she enjoys: spending time with family; watching “The Office” and “That ‘70s Show; cheering on her beloved Washington Redskins; reading comics and playing video games. She resides in Charlotte with her three boys – ages 8, 7 and 5 – and two pet turtles, Zelda and Ampersand."
