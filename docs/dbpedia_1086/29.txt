Josef MartÃ­nez scored his 100th goal for the club on Wednesday, adding more to his exceptional legacy.

At 125 club appearances, he becomes the fastest player in MLS history to reach 100 goals. Robbie Keane is the next fastest, scoring his first 100 goals for L.A. Galaxy in 156 games.

MartÃ­nez came into Wednesday with 99 goals in all competitions. No. 100 came in the 78th minute on a penalty kick after a handball on Inter Miami. He scored no. 99 in the 64th minute against D.C. United on September 18.

The club MartÃ­nez has scored the most goals (8) against remains Orlando City. Heâs scored seven goals against Philadelphia Union and D.C. United.

Goal no. 100 was his second all-time against Inter Miami.

"I want to say thank you to my teammates, the ones that are here and the players that were here before, and everyone working at Atlanta United and also for my city because they mean a lot," MartÃ­nez said.

MartÃ­nez is one of the fastest players in the world to score 100 goals with one club, which puts his name on a list that includes some of the sportâs best players. Cristiano Ronaldo scored 100 goals in 105 games for Real Madrid, Luiz Suarez scored 100 goals in 120 games for Barcelona and Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored 100 goals in 124 games for Paris Saint-Germain.

Heâs just the 16th player in MLS history to reach 100 goals in all competitions and only the 5th player to do it with one club.

"Six months ago I didn't know if this would be possible," Martinez said. "But I play the game because I love to win, and I'm really grateful to have been able to have this opportunity."
