        "text": "With a spot-on cast and a tight, hilarious script that literally and figuratively sings, “Pitch Perfect” captures the insular culture of university a cappella competitions with geeky, freaky glee. Oscar nominee Anna Kendrick (“Up in the Air”) leads the cast as the outsider who brings edge and snark to a flailing singing group, but it is a testament to this surprisingly strong comedy that nearly every major actor in “Pitch Perfect” is performing at her level.\n\nThen again, given the pedigrees of the writer and the director, we should have seen this coming. “Pitch Perfect” was written by Kay Cannon, a producer and supervising writer for “30 Rock,” and this comedy bangs along with the same confidence seen and heard in Tina Fey's series. Furthermore, it is the first-time screen directorial work by Jason Moore, who directed the viciously funny Muppets satire “Avenue Q” on Broadway. Moore and Cannon make every laugh a loud one.\n\nKendrick's Beca got strong-armed into enrolling at Barden University by her professor dad, and if she had a choice, Beca would rather be making beats and mixing with David Guetta than mixing with the nerds at Barden. It is a school where a cappella groups hold sway over the campus population: Barden enjoys a long and storied dominance over such competitions and boasts two competing groups: the male Treblemakers and the all-female Bellas.\n\nLed by overconfident dweeb Bumper (the hilarious Adam DeVine of “Workaholics”), the Treblemakers are cocky but fully deserving of their winning streak. In contrast, the Bellas are vocally great but hemmed in by their staid repertoire (Ace of Base's “The Sign,” Vicki Sue Robinson's “Turn the Beat Around”) and flight attendant wardrobe. The Bellas also suffered an embarrassing defeat the previous season when domineering leader Aubrey (Anna Camp) projectile vomited at the previous year's regional finals, driving away most of their best singers.\n\nBeca can sing, and just as importantly, she has good instincts. So she joins in reluctant harmony when the Bellas' most enthusiastic recruiter, Chloe (Brittany Snow), pulls in an awkward group of new members, including the self-named Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson of “Bridesmaids”), statuesque sex enthusiast Stacie (Alexis Knapp), bold lesbian Cynthia Rose (played by Muskogee-born singer-songwriter Ester Dean) and creepy “quiet talker” Lilly (comedian Hana Mae Lee). The tension pivots on whether Beca can bring anything remotely current and edgy to the Bellas' struggling performances and fall backward into a relationship with devoted Treblemaker Jesse (Skylar Astin).\n\nAnd that is a fairly standard predicament, but placed in the context of a cappella competitions, “Pitch Perfect” is anything but ordinary. Everyone is hitting the right notes in this comedy, but the standout player is definitely Wilson, who gets the best of Cannon's omnipresent killer lines and sings, struts and steals the show with magnetism and self-possession. “Bridesmaids” called attention to this comedian's unusual talents, but “Pitch Perfect” will probably make Wilson a star.\n\nCannon and Moore clearly have affection for the setting and source material (“Pitch Perfect” is based on GQ magazine writer Mickey Rapkin's nonfiction book about competitive a cappella), which makes the film's comedy feel genuine. This is not a “Glee” knockoff: “Pitch Perfect” is having too much fun for that."
