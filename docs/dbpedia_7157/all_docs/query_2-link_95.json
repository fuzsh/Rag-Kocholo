        "text": "We open on a multi-million dollar yacht. Not a cold open, but a fade-in from the cappella-arranged Universal theme to a rendition of Britney Spears’s “Toxic.” An explosion follows, with Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) propelling through the glass ceiling, extinguishing the three mystery audience members as the rest of the Barden Bellas jump ship.\n\nIf only movie-goers could, as well.\n\nThis was the beginning — and end — to Pitch Perfect 3, the final (hopefully) movie in the Pitch Perfect series. The movie flatlined on many viewers, with only a 31 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes after its first week in theaters.\n\nThe third installment of the franchise will be remembered as the outlier, the “other,” and maybe even “the one where it all went wrong.”\n\nWe learn early on after Beca (Anna Kendrick) quits her job that she is also no longer seeing Jesse, in an awkwardly presented conversation with Amy. She adds that she and Bumper are no longer together.\n\nThere is no connection to Barden University, where the Bellas call their home, aside from the “reunion” that was scheduled to bring everyone together. Upon reuniting with the rest of the old gang in a non-exciting and trivial way, they all soon learned that the reunion wasn’t a singing gig, but an invitation to watch the modern and exciting new generation of Bellas.\n\nThis brings about nostalgia, as the entire group of singers seemed to have hit a rut in their lives all at the same time. And you guessed it, their plans were all resolved at the same time later on in the film, after being blown out of a yacht.\n\nIn this film’s comeback, the Bellas joined the USO Tour, due to a connection with Aubrey’s (Anna Camp) military father, along with three other acts. The “competition” culminated with the winning group getting the chance to open for DJ Khaled, the host of the tour. Booking DJ Khaled for this movie was a boost for fans like me, but also smells of a desparate need to make this movie popular in the mainstream.\n\nOne of the most audience-capturing and memorable inventions of the Pitch Perfect series is the “riff-off” where groups go back and forth singing songs to a continuous beat. Well, even that was compromised by this movie, with what I assume was meant to be a satirical take on the idea, where the Bellas try to explain it to the other groups, who all use their instruments and just can’t seem to grasp the idea. (Comedy?)\n\nMashed into the story is Fat Amy discovering her estranged father, who tricks her into thinking he’s there for her, when he really just needs her to access Amy’s $100+ million trust fund. The movie, or the series for that matter, offers no explanation of their situation, but just expects you to jump on board with what is happening.\n\nYou’re also taken along the ride of the “maybe-it-will-maybe-it-won’t-happen” relationship of Theo (Guy Burnet), an assitant and label executive for DJ Khaled, and Beca, whom he sees potential in. Their awkward-at-times flirting episodes lead up to the awkward resolution: nothing. The love affair between Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Chicago (Matt Lanter), the army escort for the Bellas, is teased throughout the movie, with their resolution saved for the end credits.\n\nThe Pitch Perfect series started with a semi-nobody cast. Kendrick was only known for her role in the Twilight series and others like Snow and Wilson were only known for small supporting roles. The movie capitalized on this, allowing for the storyline to be the real star: a broken down a cappella group led by a senior who gets her last chance at a national championship, just months after causing the derailment of last year’s competition, rebuilding their brand and their sound. The second movie continues this story on a higher level: the Barden Bellas squeeze themselves into the world championship, facing off against groups that live and breathe a cappella. They also add a new member, allowing a new perspective on joining the age-old group now in full-swing. The first sequal even connects the current Bellas to the generations of singers that came before.\n\nThe success of the second movie was reliant on the connections to the roots of the Bellas and the Barden a cappella scene. To anyone who knows anything about a cappella groups, one in a million actually go out and tour around the world. Furthermore, college a cappella groups usually do not stay together after school. (Unless you’re Andy Bernard). To squander a living connection, Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), the only physical connection to the Barden Bellas, was only a minor character in the third movie, after being the centerpiece of Pitch Perfect 2. Her love interest Benji (Ben Platt), wasn’t even mentioned.\n\nWhen viewers were brought back to the scene where Fat Amy escapes from her father’s yacht, the spirit of the Bellas had already been lost on the audience. After the ordeal, the girls sit around and talk about how their problems are suddenly resolved, in between traveling across Europe, singing on a tour, and being held for ransom. Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) decides to speak at a normal volume, and revels that her real name is Esther. The Bellas were surprised, even though she spoke normally towards the end of the first movie. Oh, and Beca gets a record deal after messing around with some beats on DJ Khaled’s computer, just as she did with Snoop Dogg in the second movie.\n\nPitch Perfect 3 was full of old jokes and past references, delivered in awkward fashion to a world that the origin story had nothing to do with. It shoved together disconnected plot lines as if this was a reboot of a 30-year-old franchise. It begs the question of why they deviated so far from the success formula of the first two films.\n\nDo yourself a favor and jump ship, too."
