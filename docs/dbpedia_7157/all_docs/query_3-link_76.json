        "text": "Chad White\n\nLoves: The first Pitch Perfect, the cast, Kay Cannon\n\nLikes: Some of DJ Khaled’s songs\n\nDislikes: Bad Kay Cannon projects, Pitch Perfect 2\n\nHates: No cameos?!\n\nI am really a very simple person.\n\nNever since The Hangover 3 has a third movie in a declining franchise ever had to be made. And much like that movie, it serves as a low point for the franchise. There are no memorable moments and any such attempt halts all form of progression about a group of girls focused on the past rather than the future. In short, Pitch Perfect 3 is an abomination of sorts with less than a tenth of the personality the original film managed to display.\n\nThis time out, the Barton Bellas are all living separate lives in New York, each trying to regain a part of what they lost when they graduated. The only ones that keep in touch are roommates Beca (Anna Kendrick), Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) and Chloe (Brittany Snow). Beca quits her job as music producer when she finds her clientele less than ideal. This and other setbacks in their lives only make the girls want to get back together that much more. They do and manage to land on a USO Tour courtesy of Aubrey’s (Anna Camp) dad.\n\nOne of the main issues with the film resides in its storytelling. Franchise creator Kay Cannon is joined by Mike White this time out and nothing pays off for them. While it’s admirable to give each character their own story, development and so forth, it’s also worth noting how hard that can be for a dozen of them. At any given moment the camera could focus on Aubrey and Fat Amy’s daddy issues while shoehorning in three (!) separate romances. That’s right; THREE. If the 93-minute runtime didn’t cause concern before, it should now. Also, fans of DJ Khaled will be delighted to see he plays a role - too big of a role - in the movie. This entire charade is steeped in pop culture from 2010.\n\nAs for callbacks and references, Pitch Perfect 3 performs well. Cannon and White’s script does right by the original and its sequel with shots at the Bellas losing of riff offs they instigate or how Hailee Steinfeld’s Emily is a constant source of verbal assault from Wilson’s Fat Amy. On the subject of riff offs, the other bands introduced via the USO Tour only play a part for what feels like less than half the movie. In a scene that is as enjoyable as you can make it, three bands take on the Bellas and it’s admittedly fun to watch. One band is considered an antagonist and subsequently dropped after one concert.\n\nDirector Trish Sie’s eye for cinema is not as defined as previous series director Elizabeth Banks. This is Sie’s first big leap into this level of film and she shows her hand more often than she should. Tons of static shots with nothing going on don’t help get jokes across. Even though the gang is on a world tour, nothing feels as big as even the second movie. Sound stages and green screen can be picked out as soon as they appear on screen (anything on John Lithgow’s boat is disgustingly amateurish). It’s a shame.\n\nShould you watch Pitch Perfect 3?\n\nWhy does this movie exist? And since it exists, why is it so poorly made? Pitch Perfect 3 is a disappointment from start to finish.\n\nNotes:"
