        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\n\"Pitch Perfect\" was released 10 years ago on September 28.\n\nThe musical comedy led to two sequels, a bump in a cappella popularity, and the rise of Ben Platt.\n\nHere are 15 details you might've missed in the three films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElizabeth Banks' character Gail Abernathy-McKadden-Feinberg's name is a sly nod to \"The Hunger Games.\"\n\nBanks, of course, played stylist Effie Trinket in \"The Hunger Games\" films, alongside Woody Harrelson as one of Katniss' mentors, Haymitch Abernathy. Many fans shipped Haymitch and Effie, so giving Banks' announcer character the last name of Abernathy was a nod to those \"Hunger Games\" devotees.\n\n\"Pitch Perfect\" wasn't actor John Michael Higgins' first foray into the world of a cappella.\n\nHiggins, who plays fellow announcer John Smith in \"Pitch Perfect,\" also played a member of the a cappella group The Tone Rangers in 2006's \"The Break-Up\" — perhaps the directors saw that film and knew they needed him for \"Pitch Perfect.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Riff-Off wheel had many hilarious categories that weren't sung in the film, like Ugly Lead Singers, Songs \"Glee\" Ruined, and Overplayed Black Eyed Peas Songs.\n\nWe hear the groups sing Ladies of the '80s and Songs About Sex, but there are plenty more categories we miss out on, like Black Michael Jackson, White Michael Jackson, Christian Rock, Hair Bands, Reggae Time, Famous Duets, Puppet Songs, and Party Rock Anthems.\n\nThere's also TV Theme Songs, which might be a nod to actor Adam Devine's audition song for the film — he sang the \"Full House\" theme song to land his part as Bumper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the Riff-Off, Cynthia sings \"S&M.\" In real life, the song was written by Ester Dean ... the actress who plays Cynthia.\n\nDean was (and still is) a prolific songwriter before getting cast in \"Pitch Perfect, with songs like \"Rude Boy,\" \"Super Bass,\" \"Firework,\" \"What's My Name?,\" \"Countdown,\" and \"Where Have You Been\" under her belt.\n\nDean also wrote \"S&M,\" which she gets to break out during the Riff-Off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe weird adult video in the background of this scene was actually created by Elizabeth Banks.\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Banks, she directed the adult film that the Treblemakers are seemingly watching together in the hot tub.\n\n\"It was the craziest casting call I've ever been a part of. There was no one else to direct it. It felt really skeezy to be like, 'Hey Baton Rouge ladies, come on down to the Crowne Plaza Baton Rouge in your underwear and let me film you,''' Banks told Jimmy Kimmel in 2012.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Tone Hangers in the first film are all famous actors or musicians.\n\nIn the first movie, the Tone Hangers consist of \"Scrubs\" star Donald Faison, \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" star Joe Lo Truglio, former \"Daily Show\" correspondent Jason Jones, and musician Har Mar Superstar.\n\nIn \"Pitch Perfect 2,\" Har Mar Superstar and Faison are replaced by \"Late Late Show\" drummer Reggie Watts and another former \"Daily Show\" contributor, John Hodgman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor is just one of the many who sent Fat Amy hate mail in \"Pitch Perfect 2.\"\n\nThe scene suggests Justice Sotomayor took the time to cut out every individual letter from magazines to construct her letter ... but couldn't resist signing her name.\n\nBeca has an X Ambassadors poster in her room in the second film. The band's song \"Jungle\" was used in trailers for the movie.\n\nYou can hear the song in this trailer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKay Cannon, the screenwriter for all three films, has an on-screen cameo in \"Pitch Perfect 2.\"\n\nCannon plays a morning show host, Connie, who covers Fat Amy's accidental flashing of the president on her show at the beginning of the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPentatonix, perhaps the most famous a cappella group in pop culture, appears in a scene of \"Pitch Perfect 2.\"\n\nThe five-person group represented Canada at the a cappella world championships.\n\nPenn Masala, another famous a cappella group, is also part of the film representing India.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs do the Green Bay Packers ... and a \"Bachelorette\" contestant!\n\nGreen Bay Packers players Clay Matthews, David Bakhtiari, TJ Lang, Josh Sitton, and Don Barclay all appeared in a scene of \"Pitch Perfect 2\" after Bakhtiari tweeted at the movie's director (and star) Elizabeth Banks.\n\nIf you look to the back left of the photo, you can also spot Jordan Rodgers, of JoJo Fletcher's season of \"The Bachelorette.\"\n\n\"Screw it, let's just do it,\" a line from the first film, makes its way back to \"Pitch Perfect 3.\"\n\nIn \"Pitch Perfect 3,\" the culmination of the a cappella trilogy, Beca's hasty pre-show huddle \"Screw it, let's just do it\" from the first film makes a comeback before the ladies' second performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Pitch Perfect 3,\" Lilly's passport states her place of birth as Area 51.\n\nDuring \"Pitch Perfect 3,\" when the Barden Bellas are traveling around the country, a close-up of Lilly's — the Barden Bella who is constantly saying strange things at a whisper — passport implies that she might be an alien. Her birthplace is listed as Area 51, the birthplace of all American conspiracy theories.\n\nOne of the Barden Bellas, Kelley Jakle, is an actual a cappella star. She appeared in all three films as Jessica.\n\nJakle was part of the University of Southern California's SoCal VoCals, which won the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella in 2008 and 2010 — the same competition the Barden Bellas compete at.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally — and this isn't a hidden detail, but a fun fact — Freddie Stroma's small part as Beca's boss at the radio station in the first movie got him his role on the HBO Max series \"Peacemaker.\"\n\nStroma revealed in 2022 that before James Gunn officially cast him as Adrian Chase/Vigilante on \"Peacemaker,\" the director reached out to his former \"Pitch Perfect\" castmate Elizabeth Banks.\n\n\"We did multiple scenes, and then he was like, 'I spoke to Elizabeth Banks,' because we did 'Pitch Perfect' together and knew each other,'\" Stroma told Looper. \"As James said, he was like, 'I did an a--hole check.' He was like, 'You always make sure, just in case.' I passed that, which is good. It was crazy to suddenly be working with James Gunn.\"\n\nRead next\n\ndetails you missed\n\nAdvertisement"
