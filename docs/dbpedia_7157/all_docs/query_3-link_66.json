        "text": "Listen up, pitches: Pitch Perfect is becoming a TV show!\n\nOn Tuesday, Sept. 21, Peacock confirmed that a TV adaptation of the beloved film franchise will be heading to the NBCUniversal streaming service. However, instead of the Barden Bellas, the OG vocal villain Bumper (Adam DeVine) will be front and center. Aca-scuse us?\n\nAccording to Peacock, the new Pitch Perfect will follow Bumper now, several years after his last appearance in Pitch Perfect 2. \"[He] moves to Germany to revive his music career,\" the streamer's description teased, \"when one of his songs becomes big in Berlin.\"\n\nAs for the rest of the cast? It's currently unclear whether Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin and others will participate. The women of Pitch Perfect did just reunite for a vacation, so, hopefully that means they're all still close enough to have cameos in the show."
