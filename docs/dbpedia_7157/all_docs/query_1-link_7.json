        "text": "For Pitch Perfect fans out there, the hype was real for another followup to the popular franchise starring the all-female musical ensemble the Barden Bellas. Thankfully, Pitch Perfect 3 didn’t disappoint, with the final instalment delivering a better-than-expected last call featuring riff offs, one liners and catchy tunes by The Barden Bellas that provoked constant howls of laughter from the audience.\n\nPitch Perfect 1 and 2 followed the loveable Beca (Anna Kendrick) as she joined The Barden Bellas, an all-female A capella group at Barden University. There, Beca met the likes of hilarious Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) and Chloe Beale (Brittany Snow) and began a relationship with Jesse Swanson (Skylar Austin) a member of another A capella group at Barden University, The Treblemakers. Throughout the two movies, the Bellas developed new friendships, sparked romantic relationships, humiliated themselves and A capella-ed their hearts out in over the top flashy (quite literally Fat Amy) performances to go on to win three championships in a row\n\nPitch Perfect 3 retained familiar faces such as Fat Amy, Beca and Chloe, but to many fans’ disappointment, Jesse and Beca’s relationship did not make it to this outing. However, the film brought out some famous faces like Ruby Rose, who plays Calamity, a fierce lead singer, and DJ Khaled, who plays himself and who’s opening act the Bellas are competing for. Pitch Perfect 3 delivered the expected hilarious jokes, explosive singing and over-the-top scenes typical of the franchise.\n\nPitch Perfect 3 started off with a (literally) explosive scene which was designed to make audiences think aca-what? This captivating introduction kept us on our toes throughout the entire film as it took us through the Bellas' new journey -- now College graduates -- taking on making A capella music for the last time on an overseas United Service Organisation tour in Spain. This go around, The Bellas are in fierce competition with real bands that write and perform their own songs (not like the Bellas who “only do covers”). Meanwhile, there is the underlying story of The Bellas shitty lives where they resent their new careers; Beca quits her music producer job, Chloe is trying to get into Vet school and Jessica and Ashley doing… actually, I’m not sure what Jessica and Ashley were doing. After a reunion that introduced the new, younger and hotter Bellas, the old Bellas, who continued to be stalked by the creepy likes of Gail and John, go on a journey of their A capella love one more time before they go into the big scary real world of adulting.\n\nOne surprising storyline brings some hilarious Australian humour, as we learn about Fat Amy’s past, and her filthy rich criminal father played by John Lithgow. Father-daughter relationships are subtly slipped into the film - Fat Amy and her father; Aubrey Posen (Anna Camp) and hers - to complement the themes of growing up and moving on. The story of Fat Amy’s father also added some laugh-out-loud humour. As usual, the film was greatly entertaining and satisfied our ears with covers of popular songs such as \"Toxic\" by Britney Spears, \"Ignition\" by R. Kelly and \"Wake Me Up\" by Avicii.\n\nPitch Perfect is back, and it's bigger and better this time. Ultimately, the movie was able give fans what we've always loved about the franchise: the focus on the relationships between the ensemble cast, and of course, the music! Pitch Perfect fans will be satisfied with this one. It is a huge improvement on its predecessor and rehashes themes from the first two while telling a fresh story with original characters, Acapella and humour.\n\n4/5 – Watch it, Pitches."
