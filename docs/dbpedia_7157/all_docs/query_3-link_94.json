        "text": "Pitch Perfect is getting a TV spin-off almost five years after the last film was released â€“ and one of the film's original stars is coming back for the ride too.\n\nThe series has been ordered by streaming service Peacock and will be set several years after the events of the final film, Variety has confirmed.\n\nAdam Devine, who played the antagonist and Fat Amy's (Rebel Wilson) love interest Bumper Allen in the films, will star in the series.\n\nRelated: Anna Kendrick lands next lead role in Marvel star's new movie\n\nPreviously, Bumper was the head of one of the main college a cappella groups, The Treblemakers, before leaving to become a backup singer for John Mayer. In the second film, he returns to Barden University to work as a security guard.\n\nThe new show will follow Bumper as he moves to Germany to revive his music career after one of his songs becomes a hit in Berlin.\n\nThe series will be executive produced by Elizabeth Banks, who starred in the three original films as a commentator for the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella and directed Pitch Perfect 2, while Devine is also on board as an executive producer.\n\nRelated: Jurassic Park and Pitch Perfect stars team up in new comedy\n\nMegan Amram is writing the series, having previously worked as a writer on NBC comedies The Good Place and Parks and Recreation. The series is being produced by Universal Television, which now operates under NBCUniversal.\n\n\"Our upcoming Pitch Perfect series is another example of the unmatched synergy NBCUniversal is able to expand upon with our wide-ranging library of IP,\" Susan Rovner, chairman of entertainment content for NBCUniversal Television and Streaming, told the publication.\n\n\"When we saw the opportunity to create a series for Pitch Perfect with [executive producers] Elizabeth Banks, Max Handelman and Paul Brooks plus more earworm classics for super fans to enjoy, we jumped at it.\n\nRelated: Pitch Perfect cast reunite but not in new sequel\n\n\"And to top it off, we are so fortunate that Adam Devine is headlining the series and bringing fans the quirky, laugh-out-loud sensibility they loved in the film franchise,\" she continued.\n\nA release date is yet to be announced."
