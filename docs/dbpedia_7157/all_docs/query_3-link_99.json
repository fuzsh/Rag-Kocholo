        "text": "In a case of “yesterday’s news today,” Elizabeth Banks is apparently in talks to direct Red Queen. The Universal/ Comcast Corp. release is apparently the first in a young adult fantasy franchise (or YAFF). You can go here for plot information, but it seems like pretty standard YAFF fare. The film appears to be a relatively mid-to-high budget fantasy picture with special effects a-plenty. This is good news for obvious reasons. When Pitch Perfect 2 opened with $69 million last month, I wondered out loud if Ms. Banks would get the kind of directorial offers that a male director would get after snagging a $69m debut weekend. Well, it would appear for the moment that the answer is “yes.”\n\nAs you presumably know, Elizabeth Banks was a key producer on the first Pitch Perfect while the $17 million musical comedy (produced by Banks's Brownstone Productions) was directed by Broadway vet but film newbie Jason Moore. Moore, who was nominated for a Tony for directing Avenue Q back in 2004, cashed in on the success of Pitch Perfect by directing the Tina Fey/Amy Poehler comedy Sisters and finding himself on the proverbial “list” to helm the next Marvel/ Sony Spider-Man movie. It would stand to reason that Ms. Banks, herself already a respected actress and producer, would find herself in similar good standing after successful directing the second Anna Kendrick/Rebel Wilson comedy to a $250m-and-counting worldwide total.\n\nBut this is the business where Catherine Hardwicke directs Twilight to $392 million worldwide and still not even be considered for a film like The Fighter. Sam Taylor-Johnson has no immediate projects lined up after directing the $560 million+ Fifty Shades of Grey even as critics admitted that she directed the hell out of a problematic text with a tyrannical author breathing down her neck. It may have been the pessimist in me, but I wasn’t necessarily sure that Banks would get the chance to direct anything of note anytime soon. For example, Drew Barrymore directed the financially disappointing but critically-acclaimed Whip It in 2009 and has yet to line up a second feature, even as Ben Affleck went from the critically-acclaimed box office disappointment Gone Baby Gone to The Town and then Argo. Both pulled off smashing directorial debuts, but only Affleck got to actually make follow-ups.\n\nBut Banks has presumably lined up a pretty significant (I hope) project mere weeks after Pitch Perfect 2 debuted to solid reviews and above-noted massive debut weekend. Even as the “YAFF” sub-genre remains somewhat female-slanted, pretty much all of them have been directed by male directors, so it is worth noting that Red Queen will have a female screenwriter (Gennifer Hutchison) and a female director. It’s but a minor sliver of a cut in a massive glass ceiling, but it is still a cut and it still earns a token nod of approval. Eventually this kind of thing, a female director actually directing a smash hit and getting rewarded for it on the relative level as her male peers, won’t be something that will be cause for celebration. But until it is no longer noteworthy and is more of an expected development, I’ll spend a few minutes toasting accordingly."
