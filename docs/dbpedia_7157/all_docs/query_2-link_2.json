The film's plot follows an all-girl a cappella group who compete against another group from their own college to win the National. The film is loosely adapted from Cornell University alum Mickey Rapkin's non-fiction book, titled Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate a Cappella Glory and director Moore's own experiences at his alma mater, Northwestern University. Filming concluded in December 2011, in Rogers, Arkansas.[4]\n\nThe film premiered in Los Angeles on September 24, 2012[5] and was released on October 5, 2012 in the United States. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and became a sleeper hit,[6] earning $115.4 million worldwide. It is the first film in the trilogy and was followed by two sequels, Pitch Perfect 2 (2015) and Pitch Perfect 3 (2017).\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 2011 International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) Finals at the Lincoln Center, Barden University's all-female a cappella group, the Barden Bellas, loses to their all-male rival group, the Barden Treblemakers, due to a very nervous junior member Aubrey Posen projectile vomiting onstage in the middle of her solo under the pressure of her peers. Four months later, aspiring music producer Beca Mitchell enrolls as a freshman at Barden University at the insistence of her father. To her father's chagrin, Beca spends her time making mash-up mixes of songs and gets an internship at the school radio station, where she befriends fellow freshman Jesse Swanson.\n\nAt the university's activities fair, now-seniors Aubrey and Chloe Beale are attempting to recruit new members for the Bellas but find that interest in their group has decreased significantly after last year's on-stage incident. Beca is invited to join but declines and claims she can't sing. Later, Chloe hears Beca sing in the shower and convinces her to audition. At auditions, Beca sings a rendition of \"Cups (When I'm Gone)\", earning herself a place in the Bellas alongside fellow newcomers: tough Cynthia Rose Adams, promiscuous Stacie Conrad, eccentric Lilly Onakuramara, humorous Patricia \"Fat Amy\" Hobart, as well as Jessica Smith, Ashley Jones, and Denise. Meanwhile, Jesse joins the Treblemakers.\n\nFollowing sorority antics and extensive training, the Bellas participate in the 2012 ICCA Regionals, where, at Aubrey's insistence, they perform the medley that helped them advance to the Finals the previous year. The Treblemakers place first, and the Bellas place second, advancing to the Semi-Finals. After the competition, the Bellas try to break up a fight between the Treblemakers and the Tonehangers, a male alumni a cappella group. Beca and Fat Amy accidentally smash a window with the Treblemakers' trophy, leading to Beca's arrest. Jesse contacts her father to bail her out, and Beca's frustration causes a rift in her relationship with both. Aubrey insists on performing the same medley a second time, despite Beca urging them to be more daring. In the midst of their next performance, Beca inserts an impromptu layering of \"Bulletproof\" into the set, hoping to reinvigorate the uninterested audience.\n\nAlthough the audience seems to like Beca's improvisation, Aubrey berates Beca after the performance and accuses her of hooking up with Jesse, a Treblemaker— a rule violation punishable by ejection from the Bellas. Jesse attempts to deny it, causing Beca to snap at them both and quit the Bellas. Despite positive reception towards their performance, the Bellas do not advance to the Finals, landing in third behind the Treblemakers and the Footnotes. However, Jesse's roommate Benji Applebaum learns that the Footnotes' leader is a high school student, leading to their disqualification and allowing the Bellas to advance to the Finals. After spring break, Beca tries to reconcile with Jesse, but he rejects her.\n\nDuring rehearsal for their redemption, growing tensions push the Bellas to stand up to Aubrey, causing her to get an anxiety attack, and begin projectile vomiting on them, sparking an all-out dramatic fight over the pitch pipe between the Bellas in Aubrey's vomit. Beca arrives, breaks up the fight, and apologizes to the Bellas for changing the set before asking Aubrey for a second chance. Beca rejoins the group, and Aubrey relinquishes her half of the Bellas' leadership to Beca. Chloe discovers that she is able to sing bass notes after her node removal surgery. Meanwhile, Treblemakers leader Bumper Allen quits the group after being offered a job as a back-up singer for John Mayer. With Bumper gone, Jesse convinces the Trebles to open a spot for Benji, which had been previously denied to him despite his impressive audition.\n\nAt the Finals, the Bellas perform a more modern medley arranged by Beca, which includes \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\", featured in The Breakfast Club, one of Jesse's favorite movies. This acts as a more effective apology, and after the performance, she and Jesse kiss. The Bellas emerge victorious over the Treblemakers and win the national championship. Six months later, auditions are held to recruit new members.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAnna Kendrick as Beca Mitchell, an introverted and rebellious mash-up producer who joins the Barden Bellas after persuasion from Chloe.\n\nSkylar Astin as Jesse Swanson, an outgoing Barden freshman who hopes to become a film score composer.\n\nRebel Wilson as Patricia \"Fat Amy\" Hobart, a confident, comical singer from Tasmania.\n\nAdam DeVine as Bumper Allen, the egotistical leader of the Barden Treblemakers.\n\nAnna Camp as Aubrey Posen, the uptight and traditionalist co-leader of the Bellas.\n\nBrittany Snow as Chloe Beale, the friendlier and more civil co-leader of the Bellas.\n\nAlexis Knapp as Stacie Conrad, a singer and dancer with a high sex drive.\n\nEster Dean as Cynthia Rose Adams, a tough, forthright soul singer and rapper.\n\nHana Mae Lee as Lilly Onakuramara, an eccentric, soft-spoken, and talented beatboxer.\n\nBen Platt as Benji Applebaum, Jesse's roommate, a skilled illusionist who wishes to become a Treblemaker.\n\nUtkarsh Ambudkar as Donald, Bumper's right-hand man, a vocalist, beatboxer, and rapper.\n\nMichael Viruet as Unicycle, a beatboxer.\n\nJohn Michael Higgins as John Smith, a commentator for the ICCAs.\n\nElizabeth Banks as Gail Abernathy-McKadden, a commentator for the ICCAs.\n\nAdditionally, Kelley Alice Jakle, Wanetah Walmsley, Shelley Regner, Caroline Fourmy, and Nicole Lovince respectively appear as Barden Bellas Jessica, a bubbly and absent-minded soprano, Denise, an unobtrusive alto, Ashley, an alto and beatboxer, and short-lived Bellas Mary-Elise and Kori.

Kether Donohue appears as outgoing Bellas leader Alice. Joe Lo Truglio, Har Mar Superstar, Jason Jones and Donald Faison appear as the Tonehangers, an older, long-graduated a cappella group that gets into a fight with the Bellas and Treblemakers.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film is based on Mickey Rapkin's 2008 period piece non-fiction book Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate a Cappella Glory. Rapkin, senior editor at GQ magazine, spent a season covering competitive collegiate a cappella. He followed the Tufts University Beelzebubs (the inspiration for the Treblemakers), the University of Oregon Divisi (the loose inspiration for the Bellas), and the University of Virginia Hullabahoos, who have a cameo in the film. Rapkin's book mainly covers the singing, groupies, partying and rivalries. Two members of the a cappella community, Deke Sharon, who founded the International Championship of College A Cappella, and Ed Boyer, both in Rapkin's book, were brought on board to arrange songs, produce vocals and act as on-site music directors, where they ran a month-long \"a cappella boot camp\".[7] The film was shot throughout campus and inside buildings at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.[8] Elizabeth Banks is a co-producer and a co-star in the film.[8]\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nThe casting department included Justin Coulter, Rich Delia, Allison Estrin, and Michael Roth.[9] Producer Elizabeth Banks appears throughout the film alongside John Michael Higgins as commentators for the competitions.[10]\n\nPaul Brooks stated \"First and foremost, we were looking for actors who had comedic instincts and thought we'd get lucky with terrific actors who happened to be funny and can actually dance and maybe sing. It turns out we did get lucky with our cast!\"[11] According to producer Elizabeth Banks, \"The character Beca required someone who was grounded, who has a strong point of view on the world, who is funny and empathetic and someone who we can all relate to and root for.\" Of Kendrick, she said, \"Anna is all those things, and there was no other choice.\" Fellow producer Brooks said \"I saw Anna in Up in the Air and thought it was the most exquisite, elegant, balanced, sublime performance. Anna was our first choice for the role of Beca.\"[11]\n\nWhen casting the character of Jesse, Max Handelman said \"We were looking for a young John Cusack-type guy. We needed to find someone who was kind of awkward but not a geek, but not so cool that you're not rooting for him.\" Skylar Astin was chosen for the role. Of Astin's audition, Banks said the chemistry between Skylar and Anna when they read together prior to shooting was \"clear and they were able to riff off each other.\"[11]\n\nRebel Wilson was recognized for her performance in the comedy film Bridesmaids upon auditioning for the role of Fat Amy, which she won instantly. Moore recalled Wilson singing Lady Gaga's \"The Edge of Glory\" while beating \"on her chest with her fists.\" He said, \"I didn't even hear the end of the song because I was laughing so hard. There's this beautiful openness to the way Rebel approaches everything, and that's what works great for the character. She's fearless.\"[11] Adam DeVine was personally chosen by Banks and Handelman for the role of Bumper after they saw him on the television series Workaholics. Banks confessed that she and her husband are \"big Workaholics fans,\" and after watching one night during the film's casting, they saw DeVine and \"immediately thought\" he would be a good choice for Bumper. He initially declined because he was not a singer. DeVine eventually surprised Banks and Handelman with his vocal skills.[11] Anna Camp was chosen for the role of Aubrey. Producer Max Handelman said, \"Elizabeth and I were huge fans of Anna's from True Blood. Aubrey is set up as the antagonist for Beca, and Beca's already a bit hard-edged, so it was so important to find an actress who could play Aubrey as someone who could marshal the crazy but also was sympathetic.\"[11]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was released on October 5, 2012, in the United States. In Australia, it was released on December 6, 2012.\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nPitch Perfect was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Blu-ray/DVD combo pack on December 18, 2012.[12] A 4K UHD Blu-Ray release followed on March 20, 2018.[13]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nPitch Perfect grossed $65 million in North America and $50.3 million in other territories for a total gross of $115.4 million since release, against a $17 million budget.[2]\n\nThe film opened in limited release in the United States and Canada on September 28, 2012, and wide release in the United States and Canada on October 5, 2012. It grossed $1.8 million upon its opening day of limited release and $4.9 million on its first day of wide release.[15] In its wide opening weekend, the film opened at number three, behind Taken 2 and Hotel Transylvania, grossing $14.8 million.[16] The opening weekend audience was 81 percent female, which is considered overwhelming. The opening weekend also attracted a younger audience with 55% of the opening weekend audience being under the age of 25.[17] The film is the third-highest-grossing music comedy film, behind its sequel, Pitch Perfect 2, and School of Rock.[2]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 82% based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 6.40/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Pitch Perfect's plot is formulaic, but the performances are excellent and the musical numbers are toe-tapping as well.\"[18] On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[19] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[20][21]\n\nNPR's David Edelstein selected it as one of the top films of the year[22] and Entertainment Weekly chose the soundtrack as one of the year's best.[23] Roger Ebert gave the film 2 stars out of 4, praising Rebel Wilson for her \"ebullient, unstoppable and raucous\" performance, but also stating that \"It's a twentysomething song-and-dance movie built around rival a cappella groups. That's more exciting than dueling string quartets, I suppose— but no, the quartets would be performing better material.\"[14]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nList of awards and nominations for Pitch Perfect Award Category Nominees Result Broadcast Film Critics Association Award Best Actress in a Comedy Rebel Wilson Nominated Detroit Film Critics Society Award Breakthrough Performance Rebel Wilson Nominated Motion Picture Sound Editors[24] Best Music in a Musical Feature Film Pitch Perfect Won MTV Movie Award[25] Best Breakthrough Performance Rebel Wilson Won Best Musical Moment Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Alexis Knapp, Ester Dean, and Hana Mae Lee Won Best WTF Moment Anna Camp (\"Hack-Appella\") Nominated Best Female Performance Rebel Wilson Nominated People's Choice Award Favorite Comedy Movie Pitch Perfect Nominated San Diego Film Critics Society San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Supporting Actress Rebel Wilson Nominated Teen Choice Awards[26] Choice Movie: Comedy Pitch Perfect Won Choice Movie Actress: Comedy Anna Kendrick Nominated Choice Movie Actress: Comedy Rebel Wilson Won Choice Movie Actor: Comedy Skylar Astin Won Choice Movie: Scene Stealer Ben Platt Nominated Choice Movie: Scene Stealer Hana Mae Lee Nominated Choice Movie: Breakout Adam DeVine Nominated Choice Movie: Villain Adam DeVine Won American Music Awards Favorite Soundtrack Pitch Perfect Won\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Pitch Perfect (soundtrack)\n\nPitch Perfect: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released digitally on September 25, 2012, and physically on October 2, 2012.[27] Three of the songs from the album, including the highly covered \"Cups\", charted on the Billboard Hot 100.
