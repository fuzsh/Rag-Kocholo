        "text": "“You tell me you don’t love me / Over a cup of coffee / And I just have to look away / A million miles between us”\n\nIntroduction:\n\nWelcome back to Cover Me Badd, where we look at good covers, bad covers and what makes them tick. Now, I admit my usual tight schedule for pumping this series out monthly has slipped in recent days; blame that on an increasingly packed schedule and workload, which has prevented me from really finding the time to devote energy writing articles for this blog. But then as now, I remain the same stubborn guy I used to be, and by God I just cannot find it in me to quit working on this entirely; so I persist once more in my ways. But I didn’t want my continued insistence on maintaining this blog against all good judgment to translate to a decline in the quality of the writing or the subject matter; so today, we’re going to go outside of a box a little, to focus on a subject that arguably doesn’t constitute a cover at all, but is certainly interesting enough to merit its own article. That’s right, we’re going back… to 2012 (again).\n\nAh yes. The end of the world. The heyday of millennial culture, Buzzfeed quizzes, Glee, “Call Me Maybe”, Obama’s reelection, the breakthrough year of One Direction, the absolute peak of Tumblr culture and the insane shipping wars, the ascendancy of 8tracks, and where every twenty-something East Coast apartment dweller’s favorite hobby was shitting on Lena Dunham’s character on Girls (don’t believe any TikToks that try to convince you otherwise). Though 2012 was only twelve years ago, it feels like the world has changed drastically enough in that relatively brief window of time that you can easily look back on this era as a nostalgic one. I certainly feel the gray hairs sprouting on my head as I write this article! Ha ha ha… But if you were a teenager in late 2012-early 2013, then there’s one major artifact of that era that you will most certainly remember\n\nTowards the end of that year, we were treated to a little movie about a college acapella group called Pitch Perfect. It was a snarky teen movie that dropped in during an era where musical teen shows and movies were all the rage, and it was so massive that it made huge stars out of its leads, including Skylar Astin, Anna Kendrick, Ben Platt, and especially Rebel Wilson, arguably the movie’s biggest beneficiary. But perhaps its main contribution to that canon of chipper Obama-era fluff was to set off a goddamn acapella craze on a scale few ever imagined could even be possible and bringing a new level of prominence to a long-maligned performance style that had hitherto been relegated largely to being a punchline representative of the most regrettable facets of college life. Yes, for a good two or three years, joining an acapella group was seen as the height of taste, and everyone was lining up to join their local college or community center acapella group just to get some of that sweet, sweet Barden Bellas clout. It was honestly endearing to see then, and even looking back now, through my considerably more withered heart, I can still find it within me to appreciate this relatively more optimistic era where the biggest pop culture event of the year inspired young musical hopefuls to start making music come out of their mouths.\n\nBut though the movie gave us plenty of great musical moments and memorable quotes that I reckon have found themselves irrevocably lodged into every single millennial’s brain cavities, those aren’t the movie’s biggest musical legacy. No, believe it or not, this movie catapulted what is perhaps one of the biggest viral internet hits into the summer, one of the very first examples of Youtube streams actually pushing a song atop the charts—and it was basically Anna Kendrick humming along to a little ‘30s ditty while tapping on a cup. That’s right, today, we’ll be looking at the one, the only, the unforgettable 2013 internet smash “Cups (When I’m Gone)”, an ode to simplicity and sheer minimalism that, even today, still stands as one of the most bizarre, unexpected, and off-the-wall Top 10 hits ever to hit Billboard. When people my age first heard this song on Pitch Perfect, most of us didn’t really know how to process what we were hearing, because the melody just sounded so intrinsically familiar and classic that most of us had Mandela Effect-ed ourselves into believing that it was some old ditty our parents had hummed to us when we were kids or something. But no, the song she was humming was not a classic tune beloved by generations and irrevocably lodged in the public—hell, in the form she was singing it, it was actually extremely recent, and extremely obscure even for early 2010s internet standards.\n\nThat song, “When I’m Gone”, is from the 1930s, but it did not exist in that form upon its original release. Instead, it’s based on a Carter Family composition, one of the many country and bluegrass songs they recorded in their many long tours throughout the country collecting and recording new music from local bluegrass musicians. It’s significantly different from the version that we would all come to recognize, and because of the relative obscurity of most Carter family recordings, not to mention the fact of them being country stars right before country music would become walled off from the rest of the music world, the song was too far removed from any generations adjacent to ours for it to become a well-remembered classic or anything. No, the song, in its most recognizable form, was a creature of the internet first and foremost, because the reworked version we’d all become familiar with originated from viral internet band Lulu and the Lampshades, who covered it in 2009, smack dab in the Wild West days of Youtube, and it became a massive viral smash, owing to its novel use of the cup game to serve as the song’s beat. From there on, it made history.\n\nSo what exactly is it about this song that it was able to transcend its origins and status as a Youtube viral hit to become an actual artifact of early 2010s millennial pop culture? Well, grab your ticket to the long way ‘round and buy some whiskey along the way, because I sure could use some sweet company as I dive into the long, storied history of this unique cultural touchstone.\n\nThe original:\n\nNow it’s an open question as to what exactly “the original” we’ll be talking about today is. Like I said, the song would go through a great many incarnations before it transformed into the version that would make it to the big screen, so take note of that when we describe this section. Which of the “original” originals will we be talking about? Exactly how long ago are we talking? Well, for starters, to begin this article, we’re going to go way back, starting off in a place I didn’t think an article involving this song would ever go — let’s talk about the early history of country music.\n\nOh, country music. Today it’s most familiar to us for being the bizarre, walled-off ecosystem that exists in parallel to the rest of pop culture, but doesn’t quite intersect with it, whether thanks to its own penchant for isolation or a deliberate exclusion by the rest of the world. For this reason, it’s easy for a lot of pop music fans to dismiss country music or ignore its existence entirely, and given the types of people the genre has been associated with throughout the years, it’s led to a largely negative perception of the genre in the public eye—i.e. that it’s backwards-looking genre filled with hicks who hate women, black people and anyone leaning anywhere leftward on the political spectrum. In fact, for a long time, the old adage amongst most casual pop listeners was that they liked “everything but hip-hop and country”, which subsisted for a long time until hip-hop eventually became the sound of mainstream music. This left country as the black sheep of the music world, bizarrely in its own lane but with its own separate traditions, institutions, megastars and narratives. And yet, even so, it’s had a history almost as long as, if not longer than, rock and roll, pop, or any of the other streams of “popular music” throughout history, and some of the biggest-selling acts of all time have been country artists. Which begs the question—how did it become so isolated?\n\nBecause country music was not always this separated from the mainstream musical landscape. If anything, at one point it was intrinsically, inseparably intertwined with mainstream music. Country traditions and sounds were at the genesis of what we consider “popular music”; hell, even as late as the 1950s, at the dawn of rock and roll, many of these mainstream trends either intersected with, or had to reckon with country music and Americana tropes in some way. After all, the first wave of rock and rollers were country enough that we now refer to their particular sound as “rockabilly”, with acts like Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Johnny Cash all either bearing a country music affect or having one foot in the door of both country and rock. Ray Charles’ game-changing album, released at the dawn of the ‘60s and which basically set the tone for the next few decades of rock and RnB, was called Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, and it was lauded specifically because it blended together country and soul at a time of rampant racial segregation. Like it or not, at one point in history, “hip” genres like rock were inseparable from country.\n\nBut the two worlds were torn apart not because of their inherent qualities, but due to a series of sustained and deliberate marketing strategies that sought to elevate one art form to cater to White tastes, while relegating the rest to Black audiences in their own sort of musical ghetto. I talked about this a bit in the recent Beyoncé article I did last March, but to recap what I said there—country music sounds had come up alongside Blues and other similar rural art forms and many of the tropes surrounding them had been pioneered by Black artists, but there was also a window in which the color barriers between the races had broken down and there was participation by both Black and White artists, not always in flattering ways. When White record executives realized the mainstream potential of the country music they were hearing at these minstrel shows and vaudeville performances, they knew who they wanted to market it to, and who they wanted to exclude. So there was a long period in which Blues, RnB and other “Negro” art forms were pigeonholed into their own little category, whereas the “White” elements were filtered out into the mainstream “country” sound. The differences between these two strains of what essentially used to be the same general sound became more pronounced over the years. Coincidentally, it was the “Black” half of this equation that birthed rock and roll, and here was where the sound of what became the mythologized “popular” music of the next few decades arose—albeit also overtaken by White performers. It’s this split that explains why rock institutions, which eventually came to encompass other art forms like soul, RnB, hip-hop, and even modern pop, continues to exclude country, the original “White” country half, which had broken away long ago and had never truly reintegrated back in.\n\nToday’s story takes place at the dawn of this era, long before this split became that pronounced, but far enough in that you could still mark out today’s performers as being specifically country pioneers despite having more of a general folk influence. Today, let’s talk about the Carter Family.\n\nAh yes, A.P., Sara and Maybelle Carter—also known as the Carter Family. If you don’t listen to country or aren’t an old-time country or bluegrass afficionado, you might not be familiar with these people, even though they’re easily one of the most influential musical groups around. If the name does ring familiar to those of you more inclined towards classic rock or ‘50s music, you might recognize them for the fact that one of their scions, June Carter, wound up being the partner and significant other of Johnny Cash, who often toured with the remaining Carters in their twilight years. These guys came up in an era so far removed from our own that many elements of their story may not read as familiar to most of you, but that’s only because much of what they pioneered is so embedded into modern music that it’s impossible to really appreciate how pioneering the yare given how oversaturated and copied their sound has become.\n\nTo put it simply, the Carter Family basically invented many of the tropes that would come to define modern country music to this day. And they did that by basically being one of the first vocally-oriented groups to hit it big in the country and bluegrass sphere, which had otherwise been dominated by instrumental and primarily musical groups before this. See, they came up in the late 1920s, when country music was still in its infancy, and the primary instrument of choice was the fiddle. This meant that the fiddler was largely the star of the show, as evidenced by the many, many early country artists who bore the title “Fiddler” or “Fiddlin’” in their stage names. And while the instrumentals are a core component of the Carters’ sound, it was their focus on lyrics, songwriting, composition and vocals that really set them apart. Ironically, the group did not write many original songs, with many of their biggest and most enduring hits being based on rural American folk standards, compiled, reworked and recorded mainly at the initiative of their leader and primary arranger A.P. Carter, whose work as a traveling salesman had exposed him to a diverse array of American folk traditions that he would eventually draw upon for the group’s repertoire.\n\nAnd because of this, the Carters, along with contemporary and fellow country music pioneer Jimmie Rodgers, played a significant role in transforming country music into the primarily vocal and lyrical genre it is today. But though their approach leaned more towards emphasizing songwriting and composition, they did not lack for instrumental chops, either, with the gorgeous voice of A.P.’s wife Sara carrying many of the group’s best-known songs. But perhaps the group’s most visible legacy lies in the unique and pioneering guitar playing of Sara’s cousin Maybelle (who also married A.P.’s cousin Ezra). Maybelle, or “Mother” Maybelle Carter as she’s still popularly known in the country world, pioneered a sort of simple yet innovative style of picking in which she used the bass strings to play lead while strumming the treble strings, effectively allowing her to play both lead and rhythm. It was an approach so basic but effective that it single handedly turned the guitar into a lead instrument, shaping the next few decades of rock and roll to come.\n\nBut as successful and influential as the Carters were in their day, even the stress of the relatively small-time touring they did throughout the country began to take a toll on their marriage and their personal relationships. The Carters had achieved their first taste of success in 1927, but their rise to fame coincided with the onset of the Great Depression, and the combination of the economic hardships levied by the recession, combined with the pressures of their new recording career, eventually chipped away at both the Carters’ recording career, and the fraying marriage of A.P. and Sara. Though the Carters would eventually rebound in 1932 with a series of lucrative radio contracts with stations along the Texas-Mexico border (which could broadcast at higher frequencies than most inland American stations), this did nothing to save A.P. and Sara’s marriage, which eventually ended in divorce by 1939 when Sara was caught with another man. It eventually became difficult for the group to record consistently, not just because of the disintegrating interpersonal dynamics within the group, but also because Maybelle and her husband had relocated to Washington D.C., which meant the Carters only ever really saw each other during recording sessions that were increasingly requiring more effort to put together. By the 1950s, the group had largely splintered, with A.P. and Sara continuing to perform sporadically while Maybelle took the Carter Family name and toured under it with her own daughters, including the aforementioned June Carter.\n\nBut for all that the Carters were prolific artists who leave behind a diverse array of classic Americana and country standards, the song we’re focusing on today is actually a lesser known entrant into the Carters’ repertoire.\n\nIn 1931, right as they were on the cusp of one of the most difficult periods of their career, the Carters recorded “When I’m Gone”, one of the few wholly original songs in the group’s catalogue not taken from a classic American folk tune. It doesn’t strike me as a particularly noteworthy entrant into their repertoire, either—their Wikipedia page doesn’t lit it as one of their more notable songs right out o the gate, you barely hear anyone, even serious country music aficionados and scholars, mentioning it as one of their foundational masterworks or important must-listen entries, and the actual song’s own Wikipedia page is a pathetic two-paragraph stub that gives you no actual information on the song itself. It’s not exactly a cornerstone of the Carter family legacy, to put it bluntly. Of course, it also doesn’t help that the Carters have another similarly-titled and much more popular song, their 1928 composition “Will You Miss Me When I’m Gone?”\n\nAnd what’s it about? It’s a fairly simple song whose essence is captured right in the title — it’s about a woman who’s leaving and saying a few parting words to the person, most likely her lover, that she’s leaving behind. Or is it? Because I first encountered this song through its many reworked incarnations, I initially assumed that this was some sort of breakup song or allegory, but in its earliest form, this song consists only of a few short refrains, with the lyrics zeroing in mainly on the “when I’m gone” aspect, and the more they repeated that line, the more I realized… holy shit, this song is about death. It certainly explains the song’s mellow, almost lethargic atmosphere—it communicates an almost eerie sense of peacefulness, most certainly not the kind you have when you’re relaxing at the beach. It’s also why the emphasis is about what you, the recipient of this message, are going to miss about the narrator. I mean, just look at it —\n\nYou’re gonna miss me when I’m gone\n\nYou’re gonna miss me when I’m gone\n\nOh, I know you will miss me when I’m gone\n\nYou’re gonna miss me by my walk\n\nYou’re gonna miss me by my talk\n\nOh, I know you will miss me when I’m gone\n\nWhen I’m gone (When I’m gone)\n\nWhen I’m gone (When I’m gone)\n\nOh, I know you will miss me when I’m gone\n\nWhen I’m gone (When I’m gone)\n\nWhen I’m gone (When I’m gone)\n\nOh, I know you will miss me when I’m gone\n\nYou’re gonna miss me by my prayers\n\nYou’re gonna miss me everywhere\n\nOh, I know you will miss me when I’m gone\n\nYou’re gonna miss me by my song\n\nYou’re gonna miss me all day long\n\nOh, I know you will miss me when I’m gone\n\nLooking back, I’m not exactly surprised that this didn’t become a Carter Family standard, despite sounding almost identical to some of their biggest hits (if you play this and “Wabash Cannonball” back to back, it would take a while for the difference to register). It’s a little too repetitive for its own good, and even for a Carter family folk tune, it doesn’t really go any interesting places beyond the first few lines. What really makes it soar is that chorus, when A.P. and Sara begin harmonizing and the effect is just lovely, conveying a sense of melancholy that really takes you out of the otherwise mellow, peaceful vibe of the song. It’s no wonder that, of all the incarnations of this song, that chorus is the one that stuck around through all of them—it’s the most essential part of the song, without which there isn’t really a lot to grab onto.\n\nIt’s a good song, but, again, not exactly something that resonated with the public. But even with that said, at the time, the song was popular enough that it was reworked into an Appalachian bluegrass folk tune in 1937 by J.E. Mainer’s Mountaineers. They don’t really switch up much in the way of the lyrics, but they completely transform the asong’s arrangement from the laid-back, pastoral country of the Carters’ version to a more kicking, stomping bluegrass rhythm with plenty of banjo to go around —\n\nAnd the song must have been at least known enough to permeate through the pop-cultural subconscious decades later, because the Carters’ song pops up again in 2009, this time in the form of an early niche viral Youtube video by two girls humming along to a reworked, heavily-modified version of the song while playing the cup game in their family dining table.\n\nYes, this avant-garde cup video is by British indie pop “band” Lulu and the Lampshades (known as Landshapes since 2012). They’re an indie folk pop band who… honestly don’t seem to have left much of a footprint on pop culture, which is strange considering how instrumental they were to the phenomenon that was “Cups”. In fact, everything I’ve read about them suggests that they were barely even a band to begin with at the time they went viral in 2009; they seem to have gotten their start only in that year, most of their discography pops up only around 2011-12, by which point they’d ditched the original name attached to their most enduring pop culture legacy. If I had to describe the kind of music they made, I would describe it as a cross between Florence and the Machine and Two Door Cinema Club—so yeah, we know exactly what era of indie rock music we’re getting into. I’m not actually sure why they didn’t go on to bigger and better things—it might be because their version of “When I’m Gone” was never that big to begin with, maybe it was a consequence of coming from 2009-era Youtube, when virality was far from a guarantee even for the biggest names on the platform, or maybe it was just a lack of brand consistency in an already oversaturated market—whatever the case, they remain perhaps one of the most obscure groups I’ve ever covered on this blog.\n\nWhich is strange, because, in all respects, “You’re Gonna Miss Me” is their song through and through. Those verses, which are equally as well-known as the chorus succeeding it, were entirely of their making. They wrote the lyrics and came up with the melody for those verses all on their own, which is honestly really impressive considering that it’s really difficult to rework an existing melody and fit it into an entirely new composition without sounding forced or unnatural (ask David Guetta). I actually didn’t know those verses were original lyrics;, when I first heard “Cups”, I’d always assumed they were part of the original song, not only because I had no reason to assume this was a mashup of some sort, but also just because they carry a sort of old-world vibe that just fits the tone and mood of the melodies perfectly. The fact that they not only wrote a verse that seamlessly slots in with those choruses, but made it seem like it had always been a part of the song, is a stunning artistic achievement. It’s also one that changes the tone of the song considerably.\n\nI got my ticket for the long way ’round\n\nTwo bottle of whiskey for the way\n\nAnd I sure would like some sweet company\n\nAnd I’m leaving tomorrow, what do you say?\n\nWhen I’m gone\n\nWhen I’m gone\n\nYou’re gonna miss me when I’m gone\n\nYou’re gonna miss me by my hair\n\nYou’re gonna miss me everywhere, oh\n\nYou’re gonna miss me when I’m gone\n\nLike I said, the “original” original was about death, and it was much clearer when you only had the chorus melodies and the lines alluding to “missing” someone to go off. But the addition of those additional verses transforms the song into more of a breakup song, or at least a bittersweet rumination of a free-spirited woman contemplating going out into the world, with or without her lover. And I’ve been calling it a “breakup” song because that’s always how I perceived the song growing up, and that first verse certainly lends itself well to that interpretation, but the second verse puts that reading into doubt, especially because it almost seems to contradict the vibe of the first verse in some ways —\n\nI got my ticket for the long way ’round\n\nThe one with the prettiest of views\n\nIt’s got mountains, it’s got rivers, it’s got sights to give you shivers\n\nBut it sure would be prettier with you\n\nSo which is it—are they breaking up or not? There are ways to reconcile the two, but they’ve always felt somewhat forced to me, and this seeming sense of indecision between the narrator’s two moods in the verses don’t slot in well with the otherwise final vibe of the chorus, which is perhaps the clearest sign that these two parts of the song weren’t originally written together. Because of that apparent inconsistency, I’ve always read it more like an invitation to her lover—will you go with me or will you not? It feels like we’re at a certain reckoning point in their relationship, a make or break point, and the lover it’s addressed to will have to choose carefully.\n\nBut of course, those verses are not the only innovation introduced by Lulu and the Lampshades, because we of course have to talk about the big elephant in the room—what the hell is that cup game and why did they decide to pair it with the song? To this day, I still can’t find a proper explanation, although that might be because I was never familiar with the cup game to begin with growing up. From what I can gather, it’s just a thing kids have been doing for a long time, so I guess if you had that background, it would seem like a perfectly natural choice to fuck around and set your song to the sound of plastic cups colliding with a tabletop. How long has this cup game thing been a thing, you ask?\n\nYeah.\n\nBut the final step in the evolution of the song came in 2011, when the Lampshades’ innovative cover was exposed to a wider audience thanks to the cover that most likely inspired the Pitch Perfect rendition, and probably even the name of the fictional college the movie is set in —\n\nThis is probably the closest you get to the song’s final form without actually going all the way. It’s all there — the bangs, the over-pronunciation of words, the “too cool for your mom” vibe, it’s walking right up the line. This cover of the song went viral in 2011 and is what brought the cups song to widespread notoriety, which is weird because, in all respects, it’s exactly the same song as the Lampshades’, the only difference being that it’s being sung by one person, which means it lacks those gorgeous harmonies (which I’ll get more into later). Whatever the case, it’s easily the most popular pre-movie version of the song, first finding steam on Reddit and gaining traction as a meme, before finally finding its way onto the radar of one Ms. Anna Kendrick, who just so happened to be filming a little movie that summer about a little acapella group with big dreams…\n\nThe cover:\n\nPitch Perfect is, for better or worse, a movie that could only have happened in 2012.\n\n2012 pop culture is so distinct in my memory that even just talking about it now, for the purposes of this review, has brought back vivid and distinct memories of a time in my life I honestly wish I could go back to. Perhaps this is why I’m going back to the well again so soon. But if you remember the discussion in the previous article, there was just a distinct sense of unbridled optimism in the early 2010s that I don’t think can really be repeated anytime soon, a sense of wonder and excitement at what seemed like a brave new world opening up before us millennials. This was a sense of optimism brought about by a lot of factors—Obama’s reelection was a major one I brought up in that previous article—but one other thing I didn’t really mention was the effect of the internet, which, at the dawn of the early 2010s, was undergoing its most radical expansion yet.\n\nThe internet had been in widespread use at least as far back as the mid 90s, and certainly most 2000s kids can remember having grown up with the internet as a formative part of their youth. But as far as its ubiquity as an inextricable part of modern life? That didn’t really begin to happen until the dawn of the 2010s, especially with the rise of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, which became so trendy and in-demand that the possession of an account on these sites was a sine qua non requirement to exist and be recognized in society. This, along with the increased accessibility to the Internet provided by the then-nascent smartphone, began a snowballing chain of events which allowed the internet to permeate every waking moment of our existence and leaving no corner untouched.\n\nToday, practically everyone recognizes this state of affairs for the dystopian setting it is, but back in the early 2010s, when this was all still new and uncharted, it felt like an exciting new development, something that was opening up barriers for the ordinary person. Suddenly, there was an entire world of culture, information, music, art, learning, and paths to alternative success that allowed you to bypass the traditional corporate ladder, and it was all accessible with a tap on a phone screen. And you bet people were eager to use these new opportunities and make the most out of them. With Youtube giving creators a new platform to upload videos and share new ideas with the world, it quickly became a hub for some of the most batshit, off-the-wall content most of us had ever seen. But unlike the equally batshit and arguably even less restrained environment of the 2000s internet, the early 2010s saw internet culture permeating the mainstream for the first time. Niche internet geek culture was increasingly dictating our pop-cultural consumption, and we were increasingly witnessing a melding of internet-based new media and traditional media outlets.\n\nWhich brings us to Pitch Perfect —\n\nPitch Perfect is a 2012 musical teen comedy directed by Jason Moore and Kay Cannon, starring Anna Kendrick as Beca, a sardonic college freshman who, through a series of contrivances, is railroaded into auditioning for her college’s all-female acapella group, the once-legendary but creatively spent Barden Bellas, who are still reeling from a major shake-up driven by the loss of most of their graduating class, as well as a disastrous collegiate acapella competition performance where erstwhile leader Aubrey (Anna Camp) projectile vomited onto the judges. Beca is skeptical at first, and like most sane people did in 2012, finds the idea of auditioning for college acapella corny and beneath her, but she gradually warms up and opens her heart to the world of collegiate acapella as she gets to know the group’s quirky cast of characters, including overly enthusiastic second-in-command Chloe (Brittany Snow), boisterous and sexually confident Aussie chick Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), promiscuous Stacey (Alexis Knapp), the aggressive and tough Cynthia (Ester Dean), and the silent but mysterious Lilly (Hana Mae Lee). All of this while also dealing with a major rivalry from the all-male acapella group the Treblemakers, whose new freshman member Jesse (Skylar Astin) seems eager to pursue Beca’s affections.\n\nThat’s the synopsis version of the movie, at least—in reality, it’s basically Mean Girls with an acapella beat; an irreverent mess of millennial teen musical cliches that’s filled to the brim with quips and bizarro throwaway lines delivered mainly by Rebel Wilson, easily the film’s breakout star given how rapidly her stock rose in the wake of this movie. Pitch Perfect was a legitimate cultural phenomenon when it came out, and I can’t say I didn’t get swept up in it at the time. I know I probably sound like I don’t like this movie, but that couldn’t be further from the truth—this movie was my life back in 2012, perhaps because I could relate on some level, given that it got big right when I was about to graduate high school and enter college. And I’m not exaggerating when I say that it was my life; I binge watched this movie repeatedly back in those days, sometimes by myself, sometimes with my friends at sleepovers. And given that most of my friends from this time were very musically inclined people, you bet your ass we attempted to replicate the movie’s signature scenes, right down to planning riff-off parties in an ambitious emulation of the film’s signature scene. We could recite every line of this movie from memory at one point; that’s how ingrained it was in our minds.\n\nBut it’s also a film that speaks to a very specific moment of time, not just for me personally, but for pop culture at large, which is why it’s become a lot harder to truly appreciate this film as the years have gone by. I don’t think it’s a bad film, of course; it’s perfectly enjoyable and I still have affection for it to this day, but this is a movie that’s very much rooted in its era and I’m not sure how well it plays outside of that context. It came out right in that early 2010s post-Glee wave of musical TV shows and movies, most of which were set in either high school or college, usually featuring preppy suburbs kids forming musical groups of their own, usually by way of an underdog rags-to-riches type, and would usually end with a moral about embracing the weird, quirky or unique aspects of your personality. It’s a very early 2010s type of story, coinciding with the rapid rise of geek culture in the mainstream and combining it with the then-dominant musical paradigm of poptimism, in which the Pop Star was being subject to the same critical consideration normally reserved to “serious” artistes. Which, of course, meant that this movie featured plenty of covers and musical moments to round out the soundtrack sales, which of course Pitch Perfect sold by the dozen, considering its eclectic selection of acapella covers of classic and contemporary pop music.\n\nAnd again, I’m not saying that Pitch Perfect is a derivative story per se; there’s a reason it stood out from the glut to be one of the better-remembered movies from this era, but at the same time, it does hit a lot of the most familiar story beats of that era, enough that it’s difficult for it to have the same appeal in this day and age. Pitch Perfect is the kind of multimedia phenomenon that could only truly have succeeded in the iTunes Big Pop generation where singles were the dominant mode of releasing music, everyone was listening to the same thing and there was still a monoculture to call back to, and where upbeat, candy-coated and easy-to-replicate party jams were the biggest trend in music. Basically, it’s the complete opposite of our modern pop cultural landscape, where everything is so splintered, idiosyncratic and rooted in very specific cultural frameworks that don’t lend themselves well to parody or reinterpretation. The same trends that helped Pitch Perfect become such a big success just don’t exist in the 2020s anymore; and even if they did, what music would they even be able to choose from? Can you imagine them doing “Bad Guy” or “As It Was” or “Thot Shit”? *shudders*\n\nAnd yet, it was successful enough for the time that it actually managed to spawn an actual charting hit in 2013 –\n\nThis is going to require a bit of backstory, so bear with me here—but the long and short of it is that Anna Kendrick and the film’s writers caught wind of the Anan Burden rendition of the cups song, and became so fond of it that they thought it would make a great sequence for Anna’s character Beca. Specifically, the cup game is used in the scene where Beca auditions for the Barden Bellas. Like I said, at this point in the movie, the Barden Bellas have lost most of their core membership, and their humiliation at the least year’s collegiate acapella finals continues to haunt what remains of the group, so in the present day, they’re looking to build an all-star lineup that’ll take them all the way to the top. Of course, the auditions for both the Treblemakers and the Bellas are taking place at roughly the same time, and each of the auditionees are asked to sing “Since U Been Gone”, which, of course, is consolidated into one musical number which, quite honestly, might be the most instantly recognizable number in the movie. I’m not joking—I hear “zoom zoom zoom zoom” and my mind immediately pivots to the Pitch Perfect rendition, almost as if on cue.\n\nBut Beca, who’s really only doing this because her father is encouraging her to step outside her smug sardonic comfort zone and actually participate in society, stumbles into the audition, completely unaware that there was a required song for the auditionees to perform. So instead, she awkwardly pulls a makeshift performance out of her ass by taking the cup holder on judges Aubrey and Chloe’s desk, and of course, using it to perform the cup song.\n\nIt’s supposed to illustrate her offbeat awkwardness and unconventional musical identity; the fact of her using a viral internet meme to audition for a professional collegiate acapella group. And of course, it wins Chloe over completely, though Aubrey is left skeptical. Nonetheless, it’s enough talent for the Bellas (who are desperate at this point) to allow her into the group.\n\nAnd as we now all know, this became one of the film’s signature scenes, which is wild when you really think about it. Because let’s be real—this scene is a throwaway scene. It’s a barely two-minute musical number without any real musical backing behind it, and Kendrick’s vocal performance isn’t exactly showstopping. The fact that this scene managed to stand the test of time and outshine all of the film’s other big musical moments, I think it speaks to how surprisingly forgettable most of the film’s music actually is. There’s a reason acapella has always struggled for mainstream success or any sort of coolness factor, and it’s that you simply can’t sustain a mainstream career doing just acapella. Most people aren’t willing to listen to an entire CDs worth of mouth noises and beatboxing (ask Bobby McFerrin). The only other group who’s managed something resembling a real career making acapella music is Pentatonix, and they rely equally as much on their videos, gimmicks and visual presentation to sustain interest in their work. And this problem unfortunately infects most of Pitch Perfect’s songs—the musical highlights people actually remember are those where a character does something funny, or those that rely on a unique gimmick or big character moment to stand out. Hell, even the film’s supposed musical climax, when the Barden Bellas perform their big number at the collegiate acapella finals, it’s probably the least memorable part of the film.\n\nBy contrast, I think the big reason why the “Cups” scene works so well was that it was, ironically, somehow the least, and most acapella part of the entire movie. Acapella is an art form that relies on not using any instruments, and so by using a cup (which technically functions as an instrument), you’ve already lost the Game, haven’t you? This isn’t technically a purely acapella performance anymore. And yet, the fact that it’s only one girl, one voice, carrying this moment in the movie, that’s probably the purest expression of raw, unplugged, musicality yet, right? Right??\n\nOkay, maybe this tangent is a little forced. But nonetheless, “Cups” works because it fits into the movie’s pre-existing framework in a really clever way, like when a song is used in a movie or TV show and it’s so perfectly suited to soundtrack that scene that it becomes the signature scene, like “Don’t You Forget About Me” in The Breakfast Club or “In Your Eyes” from Say Anything. Which brings me to another big strength of the movie—it’s really good at spotting cultural signifiers and using them to great effect. The Barden Bellas have been creatively stagnant since the ‘90s and it’s perfectly illustrated by their choice to constantly perform “The Sign”, “Eternal Flame” and “Turn The Beat Around”, a playlist that was clearly assembled no later than 1995, every single year. Similarly, “Cups” perfectly illustrates the core of Beca’s character, as a quirky, “alternative” teenager who disdains mainstream culture, someone who would obviously gravitate towards breaking convention by performing an internet meme song as her big audition number. It breaks many of the traditional tropes around big “audition” numbers—it’s not a showstopper, it’s a perfectly ordinary performance that isn’t all that remarkable aside from the usage of a children’s trick like a cup game, and it works perfectly to characterize Beca and to set the tone of the movie going forward.\n\nSo it’s not surprising that a gimmicky song like “Cups”, which was already relying on a pre-existing internet meme, would be the one that made it big. And really, how could it not? It introduced millions of people (like me) to the cup game, and the fact that it’s a relatively simple technique that allows you to produce intricate-sounding percussion meant that it was an easy party trick to replicate along with friends. The aforementioned group I binged this movie with constantly? Yeah, we were doing this shit all the time back in 2013 and having lots of fun with it. And of course, it led to an entire cottage industry of people attempting to replicate the cup game, usually to this song, but sometimes set to other songs (one popular choice was Robyn’s “Call Your Girlfriend”, which had its own cup game rendition go viral sometime around this era).\n\nAll of this, combined with the movie’s overnight success, led to the “Cups” song surging in popularity until the demand for it simply could not be ignored. And so… it got a studio version.\n\nYeah, that’s right, they made a studio version for the goddamn cups song. And what did they set it to? Of course, given its origins, and given that it was the year 2013, they of course chose to transliterate the original’s folk and country origins into a Mumford and Sons-type arrangement, except with cups to mimic the Mumfords’ frenetic lightning percussion. On some level, I think it’s a perfectly logical way to bring this song into the new millennium—the song always did have that sense of bittersweet longing that lends itself well to soulful folk arrangements, and the timing was also on their side given that there was a burgeoning folk revival full of acts injecting their folk arrangements with diverse musical ideas, acts like the Mumfords, the Lumineers, Philip Philipps, Of Monsters and Men, Kodaline, Ellie Goulding, Ed Sheeran. It was a good time to be a folk musician, let’s say. And while the original “When I’m Gone” was more of a country song than a folk song, the important thing is that it was reminiscent of rural Americana, and that was the sound it would be set to when it was revived for this studio version.\n\nOn the other hand, I can’t say this arrangement works, exactly. They had to cling on to the whole “cups” conceit because that’s what the song is built on, but in this context, it take you completely out of the homedown folksy arrangement they’re going for. And I’m also not a fan of how intricate the arrangement of this song is. The charm of “When I’m Gone”, in its every incarnation, is that it’s a simple, laid-back song with a stripped-down arrangement and that it doesn’t take itself too seriously. It’s a serious song, but it’s also a relaxed, peaceful song; it doesn’t really lend itself well to this kind of showy, theatrical arrangement. I always imagined this song to have something more of a groove and a swing, mostly because of how the verses flow, and that was something that was greatly enhanced by the relative simplicity of the cup rhythm. It doesn’t work when that rhythm is being drowned out by a shotgun blast of percussion and layers upon layers of strings and keys. Lastly, it’s way too short to really register. Granted, the original cup song was also short, but that was because it was an avant-garde experiment by a bunch of teenagers on Youtube. If you’re going to go all out and actually record a studio version, then record something with more meat on it, at least.\n\nRegardless of what I thought of it, this song definitely had its moment in the sun, going on to become one of the biggest hits of 2013, starting a veritable trend of meme-able movie soundtrack cuts charting on the Hot 100. Right after this, we would have the avalanche success of “Let It Go”, and the year after you had the Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 and its big folksy soundtrack hit “The Hanging Tree” , which even managed to out-chart the Lorde song that was supposed to be the big hit off the soundtrack. And these were all hits that were powered not by the industry, but by the buying power of the public. Again, this was when ordinary internet weirdos like us were discovering that power, and as the many chart oddities of the early 2010s shows, we were learning how to use that power in increasingly disturbing ways.\n\nThe verdict:\n\nIt’s hard to really have a verdict for this one, because I’m not actually evaluating a cover here, I’m tracing the history of a veritable modern folk song.\n\n“Cups (When I’m Gone)” has had such an odd evolution, from ‘30s Americana to mid-2010s viral novelty, that it’s really one of those stories where the joy lies in the telling. Even if you don’t particularly like this song, you have to respect the journey it’s taken. It’s a song whose roots lay in the very dawn of pop music, and the fact that it took this long to properly hit the mainstream heights it did, it’s certainly something. Talk about your ticket for the long way ‘round."
