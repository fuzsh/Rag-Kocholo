        "text": "Anna Kendrick is a bit tired. She’s been doing interviews most of the day for her new film, “Pitch Perfect,” a fun, funny musical riff on the crazy world of college a cappella groups. Yes, the same ones that were featured in the now canceled NBC show “The Sing-Off,” which had as judges Ben Folds and Sara Bareilles, who had been in an a cappella group at UCLA.\n\nCoincidentally, Kendrick, 27, just did a music video for Folds’ new album, which also featured the characters from “Fraggle Rock.”\n\n“I’m a fan of Ben Folds and I’m a fan of the Fraggles; so it was really a dream job that it fell in my lap,” she says. “I grew up watching `Muppet Family Christmas,’ which had the Muppets, the Fraggles and the characters from Sesame Street.”\n\nFolds had gotten interested in college a cappella groups when he discovered YouTube videos of them singing his songs. Kendrick, who received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of George Clooney’s character’s feisty co-worker in “Up in the Air,” says she first learned about them when she moved to Los Angeles.\n\n“I was 18 or 19 and I had a friend who had a crush on a guy who was either in the USC or UCLA a cappella group and she dragged me along to a competition between the schools,” Kendrick remembers. “I thought it would be the most painful experience of my life. But by the end of the evening I was thinking these people are rock stars. So even if it is a sort of a dorky sort of subgenre of performance, they are stars within their own little world,” she says.\n\nKendrick admits to coming from her own “dorky little world” – Broadway, where she was the second-youngest Tony nominee ever for her role in the 1998 musical “High Society” and appeared in the New York City Opera production of “A Little Night Music” with Jeremy Irons in 2003.\n\nHer career might be seen as sort of unexpected. Her father was a teacher and mother an accountant in Maine when Kendrick got the performing bug at age 5. She says her parents didn’t know anything about getting her into show business but were willing to help her, and by age 10 she was auditioning in New York City.\n\nBroadway is, of course, bigger than the college a cappella world, but it’s not as big as film or television. Kendrick points out that people like Sutton Foster and Audra McDonald – who have respectable TV and film careers – are like the musical theater’s version of Beyonce.\n\n“I think the a cappella world has its own Beyonces,” Kendrick says.\n\nOne of them could well be her character in “Pitch Perfect,” which is the first feature film from stage director Jason Moore (“Avenue Q”). Kendrick plays Beca, a sort of too hip for her own good university freshman who is recruited for an all-female a cappella group named the Bellas. It’s run by an uptight Aubrey (Anna Camp) and her looser pal Chloe (Brittany Snow), who discovers Beca’s singing talents when she confronts her in the shower.\n\nThe film is based on the nonfiction book “Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory” by Mickey Rapkin. One of its producers is actress Elizabeth Banks, who plays a caustic commentator – a la “Best in Show” – at the competitions.\n\n“The character of Beca needed to be someone who was grounded … funny and empathetic and who we all can relate to and root for,” Banks says. “Anna is all of those things.”\n\nKendrick also can be seen in a very different role opposite Jake Gyllenhaal in the gritty cop drama “End of Watch,” which opened last week. The New York Times review called her “sexily cast against type.” “I have no idea how to take that, but I’ll take it. I guess,” Kendrick says.\n\nThe actress says filming “Pitch Perfect” proved hard work. That was partly because the songs in the film kept changing. And though the dancing was a little out of her comfort zone, she says, “The other girls really inspired me to work hard. It was great to have everybody’s energy.”\n\nShe also insisted that whenever she was singing on her own in the movie that it was live. Ensemble pieces, though, were another matter. “Too many moving pieces,” she says.\n\nOne of the songs she does as part of a riff-off – an impromptu competition between groups – is “No Diggity,” originally by Blackstreet with a rap by Dr. Dre.\n\n“I really love that song,” she says. “It was fun, but at the same time I had never done the rap before. When I used to listen to it in my car or wherever, I used to wait for the melody to start and then I would start singing along to it. So doing the rap was – a little humiliating but funny.”\n\nKendrick says her character is someone who thinks she’s really cool and secretly isn’t.\n\n“She thinks she’s above these dorky a cappella girls,” the actress says. “So I liked those situations where she was kind of embarrassed and out of her element.”\n\nDoes she have anything in common with Beca?\n\n“Well, I know that I’m not cool,” she says with a smile. “So that’s pretty easy.”\n\nRob Lowman\n\n818-713-3687\n\nrobert.lowman@dailynews.com"
