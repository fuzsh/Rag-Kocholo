It features an ensemble cast, including Anna Kendrick, Skylar Astin, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Ester Dean, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, Adam DeVine, Ben Platt, John Michael Higgins, and Elizabeth Banks. The plot follows a college women's a cappella group, The Barden Bellas, as they compete against another a cappella group from their college to win Nationals. The film is loosely adapted from Mickey Rapkin's non-fiction book, titled Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory. Filming concluded in December 2011, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nThe film premiered in Los Angeles on September 24, 2012. Released on September 28, 2012 in the United States, the film received positive reviews from critics. It became a sleeper hit and earned over $115 million worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing music comedy film of all time behind School of Rock. A sequel, Pitch Perfect 2, was released on May 15, 2015, and was more financially successful than its predecessor. A second sequel, Pitch Perfect 3, was released on December 22, 2017."
