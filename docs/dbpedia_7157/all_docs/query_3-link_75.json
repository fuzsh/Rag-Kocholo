        "text": "Stories You May Like\n\nShort film The Anne Frank Gift Shop uses wry humor to ponder how to make today’s youth understand the vital lessons of history\n\nBy Joe Wilensky\n\nMickey Rapkin ’00 is best known for writing Pitch Perfect, the nonfiction book on the competitive collegiate a cappella scene (and on which the hit movie series was based). But his latest project delves into far weightier subjects.\n\nRapkin wrote and directed The Anne Frank Gift Shop, a new short film—billed as “a really dark comedy”—that is simultaneously humorous, satirical, and deeply emotional.\n\nSuch as: tweaking Anne’s smile in images of her; pitching a true-crime podcast (Who Betrayed Anne Frank?) to museum visitors; having a Holocaust survivor answer questions in the gift shop; and building a fictional Instagram account around Anne’s cat.\n\n“For all of the comedy here—and The Anne Frank Gift Shop is a comedy, first—this film is personal,” Rapkin says. “It’s very Jewish to use comedy to process trauma.”\n\nFor all of the comedy here—and The Anne Frank Gift Shop is a comedy, first—this film is personal.\n\nThe movie premiered at the 2023 L.A. Short Film Festival and has since been featured at festivals in San Francisco and Atlanta.\n\nMore screenings are scheduled for April in Annapolis, Cleveland, and Miami; future showings and dates can be found on Instagram.\n\n(And a trailer for the film is viewable on YouTube.)\n\nStories You May Like\n\nThe Jewish culture site Kveller called the film “joltingly, infectiously funny,” adding: “With every disarming peal of laughter, Rapkin and the movie’s characters also manage to open and soften the audience, allowing them to impart some inalienable truths about the Holocaust and its memory.”\n\nIn a piece titled “How Do You Market Anne Frank to Gen Z?,” GQ notes the “darkly funny and ultimately moving turns by a strong cast” and says the film “provides a poignant meta-commentary on our continually robust Anne Frank discourse.”\n\nThe idea for The Anne Frank Gift Shop, he says, stemmed from a 2020 study indicating that a majority of young Americans don’t know basic facts about the Holocaust.\n\n“Two-thirds couldn’t tell you how many Jews were killed; 11% somehow believe Jews ‘caused’ the Holocaust,” Rapkin says. “This isn’t ancient history. If Anne Frank were alive today, she’d be three years younger than Mel Brooks—and he just had a show on Hulu.”\n\nIn the film, Burton (as one of the museum reps) gives voice to Rapkin’s mission to keep the Holocaust’s memory alive—and underscores how vital it is that humanity never forgets.\n\n“I do not know how to reach young people,” she says. “But the cost of doing nothing—that I do know. We have to tell this story, again and again and again. Every which way. Or it will happen again.”\n\nTop: Rapkin at the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival in 2023.
