        "text": "Universal Pictures\n\nJason Moore\n\nElizabeth Banks\n\nMax Handelman\n\nmain title sequence for Universal Pictures\n\nShine designed and animated the main and end title sequence for Universal’s “Pitch Perfect.” The sequences were designed using a combination of dynamic 2D and 3D graphic animation that link up and are integrated with live action photography from the film. The main title was intended to take the audience inside the main character, Beca’s (Anna Kendrick) sound mixing interface and to show her passion for being a DJ and mashing up songs. The original interface design is portrayed through sound waves animating to the music.\n\nDirector Jason Moore said, “I am thrilled with the work Shine did!”\n\nPitch Perfect is a musical comedy film directed by Jason Moore. Featuring an ensemble cast, including Anna Kendrick, Skylar Astin, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Ester Dean, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, Adam DeVine, Ben Platt, with John Michael Higgins, and Elizabeth Banks. The plot follows a college women’s a cappella group, The Barden Bellas, as they compete against another a cappella group from their college to win Nationals. The film is loosely adapted from Mickey Rapkin’s non-fiction book, titled Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory.\n\nIn the story, at a national a cappella competition, Barden University’s all-female a cappella group, the Barden Bellas, perform well until Aubrey Posen (Anna Camp) vomits on stage during her solo. They are publicly humiliated, losing any chance of winning. Four months later, newly arrived Barden freshman Beca Mitchell (Anna Kendrick) has no desire to attend college, but she is forced to do so by her father (John Benjamin Hickey), a professor at the university, with whom Beca has a strained relationship. Wishing she could instead pursue a career as a music producer, Beca spends her time making mash-up mixes of songs and takes up an internship at the school radio station.\n\nThe film met with hugely positive reviews from critics. It became a hit and earned over $115 million worldwide, becoming the third highest grossing music comedy film of all time behind its sequel and School of Rock.\n\nPart of the design challenge was to create a sequence that described how a deejay mashes up music, and creates a piece of music that’s greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nJason Moore\n\nElizabeth Banks\n\nMax Handelman\n\nmain title sequence for Universal Pictures\n\nShine designed and animated the main and end title sequence for Universal’s “Pitch Perfect.” The sequences were designed using a combination of dynamic 2D and 3D graphic animation that link up and are integrated with live action photography from the film.
