        "text": "With a score of pop hits, \"Pitch Perfect 2\" was released May 15, 2015; the second chapter in the story about an all-female a cappella college singing group enjoyed the highest-grossing movie musical opening of all time. The sequel made over $180 million in box-office sales in the U.S. and more than $260 million worldwide. It has not yet been confirmed whether Elizabeth Banks, who was featured in both films and directed \"PP2,\" will return to direct \"PP3,\" though screenwriter Kay Cannon is tapped to pen the script. Banks (of Brownstone Productions) is scheduled to co-produce the new film and perform the role of Gail. Also confirmed for the cast are Hailee Steinfeld as Emily and Brittany Snow as Chloe.\n\nThe third film will be co-produced by Paul Brooks of Gold Circle Entertainment, Scott Niemeyer and Max Handelman, according to IMDB."
