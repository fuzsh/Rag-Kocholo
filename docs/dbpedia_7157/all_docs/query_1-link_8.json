She received a Tony nod at age 12 for the musical High Society, then went on to receive Film Independent Spirit Award buzz for the movies Camp (2003) and Rocket Science (2007) before landing an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress in Jason Reitman’s Up in the Air (2009). She soon achieved global recognition through the Twilight series as Bella’s bubbly school friend Jessica and remained with the franchise until Breaking Dawn - Part 1 in 2011.\n\nFollowing the success of Pitch Perfect, Kendrick has returned for two sequels, Pitch Perfect 2 and Pitch Perfect 3. She continued to sing on-screen in the 2014 film adaptations of Broadway musicals The Last Five Years and Into the Woods, the latter alongside an all-star cast including Meryl Streep. She has also starred in the Max anthology series Love Life and the movies A Simple Favor (2018), Trolls (2016) and its sequels, and the comedy Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (2016) with Pitch Perfect costar Adam DeVine.\n\nIn 2016, Kendrick released her memoir, Scrappy Little Nobody, and in 2022 began production on her directorial debut, The Dating Game, based on the real-life story of Cheryl Bradshaw, a contestant on the game show who matched with serial killer Rodney Alcala. Next up is a reunion with Blake Lively for A Simple Favor sequel.\n\nKenrick has been romantically linked with director Edgar Wright, cinematographer Ben Richardson, and actor/writer Bill Hader.\n\n02 of 13\n\nAnna Camp (Aubrey Posen)\n\nAnna Camp projectile vomited her way onto the big screen as the uptight, stage fright-afflicted Bellas co-captain Aubrey. Her career began in New York theater through a pair of Off-Broadway shows followed by a costarring performance with Daniel Radcliffe in the Broadway revival of Equus. She racked up several TV appearances on shows like The Office and Mad Men, enjoyed a recurring role as Sarah Newlin in True Blood, and had a small part in the Oscar-nominated film The Help (2011), before landing in the ensemble of Pitch Perfect.\n\nSince recovering from Aubrey’s performance anxiety, Camp, like many of her costars, returned for both follow-up films. She was a regular cast member on the first season of Mindy Kaling’s The Mindy Project; starred in the short-lived series Good Girls Revolt and Perfect Harmony; and reunited with her fellow Bella, Brittany Snow, for the short film Milkshake, written and directed by her former costar. She returned to theater in 2015 with Verité, and again in 2018 and 2022 for the productions Belleville and 2:22 A Ghost Story.\n\nCamp and Pitch Perfect castmate Skylar Astin married in 2016. The couple divorced in 2019 citing “irreconcilable differences.”\n\n03 of 13\n\nBrittany Snow (Chloe Beale)\n\nBrittany Snow made her modeling debut at age 3, then as a teenager joined the CBS soap Guiding Light before spending three seasons on the NBC drama American Dreams. Following the latter’s 2005 cancellation, Snow starred in the films The Pacifier (2005), John Tucker Must Die (2006), Hairspray (2007), and Prom Night (2008).\n\nAfter her time singing scales as Chloe, the bubbly co-leader of the Bellas, came to an end, Snow remained active with guest appearances on television and prominent roles in films like Someone Great (2019) and the Ti West slasher X (2022) with Mia Goth. The actress has stepped behind the camera as well. She reunited with Camp to write and direct the short Milkshake before making her feature directorial debut with 2023’s Parachute, which she also co-wrote.\n\nOff-screen, Snow has been involved in numerous charitable endeavors and co-created the Love Is Louder mental health awareness campaign, for which she received the Special Recognition Voice Award from SAMHSA in 2015. She has continued to raise awareness for this cause and co-founded the charity September Letters in 2016 with Jesper Guest, and the duo has since released a book of the same name. While promoting the book, Snow revealed she and the Pitch Perfect cast have remained close, and she leaned on one unnamed costar in particular after a year filled with personal struggles.\n\nShe wed Selling the OC’s Tyler Stanaland in 2020. The couple divorced in 2023.\n\n04 of 13\n\nRebel Wilson (Patricia “Fat Amy” Hobart)\n\nRebel Wilson first rose to prominence in her native Australia before bursting onto the world stage with a supporting turn in the Oscar-nominated comedy Bridesmaids (2011). She followed this success with roles in What to Expect When You’re Expecting (2012), Bachelorette (2012), and a guest appearance on future Pitch Perfect love interest Adam DeVine’s sitcom Workaholics before she was cast as the Bella’s resident goofball \"Fat Amy,\" a.k.a. \"Fat Patricia.\"\n\nNext came the Michael Bay drama Pain and Gain (2013) before headlining her own sitcom, Super Fun Night, for one season on ABC. She gathered her fellow Pitches together in 2016 for a mini-reunion to celebrate her 36th birthday and teamed up with DeVine once again for Isn’t It Romantic in 2019. Wilson continued to bring the laughs in Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb (2014), The Hustle (2019), and Senior Year (2022). She also had roles in Taika Waititi’s Jojo Rabbit and the unintentional comedy Cats (2019).\n\nIn 2023, Wilson revealed her Pitch Perfect contract prevented her from losing weight, and she spoke openly about her decision to pursue a healthier lifestyle after consulting with a fertility doctor. The actress and comedian came out in June 2022 with an Instagram post sharing her relationship with jewelry designer Ramona Agruma. Her statement came ahead of a Sydney Morning Herald piece planning to out the couple. In November 2022, she announced the birth of her first child, Royce Lillian, via surrogate.\n\n05 of 13\n\nAdam DeVine (Bumper Allen)\n\nThe early life of Adam DeVine, the actor behind antagonist Treblemaker Bumper Allen, is a little more hard-hitting than most. At age 11, he was run over by a cement truck, and after two weeks in a coma and extensive surgery, he found healing through comedy. As an adult, DeVine moved to Los Angeles and formed the sketch group Mail Order Comedy, which eventually led to his Comedy Central series Workaholics.\n\nAfter joining the Pitch Perfect franchise, DeVine continued starring in Workaholics and created the stand-up/sitcom hybrid Adam DeVine’s House Party, which ran for three seasons. He shared a reunion with Anna Kendrick in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (2016) then reunited with Pitch Perfect love interest Rebel Wilson in Isn’t It Romantic (2019). He also starred in Game Over Man, Magic Camp, and the HBO televangelist comedy The Righteous Gemstones. In 2022, DeVine returned to the world of a cappella singing for the Peacock series Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin, which found the former villain chasing fame as a singer in Germany.\n\nDeVine married actress Chloe Bridges in 2021.\n\n06 of 13\n\nSkylar Astin (Jesse Swanson)\n\nSkylar Astin made his acting debut in the original Broadway production of the Tony-winning musical Spring Awakening with Jonathan Groff and Lea Michele. His film debut soon followed with the cult comedy Hamlet 2 (2008), and after several small roles in television, he joined the Barden Treblemakers as an aspiring film composer and Beca’s love interest, Jesse.\n\nAfter Jesse and Beca’s romantic crescendo, he returned for Pitch Perfect 2, but unfortunately, he and the Treblemakers didn’t make the cut for the third installment. He did, however, snag a voiceover role in Wreck-It Ralph (2012), followed by an appearance in the 2013 comedy 21 and Older led by Miles Teller. From 2013 to 2015, he could be seen on the TBS sitcom Ground Floor before joining the cast of Trolls: The Beat Goes On. He went on to appear in the musical series Zooey’s Extraordinary Playlist, as well as its follow-up special, Zooey’s Extraordinary Christmas. In 2021, Astin released his debut single, \"Without You.\" He currently costars with Marcia Gay Harden on the CBS series So Help Me Todd.\n\nAstin and Pitch Perfect castmate Anna Camp married in 2016. They later divorced in 2019.\n\n07 of 13\n\nElizabeth Banks (Gail Abernathy-McKadden)\n\nThe actress behind unfiltered ICAA commentator Gail Abernathy-McKadden was familiar to audiences when Pitch Perfect arrived in 2012. Elizabeth Banks played Betty Brant in the original Spider-Man trilogy, then starred in The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005), Invincible (2006), Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008), and The LEGO Movie (2014). She also appeared in series like Scrubs, 30 Rock, Modern Family, and worked alongside future Barden Bella Rebel Wilson in the comedy What to Expect When You’re Expecting (2012).\n\nBanks, a co-producer on the original film, made her feature directorial debut with Pitch Perfect 2. The sequel became the highest-grossing movie musical opening of the time. She continued to appear as Effie Trinket in The Hunger Games franchise and has remained busy ever since. She wrote, directed, and produced the 2019 Charlie’s Angels reboot and spearheaded the horror-comedy hit Cocaine Bear (2023). She also produced the Peacock spin-off Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin with Adam DeVine and revealed she was inspired by Marvel's Loki. In 2023, Banks starred in the comedy The Beanie Bubble about the ‘90s Beanie Baby phenomenon. Next up is the animated Flintstones update, Bedrock, where she’ll voice Pebbles Flintstone.\n\nBanks and her Brownstone Productions producing partner, Max Handelman, have been married since 2003. The couple shares two sons.\n\n08 of 13\n\nBen Platt (Benji Applebaum)\n\nBefore he brought his pipes to the Barden Treblemakers as illusionist Benji Applebaum, Ben Platt had only one other film credit to his name as Boy Scout #1 in Red Riding Hood (2006) with Henry Cavill. Although he had a short filmography, he was already an accomplished stage actor by age 9, appearing in a production of The Music Man alongside Kristin Chenoweth.\n\nPlatt has been busy since performing his last magic trick at Barden University. He went on to originate the title role in Dear Evan Hansen and became the youngest solo winner of the Tony for Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical. The role also earned him a Daytime Emmy and a Grammy. Platt returned for Pitch Perfect 2, then headlined the Ryan Murphy satire The Politician on Netflix before reprising the part of Evan Hansen for the less well-received 2021 film adaptation. Platt’s song “Grow as We Go” can also notably be heard in the 2022 film Senior Year (which stars his Pitch Perfect castmate Rebel Wilson). He recently received his second Tony nomination for the Broadway revival of Parade and starred with his fiancé, Noah Galvin, in the mockumentary film Theater Camp (2023).\n\n09 of 13\n\nJohn Michael Higgins (John Smith)\n\nA veteran actor of nearly 40 years, John Michael Higgins stepped behind the mic as snarky ICCA commentator John Smith. Prior to his Pitch Perfect gig, audiences might have seen him in Ally McBeal, Seinfeld, Arrested Development, one of his collaborations with filmmaker Christopher Guest — including Best in Show (2000) and A Mighty Wind (2003) — or as David Letterman in the TV movie The Late Shift (1996). He also starred in the Jim Carrey film Yes Man (2008).\n\nAfter Pitch Perfect wrapped, Higgins starred as vain news anchor Chuck Pierce on the underrated Tina Fey-produced sitcom Great News with Nicole Richie and lent his voice to Mini Max on the animated series Big Hero 6. He also played Principal Toddman on the Peacock reboot of Saved by the Bell, and in addition to appearing in the Pitch Perfect sequels, he was part of the ensemble cast of Paul Thomas Anderson’s Oscar-nominated film Licorice Pizza (2021). Higgins has been the host of the GSN game show America Says since 2018.\n\n10 of 13\n\nHana Mae Lee (Lilly Onakuramara)\n\nHana Mae Lee was a successful fashion designer, makeup artist, and model before landing her breakout film role as quirky Bella Lilly Onakuramara. In 2009, she transitioned to stand-up comedy and has since focused her creative energies on her career as a performer. Prior to Pitch Perfect, she worked with on-screen rival Adam DeVine for one episode of his series Workaholics.\n\nAfter Pitch Perfect, she booked a three-episode arc on the Rebel Wilson sitcom Super Fun Night, then portrayed a member of the devious rock band the Misfits in the live-action adaptation of the classic '80s cartoon Jem and the Holograms (2015).

She traded in high-pitched notes for high-pitched screams in the horror films Grace: The Possession (2014), The Accursed (2022), and Phobias (2021). The actress then landed a starring role — and a prince — in the holiday romance My Christmas Prince (2017). She reunited with her fellow Bellas in 2020 via Elizabeth Bank’s Instagram for a virtual a cappella performance in support of UNICEF’s efforts to “help children in Lebanon and around the world” affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nKnapp shares a daughter, Kai, with actor Ryan Phillippe.\n\n12 of 13\n\nEster Dean (Cynthia-Rose Adams)\n\nEster Dean, the actress behind Cynthia-Rose, the tomboyish Bella with a secret gambling problem, was an accomplished songwriter long before lending her vocal talents to the musical franchise.

A former MTV Desi VJ, he has been a member of the improv hip-hop group Freestyle Love Supreme under the stage name UTK the INC since 2005. He originated the role of Aaron Burr in workshop readings of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s seismic musical Hamilton, but the performer, who has been sober since 2014, lost the role due to issues surrounding his sobriety.\n\nAlthough he only appeared in the first Pitch Perfect film, Ambudkar reunited with fellow Treblemaker Skylar Astin in Trolls: The Beat Goes On and with Adam DeVine in Game Over, Man (2018). He has also starred in the movies Ride Along 2 (2016), Barbershop: The Next Cut (2016), and Brittany Runs a Marathon (2019).
