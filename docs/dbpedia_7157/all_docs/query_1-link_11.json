        "text": "Thanks to Pitch Perfect's outstanding cast, the trilogy was a phenomenon. Of course, the ensemble memorably includes Rebel Wilson as fan-favorite Fat Amy. The character’s rambunctious behavior helped carry the Baden Bellas for all three films, especially since she had moments like that infamous Pitch Perfect 2 wardrobe malfunction. However, she almost wasn't able to star in all three films. Now, the Fat Amy actress has revealed why the OG cast was nearly replaced for the threequel, and how she helped change those plans.\n\nThe Pitch Perfect alum made the shocking revelation in her memoir Rebel Rising (via Insider). This possible change-up came on the heels of the sequel’s tremendous box office success, grossing over $287 million worldwide. Despite its success, the franchise’s home studio, Universal Pictures, wanted to refresh the franchise before filming for the third flick began. Wilson mentioned the Barden Bellas’ ages played a role in the suggested change, saying:\n\nIt’s understandable that Wilson and co. felt underappreciated and undermined after making the franchise quite successful. The first film was a sleeper hit-turned-cultural phenomenon, grossing over $115 million and bringing acapella to the mainstream. Of course, Pitch Perfect 2 appeared to set up Hailee Steinfeld as the next Barden Bella leader. However, it was the OG Bellas who helped the sequel to double the original’s gross.\n\nThe Senior Year star went into further detail, saying Universal wanted her, Anna Kendrick, and the OG Barden Bellas to do a pass-the-torch scene with Steinfeld. However, Wilson had a secret weapon in her back pocket – her law degree. The Hollywood star used her degree to help the group, saying:\n\nThe sequel’s success helped Wilson and her co-stars secure their spots in Pitch Perfect 3. They used the box office numbers and research group data, which included Wilson’s housekeeper’s niece. She even got a huge payday of $10 million for the threequel. The comedic actress claimed she tried to get everyone to renegotiate, but managers got in the way.\n\nThe Pitch Perfect 3 story isn’t the first secret spilled from Rebel Wilson’s memoir. She called out former co-star Sacha Baron Cohen for allegedly creating a challenging on-set experience for her, which he adamantly denied."
