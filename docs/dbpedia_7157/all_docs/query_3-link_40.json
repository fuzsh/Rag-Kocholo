        "text": "Some of you might have watched the American musical comedy film Pitch Perfect, released in the UK in 2013, featuring Anna Kendrick and produced by Universal studios.\n\nThe film tells the story of an all-girl a cappella group from Barden University called the Barden Bellas who compete against other groups from their college to win Nationals.\n\nWhat does a cappella mean?\n\n‘A cappella’ is an Italian word which means ‘In the manner of the chapel’. In music, it is used when singers perform together without the accompaniment of musical instruments.\n\nHere are three examples of a cappella groups who sing in very different styles:\n\nStile Antiquo sing ‘Ave Maria, Virgo Serena’ by Josquin Des Prez who was a French composer of the Renaissance (1450/55-1521).\n\nHis music was sung in church.\n\nIn this video, OneVoice sing ‘I want you back’ by The Jackson 5. The group is made of students from a High School in Memphis in America.\n\nThey use beatboxing with the a cappella voices.\n\nBeatboxing imitates percussion instruments using mouth, lips, tongue and voice.\n\nIn a more classical style, VOCES8 sing ‘Sleep’ by Eric Whitacre who is an American composer and conductor who still writes music for choirs today.\n\nWhat do all of these videos have in common?\n\nCan you remember how to call music which is performed without any instruments?\n\nWhich video was your favourite? Why?\n\nLet’s come back to the film Pitch Perfect.\n\nThere is a famous scene where the main character Becca, played by Anna Kendrick, sings a folk song from the 1930s called ‘When I’m gone’. It is also known as ‘The Cup Song’ as she use a cup to make rhythms to accompany her singing.\n\nThe song was so popular that they even made a music video for it which you can watch here…\n\nNow its time for you to have a go!\n\nWhat you will need:\n\nA plastic cup.\n\nBefore we start, we need to warm up our voices with Jenny:\n\nAre you ready for the final performance? Join in with Jenny and Nicola. Good luck!\n\nIf you want, take a video of you doing this challenge and share it with us on social media using #ONLittleSchool"
