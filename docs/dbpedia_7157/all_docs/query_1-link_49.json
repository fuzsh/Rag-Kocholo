        "text": "Perfect Harmony is a musical comedy about the greatest a cappella group in high school history, 18-time national champions The Acafellas. It’s also about their classmates and female counterpart, perennial runners-up The Ladies in Red. Through song and story, we see these students grapple with the weighty issues of truth, love and what constitutes appropriate choreography for Nationals. As the story unfolds, we learn not just about these students themselves but also about the true nature of harmony.\n\nPerfect Harmony features songs made international hits by The Jackson 5, Pat Benatar, Billy Idol, Marvin Gaye, Scandal, Tiffany, The Romantics, The Pretenders, Blue Swede, The Temptations, The Contours, The Commodores, Tommy James & the Shondells, B.J. Thomas, The Partridge Family and more!\n\nFEATURING THE SONGS...\n\n“Back On The Chain Gang” by The Pretenders\n\n“Do You Love Me” by The Contours\n\n“Easy” by The Commodores\n\n“Get Ready” by The Temptations\n\n“Goodbye To You” by Scandal\n\n“Hooked On A Feeling” by Blue Swede / B.J. Thomas\n\n“I Think I Love You” by The Partridge Family\n\n“I Think We’re Alone Now” by Tiffany\n\n“I Want You Back” by The Jackson 5\n\n“Mony Mony” by Billy Idol / Tommy James & the Shondells\n\n“Sexual Healing” by Marvin Gaye*\n\n“Three Times A Lady” by The Commodores\n\n“We Belong” by Pat Benatar\n\n“What I Like About You” by The Romantics\n\n* “Sexual Healing” may be replaced with “Hooked On A Feeling”\n\nPHILIP FELLOWES V - (High School Senior) A third generation Acafella, slightly stuffy, somewhat pompous but also has a strong sense of inherent decency. Lassiter’s best friend, though they can’t speak to each other directly. Generally supportive of the group and other members, but desperately wants to win Nationals … at all costs. Begins to crack, crumbling under the pressure he has placed on himself and the group. Becomes a tenor during the the story (or at least demonstrates strong command of a much higher register).\n\nLASSITER A. JAYSON III - (High School Senior) Pitchpipe of the Acafellas. Considers himself an artist; intensely searching for “truth” – in his art, his friendships, and himself. Passionate about artistic purity; worries the group is too obsessed with winning. Takes himself very seriously. Looking to push the group in a new direction, one he believes is bolder and more creative.\n\nJASPER MERGH - (High School Junior) Handsome, charismatic, surprisingly, something of a school heartthrob. Not mute per se, although he doesn’t speak, he has a stunning singing voice. He’s dated Melody since freshman year. Good-hearted, just wants to sing and share his song.\n\nJB SMOOTER - (High School Senior) Jock. Quarterback turned singer. Women swoon for him. Dudes want to be him. Now that he’s discovered a cappella, he just wants to sing with the guys. Viewed by some as not particularly bright, he’s a good guy and positive influence on the others in the group.\n\nSIMON DEPARDIEU - (High School Freshman) Not yet an Acafella at the start of the play, he has dreamed of making the group and practices his song for his mom every night; just hopes his canker sores and occasional bouts of lockjaw don’t interfere with his audition. Kind, gentle. Has a crush on Valerie.\n\nMELODY MCDANIELS - (High School Senior) Both Pitch and President of The Ladies in Red. Pretty, but doesn’t expect all the girls in the group to be pretty too; she’s not unrealistic. Talented, preternaturally poised, and ferociously hardworking; she wishes just once someone would give The Ladies in Red the proper credit they’ve worked so hard for. Yes, she and Jasper are dating, but her focus is on the group’s work.\n\nMICHAELA “MICKEY D” DHIARDEAUBOVIC - (High School Sophomore) Very happy to be in the group, even if she has to keep her participation a secret from her brother. Loves the girls, loves singing, Though she has a little trouble remembering the right words in English. Thinks that sometimes the other girls in the group are too uptight. Speaks with a Eastern European (Herzegovinian) accent.\n\nVALERIE SMOOTER - (High School Sophomore) It’s fair to say she doesn’t love performing, but she’s determined not to repeat last year’s debacle at Regionals where she panicked and locked herself in the janitor’s closet. Witty, cutting – hopefully just in her comments. Her older brother is the school’s resident hunk, JB.\n\nMEGHAN BEANS - (High School Junior) Pretty, but a bit of a live wire. She’s greatly misunderstood; doesn’t know why people are propagating rumors about her behavior. Really wishes the group could do more dancing and would have flashier costumes. She’s always wanted a solo. Jesus is the only one who understands her. But maybe Jasper would too, if she could just get to know him better. Totally a belter – to her, singing is less about the right pitch, and more about how you express yourself.\n\nKERRI TAYLOR - (High School Sophomore) Student Manager of The Ladies in Red. Doesn’t have Tourette’s, but it seems like it. She’d sing if there wasn’t the potential for onstage embarrassment. Loves being the manager, it’s a pretty essential position to the team’s success. Ideally, this actress should truly be a great belter.\n\nDR. LARRY MERGH - (Late 30s-Early 50s) School psychologist. Kind-hearted; knows how dangerous a cappella singing can be on a young mind. (This role can be tracked with Jasper Mergh.)\n\nGORAN DHIARDEAUBOVIC - (Early 20s) Older brother, only living relative and legal guardian to Mickey D. Angry, protective, controlling, but ultimately harmless. Speaks with a Eastern European (Herzegovinian) accent. (This role can be tracked with Simon Depardieu.)\n\nKIKI TUNE - (Mid 30s-Mid 50s) Brash talent agent. Predatory and unabashed about it. (This role can be tracked with Mickey D.)\n\nTOBI MCCLINTOCK - (Mid 30s-Late 60s) World-famous vocal therapist. She’s a “voice whisperer”, deeply empathetic, overly dramatic and excited about curing youngsters of their self-inflicted vocal traumas. (This role can be tracked with Kerri Taylor.)"
