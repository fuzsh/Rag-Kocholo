        "text": "“Orange Is the New Black” star Ruby Rose has begun negotiations to join Universal and Gold Circle’s next installment in the “Pitch Perfect” franchise.\n\nTrish Sie is taking over as director from Elizabeth Banks, who directed “Pitch Perfect 2.” Banks will reprise her role as Gail and remains on board as a producer along with Max Handelman of Brownstone Productions, and Paul Brooks of Gold Circle Entertainment.\n\nKay Cannon wrote the screenplay with additional drafts from Mike White and Dana Fox.\n\nPlot details and a description of Rose’s character have yet to be unveiled.\n\nThe pic is set to bow on Dec. 22, 2017. Vice president of production Sara Scott will oversee the project for Universal.\n\nJason Moore directed the original film and helped launch the franchise when the movie, which cost $15 million to produce, went on to overperform at the box office, paving the way for a second movie.\n\nAnna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, and Brittany Snow are all signed on to return for “Pitch Perfect 3.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nRose has a busy 2017, starting with “XXX: Return of Xander Cage,” where she’ll play one of the female leads opposite Vin Diesel. The movie opens on Jan. 20. She also appears in Screen Gems’ “Resident Evil: Final Chapter, which bows the following week, and soon after that, she has a juicy role in “John Wick 2” opposite Keanu Reeves."
