        "text": "The Pitches are coming back. But you probably already knew that.\n\nTwo years after Universal announced the release date for Pitch Perfect 3, the third installment in the a cappella comedy franchise, a lot has happened: The date has changed, the director has changed and a few details about the plot have finally come out, along with a new trailer.\n\nSo what do we know now? Glad you asked.\n\nHere's everything that director Trish Sie (who replaced Elizabeth Banks) and star Chrissie Fit (she plays bass Flo) told us about the new movie when we ran into them at the Crystal + Lucy Awards earlier this month.\n\nIt's being edited now\n\nSie (Step Up All In) took over the directing reins from Banks, who directed Pitch 2 and still plays Gail in the movie. Banks \"got really busy,\" says Sie. \"She's directing Charlie's Angels (the reboot set for 2019) and is helping to develop it. She's got two little kids. She's like, 'It's time to pass the baton, I've got a lot going on.' \"\n\nSie finished shooting in April and is editing the film now. \"It's almost done. It's great.\" The film's release date has been pushed from July to Dec.22.\n\nThe big stars are still in it\n\nThe main Pitches are back: Anna Kendrick (Beca), Hailee Steinfeld (Emily), Brittany Snow (Chloe), Anna Camp (Aubrey) and Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) return.\n\nThere are new characters, too\n\nOrange is the New Black star Ruby Rose makes her Pitch Perfect debut as Calamity, \"and she has a great voice,\" says Fit.\n\nWe'll learn more about Fat Amy\n\nWhy did Fat Amy give herself that nickname? That's probably something viewers will find out in this movie, which shows \"a little bit of Fat Amy's origin story,\" Sie says.\n\nThe Barden Bellas aren't at Barden anymore\n\n\"They're out in the real world,\" says Sie. \"They go on a USO tour\" to support the troops, \"and do not stay in the United States. We go all over the place.\"\n\nIt has songs that aren't on the radio yet\n\n\"Whatever makes me want to dance, that's what I go with,\" Sie says. She jokes that she and her music team used their \"crystal ball\" to pick pop songs for the movie that aren't yet on the airplay charts.\n\nThere's still a place for Pitch Perfect 4\n\n\"I feel like there's always going to be room for Pitch Perfect movies as long as people see them,\" says Fit. \"We've become a family, we all love each other.\"\n\nWatch the film's teaser trailer below."
