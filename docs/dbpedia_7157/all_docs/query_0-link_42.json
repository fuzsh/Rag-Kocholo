        "text": "Just when critics thought musical comedies were a thing of the past, Pitch Perfect (2012) came along and blew ticket sales away. In fact, the sleeper hit did so well at the box office (and in fans’ spank banks) it spawned the sequels Pitch Perfect 2 (2015) and Pitch Perfect 3 (2017). What the films lack in title originality, they make up for in ensemble quality. The Glee and Step Up mashup features Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Hana Mae Lee, Alexis Knapp, Ester Dean, Kelley Jakle, Shelley Regner, and Anna Kendrick’s bra-clad rack! As members of an all-girls college a cappella group called the Barden Bellas, each of the busty co-eds boasts a great set of lungs! Loosely based on Mickey Rapkin’s book Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate a Cappella Glory (2008), the film also includes Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins as commentators. Throughout the course of the story, the Barden Bellas face off against their male counterparts (Adam DeVine, Ben Platt, Skylar Astin, and Utkarsh Ambudkar) in a musical competition. Yet even without hearing everyone sing, we pronounce Ms. Camp the winner for losing her top. While portraying the uptight Aubrey Posen, this sexy blonde slips a nip during a cat fight. Meowza! Needless to say, we’d applaud the titillating sight if our hands weren’t engaged elsewhere. In other words, Pitch Perfect will inspire you to pitch a perfect tent in your pants! Perhaps that’s why Mr. Skin is waiting with mastur(bated) breath for Pitch Perfect 4."
