        "text": "Real Talk: you know what’s an endlessly charming and awesome film? “Pitch Perfect.” Coming out of nowhere in the fall of 2012, at least expectations-wise, the college a capella ensemble comedy “Pitch Perfect” turned out to be a huge hit for Universal. And for good reason, because in terms of modern “teen” comedies (yeah, they’re heading into college, but they’re still just hitting adulthood), it’s the best one since “Mean Girls” in 2004. Yep, real talk.\n\nWhat’s even more impressive is that the comedy was the feature-length directorial debut of Jason Moore (he directed episodes of “Dawson’s Creek,” “One Tree Hill” and “Everwood”). But he’s not back for the sequel — instead, the movie will be another feature-length directorial debut: that of “Pitch Perfect” star Elizabeth Banks. She’s back in front of the camera as well, along with most of the cast (writer Kay Cannon has also returned to pen the next chapter). “This is the stupidest idea I’ve ever had,” Banks self-deprecatingly quipped to EW in this week’s cover story. “My first movie is this huge studio movie that a lot of people care about that also happens to be a musical with massive dance numbers. I don’t know what I was thinking.”\n\nStarring Anna Kendrick, Skylar Astin, Rebel Wilson, Adam DeVine, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Alexis Knapp, Ester Dean, Hana Mae Lee, John Michael Higgins, and Elizabeth Banks, newcomers to the cast include Hailee Steinfeld and Katey Sagal. How big of a success was the original? Well, according Universal’s co-president of production, the movie \"performed on DVD like a movie that did at least twice what its theatrical business was.\" \"Pitch Perfect\" grossed $65 million domestically in theaters, so you do the math."
