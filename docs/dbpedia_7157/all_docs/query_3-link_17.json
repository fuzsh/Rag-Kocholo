        "text": "The Hollywood Reporter announced yesterday afternoon that the long hunt for a Pitch Perfect 3 director has ended. As you may recall, Elizabeth Banks, who is a core producer on the Pitch Perfect franchise and who directed Pitch Perfect 2, dropped out of the third film several months back. Since Jason Moore, who directed the first Pitch Perfect back in 2012, was unavailable, Universal/ Comcast Corp., Gold Circle Entertainment, Max Handelman, and Elizabeth Banks of Brownstone Productions had to find a new filmmaker for the threequel.\n\nWe now know who that person will be, and it’s a real step up for the franchise. Yes, that’s a lazy joke.\n\nThe director of Pitch Perfect 3 (or whatever they end up calling it), which is due out December 22, 2017, is none other than Trish Sie. This will be the Grammy award-winning choreographer's second film as a director, with the first being the sadly underseen Step Up: All In. That 2014 sequel, the fifth (and probably final) installment in the dance competition franchise, was a kind of Fast Five/Days of Future Past-type “franchise all-stars to the rescue” finale, with several stars of several prior Step Up adventures joining forces to win the day. Whether they knew or not, the August 2014 release was a dynamite series finale.\n\nThe film only made $86 million worldwide (on a $45m budget) compared to the $140-$159m totals for the prior three sequels. The first three films were distributed by Walt Disney while the last two came courtesy of Lions Gate Entertainment after they bought Summit Entertainment (one of the producers) in 2012. A YouTube television series deal pretty much means that there will be no Step Up: Resurrection. Yet, Step Up 5 shares a stage with Final Destination 5, another inexplicably great fourth sequel that nonetheless underperformed and marked the end of the franchise. I came to the series pretty late, like maybe a year before the last film, but each has its own pleasures. And as a fan of would-be “B movie franchises” on principle (not everything needs to cost $150m) I wish the series had continued in cinematic form.\n\nWhether Step Up All In is the best film in the franchise or merely the second best behind Jon Chu’s dazzlingly awesome Step Up 3-D (Those people are trying to kill Moose with dance moves!), Trish Sie more-than-earned another crack at a theatrical feature. I wouldn’t presume that Sie’s hiring means that we’ll get a plot where Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Hailee Steinfeld, and the rest of the potentially returning Bellas realize they need to improve their dance skills (basically the second season of Glee), but I would have no objection to such things.\n\nAnd this means that we better darn well find a spot for Alyson Stoner on the squad. And, since I haven’t given this speech in awhile, I should reiterate that it is important/valuable/etc. that female filmmakers get the same kind of “next step” opportunities that male filmmakers get as a matter of course. It matters that this female-fronted/female-targeted sequel got a female director. This stuff matters, and I’ll keep boring you with this rant until it’s no longer news anymore. That they hired Ms. Sie is good news on top of good news.\n\nOkay, that’s the gist of the news, but the hiring of a Step Up director for a Pitch Perfect movie is the very definition of good news. For the record, the first Pitch Perfect made $115 million on a $17m budget in 2012 while Pitch Perfect 2 made $287.5m on a $29m budget last year. Pitch Perfect 3 opens December 22, 2017. Which means you’ve got well over a year to get your head in the game. Oh wait, wrong musical/dance franchise, but you get the idea."
