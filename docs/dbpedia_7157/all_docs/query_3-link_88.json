        "text": "At one point in “Pitch Perfect 2,” for no especially compelling narrative reason, the Barden Bellas, an all-girl a cappella group at a fictional Georgia college, find their way to an underground sing-off hosted by a pajama-clad harmony geek played by David Cross. The other contestants include the Treblemakers, the Bellas’ male counterparts; a highly disciplined German vocal ensemble and some Green Bay Packers. It’s a single-elimination contest with strict rules, and the first category is Songs About Butts.\n\nIf the 100-odd minutes of “Pitch Perfect 2,” briskly directed by Elizabeth Banks from a jam-packed script by Kay Cannon, consisted only of that scene, I wouldn’t be disappointed. And if this is what musical comedy looks like on film today, that’s O.K., too: the music is catchy and the jokes connect, even when they’re easy. You can tell this is a sequel by the occasionally frantic mood and a sense of scale that feels a little off sometimes. “Pitch Perfect” was a charming campus comedy with humor that was naughty and sweet and had a sharp sense of the pop-culture moment. Its success has allowed (or perhaps forced) this installment to be bigger, louder and wilder, with new, sometimes redundant characters, celebrity cameos — Snoop Dogg! Jake Tapper! The Green Bay Packers! — and artificially elevated dramatic stakes. Some of the underdog appeal is gone, but a victory lap can be its own kind of fun, and more is not necessarily something to complain about, especially when what there is more of is Fat Amy.\n\nAfter an onstage wardrobe malfunction makes the Bellas pariahs in the a cappella world — the mishap, in front of an audience including President and Mrs. Obama, becomes an international news story — they set out to sing their way back to the top. They must overcome the skepticism of powerful podcasters (John Michael Higgins and Ms. Banks, playing a variation on her “Hunger Games” smiley-underminer role), dissension in their own ranks and of course those Germans, whose leader is an icily charismatic Valkyrie (Birgitte Hjort Sorensen)."
