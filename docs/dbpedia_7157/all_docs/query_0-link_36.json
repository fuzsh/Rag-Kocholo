        "text": "Hey all,\n\nI’M BACK!! Sorry for the very long, and unexpected hiatus, but I have come back and I am ready to do pump some reviews, fun little articles, and anything pop culture.\n\nWhat better way than to give my predictions for the Academy Awards that will honor the best films of 2015. 2015 was a pretty good year for film, and I really like the fact that there is no clear winner in many categories this season. It could go either way on Sunday night. With no further ado, here are the Ginger’s predictions for 88th Academy Awards.\n\n(Side Note: Due to knowing very little information, the following categories of Best Documentary Short Subject, Best Live Action Short Film, and Best Animated Short Film will not be covered in this prediction. Also, like last year, I will be making symbols to say who will, should, and could be the recipients of these awards. The text in bold indicated who I think will win, the nominee with an asterisks (*) indicates who I think should win, and the nominee with a plus sing (+) indicates who I think could win, based on other award trends or complete surprise. )\n\nTHE TECHINICAL CATEGORIES\n\nBEST SOUND EDITING\n\nMad Max: Fury Road *\n\nThe Martian\n\nThe Revenant +\n\nSicario\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens *\n\nBEST SOUND MIXING\n\nBridge of Spies\n\nMad Max: Fury Road +\n\nThe Martian\n\nThe Revenant\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens *\n\nThese categories are ones that I confuse one from the other, so I am going to do them together, which also saves time. When it comes to the Sound Editing category I feel like this is one for Mad Max: Fury Road to lose, however I would not be upset if Star Wars: The Force Awakens would receive the award, as I feel are both deserving. Do not count out The Revenant though. The sound editing was very good in that film, and it could be one of the many awards I am sure it will receive that night. In terms of Sound Mixing, I really feel Star Wars: The Force Awakens did a wonderful job with its mixing and design. There were sounds that I was surprised to be hearing certain scenes that made my viewing the film even more enjoyable. Although, Mad Max: Fury Road could still win the award. Again, these categories are a tough call.\n\nBEST VISUAL EFFECTS\n\nEx Machina *\n\nMad Max: Fury Road\n\nThe Martian\n\nThe Revenant +\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens *\n\nThis category is definitely something that is Star Wars’ to lose. The visual effects in Star Wars: The Force Awakens were so cool. One of the effects in the film that I enjoyed was the character of Maz Kanata. She was just executed beautifully in this film. Though, I would not count out Ex Machina and The Revenant. Like Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I feel Ex Machina should receive this award. The look of Alicia Vikander in the film is so interesting, and I loved how “non-computery” (yes, I made up a word) her character looked in this film. The Revenant could win the award for one reason, the bear attack. That’s all I need to say.\n\nBEST FILM EDITING\n\nThe Big Short\n\nMad Max: Fury Road +\n\nThe Revenant *\n\nSpotlight\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens\n\nWhen it comes to the Best Film Editing of 2015, the only film that came to my mind is The Revenant. There were scenes that were crafted and cut beautifully, especially the ones that had seemed like one long shot throughout the scene. Plus, this would be a way to honor Stephen Mirrione, who was the film editor for this film and last year’s Best Picture winner Birdman (and he should have been nominated last year because the film editing in Birdman was incredible). Although, Mad Max: Fury Road could still win the award because there were sequences that were cut and edited quite brilliantly in that film.\n\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY\n\nCarol\n\nThe Hateful Eight\n\nMad Max: Fury Road\n\nThe Revenant *\n\nSicario +\n\nJust like Film Editing, I feel this is a definite win for The Revenant. There are so many scenes that are shot beautifully in this film, and the imagery in this film just makes your jaw drop and sometimes see beauty in this pretty gruesome film. Also, the use of natural light really was something I loved in this movie, especially one scene at night with men using torches for light. The night scenes literally are authentic and not shot in the day then “blue toned”. However, Sicario’s cinematography was really cool, especially the scene that is entirely in night vision, and it could win the award on Sunday night.\n\nTHE DESIGN CATEGORIES\n\nBEST MAKE UP AND HAIRSTYLING\n\nThe 100-Year Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared\n\nMad Max: Fury Road *+\n\nThe Revenant\n\nThis category is a definite win for Mad Max: Fury Road. The design of the make-up is executed very well on film. There are some actors that do not look recognizable in this film (i.e. Nicholas Hoult and Charlize Theron), and it really does a great job of painting this dystopian world that Max and Furiosa live in.\n\nBEST COSTUME DESIGN\n\nCarol\n\nCinderella *\n\nThe Danish Girl *+\n\nMad Max: Fury Road\n\nThe Revenant\n\nI was very pleased to see Cinderella get the nomination for Costume Design because I felt that Sandy Powell’s designs were beautiful and really one the stars of the film. The iconic dress that Ella wears to the ball was STUNNING, as well as Helena Bonham Carter’s and Cate Blanchett’s. Those three designs alone should give the film the award because those dresses are beautiful. However, I also loved the costume designs in The Danish Girl. Eddie Redmayne’s costumes were so elegant and well tailored to his body, that I felt they really did a great job with helping him act as Lili Elbe. Also, Alicia Vikander’s costumes were just as exquisite. So, I feel it’s between Cinderella and The Danish Girl, and although I want Cinderella to win, I would not be upset if the latter receive this award.\n\nBEST PRODUCTION DESIGN\n\nBridge of Spies +\n\nThe Danish Girl *\n\nMad Max: Fury Road\n\nThe Martian\n\nThe Revenant\n\nI feel like this is one of the definite awards that The Danish Girl will receive tomorrow night. The design of the set pieces in the film are beautiful, elegant, and at some points simplistic. However, Bridge of Spies sets were quite classic and really did a create job at painting a time period in history that was not so long ago.\n\nTHE FEATURE FILM CATEGORIES\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE FILM\n\nAmy *\n\nCartel Land\n\nThe Look of Silence\n\nWhat Happened, Miss Simone? +\n\nWinter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom\n\nThere is no question that the recipient of the Best Documentary Feature award will by Amy on Sunday night. This documentary was not only well crafted, but it really gives us light into the tragic life of this amazing musician and vocalist that was gone too soon. Although, What Happened, Miss Simone? is another great music documentary film that could win this award. But, I still feel Amy will be the recipient.\n\nBEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM\n\nEmbrace of the Serpent (Country: Colombia; Language: Spanish)\n\nMustang (Country: France; Language: Turkish)\n\nSon of Saul (Country: Hungary; Language: Hungarian) *+\n\nTheeb (Country: Jordan; Language: Arabic)\n\nA War (Country: Denmark; Language: Danish)\n\nSon of Saul has been getting a great deal of press for some time, and although I have not seen all of the films in this category, I genuinely feel this will be the recipient for Best Foreign Language Film. This is based on the reviews I’ve read, some clippings I’ve seen, and the fact it won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nBEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILM\n\nAnomalisa\n\nBoy & The World\n\nInside Out *+\n\nShaun the Sheep Movie\n\nWhen Marnie Was There\n\nThere is no question that Inside Out will win the Best Animated Feature Film category. Disney/Pixar did not only make a great comeback with this film, but they really released a film that touched so many people. The concept was wonderful and well crafted, and there are very few animated films that talk about feelings and the emotions we process. I really feel it was a novel way to present this as a family film, and it really is just a solid, great film.\n\nTHE MUSIC AND WRITING CATEGORIES\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SONG\n\nFifty Shades of Grey – “Earned It”\n\nThe Hunting Ground – “Till It Happens to You” *\n\nRacing Extinction – “Manta Ray”\n\nSpectre – “Writing’s on the Wall” *+\n\nYouth – “Simple Song #3”\n\nThis award was tough to pick a recipient. All the songs are great, but there are two that really stand out. Overall, because of the message and the fact that it is a killer song, I feel “’Till It Happens to You” for The Hunting Ground (written by Lady Gaga and Diane Warren) will, and should, receive the award. Although, I also love the song “Writing’s on the Wall” from Spectre (written by Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes) and feel it should, and could, win the award. Either one of them, I would be happy with in the end.\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCORE\n\nBridge of Spies – Thomas Newman\n\nCarol – Carter Burwell\n\nThe Hateful Eight – Ennio Morricone *\n\nSicario – Johann Johannsson\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens – John Williams +\n\nI really enjoyed the score from The Hateful Eight, and I feel it will receive the award for Best Orignal Score. It also really does a great job at painting this spaghetti western/sort of good, bad and ugly world that Quentin Tarrantino in the film. Although I still loved John William’s score in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. There were new themes introduced that were just beautiful, and it could win the award tomorrow night.\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\nBridge of Spies – Matt Charman, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen\n\nEx Machina – Alex Garland +\n\nInside Out – Pete Docter, Meg LeFauve, Josh Cooley and Ronnie del Carmen\n\nSpotlight – Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer *\n\nStraight Outta Compton – Jonathan Herman, Andrea Berloff, S. Leigh Savidge and Alan Wenkus *\n\nThis is a really good group of nominees this year. The two film’s screenplays that really stand out to me were Spotlight and Straight Outta Compton. Overall, I feel Spotlight will win, but both are deserving of this award. Their screenplays were so well written, and there were some scenes that were so powerful that not only could they have been executed brilliantly with amazing actors on screen, but with incredible writing. Also, I would not count out Ex Machina. The story line is very well written, and there are some scenes that really make this science fiction thriller quite exciting.\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY\n\nThe Big Short – Adam McKay and Charles Randolph\n\nBrooklyn – Nick Harnby\n\nCarol – Phyllis Nagy\n\nThe Martian – Drew Goddard *\n\nRoom – Emma Donoghue *+\n\nThis category is a definite win for The Martian. The script, adapted from Andy Weir’s novel, was well adapted, nerdy, witty, and dramatic at times. It really was a well written film, and if it does not win the Academy Award for Best Picture, this will definitely be the award to honor this movie. Although, I also loved how well Room was adapted to the screen by the novel’s same author, Emma Donoghue. There were some scenes that I remember from reading the book, that I was just floored by seeing come to life on screen, especially scenes involving Jack experiencing the world for the first time. Overall, both scripts are deserving and I would not be upset if either one of them one.\n\nTHE ACTING CATEGORIES\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh – The Hateful Eight; Role – Daisy Domergue\n\nRooney Mara – Carol; Role – Therese Belivet\n\nRachel McAdams – Spotlight; Role – Sacha Pfeiffer\n\nAlicia Vikander – The Danish Girl; Role – Gerda Wegener *\n\nKate Winslet – Steve Jobs; Role – Joanna Hoffman +\n\nI honestly feel this is Alicia Vikander’s award to win. Her performance in The Danish Girl was so beautiful, and so heart breaking at times, that she just lit up on the screen as Gerda Wegener. Also, this would be a way to honor her work this year in other films, such as Ex Machina (which she was incredible in) and Burnt. However, I really did like Kate Winslet’s performance as Joanna Hoffman in Steve Jobs. It was a very solid performance, and she won the Golden Globe. However, I still feel it will be Alicia.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nChristian Bale – The Big Short; Role – Michael Burry\n\nTom Hardy – The Revenant; Role – John Fitzgerald +\n\nMark Ruffalo – Spotlight; Role – Michael Rezendes *\n\nMark Rylance – Bridge of Spies; Role – Rudolf Abel\n\nSylvester Stallone – Creed; Role – Rocky Balboa\n\nI strongly feel that Sylvester Stallone will finally win an Oscar for a Rocky film. And from what I’ve heard, because Creed is one the very few films I did not see this awards season, he does give a great performance. However, I also feel that the award should go to Mark Ruffalo for his performance as Michael Rezendes in Spotlight. It was really powerful and moving, and it really shows off Ruffalo’s incredible acting chops. But, I would not count out Tom Hardy as the villainous John Fitzgerald in The Revenant. He truly is a great actor who disappears in his roles, and he gave a really great haunting performance in this film. So overall, I feel Sylvestor Stallone will go home with an Oscar, but I still think it should be Mark Ruffalo, and could be Tom Hardy.\n\nBEST LEADING ACTRESS\n\nCate Blanchett – Carol; Role – Carol Aird\n\nBrie Larson – Room; Role – Joy “Ma” Newsome *\n\nJennifer Lawrence – Joy; Role – Joy Mangano\n\nCharlotte Rampling – 45 Years; Role – Kate Mercer\n\nSaorise Ronan – Brooklyn; Role – Eilis Lacey *+\n\nLike Alicia Vikander in the Supporting Actress category, I strongly feel this is Brie Larson’s definite win in the Best Leading Actress category. Larson’s performance as Joy “Ma” Newsome in Room was powerful, sometimes tragic, but also very strong as a mother thinking about nothing but for her and her son to survive. She took us there, and really gives an incredible performance. Also, her chemistry on screen with Jacob Tremblay is incredible and really makes the film. However, I also feel that Saorise Ronan gave an incredible performance this year as Eilis Lacey in Brooklyn. She could win the award, but I still strongly feel it is Brie Larson who will receive the gold statue tomorrow night.\n\nBEST LEADING ACTOR\n\nBryan Cranston – Trumbo; Role – DaltonT rumbo\n\nMatt Damon – The Martian; Role – Mark Watney +\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio – The Revenant; Role – Hugh Glass *\n\nMichael Fassbender – Steve Jobs; Role – Steve Jobs\n\nEddie Redmayne – The Danish Girl; Role – Lili Elbe/Einar Wegener\n\nFINALLY, IT IS LEO’S YEAR!!! Leonardo DiCaprio is finally going to win an Academy Award for his performance as Hugh Glass in The Revenant. He literally is put through the ringer in the film, and although he says very little dialogue in this film, he says so much with his face and motions in this film. He literally gives a tour de force performance and deserves an Oscar. However, I would not cut out Matt Damon. Matt Damon gave a enjoyable performance as Mark Watney in The Martian. But overall, still Leo’s night.\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nAdam McKay – The Big Short\n\nGeorge Miller – Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nAlejandro G. Iñárritu – The Revenant\n\nLenny Abrahamson – Room +\n\nTom McCarthy – Spotlight *\n\nI feel like this is going to be a back to back win for Alejandro G. Iñárritu. What he did with The Revenant was very interesting, and I feel he did a great job at being the captain of this ship and creating this incredible film about revenge and survival. However, I also feel the award should go to Tom McCarthy. He did an exquisite job with this very powerful film about a very historical time in journalism. But Lenny Abrahamson could win the award for Room. Not only did he have the incredible challenge of directing this heavy film, but to also direct actors in a small space and a child. Overall three directors are deserving, and I feel it will go to Iñárritu even though it should go to McCarthy, and do not count out Abrahamson.\n\nBEST PICTURE\n\nThe Big Short\n\nBridge of Spies\n\nBrooklyn\n\nMad Max: Fury Road\n\nThe Martian\n\nThe Revenant *+\n\nRoom\n\nSpotlight *\n\nIf you asked me when the nominations first came out, I would have said The Revenant would win Best Picture. I still feel The Revenant should win Best Picture because it is a great well-crafted film. However, I strongly feel that Spotlight should win and it will win for Best Picture. It tells a powerful story, has a great director and screenplay, and a cast that gives a stellar performance. The picture as a whole is incredible. So to clarify my answer, I feel Spotlight will, and should, be selected for Best Picture, however I also think The Revenant should, and could, win the award for Best Picture.\n\nWell there are my predictions for the 88th Academy Awards for the films of 2015. I hope you enjoy watching the awards ceremony on ABC tomorrow night starting at 8 pm, as I will. I also look forward to some more blog posts to come. If you feel inclined to watch any films nominated before tomorrow night, you can stream them on Amazon and iTunes, and rent most of them through Redbox.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nYour Favorite Ginger\n\nHello all!!! I’m back!!\n\nSo, sorry about the 3 month hiatus, but things got a little hectic. But, I’m back and now a more perfect time than ever! It’s the the post summer film season, which means it’s Oscar season, which besides Christmas and the Tony’s is the most wonderful time of the year.\n\nBut, I’m not knocking down this past summer’s film season because there were some great films this year, some better than last summer. I really enjoyed them! So to commemorate a very well done summer film season, I am giving the Ginger’s top picks from the summer 2015 film season. I’ve narrowed it down to 9 films out of the the many that I saw! I do apologize in advance for the lovers of Ant-Man and Trainwreck because I was not able to make it to the theater to see them. And I do apologize for the one fan of The Fantastic Four reboot….I didn’t bother with that P.O.S. Sorry I’m not sorry!\n\nFAIR WARNING: In case anyone is wondering why I give all the information at every film in the countdown, it’s because I am giving you the option to say yes and no to this film. If there is a star you don’t really like in it, then don’t watch it. If you were feeling half and half about a film, and see the time length and feel you’re not going to get that time back….then don’t watch it!\n\nSo here we go!!!\n\n9. Ricki and the Flash\n\nRelease Date: August 14, 2015\n\nRating: PG-13 for thematic material, brief drug content, sexuality and language.\n\nRunning Time: 1 hr. 41 mins.\n\nDirector: Jonathan Demme\n\nScreenwriter: Diablo Cody\n\nCast: Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Mamie Gummer, Audra McDonald, Sebastian Stan, Nick Westrate, Rick Springfield, Ben Platt\n\nOkay, put away your judging face. This film was one of those gems that I really enjoyed this year. Yes the script was predictable, but the film had it’s moments. There was a great performance given by Meryl Streep, who could win an Oscar reciting her ABCs in a potato sack. Kevin Kline was fantastic and it was so nice to see them together in a film that was a comedy, and not a hard drama like Sophie’s Choice. Audra McDonald took a pretty small, supporting role, gave it the Audra McDonald touch, and made it a force of nature. Finally, Mamie Gummer, who was a scene stealer in this film, taught us all that she was an apple that did not fall far from the tree with her amazing talent. Also, this film did it’s job and made us forget our troubles for over 90 minutes, and make it an enjoyable night in the theatre. This is a film that is very much worth a view.\n\n8. Magic Mike XXL\n\nRelease Date: July 1, 2015\n\nRating: R for strong sexual content, pervasive language, some nudity (DUH) and some drug use\n\nRunning Time: 1 hr. 55 mins.\n\nDirector: Gregory Jacobs\n\nScreenwriter: Reid Carolin\n\nCast: Channing Tatum, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, Kevin Nash, Adam Rodriguez, Gabriel Iglesias, Amber Heard, Donald Glover, Andie MacDowell, Elizabeth Banks, Jada Pinkett Smith\n\nOkay, I think every lady and gay man will agree with me when I say this…I really disliked Magic Mike. I felt the first film was too much Mike and not enough magic. However, Magic Mike XXL was the total opposite. It was so funny, energetic and kept me interested in so many of these characters. I really feel this is how the first film should have been all along. And the real reason to see this film, besides the iconic scene with Joe Mangnaiello in a gas station, is for the last 15-20 minutes. I don’t want to say anymore about that without giving too much of that away. But, just to advise people who did not like the first film, watch the second film. It’s funnier, sexier, and has a great cast that pleases all sexes.\n\n7. Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nRelease Date: May 15, 2015\n\nRating: R for intense sequences of violence and disturbing images\n\nRunning Time: 2 hours\n\nDirector: George Miller\n\nScreenwriter: George Miller, Brendan McCarthy, Nico Lathouris\n\nCast: Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rosie Huntington-Whitely, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton\n\nHere’s the thing about Mad Max, I’m not a big fan of the series in general. However, this film was very good. It was not the best film for the summer for me, but it was definitely one of the most entertaining films for me. Charlize Theron was a BAMF, as always, and Tom Hardy was a very likable Max. Nicholas Hoult was crazy, and Hugh Keays-Byrne…..yeah he was weird. Overall, despite my personal feelings about the film series and about this film personally, it was an action packed film that kept me entertained, and it did live up to the hype a bit. Plus, there was this awesome guitar guy for the villain’s theme music. For all you folks that like lots of action, explosions and stunts, this is the film for you.\n\n6. Spy\n\nRelease Date: June 5, 2015\n\nRating: R for language, violence and some sexual content\n\nRunning Time: 2 hours (Unrated Extended Edition – 2 hrs. 10 mins.)\n\nDirector and Screenwriter: Paul Feig\n\nCast: Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham, Rose Byrne, Miranda Hart, Bobby Cannavale, Allison Janney, Jude Law\n\nI came into this film with very, very low expectations, and came out loving this quite hysterical film. At first I did not want to watch this film because I find Melissa McCarthy to be sometimes obnoxious, however her role in this movie was the complete opposite. She was literally a caterpillar that turned into a comedic butterfly. Her one liners were gut busters and her comedic timing was perfect in this film. Not to mention her scene partner, Rose Byrne, held her own, and it was nice to see them together in a film since Bridesmaids. Another great scene stealer in this film was Miranda Hart. She was that best girl friend you want to have all the time, and nailed the awkward humor. Finally, Jude Law, Bobby Cannavale, and Jason Stratham were wonderful in their roles. For all those Johnny English and James Bond fans, this is definitely a film for you.\n\n5. Avengers: Age of Ultron\n\nRelease Date: May 1, 2015\n\nRating: PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action, violence and destruction, and some suggestive comments\n\nRunning Time: 2 hrs. 21 mins.\n\nDirector and Screenwriter: Joss Whedon\n\nCast: Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Cobie Smulders, Anthony Mackie, Hayley Atwell, Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgard, James Spader, Samuel L. Jackson\n\nThis was definitely one of the films I was very excited about for this summer.To say this film was epic would be an understatement. It met my expectations, and maybe a little bit more. Not only was Joss Whedon’s script smart, but he did a wonderful job at meeting the bar that the first film set, and maybe a little farther. Also, this film had so much eye candy, you can’t even stand it. Finally, if you’re a huge marvel fan like I am, you will not be disappointed in this film, and really like what they have done with the Ultron character, as well as the Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson introduced in this film.\n\n4. Straight Outta Compton\n\nRelease Date: August 14, 2015\n\nRating: R for language, strong sexuality/nudity, violence and drug use\n\nRunning Time: 2 hrs. 27 mins.\n\nDirector: F. Gary Gray\n\nScreenwriter: Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff\n\nCast: O’Shea Jackson, Jr., Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Paul Giamatti, Aldis Hodge, Neil Brown, Jr.\n\nI am going out on a limb here and say that this was the biggest surprise of the summer. The actor’s performances were incredible, the script was very well written, and is definitely with the likes of Ray and Walk the Line in terms of music biopic films. It also, like our film selected for the number one slot, gave you this nostalgia of the 90s. I’m not gonna lie, I got excited when “Fuck da Police” started playing in the film, and when I heard the phrase “Bye Felicia”. Finally, I would just like to point out how scary, crazy, on point each actor’s resemblance were to their real life counterparts in N.W.A. (Spoiler alert: one of them is actually Ice Cube’s son). This is one of those films you should not pass up, and when it becomes available to rent or view, do not hesitate because it is a solid, excellent film.\n\n3. Pitch Perfect 2\n\nRelease Date: May 15, 2015\n\nRating: PG-13 for innuendo and language\n\nRunning Time: 1 hr. 55 mins.\n\nDirector: Elizabeth Banks\n\nScreenwriter: Kay Cannon\n\nCast: Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Hailee Steinfeld, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, Adam DeVine, Ben Platt, Anna Camp, Elizabeth Banks, John Michael Higgins, Ester Dean, Hana Mae Lee, Alexis Knapp, Chrissie Fit, Kelley Jakle, Shelley Regner, Katey Sagal, Birgitte Hjort Sørensen, Flula Borg, David Cross, Keegan-Michael Key\n\nJust like Avengers: Age of Ultron, I was very excited about Pitch Perfect 2. This film was not only great but it surpassed the bar met by the first film, which is very hard. The music used in the film was fun, the arrangements were genius (especially The Riff-Off in this film), and the comedy in this film was on point. I loved that there were some new characters introduced that really held their own, and that Rebel and Anna were just as hysterical as always. Finally, Elizabeth Bank’s direction in this film was very well done, and she did a spectacular job (HEY LADIES!!!). If you have not seen this film yet, get out of the rock you are living under, and watch this hilarious movie.\n\n2. Inside Out\n\nRelease Date: June 19, 2015\n\nRating: PG for mild thematic elements and some action\n\nRunning Time: 1 hr. 34 mins.\n\nDirector: Pete Docter\n\nScreenwriter: Pete Docter, Meg LeFauve, Josh Cooley\n\nCast: Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Richard Kind, Kaitlyn Dias, Diane Lane, Kyle MacLachlan\n\nTo say that I felt all the feels in this film would be an understatement. This film was not only fun to watch, and visually beautiful, but the film was emotionally beautiful. You felt anger, sadness, joy, disgust and fear, all at different moments in this movie. Disney/Pixar really out did themselves in this movie, and succeeded going out on a limb with the premise of this film. Plus, everyone one in this film was brilliantly cast in the voicing of the characters, especially Amy Poehler, as Joy, Phyllis Smith, as Sadness, and Mindy Kaling, as Disgust. This not only a great film for the kids, but for the adults and the the inner child in us. Definitely a great film for family movie night.\n\n1. Jurassic World\n\nRelease Date: June 10, 2015\n\nRating: PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and peril\n\nRunning Time: 2 hrs. 4 mins.\n\nDirector: Colin Trevorrow\n\nScreenwriter: Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Derek Connolly, Colin Trevorrow\n\nCast: Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D’Onofrio, Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, Omar Sy, B.D. Wong, Irrfan Khan\n\nI was so excited for this film, and like Straight Outta Compton, it brought back nostalgia to the 90s and the first time I saw Jurassic Park. The film was entertaining, met the formula of every Jurassic film, and had a stellar cast. Chris Pratt was great in this film and, like in Guardians of the Galaxy, showed how truly sexy he can be. Bryce Dallas-Howard was wonderful as always, and impressive when she running in them heels (SHE BETTAH!!). Finally, the dinosaurs were awesome and there were moments in the film that were extremely action packed, jaw dropping, and will make you jump up and down with excitement in your seat. Definitely a great film to add to this wonderful, awesome series.\n\nWell, there you have it, the Ginger’s top films of the summer of 2015. If you have any favorite films this summer, please feel free to state it in the comment section below. I am glad to be back and I am excited to begin reviewing more films, and giving you all these great options for you to watch on any kind of day, or for any kind of occasion.\n\nSee you all the next time, folks!\n\nYours truly,\n\nYour Favorite Ginger\n\n“Good morning, good morning, it’s great to stay up late! Good morning, good morning to you!”\n\nHey all!\n\nSo you’re probably wondering where I’ve been…all 33 of you. Well, here’s what’s been happening. I GRADUATED! I now have my Master’s of Music in Vocal Performance. I’m master James now! So, that’s the main reason why I really haven’t posted anything in the past two months. I was in the the seventh inning stretch, plus there wasn’t anything to review in April, or I didn’t think of something creatively. HOWEVER! Now May has ended, June is bustin’ out all over (Sorry I’m not sorry for these musical theatre references), and I have some items to blog about.\n\nIt’s perfect that I come back from my unexpected hiatus with my favorite time of year, next to the holidays and Oscar season. IT’S THE TONY AWARDS! For those of you do not know much about these awards, or what the night is about in general, Tony Award night is a time where we recognize excellence in theatre with plays and musicals (both original and revival) that have opened from June-May of the following year (which is how long a season lasts on the Broadway calendar). I did a prediction of last year’s Tony Awards for the 2013-2014 theatre season, and that was my first prediction column on this blog.\n\nI love the Tony Awards because not only does it recognize talent outside of the Grammys and the Academy Awards, but it really opens so many people across America to Broadway. It showcases also the plays that opened during the season, there are musical performances from nominated and not nominated musicals…it’s literally a huge show. I can say now that it’s been a while, but my first Tony Awards broadcast I ever watched was in 2003. I was finishing 6th grade, and it was the year Hairspray won Best Musical, Bernadette Peters was nominated for Gypsy and gave a stellar performance of “Rose’s Turn”, and Movin’ Out was the hottest jukebox musical on Broadway next to Mamma Mia!. It was the first time I ever heard of Broadway, what they were, what musicals besides the ones by Disney were opening or running, and seeing people that have made careers and been recognized for their work. Since then, that little 6th grader was inspired to do so many musicals, plays and eventually operas. So, basically we can thank my love of performing to the Tony Awards.\n\nSo, with no further ado, and quickly since I spent way too much time on these opening paragraphs, here are the Ginger’s predictions for the 69th Annual Tony Awards. (Sidenote: For the first time ever, I am doing both plays and musicals because I finally took time to look into some of the plays that opened this year, and for once did not care about the musicals.) Like the previous predictions here are what each symbol means: if the nominee is in bold text that stands for my pick/what I think will win, if the nominee has an astrix next to it (*) that stands for what I think should win, and if the nominee has a plus sign next to it (+) that stands for what I think could win.\n\nTECHNICAL,CHOREOGRAPHY AND DIRECTING CATEGORIES\n\nBEST LIGHTING DESIGN OF A PLAY\n\nAirline Highway\n\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time*\n\nSkylight\n\nWolf Hall: Parts One & Two +\n\nLike most of the play categories of the evening, this is a definite deadlock for The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. From everything I’ve seen, the lighting looks beautiful and the lighting really pops out. It also does this beautiful job of bringing us into Christopher’s world, and has an amazing blend of projections with bright lights on that stage. Although, Wolf Hall‘s lighting is very dramatic and just as amazing as Curious Incident, and we probably shouldn’t count that show out.\n\nBEST LIGHTING DESIGN OF A MUSICAL\n\nAn American in Paris\n\nFun Home*\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein’s The King and I +\n\nThe Visit\n\nI really feel like that technically this is one of the awards Fun Home will win tomorrow evening. The fact that they lit this music so brilliantly in the round after being in a proscenium setting, is something that I commend the creative team. I really feel that this show deserves this award. However, another show that we should count out is the revival of The King and I. That production’s lighting is one of the many reasons why it is so exquisite and breathtaking, so we should not count the show out of that category.\n\nBEST COSTUME DESIGN OF A PLAY\n\nAirline Highway\n\nThe Audience +\n\nWolf Hall: Parts One & Two*\n\nYou Can’t Take It With You\n\nI feel like there is no competition with this award. Wolf Hall’s costumes are beautifully designed, constructed and executed. Plus, who does not love a design of the Tudor period? However, we should not count out the costume design for The Audience. Helen Mirren’s costumes from the iconic tweed skirt suit to the coronation dress are beautiful.\n\nBEST COSTUME DESIGN OF A MUSICAL\n\nAn American in Paris\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein’s The King and I*\n\nOn the Twentieth Century\n\nSomething Rotten! +\n\nI strongly believe that this award is a dead lock for The King and I. I mean look at the dress on Kelli O’Hara. It’s seriously the most gorgeous ball gowns I’ve seen on Broadway, and the interview with Catherine Zuber still boggles my mind when she talks about the period undergarments Kelli is wearing in order to move in that dress. Also the pallets for the King, his wives and the children are exquisite, and the design of their costumes are just gorgeous and look beautiful on every single actor. I strongly believe Catherine Zuber is one of those designers who can really construct a costume just as brilliantly as William Ivey-Long. However, with my luck, it could go in the opposite direction and go to Something Rotten!, which have some incredible Elizabethan pieces on that stage.\n\nBEST SCENIC DESIGN OF A PLAY\n\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time*\n\nSkylight\n\nWolf Hall: Parts One & Two\n\nYou Can’t Take It With You +\n\nThis set design is ingenious. It not only sets the world of Christopher very well, but has this amazing concept of being a huge playground for the actors, and a beautiful way of fluidly making stairs, and using compartments for props. How it is constructed still boggles me to this day. However, I do feel the revival of You Can’t Take It With You could also win because it truly is a beautiful, well constructed and detailed Broadway set.\n\nBEST SCENIC DESIGN OF A MUSICAL\n\nAn American in Paris\n\nFun Home*\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein’s The King and I\n\nOn the Twentieth Century +\n\nLike costume design, I feel this might be a lock for The King and I. I do not know what it is about Lincoln Center, but when they put on a production, not only is is simplistic, but has epic tones that are jaw dropping. However, I firmly believe Fun Home is equally as deserving because they completely changed their entire look and concept for their set, and it was beautifully executed in my opinion. I would not be upset if this show won the category. However, we should not count out On the Twentieth Century. The fact that they are putting a train on that small stage is incredible and still boggles my mind.\n\nBEST CHOREOGRAPHY\n\nJoshua Bergasse – On the Town +\n\nChristopher Gattelli – Rodgers and Hammerstein’s The King and I\n\nScott Graham and Steven Hoggett for Frantic Assembly – The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\n\nCasey Nicholaw – Something Rotten!\n\nChristopher Wheeldon – An American in Paris*\n\nI honestly feel that if Christopher Wheeldon does not win the directing category, he needs to receive a Tony for his choreography in An American in Paris. He not only makes ballet look sexy and elegant, but he really tells a beautiful story through his choreography while also tipping his hat to the beautiful choreography from the source material. However, do not count out Joshua Bergasse’s choreography in On the Town. It is so brilliant, flashy and screams musical theatre it is not even funny. It is one of the many things that compliments that great production.\n\nBEST DIRECTOR OF A PLAY\n\nStephen Daldry – Skylight\n\nMarianne Elliott – The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time*\n\nScott Ellis – You Can’t Take It With You +\n\nJeremy Herrin – Wolf Hall: Parts One & Two\n\nMoritz von Stuelpnagel – Hand to God\n\nMarianne Elliott’s direction of this play is amazing. Not only is the staging smart and eye candy for the audience, but it is also has scenes that beautifully done by Elliott. However, I would not be upset if Scott Ellis won for You Can’t Take It With You. He is an incredible director whose work is amazing, and from what I heard, he directed this star studded ensemble cast beautifully. I feel that is amazing someone to be able to do that to tell you the truth due to the many components.\n\nBEST DIRECTOR OF A MUSICAL\n\nSam Gold – Fun Home*\n\nCasey Nicholaw – Something Rotten!\n\nJohn Rando – On the Town\n\nBartlett Sher – Rodgers and Hammerstein’s The King and I +\n\nChristopher Wheeldon – An American in Paris\n\nTo say that Sam Gold had his work cut out for him would be an understatement. Not only did he have the daunting task of directing a musical that was based on an unlikely source for a musical, but he staged and directed many moments beautifully in this show. To say that he was the fearless captain on this ship would be an understatement. He is completely deserving of this award. However, let’s not count out Bartlett Sher. This is his second time directing a Rodgers and Hammerstein revival, and I think it is just as great as his Tony award winning production of South Pacific. He literally found a way to make the show vibrant, feel relevant to 2015 and find the beauty/romance in the piece. I would not be upset if he won again because his direction of this production is ravishing.\n\nMUSIC AND WRITING CATEGORIES\n\nBEST ORCHESTRATIONS\n\nAn American in Paris\n\nFun Home*\n\nThe Last Ship+\n\nSomething Rotten!\n\nI honestly feel that it is a toss up between the two big contenders for Best Musical in this category. On the one thing this would be the only music category An American in Paris would win because it is not eligible for Best Original Score, and it would be deserving because the orchestrations in this production are elegant and pleasant to the ear. They really take these Gershwin songs and make them sound fresh and timeless. However, I feel Fun Home‘s orchestrations are just as deserving and should win because of the small orchestra being so powerful in this beautiful piece. However, do not count out The Last Ship. Although I liked the score and feel it will not win Best Original Score, I did love the orchestrations in this show, and felt they were brilliantly used in this piece. Just give a listen with the clips above and see what you think.\n\nBEST BOOK OF A MUSICAL\n\nCraig Lucas – An American in Paris\n\nLisa Kron – Fun Home*+\n\nKarey Kirkpatrick and John O’Farrell – Something Rotten!\n\nTerrence McNally – The Visit\n\nIf Lisa Kron does not get award for Best Book of a Musical this season…I may boycott the Tonys. LISTEN….the book for Fun Home is literally the best, seriously well crafted book on Broadway this season. I started reading Alison Bechdel’s graphic novel that the musical is based on one day in a Barnes & Noble, and it still amazes me how she was able to adapt this book, which seemed impossible, and make it work for the stage. Don’t get me wrong, I love Craig Lucas and feel he is a wonderful book writer, especially with The Light in the Piazza, and of course who does not love a Terrence McNally book, but I feel this is the year of female writers to come out on top, especially Lisa Kron.\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCORE\n\nFun Home – Music: Jeanine Tesori; Lyrics: Lisa Kron*+\n\nThe Last Ship – Music and Lyrics: Sting\n\nSomething Rotten! – Music and Lyrics: Wayne Kirkpatrick and Karey Kikrpatrick\n\nThe Visit – Music: John Kander; Lyrics: Fred Ebb\n\nI’m going to say it…and I feel like I’m going out on a limb here…Fun Home has literally the best score on Broadway this season, maybe the best in the past 4-5 years. Don’t get me wrong, there are some scores that are brilliant and wonderful, but this one is literally the list of a handful of musicals that had a score that made emotionally compromised. The last musical to do that was Ragtime: The Musical, which is my favorite musicals of all time. I think for once a brand new show might be on my top ten after this season. Just listen to these three songs from the show. They are powerful, moving and just amazing. Also, the other aspect of this award that makes me hopeful is that Jeanine Tesori, who wrote shows such as Violet, Shrek, and Caroline, or Change, will FINALLY win a Tony award because she is one of those composers who is incredible.\n\nACTING CATEGORIES\n\nBEST FEATURED ACTRESS IN A PLAY\n\nAnnaleigh Ashford – You Can’t Take It With You; Role – Essie*\n\nPatricia Clarkson – The Elephant Man; Role – Mrs. Kendal/Pinhead+\n\nLydia Leonard – Wolf Hall: Parts One & Two; Role – Anne Boleyn+\n\nSarah Stiles – Hand to God; Role – Jessica\n\nJulie White – Airline Highway; Role – Tanya\n\nI’m going to say this now while we are on the acting categories, but this year each category is packed with some amazing nominees that are equally as deserving. However, I have to say Annaleigh Ashford is going to win and should win this award. I’ve seen clips of her in this show, and she literally is the epitome of scene stealer. She also carries her own in a very star studded revival, and has been working for a while in some great roles where she shines. I feel it would be a great way to say here’s a thank you for all these great roles you have given us, including Essie. However, do not count out Patricia Clarkson, who from what I have seen, gave a beautiful performance in The Elephant Man. And also do not count out Lydia Leonard in Wolf Hall, who I have read nothing but glowing reviews of her hautning portrayal of Anne Boleyn.\n\nBEST FEATURED ACTOR IN A PLAY\n\nMatthew Beard – Skylight; Role – Edward Sergeant\n\nK. Todd Freeman – Airline Highway; Role – Sissy Na Na\n\nRichard McCabe – The Audience; Role – Harold Wilson\n\nAlessandro Nivola – The Elephant Man; Role – Frederick Treves *+\n\nNathaniel Parker – Wolf Hall: Parts One & Two; Role – King Henry VIII*\n\nMicah Stock – It’s Only a Play; Role – Gus P. Head\n\nI feel it would kinda awesome for Nathaniel Parker to win for his portrayal of King Henry VIII because he has already won an Olivier Award. However, I feel Alessandro Nivola, who also random fact was in Jurassic Park III, is just as deserving for his role in The Elephant Man. Both are equally deserving of the award for their roles this season, but again I think it would be really cool for Parker to win. Plus, who doesn’t love someone playing one of the most scandalous men in power since President Fitzgerald Grant (EEEYYYOOOO!!!!)\n\nBEST FEATURED ACTRESS IN A MUSICAL\n\nVictoria Clark – Gigi; Role – Mamita\n\nJudy Kuhn – Fun Home; Role – Helen*\n\nSydney Lucas – Fun Home; Role – Small Alison*\n\nRuthie Ann Miles – Rodgers and Hammerstein’s The King and I; Role – Lady Thiang+\n\nEmily Skeggs – Fun Home; Role – Medium Alison\n\nThis category is one of two where I literally do not know who will win this category. I think it’s mainly because there are three women nominated for the same show, and there are three women that are equally deserving for this award. Personally, I want Sydney Lucas to win because she is literally giving the best performance ever performed by a child actress. I feel she is going to be the next Daisy Egan and be the first child actress since 1991 to win a Tony Award. However, I somehow feel that Judy Kuhn might win the award, which would make me excited to be honest. I think it might be because she is the voice of my childhood (BUT REALLY THOUGH…she was the singing voice for Pocahontas y’all) and I’m so excited she has a role that feels like it is written for her. And her voice in this show is angelic. But, again, I would be so happy if either of those actresses received this award because they are giving career defining performances. However, incase the Fun Home actresses cancel each other out, I would not mind seeing Ruthie Ann Miles win for The King and I. Not only does she sing “Something Wonderful” beautifully, but she gives so much more depth to the character that it is refreshing to see the role in a new light. Again, would not be mad to have one of these three women win the award.\n\nBEST FEATURED ACTOR IN A MUSICAL\n\nChristian Borle – Something Rotten!; Role – Shakespeare\n\nAndy Karl – On the Twentieth Century; Role – Bruce Granit*+\n\nBrad Oscar – Something Rotten!; Role – Nostradamus\n\nBrandon Uranowitz – An American in Paris; Role – Adam Hochberg\n\nMax von Essen – An American in Paris; Role – Henri Baurel\n\nSo, I think it is clear that Christian Borle, and his arms (THEY’RE SO NICE!!!) will be the big winner for this category. Plus, I think he should deserve every award that he receives for this role because he is giving a stellar performance. However, I would not be upset is Andy Karl won for On the Twentieth Century because he literally is showing his range within the past two years. He was nominated for Rocky last year, and now goes from drama to comedy, and is giving another great performance (with his arms). Again, I think it will be Christian Borle, but I would not be upset if it was Andy Karl.\n\nBEST LEADING ACTRESS IN A PLAY\n\nGeneva Carr – Hand to God; Role – Margery\n\nHelen Mirren – The Audience; Role – Queen Elizabeth II*\n\nElisabeth Moss – The Heidi Chronicles; Role – Heidi Holland\n\nCarey Mulligan – Skylight; Role – Kyra Hollis+\n\nRuth Wilson – Constellations; Role – Marianne\n\nI think this is going to be a big first this year in this category. If Helen Mirren wins the Tony tomorrow night for her performance in The Audience, she will be the first actress to play a role that has earned her an Academy Award and a Tony Award. She looks exquisite in the show, and really gives such a stunning performance as Queen Elizabeth II. However, do not count out Carey Mulligan because, from what I’ve been reading, she is acting the poop out of her role. But, I still think it’s going to be Helen Mirren’s night.\n\nBEST LEADING ACTOR IN A PLAY\n\nSteven Boyer – Hand to God; Role – Jason/Tyrone\n\nBradley Cooper – The Elephant Man; Role – John Merrick*\n\nBen Miles – Wolf Hall: Parts One & Two; Role – Thomas Cromwell\n\nBill Nighy – Skylight; Role – Tom Sergeant+\n\nAlex Sharp – The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time; Role – Christopher\n\nThis is another packed category this year, and I feel it could co in a lot of ways. I feel the recipient of this award will be Alex Sharp for Curious Incident, and he does deserve it because he is giving a riveting physical performance in the role of Christopher. Plus it boggles my mind that he is a recent graduate from Julliard, gets his Broadway debut, and then now has a Tony nom. To say it is a Cinderella story is an understatement. However, the award could also go to Bradley Cooper, who gave the most talked about performance in The Elephant Man, and as it should go to him because he loves the project, believes in it, brought it to London, and was a class act as a big A-list star coming to Hollywood. It’s because of this I respect him as an actor. Finally, let’s not count out Bill Nighy who is giving another great performance in Skylight, which I feel might make him the big surprise of the evening.\n\nBEST LEADING ACTRESS IN A MUSICAL\n\nKristin Chenoweth – On the Twentieth Century; Role – Lily Garland/Mildred Plotka+\n\nLeanne Cope – An American in Paris; Role – Lise Dassin\n\nBeth Malone – Fun Home; Role – Alison\n\nKelli O’Hara – Rodgers and Hammerstein’s The King and I; Role – Anna Leonowens*\n\nChita Rivera – The Visit; Role – Claire Zacahanassian\n\nOkay all, I’m gonna level with y’all. All five of these women are giving the performance of their careers. Each women are deserving and creating beautiful work on stage. You have Beth Malone as Alison in Fun Home that gives a heart wrenching performance, Leanne Cope giving a beautiful Broadway debut, and Chita Rivera in her last stage role. However, I feel the award is going between Kristin Chenoweth and Kelli O’Hara. Personally, I feel Kelli O’Hara should win the award. She is giving another incredible performance in a Rodgers and Hammerstein show, that really is her bread and butter, and it feels like the role that will finally give her an award that she finally deserves at this point in her career. Plus she has a voice like an angel, and sings the score so beautifully. She is my khaleesi. However, Kristin Chenoweth is giving another amazing performance, and I feel that she could also win the award. She is carrying the show on her shoulders, and literally singing the poop out of the role of Lily Garland. If either one of these women received the award, I would not be upset. Again, I want it to be Kelli O’Hara, however, it would be pleasant if Kristin Chenoweth also won.\n\nBEST LEADING ACTOR IN A MUSICAL\n\nMichael Ceveris – Fun Home; Role – Bruce*\n\nRobert Fairchild – An American in Paris; Role – Jerry Mulligan\n\nBrian d’Arcy James – Something Rotten!; Role – Nick Bottom +\n\nKen Watanabe – Rodgers and Hammerstein’s The King and I; Role – The King of Siam\n\nTony Yazbeck – On the Town; Role – Gabey\n\nI feel the award is between three actors: Michael Ceveris, Robert Fairchild, and Brian d’Arcy James. Personally, I would love to see Michael Ceveris win for his portrayal of Bruce in the show, and he should win. He is the glue that holds the show together by being the father Alison talks about throughout the evening. Plus, he gives a heart breaking performance as a really tortured man. However, I would not count out Brian d’Arcy James. I love him as an actor/vocalist, and feel he could win the award in a musical that he is giving a high energy performance. But, again, I firmly believe that Michael Ceveris will win, and he deserves it for this incredible show.\n\nPRODUCTION CATEGORIES\n\nBEST REVIVAL OF A PLAY\n\nThe Elephant Man*+\n\nSkylight\n\nThis Is Our Youth\n\nYou Can’t Take It With You*\n\nI feel like it’s a toss up again in this category. I feel it is between two shows that opened in the fall, and made a huge impact on the season. I really would love to see You Can’t Take It With You receive this award because it has been a while since the show was revived, and it was a production that was incredibly hysterical. However, do not count out The Elephant Man. It played to sold out audiences all throughout the winter and early spring, and was quite a wonderful production with an even more wonderful cast.\n\nBEST REVIVAL OF A MUSICAL\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein’s The King and I*\n\nOn the Town\n\nOn the Twentieth Century +\n\nAs everyone who knows me knows, I am obsessed with this production of The King and I. It is one of the Rodgers and Hammerstein shows that I have never seen on stage, it stars one of my favorite actresses, and it opened on my birthday. Plus the production is flawless, ravishing and fabulous. It also does this beautiful job of bringing such a classic to the modern world, and fleshing out the drama and romance in the piece. I feel it is a slam dunk for this production. However, do not count out On the Twentieth Century. It has become a huge hit in its limited engagement, and really is a great revival of such a fun musical comedy.\n\nBEST PLAY\n\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time*\n\nDisgraced\n\nHand to God\n\nWolf Hall: Parts One & Two +\n\nAnother slam dunk for Curious Incident. It is literally the best play that has opened this season. All my friends who have seen it have told me it is incredible, an event at the theatre, and very moving. Also, I feel it will be amazing to see a show that opened in the fall and has literally been the hot ticket all season to win the Tony award. It is a brilliant adaptation of the novel, and does a beautiful job of showing individuals with Asperger’s or autism on stage. However, from what I’ve heard, Wolf Hall is another faithful adaptation to the novel, and is quite thrilling to watch on stage. But, again, I think it will be Curious Incident taking the award home.\n\nBEST MUSICAL\n\nAn American in Paris\n\nFun Home*+\n\nSomething Rotten!\n\nThe Visit\n\nAlthough this has been a great year with musicals. This year nominated for Best Musical we have only one musical this year based on a film, one completely original musical, one based on a graphic novel, and another based on a play. Ultimately, I strongly believe that Fun Home will take the prize. It is nothing like what is on Broadway right now. It is a beautiful piece about finding yourself, how to cope with loss, and empowerment of yourself. The score is spectacular, the acting is superb and the production value is simple, but amazing. I know some are think An American in Paris will win based on the fact it is something that everyone relates to, and is able to tour around the country as a selling point.\n\n(WARNING: Soapbox Moment) I’m sorry, but y’all need to understand something. The Tony voters have picked art over what sells on tour better over the years. Last year’s A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder was more of an art form than a sell for touring, which if we were going off of that Beautiful: The Carole King Musical or Aladdin. Billy Elliot: The Musical was a piece of art. Once was a work of art. The Book of Mormon, in some circles, is a hard sell with the creators of South Park being the creators. Int he past 5 years, I’ve only seen 2 musicals win for Best Musical that would be considered a great touring show to sell to touring companies. Also, what is not relatable about finding yourself. Even though Fun Home is about a lesbian coming into her own, anyone can relate to it. Gays, straights, bis, thais, dinosaurs, frogs…anyone can relate to it. I honestly feel the Tony voters will choose a show that is very moving, well crafted, and truly a work of art over what sells better on the road.\n\nSo, again, I’m Fun Home all the way.\n\nWell, those are my predictions for the Tony awards. If you all feel like watching a great night of seeing theatre being honored on television, tune in on CBS tomorrow night at 8 pm/7pm central.\n\nDo you have any predictions or thoughts? Please feel free to leave comments below!! I am so glad that I’m back to blogging for all of you, and I cannot wait to do some pieces for you all. First, I have to release my reviews of Avengers: Age of Ultron and Pitch Perfect 2, which were amazing. Also you can look forward to a movie musical based post for Tony month, with reviews of Jurassic World and Inside Out.\n\nUntil next time folks,\n\nYour Favorite Ginger\n\nHey all,\n\nSo today, March 22, is a special someone’s birthday. Today is the 85th birthday of the great musical theatre composer Stephen Sondheim. (I KNOW….IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE HE’S 85…HE BETTA!!)\n\nStephen Sondheim’s work holds a special place in my heart because he was one of the most influential composers in my adolescent years. I remember seeing Into the Woods for the first time in middle school (actually I remember getting it through Netflix on my last day of 6th grade) and being enthralled with his music. It was like nothing I heard before, and his lyrics were incredible. Since then, I have been very obsessed with his work. So to commemorate today, I thought I would make a Ginger’s Top Picks with my personal top 10 Stephen Sondheim musicals. I might cause some high brow musical theatre debates, which is okay and makes you folks talk, but, hey it’s my personal opinion. Here are the Ginger’s Top 10 Sondheim Musicals. (Included with each show is some show credits/info provided by PlaybillVault.com, which y’all MTN’s need to look into because this sight is the bomb diggity, and Wikipedia.)\n\n10. Merrily We Roll Along\n\nThis little cult of a musical makes the first appearance on this countdown. The musical, based on the George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart play but updated, tells the journey of three friends and how fame tests them, and ultimately tears them apart. Simple right? Not with this musical. You see, this musical takes that plot concept and takes the audience on a backwards journey. So we start the show in 1976 and end the show in 1957. CRAZY!! What’s even crazier is this was considered as Sondheim’s biggest flop in his career and ended his partnership with Hal Prince until 2003. I did not really become familiar with this show personally until I the summer I started my masters. I knew about some song gems that are just genius and gorgeous, especially “Not a Day Goes By”, “Old Friends” and “Franklin Shepard, Inc.”. But, although I see how it initially did not do well because of the concept, this is honestly a great show. The characters are literally fleshed out and real, especially the trio of friends (Frank, Charley and Mary), and there are moments that beautiful on stage. It also is a show that screams Sondheim. Just take a listen at some songs from this show, it’s beautiful.\n\nSome Show Credits/InfoBook: George Furth\n\nTheatre of Broadway Premiere: Alvin Theater (now the Neil Simon Theatre)\n\nOpening Night: November 16, 1981\n\nClosing Night: November 28, 1981\n\nPerformances: 16\n\nCast: Jim Walton (Frank), Lonny Price (Charley), Ann Morrison (Mary), Sally Kelin (Beth), Jason Alexander (Joe), Terry Finn (Gussie)\n\nRevivals: 1994 Off-Broadway Revival Production (this is the current licensing version through MTI)\n\nAnother NY Production: 2012 Encores Concert (starring Colin Donnell, Celia Keenan-Bolger, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Betsy Wolfe and Elizabeth Stanley)\n\nNotable Songs: “Merrily We Roll Along”, “Old Friends”, “Growing Up”, “Not a Day Goes By”, “Good Thing Going”, “Opening Doors”, “Our Time”\n\n9. Follies\n\nTo explain this musical in a nutshell, it’s about a group of retired dancers/singers from the “Weismann’s Follies” (based on the Ziegfeld Follies) have a reunion in their crumbling theatre, which is scheduled for demolition. The main focus is about two couples, Buddy and Sally Durant Plummer, and Benjamin and Phyllis Rogers Stone, who’s past comes back to haunt them. This show was a big success, following very closely after Sondheim’s first mega hit Company. There are some great songs that are just simple and smart. The plot, in my opinion, is very depressing because these people are clearly in the wrong relationship, and end up staying in their unhappy relationship by the end of the show. This also features some great supporting characters that get some star shining moments, especially Carlotta Campion and Hattie Walker. Also, some great show stopping solos from the leads.\n\nSome Show Credits/Info\n\nBook: James Goldman\n\nTheatre of Broadway Premiere: Winter Garden Theatre\n\nOpening Night: April 4, 1971\n\nClosing Night: July 1, 1972\n\nPerformances: 522\n\nCast: Alexis Smith (Phyllis), John McMartin (Ben), Dorothy Collins (Sally), Gene Nelson (Buddy), Yvonne De Carlo (Carlotta)\n\nTony Awards: Best Director of a Musical, Best Leading Actress in a Musical (Alexis Smith), Best Original Score, Best Choreography, Best Scenic Design, Best Costume Design, Best Lighting Design\n\nRevivals: 2001 Broadway Revival Production (starring Blythe Danner and Judith Ivey)\n\n2011 Broadway Revival Production (starring Bernadette Peters, Jan Maxwell, Elaine Page, Rob Raines and Danny Burstein; Winner of a Tony Award for Best Costume Design)\n\nNotable Songs: “Beautiful Girls”, “In Buddy’s Eyes”, “I’m Still Here”, “Too Many Mornings”, “Could I Leave You?”, “You’re Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through”, “The God-Why-Don’t-You-Love-Me Blues”, “Losing My Mind”, “The Story of Lucy and Jessie”\n\n8. West Side Story\n\nThis is the only show on the countdown where Sondheim wrote the lyrics, and not the music. Basically a modernization of Romeo and Juliet, this show has a moving score, and even more great lyrics. The lyrics in this musical are smart while also filling in the times of being charming. What is surprising is this musical was not popular until the hit that was the 1961 film version. Although it is not the same as the show, it is a pretty incredible film. This was also Sondheim’s first Broadway show produced on Broadway. Here are some songs from this classic.\n\nSome Show Credits/Info\n\nMusic: Leonard Bernstein\n\nBook: Arthur Laurents\n\nTheatre of Broadway Premiere: Winter Garden Theatre\n\nOpening Night: September 26, 1957\n\nClosing Night: June 27, 1959\n\nPerformances: 732\n\nCast: Larry Kert (Tony), Carol Lawrence (Maria), Chita Rivera (Anita), Ken Leroy (Benrardo), Mikey Calin (Riff)\n\nTony Awards: Best Choreography and Best Sound Design\n\nRevivals: 1980 Broadway Revival Production (starring Debbie Allen and Josie de Guzman)\n\n2009 Broadway Revival Production (starring Matt Cavenaugh, Josefina Scaglione, Karen Olivo; Winner of a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical (Karen Olivo))\n\nFilm Version: 1961 starring Richard Beymer, Natalie Wood, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno, Geoge Chakiris\n\nNotable Songs: “Something’s Coming”, “America”, “Cool”, “Tonight”, “I Feel Pretty”, “Gee, Officer Krupke”, “A Boy Like That/I Have A Love”\n\n7. Passion\n\nIf there ever was a a score from Sondheim that is romantic and gorgeous, next to A Little Night Music, this is the show. Based on the Ettore Scola film Passione d’Amore, this beautiful show tells the story of a soldier, Giorgio, who is away from his love, Clara, and becomes the object of his captain’s cousin’s, Fosca, obsession. Eventually Giorgio learns to love Fosca as the woman who loves him unconditionally, no matter what. What is also interesting about this show is a pseudo-opera. It is beautiful, lush, and difficult for any singer, and keeps the action moving through music. There is just a lot of things to love about this show.\n\nSome Show Credits/Info\n\nBook: James Lapine\n\nTheatre of Broadway Premiere: Plymouth Theatre (now the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre)\n\nOpening Night: May 9, 1994\n\nClosing Night: January 7, 1995\n\nPerformances: 280\n\nCast: Jere Shea (Giorgio), Donna Murphy (Fosca), Marin Mazzie (Clara)\n\nTony Awards: Best Musical, Best Leading Actress in a Musical (Donna Murphy), Best Original Score, Best Book of a Musical\n\nRevivals: 2013 Off-Broadway Revival Production (starring Judy Kuhn, Melissa Errico, Ryan Silverman)\n\nAnother NY Production: 2005 New York Philharmonic Concert (starring Michael Cerveris, Patti LuPone, Audra McDonald)\n\nNotable Songs: “Happiness” , “I Read”, “Trio (Fifth Letter)”, “I Wish I Could Forget You”, “Is This What You Called Love?”, “Loving You”, “Just Another Love Story”, “No One Has Ever Loved Me”\n\n6. Company\n\nThis show is a great representation of relationships, and many peoples views on marriage. It was so ground breaking for its time that it sparked the idea of the modern musical theatre piece. There are so many great things about this show. The characters are real and three dimensional, the writing is fantastic, and the idea of Bobby being the blank slate and being molded into the man they want him to be, which he fights against and finds a voice for himself. The moment he says, “But who will I have to take care of?” is the most amazing part of the show. The songs are also beautiful, catchy, and character driven. It’s just a great musical that really started the big successful waves of mega hits in the 1970s.\n\nSome Show Credits/Info\n\nBook: George Furth\n\nTheatre of Broadway Premiere: Alvin Theatre (now the Neil Simon Theatre)\n\nOpening Night: April 26, 1970\n\nClosing Night: January 1, 1972\n\nPerformances: 705\n\nCast: Dean Jones (Robert) (later Larry Kert), Elaine Strich (Joanne), Merle Louise (Susan), Pamela Myers (Marta), Donna McKechnie (Kathy)\n\nTony Awards: Best Musical, Best Director of a Musical, Best Original Music, Best Original Lyrics, Best Scenic Design\n\nRevivals: 1995 Broadway Revival Production (starring Boyd Gaines, Danny Burstein, Veanne Cox, Charlotte d’Amboise, Kate Burton, LaChanze, Jane Krakowski)\n\n2006 Broadway Revival Production (starring Raul Esparza, Barbara Walsh; Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical)\n\nAnother NY Production: 2011 New York Philharmonic Concert (starring Neil Patrick Harris, Stephen Colbert, Patti LuPone, Martha Plimpton, Anika Noni Rose, Katie Finneran)\n\nNotable Songs: “Company”, “The Little Things You Do Together”, “Sorry-Grateful”, “You Could Drive A Person Crazy”, “Another Hundred People”, “Getting Married Today”, “Marry Me A Little”, “Barcelona”, “The Ladies Who Lunch”, “Being Alive”\n\n5. Assassins\n\nWhat do you get when you mix Sondheim with some of the most hated assassins in United States history? Musical theatre gold!! I was not familiar with this show until my college did it during my junior year. This show is amazing in its concept, music and character development. There is so much I can say about this show and how brilliant it is, but then it would be a long section. Just listen to some of the music on the clips, and see for yourself. And the craziest part of it all is it did not make its Broadway premiere until 2004. It had been a huge success in 1990 Off-Broadway and other regional productions.\n\nSome Show Credits/Info\n\nBook: John Weidman\n\nTheatre of Broadway Premiere: Studio 54\n\nOpening Night: April 22, 2004\n\nClosing Night: July 18, 2004\n\nPerformances: 101\n\nCast: Marc Kudish (The Proprietor), Neil Patrick Harris (The Balladeer/Lee Harvey Oswald), Michael Cerveris (John Wilkes Booth), Denis O’Hare (Charles Guiteau), Alexander Gemignani (John Hinckley, Jr.), Becky Ann Baker (Sara Jane Moore), Mary Catherine Garrison (Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme)\n\nTony Awards: Best Revival of a Musical, Best Director of a Musical, Best Featured Actor in a Musical (Michael Cerveris), Best Lighting Design, Best Orchestrations\n\nOriginal NY Production: 1990 Off-Broadway Production (starring Patrick Cassidy, Victor Garber, Terrence Mann, Debra Monk, Annie Golden, William Parry)\n\nNotable Songs: “Everybody’s Got the Right”, “The Ballad of Booth”, “The Gun Song”, “Unworthy of Your Love”, “Another National Anthem”\n\n4. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n\nI think I might have caused the high brow musical theatre debates by putting this at number 4 instead of number one, but hey at least it is on my top 5. This easily one of Sondheim’s masterpieces. The score is filled with amazing orchestrations, some incredible songs and harmonies, and scary at some moments. If there was any time Sondheim wrote an opera, this is where you can argue that. It’s similar to Milton Babbit or Berg’s Wozzeck. Plus there is nothing like hearing Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou sing this score. It just gives you goosebumps. Seeing this growing up made me realize how much of a genius Sondheim really is in the musical theatre world. Also, this is one of his most performed musical, next to Into the Woods.\n\nSome Show Credits/Info\n\nBook: Hugh Wheeler\n\nTheatre of Broadway Premiere: Uris Theatre (now the Gershwin Theatre)\n\nOpening Night: March 1, 1979\n\nClosing Night: June 29, 1980\n\nPerformances: 557\n\nCast: Len Carious (Sweeney Todd), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Lovett), Victor Garber (Anthony), Merle Louise (The Beggar Woman), Sarah Rice (Johanna), Ken Jennings (Tobias), Edmund Lyndeck (Judge Turpin)\n\nTony Awards: Best Musical, Best Director of a Musical, Best Leading Actor in a Musical (Len Cariou), Best Leading Actress in a Musical (Angela Lansbury), Best Original Score, Best Book of a Musical, Best Scenic Design, Best Costume Design\n\nRevivals: 1989 Broadway Revival Production (starring Bob Gunton, Beth Fowler, Eddie Korbich, Jim Walton)\n\n2009 Broadway Revival Production (starring Michael Cerveris, Patti LuPone, Manoel Felciano, Alexander Gemignani, Lauren Molina, Mark Jacoby; Tony Award for Best Director of a Musical and Best Orchestrations)\n\nAnother NY Production: 2000 New York Philharmonic Concert (starring George Hearn, Patti LuPone, Neil Patrick Harris, Audra McDonald)\n\n2014 New York Philharmonic Concert (starring Bryn Terfel, Emma Thompson, Philip Quast, Christian Borle, Audra McDonald)\n\nFilm Version: 2007 starring Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Sacha Baron Cohen, Laura Michelle Kelly, Timothy Spall\n\nNotable Songs: “The Ballad of Sweeney Todd”, “The Worst Pies in London”, “Green Finch and Linnet Bird”, “Johanna”, “Wait”, “Pretty Women”, “Epiphany”, “A Little Priest”, “By the Sea”, “Not While I’m Around”\n\n3. Into the Woods\n\nJust like Assassins, Into the Woods is the result of when you mix Sondheim with Grimm Fairy Tales. There is no surprise that this show ended up so high on my list because it was the first Sondheim musical i have ever seen. At first, growing up, I did not like the plot of it because of the young age I was. I had a love hate relationship with this musical. But, when my college did it my senior year, and I saw the show again after all the things I have been through in life, I loved it and felt it was a great piece of musical theatre. I understand why colleges and high schools do this musical, and why the piece has a longevity. Not only does have this great, challenging score, it contains this plot that is central, beautiful and talks about everything we face with parenting, adolescence, and growing up. Plus, I love the fact it beat a little show known as The Phantom of the Opera for Best Original Score and Best Book of a Musical.\n\nSome Show Credits/Info\n\nBook: James Lapine\n\nTheatre of Broadway Premiere: Martin Beck Theatre (now the Al Hirschfeld Theatre)\n\nOpening Night: November 5, 1987\n\nClosing Night: September 3, 1989\n\nPerformances: 765 performances\n\nCast: Tom Aldredge (Narrator/The Mysterious Man), Bernadette Peters (The Witch), Joanna Gleason (The Baker’s Wife), Chip Zien (The Baker), Kim Crosby (Cinderella), Ben Wright (Jack), Danielle Ferland (Little Red Ridinghood), Barbara Bryne (Jack’s Mother), Robert Westenberg (The Wolf/Cinderella’s Prince), Chuck Wagner (Rapunzel’s Prince)\n\nTony Awards: Best Leading Actress in a Musical (Joanna Gleason), Best Original Score, Best Book of a Musical\n\nRevivals: 2002 Broadway Revival Production (starring John McMartin, Vanessa Williams, Kerry O’Malley, Stephen DeRosa, Laura Benanti, Adam Wylie, Molly Ephraim, Gregg Edelman, Christopher Sieber; Tony Awards for Best Revival of a Musical and Best Lighting Design)\n\nAnother NY Production: 2012 Shakespeare in the Park (starring Amy Adams, Donna Murphy, Denis O’Hare, Chip Zien, Gideon Glick, Jessie Mueller, Jack Broderick)\n\n2015 Off-Broadway Production (starring Jennifer Mudge, Ben Steinfeld, Jessie Austrain, Claire Karpen, Patrick Mulryan, Emily Young, Paul L.

A Little Night Music\n\nThis show really has a special place in my heart. It was my senior high school show, and one of the best experiences of my life. I find this show one of the best shows produced by Sondheim. It used to be my number one, until I finally was introduced to our number one pick on this countdown. Based on the Igmar Bergman film, it has a Midsummer Night’s Dream quality to the plot where couples are with the wrong person, but somehow by the end of the show, they end up with the right person. It is also very sensual for a musical, and there are some scenes that are just brilliantly written for any actor. And the music is simplistic, like drinking champagne, and has some brilliant lyrics. Also, I really hope there is a new, better film version than the one from 1977 with Elizabeth Taylor. It’s pretty bad. But, the show is amazing and that’s all you need to know.\n\nSome Show Credits/Info\n\nBook: Hugh Wheeler\n\nTheatre of Broadway Premiere: Schubert Theatre\n\nOpening Night: February 25, 1973\n\nClosing Night: August 3, 1974\n\nPerformances: 601 performances\n\nCast: Glynis Johns (Desirée Armfeldt), Len Carious (Fredrik Egerman), Hermoine Gingold (Madame Armfeldt), Victoria Mallory (Anne Egerman), Mark Lambert (Henrik Egerman), Patricia Elliott (Charlotte Malcom), Laurence Guittard (Carl-Magnus Malcolm)\n\nTony Awards: Best Musical, Best Leading Actress in a Musical (Glynis Johns), Best Featured Actress in a Musical (Patricia Elliott), Best Original Score, Best Book of a Musical, Best Costume Design\n\nRevivals: 2009 Broadway Revival Production (starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Alexander Hanson, Angela Lansbury, Romona Mallory, Hunter Ryan Herdlicka, Erin Davie, Aaron Lazar, Leigh Anne Larkin; Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical (Catherine Zeta-Jones))\n\nFilm Version: 1977 starring Elizabeth Taylor, Lesley-Anne Down, Diana Rigg, Len Cariou, Hermoine Gingold, Laurence Guittard\n\nNotable Songs: “Now/Later/Soon”, “You Must Meet My Wife”, “Liaisons”, “In Praise of Women”, “Every Day A Little Death”, “A Weekend in the Country”, “It Would Have Been Wonderful”, “Send in the Clowns”, “The Miller’s Son”\n\n1. Sunday in the Park with George\n\nThis music has one of those scores that without fail will give me chills and make me burst out in tears. It is literally up there with Ragtime. This musical is literally two one act shows in one, like Into the Woods. You have the first act with a fictional look into the life of pointillism artist George Seurat. The second act is a look into the future with his great-grandchild, and how he is facing the same creative challenge as the George in the first act. I find this show to be beautiful with it’s score, scope and look. It is quite a moving show, especially being an aspiring artist. Sometimes I just pop it in when I am feeling inspired, or want a good cry sometimes. The harmonies in “Sunday”….I cry thinking about it. Just listen to some songs, and just witness this exquisite score.\n\nSome Show Credits/Info\n\nBook: James Lapine\n\nTheatre of Broadway Premiere: Booth Theatre\n\nOpening Night: May 2, 1984\n\nClosing Night: October 13, 1985\n\nPerformances: 604 performances\n\nCast: Mandy Patinkin (George), Bernadette Peters (Dot/Marie), Barbara Bryne (Old Lady/Blair Daniels), Charles Kimbrough (Jules/Bob Greenberg), Dana Ivey (Yvonne/Naomi Eisen), Robert Westenberg (Soldier/Alex), Judith Moore (Nurse/Mrs./Harriet Pawling)\n\nTony Awards: Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design\n\nRevivals: 2008 Broadway Revival Production (starring Daniel Evans, Jenna Russell, Gay Soper, Simon Green, Joanne Redman)\n\nNotable Songs: “Sunday in the Park with George”, “No Life”, “Color and Light”, “Everybody Loves Louis”, “Finishing the Hat”, “We Do Not Belong Together”, “Sunday”, “It’s Hot Up Here”, “Putting It Together”, “Children and Art”, “Lesson #8”, “Move On”\n\nWell there is the Ginger’s Top Picks for the top 10 Stephen Sondheim musicals. Again, the guy is awesome. See y’all next time!\n\n-Your Favorite Ginger\n\nDisney’s Cinderella\n\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh\n\nCast: Lily James (Ella (“Cinderella”)), Richard Madden (Prince “Kit” Charming), Cate Blanchett (Lady Tremaine), Helena Bonham Carter (The Fairy Godmother), Holliday Grainger (Anastasia), Sophie McShera (Drizella), Derek Jacobi (The King), Stellan Skarsgard (The Grand Duke), Nonso Anozie (Captain), Hayley Atwell (Cinderella’s Mother), Ben Chaplin (Cinderella’s Father), Eloise Webb (Young Ella)\n\nScreenplay: Chris Weitz\n\nBased on the Disney animated feature film Cinderella and the fairy tale Cendrillon by Charles Perrault\n\nRating: PG for mild thematic elements\n\nRunning Time: 1 hr. 52 mins.\n\nLast night my boyfriend and I went to a showing of Disney’s new live action film version of Cinderella. I went in there with some pretty big expectations, and came out with those expectations met, and then some.\n\nWARNING!! IF YOU HAVE BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK AND DO NOT KNOW THE TALE OF CINDERELLA…THEN SKIP THIS SECTION BECAUSE THIS HAS SOME SPOILERS! (You have been warned).\n\nAt the start of the film, we meet Ella living with her wealthy parents in a beautiful estate. From a young age, Ella is taught by her mother to believe in the eistence and presence of magic, which allows her to befriend many animals, particularly the mice. Everything seems perfect until Ella’s mother falls ill. On her deathbed, Ella’s mother makes Ella promise that she’ll always have courage and show kindness to others. Years later, Ella’s father reveals that he has chosen an old acquaintance’s widow, Lady Tremaine, as his second wife. Ella warmly welcomes Lady Tremaine and her two daughters, Drizella and Anastasia, despite their unpleasant attitudes and needing to protect her mice friends from Lucifer, her stepmother’s cat. While away on business, Ella’s father becomes ill and also passes away. This new loss results in Lady Tremaine revealing her true cold, cruel and jealous nature. She dismisses the servants and forces Ella to do all their housework, gives Ella’s room to her stepsisters, and forces Ella to sleep in the attic. Some nights, the attic becomes too cold for Ella to sleep, thus sleeps by the fireplace, which causes soot to cover her face. Her stepsisters see this, and decide to call her Cinderella, which she later calls herself.\n\nCrushed by the cruelty of her new family, Cinderella goes for a ride in the woods where she encounters a hunting part. She encounters a hunting party and encounters an apprentice named Kit. Unbeknownst to her, Kit is actually the son of the the land’s dying king, and, despite knowing her name, Kit is enchanted by Cinderella’s charm, kindness, and uniqueness. With time running out, the King insists that Kit finds a bride at the upcoming ball. Determined to run into the mystery girl in the woods, he decides to invite every eligible maiden in the land to attend the ball. The Tremaine family is ecstatic at the news, and quickly make preparations with the prospect of marrying royalty. With Lady Tremaine refusing to buy Cinderella a dress, Cinderella fashions one herself from one of her mother’s dresses with help from the mice. The night of the ball, Ella tries to join her family on the way out, but Lady Tremaine rips the dress claiming that her mere presence will disgrace them. As they leave and Ella is in tears, an old beggar woman appears and asks for milk. Cinderella graciously gives the woman some milk, and the woman reveals herself to be he Fairy Godmother. With her magic she turns a pumpkin into a carriage, the four mice into horses, two lizards into footmen, and a goose into a coachman. Finally, she turns Ella’s dress into a gorgeous blue gown complete with glass slippers. Cinderella heads to the ball with full warning that magic only lasts till midnight.\n\nAt the ball, Cinderella reunites with Kit and wins the coveted first dance. She learns of his true identity and is pleasantly surprised. They run off for a tour of the palace and the grounds slowly falling in love, which irritates the Grand Duke as he secretly married Kit to another princess, a fact that Lady Tremaine over hears. Before Kit can learn her name, the clock strikes 11:59, and Cinderella flees from the ball dropping one of her glass slippers on the steps of the palace (EYYOOO!!). She manages to get away before the last stroke of midnight and hides the other show as a memento. The King soon dies, but not before giving Kit permission to find his true love. It is then announced that every maiden in the kingdom is to try on the slipper. Ella goes to her room to try and find her slipper, only to see Lady Tremaine waiting for her with it in her hand. Knowing that Cinderella was the mysterious girl at the ball, Lady Tremaine demands Cinderella to make her head of the royal family, give her daughters husbands, and allow Lady Tremaine to become queen. Cinderella refuses, Lady Tremaine smashes the shoe and locks Cinderella in her room. She brings the remaining bits of the shoe and Cinderella’s indentity to the Grand Duke, and blackmails him with the reward of the title of countess with worthy husbands for her daughters. The Duke takes the shattered shoe to Kit hoping to convince him to forget about Cinderella, but he becomes more determined to find her.\n\nThe Grand Duke and the captain of the guard lead a troop around the kingdom to find the maiden to fit the glass slipper. By the time they reach the Tremaine estate, no one has been able to fit the slipper being rejected by its magic. When the shoe rejects Drizella and Anastasia, the Duke and Captain turn to leave, but hear Cinderella singing thanks to the mice opening her attic window. The Grand duke tries to leave anyway but is stopped by one of his men, who reveals to be Kit in disguise and demands the Captain investigate the sound. Once Cinderella is found, Lady Tremaine tries to forbid her from trying on the slipper, but is overruled by the Captain. The slipper fits Cinderella, and she leaves Kit after forgiving her stepmother, who is later forced to leave the kingdom with her daughters and the Grand Duke. Cinderella and Kit are married, crowned king and queen, and live happily ever after ruling with courage and kindness.\n\nSPOILERS END HERE!!!\n\nThis is the third time Disney has created a live action telling with some twists to be a companion to its animated classics. The first one was in 2010 with Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, which was a modern telling of the 1951 animated film of the same name, and their second one was Maleficent, which was a modern telling of 1959’s Sleeping Beauty from the villain’s side. Both films have done very well, especially Maleficent. I must say, this live action version is at their level of doing well, in terms of retelling the story, but also goes a step higher based on them being very true to their source materials, especially the 1950 animated classic.\n\nChris Weitz’s script really gives all these characters three dimensions and a voice in this film, which I found very believable. I also loved that we saw Ella’s life before her stepmother and stepsisters. The first 10/15 minutes of the film really help set up the rest of the story beautifully, especially the scene on her mother’s death bed. Also, I loved that film took some elements from the Perrault version of the tale and had Cinderella and the Prince meet once before the ball, have Lady Tremaine just be scorned by the loss of her first husband and just marry Cinderella’s father for money, and have the Fairy Godmother be a beggar woman who reveals herself when Cinderella shows her kindness and generosity. Finally, I really loved how the relationship between Cinderella and Kit was believable. It grew fast, but still there was a meeting, a second meeting with a courtship, and then a final meeting with him accepting her as she is, which was beautiful.\n\nKenneth Branagh did a wonderful job with this piece from vision to execution. The film is exquisite to witness on the screen. The set design was beautiful, the costume design was spectacular by Sandy Powell, especially Cinderella’s blue gown, Patrick Doyle’s score was sensational, and the cinematography was bold and beautiful. The one thing I loved about the film was each character had a color palette. Cinderella was always in innocent colors like blues, pinks and whites; the stepsisters were in bold, annoying, outburst colors of pink and yellow; and Lady Tremaine has some variations of green to show her jealous, envious nature. I will get on my soapbox for a bit and say, get over Cinderella’s waist line in the film. Yes, I’m a big person and have body image issues to take up in some Hollywood films, and yes it’s scary looking, but she was wearing a petticoat and a corset to hold the dress up. The girl is naturally small, so when a corset is applied to a body type like hers, you get that result. This comes from some years of being in being in operas and musicals with some period costuming, it happens to girls that size. Even Lily James is tired of hearing about it and it makes her more self conscious, so everyone just let it go for a moment. But, anyway I digress and I know it’s not going to change anything (steps off soapbox). Despite that, the costumes are phenomenal. Again, beautiful film to view and it was like walking into a storybook.\n\nNow, let’s talk about some of the actors. Derek Jacobi, Stellen Skarsgard and Nonso Anozie, respectively as the King, the Grand Duke and the Captain, were great supporting characters to the film. They did their job in bringing some humor, drama and heart to the piece. Jacobi did a beautiful job with Madden in bringing a relationship between the Prince and the King that I thought was really beautiful. It was very moving when he died three quarters of the way through the film. Stellen Skarsgard was great and villainous, especially in his scenes with Lady Tremaine. And Anozie really did a great job with a role that can sometimes be considered a prop role. He really gave it many dimensions and you liked the camaraderie he had with Madden’s Kit in the film.\n\nHolliday Grainger and Sophie McShera, as Anastasia and Drizella, were hysterical in their roles. They really did a beautiful job at acting like pretty faced, spoiled girls. There were some scenes that really made you roll in you seat with laughter. I think two of my favorite moments in the film that feature them are when they’re getting ready for the ball with their corset and skirt cages, and when they see the prince arrive to the estate. Just watch their feet, it’s hysterical.\n\nHelena Bonham Carter, as the Fairy Godmother, was delightful. Her ten minutes on screen were some of the best ten minutes. The true work of an actor is when they can make a small role rememberable after the film is over, and she just did that. I also liked that she was the narrator of the film to keep her in the film as a prominent figure even though she realistically is seen in the film for a short amount of time. Plus, she had moments of great dry humor throughout her scene that really was a great addition into the film.\n\nCate Blanchett, as Lady Tremaine, what more can I say? Not only did she look stunning in the film and had literally the best entrance in the film, she gives one of the best performances in the film. She was so villainous that you loved to hate her in this film. What I also loved was her progression of evil in this film. She when from subtle jealously, to little snaps of evil here and there, to full on disgusting evil, which I just loved. She was the one person I was excited to see in this film, and she delivered.\n\nRichard Madden, as Kit, just made you want to swoon. Not only was he easy on the eyes, but he was a true gentleman. He also gave the Prince in this film more of a plot and a voice in this film. He wasn’t a prop, or just there for the ball and fall in love with Cinderella. He had a story to be interested in, and wanted to find ways to make his kingdom better, which I applaud Weitz’s writing for that character and Madden’s acting.\n\nFinally, Lily James, as Cinderella, was stunning in the role. She was sweet, generous and kind, but also feisty and not afraid to speak her mind. She really gave the role more dimensions and made her a woman of the 21st century for people. The one thing about her performance that makes me excited is that it shows girls that if you’re kind, courageous, well educated, speak your mind, and not snobbish, you will have your dreams fulfilled. I think that is the most beautiful thing to take away from her Cinderella. She also handled the fact fact she was in 95% of the film with grace and did a spectacular job with being the headliner in her second, or third, big budget film (which I’m just guessing because I know she was in Wrath of the Titans, which I have never seen so this was my first film with her).\n\nIf asked to grade this film on a scale of 1-10, I would give it a solid 8.5. This film does a beautiful job at telling the classic fairy tale with sticking to the original material, does a beautiful job at meeting the bar set by its predecessors, and just is a beautiful film that melts your heart. Well done Walt Disney Pictures. Well, done! You can catch this film in theaters now, and here is a trailer to inspire you to see this film!\n\nThat’s all folks! Until next time!\n\n-Your Favorite Ginger\n\nHello all,\n\nSo I really enjoyed doing this Oscar themed blogathon, I really did. And now that it is coming to an end, here are my predictions for the 87th Academy Awards on Sunday, February 22, at 8:30 pm. The ceremony starts at 8:30, the red carpet starts at 7 pm. This season has been very interesting with some even more interesting films. And, I’ve personally have predicted about 50% of the Golden Globe and SAG awards correctly, so hopefully this may turn out a little better.\n\nJust like the past predictions, the titles and nominees in bold are what I think will win, the nominees with an astrix (*) are what I think should win, and the nominees with a plus sign (+) are what I think could win. So, here we go. Unlike the SAG and Golden Globes, I am going to go backwards and have Best Picture be last. I also will not be predicting Best Documentary Feature, Best Documentary Short Subject, Best Live Action Short Film, and Best Animated Short Film because the only one I know is Feast and I think it will win.\n\nTHE TECHNICAL AWARDS\n\nBest Sound Editing\n\nAmerican Sniper+\n\nBirdman\n\nThe Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*+\n\nInterstellar\n\nUnbroken\n\nI’m going to to start right off the bat and say that I think Interstellar is going to sweep at the technical awards because, I haven’t seen the film, that’s all that anyone talks about is how cool the film is technically. It seems that Christopher Nolan’s team always does well at the Academy Awards, and this might be one of those instances. However, don’t count out The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies because there was a lot of sounds that needed to be edited, and I feel they did a fantastic job at doing that. Or American Sniper because it will be a left field win, like it came out of left field.\n\nBest Sound Mixing\n\nAmerican Sniper+\n\nBirdman\n\nInterstellar*\n\nUnbroken\n\nWhiplash*\n\nAgain, I think Interstellar might win this sweep this one, but do not count out Whiplash because there are a lot of different drum-like noises heard throughout the film. This along with J.K. Simmons shouting over it that is quite interesting to view on film. Or again, American Sniper could be the big surprise.\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes+\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy*\n\nInterstellar\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past*\n\nThis is one category that is packed, and could go either way. But, again, I feel Interstellar might come out on top, but don’t count out X-Men: Days of Future Past or Guardians of the Galaxy. Both of the visual effects in this film are top of the notch and incredible. Also, I feel Dawn of the Planet of the Apes could win because the acting from the apes is incredible, and that is the one thing I remember most about the film.\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nBirdman\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel*\n\nIda\n\nMr. Turner\n\nUnbroken+\n\nThis deals with color, camera movent, etc. I really feel that The Grand Budapest Hotel has this one in the bag because the colors are beautiful, the camera work is fluid and very Wes Anderson, and it is definitely one of the most beautiful films I saw this year. Although, I would not count out Unbroken because there are some moments that are gritty and beautifully captured on film.\n\nBest Film Editing\n\nAmerican Sniper+\n\nBoyhood*\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel\n\nThe Imitation Game\n\nWhiplash*\n\nI was not that much of a fan of the film Boyhood, however I throughly felt the editing in this movie was impressive and very fluid. There was never a moment where I felt the transitions of time were choppy. But, again I wouldn’t cut out Whiplash or American Sniper because there were many moments that are faced paced and very well edited with little to no foul ups.\n\nFEATURE FILM AWARDS\n\nBest Foreign Language Film\n\nIda (Poland)*+\n\nLeviathan (Russia)\n\nTangerines (Estonia)\n\nTimbuktu (Mauritania)\n\nWild Tales (Argentina)\n\nI am making this prediction based on the Golden Globe Awards, and I feel Leviathan is going to come home with this award. However, I feel Ida is more of a powerful film, beautifully shot, and should win this award, and it could win it. There are many times where the Academy goes to the opposite direction than the Hollywood Foreign Press.\n\nBest Animated Feature Film\n\nBig Hero 6 (Walt Disney Animation Studios)*\n\nThe Boxtrolls (Focus Features, Laika)\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2 (20th Century Fox, DreamWorks Animation)+\n\nSong of the Sea (StudioCanal, Haut et Court)\n\nThe Tale of Princess Kaguya (Studio Ghibli, Toho)\n\nThis is an instance where I feel the Academy is going to honor Walt Disney Studios with an Oscar. They really outdid themselves with this follow up of their mega hit Frozen. Plus, it deals with really adult issues, especially the grieving process. Although I heard that How to Train Your Dragon 2 was really good and it could win as well. Plus, it would be the first time since 2005’s Wallace and Gromit that DreamWorks won an Oscar.\n\nARTISTIC, MUSIC AND WRITING AWARDS\n\nBest Makeup and Hairstyling\n\nFoxcatcher\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel*+\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy\n\nI think based on the look of Steve Carrel, who is unrecognizable, I firmly feel Foxcatcher will win this award. Although, I also wouldn’t count out The Grand Budapest Hotel because there are some great looks in this film with a lot of the characters, especially from Tilda Swinton. Also I’m a little upset Into the Woods was not nominated because the make-up job on Meryl Streep is exquisite.\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel+\n\nInherent Vice\n\nInto the Woods*\n\nMaleficent+\n\nMr. Turner\n\nHonestly, I feel 100% this award should go to Into the Woods because Colleen Atwood’s costumes are beautiful, especially Cinderella’s ball gown and Meryl Streep’s glam witch outfit. However, I wouldn’t count out The Grand Budapest Hotel, or Maleficent because those costumes are gorgeous as well.\n\nBest Production Design\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel*\n\nThe Imitation Game+\n\nInterstellar\n\nInto the Woods+\n\nMr. Turner\n\nI feel that this award should go to The Grand Budapest Hotel because the sets used were beautifully designed. The colors were beautiful, and the showing of the different hotels were creative and wonderful. However, I felt Into the Woods and The Imitation Game had some beautiful sets, especially The Imitation Games machine used to crack enigma.\n\nBest Original Song\n\nBegin Again – “Lost Stars” +\n\n(Music and Lyrics: Gregg Alexander, Dnaielle Brisebois, Nick Lashley and Nick Southwood; Performed by Adam Levin)\n\nBeyond the Lights – “Grateful”\n\n(Music and Lyrics: Diane Warren; Performed by Rita Ora)\n\nGlen Campbell: I’ll Be Me – “I’m Not Gonna Miss You”\n\n(Music and Lyric: Glen Campbell and Julian Raymond; Performed by Glen Campbell)\n\nThe Lego Movie – “Everything Is Awesome”\n\n(Music and Lyrics: Shawn Patterson, Joshua Bartholomew, Lisa Harriton and the Lonely Island; Performed by Tegan and Sara with The Lonely Island)\n\nSelma – “Glory” *\n\n(Music, Lyrics and Performed by John Legend and Common)\n\nThis award has a clear winner, and the award will go to Selma, no question. Not only is it a great message song, it is has a hook that gives you goosebumps. Although, if the Academy decides to go the indie route, Begin Again‘s big song may win because it is kind of like the “Falling Slowly” for the 2010s.\n\nBest Original Score\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel – Alexandre Desplat\n\nThe Imitation Game – Alexandra Desplat*\n\nInterstellar – Hans Zimmer+\n\nMr. Turner – Gary Yershon\n\nThe Theory of Everything – Jóhann Jóhannsson*\n\nThis category is tough because I really loved Desplat’s score in The Imitation Game and Jóhannsson’s score in The Theory of Everything. By there is something about Jóhannsson’s score that is simplistic, beautiful and just tear worthy. Although don’t count out Hans Zimmer. The Academy has some great respect for him, and he delivers an epic score.\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nBirdman – Alejandro González Iñàrritu, Nicolás Giacobone, Alexaner Dinelaris, Jr., and Armando Bo+\n\nBoyhood – Richard Linklater\n\nFoxcatcher – E. max Frye and Dan Futterman\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel – Wes Anderson and Hugo Guinness*+\n\nNightcrawler – Dan Gilroy\n\nI think Birdman is going to take this one home. Although I have not seen it, I have heard that the script is great, funny and smart. Although, I do love the script by Guinness and Anderson, and I think both could win it. I wouldn’t be upset though if The Grand Budapest Hotel got this award.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nAmerican Sniper – Jason Hall\n\nThe Imitation Game – Graham Moore*\n\nInherent Vice – Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nThe Theory of Everything – Anthony McCarten\n\nWhiplash – Damien Chazelle+\n\nLike Best Costume Design, I strongly feel that The Imitation Game should win this award. It is so well crafted, and some of the dialogue is beautifully written, especially the scenes during Alan Turing’s interrogation. However, I have also heard that Whiplash‘s script is great and so powerful, so I wouldn’t count it out. But if there is any award, besides Best Leading Actor, that I want The Imitation Game to win for, it is Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nACTING AND DIRECTING AWARDS\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nPatricia Arquette – Boyhood; Role – Olivia Evans\n\nLaura Dern – Wild; Role – Barbara “Bobbi” Grey\n\nKeira Knightley – The Imitation Game; Role – Joan Clarke\n\nEmma Stone – Birdman; Role – Sam Thomson\n\nMeryl Streep – Into the Woods; Role – The Witch*+\n\nI know I am a hypocrite by saying this because, at the Golden Globes, I was on the Arquette train…until I saw Boyhood. I did not like her character at all, nor her performance, but I feel she is going to win because everyone is raving about her performance. I feel that Meryl Streep should win her 4th Oscar with Into the Woods. She literally gives a performance that is transcendent and beautiful, and brings so many new levels to this well known character.\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nRobert Duvall – The Judge; Role – Judge Joseph Palmer\n\nEthan Hawke – Boyhood; Role – Mason Evans, Sr.*+\n\nEdward Norton – Birdman; Role – Mike Shiner\n\nMark Ruffalo – Foxcatcher; Role – Dave Schultz\n\nJ.K. Simmons – Whiplash; Role – Terence Fletcher\n\nI have not seen Whiplash yet, but I do feel J.K. Simmons is going to win it this year. I have heard that his performance is spectacular, which I am sure it is because J.K. Simmons is a wonderful actor. However, I feel that the award could, and should, go to Ethan Hawke. He was one of my favorite parts of Boyhood, which is sad because is on screen for 1 hr. 30 mins. of the 2 hrs. 45 mins. of film. But, both are deserving and give some great performances.\n\nBest Leading Actress\n\nMarion Cotillard – Two Days, One Night; Role – Sandra Bya\n\nFelicity Jones – The Theory of Everything; Role – Jane Wilde Hawking\n\nJulianne Moore – Still Alice; Role – Dr. Alice Howland\n\nRosamund Pike – Gone Girl; Role – Amy Elliot-Dunne*\n\nReese Witherspoon – Wild; Role – Cheryl Strayed+\n\nI have not seen Julianne Moore’s performance in Still Alice, but I think she is going to win this year, after being nominated so many t"
