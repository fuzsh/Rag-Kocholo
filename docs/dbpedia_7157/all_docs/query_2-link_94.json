        "text": "“Pitch Perfect” was one of 2012’s most unexpected hits, but given the smash hit status of “Glee” and the weird cult of college acapella, the movie’s popularity really shouldn’t have come as a surprise. A low-budget charmer that mixed sharp if occasionally over-broad comedy with the awesomeness of slightly drunk girls singing “No Diggity,” “Pitch Perfect” crushed it.\n\nWritten by returning “Pitch Perfect” scribe Kay Cannon and directed by first-timer Elizabeth Banks — who returns as one-half of the hysterical acapella commentator team with the note-perfect John Michael Higgins — “Pitch Perfect 2” has the same obstacles that all sequels face: How do you make essentially the same movie, but not? The answer is as traditional as four-part harmony: Road trip, duh!\n\n“2” picks up a few years after the original. Chloe (Brittany Snow) is the front woman for the Barden Bellas, now the perpetual collegiate acapella champs. Aspiring pop producer Beca (Anna Kendrick) is the musical director and Beca’s boyfriend Jesse (Skylar Astin) is still running his all-male group.\n\nEveryone is back: Lilly the mumbling weirdo (Hana Mae Lee), sexpot Stacie (Alexis Knapp), enthusiastic lesbian Cynthia-Rose (Ester Dean, who should have sung more) and the two who never get any lines (Kelley Jakle and Shelley Regner). On the boy side, Bumper (Adam DeVine), the one who ditched the male group to sing backup for John Mayer, is still hanging around campus, mostly to sleep with the almighty Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson and man alive, does the camera love her).\n\nThe structure for “2” is essentially the same as the first film’s: In the midst of a crisis, a freshman (Hailee Steinfeld) joins the crew. Instead of Beca’s mashups, she’s a songwriter who wants to perform original material. The group fractures, bonds and struggles to find redemption.\n\nThings start to go south when Fat Amy suffers a brutal wardrobe malfunction while the Bellas are performing for President Obama. They’re banned from collegiate competition, but that doesn’t mean they can’t compete at the world championships against pro-grade rivals, embodied by German group Das Sound Machine and their precise, more-than-slightly-master-race-ish acapella.\n\nFor awhile there, it looks like the movie’s other model is “Rocky 4,” as the scrappy Americans figure out how to beat an Eastern European juggernaut. There’s even a training montage and a few scenes at a corporate retreat, which serves as a way to bring the high-strung Aubrey (Anna Camp) back in to the fold.\n\nUnfortunately, and this feels like a churlish complaint given the likely enthusiasm of the target audience, Banks and Cannon end up overstuffing the story a bit, making it all sorts of fan-service-ish.\n\nEveryone gets a chance to hit her character’s tics: Chloe’s bi-curiousness, Amy’s endless confidence, Lily’s psychotic mumbling. This year’s Riff-Off happens in a weird millionaire’s basement — what’s up, David Cross? — rather than a campus quad; the finals take place in Copenhagen, with international acapella teams participating, rather than on the collegiate level.\n\nBut you have to give it up for Banks and Cannon’s weird sense of humor and way with a cameo. The Germans are appropriately terrifying. Keegan-Michael Key nearly wanders off with the movie in his scenes as the producer for whom Beca is interning. The Green Bay Packers show up for some reason. Add Fat Amy getting the Pat Benatar solo of a lifetime and a thoughtful, genuinely moving finale and it’s hard to stay aca-noyed for all that long. Enjoy, pitches!"
