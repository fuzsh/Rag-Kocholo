        "text": "Warm up those pipes, because Pitch Perfect is coming back!\n\nThe Peacock revival of the three-part film series about the hilarious—and often insane—world of competitive acapella has announced its stars. On March 4, it was revealed that Sarah Hyland, Jameela Jamil and Lera Abova have rounded out the ensemble cast. They join previously announced cast members Adam Devine and Flula Borg.\n\nThe series will follow Devine, who is reprising his role as Bumper Allen from the first two Pitch Perfect films, when he \"moves to Germany to revive his music career when one of his songs becomes big in Berlin.\"\n\nBorg is reprising his role of Piëter Krämer, who appeared in the second film installment. Piëter \"signs Bumper as his only client and brings him to Berlin to pursue his dreams.\"\n\nHyland, in her first television role since the end of Modern Family in 2020, plays Heidi, \"Piëter and Bumper's cheery and slightly odd American assistant.\" Of course, nobody in the Pitch Perfect universe is merely an assistant. Despite the dull day job, \"she secretly harbors dreams of being a singer-songwriter herself, and moonlights by performing original songs in a Berlin cabaret.\"\n\nAbova is set to play DJ Das Boot, \"Piëter's sister and a prominent Berlin DJ and music producer.\" This marks only Abova's second acting credit, after 2019's Anna.\n\nMegan Amram, formerly of The Good Place and Parks & Recreation, is acting as showrunner, writer and executive producer.\n\nThe team of executive producers also includes Elizabeth Banks, who appeared in all three Pitch Perfect movies and directed the second film.\n\nProduction is scheduled to begin soon in Berlin, so it's still going to be a while before we get jamming.\n\nBut just to be safe, we're going to start our vocal warm-ups now.\n\n(E! and Peacock are both part of the NBCUniversal family.)"
