        "text": "In 2012, Pitch Perfect was released, a musical comedy somewhat out of the ordinary, as it told the story of a group of college girls trying to win an a cappella choir contest. The Barden Bellas knew how to conquer the audience with their beautiful voices, the peculiar way of mashing up one song with another, and maintaining a rhythm that was as catchy as it was entertaining.\n\nThe Bright Side team has watched this movie so many times that we thought it was a good idea to check what the stars were up to 10 years after its premiere.\n\n1. Anna Kendrick — Beca Mitchell\n\nIn the film, Anna Kendrick was able to demonstrate her fantastic singing skills, enchanting the audience with her sweet voice.

Elizabeth Banks — Gail Abernath McKadden\n\nElizabeth Banks not only appeared in this film, but she also debuted as a film director in the second installment of this saga.
