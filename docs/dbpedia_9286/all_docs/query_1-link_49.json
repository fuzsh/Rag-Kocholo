        "text": "When, in 1809, Polish Napoleonic troops from the Duchy of Warsaw arrived in Lemberg, major street celebrations were staged and many among the local inhabit- ants were reported to have welcomed the troops’ arrival. Lemberg had fallen to Austria with the first partition of Poland in 1772 and – despite obvious improvement in many areas – the following decades witnessed strong resentment against the sweeping reforms, which were seen by many as attempts of «Germanization». The degree of the popular street celebrations shocked the functionaries of the local administration to such an extent that they never learned to trust the city’s inhabitants fully after the events of 1809. Yet the Polish triumph was short-lived: the city was occupied by Russian troops and re-captured by the Austrian army the same year. The arrival of the Austrian army was treated with appropriate pomp and was accompanied by a variety of street events and celebrations. Although explicit anti-Habsburg statements were expressed by parts of the local population, the majority of the local inhabitants had actually wished for the Austrians to return. Drawing on recent research into the events of 1809 that contradicts earlier historiographic interpretations, this paper calls for a critical re-evaluation of these events and their historical significance. In fact, profound similarities between the 1809 Polish and Austrian celebrations point to the existence of certain local urban traditions, accompanied by a particular configuration of the street ceremony, the origins of which date back to the Middle Ages. In this tradition, every significant guest is given a statement of the city’s loyalty, while the average city dweller remained a passive observer of the street spectacle; and yet, the strong Galician civic identity was already in place.\n\nEast and east central European cities are a neglected field of research in urban history. While a certain number of publications exist on select urban phenomena such as urban Jewry, only recently have attempts been made to focus research on entire cities. Studies published in the last decade have tried to discover the unknown urban world of multiethnic societies in countries such as Russia, Poland, Ukraine, and the Baltic states. Researchers must cope with specific problems. General city histories are very rare, with the exception of several “city biographies” dating from the 1920s and 1930s. Archival sources are rather poorly documented in inventories, and holdings (especially on the territory of the former Soviet Union) suffered wartime losses and are often scattered. Multilingual skills and knowledge of “exotic” languages such as Ukrainian, Lithuanian, or Yiddish are mandatory. And finally, the usual approaches do not lead to satisfactory results. “Traditional” urban history deal...\n\nWhen Austria annexed Galicia during the first partition of Poland in 1772, the province's capital, Lemberg, was a decaying Baroque town. By the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Lemberg had become a booming city with a modern urban and, at the same time, distinctly Habsburg flavor. In the process of the \"long\" nineteenth century, both Lemberg's appearance and the use of public space changed remarkably. The city center was transformed into a showcase of modernity and a site of conflicting symbolic representations, while other areas were left decrepit, overcrowded, and neglected. Habsburg Lemberg: Architecture, Public Space, and Politics in the Galician Capital, 1772–1914 reveals that behind a variety of national and positivist historical narratives of Lemberg and of its architecture, there always existed a city that was labeled cosmopolitan yet provincial; and a Vienna, but still of the East. Buildings, streets, parks, and monuments became part and parcel of a complex set of culturally driven politics.\n\nCenter and periphery are popular concepts to describe geographical, political, or economic power relations. Both are mostly perceived as strict and mutually exclusive categories. This article examines a Galician border town whose history illustrates the complexities of conceptualizing center and periphery relations. At first glance, nineteenth-century Brody (in today's Ukraine) would seem to qualify as a peripheral town located on the Galician border between the Austro-Hungarian and Russian Empires. An analysis of this city under Habsburg rule (1772–1918), however, shows us that during that period it constituted both an important center and a declining periphery, not only consecutively, but also simultaneously. Its situation on the country's physical and political periphery did not harm Brody's central role in Europe's East-West trade until the first twenty years of the nineteenth century. Only in later decades did the city lose its place within a modernizing commercial system, and eventually it declined in importance. If we leave aside the economic aspect and take a closer look at Brody's mostly Jewish inhabitants, we see that for centuries this city functioned as an important center for Eastern and Central European Jewry. Even though the town's centrality for Jewish history also changed over time, Brody nevertheless kept its place on Jewish mental maps, whether as a center of religious learning, as a pioneering site of political emancipation, or as a safe haven for Jewish refugees."
