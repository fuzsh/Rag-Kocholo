        "text": "Originalaufnahme des KÃ¶nigreiches Galizien und Lodomerien\n\n1st military survey of Galicia (Josephine land survey of Galicia) or the so called âMieg mapâ\n\nScale of 1 : 28 800\n\nWar Archives in Vienna (Kriegsarchiv), file ref. no. B IXa 390\n\nIt is a complete, large scale map of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, which was in preparation since 1775 and was completed in the years 1779â1783 by the efforts of the Austrian Staff of the General Quartermaster. In the Polish literature it is customarily called the âMieg mapâ, after the name of the Staff officer who lead the majority of works, Friedrich von Mieg. Initially kept secret, due to its military significance, it was never edited and remains in the manuscript to the present day.\n\nIt consists of 413 large scale sheets (basic size: 24Ã16 inches, i. e. ca. 63Ã42 cm) and of several dozen additional sheets with a total surface of ca. 115 square meters. It is preserved in three full copies (the original, the fair drafting or the first copy, the second copy). The map is generally in a good condition, but here and there we find sheets more heavily worn.\n\nThe map was created as a part of the so called Josephine land survey, a great cartographic project which included lands under the Habsburg rule.\n\nText material\n\nThe map is accompanied by six volumes in folio containing landscape descriptions and a commentary which complements the situation depicted on each particular sheet of the map. It is also supplemented by a volume containing the topometric calculations and a list of places with a separate list of name corrections. Volumes containing descriptions are well preserved.\n\nBasic bibliography\n\nJosef Paldus, Die Einverleibung Galiziens und der Bukowina in die Ã¶sterreichische Monarchie im Jahre 1772, in: âMitteilungen der k. k.

Rocznik Historyczno-Geograficznyâ, vol. 1, 2013, p. 91â112\n\nopen open\n\nBook editions\n\nDue to the importance of the Josephine maps as monuments of the European cartography and a valuable historical source material, a demand has been declared in many lands for publishing these manuscripts in the form of facsimiles of maps and a critical edition of the descriptive part.\n\nIn the sixties of the 20th century began the publishing of a multi-volume edition of the map of the Austrian Low Countries (Carte de Cabinet de Pays-Bas autrichiens levÃ©e Ã l'initiative du comte de Ferraris, 12 volumes of maps, 12 volumes of descriptions, Bruxelles 1965â1974; new edition, cf. De grote atlas van Ferraris: de eerste atlas van BelgiÃ«: Kabinetskaart van de Oostenrijkse Nederlanden en het Prinsbisdom Luik, 1777. Le grand atlas de Ferraris: le premier atlas de la Belgique: carte de Cabinet des Pays-Bas autrichiens et de la PrincipautÃ© de LiÃ¨ge, 1777, ed. Wouter Bracke, Brussel 2009, 2011).\n\nSince the 90s of the 20th century, big editorial initiatives started in Slovenia and Croatia, all under the aegis of the government and the national agencies of the academies of sciences, also in Hungary and Italy. Currently completed is the facsimile edition of the Josephine map of Slovenia (Slovenija na vojaÅ¡kem zemljevidu 1763â1787 | Josephinische Landesaufnahme 1763â1787 fÃ¼r das Gebiet der Republik Slowenien, ed. Vincenc RajÅ¡p [et al.], vol. 1â7, Ljubljana 1995â2001), advanced are the works on the Croatian project (Hrvatska na tajnim zemljovidima 18. i 19. stoljeÄa, ed. Mirko ValentiÄ [et al.], planned are 20 volumes, presently ready are 12 volumes, Zagreb 1999â2009), printed is also the map of the Duchy of Venetia (Kriegskarte 1798â1805: il Ducato di Venezia nella carta di Anton von Zach | Das Herzogtum Venedig auf der Karte Antons von Zach, ed. Massimo Rossi, vol. 1â3, Treviso 2005).\n\nMoreover, apart from the complete editions, several selected sheets were published in Slovenia, together with descriptions: BohuÅ¡ Klein, VÃ½znamnÃ© mestÃ¡ Slovenska na tajnÃ½ch mapÃ¡ch 18. storoÄia, Bratislava 2003. The map of the present territory of Slovakia is nevertheless contained in the Hungarian edition. Presented in Ukraine were only small fragments, in a quality worse than the original: Halyna P. PetryÅ¡yn, Karta F. fon Miga (1779â1782 rr.) jak dÅ¾erelo do mistoznavstva HalyÄyny, LÊ¹viv 2006.\n\nDescriptions\n\nDescriptions, which are a textual commentary to the geographic contents of the map sheets, bring additional information: they provide the characteristics of particular places, their location, their defensive possibilities. Listed are âsolidâ, i. e. masonry buildings (usually churches, monasteries, castles, palaces and fortifications), assessed are the accommodation options, discussed is the state and the kind of forestry and meadows, pastures and marshes, the hydrographic situation, access to drinking water. Pictured is the state of roads and ferries under various weather conditions, assessed their practicability, often with instructions on how to mend a cumbersome stretch of a route or a bad bridge. Finally, described are the features of the local landscape: usually mentioned are mountains and hills, in particular the dominating ones, which could had been useful as observation points or landmarks or for firing positions. Sometimes the descriptions are accompanied by observations and recommendations on how to use the local field conditions in tactical actions.\n\nKnowledge about the map\n\nThe Josephine map o Galicia, secretive and unknown from the beginning (the existence of the descriptions was made public as late as 1864), was for a long time available only to a narrow circle of people authorized by the emperor. The first public presentation which definitely broke the time of its concealment took place at the world exhibition in Vienna in 1873. An early example (at the turn of the 19th and 20th century) of using the map in scientific research (and at the same time in a lawsuit) are the works of a LwÃ³w historian Aleksander CzoÅowski (1865â1944) and Oswald Balzer (1858â1933): the research was prepared in connection with the border conflict over the Morskie Oko Lake, which flared up harder since 1890 between Galicia and Hungary.\n\nThe map received its first monographic study due to the research of Josef Paldus (1863â1937), a colonel of the Austro-Hungarian army, who was the leader of the Cartography Department of the War Archives during the years of the 1st World War and later a Czech representative at these Archives. Concurrently, in the years 1919â1920, active in the Vienna Archives was Ludomir Sawicki (1884â1928), professor of geography at the Jagiellonian University. He ran extensive queries on behalf of the Polish Liquidation Committee, which was to assess under the treaty of St. Germain the Polish claims regarding the restitution of the cultural and scientific goods from the former Austro-Hungarian monarchy. At that time L. Sawicki made a list of maps regarding the Polish lands and placed the information on this particular map in a catalogue published in 1920.\n\nThe map was not covered by the recovery action but the knowledge on its importance and its scientific significance began to spread. Ordered was the making of black-and-white reproductions for the National Library in Warsaw, further copies were also made for the Cracow Commission of the Historical Atlas of Poland. Since that time fragments of the map began to be used in works of many fields as duplicates of a quality much inferior to the original. The descriptions remained entirely unknown.\n\nPossible ways of using\n\nThe Josephine map is of particular usefulness for the historical research (history of settlement, urban history, historical geography, atlas works, research on road network, river crossings, mountain passes through the Carpathians), the archaeological research (terrain prospection; the map gives the old range of the floodplains, registers the remains of the historical objects which often are no longer visible on the surface today), the research on urban planning (captured are the spatial layouts of the towns), the onomastic research (it contains a huge amount of topographic and micro-topographic names, âfieldâ names, the names of rivers and mountains), the regional studies, the local research on the past of the cities and the villages. It presents great scientific value also for other disciplines (earth sciences â morphology of the village, ecological studies, research on the changes of the natural environment; the map gives a detailed record of the hydrographic relations of that time, the oldest reliable picture of afforestation; occasionally it was used e.g. in the reconstruction of the court park complexes). As an exceptionally beautiful cartographic monument and an outstanding achievement in this field it is an object of interest for geographers and historians of cartography on itself."
