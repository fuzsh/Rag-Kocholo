        "text": "The article presents types of sources which have thus far not been used, castle court books kept in the archives of the Ukrainian cities of Lviv and Kyiv. The author emphasizes the importance of these sources for research on the history and culture of Polish Jews in the 17th and 18th centuries. He also specifies the types of documents related to Jewish issues authenticated in these books (e.g. manifestations and lawsuits, declarations of the Radom Tribunal), as well as current source publications and internet databases containing selected documents from Ukrainian archives.\n\nThe 27th volume of the international series Jews and Slavs, entitled Jewish-Slavic Cultural Horizons: Essays on Jewish History and Art in Slavic Lands, dwells on the political, cultural, literary, and artistic interaction between Jews and Slavic peoples from the Middle Ages to the World War II aftermath. The volume accomplishes a joint cooperative project of The Center for Slavic Languages and Literature of the Hebrew University, The Center for Jewish Art of the same university, and The Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Ljubljana. The publication contains 21 articles dedicated to the history, ethnicity, culture, literature, theatre, fine arts, architecture, heritage and memory thematically grouped in nine sections.

Lewin (1868–1941) was a rabbi and Jewish historian in Poland between the Wars and a proponent of the Wissenschaft des Judentums, “Science of Judaism,” movement in Jewish scholarship. The documents Lewin collected are of great historical value for their description of Jewish life in Europe, the history of Judaism, and Hebrew language and literature. While some records are original documents, others were copied by hand by Lewin from non-Jewish repositories in state or municipal archives. Not only are these documents precious for their historical value, but they are unique survivors of the devastation of World War II. Most of the records of these communities in Poland and Germany were obliterated, and the communities themselves disappeared. All that now exists are the copies that Louis Lewin p..."
