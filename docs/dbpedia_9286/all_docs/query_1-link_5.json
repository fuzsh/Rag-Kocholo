Lviv serves as the administrative center of both the Lviv Oblast and the Lviv Raion, as well as one of the principal cultural centers of Ukraine. The city’s historic center, which features many old buildings and cobblestone streets, has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. In February 2022, in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the city of Lviv has been declared the country’s de facto western capital.\n\nGeography Of Lviv\n\nThe city of Lviv is situated on the tip of the Roztochia Upland at an average elevation of 296m above sea level.

These include Franko district, Halych district, Lychakiv district, Shevchenko district, Sykhiv district, and Zaliznytsia district. Some of the notable suburbs of Lviv include Briukhovychi, Rudne, and Vynnyky. It is believed in earlier times, the old walled city was located on the banks of the Poltva River at the base of the High Castle. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Poltva River was redirected through the main sewer of the city and currently flows underneath the city’s central street, Freedom Avenue, and the Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet.\n\nClimate\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification, the city of Lviv experiences a humid continental climate with warm summers and freezing snowy winters.

The city’s population grew only till 2007 but declined after that as the number of males started declining faster than the number of females.

It has also been recorded that the natural population growth of the city has been negative over the last few years.\n\nThe city of Lviv is considered Western Ukraine’s most vital business center.

Some of the notable parks in Lviv include Ivan Franko Park, Stryiskyi Park, Znesinnya Park, etc.\n\nBrief History Of Lviv\n\nArchaeological studies have revealed that the present Lviv area was initially inhabited by several tribes, including White Croats and the Lendians. In 1250, the city was founded by King Daniel Romanovich of Galicia of the Principality of Halych. The city was named “Lviv” in honor of Leo I of Galicia – the King’s eldest son. The first record about the city dates back to 1256 when it was first mentioned in the Halych-Volhynian Chronicle. From 1272 to 1349, the city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia. After 1349, the city was captured by Casimir III, the Great King of Poland. From 1434 onwards, the city served as the regional capital of the Ruthenian Voivodeship in the Kingdom of Poland. However, after the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the city of Lviv became the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria under the Habsburg Monarchy. With the end of the First World War and the collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy, the city of Lviv then served as the capital of the Western Ukrainian People’s republic for a short time. During the interwar period, Lviv (Lwow) was considered the third most populous city and served as the administrative center of the Lwow Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic.\n\nOn September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and till September 14, the city of Lviv remained entirely encircled by the German forces. On September 17, 1939, Poland was invaded by the Soviet Union, and eventually, the entire eastern portion of the Second Polish Republic was annexed by the USSR. The city of Lviv then became the capital of the Lviv Oblast. After the end of the Second World War, there was a population exchange between Soviet Ukraine and Poland from 1944 to 1946. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Lviv became a part of Ukraine.\n\nCurrent Situation In Lviv"
