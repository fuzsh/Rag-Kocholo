        "text": "It would be nice to have another “faction” to depict Eastern Europe factions.\n\nTechnically this “faction” does transit from Varangians to Cossacks.\n\nChapter 1. Short info\n\nRed Ruthenia / Chervonaya Rus is the name used since early medieval times to refer to the area between today’s Poland and Ukraine. The region was part of Kievan Rus’ (882–1240) and, from 1199 to 1772 different independent Kingdoms. While its people did maintain their own culture and identity, the Region did frequently participate and rebel in the wars of Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Mongols and Tatars.\n\nCentred on Przemyśl (Peremyshl) and Belz, it has included major cities such as: Chełm, Zamość, Rzeszów, Krosno and Sanok (now all in Poland), as well as Lviv and Ternopil (in Ukraine).\n\nSource 1\n\nSource 2\n\n[Source ########################################################## Source 4\n\nChapter 2 Music Concept\n\nChapter 3 Coat of arms featured frequently a golden lion\n\nChapter 4. Short Region History\n\n—Cherven Grods often literally translated as Red Cities, Red Forts or Red Boroughs, was a point of dispute between the Kingdom of Poland and Kievan Rus’ at the turn of 10th and 11th centuries\n\nSource\n\n—Independent Rus principality and successor state (1199–1246)\n\n—Principality of Galicia–Volhynia (1199–1253)\n\n—Kingdom of Ruthenia (1253–1349)\n\n—Galicia–Volhynia Wars. From 1340 to 1392 the civil war in the region transitioned into a power struggle between Lithuania, Poland, and Hungary.\n\n— Ruthenian Voivodeship Established 1434 / Disestablished 1772\n\nRuthenia was subject to repeated Tatar and Ottoman Empire incursions during the 16th and 17th centuries and was impacted by the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648–1654)\n\nChapter 5 Unique Faction Traits?\n\nWell historically they had to build a lot of Stone Castles to defend themselves from invasions, were more farmers than hunters, while Varangians and Cossacks were more mercenaries and raiders, than warriors and soldiers.\n\nAges more adjusted to their history?\n\nDark Age, the Feudal Age, the Castle Age,\n\nfor Imperial divide it into the Incursions Age and the Uprising Age\n\n—Dark Age:\n\nUnit Varangian Raider, with bonus damage against buildings and can loot buildings like mongols.\n\n—Feudal Age\n\nCan harvest fields 25% faster, but they do get depleted after time.\n\n—Castle Age\n\nCan generate Pigs for meat, like Mongols can generate sheep.\n\n—Incursions Age\n\nBuild stone Walls and Castles gets cheaper.\n\n—Uprising Age: get Access to Cossacks and Gun Powder\n\nFoot Cossacks were called Serdyuk, Armed with a musket. Gun Powder Unit\n\nSich Cossack faster light horseman armed with a saber, but almost no armour.\n\nChapter 6 Landmarks and research? Maybe a different Mechanic to Age and Tech up?\n\nthere are for example Varangian runestones\n\nSo why not build several smaller “landmarks” to unlock new tech?\n\nLike Build Rune Stones to get better armour."
