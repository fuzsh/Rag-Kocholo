        "text": "Data-inspired MURaM Simulations of Flares Resulting from Sunspot Collisions\n\nMatthias Rempel, Yuhong Fan, Anna Malanushenko (HAO), Georgios Chintzoglou, Mark Cheung (Lockheed/LMSAL), MURaM GPU team (CISL, University of Delaware, & Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research)\n\nMajor solar eruptions often originate from complex active regions, specifically in active regions that are composed of several bipolar spot groups that interact with each other. AR 11158 (Feb 2011) is a well-studied example in which two opposite polarities collide and form a flare productive collisional polarity inversion line (cPIL). We propose a data inspired simulation of AR 11158 with the MURaM radiative MHD code in which the observed spot motions will be imposed at the lower sub-photospheric boundary condition. Synthetic observables covering visible to EUV observations will be computed and compared to the available observations from NASA/SDO. The investigation will focus on connecting changes in the magnetic topology prior to flares to available observables, specifically constraining the build-up and release of magnetic energy. Unlike earlier MURaM simulations, this simulation aims for the first time at reproducing processes in a specific observed active region through data-constrained boundary driving.\n\nUrban Air Quality Across the Globe with MUSICA\n\nLouisa Emmons (ACOM), Simone Tilmes, Gabriele Pfister, Rebecca Buchholz, Duesong Jo, Wenfu Tang, & David Edwards (ACOM); Behrooz Roozitalab (University of Iowa)\n\nAir quality is primarily driven by local anthropogenic emissions sources, but it can also be strongly influenced by long-range transport of pollutants and regional influences (natural emissions, chemistry, meteorology, climate). In turn, local air quality can have impacts that extend all the way to the global scale. Global models including CESM2(CAM-chem) with comprehensive chemistry in the troposphere and stratosphere usually perform well in reproducing distributions of important air pollutants, including those of ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5). However, over highly polluted urban regions the model’s coarse horizontal resolution is often unable to capture local peak emissions of specific precursors for ozone. So far however, global models are not able to increase the horizontal resolution sufficiently because of needed large computer resources for transporting 200-300 chemical tracers. MUSICAv0, a configuration of CESM2.2(CAM-chem) with variable resolution, now has the unique capability to simultaneously simulate urban-scale air quality with high horizontal resolution and regional-to-hemispheric-to global influences and impacts of pollutants, while still using an expensive chemistry and aerosol scheme.\n\nThis project will perform simulations of MUSICAv0 with a custom variable resolution mesh with 3 refined regions of special interest targeting the United States, Europe and southern and eastern Asia. Our plan is to use a base resolution of ne60 (0.5 degree), zooming into ne240 (~1/8 degree) resolution over the 3 regions. Using this unique setup will allow us to better quantify the impact of urban pollution simultaneously on local, regional and hemispheric scales.\n\nDeep Learning-based Large Ensemble for Subseasonal Prediction of Global Precipitation\n\nLead: Maria J. Molina (CGD), Co-Lead: Katie Dagon (CGD); Collaborators: Jadwiga Richter (CGD), David John Gagne (CISL), Gerald Meehl (CGD), Kirsten Mayer (CGD), Judith Berner (MMM/CGD), John Schreck (CISL), William Chapman (ASP), Aixue Hu (CGD), Anne Glanville (CGD), and Abby Jaye (MMM)\n\nEvery year, extreme precipitation and drought disrupt life, destroy infrastructure, and result in fatalities across the United States and the world. Skillful precipitation forecasts with a lead time of several weeks (i.e., subseasonal) can help stakeholders of societally-relevant public sectors (e.g., water management, agriculture, and health) understand imminent threats and take protective actions to mitigate harm. Our proposal aims to improve subseasonal prediction of precipitation using a data-driven, deep learning approach. With capabilities provided by Derecho, and as part of the Accelerated Scientific Discovery opportunity, we will use a data-driven, deep learning approach to create a 100-member ensemble of subseasonal forecasts of global precipitation. We will leverage deep learning approaches with observational and reanalysis products to improve already existing subseasonal reforecasts created using the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). Motivating our large ensemble approach is that an ensemble mean of subseasonal precipitation prediction can yield more skill than individual forecasts, but the large computational cost of simulating global numerical model subseasonal hindcasts precludes its creation. Moreover, recent studies have shown that deep learning models can produce subseasonal-to-multiyear forecasts with skill that exceeds current dynamical forecasting systems, making this an ideal time to take advantage of the unique opportunity that the Accelerated Scientific Discovery program presents.\n\nHigh-resolution Simulations of Wildland Fires and Long-Range Smoke Transport During the 2020 August Complex Fires in California\n\nTimothy Juliano, Masih Eghdami, Rajesh Kumar, & Branko Kosović (RAL); Gabriele Pfister & Rebecca Buchholz (ACOM); Hamed Ebrahimian & Kasra Shamsaei (University of Nevada)\n\nWildfires are some of the most destructive natural disasters on Earth, many times leading to devastating effects. There is no doubt that wildland fire activity in the United States (U.S.) and across the world has increased significantly over recent decades, and is projected to increase in forthcoming years. Currently, for air quality and solar energy forecasts, the fire emissions are estimated based on satellite observations that lag behind the actual emissions and therefore may not accurately represent the wildfire evolution. In light of this scientific gap in knowledge, we will use a multiphysics modeling approach and focus on improving air quality forecasts during the 2020 U.S. wildfire season. A very intense period of wildfire activity plagued a large portion of the U.S. in August and September 2020.\n\nWe propose to conduct coupled simulations using a multiscale (i.e., spanning the mesoscale and microscale) approach. The WRF-Fire wildfire-atmosphere modeling system will simulate fire behavior at fine resolution. While the proposal team has extensive experience using the WRF-Fire model, we have been limited computationally to conducting relatively small domain (order 10s of km) simulations at large-eddy simulation (LES) resolutions. However, during large conflagrations, such as the 2020 August Complex, much larger LES domains are required to accurately capture the wildfire spread and smoke production and transport. We will then use the biomass burning results from WRF-Fire to inform WRF-Chem and the MUlti-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols (MUSICA) configuration of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), both of which contain complex chemical processes. Such hierarchical multiscale and multiphysics simulations will advance predictive science in support of air quality management and enhance warning systems protecting human health.\n\nNonlinear Multiscale Coupled Data Assimilation: Designing the Future of Air Quality Forecasting\n\nB. Gaubert, W. Tang, F. Lacey, L. K. Emmons, S. Tilmes, M. Dawson, M. Barth, & G. Pfister (ACOM); K. Raeder, M. Gharamti, & J. L. Anderson (CISL); A. Arellano (University of Arizona)\n\nThis project is designated as an alternate and will be elevated in the event that other projects failed to make progress.\n\nApplying concurrent data assimilation of chemical and physical observations in coupled chemistry meteorology models is often overlooked because of computational limitations. Unstructured grids with regional refinements have never been explored in chemical Data Assimilation (DA). This project aims to apply ensemble DA to an global online coupled chemistry-meteorology variable-resolution model. We will assess how improving the dynamics and physics via higher resolution impacts the chemical surface fluxes and state of the atmosphere. We will explore ensemble representations of physical and chemical uncertainties to disentangle errors stemming from emissions, transport and chemistry. The system is built on the coupling between the Multi-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols (MUSICA) and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART).\n\nIt uses the spectral element (SE) dynamical core of Community Atmosphere Model with full chemistry (CAM-chem) with horizontal mesh refinement defining a Regionally Refined (RR) domain, denoted as CAM-chem-SE-RR. The global grid has a resolution of ne30 (∼111 km) and the refinements reach ne240 (30×8, or ∼14 km) over the conterminous United States. The first objective is to assess the performance of the meteorological data assimilation and its comparison to current specified dynamics approaches. The second objective is to evaluate the impact of spatial resolution on initial state optimization and fluxes inversion of carbon monoxide (CO). The set of chemical data assimilation experiments will focus on the assimilation of CO from the TROPOMI instrument.\n\nExtreme Weather Events Under a Wide Range of Climates in High-Resolution Coupled CESM\n\nBette Otto-Bliesner (CGD), Jiang Zhu (CGD), Esther Brady (CGD), Jesse Nusbaumer (CGD), Chijun Sun (ASP), Jessica Tierney (University of Arizona), Ran Feng (University of Connecticut), Clay Tabor (University of Connecticut), Andrew Walters (University of Arizona)\n\nWe propose an unprecedented, landmark set of fully coupled high-resolution (HR) climate simulations for past greenhouse and icehouse climates to study the dynamics that govern the characteristics of extreme weather events in both atmosphere and ocean under altered climate states. We target well-studied paleoclimate intervals with higher and lower atmospheric CO2, including the preindustrial, the Last Glacial Maximum, the Pliocene, and the Early Eocene. We employ scientifically validated and extensively tested CESM code and configuration, the iHESP (International Laboratory for High-Resolution Earth System Prediction) HR CESM1.3 (~0.25° atmosphere/land and ~0.1° ocean/sea ice) with water isotopes. The unique water isotope capability enables unprecedented integration of information from model and paleoclimate observational data. The paleo-HR simulations will complement the preindustrial, historical and RCP8.5 future simulations available from the iHESP project, resulting in HR simulations to investigate the dynamics that connect past and future climate changes. The proposed work will greatly expand our fundamental understanding of how elevated CO2 levels affect the pattern and intensity of extreme weather events, thus contributing to future projections of climate change and the physical science basis for actionable policies.\n\nBenchmark Simulations Using a Lagrangian Microphysics Scheme to Study Cloud-Turbulence interactions: from Direct Numerical Simulations of a Laboratory Cloud Chamber to High-Resolution Large-Eddy Simulations of Clouds\n\nHugh Morrison (MMM), Kamal Kant Chandrakar (MMM), Wojciech W. Grabowski (MMM), George H. Bryan (MMM), Lulin Xue (RAL), Sisi Chen (RAL), Raymond A. Shaw (Michigan Technological University), and Greg McFarquhar (University of Oklahoma)\n\nClouds involve an enormous range of scales from the ~1 mm dissipation microscale to synoptic scales. Accurate representation of clouds in atmospheric models across these scales poses a significant challenge and is a critical source of uncertainty in weather and climate models. Our high-resolution simulations on Derecho will use a novel approach to simulating cloud/rain droplets and lead to better understanding of multi-scale processes in clouds. They can serve as benchmarks for developing and testing “traditional” cloud parameterizations in weather and climate models. These datasets can also be used to train artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for parameterization development.\n\nThe proposed simulations will utilize a Lagrangian particle-based microphysics scheme called the “super-droplet method” (SDM). SDM provides a major advancement for representing cloud microphysics in models compared to traditional bin and bulk microphysics schemes. For example, it is free from numerical diffusion, unlike bin schemes. SDM is available in NCAR’s CM1 model and runs efficiently on other supercomputing systems. The CM1-SDM framework was successfully applied to study the effects of turbulence and entrainment on cloud droplet size distributions. We will use three related model configurations in a hierarchical approach from direct numerical simulation (DNS) of small-scale turbulence to cloud-scale and mesoscale dynamics using large eddy simulation (LES).\n\nGlobal Convection-Permitting Simulations with GPU-MPAS\n\nFalko Judt (MMM), Andreas Prein (MMM), Bill Skamarock (MMM), Supreeth Suresh (CISL), Roy Rasmussen (RAL), Tim Schneider (RAL)\n\nWe will produce a series of global convection-permitting simulations using GPU-MPAS. Our main goal is to assess the “added value” of convection-permitting resolution in (1) simulating structure and life cycle of mesoscale convective systems across different climate zones, (2) capturing the diurnal cycle and the duration, frequency, & intermittency of precipitation, (3) predicting extreme weather from local to global scales, and (4) representing orographic precipitation. Our secondary goal is to better understand the dynamics of tropical convection, and the predictability of the atmosphere in different climate zones.\n\nWe will simulate 4 pairs of 40-day long simulations on a globally quasi-uniform 3.75-km mesh, where one pair consists of a control run and a stochastically perturbed run. The number of simulation days on the 3.75-km mesh will be 4*2*40 = 320 (i.e., almost one year of global 3.75-km resolution data). In addition, there will be 15 km, 30 km, and 120 km mesh counterparts (again 4 pairs à 40 days) for added value assessments. These simulations will be identical to the 3.75-km runs except with reduced horizontal resolution.\n\nThe four 40-day long simulations will include the following time periods/events: April 2011, simulating the super Outbreak, the largest, costliest, and one of the deadliest tornado outbreaks ever recorded; August/September 2017, simulating Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria; December 2018–January 2019, simulating a Madden-Julian oscillation event initiated in the Indian Ocean and propagated across the Maritime Continent into the western Pacific; June/July 2021, simulating a series of record shattering extreme events that happened within a 4-week period in early summer 2021."
