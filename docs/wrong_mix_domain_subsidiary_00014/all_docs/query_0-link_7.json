        "text": "NEW CRAY RESEARCH SUPERSERVERS COMBINE STRONG\n\nPRICE-PERFORMANCE, RAS FEATURES, LARGE NUMBER OF\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR COMMERCIAL AND TECHNICAL DATA\n\nCENTERS\n\nWith up To 64 Processors, CS6400 Products Are World’s\n\nFastest SPARC/Solaris Systems\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 25, 1993 — Cray Research Superservers\n\n(CRS), the Ore.-based subsidiary of Cray Research, Inc.\n\n(NYSE:CYR), today announced a new Superserver product line.\n\nMartin Buchanan, general manager of CRS, said the new CRAY\n\nSUPERSERVER 6400 (CS6400) systems, with up to 64\n\nprocessors, are the world’s fastest and most expandable\n\nSPARC/Solaris-compliant systems.\n\n“Our’s are the first high-end servers to combine the strong\n\nprice-performance of Sun products with the reliability,\n\navailability and serviceability (RAS) features data center\n\nmanagers expect,” Buchanan said.\n\n“The CS6400 products are enterprise servers aimed at the\n\nrightsizing’ market, especially commercial and technical data\n\ncenters concerned about the high cost of upgrading and running\n\nmainframe systems,” he said. The products were developed by\n\nCRS under a Jan. 1992 technology agreement between Cray\n\nResearch and Sun Microsystems, Inc., Mountain View, Calif.,\n\nand are a binary-compatible upward extension of Sun’s product\n\nline.\n\n“The SPARC architecture is a powerful foundation for cost-\n\neffective scalability,” said Scott McNealy, Sun chairman and\n\nchief executive officer. “The Sun and CRS product lines will\n\nform a price-performance continuum from SPARCclassics to\n\nSPARCcenter servers to the new CS6400 products. Sun users\n\nwho require more power on the network can move to the binary-\n\ncompatible CS6400 systems with no migration problems.” The\n\nCS6400 systems run the current version of Sun’s Solaris\n\noperating environment, which is an implementation of UNIX\n\nSystem V Release 4, he said. “Any program that runs on a Sun\n\nsystem will run on the new CRS systems without modification,\n\nand vice versa.”\n\n“With the CS6400, CRS will address commercial markets with\n\nnon-traditional Cray applications,” said Lester Davis, Cray\n\nResearch chief operating officer. “That’s why CRS is\n\norganized as a separate business unit with its own hardware\n\nand software development capabilities. Martin Buchanan has\n\nassembled a strong marketing and sales team with many years\n\nof experience selling into commercial markets, as well as into\n\nthe technical computing arena. We’re confident that the\n\nenterprise server market is ready to move to Cray Research\n\nadded value, especially when this is available on the same\n\nprice-performance curve as Sun products.”\n\nBuchanan said CS6400 systems are expandable and can scale\n\nwith customers’ data processing needs. The systems are\n\noffered with four to 64 SuperSPARC RISC microprocessors\n\n(initially at 60 MHz), 256 megabytes (million bytes) to 16\n\ngigabytes (billion bytes) of central memory, 1.3 gigabytes per\n\nsecond peak memory bandwidth, and more than two terabytes\n\n(trillion bytes) of online disk storage. U.S. pricing begins at\n\nunder $400,000 for the four-processor version, and at $2.5\n\nmillion for the top-of-the-line 64-processor system. He said\n\nCRS expects to sell hundreds of the new systems.\n\nInitial shipments of the new systems will begin in late 1993,\n\nBuchanan said. Volume shipments are scheduled to begin in\n\nfirst-quarter 1994. CRS is working with customers and\n\nprospects in the traditional Sun and Cray Research markets, as\n\nwell as new markets. CRS is in negotiations with several\n\norganizations in the electronic computer-aided design (ECAD),\n\ntransportation/distribution, manufacturing, university and\n\nelectric utility markets and will announce these customers\n\nwhen order agreements are signed, Buchanan said. Separately\n\ntoday, CRS announced that SICAN, a leading German\n\nmicroelectronics firm, has ordered a CS6400 system. SICAN is\n\nscheduled to receive a 48-processor system by mid-1994.\n\nAccording to Buchanan, the large number of applications\n\navailable on SPARC/Solaris systems was an important\n\nattraction for CRS. “We are leveraging SPARC’s leadership in\n\nthe RISC market through binary compatibility with Sun’s\n\nproduct line. As we work with independent software vendors\n\nto have their products supported, technical ports are not an\n\nissue.” Buchanan cited a 1992 International Data Corporation\n\nstudy showing SPARC with a 57 percent marketshare for the\n\nUNIX RISC market.\n\nBuchanan said CRS is in discussions with several major\n\ndevelopers of key software packages and connectivity\n\nproducts, including relational database management systems\n\n(RDBMS), transaction processing monitors, fourth generation\n\nlanguages, computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools,\n\nreport generation packages, hierarchical storage management\n\n(HSM) solutions and mainframe connectivity tools. He said CRS\n\nrecently benchmarked Oracle, the most popular database\n\nserver, on an early version CS6400 system.\n\n“On the benchmark, which simulated 500 users accessing,\n\nupdating and querying data, the CS6400 performed comparable\n\nto a mid-range mainframe system, which would cost more than\n\n$5 million, five times that of the 16-processor CS6400\n\nsystem benchmarked,” said Darshan Karki, president of\n\nSuperSolutions Corp., Minneapolis, a firm that re-engineers\n\nenterprise-wide applications and system software and\n\nassisted CRS with the recent Oracle benchmark.\n\nInitial target markets for the new systems are: ECAD,\n\nfinancial service and investment banking, general engineering,\n\ngovernment, petroleum, and telecommunications. According to\n\nA.J. Berkeley, CRS senior director of sales and marketing, CRS\n\nwill market and sell the new products through its own\n\ndedicated international sales force, the Cray Research sales\n\nforce, a global network of systems integrators and value-\n\nadded resellers (VARs), and joint initiatives with Sun. “Sun\n\nhas been extremely helpful in pointing us toward some of the\n\nright parties and we’ve supplemented this with our own\n\ncontacts. We expect to announce key agreements later this\n\nyear,” he said\n\nAccording to Buchanan, “Our relationship with Sun goes beyond\n\nmerely licensing their technology. We are working closely\n\nwith several Sun business units on interoperability and general\n\nhardware and software engineering for future systems.”\n\nHe said the CS6400 systems bring together Sun hardware and\n\nsoftware technology with Cray Research value-added features\n\nfor high performance and system reliability and serviceability.\n\n“The CS6400 delivers features to the open systems\n\nenvironment that the data center users have enjoyed for\n\nyears,” Buchanan said. “The new system has built-in\n\nreliability, availability and serviceability features — a first\n\nin the high-end, open systems server arena.”\n\nFor example, should a component fail, the system\n\nautomatically reboots, isolates the fault, and reconfigures\n\nitself. Uptime is further maximized with “hot swap”\n\ncapabilities, which allow a failed module to be removed and\n\nreplaced in the system while it’s still running, Buchanan said.\n\nUpgrades can also be done while the system is online. An\n\nindependent service processor performs online and remote\n\ndiagnostics, logging, and monitoring functions and data is\n\nprotected through features such as disk mirroring, page\n\nisolation, and memory scrubbing, he said.\n\n“There are many exciting aspects about CRS and its\n\nSuperserver,” said Jim Johnson, chairman of The Standish\n\nGroup, a market research firm based in South Yarmouth, Mass.\n\n“Most important is the availability of Cray’s high-end\n\ntechnology while following a pricing strategy similar to Sun’s.\n\nThe key data center management products…will give the kind\n\nof performance and quality that mission-critical applications\n\nrequire. The CRS Superserver will have some of the features\n\nthat data center managers take for granted that are not in\n\ntoday’s UNIX servers. These are essential features and people\n\nwill look very favorably on them at the kind of price and\n\nperformance CRS offers.”\n\nBuchanan said Cray Research was the first high-performance\n\ncomputing company to embrace the UNIX standard. “Over the\n\npast decade, Cray Research has substantially enhanced UNICOS,\n\nthe company’s 64-bit symmetric multiprocessing\n\nimplementation of the UNIX operating system. Many key\n\nfeatures of Cray’s supercomputing environment — such as\n\nsophisticated tape management, networked batch processing,\n\nsystems management software, program debugging tools and\n\nhigh-performance compilers — will also be important for\n\ncommercial and technical users of the CS6400 systems and\n\nwill be available in 1994.”\n\nCRS also announced today that:\n\no CRS has signed a memorandum of understanding with Sun\n\nMicrosystems Computer Corporation for SunIntegration\n\nServices to become a reseller of the CS6400 system;\n\no Electricite’ de France, the world’s largest electrical\n\nutility, Clamart, France, will be an early customer for\n\nCRS’ new CS6400 system;\n\no CRS has signed a memorandum of understanding with\n\nOracle to make Oracle7 available on the new CS6400\n\nsystems;\n\no CRS has signed a memorandum of understanding with the\n\nASK Group, developers of the ASK INGRES Intelligent\n\nDatabase system, to make the INGRES database product\n\navailable on the CS6400 system;\n\no INFORMIX-OnLine will be available on the CS6400\n\nsystems;\n\no Sybase, Inc.’s support for Cray Research’s high-end\n\nSPARC/Solaris-compatible strategy;\n\no CRS has signed an agreement with Brixton Systems, Inc.,\n\nCambridge, Mass., to make available on the CS6400\n\nsystem Brixton’s suite of connectivity software, which\n\nlinks IBM mainframes with open systems computers,\n\nenabling data to be shared between these systems;\n\no CRS and Information Management Company (IMC) have\n\nsigned an agreement for IMC to make Open TransPort for\n\nMVS and TUXEDO transaction processing system available\n\non the CS6400 system;\n\no CRS and T-Mass GmbH have signed an agreement for T-\n\nMass to support and distributed UniTree on the CS6400\n\nsystems; and\n\no CRS has signed an agreement with JYACC, Inc. to provide\n\nits JAM Version 6 Application Development Toolset on\n\nthe CS6400.\n\nCRS is dedicated to creating the world’s leading\n\nSPARC/Solaris-compliant computer systems.\n\nCray Research creates the most powerful, highest-quality\n\ncomputational tools for solving the world’s most challenging\n\nscientific and industrial problems.\n\n###"
