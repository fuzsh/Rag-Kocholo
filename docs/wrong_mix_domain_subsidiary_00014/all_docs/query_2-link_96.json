        "text": "Introduction\n\nBy early 1989, it was probably clear to all that CSIRO science research was not going to be well served by PAXUS, with its decision to go to an all IBM-compatible host services. Pressure was probably mounted by the Divisions with large computing needs (e.g. Atmospheric Research), for a replacement system and service for the Cyber 205 and CSIRONET. The CSIRO Policy Committee on Computing managed the policy on CSIRO computing facilities. In 1989, it set up the Supercomputing Facilities Task Force (SFTF), to decide on follow-on facilities from the Cyber 205.\n\nThe ETA options\n\nIn 1989, CSIRO, and in particular the Division of Atmospheric Research, was looking at options to replace the Csironet Cyber 205 (although by then CSIRO had taken over ownership).\n\nCDC had spun off a new company, ETA Systems, to develop a compatible follow-on product from the Cyber 205, producing a range of four systems – ETA-10E ETA-10G, ETA-10P and ETA-10Q – the first two being immersed in liquid nitrogen to allow for higher clock speeds, and the others being air-cooled. Each machine used one of more common single-board processors.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology had ordered an air-cooled model.\n\nUnfortunately, on 17 April 1989, CDC/ETA announced the closure of ETA systems. There were offers made for CSIRO and in particular DAR to host an ETA system as an interim solution.\n\nPapers documenting the negotiations have been scanned.\n\nSFTF\n\nThis was set up in early 1989, and was chaired by Mike Coulthard from CSIRO Applied Geomechanics. Other members of the team included Charles Johnson from Materials Science and Technology, Bob Smart from the Division of Information Technology, Robert Bell from the Division of Atmospheric Research, Dick Manchester from Radiophysics, David McCullough from Administration, and with Peter Price from the ACSG and Jose Varghese from Biotechnology contributing. CSIRO issued a call for expressions of interest, asked for a replacement for the 205, that had to be faster, run UNIX, had 10 Gbyte of disc storage, with a few other criteria.\n\nBenchmarks were developed to allow vendors to demonstrate performance.\n\nProposals were received from CDC (ETA), Convex, Cray Research (one for an X-MP, one for a Y-MP in conjunction with Leading Edge Technologies), IBM and Fujitsu.\n\nProposals from Cray and Convex were short-listed, and Bob Smart and Rob Bell left on 29th July 1989 to visit Purdue University, CDC, Cray Research, Convex and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, to carry out benchmarking, and to gather information.\n\nAt Purdue, Bob and Rob evaluated an ETA-10 running UNIX. After about half the benchmarks didn’t even compile, it was clear that although the ETA-10 might have been an attractive follow-on from the 205, that this was a lost cause, with CDC pulling the plug on the ETA enterprise in April 1989. A visit to CDC in Minneapolis gave no further assurance. (As an aside, while walking around Purdue on a Sunday afternoon, Bob went in pursuit of a network link, and found a staff member who was logged in. Bob exchanged messages with Robert Elz at the University of Melbourne, who was on-line. Bob asked about the cricket test match which was in progress – a crucial match in the Ashes series. Robert Elz reported on Australia’s score which indicated that the Ashes had been won – this was an important demonstration of the usefulness of the Internet!)\n\nBob and Rob then visited Cray Research, Convex and NCAR. (Still jet-lagged after travelling on 4 flights in one day on a long Saturday, Bob and Rob arrived at Cray on the following Tuesday afternoon to find that benchmarking was scheduled from 10 PM to 2 AM!) At Convex, performance issues became evident in access to memory. There also appeared to be a fault in the floating-point arithmetic.\n\nTwo propositions were then put to the PCC by the SFTF: one a proposal from Convex for several of its C series vector machines, and a proposal from Cray Research and Leading Edge Technologies to share in a 2-processor Cray Y-MP. (A proposal from Cray Research for a CSIRO-only Cray X-MP was not recommended.)\n\nAt a meeting in August 1989, the PCC decided on the Cray Research/Leading Edge Technologies shared Cray Y-MP proposal. (This happened while Bob Frater, the PCC chair, was absent from the meeting to attend an event at CSIRO Radiophysics, and Alan Reid took over as chair.) Minter Ellison was called on to do due diligence on LET.\n\nSee https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat=19891113&id=mQAzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pJEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5570,5349828&hl=en for a report in “The Age” from 13 November 1989 about the setting up of the JSF and the Strategic Research Foundation.\n\n(In 1989, Rob Bell analysed the CSIRO usage of the CDC Cyber 205, and found that 91% of the usage came from researchers based in the Melbourne area: given the state of network bandwidths available at the time at the dawn of AARNet, the decision was made to base the supercomputer in Melbourne).\n\nBob Smart wrote in 1989: “My role on that committee is to ensure that adequate networking infrastructure is provided to give CSIRO researchers convenient access to the supercomputers.” It was clear that providing links from the researches to the supercomputer over Csironet was not an option, and that the TCP/IP networks were the way of the future. Bob Smart advocated for CSIRO to join AARNet, which it did, and so was able to benefit from the AARNet backbone connecting the capitals, and the associated regional networks. However, it was a busy time in early 1990 setting up access from all the CSIRO sites to AARNet, and hence the supercomputer. Some of Bob’s advocacy and planning can be seen here. A history of AARnet can be found here.\n\nThen, negotiations began with LET to establish the Joint Supercomputer Facility service and the machine room to house the Y-MP (which was owned by CSIRO). (LET already had an X-MP, and had an established seismic data processing business with Tensor Pacific.)."
