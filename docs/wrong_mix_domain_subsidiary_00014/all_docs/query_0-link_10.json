        "text": "(FORTUNE Magazine) â€“ THE SLIM, casually dressed man walks quickly across his spare cinderblock office, pausing to glance out at the bleak Wisconsin landscape. Yet another snowstorm appears to be building in the leaden skies. He sighs and moves on to a small blackboard on the other side of the room. He picks up a piece of chalk and begins scrawling numbers. ''This machine will be built, it has to be built,'' he proclaims in strongly accented English. ''The future of technology in this country is at stake.'' That statement might seem loaded with hubris. Steve S. Chen is, after all, only a fledgling entrepreneur hunkered down with 40 colleagues in an abandoned factory hard by Interstate 94 in Eau Claire. It is not an inspiring scene, especially when ferocious winds are howling down from the Canadian North. But this is a man on a mission he considers nearly sacred, and the odds are improving that he will complete it over the next four or five years. Chen was born in China; he chose the name Steve when he became a U.S. citizen in 1982. Now 44, he has long been a blazing star in the arcane world of supercomputers. During eight years of development work at Cray Research Inc. of Minneapolis, the industry leader, he pioneered the use of powerful multiple processors for ultra-high-speed computers (see diagram) and created the company's hugely successful X-MP series of machines. Two years ago he began assembling what became a 200-person team at Cray to develop the first of an entirely new generation of supercomputers, a behemoth with 64 separate high-powered processors. Collectively these processors could crunch numbers at least 100 times faster than anything in use today.\n\nBut Chen's dreams got put on hold last summer when Cray's chairman, John A. Rollwagen, abruptly scrapped the project as too costly and technologically risky. Chen quit, taking with him two score Cray researchers to set up Supercomputer Systems Inc. and continue work on his monster machine. Though several venture capitalists expressed at least passing interest in the project, most in the industry doubted that Chen could raise enough capital to fulfill his plans; Rollwagen had fulminated about a $100 million price tag for development work on the machine. Professional obituaries for Chen began appearing in the press. ALL THAT changed fast in December when IBM, which instantly confers legitimacy on anything it invests in, announced that it would give Chen both seed money and technical help. IBM has flirted with various supercomputer projects of its own, but this was its most aggressive move onto Chen's particular corner of the field. Supercomputers of the type Chen designs use a computing technique commonly called parallel processing. Unlike even the biggest conventional mainframe computers, which grind out numbers one at a time, new superquick machines like Chen's divide a problem among very large multiple processors that pump out data on different parts of it simultaneously. Problems that once took weeks or months now zip through in a day or even hours. There is no shortage of demand for the kind of computing power Chen promises to provide. Even at $5 million to over $20 million per machine, vs. $2 million to $10 million for conventional mainframes, supercomputer sales are now running about $1 billion a year, and the industry consensus is that they will continue growing into the 1990s at an annual rate of nearly 30%. ''It is an essential part of the market, and IBM has got to have a role in it,'' says Carl J. Conti, the IBM vice president in charge of developing and manufacturing the company's most powerful computers. Scientists at many universities around the world, along with government researchers on projects ranging from weather forecasting to missile guidance, are clamoring for bigger, faster supercomputers because the machines can swiftly and accurately simulate all manner of complex natural phenomena. The physicist hoping to see how a subatomic particle might behave has never had so useful a tool. Because the machines provide an alternative to expensive physical experimentation, demand is growing in a variety of commercial quarters as well. Says Marcelo Gumucio, Cray's executive vice president: ''You don't actually have to put something in the wind tunnel. You can study it on the screen and be confident enough to go right to metal.'' Big aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing have long used supercomputers to test designs without constructing cumbersome scale models. Using a Cray supercomputer, Boeing engineers recently solved an airflow problem involving the popular 737. They determined that they could mount larger, more fuel-efficient engines in front of the wings rather than beneath them -- even though conventional wind- tunnel testing suggested that such a configuration would produce excessive drag. Ford and GM use their supermachines for a range of tasks including computerized test crashing and identifying noise- and vibration-prone areas on new designs. On occasion competitive rivalries within an industry have stimulated sales. Last year, for example, Cray sold supercomputers in quick succession to West German auto manufacturers Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. MOST OF THE WORLD'S major oil companies employ the machines for geological exploration, and chemical companies like Du Pont have begun to put them to work modeling molecules or delving into problems in biotechnology. Gumucio expects one of the major U.S. airlines to buy a machine before long because of the massive data processing involved in scheduling crews, aircraft, and maintenance. Even Wall Street is taking a close look at supercomputers: Half a dozen brokerage firms have experimented with the ultrafast machines for such jobs as developing trading strategies and putting together econometric models. IBM's assistance has forced most industry watchers to revise their initially skeptical view of Chen's prospects. Says Steven Milunovich, a high-tech analyst at the First Boston investment banking firm: ''If you are betting on a jockey, this is the guy with the track record. You cannot take what he's doing lightly.'' Cray, which dominates the market with more than 60% of worldwide sales, is certainly paying attention. So are the other top companies in the field. ETA Systems Inc., a division of Control Data Corp., is now Cray's chief U.S. rival for the full-size supercomputer market; Alliant Corp. and Convex Corp. account for most U.S. sales of smaller high-speed machines, called minisupers, that use similar technology but have less capacity. Three Japanese companies -- Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC -- are active in the world market but have by and large been shut out of the U.S. All are fully aware that the Chen- IBM entry may well signal an even tougher competitive scramble ahead. The unassuming fellow creating all this fuss was born in China's Fukien province in 1944. After the war his father, a Nationalist military officer and later a government bureaucrat, brought his family to Taiwan. Chen took a degree in electrical engineering at the fiercely competitive National Taiwan University; he came to the U.S. in 1970 for a master's in electrical engineering at Villanova and a Ph.D. in computing science at the University of Illinois. He has spent his entire professional career working with powerful computers, first as a project engineer at Burroughs Corp., then as a project manager at Floating Point Systems Inc. in Oregon, and eventually at Cray. Though reticent about his personal life, Chen admits that his habit of burying himself in his work helped contribute to the breakup of his marriage. He has two school-age sons. Chen's troubles at Cray derived largely from his basic professional and ) scientific differences with Seymour Cray, the founder and resident genius. Cray, while widely recognized as one of the seminal thinkers of the field, has always proceeded cautiously in developing new machines. He prefers adapting existing technology to seeking out entirely new areas of research. His first commercial product, the famous Cray 1, which made its debut in 1976, was basically a single-processor machine with design breakthroughs that made it then the world's fastest computer. Those who know both men say that Chen is far more likely than Cray to leap into the unknown. To link the processors for his new machine, for example, Chen plans to explore using fiber optics to couple components for the first time. Cray also tends to scale his project teams down to modest proportions. His staff for his most recent program, the development of a new Cray 3, is little more than half the size of the group Chen had assembled before his departure. Chen's methods had proved productive over the years, but the size and scope of his new plan seemed far too grand for the company's essentially conservative management. After Chen left Cray, Rollwagen bad-mouthed the project so vehemently to a group of security analysts that one listener calculated it had only an 8% chance of success. (He arrived at that figure by combining the probabilities that Chen would overcome obstacles in five different areas.) Chen denies taking any sizable technological risks. ''The breakthroughs are all psychological,'' he insists. ''We just have to stretch a bit -- the building blocks are all there.'' Both Chen and Cray officials begin discussions of his departure with expressions of high regard, but signs of a sour residue soon appear. ''His project simply didn't show enough merit to be continued,'' sniffs Cray's Gumucio, adding that he doubts Chen will be able to endure any limitations IBM might impose on his project. Chen likes to contrast his experience at Cray with General Dwight Eisenhower's triumphant assault on D-day: ''Like Ike, I got my orders to assemble my army and prepare all the ships for the landing. Then the day arrived and everything was ready. But in my case the president called to say the water was too cold, the tide was too high, the whole thing was too dangerous. I could have taken the beach for them. I have taken many beaches.'' TO TAKE this particular stretch of sand, Chen may have to depend heavily on IBM. The cash it is sending his way -- around $10 million initially, by some estimates -- is but a small part of the Big Blue connection. Just as important will be the company's technical help in crucial areas such as disk drives, semiconductors, and software design. IBM markets a booster system known as the 3090 Vector Facility that allows large mainframes to perform some supercomputing tasks. Company researchers are also engaged in two new related projects. The first, called GF11, is aimed at building a machine capable of solving particular problems in physics; the other, labeled RP3, involves building a device that may help deal with some of the mathematical problems inherent in the simultaneous use of a great many multiple processors. Among the hurdles Chen's team faces will be developing the immensely complicated software necessary to divide a problem so that each of the multiple processors can carry out its particular task. The object being portrayed inevitably becomes distorted in the process, and it will take massive number-crunching to compensate for the distortion and then go ahead to simulate the problem precisely. Even if Chen and his team manage to slay all the technological dragons along their way, robust demand may not automatically translate into commercial success. Because of its solid growth prospects and scientific prestige, the supercomputer field will continue to intrigue most of the world's top computer manufacturers. The Japanese players, especially NEC, have demonstrated that they can produce top-quality supercomputers. That fact has not escaped the U.S. government, ever mindful of the crucial military applications of top-level supercomputing -- to the Strategic Defense Initiative, for example. Washington's sensitivity surfaced last year when MIT seemed ready to make a deal to lease a new NEC supercomputer model for a relatively small annual fee, rather than incur the expense of buying it. NEC would have benefited both from new software applications developed by MIT scientists and from the priceless imprimatur of one of the world's most advanced computing centers. None of this was lost on U.S. officials. The Commerce Department raised objections to the arrangement, and the offer was quickly withdrawn. Cray remains Chen's biggest competitor at home or abroad. Though Cray officials downplay Chen's contribution these days, his departure was a significant loss. The X-MP machines, which have been Cray's biggest sellers in recent years, were largely developed by Chen's teams. The company will shortly announce production schedules for the Y-MP, the last of the multiple-processor supercomputers Chen developed for Cray, and sales prospects for the $20- million-plus machine are excellent. The company, however, is by no means crippled by Chen's defection. Says Jeffry Canin, senior technology analyst at the Hambrecht & Quist brokerage firm in San Francisco: ''Cray is very, very deep in engineering and technology. At the same time, they know very well what they are doing in the marketplace. They are very much a moving target.'' And no one in the supercomputer business has moved faster than Seymour Cray. He has reportedly completed development work on the new Cray 3, which will crunch numbers about 100 times faster than his original supercomputer design. Now he is turning his formidable energies to the Cray 4, a megamachine that should be able to compete with whatever Chen or anyone else produces over the next five years or so. ''From everything I hear, I'd say that Seymour is ready to revolutionize the business one more time,'' says Gumucio. Whether or not that is an accurate assessment of the project, Cray is obviously determined to maintain his hold on a large share of the supercomputer market. According to the experts who track that market, that grip is unlikely to slacken anytime soon. Canin of Hambrecht & Quist says Chen's project may well have an easier time challenging Control Data's ETA Systems subsidiary, currently the No. 2 U.S. player in the field. He reasons that the Defense Department and other U.S. government agencies have long been determined to support more than one U.S. manufacturer of crucial high-tech products such as supercomputers. ETA's machines have filled that role so far, but the Chen-IBM entry could well supplant them down the line. In fact, industry gossip has it that U.S. officials used subtle patriotic pressures on IBM to throw more of its weight into supercomputing. The market, though burgeoning, is still relatively minuscule by the standards of IBM, which has $54 billion in annual sales. Chen would doubtless throw himself into the work even without competition. He speaks dutifully of the commercial aspects of the job before him. He may move his operation from Eau Claire to Champaign, Illinois, the site of a major supercomputer complex, if financial inducements offered by local officials are sufficiently attractive and if he can recruit another 150 or so researchers there to fill out his development team. He may take the company public at some point to raise additional capital; currently his enterprise is jointly owned by him and the 40-odd people who came over with him from Cray.\n\nBut Chen is heart and soul a scientist, and he plainly cares far more about the stiff technical challenges he will be tackling in the years ahead than he does about business and financial arrangements. He is at his most animated when he talks about the intricate mysteries he plans to explore. He seems impatient to get on with it, to gather his troops and take that beach one more time.\n\nBOX: HOW A SUPERCOMPUTER WORKS Any extremely powerful computer can be called a supercomputer, but not all supercomputers are alike in the way they are put together -- their architecture, as those in the business call it. In most existing computers, ordinary or super, a single processor grinds out numbers at lightning speed -- but only one at a time. Today even the most powerful machines that use single processors are approaching the limits of that design. Given the constraints of space and materials, they can't get much speedier. So computer builders are turning to parallel processing, shown here in simplified form, to make still faster machines. Yoking several processors together to work on parts of a problem at the same time can increase computer speed dramatically.\n\nTHE FIRST STEP in parallel processing, the kind of computing used in Steve Chen's designs: an object to be studied -- for example, a proposed airframe.\n\nNEXT the computer makes a mathematical model of the airframe, breaking it down into the numerical values of each of its parts -- as a digital recorder does with a note of music -- and storing them in the system's memory.\n\nPHASE NO. 3: The computer divides the model into sections and instructs each processor to analyze a different segment of the problem -- in this case the stresses on the airframe in flight.\n\nTHE RESULT is a graphic simulation of the airframe and the impact of outside forces on it. The aircraft designer can identify potential weak spots (in red) and either use stronger materials or alter the design."
