He had a private lunch with me, one I will remember all my life. I asked him at one point what the next qualitative step for supercomputing would be. He paused and thought for a moment, then said, \"I think it will be biological computing--using DNA and proteins as the computing elements just as Nature does.\" This was before the first tentative steps in that direction were announced by frontier researchers in this yet-to-be-born field. I asked him if he thought that he would be involved in building such machines and he said matter-of-factly, \"no, I don't think I will live to see that day...\"\n\nPhase 6\n\nASCI project: ASCI stands for Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative, and is a US DOE-DP (Department of Energy, Defense Programs office) program created in 1995 and (as currently planned) involving $1 billion over ten years (from 1995 to 2004). Under this program a 1.3 TFLOP machine was created by the end of 1996.\n\nThe ASCI program was created mainly to facilitate U.S. participation in the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban treaty, by allowing us to simulate a nuclear weapon test entirely on the computer. The program is roughly evenly divided between the three DOE-DP laboratories (Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia) which have historically had a major role in nuclear weapons research as well as other big scientific computing projects. Each of the three laboratories is involved in a different supercomputer system project, and each has a different commercial contractor:\n\nLaboratory Contractor ASCI Project name Architecture Sandia Intel Option Red based on Intel Paragon, with Pentium-Pro nodes Los Alamos SGI (Cray division) Option Blue Mountain linked Origin 2000 systems (MIPS R10000 nodes) Lawrence Livermore IBM Option Blue Pacific based on POWER Parallel, POWER2 nodes\n\nThe remaining two current projects (the option Blue systems) should be complete by the end of 1998 or early 1999 and run at 3 TFLOPS each.\n\nAnother ASCI project (called PathForward) is working on developing the technology for faster machines. It focuses on developing those parts of the system which cannot be built from mass-market parts (mainly interconnect speed, debugging techniques and archival mass storage capacity). The schedule calls for 10 TFLOPS by the end of 1999, 30 TFLOPS by 2001 and 100 TFLOPS by 2004. Note that these might be accomplished by linking two or more machines together, if the interconnect bandwidth is high enough (the initial Blue Mountain system works that way, for example). Throughout the program the systems developed will have approximately the following performance characteristics (expressed as ratios): 1 TFLOPS performance / 16 TB/sec cache bandwidth / 3 TB/sec memory bandwidth / 1 TB memory / 100 GB/sec I/O bandwidth / 10 GB/sec disk bandwidth / 50 TB hard disk / 1 GB/sec archival storage bandwidth / 10 PB archival storage.
