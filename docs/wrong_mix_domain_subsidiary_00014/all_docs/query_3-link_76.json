(CRI). The company filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Colorado (the Court) in 1995.\n\nThe Company was engaged in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of the CRAY-3/Super Scalable System (SSS) and CRAY-4 high-performance computer systems and the marketing of the CRAY-3 supercomputer system. The CRAY-3 and CRAY-4 are modular upgradeable general purpose supercomputers designed to provide balanced, high-performance computing for many types of scientific and engineering applications.\n\nThe CRAY-3, CRAY-3/SSS, and CRAY-4 incorporate a modular or building-block architecture designed to allow customers to add processing and memory capability. The CRAY 3/SSS is designed to utilize a 2-processor CRAY-3 in conjunction with Processor in-Memory (PIM) chips developed and manufactured by a third party to provide vector parallel processing, scalable parallel processing, and the combination of both.\n\nThe software environment for the CRAY-3 and CRAY-4 was based on the June 1989 version of the UNICOS operating system used by many supercomputers, including the CRAY-2, which was developed and sold by CRI. This compatibility permits most software, including third party software applications, used in the CRAY-2 system to be used with the CRAY-3.\n\nCritical Supercomputing Parameters\n\nThe critical supercomputing parameters by which supercomputers are traditionally measured are performance, memory size, and memory bandwidth.\n\nMemory bandwidth (speed) is measured in gigabytes per second and impacts the balance of the system (i.e., the ability of the memory to keep the processors fully occupied). The bandwidth of memory is critical because it defines what \"immediately accessible\" means in terms of how long it takes data to get from common memory to the processing part of the system and back. A balanced supercomputer system addresses the issue of matching processor performance with memory bandwidth and memory size. The only way to guarantee optimal performance for a given application is to have the data immediately accessible in common memory. Hence, as the model complexity grows, so must the size and speed of the common memory required to support it.\n\nArchitecture and Hardware\n\nThe essential design parameters of vector processing computer architecture include fast processor speed combined with a large, high speed memory in a dense packaging arrangement.\n\nThe CRAY-3 featured a large main memory that was addressable by all the processors in a system. This memory may be as large as 1 gigaword in an 8- processor system. Each processor contains two memory ports for simultaneously reading and writing memory. The Company's present emphasis was on the manufacture and sale of 4- and 8-processor CRAY-3 systems.\n\nPeripheral Equipment and Networking\n\nThe CRAY-3 and CRAY-4 were designed to support up to 28 standard HIPPI channels, on a 8-processor CRAY-3. These channels are used to connect to high speed networks, other computers, and peripheral devices.\n\nThe CRAY-3 and the CRAY-4 are designed to support a number of peripherals currently used with CRAY-2 systems. This would have facilitated a customer's migration from a CRAY-2 to a CRAY-3 or CRAY-4 system. Initial network connections use the existing CRAY-2 interfaces.\n\nThe CRAY-4\n\nThe CRAY-4 was designed to provide prospective customers with flexible CPU and memory configurations. The CRAY-4 design uses an extension of the technology developed for the CRAY-3, including the use of similar architecture, hardware, manufacturing techniques, peripheral equipment, and networking.\n\nCRAY-4 Node\n\nThe CRAY-4 was the first high-end supercomputer to support the IEEE Floating Point format. Additionally, the CRAY-4 and its system software are designed to support the concept of vector/parallel distributed computing.\n\nCRAY-3/Super Scalable System\n\nThe CRAY-3/SSS is a system that combines proven traditional supercomputer vector/parallel architecture with a SIMD massively parallel supercomputer architecture. It is an extension of the supercomputer system's high speed common memory which incorporates thousands of simple yet powerful processors that can be called upon to perform extremely complex functions at extraordinary speeds.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe Company's software provides an effective and efficient program development and execution environment on the CRAY-3 which both supports the migration of codes from other platforms and the rapid exploitation of the CRAY-3 for new problems. This software environment was being extended to provide similar levels of support for the CRAY-4 system.\n\nCRAY-3/Super Scalable System\n\nIn 1994, the Company entered into a joint development contract with the National security Agency (NSA) to produce a CRAY-3/SSS offering vector parallel processing, scalable parallel processing, and the combination of both. The CRAY-3/SSS is designed to utilize a CRAY-3 and a large number of Processor-In-Memory (PIM) chips developed by the Supercomputing Research Center of the Institute for Defense Analyses and manufactured by National Semiconductor Corporation.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe Company's primary competitors for traditional vector supercomputers were CRI, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Fujitsu, Hitachi, and Nippon Electric Corporation. These MPP competitors include CRI, IBM, Intel Supercomputer, Convex and Silicon Graphics.\n\nThe above Company Fundamental Report is a half-ready report and contents are subject to change.\n\nIt means that we have all necessary data in our database to prepare the report but need 2-3 days to complete it.

Article Density Chart\n\n1 – Data availability depends on company’s security policy.\n\n2 – These sections are available only when you purchase a report with appropriate additional types of analyses.\n\nThe complete financial data is available for publicly traded companies.\n\nSWOT Analysis\n\nSWOT, which stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats, is an analytical framework that identifies the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable for a company.\n\nEnhanced SWOT Analysis\n\nEnhanced SWOT is a 3×3 grid that arranges strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats into one scheme:\n\nHow to use the strengths to take advantage of the opportunities?\n\nHow to use the strengths to reduce likelihood and impact of the threats?\n\nHow to overcome the weaknesses that obstruct taking advantage of the opportunities?\n\nHow to overcome the weaknesses that can make the threats a reality?\n\nUpon answering these questions a company can develop a project plan to improve its business performance.\n\nPESTEL Analysis\n\nPESTEL (also termed as PESTLE) is an ideal tool to strategically analyze what influence different outside factors – political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental and legal – exert on a business to later chart its long term targets.\n\nBeing part of the external analysis when carrying out a strategic assessment or performing a market study, PESTEL gives an overview of diverse macro-environmental factors that any company should thoughtfully consider. By perceiving these outside environments, businesses can maximally benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization.\n\nKey Factors Examined by PESTEL Analysis:\n\nPolitical – What opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulations’ impact on the business?\n\nEconomic – What economic policies, trends and structures are expected to affect the organization, what is this influence’s degree?\n\nSociological – What cultural and societal aspects will work upon the demand for the business’s products and operations?\n\nTechnological – What impact do the technological aspects, innovations, incentives and barriers have on the organization?\n\nEnvironmental – What environmental and ecological facets, both locally and farther afield, are likely to predetermine the business?\n\nLegal – What laws and legislation will exert influence on the style the business is carried out?\n\nIFE, EFE, IE Matrices\n\nThe Internal Factor Evaluation matrix (IFE matrix) is a strategic management tool helping audit or evaluate major weaknesses and strengths in a business’s functional areas. In addition, IFE matrix serves as a basis for identifying and assessing relationships amongst those areas. The IFE matrix is utilised in strategy formulation.\n\nThe External Factor Evaluation matrix (EFE matrix) is a tool of strategic management that is typically utilised to assess current market conditions. It is an ideal instrument for visualising and prioritising the threats and opportunities a firm is facing.\n\nThe essential difference between the above mentioned matrices lies in the type of factors incorporated in the model; whilst the latter is engaged in internal factors, the former deals exceptionally with external factors – those exposed to social, political, economic, legal, etc. external forces.\n\nBeing a continuation of the EFE matrix and IFE matrix models, the Internal External matrix (IE matrix) rests upon an investigation of external and internal business factors integrated into one suggestive model.\n\nPorter Five Forces Analysis\n\nThe Porter’s five forces analysis studies the industry of operation and helps the company find new sources of competitive advantage. The analysis surveys an industry through five major questions:\n\nWhat composes a threat of substitute products and services?\n\nIs there a threat of new competitors entering the market?\n\nWhat is the intensity of competitive rivalry?\n\nHow big is the bargaining power of buyers?\n\nHow significant is the bargaining power of suppliers?\n\nVRIO Analysis\n\nVRIO stands for Value, Rarity, Imitability, Organization. This analysis helps to evaluate all company’s resources and capabilities and bring them together into one aggregate table that includes:\n\nTangible resources\n\nFinancial\n\nPhysical\n\nTechnological\n\nOrganizational\n\nIntangible resources\n\nHuman\n\nInnovation and Creativity\n\nReputation\n\nOrganizational capabilities\n\nThe result of the analysis gives a clear picture of company’s competitive and economic implications, answering the questions if the resources mentioned above are:\n\nValuable?\n\nRare?\n\nCostly to imitate?\n\nOrganized properly?"
