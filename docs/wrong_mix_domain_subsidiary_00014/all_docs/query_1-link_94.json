        "text": "SEATTLE, Feb. 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq: CRAY) today announced financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018.\n\nAll figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.\n\nFor 2018, Cray reported total revenue of $456 million, which compares with $393 million in 2017. Net loss for 2018 was $72 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $134 million, or $3.33 per diluted share in 2017. Non-GAAP net loss, which adjusts for selected unusual and non-cash items, was $58 million, or $1.42 per diluted share for 2018, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $41 million, or $1.01 per diluted share in 2017.\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $163 million, compared to $167 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $13 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $98 million, or $2.42 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss was $9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to non-GAAP net income of $9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\nPlease note, 2017 GAAP results were impacted by both the new U.S. tax law and a change to the valuation allowance held against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. The combined negative impact on the Company’s 2017 GAAP net loss was $103 million and was excluded for non-GAAP purposes.\n\nFor 2018, overall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was 29%, compared to 33% and 34%, respectively, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in 2017.\n\nGAAP operating expenses for 2018 were $204 million, compared to $196 million in 2017. Non-GAAP operating expenses for 2018 were $191 million, compared to $177 million in 2017.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, cash, investments, and restricted cash totaled $246 million. Working capital at the end of 2018 was $291 million, compared to $354 million at December 31, 2017.\n\n“Led by strength in our commercial business, we delivered solid growth for the year,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO of Cray. “While our target market continues to show signs of a rebound from its recent lows, 2019 is shaping up to be a transition year as we plan to begin shipping our next generation Shasta platform late this year. Shasta will deliver a balance of performance, flexibility and ease of use unlike anything available today, as well as a true exascale-class architecture capable of scaling well into the future. With continued focus and execution, we are well positioned to expand on our market leadership position and deliver strong long-term growth.”\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2019, while a wide range of results remains possible, Cray expects revenue to grow modestly compared to 2018. Revenue is expected to be about $70 million for the first quarter of 2019. For 2019, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be in the 30% range, and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow compared to 2018. Based on this outlook, the Company expects to recognize a substantial GAAP and non-GAAP net loss for 2019.\n\nCray’s effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for 2019 are both expected to be in the low single-digit range.\n\nActual results for any future periods are subject to large fluctuations given the nature of Cray’s business.\n\nRecent Highlights\n\nIn November, Vanguard Infrastructures announced it selected the Cray XC supercomputing system as the compute and real-time analytics engine for the new Vanguard Stargate Imaging security scanning solution. The Cray XC was selected because of its exceptional ability to process massive amounts of data at high speed.\n\nIn November, Cray announced support for Intel’s upcoming Cascade Lake advanced performance processors in systems starting in 2019. The Intel Xeon Scalable processors will first be available in Cray’s CS500 line of systems and then, in 2020, on Cray’s new exascale-class systems, code named Shasta.\n\nIn November, Cray announced its Urika AI and Analytics software suites, adding tools that enable data scientists to train artificial intelligence models more accurately and in less time. New features in the Cray Urika-CS and Urika-XC AI and Analytics suites include Cray-developed libraries to intelligently optimize machine learning model settings as well as additional AI tools and frameworks commonly used by data scientists.\n\nIn November, GW4, the Met Office, and Cray announced that the Arm-based supercomputer in Europe, named “Isambard,” is now live in the United Kingdom. It is the largest Arm-based system in the world outside of the US and one of the first systems of its kind to be used for scientific research as well as to explore future computer architectures in the exascale era.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nCray will host a conference call today, Tuesday, February 12, 2019 at 1:30 p.m. PT (4:30 p.m. ET) to discuss its year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018 financial results.

International callers should dial (409) 217-8435 and use the conference ID #1869079. To listen to the audio webcast, go to the Investors section of the Cray website at www.cray.com/company/investors.\n\nIf you are unable to attend the live conference call, an audio webcast replay will be available in the Investors section of the Cray website for 180 days. A telephonic replay of the call will also be available by dialing (855) 859-2056, international callers dial (404) 537-3406, and entering the conference ID #1869079. The conference call replay will be available for 72 hours, beginning at 4:45 p.m. PT on Tuesday, February 12, 2019.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.\n\nAdditionally, we have not quantitatively reconciled the non-GAAP guidance measures disclosed under “Outlook” to their corresponding GAAP measures because we do not provide specific guidance for the various reconciling items such as share-based compensation, adjustments to the provision for income taxes, amortization of intangibles, costs related to acquisitions, purchase accounting adjustments, and gain on significant asset sales, as certain items that impact these measures have not occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations to the non-GAAP guidance measures are not available without unreasonable effort. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact our financial results.\n\nAbout Cray Inc.\n\nCray Inc.
