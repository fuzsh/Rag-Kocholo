Reviewed by: Rohit Tuli, CFA®

Global equities dipped on Thursday as investor enthusiasm was dampened by a pullback in oil prices related to rising inventories, while the dollar rose as economic data drove expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. In the U.S., consumer prices fell in the 12 months through January, the first such decline since 2009 as gasoline prices continued to tumble. The S&P 500 ended down 0.15% to 2110.74, Dow was down 0.06% to 18214.42, while Nasdaq was a bright spot in U.S. equities, rising 0.42% to 4987.89 on news of a technology deal. The pan-European Euro Stoxx 600 Index closed up 0.9% higher as investors reacted to a raft of corporate earnings and fresh economic data. The latest GDP data from Spain and UK confirmed a year on year growth of 2% and 2.7%, respectively in the last quarter. The German unemployment rate also stayed at a record low in February. In Asia, Japanese shares outperformed the region by reaching a new multiyear high, but the rest of Asia traded mixed on Thursday.

Cray Inc's 2014 net income increased to $62.3 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, from $32.2 million, or $0.81 per diluted share in 2013, aided by a $52.6 million income tax benefit, which resulted from a reduction of substantially all of the valuation allowance held against the Company's U.S. deferred tax assets.
