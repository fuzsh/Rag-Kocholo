        "text": "Address: Mike Brewer Bodyshop (Previously the Hicks building), Thompson Close, Chesterfield S41 9AZ Event: TV Presenter Mike Brewer was in Chesterfield, opening his new Bodyshop and accident repair centre.\n\nThe only one of its kind in the world opens on Thompson Close (near Whittington Moor Roundabout). The centre is able to perform full vehicle accident repairs, as well as cosmetic 'SmartFix' repairs and Alloy wheel refurbishments. The opening is the latest expansion from Mike Brewer, who's Showroom in Sheffield continues to go from strength to strength. Mike assures us that no job will be too big or too small for his team, and promises the same low prices and high quality that have made the site at Sheffield such a success: -We opened in Sheffield 2 years ago, and in that time have created 28 jobs, and I'm very proud of that. We are looking into other cities that we'd like to spread the ethos and the way that we do business into, because it's a unique business and with this rapid expansion, you can see that it works. This site in Chesterfield is the next step of that. Cars have been a big part of my life since I was a very young man, so I know the quality job that this team do. Every car that's completed at either site, is fully valeted by one of our in-house valeters, too! Who is Mike Brewer? Mike is a car dealer/Broadcast Journalist/TV Presenter, famous for fronting Deals on Wheels, Driven for Channel 4, Auto Trader, Pulling Power, Deals on Wheels, Wrecks to Riches, and Revved-up as well as several other non- motoring programmes for Discovery Channel and ITV. It is, however, Discovery's Wheeler Dealers that most struck the hearts of fans across the world. Since its inception, Mike has gone on to commentate on the British Rally Championship for Sky Sports, and present Frontline Battle Machines from Afghanistan, as well as creating Wheeler Dealers-trading up; whilst the original Wheeler Dealers continues to impress an ever-increasing global audience of over 100million.
