        "text": "Former All Blacks flanker Mike Brewer succeeded Jason Robinson as Head Coach of Sale Sharks in April 2010 but was dismissed in December of the same year amid reports he had alienated most of the side.\n\nDuring his playing days, Brewer represented the All Blacks on 32 occasions scoring one try in winning 22 and drawing one game for his country. He also played provincial rugby for Otago and Canterbury in New Zealand's south Island.\n\nSince his retirement from playing, Brewer coached in Italy and Ireland before signing a contract with the Scottish National Rugby Union team as their forwards coach working, alongside Head Coach Frank Hadden in August 2008.\n\nBrewer quit his Scotland post in May 2009 after missing out on the head coach position when Hadden was dropped.\n\nBefore his appointment with Sale, Brewer was technical director for the Flying Fijians National Team ahead of their 2009 European Tour."
