        "text": "Wheeler Dealers host Mike Brewer has made crystal clear when Edd China will return to the popular classic car restoration show in a major admission.\n\nMike, host of the show for more than 20 years, revealed Edd would not be returning to the series despite demands for the duo to reunite.\n\nHe stressed Edd coming back was “not happening” and urged fans angered by the move to switch off completely.\n\nMike and Edd started the show together back in 2003 and were on an on-screen double act for almost 15 years.\n\nHowever, Edd and Mike parted ways back in 2017 with Ant Anstead and Marc Priestley taking over co-host duties.\n\nREAD MORE Mike Brewer lists used car picks for under £5,000 including Vauxhall and Ford\n\nMike made the latest remark in a 30-minute Q&A on the Wheeler Dealers Facebook page on Sunday evening.\n\nWife Michelle was asking Mike a series of questions sent in by fans of the show ahead of the new series of Wheeler Dealers World Tour.\n\nMichelle asked: “This one, we are going to start with get it in and out and out the way. Lord Blair asks ‘When is Edd coming back? I never watch it’.\n\n“So hold on Lord Blair, you must be watching it if you know he’s not in the show. How does that question work?”\n\nMike replied: “When is Edd coming back? He’s never coming back, simple as that.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nWheeler Dealers Mike Brewer on vital used car tip for 'less than a tank of fuel’ [LATEST]\n\nWheeler Dealers host Mike Brewer unveils simple fix for ‘dead’ classic cars [ANALYSIS]\n\nWheeler Dealers host Mike Brewer gives new update in hunt for stolen Ford Fiesta [COMMENT]\n\n“So yeah, it's like me saying I really want Sean Connery to be [James] Bond again. It would be great wouldn’t it, Sean Connery as Bond but it’s not happening.\n\n“Or it would be great if Tom Baker was Doctor Who, it isn’t happening.\n\n“So no he's never coming back and if you don't like the fact he is never coming back don’t watch it. Simply don't watch it.\n\n“Better still watch the old series, if you watch the old series, classic series where Edd was amazing, Go and watch that, it will be brilliant we love it.”\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
