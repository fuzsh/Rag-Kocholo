        "text": "Sale Sharks have appointed the former All Blacks forward Mike Brewer to their coaching staff as part of a shake-up which includes Jason Robinson leaving the club.\n\nBrewer, a former Scotland forwards coach during Frank Hadden's reign, won 32 caps for New Zealand and played in the 1995 World Cup final against South Africa in Johannesburg when the All Blacks lost 15-12. He will take up the role of head coach, working with the current rugby director, Kingsley Jones.\n\nRobinson, who will depart at the end of the season, said: \"When Kingsley asked me to help out last year I felt that I couldn't let him or the club down in what was always going to be a very challenging season.\n\n\"While I had no plans to go into coaching, I was delighted to respond in the club's hour of need. Having now made sure that Sale Sharks will be playing Guinness Premiership rugby next year, I feel that the time is right to let another coach take up the mantle.\"\n\nSale are currently 11th in the Premiership, five points above Worcester, whose defeat against Leeds Carnegie last weekend meant they face relegation.\n\nBrewer said: \"Although results this season have been disappointing, I believe that this squad has tremendous potential to achieve great success in coming seasons.\"\n\nRenowned scrummaging coach Phil Keith-Roach, meanwhile, will step down from Sale duties after deciding he could not commit to a full-time role at Edgeley Park.\n\nSale's owner, Brian Kennedy, said: \"This season we have failed to live up to our high standards and deliver the type of rugby that our fans expect. The board has conducted a thorough review of our rugby operations and decided to make changes to ensure that we hit the ground running next season and achieve an immediate and significant improvement in the quality of rugby played.\n\n\"With Kingsley taking responsibility for overall strategy and the appointment of Mike Brewer, who is an immensely experienced forwards coach, I believe that we have the right rugby management team to take the club forward to achieve future success.\n\n\"I would like to thank Jason Robinson and Phil Keith-Roach for their invaluable contribution in keeping Sharks in the Premiership in what has been an extremely tough season.\""
