He currently presents Wheeler Dealers on the Discovery Channel with Marc Priestley.\n\nDuring the short video clip, Michael pointed over to the isle of Cumbrae and Arran said: \"I am in a place called Largs - and there are all the islands with all the distilleries including Arran and places like that.\n\nLargs is a lovely nice week town with a lovely church (St Columba's Parish) and I am about go to into (Nardini's) ice cream parlour for a coffee.\n\n\"I am up early on the hunt for cars which is good and I have tracked the couple down and I hope to do a deal later. Ta-ra!\""
