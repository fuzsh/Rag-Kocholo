        "text": "WHEELER Dealers host Mike Brewer has enjoyed an incredible career in the spotlight, thanks to the much-loved motoring show.\n\nBut away from the hit Discovery series, the TV presenter and car enthusiast runs a business with wife Michelle.\n\nWho is Wheeler Dealers star Mike Brewer's wife Michelle?\n\nWheeler Dealers star Mike Brewer married his wife Michelle in 1992.\n\nBorn on June 9, 1962, like her husband she has a passion for motors.\n\nThere comes a time when I look and I think, maybe I should spend more time with my wife? She drives me mad but I love being with her.\n\nMike Brewer\n\nThe couple even run their own car dealership together called One Automotive in Warwick.\n\nMichelle also often appears on her husbands Wheeler Dealer podcast.\n\nIn 2023, Mike opened up about his marriage in a candid interview.\n\nSpeaking on a special episode of his podcast celebrating Wheeler Dealers 20th anniversary, Mike lifted the lid on the strain his work has put on his personal life.\n\nSpeaking openly he said: \"I've literally dedicated my life - 26 years actually - dedicated to this craft.\n\n\"And I feel like it's given me an amazing life but it's also come at the cost of my marriage.\n\n\"[We're] still together, [she's] never held me back once.\n\n\"But there comes a time when I look and I think, maybe I should spend more time with my wife? She drives me mad but I love being with her.\"\n\nBut he added that the couple took a month off in 2022 to enjoy a 3,000-mile road trip, describing it as \"the best 32 days I've had in the last 26 years.\"\n\nIn an Instagram post celebrating their 21st anniversary, Mike wrote: \"How did I get so lucky? 34 years together and 21 happily married.\n\n\"Happy Anniversary to my amazing Michelle.. I love you.\"\n\nDo they have any children?\n\nThe couple have one child together, a daughter called Chloe.\n\nThe family share a home in Warwickshire.\n\nMike tends to keep Chloe out of the spotlight, however in 2018 he posted a photo of her graduation.\n\nHe wrote next to the sweet snap: \"Proud dad alert! Congratulations Chloe Nicole Brewer on your graduation.\n\n\"Me and Michelle Brewer are so proud of you!\"\n\nWhat is Mike Brewer's net worth?\n\nAs of 2024, Mike has an estimated net worth of between £1M to £3M.\n\nThe popular TV star has made his money thanks to his long presenting career and other business ventures, which includes his used car dealership.\n\nAlong with his bank balance, Mike also has an impressive car collection.\n\nThe bulk of his collection is made up of Porsche models from across some of the brand's most popular decades.\n\nPart of his collection is a 1982 Porsche SC, which he took on himself as a resto-mod project.\n\nSpeaking on The Late Break Show, Mike said: \"I bought this car of an American Airlines pilot when I was living in California.\n\n\"He was the least interested man to ever own a Porsche...so much so that he sold it at a stupid price.\n\n\"I've done a lot of work to it.\"\n\nHow long has Mike Brewer presented Wheeler Dealers and what other shows has he appeared on?\n\nMike is best known as the host of Wheeler Dealers, the Discovery Channel’s car programme, which he has presented since 2003.\n\nThe premise of the show sees the team on a mission to save old vehicles, fix up old cars on a budget, and sell them to a new owner.\n\nIn November 2023, Mike hinted at \"retirement\", in his Wheeler Dealers podcast.\n\nHe said he may start to \"wind down his career\" to spend more time with his family.\n\nThe presenter explained: \"As much as I love making the show - I'm not resigning - but everything has a sell-by date.\"\n\nBefore hitting the big time on Wheeler Dealers, he started his television career in 1997 on Channel 4’s Deals on Wheels, and ITV’s Pulling Power.\n\nSince 2020, Mike has also hosted the Wheeler Dealers spin-off show on the Discovery Channel, Wheeler Dealers: Dream Car."
