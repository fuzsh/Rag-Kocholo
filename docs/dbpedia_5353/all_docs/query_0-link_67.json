        "text": "Wheeler Dealers presenter Mike Brewer gave a fan a brutal opinion on one of his own shows when they made a request on X. The 59-year-old motormouth who presents the hit show about buying vehicles, doing them up and then selling them at a profit spoke out after a follower came up with an idea for a spin-off.\n\nMike was asked on X, formerly Twitter by Suzanne Swan if they could do something on the cars that they’d restored and find out how the new owners had got on with them. She said: “@mikebrewer Any chance you could make a revisited series of Wheeler Dealers ‘where are they now?’ Seeing you track down cars you’ve flipped and what’s become of them?\n\n“I would love it, as I’m sure would plenty of others. Happy to help with research!” However, Mike quickly put the brakes on that suggestion, branded it 'boring' and said: “We done it.. wheeler dealers revisited.. it was boring .. sorry.” Launched in 2011, Wheeler Dealers Revisited was a one-off series presented by Mike and his former pal Edd China.\n\nIn the series, which ran for five episodes, Mike and Edd looked back on five of their most successful deals during the previous seasons and all-time favourite restorations. They even tracked down some of the vehicles and met the current owners to see how the cars were doing.\n\nEach one-hour episode relived the entire process of the restoration, including the buying, refurbishing and selling. It only lasted a short period of time - with the main Wheeler Dealers which has been on Discovery, having more than 280 episodes, including specials.\n\nMike has presented the main series with Edd, Ant Anstead and Marc Priestley and there have been 20 series including the Trading Up spin off."
