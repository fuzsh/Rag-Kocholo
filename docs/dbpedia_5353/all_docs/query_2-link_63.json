        "text": "Name: Mike Brewer\n\nSchool: Shippensburg University\n\nPosition: Safety/Rover\n\nHeight: 5-11\n\nWeight: 201\n\nQ: What goals did you set and/or accomplish in your final collegiate season?\n\nGoals that I accomplished were being the most aggressive safety in the conference and getting at least three interceptions.\n\nQ: What would your coaches and teammates say about the type of player you are?\n\nMy coaches and teammates would say that my energy influences those around me. I feel like my energy on the field boosts the team’s confidence all around, and my character is infectious.\n\nQ: When you are studying film, what are the things you focus on to improve your game?\n\nI focus on the personnel and field position to see what plays other teams go to in those situations. I also look at the tendencies of the receivers during certain plays to see if they give off any cues when it’s a pass or run play.\n\nQ: What separates you from the other pro prospects at your position?\n\nWhat’s separates me from other pro prospects is my love for the game and my determination to be great. I love this game so much that i’ll make sure to do everything in my power to be the best I can be.\n\nQ: What is your offseason plan to train and prepare for professional opportunities?\n\nMy offseason plan is to stay in the weight room consistently and continue to perfect my craft on the field.\n\nQ: What kind of strengths and abilities will you bring to a team that will stand out both on and off the field?\n\nOn the field I will bring aggression and passion that transfers to the rest of the team. Off the field I will bring a strong bonding foundation that will allow me to better understand my teammates and show my character as a person.\n\nQ: What is your final pitch to the NFL and any other pro leagues?\n\nMy final pitch to pro leagues is that I am the type of player that welcomes all opportunities, and I embrace each opportunity as a way to prove myself. I am the type of player that values every snap on special teams and defense because I know what it’s like to not have the opportunity to play the game that I love and I am prepared to do anything to show every coach out there that I am willing to give 110% in everything I do to prove that I am the player that I market myself to be."
