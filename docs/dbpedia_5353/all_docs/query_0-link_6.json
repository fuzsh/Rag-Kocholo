        "text": "Surrounded by motors all his life as his dad was heavily involved in car customizing, Mike discovered his passion for motoring as a teenager and knew this would be his career.\n\nHe entered the motor trade, quickly building a reputation for being sharp and honest, and had the biggest 4×4 centre in the south of England up and running in no time, importing cars from around the globe.\n\nMike embarked on his television career through pure luck. He answered a friend’s telephone and discovered he was talking to a television producer. A long chat and a few anecdotes ensued and he was hired for the first series of Deals On Wheels.\n\nHis success in this role led him into the presenter’s position on Driven for Channel 4, followed by Auto Trader, Pulling Power, Deals on Wheels, Wrecks to Riches, and Revved-up as well as several other non- motoring programmes for Discovery Channel and ITV.\n\nBut it was Discovery’s Wheeler Dealers that struck the heart and the toolbox of petrolheads all over the world. Working with his best mate Edd China, Mike and the team have made 13 series, 135 episodes, and restored 100 cars to create Discovery Channel’s flagship show.\n\nAt the end of series 13, Edd decided to leave the show and was replaced with fellow British mechanic and car designer Ant Anstead. After 4 series with Ant and 80 cars together in California, the decision was made to move the show back to the UK. The Global success of Mike’s other venture Wheeler dealers dream Car had Discovery Channel commissioning another series in the UK with ex Formula 1 Mechanic Mark (Elvis) Priestly. Elvis will be joing Mike in the shop for the new series of Wheeler Dealers as well as Dream Car. Ant will still be popping in but he’s decided to stay in the USA with his family.\n\nNow broadcast in 217 territories with a global audience of over 200million. Such is the success and global appeal of Wheeler Dealers, Mike created Wheeler Dealer Trading Up, a series that showcases his motoring knowledge, an eye for a bargain and his selling skills as he trades cars around the world.\n\nIn 2010, Mike took on his biggest motoring challenge ever – Frontline Battle Machines. He travelled to the frontline in war-torn Afghanistan to see what machinery the troops had to work with in one of the most dangerous places on earth. He got more than he bargained for when he was caught in an attack and won a new legion of fans with soldiers all over the world grateful for his insight into their working conditions.\n\nMike has also presented televised motorsport events such as The British Rally Championships and the Isle of Man TT as well as being a fan favourite at motoring exhibitions all over the world including the UK’s biggest classic motoring show.\n\nStill a car trader at heart, Mike recently has opened Mike Brewer Motors dealerships in Luton and Sheffield along with his wife Michelle. He has also launched the only annual awards for used car dealers in the UK.\n\nMike has won many awards including the Royal Television Society’s Best In-Vision Personality and Broadcast Journalist of the Year twice.\n\nPatron of Seesaw Oxford Charity and the Sporting Bears Motor Club, Mike can often be seen at live events raising money for good causes.\n\nChairman of Coventry Transport Museum and ambassador for Ben Charity, Gardx and Ford.! Phew how’s he squeeze it all in?"
