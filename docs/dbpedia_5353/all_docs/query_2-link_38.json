        "text": "Mr. Brewer\n\nFirst, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mike Brewer and I’ll be your child’s fourth-grade teacher for the 2024-2025 school year. This is my 30th year of teaching. I’m very excited about being in this school district and especially proud to be a member of the best staff in the district. I believe that third grade is a pivotal year for children and I’m committed to giving your child the very best education possible. At this stage of the year, I believe children are like caterpillars, and as the year progresses, they will blossom into beautiful butterflies. I have many new and challenging activities planned to make your child’s third-grade experience a truly memorable one. Our classroom theme this year is, “Try Not! Do or Do Not, there is NO TRY!\" Yes, I am a Star Wars child, and yes Yoda will be quoted many times throughout the year.\n\nIn 2012, I married my friend and lifelong companion, Ann. She is an amazing woman and a fantastic teacher. Many of you knew her as Ms. Kuentz. She has two wonderful boys Austin and Kevin. Kevin is an Air Traffic Controller in Virginia. He loves his job and is looking forward to possibly finding a job closer to home. Austin is living in Arizona and loving life. Austin works for a company that wraps vehicles in a protective film to keep them from getting scratched while protecting the paint from the elements. He is married to a wonderlul lady named Hailey. They have two amazing children named Kelsey (4) and Cade (1). Before Austin worked in this industry he was a professional Scooter rider.

It was a wonderful time in my life as I had just begun what has turned out to be an amazing career in teaching and at the same time discovered a love for technology. While at Adams Elementary School, I took on the role of Technology Coordinator, helping my staff discover new and exciting ways to infuse technology into the classroom. I was also lucky enough to be asked to start an after-school science program that helped underprivileged students get an introduction to the world of science.\n\nI received my Bachelors Degree in Liberal Studies from Cal State Fullerton in 1992, my Professional Clear Teaching Credential from Concordia University in 1995, and a Master's Degree in Educational Administration from Cal State San Marcos in 2008.\n\nMission for the class\n\nMy mission is simple. I want every child who comes through my door to gain the knowledge, understanding, and excitement that goes with lifelong learning. I want my children to leave class every day thinking about what they have learned and then trying to add on to their learning at home. As a great artist once said, \" The artwork is already within the stone, all I do is help it escape into the light.\" I feel the same way about our children. The knowledge is already within each of them. It's my job to help them discover what they already know.\n\nClassroom Goals:\n\nMotivate children to do their best.\n\nUnlock a student's imagination through exploration.\n\nChallenge students' creativity through new experiences.\n\nInspire individuality.\n\nCreate compassionate, caring, thoughtful, and considerate members of society.\n\nIntroduce and expand students' ability to think for themselves.\n\nEmpower students to gain knowledge which leads to lifelong learning.\n\nInteresting Facts about Mr. Brewer:\n\nFull Name: Michael Cary Brewer\n\nBirthday: July 28\n\nColors: Primary colors – yellow, blue\n\nChildren’s Author: Margarett Haddix\n\nAdult author: Wilbur Smith\n\nFood: Sea Food & Mexican\n\nDrinks: Jamba Juice - Peanut Butter Mood\n\nSounds: The sound a ball makes as it lands in the bottom of a cup on the golf course.\n\nSeason: Winter\n\nHobby: Golf & Wood Working\n\nSports Teams: Chargers, Angels, Lakers, and Kings"
