All cars will be sold by Silverstone Auctions at the upcoming NEC Classic Motor Show on Saturday 13th November from 1pm. The catalogue for the final Silverstone Auctions sale of 2021 boasts over 130 classic and collector cars, as well as 96 motorcycles and dozens of automobile items. Included in the catalogue is a collection of five vehicles from automotive television personality Mike Brewer. First up for sale is a remarkable 1972 Citroen SM 2.7 four-seat coupe. This 2.7 SM was purchased by Mr Brewer in a sorry state a few years ago before going through a full strip-down and restoration. It was later unveiled on stage at the 2018 NEC Classic Motor Show, to rapturous applause. The car has since gone on to win a Concours d'Elegance trophy at the National Citroen event, as well as to feature in a soon-to-be-released episode of 'The Grand Tour'. Next up is a stunning 1967 Mini Cooper 1275 S, a car regularly used by John Cooper himself. The vehicle has a fascinating history, having been purchased by American car enthusiast Phil Reed, before shipping it back to California in the 1980s to add to his growing collection. Fast-forward 40 years, and by pure coincidence, Mike was viewing the Phil Reed collection whilst filming for Wheeler Dealer. After recognising the vehicle, a deal was struck, and the car was repatriated to UK shores more than 40 years later. A striking red, floor-start 1961 Austin Seven Mini 1961 was also snapped up from Phil Reed's small car collection. After sadly passing away some years earlier, the Phil Reed collection was left to his two sons, but they did not share the same passion for cars as their father and were happy to listen to offers - fortunately for Mike.
