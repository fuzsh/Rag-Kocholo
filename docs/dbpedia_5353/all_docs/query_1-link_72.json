        "text": "WHEELER Dealers host Mike Brewer has announced the start date of his new series after wrapping up production.\n\nThe much-loved programme now looks set to push boundaries and search for broken-down bangers in pastures new.\n\nThe presenter posted on X, former Twitter, that the new show will land on screens on April 29 at 9pm.\n\nHe wrote: \"Great day promoting the brand new series #wheelerdealers #worldtour with f1elvis...starts 9pm 29th April on DiscoveryUK stream after on discoveryplusUK.\"\n\nWheeler Dealers' spin-off programme will launch on Discovery+ following Warner Bros announcement that MotorTrend+ was being discontinued.\n\nFans will now be able to access the content on Discovery+ in the UK and HBO Max in the US instead.\n\nBrewer has previously teased the upcoming series in a video shared on X, where he can be seen in the recording booth with his co-host Marc Priestley.\n\nHe captioned the clip: \"Cracking Voice over session with @f1elvis yesterday.. we believe this world tour series will be the best yet.. coming in a few weeks to @DiscoveryUK the rest of the world follows soon.\"\n\nThe popular motor show's fans have rejoiced as they waited for the programme to return.\n\nOne person commented: \"Great work guys, can't wait to watch the fruits of your labours.\"\n\nAnother one added: \"Mike, you and Elvis always smash it. Every series i think that's the best. Then you make it even better. Really looking forward to it.\"\n\n\"I cannot wait to see this. Really looking forward to seeing you guys back on the tv,\" someone else wrote.\n\nWheeler Dealers World Tour is set to document the team's global travels, hunting down some of the best and most interesting cars on the planet.\n\nThe tour included a collaboration with popular motoring YouTuber Tavarish, known to Mike as Freddie, whose workshop they were filming in.\n\nThe show is set to take in locations across Europe, North America and even Down Under on the hunt for old motors to restore.\n\nMike teased that this would include a build of a McLaren P1 in collaboration with Freddie at his workshop in Miami.\n\nThat particular car is worth in excess of £1million and similar models have been known to sell for as much as £14million.\n\nThe star also hinted at some additions to his own car collection, saying: \"I've asked Freddie to make some more room in the workshop to build a bigger collection of cars.\"\n\nAnd Freddie joked: \"We're just going to outfit this entire thing with really nice cars.\n\n\"You know, the difference between hoarding and collecting is presentation.\n\n\"Just put it in a nice box somewhere, with some nice lighting.\""
