You see, we have led a considerable number of people through deliverance and have seen their lives change. As He has set others free, it is His great desire to set you free as well. This manual will give you the tools, insights, and practical prayers you need for your total freedom.\n\nWhat does a modern-day apostle look like? How does an apostle function, and what is their role within the Body of Christ? Why do we still need the Apostolic gift today?\n\nMany believers have asked these questions and more in regard to the role and gifting of an Apostle. The gift of the Apostle is greatly needed and still exists today, but many believers have struggled to define and understand this important gift given by Jesus Christ Himself.\n\nMost people are not oblivious to the fact that living in another culture contains challenges and difficulties. Our lives have been no exception to trials. We have endured hardships most people never dream of going through, all in just a matter of a few years. From surviving the greatest natural disaster in our lifetime, to multiple miscarriages, to seeing the supernatural provision of God through the death of a child, we want you to share in the journey God has taken us on: a journey of His mighty miracles and amazing power.\n\nREQUEST MIKE\n\nWith a unique ability to connect with audiences and leave a lasting impact, Mike's dynamic speaking style will undoubtedly uplift and inspire all who attend.
