        "text": "WHEELERS Dealers host Mike Brewer has given a major update on the show's filming after a streaming app was discontinued.\n\nWarner Bros. recently announced that MotorTrend+ was being discontinued, with content moving over to Discovery+ and Max.\n\nFans of Mike Brewer's Wheelers Dealers have questioned whether the show will be available in the US.\n\nOne fan posted a message on X , which read: \"When will it be available in the US? It looks great.\n\n\"As an aside, I was looking for Wheelerdealers on MotorTrend+ recently, and I found out the app was discontinued. It is now part of Discovery+, which I guess saves me money.\"\n\nMike responded to the fan, posting: \"Wheeler Dealers is now available on HBO Max in the US.\"\n\nMike recently hit back at haters who brought up his former friend and co-host, Edd China.\n\nIn a bitter message on X, former Twitter, one fan wrote: \"Where's Edd? It was his show.\"\n\nThe troll was referring to the ex-presenter of Wheeler Dealer, Edd China, who worked alongside Brewer for 13 series since 2003.\n\nIn response, Brewer hit back at the mean keyboard warrior, saying: \"You monumental bellend!\"\n\nThe fans have praised Brewer's reaction to the hate, calling it an \"epic comeback\".\n\nOne person wrote: \"Love it Mike! For every tosser 100000 people love ya!\"\n\nAnother one added: \"A few havent moved on. Shame really there missing a good show.\"\n\nA third person said: \"Mike who woke up coma boy, the big fella has been gone years.\"\n\nSomeone else wrote: \"Don't hold back, Mike!\"\n\nOther users have advised Brewer not to engage in the back-and-forth with the haters.\n\nOne fan said: \"Mike - sometimes, you cannot fix stupid!\"\n\nAnother added: \"You're genuine and a top bloke. Ignore these c**kwombles.\"\n\nSomeone else wrote: \"I donâ€™t know why you give them the time of day Mike. Just ignore the prick.\"\n\nChina left the show due to a \"slight disagreement\" over the direction of the programme in 2017.\n\nHe was replaced on the show by Ant Anstead in 2018, and two years later by Marc 'Elvis' Priestley.\n\nChina's sudden departure sparked rumours of feud between the two presenters.\n\nChina said in a YouTube video at the time: \"Is he [Brewer] my favourite person right now? Probably not. And I know for sure that I am not his.\n\n\"But that's okay. We're both adults. We'll get over ourselves. We're gonna get past this and then we'll be fine.\"\n\nThe duo continued to assure that they remained on good terms, but Brewer later admitted that he was \"hurt\" by China's exit."
