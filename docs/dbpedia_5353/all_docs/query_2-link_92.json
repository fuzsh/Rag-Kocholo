        "text": "Wheeler Dealers host Mike Brewer has called out social media users who have questioned how profits are used on the hit TV show.\n\nViewers had supposedly contacted Mike to ask about the financial side of the hit classic car restoration programme.\n\nSome had seemingly called out producers for not including average salaries paid to the duo for their time on the show.\n\nHowever, Mike has suggested this never comes into the equation with the duo sharing out the profits after a successful sale.\n\nSpeaking via his X account, Mike said: “Just responding to the stuff on Twitter about profit. The show has been going for 20 years. Me and Edd, me and Ant and me and Elvis I think we have explained this over and over and over again.\n\nREAD MORE Wheeler Dealers host Mike Brewer gives new update in hunt for stolen Ford Fiesta\n\n“We are not a serviced garage, if I buy a car for £5,000, spend £4,000 on it and sell it for £10,000. I made a grand profit. It’s not hard to work it out.\n\n“But yes in the real world it would cost more for labour costs but we‘re not a serviced garage, We are just two guys fixing up cars and we are happy to take £1,000 profit.\n\n“If you hear me say it in the show, that’s what happened. There are no hidden costs, The only hidden cost you sometimes see is safety items like a new set of tyres.\n\n“I get sponsored by a tyre company so they give them for free so I can't put a price on for tyres when they put them on for free.”\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nFuzz Townshend agrees with Mike Brewer on tip for all classic car owners [LATEST]\n\nWheeler Dealers Mike Brewer shows off ‘chaotic’ life away from TV series [ANALYSIS]\n\nWheeler Dealers' Mike Brewer lost hundreds on ‘worst car’ ever after MOT fail [COMMENT]\n\nSocial media users quickly came to Mike’s defence, suggesting he didn’t need to explain how the show worked 20 years on from its first broadcast.\n\nX user @DavidHoughton84 said: “Bloody hell Mike, it’s such a shame that you have to keep explaining everything after all these years. It’s getting old now.”\n\n@nickinnocent explained: “Why do people don't get it? If I change the brake pads on my car I don’t charge myself labour.\n\n“The whole point has been about saving money by learning to DIY.” (sic)\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

If it's done within the workshop by Elvis it didn’t cost a penny cause he did it and we are going to sell the car for a product,\n\n“If we get a profit then great. If we don’t then it doesn't matter because we saved the car and put it on the road.”"
