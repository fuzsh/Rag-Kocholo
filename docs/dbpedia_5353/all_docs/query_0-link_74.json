        "text": "Wheeler Dealers star Mike Brewer has turned down the chance to refurbish a classic Vauxhall after a “brutal” simple two-word response on social media.\n\nX user David James (@jamojamo1812) contacted the TV host alongside a picture of a bright blue Vauxhall Astra before offering the model up to be worked on.\n\nHe posted: “Hi Mike. If you ever feel like refurbishing a 2004 Astra SRI. I have a nice one.”\n\nMany social media users were impressed with the Vauxhall with one admitting the vehicle was “nostalgic”.\n\nDavid even described the almost 20-year-old Vauxhall Astra as a “hidden gem”.\n\nREAD MORE Dyson Airstrait hair tool 'dries and straightens hair in half the time'\n\nHowever, half an hour later Mike turned down the offer with a simple “no thanks” response.\n\nWheeler Dealers fans were quick to react to the two-word reply with one social media user simply posting “brutal”.\n\nX account @tomlee80 added: “Oh Mike. I really feel for the poor guy now.” Social media user @northlooper commented: “Looks like someone already has!”\n\nHours later, David revealed he plans to put the vehicle on the market but admitted he would be “sad to see it go”.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nWheeler Dealers co-host praises iconic British supercar - ‘an absolute weapon’ [LATEST]\n\nTop Gear star ‘not worried’ about classic cars and shares Wheeler Dealer's view [ANALYSIS]\n\nWheeler Dealers' Mike Brewer hits back at 'ridiculous' response to hacking chaos [COMMENT]\n\nDavid revealed he was undertaking some restoration work on the Astra before it would be available for purchase.\n\nHe explained he was sorting out a leak and that a new compressor may have to be fitted as well.\n\nDavid said: “I will be selling it. There are a couple of things that need fixing. Driver's seat needs a bit of upholstery repair and the air conditioning needs fixing.\n\n“Maybe a leak or at worst a new compressor. I’m sorting that out. The bodywork has a few little dents and scratches.”\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Specifications show the Astra could reach 0-60 mph in 10.1 seconds.\n\nAccording to Parkers, motorists could expect to secure a second-hand Astra model for between £615 and £1,980.\n\nThe model was an iconic machine of the mid-noughties and is still fondly remembered by former owners.\n\n@v8fettler reacted: “Ah man, if that had have been a five-door, that would’ve been exactly the car I had when I was 21. Are you looking to sell, or just want it restoring? Would you consider renting it to a silly nostalgic 43yo?”"
