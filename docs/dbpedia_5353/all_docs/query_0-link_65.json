Being a former car dealer, turned TV presenter, i dont think he will go back to his roots full time. Hes a TV presenter now and it would be seen as a 'backwards step' in his career to be working full time in a car dealership, even if he does own it. I dont believe he will be at the dealership much.\n\nBrennan\n\nRMS Regular\n\nMessages\n\n6,610\n\nDrives\n\nBMW\n\nDan\n\nRMS Regular\n\nMessages\n\n8,974\n\n4 Feb 2013\n\n#3\n\nmabye a trip to mikes motors could finally sort out your which executive saloon dilemma and give us some peace\n\nPeteMoore\n\nRMS Regular\n\nMessages\n\n13,430\n\nLocation\n\nCo.

With little to no faults.

Based on Wheelers Dealers who wouldnt, buys cheap and in need of repair and Ed knows his stuff. Cars are usually really well sorted afterwards, and after buying off him from a show like that or his dealership you would have alot more than a leg to stand on if it went t*ts up.\n\nBased on the cossie, Jag, 6 series etc etc id have no bother buying from him.

Very early days had low low budgets with the cars already in a sorry state.\n\nCheck out the current episodes: Jaguar MK2, BMW Isetta, TVR S2, Ferrari Dino, Fiat 500, BMW 840Ci and Corvette just to name a few. In my opinion since the show took off and the budget was increased, the extent and quality of their work has really came to light. No expense spared really. I wouldn't hesitate to buy a car from them.\n\nCoog\n\nAdmin\n\nMessages\n\n48,208\n\nDrives\n\nGTI\n\n5 Feb 2013\n\n#23\n\nBe some difference in the budget for a TV show and one for a showroom though. Sure ed spends ages fixing the cars up and then mike sells them at no profit lol. Doubt it'd be the same at the showroom.\n\nI'm sure they're no worse or better than any other place tbh.\n\nmx5 turbo\n\nRMS Regular\n\nMessages\n\n2,433\n\nLocation\n\nBangor\n\nDrives\n\nit hard\n\n5 Feb 2013\n\n#24\n\nHe's a clown that man, no respect for a classic car.
