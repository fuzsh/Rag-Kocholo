What Chris did is NOT acceptable, and WWE wants to ensure that people know that WWE had no knowledge of the events, and did not want anyone to make a connection that perhaps they did. It is in fact, a smart and proper business move.\n\n\n\nThe WWE has released another message:\n\n\n\n****\n\nOriginally Posted by WWE.com\n\nWWE/Chris Benoit timeline\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten: June 26, 2007\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, June 23, Chris Benoit was slated to appear at a WWE live event in Beaumont, Texas. That afternoon, Benoit contacted WWE to inform them that his wife and child were ill, and that he would not be able to attend the show.\n\n\n\nWWE executives rebooked Benoit's flight for the following morning, allowing Benoit to miss the Beaumont event making alternate arrangements for him to attend the pay-per-view event in Houston on Sunday.\n\n\n\nWWE employees attempted to confirm with Benoit his travel plans but were unable to contact him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Sunday morning, between 3:51 and 3:58 a.m., Benoit sent five text messages to co-workers:\n\n\n\nText Message 1 to two co-workers (sent 6/24 at 3:53am)- Chris Benoit's cell phone\n\n?????????My physical address is 130 Green Meadow Lane, Fayetteville Georgia. 30215?????????\n\n\n\nText Message 2 to two co-workers (sent 6/24 at 3:53am)- Chris Benoit's cell phone\n\n?????????The dogs are in the enclosed pool area. Garage side door is open?????????\n\n\n\nText Message 3 to two co-workers (sent 6/24 at 3:54am)- Nancy Benoit's cell phone\n\n?????????My physical address is 130 Green Meadow Lane.\n\nFayetteville Georgia. 30215?????????\n\n\n\nText Message 4 to two co-workers (sent 6/24 at 3:55am)- Nancy Benoit's cell phone\n\n?????????My physical address is 130 Green Meadow Lane.\n\nFayetteville Georgia. 30215\"\n\n\n\nText Message 5 to one co-worker (sent 6/24 at 3:58am)- Nancy Benoit's cell phone\n\n?????????My address is 130 Green Meadow Lane. Fayetteville Georgia. 30215?????????\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the day on Sunday, WWE made numerous attempts to contact Benoit both at home and at local hospitals in the Atlanta area. As of 11:00 p.m., WWE officials were unable to establish contact with Chris Benoit.\n\n\n\nAt 12:30 p.m. on Monday, June 25, WWE officials were notified of the text messages sent to the co-workers the previous day. By 12:45 p.m., WWE had contacted Fayetteville County Sheriff?????????s office requesting they check on the Benoit family.\n\n\n\nFayetteville County Sheriffs office made contact with WWE at approximately 4:00 p.m. advising that they had entered the house of Chris Benoit and found three deceased bodies ????????? an adult male, adult female and a male child. WWE was told that Benoit's home was now considered a major crime scene.\n\n\n\nThe decision to cancel the live event scheduled in Corpus Christi that night was made between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. In keeping with company policy, and with limited knowledge regarding facts of the case, WWE choose to air a memorial dedicated to the career of Chris Benoit. As facts emerged surrounding the case, all tributes to Chris Benoit were removed both on-air and on WWE.com.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nAllow me to add though that I agree with you ... I too will miss him. He was always one of my favorites and one that I cheered for regularly.\n\nSometimes the best thing to say is nothing at all."
