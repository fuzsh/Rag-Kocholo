I just can't believe how many people can kill their families including their own children, it's disgusting. Hopefully facts will come out that disprove the murder/suicide, especially since Benoit was looked up to by lots of kids around the world.\n\nYeah I've been reading several articles on the Internet over the past couple hours from online newspapers and such. The police believe it was a double murder-suicide as there was no evidence of forced entry and the bodies were found in 3 separate rooms. The articles also further stated that the \"instruments\" that were used to kill his wife and son were inside the house but never said what those instruments were. When I first heard about this, I thought it was a heat of the moment type deal (which I hope it wasn't) but to fly himself home, it seems kind of premeditated...especially when one report says that Nancy and Daniel could have been dead as early as Saturday night. That same article says that they believe Benoit killed himself Monday...it's still hard to fathom. If Benoit did do this, then I agree...he deserves nothing. My guess is that if he did do this it was a heat of the moment/rage/passion murder then when he came down from that emotion realized what he did and took his life.By God I hope I'm wrong."
