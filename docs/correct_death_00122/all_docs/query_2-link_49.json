        "text": "Chris Benoit, a WWE wrestler who was a\n\nformer world heavyweight and Intercontinental champion, was found\n\ndead in his home in a possible murder-suicide. He was 40.\n\nLt. Tommy Pope of the Fayette County Sheriff's Department said\n\nthe bodies of Benoit, his wife, Nancy, and 7-year-old son, Daniel,\n\nwere discovered around 2:30 p.m. Monday, but he refused to release\n\ndetails. Pope said the deaths were being investigated as homicides,\n\nand that autopsies were to be performed Tuesday.\n\nWAGA-TV said investigators believe Benoit killed his wife and\n\nson over the weekend, then himself on Monday.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment said on its Web site that it asked\n\nauthorities to check on Benoit and his family after being alerted\n\nby friends who received \"several curious text messages sent by\n\nBenoit early Sunday morning.\"\n\nBenoit, who also held several tag-team titles during his career,\n\nwas scheduled to perform at the \"Vengeance\" pay-per-view event\n\nSunday night in Houston, but was replaced at the last minute\n\nbecause of what announcer Jim Ross called \"personal reasons.\"\n\nThe native of Canada maintained a home in metro Atlanta from the\n\ntime he wrestled for the defunct World Championship Wrestling.\n\nThe WWE canceled its live \"Monday Night RAW\" card in Corpus\n\nChristi, Texas, and USA Network aired a three-hour tribute to\n\nBenoit in place of the scheduled wrestling telecast."
