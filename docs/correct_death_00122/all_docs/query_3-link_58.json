Depicts the life of Chris Benoit, a Canadian-born wrestler whose life took a tragic turn after he murdered his family and took his own life. Before anyone had heard of Vince McMahon, WWE Raw or Friday Night Smackdown, a true wrestling tradition took place on Friday nights in the Stampede Grounds of Calgary and some of those who wrestled here would become the biggest names in the industry. These included the likes of Andre The Giant, Owen Hart, The Junkyard Dog, Davey Boy Smith and Chris Benoit, but soon one by one each of them would prematurely die along with many other graduates of Stampede Wrestling following the same faith. In the past decade and a half, a dozen of them have died at an average age of just 41.",
