Benoit enjoyed an iconic career in the ring, winning 22 championships, becoming a household wrestling name.\n\nHowever, the 40-year-old sent shockwaves rippling through the wrestling world and beyond in a tragic murder-suicide at his Fayatteville, Georgia home. Just days before his death Benoit competed in his last match, which set him up for a championship showdown five days later.\n\nREAD MORE: Drug lord's satanic cult beheaded and boiled Spring Breaker called Mark in voodoo ritual\n\nClick for more news coming out of the US from the Daily Star.\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\nBy the time of the match, Benoit, his wife Nancy, and their son Daniel were dead. On the June 19 episode of ECW in 2007, Benoit defeated Elijah Burke in a match to determine who would compete for the vacated ECW World Championship at Vengeance on June 24.\n\nBut then Benoit missed the weekend house shows, telling WWE officials that his wife and son were vomiting blood due to food poisoning. When he failed to show up for the pay-per-view, viewers were informed that he was unable to compete due to a \"family emergency\".\n\n(Image: Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nHe was replaced in the title match by Johnny Nitro (later known as John Morrison), who won the match and became ECW World Champion. The crowd spent the majority of the match chanting for Benoit.\n\nHowever, the grim reality of what had happened to the Canadian unfolded just 24 hours, as it emerged that Benoit was dead, as was his wife and son by his hands. However the grisly truth wouldn't emerge until a few days later.\n\nWith the circumstances of his death unclear, WWE ran a three-hour tribute show to an empty arena for the next night's edition of Monday Night Raw. But as the details emerged the company wiped all traces of Benoit from its website.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nBenoit had murdered his wife and son on June 22, 2007, and hanged himself two days later. Ex-referee Marty Elias revealed the \"surreal\" mood backstage as WWE learned of Benoit's death.\n\nHe told a Q&A session: \"When everybody found out, it was the meeting with Vince and Stephanie. They pulled everybody together, and that’s when they made the announcement. I mean it was so surreal. Everybody were scratching their heads, and I remember people dispersing, and going off and crying. People just literally being in shock and awe.\n\nHe continued: \"When they found out that it was a murder-suicide . . . everything just kind of stood still. We had another talent meeting, and we were advised that we weren’t gonna do anything for Chris.\n\n(Image: findagrave.com)\n\n\"It was just a whole different vibe. I’ve been backstage at WWE so many times, but that particular instance, during that whole time, was a whole different vibe.\"\n\nResearch later showed that depression and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a condition of brain damage developed from several concussions during his wrestling career, were contributing factors to his crime. Despite that, in recent years, wrestling legends such as Kurt Angle and Chris Jericho have been more open to talking about Benoit's in-ring career, with the pair both calling him one of the \"best\" to ever wrestle.\n\n(Image: @davidbenoit1/Instagram)\n\nBenoit's other son David is currently training to be a wrestler, and has openly said that he wants to use his father's theme song Whatever by Our Lady Peace when he debuts.\n\nFor emotional support, you can call the Samaritans 24-hour helpline on 116 123, email jo@samaritans.org, visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website.\n\nJoin the Daily Star's WhatsApp for the sexiest headlines, showbiz gossip and lots more The Daily Star is now on WhatsApp and we want you to join us!
