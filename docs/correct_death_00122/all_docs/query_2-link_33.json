After over two decades in the sport, winning 22 championships, Benoit's legacy will forever be marked by his horrifying final act.\n\nAt 40 years old, Benoit shocked the wrestling world and beyond when he killed his family and himself in their Georgia home. A few days earlier, Benoit appeared in his final match which was supposed to lead to a championship event five days later.\n\nBy the time that match came around, Benoit, his wife Nancy, and their son Daniel were all dead. On the June 19 episode of ECW in 2007, Benoit beat Elijah Burke to earn a shot at the vacant ECW World Championship at Vengeance on June 24, reports the Daily Star.\n\n'Proof of time travel' as King Henry Vlll spotted with popular fast food\n\nPuzzling 1917 photo of 'surfer dude' sparks wild claims time travel is real\n\nBut Benoit never showed up for scheduled events over the weekend, instead telling WWE bosses that his wife and son were vomiting blood because of food poisoning. Benoit then did not appear for the pay-per-view, with viewers told he could not compete because of a \"family emergency\".\n\nHe was replaced in the title match by Johnny Nitro (later known as John Morrison), who won the match and became ECW World Champion. The crowd spent the majority of the match chanting for Benoit.\n\nHowever, the grim reality of what had happened to the Canadian unfolded just 24 hours later, as it emerged that Benoit was dead, as was his wife and son by his hands.\n\nWith the circumstances of his death unclear, WWE ran a three-hour tribute show to an empty arena for the next night's edition of Monday Night Raw. But as the details emerged the company wiped all traces of Benoit from its website.\n\nBenoit had murdered his wife and son on June 22, 2007, and hanged himself two days later. Ex-referee Marty Elias revealed the \"surreal\" mood backstage as WWE learned of Benoit's death.\n\nHe told a Q&A session: \"When everybody found out, it was the meeting with Vince and Stephanie. They pulled everybody together, and that's when they made the announcement. I mean it was so surreal. Everybody were scratching their heads, and I remember people dispersing, and going off and crying. People just literally being in shock and awe.\"\n\nHe continued: \"When they found out that it was a murder-suicide everything just kind of stood still. We had another talent meeting, and we were advised that we weren't gonna do anything for Chris.\n\n\"When they found out that it was a murder-suicide... everything just stood still. We had another talent meeting, and we were told that we wouldn't be doing anything for Chris.\n\n\"It was just a whole different vibe. I've been backstage at WWE so many times, but that particular instance, during that whole time, was a whole different vibe.\"\n\nLater on, it was established that mental health issues and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is a former of brain damage from too taking too many hits to the head while wrestling helped contribute to his actions. But these days, famous wrestlers like Kurt Angle and Chris Jericho have become more open with talking about how good Benoit was in the ring.\n\nThey both said he was one of the \"best\" wrestlers ever. Benoit's other son David is learning to be a wrestler too, and he has said he wants to use his dad's entrance music, \"Whatever\" by Our Lady Peace, when he starts wrestling.\n\nFor the latest local news and features on Irish America, visit our homepage here."
