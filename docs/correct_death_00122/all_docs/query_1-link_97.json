        "text": "FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. (AP) - Investigators stand by the initial conclusion that pro wrestler Chris Benoit killed his wife and 7-year-old son and then himself in their suburban Atlanta home last June.\n\nThe Fayette County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday it has closed its investigation, adding there is no evidence \"that indicates the presence of any other individual or individuals who contributed to the deaths of the three members of the Benoit family.\"\n\nAuthorities have said the 40-year-old wrestler strangled his wife with a cord, used a choke hold to strangle his son, placed Bibles next to the bodies and hanged himself on a piece of exercise equipment the weekend of June 22, 2007, in their Fayetteville home.\n\nLt. Belinda McCastle, a sheriff's spokeswoman, said that while there was never any evidence to suggest a different conclusion, investigators wanted to remove any doubt. Nothing specific prompted Tuesday's announcement, she added.\n\nA medical examiner was unable to say if steroids played a role in the killings, though suspicions linking steroid use to the killings have lingered. Anabolic steroids were found in Benoit's home and tests showed he had roughly 10 times the normal level of testosterone in his system.\n\nBenoit's personal doctor, Phil Astin, faces federal charges of improperly prescribing medication to two patients other than Benoit. More charges are expected.\n\nAuthorities have said Astin prescribed a 10-month supply of anabolic steroids to Benoit every three to four weeks for a year leading to the killings."
