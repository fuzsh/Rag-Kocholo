        "text": "..\n\nThe more I think about this... the more I think that we'll be seeing a lot of MLB-related deaths in the near future just like we've been seeing with WWE (pro wrestling in general) in a long string of premature deaths. Obviously, if the murder-suicide theory pans out (which i truly hope it turns out to be something else), it's not the same as the drug related deaths of Davey Boy Smith, Eddie Guerrero, etc... just got me thinking, though. Baseball and the whole steroid/HGH/performance enhancers era is very much starting to remind me of the Wresling world... and it's scary.\n\nIt's already started with guys like Ken Caminiti, and from what i understand Rod Beck...\n\nI really hope this is not true. The WWE tribute show was full of people saying how intensely private Benoit was so it's really hard to say what was going on in his personal life. But it's still too early to say for sure that this theory is correct. I just can't believe this has happened.\n\n-= CS =-\n\nQuote:\n\nfrom 11Alive, Atlanta NBC Station\n\n\"Pope said officers went to Benoit's residence at the request of WWE officials, who said he had missed professional appearances.\n\nPolice discovered three bodies in the home. Pope said they are presently investigating the deaths as a double murder-suicide. The family's bodies have been taken to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation crime lab, with autopsy results expected sometime during the day on Tuesday.\n\nPolice have sealed Benoit's home, and have withheld some of the details of what they found inside the house, but it is known that a gun was not used in connection with the deaths. Investigators said they will be paying close attention to the toxicology report when autopsy results become available.\"\n\nPoison...\n\nthat's the horrible part ... the WWE and it's wrestlers kept stressing how much he loved his family. They'd show any possible shot they had of Benoit with his kids and wife ...\n\nand if he ended up being the killer ...\n\nIt's not the WWE's fault, but they just paid homage to a murder.\n\nconfirmed ... wwe.com ... Benoit did it."
