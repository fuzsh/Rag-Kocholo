No details were released but the results of autopsies are expected on Tuesday.\n\n\"I am deeply saddened over the loss of Chris Benoit,\" Carl DeMarco, president of WWE Canada said. \"My heartfelt thoughts and sympathy go out to his parents and family.\n\n\"My relationship with Chris has extended many years and I consider him a great friend. Chris was always first-class, warm, friendly, caring and professional. One of the best in our business.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old Benoit was born in Montreal, Canada and moved to Calgary in the mid-1980s where he got his start in professional wrestling under the late Stu Hart.\n\nBenoit later wrestled professionally in Japan before joining the WWE in 2000.\n\nHe was scheduled to appear in a pay-per-view title match on Sunday, but backed out because of a \"family emergency,\" the WWE announced on Sunday.\n\nBenoit went by the ring name the \"Canadian Crippler\" and his signature moves included a flying headbutt, the triple German suplex and the \"Crippler Crossface.\"\n\n-AFP"
