    "text": "ATLANTA - Pro wrestler Chris Benoit strangled his wife and smothered his son before hanging himself in his weight room, a law enforcement official close to the investigation told The Associated Press on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities also said they are investigating whether steroids may have been a factor in the deaths of Benoit, his wife and their 7-year-old son. Steroid abuse has been linked to depression, paranoia, and aggressive behavior or angry outbursts known as \"roid rage.\"\n\n\n\n\"We don't know yet. That's one of the things we'll be looking at,\" said Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard. He said test results may not be back for weeks.\n\n\n\nAutopsies were scheduled Tuesday by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.\n\n\n\nAuthorities were investigating the deaths at a secluded Fayette County home as a murder-suicide and were not seeking any suspects. The official who described the manner of death spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information was to be released at a news conference later Tuesday.\n\n\n\nInvestigators believe Benoit (pronounced ben-WAH) killed his wife, 43-year-old Nancy, and son Daniel during the weekend and then himself Monday. The bodies were found Monday afternoon in three separate rooms of the house, off a gravel road about two miles from the Whitewater Country Club.\n\n\n\nNancy Benoit filed for a divorce in May 2003, saying their three-year union was irrevocably broken and alleging \"cruel treatment.\" But she later dropped the complaint, as well as a request for a restraining order in which she charged that Benoit had threatened her and had broken furniture in their home.\n\n\n\nIn the divorce filing, she said Benoit made more than $500,000 a year as a professional wrestler and asked for permanent custody of Daniel and child support. In his response, Benoit sought joint custody.\n\n\n\nFayette County Coroner C.J. Mowell did not return calls seeking comment. The answering service for his funeral home said he was out of town.\n\n\n\nAsked about the condition of the interior of the house, sheriff's Sgt. Keith Whiteside said investigators found \"nothing really out of the ordinary.\" He said Benoit was found in the home's weight room, his wife in an office and the son in an upstairs bedroom.\n\n\n\nNeighbors said the Benoits led a low-key lifestyle.\n\n\n\n\"We would see Chris walking in his yard from time to time. He wasn't rude, but he wasn't really outwardly warm,\" said Alaina Jones, who lives across the street.\n\n\n\nJimmy Baswell, who was Benoit's driver for more than five years, placed a white wreath at the Benoits' gate. \"They always seemed like they were the happiest people,\" he said."
