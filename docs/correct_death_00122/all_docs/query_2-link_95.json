    "text": "Pro wrestler, family found dead in Georgia home\n\nATLANTA - In an ongoing attempt to outdo itself, the World Wrestling Entertainment recently staged the \"death\" of its chairman in an apparent limousine explosion.\n\nMonday night, the largest wrestling organization in the world grappled with a real-life murder mystery: What led to the death of superstar wrestler Chris Benoit, his wife and child inside their expansive Fayetteville home?\n\nOfficials have not said how the family died, other than to say the deaths did not involve a firearm.\n\n\"The details when they come out,\" said Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard, \"are going to prove a little bizarre.\"\n\nDetective Bo Turner told television station WAGA that the case was being treated as a murder-suicide, but said that couldn't be confirmed until evidence was examined by a crime lab. The station said that investigators believe the 40-year-old Benoit killed his wife, Nancy, and 7-year-old son, Daniel, over the weekend, then himself on Monday. A neighbor called police, and the bodies were found in three rooms.\n\nBenoit was scheduled to perform at the \"Vengeance\" pay-per-view event Sunday night in Houston, but he failed to appear. He was replaced at the last minute because of what announcer Jim Ross called \"personal reasons.\"\n\nAfter his absence Sunday night, WWE became worried. Benoit's employers then called deputies to have them do a welfare check on the family - leading to the discovery, said Sheriff's Lt. Tommy Pope.\n\nDeputies checking on the family discovered the bodies of the 40-year-old wrestler, his wife Nancy and their 7-year-old son Daniel on Monday afternoon at their home on Green Meadow Lane.\n\nBenoit, a native of Canada, maintained a home in metro Atlanta from the time he wrestled for the now-defunct Ted Turner-owned World Championship Wrestling organization.\n\nMost recently, Benoit performed as part of World Wrestling Entertainment.\n\nHe was a former world heavyweight champion, Intercontinental champion and held several tag-team titles over his career.\n\n\"Chris was beloved among his fellow Superstars, and was a favorite among WWE fans for his unbelievable athleticism and wrestling ability. He always took great pride in his performance, and always showed respect for the business he loved, for his peers and towards his fans. This is a terrible tragedy and an unbearable loss. WWE extends its sincerest thoughts and prayers to the Benoit family's relatives and loved ones in this time of tragedy,\" the federation said in a statement on its Web site.\n\nHomicides are rare in Fayette County, particularly so in areas like Green Meadow Lane, a rural stretch of the county where multi-acre mansion-style homes dot the landscape. In 2006, the sheriff's office didn't investigate a single homicide.\n\nThe house is in a secluded neighborhood set back about 60 yards off a gravel road, surrounded by stacked stone wall and a double-iron gate. On Monday night, the house was dark except for a few outside lights. There was a police car in front, along with two uniformed officers.\n\nMeanwhile, fans tried to cope with the news.\n\n\"Obviously, all sorts of speculation are running rampant but I have talked to so many people and nobody really knows (whether the couple was having marital troubles),\" said Bryan Alvarez, who runs Figurefour Weekly, a wrestling newsletter and Web site, from Linwood, Wash.\n\nBenoit began his career in Calgary more than 20 years ago. He wrestled in Japan before returning to North America.\n\nWhile working in Atlanta with WCW, he met his wife, Nancy, who managed several wrestlers and went by the stage name \"Woman.\"\n\nAt the time, her then-husband drew up a script that had the couple involved in a relationship as part of an ongoing storyline.\n\nSoon after, the two became romantically involved in real life and married, Alvarez said. Benoit has two other children from a prior relationship\n\nHe joined WWE in 2000 and four years later won the WWE world heavyweight championship.\n\nThe family had moved into the Fayetteville neighborhood last summer, said a neighbor, Alaina Jones.\n\nNone of the neighbors recalled seeing police at the house before. Monday night, about half a dozen patrol cars idled on the circular driveway of the home.\n\nThe Monday night broadcast of WWE's \"Raw\" on the USA Network was supposed to have been a who-dunnit into the \"death\" of Chairman Vince McMahon, whose limousine exploded moments after he stepped into it after a bout in Wilkes-Barre., Pa., two weeks ago.\n\nThe organization scrapped the storyline following Benoit's death, and instead televised a three-hour retrospective on Benoit's career.\n\n\"My relationship with Chris has extended many years and I consider him a great friend,\" Carl DeMarco, the president of WWE Canada, said in a statement. \"Chris was always first-class - warm, friendly, caring and professional one of the best in our business.\""
