    "text": "The business of professional wrestling rewards appearance over reality, and its carnival traditions of protecting its staged nature from outsiders, particularly its audience, encourages those in the business to believe their fantasy lives are reality. Few wrestlers were more driven to succeed, or successful against such odds, than the Canadian Chris Benoit, but such careers often end in disappointment or tragedy: he killed himself at the age of 40 after killing first his wife Nancy and then his seven-year-old son, at their home in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nSteroid-induced aggression was blamed, since Benoit, a relatively small man at the height of 5ft 9in, faced a constant need to make himself bigger, which meant long-term use of steroids. But the situation was more complex. Years of taking high-flying \"bumps\" in the ring led to serious injuries, and painkillers are part of a wrestler's life. Although Nancy understood the business's demands, their son Daniel suffered from both dwarfism and a form of autism, which meant he needed care that Benoit's schedule left him sometimes unavailable to provide.\n\nBenoit grew up a fan in the wrestling hotbed of Montreal, and his idol was Britain's Tom Billington, the Dynamite Kid, who was becoming a major star in Japan. Following in Billington's footsteps, in 1985 Benoit moved to Calgary, Alberta, to undergo the brutal training given by Stu Hart for his Stampede Wrestling.\n\nAfter four years, he moved to New Japan Pro Wrestling, which had spawned the Dynamite Kid. Within a year, wrestling with a mask as the Pegasus Kid, he captured the IWGP light-heavyweight title from Jushin \"Thunder\" Liger. He had a run in Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling (WCW), while winning New Japan's Super Junior Cup tournament in 1994.\n\nBenoit combined the ability to perform aerial moves with lifting an opponent over the shoulders to slam him down. He was also able to \"brawl\", taking blows with chairs and other foreign objects. His North American breakthrough came in the Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1994, and in WCW he was programmed in a feud against the company's \"booker\" (storyline plotter) Kevin Sullivan, with Sullivan's wife \"Woman\" as bait. Reality followed fantasy, and Nancy Daus wound up leaving Sullivan to marry Benoit.\n\nWeighing 225lbs, in 2000 he became WCW champion, but disagreements with Sullivan prompted him to leave for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), whose heavyweight title he won in 2004. Popular with fellow wrestlers and fans, Benoit won the most outstanding wrestler poll of Wrestling Observer Newsletter twice. However, many of Benoit's contemporaries have died prematurely, due to problems with steroids and other drugs, and the Dynamite Kid has been severely limited by the effects of in-ring injuries. Benoit is survived by two sons from his first marriage.\n\nÂ· Christopher Michael Benoit, wrestler, born May 21 1967; died June 24 2007"
