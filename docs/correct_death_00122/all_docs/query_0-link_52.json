        "text": "On his birthday I was compelled to write about him because despite what he did, I believe that Chris Benoit was one of the greatest wrestlers at his time.\n\nThe accomplishments he had during his time in the business were among the greatest. The reason behind this article is quiet simply...we as fans are being robbed of those accomplishments.\n\nI am a subscriber to WWE 24/7 the channel that allows you to watch hours of WWE programming each month. This includes WCW, ECW, WCCW, NWA, among others. It is truly worth the money that I pay for it every month. As an aspiring wrestler it is nice to study wrestlers of the past, except Chris Benoit.\n\nSince the horrible tragedy that occurred to take the lives of the Benoit family was inexcusable and could be considered cowardly for Chris to take his own life.\n\nI am in no way throughout this article saying that I believe that we should acknowledge Benoits end or say that it was right. I still feel for all those affected by this incident.\n\nMy problem is the fact that everything involving Chris Benoit has been removed from WWE 24/7.\n\nI must admit that the editing is remarkable because if you had never known about Chris Benoit you still wouldn't because there is nothing involving him in any re guard.\n\nI have a problem with this and feel that I am never getting my moneys worth on occasion.\n\nThere are times that I would love to see a good Benoit-Malenko match or Benoit-Angle. Although his life ended in a bad way, Benoit is a part of history regardless of anything else.\n\nBy taking Benoit out of all WWE programming you are surrendering a Royal Rumble, a Wrestlemania Main event and countless world title matches.\n\nNot to mention any other match, the man was great in the ring and gave it his all every night and you can never take that away from him.\n\nIt is my opinion that WWE took him off of their programming not because they messed up in the handling of the situation.\n\nThey dedicated a whole raw to Benoit before even knowing the situation. The WWE messed up and as we all know they hate it when they mess up.\n\nMy solution would be to put a declaimer on the beginning of every program that he would be on.\n\nTell people that he will be on and if you don't want to see it then you don't have to watch it."
