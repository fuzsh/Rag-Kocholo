        "text": "“There is a piece of film footage on the night after the incident where I did, we were doing a show, Raw. And there is an interview with me and people read into this very wrongly. And the consensus that seems to be out there is that I knew more than what was happening. I want to just take this time to put my story out there and let people know this is, because this story is out there. It just that seems to be that nobody wants to pay any attention to it, and they want to sensationalize this into something that isn’t.\n\n“As I am about [to go in], the red light goes off and the door opens. And as I’m going in to give my tribute JBL comes walking out with a very strange look on his face. And he said to me, as we, for about a minute that we’re crossing paths, he just said to me, ‘You don’t think he’s had anything to do with it do you?’ And I went ‘What?’ And that was the first thing, any notion of anything that went on. That was the first time that I’ve heard this.\n\n“And now I’m walking in, and so whatever you see me doing, and that is me being well, now my head is spinning. What is this? What don’t I know? What is that? And so if you watch it from that perspective, it may seem like it, because I am in a complete shock, but also thinking, ‘Well, I don’t know, is it? Is this what’s happened?’ I don’t know. So I just deliver whatever you see, and I have never watched it again.\n\n“Now I know those things have been put out and nonsense about I knew about this or whatnot. That is the exact thing that happened.”"
