It is also believed that Chris Benoit killed himself on Saturday as well. The press conference stated that Chris Benoit died no later than a day after his son's death.\n\nHe stayed in the dang house for two-three days? Man, there must have REALLY been some serious psychological issues going on. It is just too odd ... I think perhaps she was leaving him (and called to tell him) - he went home in a rush - things got heated and out of control - and there you have it.\n\nIn my mind, it is the only thing that makes sense fellas.\n\nSometimes the best thing to say is nothing at all.\n\nOriginally posted by CoAsTeRkRazY\n\nWell, he does look pretty abusive.\n\nWow, you make a comment like that ... and have the nerve to have the avatar you have (which honestly, is no longer funny). I never knew that looks could tell everything about a person's personality. Geesh, how proud your parents must be of your intelligence level finally reaching that of a 3rd grader.\n\nBack on topic .... some impressive comments from Vince right before ECW began. Right to the point -- no confusion about what he said -- the WWE is officially cutting all ties to Chris Benoit and in no way supports anything that he did - to include his career and all but apologized for airing the tribute show last night. Wow.\n\nSometimes the best thing to say is nothing at all."
