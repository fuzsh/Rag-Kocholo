    "text": "First of all being a wrestler for the WWe is hard living. Yeah; he made great money, and was well known, but as a wrestler working for that company; you never get to enjoy that money due to a hectic schedule. The schedule is more than a few days a week and more that a BIT of traveling. Working for the WWe; you are away from home over 300 days a year. Not to mention the stress, and pain put on the body from all of the shows they have to do. Since they have so many show's they tend to turn to steroids to help with the pain. Then things like this happen. Though I don't really condone him doing what he did, I do understand the stress and pain he was in.\n\n\n\nFor those of you who aren't wrestling fans; are quick to judge, but don't know what really goes on in and out of the ring. Though I am 31 years old; I have been watching WWF/E, and WCW since '95. Just from watching the show, and reading up on it; I know most of everything that goes on, in and out of the ring. This is too similar to what happened with Kurt Angle and why he hopped over to TNA. TNA has a very light schedule compared to WWe; due to the fact that they dont travel as often and their weekly shows are taped in a studio in Orlando at Universal Studios. The only time they travel now is for PPV's. Kurt was having the same problem after Eddie Guerrero died; who was Chris Benoit's best friend. After Eddie died Kurt wanted to take some time off because he was having some problems, and Vince wouldn't let him; because he had to be dedicated to his fans. After having such a hard time to get time off with the WWe; he hopped to TNA. After making the switch; he has been feeling alot better. He has time to give his body some rest. It had been reported that Benoit had been in talks with TNA; several weeks ago, but had turned them down due to more money offered by McMahon."
