Over the decades, so many of our favorite wrestlers have died before their time. Some of those stories are more than simply heartbreaking, but shocking, such as Owen Hart's death after a stunt went wrong during a WWE show in 1999. The most shocking wrestler death, however, might belong to someone else, due to the brutality of how it happened. In 2007, Chris Benoit was on top of the wrestling world, but over the course of a weekend, he and his family were dead at his hands. The death of Benoit, no matter how much history has tried to sweep it under the rug, changed WWE and wrestling forever.\n\nChris Benoit Was A Major Name In WWE And WCW\n\nChris Benoit Was In The Main Event Of WrestleMania 20\n\nClose\n\nChris Benoit's career began in 1985 in Stampede Wrestling.\n\nChris Benoit debuted for WWE in 2000.\n\nChris Benoit is a former World Heavyweight Champion, United States Champion, Intercontinental Champion, and WWE Tag Team Champion.\n\nBorn in 1967 in Montreal, Chris Benoit began wrestling at just the age of 18 for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling. He had short stints with WCW and ECW, but it was when he returned to Ted Turner's promotion in 1995 that he began to become one of the top stars in the business. He was a midcarder for a while, receiving attention in Ric Flair's reinvented Four Horseman faction, but it was late in the decade and heading into 2000, as the old stars began to give way to the new, that Benoit became a main eventer. In 2000, he became the WCW World Heavyweight Champion, beating Sid Vicious for the vacant title at the promotion's January event, Souled Out. It was an act of desperation for a crumbling company which didn't work. The next day, Benoit left WCW.\n\nHe was next seen on an episode of Raw with three other former WCW wrestlers (Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, and Perry Saturn) as part of the Radicalz, but as the Attitude Era ended, Benoit quickly became a major singles star, even beating Shawn Michaels and Triple H at WrestleMania 20 for the World Heavyweight Championship. As the show ended, Benoit hugged his wife, Nancy (who was Woman in WCW), and his young son Daniel, as confetti rained down. It was a beautiful moment, but one that is now so difficult to watch.\n\nRelated Why Did Dean Malenko Never Become A Major Star In Pro Wrestling? For all of his technical prowess in the ring, Dean Malenko never became a massive star in the wrestling business.\n\nChris Benoit Didn't Show Up At WWE Vengeance: Night Of Champions In 2007\n\nChris Benoit Was Scheduled For An ECW Championship Match\n\nChris Benoit was scheduled to face CM Punk for the ECW World Championship.\n\nChris Benoit had sent concerning messages to Chavo Guerrero and then stopped communicating altogether.\n\nWWE had initially held a tribute show before they learned details of what happened.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, Benoit was still at the top of the card. At WWE's June pay-per-view, Vengeance: Night of Champions, he was scheduled to face CM Punk for the vacant ECW World Championship. That's when the downfall began. What happened next has been talked about many times by some of those involved, including in a Dark Side of the Ring episode. First, Benoit told WWE and one of his closest friends, Chavo Guerrero, that he and his family were sick that weekend. Then, Chris Benoit sent a concerning text to Chavo telling him that his dogs were in the backyard and the door was open. Soon after, all contact stopped, and no one could reach him. Meanwhile, the show went on, with Johnny Nitro taking Benoit's place on the card.\n\nWhen WWE wasn't able to get a hold of him, the police were called. They arrived at the Benoit home to find a grisly scene. Chris Benoit, Nancy, and Daniel were all dead. It was a Monday, and with no one yet knowing the details, WWE canceled Raw that night and instead aired a tribute show to him, with Vince McMahon speaking to an empty stadium, and WWE Superstars talking in vignettes about what Benoit meant to them. As this was happening, the truth came out. Chris Benoit had murdered his family. He killed Nancy, strangling her, on June 22. The next day, he smothered his seven-year-old son, Daniel. The day after that, Chris Benoit hanged himself from a weight machine in his basement. WWE had just aired a heartfelt tribute to a man who was now revealed to be a killer.\n\nRelated How To Watch Vice TV's 'Dark Side Of The Ring' 'Dark Side of the Ring' premiered on Vice TV in 2019. Four seasons later, it's a must-see show for wrestling fans. Here's where you can find it.\n\nWWE Has Mostly Erased Chris Benoit From Its History\n\nChris Benoit's Death Changed WWE Forever\n\nThe final time WWE ever mentioned Chris Benoit on television was on June 26, 2007.\n\nChris Benoit had the brain of an elderly Alzheimer's patient.\n\nWWE took concussions more seriously after Chris Benoit's death.\n\nThat Tuesday, before an airing of ECW, Vince McMahon spoke to home viewers briefly in a taped segment. He said that because of the truth of what had happened to Chris Benoit now being out, WWE would not mention what had happened any further, instead choosing to focus on the in-ring product for fans. WWE has made no mention of him since. He can be found in every segment he was ever part of on Peacock and the WWE Network, but he is not talked about on TV, never celebrated for his accomplishments, and you'll never see his name in the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nThat doesn't mean that Chris Benoit's heinous actions were forgotten. An autopsy showed that Benoit's brain had advanced CTE from years of wrestling, including the diving headbutt that he performed nightly. He was said to have the brain of an 85-year-old Alzheimer's patient. That led to some positive changes in WWE. Concussions were now taken seriously and those disgusting chair shots to the head disappeared from the company. Watch WWE in the past and you'll see headshots delivered weekly. Today, every chair shot is given safely to the back instead.\n\nWWE is justified in never speaking his name. Without excusing his crimes, he was also a very sick man in his final days, his brain ravaged by an advanced disease. While many acknowledge what he did in the ring, it is also impossible to separate Benoit from the horrible acts that he committed. Whatever accolades Benoit acquired in his career, they do not matter in comparison to what he did.\n\nWrestlers Have Weighed In On Chris Benoit's Legacy\n\nPaul Heyman & CM Punk Speak About Chris Benoit\n\nDespite the calls of a vocal minority of fans who want Benoit's image to be revived, that will never, and should never, happen. Many wrestlers have even given their opinions about Benoit and his legacy in professional wrestling. While many acknowledge his talent, there is no way to reconcile that with the terrible actions he committed. In response to a fan at an Inside the Ropes event, Paul Heyman said:\n\n\"You can admire his work all you want, but I’ll give you my take on it since you want to keep on yelling out, ‘My boy.’ Three people died in that house that night. I don’t care about CTE. Three people died in that house that night. Only one person had the choice behind it. The other two didn’t have a choice to die. So if that’s your boy, f*** you.”\n\nCM Punk also spoke on Benoit in the past as well. In an interview with Ariel Helwani, Punk compared Benoit's actions to the allegations made against Vince McMahon over the last couple years. Punk correctly emphasized that the most important thing is always the victims in these circumstances. He said:"
