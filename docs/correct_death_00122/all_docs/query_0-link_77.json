    "text": "Pro wrestler Chris Benoit, wife and son found dead\n\nFAYETTEVILLE - WWE wrestler Chris Benoit, his wife and son were found dead Monday and police said they were investigating the deaths as a homicide.\n\nLt. Tommy Pope of the Fayette County Sheriff's Department said the three were found at their home about 2:30 p.m., but refused to release details.\n\nPope said results of autopsies on Benoit, his wife Nancy, and 7-year-old son Daniel were expected Tuesday.\n\nBenoit, 40, was a former world heavyweight champion, Intercontinental champion and held several tag-team titles over his career.\n\n\"WWE extends its sincerest thoughts and prayers to the Benoit family's relatives and loved ones in this time of tragedy,\" the federation said in a statement on its Web site.\n\nBenoit was scheduled to perform at the \"Vengeance\" pay-per-view event Sunday night in Houston, but was replaced at the last minute because of what announcer Jim Ross called \"personal reasons.\"\n\nBenoit, a Canadian native, maintained a home in metro Atlanta from the time he wrestled for the defunct World Championship Wrestling.\n\nThe WWE canceled its live \"Monday Night RAW\" card in Corpus Christi, Texas, and USA Network aired a three-hour tribute to Benoit in place of the scheduled wrestling telecast.\n\nChicago bears down, waives Tank Johnson\n\nCHICAGO - Tank Johnson was released Monday by the Chicago Bears, who are \"embarrassed\" by the defensive tackle's legal troubles and say he \"compromised the credibility\" of the team.\n\nJohnson was waived three days after he was pulled over by police in Arizona. He already had been suspended for the first eight games of the 2007 season for violating probation on a gun charge. He spent two months in jail and was released in May.\n\n\"We are upset and embarrassed by Tank's actions last week,\" general manager Jerry Angelo said in a statement. \"He compromised the credibility of our organization.\"\n\nolice in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert said Johnson was stopped for driving 40 mph in a 25 mph zone at 3:30 a.m. Friday and the officer made observations that led him to believe Johnson was impaired.\n\nInterleague games\n\nattendance up\n\nNEW YORK - Interleague games averaged 34,905 this season, a 15 percent increase from games between teams in the same league.\n\nA record 8.8 million fans attended the 252 dates of interleague play, 200,000 more than last year, the commissioner's office said Monday .\n\nSeattle's Ichiro Suzuki has this year's top interleague batting average at .486, and the Yankees' Alex Rodriguez and Cincinnati's Ken Griffey Jr. tied in home runs with eight apiece.\n\nDetroit's Justin Verlander and Oakland's Dan Haren tied for the best pitching record at 4-0, and Philadelphia's Adam Eaton had the best ERA at 1.40.\n\nAmerican League teams were 137-115 in interleague games, the fourth straight season the AL topped the NL. Since interleague play began in 1997, the AL leads the NL 1,387 to 1,317.\n\nLanders son in intensive care\n\nATHENS - The son of Georgia women's basketball coach Andy Landers was in the intensive care unit of Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta on Monday after sustaining head trauma Sunday evening in a car-truck collision in Alabama.\n\nDrew Landers' condition was critical but stable on Monday afternoon, said Denise Simpson, media relations manager for Grady Health Systems.\n\n\"Things are good; he's stable,\" Andy Landers said Monday afternoon from the hospital. \"There aren't really any indicators that there is going to be anything permanent or sustained from it. I'll feel a lot better saying that (tomorrow) than I do today.\"\n\nLanders was one of three North Oconee High School students injured in a crash in Oxford, Ala., that killed junior varsity basketball coach Shawn Smith.\n\nNebraska's Pavin wins Honda-Broderick Cup\n\nNEW YORK - Nebraska volleyball star Sarah Pavan maintained a 4.0 grade-point average in biochemistry while leading the Cornhuskers to a 33-1 season and the NCAA title.\n\nThose achievements earned the junior from Kitchener, Ontario, the 31st annual Honda-Broderick Cup as the nation's female college athlete of the year Monday. She's the fourth volleyball player to win the award and second straight winner from Canada.\n\nWhich was tougher, earning a 4.0 or winning a national championship?\n\n\"They're both so difficult in different ways,\" Pavan said. \"I'd probably say winning the national championship because there are so many factors that you can't control.\""
