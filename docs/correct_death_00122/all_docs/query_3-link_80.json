        "text": "Atlanta — Investigators are looking into who altered pro wrestler Chris Benoit's Wikipedia entry to mention his wife's death hours before authorities discovered the bodies of the couple and their 7-year-old son.\n\nBenoit's Wikipedia entry was altered early Monday to say that the wrestler had missed a match two days earlier because of his wife's death.\n\nA Wikipedia official, Cary Bass, said yesterday that the entry was made by someone using an Internet protocol address registered in Stamford, Conn., where World Wrestling Entertainment is based.\n\nAn IP address, a unique series of numbers carried by every machine connected to the Internet, does not necessarily have to be broadcast from where it is registered. The bodies were found in Benoit's home in suburban Atlanta, and it's not known where the posting was sent from, Bass said.\n\nBenoit strangled his wife and son during the weekend, placing Bibles next to their bodies, before hanging himself on the cable of a weight-machine in his home, authorities said. No motive was offered for the killings, which were discovered Monday.\n\nAlso yesterday, federal drug agents said they had raided the west Georgia office of Dr. Phil Astin, who prescribed testosterone to Benoit. Hours before the raid, Astin told The Associated Press he had treated Benoit for low testosterone levels, which he said likely originated from previous steroid use.\n\nAnabolic steroids were found in Benoit's home, leading officials to wonder whether the drugs played a role in the killings. Some experts believe steroids cause paranoia, depression and violent outbursts known as \"roid rage.\""
