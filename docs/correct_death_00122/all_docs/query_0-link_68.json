There are no further details at this time, other than the Benoit family residence is currently being investigated by local authorities.\n\n\n\nTonight’s Raw on USA Network will serve as a tribute to Chris Benoit and his family. WWE extends its sincerest thoughts and prayers to the Benoit family’s relatives and loved ones in this time of tragedy.\n\n\n\nDon't really know much about him but it's eerie that he and his family were found dead.\n\npatrickwm68 http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/benoitdead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't really know much about him but it's eerie that he and his family were found dead.\n\n\n\nOh my God, him and his family?! Last week Sherry and now this. Very sad.\n\nPrimal Oh man that absolutely sux!\n\n\n\nOne of the best technical wrestlers ever.\n\n\n\nThis is indeed very sad news. :(\n\npatrickwm68 According to this, Benoit missed a PPV last night:\n\n\n\nCHRIS BENOIT MISSES VENGEANCE PPV\n\nby Mike Johnson @ 8:41:00 PM on 6/24/2007\n\n\n\n41 minutes into the Vengeance PPV, World Wrestling Entertainment ring announcer Justin Roberts announced that Chris Benoit would miss his scheduled match with CM Punk for the vacant ECW World title due to \"personal reasons.\"\n\n\n\nWe've heard there was a family emergency that caused Benoit to fly home to Georgia from the Texas tour this weekend and we wish he and his family the best.\n\n\n\nCM Punk's replacement opponent was Johnny Nitro. Buck Woodward is covering the PPV live as it happens.\n\nJavOner oh man not another great wrestler, whats going on.\n\nMONSTER OMG!!! That is crazy!!!\n\npatrickwm68 Someone just posted on Wikipedia that according to the ESPN boards that this is all staged.\n\n\n\nI can't find anything about this on any news sites including CNN, Fox.news, or ESPN. The only ones reporting this are a couple wrestling sites. Here's another update:\n\n\n\nIn tragic news out of Atlanta, Ga., Chris Benoit, his wife Nancy, and their son Daniel were all found dead in their homes today.\n\n\n\nWWE Raw will be a tribute to Benoit. All previous plans for Raw have been scraped.\n\n\n\nDaniel was their only child together. He was about seven years old. Says one friend: \"Chris and Nancy were known to have a volatile relationship, but their son was the saving grace for both of them.\"\n\n\n\nBenoit has another son from his previous marriage who is in Canada at this time.\n\nthecallahan If this is staged this is the dumbest, most farked up thing they've done in a while.\n\n\n\nBut if this is posted at wwe.com like Vince's death....\n\n\n\nCan the title also possibly be changed until things are proven certain one way or another?\n\nMONSTER I seriously doubt this is staged. Absolutely no way even the WWE would stoop that low to fake the death of Benoit and his family.\n\n\n\nThere are so many untimely wrestler deaths, the last thing they should do is create storylines with fake deaths.\n\n\n\nThe Vince McMahon death angle is in really poor taste.\n\nJabberwocky Here are a couple articles from local news sites in Atlanta and Memphis.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.wsbtv.com/news/13567642/detail.html?rss=atl&psp=news\n\nhttp://www.myeyewitnessnews.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=a76b6326-1f90-4539-988e-cf4eb2b8cd7f&rss=59\n\npatrickwm68 He missed a PPV to fly home for a family emergency, what if the wife was threatening to kill herself and the son? It wouldn't be the first time it's happened.\n\n\n\nWatch this be a \"murder suicide\".\n\nJ Storm If this is a work, Vince should be ashmed of himself. If it's true, then its the saddest day in my life. Benoit was & is one of my favorite wrestlers. Chris & Eddie are together. My condolences are also with Nancy & his child.\n\n\n\nVince needs to end his death angle now. If not, he's a horrible human being for continuing.:bawling:\n\n\n\nR.I.P.

This is very sad.\n\nThe General Until this hits a legit news site I won't believe it.\n\nDoc Sonic If this is true maybe carbon monoxide?\n\n\n\nIf it's a work it's absolutley sick.\n\npatrickwm68 If this is true maybe carbon monoxide?\n\n\n\nIf it's a work it's absolutley sick.\n\n\n\nI thought that too but they said he cancelled a PPV last night to fly home for a family emergency.\n\nthecallahan They certainly did get a lot of things up rather quickly. I'm taking a wait and see approach with this though.\n\nTony Coca Holy Cow.If this is true its a sad day in wrestling.\n\nBarbarian I thought that too but they said he cancelled a PPV last night to fly home for a family emergency.\n\n\n\nReally? What sources? I haven't read that on anything I've been looking at. Not that I'm doubting you, I just want to know.\n\npatrickwm68 I went to Yahoo News and typed in Chris Benoit, and this was from one of the first wrestling sites I went to:\n\n\n\nCHRIS BENOIT MISSES VENGEANCE PPV\n\nby Mike Johnson @ 8:41:00 PM on 6/24/2007\n\n\n\n41 minutes into the Vengeance PPV, World Wrestling Entertainment ring announcer Justin Roberts announced that Chris Benoit would miss his scheduled match with CM Punk for the vacant ECW World title due to \"personal reasons.\"\n\n\n\nWe've heard there was a family emergency that caused Benoit to fly home to Georgia from the Texas tour this weekend and we wish he and his family the best.\n\n\n\nCM Punk's replacement opponent was Johnny Nitro.

He's dead too! :peoples:\n\nTony Coca wow the show stopped.\n\nRichBamf Looks real.\n\n\n\nThey shut the arena and everything. :(\n\nDoc Sonic since when did RAW move to 8PM?\n\nMakkari1 He missed a PPV to fly home for a family emergency, what if the wife was threatening to kill herself and the son?

Tonight it will be his best matches & interviews with other wrestlers. The only thing i see in my mind is when Chris & Eddie hugged w/ the titles at wrestlemania XX. :bawling:\n\nNatrix since when did RAW move to 8PM?\n\n\n\nIt was going to be a 3 hour show tonight so it started earlier.\n\nJ Storm http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/f/fb/Benoit_and_Guerrero_celebrate_at_WrestleMania_XX.jpg\n\nMONSTER since when did RAW move to 8PM?\n\n\n\nThey had a 3 hour special planned for tonight to as a tribute or some crap for Vince McMahon.\n\n\n\nNow its about the life of Benoit.\n\nJ Storm He is the most respected wrestlers in the business, he will be a horseman forever!\n\nTony Coca What do you mean?\n\n\n\nthere was supposed to be a show that was a tribute to vince dying with all the wrestlers there.They closed the arena down.\n\nDoc Sonic How sad is it when people can't believe that a wrestler and his family are dead all because of some other crap storyline they were previously running?\n\n\n\nYou can blame the WWE for that and all the tastless storylines they've had in the past.\n\nNatrix You can blame the WWE for that and all the tastless storylines they've had in the past.\n\n\n\nThat is exactly what I mean and that is a very sad statement about \"sports entertainment\".\n\nDoc Sonic http://www.11alive.com/news/article_news.aspx?storyid=99172\n\n\n\nAccording to published reports, WWE professional wrestler Chris Benoit and his family were found dead in their home in Peachtree City.\n\n\n\nOn their Web site, World Wrestling Entertainment officials said that Benoit and his family were found dead on Monday.\n\n\n\nThe statement said, \" World Wrestling Entertainment is deeply saddened to report that today Chris Benoit and his family were found dead in their home. There are no further details at this time, other than the Benoit family residence is currently being investigated by local authorities. Monday night's \"Raw\" on USA Network will serve as a tribute to Chris Benoit and his family.\"\n\n\n\nFayette County and Peachtree City authorities have not confirmed Benoit's death.\n\nsnappahead Damn, man. This is aweful. It was just yesterday that we were mourning Eddie and now this. Geez. His family too. That's just scary. Chris was one of the best ever. The sport's really going to miss him.\n\nSam Wilson that horrible. I hope there was nothing sinister surround those deaths.\n\n\n\nOn a side note, A lot of wrestlers live here in the atl area, that guy raven goes to the same LCS I go to...\n\nDeathlok2001 W@W!..... this is shocking! Going to watch RAW tonight for sure.......\n\n\n\n\n\nJust so you all know, Chris was from my province of Alberta & my home town of Edmonton. He went to high school here. It was the lead story on the local news. A couple of years ago, Chris came back to Edmonton after winning the WWe championship & the mayor gave him a key to the city & proclaimed it, C. B. Day! Chris was moved by all the positive support & broke down crying as he thanked the city for its warm support\n\nheirtoasguard what happened to Sherry? she's Scary Sherry right?\n\npatrickwm68 what happened to Sherry? she's Scary Sherry right?\n\n\n\nSensational Sherry\n\n\n\nhttp://community.livejournal.com/bytethis/4030.html\n\nwolverinejedi007 RIP Chris...the Rabid Wolverine...\n\nDark Knight Absolutely horrible, I loved Chris Benoit, even before he became a Horseman.\n\n\n\nThis story is appearing in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Calgary Sun, so legit news sites are carrying this now.\n\npatrickwm68 From a Canadian site:\n\n\n\nhttp://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=96f60c3a-8163-46fc-8ee6-4939027680d9&k=28725\n\n\n\n\"Officials would only say the family had not been shot to death\"\n\nThe General They made the announcement to the fans and sent them home.

I'll always remember that. Man this sucks.:thumbsdow\n\n\n\nRIP Chris.\n\nlemonman6 I can only imagine what's going through Dean Malenko's head.\n\n\n\nThe guy has lost both of his best friends within a year.\n\nskorpsta if this is true.man thats so sad..if its part of the whole saga.....thats not kool to do something like this.\n\nNightcrawler777 I can only imagine what's going through Dean Malenko's head.\n\n\n\nThe guy has lost both of his best friends within a year.\n\n\n\nI feel bad for Poor Chavo Also..\n\nThats his uncle and one of his best friends in less then two Years..\n\n\n\nNot to Mention Poor Rey and Vicki...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis really Sucks...\n\nChris Benoit is a Wrestling legend...\n\npatrickwm68 I think we should remember that his wife and 7 year old son are dead too. If this is foul play then it's a shame that an innocent child had to be involved.\n\nboons88 Chris was one of the most awesome athletes ever. I remember the thrills he gave us in my college years when i was addicted to \"rassling\"\n\n\n\nI hope he is at peace; you will be missed; and Thank You for showing us what a true sportman is like.\n\n\n\nB.\n\nJabberwocky It's hit the major publications now, so I don't think it's a put on. The truly sad part is that whatever happened his 7-year-old son was involved in it.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-06-25-chris-benoit_N.htm?csp=34\n\n\n\nWWE wrestler Chris Benoit, his wife and son were found dead Monday and police said they were investigating the deaths as a homicide.\n\n\n\nLt. Tommy Pope of the Fayette County Sheriff's Department said the three were found at their home about 2:30 p.m., but refused to release details.\n\narmitage I'm shocked.\n\nThis is surreal as all hell.\n\nIt's even more catastrophic because his family were also victims.\n\nHe was one of the few that kept me still watching wrestling. It was a dark day when Eddie died and that is nothing in the extremity of this.\n\nDD_fan96 He was my favorite wrestler. He always came out with 110%, he was the most intense wrestler ever imo.\n\n\n\nI'm stunned.\n\nHalJordanFan I haven't watched wrestling in awhile, but the Canadian Crippler was one of my all time favs. My deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends. Especially for his 7 year old son.\n\nNatrix I haven't watched wrestling in awhile, but the Canadian Crippler was one of my all time favs. My deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends. Especially for his 7 year old son.\n\n\n\nHis wife and 7 yr old son are dead too.\n\nthecallahan Oh no... http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070626/ap_on_re_us/wrestler_dead\n\n\n\nA train of thought is he killed his wife, kid then committed suicide...\n\nMaximo This is really sad news, I am shocked and stunned, one of my favs. Had the priviledge of seeing Benoit wrestle a while back when they came to Brisbane and he was amazing.\n\n\n\nR.I.P Benoit\n\npatrickwm68 From ABC News:\n\n\n\nWrestling star Chris Benoit, his wife, Nancy, and their 7-year-old son, Daniel, were found dead in their suburban Atlanta home Monday. The deaths are being investigated as a possible suicide and double homicide, authorities told ABC News.\n\n\n\nLt. Tommy Pope of the Fayette County Sheriff's Department told ABC News that Benoit had missed several appointments over the weekend, leading concerned parties to ask police to do a \"welfare check.\" When sheriffs arrived at the Benoits' home, they found the wrestler, his wife and their son dead.\n\n\n\nThere were no signs of gunshot wounds or stabbing, according to Pope. Authorities are not ruling out other causes, such as poisoning, suffocation or strangulation. Pope told ABC News that his department is looking at this situation as a \"possible double murder, suicide.\"\n\n\n\nPope said \"the instruments of death were located on scene,\" but he would not specify what those instruments are or where in the house the bodies were found. Pope added the department is \"not actively searching for any suspects outside of the house.\"\n\n\n\nAn autopsy has been scheduled for Tuesday morning at 10 a.m. However, it could be weeks before there is a result.\n\n\n\nBenoit, 40, was scheduled to spar against C.M. Punk in a pay-per-view event Sunday night in Houston for the Extreme Champion Wrestling title. But Benoit canceled before the event, citing personal reasons.\n\n\n\nA native of Edmonton, Alberta, Benoit was known in the ring as the \"Canadian Crippler.\"\n\n\n\nFollowing the announcement of the deaths, World Wrestling Entertainment issued a statement: \"Chris was beloved among his fellow superstars, and was a favorite among WWE fans for his unbelievable athleticism and wrestling ability. He always took great pride in his performance, and always showed respect for the business he loved, for his peers and toward his fans. This is a terrible tragedy and an unbearable loss. WWE extends its sincere condolences and prayers to the Benoit family and loved ones in this time of tragedy.\"\n\n\n\nWWE announced that it would drop its planned Monday night line-up on the USA Network to air a three-hour tribute to Benoit.\n\n\n\nIn a sport known for bravado and bullying, Benoit was very much beloved and respected by his peers. He was passionate about his profession and served as a mentor to many younger, up-and-coming performers. As an indication of how much the fans enjoyed him, when the crowd in Houston's Toyota Center learned Sunday night that he wouldn't be there, they chanted, \"We want Benoit!\"\n\nNatrix From the WWE home page:\n\n\n\nIt has been ruled that the deaths of Chris Benoit, his wife Nancy and their son Daniel earlier today were the result of a double murder-suicide from within the home. WWE.com will have more as soon as it becomes available.\n\npatrickwm68 A bunch of sites are reporting that the police believe he killed his wife and son over the weekend then himself today. The bodies were found in three different rooms.\n\nNatrix My roommate asked me during the tribute \"What happens if it turns out Benoit had something to do with the deaths?\"\n\n\n\nHow bad would a tribute to a person that murdered his family and then himself (if that does turn out to be the case) make the WWE look?\n\nTony Coca That sucks if that s true.\n\npatrickwm68 I have a 2 year old son and I can't imagine ever harming him in anyway. How does a parent kill their own child? How does anyone hurt a child for that matter? This story is making me sick.\n\nTony Coca Its sad that this situation has come out the way its being speculated,that He had to go this route to deal with whatever situation he was going thru with his wife.Hopefully its all speculations and that Benoit wont end up being remembered for this.\n\nMONSTER I was thinking that the tribute show might have been a little too soon.\n\n\n\nI hope its not true, but there is no way we should be celebrating someone who killed their wife and kid if that is the case.\n\n\n\nWilliam Regal had the right idea and kept it simple about Benoit being one of the best wrestlers ever. He was. Let's here how they died before we hand out the father and husband of the year award to the man.\n\npatrickwm68 We just had a case here in NJ where a father drowned his 2 kids and hung himself all to get even with the ex-wife. The kids are always the ones to suffer for the mistakes of the parents.\n\nDark Knight My roommate asked me during the tribute \"What happens if it turns out Benoit had something to do with the deaths?\"\n\n\n\nHow bad would a tribute to a person that murdered his family and then himself (if that does turn out to be the case) make the WWE look?\n\n\n\nFirst, we don't know if it was him or his wife that did it, or if they even did it at all. Second, if it was him, none of us know what personal demons made him believe that this was a necessary thing to do. Third, the WWE doesn't look bad because they were paying tribute to the 22 year career of a well-respected performer in the business of entertaining people.\n\n\n\nPersonally, it will take a lot for me to believe that he did this because I know he loved his children immensely. I could believe him killing his wife and himself, but not his son.\n\ntarim69 This is terrible news.\n\n\n\nWrestling has had so many premature deaths in the past 10 years. Rude, Hennig, Elizabeth, Pillman, Owen, Eddie G, Davey Boy Smith - the list goes on and on.\n\n\n\nPillman and Owen Hart were the ones that really got to me. I admit to still getting a bit choked up when I see them on tv or in clips.\n\n\n\nIve never mentioned this here, but I trained with Tony Devito for about 8 months back in the mid90s, but had to quit about a month from my first match. I was having really bad foot problems which I found out a few years later is gout (which I now take meds for).\n\n\n\nI really loved doing it and it was heartbreaking to have to stop but with severe athritis, theres no way my body could have withstood the beating(thogh I was in excellent shape back then). I was recently considering doing weekend things locally, but that ended quickly with the foot acting up pretty quickly.\n\n\n\nMy G/F actually made a comment when Hennig died about being glad I never got into wrestling because the early fatality rate is high.\n\n\n\nI got to meet Nancy a couple times at some of the old ECW shows.\n\n\n\nBenoit was really talented. Such a shame. I havent watched wrestling in years. Every once in awhile I may watch TNA but dont watch it regularly.\n\npatrickwm68 First, we don't know if it was him or his wife that did it, or if they even did it at all. Second, if it was him, none of us know what personal demons made him believe that this was a necessary thing to do.

I could believe him killing his wife and himself, but not his son.\n\n\n\nEver here of \"Roid Rage\", these wrestlers are on all kinds of crap. Why do you think they kick off so early? Eddie G. died of a heart attack brought on by steroid and drug use. Anything can happen when someone is angry, steroids can double that anger. What do they call it? Momentary lapse of reason or guitly by reason of insanity. \"Oh my God what have I done\".\n\nDark Knight Here's a scenario my wife actually thought of.\n\n\n\nShe calls him and says there's something wrong with Daniel, come home. He leaves, citing the family emergency. When he gets home, he finds daniel already dead by her hands, goes into a rage and kills her. Then in a fit of sadness and grief, does himself.\n\nDark Knight Ever here of \"Roid Rage\", these wrestlers are on all kinds of crap. Why do you think they kick off so early?

How does a parent kill their own child? How does anyone hurt a child for that matter? This story is making me sick.\n\n\n\nNo kidding. Just watched Raw. At first I thought it may just be an accident, but after reading some early reports on the web it seems like its murder/suicide of some sort. That's just sick and sad at the same time.\n\n\n\nSomething is creepy about this whole thing. Especially the part where he cancelled a PPV to go back home. Benoit would NEVER miss a show. He was one of only a handful of guys who actually lived for the wrestling biz.:(\n\n\n\nAt least Vince had the decency to come out and acknowledge his own \"death\" was just a stunt. Here's hoping he has even more decency to stop that storyline altogether in light of recent events...\n\npatrickwm68 I understand what you are saying, all I'm saying is that everyone is rushing to put the cart before the horse. Just because it's being called a double murder-suicide, doesn't mean it was him that did it.\n\n\n\nI know all about roid rage, i got two family members dead because of it.\n\n\n\nI know. Your wife's scenario sounds good too. I just don't like hearing about a kid being killed.\n\nHalJordanFan Well if it's true that he killed his son & wife then I take back anything nice that I said about him and I'll change it to:\n\n\n\nHe's a piece of sh*t and I hope he rots in hell for taking an innocent child's life as well as his wife's. I have kids an no matter how mad or pissed off I get at anything I'd NEVER do anything to harm them.\n\n\n\nNick\n\nDark Knight Just spoke to a friend of mine who is a cop and he said that it is entirely possible that police really are searching for someone and don't want them to know it, so they feed the press a line of BS to cover their tracks while they follow up on any hot leads they may have.\n\nAchiever Just spoke to a friend of mine who is a cop and he said that it is entirely possible that police really are searching for someone and don't want them to know it, so they feed the press a line of BS to cover their tracks while they follow up on any hot leads they may have.\n\n\n\nOne can only hope this is the case.\n\nCar50n i've only ever been a fan of 3 wrestlers; Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit and Keiji \"the great muta\" Muto.\n\n\n\nMuto's still doing his thing, barely. but i guess i'll never be a wrestling fan again.\n\nDark Knight At the end of the day, no matter what really happened, this is a tragedy. The fact that the wrestling business lost a legend is not even secondary. A family is lost, including a young child who will never have the opportunity to live life like the rest of us. That is the saddest part of this whole thing.\n\nHalJordanFan At the end of the day, no matter what really happened, this is a tragedy.

That he went quietly without any knowledge of anything.\n\nchromesamurai This messed me up today.\n\n\n\nI find it hard to believe Benoit, a man who loved his family, who rushed home and missed a PPV because they were sick, would do something so heinous.\n\n\n\nThere must be something else to this.\n\npatrickwm68 This messed me up today.\n\n\n\nI find it hard to believe Benoit, a man who loved his family, who rushed home and missed a PPV because they were sick, would do something so heinous.\n\n\n\nThere must be something else to this.\n\n\n\nWho said they were sick? All that was said was he had a family emergency or personal business.\n\nbullethole I was an avid WWE fan since I was a kid .... until a couple of weeks ago ..the Vince death angle was riduculous .It made me feel stupid for watching pro wrestling .\n\n\n\nIf Benoit did what I suspect he did, I cant respect him , even if he was a great wrestler.\n\nWolverine1 I wanna find out the details. True Benoit was a good wrestler but I need to know, so I can make up my mind if he still gets any respect. Im sure he didnt do it though. He just doesnt seem the type, but I also have learned that typing anyone is all bs anyways....\n\nVracula wow i just read this,man this sucks.\n\nsomething like this is always a cumulation of events and when people loose their minds and hope and just cop out.hope they all rest inpeace.even if the news is true that he did kill his family i woudl feel sorry for him rather than anger towards him its obvious that he needed help.just because someof us here have more stregth than others doesnt mean we can be angry at him not at this stage.he obviously lost his mind over this and killed himself which obviosuly is a selfish thing to do but it still is sad ,it takes a lot to shoot your family and the yourself.this indeed is tragedy so treat it like one.\n\nchromesamurai First of all, no one was shot. In one of the press releases, it was stated that no one involved in this was shot.\n\n\n\nSecond, I believe it was the WWE website who stated that he had said his family was coughing up blood, and that was part of the reason he left. I've also heard that various other places.\n\n\n\nStill doesn't make sense to me.\n\nRichBamf I feel sorry for the kids left behind.\n\n\n\nWhat are they thinking? To lose their mother, father and sibling on the same day must be heartbreaking. :(\n\nDoc Sonic There's so many potential angles to this thing. Only time will tell what really happened. Other than the obvious tradegy of three people losing thier lives ( and one being a child ) what bothers me is that a beloved person may have been involved in murder.

The bodies were found Monday afternoon in three different rooms of the house on Green Meadow Lane, in a subdivision off a gravel road about two miles from Whitewater Country Club.\n\n\n\nThe autopsies were scheduled to be done at the Georgia Bureau of Investigation Crime Lab in DeKalb County.\n\n\n\nBallard told The Associated Press a gun was not used in any of the deaths. But he declined to say how the three died.\n\n\n\n\"We're pretty sure we know, but we want to confirm it with the crime lab,\" Ballard said early Tuesday.\n\n\n\nFayette County Coroner C.J. Mowell did not immediately return phone calls. The answering service for his funeral home said he was out of town.\n\n\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment said on its Web site that it asked authorities to check on Benoit and his family after being alerted by friends who received \"several curious text messages sent by Benoit early Sunday morning.\"\n\n\n\nPope said the three were found about 2:30 p.m., but he would release no other details about the deaths.\n\n\n\nStamford, Conn.-based WWE also said on its Web site it had further information on the deaths of Benoit, 40; his wife, Nancy, 43; and son, Daniel, but had been asked by authorities not to release it.\n\n\n\nBenoit, a native of Canada, was born in Montreal. He was a former world heavyweight champion, Intercontinental champion and held several tag-team titles over his career. He was known by several names including \"The Canadian Crippler.\"\n\n\n\n\"WWE extends its sincerest thoughts and prayers to the Benoit family's relatives and loved ones in this time of tragedy,\" the federation said in a statement on its Web site.\n\n\n\nBenoit was scheduled to perform at the \"Vengeance\" pay-per-view event Sunday night in Houston, but was replaced at the last minute because of what announcer Jim Ross called \"personal reasons.\"\n\n\n\nBenoit maintained a home in metro Atlanta from the time he wrestled for the defunct World Championship Wrestling.\n\n\n\nThe WWE canceled its live \"Monday Night RAW\" card in Corpus Christi, Texas, and USA Network aired a three-hour tribute to Benoit in place of the scheduled wrestling telecast.\n\n\n\nBenoit's wife managed several wrestlers and went by the stage name, \"Woman,\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\n\n\nThey met when her then-husband drew up a script that had them involved in a relationship as part of an ongoing story line on World Championship Wrestling, the newspaper said.\n\n\n\nBenoit has two other children from a prior relationship.\n\nchromesamurai Yeah, I don't like the way this is heading.\n\n\n\nThe WWE website has dropped all other mention of him other that the one front page deal. You can't even find mention of him in the Merch section.

If it's all true..then maybe they're right in doing that.\n\nTK-421 I really hope that this incident starts to open some eyes into the ever growing numbers of wrestler/wrestling deaths. I know that most are due to steroids, pain killers, drugs, and the rigorous schedules, but my guess that these factors not only take a toll physically but mentally on a person. Not knowing the facts, and only \"knowing\" Benoit from how he is portayed on TV and what other wrestlers have said/wrote about him, it is to bad that he did not reach out to someone if he was having problems, and to bad that no one reached out to him.\n\n\n\nI think the WWE and McMahon really need to take a look at themselves and make some serious changes to their business practices.

This has to be some kind of steroid or some other drug induced thing because why would this man that everyone describes as this super family man kill his wife, kid and then himself???? Leaving behind 2 other children too! Maybe she was cheating on him. Who knows. This is ****ing horrible. Personally I have no pity for people that feel the need to take other people down with them. You want to pack it in like a loser fine, but donât kill your wife and your kid you Fân dumb ass. This is a very sad story. I canât believe this.\n\n\n\nRIP Benoit. May God have mercy on your soul.\n\nAzrael1 When I first heard the news last night I was shocked and speechless. Much like everyone here; I was a huge Benoit fan. After finding out this was a murder/suicide again I find myself speechless. I didn't know the man but he seemed like the type that was a stand up type of guy.\n\n\n\nAfter this incident something has to change here. I've said this to my friends a bunch of times when discussing wrestling. WWE needs to start having off seasons for their superstars just like all other professional sports have an off season. To ask someone to spend 345 days of the year on the road year in and year out takes a huge strain on someone physically and mentally.\n\n\n\nDuring this off season WWE can then institute the random drug tests and because of this incident, psychological evaluations. See if these guys are mentally fit to go out on the road for such an extended amount of time on a yearly basis. If they're dealing with heavy stuff...then it could be caught and the wrestler can seek help before something like this happens again.\n\n\n\nThis is a tragedy.\n\nNightcrawler777 ****\n\n\n\n\n\nJust a Complete waist..\n\nKills his family and destroys a 22 year long wrestling legacy..\n\n\n\nStew Hart has to be rolling over in his Grave...\n\n\n\n\n\nI know he was just a wrestler but i thought he was one of the good guys..\n\nNever saw this coming...\n\nPerna This is the most shocking and heartbreaking thing I've heard. I still can't believe these events took place.\n\npatrickwm68 In the early 90's the WWF cracked down on steroid use after legal scrutiny. Anyone remember how small Ultimate Warrior got? Then they slowly stopped checking and the wrestlers are getting bigger and bigger all the time. Just look at Batista, the guy looks like his skin is ready to split open. If they don't do something this is just going to happen again.\n\n\n\nI can't help wondering, how do they know that it wasn't the wife who killed the son and because of that Benoit killed her then himself? Why did he miss that PPV to fly home for a family emergency? Did he plan to go home and kill them?\n\nCage I'm basically speechless. My heart hurts for that little boy. Until we know all of the details it is futile to speculate and lay blame. But damn... the kid was only seven years old.:thumbsdow\n\nTK-421 Steroids and Painkillers, the steady diet of a pro wrestler, old school and new blood alike. They all pretty much do it or have done it. How can they afford not to? To keep up the rigorous schedule and travel, and to perform on a regular basis is going to take it's toll.\n\nI do not think there is a person on the planet who could keep up this life style without steroids or painkillers.\n\n\n\nYou know if McMahon wants to be a true pioneer for sports entertainment, he needs to take a stand, and make some changes. Let something positive come from this tradgedy.\n\nendsongjen I'm basically speechless. My heart hurts for that little boy. Until we know all of the details it is futile to speculate and lay blame. But damn... the kid was only seven years old.:thumbsdow\n\n\n\nI feel the exact same way. very saddening :(\n\nfirestorm Am finally in a better and clearer state of mind and got my thoughts together on this, and in finality, all I can say is that this was a senseless waste of 3 lives... without a doubt, Chris Benoit will burn for his cowardly actions... with all the respect that he earned in life, in death he lost everything... his son, his wife, his life... and that self-same respect that he craved so much in life...\n\nKdawg59 I can't help wondering, how do they know that it wasn't the wife who killed the son and because of that Benoit killed her then himself? Why did he miss that PPV to fly home for a family emergency? Did he plan to go home and kill them?\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess that is what I would like to know as well... Was that just BS put out by the WWE to explain why he wasn't present or did he definitely fly home?\n\n\n\nI will say that it has to be a tough lifestyle... no doubt there... The pain and performance drugs these guys take are often times\" The only way to make it\" doing what they do... It's truly a sad tale and there is no real one definitive way to know why it happened. The people that knew that are no longer with us... If he snapped, he snapped and albeit the drugs probably did not help... but roid rage is not a good enough excuse for me sorry as he would have to be on some pretty monster doses to kill 2 people in two different rooms... It's too premeditated for a crime of passion like rage\n\n\n\nI am shocked that this happened as I too always heard nothing but genuine good things about Benoit... I hope that truth comes to light and puts an end to any speculation.\n\npatrickwm68 Just watched the press conference, looks like he did do it.

They did not say how the wife and son were killed or what was used, only that they died of asphyxiation.

Confidence increases, as do energy levels, self-esteem, motivation and enthusiasm. You experience less fatigue, sleep better and have an increased ability to train through pain. Sex drive usually increases, as does irritability, anger and a “strange, edgy feeling.”\n\n\n\n• As doses increase or are taken for extended periods, a loss of inhibition occurs combined with impaired judgment, mood swings and grandiose ideas. This condition progresses until the user becomes suspicious, argumentative, impulsive and still more aggressive.\n\n\n\n• Eventually, aggressive feelings reach a fever pitch, characterized by violent, hostile and antisocial behavior. This is full-blown ‘roid rage and can lead to self-inflicted injury, assault, divorce, domestic violence, child abuse and attempted murder. Not all people experience these feelings. Some researchers explain this paradox by suggesting that an underlying predisposition to such behavior can be brought to the surface by steroid abuse.\n\n\n\nAnother problem related to the psychological effects of steroids is what happens when the user stops taking them. Depression is common in former steroid users, who miss the elation brought on by the drugs. In fact, just about all positive mental feelings associated with steroid use reverse when one ceases taking them. The author of the Australian review says that, in some cases, violent behavior and moments of rage occur during the withdrawal phase.\n\n\n\nDependence on steroids can result when the user wishes to stave off loss of confidence as steroid-built muscles begin to atrophy. This dependence may also involve a modulation by steroids of brain chemicals, such as endogenous opioids, that control mood states.\n\n\n\nAn often-overlooked factor in discussions of the mental effects of steroids is how specific steroids modify behavior. For example, most studies that associate violent or antisocial tendencies with steroid use usually involve a more androgenic type of steroid, such as Anadrol-50 or testosterone. Animal studies in which mice were given a more anabolic, less androgenic steroid, such as stanozolol (Winstrol) documented no aggressive changes in behavior (General Pharmacology, 27:293-98).\n\nTony Coca from wwe\n\n\n\nWWEÂ® Shocked At Latest Developments In Benoit Tragedy, Concerned By Sensationalistic Reporting\n\nWritten: June 26, 2007STAMFORD, Conn., June 26, 2007 â World Wrestling Entertainment is stunned and saddened by the details released by local authorities concerning the double homicide-suicide involving Chris Benoit, his wife, Nancy, and his son, Daniel.\n\n\n\nHowever, WWE is concerned with the sensationalistic reporting and speculation being undertaken by some members of the media following the press conference held by the Fayette County Sheriffâs Department and the District Attorney. During the press conference, the investigating authorities made the following points, all of which run contrary to the media speculation that \"roid rage\" was a factor in the senseless murders and suicide:\n\n\n\n1. The authorities stated that all drugs found in the house were believed to be legal prescriptions.\n\n\n\n2. Steroids were not, and could not, be related to the cause of death (asphyxiation). Authorities had no factual basis to speculate as to Benoitâs state of mind, and rightly did not do so.\n\n\n\n3. Toxicology tests have not even been completed, so there is no current evidence that Benoit even had steroids or any other substance in his body. In that regard, on the last test done on Benoit by WWE's independently administered drug testing program, done on April 10, 2007, Benoit tested negative.\n\n\n\n4. The physical findings announced by authorities indicate deliberation, not rage. The wife's feet and hands were bound and she was asphyxiated, not beaten to death. By the account of the authorities, there were substantial periods of time between the death of the wife and the death of the son, again suggesting deliberate thought, not rage. The presence of a Bible by each is also not an act of rage.\n\n\n\n5. WWE strongly suggests that it is entirely wrong for speculators to suggest that steroids had anything to do with these senseless acts, especially when the authorities plainly stated there is no evidence that Benoit had steroids in his body, pending the toxicological reports, and that they had no evidence at this time as to the motive for these acts.\n\n\n\nWWE is continuing to monitor the ongoing investigation being conducted by local authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\npatrickwm68 Sounds like the WWE is doing some peliminary strikes and covering their asses for what's about to come.\n\nMakkari1 He is the most respected wrestlers in the business, he will be a horseman forever!\n\n\n\nGot no respect for a man who kills his wife and sufficate his 7 year old son.:thumbsdow If you are mad with with life take your self out not other people.\n\ndevlinboy i really like benoit too. im just judging what he did in the ring. this is a horrible thing, but it should not impact how you felt about him while he was at his best...in the ring.\n\nNightcrawler777 Sounds like the WWE is doing some peliminary strikes and covering their asses for what's about to come.\n\n\n\nMakes Good Sence for them to do just that...\n\npatrickwm68 i really like benoit too. im just judging what he did in the ring. this is a horrible thing, but it should not impact how you felt about him while he was at his best...in the ring.\n\n\n\nKilling your family washes away anything you've done in your life.

Benoit’s wife was also found in an upstairs family room, and Benoit hung himself in the weight room in the basement.\n\n\n\n- The toxicology reports are still pending.

Ballard told the website that the text messages that have been mentioned previously as sent by Benoit (believed to be sent to WWE star Chavo Guerrero, who had just spent time with the family) stated that Nancy and Daniel Benoit were sick (believed to be sent after they were murdered) and a second noting the doors were open and the dogs were outside. Ballard believed the second message may have been an attempt by Benoit to make sure the bodies were discovered after his suicide.\n\n\n\nMore shocking was Ballard's revelation that The Benoit's son Daniel was found with needle marks in his arms. ESPN wrote, \"The district attorney said he believed that the boy had been given growth hormones for some time because the family considered him undersized.\" HGH can be prescribed for children deemed hormone deficient.\n\nTony Coca REPORT: WWE TO APOLOGIZE FOR BENOIT TRIBUTE TONIGHT DURING ECW BROADCAST ON SCI FI NETWORK\n\nby Mike Johnson @ 7:22:00 PM on 6/26/2007\n\n\n\n\n\nTVWeek.com is reporting that WWE Head Vince McMahon will appear on tonight's ECW on Sci Fi Broadcast to address the Chris Benoit tragedy and offer a public apology for the company's three hour tribute to Chris Benoit, which aired live last night before the company is believed to have learned the details of the circumstances behind the deaths of Benoit and his family.\n\nThe General I agree with all of that, except for being remembered as a hero.

WWE was told that Benoit’s home was now considered a major crime scene.\n\n\n\nThe decision to cancel the live event scheduled in Corpus Christi that night was made between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. In keeping with company policy, and with limited knowledge regarding facts of the case, WWE choose to air a memorial dedicated to the career of Chris Benoit. As facts emerged surrounding the case, all tributes to Chris Benoit were removed both on-air and on WWE.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose Text messages seem to off.Why would he text to his friends his address.\n\n\n\nObviously he wasn't in his right frame of mind. Maybe he had been drinking and look at what he had already done to his family by the time he sent them.\n\ncollectoritis As to roids...Lex Luger said that pretty much all wrestlers he knew did em , sadly that is just the way it is & prolly will continue to be.\n\n\n\nI'm sure Vince is pretty upset about the tribute and he's prolly gonna can the \"death story\" for now or not use it at all in the future.\n\npdashnut12 Don't watch it if you don't like it...simple as that.\n\n\n\nIts not about not liking it, its about all the problems that are associated with pro wrestling. As well as the fact that wrestling fans and executives will never look at and fix, what there \"sport\" indirectly causes: alot of death...\n\nHeres a little statistic---14 former pro wrestlers (under the age of 40) have died in the last TWO years. Thats a big deal.\n\nWolverine1 Im going to continue watching it, I gained alot of respect for McMahon because he came on last night and said you wont be hearing crap about Benoit. Never did like Benoit, but its hard to believe anyone would do that to their family. Lets just all forget about him. He SO better not get in the Hall of Fame next year, I dont give 2 rats asses about his career now.\n\nabarron This was in the metro here in the uk today.\n\nLooks like it was murder suicide.\n\nA tragedy for all involved\n\nJuggernaut This just goes to show how screwed up the wrestling community really is. What other sport do you know of that has more deaths before the age of 40? 46 deaths in two years....all you wrestling fans need to take a step back and look at the \"sport\" you guys love so much.\n\n\n\nI did not know that.\n\n\n\nI have not kept up with any wrestling news.\n\n\n\nWho are those 46 wrestler's?\n\nsellin71 Those Text messages seem to off.Why would he text to his friends his address.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe wanted someone to find the bodies and let the dogs free.

He strangled his wife on Friday night, and then smothered his son on Saturday morning. He missed an event Saturday, then the PPV on Sunday. Before he killed himself Saturday night he sent out a bunch of text messages from his and the wife's phones, one saying the wife and son were sick, a bunch of others giving his home address, and then one saying the garage door is open and the dogs are locked in the pool area. The police said they thought it was odd that he stayed in the house with the bodies for so long before killing himself.\n\n\n\nHe did it.\n\npatrickwm68 Now they're saying the son may have been killed with a choke hold.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=3320736&page=1\n\nendsongjen Now they're saying the son may have been killed with a choke hold.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=3320736&page=1\n\n\n\n:eek: what?! :mad:\n\npatrickwm68 :eek: what?! :mad:\n\n\n\nI know!!!

Benoit killed himself, wife Nancy and son authorities said.\n\nSteroid use\n\n\n\nHere's a look at some of the big-name wrestlers whose careers and lives were tainted by steroid use:\n\n\n\n1. (Hulk Hogan) Terry Gene Bollea, 53, ruled the ring throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, but admitted to using steroids in 1994. Testifying in the federal trial of Vince McMahon, the Hulk said the wrestling honcho knew he and other wrestlers were taking the drugs, but never ordered them to do so. McMahon was acquitted of distributing steroids to his wrestlers.\n\n\n\n2. (The British Bulldog) Davey Boy Smith, 39, died in 2002 of an enlarged heart, possibly caused by steroid abuse. One of his trainers said the popular grappler \"paid the price with steroid ****tails and human-growth hormones.\"\n\n\n\n3. Richard (Ravishing Rick Rude) Rood, 40, died from an overdose of \"mixed medications\" in April 1999. Years earlier, the long-haired wrestler admitted using anabolic steroids.\n\n\n\n4. Eddie Guerrero, 38, died of what was believed to be a steroid-related heart ailment in a Minneapolis hotel room in November 2005. He struggled with addictions to alcohol, painkillers and drugs for years.\n\n\n\nRichard Schapiro\n\nPro wrestler Chris Benoit apparently was pumping human-growth hormone into his 7-year-old son in the weeks before he killed his wife, the boy and himself at their suburban Atlanta home while consumed by \"roid rage,\" a prosecutor said yesterday.\n\n\n\nFayette County, Ga., District Attorney Scott Ballard said Daniel Benoit had needle marks on his arm. Ballard said he believed the boy had been given growth hormone because his parents considered the boy undersized.\n\n\n\n\"The boy was very small, even dwarfed,\" Ballard said.\n\n\n\nThe disturbing developments came as law enforcement officials were investigating whether Benoit suffered from \"roid rage\" when he strangled his wife and suffocated their son before hanging himself on a weight-machine pulley over the weekend.\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement sources told the Daily News that Benoit was a client of two businesses at the heart of a massive national steroid and HGH trafficking scam being probed by New York State prosecutors and narcotics agents.\n\n\n\nThe sources said a Florida company called MedXLife wrote prescriptions for Benoit that were filled at Signature Pharmacy in Orlando and shipped to his home in the Atlanta suburbs. The sources could not confirm what substances Benoit had received.\n\n\n\nThe musclebound Benoit - a former heavyweight champion known as \"The Canadian Crippler\" - killed his wife, Nancy, on Friday and smothered their sleeping son, Daniel, late Saturday or early Sunday, leaving Bibles by their bodies, authorities said.\n\n\n\nInvestigators who forced their way into Benoit's home after the weekend killing spree found anabolic steroids. Authorities said they want to know whether Benoit was unhinged by the drugs - which can cause paranoia, depression and explosive outbursts known as \"roid rage.\"\n\n\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment officials alerted cops after Benoit, 40, texted \"curious\" messages to pals over the weekend.\n\n\n\nSources told The News he was sending the wrestlers biblical passages and sections of his will.\n\n\n\nThe WWE posted text messages that Benoit allegedly sent on its Web site. One, sent four times, gave his address, and the other, sent once, said where to find his dogs.\n\n\n\nPolice said Benoit's 43-year-old wife was killed Friday in an upstairs family room, her feet and wrists were bound and there was blood under her head, indicating a possible struggle. Daniel was found dead in his bed.\n\n\n\nBenoit's 220-pound body was discovered in the basement. The Montreal-born athlete committed suicide as much as a day after killing his son, cops said.\n\n\n\nWhile police found anabolic steroids and \"a lot of prescription medication,\" there was no suicide note and cops had no motive. Cops said blood tests were being conducted to determine whether Benoit had been using steroids or other drugs.\n\n\n\nWWE warned against jumping to conclusions before toxicology reports were complete, which could take weeks.\n\n\n\nBenoit had canceled scheduled appearances Saturday and Sunday. The absences were blamed on a \"family emergency.\"\n\n\n\nProsecutors confirmed that Benoit's wife, a wrestling manager known as \"Woman,\" had filed for divorce in 2003 and asked for a restraining order. In court papers, Nancy Benoit said she was \"in reasonable fear for [her] own safety and that of the minor child.\"\n\n\n\nBut she asked for the case to be dismissed three months after filing.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime_file/2007/06/27/2007-06-27_tiny_son_got_illegal_boosts.html\n\nTony Coca This is the district attorney saying this.\n\n\n\nANd the DA cant be wrong.I still find it all to easy the way its being said it happened.\n\n\n\nIn all honesty,If you were in the situation and did what was said was done.Why would you go back.He had his alibie with the shows.If he did want to kill his family he could have covered it up,no need for the suicide.I still think someone else was involved.\n\npatrickwm68 Latest updates from Wrestling Observer:\n\n\n\nChris Benoit’s personal physician met with him the day of the murder, according to an Associated Press report. Dr. Phil Astin also said he prescribed testosterone to Benoit because of a low count being produced by his body. Astin said that condition likely stemmed from previous steroid use. Here is the link: http://www.accessnorthga.com/news/ap_newfullstory.asp?ID=94290\n\n\n\nThere are other details soon to surface nationally about the murder/suicide that include Nancy Benoit meeting with Astin the day before her murder to try and gain information about treating her son Daniel. WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt told me Daniel was suffering from Fragile X, which is an inherited mental impairment that causes autistic-like symptoms [more information about the disease can be found at FragileX.org]. McDevitt said it’s believed that Nancy Benoit was struggling trying to cope with Daniel after undergoing neck surgery. One question that can be posed is this: If Chris Benoit killed his wife in a fit of rage stemming from a confrontation about Daniel, did he later kill his son because of concerns about who would take care of a needs child while he was in prison? While this doesn’t make Benoit’s actions any more justifiable, the scenario may shed some light on why Chris Benoit killed his son before taking his own life.\n\nANGRYCOMICMAN ANd the DA cant be wrong.I still find it all to easy the way its being said it happened.\n\n\n\nIn all honesty,If you were in the situation and did what was said was done.Why would you go back.He had his alibie with the shows.If he did want to kill his family he could have covered it up,no need for the suicide.I still think someone else was involved.\n\n\n\nAnd OJ didn't do it.:stick:\n\nTony Coca And OJ didn't do it.:stick:\n\n\n\nof course he did.But he got away with it.Why cause he's alibie worked.\n\npatrickwm68 ANd the DA cant be wrong.I still find it all to easy the way its being said it happened.\n\n\n\nIn all honesty,If you were in the situation and did what was said was done.Why would you go back.He had his alibie with the shows.If he did want to kill his family he could have covered it up,no need for the suicide.I still think someone else was involved.\n\n\n\nGo back where? The police said he was at the house all weekend, he was never at the pay-per-view.\n\n\n\nWhen the story first broke, they said he was at the pay per view and left for a family emergency, this turned out be false. He didn't show up for a show on saturday and he didn't show for the payperview sunday. He text messaged to say his family was sick.\n\nANGRYCOMICMAN of course he did.But he got away with it.Why cause he's alibie worked.\n\n\n\nYou are smokin' too much of that stuff.:)\n\n\n\nBenoit should rot in hell.\n\nHe was a coward.\n\nAnd proved it by taking his own life.\n\nsellin71 Now they're saying the son may have been killed with a choke hold.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=3320736&page=1\n\n\n\nJust makes me want to puke.\n\nDark Knight There is also speculation now that he may have laid down in bed with his son, fallen asleep, and then his son's neck got caught in his arm in an accidental choke.

There's a lot of things about this situation we will never know. Did he kill his son on purpose or by accident? In the end, it doesn't really matter because his son will still be dead.\n\nThe General This whole Benoit thing has me sick already. This is just horrible. ****ing maniac is giving his son HGH because he was undersized. Are you kidding me????:mad:\n\n\n\nThe accidental choke thing has to be the worst speculation ever.\n\nTheJoker this whole thing came as a shock to me because i watched raw to see what happened to mcmahon and his apparent death and then they did the tribute.... cnn reported it as a murder suicide... it doesnt make sense to me and if its true that just makes me sick.... chris benoit was one of my favorite wrestlers and he was the type of guy that seemed very family orientated and whatnot.... also i read a report somewhere that he and his wife were going to get a divorce.... and his two other kids....its sad really\n\nDark Knight http://www.comcast.net/news/index.jsp?cat=GENERAL&fn=/2007/06/27/701068.html&cvqh=itn_wwebenoit\n\nDark Knight http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/benoitpressures\n\npatrickwm68 Detailed Benoit Timline from WWE.com:\n\n\n\nDetailed WWE/Benoit timeline\n\nWritten: June 26, 2007Below is a detailed WWE/Chris Benoit timeline from Saturday to Monday:\n\n\n\nSaturday, June 23, 2007\n\n\n\nChris Benoit was scheduled to appear at the WWE SmackDown/ECW live event in Beaumont, Texas.\n\n\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nA co-worker received a voice message from Benoit.
