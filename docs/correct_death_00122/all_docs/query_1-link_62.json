    "text": "Notice wwe took down all the tributes, Its because they have all but confirmed he murdered his wife and son in cold blood. It wasnt a act of blind rage but cold calculated murder. WWE.com says he binded his wifes arms and legs before hanging her, then waited a while before killing his son and then hisself. Leaving a bible at each body, Tieing her arms and legs and telling wwe he wouldnt be at the show, shows that he thought it through.\n\n\n\nI guess it was some sort of dispute, maybe she said the marrige was over or she had been cheating. A wreslting carrer and a family seem to be conflicting , on the road 300 days a year, it would be hard to be a good husband and father. So she says devoice and he tells his manger he wont be there for Vengence because he has to go home and sort a family emergency.\n\n\n\nHe could have walked in told his son to go to the neighbours house and then broke his wifes neck and killed himself. Why kill his son? the sicko! i dont care if he was a great wreslter he was a child killing monster and i hope he goes to hell.\n\n\n\nAlso i didnt really like him as a wreslter, sure he was a good guy, but his fights were slow and long, boring compared to real greats like hogan and the rock. He was a bret hart want to be, bret was great, chris was lame."
