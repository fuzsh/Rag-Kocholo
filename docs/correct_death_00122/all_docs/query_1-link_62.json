        "text": "As an avid pro-wrestling fan for the past several years.. and a smark of sorts.. I was shocked to learn of Benoit's death. Thankfully, WWE has canned McMahon's death storyline over the recent events.\n\nThe unconfirmed reports coming out of several media outlets right now are that it was a double murder-suicide. No one has yet confirmed who was the perpetrator or if this was even true. Other sources are spreading rumors that it was Carbon Monoxide.\n\nChris Benoit was a man I admired for a lot of reasons- his heart, determination, and respect for those who rightfully deserved it were reasons beyond his techincal wrestling prowess.\n\nAs a wrestler, I can't begin to explain what Chris Benoit was. Best technical wrestler of all time? Very possible. I can't think of a more qualified candidate. He consistently put on World Class matches with those much less talented than he and you'd never know the match was scripted if you didn't step back and say to yourself: whoa, this is WWE.\n\nI hope to God the reports coming out are untrue. I know it sounds silly, I can't imagine there are many WWE watchers on this forum, but I saw this topic and felt inclined to post this.\n\nRIP Chris, Linda and Daniel Benoit\n\nIf golf, auto racing, and mountain climbing can be considered sports, so can professional wrestling. Just because it follows a script doesn't make it any less physically demanding.\n\nBut on to the point. Benoit was one of my favorite wrestlers ever, and this situation has me deeply disturbed. I just really don't know what to feel, knowing someone I though of as a hero is having all signs pointing to him being a child killer.\n\nBut as far as the Raw tribute goes, they had just found out at pretty much the last minute, without any solid details on the situation. Their website had tributes to him all over the front page last night, but they've all been removed now.\n\nAnyway, I need to go play some Civ to get my mind off this."
