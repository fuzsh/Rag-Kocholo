        "text": "FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. -- Pro wrestler Chris Benoit strangled his wife, suffocated his 7-year-old son and placed Bibles next to their bodies before hanging himself with a weight-machine cord, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nInvestigators found anabolic steroids in the house and want to know whether \"The Canadian Crippler\" was unhinged by the bodybuilding drugs, which can cause paranoia, depression and explosive outbursts known as \" 'roid rage.\"\n\n\"In a community like this, it's bizarre to have a murder-suicide, especially involving the death of a 7-year-old,\" District Attorney Scott Ballard said.\n\nMontreal-born Benoit was one of the stars of the WWE wrestling circuit and was known for his wholesome family-man image. His wife, Nancy, was a stage manager who worked under the name \"Woman.\" They married in 2000.\n\nThe bodies were found Monday afternoon in a suburb 20 miles south of Atlanta.\n\nNancy Benoit, 43, was killed Friday in an upstairs family room, her feet and wrists bound, Ballard said, and Daniel was probably killed early Saturday in his bed.\n\nBenoit, 40, apparently hanged himself several hours and as long as a day later, Ballard said. His body was found in a downstairs weight room, hanging from the pulley of a piece of exercise equipment.\n\nClosed Bibles were placed next to the bodies of the wife and son, authorities said.\n\nBallard said Benoit had sent two text messages, one saying that his wife and son were sick. The other, to a neighbor, said the door to the house was open and the pets were outside. The prosecutor said they appeared to be an attempt to get someone to find the bodies after his suicide.\n\nThe boy had old needle marks in his arms, Ballard said. He said he had been told the parents considered him undersized and had given him growth hormones.\n\n\"The boy was very small, even dwarfed,\" Ballard said.\n\nToxicology test results may not be available for weeks, Ballard said. As for whether steroids played a role, he said: \"We don't know yet. That's one of the things we'll be looking at.\"\n\nThe WWE issued a news release Tuesday evening saying steroids \"were not and could not be related to the cause of death.\"\n\n\"The physical findings announced by authorities indicate deliberation, not rage,\" the company said, adding that Benoit tested negative April 10, the last time he was tested for drugs.\n\nBenoit was a quiet, roughhewn figure amid the glitz and bluster of pro wrestling. He performed under his real name, eschewed scripted personas and didn't bother to fix a gap where he had lost one of his front teeth. (According to the WWE Web site, he lost the tooth while roughhousing with his pet Rottweiler.) His signature move was the \"Crippler Crossface,\" in which he would lock his hands around an opponent's face and stretch his neck.\n\n\"You always rooted for him, because he was a good guy and he overcame the odds,\" said Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer, a weekly news letter. \"It's like if you watched 'Rocky,' and in the end it comes out that Rocky killed his wife and his son.\"\n\nBenoit met his wife in the 1990s when she was married to rival wrestler Kevin Sullivan. As part of the scripted rivalry, Benoit and Nancy were supposed to act as if they were having an affair. A real romance blossomed, and she left Sullivan for Benoit.\n\nNeighbors said the Benoits led a low-key lifestyle.\n\n\"We would see Chris walking in his yard from time to time. He wasn't rude, but he wasn't really outwardly warm,\" said Alaina Jones, who lives across the street.\n\nJimmy Baswell, who was Benoit's driver for more than five years, placed a white wreath at their gate. \"They always seemed like they were the happiest people,\" he said.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment said on its Web site that it asked authorities to check on Benoit and his family after being alerted by friends who had received \"several curious text messages sent by Benoit early Sunday morning.\"\n\n\"He was like a family member to me, and everyone in my family is taking it real hard,\" said fellow Canadian Bret Hart, a five-time champion.\n\nThe WWE canceled its live \"Monday Night RAW\" card in Corpus Christi, Texas, after the bodies were discovered.\n\nMonday's show was supposed to be a memorial service for WWE owner Vince McMahon. In a storyline concocted by the WWE, McMahon was supposedly \"assassinated\" in a limousine explosion two weeks earlier. McMahon appeared at the beginning of Monday's telecast and acknowledged the bombing was made up.\n\nThe McMahon storyline has been dropped.\n\n------ Associated Press writers Debbie Newby and Jason Bronis contributed to this report.\n\nAP-WS-06-26-07 2223EDT"
