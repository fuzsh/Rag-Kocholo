    "text": "Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero met in Japan\n\nTwo of the most acclaimed performers at the time, Benoit and Guerrero met while they were both working in Japan (Eddie was wrestling under a mask as the Black Tiger), and they’d really tear into each other in the ring. At first, Eddie’s widow Vickie said Eddie thought Chris was a “prick,” but their work was impressive and, again, inspirational; Eddie was Black Tiger, Chris was Wild Pegasus, and Jericho says that’s why he called himself “Lionheart” back then, to emulate their style. This dedication to the sport is what fueled Eddie and Chris’ friendship.\n\nChris met Nancy during their time in WCW\n\nIn one of the most infamous moments in pro wrestling during the ‘90s, Kevin Sullivan, who was married to Nancy (who was then working as one of the most ruthless managers in the industry, simply known as Woman), was also the “booker,” aka the guy who was writing the storylines for feuds taking place in a federation. Sullivan is the one who came up with the angle of Chris Benoit and Woman getting close as characters on-screen; their on-screen affair became a real-life affair, with Nancy eventually leaving Kevin Sullivan to be with Chris Benoit, who became her future husband. The joke was that Sullivan had “booked his own divorce,” but like Nancy’s sister Sandra noted, it sounds funny until you realize that it isn’t at all, especially when you realize that there were deeper issues between Kevin and Nancy that drove her to seek aid from Chris, who was having problems in his own marriage at the time.\n\nThe death of Eddie Guerrero really broke Chris Benoit\n\nOne of the most heartbreaking moments of the episode was Chavo Guerrero recounting how he found his uncle Eddie had died. Chavo shared that, for some time, Eddie would be passing out while in the middle of conversations with people. During a stay at a hotel during a string of house shows, Chavo was alerted that Eddie never answered his wake-up call at the room. They had to cut the latch on the hotel room door, where Chavo had found Eddie on the floor, passed out and gurgling; Eddie passed away while he was in Chavo’s arms. Word is that, while Eddie had been known to have substance abuse issues in the past, the verdict was that he hadn’t relapsed; he died from an enlarged heart.\n\nSoon enough, Chris called Chavo, unaware of the situation. When Chavo shared the news, he said Chris “wailed” on the phone. Many recounted that Chris would spend time just sobbing. He was crying during the televised tribute show and was severely broken up while talking about Eddie on-camera.\n\nJericho said that once Eddie passed, Chris became more of a hermit, and their relationship basically ended. Having to then fly out to Europe after Eddie’s funeral as opposed to taking time off to handle his emotions didn’t help. Vickie said that while he’d be at work, he’d put on a brave face, but when he was away from work, he’s a broken and distant and was said to have been acting different.\n\nNancy wanted Chris to step away from wrestling during the last year of his life\n\nJericho said that Benoit told him that every time he’d enter a building, all he would say was that the last time he was there, Eddie was there. Sandra recalled that Nancy felt if Chris continued to be in this environment, it would “eventually harm his well-being.”"
