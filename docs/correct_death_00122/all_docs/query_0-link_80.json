What the hell is going on!? Are there any details at all!?\n\nOA UNFREAKINGBELIEVABLE...\n\n\n\ni tried to find some info but only found a very short blurb on site saying that he and his family were all found dead today...terrible, terrible news....\n\nThirdMarioBro Jesus Christ. What the hell is happening lately?\n\nJamboree Ah, someone beat me to making this topic. But seriously, it's horrible. I still can't believe this.\n\nKROW I just heard about this recently. I am in utter shock. My only reaction was, \"What...?\" And to learn his family was also found dead... Horrible. Wrestling lost another diamond.\n\nDr. Doom This is why Vince's angle was such a horrible idea. I guess this is learning their lesson the hard way, at least maybe they learned something from these horrible circumstances.\n\nGK Punk I can't believe this. I dont know what to say.\n\nRaph's Girl http://www.twnpnews.com/messages/17644.shtml\n\n\n\nYea... it's all over the news now. Rumour has it it was a gas leak. Damn....his son was only 7! :( No more rabid Wolverine. Benoit was one of my faves too! :cry:\n\n\n\nI heard they made Raw a tribute to Chris Benoit (it was originally gonna be a Vince tribute) and Vince even appeared. It's not on for a couple hours here yet.\n\n\n\nHis wife was a WCW/ECW wrestler.\n\nOA gas leak?! Man, how freak accident is that...\n\n\n\nAt least, it doesnt seem to be another crazy murder/suicide situation...\n\nGK Punk She was a manager by the name of Woman. She managed Sandman, And Kevin Sullivan. She was actually married to Kevin Sullivan, untill a story was started where he stole Sullivan's wife. They ended up getting married.\n\n\n\nMe and my older Brother are two of the largest Chris Benoit fans you'll ever meet. We've been following him since ECW.\n\nTheGreenMagic I honestly don't know what to say. This is just horrible news.\n\nKROW A gas leak? Oh, man...\n\n\n\nI put a link to a video in my remembrance banner in my signature if anyone cares to watch it.\n\nKatie What a tragedy :cry:\n\n\n\nMay he and his family rest in peace\n\nKROW Here's a little more information on the situation. (http://www.ajc.com/news/content/metro/fayette/stories/2007/06/25/0625benoit.html)\n\n\n\nStrangely, this site (http://www.cbs46.com/sports/13568106/detail.html) uses different words like \"homocide\" and \"slain\" and also states that they were found at 2:30pm as opposed to 4pm.\n\n\n\nIn any event, my sincerest condolences to his two surviving children. :(\n\nKatie *shakes head*\n\n\n\nLife is so random. you really never know what the day will bring you.\n\nOA Here's a little more information on the situation.

We've been following him since ECW.\n\n\n\nMy brother is right with ya. RP'ed as him for years, too. Sadly, they were finally coming to our part of the country for the first time ever; bro had tickets to see him. It's in a week or something.\n\n\n\nVery, very sad. What a shame. Though I'll be honest; as soon as my brother told me and I asked if it was violent and he said no?\n\n\n\nFirst reaction: Carbon monoxide. Second reaction, some other gas leak. Shame, as that kinda could have been avoided.\n\n\n\nBut really, really sad. I liked him. My prayers and condolences to his family, friends and fans. It's a damn shame.\n\nRaph's Girl Im hoping that he wasn't slain cuz that would be too much...especially with a little boy involved.\n\n\n\nHowever I was told this. \"ALL deaths are initially treated as a homicide until cause of death is found, once they rule it as accidental or by natural causes, its done.\"\n\nGK Punk My brother is right with ya. RP'ed as him for years, too. Sadly, they were finally coming to our part of the country for the first time ever; bro had tickets to see him. It's in a week or something.\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, I got to see him live on my birthday a few years ago. He teamed with Chris Jericho. It was a double geekgasm for me.\n\nPeanut I've been lucky enough to see Benoit on a couple occasions. Including at WCW Mayhem 99, where I got to witness him in not one, but two matches, including the classic against Bret Hart for the WCW Title in the main event. He was walking around the ring before the show started, so the few of us in the sky boxes were screaming out to him, he ended up coming up and signing a bunch of stuff for everyone.\n\n\n\nMan...this really f*cking sucks...\n\nKROW However I was told this. \"ALL deaths are initially treated as a homicide until cause of death is found, once they rule it as accidental or by natural causes, its done.\"\n\nYes, that's true. I was going to say that police deem it as such initially before investigating further, but you beat me to the punch. ;)\n\nRaven This is terrible, I just dont know what to say. :cry:\n\n\n\nMy prays go out to there family, I hope there doing alright.\n\nMike Bock This was shocking, I can't beleive he is gone.:cry:\n\nThis is just awful. He was a great wrestler one of my favorites.\n\nWhat's happening lately ? :-?\n\nThe Stryker God dammit.\n\n\n\nReally Really sad, I've lost both of my favorite wrestlers in a matter of 2 years.\n\nKROW What's happening lately ? :-?\n\nI know... Bam Bam, Sherri, and now Benoit and his family; all in the course of six months. It's so tragic...\n\nRaph's Girl Just read that autopsy results on the causes of death for Chris, Nancy, and Daniel will be announced tomarrow (Tuesday). But ATM even the wwe site is saying murder-suicide. :ohwell:\n\nPeanut Yep. Double-murder suicide. Holy f*ck. WWE.com has it on there, straight up.\n\nKROW I just went there and... am even more shocked. How? And why?\n\nJetsAndHeels Check out this report from yahoo, which was just posted:\n\n\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ga. - WWE wrestler Chris Benoit, his wife, and son were found dead Monday and police said they were investigating the deaths as a murder-suicide.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\nDetective Bo Turner told television station WAGA that the case was being treated as a murder-suicide, but said that couldn't be confirmed until evidence was examined by a crime lab.\n\n\n\nThe station said that investigators believe the 40-year-old Benoit killed his wife, Nancy, and 7-year-old son, Daniel, over the weekend, then himself on Monday. A neighbor called police, and the bodies were found in three rooms.\n\nRaph's Girl The station said that investigators believe the 40-year-old Benoit killed his wife, Nancy, and 7-year-old son, Daniel, over the weekend, then himself on Monday.

How could a man just simply kill his 7 year old son?! That's just insane! Im just glad his 2 other kids weren't there! :o\n\nCure I stopped watching when WWE split into Raw and Smackdown, but I remember Chris Benoit fondly. I liked him along with X-Pac the most.....\n\n\n\nThis seems like something straight outta movie. I guess the man wasn't as mentally strong as he was physically.......:cry:\n\nStorm Wolf Check out this report from yahoo, which was just posted:\n\n\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ga. - WWE wrestler Chris Benoit, his wife, and son were found dead Monday and police said they were investigating the deaths as a murder-suicide.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\nDetective Bo Turner told television station WAGA that the case was being treated as a murder-suicide, but said that couldn't be confirmed until evidence was examined by a crime lab.\n\n\n\nThe station said that investigators believe the 40-year-old Benoit killed his wife, Nancy, and 7-year-old son, Daniel, over the weekend, then himself on Monday. A neighbor called police, and the bodies were found in three rooms.\n\n\n\nAll I can say is....WOW. I'm in utter shock and disbelief about the whole ordeal. What could have lead to such a tragedy? I never would have thought Benoit to be the type of guy to pull that off. I sincerely hope it's not true that he killed his family like that.\n\nJetsAndHeels I hope that isnt the cause either, but still its a tragic story nonetheless.\n\n\n\nWe will probably know more tomorrow after the autopsy results.\n\nMr._Mutant_Man I really hope this isn't true either.:(\n\nMike Bock I can't think of Benoit as a killer this is just so hard to swallow.:( I hope this clears out.\n\n\n\nI can't wait to read the news about them tomorrow.\n\nSonic x 20 I hope that it's not true as well man. Chris Benoit is not the type that kills. He's respected by alot of people very much and he loved his family very much as well. He was also one of my favorite wrestlers and one of the greatest as well to step into the WWE ring. We'll see what info occurs next about this case on the news.\n\njeff the cheff How do you know what type of person he is if you know him from his act?\n\n\n\nIsn't that like saying Steve Martin would never kill somebody because in Cheaper by the Dozen he was super cool to the kids and seemed really nice?\n\nRevan Oh my goodness. That is horrible. This man was one of my idols growing up.\n\nJetsAndHeels One of the great moments in wrestling:\n\n\n\nhttp://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h217/RRWilliams/WWF%202001/Eddie_Benoit-Champions.jpg\n\n\n\nhowever its sad bc now both of these stars are gone.\n\nThat Matt Guy How do you know what type of person he is if you know him from his act?\n\n\n\nYeah, no telling what kind of a person he was behind closed doors.\n\nRaph's Girl From what Steph. Chavo, and Edge said he was a good guy behind the scenes and loved his family, loved all kids, very much. He was very well respected in and outside of the ring. Im watching the Raw tribute right now and even the commentators said how good a dad he was and how well behaved his kids are.\n\n\n\nSo I don't believe for one second that he killed his wife and son. But apperantly a weopon of some sort was discovered in the house. :ohwell:\n\nJetsAndHeels No matter the cause of death, who did it, etc. it is still a tragic and sad story. To see both adults, and especially their young child dead is something horrible beyond imagination.\n\nKrang This is very shocking and tragic news. :( I was a big fan of Benoit, and it's hard to believe that something like this happened...\n\nThirdMarioBro I just can't see that man killing his family. I know enough to know that. This really has been the summer from hell thus far. Just horrible. :(\n\nVaughnMichael I really cant believe this is true but it is Chris was so awsome I'm so shocked. :(\n\nRaph's Girl Current news:c/o CNN:\n\n\n\nEvery indication is that this is a murder-suicide,\" District Attorney Scott Ballard told The Citizen, adding that he was confident in his belief that Benoit killed his wife, then his son, then himself. Reports have been made that the bodies were found in three separate rooms, and that no gun was involved. Ballard declined to release the cause of death, but said that earlier news reports that the Benoits died of gunshots were false.\n\n\n\nPope said \"the instruments of death were located on scene,\" but would not specify what those instruments are or where in the house the bodies were found. Pope added the department is \"not actively searching for any suspects outside of the house.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nApperantly WWE and Benoit's friends/family got some strange text messages from Benoit and they in turn called the cops to go to the house. I wonder what those messages were?\n\n\n\nThey're still not saying how they died but Chris was apperantly found in the weight room.\n\n\n\nSo as far as they're conserned he did it. :ohwell:\n\nKROW As disappointing as it seems, I still refuse to believe that Benoit would be capable of doing something so intensely violent and horrifying. If it indeed comes out to be true, I will be utterly heartbroken and feel almost betrayed, having spent my impressionable teen years watching him in and out of the ring.\n\njeff the cheff Wasn't his job to...hurt people in the ring? Not saying that makes you a violent person in real life, I'm sure most of them aren't. I'm just saying that it doesn't seem too surprising to me, although I know it must be hard to believe your idol would do something like that.\n\nZariusTwo So there's my big advice. Separate Chris Benoit - The Person from Chris Benoit -The Wrestler and enjoy the old DVDs of his matches. Case solved.\n\n\n\nNow, once you figure out how to do that, let me know.\n\n\n\nWrestlingisanity.com\n\n\n\nCould'nt have put it better myself. Ignore how it ended people, remember only how he lived his life.\n\nJetsAndHeels Here is an interesting tidbit that someone posted on the Jets board I frequent...remember this is not fact, just something they posted..I don't really believe it but I thought it would be interesting to see what you guys thought:\n\n\n\n\"My sister just got off the phone with someone from that area who's relative is a cop. and we got a whole differnt story.. Benoit flew home sunday night for a family emergency. His wife killed his 7 year old son. smothered him with a trashbag. when chris found out when he got home he then strangled his wife with a phone cord and killed himself.\n\n\n\nnow I can beleive that. I really do beleive he loved his son and wouldn't harm him at all. and would kill his wife for killing his son.\n\n\n\nRIP Benoit family.\"\n\nRaph's Girl Just announced on CNN:\n\n\n\nChris Benoit hanged himself after smothering his son and strangling his wife. They're blaming him for the whole thing. :ohwell:\n\nJetsAndHeels Just announced on CNN:\n\n\n\nChris Benoit hanged himself after smothering his son and strangling his wife. They're blaming him for the whole thing. :ohwell:\n\n\n\nYeah, I saw that..here is the article:\n\n\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ga. (AP) - Pro wrestler Chris Benoit strangled his wife and smothered his son before hanging himself in his weight room, a law enforcement official close to the investigation told The Associated Press Tuesday.\n\nThe official spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAuthorities also said they are investigating whether steroids may have been a factor in the deaths of Benoit, his wife and their 7-year-old son who were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide.\n\n\n\nFayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said test results may not be back for weeks or even months.\n\n\n\nAutopsies were scheduled Tuesday by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation in DeKalb County.\n\n\n\nThe bodies were found Monday afternoon in three separate rooms of the house, off a gravel road about two miles from the Whitewater Country Club.\n\n\n\nFayette County Coroner C.J. Mowell did not return calls seeking comment. The answering service for his funeral home said he was out of town.\n\n\n\nAuthorities also declined to say whether drugs or steroids were found inside the house. \"We're not releasing any information as far as what was located inside the house,\" sheriff's Sgt. Keith Whiteside said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nAsked about the condition of the interior of the house, Whiteside said investigators found \"nothing really out of the ordinary.\" He said Benoit was found in the home's weight room, his wife in an office and the son in an upstairs bedroom.\n\n\n\nWhiteside said toxicology tests could take up to a week or longer to complete.\n\nHalfcourtGame This is a tragic story, but I don't know how people can \"refuse to believe\" Benoit is the guilty party. He doesn't show up to work on Sunday due to a \"family emergency\" and he and his family are found dead the next day; all signs point to murder/suicide. A terrible tragedy but let's not fool ourselves here.\n\nMadPirateBunny all I can really say is holy-frickin-crap.\n\n\n\nI wonder how they're going to handle the whole who-done-Vince-in thing with this hanging over them now.\n\nRaph's Girl Oi vei they just said on CNN: In 2003 Nancy Benoit filed for divorce and a restraining order on Chris, fearing for her life. He appearantly threatened her. But she changed her mind.....Oi...\n\n\n\nApperantly the chain of events is:\n\n\n\nSaturday: Strangled his wife in her office\n\nSunday: Smothered his son in his bedroom\n\nMonday: Hanged himself in his weight room\n\n\n\nMore will come out in a couple min during the news conference. :o\n\nKROW This is a tragic story, but I don't know how people can \"refuse to believe\" Benoit is the guilty party. He doesn't show up to work on Sunday due to a \"family emergency\" and he and his family are found dead the next day; all signs point to murder/suicide. A terrible tragedy but let's not fool ourselves here.\n\nI refuse to believe it because I want finality and definite evidence before I pass judgment on anything. I don't jump to conclusions regardless of police speculation. For the record, I'm not a blind fan of Benoit and rest in denial no matter what the truth brings. Like I said, if it comes to be true that he indeed was responsible for this, then I would be crushed.\n\n\n\nWith that said, and with everything that has transpired and brought to light, I am very saddened and disheartened by this chain of events. I'm grief-stricken that something like this could happen and even be caused by a man like Chris Benoit. But, like all of us, he was human and most likely had a very difficult time struggling with his personal life. I still respect him as a performer and a wrestler, though the esteem I held toward the man has dropped dramatically.\n\n\n\nI am frozen in disbelief over this whole thing; not wanting to believe it but unable to deny the facts.\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope his friends, his family, and his fans can forgive him for his rash actions.\n\nOA Well, via live news conference right now it has officially been ruled a double homocide/suicide....\n\nThat Matt Guy All I can say is a great legacy and career has been ruined. He was an excellent wrestler and performer, but I guess not everything was as it appeared to be in his personal life.\n\nOA And another interesting tidbit from the conference...\n\n\n\nApparently, all of the bodies had Bibles lying next to them...\n\nRaph's Girl Ok...here's what the press conference revealed\n\n\n\nNancy Benoit's feet and hands were tied together and she was wrapped in a towel and there were signs of a struggle. Died possably Friday\n\n\n\nDaniel's body was found in his bed. Died possably Saturday\n\n\n\nChris died in the basement in his weight room. The chord on his weights killed him.\n\n\n\nA bible was placed next to the bodies of his wife and son.\n\n\n\nPrescription steroids were found.\n\nVaughnMichael And another interesting tidbit from the conference...\n\n\n\nApparently, all of the bodies had Bibles lying next to them...\n\nit was the under taker and paul bearer..sorry to joke but I must admit thats the first thing that came to mind...this is all really creepy.\n\nMr. Snackpants How do you know what type of person he is if you know him from his act?\n\n\n\nIsn't that like saying Steve Martin would never kill somebody because in Cheaper by the Dozen he was super cool to the kids and seemed really nice?\n\n\n\nWasn't his job to...hurt people in the ring? Not saying that makes you a violent person in real life, I'm sure most of them aren't. I'm just saying that it doesn't seem too surprising to me, although I know it must be hard to believe your idol would do something like that.\n\n\n\nExactly my thoughts.\n\n\n\nHow does anyone who doesn't know him know what he is really like? You can tell what a person is like by interviews or how his character acts. This really doesn't shock me at all. He was a huge wrestler on steroids. His job was pain. I'm sure a lot of wrestlers are aggressive in their normal lives. He must have just snapped, due to what nobody knows. This is just sickening, not shocking.\n\n\n\nOn a side note....I was watching the news last night. They were reporting on this story and said, \"Benoit was a well known and beloved wrestler. He was been wrestling since xxxx and was a 2 time WWE champion.\" Now, why say he was a \"2 time WWE champion\"? Are they reporting the death of Chris Benoit the wrestling character or Chris Benoit the human being? I mean, are f'ing joking me!?!?!\n\nRevan Ok...here's what the press conference revealed\n\n\n\nNancy Benoit's feet and hands were tied together and she was wrapped in a towel and there were signs of a struggle. Died possably Friday\n\n\n\nDaniel's body was found in his bed. Died possably Saturday\n\n\n\nChris died in the basement in his weight room. The chord on his weights killed him.\n\n\n\nA bible was placed next to the bodies of his wife and son.\n\n\n\nPrescription steroids were found.\n\nWow I can't believe this. I trust me father with my life and I love him very much. I can't even imagine... What a horrific event\n\nKROW Chris Benoit's job wasn't to inflict pain on anybody. When Joanie Laurer, a.k.a. Chyna, wrote her book on wrestling in the WWE, she stated that during her match with Benoit, she was put in his Crippler Crossface and said that he was so gentle and that it didn't hurt at all.\n\n\n\nPeople, it's called sports entertainment because 90% of what they do is acting. When someone is writhing in agony on the mat or the floor, odds are that they're acting like they're hurt. On the rare occasion that a wrestler gets injured, it's usually due to a freak accident or a misstep. Benoit himself broke his neck in a match by landing wrong during a maneuver. Meanwhile, the opponent he did the move to seemed to have landed harder and got up whereas Benoit was hospitalized and needed surgery. Triple H needed knee surgery twice over because he strained his own leg muscles. Kurt Angle received concussion after concussion because he refused to get treated. More often than not, these guys are a danger to themselves and not their opponents.\n\n\n\nPro wrestlers (most of them) train and buff up not just to look pretty, but having a thick physique helps take the bumps and bangs that are guaranteed to be received during their careers. As for the steroid use, I'm not sure why Benoit would be taking them other than muscle mass. But, they were prescribed to him, so they were not illegal.\n\n\n\nAlso, the amount of wrestlers that are aggressive in their personal lives is far outweighed by the ones who aren't. The difference is damn near insurmountable. I go to events on occasion and sometimes get the rare chance of meeting a few of the performers. Some of them want to be left alone and ignore the crowds right off, others exchange casual banter, and then there's some who take the time to to meet and greet. Of course, this is how they display themselves to the paying audience and not their families, but when you experience an encounter like that, you become convinced that the person is nice to everyone and wouldn't hurt a fly... unless you're too cynical.\n\nJo Dawn I dunno. Something's off here; doesn't make sense. Not that any of it has to make sense. To kill her Friday and the kid Saturday... where WAS the kid for that one whole day?\n\n\n\nOur news here has been touting this as a 'bizarre, out of the ordinary' cause of death, to which I thought of as something unseen before. So I kinda feel like we're missing something here... Especially with the time lapses between deaths. That has me intrigued. You mean not ONE PERSON queried as to their whereabouts for two days? I don't buy that, sorry.\n\n\n\nThere's more to this than is being told.\n\nVaughnMichael I dunno. Something's off here; doesn't make sense. Not that any of it has to make sense.

It's one thing to kill your wife/lover out of anger, jealousy, etc., but to then take the life of your own child, well, thats a whole other world....you must be TRULY disturbed take such action...again, not to excuse killing the wife, but we all know that these things happen all the time in fits of rage (and to a lesser extent, premeditated)...but to kill your own child, you must have to be in such a severe mental state...\n\n\n\nI dunno...words fail me...such a tragedy...\n\nKROW You know... Thinking about it, it could have been that his wife killed the child, then he killed her out of rage and then himself out of grief.\n\nMr._Mutant_Man Wasn't his job to...hurt people in the ring? Not saying that makes you a violent person in real life, I'm sure most of them aren't. I'm just saying that it doesn't seem too surprising to me, although I know it must be hard to believe your idol would do something like that.\n\n\n\nSo someone who acts out violence for a movie role is more likely to kill by that logic?\n\n\n\nMost of the people in the business are probably decent. One went nuts. Possibly due to steroids seeming like a necessity to some, but the pro-wrestling business itself is not to blame for the actions of an individual.\n\nKROW Right. Come on, folks. Just because these guys throw each other around and yell threats at each other doesn't mean that they're all violent bastards. Please learn about the business before assuming things.\n\njeff the cheff I didn't assume anything. I'm just saying Pro-wrestlers are probably no more or less likely to commit acts of violence than anyone else. But how is anyone surprised at all about this, you know him only through an act, which happens to be violent.\n\nWingnut This just puzzles me. It just doesn't seem like someone could be disturbed enough to kill their own wife and child and not set off some sort of suspicion amongst the people he knew...That's what I don't get. Then again I didn't know him personally. I don't know, it's a sad time for professional wrestling right now.\n\nKROW But how is anyone surprised at all about this, you know him only through an act, which happens to be violent.\n\nWhat does that mean? If Joe Q. Public did the same thing, I would be surprised and ask myself how anyone could do such a thing. If I did something like this, my friends and family would be equally surprised. So you're not because he's a wrestler or because he's human like the rest of us?\n\n\n\nAlso, even though I mostly know Benoit through his performance on television, that doesn't disclude how his closest friends know him. I can assure you that Dean Malenko and Chavo Guerrero are surprised as hell about this. And from hearing how they felt about Benoit and how they lived with him, I would take their word for it.\n\nRevan I didn't assume anything. I'm just saying Pro-wrestlers are probably no more or less likely to commit acts of violence than anyone else. But how is anyone surprised at all about this, you know him only through an act, which happens to be violent.\n\n\n\nI'm surprised because he had money and popularity and a family. What else is there? Plus anytime something horrible and sick like this happens, it's surprising. To me anyway\n\nNightwatcher You know... Thinking about it, it could have been that his wife killed the child, then he killed her out of rage and then himself out of grief.\n\n\n\nThe autopsy says the wife was dead a day before the son.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople also brought up the nice things people said about him during the tribute RAW to him. You have to add into the fact that he had just died so no one is really going to say, \"He did have some rage problems with his wife.\" Or, \"Sometimes he seemed a little emotionally unstable.\" I'm not saying either of these things are true, but they weren't going to say anything but nice things about him on the show.\n\nKROW People also brought up the nice things people said about him during the tribute RAW to him.

At the time, they had no idea what the cause of death was so they couldn't attribute any inclination to any possible internal struggles. Also, it was a tribute presentation. Saying anything off the cuff like that would have been deemed unprofessional and most likely not make it to air.\n\nRaven Its very sad to hear about this, but as many have stated the case seems a bit off. I'm sure the main reason that it seems odd is because we dont know the mental state of these people during that time.\n\n\n\nCould it be possible that Chris was so worried about losing his wife that he thought better to kill?\n\n\n\nThere could be thousands of reasons, really this would make more sense if we just knew what state of mind all these people were. Which I'm sure well get some closure on once we starting hearing stories from the families later on about the moments before this horrible event.\n\njeff the cheff What does that mean? If Joe Q. Public did the same thing, I would be surprised and ask myself how anyone could do such a thing. If I did something like this, my friends and family would be equally surprised. So you're not because he's a wrestler or because he's human like the rest of us?\n\n\n\nAlso, even though I mostly know Benoit through his performance on television, that doesn't disclude how his closest friends know him. I can assure you that Dean Malenko and Chavo Guerrero are surprised as hell about this. And from hearing how they felt about Benoit and how they lived with him, I would take their word for it.\n\n\n\nI meant to question why anyone was surprised that this particular person did this particular act. I guess it is surprising that anybody would do that, but I meant that there isn't a reason to be more surprised that he did it than if Joe Q. Public did it.\n\nKROW I meant to question why anyone was surprised that this particular person did this particular act. I guess it is surprising that anybody would do that, but I meant that there isn't a reason to be more surprised that he did it than if Joe Q. Public did it.\n\nFair enough.\n\n\n\nHere's the latest from WWE.com:\n\n\n\nSTAMFORD, Conn., June 26, 2007 – World Wrestling Entertainment is stunned and saddened by the details released by local authorities concerning the double homicide-suicide involving Chris Benoit, his wife, Nancy, and his son, Daniel.\n\n\n\nHowever, WWE is concerned with the sensationalistic reporting and speculation being undertaken by some members of the media following the press conference held by the Fayette County Sheriff’s Department and the District Attorney. During the press conference, the investigating authorities made the following points, all of which run contrary to the media speculation that \"roid rage\" was a factor in the senseless murders and suicide:\n\n\n\n1. The authorities stated that all drugs found in the house were believed to be legal prescriptions.\n\n\n\n2. Steroids were not, and could not, be related to the cause of death (asphyxiation). Authorities had no factual basis to speculate as to Benoit’s state of mind, and rightly did not do so.\n\n\n\n3. Toxicology tests have not even been completed, so there is no current evidence that Benoit even had steroids or any other substance in his body. In that regard, on the last test done on Benoit by WWE's independently administered drug testing program, done on April 10, 2007, Benoit tested negative.\n\n\n\n4. The physical findings announced by authorities indicate deliberation, not rage. The wife's feet and hands were bound and she was asphyxiated, not beaten to death. By the account of the authorities, there were substantial periods of time between the death of the wife and the death of the son, again suggesting deliberate thought, not rage. The presence of a Bible by each is also not an act of rage.\n\n\n\n5. WWE strongly suggests that it is entirely wrong for speculators to suggest that steroids had anything to do with these senseless acts, especially when the authorities plainly stated there is no evidence that Benoit had steroids in his body, pending the toxicological reports, and that they had no evidence at this time as to the motive for these acts.\n\n\n\nWWE is continuing to monitor the ongoing investigation being conducted by local authorities.\n\n\n\nSo, until proven otherwise, steroids have nothing to do with this and it would be appreciated if it isn't mentioned again in an accusatory sense.\n\nDuke I used to watch wrestling all the time and Chris Benoit was an amazing talent and I'm truly saddened for the entire Benoit family. I don't believe for one second that he killed his wife and son. But apperantly a weopon of some sort was discovered in the house. :ohwell:However, statements like this and others in the thread are ludicrous. Unless I'm mistaken, no one here knew the man personally and even if you did know him personally it still doesn't mean he couldn't have done it. Plus the fact that some wrestlers and close friends said great things about his personal life, doesn't mean a thing either. Some of the meanest people on earth are also the most two-faced people on earth. Just because you act one way in public, and even the same way around your closest friends, doesn't mean you still don't go home and beat the hell out of your wife and kids. I'm not trying to suggest in any way Benoit ever did this but I'm also not willing to say I don't believe for one second he couldn't have done it either. People talk about skeletons in closests and events that happen behind close doors because they do exist and no one ever suspects them to.\n\nZariusTwo I'm more inclined to accept Benoit did it, even if I will never lose my respect for his professional accomplishments. He WAS professional wrestling, and I doubt any will replace him in regards to the work ethic and effort he put in to elevate and propel talents he worked with.\n\n\n\nI blame him, I blame the scheduling, I blame the steroids, I blame the domestic problems he had, I blame the emotional turmoil of events such as Eddie's death, and I blame Vince not grasping his buisness needs to take rest periods, or at best, a social system so that talents can have someone to talk to regarding issues such as long time seperation from family and losses of freinds.\n\n\n\nBenoit was professional wrestling, he was it's ups, and it's downs, it's greatest victories, and it's greatest tragedies. He was it's art and innocense, and he was it's stigma. Benoit's story, one of glory and commendability, will now sadly be regarded by the ignorant as a cruelly ignored and resented career.\n\nGK Punk Wasn't his job to...hurt people in the ring? Not saying that makes you a violent person in real life, I'm sure most of them aren't. I'm just saying that it doesn't seem too surprising to me, although I know it must be hard to believe your idol would do something like that.\n\n\n\nGot to think of it like this, Kiefer Sutherland spends time making a show like 24. Now, if He did this It wouldn't really be fair to say that it's not surprising, because he did it in movies.\n\n\n\nAnd yeah, a lot of the denial going around Wrestling fans is because of how well respected he was, not only with the fans, but in the industry as well. Everyone spoke highly of how much he loved his family, and how he is a true class act, etc. Then what seems like out of nowhere, he murders, violently his Wife and one of his Children. I can't blame people for being in denial over it. I wish I still was.\n\n\n\nI feel really disgusted by him right now though. I feel incredibly betrayed.\n\n\n\nNot picking fights or anything at anyone, just offering my way of looking at it.\n\nKatie I'm surprised because he had money and popularity and a family. What else is there?\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what? you can't be unhappy with these things? The grass is always greener on the other side. As much as I want the family thing, I have plenty of friends who have exactly what I want but would trade places with me in a heartbeat.\n\n\n\nMoney, Popularity, and Family =/= Automatic Happy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a horrible tragedy for all involved. Whatever pushed him over the edge...whatever circumstances it was...whatever. whenever, all of it. whether it was this famous person or Joe Schmo next door....it is still a tragedy.\n\nTMNT I find the fact that the WWE is grief stricken yet is also rather defensive about this whole steroids thing (they always were) really unsettling. I mean, they're going to crack down on the WWE as they have done in other sports on the topic of steroids but for the company to kind of cover their own behind like that just doesn't seem right. Regardless, this event has just been downright tragic all the way through and I just hope more light is shed on the case. It'll provide some much needed closure.\n\nVoltron It's a pity we all can't just hop on a pegasus and ride away from this tragedy.\n\n\n\nI still can't believe they did a tribute to him.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously, I was half expecting to see a tribute to Scott Peterson afterwards. It's something we all idolize, anymore, I suppose. Deadbeats, grinning like wolverines. . .\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all honesty, I have no idea what would drive a man to kill his own child. I just can't believe some of the things that happen in the world. Sends a shudder right down my spine.\n\nGK Punk That's really unfair to say. It was being reported on the news at the time that a gas leak was the likely cause for their deaths. The WWE Runs tributes to any current star on the roster that suddenly dies. On top of that, they had to run something in their 3 hour programing block.\n\n\n\nAlso, despite how horrible and unforgivable his actions were, these people lost a very close friend. and again, as far as they knew he didn't hurt his family.\n\n\n\nWWE pulled all of the Tribute videos and images of Benoit down as soon as they knew what was going on, before it was even reported in the news.\n\n\n\nIt's unfair to point any blame at the company. Go to their site and look at it, almost any reference to Chris Benoit is gone. Even his Profile.\n\nVoltron Without taking a polemic tone, I want to say that I heard murder/suicide as a cause of death the day it showed. I caught in on a local radio talk show.\n\n\n\nIn all reality, I'm sure that the man's family is falling to pieces. I don't know what it's like to lose a grandchild or nephew to these circumstances, but I'd imagine it leaves that hollow pressure in your chest that doesn't seem to go away, no matter how hard you try to forget.\n\n\n\nHowever, I still feel a bit agitated that the guy was glorified in such a hurry.\n\n\n\nThat's all I have to say on the matter.\n\nGK Punk Don't get me wrong, Voltron I have no issues with your general disgust over it. I'm absolutely horrified over it. But when watching the show, not knowing what really happened, it was really emotional watching these old clips of his career. Now, I'll be honest for the time being I have no interest in watching any Benoit footage.\n\n\n\nI'm just trying to say that they recieved the news that Benoit was dead when they arrived to the arena, a short time before the show went on the air. They basically followed their normal protocol in this instance, and his now about ready to apparently apoligize for it. (On ECW Vince is schedueled to say something about it...) I've also heard WWE isn't going to air that \"Tribute\" In any international markets. No replays of this will ever be shown. I think they realize the tribute was a bad idea now.\n\nMr. Snackpants [COLOR=\"Yellow\"]So, until proven otherwise, steroids have nothing to do with this and it would be appreciated if it isn't mentioned again in an accusatory sense.\n\n\n\nOk so he was sick nut-job then.\n\n\n\nThat's much better...\n\nX Hope I don't get modded for my opinion, but Benoit is a coward true to form. I hope no one shows and cries at his funeral, because death is too good for his sorry ass.\n\n\n\nHe didn't have to kill an innocent kid, who couldn't fight back, and now I hope someone crippler crossfaces his rotting corpse.\n\n\n\nSorry for the last bit, but I have two kids, and I love them to death. Everytime I hear sick crap like this, I look at my kids and think, how can anyone do something so sick. He is a selfish freak who deserves to have his grave peed on many times.\n\n\n\nNow everytime I hear more stories about this, I think about the poor kid saying, \"daddy please stop, I love you,\" only for this snaggle toothed punk to ice him.\n\n\n\nI swear if I were to know Benoit in person, I'd ruin his funeral, well maybe not really, but that kid couldn't defend himself.\n\n\n\nSorry I said this, but it's how I feel as a parent.\n\n\n\nEDIT: By the way, during the time his son and wife were getting killed, think about how many people were taking advantage of life, and not being thankful for just waking up to another beautiful day.\n\n\n\n-X-\n\nKROW It's a pity we all can't just hop on a pegasus and ride away from this tragedy.\n\n\n\nSeriously, I was half expecting to see a tribute to Scott Peterson afterwards. It's something we all idolize, anymore, I suppose. Deadbeats, grinning like wolverines. . .\n\n\n\nNot funny or witty, despite your ego. I don't appreciate those comments. I made the image in my signature with a poetic ode to the man's career. The next time you intend to piss on someone's effort to express himself, I suggest you think twice.\n\n\n\nAnd he wasn't glorified for f**k's sake. They held a tribute to his accomplishments in the ring while wrestlers shared moments they had with him. This was before the whole situation was ruled a double murder/suicide.\n\nWingnut Wow, the text messages are crazy...“My physical address is 130 Green Meadow Lane.\n\nFayetteville Georgia. 30215”\n\n\n\ndamn.\n\nJetsAndHeels One thing to keep in mind is that the tribute was done for the WWE and the atheletes. Yes, Benoit committed a horrible crime but still these people lost a friend, a brother that alot of them worked with for many years. You can imagine the shock and grief they felt.\n\nAlso at the time it was not known that it was a double murder/suicide. It was merely done in his memory for his time with the organization and in the sport.\n\nI hate what happened, and it was a horrific tragedy that he did this, but still remember that alot of the people working for the WWE have lost someone too, and you can bet they are just as shocked and disgusted as alot of us are.\n\nPeanut Even as a huge Benoit fan, I don't see how anyone can still look at the man as anything other than a sick and demented scum bag. He was an amazing f*cking wrestler, he put on some clinics, but nothing can make up for such a despicable act of cowardice. I don't care how epic his matches were, he deserves no praise, and he deserves no sympathy. All he deserves is a spot in Hell.\n\nSassyGal I have to say this whole tragedy just makes me ill. All I can think of is how can a man kill his son? I had one hell of a day trying to wrangle my sister's boy, but no matter what he did, I just loved him to pieces. When I look at his little face, I can't imagine ever even thinking about hurting him, never mind killing him! As a person who desperately wants a child, it makes me so mad that anyone would take a precious gift like that and throw it away! I am so disappointed in anyone who does something like this.\n\nKROW More information from WWE.com:\n\n\n\nBelow is a detailed WWE/Chris Benoit timeline from Saturday to Monday:\n\n\n\nSaturday, June 23, 2007\n\n\n\nChris Benoit was scheduled to appear at the WWE SmackDown/ ECW live event in Beaumont, Texas\n\n\n\n3:30pm\n\nA co-worker received a voice message from Benoit. The message from Benoit stated he missed his flight and over slept and would be late to the WWE Live Event. The co-worker called Benoit back, Benoit confirmed everything he said in his voice message and sounded tired and groggy. Benoit then stated, “I love you”. The co-worker stated that it was “out of context.”\n\n\n\n3:42pm\n\nThe same co-worker was concerned with Benoit’s tone and demeanor and called Benoit for a second time. Benoit did not answer the call and the co-worker left a message stating “just call me back.”\n\n\n\n3:44pm\n\nBenoit called the co-worker back stating he didn’t answer the call because he was on the phone with Delta changing his flight. Benoit stated he had a real stressful day due to Nancy and Daniel being sick with food poisoning. They discussed travel plans for the WWE Tour of Texas with Benoit still sounding groggy at this point according to the co-worker.\n\n\n\n4:30pm\n\nA co-worker who consistently travels with Benoit, called Benoit from outside Houston airport and Benoit answered. Benoit told the co-worker that Nancy was throwing up blood and that Daniel was also throwing up. Benoit thought they had food poisoning. Benoit stated he changed his flight and he would be arriving into Houston at 6:30pm. Benoit told the co-worker to drive onto the WWE event.\n\n\n\n5:35pm\n\nBenoit called WWE Talent Relations stating that his son was throwing up and that he and Nancy were in the hospital with their son, and that Benoit would be taking a later flight into Houston, landing late, but would make the WWE live event in Beaumont.\n\n\n\n6:10pm\n\nA representative of Talent Relations called Benoit. The representative from Talent Relations asked Benoit what time Benoit was getting into Beaumont. Benoit responded he was leaving Atlanta at 9:20pm Eastern time arriving into Houston at 9:24pm Central time. The representative from Talent Relations advised Benoit that it would be too late to make the WWE live event in Beaumont. Benoit apologized citing he had a family emergency. The representative from Talent Relations suggested to Benoit that instead of going to the WWE live event in Beaumont, Benoit should take the flight to Houston, rest up and be ready for the Vengeance Pay-Per-View event.\n\n\n\n6:13pm\n\nThe representative from Talent Relations called Benoit to reconfirm the travel plans with no answer from Benoit. The representative from Talent Relations left a voice message to take the flight and rest up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday, June 24, 2007\n\n\n\nText messages sent to co-workers from Chris Benoit and Nancy Benoit’s cell phones:\n\n\n\nText Message 1\n\nSent to: Two Co-Workers (the same who had verbal correspondence with Benoit the day before)\n\nFrom: Benoit’s cell phone\n\nWhen: 6/24 at 3:53am from\n\nMessage: C, S.

I caught in on a local radio talk show.\n\n\n\nIn all reality, I'm sure that the man's family is falling to pieces.

All he deserves is a spot in Hell.\n\n\n\nI disagree, especially since I consider his actions the result of combining illegal and perscribed substances, a hectic schedule, the loss of Eddie, and a child with Fragile X syndrome under the care of parents who were fighting reguarly with known evidences of 'roid rage tantrums.\n\n\n\nThe guy went over the edge. That simple\n\n\n\nHey, let's get back to celebrating domestic wifebeaters like Austin and Flair eh? Or guys like Edge who forced one giuy out of a job for a few months for causing emotional strain whilst also cheating on his wife? Those guys are awesome, yeah, let's go back to forgiving them for their misdeeds and accepting them as main eventers and legendary performers because we've found a new guy to thrash.\n\n\n\nWhenever these judgmental pundits like it or not, Benoit WILL be revered again in the cult regard he deserves\n\nX You know I am no super christian, but I do know some of the word.\n\n\n\nI do know that if a person takes their own life they supposedly end up in Hell. In this case, I hope he enjoys his eternity in Hell, while hopefully his wife and kid got a spot in good old Heaven.\n\n\n\nAll my statements, stated above still hold true. I have more to add, but it's to jacked up for these forums.\n\n\n\nSnaggle Toothe Psycho should be his name for now on.\n\n\n\n-X-\n\nZariusTwo Nice to see the ignorant have completly avoided the facts I pointed out above in favour of reacting as typically as a mainstream pundit would, really sweet of 'em. Back to those great wifebeating legends like Austin folks, BAH GWAD, STONE COLD!\n\n\n\nBend-in-the-wind backstabbing hypocrites. The instant Angle drops like a fly, you'll all jump on him next. Wrestling fans my ass.\n\n\n\nI find it funny that religious berks have a place where those who commit sin are condemed, does \"God\" not forgive all trangressions to the next life?

No one REALLY knows what happened here at all and we may never really know the truth. A combination of things could have simply driven Benoit over the edge or maybe there was an underlaying cause? Not that I'm trying to excuse him from the horrible deed, but the man was only human and as we know full well if you are human you are prone to being swayed or driven over the edge quite easily.\n\n\n\nIt's an awful tragedy...but think about it people....what if this had happened to YOUR family? would still be feeling and making the same comments? What if this guy had been your best friend and someone you you knew for years personally? Would you still feel the same?\n\n\n\nIt was a terrible thing Benoit did. A horrible thing. To judge him only makes it worse.\n\n\n\n...and what Zarius Said about going back to celebrating the other wrestlers and their wrong doings....They may be lesser offenses (a matter of opinion i suppose) but these guys will get the same Tribute when they pass as Benoit did before they knew what was going on. I really don't feel they \"Glorified\" him any more than any other superstar who has passed on. Eddie Guerrero was Glorified....granted it was a different situation. For weeks we were flooded with images and such of Eddie, however as soon as McMahon got wind of the nature of the situation with Benoit he put a stop to it before \"Glorification\" was allowed to take place.\n\nBarkworm Please let's not make this a religious discussion.\n\nZariusTwo Please let's not make this a religious discussion.\n\n\n\nI agree, so long as the same guys with nothing better to do stop saying \"burn in hell\" over a guy and a situation they will never know the truth about.\n\n\n\nAnd yes, a lot of what I mentioned are lesser offenses, but they all had the potential to become far more dangerous.\n\nTheGreenMagic I'm going to have to agree with Zarius as well in regards to Benoit. I doubt we'll ever truly know what it was exactly that led him to doing what he did (and I'm not sure I want to know what pushed him to the brink so badly), but at this point I'm trying my hardest to separate my opinions between the Chris Benoit I watched for years in the WWE and Chris Benoit the real man. Though it'll probably be a long time before I can ever watch one of his matches without first thinking about what's happened in the past few days.\n\nVaughnMichael I'm more inclined to accept Benoit did it, even if I will never lose my respect for his professional accomplishments. He WAS professional wrestling, and I doubt any will replace him in regards to the work ethic and effort he put in to elevate and propel talents he worked with.\n\n\n\nI blame him, I blame the scheduling, I blame the steroids, I blame the domestic problems he had, I blame the emotional turmoil of events such as Eddie's death, and I blame Vince not grasping his buisness needs to take rest periods, or at best, a social system so that talents can have someone to talk to regarding issues such as long time seperation from family and losses of freinds.\n\n\n\nBenoit was professional wrestling, he was it's ups, and it's downs, it's greatest victories, and it's greatest tragedies. He was it's art and innocense, and he was it's stigma. Benoit's story, one of glory and commendability, will now sadly be regarded by the ignorant as a cruelly ignored and resented career.\n\nOr sadly made into a tv movie of the week.:ohwell:\n\nAnarky You know, once more I'm kind of shocked how the media butchers this. I mean, crap like this happens everyday. And from a journalist point of view, I can understand why it's being butchered, but I still think it's kind of wrong. I mean, I had trouble with this while working for the newspaper, always argued with the boss about it, felt really bad when I had to do it, but it's sort of got to be done. I still don't see why it can be left at \"Benoit and family dead, motive and killer unknown\" for now until the coppers have their investigations done. Every detail must be brought to public attention, everyone has his or her theory and it's quite sickening, really.\n\n\n\nAlso, those horrible tributes on telly and everywhere bother me. I mean, let the dead be dead, moment of silence on the next wrestling event perhaps, but not endless specials and talkshows about it. But I guess I'm pretty alone with that point of view.\n\nThe Stryker The first tribute was done before WWE had all the facts, it was all pre-taped and was a case of bad timing.\n\n\n\nI'm just really saddened by all of this, Empty feeling, confused...I can't really say.\n\nDuke I disagree, especially since I consider his actions the result of combining illegal and perscribed substances, a hectic schedule, the loss of Eddie, and a child with Fragile X syndrome under the care of parents who were fighting reguarly with known evidences of 'roid rage tantrums.The key word in that is his actions. He made the choice to take illegal substances (I'm not saying he did, just repeating what you said). He made the choice to work a hectic schedule by not leaving the industry. I'm sorry but if it caused him that much psychological stress than its time for him to find a new job. Plenty of wrestlers work hectic schedules but don't go crazy. And yes unfortunately he lost a close friend and had a son with a disease, but he still allowed those things to affect. I know people that's been through much worse and choose to receive professional help because it began overwhelming and he could have made the same choice. And finally he choose to kill his wife and son.\n\n\n\nCircumstances don't define someone, their actions in those circumstances do.\n\nKROW The key word in that is his actions.

Like Zarius said, it was the work schedule. Vince works the guys hard to keep his business in the position it's in, probably out of fear of losing ratings and, in turn, money.\n\n\n\nShawn Michaels took five years off for this purpose. Five years. How many of us can say that we can leave a job that pays so well for that long and still have it when we get back? Benoit probably didn't have that guarantee. More often than not, the only time off these guys get is when they get injured. Isn't that nice? The only time you can relax at your job is if your in pain. Couple that with problems at home -- marital and custody problems, at that -- and your world might seem to crumble around you.\n\n\n\nIt's all a somewhat confusing situation, but I will agree that he made a choice to do what he did.\n\nRaph's Girl New Info has come in:\n\n\n\nDaniel Benoit was apperantly killed by a choke hold in his bed. He was found laying face down on his stomach. There were also needle marks on his arms (he was being injected with growth hormones cuz he was so short. They think he was a dwarf).\n\nX Nothing good can come of religious statements due to the fact everyone believes something different.\n\n\n\nTo those who say we don't know the whole story, well we know one thing. Benoit did kill two innocent people. One being 7 years old.\n\n\n\nI don't care if drugs were involved, it's his fault for doing them, I don't care if stress is involved, it's his fault for not finding a way to deal with it.\n\n\n\nI learned alot in the 28 years of my life. I used to punch walls, I had a super bad temper that if anyone messed with me I would knock the living poo out of them, I used to love fighting with everyone until I got my way, but I stopped it myself and no one had to tell me. That means I was capable of displaying willpower to change myself. It reminds me of how people can say they are alchoholics when scientists proved there is no such thing as an alchoholic gene that makes people addicted. It's all an excuse for them to feel like they need help, when they can help themselves.\n\n\n\nI for one, no longer do things I know will stress me out, or cause me to take any actions out on others. It's that simple. When I get angry at my son for being bad, I have a choice. Do I scream at him, spank him, and send him to his room? Or do I calmly tell him to get in the corner for five minutes to teach him a lesson? If I had a job that stressed me out enough to go home and take it out on innocent people, I would simply quit, and find something more along my lines. Family over anything else in my books.\n\n\n\nIf people want to place a blame on anything, it's all the parents, no matter what way you slice it. There are no excuses when it comes to drugs, roids, and whatnot, in which case, it's still the parents. I don't treat the human race like idiots who cannot fathom what it means to make their own decisions. He had choices, and he obviously chose hateful tactics, over good. If my kid grows up, and does something stupid like shoots up a school because of games (lame excuse,) then it was my bad for not teaching him games are nothing more then computer chips. If he cusses, it was my fault for placing him around people who cuss all the time (which I don't.)\n\n\n\n-X-\n\nZariusTwo Your personal life does not apply here.\n\n\n\nHis son had Fragile X Syndrome, that is expensive to properly supervise and treat, and the condition made Daniel sociably difficult to raise in a family environment.\n\n\n\nYou are not a professional wrestler. You are not a professional sports-entertainer who has to endure expectations of what size to fit and what mold to break, you are not a professional worker who has to be seperated, indefinatly from freinds and family whose welfare depends the highest affordable accomedation to treat in certain cases.\n\n\n\nIf you don't care drugs were involved, then that explains your typical mainstream ignorance right there, because drugs DO control the way people act when they underestimate thier effects and take the kind that damages you all of the time. Because of someone's actions, they immediatly say \"your fault\" for the choice, choice is'nt a factor when you're not thinking rationaly, you brood on the most ludicrous aspects of your conscious mind, the stuff you DON'T do when faced with an overwhelming problem. You have no control over changing that part of your mind, and therefore can't control your own actions.\n\nTMNT I don't know if it's been posted but here's a message by Vince that aired on ECW last night.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.wwe.com/inside/news/chairmanbenoit\n\n\n\nHe pretty much states that the whole tribute thing was wrong. I don't see it as wrong. I mean, yes the actions of Beniot are horrible but there's nothing wrong with the people who shared personal moments with the guy in his career to share their thoughts. He was a wrestler and he did his job well. For them to completely disown Benoit like that--he mentions \"no mention\" of Benoit and we're here to simply entertain. It seems they took the fast route to the healing process.\n\nZariusTwo I agree with Vince, but he did'nt apologise for the tribute entirely either, he did'nt even say he was sorry, he simply stated that things had become \"very appararent\" and that the show would be dedicated by all those affected, and that they would move on quicker, which is the ideal thing to do.\n\n\n\nDuring the match between Punk and Elijah Burke, they ended with an EXACT homage to a Benoit vs Malenko match, hence giving him a subtle nod. Vince can't afford to keep his company connected to a confirmed murderer, but he obviously would like to under different circumstances. Vince is a guy who makes freinds with his talent, and if you betray him on a level like this that can humiliate and blacklist your company in a very hostile media, it hurts him.\n\nKROW More developments on the case:\n\n\n\nWWE.com learned from an interview conducted Tuesday by Vancouver’s News1130 that Chris Benoit’s son Daniel possibly suffered from Fragile X Syndrome, a genetically passed-on condition that results in impairments ranging from physical and learning disabilities, to more severe cognitive or intellectual disabilities.\n\n\n\nIn the interview with News1130, Pam Winthrope, whose own 12-year-old son suffers from Fragile X Syndrome, recounted how she and her husband talked to Benoit about the condition five years ago.\n\n\n\n“We talked to him because I was trying to set up a support group in B.C. and in Canada; we only have a couple of them,” she said. “My husband was struggling when we got diagnosed with our son, and Chris was struggling with his. They talked for a few minutes, and then he said he didn’t want to be a public face for Fragile X. He just wanted to keep it really, really quiet.”\n\n\n\nA source close to Benoit recalls similar conversations with him, where he described his son’s condition as “a learning disability much like autism.” This source quotes Benoit as saying “Daniel wasn’t capable of interacting with other children and was afraid of other children. Daniel also had a hard time making eye contact with everyone, which was another symptom of his disability.” Benoit also claimed that his son was on medication for this condition.\n\n\n\nWinthrope discussed the pressures facing parents of children diagnosed with Fragile X syndrome. During her interview with News1130, she stated that families can be torn apart by the disease because it's very difficult to find help and support. Winthrope added, \"You as a parent have to go out there and find what's available and it's not easy -- they don't tell you.\"\n\n\n\nA co-worker and long-time friend of the Benoits speculates that perhaps the pressures of home and Daniel’s illness had gotten to him, causing him to snap and take the lives of his wife and son before taking his own.\n\n\n\n“Is it possible that after Chris killed Nancy (for whatever reason), he felt Daniel wouldn't be able to get the care and attention he required as a special needs child (if that is indeed true) with no mother and a father either in jail or dead? Did he then decide that the only way he could protect and take care of his son was to take him to the next world and go with him? In his warped and twisted state, did he think this was the only way to shield his son from a difficult life of pain and hardship? It doesn't condone or justify a damn thing, but it's the best reason I can think of. I'm trying to put together some semblance of logic for his actions, but it's an impossible task trying to explain this.”\n\n\n\nIt is also apparent that the person who was receiving the text messages was Chavo Guerrero. Additionally, it turns out that Benoit was being investigated for steroids, since the mail-order \"RX\" company he was ordering them from wasn't legitimate. Police arrested the two ring leaders as well as 60 people who were working for them. Whether Benoit knew the company was dirty or not will most likely never be known.\n\nX Zarius... Bro... Think what you will of me, but until you have kids, you don't have any idea what kinds of feelings stem from being a parent. You just have no idea as of yet.\n\n\n\nWhen I mentioned drugs, I mentioned the fact that if Benoit was on drugs when he killed them, it was his fault for doing drugs when he could easily walk away. If drugs were so much of a thing in his life, I'm sure it wasn't that well hidden in the midst of a full-time career, and his times at home. Again as I've said it's all about the parents, it's more our faults then anything. I am a parent, but not one of these dipsticks who will lack admitance to how a kid grows up and acts...\n\n\n\nNow to another new development I heard, which further makes me mad, is the fact his kid is labled by the press as mentally retarded (from a news story I just saw.) So what does daddy do? He frickin choke holds (or smuthered no one can seem to make up their mind about how the kid died,) a mentally disabled kid.\n\n\n\nVince was right in feeling wrong, however, had I been him, I would've waited until further facts before hosting a tribute show.\n\n\n\n-Benoit was wrong for doing drugs in the first place. Fact.\n\n\n\n-Benoit was wrong for taking his stressful situations (his work,) out on others, instead of quitting like his wife requested. Fact\n\n\n\n-Benoit should've never had kids, if he knew he wasn't capable of handling the duties a father should.\n\n\n\nAs a father of two (Son is 5, Daughter is 1,) I see stress daily. Enough that my 28 year old head of hair could easily turn white. However, it doesn't give me the right to take human lives (let alone my kids,) because I wanna be a sissy whine bag, who can't seek professional help. That power wasn't bestowed upon me, like all these idiot killers in the world think. When it all boils down to it, we were meant to get along with each other, not slaughter each other like savages.\n\n\n\nIt boils down to overload. Everyone in this world has a foolish pride at times, and I dare someone to come here and say they never let pride get the best of them. Benoit probably looked at his muscles and thought he was superman, and forgot about that beating heart inside of him. I've always told people I know that if they offered me anyone I know who has died that I cared for in exchange for a toe, I would happily lop it off in front of them and hand it to them with a smile on my face. Physical pain comes and goes, mental pain is forever.\n\n\n\n-X-\n\njeff the cheff Your personal life does not apply here.\n\n\n\nHis son had Fragile X Syndrome, that is expensive to properly supervise and treat, and the condition made Daniel sociably difficult to raise in a family environment.\n\n\n\nYou are not a professional wrestler. You are not a professional sports-entertainer who has to endure expectations of what size to fit and what mold to break, you are not a professional worker who has to be seperated, indefinatly from freinds and family whose welfare depends the highest affordable accomedation to treat in certain cases.\n\n\n\nIf you don't care drugs were involved, then that explains your typical mainstream ignorance right there, because drugs DO control the way people act when they underestimate thier effects and take the kind that damages you all of the time.

You have no control over changing that part of your mind, and therefore can't control your own actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nI disagree with what your saying. Sure nobody here knows what it's like to be in his shoes. No matter how much stress he is under, there isn't any excuse. I don't know what it's like to be in that situation, or to have my mind altered by drugs, but there is still no excuse for killing someone. If someone gets stressed from work, drinks a lot of alcohol, and beats their kids up, you don't say \"well it's hard to understand what he was going through\", thats just someone doing something evil.\n\n\n\nI'm trying to think of an analogy here...what if someone gets drunk and drives and kills a family member of yours....I don't think you would forgive them because they were under the influence and weren't able to make good choices, at least I wouldn't\n\nStorm Wolf When I mentioned drugs, I mentioned the fact that if Benoit was on drugs when he killed them, it was his fault for doing drugs when he could easily walk away.\n\n\n\n-X-\n\n\n\nI understand your main point, but you don't know to much about drugs and addictions do you? Drug abuse isn't just a \"bad habit\" ...it's a sickness...just like any sickness it's hard to, if not impossible to cure. It's not something that, once you've used it, you can just say \"Hey this is screwing things up worse, so I'm not going to do it anymore.\" Then walk away and just don't do it anymore. Drugs dilute your mind and ravage your thinking processes. It leaves you blind to the hurt you cause others emotionally, mentally and physically. Any abuser can tell you, no matter how long they've been \"clean\" that drugs are always in the back of their mind and re-lapse can happen easily and quickly. No, what Benoit did wasn't right in any form or fashion, but I think you made his addiction a little easier to escape than it really was, if in fact that's what it was.\n\n\n\nPlus, we aren't really certain about type of drugs he was on...what did he need them for and such. I think there are just to many uncertainties to jump to so many rash conclusions.\n\nX Actually Storm I do. I too was a teenager once, who thought smoking weed was cool. Funny thing is, after the first time, I looked at the smoked joint and said, \"was that really worth it?\" I kept asking myself questions and thinking, \"well I'm not really being me am I.\" So you know what, I never touched one again. I think I mentioned this same line before on these forums, when one time I said that females actually thought of me more when I was myself, and not what everyone else is. While life is not all about females and trying to impress them, it really showed how impressed they were with me. My guy friends could care less, so that's why I mainly mention them when saying that small story.\n\n\n\nThen of course there's always the case, well I got into drugs and smoking cigarettes because I was always stressed out, and coming home from a hard days work, and blah blah. My answers to those, were to always keep telling myself, \"well David (my name,) you've been having a bad day, just find a way to deal with it. Make sure when you get home, not to take any frustrations out on others in ANYWAY.\" Cigarettes really never tickled my fancy to try to begin with, as my sig says it all. I love life, no matter how bad it can be, what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger, and I refuse to pay to kill myself when I could be giving it to some homeless man on the street who can buy a burger, or I'll buy one for him. Alchohol is a big joke. I drink on occasion (when I hit the clubs, in which I never drive home, even though I never get drunk, just a little buzz.) Scientists actually proved their is no such thing as an alchoholic gene to feed any sort of addiction. People who say they are addicted, made themselves, not some hormone.\n\n\n\nI could go on I suppose, but it all boils down to simple things.\n\n\n\n- Everyone chooses their path in life, and make their own decisions. This means Benoit could've chosen other means, if his life was in the gutter, however he kept pushing himself too hard.\n\n\n\n- Benoit didn't have to do drugs, pending he was on drugs when it happened. He could've sought out help from professionals.\n\n\n\n- Benoit could've changed his profession. I'm sorry but the man isn't broke. I have been watching him since WCW days as one of the four horsemen (I started watching WCW in 96.) He could've easily retired on the money he had, but brought about his own pains due to love of the sport, and hurt other people in the process without giving a care what his wife thought about him wrestling. That's plain selfish, specially when you are part of a two person team, and have a kid to think about.\n\n\n\nLook, I am a screenwriter, my feet are very much wet in tinseltown in some fashion. Once I get to the directors chair and have to leave to go on shoots, I will do two things. I will offer my family the chance to see the world with me, and learn it's various cultures. Have fun and whatnot too. :D\n\n\n\nHowever, if they were not to go, but my wife at the time were to say I need to be more about family, well, she wouldn't even need to ask. In my life family comes before profession, even though profession brings the bank home. I will simply have to find other means to accomodate while making others happy in the process... Benoit could've done the same thing, but he's a man, and coming from a man, our pride sometimes gets the best of us, instead of just showing our true feelings.\n\n\n\n-X-\n\nBarkworm Are some people here really trying to play down the fact that this guy killed his family??? I mean, I can understand how you feel after your idol turned out to be a complete nut-case but it's f*cking murder we're talking about here. Not manslaughter, MURDER. There is no excuse.\n\nKROW Are some people here really trying to play down the fact that this guy killed his family??? I mean, I can understand how you feel after your idol turned out to be a complete nut-case but it's f*cking murder we're talking about here. Not manslaughter, MURDER. There is no excuse.\n\n\n\nHis actions were deplorable, but I think some of us are trying to uphold a sense of decency by looking at and analyzing the facts while others are spouting things like, \"He's a sick nut-job,\" \"I hope he burns in Hell,\" \"He could've done this or that instead,\" and so on. Just disregarding the details and seeing it as, \"He killed his family, so he ain't worth a damn in any respect\" and in the same vein judging him is one-sided when there are still many facets to consider in this tragedy -- facets that might never be known.\n\n\n\nWe know what happened and we stated flat-out that this is a horrible thing. Now we're discussing the possible reasons why while there are still people who refuse to see the other side of the story. It's not defending his actions nor down-playing the incident nor is it trying to find an excuse, it's looking for a measure of understanding that the ignorant here just won't even try to comprehend.\n\nX Yea but Krow, the thing in life now is, someone can always find a way to blame anything for peoples actions.\n\n\n\nIt's like what Chris Rock says in his standup \"Bigger and Blacker.\" \"What ever happened to just being crazy?\"\n\n\n\nBack before attorneys could tell all the kids, \"blame Grand Theft Auto for your actions, they'll lessen the sentence, and cry plea of insanity,\" there was just being loony.\n\n\n\nNow people can always blame drugs, for the reason why someone acted, when in truth, the very first time Benoit picked up a drug, he had the options -\n\n\n\nA. Using it.\n\n\n\nB. Not using it.\n\n\n\nSo if drugs were involved and he became a druggy then that was his own fault for spitting in everyones face just to feel good by being drugged up.\n\n\n\nHere let's say this. Why in the hell would you want to be a professional wrestler if somewhere in there Steroids had to be involved? Is a job or career worth all of that, and totally forgetting any potential side effects of the substance? He had a choice yet again, but cared obviously more about himself, then anyone else.\n\n\n\nIf this is related to regular drugs, then again, he is selfish for thinking about himself over family and getting involved and picking up that first drug when he could've sought help. Like I've said, I have had issues in life, some bad, some not so bad, but I have never resorted to other methods to take my mind off any stressful situation.\n\n\n\nPoint blank though bro, is now adays everyones blaming anything they can, instead of blaming the person for acting foolish in any regard to dangerous subtance abuse or cookyness.\n\n\n\n-X-\n\nZariusTwo Like I've said, I have had issues in life, some bad, some not so bad, but I have never resorted to other methods to take my mind off any stressful situation.\n\n\n\nHey, Bathalemew, write this on the chalkboard so the sane members of the class can force feed it to you in the playground\n\n\n\nYOU ARE NOT A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER\n\n\n\n\n\nYOU ARE NOT A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER\n\n\n\n\n\nYOU ARE NOT A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat that in your head 9000 times and then maybe, god maybe, you'll realize you are in NO posistion to sit on some high horse saying what you did in YOUR life and what YOU did. Wrestlers are the biggest addicts in the world, and it's out of neccessity to feed and sustain their families on a large-scale basis. Benoit made the choice to take them to sustain that welfare, even if it has now obviously backfired thanks to their influencing his stress and troubled mind. Noone thinks clearly when there in that condition, you did'nt because obviously your so-called \"experiance\" was'nt as bad as this, and therefore you have nothing to say about this discussion\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint blank though bro, is now adays everyones blaming anything they can, instead of blaming the person for acting foolish in any regard to dangerous subtance abuse or cookyness.\n\n\n\n-X-\n\n\n\nPoint blank, Krow and I know this buisness better than you, and until you experiance what Benoit did, or people I personally know experiance, you've got nothing pal, give it up.\n\n\n\nNoone is absolving Benoit of any crime he commited, but he was not thinking rationally, and whilst you'd love to beleive human action is all up to the individual, in the hands of disturbed, fragile, and addicted humans trying to do the right thing for their loved ones, human action is up to what is'nt helping their state of body and mind.\n\nKROW Yea but Krow, the thing in life now is, someone can always find a way to blame anything for peoples actions.\n\n\n\nIt's like what Chris Rock says in his standup \"Bigger and Blacker.\" \"What ever happened to just being crazy?\"\n\n\n\nBack before attorneys could tell all the kids, \"blame Grand Theft Auto for your actions, they'll lessen the sentence, and cry plea of insanity,\" there was just being loony.\n\n\n\nNow people can always blame drugs, for the reason why someone acted, when in truth, the very first time Benoit picked up a drug, he had the options -\n\n\n\nA.

Yikes.\n\n\n\nYou need to understand one thing: Maybe he didn't have a choice. Maybe he had to take steroids. Steroids aren't just a drug people take to enhance muscle mass. They're used as a stimulant. People with COPD use them and they are just as capable of doing horrendous actions as the next person, as are we all. The thing is, the company he was buying them from was shady. This could mean that he wasn't getting the proper steroids, they were tainted in some way, they were too strong, or maybe not strong enough. See, we don't know because the toxicology reports haven't been released. Hell, we don't even know if they're done yet. You're jumping to conclusions about his drug-use when the facts are still being formulated.\n\n\n\nAlso, there are tons of wrestlers that don't use steroids at all. It's not a prerequisite for the business. It's not even a matter of possibility to have to take them. For all we know, Benoit probably didn't want to take them, maybe was horrified to learn that he had to. Remember, when he was tested in April of this year, he was clean. Maybe something happened where he needed them rather than want them. It's an unknown and it's not right to assume that he took them for personal reasons.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, although seeking professional help about stress in his life would have been a good idea, where exactly would Benoit find the time to juggle family, work, and therapy with a work schedule like his? Wrestlers are away from home 300 days out of the year. Is 65 days, spent sporadically, enough to alleviate any burdens in your life? No, they're not.\n\n\n\nNow let's just say he wanted to go to therapy. Commendable, yes? Well, guess what? He would have to take time off work for it. He'd HAVE to. And again, like I said before, what's the guarantee that his job would be there when he got back and what if he didn't have that luxury? Did his contract allow that? Was there a clause in there for that type of situation? Again, we don't know.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of things to consider and my argument is that most of the people in this thread aren't considering it.\n\n\n\nAlso, I would like to say that maybe Benoit punished himself in the end. The way he died seemed far more horrible than the way his family did. Perhaps he judged himself for his actions, so maybe it'd be best if we stop judging him.\n\njeff the cheff YOU ARE NOT A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour saying that he can't judge someone because he doesn't know what it's like to be in the \"business\" that you know so much about because you watch it on TV. X can call someone a sicko for killing his family regardless of what the circumstances are. I think thats his point, no matter what drugs he was on, stress he was under, or family trouble he had, you really can simplify all this and just call him an asshole pshycho murderer!\n\n\n\nOh I'm sorry, I have no idea what it's like to be a wrestler, so I have no place in judging him....and I can't judge scott peterson because I don't know what it's like to sell fertilizer for a living.\n\nSewer Bull Now let's just say he wanted to go to therapy.

Was there a clause in there for that type of situation? Again, we don't know.\n\n\n\nHow about retiring from wrestling then, after the potential therapy - and giving a chance to another job that would cause less damage to his life and mind?\n\n\n\nYou're saying as if he couldn't do anything but wrestle in his life.\n\nNightwatcher You keep assuming that Benoit wouldn't have a job when he got back if he took time off. Wasn't he one of the more popular wrestlers at the time? Even if the WWE wouldn't rehire him (unlikely) he definately could have found a job at TNA or another wrestling brand. Maybe even one that didn't travel around the U.S. every week.\n\nKROW Your saying that he can't judge someone because he doesn't know what it's like to be in the \"business\" that you know so much about because you watch it on TV.

He allegedly killed his wife over money which is way more materialistic. Benoit allegedly killed over a more mental and emotional reason. The two cases are different, regardless that they're both under the category of double-murder.\n\n\n\nAnother factor that makes them different is that Chris Benoit gave to the community. He entertained. He was a television celebrity, of sorts. The impact of these tragic events is overwhelming, just as it might be if a big Hollywood movie star would do the same. Scott Peterson was just like you or me, the Average Joe. His actions impacted the town in which he lived and then the nation when the media got wind of it. Benoit's case shocked the world.\n\n\n\nAnd how do you know that Zarius (or I, for that matter) only know about the wrestling business because we watch it on TV exclusively? Maybe he goes backstage, meets them in person, does interviews, knows some of them personally. Maybe I do. You don't know. No, it's okay to jump to conclusions and assume things about people, right? Just throw caution to the wind and bark at the moon.\n\n\n\nHow about retiring from wrestling then, after the potential therapy - and giving a chance to another job that would cause less damage to his life and mind?\n\n\n\nYou're saying as if he couldn't do anything but wrestle in his life.\n\nAnd what job, pray tell, would be able to pay him enough to care for his son who was suffering from Fragile X? He and his wife kept arguing over how to take care of him. She wanted him home more, but he said if he did he would get paid less.\n\nYou keep assuming that Benoit wouldn't have a job when he got back if he took time off.

You think he's going to jump there with less pay and more hard work? And going to any other wrestling promotion would be frivolous. Also, I wasn't assuming a damn thing. I said MAYBE he didn't have that guarantee, MAYBE his contract wouldn't allow it.\n\nNightwatcher Did he actually \"give to the community\" or are you considering the fact that he wrestled on TV a community service?\n\nKROW Did he actually \"give to the community\" or are you considering the fact that he wrestled on TV a community service?\n\n\n\nOh my God... He performed in front of a paying audience while getting his body battered and broken up for the sake of their amusement and entertainment. He did that around the world. I'd say that's giving to the community.\n\nMr. Snackpants His actions were deplorable, but I think some of us are trying to uphold a sense of decency by looking at and analyzing the facts while others are spouting things like, \"He's a sick nut-job,\" \"I hope he burns in Hell,\" \"He could've done this or that instead,\" and so on. Just disregarding the details and seeing it as, \"He killed his family, so he ain't worth a damn in any respect\" and in the same vein judging him is one-sided when there are still many facets to consider in this tragedy -- facets that might never be known.\n\n\n\nWe know what happened and we stated flat-out that this is a horrible thing. Now we're discussing the possible reasons why while there are still people who refuse to see the other side of the story. It's not defending his actions nor down-playing the incident nor is it trying to find an excuse, it's looking for a measure of understanding that the ignorant here just won't even try to comprehend.\n\n\n\nSo you seriously think he shouldn't be called sick? Or that he wasn't a nut-job?\n\n\n\nWhat facts aren't we taking into consideration? He killed his family. Nothing justifies that, ever. Unless he wasn't in control of himself due to drugs or whatever, you can't defend him or tell people to look at it objectively. Even if it was due to drugs, it's his fault for taking them. If his job was causing him so much problems he should've took time off. Im sure he would be welcomed back and even if he for some reason he wasn't, I'm sure he's financially set. There are no facts that could come out to justify what Benoit did. Unless they discover he didn't do it...he was one sick individual.\n\nNightwatcher Assuming he went to wrestle for the troops, I would consider that giving to the community. I don't know what other charities the WWE does but if he did stuff for that it could be considered community service as well.\n\n\n\nI would not consider wrestling itself a community service.\n\nKROW So you seriously think he shouldn't be called sick?

Maybe he wasn't financially well-off. His house was valued at $900,000, he made about $500,000 a year (much less than your average baseball, football, or basketball player), and the treatments needed to take care of his son cost who knows how much. Also, I'm not justifying nor defending him. I'm trying to garner an understanding here.\n\n\n\nAssuming he went to wrestle for the troops, I would consider that giving to the community. I don't know what other charities the WWE does but if he did stuff for that it could be considered community service as well.\n\n\n\nI would not consider wrestling itself a community service.\n\nThe WWE gives to thousands of charities and visits several benefits around the world. Benoit attended many of them, especially when he was the World Champion, which is like acting as the figurehead of the company.\n\nSewer Bull And what job, pray tell, would be able to pay him enough to care for his son who was suffering from Fragile X? He and his wife kept arguing over how to take care of him. She wanted him home more, but he said if he did he would get paid less.\n\n\n\nI don't know what else he could have done in life - it could have always been something related to wrestling maybe. But I really know nothing about him and his talents, so don't require any enlightened answer from me.\n\n\n\nYet I know there are families with Fragile X kids, possibly way poorer than the Benoits (with jobs less paid than a WWE entertainer), who still manage to live on somehow, without slaughtering each other in the powerless rage.\n\nAnarky And again, you're talking in unknowns.\n\nEveryone in here is talking in unknowns, including the people using yellow font. Just count the Couldas, Wouldas and Shouldas in your posts.\n\n\n\nThe reason why I'm interjecting here is that I don't want to see this thread locked because some hacks decide to slit each others virtual throats in a thread about something that has enough death in it already. If you really want to have a go at it, please use The Official Technodrome Fighting League! (http://forums.thetechnodrome.com/private.php?do=newpm) - Where you can smite your Enemies with all your might!\n\nX That's why I don't use personal attacks, outside of telling Zarius what is like having kids, Anarky. Internet fighting isn't my cup of tea, and everyone is entitled to an opinion.\n\n\n\nKrow you stated -\n\n\n\n\"Furthermore, although seeking professional help about stress in his life would have been a good idea, where exactly would Benoit find the time to juggle family, work, and therapy with a work schedule like his? Wrestlers are away from home 300 days out of the year. Is 65 days, spent sporadically, enough to alleviate any burdens in your life? No, they're not.\"\n\n\n\n- Where would Benoit find the time to juggle family = Retire on the money you've made for over a decade.\n\n\n\n- Work = Find a new career if things are getting too heated. It's not like he's abnormal and cannot get any regular job like you and I.\n\n\n\n- Therapy = eliminate both of the above, and make time. Family and health comes first, or it's common sense your body is going to take an emotional pounding, and the human heart can only take so much before it gives up. Be it in psycho fashion, or dying from stress overload. Can you believe I actually knew someone who died from the latter? Stress?\n\n\n\nSure I may not be a professional wrestler, but I was born with common sense, as was everyone else here, and everyone in the world. My common sense tells me, that if he were made to take Steroids, why would he use that extra muscle to find a career in wrestling? Oh maybe he just got into wrestling first, then found his supplier. If he had any condition before he started wrestling where a doctor prescribed Steroids to him, I doubt the WWE would just welcome him with open arms, and a ailment that needs medicine, that can alter a persons perception.\n\n\n\nA good example if I may. I went to the doctor because to this day I have nose obstruction, which over the years it's getting harder and harder to breathe out of my nose, and I'm losing my sense of smell and taste, even as we speak. I've been to the doctor twice now (ENT or Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist.) He said the only way to get rid of the obstruction is to kill the Temperal Arteritis which requires a Steroid. However, twice now I was denied a Steroid to kill it. Why? Because I had high blood pressure going in there both times, and he said giving me it, will give me a stroke asap. He says I should lose a lot of the STRESS in my life.\n\n\n\nSo let's say Benoit was stressed out, which we all know he was, what with all the balancing. Him taking a Steroid would only give him a stroke, as stress will raise anyones blood pressure, which a steroid does as well, and is far more potent, then high blood pressure from stress, as a doctor stated to me.\n\n\n\nSo with that I assume he wasn't on roids when this happened, because he would've had to have been very mellowed out, to stay on it and keep from having a stroke. Someone who is in the middle of killing people are hardly calm I'd think. It's like any time I've been in fights, my heart races 100 MPH, and my adreniline is pumping, imagine what happens when you're going the next mile.\n\n\n\n-X-\n\nKROW Everyone in here is talking in unknowns, including the people using yellow font. Just count the Couldas, Wouldas and Shouldas in your posts.\n\nNo sh*t. I'm not the one assuming things. Maybe you should read my posts instead of count the words.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are Rob Van Dam's comments from his MySpace page. Keep in mind that he's into all that yoga and meditation stuff:\n\n\n\nWell, there's no need to wait until we have our heads wrapped around this, because I doubt that'll happen, so here it is. I know that a monster committed those terrible, unforgivable acts of horror. Just like everyone who knew Chris Benoit, I can't think of him as a monster. Not Chris.\n\nChris was truly a role model's role model. You simply had to respect him and admire his focus and unmatched discipline. If I ever got asked a question about who I looked up to the most in the business, you guessed it. That's me sharing a real feeling with you. Not talking about bull **** that I have little interest in, like who would I like most to wrestle with, or what's my favorite color, but who I actually looked up to in the dressing room. It's Chris Benoit- in the ring and in the dressing room and with his family.\n\nThe last time I talked to Chris, a few weeks ago, he told me how much he respected me for stepping away from the business.
