    "text": "I remember i was in my room watching Raw, for some reason that i can't remember i hadn't been on the internet all day, i was super-excited to find out where exactly they would go with the whole \"Vince is dead\" angle, it was supposed to be a tribute to his life or something, and then i saw Vince Mcmahon stood there, teary-eyed and i only tuned in just in time to see him say \"Tonight's show will be dedicated to Chris Benoit\" and i was just confused, then as the montage for him was playing i started realizing what was going on, then i saw \"RIP Chris Benoit\" come up before it cutted to the adverts and i was stunned and distraught, then seeing that Daniel & Nancy passed as well made it even more surreal, my first thought was that it was a car-crash or something. Then the next day i went on WWE.com and the news of how it happened became clear.\n\n\n\nSuch a creepy feel around it all, so much stuff to take in so quickly. First to find out he's dead, then to find out his family is dead, then to find out he was responsible for it is shocking. What could possibly drive an apparently normal man to do that is something we'll unfortunately never know and i find that pretty terrifying to be honest"
