        "text": "Christopher Michael Benoit (May 21, 1967 – June 24, 2007) was a Canadian professional wrestler. He worked for several major promotions, including Stampede Wrestling, Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and held a total of thirty-two championships during his professional wrestling career. Benoit is recognized by WWE as a record-tying five-time WCW/WWE United States Champion, having held the championship twice in WCW, and three times in WWE; and a two-time world champion: a one-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion and one-time World Heavyweight Champion, with both reigns represented by the Big Gold Belt. Benoit is one of four men to have held the Big Gold Belt in both WCW and WWE, alongside Goldberg, Booker T and The Big Show.\n\nIn addition to championships, Benoit also won the 2004 Royal Rumble, joining Shawn Michaels as one of two men to win the match as the number one entrant. Described by WWE as \"a favorite among WWE fans for his unbelievable athleticism and wrestling ability\", Benoit was widely regarded as one of the most popular, respected and gifted technical wrestlers in WWE history.\n\nOn June 24, 2007, Benoit was found dead along with his wife, Nancy and son, Daniel. It was concluded that Benoit had murdered his wife and son and subsequently committed suicide. Since the tragedy, numerous explanations for Benoit's actions have been proposed, including brain injuries, steroid abuse and a failing marriage among others. Benoit last performed for WWE on their ECW brand. Paul Heyman, head of the original ECW promotion, intended to book Benoit to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship in 1995 but did not renew his United States Work Visa in time; twelve years later, Benoit was booked by WWE to win the title in one of three world championship matches at pay-per-view event Vengeance: Night of Champions, which again did not come to fruition due to his death that night.\n\nIn wrestling[]\n\nFinisher moves\n\nBridging Dragon Suplex – 1992–1998; used as a regular move from 1998–2006\n\nCrippler Crossface (Arm-trap Crossface) -2007\n\nDiving Headbutt\n\nWild Bomb (High speed release powerbomb, sometimes from the top rope) – 1994–2002\n\nSharpshooter\n\nSignature moves\n\nKnife Edge Chop\n\nPendulum Backbreaker\n\nShoulderbreaker – 2000–2003\n\nDragon Screw\n\nTorture Crab (Boston Crab with a knee to the back) – 1993–1999\n\nEnziguri\n\nForearm smash\n\nRunning lariat\n\nSpinebuster – 1991–1994\n\nSpringboard Clothesline – 1994–1998\n\nSuicide Dive\n\nTombstone Piledriver (sometimes from the top rope) - 1991-1999\n\nCloverleaf leg laced Boston crab\n\nDiving Legdrop – 1990–1994\n\nFrankensteiner, (sometimes from the top rope)\n\nInverted STF\n\nMilitary Press Slam – 1990–1992\n\nTilt–a–Whirl Backbreaker\n\nMultiple Suplex variations:\n\nBelly to back (sometimes from the top rope)\n\nBridging Dragon\n\nGerman (usually done multiple times with a bridge or from the top rope)\n\nBridging Northern Lights\n\nGutwrench (sometimes from the top rope)\n\nInverted\n\nSlingshot\n\nSnap (sometimes done multiple times)\n\nSuperplex\n\nThree Amigos (Triple Rolling Verticals) – Used as a tribute to Eddie Guerrero\n\nNicknames\n\n\"The Rabid Wolverine\"\n\n\"The Crippler\"\n\n\"The Canadian Crippler\"\n\n\"Toothless Aggression\"\n\nTag teams and stables\n\nChris Benoit & Chris Jericho\n\nChris Benoit & Dean Malenko\n\nChris Benoit & Kurt Angle\n\nFour Horsemen\n\nThe Radicalz\n\nThe Revolution\n\nTriple Threat\n\nManagers And Valets\n\nArn Anderson\n\nShane Douglas\n\nShane McMahon\n\nWoman\n\nTed DiBiase (During his WWF tryout matches in 1995)\n\nMiss Elizabeth\n\nWrestlers trained\n\nAshe\n\nSkye\n\nTheme music\n\n\"Jump\" by Van Halen (Japan)\n\n\"Woman from Tokyo\" by Deep Purple (Japan)\n\n\"Back in the Saddle\" by Aerosmith (ECW)\n\n\"Perfect Strangers\" by Deep Purple (ECW) (He used this theme after joining the Triple Threat since it was Shane Douglas' theme.
