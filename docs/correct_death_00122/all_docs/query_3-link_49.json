        "text": "Authorities say pro wrestler Chris Benoit, his wife and seven-year-old son were found slain on Monday at their Fayetteville home.\n\nDetective Bo Turner told Atlanta television station WAGA that the case is being investigated as a murder-suicide, but said that cannot be determined until the evidence is examined by a crime lab. The station says investigators believe Benoit killed his wife and the boy, Daniel, sometime over the weekend, and then himself sometime today. A concerned neighbor called police. The bodies were found in three different rooms.\n\nThe lead investigator, Fayette County sheriff's Lieutenant Tommy Pope, said only that the deaths were being investigated as homicide. He said the cause of death awaits autopsy results on Tuesday. The 40-year-old Benoit, a native of Canada, was a former world heavyweight champion, Intercontinental champion and held several tag-team titles over his career. Benoit was scheduled to perform at the \"Vengeance\" pay-per-view event Sunday night in Houston, but was replaced at the last minute because of what announcer Jim Ross called \"personal reasons.\" Benoit maintained a home in metro Atlanta from the time he wrestled for the defunct World Championship Wrestling.\n\nThe federal-style house is in a secluded neighborhood set back about 60 yards off a gravel road, surrounded by stacked stone wall and double-iron gate.\n\nCourtesy: Associated Press"
