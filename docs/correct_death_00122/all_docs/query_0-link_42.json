    "text": "Pro wrestling star killed family, self Source: Benoit strangled wife, smothered son, hanged himself\n\nFayetteville, Ga. â€” Pro wrestler Chris Benoit strangled his wife and smothered his son before hanging himself in his weight room, a law enforcement official close to the investigation told The Associated Press Tuesday.\n\nThe official spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAuthorities also said they are investigating whether steroids may have been a factor in the deaths.\n\nFayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said test results may not be back for weeks or even months.\n\nAutopsies were scheduled Tuesday by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation in DeKalb County.\n\nBenoit canceled a pay-per-view appearance at the \"Vengeance\" event in Houston because of \"personal reasons\" a day before he, his wife and their 7-year-old son were found dead on Monday.\n\nDetails of the deaths \"are going to prove a little bizarre\" when released to the public, Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Monday.\n\nInvestigators believe Benoit (pronounced ben-WAH) killed his wife, 43-year-old Nancy, and son Daniel during the weekend and then himself Monday. The bodies were found Monday afternoon in three separate rooms of the house, off a gravel road about two miles from the Whitewater Country Club.\n\nBallard told The Associated Press a gun was not used in any of the deaths.\n\n\"We're pretty sure we know, but we want to confirm it with the crime lab,\" Ballard said early Tuesday.\n\nFayette County Coroner C.J. Mowell did not return calls seeking comment. The answering service for his funeral home said he was out of town.\n\nAuthorities also declined to say whether drugs or steroids were found inside the house. \"We're not releasing any information as far as what was located inside the house,\" sheriff's Sgt. Keith Whiteside said Tuesday.\n\nAsked about the condition of the interior of the house, Whiteside said investigators found \"nothing really out of the ordinary.\" He said Benoit was found in the home's weight room, his wife in an office and the son in an upstairs bedroom.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment said on its Web site that it asked authorities to check on Benoit and his family after being alerted by friends who received \"several curious text messages sent by Benoit early Sunday morning.\"\n\nThe WWE, based in Stamford, Conn., said it had been asked by authorities not to release further information on the deaths.\n\nBenoit was born in Montreal. He was a former world heavyweight champion, Intercontinental champion and held several tag-team titles over his career. He was known by several names including \"The Canadian Crippler.\"\n\n\"WWE extends its sincerest thoughts and prayers to the Benoit family's relatives and loved ones in this time of tragedy,\" the company said in a statement on its Web site.\n\nBenoit had maintained a home in metro Atlanta from the time he wrestled for the defunct World Championship Wrestling. The Fayette County Tax Assessors Office lists the value of the house, situated on more than 8.5 acres, at nearly $900,000.\n\nThe WWE canceled its live \"Monday Night RAW\" card in Corpus Christi, Texas, and USA Network aired a three-hour tribute to Benoit in place of the scheduled wrestling telecast.\n\nBenoit's wife managed several wrestlers and went by the stage name \"Woman,\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nThey met when her then-husband drew up a script that had them involved in a relationship as part of an ongoing story line on World Championship Wrestling, the newspaper said.\n\nBenoit has two other children from a prior relationship.\n\nBenoit became a standout at an early age among wrestling prospects who trained in the dungeon basement of the house where fellow Canadians and professional wrestlers Owen and Bret Hart trained. Owen Hart was killed during a wrestling event in 1999.\n\n\"He was like a family member to me, and everyone in my family is taking it real hard,\" said Bret Hart, a five-time champion with the now-defunct World Wrestling Federation."
