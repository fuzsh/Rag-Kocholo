        "text": "FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. - WWE wrestler Chris Benoit, his wife, and son were found dead Monday and police said they were investigating the deaths as a murder-suicide.\n\nDetective Bo Turner told television station WAGA that the case was being treated as a murder-suicide, but said that couldn't be confirmed until evidence was examined by a crime lab.\n\nThe station said investigators think Benoit, 40, killed his wife, Nancy, and 7-year-old son, Daniel, over the weekend, then himself on Monday. A neighbor called police, and the bodies were found in three rooms.\n\nLead investigator Lt. Tommy Pope of the Fayette County Sheriff's Department told The Associated Press the deaths were being investigated as homicide, and that the causes of death awaited autopsy results today.\n\nPope said the bodies were discovered about 2:30 p.m., but refused to release details.\n\nThe house is in a secluded neighborhood set back about 60 yards off a gravel road, surrounded by stacked stone wall and a double-iron gate. On Monday night, the house was dark except for a few outside lights. There was a police car in front, along with two uniformed officers.\n\nBenoit was a former world heavyweight and intercontinental champion. He also held several tag-team titles during his career.\n\n\"WWE extends its sincerest thoughts and prayers to the Benoit family's relatives and loved ones in this time of tragedy,\" the federation said in a statement on its Web site.\n\nBenoit was scheduled to perform at the \"Vengeance\" pay-per-view event Sunday night in Houston, but was replaced at the last minute because of what announcer Jim Ross called \"personal reasons.\"\n\nThe WWE canceled its live \"Monday Night RAW\" card in Corpus Christi, Texas, and USA Network aired a three-hour tribute to Benoit in place of the scheduled wrestling telecast."
