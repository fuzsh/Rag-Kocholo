We will probably never know exactly why, but I'm sure we'll find out how, which is not a good thing and I hope the WWE have enough respect not to let that out. This is a delicate topic, and I hope no one is hanging out to hear how, when and where the deaths happened, because that is just sick. We should be focusing on the wrestler, Chris Benoit, and giving him the honour, reverence and respect that he earned by putting his life into the wrestling business, but I understand that this death is going to make people want to talk, and all I can say is that this is a very sad situation, and one I don't really want to comment much on. I know it looks bad now, but we are forgetting the Benoit we knew before today.\n\n\n\nThe whole situation just seems very odd. Something was definitely up when Benoit left for a 'family emergency' and the reports of those text messages only makes the story seem a lot more wierder. But again, it is hard enough to comment on what might have happened, and I've posted all that I can about it."
