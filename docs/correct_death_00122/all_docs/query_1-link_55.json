        "text": "It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. For fans of Chris Benoit, it couldn’t get any better then this. Benoit was scheduled to defeat CM Punk for the vacated ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Arguably, the best wrestler in the world would be the focal point of the WWE’s third brand. Not only would he serve as the standard for the brand, but he would also be used to help teach the future stars of the wrestling industry. However, that would all change during a late June weekend.\n\nOn Monday, June 25th, the Fayette County Sheriff’s department found the bodies of Chris Benoit, wife Nancy Benoit, and son Daniel Benoit lying dead in their home. Fans around the world were in shock “How could this happen?” was the big question being asked. A stunned WWE, who was to present a three hour RAW honoring the “death of Mr.McMahon,” showed a class and dignity rarely seen in professional wrestling. They cancelled the show, and instead held an empty arena tribute show to Chris Benoit that featured career highlights, and kind words from mourning colleagues. Their website was also filled with tributes that honored the “Canadian Crippler.” Little did they, or most anyone, know at the time was that the life they were celebrating belonged to the same man that caused these three deaths.\n\nThe first information that I read of the deaths was from a 6:21pm post that night on the “Wrestling Observer” website. The title, which read “Benoit family found dead” detailed the following report:\n\n“The WWE just told its talent and released on its web site that Chris Benoit was found dead by Atlanta police. Benoit, wife Nancy a.k.a. Woman and his son Daniel were all found dead.”\n\nAt the time, I believed that there was probably a gas leak, or something similar in the home, which caused their passing. Never in my wildest dreams, or nightmares, did I ever imagine what would follow.\n\n“Wrestling Observer” website post from 9:41pm:\n\n“Lt. Tommy Pope told the Associated Press that it was being investigated as a homicide pending results of a preliminary autopsy report that will come out tomorrow. No gunshot or stab wounds were found, but they couldn’t rule out poisoning, suffocation, or strangulation. Pope said he was not confirming any of these potential causes, just not ruling them out. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported it is being investigated as a murder/suicide.”\n\nAt this point, I was still in denial that Chris had anything to do with the deaths. I was thinking that maybe someone murdered the three Benoits. I couldn’t fathom anything like what was about to come out to the surface.\n\nAt 11:29pm, the “Wrestling Observer” website ran another update on the Benoit story.\n\n“According to a report on WAGA-TV, investigators believe Chris Benoit killed his wife and son at some point over the weekend, and then killed himself earlier today. They reported first hearing from a concerned neighbor and that the three bodies were found in separate rooms. Detective Bo Turner told the station the case was being investigated as a murder-suicide, but it could not be confirmed until the evidence was examined by a crime lab. Sources in the Fayette County Police Department are now working under the theory that Chris Benoit killed Nancy on Saturday, son Daniel on Sunday, and then killed himself earlier today. Benoit was found dead in his weight room. Nancy was found dead in the living room. Daniel was found dead in his bedroom, according to an unnamed source in the department. Lt. Tommy Pope told ABC News “the instruments of death were located on the scene,” but didn’t specify what those were or where they were found. Pope said the department was not actively searching for any suspects outside the house.”\n\nThe biggest question faced now was “how did this happen? This isn’t the Chris Benoit that we knew.” In discussing the finding that would be coming out surrounding the case, with the “Atlanta-Journal Constitution,” Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said “the details, when they come out are going to prove a little bizarre.” He was right on the money with that one. However, before we look at what happened that weekend, as well as the aftermath, it is just as important to look at, not just the events that proceeded that fateful weekend, but the couple’s history together.\n\nWhile in World Championship Wrestling, Nancy was married, at the time, to Kevin Sullivan. Kevin, who was the booker for the company, set up an angle where Woman (Nancy Sullivan) left him for Chris Benoit. This set up the Sullivan-Benoit feud. To make the angle seem more then just a “storyline,” in a time when kayfabe was breaking away from the wrestling industry, Kevin had Nancy travel with Benoit. Chris was married to another woman at the time, but his relationship with his wife was rocky at the moment. The Chris/Woman union helped to speed up the end of his real life marriage. Eventually, Nancy and Kevin split up in real life as well, and Chris and Nancy had nothing to stand in their way of being a couple. It’s been joked for years around the wrestling world that Kevin Sullivan booked his own divorce.\n\nEventually, Nancy moved in with Chris in Peachtree City, Georgia. In 2000, they were married around the time Daniel was born. According to the “Wrestling Observer,” when Benoit had his neck surgery, a friend “noted how strongly he took his body image because of how freaked out he was over losing size in his arms.\n\nDuring the year (2001-2002) that he was out of action, due to the neck surgery, the “Wrestling Observer” is reporting that a friend of Nancy’s claims that Nancy “first became alarmed because he was continuing to use anabolic steroids even though she felt he had no need for them because he wasn’t wrestling. Friends of Chris said, at the time Chris confided he was afraid of getting too small. Plus, he continued a level of pain pill usage that concerned her. The two had minor separations during that period. The two also had major fights in front of social friends, with a pattern that the friends would calm them down and get them back together, but then afterwards, as if they were embarrassed about it, they would cut those people off socially for months at a time.”\n\nOn May 12, 2003, Nancy Benoit filed for divorce from Chris Benoit. She also was granted a protective order petition, stating that Chris “lost his temper, threatened to strike her and cause extensive damage to the home and personal belongings of both her and Chris, including furniture and furnishings.” The petition stated that Nancy is “in reasonable fear for petitioner’s own safety and that of the minor child.” A judge issued a restraining order against Chris, barring him from the family home. In the divorce papers, Nancy claimed that Chris made $500,000 a year as a professional wrestler. She asked for permanent custody of Daniel, as well as child support payments from Chris. Chris countered her request by only asking for joint custody of son Daniel. On August 19, 2003, Nancy filed with the courts to have both the divorce petition and the protective order petition to be dismissed.\n\nAccording to the “Wrestling Observer Newsletter,” the Chris Benoit whom most people knew seemed to change after November 13, 2005. That was the date where his best friend Eddie Guerrero was found dead. Benoit and Eddie had faced similar demons, in Benoit’s opinion. Since Eddie could understand Benoit’s emotions, Eddie could “talk him (Chris) out of doing things he would regret later.”\n\nHis behavior starting getting even worse after February 16, 2006. On that date, Mike “Johnny Grunge” Durham passed away from complications stemming from sleep apnea. Johnny Grunge was not only a good friend and neighbor to Chris Benoit, but he also served as a buffer between Chris and Nancy during arguments that the two may have been having. When Chris and Nancy would be fighting, Nancy would call Grunge, and he would “diffuse the situation, because no matter how bad things were, Chris almost always found him (Grunge) funny and entertaining, even if it was nothing more than seeing Grunge act goofy when he was loaded. This was according to two different sources that spoke to Dave Meltzer. With Grunge now gone, Chris and Nancy no longer had that intermediary who could come between the couple during hostile moments.\n\nA few weeks before Grunge passed away, Victor “Black Cat” Mar, who was Chris’s best friend in Japan also died. According to the “Wrestling Observer Newsletter” this week, “The strain of having to deal with one death after another of people close to him made him mentally distraught. One close friend noted that Johnny Grunge’s death maybe even more so than the Guerrero death, because it was the third, and because that one affected his marriage the most.”\n\nAccording to the “Observer” Chris “took deaths harder than most, and there was a never ending string of those close to him. Owen Hart, Brian Pillman, Davey Boy Smith, Stu & Helen Hart, Brian Hildebrand, Bad News Allen, and several others all over a relatively short period of time. Uncharacteristically, Chris absolutely refused to attend the funeral of Durham (Grunge), saying he never wanted to go into church again and saying he hated religion.”\n\nBefore Eddie’s death, according to the “Observer,” a person close to Nancy and Chris said that “Chris was the type who threw things around when he would get mad, but at least at that time, there was never any evidence he could see of him ever doing any physical harm to her (Nancy).” This friend said that Chris’s normal m.o. during a fight with Nancy would be to leave the house, and go for a drive. This pattern led to Chris Benoit’s only brush with the law. In September 1998, Benoit had an argument with Nancy. He left the house, and was drinking in the car. The police found him drunk late at night, parked in front of a house on Fairfield Drive. He told the police that he used to live in the house before his divorce the year before, and he was just reminiscing. He was then charged with a DUI.\n\nAccording to the “Wrestling Observer Newsletter,” after Grunge’s death, Chris “showed increasing signs of losing his grip with reality. Yet, at the same time, he was apparently able to largely, but apparently not completely, masquerade it when he was on the road with the WWE, or when guests were at the home.”\n\nChris started to become increasingly paranoid. According to Meltzer, Chris believed someone was stalking himself, along with his family. He wouldn’t let his wife leave the house after 6pm, and he wouldn’t let his son play outside the house. He even moved his family out of their Peachtree City home, and into the house in Fayetteville, Georgia.\n\nAccording to the “Wrestling Observer,” the police believe that “his steroid use may have contributed to the mental problems that led to his paranoia of the past several months. Benoit had believed that there was some unknown person out to get him, and he often took different routes home from the airport to his house, and then eventually moved, believing he was being followed.”\n\nThe “Wrestling Observer” reported that it was “around this time that Nancy put a note in a safe deposit box. The note basically said that if anything happened to her, it was Chris who did it.”\n\nIt appeared that the two had recently separated at one point. Two or three weeks ago, Chris Benoit sent out a change of address form to Dave Meltzer to an apartment on 1029 North Peachtree Parkway in Peachtree City, Georgia. However, in Saturday’s Headlines on the “Wrestling Observer” website, Meltzer reports that “as it turns out, and this came indirectly from someone close with Nancy, either Chris, Nancy or both, no longer wanted any mail of any kind coming to the house, so they set up a different address for all the mail.”\n\nTHURSDAY, JUNE 21st: Shane Helms said that Chris Benoit called that day to check up on him as Chris has done every week since Shane has been out recovering from a broken neck. According to the “Wrestling Observer,” another WWE employee said that he “was in contact with Nancy, and she was a basket case, horribly distraught over the death of Sherri Martel, whom she was close with. He noted the two were exchanging e-mail photos of their children.”\n\nThe “Observer” is also reporting that Nancy “called one of her closest friends, who also knew Chris well, and said she was scared to death, and also reiterated that, ‘If anything happens to me, look at Chris.’ The friend told Nancy to get out of the house immediately, and hide out in an apartment (as she claimed Nancy had done in the past). The other woman immediately confided in a former wrestler and close friend, who told her to tell Nancy to get Daniel to Nancy’s parent’s home in Daytona Beach.”\n\nNancy told her friend that “Chris’ drug usage, which she claimed escalated badly after the death of Guerrero, had worsened of late, and he was even more paranoid. Chris and Nancy’s problems worsened, as well. Nancy found out that Chris set up a bank account in the name of his ex-wife in Edmonton. He also took out a new insurance policy that listed his ex-wife and their two children as the beneficiaries. Nancy confronted Chris regarding her findings. She demanded that their son Daniel, and herself be listed on the insurance policy as beneficiaries as well. He refused her request.\n\nAccording to the “Wrestling Observer Newsletter,” Chris had become “paranoid about money.” A few weeks ago in the “Observer,” Dave Meltzer talked about how the WWE viewed Benoit as being in the WWE for life. They figured that after his days of performing came to an end, he would make an ideal coach to teach his craft to future generations of would-be WWE superstars. However, Chris did not see this vision. He told Nancy that he was in the same territory for too long, but there were no new places to go in the industry. Chris was very concerned about getting a pay cut in his new contract. Chris thought that being moved to ECW was “like a move to oblivion.” He thought that since he was in the federation for so long, that being moved to ECW was his final stage in the WWE before they push him out the door. He felt that without wrestling, he had nothing.\n\nThe “Observer” questions “whether Chris was even aware that the long-term plan was for him to have a run with the ECW title and to work with and help improve the experienced talent they were going to put on that roster, but then be transferred to RAW, theoretically with a strong push, is unknown. He could have been told and not believed it, or could have simply not been aware. It is unknown if he was told ahead of time that he was winning the ECW title at the Vengeance PPV.”\n\nRegarding his increased paranoia, the “Observer” continued “Nancy claimed this paranoia about losing his job led him to increase the amount of drugs he had been taking and mixing, claiming he had increased his steroid use, pain killer use, anti-depression drugs, as well as the high blood pressure medication he was taking to offset health problems caused by the steroid use.”\n\nLater on Thursday, Nancy visited Dr. Phil Astin, who was Chris’ personal physician. According to the “Observer,” Nancy was asking questions “about how she could raise Daniel on her own, and she had her own issues, as she was in severe pain because she hadn’t healed well from undergoing similar neck surgery (as Chris did) under Dr. Lloyd Youngblood last year.”\n\nFRIDAY, JUNE 22ND: Chris went to see Dr. Astin, complaining of severe depression. Dr. Astin gave him a prescription for Zoloft. Lately, the doctor has been prescribing testosterone for Chris as well, because years of steroid abuse have caused his natural testosterone to fall to unhealthy low levels. According to Meltzer, the low testosterone levels “is not a rare symptom for long-term steroid users, nor is it unusual for that to be abused by bodybuilders and athletes who are really using it as a legal way to get steroids.”\n\nDr. Astin said that during his Friday visit, Benoit’s demeanor was not suspicious. According to Astin, “He (Chris) certainly didn’t show any signs of any distress or rage or anything. I’m still very surprised and shocked, especially with his child Daniel involved. He worshipped his child.”\n\nFRIDAY NIGHT, JUNE 22ND: Nancy and Chris had an argument. The Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard and investigators from the Sheriff’s Department believed that Nancy may have been telling Chris that she was leaving him for good, and taking Daniel with her. It is believed that during this argument Chris overpowered Nancy, tied up her hands and feet with tape, and threw her to the floor. Chris then stuck his knee into Nancy’s back, wrapped a cable TV wire around her neck. He then pulled up until she died. Due to the blood that was found under Nancy’s face, the police believe that Chris smashed her face into the floor after she died. It appeared that Nancy did try to fight off Chris as the evidence in the office room showed signs of a physical struggle.\n\nSATURDAY MORNING, JUNE 23RD: The police believe that Chris went into Daniel’s room in the morning, and strangled his son. There were no bruises on Daniel that would constitute a “strangulation by hands.” The cops believed that Chris had to use some form of a chokehold on Daniel. According to the “Observer,” the police were confused at the bruising patterns that were found on the son. “Until one of them watched footage of a Benoit wrestling match, saw him using the move, and in looking closely, realized the bruising patterns on Daniel matched the application of the hold. There was bruising consistent with the crippler crossface (Benoit’s finishing hold) on one arm and his face. There were no bruises on his neck. The police don’t believe, because of the size difference, that the hold was applied exactly as it would be in a pro wrestling match. Benoit would have been in more of a kneeling position, sort of straddling Daniel while using one leg to pull back on his arm. Police were not sure if Benoit waited until his son was asleep to kill him, with the idea that in doing so, he wouldn’t suffer as. The reason they are publicly calling it a choke hold in every media interview is because the police believe it’s already a big enough circus around this case without the media jumping on the usage of a wrestling term or a pro wrestling finishing hold to describe how he killed his son.”\n\nSATURDAY AFTERNOON, JUNE 23RD: A “groggy” Chris Benoit contacted the WWE office stating that his wife and kid were both ill, throwing up blood due to food poisoning. He told the office that he would have to miss his scheduled appearance at the WWE house show in Beaumont, TX later in the evening.\n\nEARLY SUNDAY MORNING, JUNE 24TH BETWEEN 3:53AM AND 3:58AM: Chris sent out five text messages to two co-workers in the WWE. The first two text messages came from his cell phone. The first read, “My physical address is 130 Green Meadow Lane, Fayetteville, GA 30215.” The next text message read, “The dogs are in the enclosed pool area. Garage side door is open. The last three text messages were placed using Nancy’s cell phone. Each message read, “My physical address is 130 Green Meadow Lane, Fayetteville, GA 30215.” According to the “New York Daily News,” Chris Benoit also sent out text messages that included Bible passages and sections of his will.\n\nSUNDAY MORNING, JUNE 24TH: The WWE rebooked Chris Benoit’s flight, so he can make that night’s pay per view. When they tried to contact Chris regarding his new travel plans, the office could not get in touch with him.\n\nSUNDAY, JUNE 24TH: The WWE continued to try to contact Chris Benoit at his home, and in local Atlanta-area hospitals throughout the day. They failed to contact him by 11pm that night.\n\nMONDAY, JUNE 25TH AT 12:01AM: An unnamed person updated Chris Benoit’s page on the “Wikipedia” internet encyclopedia website. The post stated that Chris Benoit missed his match “stemming from the death of his wife Nancy.” The post was made from someone using an IP address registered in Stamford, CT, the town that is home to World Wrestling Entertainment’s executive offices. It was found that the post was NOT made by any computers or servers registered to anyone within the WWE. Wikipedia reversed this edit an hour later, with a note stating “need a reliable source. Saying that his wife died is a pretty big statement, you need to back it up with something.” An hour later, a second anonymous edit using an Australian wireless Internet service provider, made the same claim regarding Benoits wife, but adding “several pro wrestling websites is attributed to the passing of Benoit’s wife, Nancy.” That message was reverted less then 20 minutes later with the note, “saying ‘several pro wrestling websites’ is still not reliable information.”\n\nSOMETIME BETWEEN LATE SUNDAY MORNING, JUNE 24TH AND EARLY MONDAY MORNING, JUNE 25TH: Chris Benoit killed himself. According to the “Wrestling Observer Newsletter,” Chris “used the lat pulldown machine in the basement of his home gym, took off the bar, put a cloth around his neck, and then tied the steel cord around his neck. He stuck a pin in a heavy amount of weight (240 pounds according to the Nancy Grace show on CNN), far more then his own bodyweight, and somehow or other, used his arms and the jumping of his bodyweight down to pull more than his weight down to where he hooked his legs around a heavy dumbbell (which was on the ground underneath him as he was hanging), which would have been enough weight to keep him down. He then would have likely spread his legs, and without the weight of the dumbbell, the heavy stack of weights due to the gravity imbalance, flew down, lifting him off the ground into the air, and hanging him to death.” According to CNN, in news that was later released, reported “in the room, an almost empty wine bottle was found (which confirms the People magazine report), and ten empty beer cans.”\n\nMONDAY, JUNE 25TH AROUND 12:30PM: With Benoit still missing, the WWE officials were told about the text messages that he had sent. Richard Hering, the WWE’s Vice President of Governmental Affairs, contacted the Fayette County Sheriff’s department asking for a “welfare check” on the Benoit family.\n\nMONDAY, JUNE 25TH 2:30PM: Lt. Tommy Pope found the three bodies dead in the Benoit house in Fayetteville, GA.\n\nMONDAY, JUNE 25TH 4:00PM: The Fayette County sheriff’s office contacted the WWE. They informed the WWE that the bodies of Chris, Nancy, and Daniel were found dead, and that the home was considered a crime scene. The wrestlers were informed to come to the ring immediately. There, Vince told everyone the tragic news regarding Chris Benoit, and his wife and child. Vince told everyone, that they can stay or go home. He also allowed the SmackDown! and ECW wrestlers to be able to leave or go home, and nothing would be held against them. Ted DiBiase, who was to have a cameo on that night’s RAW, instead was helping to counsel wrestlers and other office personnel who were having trouble coping with the news. The wrestlers were told that the show was going to be cancelled, so they could go back to their hotels. The show would consist of some tribute speeches by a few wrestlers on the live RAW telecast, which would include previous Benoit matches and scenes from his DVD.\n\nBy early Tuesday morning, June 26th, the word had spread that the Benoit deaths were now being ruled a murder/suicide, with Chris being held accountable for murdering his wife and child. While most of the wrestling world was shocked by this development, the “Wrestling Observer” states that some were not so surprised. “The marriage was so volatile that the few who knew them at home were not nearly so shocked it ended tragically, calling it a time bomb waiting to explode. However, they couldn’t fathom Chris killing his son.”\n\nAccording to the “Observer,” there were “definitely some wrestlers who believed from the moment the words came out of Vince’s mouth that Chris was in some way responsible, but like everyone else, none could fathom he killed his son. While most people say there were no outward signs of problems with Chris on the road, there were wrestlers who were saying Chris was acting crazier than usual during the same timeline after the three deaths, and appearing to have emotional problems. The feeling was that he badly needed therapy, but most likely nobody suggested it, because the belief was Benoit was not the kind of person who would go to therapy. Those people sensed at the time he was consumed by the desire to be at the HHH/Shawn Michaels level, and frustrated when he wasn’t hanging at that level after having been there. And people were aware of his problems at home. He was constantly worried. Then he took time off from wrestling, at home, all he thought about was wrestling. When he was on the road wrestling, he was worried about his family.”\n\nDuring the RAW tribute show, before the wrestlers knew the true story, William Regal, who knew Chris Benoit from his Peachtree City dark-side, would only call Chris a “great wrestler and felt that he couldn’t say anything else under the circumstances.” He was clearly suspicious that Chris had something to do with it. When more and more information started to fly in, the love and sadness that the wrestling community felt towards Chris Benoit turned into hate and anger. According to the “Wrestling Observer” newsletter, “Ric Flair, who had known Nancy for more than two decades because he had been close friends with the Sullivans, was particularly furious at Benoit.”\n\nLance Storm on his website commentary has stated; “The Chris Benoit that I knew some how ceased to exist sometime before Friday June 22, because the Chris Benoit that I knew, could not have done what is now painfully clear he did do. I can offer no explanation or excuse for his actions and will not attempt to defend him. There is no acceptable defense for what he did. I have kids and I cannot even comprehend this act. I either never new the real Chris Benoit or something horrific happened inside of him prior to the 22nd. Many people are blaming drugs. I don’t accept that, and consider drugs an easy scapegoat. If drugs were a factor, then that blame must also fall on Chris Benoit, because from all accounts, he knowingly and willingly took those drugs.”\n\nOn Jim Ross’ website, he said, “The senseless and tragic death of the 3 people in the double murder-suicide that occurred over the weekend in the Benoit’s home in an Atlanta suburb is a nightmare that one still wants to awake from. For those of us that knew Chris, Nancy, and Daniel on a personal level it is still hard to believe that this horrific event could even occur much less why. The last time I saw the three of them together was at Wrestlemania 23 and my wife and I had a long visit with the Benoits and at no time could one detect that there were any issues whatsoever. I even had the occasion to speak at length privately to Nancy and she said things were fine at home. As well as Nancy and I knew each other, if that had not been the case, she would have inferred otherwise I assure you. Like so many others who attended the event on that night, the Benoit family was happy and enjoying the moment. So what happened? I do not know. No one knows. We will hopefully know more when the toxicology reports are completed. Until then all anyone has, including the media, is supposition based on speculation. Why are three people dead? What caused this irrational and totally uncharacteristic behavior from an individual who hereto for had never demonstrated such tendencies in his workplace, not even once? I don’t know and neither does anyone else until the medical examiner can provide more information and then there will be most likely questions in this matter than may never be answered. I know this, God knows and he will deal with this matter accordingly. The bottom line is that a woman and a small child are dead of murder and that is an utter shame. That act is inexcusable. The victim’s families need to be held close to our hearts and in our prayers. Let’s consider putting forth as much passion and effort in prayer and reflection as some are in playing amateur detective and wannabe investigative reporters. Let’s spend a little more time with our own families while we are at it, because there are no guarantees about tomorrow and we should covet every day we are blessed to have with our loved ones. I know this, I am going to do all I can to spend more time with family and friends than ever before as this sad situation has slapped me in the face in more ways than one.”\n\nRob Van Dam left the following blog on his website, “Well, there’s no need to wait until we have our heads wrapped around this, because I doubt that’ll happen, so here it is. I know that a monster committed those terrible, unforgivable acts of horror. Just like everyone who knew Chris Benoit, I can’t think of him as a monster. Not Chris. Chris was truly a role model’s role model. You simply had to respect him and admire his focus and unmatched discipline. If I ever got asked a question about who I looked up to the most in the business, you guessed it. That’s me sharing a real feeling with you. Not talking about bull shit that I have little interest in, like who would I like most to wrestle with, or what’s my favorite color, but who I actually looked up to in the dressing room. It’s Chris Benoit- in the ring and in the dressing room and with his family. The last time I talked to Chris, a few weeks ago, he told me how much he respected me for stepping away from the business. His message now comes to me from beyond. He said “Some of us don’t know when to get out.” I told him that I always held a little contempt for him telling me back in 1992 that I was a dumb-ass for wanting to quit WCW, and mentioned the irony. Over the last several years, on overseas tours I’d always see Chris in the gym when the other guys were recovering from the night before. He’d train hard and sometimes I’d see him allowing young wrestlers to follow his lead and get a guaranteed killer workout. He took pride in what he did and set a great example for others, myself included, to follow.\n\nHow many murderers…baby murderers at that… are praised so highly by EVERYONE who knew them? This is all so bizarre and new information seems to come out every few hours but I can’t imagine we’ll ever understand what happened here. It appears that Chris took the answers with him. To tell you the honest truth, the easiest thing for me to believe at this moment is that if no framework was involved, he was taken over by demonic energies with no compassion. I have to believe this is often the case with such inhumane acts. Nancy, Daniel and Chris’ tragic deaths obviously have affected a lot of people. Just remember, there’s enough hate in this world. Hateful thoughts do not move us in the right direction, so make a conscious effort to remember that. It’s important now and always.”\n\nVictoria was a little less nice when talking about Chris Benoit on her site. “I had planned on starting off talking about a recent trip to an arena football game, but I would be remiss not to address the Chris Benoit situation. Everyone who knew anything about wrestling knew of his in-ring contributions. I truly don’t know what I can say and not get in trouble with the WWE. Anyone who reads my blogs regularly knows how much I love wrestling, and being part of the WWE. But I think what I have to say is more important. His son, Daniel, came to many shows. We bonded. He a was a cute little boy. What Chris did was selfish and hurtful. I fear that him being a superstar in some way glamorizes the situation. That’s not what suicide is. It is selfish and hurtful. As long as you have a breath to breathe, you can make change to improve your life. You can talk to family, or friends, or clergy. And if you’re not comfortable with any of them, here are two phone numbers for a Suicide and Crisis Hotline. 1-800-784-2433 (1-800-SUICIDE) or 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). They take calls 24/7. You always have options. Maybe someday I’ll be able to forgive Chris, but not today.”\n\nEric Bischoff posted a commentary on his website, as well. “I can not begin to articulate my feelings about the tragedy in the Benoit family. It is something I am really struggling to comprehend.\n\nI heard the news late Monday afternoon just as I was sitting down in a business meeting in Pittsburgh, I sat stunned as I listened to DDP on the other end of the phone, trying to tell me what happened. My meeting went very late into the evening and there was little new information when I went to bed. My phone rang at 7am on Tues. and the caller ID revealed a 404 area code. Assuming it was someone that I used to work with in the area, I answered the phone. It was a local sports/talk show in the Atlanta area and they wanted to get my comments. I hesitated, but since the radio personality was a friend of a friend, I decided to go ahead. The questions started out ok…what one would normally expect in a situation like this. However they quickly turned into a “who’s to blame” line of questioning and went down hill from there. It’s really impossible anymore to be honest about something as tragic and emotionally charged as this issue without sounding like I have some kind of “hidden agenda”. Its clear that the media wants to blame steroids, professional wrestling, Vince McMahon, or anyone or anything else that further sensationalizes this family tragedy. I refuse to join the choir. I don’t have enough information. I wasn’t there. I am not a psychiatrist. I just can’t imagine how or why this could have happened. God bless Nancy and Daniel. God forgive Chris Benoit.”\n\nTUESDAY AFTERNOON, JUNE 26TH: The Fayette County Sheriff’s Department held a news conference regarding the double murder/suicide of Chris, Nancy, and Daniel Benoit. In the press conference, District Attorney Scott Ballard said that law enforcement officials have determined that Benoit killed his wife Nancy on Friday night via affixation, then did the same to Daniel on Saturday morning before hanging himself Saturday night. He continued by saying that Nancy’s wrists and feet were bound by tape, and there was some blood under her head. Ballard said that Nancy was found in an upstairs living room area. Daniel was found in his own bed in his upstairs bedroom. A Bible was found lying next to each victim. Ballard confirmed that Chris hung himself with a cord in his basement weight room. The press were told that anabolic steroids and “what was described by one law-enforcement official as ‘lots’ of what is believed legal prescription medication were found in the house. A WWE co-worker received a text message on a delayed basis from Benoit. Benoit was previously arrested in the Atlanta area on a DUI charge, but has no record of a previous arrest for domestic violence. There was no suicide note found in the home. Ballard said “in a community like this, it’s bizarre to have a murder/suicide, especially involving the death of a seven-year-old child. That’s what struck me the most in all of this. There’s a seven-year-old boy who’s dead. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to wrap my mind around that completely. It struck me as somewhat bizarre that he would even be in the home with their deceased bodies all that time. I’m baffled why anyone would kill a seven-year-old. I don’t have any idea at all about a motive.”\n\nWhile they do not seem to have a motive, the “Wrestling Observer” said that the police believe that after killing Nancy, Chris “recognized that his son was going to be taken away from him. A police investigator who had seen other similar cases said the thought of someone else having control over the child becomes too much for the parent, so he kills the child. But that is nothing more then a theory, and nobody will ever know the truth.”\n\nAfter the press conference, two battle lines were drawn. One was formed by the media, who tried to pin this as a case of roid rage that ended in tragedy. The other was led by the WWE, who was trying to cover themselves by distancing the company from Chris Benoit, and by attacking the media’s assumption that steroids were the cause of the double murder/suicide.\n\nOnce news broke out that Chris Benoit had murdered his wife and child, the WWE knew that they were going to take a public relations hit for airing a Chris Benoit tribute show, despite not having all of the facts at the time. The WWE immediately removed any Chris Benoit tributes from their websites. They also removed all of Chris Benoit’s merchandise from their ShopZone website. They even went so far as to edit all of the DVDs that have any mention of Chris Benoit in its description. For instance the WrestleMania XX DVD’s description for the main event now reads “Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H.”\n\nCable news shows on MSNBC, FOX News Channel, and CNN all had feature stories on the Benoit case. Each show tried to point the finger at steroids being the main culprit. While steroids, and other drugs may have played a role in the murders/suicide, they should not, at this point, be looked at as the sole reason for the tragedy.\n\nThe WWE released the following statement regarding the media’s reporting on the case.\n\n“STAMFORD, Conn., June 26, 2007 – World Wrestling Entertainment is stunned and saddened by the details released by local authorities concerning the double homicide-suicide involving Chris Benoit, his wife, Nancy, and his son, Daniel.\n\nHowever, WWE is concerned with the sensationalistic reporting and speculation being undertaken by some members of the media following the press conference held by the Fayette County Sheriff’s Department and the District Attorney. During the press conference, the investigating authorities made the following points, all of which run contrary to the media speculation that “roid rage” was a factor in the senseless murders and suicide:\n\n1. The authorities stated that all drugs found in the house were believed to be legal prescriptions.\n\n2. Steroids were not, and could not, be related to the cause of death (asphyxiation). Authorities had no factual basis to speculate as to Benoit’s state of mind, and rightly did not do so.\n\n3. Toxicology tests have not even been completed, so there is no current evidence that Benoit even had steroids or any other substance in his body. In that regard, on the last test done on Benoit by WWE’s independently administered drug-testing program, done on April 10, 2007, Benoit tested negative.\n\n4. The physical findings announced by authorities indicate deliberation, not rage. The wife’s feet and hands were bound and she was asphyxiated, not beaten to death. By the account of the authorities, there were substantial periods of time between the death of the wife and the death of the son, again suggesting deliberate thought, not rage. The presence of a Bible by each is also not an act of rage.\n\n5. WWE strongly suggests that it is entirely wrong for speculators to suggest that steroids had anything to do with these senseless acts, especially when the authorities plainly stated there is no evidence that Benoit had steroids in his body, pending the toxicological reports, and that they had no evidence at this time as to the motive for these acts.\n\nWWE is continuing to monitor the ongoing investigation being conducted by local authorities.”\n\nWhile the media was concentrating on the steroid aspect of the case, a new development came to light. The media found out that Daniel had needle marks on his arm, and was receiving Human Growth Hormone injections by, the media assumed, his father Chris Benoit. After further investigation, it appears that there was a valid reason for injecting Daniel with HGH. It appears that Daniel Benoit may have suffered from Fragile X syndrome. According to a Delta British Columbia radio station, Pam Winthrop said Daniel Benoit had the disease.\n\nThe wikipedia website describes Fragile X as “a genetic disorder caused by mutation of the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. Mutation at that site is found in 1 out of about every 2000 males and 1 out of about every 259 females. (Incidence of the disease itself is about 1 in every 4000 females.) Normally, the FMR1 gene contains between 6 and 55 repeats of the CGG codon (trinucleotide repeats). In people with the fragile X syndrome, the FMR1 allele has over 230 repeats of this codon. Aside from intellectual disability, prominent characteristics of the syndrome include an elongated face, large or protruding ears, flat feet, larger testicles in men (macroorchidism), and low muscle tone. Behavioral characteristics may include stereotypic movements (e.g., hand-flapping) and atypical social development, particularly shyness and limited eye contact. Some individuals with the fragile X syndrome also meet the diagnostic criteria for autism. Most females experience symptoms to a lesser degree because of their second X-chromosome, however they can develop just as severe symptoms. While full mutation males tend to present with severe intellectual disability, the symptoms of full mutation females runs the gamut of minimally affected to severe intellectual disability, which may explain why females are underdiagnosed relative to males.”\n\nPam Winthrop said that herself, her husband, and Chris Benoit were struggling with the news when their sons were diagnosed of the disease at the same time. Pam and her spouse talked to Chris frequently about the ordeal all three were going through. The couple tried to convince Chris to come out about his son having the disease. They felt that with his celebrity status, he could be the face for raising money to help fight the disease. However, Chris wanted to keep the disease that Daniel had a secret. Close friends, and even family, of the Benoits’ did not know that Daniel suffered from this disease. When hearing about the symptoms, they were consistent with Daniel.\n\nThe WWE also jumped on the Fragile X angle. WWE Attorney Jerry McDevitt said, “In the days before WWE Superstar Chris Benoit murdered his wife and child and then ultimately hung himself, the two argued over Chris’ work schedule. Nancy wanted Chris to stay home more to help take care of their mentally retarded 7-year-old son. I think it’s fair to say that the subject of caring for that child was part of what made their relationship complicated and difficult, and its something they were both constantly struggling with. We do know it was a source of stress and consternation.” McDevitt added that the WWE learned from the couple’s friends and relatives that Chris and Nancy were struggling with where to send the boy to school since he had recently finished kindergarten. He also said that Nancy didn’t want Chris to quit wrestling, but she “wanted him to be at home more to care for the kid. She’d say she can’t take care of him by herself when he was on the road.”\n\nThe “Wrestling Observer Newsletter” has quoted Fragile X expert, Dr. Edward Tanza (whose child was also diagnosed with the disease) as saying, “It is very difficult to raise a child with Fragile X. For one thing, not many people know about it, so you are always trying to educate the teachers and other professionals that work with your child. There are not many support groups and you feel very alone. The behavior and hyperactivity wear you out. I wonder if he (Chris) felt what I felt, which is you worry all the time if your son is going to be able to live life and ever be happy, get a job, graduate school, fall in love, etc. I don’t know the situation he had at home with Nancy, nor is it my place to judge. However, I wonder if Daniel did have Fragile X, did Chris kill Daniel after Nancy because he knew Daniel couldn’t live on his own eventually, especially if Chris was in jail. I am having the hardest time with this because, as many parents would, especially when your child has special needs, you would do anything for them and not harm them. I also pray that no matter how wrong and horrible it was for Chris to do this to his son, I hope that he at least thought he was doing the right thing.”\n\nAccording to the Associated Press on July 3rd, there are now contradictory reports on whether or not Daniel suffered from Fragile X syndrome. “Fayette County prosecutor Scott Ballard said in a news release Tuesday that some of the boy’s medical records have been reviewed and they do not mention any pre-existing mental or physical impairment. Family members deny Daniel had the condition, and the child’s teachers also deny reports that he was physically undersized.” Ballad continued, “A source having access to certain amount of Daniel’s medical reports reviewed those reports, and they do not mention any pre-existing mental or physical impairment. Reports from Daniel’s educators likewise contradict the claims that Daniel was physically undersized. The educators report that Daniel graduated kindergarten and was prepared to enter the first grade on par with the other students.”\n\nAtlanta-based lawyer Richard Decker, who represents Paul and Maureen Toffoloni (Nancy’s parents), told ESPN.com’s Elizabeth Merrill that they “babysat often for Daniel and noticed no medical issues. To them, he’s always been a normal, healthy, happy child with no signs of illness,” Decker said. “And that’s not from a distance. That’s from day-to-day contact.”\n\nThe article also mentions that “WWE spokesman Gary Davis said Tuesday that McDevitt had first heard Fragile X syndrome linked to the boy in a Canadian news report. McDevitt was ‘confident’ that the information was accurate after speaking with other WWE employees who knew Benoit, Davis said. But none of those employees specifically mentioned Fragile X, he said. “A lot of people got caught up in the idea that Daniel had Fragile X syndrome,” Davis said from the company’s headquarters in Stamford, Conn. “We were just as caught up as everyone else.” The WWE has no information to contradict Ballard’s statement, Davis said. “I think we have to go with what the district attorney has said as being the best, up-to-date information available right now,” Davis said.\n\nTo contradict D.A. Ballard’s findings, the article quoted Holly McFague, a neighbor of the Benoits, saying that Nancy Benoit spoke with her about Daniel’s medical problems in the year before she died. “I know that there were some problems, problems and issues that she said the son had,” said George Regan, the owner of a Boston public relations firm who is working as McFague’s spokesman. Regan could not say exactly what problems Nancy Benoit referred to.\n\nThe “Edmonton Sun” newspaper had an article in which Dr. John Bradford, the associate chief of the integrated forensic program for the Royal Ottawa Health Care Group discussed murder/suicide cases. In the article, he stated, “Murder-suicides that wipe out a family are most often carried out by the father. The most usual cause is a major depression, normally a severe one with psychotic features. They sort of start to think, in this psychotic thinking, that the whole family would be better off in heaven … that, ‘This is a horrible place, I think we’d all be better off dead.’ Psychiatrists commonly refer to murder-suicide as ‘extended suicide,’ when the killer decides life is not worth living.”\n\nWhen talking about the link of steroids in this case, Bradford said, “Steroid use carries ‘a lot of baggage’ when it comes to psychiatric health because the drugs alter brain and body chemistry. People that abuse steroids carry with them an increased risk of rage and rage attacks. There’s also an increased risk of depression, so it’s kind of a double whammy. Dads who decide to kill their kids often turn to methods such as smothering because they don’t want the children to suffer.”\n\nDave Meltzer of the “Wrestling Observer” points out “when reading articles this past week about fathers who kill the entire family, the descriptions of the type of person were scarily similar to Chris. They are usually hard-driven people who are great at their job, with a constant fear of failure, and who show an overwhelming love for their child and place a high value on their family. They are usually older than Chris was, make a good amount of money and are seen by neighbors as a good husband and devoted father. However, they are usually people who at times need to be very isolated and reserved. They are usually dedicated to their family, and talk heavily to others about them, but have few close friends or a support system. They are usually suffering from prolonged frustration and feelings of anxiety, and are usually coming off suffering a catastrophic loss. Those are usually a financial loss or a relationship loss. The man often has a stormy relationship with his wife.”\n\nTHE AFTERMATH: THE FAMILIES OF THE DECEASED:\n\nIn an ESPN article, Michael Benoit, Chris’ father, said that his family is shocked and in disbelief over the slayings. “We have no understanding of why it happened. We need some time to gather our thoughts and wait and see. There’s still more information that’s going to come out from toxicology tests that will give us some understanding of why this happened.”\n\nMichael Benoit, said the test results, which could take several weeks to be completed, “could give us closure.” He said his son had seemed fine when they spoke on Father’s Day, and had even said he regretted having to work instead of spending the day with his family. “That really wouldn’t give you an indication of someone who would do what he did a week later.”\n\nIn an interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Michael Benoit said “It’s a horrible, horrible event that’s happened. We have no understanding why it happened. It’s going to take us a long time to come to terms with this, and we may never come to terms with it. Our thoughts and prayers are with Nancy’s family. We’re very concerned about the long-term affects on her family. There are no words to describe the loss we feel.”\n\nIn an article that appeared on ESPN’s website, Richard Decker, the lawyers for Nancy’s parents said, “There has been a lot of speculation and rumor in the media that is doing nothing to advance the investigation and doing everything to cause the Toffolonis intense pain.” He continued, “The Toffolonis are grieving and trying to keep a low profile.” They have asked Decker to investigate a possible civil lawsuit, and he is waiting for the investigation to conclude. “We’re trying to stay out of their way right now,” Decker said. “In the meantime, Maureen and Paul and Sandra (Nancy’s sister) have asked me to ask members of the media and public to remember that this is an investigation of the death of their daughter and only grandchild. And even though Chris and Nancy led public lives, the family, specifically Daniel, did not lead a public life.”\n\nThe Atlanta-Journal Constitution is reporting that Chris Benoit will be receiving a private burial in Canada separate from the services for his wife Nancy and son Daniel. The burial plans for Nancy and Daniel is to have them cremated in Georgia, while later services will take place on Dayton Beach, FL where Nancy’s family resides.\n\nDR PHIL ASTIN: When the initial reports surfaced that the Benoit deaths were being ruled a double murder/suicide, there were quotes from Chris’ personal physician speaking about the final time he saw Chris, which was earlier in the day before Nancy’s murder. At the time, the doctor seemed like a small side note in linking the time frame of Chris’ shocking weekend. However, when various prescription medication, and steroids were found in the Benoit home. The police were set on a path to find out about Benoit’s doctor/friend. According to the “Wrestling Observer Newsletter,” Dr. Phil Astin had “the doctor to stars” reputation in the Atlanta area. Last week his offices were raided twice, as well as his mother’s house.\n\nOn Monday, July 2nd, he turned himself into the police after he was indicted on seven charges related to improperly dispensing medications to two patients with the initials O.G. and M.J. He will have to post a $125,000 bond and then will be under house arrest. In addition, the Doctor must surrender his medical license.\n\nAccording to an ESPN report, a DEA agent in an affidavit stated that between May 2006 and May 2007, Chris was prescribed a 10-month supply of anabolic steroids every three to four weeks. Dr. Astin has not been charged with supplying steroids to Benoit but the filing of more charges against Dr. Astin is still possible.\n\nAccording to ABCNEWS.COM, “The affidavit also said Astin supplied various controlled substances, including injectable anabolic steroids, that were found in Benoit’s home.” ABC News is also reporting, that “prosecutors allege in the seven-count indictment that Astin dispensed drugs including Percocet, Xanax, Lorcet and Vicoprofen between April 2004 and September 2005. Astin had written prescriptions for about 1 million doses of controlled substances over the past two years, including ‘significant quantities’ of injectable testosterone cypionate, an anabolic steroid, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint by Drug Enforcement Administration agent Anissa Jones said the amount of prescriptions was ‘excessive’ for a medical office with a sole practitioner in a rural area like Carrollton, about 40 miles west of Atlanta.”\n\nWHAT CAUSED THE DOUBLE MURDER/SUICIDE: The cause of what led to Chris Benoit snapping will never led to a concrete answer. Could it be steroids, pain killers, or mind altering drugs that Chris was using? Maybe it was the stress he was under to maintain his spot and salary in the WWE. It could have even been his rocky relationship with his wife, and possible the Fragile X disease that his son Daniel may have had. This route that Chris Benoit chose could be the result of all of the deaths he had to deal with from his close friends dying way too soon. Perhaps, he developed at mental condition that led to his paranoid delusions. One of these conditions was probably not what caused Chris Benoit to commit the double murders, and then kill himself. More then likely, it was a combination of all of these effects that built up over time, and snowballed into that tragic weekend in late June. The toxicology reports will only be able to reveal so much when they become available in a few weeks. Unfortunately, we will never know the true story of why this happened. That piece of the puzzle was taken away from us the moment Chris Benoit took his final breath of life.\n\nNULL"
