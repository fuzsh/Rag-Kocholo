        "text": "This is just a sudden shock to read.. Being a big fan im extremly devestated to hear this one as he was such a great person to the WWE\n\nChris Benoit and family found dead: reports\n\nCanadian Crippler' once lived in Edmonton, Sherwood Park\n\nProfessional wrestler Chris Benoit was found dead along with his family this afternoon in his Atlanta home, according to published reports.\n\nThe Atlanta-Journal Constitution is reporting authorities confirmed that Benoit, 40, his wife, Nancy, and their 7-year-old son were found dead at the home on Quarters and Redwine roads in Fayetteville.\n\nThe Montreal-born Benoit, who moved to Edmonton when he was 12 years old, lived in Sherwood Park as recently as May 2000.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment issued a release over Benoit's death.\n\n\"World Wrestling Entertainment is deeply saddened to report that today Chris Benoit and his family were found dead in their home,\" the statement reads.\n\n\"There are no further details at this time, other than the Benoit family residence is currently being investigated by local authorities.\n\nWWE spokeswoman Cheryl Kong in Toronto said Monday night's \"Raw\" TV program would serve as a tribute to Benoit and his family.\n\nBenoit was a former world heavyweight champion, Intercontinental champion and held several tag-team titles over his career. Benoit was scheduled to wrestle at the Vengeance pay-per-view Sunday night in Houston, but was replaced at the last minute because of what announcer Jim Ross called \"personal reasons.\"\n\nUPDATE:\n\nPolice investigating homicide after 'Canadian Crippler' and famliy found dead\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ga. — Canadian pro wrestler Chris Benoit, his wife and son were found dead Monday and police said they were investigating the deaths as a homicide.\n\nLt. Tommy Pope of the Fayette County Sheriff’s Department in suburban Atlanta said the three were found at their home about 2:30 p.m., but refused to release details.\n\nPope said results of autopsies on Benoit, his wife Nancy, and seven-year-old son Daniel were expected Tuesday.\n\nThe WWE cancelled its live “Raw” wrestling card Monday night in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nCanadian television network The Score aired a three-hour tribute to Benoit in place of the scheduled telecast.\n\n“I am deeply saddened over the loss of Chris Benoit,” WWE Canada president Carl DeMarco said on the WWE website. “My heartfelt thoughts and sympathy go out to his parents and family. My relationship with Chris has extended many years and I consider him a great friend. Chris was always first-class — warm, friendly, caring and professional . . . one of the best in our business.”\n\nThe Montreal-born Benoit, 40, who moved to Edmonton when he was 12 years old, lived in Sherwood Park as recently as May 2000.\n\nHe began his career in 1985 after training with Stu Hart and family in Calgary.\n\nHe competed for Hart’s Stampede Wrestling promotion and later wrestled in Japan and for the National Wrestling Alliance, WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling. He joined WWE in 2000.\n\nHe maintained a home in the Atlanta area from the time he wrestled for the defunct World Championship Wrestling.\n\nHe was scheduled to wrestle at the Vengeance pay-per-view Sunday night in Houston, but was replaced at the last minute because of what announcer Jim Ross called “personal reasons.”\n\nBenoit, a five-foot-11, 220-pounder, was often described as a rabid wolverine in the ring.\n\n“The Canadian Crippler” had a chiselled physique and was known for his superior technical skills.\n\nThe “Crippler Crossface” was one of his signature moves, along with a flying headbutt from the top rope and triple German suplex.\n\n“Chris was beloved among his fellow superstars, and was a favourite among WWE fans for his unbelievable athleticism and wrestling ability,” the WWE said on its website.\n\n“He always took great pride in his performance, and always showed respect for the business he loved, for his peers and towards his fans. This is a terrible tragedy and an unbearable loss.”\n\nBenoit held several titles over his career but realized his dream at Wrestlemania 20 in 2004, defeating Shawn Michaels and champion Triple H in a triple threat match at Madison Square Garden to win the WWE world heavyweight championship for the first time.\n\n“He was a man of few words, but his passion for the sports-entertainment business was almost unrivaled,” the WWE said.\n\n“Whether loved or hated, Benoit was always well-respected by our fans and his peers for his in-ring ability, his trademark toothless grin and his no-nonsense attitude. “The sports-entertainment world has truly suffered a loss with his passing, as one of the all-time greats was taken well before his time.”\n\nThis is crazy! So many WWE wrestlers are dying! Last year was Eddy Guerrero and this year Chris Benoit! Something must be up. Either wrestlers are all on drugs or they have so much presure on them and there going nuts.\n\nI wouldnt say this is drugs or anything like that.\n\nThis is aparently being treated as a homicide. Usually the wwe doesnt dedicate a 3 hour live show to a wrestler that has passed on but they are tonight. Even Vince McMahon who was supposedly dead himself has spoken. Stephanie McMahon mentiooned her being married to Triple H... There being personal.\n\nMy heart goes out to all the wrestlers dealing with this. You can see the pain on tv right now from these guys. they are heart broken. Chris Benoit is what wrestling is all about. The Sport. He will always be the best wrestler there ever was.\n\nSorry but not only am i a big fan of wrestling, I'm a diehard fan of benoit and even got to meet him and his wife \"Woman\" as she was known in the wrestling world when she managed, and i could say he is the most personable person ive ever met. These guys that put there bodies on the line are just regular people too and they mean a lot to many of us who are fans. I find it frustrating when people think its drugs or alcohol or stuff all the time.\n\nEddie gurero worked hard to fix his drug past but the drugs finally caught up. others have had heart attacks due to them putting there lives on the lines to entertain us. I have never respected any athlete more than i have a wrestler.\n\nFrom CBC.CA\n\nCanadian pro wrestler Chris Benoit, his wife, and son were found dead Monday and police said they were investigating the deaths as a murder-suicide.\n\nDet. Bo Turner told television station WAGA in Atlanta that the case was being treated as a murder-suicide, but said that couldn't be confirmed until evidence was examined by a crime lab.\n\nChris Benoit and his family were found dead Monday at their Atlanta-area home.\n\n(Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press) The station said that investigators believe the 40-year-old Benoit killed his wife, Nancy, and seven-year-old son, Daniel, over the weekend, then himself on Monday at their Fayetteville, Ga., home. A neighbour called police, and the bodies were found in three rooms.\n\nLead investigator Lt. Tommy Pope, of the Fayette County Sheriff's Department, told the Associated Press the deaths were being investigated as homicide, and that the causes of death awaited autopsy results on Tuesday. Pope said the bodies were discovered about 2:30 p.m., but refused to release details.\n\nThe house is in a secluded neighborhood set back more than 50 metres off a gravel road, surrounded by stacked stone wall and a double-iron gate.\n\nBenoit wrestled for World Wrestling Entertainment, which cancelled its live Raw wrestling card Monday night in Corpus Christi, Texas."
