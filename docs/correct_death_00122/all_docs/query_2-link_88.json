        "text": "One of Canada ‘s most famous wrestlers has apparently met with a tragic end that also claimed his wife and son.\n\nWWE superstar Chris Benoit, his wife Nancy and seven-year-old son Daniel were found dead in three seperate rooms of their Atlanta home Monday after the 40-year-old missed a Sunday night pay-per-view event. He had travelled home to Georgia for family reasons, but didn’t elaborate on what they may have been. Later Monday, local authorities announced they were treating the disovery as a possible murder-suicide, suggesting Benoit killed his wife and son over the weekend before taking his own life Monday..\n\nBenoit was born in Montreal and lived in Edmonton, and was widely considered to be one of the stronger technical wrestlers of all time.\n\nThe WWE scrapped Monday’s scheduled “Raw” event in favour of a three-hour tribute to the veteran of more than 20 years.\n\n“We at the WWE can only offer our condolences to the extended family of Chris Benoit,” said WWE executive Vince McMahon. “The only other thing we can do at this moment is pay tribute to Chris Benoit.”\n\nAutopsy results are expected Tuesday.\n\nPhoto courtesy Getty Images/Peter Kramer"
