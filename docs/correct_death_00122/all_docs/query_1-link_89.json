        "text": "It's in the local paper too so it looks like this is true...unlike the Vince McMahon drama.\n\nhttp://www.ajc.com/news/content/metro/fayette/stories/2007/06/25/0625benoit.html\n\nI met him when his career was just starting and he seemed like a very nice guy.\n\nHere's an updated story, in which the police say they are investigating it as a murder/suicide. They suspect Benoit killed his family over the weekend, and then killed himself today.\n\nYeah its being reported all over now. This is unbelievable, as I never thought he would be the type to do something like that.\n\nYeah, sometimes domestic violence perpetrators are guys that are well-liked by coworkers and are the type that people never suspect would do something like that. OJ being a case in point.\n\nVery sad story indeed. I turned on Monday Night Raw and was in shock..\n\nChris always gave 110 percent everytime he wrestled and was one of my favorites being smaller and he was always taking on guys much bigger than him.\n\nVery true. It's just that in a business of crooks and characters he seemed to be one who had his head on straight. That's why I'm shocked at this.\n\nHere is a report from wrestlingobserver.com\n\nSources in the Fayette County Police Department are now working under the theory that Chris Benoit killed Nancy on Saturday, son Daniel on Sunday, and then killed himself earlier today.\n\nBenoit was found dead in his weight room. Nancy was found dead in the lving room. Daniel was found dead in his bedroom, accordig t an unnamed source in the department.\n\nLt. Tommy Pope told ABC News \"the instruments of death were located on the scene,\" but didn't specify what those were or where they were found. Pope said the department was not actively searching for any suspects outside the house.\n\nWhile I haven't watched wrestling regulary since I was 20 or so, Chris Benoit was one of the few wrestlers I still had an interest in seeing. He was one of the best \"workers\" as they say. Hearing about the seven year old boy makes me sick, my son will be seven this year.\n\nI hate to be the \"wet blanket\" here but Benoit always struck me as a very intense competitor...perhaps a bit too intense. I saw that same intensity when Mike Tyson first burst onto the scene. It's generally that kind of intensity that might indicate depression of some sort. Just speculation, of course.\n\nEd\n\nUnlike Tyson though, it's hard to say how much of Benoit's apparent intensity was genuine, since like all pro wrestlers he was an actor playing a role. But yeah, obviously there was something deeply wrong with him, assuming the police theories are borne out by the investigation.\n\nor steroid use.....\n\nRIP Benoit Family."
