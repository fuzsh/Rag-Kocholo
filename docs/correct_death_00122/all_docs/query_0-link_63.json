Tommy Pope of the Fayette County Sheriff’s Department said the three were found at their home about 2:30 p.m., but refused to release details. Pope said results of autopsies on Benoit, his wife Nancy, and 7-year-old son Daniel were expected Tuesday. Benoit, 40, was a former world heavyweight champion, Intercontinental champion and held several tag-team titles over his career. (H/T – Yahoo!)\n\nThe wrestler and his wife were murdered, which is bad enough, but what piece of trash murders a seven-year old child? Hopefully, this scrote is found and brought to justice quickly.\n\nBenoit and his wife, Nancy at the arena.\n\nUPDATE: Murder-suicide???\n\n\n\nDetective Bo Turner told television station WAGA that the case was being treated as a murder-suicide, but said that couldn’t be confirmed until evidence was examined by a crime lab. The station said that investigators believe the 40-year-old Benoit killed his wife, Nancy, and 7-year-old son, Daniel, over the weekend, then himself on Monday. A neighbor called police, and the bodies were found in three rooms.\n\nSweet Jesus.\n\nRate this: Share this: Facebook\n\nMore\n\nEmail\n\nLike Loading... Related"
