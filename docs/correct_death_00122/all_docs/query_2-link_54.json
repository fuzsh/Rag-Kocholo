He grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, from where he was billed throughout the bulk of his career.

        "text": "Lost a tooth when he was pretending to wrestle with his dog as a kid. The dogs face hit him on the jaw, which knocked the tooth out. He never had a tooth inserted, because he though he would lose it again, when he started his wrestling-career.\n\nTrained by Stu Hart. Chris Benoit would work all week, then drive 185 miles south, from his Edmonton home, to Calgary, to the Hart House. After 6 months of the grueling training, Benoit made his debut for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling.\n\nWrestled in Japan under a mask as The Pegasus Kid. After losing to Jushin \"Thunder\" Liger in a match, he unmasked himself as part of the stipulation. Shortly afterwards, he called himself Wild Pegasus.\n\nWhen his family's bodies were found, WWE canceled the Mr. McMahon tribute show and his entire death story-line, refunded tickets, and had a tribute show for Chris Benoit. Many matches of Benoit from WWE and WCW were shown while his colleagues praised him. The next night on ECW, Vince McMahon stated that with newfound evidence, there would no longer be any mention of Chris Benoit's name again. Countries that get weekly delays were presented with a feature of John Cena's best matches. On the WWE Network, Benoit's tribute show is the sole episode of RAW that is not available.\n\nIn June 2001, he suffered a severe neck injury that kept him out for exactly a year. He returned on a Raw in his hometown of Edmonton, and joined forces with Eddie Guerrero and Ric Flair.\n\nThe second man to enter #1 and win the Royal Rumble (Shawn Michaels was the first), but now holds the record for being in a Rumble match the longest (over 61 minutes, former record holder was Ric Flair with almost one hour, while Shawn Michaels Rumble win was 48:37)\n\nHe made sports entertainment history at the 2005 SummerSlam, when he defeated Orlando Jordan for the US Championship in just 25.5 seconds - the fastest US Championship victory in the celebrated 20 year history of the prestigious title.\n\nSince then, Benoit has feuded with A-Train, Eddie Guerrero, and A-Train again. He is now on the brink of a big feud with Brock Lesnar, the current WWE Champion, and made him tap out to the Crippler Crossface at Survivor Series 2003, and again on a preceeding SmackDown.\n\nDefeated Triple H at Vengeance 2004 (with help from Eugene) to retain the World Heavyweight Championship and defeated Triple H once again in a 60- Minute Iron Man Match on RAW (7/26/2004) with the help of Eugene once again. (July 2004)\n\nHe 'won' the WWF Title on two occasions, once at Fully Loaded and once at Unforgiven 2000. However, both times the decision was over-ruled, and he is still yet to win the WWF/E title officially."
