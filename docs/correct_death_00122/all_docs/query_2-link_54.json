    "text": "When his family's bodies were found, WWE canceled the Mr. McMahon tribute show and his entire death story-line, refunded tickets, and had a tribute show for Chris Benoit. Many matches of Benoit from WWE and WCW were shown while his colleagues praised him. The next night on ECW, Vince McMahon stated that with newfound evidence, there would no longer be any mention of Chris Benoit's name again. Countries that get weekly delays were presented with a feature of John Cena's best matches. On the WWE Network, Benoit's tribute show is the sole episode of RAW that is not available."
