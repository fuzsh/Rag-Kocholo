    "text": "ATLANTA, June 26 — Chris Benoit, a professional wrestler known as the Canadian Crippler, killed his wife and 7-year-old son in their house in Fayetteville, Ga., over the weekend before taking his own life by hanging himself with a cable from a weight machine in his home gym, investigators said Tuesday.\n\nThe authorities found the bodies on Monday afternoon as they were checking on the family at the request of Mr. Benoit’s employer, World Wrestling Entertainment, said Lt. Tommy Pope, lead investigator with the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nOn its Web site, the wrestling organization said it called the authorities after receiving several “curious” text messages from Mr. Benoit early Sunday morning.\n\nInvestigators searching the house found Nancy E. Benoit, 43, in an upstairs family room with her hands and feet bound and blood under her head, said Scott Ballard, the Fayette County district attorney."
