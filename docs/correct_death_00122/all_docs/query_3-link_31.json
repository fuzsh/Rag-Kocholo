        "text": "Investigators had not yet discovered the bodies of pro wrestler Chris Benoit, his wife and their 7-year-old son when someone altered Benoit's Wikipedia entry to mention his wife's death, authorities said.\n\nAn anonymous user with the same IP address as the person who made the edits confessed early Friday on an online discussion page attached to the Web site, saying the changes were based on rumors and speculation, not hard evidence.\n\nThe authenticity of the posting could not immediately be confirmed.\n\n\"I just can't believe what I wrote was actually the case, I've remained stunned and saddened over it,\" the user wrote.\n\nAccording to Wikinews, an online news source connected to Wikipedia, the Internet protocol address of the individual is identical to that of the user who edited Benoit's profile early Monday morning. An IP address is a unique series of numbers carried by every machine connected to the Internet.\n\nBenoit's page on Wikipedia, a reference site that allows users to add and edit information, was updated at 12:01 a.m. Monday, about 14 hours before authorities say the bodies were found. The reason he missed a match Saturday night was \"stemming from the death of his wife Nancy,\" it said.\n\nWikipedia confirmed the authenticity of the time stamp and said entry was made by someone using an IP address registered in Stamford, Conn., where World Wrestling Entertainment is based. The anonymous user acknowledged being from Stamford, but claimed no connection to WWE.\n\nWikipedia referred all further questions to authorities investigating the deaths. Messages left for Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard were not immediately returned Friday.\n\nBenoit strangled his wife and son during the weekend, placing Bibles next to their bodies, before hanging himself on the cable of a weight-machine in his home, authorities said. No motive was offered for the killings.\n\nAlso Thursday, federal drug agents said they had raided the west Georgia office of a doctor who prescribed testosterone to Benoit.\n\nThe raid at Dr. Phil Astin's office in Carrollton began Wednesday night and concluded early Thursday, said agent Chuvalo Truesdell, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration. No arrests were made.\n\nHours before the raid, Astin told The Associated Press he had treated Benoit for low testosterone levels, which he said likely originated from previous steroid use.\n\nAmong other things, investigators were looking for Benoit's medical records to see whether he had been prescribed steroids and, if so, whether that prescription was appropriate, according to a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity because records in the case remain sealed.\n\nAstin prescribed testosterone for Benoit, a longtime friend, in the past but would not say what, if any, medications he prescribed when Benoit visited his office on June 22.\n\nWWE attorney Jerry McDevitt said that to his knowledge, no one at the WWE knew Nancy Benoit was dead before her body was found Monday afternoon. Text messages released by officials show that messages from Chris Benoit's cell phone were being sent to co-workers a few hours after the Wikipedia posting.\n\nWWE employees are given WWE e-mail addresses, McDevitt said, though he did not know whether Chris Benoit had one.\n\n\"I have no idea who posted this,\" McDevitt said. \"It's at least possible Chris may have sent some other text message to someone that we're unaware of. We don't know if he did. The phone is in the possession of authorities.\"\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the Wikipedia page about Benoit carried a note stating that editing by unregistered or newly registered users was disabled until July 8 because of vandalism.\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Pro Wrester Chris Benoit's father said Friday he can't come to grips with the idea that his son killed his wife and boy and then himself because everything seemed fine when the two spoke a week earlier on Father's Day. Michael Benoit told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from his home in Alberta, Canada, that his family is shocked and in disbelief over the killings. \"His comment to me on Father's Day: 'Where am I today?' He said, 'Unfortunately I'm on my way to work, dad. I would like to have spent the day with my family.' That really wouldn't give you an indication of someone who would do what he did a week later,\" the father said. Eight days after Father's Day, on June 25, police discovered the bodies of Chris Benoit, his wife and 7-year-old-son in their suburban Atlanta home. Police said Benoit strangled his wife and son during the weekend, placing Bibles next to their bodies, before hanging himself on the cable of a weight-machine in his home. No motive was offered for the killings. Michael Benoit said his family has been overwhelmed by the media attention the case has drawn. \"We have no understanding of why it happened,\" he said of the killings. \"We need some time to gather our thoughts and wait and see. There's still more information that's going to come out from toxicology tests that will give us some understanding of why this happened.\" Benoit said the test results, which could take several weeks to be completed, \"could give us closure.\" \"We really don't understand how this could have happened, why he did what he did,\" the father said. Anabolic steroids were found in Chris Benoit's home in Fayetteville, leading officials to wonder whether the drugs played a role in the killings. Some experts believe steroids cause paranoia, depression and violent outbursts known as \"roid rage.\"\n\nBenoit's dad: Wrestler gave no hint of problems"
