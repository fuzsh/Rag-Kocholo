        "text": "WWE is sad to report that Chris Benoit and his family have been found dead in their home. Police are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the deaths. Tonight's Raw will be a tribute to Chris and his family.\n\nWe are still awaiting further details, but PWInsider.com is extremely saddened to report that former WWE and WCW World champion Chris Benoit and his wife, former WCW and ECW personality Nancy \"Woman\" Benoit were both found dead today in Atlanta, Georgia. Obviously this will be a huge developing story in the days to come but at this point, we'd like to express our deepest condolences to the Benoits' family, friends, and fans at this time.\n\nA meeting is currently ongoing at WWE TV and it is expected that tonight's three hour Raw will now be dedicated to Benoit's memory.\n\n6:09 Update: WWE.com issued the following statement this afternoon: \"WWE is sad to report that Chris Benoit and his family have been found dead in their home. Police are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the deaths. Tonight's Raw will be a tribute to Chris and his family.\"\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment is deeply saddened to report that today Chris Benoit, wife Nancy and son Daniel were found dead in their home. There are no further details at this time, other than the Benoit family residence is currently being investigated by local authorities.\n\nTonight’s Raw on USA Network will serve as a tribute to Chris Benoit and his family. WWE extends its sincerest thoughts and prayers to the Benoit family’s relatives and loved ones in this time of tragedy\n\nJust thought I'd let you folks know, I think theres a few wrestling fans around. For real wrestling fans Chris was a great, and one of the best ever. It deeply sadens me and my thoughts are with the rest of his family.\n\n+44\n\nFrom WWE.COM\n\nBenoit's death part of a double murder-suicide\n\nWritten: June 25, 2007According to lead investigator Lt. Tommy Pope, of the Fayette County Sheriff’s Department, in Fayetteville, Ga., the deaths of WWE Superstar Chris Benoit, wife Nancy and son Daniel were the result of a double murder-suicide, WWE.com has learned.\n\nBenoit failed to appear both at Saturday’s live event in Beaumont, Tx., and WWE’s Vengeance: Night of Champions in Houston Sunday night, after informing WWE of a family emergency. Several curious text messages sent by Benoit early Sunday morning prompted concerned friends to alert Richard Hering, VP of Government Relations for WWE, Inc. Hering, in turn, spoke with Fayette County sheriffs Monday, and requested that they respond to the Benoit residence to check on him and his family.\n\nAuthorities representing the Sheriff’s Department initially had a difficult time entering Benoit’s new Fayetteville home Monday afternoon, which had been guarded by two large German Shepherds roaming freely around the property. Once authorities entered the residence, they quickly located the bodies of Benoit, Nancy and Daniel. WWE was notified of the discovery at approximately 4 p.m.\n\nAt 10 p.m. Monday night, Lt. Pope held a press conference in conjunction with Scott Ballard, the district attorney for Fayette County. The press conference officially ruled authorities’ findings as a double murder-suicide from within the home.\n\nWAGA, a FOX-owned and operated television station in Atlanta, reported that investigators believe Benoit killed his wife and 7-year-old son over the weekend, then himself on Monday.\n\nThe three bodies have been received by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s crime lab, in Decatur, Ga., where autopsies will be performed Tuesday morning. Toxicology reports will not become available for at least two weeks.\n\nWWE.com has further information relating to both the investigation and the cause of death, but the Fayette County Sheriff’s Department has requested that WWE.com not release any additional details at this time\n\nJohnnyG said:\n\nThe mournings were posted before it was common 'knowledge' that he was in fact the killer, I'm sure no-one in here will have the same feelings once they realise this as they did when they posted.\n\nFair enough for those who didn't know, but there are posters in the other thread posting at 11:24 with lines like:\n\n\"Lets hope that as horrible as it is what has happened that it doesn't overshadow an outstanding career\"\n\nIs this guy for real?"
