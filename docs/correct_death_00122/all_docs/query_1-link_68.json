        "text": "The Spell is casted !\n\nIt all started when a young boy found himself living with a shaman , sheltering very deep in the forest , the shaman told him he has no parents as they were mysteriously killed when he was just a child and he's The one taking care of him since then. The shaman, whose name was Abelardo, took Karvani under his wing and raised him as his own. As Karvani grew older, Abelardo began to cast a spell on him every day, telling him that his purpose in life was to seek revenge on a rich woman and queen of their village named Sataroni. The shaman told Karvani that Sataroni was responsible for the death of his family, including his parents and younger sister. He painted a vivid picture of the Queen as a cruel and heartless ruler who had brought nothing but misery and suffering to their village. Abelardo is like a savior to karvani, teaching him the art of martial arts and instilling in him a deep sense of anger and hatred towards the Queen. Karvani grew up filled with rage and a burning desire to avenge his family's deaths. He trained tirelessly with the shaman, becoming a skilled fighter with incredible strength and agility. One fateful day, Sataroni visited the market in the village, and Karvani spotted her from afar. His eyes filled with rage and determination as he made his way towards the Queen's palace, intent on carrying out his revenge. However, the path to the Queen was not an easy one, as he faced off against a horde of guards who stood in his way. Despite being badly wounded, kavarni fought valiantly, taking down each guard with precision and skill. Finally, kavarni reached the Queen's inner chamber, where Sataroni stood surrounded by her guards. As he prepared to strike, the Queen's voice stopped him in his tracks. My son please wait and listen , promising that she had never harmed his family. Confused and conflicted, Kavarni hesitated, unsure of what to do. The Queen approached Karvani ,tears rolling down her face, and showed him a series of old photographs. To his astonishment, he saw images of himself as a young child, smiling and laughing with his family and the Queen. Memories flooded back to him, and he realized that the shaman had been lying to him all along. Sataroni revealed the truth to Karvani ,that the shaman, Abelardo, was actually a criminal who had led a group of assassins against her in a failed attempt on her life. She explained that on the day of the attack, Karvani had been given a gun to shoot the shaman as punishment, but had instead fired into the sky in a moment of panic and chaos. The Queen shared with Karvani that she had always cared for him and his family, and that she had been searching for him ever since that fateful day. and that it was the shaman who had manipulated him into seeking revenge. Overcome with emotion and confusion, Karvani embraced the Queen and his long-lost sister in a tearful reunion. The truth had set him free from the lies and manipulation of the shaman, and he finally understood the depths of his deception. Weeks later, Abelardo was apprehended once again, prince Karvani stood by Queen Sataroni's side as the shaman was brought to justice, finally receiving the bullet reward from the Prince. As Karvani settled back into village life, he learned the true meaning of family, forgiveness, and the power of love over hate. The young man who had once been consumed by revenge had now found peace in his heart. And though the scars of his past remained, Karvani knew that he had finally found his true purpose , to live a life of love, forgiveness and mercy ."
