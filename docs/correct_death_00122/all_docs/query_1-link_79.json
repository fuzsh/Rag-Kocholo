    "text": "Benoit's death part of a double murder-suicide\n\nWritten: June 25, 2007\n\n\n\nAccording to lead investigator Lt. Tommy Pope, of the Fayette County Sheriffs Department, in Fayetteville, Ga., the deaths of WWE Superstar Chris Benoit, wife Nancy and son Daniel were the result of a double murder-suicide, WWE.com has learned.\n\n\n\nBenoit failed to appear both at Saturdays live event in Beaumont, Tx., and WWEs Vengeance: Night of Champions in Houston Sunday night, after informing WWE of a family emergency. Several curious text messages sent by Benoit early Sunday morning prompted concerned friends to alert Richard Hering, VP of Government Relations for WWE, Inc. Hering, in turn, spoke with Fayette County sheriffs Monday, and requested that they respond to the Benoit residence to check on him and his family.\n\n\n\nAuthorities representing the Sheriffs Department initially had a difficult time entering Benoits new Fayetteville home Monday afternoon, which had been guarded by two large German Shepherds roaming freely around the property. Once authorities entered the residence, they quickly located the bodies of Benoit, Nancy and Daniel. WWE was notified of the discovery at approximately 4 p.m.\n\n\n\nAt 10 p.m. Monday night, Lt. Pope held a press conference in conjunction with Scott Ballard, the district attorney for Fayette County. The press conference officially ruled authorities findings as a double murder-suicide from within the home.\n\n\n\nWAGA, a FOX-owned and operated television station in Atlanta, reported that investigators believe Benoit killed his wife and 7-year-old son over the weekend, then himself on Monday.\n\n\n\nThe three bodies have been received by the Georgia Bureau of Investigations crime lab, in Decatur, Ga., where autopsies will be performed Tuesday morning. Toxicology reports will not become available for at least two weeks.\n\n\n\nWWE.com has further information relating to both the investigation and the cause of death, but the Fayette County Sheriffs Department has requested that WWE.com not release any additional details at this time."
