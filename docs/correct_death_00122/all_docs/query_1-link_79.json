        "text": "Why is it so hard to believe people don't want to jump to conclusions? Maybe there's something sinister some o f you can gloat about years from now about how you were the first one to pick up on it with your Sherlock Holmes' intuition and amazing ability to discard the scientific method, but for the rest of us we're waiting until someone can definitively say \"this is what happened.\" It won't change the tragic nature nor is it proving anyone to be naive. It's just not right to jump to conclusions and put the survivors through unneeded turmoil. Simple as that.\n\nThe point is not to gloat about it. Its just that if Benoit is proven to have done it, people will still deny it or say we can \"truly never know\" and hang on to that. The writing is on the wall though. You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out. You don't even have to be Watson.\n\nWell, that's true. I used to think OJ was innocent, but I began and still believe that he didn't do it in a physical sense, but that he knows who killed Nicole and Ron.\n\nBut again, as I said, it's disrespectful with some of things that have been said regarding Benoit the wrestler. If it turns out that he did do the unthinkable then I'll admit that I was wrong, but I'm not going to deny his talent or ignore his accomplishments.\n\nThere are several people who were close to him and knew him personally. Eddie(RIP), Jericho, Malenko, Chavo, Bret Hart, Raven, Diamond Dallas Page, Edge, John Cena, Triple H, Stephanie McMahon, Rey Mysterio, Angle, and a host of others who knew this man personally. I believe if there was something odd or dangerous about him they would've noticed it.\n\nI'm not going to disrespect the man's legacy as a wrestler. I'll wait until something 100% is proven, until then we all should do the same. Those who are calling him a murderer, a monster, and so forth will be eating some serious crow if it's proven he didn't do it.\n\ni hope you mean as an actor.. and not an athelete... because you do know wrestling is scripted right? only thing they earn is fandom... only athletic thing he earned was muscles\n\nExactly as some of you say.\n\nTo me it's just disrespectful to call the man a monster and murderer before he's even in the ground without the police giving a definitive answer on what happened.\n\nDid he? Maybe. I still think he deserves the benefit of the doubt until the police say. It's not about denial, its about respecting someone who's dead, and for all we know could have been a victim himself.\n\nIt's sad that innocent until proven guilty means nothing anymore, and tragic deaths are treated like an episode of CSI to figure out. I'm sure his grieving friends and family don't want to see statements like \"Chris Benoit is a monster!\" while their grieving over his death.\n\nYES!! IF Benoit is proven to have done it, I will no longer think of him as Benoit the wrestler, he is Benoit the monster. I don't care what he did for a living, he killed his own family. Thats like saying Ted Bundy was a good clown and entertained lots of people. Screw what he did for a living, the guys a monster. Benoit is no different if its proven he killed his family.\n\nExactly.\n\nI would wait with all the Benoit tribute avatar/signatures changes here on the hype guys...\n\nThis guy may turn out to be just another run of the mill pathetic selfish killer, nothing more.\n\nhttp://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/nation/4919896.html\n\nIf indeed this turns out to be a murder-suicide by Benoit, I don't care how many matches he won, how many titles he held, or fans he won over, he's just another killer. imo\n\nexactly right. if people respect a man who killed his wife and kids and then taking his own life (when he at least could have spared his family). Then those people have severe issues... esp when his \"talent\" is all an act\n\ni hope you mean as an actor.. and not an athelete... because you do know wrestling is scripted right? only thing they earn is fandom... only athletic thing he earned was muscles\n\nIt's scripted who wins, but they still do the moves, tho they don't do it with the intention to hurt of course (punches are held back of course). I can gaurantee a wrestler doing a diving headbutt from a 30ft. high cage doesn't feel good. Most wrestlers wreck their bodies entertaining fans, and are lucky to walk without feeling pain on every step when they get older. That's what fans respect, a wrestler giving his all night in and out, and giving to the fans what the fans give back in respect.\n\nExactly as some of you say.\n\nTo me it's just disrespectful to call the man a monster and murderer before he's even in the ground without the police giving a definitive answer on what happened.\n\nDid he? Maybe. I still think he deserves the benefit of the doubt until the police say. It's not about denial, its about respecting someone who's dead, and for all we know could have been a victim himself.\n\nIt's sad that innocent until proven guilty means nothing anymore, and tragic deaths are treated like an episode of CSI to figure out. I'm sure his grieving friends and family don't want to see statements like \"Chris Benoit is a monster!\" while their grieving over his death.\n\nwell when there's suspission (im tired and can't type tonight), \"innocent until proven guilty\" easily becomes \"guilty till proven innocent\" yes... it's wrong and i feel bad for the person who is innocent when blamed, but at the same time.. you can't deny facts or gut feelings. A good example is what cops and detectives will do when someone is taken into custody. no matter what the evidence is, as long as one is taken in for questioning, they will be treated as if guilty.\n\nexactly right. if people respect a man who killed his wife and kids and then taking his own life (when he at least could have spared his family). Then those people have severe issues... esp when his \"talent\" is all an act\n\nI understand you may hate wrestling, but he does have athletic talent. Benoit can really move in the ring, and displays more athletic talent in a match, scripted and all, than sports like football on any given night. Wrestlers do flips, many were amatuer wrestlers, one was a gold medalist for crying out loud. If they didn't have athletic talent, WWE wouldn't put them on the air because they wouldn't be able to do 450 splashes and other athletically demanding moves.\n\nhttp://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/superstars/chrisbenoit/articles/benoitupdate\n\nBenoit's death part of a double murder-suicide\n\nWritten: June 25, 2007\n\nAccording to lead investigator Lt. Tommy Pope, of the Fayette County Sheriffs Department, in Fayetteville, Ga., the deaths of WWE Superstar Chris Benoit, wife Nancy and son Daniel were the result of a double murder-suicide, WWE.com has learned.\n\nBenoit failed to appear both at Saturdays live event in Beaumont, Tx., and WWEs Vengeance: Night of Champions in Houston Sunday night, after informing WWE of a family emergency. Several curious text messages sent by Benoit early Sunday morning prompted concerned friends to alert Richard Hering, VP of Government Relations for WWE, Inc. Hering, in turn, spoke with Fayette County sheriffs Monday, and requested that they respond to the Benoit residence to check on him and his family.\n\nAuthorities representing the Sheriffs Department initially had a difficult time entering Benoits new Fayetteville home Monday afternoon, which had been guarded by two large German Shepherds roaming freely around the property. Once authorities entered the residence, they quickly located the bodies of Benoit, Nancy and Daniel. WWE was notified of the discovery at approximately 4 p.m.\n\nAt 10 p.m. Monday night, Lt. Pope held a press conference in conjunction with Scott Ballard, the district attorney for Fayette County. The press conference officially ruled authorities findings as a double murder-suicide from within the home.\n\nWAGA, a FOX-owned and operated television station in Atlanta, reported that investigators believe Benoit killed his wife and 7-year-old son over the weekend, then himself on Monday.\n\nThe three bodies have been received by the Georgia Bureau of Investigations crime lab, in Decatur, Ga., where autopsies will be performed Tuesday morning. Toxicology reports will not become available for at least two weeks.\n\nWWE.com has further information relating to both the investigation and the cause of death, but the Fayette County Sheriffs Department has requested that WWE.com not release any additional details at this time.\n\nregardless of the endings being predetermined, wrestling still takes a great deal of atheletecism, and Benoit was a great technical and amatuer wrestler as well.\n\nyes, doing flips and stuff as well as keeping your shape is fine, and i respect those in the buisness who do that. but someone to act like he actually WINS... is another thing.. as is respecting someone for things even after (if he's found out) to have murdered there family\n\nYeah I agree with that. But if Benoit is proven to have done it, he is nothing more to me than a killer either, and last I checked, people who kill their own kid and wife deserve no respect.\n\nNone whatsoever.\n\nThe one thing that really gets me about these murder-suicides is how these killers always take some one/others with them, like their family's.\n\nThey can't just kill them selfs...F'nn cowards.\n\nyes, doing flips and stuff as well as keeping your shape is fine, and i respect those in the buisness who do that. but someone to act like he actually WINS... is another thing.. as is respecting someone for things even after (if he's found out) to have murdered there family\n\nIt sounds wrong because we're talking about murder, but his performance as a wrestler doesn't have anything to do with his personal life."
