        "text": "FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. – Pro wrestler Chris Benoit strangled his wife, suffocated his 7-year-old son and placed a Bible next to their bodies before hanging himself with a weight-machine pulley, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nInvestigators found anabolic steroids in the house and want to know whether the muscle man nicknamed “The Canadian Crippler” was unhinged by the bodybuilding drugs, which can cause paranoia, depression and explosive outbursts known as “roid rage.”\n\nAuthorities offered no motive for the killings, which were spread out over a weekend, and would not discuss Benoit’s state of mind. No suicide note was found.\n\n“In a community like this, it’s bizarre to have a murder-suicide, especially involving the death of a 7-year-old,” District Attorney Scott Ballard said. “I don’t think we’ll ever be able to wrap our minds around this.”\n\nThe bodies were found Monday afternoon in the house, off a gravel road in the Fayetteville suburb about 20 miles south of Atlanta.\n\nBenoit’s 43-year-old wife, Nancy, was killed Friday in an upstairs family room, her feet and wrists were bound and there was blood under her head, indicating a possible struggle, Ballard said. His son, Daniel, was probably killed late Saturday or early Sunday, the body found in his bed, the district attorney said.\n\nBenoit, 40, apparently hanged himself several hours and as long as a day later, Ballard said. His body was found in a downstairs weight room, his body found hanging from the pulley of a piece of exercise equipment.\n\nA closed Bible was placed next to the bodies of the wife and son, authorities said.\n\nThe prosecutor said he found it “bizarre” the wrestler spread out the killings over a weekend and appeared to remain in the house for up to a day with the bodies.\n\nToxicology test results may not be available for weeks or even months, Ballard said. As for whether steroids played a role in the crime, he said: “We don’t know yet. That’s one of the things we’ll be looking at.”\n\nSteroids have been linked to the deaths of several professional wrestlers in recent years. Eddie Guerrero, one of Benoit’s best friends, died in 2005 from heart failure linked to long-term steroid use.\n\nThe father of Curt “Mr. Perfect” Hennig blamed steroids and painkillers for Hennig’s drug overdose death in 2003. Davey Boy Smith, the “British Bulldog,” died in 2002 from heart failure that a coroner said was probably caused by steroids.\n\nMontreal-born Benoit (pronounced ben-WAH) was a star of the WWE wrestling circuit and was known for his wholesome family-man image. His wife was a wrestling stage manager who worked under the name “Woman.” They married in 2000.\n\nWhen he won the world heavyweight championship in 2004, Benoit hoisted the belt over his head and invited his wife and child into the ring to celebrate. When asked that year by the Calgary Sun to name his worst vice, Benoit replied: “Quality time with my family is a big vice. It’s something I’ll fight for and crave.”\n\nDespite those appearances, Nancy Benoit had filed for a divorce in 2003, saying the couple’s three-year marriage was irrevocably broken and alleging “cruel treatment.” She later dropped the complaint, as well as a request for a restraining order in which she charged that the 5-foot-10, 220-pound Benoit had threatened her and had broken furniture in their home.\n\nIn the divorce filing, she said Benoit made more than $500,000 a year as a professional wrestler, and she asked for permanent custody of Daniel and child support. In response, Benoit sought joint custody."
