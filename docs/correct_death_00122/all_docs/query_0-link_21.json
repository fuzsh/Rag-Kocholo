        "text": "CHRIS\n\nWhile getting ready to come to work this morning, I heard more information about C.B. The newsperson started out by saying \"And in the sports news, more about the tradegy of the Chris Benoit story\". All of a sudden it came to me. WHAT does the C.B. story or fake wrestling have to do with sports? Sports as most of us know and understand it is true athletes competing in a sporting event which is regulated and legally controlled by a governing body of officials where real penalities are handed out for violations. The C.B. story and other fake wrestling stories should perhaps be mentioned in the soap opera headlines. $$$$\n\nSports\n\nthese men are very much athletes. what he did was wrong he will pay for that\n\nMy main point in my original thread was that they are not participating in a sport. I'll not argue the point that most of those fake wrestlers are athletic. According to Webster a athlete is \"one who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports or games requiring physical strength, agility or stamina\". Maybe fake wrestling could be interrupted as a exercise or a game but I don't see it as a sport unless sports is used in a wide sense of the term. Sports as I see it is not a rehearsed event where there is a pre-determined winner."
