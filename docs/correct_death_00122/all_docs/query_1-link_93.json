Select Post\n\nSelect Post Deselect Post\n\nDeselect Post Link to Post\n\nLink to Post Back to Top Post by Johnny Wrestling on\n\n\n\n...Some reports found interest in the fact that the popular website Wikipedia had an entry sometime after 12:00 midnight, after Night of Champions that said that Chris Benoit’s wife was dead. This was posted from a computer in Connecticut and a good 12 or so hours before the bodies were discovered. And of course, the WWE Headquarters are located in Stamford, Connecticut. There were rumblings that the case could go from a Double Murder-Suicide to a Triple Homicide if enough evidence was found.\n\nWhen I read that, I really got shocked, cause I never knew that.\n\n\n\nNo suicide note, the Wikipedia posting, and times of death not matching up. After all, the police stated that Nancy was murdered on Friday, Daniel early Saturday and Chris later that Saturday or early Sunday morning. Yet, police stated that Chris had been watching the Vengeance pay per view on Sunday night as well as communicating with others. How can someone do that when they had passed on? A motive had never been revealed or even hypothesized. It could be that the police are complete imbeciles. Hey, it’s not impossible. Come to my city and you’ll realize that if my neighborhood had Chief Wiggum from the Simpsons, it would be a step forward. Yet, too many mistakes were made by this force. The wrong area code was on the text messages sent, the diary Benoit kept was never examined, not to mention that the case was closed way too quickly. Something really seems fishy about this entire situation. Nothing seems to match up yet everyone’s popular belief is that what happened that weekend, according to the authorities, is exactly what happened. Case closed, pun intended. Without question, the following is going to cause an outburst by someone here. However, the following needs to be expressed. From forensic analysts to former prosecutors, many have stated that something seems wrong with this case. It stems from many instances., the Wikipedia posting, and times of death not matching up.

I mean, most people when they commit suicide, they leave notes. Benoit didn't, but he had a dairy which wasn't examined. I think it does seem fishy like this guy said.\n\n\n\nIf someone wants to read all the article here's the link:\n\n\n\nRemove the * I was at OWW, and at the forums someone posted something that interested me about Chris BenoitWhen I read that, I really got shocked, cause I never knew that.Weird.
