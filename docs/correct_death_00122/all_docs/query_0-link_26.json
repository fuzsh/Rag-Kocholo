Tommy Pope of the Fayette County Sheriff’s Department said the three were found at their home about 2:30 p.m., but he refused to release details.\n\nPope said results of autopsies on Benoit, his wife Nancy and 7-year-old son Daniel were expected todaytues.\n\nBenoit, 40, was a former world heavyweight champion, Intercontinental champion and held several tag-team titles over his career.\n\nThe WWE canceled its live “Monday Night RAW” card in Corpus Christi, Texas, and USA Network aired a three-hour tribute to Benoit in place of the scheduled wrestling telecast.\n\n“WWE extends its sincerest thoughts and prayers to the Benoit family’s relatives and loved ones in this time of tragedy,” the federation said in a statement on its Web site.\n\nBenoit was scheduled to perform at the “Vengeance” pay-per-view event Sunday night in Houston but was replaced at the last minute because of what announcer Jim Ross called “personal reasons.”\n\nBenoit, a Canadian native, maintained a home in metro Atlanta from the time he wrestled for the defunct World Championship Wrestling."
