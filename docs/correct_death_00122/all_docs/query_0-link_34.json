The police said they were investigating the deaths as a murder-suicide.\n\nDetective Bo Turner told the television station WAGA that the case was being treated as a murder-suicide, but he said that could not be confirmed until evidence was examined by a crime lab.\n\nThe station said that investigators believed the 40-year-old Benoit, who appeared for World Wrestling Entertainment, killed his wife, Nancy, and his 7-year-old son, Daniel, in the family’s home over the weekend, then killed himself Monday. A neighbor called the police, and the bodies were found in three rooms.\n\nBenoit was a former world heavyweight champion. He also held several tag-team titles during his career."
