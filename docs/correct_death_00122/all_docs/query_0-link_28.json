W-W-E wrestler Chris Benoit (ben-WAH'), his wife and son were found dead in their Georgia home on Thursday.\n\nPolice say they're investigating the deaths as a homicide. A spokesman for the Fayette County Sheriff's Department says the three were found at their home this afternoon. No other details. Results of autopsies on Benoit, his wife, Nancy, and seven-year-old son Daniel are expected tomorrow.\n\nThe 40-year-old Benoit was a former world heavyweight champion, Intercontinental champion and held several tag-team titles over his career.\n\nW-W-E issued a statement extending \"its sincerest thoughts and prayers to the Benoit family's relatives and loved ones in this time of tragedy.\"\n\nBenoit had been scheduled to perform at the \"Vengeance\" pay-per-view event Sunday night in Houston, but was replaced at the last minute because of what announcer Jim Ross called \"personal reasons.\""
