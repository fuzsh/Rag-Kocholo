    "text": "Benoit's wife strangled, son smothered, official says\n\nFAYETTEVILLE - Pro wrestler Chris Benoit strangled his wife and smothered his son before hanging himself in his weight room, a law enforcement official close to the investigation told The Associated Press.\n\nThe official spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAuthorities also said they are investigating whether steroids may have been a factor in the deaths of Benoit, his wife and their 7-year-old son who were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide.\n\nFayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said test results may not be back for weeks or even months.\n\n\"We don't know yet. That's one of the things we'll be looking at,\" he said.\n\nAutopsies were scheduled today by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation in DeKalb County.\n\nAuthorities were investigating the deaths at a secluded Fayette County home as a murder-suicide and were not seeking any suspects.\n\nInvestigators believe Benoit (pronounced ben-WAH) killed his wife, 43-year-old Nancy, and 7-year-old son Daniel during the weekend and then himself Monday. The bodies were found Monday afternoon in three separate rooms of the house, off a gravel road about two miles from the Whitewater Country Club.\n\nNancy Benoit filed for a divorce in May 2003, saying their three-year union was irrevocably broken and alleging \"cruel treatment.\" But she later dropped the complaint, as well as a request for a restraining order in which she charged that Benoit had threatened her and had broken furniture in their home.\n\nIn the divorce filing, she said Benoit made more than $500,000 a year as a professional wrestler and asked for permanent custody of Daniel and child support. In his response, Benoit sought joint custody.\n\nAuthorities declined to say whether drugs or steroids were found inside the house. \"We're not releasing any information as far as what was located inside the house,\" sheriff's Sgt. Keith Whiteside said today.\n\nAsked about the condition of the interior of the house, Whiteside said investigators found \"nothing really out of the ordinary.\" He said Benoit was found in the home's weight room, his wife in an office and the son in an upstairs bedroom.\n\nWhiteside said toxicology tests could take up to a week or longer to complete.\n\nNeighbors said the Benoits led a low-key lifestyle.\n\n\"They were nice,\" said Lorre Jones, who lives across the street. Her daughter Alaina said: \"We would see Chris walking in his yard from time to time. He wasn't rude, but he wasn't really outwardly warm.\"\n\nJimmy Baswell, who was Benoit's driver for more than five years, placed a white wreath at the Benoits' gate Tuesday.\n\n\"I saw him with his family all the time,\" said Baswell. \"They always seemed like they were the happiest people.\"\n\nBenoit, born in Montreal, was a former world heavyweight champion, Intercontinental champion and held several tag-team titles. His names in the ring included \"The Canadian Crippler.\"\n\nBenoit had maintained a home in metro Atlanta from the time he wrestled for the defunct World Championship Wrestling. The Fayette County Tax Assessors Office lists the value of the house, situated on more than 8.5 acres, at nearly $900,000."
