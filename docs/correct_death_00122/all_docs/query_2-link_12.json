The shock increased.Public opinion fiercely criticized WWE for airing a memorial show for murderer Chris Benoit, and WWE expressed its apology at the beginning of the ECW broadcast, and the overseas broadcast of RAW on June 25 was also replaced with a different highlight video. Among the players who were close to Benoit, Mark Henry had no idea that Benoit committed suicide after killing his wife and children, and was greatly shocked after learning the truth. As can be seen in the autobiography link below, even Chris Jericho, his close friend, and Vince, the chairman who trusted and liked him the most, were shocked by this incident as they encountered the truth about Benoit's extremely dark and terrible side, even though they were relatively close to each other. They were even united enough to come up with countermeasures while communicating closely with each other on the phone.I wasn't always close with Chris Benoit. [2] William Regal continued to maintain a reluctant attitude as described above. Chris Jericho , a fellow WWE wrestler and very close friend of Benoit, wrote a separate section in his autobiography that was later released, detailing his thoughts on the incident and the circumstances at the time. Translation of this part of Jericho's autobiography Jericho said, Regal and Benoit lived in the same neighborhood, and he guessed that Regal may have known Benoit's hidden side, and Regal's comment at the time was so similar to the bad premonition that Jericho had at the time that it gave him goosebumps. He says.In any case, Chris Benoit , who had a strong image as a professional wrestler who was not flashy but was working soundly, was branded as a rare murderer who killed his family and then committed suicide, and as the main culprit that ruined professional wrestling, and his status fell to the bottom.Due to this incident, the so-called Looseless Aggression Era was virtually forced to end, and WWE , which was on the verge of disintegration due to strong public criticism , lowered its viewership rating from Rated PG-13 to Rated PG, removing provocative and violent content. The PG era began with the goal of purifying the WWE and becoming a 'WWE for the whole family', but these changes barely allowed WWE to survive. Is this event positive or negative? [3] It had a huge impact on the professional wrestling industry, the biggest of which was the rise of John Cena. And like in the past Attitude days, the sexual aspect has almost disappeared, and direct attacks to the head when using weapons have completely disappeared throughout the industry, and professional wrestling techniques that attack the head (representatively pile driver) or attack with the head (representatively top rope headbutt or swan) have disappeared throughout the industry. Dive headbutts) were almost always expelled from WWE, at least, and this incident also created a culture of focusing on professional wrestling itself. In short, it was an opportunity for the emergence of the reality era, and as a result, the quality of competition improved significantly. The crossface , a technique that Benoit used as a finishing technique during his lifetime, was not even used by other players in WWE for a while because Benoit used it as a finishing technique. However, as time passed, the seal was partially released and players began to use this technique often."
