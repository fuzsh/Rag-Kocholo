FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. (AP) -

Real-life tragedy in the world of professional wrestling. W-W-E wrestler Chris Benoit (ben-WAH'), his wife and son were found dead in their Georgia home on Thursday.

Police say they're investigating the deaths as a homicide. A spokesman for the Fayette County Sheriff's Department says the three were found at their home this afternoon. No other details. Results of autopsies on Benoit, his wife, Nancy, and seven-year-old son Daniel are expected tomorrow.

The 40-year-old Benoit was a former world heavyweight champion, Intercontinental champion and held several tag-team titles over his career.

W-W-E issued a statement extending "its sincerest thoughts and prayers to the Benoit family's relatives and loved ones in this time of tragedy."

Benoit had been scheduled to perform at the "Vengeance" pay-per-view event Sunday night in Houston, but was replaced at the last minute because of what announcer Jim Ross called "personal reasons."
