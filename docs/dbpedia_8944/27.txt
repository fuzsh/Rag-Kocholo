Summary

Dinar coin issued by the Umayyad Caliph al Walid I (705-715 AD). Struck at the Damascus mint (probable) in the year 92 AH (711-712 AD). The coinage reform which led to the issue of this coin began in 77 AH (696-697 AD) under the Umayyad Caliph 'Abd al-Malik. It removed all symbolism associated with Byzantine or Sassanian rule. Instead a purely inscriptional coin-type, giving in Arabic ( script and language) the Muslim confession of faith, and various Qur'anic verses were employed. On gold coins the date is of production is provided but not the name of the mint, it is believed that Damascus was the sole gold mint.
