        "text": "Money has long been a medium of exchange, a standard of payment, the unit of account and a store of value. The currencies in ancient time were metal coins, particularly gold and silver. The dinar (gold) was the currency unit in the Byzantine empire and the dirham (silver) in the Persian empire before Islam. A few decades after the conquest of these empires, the Islamic state began to mint the Islamic dinar and dirham. Estimating their equivalent value in modern times is necessary for the study of the economic history of Muslims and the economic system of Islam.\n\nAn amazingly wide range of things has been used as money in different societies, at different times in the past. Among the necessary qualities of what may be used as a money are;\n\nthat it is acceptable for everyone;\n\nthat it can be stored and carried easily;\n\nthat it does not wear out easily.\n\nFor these reasons, the use of precious metals like gold and silver became widespread. These metals were used for a long time before the advent of paper money. To determine the measure and value of these metals, the state (sovereign) had to seal a quantity of them in the form of coin, which could be used by people in their exchanges. Money, as it is known today, first appeared in the form of coins made of gold, silver and other metals or alloys. The value of this money was determined by the value of the metal content so that it was accepted publicly.\n\nDuring the pre-Islamic era two weights, dinar and dirham, were used to weigh gold and silver. These names were also used for gold and silver coins. Arabia used both dinar, the Byzantine currency, and the dirham, the Persian currency. When Islam came, the Prophet did not change the weights that were current in Makkah. He approved the use of dirham and dinar as money. Both are mentioned in the Qur’an (3:75) “Among the people of the scripture there is one who if you trust him with a weight of treasure, will return it to you; and among them there is one who if you trust him with dinar, he will not return it to you unless you keep standing over him. That is because they say we have no duty to the gentiles. They knowingly speak a lie concerning Allah” and the Qur’an also says: “they sold him for a few dirhams” (Qur’an, 12: 20).\n\nDuring the early Islamic era, the Byzantine dinar, that weighed one mithqal (a unit of weight, equal to about five grams) was the currency used by people in their exchanges. However, though it was the official currency of that time, the state did not have any control over its use by people in their exchanges. This situation lasted until the year of 74 (AH) (compare to Baladhuri, 1956: 454), when ¢Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan began the minting of new coins under the guidance of Muhammad ibn Ali (the fifth Shi’ite Imam) (al-Shahid al-Thani, 1976: 1/50), and the Islamic dirham began to be used instead of the old dinar. The value and the weight of the Islamic dinar was the same as that of the dinar (al-Dhahabi, 1934: 2; Imam al-Shushtari, 1964: 79). So, the value and weight of the dinar was not changed. So, the dinar can be considered as a basic measure of monetary value, and other values can be measured against it. Archeologists have unearthed coins of the Islamic era, of which it is clear that the weight of the dinar, coined at the time of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, was about 4.25 grammes (ShubhiÏ, 1976: 427).\n\nDirham, the Persian (Sassanid) currency, was used before and after the appearance of Islam in Arabia. During the caliphate of Ali ibn Abi Talib (R.A), new coins were coined with the name of Islamic government engraved on them. Some Qur’anic words the year and the place of the coinage were written on both sides of these coins in kufi script. The legend engraved on the coin was: ‘this dirham has been coined in Basra in the year 40 AH”. So, it can be said that the first independent coin was minted during the caliphate of Ali ibn Abi Talib. However, that happened at the end of his caliphate and was not continued after his death. So, in effect, because of its rarity, the Islamic dirham was not accepted as the regular currency. Instead, the Sassanid dirham continued to be used as money until the caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. There was a variety of Sassanid dirhams used in the early years of Islamic rule, differing in value and weight. The Baghli dirham (named after the person who minted it) was minted under the order of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab. It was in fact, a recoinage of the Wafi (Kasravi) dirham and weighted 20 carats and contained 8 daneghs. The TabarÏ dirham (from to Tabaristan, in the north of Iran), was recoined by Khalid ibn al-Walid in the year 15 AH, weighted 1o carats and contained 4 daneghs. The Juraghi dirham weighted 12 carats and contained 4.5 daneghs. In addition to these three, there were other dirhams in use: the Yamani and the Maghribi dirham which contained one and three daneghs, respectively. According to some jurists, the variation in the value of the dirham led to difficulty in the estimation of financial religious duties. To clarify the rate and range of the alms, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, the second caliph, ordered that the most widely used dirhams be specified, and the legal dirham defined based on the average of these dirhams. However, scholars have argued that exchanges were estimated based on Baghli and Tabari dirhams; and the legal dirham was not coined until 74 AH during the Ummayad Caliphate.\n\nLarge numbers of Islamic dirhams were minted during the caliphate of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. About 30 dirhams were selected from three different varieties, weighing 10, 6 and 5 mithqals. The Islamic dirham was defined as the average weight of these three dirhams:\n\n10 (1+0.6+0.5) / 30 = 0.7 Methgal\n\nThe exchange rate between dirham and dinarr was set out as 7/10. That is, 0.7 methgal was the weight of the Islamic dirham. Using this ratio, the weight of this dirham can be estimated as follows:\n\n4.25 (7/10) = 2.275 Grams\n\nAs stated earlier, the Islamic government did not have any control over coinage on the value of in-money circulation until the year 74 AH. There was no consistency and growing dishonesty, in the alloy, the content and weight of coins. In addition, when Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan came to know that borders of curtains imported from Rome were woven with the proclamation of the Christian Trinity, he ordered this to be changed to a proclamation of the Islamic creed in the textile factories of Egypt. It is in retaliation for this that the Roman emperor threatened to engrave blasphemy against the Prophet on Roman coins.\n\nTo solve this problem, the Islamic government sought to establish control of and improve the monetary system. Thereafter, the government established legal Islamic dirham, and steadily expelled the old coins in circulation out of its territory, and the new money replaced them. After the establishment of the mint houses, the people paid a charge to have their gold turned into coins. The charge was one percent of the weight of the given gold, to cover the cost of minting (wages and fuel). In this way, the government managed to take control of the assay of the coins and did its best to raise their quality and consistency. It was Umar ibn al-Humayri, the governor of Iraq, who raised the purity of the silver coins for the first time. After him, Khalid ibn Abdullah and Alghasry, the governors of Iraq at the time, of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, tried to raise the standard of the coins with more care. Yusuf ibn Umar was the most successful governor in this respect.\n\nAccordingly, the best money during the time of Ummayads was the Khalidiyya’ and ‘Yosufiyya’ and Abu Jafar took the tribute based on these coins. During the Abbasid caliphate, these efforts were continued and led to fruitful results. Surviving coins from the Ummayads and Abassid periods, tested with modern equipment, show that the standard values of the Ummayad dinar and the dinar current during the caliphate of Haroon al-Rashid respectively were 87.9 and 97.1 percent of a common measure. These figures are remarkable, given the relatively primitive equipment that would have been available.\n\nThe ‘natural value’ of dirham and dinar refers to the value of the alloy contents in dinar (gold) and dirham (silver). As mentioned, before the appearance of Islam, dirham and dinar used to be exchanged according to their weights. So the value of dinar and dirham was determined by their contents (silver or gold), i.e., the value of money was the same as the natural value of the metal content of the coins, therefore, the term value of money (i.e. purchasing power) was not under consideration. Here, we estimate the natural value of the Islamic dirham and dinar against the Pakistan rupee, based on the fitness of gold during the Ummayad caliphate (87.9 percent), the weight of Islamic dinar (4.25 grams), and the price of each gram of gold 22 carats fine on 23rd October, 2017 which is 4156.4 Rupee in Pakistan. It is worked out as follows:\n\n4.25 * 87.9 / 100 = 3.73575 Grams\n\nThat is, the amount of the pure gold in each methgal is about 3.74 grams. To estimate the amount of net gold used in each gram of gold, we have:\n\n18 / 24 * 100 = 0.75\n\nThus, the ratio of the pure gold in each gram is 75 percent of gold 22 carats fine. So, the value of the Islamic dinar, on 23rd October 2017 can be estimated at 19,855.21 PKR.\n\n3.73575 * 4156.4 / 0.75 = 20,703.02 PKR\n\nAgainst the dollar rate of 105.41/PKR, each dinar can then be estimated to be about 196.41 dollars."
