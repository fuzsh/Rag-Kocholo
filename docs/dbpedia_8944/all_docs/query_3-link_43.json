        "text": "In a newly acquired cache of more than 2,800 coins dating to Islam’s medieval era, the Louvre Abu Dhabi not only has a bounty for its permanent collection, but also signposts on the road map of early Islam, all coated in tarnish, corrosion and the mystery of history.\n\nThe three-year-old museum is devoting time and resources to study and restore the coins, which are scheduled to go on display in September. It is tracing their origins to better understand their metallic composition as well as how they helped to shape late antiquity, the dawn of the Middle Ages and modern trade across the Muslim world.\n\nFor coins — or really any artifact unearthed from the ruins of a temple or beneath millenniums of dust and sand — restoration is a delicate and sometimes tedious process. But the Louvre’s founders consider it part of the museum’s mission in the Middle East.\n\n“One of the focuses of the Louvre Abu Dhabi is ancient trade, so we are always looking at developing this idea of power and trade routes across the Islamic world,” said Souraya Noujaim, scientific, curatorial and collections management director at the museum. “It is extremely rare to acquire such an amount of undocumented history. This was really the moment where the Islamic empire was creating a new vocabulary around design, freeing itself from the Byzantine and Sasanian empires.”\n\nThe Hoard of Jazira, as the museum has named the cache, was obtained in 2019 from a private collector in Europe (the museum declined to identify the person). It consists of 2,861 coins dating from the reign of King Shapur II (A.D. 309-379) to the Caliph Al Ma’mun (A.D. 813-833). There are 434 Sasanian drachmas, 156 dirhams and Arab half-dirhams, 323 Umayyad dirhams and 1,948 silver coins of the Abbasid dynasty.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
