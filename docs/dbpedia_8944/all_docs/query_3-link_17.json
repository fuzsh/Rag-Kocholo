This Dirham was struck in Wasit in the year three and ninety').\n\nReverse Description\n\nAt centre within a circle of dots Arabic legend in four lines (translation: 'God is one God the eternal and indivisible who has not begotten and has not been begotten and never is there His equal'); around Arabic legend (translation: 'Muhammad is the messenger of God He sent him with guidance and the true religion to reveal it to all religions even if the polytheists abhor it').\n\nEdge Description\n\nPlain.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe coinage reform which led to the issue of this coin began in 77 AH (696-697 AD) under the Umayyad Caliph 'Abd al-Malik. It removed all symbolism associated with Byzantine or Sassanian rule. Instead a purely inscriptional coin-type, giving in Arabic (script and language) the Muslim confession of faith, and various Qur'anic verses were employed."
