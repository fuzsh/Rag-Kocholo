        "text": "Coins of Dinars, Dirhams, and Fals in the era of Abd al-Malik bin Marwan had many developments until the issuance of the new Islamic style. But during these stages, they issued coins have the portrait of the Umayyad Caliph was something new among Muslims and the Islamic State. Abd al-Malik produced the most exceptional coins in several stages to form the Arab-Islamic coins without any foreign influences, the stage of the imperial portraits 692-694 CE and the stage of the Arab portrait 694-697 CE. The coinage after the reform contained Arabic texts only, without any foreign influences, which contained Quranic texts in Kufic script and some phrases that show the place and date of the minting. the coins minted in Syria are the best example of studying coinage of this stage because Syria is the center of the Umayyad caliphate, and Damascus was the capital and the most important mint."
