        "text": "[Return to Index]\n\nThe Islamic coin collection of the British Museum is broadly representative and illustrates very nicely the range of imagery and inscriptions. We can see here the first experiments in imitating the figurative imagery of the coins issued by previous rulers in the territories the Arabs conquered, the transition to coins with only Arabic script, and the introduction of various other kinds of imagery, including signs of the zodiac. The images here are from the informative selection in Gallery 34 of the Museum. I have also included a few images from the early medieval section of the museum (Gallery 41) showing Islamic coins as found in Viking hoards. The arrangement below is more or less chronological, with the earliest coins first. Unless otherwise indicated, the place is that of issue, not where the coin was found.\n\nFor a much larger selection of Islamic coins, visit the American Numismatic Society database, to which I have provided links here for individual coins that are analogous to the British Museum examples. Another very rich resource for Silk Road coinage is T. K. Mallon-McCorgray's The Coins and the History of Asia.\n\nClick on thumbnail for full view."
