        "text": "In the 690's there was a propaganda war between the Islamic Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire.\n\nThe Caliphate minted coins inscribed with \"There is no God but God alone; Muhammad is his messenger.\"\n\nThe Byzantine's responded by minting coins with the Emperor on one side and an image of Jesus on the other.\n\nThe Caliphate responded by issuing this coin.\n\nIt is said to either depict Abd-al Malik, (the Caliph) or Muhammad.\n\nIf it is Muhammad then it is the first known image of him and was drawn when there were still people alive who knew what he looked like.\n\nSupposedly Muhammad's surviving followers who knew him were uncomfortable with his image being used on a coin as it may have violated Islam's policy of no religious images.\n\nThe coins were only in circulation for a short period of time before they were replaced with coins sporting lines from the Quran.\n\nSo is the image Muhammad or Abd-al Malik???\n\nIt could be that the image is Muhammad but was said to be Abd-al Malik to prevent the coins from being deemed heretical.\n\nWell for one, it wasn't Jesus that was on the Byzantine coin, but rather the sign of the cross. The corresponding side on the Islamic coin had a pillar with a globe on top. No idea, but I will suggest it's meant to represent Mohammed in a metaphysical sense because putting an actual image of him on the coin is considered heresy.\n\nBut it -did- happen. Around 70 years after Mohammed's death, in the 690's, the Caliph produced an extremely rare coin said to have his image on it. We think this is so because this issue was recalled and all the coins were destroyed, except for the very few that survived like this one.\n\nOn the left, Mohammed is said to be the figure in the middle, flanked by the Caliph and his wife. It's not only the earliest image of him, but most likely the only one ever issued on a coin.\n\nSo the figure on the coin in the OP above is most likely the Caliph himself and the writing probably includes his name (Abd al-Malik).\n\nWell for one, it wasn't Jesus that was on the Byzantine coin, but rather the sign of the cross.

So an Islamic coin could not bear an image of the caliph either. To avoid violating the ban on graven images, Islamic visual art is usually based on plants or geometric patterns.\n\nYou don't have to go very far to find figural Islamic art, though. Qusayr 'Amra is a major early example, and Iran produced plenty of it as well. Still, I have no problem saying that Islamic art is less iconic than most traditions of Christian art.\n\nAccording to\n\nThe Arab-Byzantine \"Standing Caliph\" Dinar From The Time Of Umayyad Caliph ?Abd al-Malik, 76 AH / 695-696 CE\n\nHe's holding a sword in a scabbard.\n\nAnd the words are:\n\n\"Obverse margin: bism All&#257;h l&#257;-ilaha il-All&#257;h wa / h&#803;dahu Muh&#803;ammad ras&#363;l All&#257;h (\"In the name of God. There is no god but God alone. Muh&#803;ammad is the messenger of God\").\"\n\nReverse margin: bism All&#257;h d&#803;uriba hadh&#257; al-d&#299;n&#257;r f&#299; sanat sitta wa sab&#703;&#299;n (\"In the name of God, this d&#299;n&#257;r was struck in the year 76\")\n\nNotice the reverse also copied Byzantine motives, but cutting out cross branches\n\n*Reverse of the Caliph standing coing\n\n*Byzantines:\n\n*The period offer many acculturation process. This is contemporary Arab coin from North Africa, just calking Heraclius coinage\n\n*Abd al Malik also copied other Byzantine coins, removing the cross again\n\nThat's what I thought. You are further proving to me that the current book I am reading regarding the Silk Road isn't very well researched.\n\nUnless it tells you that the Silk Road never really existed then it definitely isn't well researched. We now know that most of the goods that were allegedly transported by this \"Silk Road\" was actually transported by ship. Only a relatively short portion of the alleged land route was actually used."
