        "text": "This paper argues certain perspectives of using Gold Dinar in bilateral or multilateral exchange between any nations worldwide. It is to show stability and security of the trades where no one is negatively affected by fluctuations if merchandises were exchanged in a particular currency. Globalization and advancement in IT had a huge impact on the world&#39;s economy in general, and many nations suffer from it while others become richer and richer. Therefore it is urged to find a better solution for the present and the future generations. It is obvious that something is not compatible in all those things. In recent times many scientists and Islamic scholars stress on importance of gold standard and Gold Dinar as a medium of exchange which a few countries have already introduced. It is the prime time where all Islamic scholars, economists, professors and any other contributors should be involved to come up with the best alternative to current fiat money.\n\nGold, as a precious material, has always attracted attention and had one of the very important roles in trade flows. Once, while there was no money in today's paper form, gold has served as the primary means of payment. The role of gold is different today, though still significant, especially in critical conditions that are characteristic of today's global economy. This paper will make the parallels between the behavior of the BRIC33 countries, and their aspirations for growth in share of gold reserves in the current circumstances, and the countries of Western Europe, on the same basis, in the period after World War II, before the moment of the introduction of convertibility of their currencies. In addition, it will indicate the transfer of gold between countries, its “movement“ through the recent history and present state and position of the gold reserves.\n\nThe world community is gripped by the expectation of significant changes in the international monetary system, which has been permanently in crisis for decades. The uncertainty of the future gives rise to a sense of impending catastrophe, which must be prepared now, finding reliable anchors for preserving capital and providing an equivalent exchange in commodity markets. Historically, during a period of aggravation of the crisis of the international monetary system, monetary gold invariably remains as a reliable anchor, which is due not only to its unique properties, but also to the mentality of economic entities of all levels. The article deals with the basis of the emergence and periodic aggravation of the crises of the international monetary system, the causes of the new exacerbation, and the changing role of monetary gold in the process of globalization of the world economy. The role of international reserves in the gold reserve in the maintenance of socio-political stability is shown, the reasons determining the need to preserve and increase the gold reserves of central banks are substantiated.\n\nAbstract 3 Malaysia is promoting the usage of Gold Dinar as a payment settlement in international trade as a platform of unity between OIC countries. This paper is an extension to an article written by Nuradli Ridzwan Shah Mohd Dali & Abdul Ghafar Ismail (2004) entitled “The Flexible Model, Gold Dinar and Exchange Rate Determination. An Exploratory Study” presented at the COBM Academic Discourse organized by College of Business Management, Universiti Tenaga Nasional. However in this paper, we would investigate the consequences of using the Gold Dinar as a medium of exchange entirely and its impact to the flexible model as an exchange rate determination. Our simulation shows that the implementation of Gold Dinar would increase domestic income if a domestic monetary expansion occurs."
