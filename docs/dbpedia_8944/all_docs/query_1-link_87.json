        "text": "Chapter 2\n\nIslamic glassmaking in Greater Syria (Bilâd al-Shâm): distribution patterns\n\nThe developments of the glass industry and trade in vitreous materials in Greater Syria, formerly the diocese of Oriens recast as Bilâd al-Shâm, followed patterns different from those in Egypt, although there are also some significant similarities. The technological and economic transformations need to be seen against the historical background of the Bilâd al-Shâm that was to become the political centre of the Umayyad Caliphate with Damascus as capital, and the decentralised nature of the Umayyad administration (Walmsley 2000). No new towns were founded in Greater Syria immediately after the Muslim conquest, and the new Muslim elites took up residence in the urban centres and estates left behind by the Byzantines, who had fled to Constantinople (Kennedy 2007, pp. 95-97). This meant that many of the old urban centres, such as Damascus, Aleppo and Jerusalem, survived and often even thrived after the Muslim conquest (Kennedy 1992). At the same time, many of the coastal cities (e.g. Antioch, Beirut, Tyre) that had already been in decline long before the Muslim invasions fully recovered only in the Fatimid period after 969 CE (Kennedy 1985; Kennedy 1992). The gradual decline of the coastal towns may underlie a Mediterranean-wide trend of dwindling numbers of shipwrecks from the middle of the fourth century onwards, as indicated in Andrew Wilson’s evaluation of the chronological distribution of Mediterranean shipwrecks (n=1646; Wilson 2009). Far from implying an acute economic downturn, however, zooming into regional patterns and counting shipwrecks off the southwest coast of Turkey have revealed more localised economic phenomena and a period of economic growth and prosperity from the second half of the fourth through to the early seventh centuries CE (Leidwanger 2017). This dramatic surge in economic maritime activities in the eastern part of the Mediterranean has been attributed to the foundation of Constantinople as the new capital of the Roman Empire which must have greatly affected the flow of resources (Leidwanger 2017). It seems likely that the establishment of Damascus as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate (c. 661 – 750 CE) had a similar effect on the economy and on maritime trade networks. In particular, the commercial activities between Egypt and Syria-Palestine appear to have flourished in the seventh century and continued to do so well into the eighth century CE (Reynolds 2018; Walmsley 2007a). The implementation of a unified monetary system at the end of the seventh century may also have had a beneficial impact on trade and exchange. ‘Abd al-Malik’s monetary reforms which included the opening of a mint in Damascus in 691 CE and the introduction of a new weight standard (4.25 g for the dinar compared to 4.5 g for the earlier gold solidus) in 696 CE shifted the structures and dynamics of the monetary economy considerably. The new, lighter all-epigraphic gold coin, the dinar, almost immediately supplanted the solidus, thus creating an empire-wide Muslim currency and unifying the Umayyad Caliphate into a single currency zone, which up to this point had been divided into a Byzantine (Greater Syria) and Sasanian (Mashriq) system (Bacharach 2010; Treadwell 2009; Walmsley 2007a). The new currency no doubt facilitated the wider movement of coinage and interregional transactions, which may have benefited economic expansion and commercial contacts (Treadwell 2009; Walmsley 2000; Walmsley 2007a).\n\nGlassmaking and glass-working in the Bilâd al-Shâm – the archaeological evidence\n\nOur knowledge of glass production in Greater Syria during the late antique and early Islamic periods is appreciably better than that of Egypt mainly due to ongoing research initiatives and rescue excavations by the Israel Antiquities Authorities (see publications by Yael Gorin-Rosen). A number of primary production installations dating from the Roman imperial period to the eighth century CE were discovered. Evidence for the primary production of glass was found in Beirut (Lebanon) in the form of tank furnaces that were dated to the Hellenistic and early Roman period (first century BCE – first century CE; Henderson 2013; Kowatli et al. 2006). However, there is considerable doubt about this early dating (M.-D. Nenna, personal communication). As regards the late antique and early Islamic periods, several primary production centres have been archaeologically recorded in Israel (Fig. 2). Recently, the manufacture of raw glass was confirmed at fourth-century Jalame (Gorin-Rosen conference presentation) and excavations at Apollonia have yielded the remains of four tank furnaces dating to the sixth to seventh centuries CE (Freestone et al. 2008b; Tal et al. 2004). The remnants of 17 tank furnaces dedicated to the primary production of glass with capacities of eight to ten tons each were discovered at Bet Eli‘ezer near Hadera (Freestone et al. 2000; Gorin-Rosen 1995; Gorin-Rosen 2000). Their activity is attributed to the eighth century CE (Brems et al. 2018). At the nearby site of Horbat Biz’a, further evidence of primary and secondary production was recently identified, dating to the late antique and early Umayyad periods (Gorin-Rosen 2012). All these furnaces seemingly produced large quantities of natron-type glass. Evidence for the primary production of plant-ash glass is known from the excavation of four tank furnaces at Tyre dating to the tenth to eleventh centuries (Aldsworth et al. 2002; Freestone 2002) and from the debris and furnace floor fragments discovered at eighth- to ninth-century Raqqa (Henderson 1999; Henderson et al. 2005a; Khalil and Henderson 2011). A failed glass slab of about nine tons that was discovered in situ in Bet She‘arim may in fact represent an early attempt to mix a Levantine coastal sand (rich in calcareous material) with plant ash as the fluxing agent, and it is now generally dated to the ninth century CE (Freestone and Gorin-Rosen 1999). Some of the primary glassmaking centres were associated with secondary glass workshops such as at Jalame (Brill 1988), Apollonia (Freestone et al. 2008b; Tal et al. 2004), Horbat Biz’a (Gorin-Rosen 2012), and Raqqa (Henderson 1999; Henderson et al. 2002; Henderson et al. 2004; Henderson et al. 2005a). Secondary workshops at some distance from primary production sites have likewise been documented, for instance, at Ramla (Tal et al. 2008), Bet Shean (Gorin-Rosen 2000), Tel Aviv (Freestone et al. 2015b) and at Beit Ras/Capitolias in northern Jordan (Abd-Allah 2010).\n\nA wealth of chemical and isotopic data has also been generated in the last two decades from vitreous materials collected from primary production sites in Syria-Palestine as well as some secondary workshops and consumer sites. The growing body of data from primary workshops has allowed us to refine the geochemical characteristics of glasses produced in Greater Syria and to trace the distribution patterns of raw glass by way of comparison with these established primary production groups. However, we should note that the melt of a single large primary furnace has been shown to be compositionally remarkably heterogeneous (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2008b; Tal et al. 2004). Secondary glass-working processes can at the same time bring about compositional changes due to contaminations, the mixing of different raw glasses and/or cullet, and the potential loss of volatile elements (Freestone 2015; Paynter 2008; Tal et al. 2008). Hence, as emphasised by Ian Freestone (Freestone et al. 2015b), the study of materials from secondary workshops contributes important additional information about what caused these changes, the nature of supply in the secondary glass-working stage and the scale of production. For example, with respect to a refuse deposit associated with the seventh- to eighth-century secondary glass workshop in Tel Aviv, Freestone and colleagues identified three well-defined raw glass types that were apparently worked in the same workshop with minimal mixing and recycling between them (Freestone et al. 2015b). This may reflect changing supply lines and/or the ability of the glass workers to distinguish clearly between the different primary production groups used simultaneously in the same workshop.\n\nRoman and late antique glass groups of Levantine origin\n\nRoman manganese-decoloured and naturally coloured glass\n\nThe compositional data on the glass from the primary furnaces in Beirut have unfortunately not been published in full. With about 67.7% – 73.7% SiO2, 15.3% – 19.5% Na2O, 7.2% – 8.6% CaO, 0.4% – 1% K2O, 0.4% – 0.7% MgO, and 2.2% – 2.6% Al2O3 (Bradford et al. 2018) its averaged composition appears to correspond to a natron-type base glass made from a relatively pure silica source typical of the Levantine coast and a mineral natron as the fluxing agent. In fact, most of the Roman naturally coloured or manganese-decoloured glass is thought to have been produced in Syria-Palestine (Degryse 2014), in contrast to Roman antimony-decoloured glass, the Egyptian origin of which has now been firmly established (Barfod et al. 2020).\n\nWhat follows is a brief discussion of Roman and late antique glass groups manufactured in the Levant. Defining clean groups of Roman manganese-decoloured and naturally blue green glasses proves more difficult than in the case of the Roman antimony-decoloured glass due to the limitations of published data. The sensitivity of some of the analytical techniques that were applied to glass assemblages is often not sufficient to detect small quantities of antimony, given that the threshold above which antimony indicates contamination through recycling or mixing is in the order of 30 ppm. Therefore, the selection criteria could not always be applied as stringently as originally hoped. Moreover, in order to augment the number of samples, some of the Mn and low Mn samples of Jackson and Paynter (2016) were included in this group despite having antimony oxide contents of about 75 ppm (Sb2O5 = 0.01%). It was deemed that this level of contamination would not significantly alter the properties of the base glass. These samples were thus added to obtain a larger dataset and more reliable and representative average values for the base glass. In contrast, samples with suspiciously low alumina (Al2O3 < 2%) and/or high titanium oxide (TiO2 > 0.12%) were excluded from the selection of published data of Roman Levantine glass, broadly defined to include material from the first to fourth centuries CE (Degryse 2014; Gratuze 2018; Jackson and Paynter 2016; Schibille and Freestone 2013; Schibille et al. 2017; Silvestri et al. 2005; Silvestri 2008; Silvestri et al. 2008). Applying these criteria, we are left with a group of 239 samples of mostly colourless and weakly coloured glasses with varying contents of manganese oxide (0.01% – 2.3%). They exhibit more or less identical base glass compositions and are thus probably made from the same or closely related glassmaking sand. The average major and minor element composition is given in table 4. Compared to Roman antimony-decoloured glasses, the Roman Levantine samples tend to have lower soda, higher lime and alumina and on average higher potash levels (Fig. 21). These characteristics suggest the use of a silica source relatively rich in feldspar and poor in heavy minerals, like the famous Belus river sand that was said to have been exploited in Levantine glass production (Brill 1988; Freestone and Gorin-Rosen 1999; Freestone et al. 2000).\n\nGlass\n\ngroup\n\nDate\n\nNa2O\n\nMgO\n\nAl2O3\n\nSiO2\n\nP2O5\n\nCl\n\nK2O\n\nCaO\n\nTiO2\n\nMnO\n\nFe2O3\n\nSr\n\nZr\n\nRoman Mn\n\n(138 < n < 239)\n\n1st – 4th\n\n16.1\n\n0.54\n\n2.62\n\n69.6\n\n0.13\n\n1.1\n\n0.65\n\n7.92\n\n0.07\n\n0.74\n\n0.4\n\n425\n\n37.4\n\nstdev\n\n1.3\n\n0.10\n\n0.24\n\n2.3\n\n0.04\n\n0.18\n\n0.23\n\n0.76\n\n0.02\n\n0.56\n\n0.15\n\n62\n\n10.7\n\nJalame\n\n(n=50)\n\n4th\n\n15.7\n\n0.59\n\n2.73\n\n69.9\n\n0.14\n\n0.78\n\n8.74\n\n0.09\n\n0.65\n\n0.44\n\n567\n\n51.7\n\nstdev\n\n0.9\n\n0.12\n\n0.17\n\n1.6\n\n0.03\n\n0.13\n\n0.67\n\n0.02\n\n0.94\n\n0.19\n\n83\n\n100\n\nApollonia\n\n6th – 7th\n\n14.2\n\n0.68\n\n3.25\n\n71.2\n\n0.05\n\n0.81\n\n0.62\n\n8.43\n\n0.09\n\n0.02\n\n0.50\n\n444\n\n44.9\n\n(n=30)\n\nstdev\n\n1.1\n\n0.28\n\n0.18\n\n1.4\n\n0.03\n\n0.09\n\n0.19\n\n0.79\n\n0.02\n\n0.005\n\n0.11\n\n66\n\n6.1\n\nBet Eli‘ezer\n\n(26 < n < 79)\n\n8th\n\n12.3\n\n0.59\n\n3.38\n\n74.4\n\n0.07\n\n0.68\n\n0.48\n\n7.35\n\n0.11\n\n0.02\n\n0.69\n\n389\n\n44.4\n\nstdev\n\n1.2\n\n0.13\n\n0.3\n\n1.5\n\n0.02\n\n0.07\n\n0.08\n\n0.7\n\n0.03\n\n0.004\n\n0.24\n\n34\n\n8.5\n\nTable 4: Averages and standard deviations of Roman and late antique glass groups from the Levant. Major and minor oxides and chlorine are given in [wt %], Sr and Zr are given in [ppm]. Data sources: (Degryse 2014; Gratuze 2018; Jackson and Paynter 2016; Schibille et al. 2012; Schibille et al. 2017; Silvestri et al. 2005; Silvestri 2008; Silvestri et al. 2008) for Roman Mn; (Brill 1999) for Jalame; (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2008b) for Apollonia; (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2000; Freestone et al. 2015b; Phelps et al. 2016) for Bet Eli‘ezer.\n\nThe use of a coastal sand from the eastern Mediterranean is further supported by the strontium and neodymium isotope signatures. Strontium and neodymium isotopic data are available for 73 of the samples from the Roman Lev group as defined above (Barfod et al. 2020; Degryse 2014). The 87Sr/86Sr ratios vary from 0.70858 to 0.70932, with the majority of samples just below the value of present day seawater (87Sr/86Sr = 0.709165 +/- 0.000020 indicated by a dashed line in Fig. 22; Stille and Shields 1997). Hence, the strontium isotopic values are consistent with Holocene seashell being the main source of lime in these Roman glasses (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2003a; Freestone et al. 2009a). The minor variations in the strontium isotope data may be attributed to slightly different proportions of limestone and seashell in the sand source (Degryse and Schneider 2008; Freestone et al. 2003a; Freestone et al. 2009a) and/or contamination by the furnace environment (Brems et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2021). The neodymium isotopic ratios (εNd) range from -6.6 to -3.8 (Fig. 22) and are likewise broadly consistent with the use of Levantine sand sources. Neodymium isotopes of 16 beach sand samples collected along the Levantine coast (Degryse 2014; Henderson et al. 2020) are distributed between εNd = -1 to εNd = -7 (Fig. 22). These considerable variations may be explained by climatic fluctuations and dilution phenomena (Degryse et al. 2010a; Freestone et al. 2009a).\n\nFig. 21: Principal component analysis (PCA) of Roman naturally coloured and Mn-decoloured glass from the Levant in comparison with Roman Sb decoloured glass. Data sources: (Degryse 2014; Gratuze 2018; Jackson and Paynter 2016; Schibille et al. 2012; Schibille et al. 2017; Silvestri et al. 2005; Silvestri 2008; Silvestri et al. 2008) for Roman Lev; (Baxter et al. 2005; Degryse 2014; Gratuze 2018; Jackson 2005; Paynter 2006; Silvestri 2008; Silvestri et al. 2008) for Roman Sb. Please note that the coefficient vectors are given on an enlarged scale (10x).\n\nFig. 22: Strontium and neodymium isotopic composition of 73 glasses from the Roman Lev group in comparison with data from the furnaces at Apollonia and Bet Eli‘ezer as well as Tell Ashmunein. Data sources: (Degryse 2014) for Roman Lev group; (Brems et al. 2018) for Apollonia, Bet Eli‘ezer and Tell el-Ashmunein; (Barfod et al. 2020) for Egyptian glass, including Roman Sb, Foy 2.1 and Egypt 1B & 1C; (Brill and Stapleton 2012; Degryse and Schneider 2008; Degryse 2014; Henderson et al. 2020) for sand sources from the coastal regions. The dashed vertical line marks the 87Sr/86Sr ratio at 0.709165 of present day seawater.\n\nFor comparative purposes, strontium and neodymium isotopic data from the tank furnaces at Apollonia and Bet Eli‘ezer as well as the eighth- to ninth-century secondary glass workshop at Tell el-Ashmunein in Egypt (Egypt 2) were included (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2003a; Freestone et al. 2009a), as were recently published data on some Roman antimony-decoloured, Foy 2.1 and Egypt 1 samples (Barfod et al. 2020). These additional neodymium and strontium isotope data qualify the variability of the Roman Mn glasses. Both Egypt 1B and Egypt 2 (Tell el-Ashmunein) have significantly lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios, which in the case of Egypt 2 is indicative of limestone as the main source of calcium (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2003a; Freestone et al. 2009a). The low strontium ratios of Egypt 1B are somewhat surprising since the Sr/CaO ratios are relatively high and consistent with the use of a shell-bearing coastal silica source (see previous chapter). There are hardly any differences in the εNd signatures of all natron glasses from Egypt and the Levant due to the use of Nile-derived sand sources (Fig. 22). The sand sources collected from the semi-desert area in Syria, by contrast, have substantially lower εNd signatures reflective of geologically older silica sources of continental origin (Henderson et al. 2020). The investigation of hafnium isotopes has recently been shown to be an effective way of differentiating between Egyptian (Roman Sb, Foy 2.1, Egypt I) and Levantine glasses (Roman Mn, Jalame, Apollonia) (Barfod et al. 2020), providing conclusive evidence for the use of different silica sources and thus different primary production locations. This confirms the interpretation that the Roman Mn and naturally coloured glasses, along with the glass from Jalame and Apollonia, were made using sands from the Levantine coast. It should be kept in mind, however, that there are altogether only limited isotopic data available, and the implications of regional variations are therefore not yet fully understood.\n\nThe glass from fourth-century Jalame\n\nThirty years ago, the study of the vitreous material from the glass factory at Jalame provided the most comprehensive set of data on glass produced on the Levantine coast, using sand from the nearby Belus River in the Bay of Haifa (Brill 1988). A primary production furnace has recently been discovered, confirming that Jalame was indeed a primary as well as secondary glassmaking site (Phelps et al. 2016). The fourth-century glass from Jalame has often been conflated with the material from the primary glassmaking factories at Apollonia, probably dating to the sixth and seventh centuries, into the so-called Levantine I group (Freestone et al. 2000). Ian Freestone suggested that glass production in the region around Apollonia may have replaced that in Jalame as early as in the fifth century CE (Freestone 2020). The two compositional groups have since been disentangled into distinct primary production categories based mainly on differential calcium to aluminium, and soda to silica ratios (Phelps et al. 2016). In fact, the Jalame glass cannot easily be distinguished from the Roman Levantine group in terms of the major and minor elements. However, allowing for a significant chronological overlap between the Roman glasses and the assemblage from Jalame, the average compositions indicate a general decline in soda contents and an increase in potash, lime and possibly alumina levels from the earlier Roman Mn and naturally coloured glass to the fourth-century glass from Jalame (Table 4; see also Freestone 2020). The most obvious difference between the two chronological groups is the lime concentration which in Jalame is considerably higher than in the average Roman Mn glass.\n\nLate antique Apollonia glass – Levantine I\n\nThe decline in soda concentrations and the augmentation of aluminium oxide values relative to the silica content become more pronounced in the glasses from the sixth- to seventh-century primary glass furnaces at Apollonia (Fig.23). The glass from Apollonia has on average about 1% - 2% less soda than Jalame and Roman Levantine glass (Table 4). The Jalame and Apollonia glasses can be distinguished on the basis of their lime to alumina and soda to silica ratios (Phelps et al. 2016), which further underscore the similarities between the Roman Levantine group and Jalame glass (Fig. 23a). The close relationship between the Roman and Jalame assemblages may ultimately not be surprising, since the two groups overlap chronologically, and a better temporal resolution and full range of minor and trace elements would be required to delineate the Roman Levantine glasses more precisely. The main difference between Apollonia and the two earlier glass groups is the higher alumina content, while the lime and silica levels as well as the heavy mineral concentrations remain largely unchanged over time (Table 4). These variations relate to the carbonate and feldspar fractions of the silica source used as raw material and their relative proportions in the sand. The lower soda levels, on the other hand, are indicative of different mixing ratios of network former to fluxing agent. The general compositional characteristics of the three Levantine groups can thus be described and to some extent distinguished, but this applies only to the groups as a whole and not to individual samples. Assigning a single data point to one of the Levantine glass groups remains a challenge.\n\nFig. 23: Apollonia glass in comparison with Roman Levantine and Jalame assemblages. (a) CaO/Al2O3 versus Na2O/SiO2 separates the Apollonia glasses clearly from both the Jalame and Roman glass groups, the main difference being the higher alumina contents of the Apollonia glass compared to the earlier glass groups; (b) iron compared to manganese oxide levels of the Roman, Jalame and Apollonia glasses. Vertical line at MnO = 0.03% indicates the cut-off between natural impurities of the raw materials and contaminations through recycling. The curved line corresponds to MnO/Fe2O3 = 2 as a guideline above which manganese becomes effective as a decolourant according to (Silvestri et al. 2005). Data sources: (Degryse 2014; Gratuze 2018; Jackson and Paynter 2016; Schibille et al. 2012; Schibille et al. 2017; Silvestri 2008; Silvestri et al. 2008) for Roman Lev; (Brill 1999) for Jalame; (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2008b; Phelps et al. 2016) for Apollonia.\n\nAnother distinguishing feature between the glass from the primary production centre at Apollonia and the Jalame and Roman groups is the presence or absence of manganese oxide. Both the Roman and Jalame glass populations contain concentrations of manganese that are systematically above the natural impurity levels of silica sources (MnO > 0.03%). By contrast, none of the Apollonia primary raw glass chunks shows an elevated manganese (or antimony) content (Fig. 23b). More specifically, the majority of the Jalame glasses have manganese oxide concentrations that exceed the background (sand) levels (MnO > 0.03%), but are below the threshold where it can be considered an effective decolourant (indicated by the dashed curve in Fig. 23b). These low concentrations of manganese do not necessarily indicate its intentional use as decolourant, but rather suggest recycling and the incorporation of some manganese-containing cullet. Only 15 out of 50 samples from Jalame qualify as manganese-decoloured glasses by having MnO/Fe2O3 > 2. Proportionately more samples belonging to the Roman group (a third to half of the glasses) have levels of manganese oxide indicative of its deliberate addition as decolouring agent. The decline in the use of manganese as decolourant in Levantine glass production sometime in the fourth or fifth century has already been observed by Foy and colleagues (Foy et al. 2003b), who found that manganese is no longer present in Levantine glass after the fifth century CE. The proportional differences between the Roman and Jalame glasses suggest that this trend is noticeable already in the fourth century. The absence of manganese can therefore serve as an additional marker for glass from Apollonia (Freestone 2020).\n\nThe glass from the Apollonia tank furnaces has been extensively characterised in terms of its geochemical and isotopic characteristics in the scientific literature (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2000; Freestone et al. 2008b; Freestone 2020; Phelps et al. 2016; Tal et al. 2004). The 30 samples from different contexts in Apollonia considered here range between 12-16% soda and 68-74% silica, about 3-3.6% alumina and 7-11% lime (Table 4). Apollonia-type Levantine glasses have turned up in the archaeological record across the entire Mediterranean region, from Jordan (Abd-Allah 2010; Al-Bashaireh et al. 2016; Barfod et al. 2018), numerous consumer sites in Israel (Freestone et al. 2008b; Phelps et al. 2016; Tal et al. 2008), Cyprus (Ceglia et al. 2015; Ceglia et al. 2019; Freestone et al. 2002b), Turkey at Labraunda (unpublished data), France (Cabart et al. 2017; Lassaunière et al. 2016; Pactat 2013) and the Iberian Peninsula (De Juan Ares et al. 2019a). Virtually pristine Apollonia-type Levantine I glass emerged as the main glass supplied to sixth- and seventh-century Visigothic Spain (De Juan Ares et al. 2019a). Surprisingly, a survey of published data on glass finds from the Italian peninsula identified only a few individual samples that can be confidently assigned to the Apollonia type of the sixth and seventh centuries (e.g. Schibille et al. 2018b). About six samples from Grado on the northern Adriatic coast (Silvestri et al. 2005) match the Apollonia primary production group. There may also be a small number of recycled Apollonia-type glasses among the assemblage from Santa Maria della Scala in Siena (Hellemans et al. 2019), from Piazza Bovio in Naples (De Francesco et al. 2014), a glass workshop in Catania (Di Bella et al. 2015) and a very few mosaic tesserae from Naples (Schibille et al. 2018b, and references therein). Some Apollonia-type natron glasses were among the vitreous finds from medieval Sicily, mostly from Palermo and Castronovo, and seventh- to eighth-century Mazara del Vallo on the western coast of Sicily (Schibille and Colangeli 2021). In contrast, the earlier glasses of Syro-Palestinian origin, including Roman Mn, naturally coloured and, to a lesser extent, Jalame-type glasses are relatively abundant throughout Italy (e.g. Gliozzo 2017, and references therein).\n\nThe discrepancy in the relative quantities of Levantine glasses in Italy suggests changing supply patterns between the fourth/fifth and sixth centuries. In his doctoral thesis Matt Phelps has noted a difference in the distribution of earlier Levantine glasses compared to glass of the Apollonia production group, stating that during the (late) Roman period Levantine glass was ubiquitous throughout the empire, but that its distribution in the fifth and sixth centuries was more limited to the eastern Mediterranean (Phelps 2017, pp. 97-98). At the time no late antique glass assemblage from the Iberian Peninsula had been analysed. In Iberia we found a preponderance of Apollonia-type Levantine I glass starting around the middle of the sixth century CE (De Juan Ares et al. 2019a). The dominance of Levantine glass is particularly marked in Visigothic contexts in the last quarter of the sixth and first quarter of the seventh centuries CE, but is apparently sustained until the end of the seventh, possibly as late as the early eighth century CE. Similar supply patterns are also emerging in Sicily (Schibille and Colangeli 2021), and Apollonia-type Levantine I glass was used in France until the eighth century CE (Pactat 2020). It thus appears to be less a matter of a difference between the eastern and the western Mediterranean, than of the existence of a variegated patchwork of supply routes connecting different regions that were no longer united in a common Mediterranean-wide empire. One possible reason for the lack of sixth- to seventh-century Apollonia-type Levantine glass in mainland Italy is that the peninsula may simply have been an extensive repository for Roman glass, which was systematically and extensively recycled during the late antique and medieval periods. This is certainly something that was observed in relation to the reuse and recycling of Roman mosaic tesserae in various medieval contexts (Schibille and Freestone 2013; Schibille et al. 2018b) even in the city of Rome itself. In contrast, the Visigothic city of Recópolis, located on the river Tajo in the province of Guadalajara, Castilla La Mancha, was not founded until 578 CE (Olmo Enciso 2008). Here, Levantine glass makes up practically all the vitreous finds collected from workshop 1 which is contemporaneous with the foundation of the city of Recópolis and which was active until the middle of the seventh century CE (unpublished data). The Levantine samples retrieved from workshop 2, dated a little later to the seventh century, mostly show signs of recycling. Thus, in order to furnish the newly founded city with vitreous materials one or more shipments of new raw glass appear to have been imported to Recópolis in the last quarter of the sixth century. Fresh glass may still have arrived in the seventh century, but the archaeo-vitreous record of Iberia increasingly exhibits signs of recycling (see chapter 4).\n\nThe previous sections have outlined the general trends in the primary production of glass on the Levantine coast prior to the Arab conquest which began in 634 CE (Kennedy 2007). In the absence of a more precise dating of the Apollonia tank furnaces which are broadly dated to the sixth to seventh centuries (Freestone et al. 2008b; Tal et al. 2004), it is not entirely clear whether or not primary production activities at Apollonia continued beyond the Arab invasion. In any case, the changes that we see in the chemical makeup of glass produced in Syria-Palestine, such as decreasing soda levels concurrent with increasing lime, alumina and silica contents, had already begun in the fourth century, as reflected in the compositional differences between Jalame and earlier Roman glasses, and even more so between Jalame and Apollonia.\n\nThe decline in soda levels is frequently explained by limited supplies of natron from Egypt (Freestone et al. 2000; Phelps et al. 2016; Shortland et al. 2006). However, the soda levels in contemporary Egyptian glasses appear to be temporarily affected as well. Magby glass has on average a slightly lower soda content (about 16.3%) compared to earlier groups such as Roman Sb, HIMT and Foy 3.2 (Table 1), although this may be related to the incorporation of an ash component that reduced the relative soda levels and increased the potash concentrations. The soda levels of Foy 2.1 vary from 14.2% to 21% (average Na2O ~ 17.7%), but whether there is a chronological dimension to this wide range is impossible to say at this point due to the insufficiently precise dating of most assemblages. No chronological shift is evident from our data on Visigothic glasses in Spain (De Juan Ares et al. 2019a) or the Byzantine glass weights (Schibille et al. 2016). The soda concentrations of the Egypt 1 and Egypt 2 groups remain around the 16% – 16.5% mark and drop off noticeably only after the first quarter of the ninth century CE (see chapter 1). For a brief period at the beginning of the eighth century we even see an increase in the soda levels in Egyptian tesserae recovered from the Great Mosque in Damascus. It is thus unlikely that the exploitation of the natron sources in Egypt were impaired in the long term, and the fluctuations seen during late antiquity may instead be related to climatic variations (Picon et al. 2008; Shortland 2004; Shortland et al. 2006). Different factors must therefore account for the persistent decline in the soda levels in Levantine glasses. The ceramic evidence indicates continued trade between Egypt and southern Syria-Palestine on a relatively large scale into the Umayyad and the Abbasid periods (Reynolds 2018; Walmsley 2007a). Consequently, changing trade networks cannot explain the gradual decline in soda levels either. To what then can we attribute the reduced use of soda in Levantine glass production? Part of the explanation may be the scale of glass production in Egypt during the late antique and early Islamic periods. An increase in local demand for natron in Egypt, caused possibly by large-scale commissions from the central caliphal government, may have led to restrictions on the export of raw materials from Egypt to the Levant. In short, the reason for the decreasing natron imports may not be a decline in trade or problems at the source, but limited availability due to Egypt’s booming glass industry.\n\nThe beginnings of Islamic glass production\n\nEarly Islamic natron glass from Bet Eli‘ezer – Levantine II\n\nThe incredible speed of the Arab conquest of the eastern Mediterranean - by 640 CE the whole of Syria and Palestine was under Muslim rule, followed by Egypt in 642 CE - and the fact that the archaeological record does not show many traces or destruction layers that can be unambiguously associated with the events of the conquest suggest that the impact of the Arab expansion on settlement patterns and daily life was minimal (Milwright 2010; Robinson 2010; Walmsley 2007b). The Arab conquest also appears to have had no immediate discernible consequence for the primary production of glass. There is little or no obvious change in the organisation or scale of glass production, or in the use of raw materials before the late eighth or early ninth century CE (Henderson et al. 2004; Phelps et al. 2016). Large-scale primary production of natron-type raw glass continued throughout the seventh and eighth centuries, as judged by the evidence from Bet Eli‘ezer near Hadera, where the foundations of 17 tank furnaces were unearthed (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2000; Gorin-Rosen 1995; Gorin-Rosen 2000). The glass finds from Bet Eli‘ezer were previously termed Levantine II (Freestone et al. 2000) and the furnaces were initially dated to the sixth to eighth centuries CE (Freestone et al. 2000; Gorin-Rosen 1995; Gorin-Rosen 2000). Since no pre-Islamic finished artefacts from Syria-Palestine correspond compositionally to the Bet Eli‘ezer furnace glass, there is good reason to believe that this Levantine II type is in fact an Islamic glass dated perhaps to the seventh and more likely to the eighth century CE (Freestone et al. 2015b). Four samples recovered from the consumer site at Umm el-Jimal in Jordan are largely consistent with a Levantine II composition and have been loosely attributed to the Byzantine period (Al-Bashaireh et al. 2016). In one instance the context was dated on grounds of a ‘considerable amount of Umayyad ceramics’ (Al-Bashaireh et al. 2016, p. 810), so the exact dates are not entirely clear and there seems to be a distinct possibility that the chronological range of the assemblage extends into the eighth century.\n\nBet Eli‘ezer-type glass is very similar to the glass from Apollonia in terms of its chemical characteristics as well as its strontium and neodymium isotopic signature (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2015b; Phelps et al. 2016). The main distinguishing features of Bet Eli‘ezer glass are low soda concentrations in relation to silica contents and low lime relative to alumina (Table 4; Fig. 24). It also tends to have lower potash concentrations compared to Jalame and Apollonia glasses. The low soda to silica ratios suggest differences in the recipes in terms of the relative proportions of fluxing agent to network former, while the lime and alumina ratios and potassium oxide contents reflect differences in the mineralogical characteristics of the silica source used (Freestone et al. 2000). Bet Eli‘ezer is located further inland than Apollonia and Jalame, and it has been proposed that general geopolitical and economic changes may have caused a re-orientation away from the Mediterranean coast (Phelps et al. 2016). Recently a closely related compositional group was identified among the vitreous refuse material from a secondary glass workshop in Tel Aviv dating likewise to the seventh to eighth centuries CE (Fig. 24; Freestone et al. 2015b). To what extent this was the product of an independent glass production is not clear, as only four samples have been identified to date.\n\nFig. 24: Compositional characteristics of the Bet Eli‘ezer glass in comparison with the glass from Jalame and Apollonia. (a) Lime and alumina levels imply differences in the mineralogical composition of the glassmaking sands of the different Levantine groups; (b) soda versus silica contents reflect different proportions of natron to silica and thus different glassmaking recipes; (c) potassium and aluminium oxides confirm differences in the silica source; (d) ratios of lime to alumina and soda to silica separate Bet Eli‘ezer clearly from earlier Levantine glasses. Data sources: (Brill 1999) for Jalame; (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2008b) for Apollonia; (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2000; Freestone et al. 2015b) for Bet Eli‘ezer; (Freestone et al. 2015b) for Tel Aviv.\n\nDespite the large-scale production of glass at Bet Eli‘ezer (17 tank furnaces with an estimate capacity of eight to ten tons each), this type of glass has not been widely reported from regions outside Syria and Palestine, and even among Levantine assemblages it is surprisingly rare. Bet Eli‘ezer glass was detected among the early Islamic finds from Ahihud, Jerusalem and Ramla (Phelps et al. 2016; Tal et al. 2008). There may also be some Bet Eli‘ezer-type specimens among the eighth-century assemblage from Raya on the Sinai Peninsula (Kato et al. 2009), a few isolated samples from Jordan (Al-Bashaireh et al. 2016; Rehren et al. 2010), and possibly some individual samples in France (e.g. at the Abbey of Hamage, Inès Pactat, personal communication). Phelps and colleagues proposed that the glass produced in Bet Eli‘ezer was destined for a local market and that trade routes had changed more profoundly after the Arab conquest (Phelps et al. 2016). However, even if one assumes that the primary production activities at Bet Eli‘ezer were relatively short-lived, spanning only 50 to 100 years (Freestone et al. 2000), the scale of production is still in apparent contradiction to the scarcity of archaeological finds of this type of glass. The exceptionally high silica content of the Bet Eli‘ezer glass means that the working temperatures and range are not as advantageous as those, for instance, of Jalame or Apollonia glasses, let alone any of the Egyptian glass groups. The viscosity curve of the Bet Eli‘ezer glass is considerably higher with an estimated temperature difference at the working point of a whopping 70°C compared to Jalame glass and of about 50°C compared to the glass from Apollonia (Fig. 25). Freestone and colleagues believe that these physical properties required an adjustment of the glass-working techniques (Freestone et al. 2000). It is thus worth considering whether this type of silica-rich glass may have been used less for vessel production and more for cast or moulded architectural glasses that became particularly popular during the Abbasid period and that may have required specialised glass-working skills (Leal 2020).\n\nAn interesting case in point are the glass floor tiles that were in demand during the Abbasid period. Naturally aqua-coloured glass floor tiles (Fig. 26) were found, for example, in the reception room of a palace belonging to Hārūn al-Rašīd at Raqqa (about 796-809 CE), in the early ninth-century Qaṣr al-Ḥayr al-Sharqī residence in eastern Syria (Carboni 2003; Ritter 2019; Ritter 2020) as well as the caliphal palace of Samarra (Lamm 1928, fig. 66; Ritter 2019; Ritter 2020). These rectangular tiles (about 16.6 x 11.6 cm) of translucent naturally coloured glass (greenish and bluish aqua to turquoise) have a smooth upper surface and semi-globular nubs on the underside (Fig. 26), and they were presumably produced by casting into moulds (Ritter 2019). Entire glass floors constructed of these translucent glass tiles seem to have been an early Abbasid invention (Leal 2020; Ritter 2019). Even though only fragments of these glass tiles have thus far been documented, the variations in the vitreous material, shapes and profiles of the nubs suggest different secondary production events and possibly workshops (Ritter 2019). Paving entire reception halls, including the lower wall zones, with glass tiles would certainly have required substantial amounts of glass. Interestingly, the preliminary analysis of a square bottle in the Glassware and Ceramics Museum of Iran which was assembled from numerous Abbasid nubbed glass tiles (Ritter 2019) revealed a chemical composition consistent with the Bet‘Eliezer Levantine II compositional group with typical low soda, high alumina and moderate lime levels (personal communication Davoud Agha-Aligol). It is an intriguing thought that the glass produced at Bet‘Eliezer may have been destined mainly for these types of cast architectural decorations. As long as no further analyses of the composition of these glass tiles are carried out, this hypothesis must remain speculative.\n\nFig. 25: Viscosity curves as a function of temperature (in °C) for the average compositions of different Levantine glass groups, including glass from Jalame, Apollonia and Bet Eli‘ezer. Compositional data from table 4 (and table 1 for HIMT2) of major and minor elements (Na2O, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, K2O, CaO, TiO2 and Fe2O3) were used for the calculations. Roman Manganese and naturally coloured glass was not included, because the viscosity curve is identical to that of glass from Jalame. Viscosity model from (Fluegel 2007). The insert shows a scaled zoom highlighting the differences at working temperature.\n\nFig. 26: Examples of Abbasid glass tiles.

Sackler Gallery Archives, Gift of Ernst Herzfeld, 1946.\n\nThe early Islamic mosaic tradition in Greater Syria\n\nGlass from Bet‘Eliezer does not appear to have been extensively used for the production of mosaic tesserae, even though the turn of the eighth century CE can be considered a Golden Age of Islamic mosaic making when, within about a generation, major construction programmes were undertaken that included vast surfaces of mosaic decorations, notably those of the Dome of the Rock (684? - 691? CE) and the al-Aqsa Mosque (709? – 715 CE) on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, the Great Mosque in Damascus (705 - 715 CE), the Great Mosque of Aleppo (possibly begun around 715 CE), as well as the Holy Mosque in Mecca (redecorated between 705 and 715 CE) and the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina (restored between 706 and 709 CE; Grafman and Rosen-Ayalon 1999; James 2017; Leal 2020). Architectural glass was also extensively used in Umayyad palatial residences: glass tesserae were found in the building south of the al-Ḥaram aš-Šarīf, at the Umayyad fort at Qasṭal, in Qaṣr al-Ḥair aš-Šarqī and Qaṣr al-Ḥair al-Ġarbī east and west of Palmyra (Syria), respectively, in Khirbat al-Mafjar (Jericho, Palestine) as well as in Khirbat al-Minya on the northern shore of Lake Tiberias in Israel (Baker 2004; Baker 2005; Grabar 1993; Ritter 2019, and references therein). Hundreds of fragments of coloured window glass (purple, blue, green, yellowish green and amber) were recovered from both the Qaṣr al-Ḥair aš-Šarqī (Salam-Liebich 1978) and Khirbat al-Minya (Ritter 2017). The lavish use of architectural glass, particularly mosaic decorations, meant that appropriate resources had to be mobilised. Using approximate values for both the size of the tesserae (0.75 cm3) and the density of glass (3 g/cm3),1 the Great Mosque of Damascus alone with roughly 7,500 m2 of mosaic decoration (Leal 2020) would have swallowed nearly 170 tons of glass. All the monumental Umayyad mosques in Greater Syria and the Hijaz region together would amount to an estimated mosaic surface of about 22,000 m2 (for approximate calculations see Leal 2020), meaning that a total amount of almost 500 tons (167 m3) of glass was needed. This pertains only to mosaic decorations and only to the so-called Great Mosques and does not take into account the use of glass for windows or lamps, or the numerous smaller foundations or Umayyad palaces.\n\nThe quantities that were required for the various architectural campaigns in the first half of the eighth century would easily have exceeded the capacities of the tank furnaces at Bet‘Eliezer several times over. This may have been one of the reasons why about two-thirds of the original Umayyad mosaic tesserae from the Great Mosque in Damascus and about half of the mosaics and most of the window glass from Khirbat al-Minya were of contemporary Egyptian provenance (see chapter 1; for Damascus see Schibille et al. forthcoming; for Khirbat al-Minya see Adlington et al. 2020). Thus, the analytical evidence gained from the mosaic decoration and window glass fragments from the qasr of Khirbat al-Minya together with the mosaics from the Great Mosque in Damascus provides a nuanced and complex picture of the supply of glass for architectural decorations to Greater Syria at the beginning of the eighth century CE. We should note that no consensus has been reached as regards the dating of the qasr of Khirbat al-Minya, but judging from the compositional characteristics of the vitreous material, an early eighth-century date during the reign of al-Walīd I (705 - 715 CE) as opposed to al-Walīd II (743 -744 CE) is likely (for a discussion of the archaeological and historical evidence see the introduction to Ritter 2017; for analytical data see Adlington et al. 2020).\n\nA comparison of the data on 270 mosaic tesserae from Khirbat al-Minya with 908 mosaic tesserae from the Great Mosque in Damascus shows a broadly similar distribution of the base glasses at the two sites. Al2O3/SiO2 compared to TiO2/Al2O3 ratios separate glass made with a silica source in the Levantine coastal region from glasses of Egyptian origin (Fig. 27a). The overwhelming majority of the Damascus tesserae corresponds to Egyptian glasses of the early Islamic period (Egypt 1A and Egypt 1Ax), and only about 19% of the natron-type tesserae match the compositional features of Levantine glasses. At al-Minya, the distribution between the two production regions is about 50:50. The Egypt 1A tesserae from al-Minya form a very tight cluster, much tighter than at Damascus, and none of the newly described Egypt 1Ax sub-type was identified. The two mosaic assemblages also agree in terms of the relative presence of minor glass groups that occupy an intermediate space between the two major categories. One population has low alumina contents (Al2O3 < 2%), the other corresponds to Foy 2.1 on account of its slightly elevated titanium oxide levels (Fig. 27a). The similarities in the compositional make-up of the mosaic assemblages of the two sites underlines the representative nature of the two data sets on the basis of which a model of the production and supply of mosaic tesserae during the early Islamic period can be advanced.\n\nFig. 27: Compositional affiliations of the glass mosaic tesserae from the Great Mosque in Damascus and Khirbat al-Minya. (a) TiO2/Al2O3 versus Al2O3/SiO2 separate the Egyptian (Egypt 1A & 1Ax) from the Levantine tesserae; (b) lime to alumina and soda to silica ratios distinguish between different Levantine primary production groups from Jalame, Apollonia and Bet‘Eliezer. The Levantine tesserae of both mosaic assemblages are consistent with either Apollonia-type Levantine I or Jalame glass and only a few samples match the later Bet Eli'ezer composition. Data sources: (Adlington et al. 2020; Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2008b; Phelps et al. 2016; Schibille et al. forthcoming).\n\nA detailed classification of the Levantine tesserae from Damascus and al-Minya proves somewhat challenging, because in some of the tesserae calcium phosphate is present as opacifier, which has an impact on the lime to alumina ratios that are typically used to distinguish the different Levantine reference groups (Fig. 27b). The Levantine-type glasses from both mosaic assemblages cluster at the interface of the fourth-century Jalame and sixth- to seventh-century Apollonia reference groups and can therefore not be clearly affiliated with one or the other. Only a handful of tesserae may belong to the Bet‘Eliezer Levantine II type. Using manganese concentrations as an additional marker to distinguish between Apollonia and earlier Levantine groups shows that the majority of Levantine tesserae from both al-Minya and Damascus contain manganese that exceeds the usual background levels of silica sources (Mn > 250 ppm), but is below the concentration at which it could be considered an effective colourant or decolorant (Fig. 28). In view of the fact that Apollonia glass does not usually contain manganese, it can be assumed that the base glass of the Levantine tesserae was a mixture of earlier glass groups that were combined through recycling processes. Broadly speaking, it seems that the base glass of strongly coloured and opacified tesserae is often a mixture of scrap glass in one form or another. Analytical data on Roman and late antique mosaic assemblages have shown that coloured mosaic tesserae are more variable than colourless or weakly coloured glasses in terms of elements such as aluminium, titanium and calcium (e.g. Paynter et al. 2015; Schibille et al. 2018b). The use of various additives to colour and opacify the glass makes it yet more difficult to identify the base glass accurately. The distinction between tesserae of Levantine glass and Egyptian Foy 2.1, for example, is occasionally blurred, because the compositional spectrum of Levantine mosaic tesserae can be more diverse than that of non-coloured glasses (Schibille et al. 2018b). What we can say with some certainty is that a large proportion of the base glass used for the Levantine tesserae (with the exception of a few Bet Eli‘ezer Levantine II type samples) predates the foundation of the Great Mosque in Damascus as well as Khirbat al-Minya in the eighth century. The supply of tesserae to these Syro-Palestinian sites was thus ensured mostly through imports of large quantities of fresh Egyptian material, alongside some recycled and/or reused samples.\n\nThe gold leaf tesserae are the exception to the rule. Apart from one sample (Egypt 1A), all the gold leaf tesserae belong to the Levantine, Foy 2.1 and low alumina glass types. They have surprisingly high manganese contents (MnO median = 3.5%), resulting in a variety of amber and purple hues (Fig. 32b). This colouring practice appears to be quite common in early Islamic tesserae in the Near East, but has never been identified in gold leaf tesserae from the western Mediterranean (Verità 2016). The antimony levels of the Levantine gold leaf tesserae can be attributed to impurities in the glass raw material. Hence they do not exhibit clear signs of recycling and may well have been re-used. The same applies to gold leaf tesserae with a Foy 2.1 and a low alumina base glass. Even though they tend to have slightly elevated antimony contents (Fig. 28), this is not uncommon for these types of Egyptian glasses. Neither manganese nor antimony can therefore be used as a discriminant between reuse and recycling, and it is impossible to tell at which point the Levantine and minor glass groups were fused together and made into mosaic tesserae. There is a distinct possibility that many of the tesserae made of older primary glass groups were in fact reused tesserae as opposed to freshly re-melted cullet turned into “new” tesserae. The collection and reuse of gold leaf tesserae may be particularly attractive due to their higher material value and higher production costs.\n\nFig. 28: Manganese and antimony levels of the different base glass categories among the mosaic assemblages from the Great Mosque in Damascus and Khirbat al-Minya. A considerable number of samples show manganese contents above the threshold of natural contamination (Mn cut-off at 250 ppm), suggesting the incorporation of some recycled material during the life-cycle and secondary production of the glass tesserae, especially as regards the tesserae with a Levantine base glass composition. The gold leaf tesserae have exceptionally high manganese concentrations. Here, manganese was probably added deliberately for colouring purposes, whereas the antimony contents at impurity levels do not betray any recycling. Data sources: (Adlington et al. 2020) for al-Minya; (Schibille et al. forthcoming) for Damascus.\n\nAn interlude – the gold in gold leaf tesserae\n\nSome authors have suggested that the composition of the gold (and silver) leaf can provide additional insights into secondary working processes and, due to a direct link with contemporary gold coinage, facilitate the distinction between reused and newly made tesserae (Neri et al. 2016). In a preliminary series of experiments, we have analysed the gold leaf of tesserae from Damascus (n=21) and Khirbat al-Minya (n=9) alongside earlier samples from the fourth-century Roman villa of Noheda in Spain (n=8), the sixth-century Church of St Mary at Ephesos (n=4) and Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (n=21). The tesserae from Damascus and Khirbat al-Minya have gold contents of between 77% and 97% (Fig. 29a), which is considerably lower than those of Byzantine gold coins of the sixth and seventh centuries and of early Umayyad coinage from Syria (Gondonneau and Guerra 2002; Jonson et al. 2014). Late seventh- and early eighth-century coins from the Islamic mints in North Africa as well as a single, anomalous Byzantine coin from the reign of Constantine IV labelled as Arab/Byzantine by the Barber Institute have comparably low gold contents (Jonson et al. 2014). North African mints apparently started to issue debased gold solidi, semisses and tremisses shortly after the Arab conquest of the region. The decline in gold levels resulted from an increase in silver and copper contents (Jonson et al. 2014). A clear debasement of gold coinage and parallel increase in silver contents (not copper) was observed in the eastern Mediterranean mints only later during the Abbasid caliphate (Gondonneau and Guerra 2002). Thus, there is a clear difference between the composition of the gold leaf of tesserae on the one hand and Byzantine and early Islamic gold coinage on the other hand. The gold content in the tesserae tends to be consistently lower and the silver higher than in the contemporary coins from the Near East and, to a lesser extent, the coinage from the North African mints (Fig. 29b). In fact, the sixth-century gold leaf tesserae from Ephesos and Hagia Sophia in Constantinople show a similarly broad range of gold contents from 85% to 98%, but these sixth-century tesserae have a higher median of about 96% compared to 92% of the al-Minya and 85% of the Damascus samples. The range of gold concentrations is much narrower in the fourth-century tesserae from the Roman villa at Noheda (91% - 98%), but some overlap with late antique and early Islamic tesserae occurs at the lower end of the spectrum (Fig. 29a). No chronological and geographical attribution of the gold leaf tesserae is thus possible based on the gold and/or silver contents.\n\nNumerous numismatic studies have shown that the gold sources exploited by the Byzantines and early Umayyads were compositionally related and that Islamic gold coinage issued in North Africa and Syria during the Umayyad period relied heavily on the recycling of Byzantine gold coins (Gondonneau and Guerra 2002; Jonson et al. 2014). The similarities are reflected in the relatively narrow range of platinum to gold ratios of all the sixth-century Byzantine mosaic tesserae, the Byzantine and Umayyad coinage as well as the majority of the tesserae from Damascus and Khirbat al-Minya (Fig. 29a). By contrast, the fourth-century tesserae from the Roman villa of Noheda, together with one tessera from Khirbat al-Minya with an Apollonia-type Levantine I composition (NS-T049), one gold leaf tessera from Hagia Sophia made from a Foy 2.1 base glass, and one Islamic coin of uncertain provenance (L463 in Gondonneau and Guerra 2002) have notably lower Pt/Au ratios. This is a clear indication that the gold used for these artefacts derived from a different primary source from that of all the other tesserae. The palladium to gold ratios further enabled us to separate the gold leaf of all the mosaic tesserae analysed from both the Byzantine and early Umayyad gold coinage (Fig. 29c). Palladium and platinum have proven to be reliable markers for the identification of ‘gold stocks’, as neither Pd/Au nor Pt/Au ratios appear to be affected by ancient metallurgical processes (Blet-Lemarquand et al. 2017). It is therefore very striking that the tesserae from Damascus, Khirbat al-Minya and Hagia Sophia are distributed along the same regression line of Pd/Au and Pt/Au ratios, which differs considerably from that of the Byzantine and Umayyad gold coinage. The compositional features of the mosaic tesserae under consideration therefore rule out a direct material link between the production of gold leaf used for the manufacture of tesserae and Byzantine or Islamic gold coinage in the sixth, seventh and early eighth centuries CE. At the same time, the majority of sixth- to eighth-century tesserae seem to derive from a common source of gold independent of the base glass composition. Both Levantine and Egyptian Foy 2.1 tesserae made use of the same type of gold, even though there are some outliers that have very different gold leaf features (Fig. 29).\n\nThe elevated silver concentrations in the gold leaf in comparison to gold coinage (Fig. 29b) may be the result of the use of non-purified native gold (Gondonneau and Guerra 2002; Jonson et al. 2014). As pointed out by Gondonneau and Guerra (2002, p. 578), the refining of gold is expensive and time-consuming. Producing gold leaf for the manufacture of gold tesserae certainly did not require gold of the same purity as the issue of gold coins and, if available, craftsmen may very well have preferred the use of native gold which was presumably less expensive by weight than the purer gold used in gold coinage. While the use of native gold can account for the increased silver content, copper above 1% is not normally present in native gold, but it does occur, mainly in volcanogenic massive sulphide and porphyry Cu-Au deposits (Liu and Beaudoin 2021). Another possible explanation for the presence of elevated copper in gold leaf tesserae (Fig. 29b) is that the craftsmen modified the colour of the gold leaf by using different gold-silver-copper alloys. Different silver and copper contents can produce a multitude of hues, from whitish in silver-rich alloys to reddish in copper-rich ones (Cretu and Van Der Lingen 1999; Verità 2016). The intense amber and purple colour of the base glass of many of the gold leaf tesserae would seem to reinforce this interpretation.\n\nFig. 29: Compositional characteristics of the gold leaf of some tesserae from the Great Mosque in Damacus and Khirbat al-Minya compared to earlier tesserae from fourth-century Noheda (Spain), sixth-century Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and Byzantine and early Islamic gold coins. (a) Platinum to gold ratios versus gold contents highlight the similarities of Byzantine and Islamic gold sources, while the gold used for late Roman gold leaf tesserae clearly differs; (b) the relative concentrations of copper and silver are strongly correlated in the Byzantine and early Islamic coinage from North Africa, while the silver contents in the tesserae tend to be on average higher than in the contemporary gold coinage; (c) ratios of palladium and platinum to gold separate the Byzantine and Islamic coinage from all gold leaves of mosaic tesserae analysed. Data sources: (Gondonneau and Guerra 2002; Jonson et al. 2014; Neri et al. 2016; Schibille et al. forthcoming). Please note that the graphs include multiple analyses of the same samples.\n\nColours and opacifiers of the mosaic tesserae\n\nWithout going into too much detail, the colouring and opacifying technologies common to the mosaics from Damascus and Khirbat al-Minya reveal a number of interesting patterns. Calcium phosphate, presumably in the form of bone ash or powdered bone, was used as an opacifier mostly in combination with Egypt 1A and Egypt 1Ax glass and only sporadically in the other primary glass groups (Fig. 30a). Calcium and phosphorus are positively correlated and their relative increase corresponds roughly to the ratio of 4:3 (in wt % of their oxides) that is equivalent to the calcium to phosphorus ratio of bone (hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3(OH)).\n\nFig. 30: Main opacifiers detected in the mosaic tesserae from the Great Umayyad Mosque in Damascus.

All SEM images © Léa Brunswic C2RMF.\n\nHydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3(OH)) and β-rhenanite (β-NaCaPO4) were identified by Raman spectroscopy and SEM-EDS in some of the aqua-coloured tesserae with an Egypt 1A composition from Damascus (Fig. 30b), and in the purple, olive and turquoise tesserae from Khirbat al-Minya (Adlington et al. 2020). Tesserae opacified with bone ash are known from the Petra church in Jordan that is broadly dated to the mid-fifth to early eighth centuries CE (Marii and Rehren 2009) and have since been recognised at various Levantine sites as well as in northern Italy (Neri et al. 2017, and references therein). The use of calcium phosphate was recently reported also for the mosaic assemblage recovered from the second phase (724-743 CE) of the Umayyad qasr of Khirbat al-Mafjar (Jericho, Palestine; Fiorentino et al. 2018; Fiorentino et al. 2019a) and the eighth-century Qusayr’ Amra (Jordan; Verità et al. 2017b), both of which post-date the Great Mosque in Damascus and Khirbat al-Minya by a couple of decades.\n\nLead stannate is the yellow pigment and opacifier in the yellow and green tesserae, mostly in the form of euhedral crystals that range in size from a few tens of nanometres to tens of microns and that are often accompanied by small tin oxide (cassiterite) particles (Fig. 30c). Their angular shape indicates that these cassiterite crystals most probably resulted not from a deliberate addition of tin oxide, but from secondary decomposition of the yellow pigments during heat treatment. Tin-based opacifiers have been widely used since the fourth century CE (Bonnerot et al. 2016; Freestone et al. 1990; Neri et al. 2017; Tite et al. 2008). Copper in different oxidation states accounts for the green, turquoise and red colours, with the red samples systematically having higher iron contents than the green and turquoise tesserae. Nanoparticles of metallic copper appear to be responsible for the red tesserae as no cuprous oxide was detected by Raman in the tesserae from Damascus, meaning that the iron acts probably as reducing agent. The metallic copper particles are heterogeneously distributed and seem to precipitate preferentially along devitrification crystals of wollastonite (Fig. 30e-f). The red tesserae are predominantly made of Levantine base glass or one of the minor compositional groups, notably Foy 2.1 and HIMT (Fig. 31). Some of the red tesserae with variable compositions cannot be easily affiliated to any of the primary production groups due to the high levels of additives, especially iron, copper and lead. Different traditions for making deep red glass have existed concurrently since ancient times, utilising different combinations of raw materials (Bandiera et al. 2020; Barber et al. 2009; Schibille et al. 2020b; Shugar 2000). The black samples owe their colour to high levels of iron oxide, with the exception of one black sample of Levantine composition that contains an excess of manganese (MnO = 4.5%). Iron is probably also responsible for the different olive shades (amber, beige, greenish) even though the absolute iron levels remain moderate (about 1%), indicating that the furnace conditions may have played a vital role.\n\nFig. 31: Colour distribution of the mosaic tesserae from the Great Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and Khirbat al-Minya as a function of their La/TiO2 ratios. The horizontal line separates Egypt 1A and Egypt 1Ax from all other compositional groups represented, with the exception of HIMT, which has been omitted for simplicity. Please note that the cut-off (La/TiO2 < 38.5) is an approximation for illustrative purposes and is not meant as an absolute threshold.\n\nThe distribution profile of the different colours shows that aqua, black, green, olive, turquoise and yellow tesserae have been produced from all the different base glasses (Levantine, Foy 2.1, Egypt 1), more or less relative to the total number of samples within each group (Fig. 31). None of the cobalt blue samples (Co > 200 ppm), none of the copper red tesserae and only a single gold leaf sample are of Islamic Egypt 1A or Egypt 1Ax base glass composition. Instead, these samples represent either Levantine I or one of the minor glass groups (Foy 2.1, low alumina, HIMT). The purple tesserae from Khirbat al-Minya containing on average 1.3% MnO were exclusively made from an Egypt 1A base glass. In contrast, the gold leaf tesserae with up to 5% MnO are all made from Levantine or Foy 2.1 compositions. In fact, the gold leaf tesserae with excess levels of manganese tend to be predominantly of the Levantine type, and only a handful of gold leaf tesserae with a Foy 2.1 signature have MnO > 2% (Fig. 32). Manganese oxide in the Foy 2.1 tesserae is associated with iron, indicating the use of an additive that introduced both elements to the glass batch. In contrast, the manganese-rich ingredient used to colour the base of most Levantine gold leaf tesserae with a purplish amber hue did not contain any additional iron impurities. Manganese oxide inclusions were identified by backscattered SEM imaging in a beige-coloured sample (Fig. 30d) to which manganese may have been deliberately added as colourant/decolourant.\n\nFig. 32: Gold leaf tesserae from Damascus and Khirbat al-Minya, in comparison with some purple samples from al-Minya. (a) Iron and manganese oxide concentrations clearly separate the Levantine and Foy 2.1 gold leaf tesserae from one another as well as the purple tesserae. (b) cross-sections of gold leaf tesserae from Khirbat al-Minya embedded in resin and polished: NS-T054/Levantine - 3.06% MnO, 0.72% Fe2O3 (upper left); NS-T051/Foy 2.1 - 3.54% MnO, 0.84% Fe2O3 (upper right); NS-T056/Foy 2.1 - 3.51% MnO, 0.85% Fe2O3 (lower left); NS-T060/Levantine - 3.12% MnO, 0.72% Fe2O3 (lower right).\n\nIn order to develop a purple colour, manganese needs to be present in its oxidised Mn3+ form, whereas Mn2+ is almost colourless. Hence, manganese acts as a decolouriser by oxidising the blue ferrous Fe2+ to the yellowish ferric Fe3+ (Möncke et al. 2014). It has been suggested that the ratio of iron to manganese plays a crucial role in the resulting colour and that an excess of manganese relative to iron oxide is required to create purple glass (Bidegaray et al. 2019). In the case of the purple tesserae from Khirbat al-Minya, more than half have Fe2O3/MnO ratios of about 1, suggesting that the oxidation state of manganese is more decisive than its absolute concentration and its relative amount compared to iron oxide (Fig. 32). Prolonged heat treatment may have aided the transformation of Mn(II) to Mn(III) (Möncke et al. 2014), an effect documented in the twelfth century by Theophilus in his De Diversis Artibus (Brepohl 2013). Theophilus describes the colour change after two hours of heat treatment from a yellow/tawny flesh-like colour to a light purple, which further intensifies into a red purple (purpura rufa) after four additional hours of heating (Brepohl 2013, Book II, chapter VIII, p. 150). What we can conclude from the colouring and decolouring properties of manganese is that the redox conditions during the secondary working procedures of the purple and the Levantine gold leaf tesserae with a purple tinge must have been highly oxidising. The lower melting and working temperatures of Egypt 1A compared to Levantine glasses may in fact have benefited the formation of oxidised Mn3+ and lower absolute amounts of manganese may thus have been necessary.\n\nLittle is known about the sites and the organisation of secondary production of mosaic tesserae: where the glass for the tesserae was coloured and whether intermediate so-called glass cakes from which the tesserae were ultimately cut were formed in the same workshops. In the context of tesserae from Damascus and Khirbat al-Minya it was observed that different colours with an Egyptian 1A and Egypt 1Ax base glass may have been produced in the same secondary workshop, and that this workshop is more likely to have been located in Egypt, since the Levantine and Egypt 1A compositional glass groups remain well separated (Adlington et al. 2020). Even though it has been shown that Levantine and Egyptian primary production groups were occasionally processed in the same secondary workshop to make vessels without being extensively mixed (Freestone et al. 2015b), it is unlikely that the two glass types were used simultaneously in the same tesserae workshop. Given the selective use of Levantine glass for certain colours (mostly cobalt blue and gold leaf tesserae, but also red), workshops specialising in tesserae-making must have existed in the Levant also, but some re-use of older Levantine tesserae is likely as well. Levantine glass as a base material for mosaic tesserae has been identified in mosaics from various late Roman (e.g. Schibille et al. 2018b) and Byzantine contexts (Freestone et al. 1990; Neri et al. 2017; Schibille and McKenzie 2014), occasionally indicating colour preferences. However, as Ian Freestone observed (2020), outside the Levant Egyptian base glasses such as Foy 2.1 were generally more common than Apollonia-type Levantine I glass as early as the sixth and seventh centuries. This observation can be confirmed using an extensive data set from the sixth-century church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. Of over 300 mosaic tesserae analysed, including red, blue and gold leaf tesserae, only about 5% correspond to a Levantine base glass, while the overwhelming majority are of a Foy 2.1 composition (unpublished data). Hence, it is unclear at present whether mosaic workshops were still active in the Levant in the late seventh or early eighth century CE and what the extent of the output of Levantine mosaic workshops was in general. What can be said is that Egyptian mosaic workshops were in full swing throughout the late antique and into the early Islamic periods. Vast material resources were required for the various ambitious Umayyad building projects and decorative programmes of the early eighth century, surpassing anything seen elsewhere in the Mediterranean at the time (James 2017, p. 261). Early Islamic monuments such as the Great Mosque in Damascus are the visual representation of a new world order, a materialisation and visualisation of Umayyad power and Muslim triumph (James 2017, p. 263; Flood 2001, pp. 214-216). The large expanse of wall mosaics was part of this visual rhetoric to assert the political and economic power of the Umayyad caliphate. The mosaics are, above all, an expression of the ability of the Umayyad dynasty to mobilise the necessary economic and material resources from all corners of the caliphate (see the discussion in George, 2021, particularly chapter 6).\n\nThe last hurrah of natron-type glass in the Levant\n\nThe procurement of mosaic assemblages in Damascus and Khirbat al-Minya mirrors common trends in the supply and consumption patterns of glass in the early eighth century in Syria-Palestine. The compositional characteristics of numerous domestic assemblages in Syria-Palestine revealed a general diversification and fundamental transformation in the supply of glass during this period (Phelps et al. 2016). Specifically, the presence of Apollonia-type Levantine I glass declined significantly; Bet Eli‘ezer-type Levantine II glass occurred for the first time; and relatively large quantities of Egyptian glasses were imported in the form of Egypt 2 (Phelps et al. 2016). There is some uncertainty in the early dating of these Egypt 2 finds from Syria-Palestine. According to our investigations of precisely dated early Islamic glass weights, the production of Egypt 2 glass began no earlier than the last quarter of the eighth century CE, and other studies have confirmed that the Egypt 2 base glass type is typically associated with Abbasid glass assemblages, meaning the second half of the eighth century at the earliest (Schibille et al. 2019). Despite the uncertainty surrounding the dating of the Syro-Palestinian glass finds (Phelps et al. 2016), the overall chronological developments proposed by Phelps and colleagues are corroborated by our findings from the mosaic assemblages of Damascus and Khirbat al-Minya. The Great Mosque of Damascus in particular provides an exact point in time for the changing trade patterns between Egypt and the Levant. The import of considerable quantities of Egyptian glass to Syria-Palestine accordingly began as early as the first decades of the eighth century, when Levantine glass of the Apollonia type receded. It must be kept in mind, however, that mosaic tesserae represent specialised products and that the manufacture of and trade in vessel glass could follow a different temporal trajectory. This is suggested by two independent pieces of evidence: we have established that Egyptian glass has been used more frequently for the manufacture of tesserae since the sixth century and, secondly, as far as I am aware there are only a very few examples of vessels made from either Egypt 1A or Egypt 1B outside Egypt. The Damascus mosaics may therefore reflect the situation of tesserae-glass production rather than the manufacture of and trade in glass more generally. A more systematic synthesis of the base glass of different types of artefacts and optical properties may not only shed light on the extent of the markets for Egyptian and Levantine glasses and their transformation, but may also provide some indication of secondary working practices.\n\nNo plant ash glasses are linked unequivocally to the original early eighth-century architectural materials from the Great Mosque in Damascus. A small number of plant ash tesserae that we identified probably stem from later restorations that are known to have been carried out by the Abbasids in the ninth and/or tenth centuries, by Seljuk, Ayyubid and Zengid rulers in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and again during the Mamluk period in the thirteenth century (Leal 2020). Window glass fragments from Khirbat al-Minya with a plant ash signature are very probably of Mesopotamian origin (Adlington et al. 2020). Phelps and colleagues have tentatively dated six plant ash glass vessels from various Palestinian sites to the middle of the eighth century (Phelps et al. 2016). If correct, this would mean that these findings are the earliest Islamic plant ash glasses ever found in the Levant. Upon closer inspection, however, the dates attributed to these six objects cover a much wider range from the mid-eighth to the early ninth and up to the tenth centuries (supplementary table in Phelps et al. 2016). If the earliest occurrence of plant ash glass is to be argued for, then clearly the latest possible date of the time span needs to be applied, not the earliest. Taking a more cautious approach, the earliest securely dated Islamic plant ash glasses in the Syro-Palestinian tradition can then be attributed to al-Raqqa in Syria (Henderson 1995; Henderson 1999; Henderson et al. 2004).\n\nThe twin cities of al-Raqqa and al-Rafiqa on the banks of the Euphrates in northern Syria were relatively minor towns during the Umayyad period, but rapidly developed into a sprawling urban complex, including industrial and commercial areas, during the early Abbasid caliphate (Heidemann 2006). The site was chosen as the new caliphal residence and seat of government by the Abbasid caliph Hārūn al-Rašīd (796-808 CE) at the end of the eighth century. Excavations conducted in 1992 and 1993 yielded evidence of several glass furnaces for primary production as well as the secondary working of glass at Tell Zujaj that, according to the archaeologists, supplied both the caliphal residence and the urban population during the late eighth and early ninth centuries CE (Heidemann 2006; Henderson 1995; Henderson 1999; Henderson et al. 2004; Henderson et al. 2005a; Henderson et al. 2005b). In 2010 another ninth-century tank furnace for the primary production of glass was discovered nearby, at the site of Tell Abu Ali, together with a circular glass furnace with an unknown purpose (Khalil and Henderson 2011). Four different compositional glass groups have been defined that are associated with the glass processing installations at Tell Zujaj, one being a natron glass, while the other groups exhibit the characteristics of early Islamic plant ash glasses (Henderson et al. 2004). Unfortunately, none of the remains from Tell Abu Ali have yet been analysed or published.\n\nThere is no analytical or archaeological evidence for the primary production of natron-type glass at al-Raqqa (Henderson et al. 2005b). Rather, the natron glass from al-Raqqa appears to be closely related to Levantine glasses from Apollonia and Bet Eli‘ezer in terms both of their chemical composition and isotopic signature, even though the Raqqa glass does not exactly match the material from either primary production site in the Levant (Fig. 33). The al-Raqqa glasses tend to have somewhat higher lime and lower soda levels than the glass from the primary furnaces at Apollonia. The lime lining of glass furnaces can occasionally contaminate the glass batch and thereby augment the lime concentrations (Chen et al. 2021), while prolonged or repeated heating can result in the loss of sodium (Freestone 2015). It is likely that cullet was the main raw material for further processing at al-Raqqa, and we can assume that glass cullet and raw glass derived from more than one primary production site (Henderson et al. 2005b). This explains the compositional variability of the natron-type glass group recovered from al-Raqqa.\n\nFig. 33: CaO/Al2O3 and Na2O/SiO2 confirm the compositional similarities between the natron glass from al-Raqqa and Apollonia-type Levantine I. Data sources: (Brill 1999) for Jalame; (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2008b) for Apollonia; (Brems et al. 2018; Freestone et al. 2000; Freestone et al. 2015b; Phelps et al. 2016) for Bet Eli‘ezer; (Henderson et al. 2004; Henderson et al. 2009b) for al-Raqqa.\n\nThe earliest plant ash glasses from the Bilâd al-Shâm\n\nRaqqa group 1 & Raqqa group 4\n\nThe situation is very different where the plant ash glasses from al-Raqqa are concerned. There are clear indications of the local primary production of different plant ash glass types in the ninth, eleventh and twelfth centuries CE (Henderson et al. 2004; Henderson et al. 2005a; Henderson et al. 2020). Three different plant ash glass groups were defined, of which one (Raqqa 4) has a very large compositional spread in terms of both the silica-related elements as well as the plant ash component. This group was interpreted by Julian Henderson and colleagues as evidence of experimentation (Henderson et al. 2004; Henderson et al. 2005a). Independently of the exact nature and extent of primary glass production at al-Raqqa, there is strong evidence that some plant ash glasses were produced at Tell Zujaj and/or Tell Abu Ali in the early ninth century CE. This makes Raqqa one of the earliest attested Islamic plant ash glass production sites in Greater Syria. The failed attempt to produce glass from a mixture of Levantine coastal sand and plant ash that may underlie the great glass slab at Bet She‘arim in Israel dates from about the same time (Freestone and Gorin-Rosen 1999; Freestone et al. 2000). These findings lend support to the idea of experimentation with raw materials and glass recipes in the early phases of Islamic plant ash glassmaking. This also shows that the manufacture of plant ash glasses may have commenced in Greater Syria as early as in the last decade of the eighth or beginning of the ninth century, thus about a century or more before its start in Egypt.\n\nTwo different plant ash glass types (Raqqa 1 and Raqqa 4) were supposedly produced in ninth-century al-Raqqa, but they display very different compositional characteristics. One fragment of frit-like material from Tell Zujaj was analysed and corresponds to Raqqa 4 at the high end of the magnesium and the low end of the potassium oxide contents (Fig. 34a). Regardless of whether the fragment in question is indeed glass frit or merely unreacted batch material (Brill 2005a; Henderson 1999; Henderson et al. 2004; Phelps 2017), its presence implies that this type of glass was indeed manufactured at al-Raqqa. Almost 55% of the analysed glasses from the ninth-century contexts at Tell Zujaj correspond to the highly variable Raqqa 4 type, and about 30% correspond to Raqqa 1. While the latter is consistent with what is commonly associated with an eastern Mediterranean (Syro-Palestinian) Islamic soda-rich plant ash glass, Raqqa 4 exhibits features typical of Mesopotamian glasses with high magnesium and lower calcium and phosphorus levels (Fig. 34). In fact, glass from the Persian Empire dating to the Parthian and Sasanian periods tends to have very similar compositions, characterised by high magnesium concentrations and on average lower lime and phosphorus contents, and a wide range of alumina concentrations. The high magnesium levels of these Mesopotamian glasses may derive from the use of specific plants as raw material and the influence of the magnesia-rich alluvial deposits of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers (Freestone 1991; Freestone 2006). The use of plant ash from the quaternary fluvial system of the Euphrates valley is supported by the strontium isotopic signature of most of the Raqqa plant ash glasses (Henderson et al. 2020).\n\nFig. 34: Compositional characteristics of the ninth-century plant ash glasses from al-Raqqa in comparison with Levantine material of Tyre-type plant ash glass. (a) Potassium and magnesium oxides typically separate Syro-Palestinian from Mesopotamian plant ash glass; the dashed line shows the proposed division between the two regional production areas; (b) ratios of potash to phosphorus reflect differences in the plant ash component, while the alumina levels showcase the relatively pure silica source underlying Raqqa Type 1 compared to glass from Tyre and Raqqa Type 4. Data sources: (Henderson et al. 2004; Henderson et al. 2009a) for al-Raqqa; (Freestone et al. 2000; Freestone 2002; Phelps 2017) for Tyre-type glass.\n\nThe similarities with Parthian and Sasanian glasses strongly suggest a transfer of skills and Mesopotamian glassmaking traditions to early Islamic al-Raqqa rather than an independent development. It is perfectly possible that Hārūn al-Rašīd brought glass workers experienced in Mesopotamian plant ash glass production to al-Raqqa to take charge of the development of the local glass industry that served the newly established caliphal residence. Textual sources indicate that this may well have been common practice. The ninth-century polymath, al-Ya‘qūbī, for instance remarked that the caliph al-Mu‘tasim had ordered skilled artisans, including ‘people who make glass’ to come from every town in the empire to his newly founded city of Samarra in 836 CE (Northedge 2014, p. 50). The construction of a new caliphal residence required the supply of considerable material resources within a relatively short period of time, and the Raqqa 4 glass type may reflect exactly this process. Glass workers familiar with Mesopotamian recipes and raw materials may have gathered and established primary glassmaking at al-Raqqa. Raqqa 4 may thus not be considered proof of the emergence of a new soda-rich plant ash recipe as such, but rather a continuation (and refinement) of Mesopotamian practices and traditions. It is noteworthy that al-Muqaddasī does not mention glass in connection with al-Raqqa in his tenth-century geography of the world of Islam (Miguel 1993), stating that ‘It [al-Raqqa] abounds in Nature’s blessings, and yields the best soap and olives in plenty’ (Ranking and Azoo 1897, p. 230). By contrast, al-Muqaddasī does not fail to point out that ‘From Tyre come sugar, glass beads and glass vessels both cut and blown’ (Ranking and Azoo 1897, p. 296). So, at least in the tenth century, al-Raqqa was not renowned for its glass production, which may imply that it was not a major producer of raw glass or glass objects destined for a wider market.\n\nThe Raqqa 1 glass group on the other hand tells a different story, and may very well represent one of the earliest examples of a new Syro-Palestinian soda-rich plant ash glassmaking tradition that makes use of different raw materials, recipes and possibly even technologies. It is a relatively homogeneous group. According to my calculations, Raqqa 1 contains magnesium and potassium oxides between 2% and 4%, an average soda content of 13.8%, lime at 8.25%, and relatively low titanium oxide at 0.07% (Table 5). It is thus remarkably similar to the glass produced in tenth- and eleventh-century Tyre (Freestone 2002) and Levantine plant ash glasses from Israel (Phelps 2018) in terms of the plant ash component. Raqqa 1 and the glass from Tyre also share a common strontium isotope signature (Fig. 35; Freestone et al. 2009a; Henderson et al. 2009a; Henderson et al. 2020). This suggests that soda-rich plant ash may have been prepared following a similar formula, probably starting from related alkaline plants that grew in geologically comparable environments (Barkoudah and Henderson 2006; Ganio et al. 2013). In a recent study of the isotopic characteristics of early Islamic plant ash glasses, Julian Henderson and colleagues (Henderson et al. 2020) discovered that the majority of ninth- to fourteenth-century plant ash glasses from various sites in Greater Syria, including al-Raqqa, Tyre, Damascus and Beirut, have matching 87Sr/86Sr signatures compatible with the use of plants from Syrian semi-desert areas (Fig. 35).\n\nNa2O\n\nMgO\n\nAl2O3\n\nSiO2\n\nP2O5\n\nK2O\n\nCaO\n\nTiO2\n\nFe2O3\n\nTyre (n=9)\n\n12.7\n\n3.52\n\n1.84\n\n65.2\n\n0.34\n\n2.25\n\n11.0\n\n0.09\n\n0.54*\n\nstdev\n\n1.2\n\n0.33\n\n0.3\n\n1.5\n\n0.05\n\n0.19\n\n2\n\n0.01\n\n0.05\n\nRaqqa 1 (n=35)\n\n13.8\n\n3.43\n\n1.21\n\n67.5\n\n0.29\n\n2.44\n\n8.25\n\n0.07\n\n0.53\n\nstdev\n\n1.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.22\n\n1.5\n\n0.05\n\n0.17\n\n1.3\n\n0.01\n\n0.22\n\nBanias (n=13)\n\n12.6\n\n2.68\n\n1.03\n\n70.5\n\n0.27\n\n1.85\n\n8.57\n\n0.14\n\n0.39\n\nstdev\n\n0.4\n\n0.09\n\n0.17\n\n1.1\n\n0.04\n\n0.18\n\n0.90\n\n0.03\n\n0.09\n\n*excluding the dark blue samples BM7230-12\n\nTable 5: Average compositions and standard deviations of the glass samples from Tyre (Phelps 2017), ninth-century Raqqa 1 (Henderson et al. 2004), and Banias (Freestone et al. 2000).\n\nRaqqa 1 differs from more or less contemporary glass assemblages from the Levant in the elements related to the silica source, such as aluminium and titanium as well as the neodymium isotope ratios (Fig. 35) that are much lower in the glass from al-Raqqa than in that from both Tyre and Banias (Freestone et al. 2009a; Henderson et al. 2009a; Leslie et al. 2006). New isotopic data from sand sources collected from various beaches on the Lebanese coast (Beirut, Sidon, Ghazieh, Tyre) as well as inland sites including the Euphrates river suggest that quartz-rich Syrian desert sand was used for the production of the al-Raqqa glass instead of a more local silica source from the Euphrates (Henderson et al. 2020). The Syrian geographer, Yâqût al-Hamawî (1179 – 1229 CE), mentioned in his Kitab Mu‘Jam al-buldan (Dictionary of Countries) that the ‘fine white sands’ from around Jebel Bishri, located between al-Raqqa and Palmyra (see Fig. 2), were collected and used for the production of glass in Aleppo (cited in Heidemann 2006, p. 40). The isotopic data confirm that sands like these could have been used for the production of early Islamic glass, including that of al-Raqqa (Henderson et al. 2020). The careful selection of silica sources that were rich in quartz and depleted in accessory minerals and feldspars for the primary production of glass has been observed in the context of early Abbasid Samarra (Schibille et al. 2018a).\n\nFig. 35: Levantine-type plant ash glasses from al-Raqqa (Raqqa 1), the primary workshop at Tyre, the secondary workshop at Banias and the Serçe Limani shipwreck. (a) Iron and aluminium oxide show a strong positive correlation in the Banias glasses and underpin the close relationship between Tyre-type glass from Israel and the finds from the Serçe Limani shipwreck, while confirming the singular nature of Raqqa 1; (b) strontium and neodymium isotope signatures separate the glass from Banias and the Serçe Limani from both Tyre and al-Raqqa glass in terms of the plant ash component, while confirming the use of a coastal silica source; Tyre and al-Raqqa share common strontium isotopes, but differ considerably with respect to their neodymium isotope signatures. Data sources: (Henderson et al. 2004; Henderson et al. 2009a) for al-Raqqa; (Degryse et al. 2010a; Freestone et al. 2000; Freestone 2002; Phelps 2017) for Tyre-type glass and Banias; (Brill and Stapleton 2012; Henderson et al. 2020) for Serçe Limani; please note that for Brill's data nominal neodymium values have been assumed between -3.1 and -5.8 in steps of 0.3 to compensate for the lack of Nd isotopes. (Degryse 2014; Henderson et al. 2020) for sand sources.\n\nIf the dating and interpretation of Tell Zujaj as a primary production location of Raqqa 1 glass in the ninth century are correct, then Raqqa 1 indeed represents the beginnings of a specifically Islamic soda-rich plant ash glassmaking technology that was to become typical of the Syro-Palestinian region. It also proved to be long-lasting. Over 70% of the glass analysed from the eleventh-century glassmaking complex at Tell Fukhkhar matches Raqqa 1, and only about 14% of the later glasses have Raqqa 4 compositions (Henderson et al. 2004). A possible scenario, then, is that the transformations in glass production at al-Raqqa, and particularly the choice of the raw materials, were inspired by Mesopotamian glassmakers, who may have initially produced Raqqa 4 glasses. These developments eventually led to the establishment of the Raqqa 1 recipe. The evidence for this is that Raqqa 1 is a relatively tightly clustered glass group that was apparently manufactured for several centuries to come. It is more probably the end-result of an established and well controlled glassmaking process and recipe rather than an early stage of experimental development. How the raw materials were selected and when or why they changed remain elusive, but the overlap between Raqqa 1 and Raqqa 4 in terms of their strontium and neodymium isotopic signatures implies that the raw materials must all have been derived from the same geographical region with few exceptions. Some of the Raqqa 4 samples are closer to the Sasanian groups, indicating that not all of these glasses were produced locally (chapter 3).\n\nGlass from the primary production site of Tyre\n\nReconstructing the evidence of early Islamic plant ash glass production in Syria-Palestine proves challenging as only limited analytical data on well contextualised and precisely dated vitreous material are available. This task is further complicated by the fact that glass assemblages from consumer sites are often made up of a variety of compositional groups that often originate from different geographical regions. An example of the complexities arising from the multifaceted provenance of samples is illustrated, for instance, in the highly diverse collection of glasses retrieved from al-Hadir in northern Syria. As judged from the archaeological evidence, the site dates to between the second half of the seventh and the thirteenth centuries CE, and importantly, no residual material from the pre-Islamic period has been found (Foy 2012b). The glasses that were analysed are more narrowly dated to the seventh to ninth centuries. The glass finds from al-Hadir thus provide a relatively precise window into early Islamic consumption patterns of vitreous materials not disturbed by earlier or later occupations at precisely the time when the transition to a plant ash recipe might be expected. No clear distinction could be made between the Umayyad and Abbasid phases on typological grounds, as Umayyad vessel types emerged from all levels of occupation (Foy 2012b). Of the 44 fragments that were analysed by Bernard Gratuze, 24 were of a natron-type base glass, sub-divided into three main compositional groups which included Egypt 1A and 1B, Bet Eli‘ezer-type Levantine II and a heterogeneous group of mostly mixed and recycled glasses (Gratuze and Foy 2012). The remaining 20 samples were soda-rich plant ash glasses with a relatively wide compositional range. Bernard Gratuze and Danièle Foy separated the plant ash glasses into two groups based on their alumina and lime concentrations (groups 4 and 5 in Gratuze and Foy 2012). At the time of publication, the authors tentatively proposed an Egyptian provenance for the glasses of al-Hadir group 4 based on their heavy element signatures (Y, Ce, Zr), and mixed origins for group 5 (Gratuze and Foy 2012). With more analytical data on contemporary plant ash glasses now available, it has since transpired that all the plant ash glasses from al-Hadir are consistent with Mesopotamian glassmaking recipes, indicated above all by their elevated chromium to lanthanum ratios. Hence, there are no indications of the presence of plant ash glasses with Syro-Palestinian characteristics among the archaeological record of al-Hadir up to and including the ninth century CE. In fact, no soda-rich plant ash glass with a Syro-Palestinian signature that can be safely attributed to before the turn of the ninth century CE has been found anywhere. Based on all the currently available analytical data taken together, there is no conclusive evidence for Levantine plant ash glass production prior to the ninth century CE, and it can be inferred that the beginning of Islamic plant ash glassmaking in Greater Syria belongs firmly to the ninth century CE.\n\nThe only known primary production sites for plant ash glasses in the Levant dating to the early Islamic period are four large furnaces at Tyre, Lebanon (Aldsworth et al. 2002; Freestone 2002), and possibly the large slab of glass found in situ at Bet She‘arim, Israel (Freestone and Gorin-Rosen 1999). The glass slab from Bet She‘arim will not be considered further as it represents a failed attempt at glassmaking and the available analytical data are limited. The glassmaking activities at Tyre are generally dated to the tenth and eleventh centuries based on associated finds, but a somewhat broader life-span extending into earlier and/or later periods cannot be entirely ruled out (Aldsworth et al. 2002, p. 65). The capacity estimate of Tyre Furnace 1, which is the largest furnace and the only one with obvious evidence of glassmaking, is 37 tons, whereas the smallest, Furnace 3, would have produced an estimated 13 tons of raw glass (Aldsworth et al. 2002). All four furnaces appear to have been used several times. There can be no doubt that raw glass was manufactured here on an industrial scale and destined for an export market. As early as the tenth and certainly by the eleventh century, Tyre had become famous for its glass, which was exported to various countries, including Egypt. This is reflected in written sources such as al-Muqaddasī’s geography (Ranking and Azoo 1897, p. 296) and the Cairo Geniza (Gil 1997, p. 238), and has been confirmed by our recent analytical evidence of tenth- and eleventh-century Islamic glass weights from Egypt (Schibille et al. 2019).\n\nThe Tyre plant ash glasses share some features with Levantine natron-type glasses with respect to the silica-related elements, namely their relatively low titanium and iron oxide contents (Tables 4 and 5). Neodymium isotopes furnish further proof that the Tyre plant ash glasses, like Levantine natron glass, were made from Levantine coastal sands, despite the relative heterogeneity of their isotopic composition (Degryse et al. 2010a). The authors attributed these variations to stratigraphic differences in the sediments that had formed over time at the isthmus of Tyre and that are assumed to vary according to climatic changes (Degryse et al. 2010a). The eNd values range from -7 to -3 and are perfectly consistent with the isotopic signatures of Levantine coastal sands, and in this respect clearly differ from the plant ash glasses from al-Raqqa (Fig. 35b; Henderson et al. 2020). As regards the elements associated predominantly with the plant ash, the glasses from Tyre contain moderate alkali and alkaline earth elements, phosphorus (Fig. 34) and relatively high lime concentrations (Table 5). The strontium isotopic signature of the Tyre samples, indicative mainly of the plant ash, is remarkably similar to that of Raqqa 1 and Raqqa 4, matching the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of halophytic plants sampled from inland areas of Syria and the Lebanon (Fig. 35; Freestone et al. 2009a; Henderson et al. 2009a; Henderson et al. 2020; Leslie et al. 2006). It appears, then, that Tyre glass, like Levantine natron glasses, was made from coastal sand and a plant ash comparable to the majority of the plant ash glass from al-Raqqa. We can therefore assume that the plant ash used for the production of the Tyre and al-Raqqa glass derived from a shared geographical region dominated by a common geology (Henderson et al. 2009a; Henderson et al. 2020). The trade in plant ash is a feasible explanation for these common characteristics (Ashtor and Cevidalli 1983; Freestone et al. 2009a; Leslie et al. 2006). The trade in Syrian plant ash is well documented for later periods (Ashtor and Cevidalli 1983) and, as suggested previously by Ian Freestone and colleagues (Freestone et al. 2009a), the similarities between Raqqa and Tyre glass indicate that plant ash may have been traded already during the ninth and tenth centuries. As a result, the same plant ash could have been combined with very different silica sources, which adds another layer of complexity to the identification and definition of production groups.
