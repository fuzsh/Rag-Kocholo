They were struck by the Umayyad Caliphate, an Islamic empire that stretched all the way from Spain to eastern India at its peak.\n\nIslamic coins and art usually avoided displaying imagery of humans or other living beings, a practice known as aniconism. Because of this, these coins have only Arabic script and lack portraits or other designs commonly associated with ancient coins from other cultures like the Greeks or Romans.\n\nThe Umayyad Caliphate existed during a time known as \"late antiquity,\" which was a transition period between ancient times and the Middle Ages. It was the second of four major Islamic caliphates to arise after the death of Muhammad just 30 years before its formation."
