        "text": "Thanks to @dougsmit 's post on representative coinage, i decided to look on vcoins today after failing miserably to find a coin for Granada for the last 3 months, and managed to snag one to complete my representative series on Islamic coinage of Iberia.\n\nThis is by no means an extensive and comprehensive catalog of Islamic coinage of Iberia, but rather a fair and simple representative illustration of the many phases of Islamic occupation of Iberia.\n\n#1: Umayyads come in and conquer and rule Iberia for the greater part of 40 years before the dynasty collapses. It is after the Iberia conquest (when they gain access to the Spanish silver mines) that they start to mint silver dirhams...and in great abundance compared to the more limited silver coinage from before.\n\n#2: Umayyad Caliphate collapses and the Umayyads retreat to Spain, while the Abbasid keep the rest of the Islamic world under their control. From Spain the Umayyads rule a culturally and artistically rich kingdom (albeit much diminished in power.) That is represented by this dirham of the Caliphate of Cordoba.\n\n#3: Umayyad power in Iberia collapses around 1020 CE and chaos ensues as warring taifas fight each other and suffer setbacks against the Christians. The Almohad Caliphate take the opportunity to invade Iberia and conquer the warring taifas, and create a buffer against the advancing Christian kings. This is represented by this Almohad dirham.\n\n#4: After many setbacks at the hands of the Christians, the Muslims of Iberia grow dissatisfied with Almohad rule and in 1232 revolt and found the Emirate of Granada as a tributary kingdom under the Christian kings. This is the last great Islamic kingdom in Iberia, which collapses in 1492 thus ending 700 years of Islamic presence in Iberia. This period of the Emirate of Cordoba is represented by this 1/4 dirham of Granada."
