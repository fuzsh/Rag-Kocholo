        "text": "All photos courtesy of Will Ellis / DDreps\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka found a buyer this month for their five-story Harlem townhouse, which first hit the market last August for $7,325,000. As first reported by the New York Post, the home at 2036 Fifth Avenue is in contract for more than $7,100,000, likely setting a new record for a townhouse sale in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood. The home, constructed in 1908 as a bed-and-breakfast, measures 8,000 square feet and 20 feet wide.\n\nThe couple paid nearly $4,000,000 for the turn-of-the-century home in 2013 and completed a 14-month renovation by interior designer Trace Lehnhoff in collaboration with architecture firm Povero & Compan to reconfigure the rooms into a single-family home, as Harris and Burtka told Architectural Digest in 2016.\n\nAccording to the Post, the property was first listed last August but pulled from the market after a storm caused water damage.\n\nOn the parlor floor, you’ll find 12-foot ceilings, original dark-wood wainscoting, and a gas fireplace. One end holds a music room and the other, a restored vintage bar sourced from an old bar and an adjacent butler’s pantry. Double doors lead to a terraced garden, the first of four outdoor spaces at the home.\n\nThe sprawling living room, dining room, and chef’s kitchen are all on the third floor, as well as floor-to-ceiling glass doors that lead to a deck.\n\nThe primary bedroom suite boasts lots of closet space, a gas fireplace, a marble-adorned bathroom with a double vanity, and a private deck with a jacuzzi.\n\nThree additional bedrooms, a laundry room, and Harris’ “hidden office” can be found on the top floor, as 6sqft previously noted. According to Architectural Digest, the room is located behind a trick door that opens when the “eyeball of a magician on a vintage poster is pressed.”\n\nAt its crown, the home features a rooftop with a wood pergola, an irrigation system, and an al fresco-ready area with plenty of space for a big dining table and a built-in gas grill.\n\nThe couple used the garden level as a production office and a 10-seat home theater. Below that, there is a rec room, wine cellar, gym, and storage space.\n\nIf the townhouse brought in near the asking price as reported, it likely is a new record in the neighborhood. Just last month, a home at 32 Mount Morris Park sold for $6.4 million, setting the townhouse record for Harlem, as The Real Deal reported.\n\n[Listing details: 2036 5th Avenue at CityRealty]\n\n[At Compass by Vickey Barron and Pacey Barron]\n\nRELATED:\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka list their five-story Harlem townhouse for $7.3M\n\nNeil Patrick Harris drops $5.5M on East Hamptons’ notorious ‘orgy estate’\n\nNeil Patrick Harris gives a holiday tour of his Harlem brownstone\n\nGet Insider Updates with Our Newsletter!\n\nEmail(Required)\n\nBy providing your email address, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

The couple picked up the property at 2036 Fifth Avenue in 2013 for nearly $3,600,000 and conducted a thorough renovation of the historic home, which was constructed in 1908 as a bed and breakfast. The new neighborhood record breaks the one set in April by the home at 32 Mount Morris Park, which sold for $6,400,000.\n\nDetails here\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka list their five-story Harlem townhouse for $7.3M\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka are selling their five-story townhouse in Harlem for $7,325,000. The couple paid $4,000,000 in 2013 for the 19th-century home at 2036 Fifth Avenue, which was renovated by interior designer Trace Lehnhoff in collaboration with architecture firm Povero & Company. Designed for entertaining, the five-bedroom townhouse has a theater, music room, wine cellar, a rear garden, third-floor deck with an outdoor jacuzzi, and an irrigated rooftop.\n\nTake the tour\n\nVIDEO: Neil Patrick Harris gives a holiday tour of his Harlem brownstone\n\nBy Dana Schulz\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and hubby David Burtka first made real estate headlines when they purchased a $4 million Harlem brownstone in 2013, setting a neighborhood record. They then spent over a year renovating the five-story residence at 2036 Fifth Avenue to be the perfect family home for their twins Gideon and Harper (now five years old) and two dogs. Last year, the couple invited Architectural Digest in for a tour, showing off their elegant but fun design choices, impressive art collection, and restored architectural features. They've now opened up their home again, this time for Vogue's 73 Questions (h/t Apartment Therapy), complete with Christmas decorations.\n\nWatch the video here\n\n$599K Harlem condo has penthouse views and outdoor space, without the penthouse price\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nAtop the Style Condominium at 51 East 131st Street, a 21st-century addition to the vibrant East Harlem neighborhood, this one-bedroom condominium is a compact top-floor residence with private outdoor space and renovated interiors. Asking $599,000, the 658-square-foot home has unobstructed penthouse views and light to match, without the penthouse price.\n\nTake the tour\n\nFor $6.75M, this park-facing East Side condo is for sale or rent, with 10 rooms to use however you wish\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nOptions are many in this 3,225-square-foot condo on Manhattan's Museum Mile between East Harlem and Carnegie Hill; the combination of two apartments resulted in a collection of rooms that work as bedrooms (as many as six), playrooms or entertaining spaces, depending on your needs. What you can't change: a coveted spot on Central Park and amazing panoramic views of the park and Conservatory Gardens. Asking $6,750,000, this sun-filled home can be found in the Emery Roth-designed 1920s building at 1200 Fifth Avenue known as The Park View. Not ready for a commitment? You can rent the pretty pre-war home for $25,000/month.\n\nTour this parkside pad and visualize the options\n\nEast Harlem street where Cicely Tyson grew up has been renamed after the pioneering actress\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nA stretch of street in East Harlem was renamed Cicely Tyson Way in honor of the late trailblazing actress. Tyson, who grew up in a fifth-floor railroad flat at 178 East 101st Street, died last January at the age of 96. Throughout her 70-year award-winning career, Tyson defied racial stereotypes and became famous for her depiction of strong Black women in theater and film.\n\nDetails this way"
