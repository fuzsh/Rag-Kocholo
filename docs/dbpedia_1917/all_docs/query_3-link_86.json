Today, we‚Äôd like you to meet Casey Arzola, Talent Acquisition Manager for HelloFresh US in our Boulder, CO Headquarters. Casey, a second-generation latino, is an alum of Fort Hayes University. He started his career with HelloFresh in 2022 . Casey has made such an impact on his team and a huge difference in LIMES. We sat down with him to get his perspective on his upbringing & and what Hispanic Heritage Month means to him: ‚ÄúHispanic Heritage Month is a fantastic month to celebrate our heritage and showcase all the great people that make up the community in the US. While being able to tell stories from different backgrounds, and origins. Latinos today continue to advance communities across the country as small business owners, veterans, teachers, and public servants, among many other professions. My parents were both born in Mexico. My Mother and Father immigrated together to Chicago in search of a better life. My Mom left Chicago to be closer to her sister in Kansas. Like most Hispanic families we were around, we had strong close-knit family ties with cousins/relatives. Growing up around family was very important to our family. Celebrating all different occasions, quincea√±eras, birthdays, holidays, etc. My mother has been a huge influence in both my brother's and I's lives. Coming from Mexico and not knowing any English, she taught herself to read and write English by reading and taking in the information we were given to learn English. A very strong-willed woman, who is no doubt one of the hardest-working people in my life. Her resiliency and work ethic was showcased to us while growing up. It still stands in our attitudes, in how we approach everything in life. As we got older, my mother became an Assistant Principal at a GED school, helping people like herself achieve their goals of getting the GED. I'm proud of the values she instilled in me as a man but more importantly the value of what it means to never give up and to always strive for more!.‚Äù Thank you for sharing your story Casey! #DEIatHF #HHM"
