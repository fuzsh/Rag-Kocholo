        "text": "With real life married couple Marin Mazzie and Jason Danieley taking over the lead roles of Diana and Dan Goodman in the Pulitzer Prize-winning musical Next to Normal, we wanted to know what other Broadway couple you'd like to see share the stage. The votes are in, and a whopping 31% of fans want to see Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka duet. Burtka appeared opposite Bernadette Peters as Tulsa in the 2003 revival of Gypsy and also has a reccuring guest spot on Harris' hit TV series How I Met Your Mother. Harris' Broadway credits include Assassins, Proof and Cabaret and he will direct a star-studded production of Rent at Los Angeles' Hollywood Bowl this August.\n\nSpeaking of Rent...second place goes to Idina Menzel and Taye Diggs with 19% of the votes. The couple met while starring together in the 1996 Tony and Pulitzer Prize winning musical as frenemies Maureen and Benny. Diggs later joined his wife for a brief 2003 run as Fiyero while Menzel starred as Elphaba in the hit musical Wicked. Third place goes to another couple who've previously shared the stage: Four-time Tony winner Audra McDonald and Will Swenson. The pair, who appeared together in the 2007 revival of 110 in the Shade, landed 12% of the votes.\n\nThanks for voting!"
