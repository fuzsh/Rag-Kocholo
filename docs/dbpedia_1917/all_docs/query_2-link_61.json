        "text": "After listing in August 2021, coming off the market for repairs, and popping back up for sale this April, the Harlem townhouse of Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka has finally sold. While sources told the NY Post in May that the home was in contract for above $7.1 million, the deal ended up closing this month for $6.995 million. Don’t worry though, even this sum cinched the title of most expensive single-family home sold in Harlem.\n\nTaking a closer look at the record-setting, five-story brownstone, it’s no surprise the property was a hot ticket. The 8,000-square-foot home may have been built in 1908, but the celebrity sellers’ recent renovation combined high-end new features with its authentic details. The new owner can enjoy modern perks like Wolf and Sub-Zero appliances in the kitchen, but also original millwork and fireplaces. In the primary en suite, Nero Marquina marble shines, while its black-paned shower door and double mirrors provide a trendy, industrial feel that fits perfectly in New York City.\n\nHappily, the home has its quirks, too. According to a 2015 profile by Architectural Digest, Harris’ top-floor office is accessed only through a trick door, where one must push the eyeball of a magician against a vintage poster. Just as beguiling is a vintage bar sourced from an old hotel, a wine cellar, and other character-rich details that give the rooms personality.\n\nCoincidentally, as Neil Patrick Harris decamps the Harlem home, his new Netflix show Uncoupled is unfolding throughout the Big Apple. Harris, Burtka, and their two children won’t be straying too far, however, as they are reportedly spending more time at their Hamptons residence."
