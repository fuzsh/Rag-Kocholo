        "text": "Actor Neil Patrick Harris has been married to his husband David Burtka since 2014. The couple has a beautiful family, with two children.\n\nBurtka, born in 1975, is also an American actor, known for his roles on How I Met Your Mother and The Play About the Baby.\n\nThe LGBT+ celebrity couple first met in 2004 while Burtka was seeing someone else, according to Out magazine.\n\nSo, while Harris found fellow actor Burtka “adorable,” they were initially just friends.\n\nWhen did Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka start dating?\n\nIt wasn’t until one week after Burtka became single, that same year, that the pair finally went on their first date.\n\nThey went to the cinema to watch an Angelina Jolie movie, Taking Lives.\n\nAfter that first date, the pair were inseparable.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris, David Burtka and How I Met Your Mother\n\nAs we all know, Harris is best known for his role as Barney on How I Met Your Mother.\n\nBut what you may not know is that Harris’ husband Burtka also starred in the hit sitcom.\n\nThe couple moved to LA so that Harris could work on the set in 2005.\n\nOne year later, Burtka joined the series. He played Lily’s high school boyfriend and colleague Scooter. According to IMDb, he appeared in seven episodes to up the show’s last year in 2014.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka had twins completing their family in 2010\n\nSome years later, the gorgeous couple decided that it was time for them to have kids.\n\nIn the interview with Out, Harris explained, “We both agreed that if we wanted to have kids, we didn’t want to do it super late in the game.”\n\nThey had twins on October 12, 2010. Describing how the siblings were conceived, Burtka told Oprah, “Two eggs, two embryos, one of mine, one of his.”\n\nThey had one beautiful boy, named Gideon Scott, and a stunning girl named Harper Grace.\n\nThey tied the knot in Italy\n\nIn September 2014, three years after announcing their engagement, the same-sex couple got married in Italy.\n\nA spokesperson said: “We happily confirm that Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka were married in Italy in an intimate ceremony surrounded by their close friends and family.”\n\nHowever, at that time, same-sex marriage was not legally recognised in Italy so it is likely that the pair had filed paperwork elsewhere to recognise the marriage."
