        "text": "The 8,000 square foot brownstone was built in 1908 but was converted into a contemporary single-family home by Harris and David Burtka.\n\nHARLEM, NY — Actor Neil Patrick Harris and husband David Burtka are selling their 8,000 square foot Harlem brownstone, leaving behind the five-bedroom, six-bath residence for their primary home in East Hampton, the realtor handling the listing confirmed on Tuesday.\n\nThe single-family home, located at 2036 Fifth Ave. between 125th and 126th streets, is listed at $7.325 million and is being listed by Compass. The Italianate-style home was built in 1908 and features four bedrooms and a library and den that could be converted into a fifth bedroom. The property carries an annual tax bill of $19,712, according to Vickey Barron, who is listing the property along with Pacey Barron, who is her colleague and daughter.\n\nThe outdoor space features nearly 2,000 square feet of private space, including a terraced rear garden, a third-floor deck, an outdoor Jacuzzi off the primary bedroom suite and an irrigated roof deck with a pergola and barbecue.\n\nThere are three gas fireplaces in the house. On the third floor is a living room with a fireplace, a formal dining area, large kitchen equipped with a pantry, custom cabinets and Caesarstone countertops with a marble backsplash, a spokesperson for Compass said Tuesday. Other rooms include a music room, home theater, laundry room and full basement with a gym, wine cellar and a playroom for Harris and Burtka's 10-year-old twins, Gideon and Harper.\n\nHowever, the couple definitely left their mark behind on the place, according to a New York Times story. Harris, who starred in “How I Met Your Mother” after being introduced to the world as “Doogie Howser, MD”, set up an office space on the top floor of the residence. The office is hidden behind a trick door, which opens by pressing the eyeball of a magician on a vintage poster, according to a 2015 profile of the residence by Architectural Digest.\n\nDespite the allure of the office and its homage to the world of magic, Harris declined to provide too many details about the space, to The Times.\n\n“That’s a, umm, secret,” Harris told the newspaper in an email, “hence the, umm, name of the room.”\n\nThe secret room contains original art from the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland, more magic posters and props, Compass officials said. The Times reported that Harris and Burtka purchased the home in 2013 for about $3.6 million.\n\nCompass officials said in an email Tuesday that the property is a “storied building (that) has had many lives serving as a bed-and-breakfast, speakeasy for millworkers and music schools for girls. Most architectural changes in the renovation had to do with creating a single-family flow to the interiors, the real estate agency said.\n\nThe spectacular home features original molding and millwork among other details such as massive ceiling heights. The townhouse is perfect for art collectors, architecture buffs and design enthusiasts.\n\nThe Times reported that Harris and Burtka spent 14 months converting the brownstone into the single-family home that is being listed now. Harris said that he and Burtka wanted to make the property contemporary and unique while still respecting the historical aspects of the brownstone.\n\n“The Harlem brownstone holds some of our dearest and fondest memories,” Harris told The Times. “Our kids have spent the majority of their lives there. It’s a legitimately special place.”\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts."
