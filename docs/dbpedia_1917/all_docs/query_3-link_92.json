        "text": "Any relationship takes work, whether it’s between friends, parents and children, or romantic partners. It’s important to put commitment into any kind of interpersonal dynamic, and Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka have been doing just that for years now. They recently celebrated their 15 th anniversary as a couple, and Neil spoke to Entertainment Tonight about how they make it work. “I think the secret to a relationship is just perseverance, you know?” he said. “It’s not always pretty… but he’s pretty, so it makes it easy.”\n\nNeil and David both adorably shared Instagram posts marking the occasion earlier this month. Neil’s post featured a picture of him with his husband in Iceland. “My first date with David was 15 years ago today, and we’ve been nearly inseparable ever since,” he gushed. “I’m so, so grateful to this gorgeous man for giving me his heart, his shoulder, his strength, his lust, his laughter, his joy. He’s an actor, chef, author, singer, producer, and the most wonderful, selfless parent I’ve ever seen. A sextuple threat, if you will. And I most certainly will. Happy 15 th Anniversary, @dbelicious. You keep making all my dreams come true.”\n\nDavid shared a similar post, and revealed a surprising secret about the couple’s relationship: they met in passing on the street! This happened in the pre-Tinder days, but we’re so incredibly happy for these two, so pleased they found each other, and this is such a hopeful fact, especially in an era in which it seems like it’s impossible for couples to meet off dating apps.\n\nMORE: Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka on what they love most about each other"
