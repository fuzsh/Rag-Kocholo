He's not playing on my team, but he has a boyfriend.'\"\n\nIn the same piece, Burtka added that his long-distance relationship at the time \"was sort of on the rocks.\"\n\nThe two hung out for the first time at an \"American Idol\" viewing party thrown by a mutual friend, and Harris wrote that he \"couldn't take my eyes off\" Burtka.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMid-2000s: They both moved to LA for Harris to film \"How I Met Your Mother.\"\n\nWhen Harris took on the role of Barney Stinson on the CBS classic \"How I Met Your Mother,\" which first aired in 2005, the couple moved to Los Angeles, California, together so he could shoot the show.\n\n\"I assumed the show would be a short chapter,\" Harris told Architectural Digest in 2015. \"But the plan was always to come back to New York when the show ended and raise our family.\"\n\nBut the sitcom ran for nine seasons and nearly 10 years, coming to an end in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 2006: Harris publicly came out as gay in a People magazine interview.\n\nHarris publicly came out as gay in an exclusive 2006 interview with People magazine amid \"speculation and interest in my private life and relationships.\"\n\n\"...
