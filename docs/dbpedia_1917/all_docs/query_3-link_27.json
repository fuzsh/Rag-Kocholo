And she said, 'David? He's not playing on my team, but he has a boyfriend.'\"\n\nIn the same piece, Burtka added that his long-distance relationship at the time \"was sort of on the rocks.\"\n\nThe two hung out for the first time at an \"American Idol\" viewing party thrown by a mutual friend, and Harris wrote that he \"couldn't take my eyes off\" Burtka.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMid-2000s: They both moved to LA for Harris to film \"How I Met Your Mother.\"\n\nWhen Harris took on the role of Barney Stinson on the CBS classic \"How I Met Your Mother,\" which first aired in 2005, the couple moved to Los Angeles, California, together so he could shoot the show.\n\n\"I assumed the show would be a short chapter,\" Harris told Architectural Digest in 2015. \"But the plan was always to come back to New York when the show ended and raise our family.\"\n\nBut the sitcom ran for nine seasons and nearly 10 years, coming to an end in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 2006: Harris publicly came out as gay in a People magazine interview.\n\nHarris publicly came out as gay in an exclusive 2006 interview with People magazine amid \"speculation and interest in my private life and relationships.\"\n\n\"...

David wanted to stop for some reason that I didn't quite get,\" Harris wrote. \"I thought he wanted to get some booze or something.\"\n\n\"And then he got on one knee and proposed, and I was so freaked out by it that I said, 'Yes,' but I didn't know what it meant,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2008: Harris proposed to Burtka in Santa Monica a year later.\n\nA year after Burtka popped the question to Harris, the \"How I Met Your Mother\" star also proposed to his \"better half\" on Valentine's Day, according to their essay.\n\n\"The callus on my right hand is long-formed ...

I owe it to myself. I owe it to my kids, to be there, 100%.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017: Burtka said he and Harris go to couples therapy.\n\nThe two have spoken about the ups and downs of their relationship.

You have to overcome those issues and move on.\"\n\nIn May 2017, Burtka told Life and Style magazine that he and Harris attend couples counseling to keep their relationship strong.\n\n\"We go to couples therapy,\" Burtka said. \"Not that there's anything wrong, but it's nice to sort of just talk to someone who is a mediator.

Thankfully, all went according to plan.\"\n\nRead next\n\nRelationships Love Marriage\n\nAdvertisement"
