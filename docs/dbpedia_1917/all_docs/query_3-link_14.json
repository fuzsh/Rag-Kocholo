        "text": "There's a lot to take in at David Burtka's sprawling, suburban-sized kitchen. There's the antique dinner bell mounted on the wall. (He bought it on a trip to Italy with husband Neil Patrick Harris.) There's the miles of pristine white marble countertops, and, sitting on top of the counter when I visit, a huge vacuum sealer. There's the deck off the side of the kitchen that hosts a super fancy grill. (A grill! In Manhattan!)\n\nBut it's the chore chart I can't stop staring at. Its vibe is cute—but firm. Harper and Gideon, Burka's two children with Harris, each get their own column, and their chores are written out in cheerful, brightly-colored chalk, with boxes to be ticked once the work is complete.\n\nI'm baffled that Harper and Gideon have to do regular housework as if they are mere mortals, and not the astronomically cute children of famous New Yorkers. But Burtka draws a hard line. I learn that Harper doesn't get to go to the premier of Aladdin on Broadway that night because she threw a temper tantrum in the morning. He wants to give in. He wants her to go. But he's holding strong.\n\nThat attitude—cheerful cuteness mixed with hardline discipline—is also the one Burtka takes towards cooking. As I watch him slice carrots and sous vide chicken breasts, I notice how organized and regimented he is, all while maintaining a bouncy delightfulness I can only manage after three cold brews. A peak inside the refrigerator reveals stacks of prepped ingredients that can be thrown on the skillet at any time for an impromptu dinner party. And in general, the vibe of watching Burtka cook is like watching food television: everything is organized and clean, everyone has a sparkling personality.\n\nMaybe it's the acting background that makes him so sparkly. Burtka was a successful actor for years, but eventually he found the hustle exhausting. So after his mom passed away, he decided to go to culinary school. (Cooking had always been something that had connected them.)\n\nNow, Burtka has a cookbook dedicated to entertaining, aptly titled Life Is A Party. It's a seasonal guide to throwing parties of all kinds, complete with recipes and entertaining tips. His parties have star-studded guest lists that very few people will be able to replicate. And yet, the book—and my visit to his home kitchen—is not just aspirational, but inspirational. Hanging out in Burtka's kitchen, I begin to think that, given the right tools, I could do what Burtka does. I can cook without stress. I can throw a good party. I can sparkle!\n\nWell, I can try, anyway. And the first step to cooking like Burtka is having a kitchen like Burtka. Below are the tools Burtka leaned on to cook me lunch. I'll be outfitting my own kitchen with them shortly; I've been assured that the sparkle will soon follow.\n\nShun 8” Chef's Knife\n\nBurtka describes this lightweight Japanese knife as pure artistry. \"It's got a beautiful wood handle and it stays sharp for a really long time,\" he says. He also thinks it's the perfect all-purpose size. You can use this knife to do everything from prepping vegetables to breaking down a whole chicken. And Burtka thinks you might consider buying one for your friends, too. \"You know, I hate when I go over to other peoples' houses and their knives are so dull you can't cut through anything,\" he says."
