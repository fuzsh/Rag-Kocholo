        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka are two of Hollywood’s most loved actors and one of the best well-known gay celeb couples. They’re also authors, producers, and parents.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris is best known for his TV roles in Doogie Howser, M.D., How I Met Your Mother, and A Series of Unfortunate Events, as well as his musical stage roles, while David Burtka is both an actor and a professional chef.\n\nBut how exactly did the two meet? Who proposed to who? What is their family like?\n\nThe Real Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka\n\nLet’s dive into nine fascinating facts about Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka that the duo usually keeps under wraps.\n\n1. Harris Couldn’t Take His Eyes Off of Burtka When They Met\n\nThe day they met each other, Neil Patrick Harris was single and assumed that wouldn’t be changing anytime soon.\n\nMeanwhile, David Burtka was currently in a long-distance relationship that wasn’t going so well. He was going between New York and LA and knew that it was on the rocks.\n\nThe two met with a mutual friend, and Harris initially believed that the two of them were together.\n\nHarris explained to Out magazine that in the beginning, he didn’t want to interfere in their relationship. Yet whenever they were together in a group, he stammered and couldn’t stop staring. He kept hoping that “the stars would align”.\n\n2. Opposites in Some Ways, Identical in Others\n\nSome people believe that opposites attract, while others think that you should be similar to the person you’re with. Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka manage to check both of those boxes!\n\nPhysically, the two are very similar. They are the same height, weight, body size, and shoe size. They even share a wardrobe.\n\nYet in terms of personality, they’re quite different. Harris explains that he is more introspective, and makes decisions methodically. Burtka, on the other hand, is a doer, rather than a thinker.\n\nBoth Harris and Burtka are also Gemini.\n\n3. They Each Proposed to One Another\n\nOnce they started dating, Harris and Burtka became inseparable. When apart, they talked on the phone and texted constantly, and became dependant on each other, referring to one another as their lifeline.\n\nIn 2007, 3 years after they met, Burtka proposed to Harris on the street where they met for the first time. Harris initially didn’t understand what he was doing (he thought Burtka wanted to buy booze) but was ecstatic.\n\nOn Valentine’s Day in 2008, Harris then proposed to Burtka in Santa Monica.\n\n4. They Had Their Wedding in Italy\n\nAfter being together for more than 10 years, Harris and Burtka tied the knot in Perugia, Italy. The ceremony was small and intimate, attended by close friends and family.\n\nThe two wore tuxedos designed by Tom Ford, and also had a live performance by Elton John.\n\nHarris commemorated the day with an adorable photo.\n\n5. The Two Take Communication to the Next Level\n\nWhat’s the most important part of any relationship? Ask any marriage counselor, and odds are they’ll say communication.\n\nYet Harris explains that if their relationship has a fault, it may be over-communication. At times, he can be cranky, and if he’s distracted, the crankiness comes out more directly than it should.\n\nBut in times like those, they talk things out. Usually, whatever problem or issue they have is resolved in minutes.\n\n6. They Have Two Biological Children\n\nIn 2010, Harris and Burtka welcomed fraternal twins into their family, a girl, and a boy. Burtka explained how the twins were conceived in an interview with Oprah: “Two eggs, two embryos, one of mine, one of his.”\n\nHarper Grace, the girl, is named after Harper Lee, the author of “To Kill a Mockingbird” (one of their favorite books). Their son, Gideon, is named after Gideon Rubin, an artist they collect.\n\nThe family lives together in Harlem, NYC, with their dog, Gidget.\n\n7. Family Time Is Essential\n\nBoth Harris and Burtka are devoted parents, working hard to be the best dads around.\n\nIn the morning, the family eats breakfast together. Even daughter Harper enjoys cooking, often making a pancake recipe of Burtka. It’s then off to practice the piano or learn some other skill.\n\nAfter lessons, the family heads to the park with Gidget. Later, after dinner, the family spends time reading together before bed.\n\nBoth Harris and Burtka work hard to teach important values to their kids, such as hard work, perseverance, and empathy.\n\n8. The Two Still Make Time for Each Other\n\nAlthough they are excellent parents, Burtka and Harris make sure they still have time to enjoy with each other.\n\nWhile the kids are occupied at lessons, they like to work out together. Later on, when the kids are sleeping, they like to watch TV together. The last show they watched was Game of Thrones.\n\nThe two also still enjoy traveling and going on adventures, balancing their own relationship while being hardworking fathers.\n\n9. They Admit That Their Relationship Isn’t Perfect\n\nOne thing that the couple is very open about is the fact that their relationship isn’t perfect. They don’t pretend to be a Hollywood dream couple and acknowledge the ups and downs that have been present.\n\nBurtka explains that in any relationship, there will be bad times. While the good times will outweigh the bad, obstacles still need to be overcome in order to make it work.\n\nBoth Harris and Burtka explain that putting love ahead of drama is what’s kept them together all this time.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka: A True Power Couple\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka are an enviable couple: handsome, successful, and devoted to one another. Yet the couple is also honest about the hard parts present in any relationship. What keeps them together? Love, and wanting to share all that life has to offer with each other.\n\nDo you know any other fun facts about David Burtka and Neil Patrick Harris?
