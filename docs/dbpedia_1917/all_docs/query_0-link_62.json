        "text": "David Burtka is a frequent Wondercade contributor (who, NPH wants it to be known, works for hugs). When not helping his husband Neil on Wondercade, David stays somewhat busy acting, cooking, writing, parenting and, occasionally, sleeping.\n\nAs an actor, he appeared on Broadway in Sam Mendes’ production of Gypsy and Edward Albee’s The Goat or Who is Sylvia? and the Off-Broadway productions of Beautiful Thing and Bad Boy Johnny. His television and film credits include American Horror Story: Freak Show, The West Wing, CSI: NY, How I Met Your Mother, A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas and Hollywood Ending. A chef who’s trained under Thomas Keller and Cat Cora, he’s a frequent presence on the Food Network and countless other cooking shows from Top Chef to Rachael Ray. His first cookbook, Life is a Party, was published in 2019."
