        "text": "\"We're super happy to lead by example, but even to define ourselves in any kind of leadership position I think is awkward,\" Harris said. \"I cringe when I hear people say they consider themselves role models.\"\n\nBurtka agreed, \"We really don't do anything. We take care of our kids. We're in a relationship. We love each other, but we don't go out of the way to stand on a soapbox, like Neil said.\"\n\nOn a much bluer lighter note, Harris said he expects there to be a sequel to his summer blockbuster Smurfs movie.\n\n\"The thing made like 500 million bucks, so I'm sure that they're clamoring to do something,\" he said, before cracking, \"I'm contractually obligated to do 14 more Smurf movies. So you'll see me in one when I'm 70.\"\n\nNo doubt he and Burtka will still be together then."
