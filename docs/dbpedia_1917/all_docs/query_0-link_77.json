        "text": "CHICAGO, Aug. 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- This summer, families are spending more time at home and looking for creative ways to entertain and connect with their families. To inspire summertime family fun, Keebler® has collaborated with chef and actor David Burtka to create recipe twists on the iconic seasonal treat: the s'more. A hallmark of the season, Keebler is inviting families to get creative and share their at-home interactive s'mores-making experiences to celebrate National S'mores Day today, Monday, August 10.\n\nUsing the beloved cookie brand's classic Fudge Stripe Cookies, Keebler and David Burtka have re-created – and expanded – summertime s'mores with two custom National S'mores Day magical Keebler creations.\n\nDavid Burtka and Keebler Fudge Stripe S'mores Recipes:\n\nThe S'mores Cookie Bar: Burtka's take on the summer fireside staple takes this family-friendly makeover to the kitchen with an easy and delicious cookie bar that screams s'mores traditional flavors but with a fun-to-eat twist. The bar form combines Keebler Fudge Stripe cookies – the iconic shortbread drizzled and dipped in real Keebler fudge – and adds toasted mini marshmallows and luscious dark chocolate crumbles. Best of all, the instructions are easy for the whole family to be part of the fun!\n\nThe S'mores Ice Cream Sandwich: Nothing says summer quite like ice cream and s'mores, and with this recipe you don't have to choose! This creative take on the classic treat features toasted mini marshmallows folded into vanilla ice cream blended with Keebler Fudge Stripe cookies bits and sandwiched between two scrumptious Keebler Fudge Stripe cookies.\n\n\"This summer, families are finding creative ways to elevate the everyday by creating magical moments at home – and Keebler is here to help make those little moments of joy even more meaningful by upgrading one of summer's most-loved treats: the s'more,\" said Ryan Nolan, Brand Manager at Ferrara, makers of Keebler cookies. \"Leveraging unique recipe spins from our partner and chef David Burtka, such as substituting our family-favorite Fudge Stripes Cookies for traditional graham crackers, not only takes the classic dessert to a new level, but also encourages families to come together to make the treat their own.\"\n\nWith upgraded combinations, flavors and textures to the classic s'more, the summer dessert staple becomes new again.
