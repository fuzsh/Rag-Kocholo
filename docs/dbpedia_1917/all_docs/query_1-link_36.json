Then, Oprah sits down with Neil and David, who have been a couple for eight years, as they speak candidly about what it was like for them growing up gay, Neil's decision to come out in Hollywood, its impact on his career and their decision to have children. They open up about their private struggles in their relationship as David, both a trained chef and actor, says it isn't easy being in a relationship where one person is more famous and successful than the other. They talk about the pressures of living in Hollywood and knowing the entire world is watching their modern family to see if they can go the distance. Oprah gets a rare and intimate look at how this loving modern family functions. Want more podcasts from OWN?
