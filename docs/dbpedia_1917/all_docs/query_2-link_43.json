        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris and his husband, David Burtka, are selling their Harlem home, a refurbished 1908 brownstone that they filled with whimsical collectibles and furnishings, from a robot parrot to the bar booth on “How I Met Your Mother,” the TV sitcom where both actors had starred. There’s even a “secret” room hidden on the top floor.\n\n“We think of it as Willy Wonka meets the Magic Castle,” Mr. Harris said jokingly in an email about the eclectic décor.\n\nThe two are sad to be leaving the brownstone, at 2036 Fifth Avenue, between 125th and 126th Streets, but their primary residence now is in East Hampton. (They bought a 13.5-acre estate there four years ago.)\n\n“The Harlem brownstone holds some of our dearest and fondest memories,” Mr. Harris said. “Our kids have spent the majority of their lives there. It’s a legitimately special place.”\n\nMr. Burtka felt much the same way about the house: “It will always have a soft spot in my heart.”\n\nThe asking price for the house is $7.325 million, with $19,712 in annual property taxes, according to Vickey Barron, a broker with Compass who is listing the brownstone with Pacey Barron, her colleague and daughter."
