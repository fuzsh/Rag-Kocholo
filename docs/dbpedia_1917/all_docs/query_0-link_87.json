        "text": "The description “Willy Wonka meets the Magic Castle” conjures up all kinds of images. But it doesn’t come to life until you see photos of actor Neil Patrick Harris’ refurbished Harlem brownstone.\n\nFor starters, there’s the bar booth, straight off the set of “How I Met Your Mother” — the TV sitcom Harris starred in with husband David Burtka. Or the magic and sideshow memorabilia, like the robotic parrot and player piano. There’s even a “secret” room on the top floor.\n\nFormerly a bed-and-breakfast, the actors converted the property into a single-family home in 2013. Located at 2036 Fifth Avenue, between 125th and 126th Streets, the five-story Italianate-style residence was meticulously renovated by award-winning architect Jeffery Povero and interior designer Trace Lehnhoff.\n\nOriginal features include carved moldings, oak floors, dark wood wainscoting, and an oak, sycamore, and ash staircase.\n\n“We wanted to respect the history of the space, of the area, and yet make it feel contemporary and creative and accessible,” Harris told the New York Times.\n\nThe 8,000-square-foot property also sports 12-foot ceilings, loft-like interiors, and four outdoor spaces — a rarity in New York City.\n\n“The roof deck is like a backyard in the sky,” according to Compass listing agent Vicky Barron.\n\n“The whole house lends itself to entertainment.” The asking price is $7.325 million.\n\n“There are just so many places to entertain,” says Burtka, who is also a chef.\n\nA pro-grade kitchen features every amenity — think custom cabinetry, a massive island countertop with farmhouse sink, two six-burner Wolf ranges, Sub-Zero refrigerator/freezer, separate wine refrigerator, and oversized pantry.\n\nA pair of floor-to-ceiling glass doors open to an intimate outdoor deck complete with a built-in grill for al fresco dining.\n\nGuests often gathered around the back parlor’s vintage wood and glass bar, salvaged from a Connecticut hotel. Burtka’s book, “Life Is a Party” showcases many of these get-togethers.\n\n“The Harlem brownstone holds some of our dearest and fondest memories,” says Harris.\n\n“Our kids have spent the majority of their lives there. It’s a legitimately special place.”\n\nThe main entrance is through a grand front door atop a classic stoop. The five-bedroom, six-bath home also has a home theater, workshop/gym, wine cellar, and a playroom for the couple’s 10-year-old fraternal twins, Gideon and Harper.\n\nAn office on the garden level has a separate entrance, which Barron says might appeal to some homebuyers.\n\n“If they have an office at home and you have people that need to come and go every day, they can enter without disturbing your private home, which is a huge value.”\n\nAnd back to that secret room. Hidden behind a trick door on the fifth floor, it opens by pressing the eyeball of a magician on a vintage poster, according to a 2015 profile of the brownstone by Architectural Digest. Inside, there’s original art from the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland, more magic posters, and props.\n\nIn an email to the Times, Harris, didn’t divulge too much.\n\n“That’s a, umm, secret,” he said, “hence the, umm, name of the room.”"
