        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka have signed on to executive produce “A House Is Not a Disco,” an upcoming documentary about a year in the life of Fire Island Pines. The project is from Brian J. Smith, the star of “Sense8,” who is making it his directing debut.\n\nHarris is an Emmy and Tony Award-winning actor and singer whose credits include “How I Met Your Mother,” “It’s a Sin” and “Gone Girl.” Burtka is an actor and chef who has appeared on “The West Wing,” “Crossing Jordan” and on Broadway in “Gypsy” and “It Shoulda Been You.” In a statement, Smith thanked the celebrity power couple for their involvement.\n\n“I am incredibly grateful for Neil and David’s support as we bring the magic of Fire Island Pines to audiences nationwide,” Smith said. “Neil and David both instantly connected with the vision we had when we set out to tell the story of this community, and they continue to bring fresh, new perspectives to the table from the many years and memories they share from the Pines.”\n\nThe film unfolds in the queer beach town in the middle of a renaissance as a new generation of Millennial homeowners journey embrace life in the inclusive community while grappling with environmental challenges. It follows a large cast of eccentrics, activists, drifters, and first-timers as they reflect on the legacy of The Pines while preparing the village for the biggest threat it has faced since the AIDS crisis: rising seas caused by climate change.\n\n“Through the years, the Pines has represented so much more to us than just a summer destination,” said Burtka and Harris. “This community we love is illustrated with such grace and style through Brian’s direction, and we both jumped at the opportunity to help amplify this project.”\n\nThe film premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film & TV Festival and has screened at the Sarasota Film Festival and Cleveland International Film Festival. At this year’s OUTShine Festival, it won the Audience Award for best documentary.\n\n“A House Is Not a Disco” is next set to open the 2024 NewFest Pride Series on May 30 at New York’s SVA Theater. The film will also screen as part of the 48th annual San Francisco International LGBTQ+ Film Festival (Frameline48) this June.\n\nThe documentary is produced by Jeremy Truong and Joseph Conforti. Additional executive producers include Kathleen Flood, Andrew Kirkley, and Justin Lacob. Matthew Fifer also serves as an associate producer."
