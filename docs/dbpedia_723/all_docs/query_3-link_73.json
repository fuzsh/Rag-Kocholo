        "text": "Originally known as Schneider’s Crossing, North Aurora began with the arrival of two brothers in search of a location to build a saw mill. John Peter and Nicholas Schneider left their home near Frankfurt on-the-Rhine around 1823, arriving in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1824. The brothers found work as carpenters and millwrights.\n\nIn 1832, John Peter and his family traveled westward via rivers and Lake Michigan to the state of Michigan. They took up their journey again in 1833, and got as far west as what is now called Naperville. Nicholas joined his brother shortly thereafter, and they built a sawmill at the mouth of Blackberry Creek near Yorkville. Nicholas remained on the property, but John continued on into the Fox River Valley, settling with his family on the east side of the river on a hill near the site of the present Village Hall. In 1837, a dam was constructed to provide power to the mill John Peter had built. The commercial activity surrounding the mill attracted more families to the area. By the turn of the 19th century approximately 300 people lived in town. In 1905, North Aurora (the name of the local post office) was incorporated as a village.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Aurora became a hub of industry and railroading. Some of the railroad workers chose to live in North Aurora, triggering the Village’s moderate but steady growth until the 1960s. The 1960s ushered in an era when the character of the whole Fox River Valley changed; it transformed from a relatively local, freestanding economy where residents lived and worked into a more suburban experience where residents commuted to job centers located east of the valley. At first, residents had access to jobs through the commuter train system. Later they drove to job sites that had moved out of the metropolitan core and to areas surrounding the expressways. The movement of jobs continues to this day, and it continues to generate residential growth in North Aurora."
