        "text": "\"Timing is everything\" and \"if it's meant to be, it will be\" are familiar sayings many of us have pondered. Last night, at 10:00 PM, everything clicked for me as I completed my first semester with Vanderbilt Peabody College. This journey is just beginning, but I'm committed for the long haul because of the program's exceptional quality and impact. - A year ago, I faced disappointment when I wasn't accepted into a local doctoral program in Business Administration. After some reflection, I resumed my search and decided to aim high by applying to Vanderbilt's Leadership and Learning in Organizations program. As Wayne Gretzky said, \"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\" To my surprise and delight, I was accepted. - Last night's culmination was a testament to this program's value. My team and I collaborated with a local nonprofit in Orlando, designing a dashboard to help track metrics more effectively. This experience was both challenging and rewarding, offering me the meaningful work I'd been seeking. - Life often presents us with unexpected turns, but my path became clear last night. Trusting the process, even when it's unclear, has been invaluable advice for me. Sometimes, all it takes is faith, trust, and a little pixie dust to find your way. #vanderbilt #vanderbiltuniversity #peabody #peabodycollege #leadership #learning #doctoralprogram #doctoralstudent #development #professionaldevelopment #impact #time #faith #trust #pixiedust #disney\n\nI am beyond blessed. Tonight, I moderated a conversation entitled, \"A Roadmap to Graduate School: Conversations on Navigating the Ebony and Ivory Tower - Part 1: Is Graduate School for Me?\" Thank you Dr. Xavier Burch, Ph.D., Dr. Asha Ralph, Dr. Sarah Pedigo Kulzer, and Ms. Bria Cross, M.S for sharing with the students your experiences answering the question, \"Is Graduate School for me?\" Your candid and authentic testimonies about some of the challenges you faced pursuing graduate school, how you overcame those challenges, and what you gained from turning their obstacles into sources of intrinsic motivation were informative, engaging, and inspiring. Below are a few words of wisdom that the panelists shared with students who were contemplating graduate school. \"Practice self-care and develop a work-life balance.\" \"Maintain faith and trust in God.\" \"Know who you are, what your passions are, and align yourself with mentors and institutions who will nourish those passions\" \"Three D's: Discipline, Dedication, and Decisiveness.\" All in all, this conversation was just the beginning of many more conversations that will prepare our students to pursue graduate degrees in their respective fields of interest and navigate this terrain, both in the Ivory and Ebony towers.\n\nNumerous people have asked me, \"Why didn't you participate in any of Clayton State's commencement ceremonies this past weekend since you are a 2023 graduate?\" First, I want to congratulate all my peers who graduated this semester!! Despite my absence, my spirits and prayers were with you all. But for me, I know that my work isn't done. I've caught my second wind and am focused on what's in store for me next year. So, instead of celebrating, I'm still studying and preparing like I have four more years left. And I will do that every four years for the rest of my life. ðŸ˜Ž I've studied a lot of great athletes, entertainers, politicians, and academics, and they all have one thing in common; They are obsessed with learning from their losses and mistakes and enjoy utilizing their earned wisdom on new challenges while inspiring others. And how well they do that under pressure defines their character and leadership style to the masses. For me, receiving a college degree is just the result of being someone who wanted to spend 1,460 days working on their writing, communication, and time-management skills to prepare themselves for a new set of challenges that requires the addition of even more skills. I've shown people that I can spend 1,460 days achieving a goal against all odds while inspiring and communicating to others that they can do the same. The most beneficial thing I got from being a college student at Clayton State University was the opportunity to practice and receive valuable feedback on my efforts from excellent researchers and practitioners in their respective fields. When I started college, I didn't have an endgame. I had a game plan. That's the difference between me and most people, in and out of college. Besides, I'll be back in Spring 2024. #Dreamsmadereal #NoLimits\n\nAs I start my second semester of junior year at Baylor University, a wave of emotions washes over me. Yes, I've learned a ton - new skills, diverse perspectives, and the power of stepping outside my comfort zone. But the journey hasn't been without its struggles. As an international student (and for Puerto Ricans, navigating that unique US-international grey line), I've grappled with: â€¢ Adapting to a new culture and educational system. â€¢ Mastering another language and expressing myself fluently in writing and in class. â€¢ Juggling academics, part-time work, and building a new social circle from scratch. These challenges shaped me in ways I could never have imagined. They honed my resilience, fostered resourcefulness, and taught me the value of community. And guess what? These are the very qualities employers crave! So, to my fellow international students and anyone facing unfamiliar territory, let this be a message of hope: You are not alone. Your struggles are real, your strength is admirable, and your resilience is a superpower. Keep pushing forward. Embrace the journey. And remember, \"Quien no conoce sus adversidades no conoce sus propias fuerzas.\" (He who knows not his adversity, knows not his own strength.)\n\nHappy Presidentâ€™s Day! Have you taken pause to reflect on how far weâ€™ve come as a modern society? Itâ€™s quickly forgotten the role that time plays not only in our memories but truly, in every facet of life. Having the ability to read and write were once considered cornerstones of educational achievement whereas in 2022, roughly 40% of American adults had a bachelors degree. The world of today looks vastly different than the world of yesterday and you donâ€™t have to be Nostradamus to predict itâ€™ll look quite different in the future as well. On this Presidentâ€™s Day, letâ€™s look to the past, recognize how far weâ€™ve come, and then tighten our shoes to prepare for the journey forward. One thing is for certain though: Education is the most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in.\n\nAs we count down to graduation, take a moment to meet @CornellDysonSchoolâ€™s Zoe Rich â€˜24 ðŸŽ“ Q: What will you always remember about your time at Cornell? A: What I will most remember about my time at Cornell is the people who made it so incredible. I was lucky enough to meet people from all different corners of Cornell, who have become my best friends. Along with this, my professors offered me so much support and guidance throughout my school career that will no doubt leave a lasting impact. Q: What is the most valuable thing you learned in your time at Cornell? A: The most valuable lesson I learned in my time at Cornell is to always be true to yourself, even if you feel that everyone else around you is doing something different. In my opinion, staying authentic to your values and beliefs is the most important thing you can do. Q: How will you use this lesson or knowledge in the future? A: I plan on using this lesson in the future in both my work and personal life. By prioritizing authenticity, I can make sure that I stay true to myself! ðŸ“¸ Provided by Zoe Rich\n\nLast night, I had the honor of receiving an award that left me both surprised, humbled and forever grateful. Over the past three years, I've had the privilege of helping Belmont University students turn ideas into businesses, and in doing so, I've discovered a timeless truth for myself: time, for me, is measured by what lies in my heart â€” helping people and looking at things differently. In every interaction, every question asked and every challenge faced, my heart has been my compass guiding me for something different. The joy of seeing students flourish isn't marked by my time, but by the genuine connection and impact we can truly make on other's lives around us. My goal and my heart is dedicated to fostering a better future for all of us, and that's what I strive to lead with every day. During my my Nursing School journey, I adopted the habit of asking direct questions, asking 'why' five times â€” a skill crafted in Nursing school and with assistance from one of my clinical instructors. It's a tool that digs deep, unravels layers and helps us understand the true meaning behind the actions and decisions we make. It's about getting to the root, understanding the actual â€˜whyâ€™ behind things. Belmont has allowed me to become a beacon of hope for the future and I carry that responsibility and duty with pride every day. As I reflect on these years, it's astonishing how time seems to stand still, not because it lingers, but because it's filled with moments of witnessing individuals evolve into positive contributors to their networks around them. Triumphs and overcoming challenges are some of my greatest joys in life. I will continue to tread the path less taken, to do what others might shy away from, because it is in these challenges that I believe our greatest opportunities lie."
