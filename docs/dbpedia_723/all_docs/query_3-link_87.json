        "text": "Aurora has always been a progressive, forward-thinking community. In 1881 it was the first US city to have electric streetlights. As a result, the moniker, “City of Lights” was born. North Star research showed a positive connection to the line today and nearly limitless opportunity for reinvention of what it means for the future (not to mention the significant equity Aurora has built in the line). Reinforcing the value of the strapline were recent efforts by competing cities to use the line for their own purposes. Turns out sometimes what you’re looking for really is right in your own back yard."
