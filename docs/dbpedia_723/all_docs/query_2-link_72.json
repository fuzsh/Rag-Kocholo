        "text": "At family gatherings, it is not uncommon for those with long memories to narrate stories of how the family first came to this country, to relate what their childhood was like, or to reiterate war-time or business exploits only partially believed by the listeners. Our lodge is a group of men who form family-like ties as brothers along with their families, encompassing everyone here at this time, and even those who now live in distant states.\n\nAs we gather today, some can recall July 29, 2000, when several lodges merged to form our newly named George Washington 1776 Lodge. On this anniversary of our consolidation, I would like to chronicle the founding of our several consolidated lodges and their history. The number of people that this retelling would encompass is staggering, but I will emphasize just a few major milestones, particularly the buildings that we have inhabited on our journey. Members of George Washington 1776 Lodge stand as inheritors of our various lodge histories as they constitute the foundation of who we are today.\n\nEvery lodge must receive a charter from the Grand Lodge of Wisconsin. The charter number given to the Lodge indicates its age, with low numbers indicating that they were founded long ago. For example, Aurora Lodge #30, which also meets in the Silver SpringMasonicCenter, has a very low number, signifying that it was just the thirtieth lodge chartered in Wisconsin, established in December 1850.\n\nAll of the lodges that joined in the George Washington 1776 Lodge consolidation were much younger than Aurora Lodge, all of which were established in the twentieth century with numbers beginning in the three-hundreds. Listed by length of charter, they are Kenwood Lodge #303 which was charted in 1913; Silver Spring Lodge #337 which was chartered in 1926; Shorewood Lodge #339 which was chartered in 1927; and Brown Dear Lodge #357 which was chartered in 1962.\n\nKenwood Lodge\n\nLike many newly chartered lodges, Kenwood Lodge #303 met in different locations for the first years of its charter, 1913-1916, including Westminster Presbyterian Church, Cottrill Hall of Ivanhoe Temple, and the Guild Hall of St. Mark’s Episcopal Church. Kenwood Lodge erected its own lodge building in 1915 at 2648 N. Hackett Avenue, just behind St. Mark’s Episcopal Church near the Downer Avenue shopping district south of UWM. Kenwood Lodge moved into their three-story highly ornate building in 1916, in the heart of the East Side. The building remains in good condition, having recently been remodeled.\n\nThe dining room of Kenwood Lodge was known as Liberty Hall, showing the patriotic influence that remains today in the naming of the consolidated lodge for George Washington. The lodge building was sold to the ItalianCommunity Center in 1980, before the ICC had its new building on Chicago Street on the south side. The ItalianCommunity Center sold the Kenwood Lodge building in 1990 to the Church in the City, which has an active congregation there today."
