        "text": "Since 1977, the folk at Ach-N-Lou's Pizza Pub have prided themselves as being “a cut above the rest”, serving up calzones, pizzas, and other Italian goods to the people of the Fox River Valley. Known in the Aurora area for their communal, jocular atmosphere, owner and operator Michael Simpson says the hometown feel of Ach-N-Lou's is exactly what they’re after.\n\nSimpson oversees the pizza pub, which operates as a local hang-out, family restaurant, and neighborhood joint equipped with craft beer. Whether Ach-N-Lou's has been a mainstay for you and yours on a Friday night for years or if you’re keen to see what all the marinara is about, Simpson’s spot is ready, ensuring that the ingredients—both for food and customer relationships—remain fresh.\n\n1592 N Farnsworth Ave, Aurora, IL 60505\n\nFind out more about Ach-N-Lous Pizza Pub HERE.\n\nWith work in the insurance industry for two decades, Annie Kinsley’s commitment to Aurora residents can be evidenced by her continued presence not just in her office, but out in the community. Kinsley’s State Farm office opened in the heart of the Fox Valley in 2021, where she knew her own background as an Argentinian immigrant and Spanish speaker could be a valuable resource in the Aurora area.\n\nWorking with a small but vital team who share the mission for community engagement is how Kinsley’s office makes connections in the local area last. “Let’s collaborate!” is a refrain frequented by Kinsley as she makes contact with residents at neighborhood events and community fairs.\n\nFor this reason, getting a hold of Annie Kinsley State Farm is even easier than just popping into or calling her office—you may find her and her State Farm team at a local coffee shop, supporting other Aurora businesses, and ready to meet you. On hand to direct your questions and concerns—in English and Spanish—Kinsley's team is small but mighty.\n\n2906 Ogden Ave, Aurora, IL 60504\n\nFind out more about Annie Kinsley at State Farm HERE.\n\nAurora Bank & Trust is part of the Wintrust Community, which prides itself on being homegrown. As the official website states—they were built in this area, for this area. A focus on getting to know the individualized needs of those in the Aurora community stands at the center of how Aurora Bank & Trust does business, something which Vice President of Community Business Banking, Lorena Labastida, believes is crucial.\n\nAurora Bank & Trust, whose present location opened in 2016, has only deepened its connections with new and existing clients as its programming and community connections have grown.\n\nLabastida says that volunteering on local community boards and with area schools—as well as offering seminars and workshops in Spanish—reminds those in Aurora that Aurora Bank & Trust is a community bank—one that is there to help and educate.\n\nFor Labastida, this work is vital in gaining the trust of both new and existing clients, saying that [making these connections] is what makes a difference in this community, it’s how people will remember you.”\n\n2287 W Galena Blvd, Aurora, IL 60506\n\nFind out more about Aurora Bank & Trust HERE.\n\nLed by Dr. Oki Villarreal Borowski, Aurora’s Health Source Chiropractic clinic is part of a larger tradition of chiropractic therapy. Yet the Farnsworth Avenue clinic has seen Dr. Borowski at its helm since 2009 as the first woman to own the business, creating a slice of history within the Aurora community.\n\nPrior to attending the Palmer College of Chiropractic and beginning her career in the field, Dr. Borowski worked as an electrical engineer. She ultimately found her calling working in Palmer’s Outreach Clinic where she serviced groups in the local community without access to proper health care.\n\nSince leading the Health Source clinic in Aurora, Dr. Borowski’s chief aim has been to provide quality care for Aurora residents—from pediatric chiropractic care to manual therapy—in an environment that is safe and care-driven. Offering ‘stress-break’ massages to local small businesses as a means of showing her support for other local leaders, Health Source Chiropractic remains community-minded.\n\n1695 N Farnsworth Ave, Aurora, IL 60505\n\nFind out more about Health Source Chiropractic HERE.\n\nA laid-back atmosphere that buzzes with comradery (and hops), Hopvine Brewing Company sits just beside the Fox Valley Mall. Owners Doug and Jan Isley opened the restaurant and brewery close to 11 years ago, aiming to pair craft kitchen eats with brews that fit the flavor profile to match.\n\nThe couple, who has been married for 38 years, are not Aurora born and bred—yet their passion for the art of brewing came in conjunction with the desire to build a space where offerings felt big city, but where the vibe felt hometown; Aurora fit that bill. With a menu that aims to please a variety of tastes and needs—from vegetarian options, traditional Mexican offerings, and even a gluten-free beer—the Isley’s wanted Hopvine to be a place of gathering and community in the center of the Fox Valley.\n\nEmpty grain and malt bags decorate the industrial ceilings, boasting the hundreds of pounds worth of ingredients that the Isley’s and Brewmaster Zach Sutton have used to develop their on-tap brews, including a Mexican Lager. Local hops—including those you can find planted in Hopvine Brewing’s outdoor patio—are key to keeping all that the restaurant provides feeling native to the community.\n\nThe Isley’s daughter, Kristin, serves as the Front-of-House manager, while barkeep Tom Rice is known for his ability to spin a craft drink for regulars and newbies alike. Oftentimes, he is crafting your drink before you’ve even gotten the chance to order it.\n\nVarious quotes about the special quality of brews and fellowship line the walls, with one, in particular, summarizing what Doug Isley hopes visitors feel when sitting back at Hopvine Brewing Company:\n\nSituated on Montgomery Road, Java Plus combines range with comfort. Whether tea or coffee is your preferred craze, the shop’s cozy interior offers plenty of opportunities for groups to try an old favorite, discover a new treat, and gather.\n\nHigh and low top tables scatter the light-filled space, which owner Dan Okoniewski says is meant to inspire both individual and communal enjoyment. Home to regular special interest meet-ups (did someone say, Pokémon Club?) and open-mic nights (did someone sing, “Java Jamz”?), Okoniewski says the focus at Java Plus “is always going to be: community.”\n\nOpened in 2021, the shop is a visual testament to this commitment to collaboration. On one wall, a large mural depicts Galena Boulevard in downtown Aurora—the Paramount Theatre and historic Leland Tower in full view. On another, a map symbolizes the transcontinental journey of the shop’s coffee beans, sourced from all over South America, Africa, and Asia. From chocolate and espresso bean candy created by Ms. Jana’s Candy to donuts supplied by neighboring Oswego’s My Sister's Lil Donut Shoppe, the presence of community partnership is strong.\n\n“I was raised to remember where you’ve come from,” Okoniewski’s business partner, Javier Burgos, says, whose ability to jump behind the counter to create a signature drink or sit down to discuss strategy contributes to the familial feel and operational development of the business.\n\nJava Plus continues to fill a classic yet enduring need—that of a good cup of coffee, yes, but also a place for fellowship, whose tie with local providers makes it a bean worth roasting.\n\n1677 Montgomery Rd, Aurora, IL 60504\n\nFind out more about Java Plus HERE.\n\nIn an industry where one size does not fit all, Fatimah Kahiga’s approach to skin care is diversified and aimed at serving the unique needs of her local population. The owner of Pure Skin Solutions has over a decade of experience in the skin wellness industry and is an esthetician certified by the Universal Spa Training Academy.\n\nA former avionics technician in the U.S. Navy, Kahiga’s approach to the mission of Pure Skin Solutions to lead with strategies that address the diverse needs of clients was a transferable engagement tactic when she moved from military service to the field of relationship-building.\n\nEntering its sixth year of operation, Pure Skin Solutions is another resource for residents of Aurora and beyond to make appointments for services which put them first.\n\n26 S Stolp Ave, Aurora, IL 60505\n\nFind out more about Pure Skin Solutions HERE.\n\nEmily Beaupre knew that the 2nd floor space on Downer Place was the perfect pocket to add a little Zen to downtown Aurora.\n\nWith a background in public and private school education, Beaupre’s ownership and curation of the Zen Loft Wellness Center is the output of Beaupre’s desire to bring a “relaxing, maker-space for creative\n\npeople” to the city of Aurora. Space for lounging in aerial hammocks and engaging in crotchet and coloring projects operate in tandem with rooms for private massage or yoga sessions.\n\nBeaupre’s drive to combine 15+ years of experience in massage therapy with a women-owned, inclusive business collective has resulted in a wellness center where visitors and professionals from all creative and wellness backgrounds are welcome.\n\n6 W Downer Pl 2nd Floor, Aurora, IL 60506\n\nFind out more about Zen Loft Wellness Center HERE."
