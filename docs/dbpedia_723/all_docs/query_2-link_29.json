        "text": "Atlanta’s oldest Jewish congregation, The Temple, occupies a classically modelled building completed in 1931. Listed on the National Registry of Historic Places, the edifice was designed by local architect Philip Trammell Shutze (1890-1982), a Rome Prize recipient and prolific classicist. Today the building stands not only as a place of worship, but as a proud monument of the robust Jewish community of Atlanta, despite few outward clues to its identity. In fact, the Temple’s restrained classicism and limited exterior religious iconography gives little indication of the actual purpose of the building; it could easily be mistaken for a neo-classical church or school. In this paper, the Temple is examined as a response to the social and religious tensions present in early twentieth-century Atlanta, and as an embodiment of a broader move towards Jewish assimilation due to the rise of anti-Semitic sentiment in the inter-war years. As such, the Temple is demonstrative not only of this desire to be inconspicuous, but of the flexibility of the institution itself. Indeed, the Temple’s appliqué of borrowed classical motifs is not the first time synagogue architecture has adopted the architectural language of another time, place or religion. Rather, similar strategies can be seen throughout much of the history of synagogue design, and most prominently, in a large number of nineteenth-century synagogues across Europe and the United States, which consciously used the language of Moorish Spain. By tracing such historical precedents, the paper will therefore argue that the decorated Temple built by Atlanta’s Jewish community does not so much turn its back on Jewish tradition and culture but, instead, highlights a pattern of appropriated symbolic forms and iconography, as well as a broader willingness to embrace institutional change.\n\nMyths have been known as a robust and an adaptable element of cultures throughout history. Recent architectural studies developed a rich symbolic and mythological system of its own, at the scholarly and public levels. The current research investigates the influence of Native symbolism and mythology upon contemporary American architecture. For this purpose, seven recent case studies are employed and analyzed in the light of local domains and cultural realms. The analyses lay particular emphases upon the symbolic connotations of built forms and used ornaments. The study concludes to the significant impact of symbolism and mythology upon the sound development of the built environment."
