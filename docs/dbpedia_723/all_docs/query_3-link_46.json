According to Illinois sales tax law, here’s how you can collect sales tax on:\n\nIntrastate Illinois sales: A sale is considered intrastate if it ships from an origin in Illinois to a buyer's address in Illinois. Illinois is an ‘origin-based’ sales tax sourcing state. This means that if both the seller’s and buyer’s address is in Illinois, you would charge the sales tax rate of the sale’s origination point. For instance, your business is located in Springfield, Illinois, and you make a sale to a buyer in Aurora, Illinois. Then, you’d charge the buyer the sales tax rate at your Springfield location.\n\nInterstate Illinois sales: A sale is considered interstate if the item ships from outside Illinois and the seller isn’t otherwise “engaged in a business” in the state. In such cases, you’d generally charge the sales tax rate at your buyer’s location. For instance, if your business is located in Leander, Idaho, and you sell to a buyer in Aurora, Illinois, you should charge the buyer the Aurora sales tax rate.\n\nLearn more about origin-based and destination-based sales tax sourcing here.\n\nHow to File and Pay Sales Tax in Aurora\n\nTaxpayers have multiple options to file and pay Aurora sales tax returns:\n\nFile and pay online - You can file and pay Illinois sales and use tax online at MyTaxIllinois.\n\nFile and pay by mail - Fill out Illinois Sales and Use Tax and E911 Surcharge Return (Form ST-1)\n\nOr, you can say goodbye to the tedious paperwork and hello to stress-free sales tax management with Zamp.
