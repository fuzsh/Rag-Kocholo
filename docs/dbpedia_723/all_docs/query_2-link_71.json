Each month features a new theme, so your child never gets bored.\n\nWe want to ensure your child is making progress and keep you involved.Every month each child gets an in-water skill evaluation followed by a progress report.\n\nNew All in 9 Program\n\nOur newest program for children ages 4 and up guarantees three major swim milestones in just nine months. Through your consistent attendance and our commitment to progress tracking, your child will be able to self-rescue, float independently on their back, and swim at least 25 feet. All swim programs can tell you how much a lesson costs, but only we can tell you how long it will take to become a proficient swimmer.\n\nWhether you’re looking to increase your child’s comfort levels in the water, ensure their safety around water, or take their swim skills to the next level, Bear Paddle offers swim levels for kids of all ages and abilities."
