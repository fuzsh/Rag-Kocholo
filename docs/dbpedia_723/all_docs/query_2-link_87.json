        "text": "An over 300 years old institution focused on self-improvement and charity. We are a school of morality whose teachings are shared through morality plays that we reenact during our private meetings.\n\nThe vision of Freemasonry, as defined by United Grand Lodge of England is:\n\nTo attract those from all backgrounds and walks of life, enabling them to develop into more thoughtful and confident people. To inspire and challenge them to practise the core values we celebrate – Integrity, Friendship, Respect, Charity – in their private and public lives. To cement our reputation as a force for good in our communities and society at large and as a thriving organisation that people aspire to join.\n\nIn short, yes. Your actual faith is immaterial to us, whether you are Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, we will welcome you into our ranks (this is why we speak of Supreme Being and not God).\n\nThe belief in a Supreme being is purely because as an organisation we believe this is necessary for you to be able to fully appreciate the teachings of our Order. It is about having a belief rather than who you believe in.\n\nWomen of 18 years or older are abslutely allowed to become Freemasons, although not in this lodge or any other lodge associated with the United Grand Lodge of England, which are restrcited to men only.\n\nIf you are a woman who is interested in Freemasonry, or know one who is, there are two Grand Lodges for women. These are the Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons (HFAF) and the Order of Women Freemasons (OWF). The latter has several lodges in Yorkshire (including Leeds).\n\nTo be one, ask one. It’s as simple as that.\n\nIf you are interested in joining, get in touch wiht us through the Contact page. We’ll invite you to meet us and over several months, you will get an opportunity to ask us anything you want, get to know us, and decide whether this is the right thing for you.\n\nIf we agree you would be a good fit, we’ll then start the application process with you.\n\nBecoming a Freemason is not a quick process, both by design and due to the steps involved.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, estimate it would take between 6 and 12 months from first contact to your initiation, if you decide to apply (while we try to avoid it, it may take longer depending on how busy the lodge is).\n\nWe have 11 formal meetings, where we conduct our ceremonies (e.g., initiating new members into our lodge), on the 2nd Wednesday of every month, except August.\n\nIn addition to those formal meetings, we meet on the other Wednesdays of the month to practice our ceremonies; it is after those practice nights that we hold our social boards, when we usually invite prospective candidates to meet us.\n\nWe also have punctual events throughout the year where partners and non-Masons are welcome to attend.\n\nThis is not one we can answer for you, we are afraid.\n\nHowever, there are several reasons people decide to join (and stay) in Freemasonry. What we can say, however, is that many of our members have been coming weekly for dedcades, literally.\n\nMany people say that there is a before and an after their initiation, that they made several friends for life, and many see becoming a Freemason as one of the best decisions they have made in their lives."
