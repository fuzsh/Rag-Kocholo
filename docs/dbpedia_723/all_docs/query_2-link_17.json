        "text": "The Scottish Rite Masonic Temple in Yankton, South Dakota was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 23, 2013 for Social History and Architecture. The St. John’s Lodge was organized in Yankton in 1862, just after Dakota Territory was organized. After steady growth through the later nineteenth century, the Masonic community in Yankton was able to build this elaborate building in 1901-1903 using a blend of Richardsonian Romanesque and Chateauesque architectural influences. The temple designed by W.R. Parsons & Sons, and built by J.W. Detwiler & Co., houses a banquet room, meeting chambers, library, and halls for the Blue Lodge, York Rite Commandery, and Scottish Rite Consistory. It was one of only two Scottish Rite temple buildings erected in South Dakota. Fraternal orders like the influential Ancient, Free, & Accepted Masons provided opportunities for participation in a civic religion focused on moral character, for gender-exclusive socialization in times of cultural transition, and for the organization of charitable projects. These benefits of socialization and social order were particularly important to communities in newly settled regions of the country like Dakota Territory.\n\nThere are noticeable parallels between the tenets of Masonic Fellowcraft and the principles of Neoclassical Architecture. Masonic themes can also be found in Thomas Jefferson’s enlightenment, which occurred in France during his association with an elite circle of reform-minded Freemasons. In this paper, I will summaries these parallels and comment on these themes.\n\nRevision of paper presented at Symposium on \"Western Esotericism and Jewish Mysticism,\" 18th International Association for History of Religions (Durban, South Africa, August 2000). Examination of ancient tradition that identified Scottish operative stonemasons and Scottish Freemasons as Jews. Two overlooked keys to this tradition lie in the history of Jewish architectural technology and the medieval myths of Scottish nationalism. The preservation of Cabalistic themes within architectural theories and Scottish poetry influenced the 18th-century \"higher,\" Ecossais Masonic degrees.\n\nDuring the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, freemasonry's network of grand and local lodges facilitated the development and popular dissemination of American art, attracting artists, critics and patrons alike. Freemasonry's symbolism of nature and architecture particularly influenced the imagery of American landscape painting. The Hudson River School landscapist and freemason Thomas Cole (1801–1848) especially composed sublime mountainous views that drew upon masonry's rich visual arsenal of hieroglyphic emblems. First publicized in New York newspapers by William Dunlap, a brother mason, Cole's paintings captured the patronage of the Empire State's masonic elite. Cole viewed the American wilderness as a sacred, architectural space revelatory of God's Word. Inspired by Hudson River and Catskill Mountain views, Cole's landscapes allude to the Herculean building of the Erie Canal, an engineering project that contemporary freemasons also likened to the building of Noah's Ark.\n\nAmericans of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries shared specific ideas concerning the appearance of Solomon's temple. This conception was shaped by a specific set of artists, art works, and buildings. This American conception of Solomon;s Temple was not exclusive to Freemasonry. Rather, the fraternity was so prevalent within American society during this time that the organization's concern with Solomon's temple influenced the nation's culture more broadly."
