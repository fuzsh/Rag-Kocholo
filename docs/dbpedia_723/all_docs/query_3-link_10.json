It is known as “The City of Lights” because it’s the world’s first community to use electric streetlights. It was home to the first free school in the state, the first YMCA building to be constructed in Illinois and in 2009 constructed a 42 square mile fiber optic network that connects municipal facilities, schools and businesses to the internet.\n\nToday, Aurora has ascended to become Illinois’ second largest city, and boasts a healthy business community that includes a retail sector that generates more than $2 billion in sales with centers such as the Chicago Premium Outlet and Westfield Fox Valley malls. Moreover, there are 15 major business parks totaling 4,040 acres.\n\nThe quality of life in Aurora remains high with six public school districts and a number of private, Catholic and Christian schools. The Illinois Math and Science Academy (IMSA) is one of only three schools in the nation of its kind. Students at IMSA consistently average high scores on the ACT. Other institutions of higher learning include Aurora University, Robert Morris University, and Waubonsee Community College."
