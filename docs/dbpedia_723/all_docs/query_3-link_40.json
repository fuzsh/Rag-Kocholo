Originally founded within Kane County, Aurora's city limits and population now spill over into DuPage, Will and Kendall counties. Between 2000 and 2003, the U.S. Census Bureau ranked Aurora as the 34th fastest growing city in the United States.[3] From 2000 to 2009, the U.S. Census Bureau ranked the city as the 46th fastest growing city with a population of over 100,000.[4]\n\nIn 1908, Aurora officially adopted the nickname \"City of Lights\", because it was one of the first cities in the United States to implement an all-electric street lighting system in 1881.[5] Aurora's historic downtown is located on the Fox River, and centered on Stolp Island. The city is divided into three regions, The West Side, located on the west side of the Fox River, The East Side, located between the eastern bank of the Fox River and the Kane/DuPage County line, and the Far East Side/Fox Valley, which is from the County Line to the city's eastern border with Naperville.\n\nThe Aurora area is home to an impressive collection of architecture, including structures by Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Bruce Goff and George Grant Elmslie. The Hollywood Casino Aurora, a dockside gaming facility with 53,000 square feet (4,900 m2) and 1,200 gaming positions, is located on the river in downtown Aurora. Aurora is also home to a large collection of Sears Catalog Homes (over 50 homes) and Lustron all-steel homes (seven homes).\n\nHistory[]\n\nBefore European settlers arrived, there was a Native American village in what is today downtown Aurora, on the banks of the Fox River. In 1834, following the Black Hawk War, the McCarty brothers arrived and initially owned land on both sides of the river, but sold their lands to the Lake Brothers on the west side. The Lake Brothers opened a mill on the opposite side of the river. The McCartys lived and operated their mill on the east side.[6] A post office was established in 1837, officially creating Aurora. Actually, however, Aurora was originally two villages: East Aurora, incorporated in 1845,[7] on the east side of the river, and West Aurora, formally organized on the west side of the river in 1854.[7] In 1857, the two towns joined officially incorporated as the city of Aurora.[8] The two sides could not agree on which side of the river should house the public buildings, so most public buildings were built on or around Stolp Island in the middle of the Fox River.\n\nAs the city grew, many factories and jobs came to Aurora, along with many people. In 1856, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad located its roundhouse and locomotive shop in Aurora to become the town's largest employer until the 1960s.[9] Many of the heavy industries were located on the East side which provided employment for many generations of European immigrants. Many immigrants flocked to the city, mainly from Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Luxembourg, Germany, France, and Italy. Aurora became the main economic center of the Fox Valley region. The combination of these three factors—a highly industrialized town, a sizable river that divided it, and the Burlington's shops—accounted for much of the dynamics of Aurora's political, economic, and social history. The city was inclusive and tolerant, and welcomed a variety of immigrants and openly supported abolitionism prior to the American Civil War. Mexican migrants began arriving after the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Socially, the town was progressive in its attitude toward education, religion, welfare, and women. The first free public school district in Illinois was established in 1851 and a high school for girls came four years later.\n\nThe city was a manufacturing powerhouse until the early 1970s, when the railroad shops closed. Soon many other factories and industrial areas relocated or went out of business. By 1980, there were few industrial areas operating in the city, and unemployment soared to 16%.[6] During the late 1970s and early 1980s, development of the Far East side along the Eola Road and Route 59 areas began. While this was financially beneficial to the city, it also contributed to the decline of the downtown and the manufacturing sectors on the near East and West Sides. Crime rates soared and street gangs started to form in the mid-1980s. It was during this time that Aurora became a much more culturally diverse city. The Latino population started to grow rapidly in the city in the 1980s. In the late 1980s, several business and industrial parks were established on the outskirts of the city. In 1993, the Hollywood Casino was built downtown, which helped bring the first redevelopment to the downtown area in nearly twenty years. In the late 1990s, more development began in the rural areas and towns outside of Aurora. Subdivisions sprouted up all around the city, and Aurora's population soared.\n\nToday, Aurora is a culturally diverse city of around 200,000 residents. Historic areas downtown are being redeveloped, and new developments are being built all over the city.\n\nGeography[]\n\nAurora is located at (41.7634594 -88.2900680).[1]\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of 45.80 square miles (118.6 km2), of which 44.94 square miles (116.4 km2) (or 98.12%) is land and 0.86 square miles (2.2 km2) (or 1.88%) is water.[10]\n\nWhile the city has traditionally been regarded as being in Kane County, Illinois, Aurora's city limits also include parts of DuPage, Kendall, and Will. Aurora is one of only three cities in Illinois spanning four counties. (The other cities are Barrington Hills and Centralia, Illinois.)\n\nRegions of Aurora[]\n\nThough politically the city is divided into several wards, Aurora is generally divided into three regions:\n\nThe West Side, which is located of west of the Fox River.\n\nThe East Side, which spans the region east of the Fox River, stopping at the DuPage County line.\n\nFox Valley, also referred to as the Far East Side, is the portion of Aurora located east of the Dupage County line. Its name is deceptive because it is actually the part of the city farthest from the Fox River and its valley. The area acquired its name because of its proximity to the Westfield Fox Valley Mall and Fox Valley Villages, one of the first housing developments to be constructed after the mall.\n\nClimate[]\n\nThe annual precipitation for Aurora is about 40 inches. The record high for Aurora is 111 °F (44 °C), on July 14, 1936. The record low is −26 °F (−32.2 °C), on January 20, 1985. The average high temperature for Aurora in July is 84 °F (29 °C), the average January low is 10 °F (−12 °C).\n\nOn July 17–18, 1996, a major flood struck Aurora, with 16.9 inches (430 mm) of rain in a 24 hour period, which is an Illinois state record, and the second highest ever nationally. Flooding occurred in almost every low lying area, and in the Fox River valley. The flooding was just as bad in Blackberry Creek, on Aurora's far west side.\n\nAurora has not been struck by any major tornadoes in recent history, although they occur in Northern Illinois annually. In 1906, a tornado went through the Aurora Driving Park, a large recreation/amusement park and race track located where the Riddle Highlands neighborhood and Northgate shopping center is now located. The tornado hit during the afternoon performance of the Ringling Brothers \"Greatest Show on Earth\" circus, when the park was crowded. It killed 2 people and injured 22, but the grandstand was still filled for the evening performance. Weak Tornadoes struck the city in 1954, 1958, 1960, and 1991. In 1990, the Supercell Thunderstorm that produced the deadly Plainfield Tornado passed over the city, dropping golf ball sized hail and causing wind damage. Less than ten minutes after passing through Aurora, the storm produced an F5 tornado in nearby Oswego, which traveled through Plainfield and Joliet and killed 29 people.\n\nThe city can receive heavy snowfall and experiences blizzards periodically.\n\nAurora was hit with one of the strongest earthquakes ever to strike Illinois on May 26, 1909. It put cracks through chimneys and could be felt 500,000 sq mi (1,300,000 km2) around.\n\nClimate data for Aurora, Illinois Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 66\n\n(19) 72\n\n(22) 83\n\n(28) 92\n\n(33) 104\n\n(40) 106\n\n(41) 111\n\n(44) 105\n\n(41) 103\n\n(39) 90\n\n(32) 81\n\n(27) 69\n\n(21) 111\n\n(44) Average high °F (°C) 29.4\n\n(−1.4) 34.9\n\n(1.6) 46.4\n\n(8.0) 59.3\n\n(15.2) 71.5\n\n(21.9) 80.7\n\n(27.1) 84.2\n\n(29.0) 82.1\n\n(27.8) 75.2\n\n(24.0) 63.1\n\n(17.3) 47.2\n\n(8.4) 34.2\n\n(1.2) 59.02\n\n(15.01) Average low °F (°C) 10.5\n\n(−11.9) 15.6\n\n(−9.1) 26.1\n\n(−3.3) 36.2\n\n(2.3) 46.4\n\n(8.0) 55.7\n\n(13.2) 60.6\n\n(15.9) 58.4\n\n(14.7) 49.9\n\n(9.9) 38.2\n\n(3.4) 27.7\n\n(−2.4) 16.4\n\n(−8.7) 36.81\n\n(2.67) Record low °F (°C) −26\n\n(−32) −25\n\n(−32) −15\n\n(−26) 8\n\n(−13) 21\n\n(−6) 34\n\n(1) 40\n\n(4) 37\n\n(3) 25\n\n(−4) 11\n\n(−12) −11\n\n(−24) −25\n\n(−32) −26\n\n(−32) Precipitation inches (mm) 1.62\n\n(41.1) 1.52\n\n(38.6) 2.57\n\n(65.3) 3.88\n\n(98.6) 3.91\n\n(99.3) 4.34\n\n(110.2) 4.39\n\n(111.5) 4.38\n\n(111.3) 3.50\n\n(88.9) 2.71\n\n(68.8) 3.17\n\n(80.5) 2.40\n\n(61) 38.39\n\n(975.1) Snowfall inches (cm) 10.0\n\n(25.4) 7.0\n\n(17.8) 3.7\n\n(9.4) 0.8\n\n(2) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0.1\n\n(0.3) 1.4\n\n(3.6) 7.5\n\n(19.1) 30.5\n\n(77.5) Avg. precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 9.7 7.8 10.4 11.8 11.2 10.2 9.3 10.0 8.9 8.9 10.2 10.7 119.1 Avg. snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) 6.7 4.5 2.1 0.4 0 0 0 0 0 0.1 1.2 4.9 19.9 Source: NOAA (normals, 1971–2000)[11]\n\nDemographics[]\n\nHistorical populations Census Pop. %± 1850 1,200 — 1870 11,162 — 1880 11,873 6.4% 1890 19,688 65.8% 1900 24,147 22.6% 1910 29,800 23.4% 1920 36,300 21.8% 1930 46,589 28.3% 1940 47,200 1.3% 1950 50,600 7.2% 1960 63,715 25.9% 1970 74,200 16.5% 1980 81,293 9.6% 1990 99,581 22.5% 2000 142,990 43.6% 2010 197,899 38.4% Est. 2012 199,932 39.8% [12][13][14]\n\nAs of the census[15] of 2000, there were 142,990 people, 46,489 households, and 34,215 families residing in the city.

The Riverfront Playhouse is a not-for-profit theater that has held a storefront location in downtown Aurora since 1978.[17]\n\nA fixture of Downtown Aurora, the Waubonsee Community College Campus, which formerly sat on Stolp Island near the Paramount Theatre, has recently been closed, as a new and greatly expanded campus was built on the Western banks of the river, between the river and IL Route 31. The construction of the campus was part of a larger plan to redevelop the Downtown area, putting in parks and new walking paths, making the area more inviting. The plan also included a pedestrian bridge, which would connect the two banks of the river. Also in the works is a plan to modify or reconstruct the bridges onto Stolp Island, which have not been maintained for close to 60 years.\n\nMuseums[]\n\nAurora Historical Society\n\nAurora Regional Fire Museum\n\nThe Aurora Public Arts Commission\n\nGrand Army of the Republic Hall\n\nPhillips Park Zoo\n\nDavid L.

Aurora has numerous youth soccer clubs, most of which have teams represented in the top five percent of the Northern Illinois Soccer League. Numerous youth soccer players from Aurora have been awarded college scholarships to major college soccer programs throughout the U.S. In addition to this legacy of success in soccer, Aurora maintains several developmental advantages for soccer enthusiasts. Three high quality indoor soccer venues allow for year-round soccer training and competition for children and adults. Additionally, several area traveling soccer clubs, as well as high schools, boast coaches and trainers who have played soccer professionally or have been starting players for national teams from various countries.

The city is the final stop of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe line of the Metra commuter rail system, allowing rail service into Chicago. The city also has a stop at the Rt. 59 station on the BNSF Line. This station is located on the border with Naperville and each city maintains a parking lot on their respective sides of the tracks. The BNSF Railroad owns and maintains a rail yard in Aurora, which they named Eola Yard. Pace Suburban Bus operates local bus service within Aurora six days a week (no service on Sundays) and connects to cities such as Naperville, Geneva, Batavia, Oswego, and St. Charles. Metra trains and Pace buses stop at the Aurora Transportation Center. Greyhound buses used to stop there, but service was discontinued on September 7, 2011.[20] Aurora does not currently have a stop for Amtrak trains, as the old station where they did stop closed in the 1980s. Aurora City Lines, the old city bus lines, was closed in the late 1980s, in favor of regional bus service. Aurora also used to have an extensive streetcar system, operated by the Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric Company, that served most neighborhoods. Additionally, Aurora was served by a number of interurban lines. The most prominent of these was the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad which provided service into Chicago. The STAR Line would have a third station at Ferry Rd. north of the BNSF Line.\n\nThe Aurora Municipal Airport is a general aviation airport located in Sugar Grove, Illinois, just outside of Aurora. Although the airport is located within Sugar Grove, it is owned and operated by the City of Aurora. The Aurora Airport is designed as a reliever airport for Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports, and also handles a lot of international cargo. It is capable of landing Boeing 757 aircraft.

St Joseph and St, Charles hospitals have been converted into senior living centers, and the old Copley hospital, which was one of the largest hospitals in the area, sits vacant. The city of Aurora recently demolished the old smokestacks from the hospital, as they were starting to crumble and fall down.\n\nDreyer Medical Clinic and several other independent clinics and medical groups are spread throughout the city. The area surrounding Provena Mercy has evolved into a diverse healthcare district with services and offices.\n\nEducation[]\n\nSee also: Public school systems in Aurora, Illinois\n\nThe city is the location of the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA) and Aurora University. According to the census of Aurora's population over the age of twenty-five, 26% hold a bachelor's degree.\n\nStarting in the 1860s, Aurora was served by two main school systems, one on either side of the Fox River, which physically divides the city. In the mid-20th century, the district on the western side of the river expanded to include the students in the village of North Aurora, including the North Aurorans on the east side of the Fox. Additionally, in 1972, the Indian Prairie School District (IPSD) 204 was formed to serve the far eastern portion of Aurora within DuPage County. All three districts (Aurora Public Schools: West Side (District 129), Aurora Public Schools: East Side (District 131) and IPSD) have their headquarters and administrative offices within the Aurora city limits. As of 2005, there were at least forty public schools within Aurora city limits, serving residents of Aurora and neighboring communities.\n\nDue to the sheer size of the city of Aurora, these are not the only three school systems serving residents - some students in the far north end of the city (north of I88 in Kane County) attend Batavia public schools, some on the far southwest side attend Kaneland CUSD 302 schools (headquartered in Maple Park), and some students in the far south end of the city (a small corner of the Kane, Kendall and Will County portions) attend Oswego public schools. Four of the schools in Oswego CUSD 308, Wheatlands Elementary, Homestead Elementary, Wolf's Crossing Elementary, and Bednarcik Junior High, are located within Aurora's city limits.\n\nThe Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA) is a state-funded residential magnet school for grades 10 to 12. While IMSA operates under public funds (and uses the site originally designated West Aurora High School North Campus), it is managed independently of the other public schools in the city of Aurora. Any Illinois student who meets admission requirements may apply to attend IMSA, tuition free.\n\nAurora is also home to a few other private schools. Within Aurora, there are three Roman Catholic High Schools, Aurora Central Catholic (Diocese of Rockford), Rosary, and Marmion Academy (Order of St. Benedict), and seven Catholic elementary schools operated by the Diocese of Rockford. Along with these three schools is Aurora Christian High School and Elementary School. Aurora is also home to Fox Valley Montessori School, one of the first Montessori schools established in Illinois in 1969, which offers a preschool and elementary program.\n\nThe above-named districts have forty-six public schools within the city limits of Aurora (seventeen for District #131, thirteen for District #129, eleven for District #204, four for Oswego District #308 and the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy). Aurora is also home to twenty-two private schools including Rasmussen College, two branches of Waubonsee Community College, and the main campus of Aurora University.\n\nLibrary[]\n\nThe Aurora Public Library includes the main library, two branches, an express center, a support facility and a bookmobile. The current library operations budget is $10 million and the staff numbers 85 full-time and 89 part-time employees. The library was funded in 1901 through a Carnegie grant. Construction on a new, $30-million Main Library at River and Benton streets is set to begin in 2013.[21]\n\nNotable people[]\n\nMain article: List of people from Aurora, Illinois\n\nMedia[]\n\nIn addition to the Chicago broadcast stations, the following are based in Aurora:\n\nTelevision[]\n\nWXFT-DT - TeleFutura Channel 50/60.1, Aurora/Chicago\n\nWPVN-CD - Polnet Communications Channel 20, Aurora\n\nAurora Community TV (ACTV) - Channel 10\n\nTotal Living Network (TLN)\n\nWaubonsee Community College Educational Television - Comcast Channel 99\n\nRadio[]\n\nWBIG (AM) 1280 Aurora\n\nWERV-FM 95.9 Aurora\n\nWLEY-FM 107.9 Aurora\n\nNewspapers[]\n\nThe Beacon News is Aurora's oldest business, first published in 1846, and is part of the Sun-Times Media Group.

Gang violence had reached a high in the 1990s, with the city averaging nearly 30 murders per year.[23][24] In 2008, Aurora only had 2 murders.[23][24] In July 2007, the Aurora Police Department and the FBI conducted \"Operation First Degree Burn,\" a sweep that resulted in the successful arrest of 31 alleged Latin Kings gang members suspected of 22 murders dating back to the mid-1990s.[25] Aurora has also adopted programs such as CeaseFire to reduce gang violence and prevent youths from joining gangs. Aurora had no murders in 2012.\n\nLike other large Midwestern cities that once relied on manufacturing as an economic basis, Aurora has a large number of abandoned buildings and vacant lots, especially in older sections of the city. Efforts are ongoing to rehabilitate these areas.\n\nEnvironmentally, Aurora has long dealt with pollution of the Fox River. The river was heavily polluted up until the 1970s by factories that had lined the river for over a century. Cleanup efforts have been successful with the help of state grants and volunteer efforts.[26]\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nOfficial website\n\nAurora Area Convention and Visitors Bureau\n\nAurora Regional Chamber of Commerce\n\nAurora, Illinois in the Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago\n\nAurora Fire Department history honoring its 150th anniversary, in 2006.\n\nCity-data.com: Aurora, IL"
