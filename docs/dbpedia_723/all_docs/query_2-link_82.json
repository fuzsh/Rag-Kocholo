        "text": "Secrets, codes, hidden treasures and lost religions. We just can’t seem to get enough, including movies like “National Treasure” and “The Da Vinci Code,” which both swirled around secrets of the Knights Templar.\n\nOur lust for the secret knowledge is driving the much-anticipated release of two sequels in 2007: “National Treasure 2” and Dan Brown’s “The Solomon Key,” about the secret society of Freemasons, which legend connects to the Knights Templar.\n\nMost of us experience these adventures second-hand on the giant screens of pop-culture entertainment, but people like John Lawton, 45, live the mystery.\n\nHe’s Captain General of the Knights Templar commandery in Denver, one of the chivalric orders of Freemasonry.\n\n“We don’t go to Jerusalem and battle Saracens anymore,” he says.\n\nMostly Freemasons organize family picnics or charitable fundraisers like the corn roast they’ll hold on the 16th Street Mall on Aug. 11. They also teach moral lessons and study estoeric philosophies based on the Kabbalah.\n\nLawton devotes about 14 nights a month to this lifestyle. He is a member of three Masonic lodges in Denver and serves as an officer in six of Masonry’s many different organizations.\n\n“I come from a Masonic family, so I wanted to find out what the mystery was about,” he says. “But I stayed for the fellowship. I meet people who are very knowledgeable, and we have fascinating discussions about history and current events.”\n\nAs manager for Highlands Masonic Lodge, Lawton also answers e- mails from men interested in joining the Masons, the world’s oldest and largest fraternal organization.\n\nHe believes movies like “National Treasure” and “The Da Vinci Code,” which included Freemasonry in the plot, drive some of the curiosity.\n\n“But I don’t think the movies are stimulating the interest as much as they’re part of a renewed interest over the past five years,” he says.\n\n“There’s a desire to find out what the mystery and intrigue are about. But I think younger people are getting burned out on video games, and would rather have human contact and fraternal relations.”\n\nAmerica’s fascination with secret societies, from the Masons to Opus Dei, is evident in bookstores across America. Some books even reveal Masonic secrets and rituals.\n\nAnd then there’s Dan Brown’s next novel, “The Solomon Key,” about the Freemasons and the founding of America.\n\nThe book isn’t expected to be published until next year, but already a cottage industry of Freemasonry exposé is springing up around it: DVDs like “Dan Bur-\n\nstein’s Secrets of Angels, Demons & Masons,” and books like “Secrets of the Widow’s Son: The Mysteries Surrounding the Sequel to the Da Vinci Code.”\n\nSome Masons are getting their talking points ready, in case they turn out to be the next Opus Dei.\n\n“It could be very negative,” says Stephen Munsinger, chief executive officer of the Scottish Rite Masons of Colorado, and a District Court judge in the 1st Judicial District who formerly worked in the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\n“We’re concerned that it will say we’re against traditional Christianity or established religions, or that (we’re) some type of right-wing, left-wing, or off-the-wall religious sect, or that we’re pushing some secret agenda for religious purposes.”\n\nThe problem is that the secrecy inherent to Masonry leads outsiders to suspect the organization of countless conspiracies.\n\nTo some degree, it’s something the Masons have brought upon themselves, says Steven Bullock, author of “Revolutionary Brotherhood: Freemasonry and the Transformation of the American Social Order.”\n\n“In the early days of Masonry someone with a sword stood outside the door of the lodge rooms to keep people out,” he says.\n\n“The secrets of Masonry have been blown up to be this amazing thing, and the Masons themselves are responsible for mythologizing it.”\n\nBecause of the secrecy, over the centuries Masons have been accused of everything from elitisim to Satanism.\n\nTruth and myth twist into distorted reality. History is forgotten.\n\nPeople who grew up in Denver’s Highlands neighborhood, for example, are familiar with the large sand-colored Masonic Temple on Federal Boulevard.\n\nYet most are too young to remember its origins, when the cornerstone laid in 1927 was heralded by a vast procession parade of 150 Knights Templar and the El Jebel Shrine Band.\n\nThe origins of Freemasonry itself are similarly shrouded, or forgotten.\n\nMost academics trace Freemasonry back to the medieval stonemasons who built the great cathedrals of Europe. The secret handshakes and passwords developed back then, because they frequently traveled to strange towns and needed a way to prove they were part of the mason’s guild.\n\nThe formal organization of Freemasons started in 1717, however, with the Grand Lodge of England, when the work of masonry became not physical but philosophical.\n\nInstead of building churches, they became the builders of men. Their trademark remained the square and compass of the ancient architectural craftsmen, and they created a symbolic set of instructions based on this lineage to instruct men in the moral and spiritual life.\n\nThe three Masonic degrees – entered apprentice, fellow craft and master mason – are given after rituals that include extensive memorization of texts, along with secret handshakes and passwords.\n\n“The study of their history, philosophy, symbolism, and ritual can consume a lifetime of research and practice,” writes Christopher Hodapp, past master of Knights Templar, in “Freemasons for Dummies.”\n\nIn the 18th century, with its emphasis on Enlightenment values – equality, fraternity and liberty – Freemasonry became associated with social, even revolutionary, change.\n\nSuch American patriots as Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were Freemasons. Nine signed the Declaration of Independence, and 13 signed the Constitution.\n\nThis intersection of Masonry and American history triggered conspiracy theories that Freemasons seek control of the government.\n\nBut Masons say their only goal is to build good men who work behind the scenes to improve their neighborhoods.\n\n“We’re a brotherhood of men under the fatherhood of God,” says Thomas Cox, grand master of the Grand Lodge of Colorado. “The Freemasons of North America give over $2 million a day, 365 days a year, to philanthropic projects.”\n\nHe comes from a long line of Masons – including his father, grandfathers and uncles.\n\nBut his son, 40, is like many Gen-Xers and baby boomers: He has not joined this age-old fraternity.\n\nMembership has declined in recent decades, and lodges across the country are struggling to determine the future.\n\nMany choose to tone down the\n\nesoteric philosophy and instead focus on family values, throwing lots of picnics and chili cook-offs.\n\nOthers, however, disagree about ditching the mystery.\n\n“At the Denver Consistery last Saturday we had two young guys talk about symbolism and ancient meanings,” says Munsinger.\n\n“We had 200 men listening to esoteric symbolism, Greek and Jewish and Kabbalah – our symbols and how they developed. It was fascinating, and they really enjoyed it.”\n\nTo become a Mason, you need to ask another Mason. Gary Rinedollar of Parker, a software businessman, is thinking about doing so.\n\nHe recently attended a party with his wife, Karen, where they met a man who wore a Masonic ring, and asked him for more information.\n\n“The Da Vinci Code piqued my interest, and I think there is something more to it, a religious aspect, a whole secret aspect,” says Rinedollar.\n\n“I wonder what’s going on behind the closed door.”\n\nStaff writer Colleen O’Connor can be reached at 303-820-1083 or at coconnor@denverpost.com.\n\nFAMOUS FREEMASONS\n\nSteve Wozniak, founder of Apple computer\n\nDave Thomas, founder of Wendy’s\n\nBenito Juarez, Mexico president\n\nKalakaua, king of Hawaii\n\nW.E.B. DuBois, a founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\n\nMedgar Evers, martyred civil rights activist\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, actor\n\nAlex Haley, author of “Roots”\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart,\n\ncomposer\n\nJohn Glenn, astronaut and U.S. senator\n\nTheodore Roosevelt, U.S. president\n\nRELATED ORGANIZATIONS\n\nFreemasonry is like an ancient oak tree with many branches. Here are a few of the different connected organizations.\n\nFor men:\n\nYork Rite: This system is made up of three groups that gave 10 higher degrees: the Royal Arch degrees; three Cryptic Mason degrees; and three Chivalric orders that end with the Knights Templar Order.\n\nAncient Accepted Scottish Rite: Some of its degrees delve into the story of building Solomon’s Temple that begins in the first three lodge degrees. Like the York Rite, this system is considered “continuing education” in Masonry.\n\nFor women:\n\nOrder of the Eastern Star, Order of the Amaranth, White Shrine of Jerusalem: These don’t offer degrees of Masonry for women but are for women connected to Masons.\n\nFor youth:\n\nDeMolay International: For boys, it’s named after Jacques DeMolay, the last grand master of the original Knights Templar. Requires belief in a supreme being.\n\nJob’s Daughters International: For girls who are direct descendants of Master Masons; belief in a supreme being is required.\n\nTRUE OR FALSE ANSWERS\n\n1. False. Keitel wore a Masonic ring.\n\n2. True. Shriners are probably the most popular organization that’s part of Masonry. Before a man can become a Shriner, he must be a Freemason.\n\n3. False. It was the “Homer the Great” episode on “The Simpsons,” when Homer wanted to join the lodge of “Stonecutters” so he could get perks like better parking places.\n\n4. True. Three candles, three knocks on the door, three stages of life, three degrees, three principle numbers. That’s because Aristotle and Plato taught that three symbolizes the Supreme Being since 1 + 2 = 3, and three contains the other two numbers.\n\n5. False. It’s the white leather apron, the first gift given to a Freemason, and buried with him at death. There are many portraits of George Washington wearing his Masonic apron.\n\n6. False. Michael Richards, who played Cosmo Kramer on Seinfeld, said this when talking about his lodge. He became a Mason after discovering that his comic hero, Red Skelton, was a Mason.\n\n7. True. Originally, it was the tool stonemasons used to square their work. Later, it became the symbol that signfied a man’s honesty, fairness, and virtue.\n\n8. False. It’s been known since the late 17th century. The password for the first degree is Boaz; for the second degree, Jachin; for the third degree, Mahabyn.\n\n9. False. But “Ivanhoe,” a story of 13th-century knights written by Freemason Sir Walter Scott, was so popular in those days that it widely influenced notions of honor and chivalry. Freemason Mark Twain blamed Scott’s work for leading to the war by glorifying outmoded ideals of rank and privilege.\n\n10. True. Men of all religious are welcome, but they must believe in a supreme being.\n\nSources: Freemasons for Dummies by Christopher Hodapp; Forbidden Faith by Richard Smoley."
