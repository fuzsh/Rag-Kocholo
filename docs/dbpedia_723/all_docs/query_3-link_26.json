That’s because AU professors don’t just teach in classrooms, they partner with you to build the knowledge and skills you need to realize your potential, achieve your goals, and have an impact on the world.\n\nA future inspired.\n\n“One course at AU changed my life. During my freshman year, I took Introduction to Environmental Studies, even though I wasn’t into nature. Fortunately, Professor Barclay brought my class outside to literally show us what we were learning. She also introduced me to literature that gave me a deeper appreciation for where we live. Now I’m a biology and environmental studies and sustainability double major with a part-time job in a lab doing what I love: making the world a better place.” – Gwen '24, biology and environmental studies and sustainability double major\n\nWatch the Video"
