        "text": "Why make the switch from turf grass to a water-wise landscape?\n\nIn addition to water use, water-wise landscapes require less maintenance, like fertilizer, mowing and aeration. Water-wise plants generally require spring cutback and minimal supplemental water. Homeowners can incorporate native plants in their designs which enhances vitality and supports our local bees, butterflies, moths and hummingbirds. Changing from bluegrass to water-wise landscapes contributes to holistic environmental sustainability.\n\nHow do I find which plants to use in my landscape?\n\nVisit the Aurora Water-wise Garden. With way-finding and interpretive signage, the six-acre botanical space guides visitors through the principles of water-wise landscaping. Plants are labeled for guests’ convenient recognition. You can check out Plant Select, High Country Gardens, and our plant list.\n\nWhat are the landscape program’s design limitations?\n\nFor 2024, the Landscape Design program will be accepting project submissions for residential Aurora Water customers. We will not be accepting commercial properties for landscape designs unless they are non-profit entities.\n\nOur designers can incorporate pathways, patios, vegetable gardens, retaining walls and benches into your design. We cannot incorporate outdoor kitchens, hot tubs, playgrounds, putting greens, etc. Projects that require such features should seek the services of a landscape architect or landscape design firm.\n\nCan I design and/or install my own landscape?\n\nYes! Check out the themed plant lists with mock designs, below, and Aurora Water Conservation’s free classes.\n\nIs there a program that can help me with costs?\n\nFor qualified Aurora Water customers, GRIP is available. Learn more here.\n\nI have received my final design. What do I do next?\n\nIf you are interested in the Grass Replacement Incentive Program (GRIP), read through the program manual. GRIP is a separate program from the Landscape Design program and requires approval to participate. Submit your application and the program manager will contact you to confirm whether or not your landscape has been approved.\n\nIf you are not pursuing the GRIP, contact several landscaping companies to receive a quote for your project. How you implement your design is up to you and your budget – going DIY can be a great way to save money. Check out our videos and in-person classes for tips on how to install your landscape on your own.\n\nWhat if I want to substitute plants in my design for other plant(s)?\n\nDesigns that are not participating in the Grass Replacement Incentive Program (GRIP) are free to substitute plant material. We recommend your substitutions be similar in size, shape and texture to be consistent with the original design. For those participating in the GRIP, substituting plant material after you have made your final changes with our designer and received approval of the design will result in disqualification unless you have received approval for the substitution from the rebate manager.\n\nWhere can I purchase plants?\n\nThere are many local garden centers in the Denver Metro Area and online which carry water-wise plant material. We recommend first checking out local nurseries like Nick’s, Echter’s, Tagawa, Harlequin’s and others before you look at online options such as High Country Gardens. Keep in mind that not all plants for sale meet the city code’s standard size of one gallon for perennials and five gallons for shrubs. For the GRIP, plants must meet those minimum sizes.\n\nWho can help me?\n\nWhile we cannot provide specific recommendations for contractors or landscaping companies to use for your project, below are landscape professional search tools to help you locate a qualified professional.\n\n• Qualified water-efficient landscaper professional search\n\n• Associated Landscape Contractors of Colorado’s find-a-pro search\n\n• Irrigation Association’s find a certified professional.\n\nWhat should I do about irrigation?\n\nDepending on your current system, your design, your budget and your preferences, here are some options:\n\n• Continue to use your existing spray/turf irrigation even though it’s inefficient. Not only will you be watering the open space between the plants, but as your plants grow, they will also obstruct your spray heads.\n\n• Keep your spray heads and upgrade to high-efficiency rotary nozzles. You’ll still be watering open spaces between plants and obstruction will still occur, but it’s still better than the first option.\n\n• Convert your system to drip irrigation. There are a few methods for this process. If you’re interested in DIY, take our Build Your Own Drip System class and watch instructional videos from Rain Bird, Orbit or other irrigation manufacturers.\n\n• Or, reach out to a qualified irrigation contractor. Rebates are available for irrigation efficiency upgrades, including converting spray to drip. See more details here.\n\nWhat soil amendments do I need?\n\nUnlike an annual vegetable garden, perennials don’t require heavy amendments because their life cycle is longer and we aren’t pushing them to produce. Initially, you will want to help get them started with a little compost, but as their root systems grow larger, contact with native soils is important. We recommend that you amend your soil with compost as you plant. Compost is an organic soil amendment, which means it is derived from something that was once alive. These amendments provide many benefits to the soil, such as increasing organic matter, improving soil aeration and the soil’s ability to hold water and nutrients. Inorganic soil amendments are man-made or mined. Types of inorganic soil amendments include expanded shale, mason’s sand and pea gravel. For an organic option, use only Class I or Class II compost. Pea gravel or angular sand may be used as inorganic amendments. We have recently discovered the benefits of bare-root planting. Typically, plant material we purchase from a garden center or big box store is grown in a soil-less medium. This means that it is mostly compost and other amendments, like vermiculite or perlite, peat or coco coir. Rinse this by dipping the plant’s roots into a bucket of water. As the soil-less medium falls away into the bucket, we recommend scooping it out, adding it to the planting hole by thoroughly mixing, then planting your landscape plant. We don’t recommend this with trees or shrubs. If you know your soil type, you will have a better understanding of which amendments—organic or inorganic—you may want to apply to your new landscape. Learn how to tell what soil type you have in our video called Take Our Soil Personality Quiz.

Discuss delivery or pick-up options.\n\n• Pioneer- Aurora: 463 Airport Boulevard, Aurora, CO 80011; 303-340-1440; https://www.pioneerco.com\n\n• Nick’s Garden Center: 2001 S Chambers Rd, Aurora, CO 80014; 303-696-6657; https://nicksgardencenter.com\n\n• The Home Depot: Multiple locations; https://www.homedepot.com\n\n• Lowes: Multiple locations; https://www.lowes.com\n\n• Tagawa Gardens: 7711 S Parker Rd, Centennial, CO 80016; 303.690.4722; https://tagawagardens.com\n\nAlternatives to a landscape supply company include:\n\n• ChipDrop: an app for locating free wood mulch delivered to your home. Large quantities only. Learn more here.\n\n• City of Aurora Free Loader Days: provides free mulch on several days throughout the spring and summer. Learn more here. You can use mulch calculators to estimate how much you may need for your project, below are two options.\n\n• Scott’s: https://www.scotts.com/en-us/tools/mulch-calculator\n\n• Home Depot: https://www.homedepot.com/calculator/mulch\n\nHow do I remove an existing lawn?\n\nDepending on your timeline and budget, several options exist for removing your existing grass. See below for options and refer to Water Conservation’s Installing a Water-wise Landscape class for more details on these options. Chemical: Using glyphosate (non-selective herbicide) to kill the grass. Follow the directions on the label and wear protective clothing for effective, safe use. Mechanical: Rent a sod cutter, which is a gas-powered tool that physically removes the grass in strips. Smother: As the name suggests, smother the grass with layers of cardboard, newspaper and mulch to block light and warmth. You can also use .6mil plastic to smother the grass.\n\nHow do I care for my new landscape? What sort of maintenance does each plant need to keep it healthy and tidy?"
