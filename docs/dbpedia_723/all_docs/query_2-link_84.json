        "text": "As the Winter season gradually releases its grip, the Spring season stands poised to rejuvenate life. The flora and fauna have commenced showing positive signs of growth and activity. The universe is once again regaining vitality. The Masonic community is brimming with enthusiasm at the possibilities that this new season brings.\n\nSpring is a period of readiness, and our interested gentlemen are preparing for their initiation into Freemasonry. At Blazing Star Lodge, every Brother is enthusiastically preparing for the Summer opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nDuring the summer months, Blazing Star Brothers take every opportunity to get involved with the East Aurora community. The town will soon be bustling with activity and events. As part of the East Aurora community since 1817, we joyfully get involved with cookouts and other opportunities to strengthen our contribution to The Village of East Aurora.\n\nOur main charitable outreach, Brothers Of The Bread, continues to grow and provide thousands of loaves of bread, jelly, treats, and green beans to food pantries across New York State and now into Pennsylvania. We are welcoming another Lodge near the Buffalo City limits to assist with at least three new food pantries. We also welcomed a Lodge in Cattaraugus County to help supply our Southertier pantries.\n\nIf you are interested in Freemasonry in East Aurora, NY, and want to help those in need, contribute to the community, and become part of a worldwide fraternity, contact us for an in-person or Zoom meeting to learn more.\n\nBlazing Star Lodge #694 F&AM ‚Äì East Aurora\n\nProud yet unassuming and slightly hidden behind some old-growth trees, the Blazing Star Masonic Lodge stands as a permanent fixture in East Aurora, New York. It overlooks the town with a protective eye ensuring all who pass are good and upright citizens. We like to think that the presence of the Lodge in our town sets a stage of history, pride, and Brotherly love among the members of the Lodge and the citizens of the town.\n\nAs part of the East Aurora, New York community since 1818, the Blazing Star Masonic Lodge actively seeks ways to contribute to the success of our neighbors. We do this by supporting little league baseball, FISH of East Aurora, The Rural Outreach Center, and Scholarships to graduating seniors at Iroquois High School and East Aurora High School. Most recently the formation of Brother Of The Bread, led by Brother Andrew Egressy. We are interested in our community and the people who call East Aurora and surrounding areas, home.\n\nOur members meet in the Lodge every second and fourth Tuesday of each month September through June. Dinners begin at 6:30 pm with communications starting promptly at 7:30 pm. If you are a good and upstanding man, interested in improving your life and the life of everyone around you, please do not hesitate to knock on our door, virtually or literally, before 7:30 pm, and join us for dinner. We encourage social discussions before and after official communications are complete.\n\nSince 1906 our Lodge stands as a building of humble men striving to better themselves and in turn make the world a better place. This is what we do. We would love to talk to you more about Freemasonry please contact us anytime.\n\nWe are not affiliated with any of these Podcasts but they are so informative we wanted to provide a way for our visitors to learn from their content.\n\nMasonic Membership Programs ‚Äî Bro.
