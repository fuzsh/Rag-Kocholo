7 of 7

With its quaint brick buildings and abundant charm, it’s hard to believe that Aurora is Illinois’ second-largest city.

Just an hour from the hustle and bustle of Chicago, Aurora itself is full of first-rate attractions, from nightlife and entertainment to outlet shopping, fun parks and other outdoor spaces.

Stunningly Beautiful Farnsworth House

For a beautiful confluence of architecture and nature, visit the Farnsworth House, a world-famous masterpiece that represents the ultimate refinement of Mies van der Rohe’s minimalist expression of structure and space. After visitors drive through thick forest along the Fox River, the house comes into view – a beautiful, modern design with floor-to-ceiling glass windows, sitting quietly in the middle of a prairie. Though it was built more than 50 years ago, it looks like something you might see in the trendiest design galleries today. Edith Farnsworth commissioned Van Der Rohe to build a weekend getaway; she got much more. In spring, surrounding flowers burst into bloom. Part of the National Trust for Historical Preservation, this special place is definitely worth a visit.
