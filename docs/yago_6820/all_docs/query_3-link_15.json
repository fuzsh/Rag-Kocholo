Yesterday we did half an hour because we had an hour and a half left. Is it the wish of the committee to do 20-minute rotations? Would you like to start with the third party and do it that way for the rest of the week, in turn?\n\nIn fairness, the third-party critic isn't here at the moment. The official opposition party critic isn't here either. Would the government like to start with its 20 minutes? Mrs Haslam, you could finish with the question where you left off yesterday afternoon.\n\nMrs Karen Haslam (Perth): Is there going to be a presentation on the fraud issue here?\n\nThe Chair: No, I think the suggestion was that we dealt with that subject today, but I would suggest that we're dealing with it by questions and answers, and in their answers they can expand into their presentation if they wish.\n\nI'm looking for some direction from the committee. Mr Mahoney, would you be prepared to start this morning? We were going to start with the third party, but since the critic isn't here, we'll start with you.\n\nWelcome to Mr Di Santo and Mr King again this morning. We're back to 20-minute rotations today. We will start with the official opposition.\n\nMr Steven W. Mahoney (Mississauga West): I believe that yesterday I had finished with a question that you suggested had to be answered today. Is that correct?\n\nThe Chair: We were out of time. You're more than welcome to start there if you wish.\n\nMr Mahoney: If I recall correctly, my question to Mr Di Santo had to do with the statement in his letter regarding the flooring issue. I'm just looking for it so I have it exactly. It had to do with the statement wherein he said that the Workers' Compensation Board had some special, unique characteristics different from other businesses that had used this flooring. Mr Di Santo, do you recall that statement?\n\nMr Odoardo Di Santo: I didn't have the letter yesterday, but I have the letter in front of me now.\n\nMr Mahoney: Do you have that statement in front of you, sir?\n\nMr Di Santo: The letter of March 9, 1993?\n\nMr Mahoney: Yes, the letter dated March 9. You make the statement, to quote from your letter, the last page, second-last paragraph: \"Also, the Workers' Compensation Board is unlike many of the corporations you have mentioned in that it has different operational requirements.\" I'm not sure of all of the corporations that Mr Mead mentioned, but they would be corporations like the Royal Bank, the Bank of Canada, the Ontario Provincial Police. What do you mean by this statement, Mr Di Santo?\n\nMr Di Santo: The statement is self-explanatory. The Workers' Compensation Board's new building is a unique building because, among other things, we serve injured workers, we have the largest computer system in North America and we have requirements that perhaps other corporations do not have. It's as simple as that.\n\nMr Mahoney: Could you tell me what they are?\n\nMr Di Santo: Well, I mentioned some of them. I don't understand the point.\n\nMr Mahoney: You're suggesting, as you did during the inquiry into the reasons for building the new building, that the Workers' Compensation Board is unique in the business world, I guess you could say. Here you're suggesting that you are unlike many of the corporations that use the Canadian-made flooring.\n\nMr Di Santo: That's right.\n\nMr Mahoney: I'm just asking you to tell us in what way you are unlike. If you're servicing customers, be they injured workers or bank clients or witnesses, you're using desks, you're using telephones, you're using computers, you're using other technology, you're using photocopiers. Aside from the fact that you service injured workers, because that's simply your client base, what is it that makes the Workers' Compensation Board so unique that would preclude you from buying a Canadian product and going to this American product?\n\nMs Sharon Murdock (Sudbury): It doesn't preclude it.\n\nMr Di Santo: I object to the innuendo that that was the reason for preventing us from buying Canadian product, because that was not at any point a factor in the decision that was made. The decision was made on the basis of a number of factors, and --\n\nMr Mahoney: Excuse me; I'm sorry. I didn't ask you on what basis the decision was made. I asked you to explain the statement in your letter. Did you write this letter, Mr Di Santo?\n\nMr Di Santo: But I won't let you make the innuendo that that was the reason that prevented us from getting a Canadian company --\n\nMr Mahoney: You said it, sir, I didn't.\n\nMr Di Santo: -- because that was not the point.\n\nThe Chair: Let's just have one person speak at a time. When Mr Di Santo --\n\nMr Mahoney: With respect, Madam Chair, if I might --\n\nThe Chair: Well, if you could do it without interrupting him more than once.\n\nMr Mahoney: Madam Chair, I've asked a question that relates to this. I did not ask a question about the reasons they bought a different product. I am quite prepared to ask that question. I asked him to tell me, in what way is the Workers' Compensation Board so unique or unlike these other corporations? That's all.\n\n1010\n\nMr Di Santo: Well, Madam Chair, I said --\n\nThe Chair: Excuse me, Mr Di Santo. You have a point of order, Mr Marchese?\n\nMr Rosario Marchese (Fort York): Madam Chair, Mr Mahoney understands the process in terms of how it works with people who come before this committee. Abuse is one of the things that we don't do. If Mr Mahoney feels he's not answering the question, when he's got his turn again he can say, \"Please say this instead of\" whatever, but he should allow him the courtesy to finish the answer.\n\nMr Mahoney: That's fine. Thank you.\n\nThe Chair: Please proceed, Mr Di Santo.\n\nMr Di Santo: Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to premise that the choice made by the contractor, by Eastern, was based on a recommendation made by the facilities strategy team of which the Workers' Compensation Board is part. That was based on a number of factors, and I added that also the unique nature of the business we do was part of that decision.\n\nWhy is the Workers' Compensation Board different from the OPP, from other corporations? Because we serve every year 100,000 injured workers and we have, as I said before, the largest computer system in North America. Right now, we have incredible problems. If you visit the building, we will show you the ceiling when we have to plug a new line, the inconveniences to our staff and to our clients, ultimately.\n\nWe have an imaging system which is very large. In fact, we are a paperless company; all of our files are on imaging. We have a higher than average number of telephone lines because we serve 377,000 injured workers every year. Doesn't that make our institution unique?\n\nMr Mahoney: Thank you. I'd like to ask Mr King if he made the comment that is attributed to him. Madam Chair, let me preface this by saying that I very much would like to get into service delivery. Although this flooring contract causes me great consternation --\n\nMrs Haslam: You're the only one.\n\nMr Mahoney: -- I'd like to get into many of the other issues. Well, if it doesn't bother you, that's fine.\n\nMrs Haslam: No, I mean it's not the place.\n\nMr Mahoney: I really have some difficulty with this issue, and I'd like to know if Mr King made the statement that was attributed to him in the Toronto Star. I'll read from the article. It says, \"Outside the meeting room King was more succinct: `Would you rather the floor collapsed?' he told reporters.\" Did you say that, sir?\n\nMr Brian King: I was met on the way into the meeting room yesterday with a scrum of media who asked me why we had chosen the concrete flooring over the wooden flooring. I indicated that was a decision made by professional engineers and by professional people, that it wasn't my decision to make, as a nonprofessional, as a non-architect, as a non-engineering person, to choose whether it should be a concrete or wooden floor, and I may very well have said that if I made the decision it may very well have been a floor that collapsed. I have to rely on professional advice on these matters, not on political considerations.\n\nMr Mahoney: What do you mean by that, sir? What political considerations?\n\nMr King: It is reasonably well known in Canada that some decisions made about buildings and tendering aren't based upon the quality of the product but based upon narrow political considerations such as whether the matter goes to certain favoured parties.\n\nMr Mahoney: Are you suggesting my concerns are narrow political concerns?\n\nMr King: I didn't say that at all. I'm sorry if you --\n\nMr Mahoney: What exactly do you mean? I don't understand what you mean by that. What political considerations would possibly enter into the decision on giving a contract out for anything, be it walls, ceilings, flooring? I would certainly assume there would be no political consideration.\n\nMr King: One would certainly hope there would be no political considerations taken into account in any contracting in the public sector. I've read recently about speculation about turning Pearson airport over to the private sector, to a consortium of companies led by former party presidents and members of a political party. Now, whether that's political consideration or good business, I leave for others to decide.\n\nMr Mahoney: Interesting analogy. I don't know what your building or your corporation has to do with that whatsoever. Is it safe to say that this report is accurate, with regard to the floor collapsing? I guess you indicate that it is.\n\nMr King: I made no reference to the type of flooring as represented by ASP flooring as collapsing in Simcoe Place. I said that professionals had given us the opinion that for our business needs, for the type of office tower that's being constructed, it should be the concrete flooring. We made that decision ahead of the tender being let to the interested subcontractors, the flooring subcontractors. The contractor in question bid on the concrete flooring, and only after it lost that bid in an open and free competition did it start complaining that we had chosen what we tendered for rather than what it wanted us to go out to the market for.\n\nThe Chair: Excuse me, Mr King. You just interrupted Mr Mahoney.\n\nMr King: I apologize.\n\nThe Chair: It has to work both ways if it's going to work. I just wanted to point that out.\n\nMr Mahoney: No problem, Madam Chair. I'm a big boy.\n\nMr King: I apologize, Madam Chair.\n\nMr Mahoney: You've again reiterated the statement, sir, that you made yesterday with regard to the fact that this company came in after it lost the bid. That's incorrect, sir, and I believe you know that's incorrect.\n\nIf you don't, I think you should check with the people who are building this project, because they very clearly -- they went to the extent of taking some of your construction people on a tour of the Royal Bank project which they're currently installing this floor in, prior to the tender being submitted. They attempted to communicate to you, to Mr Di Santo, to the Premier and to the Minister of Labour on an ongoing basis, prior to the tender being opened, that they had a Canadian alternative that not only was acceptable but had a longer warranty than the American alternative, had a 20% greater load capacity than the American alternative.\n\nThey tried to communicate all of this. They tried to communicate the fact that the product itself, the American-made access floor system, \"has been manufactured for less than half a year and has no proven lifespan.\" No one would listen to them. The purchase of their floor system would \"keep 50...factory workers employed for another year, not to mention the...suppliers\" etc. No one would listen to them. The Canadian-made flooring \"meets or exceeds all your loading requirements.\"\n\nYou're trying to suggest that they came in afterwards with some sour grapes.\n\nInterjection.\n\nMr Mahoney: If the member wants to continue interrupting me, Madam Chair, perhaps you could call her to order.\n\nThey attempted to bring all of these issues to your attention and got nowhere. You have almost damaged, by the way -- now, we all get taken out of context; maybe that's what you want to say, that you were taken out of context, but you have damaged this company's reputation and this product's reputation, a product, I reiterate, that is approved by the Ministry of Housing for use in the province of Ontario, that's being used by government agencies.\n\nDoesn't that concern the members opposite? Obviously, it doesn't. But I'm very concerned, Mr King, when I read this this morning, that you would leave some kind of suggestion that this Canadian-made product is inferior and indeed might collapse under the specific, unique, unusual uses required by the Workers' Compensation Board.\n\nI think you owe this company a written clarification or apology, certainly a clarification at the very least, that you were not casting aspersions on their product. This is an Ontario company, which you rely on for your job, sir, I might add, as one of the companies that support the Workers' Compensation Board. They pay $50,000 a year to the Workers' Compensation Board, Mr Di Santo. I think that's a credible amount for an Ontario small business to pay in support of your organization. To have your officials publicly castigating their product is just totally unacceptable.\n\nI wonder if you might be prepared to offer to Mr Mead, who, if he's not here yet, will be here some time today, some form of clarification or apology with regard to the statement reported in the Star this morning, Mr King.\n\nMr King: I certainly will, in front of this committee and in front of Mr Mead, indicate that I had no critique to make of their particular product. I did indicate that the decision as to what type of flooring would be best for the WCB, would be most efficient, would be most effective, was a professional call, not that of a bureaucrat. You have to rely on those who have been trained in this area, and that is the decision we relied upon as a facilities strategy group.\n\n1020\n\nThe media report that indicated that I don't want a floor that falls down had no reference to ASP flooring's product but to the fact that we have got to accept professional advice, not make decisions based upon political considerations but upon professional considerations. If anyone misunderstood, including yourself or ASP, I apologize.\n\nMr Mahoney: Okay. I think it's appropriate that you do apologize, but how you could suggest that it wasn't a reference to ASP flooring -- that's what the whole article is about. Obviously your comment that you don't want a floor that would collapse, none of us would want to see that, but obviously you'd be making that comment in reference to the alternative product that was offered to the Workers' Compensation Board. You weren't making it in terms of some imagined product; you were talking about the access flooring provided as an alternative by ASP flooring out of Oakville. That's what the question would be about, and you expressed concerns that could be taken in no way other than to suggest, \"Would you rather the floor collapsed?\"\n\nI just want the record to show that this is a first-class product, made in Canada; that this is a product that could have been installed in your building for $500,000 cheaper than the one you've decided to buy out of Grand Rapids, Michigan; that very clearly this product is installed in millions of square feet of flooring throughout the country, throughout the province of Ontario; that corporations like the Royal Bank, the Bank of Canada and the Ontario Provincial Police have decided to use this flooring.\n\nThis is not inferior flooring. They all have similar problems. They have hundreds of thousands of customers, Mr Di Santo, you'd be surprised to know, who go through the bank buildings every year, very similar to the numbers that would go through workers' compensation, plodding and jumping up and down on the floor when they're unhappy, I suppose, at whatever it is they're unhappy about. I fail to understand the uniqueness of your corporation with regard to something like the technical recommendations.\n\nMr King has made reference to not having a political consideration. I would certainly hope that would be the case. I would not want to see political interference in a decision to award a contract; that's certainly not what this committee is about. This committee is about questioning decisions made that you were part of, I presume. Maybe you can help me with that.\n\nThe strategy team, I understand in the letter from Mr Di Santo -- a letter that is quite technical, I might add, for someone who is not technically oriented. I'm quite impressed with Mr Di Santo's grasp of the situation, because it is quite technical in giving the reasons and justification to Mr Mead for not using this flooring. But you refer, Mr Di Santo, to members of the facilities strategy team. Does that strategy team include a direct representative, ie, staff or a consultant, for the Workers' Compensation Board?\n\nMr Di Santo: Yes.\n\nMr Mahoney: More than one?\n\nMr Di Santo: More than one.\n\nMr Mahoney: So they would have input into this.\n\nMr Di Santo: Absolutely.\n\nMr Mahoney: Would they come back to you or Mr King for advice on something of this nature?\n\nMr Di Santo: No.\n\nMr Mahoney: Mr King, would they come to you?\n\nMr King: The facilities strategy team did not come back to Mr Di Santo or myself with respect to the professional recommendation of engineers and architects as to what floor we should have.\n\nMr Mahoney: Are you aware, Mr King --\n\nThe Chair: Time.\n\nMr Mahoney: Sorry. Am I out of time?\n\nThe Chair: You are this time.\n\nMrs Haslam: There is a God.\n\nMrs Elizabeth Witmer (Waterloo North): Madam Chair, are we focusing on fraud this morning?\n\nInterjections.\n\nMr Mahoney: Madam Chair, I thought it was open.\n\nThe Chair: It is open.\n\nMrs Witmer: Okay, I will focus my attention on that area initially, because I think there is some information that I would like to receive from you, Mr King. You did instigate and set up a comprehensive fraud strategy about a year ago, and you've obviously been very busy since then investigating some of the fraudulent happenings that have been occurring in this province. There's been a suggestion that because of what's happening in the United States, there are organized gangs that are moving into the border cities to capitalize on our compensation system. Could you give me a little more information about what exactly is happening with those gangs?\n\nMr King: I will be as forthcoming as I possibly can with the committee, recognizing that some of these matters are under criminal investigation at the present time. Insurance fraud in the United States has proven to be a rather large business of recent years, and some of the states have been particularly vigilant in cracking down upon the insurance fraud, on the organized groups that have been pursuing the assets of insurance companies, like workers' compensation boards, especially on the west coast of the United States, in California and the states of Washington and Oregon, and it has been reported through criminal intelligence bodies in Canada that some of those people who have been squeezed out of the operations in the United States have moved or are moving north of the border.\n\nBasically, some of the types of operations they get involved in are to set up dummy companies, which are basically paper shells, to then file claims for employees who exist only on paper, and have a medical practitioner wrapped into the loop so that all three requirements for a workers' compensation claim would be met by what is basically a paper or a shell company; that is, an employer would report an injury, a worker would presumably report and a medical practitioner would report all at the same time.\n\nIn an organization like the WCB where you have around 400,000 claims a year, to put too many screens or too many blocks in front of the acceptance of a claim would lead to incredible delays. Therefore, we have relied traditionally on these three safety valves or safeguards: the employer report, the worker report and the doctor's or the medical practitioner's report. If all three of those reports are bogus or are somehow faked or not properly put together, we are vulnerable to an attack by a fraudulent exercise. That's the sort of thing I was referring to when I reported that very organized attacks on the assets of the WCB were being imported into Canada.\n\nMrs Witmer: Have you communicated with the states that have been vigilant to determine how you might counteract this?\n\nMr King: I was in Baltimore, Maryland, about two weeks ago at a meeting of the American state compensation funds, where I spent particular attention in dealing with those states that have developed a fraud strategy to see whether ours was of equal scrutiny. I am planning on going, if these hearings end, to Portland later this month for another meeting of American states. One of the key issues in that meeting is on fraud and fraud awareness and fraud prevention. We're very aware of the need for partnership with those who have already met the fraud situation and who have experience in it.\n\nI would point out, in addition, that I indicated yesterday that we have made approaches to the RCMP, to the OPP, to the Metro police forces and the regional police forces. The director of my special investigation branch was in this morning at 7, on the way to Niagara to meet with the Niagara Regional Police Force. We have partnered or developed networks with the UIC, the Ministry of Community and Social Services and the Health ministry so that parties are aware of common concerns and common problems and will call each other if there is the need to know what's going on.\n\n1030\n\nMrs Witmer: I was going to ask you that question. That's obviously very important, as we're seeing fraud in many of those other areas as well and it's probably some of the same people who are responsible for the fraudulent claims.\n\nThere are of course the two types of fraud, the internal and the external. What methods are you using to detect the internal fraud, and is it greater than the external fraud?\n\nMr King: I was badly misquoted, and for that I feel guilty, in terms of the 5,000 employees of the Ontario Workers' Compensation Board. In response to a question at a news conference, I indicated that the greatest potential for large-scale fraud resided in someone who had access to the internal computer systems because one individual can direct programs to create numerous payments, whereas those who are outside the board have a more limited ability to attack the assets of the board. This came out in the media as, \"The biggest problem with fraud is internal.\" No, the biggest potential problem and where you have to be most concerned is over the security of your systems.\n\nYour specific question was what we're doing internally to deal with the problem. The first step is human resources in the recruiting, to make sure the people we recruit are the sorts of people we wish to have working at the Workers' Compensation Board; that they not come, for instance, on the basis of a political suggestion from a minister, as may have happened in the past, but they come based upon their merit and ability to do the job for us.\n\nThe second is that we have routine monitoring, on a spot basis, of files that people are handling through internal audit processes. It's called an audit universe, where every area where you are at risk in an organization like the WCB is subject to a random audit at any point in time, so that people never know when they're apt to have an auditor come in and look over what they're doing.\n\nThe third area is a systems concern, that is, are our computer systems using passwords so that only those people who are properly authorized to get in and deal with a system go in and deal with it. We have beefed up very considerably our passwords and our computer security systems.\n\nMrs Witmer: I was interested in one of your comments. You indicated that some individuals had been appointed or received jobs and that they were political recommendations.\n\nMr James J. Bradley (St Catharines): That doesn't happen now, of course, with this government at all.\n\nMrs Witmer: I'd just be interested. Has this been a problem that has created some fraudulent situations, Mr King?\n\nMr Bradley: How did Mr King get his job?\n\nMr Mahoney: Or Mr Di Santo.\n\nMr King: I can only respond for the past two and a half years, that the hiring at the Workers' Compensation Board has been on the basis of merit and ability and the promotions at the Workers' Compensation Board have been on the basis of merit and ability. I have 20 years' experience with the Ontario compensation system as an external observer and one who has known the various leaders of the Ontario system for the past 20 years. Anecdotally, various members of those leaders over the years have indicated to me that they have been required to hire certain people, but that's about as far as I could go. I don't know of individuals.\n\nMr Bradley: This government takes no back seat in patronage, I can assure you of that, to any government.\n\nMrs Witmer: I'd like to focus now on another area; this is an area I'd like to receive some more information about. You talked about the suppliers as also being an area where certainly there is a situation and a possibility for abuse. The taxis giving claimants rides to rehabilitation centres: How much of a problem is that with the taxi drivers, and how can that happen?\n\nMr King: The Workers' Compensation Board used to have a series of chits or requisitions that workers would be given to allow them to be pre-authorized to use a taxi if they couldn't take public transit. Someone who is in a wheelchair, for instance, couldn't necessarily take a subway or a bus.\n\nThe dilemma was that the board lacked the controls to assure that those were being properly handed out to injured workers and being properly consolidated when the bill came in. That control weakness arose about 9 or 10 months ago with the arrest of a Toronto taxi driver who had defrauded the Workers' Compensation Board of some $50,000 for taxi chits that were submitted and for which rides never occurred. That was on the basis of a worker who had been receiving rides and had legitimately been submitting the bills but stopped submitting them at a certain point in time and the cab driver was able to continue submitting them. We have received full repayment of that $50,000, and the necessary controls have been put in place to prevent that sort of blanket requisition from being given to any supplier like a cab driver.\n\nMrs Witmer: If we take a look at the transportation and we take a look at the mileage claims, there was an article earlier this year that indicated that mileage expenses for the WCB totalled $19 million in 1992. You've indicated that there's a possibility of fraud as far as the taxi drivers are concerned. What about the individuals who are claiming mileage? What type of audit or check takes place?\n\nMr King: Mileage to workers is authorized if they have to come for a specialized medical treatment that's not available in their home community. For instance, perhaps in Thunder Bay there is not the type of specialist who would be able to treat a neurological condition of some sort that's as a result of a work injury. In order to get a worker recovered quickly, to give them the medical treatment that would allow them to rehabilitate and return to work, we're quite likely to approve them coming to a centre where there is such a specialty and would approve a payment for them to fly into Toronto, for instance. Those are checked against the medical reports that we receive for the service thus rendered.\n\nIn addition, people may come into Toronto and receive payment to stay or to be treated at the rehabilitation centre. Amputees are provided with artificial limbs at the rehabilitation centre, and those again are checked against the actual treatment that is given.\n\nFinally, workers can be authorized mileage or travel expenses if they're attending a training course that will result in them getting the skills to return to work. If you live in Timmins and there is a course available to you in North Bay that will allow you to get the education or the skills to go back to work, you may be authorized mileage to attend that training course. These are checked by health care adjudicators on the basis of existing rules.\n\n1040\n\nI will add that that is one of the areas covered by the comprehensive fraud strategy I spoke of, the assurance that such rules and procedures provide minimum loopholes for abuse.\n\nMrs Witmer: I personally believe that in the area of mileage and a personal automobile there's a tremendous potential for fraud. I don't care whether it's WCB or any other organization: The potential exists, and we know it happens. I was personally involved at one time in checking mileage, for five years, and I certainly came across it. I would hope you would be vigilant.\n\nYou've indicated as well that perhaps there's some medical fraud in terms of the doctors and the people involved in the rehabilitation. What's happening there, and what methods are being used to counteract that?\n\nMr King: Again, I repeat my opening statement that I must be somewhat discreet because of a very intensive ongoing investigation. We have 170,000 pensioners who are receiving disability pensions from the Workers' Compensation Board who may require ongoing medical and drugs for their condition. We have in addition, at any one point in time, 70,000 temporarily disabled workers who all may be receiving medical treatment and/or drugs. The potential, given those quarter of a million Ontarians who are receiving medical and drugs, for overbilling or for billing for services not received is rather significant.\n\nWe do have an ability to profile suppliers through our computer programs to show average billings. In cases where norms are not met or the norms are exceeded, some work may have to be done to determine whether that is just a popular supplier or whether in fact it's something that requires greater investigation.\n\nWe have presently a partnership with the Ontario Provincial Police and with the Metro police forces to look into certain situations regarding supplier and health care supplier benefits. They're right in the midst of a very intensive ongoing investigation, and I hesitate to go much further in that particular area, but I'd be pleased try and help you on other questions.\n\nMrs Witmer: Mr King, I appreciate the efforts you have certainly put forward to investigate fraud, but it's been suggested by the critics that fraud totals somewhere in the neighbourhood of $500 million. You've indicated that you believe it's closer to $150 million. Do you still hold by that figure? You've had a chance to look at it more thoroughly.\n\nMr King: The numbers you quote are always as a result of a speculative story in the Financial Post that indicated up to $500 million of fraud in the workers' compensation system. The best I can gather in speaking to the source of that report and in picking up on where it might have come from was that there was a brief report that indicated the potential for about 17% fraud on one study of welfare payments.\n\nI had responded by indicating that the professional forensic auditors I have talked to from two Toronto forensic auditing firms would estimate the fraud potential in the WCB to be closer to 5% rather than 17%. I had taken the gross figure of $3 billion of benefits and extrapolated out that a professional estimate would be closer to $150 million rather than the speculative figure of $500 million. If I were to estimate what I would call criminal fraud, I would estimate closer to the forensic auditing, the professionals' estimate, which would be closer to $150 million.\n\nIf people want to define fraud as someone who goes fishing while receiving benefits, then perhaps the speculative figure of $500 million may be closer. That is a problem with claims management. That is a problem with people's perceptions about what you can and cannot do while you're claiming total benefits.\n\nBut in short, $150 million would be closer to the figure.\n\nMrs Witmer: How does that percentage compare to the other provinces? You've had experience in Manitoba. Is that similar?\n\nMr King: Ontario is doing more right now than any of the other 11 jurisdictions in Canada to deal with the fraud problem. We have been in touch with all of the Canadian boards to discuss this with them. I believe it fair to say that there are three provinces with the largest potential, because of the populations and because of their closeness to large urban populations in the United States, and that would be British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario.\n\nIn contacting those boards, we would put ourselves well ahead. They don't consider the problem to be nearly as serious in their jurisdictions; that could be reality or that could be wishful thinking. All I'm indicating to you is that we have put in place the resources to do proper investigations and to deal with it in Ontario, and we consider it to be a problem in Ontario that we have to deal with.\n\nMrs Haslam: I have some questions on this topic. Mr Di Santo, I'm going to pass on your answer, and I still like you. I will have an opportunity to ask that another day, I think, and I'll leave that for the time.\n\nIn your opening statement, Mr King, I was very interested in what you said about the cost to industry of $2 billion a year, that private Canadian industry has a fraud problem of $2 billion a year. Ms Witmer mentioned a little about it and youe followed up on that. What I have to ask about it, though, is this: We are also prepared to cooperate with the private insurance industry in mutual efforts to reduce fraud where we are legally able to do so. I wondered how you were working with the private insurance industry to do that, if you could elaborate a bit on that last statement.\n\nMr King: There may be situations where there is double insuring, where workers or employers or suppliers or others, in addition to workers' compensation protection in case of injury, may have private insurance coverage for injury. What I intended to indicate by my comments was that where freedom of information rules allow us to do so, if people may be collecting from both ourselves and a private insurer, we would do what we could to try to prevent that from happening. That was the basis for that comment. Where we come across evidence on our files that there is double collection on the part of anyone, we would try to determine whether it is an area we can deal with or investigate.\n\nThe other thing I think I may have mentioned is that, as someone who has been interested in the Canadian social security system, the incoherence of the federal-provincial planning in the area of social security I think is something that has to be looked at.\n\nWe have a Canada pension plan that has a disability aspect to it. We have an unemployment insurance system that has a disability aspect to it. We have a workers' compensation system, which is provincial, which is for disability. We have the Ministry of Community and Social Services which looks to those who may have a problem because of disability. We have disabled veterans' programs which look to people who may have disability. We have automobile insurance programs that try to move in where people may suffer an injury and there is a disability.\n\nI think somebody has to take a lead in saying, how are we going to bring all of these programs together and rationalize them? Quite frankly, right now I can't get Canada pension, for instance, to share anything with us. They may be making payments I know nothing about to the worker we are also trying to pay. I think we're past the day when we can have such a mixture of systems without some rationale and coherence to them, and that will require federal-provincial cooperation.\n\nMrs Haslam: Am I to understand that there might be cases where they are collecting from one of those other people you mentioned plus WCB benefits?\n\n1050\n\nMr King: There are situations where people could be collecting from the Canada pension plan disability for the same injury they're collecting from workers' compensation for, and because we are not authorized to use things like social insurance numbers there's no common identifier. The federal government will say, \"We're a first-payer and we don't care what the provinces do.\" We simply cannot, in an efficient way, determine who should be making what payments and what offsets there should be. It does cause a significant problem for every compensation board in Canada.\n\nMrs Haslam: I'd like to take that a little further and look at something in the Ministry of Health called northern travel grants. You were talking, when Ms Witmer questioned you, on mileage and coming to a specialist, let's say, in Toronto from the north. Under the Ministry of Health northern travel grants, there is an application process where a person can have their mileage, I believe, paid through the northern travel grant. Is it a possibility that they then would double that by applying through your operation for the same mileage? Is there anything you have in place for that particular aspect of fraud?\n\nMr King: I will profess total ignorance of the northern travel allowance. I make an undertaking to you that I will alert our special investigations branch to network with that particular program, to make sure we have in place the controls necessary to make sure people get paid, if they're deserving of a payment, but not get double-paid.\n\nMrs Haslam: I have a couple of questions. Ms Witmer was mentioning doctors. I've had cases where some doctors won't do WCB cases and therefore it's difficult to obtain the necessary medical practitioner if you go in and say, \"This is a workers' compensation claim.\" That results sometimes in the doctors who will do it having most of the cases. You're saying you're looking at those patterns. I'm only mentioning that as one aspect of that pattern, because I know of cases where some doctors do it because they're the only ones in town that will do it.\n\nThe other problem I see with doctors is that in some cases their diagnosis is not accepted. I have a claimant come in and say, \"I have my doctor's diagnosis here and now they want me to go to Toronto to have three more doctors look at me for the same situation.\" That's an additional cost to OHIP for additional trips to doctors in many cases. Why is that the case?\n\nMr King: I want to leave no misimpression with these committee members or with the public of Ontario that we would question doctors who are popular or who have a large practice. That is not the sort of situation I was referring to. I was referring to revolving door situations where just the sheer numbers that are being billed to us, the mechanics of getting that many workers through and talking to them all and doing a report on them all, defies imaginative planning. The numbers don't add up to the time available. I want to make very clear that I'm not questioning the medical profession.\n\nSecondly, I think you've asked, why would we question a diagnosis of a family physician? We're a program that many times has pressures from two directions. One direction is the worker and the worker's physician saying that their diagnosis is this and they should be allowed to do that type of treatment.\n\nThat may not meet the demands of the employer on an appeal, for instance, who says, \"I have a job in terms of light duties or in terms of alternative employment or accommodation.\" Sometimes, to break the deadlock or to break the adversarial situation, to referee as the legislation itself suggests we should do in terms of the non-economic loss award, where there is a medical referee allowed, where there is a dispute over the medical diagnosis or prognosis, we would call for a refereed situation.\n\nI don't believe it's that widespread, but I won't deny that you have cases where workers are coming in.\n\nMrs Haslam: Talking about fraud, I know you have increased the number of people in a unit who are working on fraud. We hear about fraud cases, yet the charges have been few. Are there some explanations, or are there some projections of charges being laid? Are there some time lines you're looking at? I know we take up a lot of your time here at the Legislature, but more along the lines of whether you have projections or whether you have any idea of how this new fraud section will help in the laying of charges and in the stopping of the fraud that may or may not be present.\n\nMr King: The number of charges to be laid ultimately is going to be an agreement between police forces which we bring the material to and the crown prosecutors who are the ones ultimately to make the call. I could go through statistics. I'm not too sure that's as important as to indicate to you that we have something like 430 files under active investigation at the present time. If the norm holds true in past patterns, approximately 10% of those would be coming forward with sufficient evidence to lay charges. But that may just be the surface, because there are 822 that are presently being looked at to see if they fit the qualifications for a fraud investigation, and more keeping coming in every day.\n\nMy best advice to you is that we are going to see significantly more charges laid in the third quarter of 1993, and in the fourth quarter of 1993 we will see even more charges laid, and I would predict that by the first quarter of 1994, there may be a rather huge number of charges laid.\n\nMrs Haslam: Just before I yield, when you talk about charges, you're talking about the four areas you mention. I don't want to leave the impression that it's only so many cases against workers. There are various charges, and you named four areas: suppliers, employers, employees, and internal employees and workers. Out of those cases, it would be a variety of cases?\n\nMr King: Yes. There have been charges laid against all four of the categories you have just outlined, and there will be future charges laid against all four categories you have just outlined.\n\nMrs Haslam: Okay, I'll stop there. I know my colleagues have questions.\n\nMs Jenny Carter (Peterborough): I'm glad we just reminded ourselves at this point that there are the four different directions from which fraud can come, because I think there's a bit of a tendency to see it all as being with the claimants, when in fact there are these other kinds of fraud.\n\nI want to come at this from a slightly different angle. I've been told by somebody back in my riding who deals with the board that adjudicators have forgotten that their purpose is to serve injured workers and that they make them jump through hoops. What this means is that a lot of claims are turned down and end up going to appeals, and I understand that 75% of these appeals are won. In other words, a lot of genuine claimants are being turned down, and the fact that they then go on to appeals obviously means that more public money is being spent, because it's a long-drawn-out process -- I understand it takes about six months -- and meanwhile a lot of innocent people may have their lives ruined, lose their houses, whatever.\n\nI'm wondering whether, just to tighten up the system, because we say, \"Oh, well, it was fraud, so we've got to make it even more difficult for claimants to succeed,\" that might not be counterproductive both from the aspect of justice to workers and financially. I wonder if you could comment on that.\n\n1100\n\nMr Di Santo: If we had a different system of insurance, we could probably have a different adjudication system and we could accept all the claims, because if there is a disability and that disability results in a loss of income, then the worker is compensated regardless of the cause or the reasons the disability happened and the loss of income resulted. But we have a Workers' Compensation Act that we have to implement, and the Workers' Compensation Act --\n\nMr Mahoney: You're out of water.\n\nInterjections.\n\nMrs Haslam: She was afraid you were full of saliva and ready to go for 20 minutes, right?\n\nMr Di Santo: We have a Workers' Compensation Act we have to abide by, and we are required to make judgement calls every day. Last year we had 377,000 accidents, and the majority of those accidents were dealt with in a very swift way and compensated.\n\nWhat you're referring to are cases that are not easy to deal with because there are complications. For instance, to give you an example, the causation is not very clear, so we have to see if we can adjudicate and at the same time respect the law, because we cannot just accept any claim.\n\nIn many cases, the adjudicators make mistakes, because they are human, and in many cases they are forced to make decisions based on incomplete evidence, not because they want to make a decision without evidence but because in some instances the evidence is not readily available. In some circumstances the evidence is not forwarded by the parties interested in the adjudication. The result is that they do make mistakes and therefore an appeal results.\n\nThe appeal I think is a safeguard not only for the worker but also for the employer; in fact, the employers in Ontario can appeal claims as the workers do. But as I said before, out of 370,000 accidents, only 3.7% are denied, for many reasons. I'm not saying that we are right; as I said before, and I restate, it's possible that some of those decisions are wrong. Why they are wrong, there is a variety of reasons, as I told you.\n\nWhat are we doing as administration and as a board of directors? Let's not forget that the policies are developed not by Brian King and myself but by the board of directors, and four of the board members out of eight represent the workers, so they have a vested interest that justice is done to the workers, who deserve justice.\n\nWhen we came to the board, we looked at the situation and we noticed, as Brian King told you yesterday, that we had a large pool of our workers who were adjudicator assistants who were unable to make decisions, for many reasons. One of the reasons was that they didn't have proper training and their classification didn't allow them to have a relevant role in the decision-making process. So we reorganized the adjudication branch. Not only that, but we did something very fundamental: We asked our adjudicators to be trained on a permanent basis.\n\nMr King told you yesterday how many resources we are devoting to training our staff, because if they are not knowledgeable they will most likely make more mistakes and therefore wrong decisions will result. So we are training, and we made the commitment last year with the board of directors; we are developing the plan for 1994, and training is a central feature of the job of the adjudicators.\n\nAnother important aspect I want to tell you is that when we came before the standing committee on resources development in 1991, one of the objections we were faced with was exactly what you said at the outset in your remarks, that the adjudicators are playing games with injured workers. I think we must understand that adjudicators are human beings like all of us. They are doing a job, a very delicate job, and I think we all understand that they're not there to play games.\n\nBut when you have 150 or 160 files, perhaps you cannot devote all the time that you want to one claim, and sometimes because of the pressure of the job you can be brash or not be as polite as you want. But we have put an incredible emphasis on that, and we told all our workers -- this was the first letter we sent the staff -- that you have to treat injured workers with respect, because they come to us at the most difficult time in their lives. We have to respect them if we want to be respected, you have to treat them with humanity, and I think that's happening.\n\nMr Mahoney: Just to show that I'm not totally one-dimensional, I'm going to leave the --\n\nInterjection.\n\nMr Mahoney: Well, I'm going to come back to it.\n\nMr Bradley: I do hope so.\n\nMr Mahoney: You can rest assured, because I have a number of other questions and concerns about the tendering process on the new building, but I want to address some of the other areas, particularly around service delivery.\n\nWe heard yesterday, in both the presentation by Mr Di Santo and by Mr King -- I would say that you left the impression that there's a high level of satisfaction both with the staff and the relationship that Mr King has developed with the staff, with many of the memos and the suggestion box concept that you've been working on with your staff. You certainly seemed to believe that there's a high level of satisfaction and teamwork and camaraderie.\n\nI don't know if you'd be surprised to know, but I would think that in the majority of MPPs' constituency offices, certainly in mine and I know many of my colleagues', the number one issue is dissatisfaction with workers' compensation, whether it be from the point of view of the injured worker or the employer.\n\nI'm sure you're familiar with the Employers' WCB Crisis Committee, made up of some 200 corporations. In my riding, they would include -- well, in everyone's riding there's Brewers Retail, but there's also Metroland Printing, Rockett Lumber, Kaneff group of companies, some very substantial companies within Mississauga. They've joined this crisis committee in an attempt to suggest reforms for workers' compensation.\n\nOne of the areas they've suggested could do with reform is in the area of the integrated service units. They have suggested tendering out three of the 12 units that are set up around the province to the private insurance sector, to allow them to compete, in essence. Rather than simply dealing with the suggestion made by the critic for the third party and others that workers' compensation simply be privatized, you have to look at what you do with that $11-billion unfunded liability if you're going to throw out into simply the private sector. I accept that that's a very real problem, because the answer to that is that you transfer it to the government -- that's probably the only answer -- which means the taxpayers get hit again.\n\nThe issue, though, that both the crisis committee and I have thought might make some sense would be to open up the coverage of workers' compensation to the private sector, to compete with the Workers' Compensation Board. You would be one of several insurance companies. I, as a small business person, would contact my insurance broker and say: \"I've got 100 employees. I need workers' compensation coverage, insurance protection for my workers, and for my business, because I need to make sure that while they're off, they're being covered while I replace them with another wage.\" So it benefits all parties.\n\n1110\n\nI'm thinking in terms of the Zurichs, the Dominions of Canada, the large insurance companies which would then put together a package. My broker would go to market, as it's called, and would come back with five quotes and say, \"Mr Business Person, Madam Business Person, here are the quotes for workers' compensation, here are the quotes for your fleet, for your auto, here are the quotes for your liability, your fire protection,\" whatever it might be. Then the Workers' Compensation Board would be one of those five companies perhaps being quoted to the business by the insurance broker.\n\nCertainly the insurance brokers of Ontario would be delighted. It would give them a new product with which to service the customers they're already servicing with fleet and other types of insurance. I suspect, depending on the cost rate, that the insurance companies would be interested in providing such a service, and this would then force your corporation, your agency, to be competitive with the private sector. How do you feel about that? Either one.\n\nMr King: I'll give you a brief response. The model you suggest is a prevalent model south of the 49th parallel in the United States, where about one quarter of the states have a state fund, which presumably would be the compensation board, and the private insurance companies compete against that state fund. Other states in the United States have a totally free-market approach, with the private insurance industry being the only underwriter for coverage.\n\nOne of the things you will find if you attend the conferences of the state governments in the United States -- well, two things really. First, the little employer gets hosed every time because the bigger employers can walk into the marketplace with some clout and get the insurance companies to come in and write them very competitive policies. That tends to shut the little employers out and make them less competitive than the bigger employers because they can't go out and get those sorts of compensation coverages from the private industry.\n\nThe other is that that model is presently in crisis down in the United States. There have been bankruptcies of several large --\n\nMr Mahoney: Excuse me. Which model?\n\nMr King: The private market model of insuring through the private sector, through competitive insurance company bids.\n\nThere are several very large insurance underwriters in the workers' compensation field that have declared bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in the United States because they simply haven't been able to adapt to the squeeze of the increased cost spiral versus the demands for competitiveness.\n\nThose two cautions I give to you on the privatization model. I would urge people to look very closely at where it presently exists before they jump to the conclusion. You make a strong argument, and I don't necessarily reject it out of hand, by the way. Mr Di Santo --\n\nMr Mahoney: Could I just clarify before Mr Di Santo? I'm not talking about total privatization. I'm talking about you guys staying in business, but you would be a government agency competing in the private sector.\n\nMr King: I didn't want to take up too much time, but that is the model in about a quarter of the US states. What happens is that the state ends up having to insure all of the bad risks that the private industry won't come in and cover.\n\nMr Mahoney: It becomes like the Facility Association under auto insurance.\n\nMr King: Every house that has oily rags in the basement ends up being insured by the government. Their premium ends up being incredibly high because of the bad risk. Unless there is some very sophisticated pooling arrangement requiring the private sector to come in and take part of that bad risk, that model is very shaky.\n\nMr Mahoney: Do you want to add to that?\n\nMr Di Santo: No, it's okay, go ahead.\n\nMr Mahoney: The concern, of course, notwithstanding what I will accept as your good intentions in yesterday's reports by both of you, is that the message out there on the ground is very, very different from the message you give to us. The only thing that even comes close to workers' compensation is SCOE problems, support and custody, in terms of workload for a constituency assistant in a local constituency or a community office. Those two, certainly in my experience, rank one and two, and everything else pales by comparison. It depends on the issue of the day.\n\nThose would include issues where a young boy working at a summer job to get money to go to university steps off the back of a truck into a pothole and almost breaks -- it would have been better if he broke his ankle, but he simply sprains it and winds up getting one week's compensable wages from workers' compensation because he didn't dot an i or cross a t. The process of going through to an appeal is so outrageous, and in the meantime he winds up losing over $1,200 of wages because he can't work.\n\nIn that particular instance, the employer was prepared to offer to keep the individual on at 70% wage rather than go through the horrendous experience that the employer would experience in having you people come back in, now that he would file a claim. The individual injured decided: \"No, I'll get 90% through workers' comp. That's what it's there for. It's insurance. It's protection. I trust them.\" So he turns down the employer's offer, winds up losing a substantial amount of money he needed to go to university, and then the employer winds up getting reassessed because of one week's compensable wages and because it's an incident.\n\nPeople are afraid of you in the business community; they really are. They want to avoid you coming in. You're worse than income tax. They want to avoid you coming in at all costs. I would suggest that some of the statistics you gave yesterday that show that the number of claims is down, that you're seeing, I believe you said -- what was the reduction in your overall budget? I recall a figure of $400 million or something; it wouldn't be that high.\n\nMr King: Administrative?\n\nMr Mahoney: No, in claims. What was the reduction in claims?\n\nMr King: About 400,000 down to 377,000 over a one-year period.\n\nMr Mahoney: So you're seeing a reduction. If I could be, as you might expect, rather straightforward in this, you tend to claim that as some sort of administrative victory when in fact I think what's happening is a combination of the recession, the number of people going out of work, the number of people who don't have jobs any more, who would not qualify to apply for workers' compensation because they don't have an employer; and the fact that the underground economy has kicked in, in my experience, in big way.\n\nYou might not know much about a riding like the one I represent, but you could appreciate that outside the Metro area, in the GTA, there are a lot of small businesses, an awful lot of 50-and-under employers and small manufacturing concerns, assembly corporations, companies where there may indeed be some possible injuries that would occur from lifting or whatever. These people are going underground on you, Mr King; they don't want to see you. I don't know how you can claim, with due respect, the great success that I saw you and your chairman claiming here yesterday, with that fact being there, or do you dispute that?\n\nMr King: I think we were at pains to point out that even with only 13% of the workers being unhappy with the Workers' Compensation Board --\n\nMr Mahoney: They must all be in my office.\n\nMr King: -- versus 17% two years ago, 13% of 400,000 workers is a large number of workers. Similarly, the corresponding figure for employers was that 30% were very unhappy with us two years ago; 19% are very unhappy. I don't think we were claiming victory; we were claiming improvement, but it still leaves a long way to go.\n\n1120\n\nMr Mahoney: The statement, I believe, was made by Ms Carter about the adjudicators that -- I don't want to put words in her mouth, but I think what she said is that she hears from her constituency that people feel that adjudicators have forgotten that their main role is to service injured workers. Is that a fair analysis of what you said? Certainly that's not a partisan problem; that's a problem every MPP faces.\n\nYou talk in here of the four major strategic goals of workers' compensation: service excellence, financial soundness, public understanding and responsible administration.\n\nService excellence: You can quote me statistics and percentages all day long. Workers' compensation didn't go to hell in a hand basket in the last two years; I acknowledge that. You've gone to some lengths to stress that this is not, in your view, a partisan issue. There may be a lot of partisan issues within the overall issue, but by and large, in terms of service excellence, I would have to say that in my experience, if there were a government agency that provided less in terms of service excellence, I would be hard pressed to find one. As I said, SCOE is running right up your back, pretty close, but even there it has ways of getting garnishees and things of that nature; through the legislation that's been introduced, there are ways of getting that particular problem solved that seem to be working, albeit with certain frustrations.\n\nYour number one issue here is service excellence. Do you really believe that workers' compensation is delivering that kind of excellence? If not, what can you do, either a major change -- I sort of hear the chairman suggesting, and I won't put words in your mouth on this, that some form of universal program might solve the problem, in your view. What is it, if there is not service excellence, that you have to do to deliver it?\n\nMr Di Santo: I want to say that those are two totally unrelated issues. The system you choose has nothing to do with the way you do service. Whether it's universal or this type of insurance that we have now, you can give good or bad service.\n\nWhat we have told the committee, and I want to repeat it, is that we are not claiming we are giving perfect service, because we are not. What I tried to say yesterday and want to repeat now is that when we came to the board, we had a situation that was chaotic. You have to read what every member of every party said at the standing committee in 1991. From then on, we have tried to sort out the mess, and we have told you exactly what we have been doing. In terms of reorganizing our service, we had a problem with the decision review branch.\n\nNow, if we make generalizations -- you can say, \"People fear you.\" We can say the same thing about politicians, about priests, about journalists. I can say people don't like politicians. Does that mean anything? It doesn't help at all. What I'm saying is that between 1989 and 1992 the appeals tripled, and we have been able to solve that problem. Is that service excellence? Now when somebody makes an appeal at decision review, in six weeks we are able to give a decision. Is that acceptable or not? I think that should be the parameter: Is that acceptable or not?\n\nWe told you that when we came we had a situation where the adjudicators could not make decisions, for many reasons. One was because of Bill 162. You have to remember that it's not all the fault of \"those guys,\" us, who are not liked, because we are dealing with three acts: the pre-1985 act, Bill 101 and Bill 162. If you have to make a decision, you have to be knowledgeable in the three acts, so it's a very complex operation.\n\nWe have been training our staff, we have been rationalizing the service and we have recentralized the decision review branch. I think we are doing, objectively, a better job in rehabilitation, and it's very difficult to do rehabilitation.\n\nWhen I came, I went to Sudbury. There were case workers who had 120 cases and they had to travel eight hours a day, and you blame them? Of course, it's easy: If I'm not served, it's easy to say I wasn't served properly. But look at the circumstances under which we were operating, and despite that -- we are not claiming victory, but I think it's fair to say that the board of directors decided we would have a flat budget and we have been operating with a flat budget. That's probably not excellence, but I think it's a good result, because we have the plan, the board of directors told us this is the plan, and we respected the plan.\n\nI think we are making inroads. We are not saying we are perfect, but we are moving towards a situation that is acceptable. There are injured workers who are dissatisfied, but there are workers like John, whom I mentioned yesterday, who thanks us because he is a double amputee and now he can operate.\n\nMr Mahoney: I would certainly hope that out of the tens of thousands of injured workers you deal with, you'd be able to find a John here or there, or a few of them that would be satisfied.\n\nMr Di Santo: Well --\n\nMr Mahoney: Maybe the problem is that the MPPs only hear from the ones who aren't. We don't often get a call from John to tell us how happy he is with workers' compensation, and I acknowledge that. But to say, as you said, that people don't like politicians, the first thing a politician had better do is recognize that that's the truth --\n\nMr Di Santo: You can say that about everybody.\n\nMr Mahoney: -- and let's accept that as the truth. I suggest to you that when people say they're not happy with workers' compensation service delivery, you should accept that as the truth, in the same way that I accept that people aren't fond of my profession even though they like me.\n\nMr Di Santo: In fact, we have been operating under that assumption, recognizing the shortcomings. Exactly.\n\nMrs Witmer: Unfortunately, I would have to concur with some of the remarks that have just been made by the opposition critic. In speaking to my constituency office today and certainly in speaking to many of my colleagues, I know that much of our time is devoted, on a daily basis, to dealing with WCB problems. In fact, I really question whether or not an MPP should be devoting that much time to that particular issue. In my case, my staff tell me it's at least one third, and sometimes it becomes one half. The only thing that's keeping the percentage down right now is the number of people calling us concerning welfare.\n\nMr Bradley: And SCOE.\n\nMrs Witmer: And SCOE, but at the present time, they tell me that welfare is the big issue in my community of Kitchener-Waterloo.\n\nThe two problems they face, as far as the WCB is concerned, are, first, the lack of appropriate and timely communication. Even my staff are becoming frustrated when they call the adjudicator on behalf of the injured worker and can't get through or are told by an answering machine, \"We will respond to you within 24 hours,\" and they're not responding. In fact, I heard of a case this morning where my staff made the call on September 7, today is the 14th, and there's still no response.\n\nThat's the type of frustration that injured workers face and that's the reason they call our offices, because they can't get through on the telephone lines. Nobody's telling them what's happening and they feel so terribly frustrated. You have to realize that by the time they call us, they really are at their wits' end.\n\nThen we have other people whose claims have been inappropriately adjudicated. One case this morning that my staff was dealing with went back to 1991; they're still trying to do something with a $500 overpayment. Now the employee's been injured again, and on the first cheque the individual received they took the $500 off, which should never have come off. Nobody can get an answer; it is very frustrating. The human resource people at the plant get involved; they can't get an answer and they call us.\n\nThere's a problem there and it's a very serious problem. Today, for the first time -- I didn't initiate this WCB discussion with my staff, because I leave it up to them; they're competent. Today they said to me: \"You know, Mrs Witmer, I don't know what's happening, but we can't even get through any more on the phone line. We can't even get answers from the adjudicators.\"\n\nSo one problem is lack of communication. People just don't know what's going on, nobody's telling them and nobody's getting back to them within the time they promise on the phone message. If you're not going to get back, don't leave that; don't make the promise. You and I know that people are upset and they want an answer.\n\n1130\n\nThe other problem is the time involved in the adjudication and resolving the claim issue, and also in the appeal process, where people are waiting one to two years. It is very frustrating. I don't know if you really have any idea of what our staff go through, but I sometimes wonder why I would want to be a constituency assistant. I'll tell you, because of the frustration in the area of workers' compensation and now welfare and SCOE, they do get dumped on. They are fine people, but they go home at night and they feel pretty frustrated, because they become the individual who's blamed because WCB isn't responding in a timely fashion or communicating well when they do respond to the individual.\n\nI can assure you, it's a serious problem. I can appreciate that you're doing your best; nevertheless, it's a problem that does remain very serious. I would like my staff to get on to another issue, because I don't think they should be devoting that much time to this particular issue.\n\nLast week I met with an employer representative group, and most of them were personnel managers. I met with them to discuss employment equity, but by the end of the afternoon's discussion, when I said to them, \"Tell me, what are some of the issues that confront you that I need to know about,\" do you know what? Every one of the 10 individuals said to me, \"The biggest problem we have is workers' compensation.\" It's very frustrating.\n\nSo to both the employer and employee community alike, I know you're doing what you can, but there obviously is much more that needs to be done. These individuals are feeling extremely frustrated, and again it gets back to the communication, the message not going out in a timely fashion, or the type of message that's being communicated, which oftentimes turns out to be erroneous and as a result creates complications. I say that to you in honesty. That's certainly the view that I have from Kitchener-Waterloo.\n\nMr Di Santo: I'll let Brian reply to you, but I want to make just a brief comment. I want to say that I know the frustration you and your staff go through. When I was an MPP, I had a very large case load.\n\nIf we came to you and said, \"We will fix the system immediately,\" we would not be truthful, because the system is too complex. There is too much litigation; too many cases are appealed. As long as we have this system, we are going to have administration problems, adjudication problems. But nobody intentionally tries to delay dealing with a claim, or no adjudicator deliberately tries to stop your staff and say, \"I will not deal with Ms Witmer's staff.\" It's not deliberate. It's the circumstances. As I said before, when you have a very high volume of files to deal with, then you don't have time probably to do what you'd like to do. I'm not saying that's justifiable, but that's the system.\n\nMrs Witmer: That is the system. I just want to make one other point, because this point has been made by my staff and other people's staff. They really do sense that the individuals they're talking to feel very overworked and spend a lot of time telling the MPPs' staff how busy they are. That's fine, we're all busy, but that's not something they need to be communicating. Obviously, you spend so much time worrying about how busy you are that you're not getting your job done.\n\nDo you not agree, Mr Di Santo, given the fact that the system isn't responding to the needs of the employer or the employee community, that there is a need at this time for a royal commission to take a look at how we can restructure? It needs to be from the bottom up, the top down. We need to do something, because we're not responding to the needs that are out there.\n\nMr Di Santo: I don't know if you were here when I said that we are dealing with three different acts, pre-1985, Bill 101 and Bill 162.\n\nMrs Witmer: Yes, I was here.\n\nMr Di Santo: If you were an adjudicator and you had to deal with three different acts perhaps with the same person, it would be a very difficult job.\n\nI agree with you. It's not a system that can continue based on the present premises. There are a number of people who are there to represent injured workers and employers, because the system is too complex. Ideally, any injured worker should be able to go in front of the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal and make his case or her case, because it's his or her life, but no worker can appear before WCAT and understand the intricacies of the legal system. It's a very complex system.\n\nWhat we can do -- there are two levels here. One level is the administration, and we have been telling you what we are honestly trying to do, with our staff, with streamlining the procedures. One of the big problems at the board, I want to tell you quite frankly, was the letter-writing. I was the chairman of the board, and sometimes I had difficulty reading the letters of some of my neighbours who came to me asking, \"What does this mean?\" It was not done intentionally to mislead, but the people who were preparing those form letters were trying to put in every possible piece of information, and it resulted in a jargon that was not understandable. One of the action groups has been doing exactly that, to redo all the letters in plain English. We are trying to do whatever is possible at our level.\n\nThere is another level, and that's what you're talking about. How do you simplify the system? You know very well that there is a Premier's Council on which there are people who have very serious responsibility, like the chairman of --\n\nMrs Witmer: I know all the players; I have all the information.\n\nMr Di Santo: Exactly. Those people, the chairman of Stelco, of Canada Trust, of Digital Equipment, of General Motors of Canada, have at heart the destiny of the system, because it affects their operations fundamentally.\n\nMr Mahoney: Is that the one Sid Ryan's on?\n\nMr Di Santo: What I'm saying is that they are dealing now with this issue: Is this system workable, or should we look beyond this? I want to tell you, if you have no consensus out there in our society between workers and employers, the system does not work.\n\nAnecdotally, you can bring your case of your constituency office. I can tell you that last Friday at the Sheraton Hotel, 70 employers were at the seminar with our modified work program. They were enthusiastic. Does that mean we are great?\n\nMrs Witmer: Do you feel that a royal commission on the WCB is necessary at this time if we're going to resolve the systemic problems that the short-term reforms simply can't deal with?\n\nMr Bradley: But Gerald Caplan is busy now.\n\nMrs Witmer: Well, there are no political appointments any more.\n\nMr Mahoney: Audrey will be available shortly.\n\nMr Di Santo: There are and there will be all kinds of people, including past, present and future politicians, I suppose. But I think personally -- and this is my personal opinion; it is not shared by everyone yet -- that the system needs to be revisited, because we have to decide primarily what we want to do. Do we want a system like the one you mentioned, privatized? Do you want a system like Mr Mahoney mentioned based on a competitive basis?\n\nMrs Witmer: Those are the alternatives we need to look at.\n\nMr Di Santo: Those are options you have to look at. Do you want a universal system, the one that I prefer, for instance?\n\nMrs Witmer: I don't think anybody wants a universal system, except I hear you say that.\n\nMr Di Santo: Except me. Not everyone appreciates it.\n\nMrs Witmer: I'll tell you, that's not the way you're going to resolve the economic difficulties at the WCB; that's not the solution.\n\n1140\n\nMr Di Santo: What I'm trying to say is that there are different options, and some of them are compatible and some are not. Those options have to be revisited, but fundamentally, I think we have to resolve the most crucial problem, the problem that this is a system --\n\nMrs Witmer: Can you just answer my question? You went all through this yesterday when I asked you the question about the unfunded liability. Do you think we need a royal commission on the WCB?\n\nMr Di Santo: I think I said yes, because we have to revisit all those issues.\n\nMrs Witmer: Okay, that's all I ask.\n\nMr Di Santo: Brian, would you like to --\n\nMr Mahoney: Does Brian agree?\n\nMr King: Being the non-political member of this group, I defer answering that question to my colleague Mr Di Santo. I'll respond to the service excellence question.\n\nI couldn't agree with you more that the WCB of Ontario should be providing service excellence. It is not providing service excellence. It is showing improvement in what it has been doing.\n\nI would ask people to understand that we're trying to change a culture that is 80 years old, which is insular to some extent, which didn't focus on the customer or the client; rather, it focused on the noise that may be surrounding the program. We are seeking the advice of such experienced private sector groups as the Xerox corporation, which has done better than anyone, I think, in Canada to turn things around from a service excellence point of view. I think we will be able to move the culture towards one of serving the customer or client, to service excellence. We are not there yet; one would not pretend we're there yet.\n\nThe thing I would ask everyone to keep in mind is to differentiate between service excellence, which is timeliness and correctness of decisions, versus the adversarial program, where people may want more than the system may allow them under law or if we differ in opinion on what fact gives us. That is a difficulty, because often people can't make that distinction with the limited information you have available to you. If someone comes in and says, \"They owe me more money,\" that doesn't necessarily mean a service excellence problem; that may mean a legitimate difference of opinion on rights that exist under law.\n\nMrs Witmer: I'd like to pursue an area that we touched on yesterday. You had suggested that it was time that the large and prosperous sectors of Ontario's economy be placed within the confines of the WCB system; you expressed a concern that 40% of the workforce wasn't covered by the WCB, and of course that includes the very wealthy financial sector. Then you're suggesting a flat-rate payment system. What exactly do you mean by that? I just want some clarification.\n\nMr King: Right now, the workers' compensation assessment or tax on employers is apt to fall under one of about 200-plus categories. If you're in a very high-risk industry -- let me take cutting down trees as an example, where you might be using chainsaws -- you may be paying a rate that is 15% of your payroll for workers' compensation protection. If you manage an office of white-collar workers, you may be paying one quarter of 1% or 25 cents per $100. So there's an incredible difference between the rates that employers pay for workers' compensation protection.\n\nI think it worth the while of thoughtful people to reflect on how Ontario's prosperity comes. Ontario's prosperity doesn't come from my insurance agent coming to sell me insurance; Ontario's prosperity comes when it manufactures goods for export abroad, when it exports its natural resources. What we're doing under our present assessing arrangement is that we're charging the manufacturers, who have to compete and sell things abroad, the highest premiums, or we're charging those who extract resources the highest premiums, amd then they have to go out and compete on the international market.\n\nIt may be that Ontario should think about whether all business isn't one entity in this province, and that if the manufacturer of widgets is not being supported or is being held back by its compensation rate, maybe you should have one flat rate where you have cross-subsidization between all industry to support those that create the wealth in Ontario.\n\nMrs Witmer: I guess that's part of the NDP ideology and philosophy. As you and I both know, the employer community in this province really is very supportive of the system that is presently in place; it has certainly helped to promote a fairer distribution of the assessment burden. Without this type of rating system, I think employer equity would be compromised. It also has provided a very powerful incentive for firms to take charge of their workers' compensation performance by reducing injuries and encouraging employees to return to work. That just would not be there if we were to have one flat rate for everybody. Where would the incentive be?\n\nMr King: There are incentives that you could build into a flat-rate system in terms of accident prevention. You could also bring in some equity considerations through some sort of experience-rating program of rewards and penalties.\n\nThe problem with the present model is that as the price goes up on some of those manufacturing industries, they don't lobby to prevent injuries as much as they lobby to get us to reduce the benefits available to the workers; right now the employer lobby is to reduce benefits from 90% down to 80% of income.\n\nI assure you that the US states, especially in the sunbelt states, are reducing the benefits available under workers' compensation very considerably, and the pressure is now on Canada to harmonize under the free trade agreement to bring ourselves down to the level of those southern states.\n\nI just ask people to be very thoughtful about this before you come up with positions or declare them ideological. I think this is a question of Canada's competitive position vis-à-vis a very difficult North American market today.\n\nMr Mahoney: You're already shopping in the States. You might as well adopt their rate system.\n\nThe Chair: Obviously, it is the turn of the government members next, but we do have a little business to get back to from yesterday, which was the wish of the committee in terms of the balance of the week. Yesterday, we said we would revisit that subject this morning, whether or not to do the tour and, if we were to do a tour, when to do it. I'm waiting for the direction of the committee about that subject.\n\nMr Mahoney: First of all, I think the original suggestion was to do the tour on a Thursday. I've said I'm not available that day to do it, and I believe there are others who are not available Wednesday.\n\nWith regard to the necessity or the advisability of taking the time out to do the tour, I think it might be nice, but I don't know that it would be terribly useful. While we have Mr King and Mr Di Santo available to committee, I would rather have the opportunity of continuing along the lines of what we've been doing. I think there are a number of areas that have been identified that require explanation, questions and delving into these issues. Frankly, a tour of a facility that they're moving out of anyway -- unless they're telling us that they've decided to cancel the building and they're going to stay where they are, but I don't think that's on the agenda -- it would seem to me, would not be terribly productive.\n\nIf there are issues that either gentleman or other staff with workers' comp who are here want to present to us in relationship to the administration, then I think that would be very appropriate. But to take the time of the committee to go physically to the office that they're closing is not something I would support.\n\nMrs Witmer: I'm neutral at this point; whatever the majority decides.\n\nMr Marchese: I personally find repetition not very productive, but we do it anyway. But to the point that the plan is to move to another building, therefore rendering the visit useless, I would say that visiting the site is important because it gives you a sense of how the whole administration of claims works, and I think that would be very productive for all the members to see. Not that we shouldn't see the site because they might be moving or are moving, but rather, as you see it in this present site you may see it as it would be in the other site, and you can visit again.\n\nI find that very productive. I feel the time we're allocating to the various questions the members have is more than adequate, and if we avoided repetition it would be more than fully adequate. Those members who can come Wednesday should come, and we should go ahead with that tour.\n\n1150\n\nMr Bradley: I don't think a tour is necessary. This is an old game that governments play when you've got somebody in the hot seat: When you want to get them off the hot seat, you go on a tour of the facility. This has happened in estimates in years gone by, and it's just a government ruse to get the attention and the heat off those who are before the committee.\n\nI don't think it would be productive. If I want to do a tour to the WCB building I will do a tour on my own time, not on committee time.\n\nMr Ted Arnott (Wellington): I've been to the existing building where they presently conduct their administration, and I daresay most of the government members have likely been there already; in three years' time as members they've probably physically visited the building. I would expect that most of the members who may be here substituting or whatever will also actually have experienced that particular building, and it's probably unnecessary to conduct an additional tour.\n\nMs Murdock: This is the third standing committee that I have been on where we have reviewed the Workers' Compensation Board. It's becoming extremely redundant, however, and in all of the three committees not once have any of the committees gone to look at the premises or to see how the process works, where it moves, or how a claim moves through the process.\n\nI must state for the record that I take exception to the comments by Mr Bradley in imputing motives to us, in the sense that Mr Di Santo and Mr King have made themselves available for this entire week, as has their entire executive. In fact, the administration is not at work, they're here in this committee, so they aren't over there on the job. Lord knows how much that's costing the taxpayer. They have never refused to come to any committee and they have been here. I am speaking in their defence because I know they won't say anything, but it is wrong for it to be left on the record unsaid.\n\nI think we should be going over to the board office and seeing how the process works or doesn't work, as the case may be.\n\nMr Arnott: Which of the government members have not been to that building?\n\nMr Marchese: Do you mean actually been into the building, as opposed to having a tour of the building? Is that the distinction you want to make?\n\nMr Arnott: Who have been in the building to see how the administration is done. I'm very surprised.\n\nThe Chair: Yesterday we passed a motion as to the schedule for the whole week, with the exception of this subject being unresolved, so we need a motion to make the decision on the question of the balance of the week's schedule, which is the tour for Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMr Daniel Waters (Muskoka-Georgian Bay): I move that we do the tour Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe Chair: Any discussion on that motion?\n\nMr Mahoney: I don't know if this is an amendment or if it's contrary, but could I ask that if you're going to do the tour, you do it Thursday?\n\nMr Waters: Fine.\n\nThe Chair: So the motion is to do a tour of the building on Thursday afternoon. Any discussion on that motion? Oh, just a second. If that motion carries, would you like to move Thursday's subject on the agenda, which was the discussion of the new building, up to Wednesday afternoon?\n\nMr Marchese: It won't be a problem for us.\n\nThe Chair: All right. The motion is to tour the WCB at 2 Bloor Street on Thursday afternoon. All in favour? Is Mr Winninger subbed in?\n\nMs Murdock: Yes, he is.\n\nThe Chair: How are you voting?\n\nMr Bradley: I hope against.\n\nMr David Winninger (London South): I'll exercise my independent vote.\n\nThe Chair: Opposed to that motion?\n\nMr Mahoney: He didn't vote at all.\n\nThe Chair: Well, Ms Witmer hasn't voted either.\n\nMrs Witmer: As I say, I'm ambivalent on this.\n\nThe Chair: But if you sit in the chair you have to vote.\n\nMr Marchese: There's no ambivalent vote to this.\n\nThe Chair: And Mr Winninger, you have to vote.\n\nMr Winninger: I'm voting with the government.\n\nInterjection: Surprise.\n\nMr Marchese: Bloc voting on the other side: Is that a surprise?\n\nThe Chair: So the motion is carried and we will tour the WCB facility on Thursday afternoon. We will adjourn now until 2 o'clock this afternoon, at which time we will start with the government members.\n\nThe committee recessed from 1156 to 1407.\n\nThe Chair: In rotation, we were with the government members.\n\nMs Murdock: Before I get into the afternoon's scheduled framework, I would like to just comment on a couple of things that were talked about this morning and ask a question.\n\nI want to thank you, first of all. I know you're here for the whole week and you're helping us instead of being at the board office, so it's appreciated.\n\nAs a former constituency assistant -- I know that Mr Arnott and I are the only two members of the Legislative Assembly --\n\nInterjection.\n\nMs Murdock: You were a constituency assistant as well? Three of us, then.\n\nIn the four years that I was a CA I worked for Elie Martel and, as many at the WCB will know, that was one of his pet projects. Over 60% of our case load was on workers' compensation, and I would say that at any given time I had anywhere from 150 to 175 active cases, amd of those, 15% to 20% at least were into the appeal process, so we were constantly active in that.\n\nThen when Shelley got elected, I continued in that office and maintained approximately the same kinds of averages. I had claims adjudication, decision review, hearings officer and WCATs, which our office did, and I represented the injured worker at those.\n\nI am now the member for Sudbury, and have been for three years. I admittedly started a brand-new office and had no carryover from the previous member but expected that, like Sudbury East riding and Nickel Belt riding, I would have a high incidence of workers' compensation cases. Initially, we did have. To your credit, with a lot of conversation in between and so on, I actually have only about 22 active cases in my office.\n\nAdmittedly, as parliamentary assistant to Labour, I am not allowed to carry hearings and WCATs, so I only go up to the decision review branch level; I can't go beyond that. I don't know what my load would be if I had that, but still and all, my staff started telling me we didn't have all that many WCB problems that weren't resolved very quickly; the 22 are ongoing, but there are a number of others I get that are resolved very quickly. I have found in my office that it has improved, so I wanted you to know that.\n\nI would also like to say that in terms of your action plan and the things you have done in relation to the regional offices -- I'm concerned about the province, of course, but we're really concerned about the dealings we have to go with on a daily basis. You have worked very hard, from my understanding of what I'm hearing locally, talking to the staff and so on, but I'm now hearing that it's sliding back. I'm wondering what kinds of ongoing procedures you have in maintaining the dialogue with your front-line workers. If you could talk to me about that, I'd appreciate it. I don't know who would answer that.\n\nMr Di Santo: I think in my introductory remarks, I made the point that we have to look at what level of service is acceptable, given the resources available to us and given also the complexity of the system, which as I said this morning has to do with different pieces of legislation and also with some problems that have been lingering for quite a long time.\n\nFor instance, Brian mentioned yesterday the problems we had with payments. When the workers' benefits system was set up, it was set up to issue payments as fast as possible but without control. Now we have been directed by the board of directors to review all the claims, more than 400,000, and that takes an incredible amount of money.\n\nI don't sense that we are falling back into a situation where service is deteriorating --\n\nMs Murdock: Excuse me. I wasn't saying that service was deteriorating. I was talking about the dialogue of the front-line workers in how things could be changed.\n\nMr Di Santo: I'll come to the point. It's not because we are not vigilant or because we have interrupted the approach that I described yesterday with our staff, because we are very serious about that. You will hear the staff themselves talk to you. In fact, we brought with us Rumina DiValentin, on my right, and Nigel Hunte, two staff members who participated in the process of the action plan. They will tell you what type of participation they had and also how we will make that approach a permanent feature within the board.\n\nWe just recently had a social contract like any other public agency. As I said yesterday, we have unionized staff and non-unionized staff, so while we were dealing with the union on one side, we had to deal with this métier of employees who are not unionized and belong to different groups within the board. I think as an institution we have been very successful in involving them all. Brian mentioned to you how many of them voted on our proposals. We incorporated most of the proposals that were agreed upon consensually with the non-unionized staff.\n\nWe intend to keep that dialogue, because I think that is essential. We have been insisting since the beginning that we don't believe in a pyramidal type of organization where the decisions come from the top. We want input from the staff. We will be comparing that in every possible expression of the work we do. Whether that is policy, whether it's adjudication, whether it's implementation of policy, we will be asking the staff to participate.\n\nMs Murdock: Are Nigel and Rumina from the Toronto office?\n\nMr Di Santo: Yes.\n\nMs Murdock: My concern is, how are the regional offices brought into this program of dialogue?\n\nMr Di Santo: When the 16 teams were appointed by the union, they were chosen throughout the province, so you have cases like Sudbury where there was a very high number of participants in the teams.\n\nMs Murdock: There would be. The morale level there was very negative when you got appointed, so they were quite hopeful of change.\n\nMr Di Santo: Very negative, but I think it would be a very positive experience for you if you went to the office now and spoke to our staff; you would find a different situation. Rumina, for instance, is from the Hamilton office. We covered all the regional offices. If you want, your question can probably be answered by them. We can invite them to tell you what their experience has been with the action plan and what that means, not only for them but for the rest of our staff.\n\nMs Rumina DiValentin: Right now I'm the vocational rehabilitation agency analyst, and at the present time I am working out of our head office in Toronto.\n\nIf I could just answer your point about the open dialogue, a really good example I could state to you is the action plan; you brought that up earlier. The action plan presented an opportunity for all the staff of the whole board to get involved in open dialogue. It allowed the opportunity for front-line staff, for all levels of management, to get involved in the process of what we should be doing. We had recommendations that came out of the chair's task force report, and I think it was the opportunity for the staff to say, how should we do it, and what should we be doing?\n\nThere were 16 action plan teams. Staff were represented from all area offices, regional offices. At the present time, one of the recommendations, the case management model, is on the verge of being implemented in the Hamilton regional office. I think that's a really good example of bringing staff in from other areas and getting them involved in having a say in how future business is to be done at the board.\n\nMs Murdock: Is this being maintained? Are you still on a committee?\n\nMs DiValentin: No. I was on project number 1, and our mandate was to establish the mandate for and hire a chief vocational rehabilitation officer. That has since been completed, as of August 16. My team consisted of eight team members from all different levels of vocational rehabilitation at the board. It's with that team that we set out to look for this leader, who would then provide us with a vision for future voc rehab at WCB.\n\nMs Murdock: Is your experience the same, Nigel?\n\nMr Nigel Hunte: I'm a claims adjudicator from Toronto East integrated services unit at head office.\n\nI have to take a step back. I started working at the board in 1989. In 1989, the staff had no say as to how business was going to be run throughout the WCB. In 1991, Brian and Odoardo came to the board and they set out to get staff more involved in regard to what the board's vision in the future was going to be and how the staff was going to be involved.\n\nIn January, I was appointed the coordinator of action plan project number 5, which was to promote cooperative return to work with the office of the employer adviser throughout the re-employment program. We had staff from regional offices, staff from all levels of client services throughout the board in to human resources, in to vocational rehab, and we set out to meet with the office of the employer adviser but also to meet with our employer groups, the medical associations, the workers' associations and try to develop a program that would assist them in returning injured workers back to work. We've come up with something that they've all said they're interested in.\n\nThe action plan process allowed the staff, who have the knowledge of how the business is actually done, to go out with management's backing and develop this kind of consensus among our stakeholders. That is a continuing process; it hasn't stopped. My project was supposed to be over in May; my project is continuing because of the type of involvement the staff have had with the outside stakeholders and the type of influence the staff can have in regard to developing something that can work for the agency.\n\n1420\n\nMs Murdock: I would tend to agree that everybody was gung-ho on getting the changes, particularly after the task force recommendations. Too often we see that things are done as an impetus from that and then, once you think you've at least partially achieved it, everything stops and it doesn't continue. That's what my fear is. I think it should be continuing.\n\nMr Hunte: That hasn't happened. It has been continuing. There are programs or project teams that have stopped because they've come to their conclusion.
