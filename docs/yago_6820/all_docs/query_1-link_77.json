        "text": "Toronto police are investigating a fatal daytime shooting near Downsview Park on Thursday.\n\nPolice were called to the area of Camborne Avenue and Dalraith Road, south of Keele Street and Sheppard Avenue around 2 p.m.\n\nA man in his 20s was found unconscious in his car when emergency crews arrived, suffering from gunshot wounds to the upper body. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nArea councillor Maria Augimeri and neighbours tell CityNews the victim is 26-year-old Roy Zamora, a Ryerson student who had just celebrated his birthday a week ago.\n\n“Freaked out. Really freaked out,” said neighbour Carla Gauthier, who was one of several people who tended to the victim in the moments after the shooting.\n\n“I heard bang, bang, bang, bang. But of course, nothing ever happens here, everybody’s a senior. And then my husband ran in from the back and said ‘call the police those were gunshots.'”\n\nHomicide investigators are combing through surveillance video from the neighbourhood in an attempt to piece together what led up to the shooting.\n\n“This is a shooting that happened in a residential area at 2 p.m. in the afternoon, I’m sure it’s not something anyone in this area would have expected,” said Det. Amanda Thornton. “As far as any concern (for public safety) it’s something that people need to be aware of.”\n\nPolice said initially they were searching for two male suspects who were seen fleeing the area in a grey vehicle."
