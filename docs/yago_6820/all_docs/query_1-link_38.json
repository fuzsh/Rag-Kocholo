        "text": "Article content\n\nTORONTO\n\nIt may not have been steak but it certainly wasn’t chicken feed either.\n\nWhile deputy mayor and acting mayor Norm Kelly treated himself and his wife/campaign manager Charlotte to 39 dinners at the Blackhorn Steakhouse dining room during his sixth campaign for Ward 40 councillor last year, his confreres were celebrating their victories with bottles of Veuve Clicquot champagne, swanky recognition dinners and galas galore, gifts of pens with their name on them, iPad purchases and endless dinners out with volunteers — all perhaps to use up their campaign surpluses before last year’s Dec. 31 deadline.\n\nA second review last week of several councillor expense files only served to confirm the many grey areas in the election fundraising rules and the potential for abuse of those rules. There is indeed a glaring need to reform those rules, if councillors have the will to do so.\n\nUnder the current municipal election rules, councillors are subject to a campaign spending limit based on the number of eligible voters in their wards. However, any and all fundraising-related events, activities or costs fall outside those spending limits.\n\nThis is where the potential for abuse rises, made ever more concerning, considering that all campaign donations are eligible for huge taxpayer-funded rebates of up to 75%, based on the amount given. In other words, much of the money being used on questionable parties, galas and expenses belongs to taxpayers.\n\nAndrew Rodie, owner and founder of Election Finances International, said the category described in the Municipal Elections Act as Fundraising Events and Activities is a “whole can of worms” because there is no definition provided as to what these are.\n\n“The result is that marketing (promotional) events for which expenses are subject to the limit get misrepresented as fundraising events for which expenses are not subject to the limit,” he says. “This gives the candidate the opportunity to spend more than the limit.”\n\nRodie, who oversees the audits of many Toronto councillors and unelected candidates, says after polling day, a candidate can “quickly determine” how much money they have left and how “lavish a party” they will hold.\n\n“Unfortunately there is no provision in the (Municipal Elections) Act as to how much one can spend on a victory party so it is open for abuse,” he says.\n\nRodie also notes that the act leaves it open for a candidate to buy computer equipment or a TV or even possibly a car and categorize it as an expense instead of an asset. “What happens to all the computer equipment, televisions and the car at the end of the campaign?” he asks.\n\nCurrent Deputy Mayor Denzil Minnan Wong’s expense file contained a $946.14 receipt for an iPad complete with Wi-Fi and Apple care purchased on Oct. 1 and $365.15, purchased through Amazon, for a portable PA system with an iPod dock on Nov. 8.\n\nIn addition to a $3,658.75 fundraising event at the Albany Club on June 19, Minnan-Wong threw a second volunteer appreciation soiree there on Dec. 19 costing $1,136.00.\n\nReached Friday, I asked him about the $400 dinner and drinks enjoyed by two guests on Dec. 29 at Katsura Japanese restaurant. The deputy mayor said it was “volunteer appreciation” and a “few people attended.”\n\nHe said the iPad was “used for the campaign for computer purposes” and argued that it was an “eligible campaign expense,” as was the PA system, which was used for a third volunteer appreciation event on Dec. 10 at the Bier Markt.\n\n“Under the campaign expense rules, my understanding is that they (all these expenses) are (legitimate),” he said.\n\nMichael Thompson, when asked about the bottles of Veuve Clicquot and Moet & Chandon champagne purchased for his victory parties, said those brands were the “cheapest he could find” and he “always” has champagne at his victory parties because they’re “celebrating.”\n\nThompson defended his two victory parties, a lavish one at the FanZone on election night and another for 100 a few days later at Calabrese Bakery, despite the fact that he didn’t have any stiff competition in Ward 37. He told me he ran a “structured campaign” and assumed anyone running against him could defeat him.\n\nWard 27’s Kristyn Wong-Tam didn’t respond to several requests for comment on the 300 KWT push action pens with blue ink she purchased at a cost of $250 to give to volunteers at her $1,098.24 party at the Brownstone Bistro on Nov. 29 or the 160 special birthday cupcakes with her KWT logo she had created for her campaign launch on June 19.\n\nDitto for longtime ward councillor Maria Augimeri who threw three different parties at the Montecassino Hotel and Event Venue — a $14,122 fundraiser on March 28, a $7,232 election night buffet for 200, and a $6,780 appreciation dinner and dance Dec. 12.\n\nLast December, Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti was ordered to pay back $17,500 after pleading guilty to campaign overspending and other offences during the 2010 election. Although his expenses for 2014 looked clean, I did contact him about $687 in invoices for security detail for his fundraising events last June 4 and Sept. 4.\n\nHe said the security guards were hired largely for “safety issues” because of parking problems at the event venue. When pressed further, he didn’t deny that the security was hired for protection from unwanted attendees.\n\nCouncillor Jaye Robinson, who was re-elected in Ward 25, defended the $5,061 in recognition and gifts charged against the $54,699.53 in donations she raised, noting she spent the money on a Dec. 19 thank-you event for volunteers at Lawrence Park church catered by Daniel & Daniel, flowers from Costco and a teal star tchotchke giveaway, a “nice momento” that could be put on someone’s mantel.\n\n“I checked every single thing I did with the elections office … I’m very anal about that,” she said. “I try to be careful with the money that is raised.”\n\nAs revealed in a Toronto Sun exclusive last Monday, Kelly — while fighting virtually uncontested for re-election — raised a whopping $145,955.60 for his campaign coffers, likely most of it from a $47,652 fundraising soiree he threw for 350 admirers at Casa Loma last May 14.\n\nHe took at least $10,632.83 of that and used it for “other fundraising costs” which appeared to include his 39 dinners (averaging $100 a pop) with Charlotte, as well as a long list of meals at Yeuh Ting, Hooters, Sabatinos, Spoon and Fork Plus, Jack Astor’s, Lin Garden and groceries from Costco and other supermarkets. He and Charlotte also threw a $13,971 thank-you dinner for 65 on Nov. 1 at the Blackhorn Steakhouse.\n\nKelly, who ducked questions about his expenses all week, did not respond to further requests for comment Friday.\n\nCREATIVE CAMPAIGN EXPENSES--THE SEQUEL\n\nMaria Augimeri (Ward 9)\n\nSpending limit: $28,346.10\n\nContributions: $70,526.87\n\nInteresting donors: Bob Kinnear ($250), Bud Purves ($250)\n\nFundraising party (March 28): $14,122*\n\nElection night party (200): $7,232*\n\nAppreciation dinner and dance (Dec. 12): $6,780.00*\n\nSurplus: $4,264.93\n\n*All events held at Montecassino Hotel\n\nDenzil Minnan-Wong (Ward 34)\n\nSpending limit: $34,373.45\n\nDonations: $46,020.00\n\nInteresting donors: Gordon Chong ($275), Bob Deluce ($275); Lesllie Noble ($275)\n\nElection night party at Wild Wing Parkway: $1,316.24\n\nVolunteer appreciation Party at Bier Markt Dec. 10: $5,148.45\n\nI-Pad with wifi and Apple Care (purchased Oct. 1): $946.14\n\nRechargeable portable PA system with IPod dock (purchaed Nov. 8 from Amazon); $365.15\n\nAlbany club volunteer appreciation night (Dec. 19): $1,136.13\n\nDinner and drinks at Katsura (Dec. 29): $374.96\n\nSurplus: $75.79\n\nMichael Thompson (Ward 37):\n\nSpending limit: $37,494.65\n\nDonations: $68,402.25\n\nInteresting donations: Stephen Diamond ($500); Silvio De Gasperis ($500); Peter Menkes ($500)\n\nVictory party #1 at FanZone (food): $6,389.07\n\nVictory party #1 (eqpt rentals): $1,026.29\n\nVictory party #1 (Megacity Music): $700\n\nVictory party #2 Calabrese Bakery: $3,000\n\nVictory champagne: 3 bottles of Veuve Clicquot-$208.90 and two bottles of Moet&Chandon Nectar Imperial-$137.40\n\nSurplus: $12,942.14\n\nKristyn Wong-Tam (Ward 27)\n\nSpending limit: $49,142.20\n\nDonations: $61,429.00\n\nInteresting donors: Tim McCaskell ($300); Mary Lou Benotto ($250); Richard Peddie ($750)\n\n300 Kristyn Wong-Tam pens for volunteers: $250.00\n\nVolunteer party at The Brownstone Bistro and Bar (Nov. 29): $1098.24\n\nDinner for 10 at The Host (Oct. 28): $272.73\n\n160 Special birthday cupcakes with KWT logo at June 19 launch: $135.00\n\nSurplus: $1,760.95\n\nJaye Robinson (Ward 25)\n\nSpending Limit: $37,105.35\n\nDonations: $54,699.53\n\nVolunteer recognition and tchotchkes: $5,061.20\n\nSurplus: $2,746.81"
