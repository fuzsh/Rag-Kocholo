        "text": "It may be said that families dispersed for social or political reasons to different parts of the globe were like satellites or capsules of culture, who then became the main custodians of a cultural preservation: where time more or less stood still. Like other recently arrived migrants following WWII, settlers from regional Calabria immersed themselves in the familiar and clung to the traditions and customs of their homeland. They placed importance on maintaining cultural attributes because of the belief that back in their place of origin, the same thing was happening. Their new sites of settlement defined their sense of italianità1, as they maintained contact with other paesane2, Calabrians and Italians. By clinging to their culture, it was a way of preserving it. Italian Australian scholar, Gerardo Papalia stated; “immigrants themselves created their own little homeland within domestic walls. However, this homeland was fabricated with crystallised memories and inhabited with behaviour patterns deriving from what they had left.”3 Based on this premise, the aim of my arts practice-based research is to investigate the experience of Calabrian migrants from the Aspromonte region of the province of Reggio Calabria (with a focus on the towns of Platì and Natile) who left Italy in the 1950s (in some cases earlier). Through scholarly articles, books, personal interviews and my own experiences, I will explore how these migrants transported a microcosm of their culture and cultural practices particular to their region to their new home in Mildura, in Victoria’s North-West. Through the modes of narrative enquiry, autoethnography, and traditional methods of making and women's work, my multidisciplinary arts practice-based research investigates, interprets and translates the experiences of Calabrian settlers to Victoria’s North-West, in a contemporary visual art and sociological context. Notions of belief and religious practices, gender roles and stereotypes, family relationships, nostalgia, cultural loss and preservation are also explored in my work. My research also explores broadly the global experience of migration, the factors which led to the Italian migrants to Australia, cultural loss and preservation and nostalgia in second and subsequent generations. 1 Italianità: sense of Italianness or Italianism. 2 Paesane: townspeople 3 Gerardo Papalia, \"From 'terrone' to 'wog': 'post' colonial perspectives on Italian immigration into Australia.\" Italian Historical Society Journal 11, no.2 (2003): 7.\n\nThis paper proposes to examine Italian Australian narrative by first generation writers published from the mid 1980s to the present, a period that has seen both an increase in the production of texts, a tendency towards the more widespread use of English with respect to Italian and a diversification of thematic content. Apart from some very few exceptions (Rosa Cappiello, Antonio Casella), most first generation Italian Australian writers constitute a largely “invisible” presence in Australia’s literary culture with their works being largely overlooked by the mainstream literary establishment. Yet they present a discrete corpus of literary writing that focuses on making sense of the liminal space between the old country and culture and the new and the physical and metaphysical transitions involved in the process of migration. While many of the narrative works deal with the social realities of the diaspora, some also provide a constant and ever-shifting appraisal of two different worlds and two different cultures in the attempt to demythologise and remythologise past and present in the light of new experiences."
