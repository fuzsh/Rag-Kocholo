        "text": "Canadian politician\n\nMaria Augimeri ( AW-jim-AIR-ee, Italian: [maˈriːa audʒiˈmɛːri]; born c. 1954[1]) is a Canadian politician. From 1985 to 2018, she served as a local politician in Toronto, holding office as a school board trustee, and as a council member in North York, Metropolitan Toronto, and on Toronto City Council. In 2019, Augimeri stood as the New Democratic candidate for the riding of Humber River-Black Creek.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in Italy, Augimeri moved to Canada with her family at the age of 2. Before entering politics, she was a Social Anthropologist at York University. She has written three books on the Italian-Canadian community and is also a published poet.\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nShe first entered politics as a school trustee, and was elected to the city council of North York in 1985. She ran for the Ontario New Democratic Party in the 1987 provincial election in the riding of Downsview which her husband, Odoardo Di Santo, held for ten years before losing in the 1985 election. She lost to Liberal Laureano Leone by 174 votes.\n\nAugimeri was elected to the Metro Toronto council in 1988, and remained on that council until the creation of the new city of Toronto in 1997. She was elected councillor to the new city council three times. She was known for promoting environmental awareness and cultural issues.\n\nShe was endorsed for re-election by the Toronto Star newspaper in 2003.[2]\n\nThe local weekly newspaper Now Magazine also gave her an endorsement in 2000.[3]\n\nOn August 10, 2008, a massive propane explosion in Augimeri's ward destroyed a propane distribution facility which caused the evacuation of thousands of residents. Augimeri cut short a summer vacation in Italy and returned to Toronto to assist with the situation. During a press conference, she became involved in a heated discussion with Tony Di Santo, head of the local ratepayer's group. She said, \"If people have problems of a partisan nature they should not be using the death of a firefighter... So shut up!\" Later she apologized for losing her temper.[4][5][6]\n\n2010 municipal election\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2010 Toronto municipal election was held on October 25. Augimeri won by an 89-vote margin (0.7%) over local businessman Gus Cusimano. Augimeri thanked her supporters the following day on October 26, 2010, when she said, \"I know a lot of the community voted for me because they know I'm the one to protect community interests.\"[7]\n\nCusimano later announced that he would challenge the results. The matter was heard in court on March 29, 2011.[8] The judge ruled that there were enough irregularities in the 2010 voting that the election should be held again. Initially the city's legal staff said they would be appealing the decision but on May 13 it was announced that the city would not launch an appeal. City Clerk Uli Watkiss said in a statement, \"The decision to proceed with a by-election and resolve this matter as quickly as possible is in the best interest of the public, the individuals directly affected, and the workings of Council.\"[9] The mayor's office supported the decision. Rob Ford's press secretary Adrienne Batra said, \"Obviously the mayor supported (Cusimano) during the general election and once the byelection gets under way he will be fully supporting him again.\"[10]\n\nOn May 16, Augimeri announced that she would be appealing the decision herself. Augimeri told media, \"The clerk’s advice not to appeal does harm to taxpayers as well as to the integrity of our electoral system.\"[11] On August 4, the city reversed its decision and decided to join the appeal which was held in September 2011.[12] On December 19, the court ruled in Augimeri's favour. A three judge panel ruled that although 300 ballots were unsigned by electoral officers the people voting were very likely eligible to vote and that this would have no effect on the election. In a related judgement, they also ruled that Cusimano incorrectly voted in the Ward 9 election because he lived in another riding. They decided that no further action was necessary.[13]\n\nAugimeri was appointed Chair of the Toronto Transit Commission in February 2014 upon the resignation of Karen Stintz to run for Mayor of Toronto in the 2014 Toronto election winning appointment over Josh Colle, Stintz's preferred successor.[14]\n\n2014 municipal election\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2014 election, Augimeri again faced Cusimano, though defeated him by a larger margin (42.74% to 28.37%).\n\n2018 Municipal Election\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the election of Augimeri's former council colleague Doug Ford as Premier of Ontario, Ford's Progressive Conservative government passed legislation that reduced the number of seats on Toronto City Council from 47 to 25 immediately before the city's scheduled election. The legislation, referred to as the Better Local Government Act, merged wards being contested by Augimeri and another council colleague, James Pasternak. Augimeri lost to Pasternak by over 2000 votes, blaming the reduction in council seats for her loss and noting that she would have won in her old ward.[15]\n\nAugimeri served as the chairperson of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) Board of Directors until February 2019. In July 2019, Augimeri was replaced on the TRCA by a citizen appointee.\n\n2019 Federal Election\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the October 21, 2019 Federal Election, Maria Augimeri was unable to unseat the long time Liberal incumbent in the Humber River-Black Creek riding, Judy Sgro. Ms. Sgro won with 22,983 votes, Ms. Augimeri with the NDP was a distant second at 7,126.\n\nElection results\n\n[edit]\n\nFederal\n\n[edit]\n\n2019 Canadian federal election: Humber River—Black Creek Party Candidate Votes % Expenditures Liberal Judy Sgro 23,187 61.1 -5.81 $93,410.00 New Democratic Maria Augimeri 7,198 19.0 +8.06 $18,120.64 Conservative Iftikhar Choudry 6,164 16.3 -3.96 $3,300.00 Green Mike Schmitz 804 2.1 +0.47 none listed People's Ania Krosinska 402 1.1 – none listed United Stenneth Smith 114 0.3 - $0.00 Marxist–Leninist Christine Nugent 89 0.2 -0.36 $0.00 Total valid votes/expense limit 37,958 100.0 Total rejected ballots 503 Turnout 38,461 56.8 Eligible voters 67,656 Liberal hold Swing -6.94 Source: Elections Canada[16][17]\n\nProvincial\n\n[edit]\n\n1987 Ontario general election: Downsview Party Candidate Votes % Liberal Laureano Leone 11,832 46.80 +2.88 New Democratic Maria Augimeri 11,658 46.11 +3.06 Progressive Conservative Drew McCreadie 1,788 7.07 −5.94 Total valid votes 25278 100.00\n\nMunicipal\n\n[edit]\n\nResults of the October 22, 2018 Toronto - Ward 6 - York Centre Councillor Election Candidate Popular vote Expenditures Votes % ±% James Pasternak (Incumbent) 11,559 47.61% -57.78% $67,212.21 Maria Augimeri (Incumbent) 9,223 37.99% -4.75% $66,209.39 Louise Russo 2,726 11.23% - $23,323.98 Edward Zaretsky 771 3.17 - -1 Total votes 24,279 Registered voters 1 These candidates did not submit official Financial Statements and are, therefore, ineligible to run in the\n\n2022 Municipal election\n\nNote: All Toronto Municipal Elections are officially non-partisan.\n\nNote: Candidate campaign colours are based on the prominent colour used in campaign items (signs, literature, etc.)\n\nand are used as a visual differentiation between candidates.
