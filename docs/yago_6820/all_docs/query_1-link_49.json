        "text": "A fundraiser for Councillor Shelley Carroll (Don Valley East) this month will do double duty: raise money for the rookie's re-election bid this Nov. 13 and celebrate her 25th wedding anniversary (in July) to husband Sandy.\n\n\"If I had any other husband I would not,\" said Ms. Carroll, praising his \"active, loving\" support of her political career that began as a school trustee. \"At any function I would have to thank him,\" she added. \"Why not celebrate him?\"\n\nThe invitation to the May 26 event features a bride and groom on a wedding cake adorned with a \"re-elect Shelley Carroll\" sign.\n\nUnlike Mayor David Miller and his chief rival, Jane Pitfield, who both agreed to shun donations from corporations and unions, Ms. Carroll will accept them.\n\nHmm. But didn't she persuade council to exclude corporation and union donors from the city's rebate program? Ms. Carroll argues that since council failed to carry out full-scale electoral reform, she's left with no choice but to accept donations from all legitimate sources.\n\nFun with Vic and Jane\n\nMayoral candidate Jane Pitfield and lobbyist Vic Gupta maintain that there's nothing wrong with his continuing to lobby for the Toronto Port Authority in Ottawa while he gives election advice to her in Toronto.\n\nBoth point out that Mr. Gupta, although he was responsible for recruiting Ms. Pitfield's team, is working for the campaign on a voluntary basis. There, however, the stories part.\n\n\"Vic Gupta is an informal member of my campaign,\" Ms. Pitfield explained. \"He holds no position and he has never had any conversation with me about the port authority and island airport.\"\n\nThe lobbyist has a different memory, saying he \"absolutely\" discussed the politically charged issue with the candidate. \"I've informed her I represent the port authority, so she's aware of it,\" he said. \"And I've said to her in that capacity I can't give you any advice on how you should manage this issue.\"\n\nYou'd think they could at least manage to get their stories straight.\n\nWhat lobbyist registry?\n\nThe Globe reported last week that four of the five councillors on a committee overseeing the creation of a new mandatory lobbyist registry don't regularly participate in city hall's voluntary disclosure system. Few other councillors, in fact, bother to file their records.\n\nFrances Nunziata (York South-Weston) -- despite signing up for the committee -- didn't seem to understand how the current system works. Ms. Nunziata said she thought all lobbyists already registered with the clerk's office.\n\nTold this was not the case, she replied: \"You see how confusing it is? . . . There's no system.\"\n\nVote for it and forget it\n\nIt might be interesting to note who, like Ms. Nunziata, voted in favour of city council's voluntary lobbyist registry in 2003 and then failed to submit a single record to the clerk: Joe Pantalone (Trinity Spadina), Gerry Altobello (Scarborough Southwest), Brian Ashton (Scarborough Southwest), Maria Augimeri (York Centre), Frank Di Giorgio (York South-Weston), John Filion (Willowdale), Suzan Hall (Etobicoke North), Pam McConnell (Toronto Centre-Rosedale), Kyle Rae (Toronto Centre-Rosedale), and Peter Li Preti (York West).\n\nMr. Li Preti, who also sits on the committee overseeing the design of the city's new mandatory lobbyist registry, said last week he never supported the voluntary version: \"I never believed in it.\"\n\nGot a tip?
