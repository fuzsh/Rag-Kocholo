        "text": "BY: Editor\n\nToronto Public Library announced the completion of the extensive renovation of its York Woods branch. Situated in the heart of the Jane and Finch community, the newly revamped York Woods branch stands as a stunning district library, exemplifying a large, modern and multi-purpose urban public library and beautiful public infrastructure for the community.\n\nWith a commitment to creating public spaces that bring communities together, TPL has transformed the York Woods branch into an inviting space where everyone will feel welcome. Serving a population of more than 55,000, the York Woods branch plays a vital role in providing services that extend far beyond the traditional library lending model. The renovated branch is designed by Diamond Schmitt.\n\nThe renovation includes a beautiful new entrance and atrium on the main floor, expanded public space, seating and a prominent street presence.\n\nExciting new features include:\n\nYouth Hub: TPL's first dedicated Youth Hub provides a dynamic space equipped with a built-in kitchenette and adaptable furniture, offering teenagers school support from librarians, engaging programs, access to technology community resources, along with complimentary nutritious snacks.\n\nDigital Innovation Hub: Whether for learning, business or creative exploration, the newly-established Digital Innovation Hub is equipped with advanced software and a wide variety of new and emerging technologies, including a podcast recording studio and 3D printers.\n\nKidsStop Early Literary Centre: This immersive and interactive space stimulates children’s creativity and imagination, and helps to build their early literacy skills. The space includes interactive elements such as a magnetic wall with a moveable ball run, and \"Big Piano\" floor keyboard, where children can play by stepping or moving over the keys.\n\nMusical Instrument Lending Library: Library customers can borrow an impressive collection of instruments including guitars, keyboards, violins, wind chimes, a Kalimba, an 8-key African bellaphone, electric violin, and an autoharp. The Musical Instrument Lending Library is generously supported by Sun Life and the Estate of Thomas C.M. Logan.\n\n“We’re excited to welcome the community back to their library at York Woods. Beautiful and well-equipped public spaces like this one help build resilience, success and well-being for the community and its residents. We look forward to welcoming the community back, and hope everyone will take advantage of their beautiful library with its enhanced features and expanded services!”\n\n-Vickery Bowles, City Librarian, Toronto Public Library\n\nCredits to Toronto Public Library.

She is also a co-founder and Director of a social enterprise, the Downsview Advocate, a local newspaper in Toronto’s north end. In a recent interview, she expressed her passion and commitment to exploring the experiences of Black mothers with children in childcare settings.\n\nWhen asked what is her current research project and how she thinks it will help the community, she said:\n\nCurrently I am working alongside Dr. Rachel Berman on a research project that explores the experiences of Black mothers with children in childcare settings which is funded by the Faculty of Community Services at Toronto Metropolitan University. I think it might support the community by amplifying the significant and often understudied roles that Black mothers play in system navigation. It can also support the community by highlighting the recommendations and ideas that Black mothers have which can lead to more transformative spaces within and beyond childcare.\n\nI also asked her what outcomes she is hoping for through her research project.\n\nA possible outcome would be to have more opportunities where Black mothers can share their ideas, experiences, and thoughts. Rather than taking a colour-blind approach, this can lead to the centering of stories, thoughts and initiatives that help create change. It is more widely understood now that when we talk about our differences we can find our similarities. Through narratives, meaningful connections can be made. By addressing and confronting anti-Black racism from early on, communities can support challenging all forms of social exclusion. Another possible outcome would be a wider understanding of how anti-Black racism shows up in early childhood contexts but not simply left there but rather challenged through collective change.\n\nDue to her dynamic advocacy role, when asked what her future research projects focus would be and the rationale behind choosing them, she said:\n\nIn future, I would like to explore some of the past anti-racism initiatives as led by Black Elders and how these translated to policy in early childhood and care in Toronto. I hope to better understand where some of these initiatives are today and why some halted suddenly in the 1990s. I think this is important because understanding history helps provide important lessons for today and in future. As well, I would like to understand the experiences of Black Early Childhood Educators and how they support the children, families, and communities that they work with because Black ECEs often play important roles behind the scenes to not only do their job but also challenge anti-Black racism and other systemic barriers.\n\nLastly, she shared how community members can also get involved in her research project.\n\nMembers of the community can feel free to reach out to our research team to offer their insights and or to sign up to future project recruitment efforts.

With a diverse range of candidates vying for the position of mayor, it is essential for voters to be informed about the individuals running for this crucial role. Understanding their backgrounds, platforms, and visions for Toronto is vital in making an informed decision at the ballot box.\n\nVoting is not only a fundamental right but also a civic responsibility. It allows citizens to actively participate in the democratic process and have a say in the governance of their city. The outcome of the municipal election can significantly impact various aspects of everyday life, from housing affordability and transportation infrastructure to social services and environmental sustainability. By exercising their right to vote, Torontonians have the power to shape the direction and priorities of their city for years to come.\n\nThe Downsview Advocate has compiled a profile of front runners (Forum Research poll, May 29) and local candidates, be sure to read the full article and disclaimer on candidate information and visit www.toronto.ca/city-government/elections/by-election/by-election-candidate-list/ for the full list of candidates.\n\nOlivia Chow\n\nOlivia Chow is a long-standing figure in politics, having served as a Member of Parliament and a city councillor in Toronto.\n\nChow is known for her progressive stance on various issues and has a reputation for being a champion of social justice and equity, advocating for marginalized communities and addressing income inequality.\n\nOlivia’s campaign emphasizes the need for accessible and affordable housing and childcare, including increased support for tenants and transit riders.\n\nChow has highlighted the need to increase investments in public services and infrastructure, through an expansion to public transportation, more bike lanes, and the opening of libraries seven days a week.\n\nOlivia aims to fund these issues through the implementation of various taxation strategies, including a luxury homes tax and a vacant homes tax.\n\nChow is committed to securing local jobs for Toronto residents and strengthening our local democracy by not utilizing the increased “strong mayor” powers.\n\nOlivia supports the city’s vibrant cultural scene. She supports an Ontario Place that is open to the public and opposes the demolition of the Ontario Science Centre.\n\nSource: https://www.oliviachow.ca/plan\n\nBrad Bradford\n\nFormer urban planner and city councillor Brad Bradford aims to solve the issues that he has seen fail to be addressed through city hall.\n\nBradford’s campaign emphasizes increasing the speed of housing construction, combating gridlock with a congestion relief commissioner, and the hiring of 68 new police officers to enforce bail conditions.\n\nBrad is committed to ensuring maximum results from the use of tax dollars by ensuring that public services are held accountable.\n\nAs opposed to increasing taxation, Bradford will employ contractors that have non-unionized workers or those not under a city agreement with major trade unions to fill Toronto’s $1-billion budget gap.\n\nBrad is prepared to use the strong-mayor powers to advance his agenda.\n\nSource: https://www.votebradford.ca/\n\nAna Bailão\n\nFormer city councillor Ana Bailão is prepared to support Torontonians with her plans\n\nAna’s campaign aims to establish reliable and sustainable funding from the provincial and federal governments to fill the $1.5 billion budget gap.\n\nBailão is committed to ensuring the province covers maintenance costs for the Don Valley Parkway and Gardiner Expressway, despite Doug Ford’s repeated rejection.\n\nAna is committed to ensuring property taxes remain at their current levels or below the inflation rate, as she believes that the city cannot utilize taxes to solve the budget deficit.\n\nBailão’s campaign emphasizes the need for affordable housing. She aims to combat this by beginning construction on affordable housing, re-evaluating construction contracts if progress is slow, and allowing eight and 10-storey buildings on major bus routes.\n\nSource: https://anabailao.ca/\n\nMitzie Hunter\n\nHunter is a former Scarborough-Guildwood Liberal MPP and released a “Fix the Six” election platform\n\nMitzie Hunter's campaign pledges to deliver 108 new midrise buildings on city land, providing a total of 22,700 units. Among these, over 16,500 units would be purpose-built rentals, with nearly 70% offered at or below the current market rate.\n\nAll units on city land would be subject to rent controls, ensuring affordability for residents.\n\nHunter emphasizes the need to address the deterioration of citywide services, such as the TTC, to ensure their improvement and effective functioning.\n\nHunter proposes a property tax increase of six percent for 2024 and 2025, resulting in an approximate $216 increase in the average household's bill next year. However, for low- and middle-income homeowners earning less than $80,000 annually, the increase would be limited to three percent.\n\nHunter intends to establish a new Toronto Affordable Housing Corporation to make public land available for the construction of 108 new developments within six years of assuming office.\n\nHunter prioritizes youth programs and plans to invest in community partners focusing on mental health, homelessness, and addressing the underlying causes of violence.\n\nSource: https://www.mitzieformayor.ca/\n\nJosh Matlow\n\nMatlow has served as a city councillor for the Toronto-St. Paul's ward since 2010.\n\nMatlow's platform includes addressing the pressing housing and homelessness issues in Toronto by allocating $407.6 million towards reducing housing costs, providing support for homeless individuals, and developing livable neighborhoods with essential amenities such as childcare, schools, infrastructure, and parks.\n\nMatlow proposes an annual investment of $200 million to ensure that Toronto fulfills its commitment to becoming a net-zero city by 2040\n\nMatlow's plan involves reversing the TTC cuts and restoring service to pre-pandemic levels, making it more convenient for residents and their families to navigate the city.\n\nMatlow's proposal includes rebuilding the deteriorating 2.4 kilometers of the elevated highway east of Jarvis Street at ground level. This initiative aims to redirect $568 million towards addressing other urgent priorities\n\nSource: https://www.votematlow.ca/platform\n\nMark Saunders\n\nMark Saunders is the former Chief of the Toronto Police Service\n\nSaunders advocates for the removal of existing bike lanes on University Avenue, reversing the decision to make the Yonge Street bike lanes permanent, scaling back the expansion plans for the Bloor Street West bike lane, and putting a pause on other bike lane expansion projects.\n\nHe is committed to ensuring that property tax increases remain at or below the rate of inflation, providing stability for residents.\n\nAs mayor, Saunders envisions financing the construction of new parks through contributions from developers. Additionally, he aims to enhance public enjoyment by offering free WiFi in selected parks.\n\nHe proposes a significant increase in the number of TTC special constables, aiming to triple the current count to at least 200. These constables would be integrated into the Toronto Police Service, collaborating to maintain safety. Furthermore, Saunders plans to bolster security measures on the transit network by installing additional surveillance cameras.\n\nSource: https://marksaundersfortoronto.ca/\n\nAnthony Perruzza\n\nAnthony Perruzza has been a long-standing representative for the area: As a school trustee, North York City Councillor, MPP and, most recently, City Councillor for Humber River-Black Creek.\n\nAnthony is renowned for standing up for Toronto residents on a number issues, including working to get a subway line to North York, spearheading major sewer repairs in his riding, standing up for renters’ rights, and championing the Jane-Finch Community Hub and Centre for the Arts.\n\nAnthony’s campaign is centred around improving the lives of Torontonians: Freezing property taxes and TTC fares for three years, expanding after-school programs for school-age kids, and building $1,000 affordable rental homes. He will also ensure that the City serves Torontonians better by creating work crews to fix pot holes and remove snow from our streets.\n\nAnthony will fund his initiatives by getting a better deal for Toronto, so we can keep the $2.2 billion we collect for the province every year through our property taxes.\n\nAnthony has an extensive history of supporting local communities, from helping organize renters to push for upgrades for rental buildings to supporting youth job creation to championing the arts throughout the Jane and Finch area.\n\nAnthony’s campaign emphasizes the need to ensure the city is affordable for everyone, making sure families are not forced to leave the city because owning or renting is too expensive.\n\nSource: https://perruzza.ca/\n\nPlease note that the mayoral candidate profiles provided above are not an exhaustive list of all their platform promises. The information presented focuses on the front runners and known local candidates in the 2023 Toronto municipal election. Each candidate may have additional proposals and initiatives that have not been covered in this summary. There may also be local candidates not featured in this story. It is important to review each candidate's official platforms and statements for a comprehensive understanding of their campaign promises and vision for the city.\n\nBy delving into the backgrounds, policy positions, and campaign emphases of these prominent candidates, voters can gain a better understanding of their potential mayoral choices. However, it is essential to conduct further research, attend debates, and engage with the candidates directly to obtain a comprehensive view of their platforms and policy proposals.\n\nAs election day approaches, let us remember the significance of our vote and the impact it can have on shaping the future of Toronto. By taking the time to learn about the candidates and casting an informed vote, we can collectively work towards a city that reflects our values, aspirations, and the needs of all its residents.\n\nIn the races for Public and Catholic School Trustee and for City Council respectively, Christopher Mammoliti, Ida Li Preti, and Deanna Sgro, all children of established politicians, can be perceived to be seeking to leverage their last names in order to get elected. It is not unheard of for the children of politicians to try to win a seat, but three in one area at the same time is very rare. The fact that all three have some controversy around their families makes this circumstance even odder.Christopher, who is seeking election as a trustee for the TDSB, is running alongside his father, Giorgio Mammoliti. Giorgio, the current Councillor of the old Ward 7, has been no stranger to controversy during his more than two decades at City Hall. Perhaps the more serious controversy that he (as of Aug 25, 2018) is was under investigation by the OPP for his alleged role in a land deal in his Ward that would have had the Toronto Parking Authority, which is fully owned by the City of Toronto, pay $2.63 Million more than the land was actually worth to a developer. While the deal has been cancelled by Toronto City Council, the investigation is still ongoing.His son is unconnected to this issue and other matters but may face the same electoral fate as his father in the upcoming election. Currently, polls show the latter is second in the race.The race for Catholic school trustee also contains an offspring of a local politician, the daughter of former Ward 8 Councillor Peter Li Preti. Ida Li Preti has put her name on the ballot.In 2013, Peter was found by an independent auditor to have accepted $21,000 in corporate donations and to have exceeded his campaign budget limit by more than $3,000 in his failed 2010 bid to unseat Anthony Perruzza from city council. Corporate donations are banned under the Toronto Municipal Elections Act. While Peter has largely kept a low public profile since then, it is not known what, if any effect his last name will have on his daughter’s election prospects.Last names are important, and Deanna Sgro may be the best example of that. She reverted to using her mother’s name in the last Provincial election, where she was a candidate for the Liberal party and came third. Her mother is the current Member of Parliament for the area, but until last year, she went by her married Deanna Natale. In 2013, Deanna Natale, as she was then known, was “found to have engaged in professional misconduct,” by the Law Society of Ontario while she was working as VP and general counsel of Affinity Global, one of the largest debt collection agencies in Canada.Whether or not the name change is working is hard to say before the election, but the latest public poll has her fourth in the race for Council in Humber River - Black Creek. *See page 3 print edition, vol 9(5)\n\nby Amoy WynterIf you voted “Ford” in the last election you are a part of the majority in the Downsview area.Even though Doug Ford lost the election with a respectable 34 per cent support, he was favourite in Ward 7 (66 per cent support), Ward 8 (61 per cent support) and Ward 9 (62 per cent support) showing the great divide in opinions across our city. The Ford brand was apparently so strong this election that a number of candidates with the Ford name had successful campaigns including Rob Ford winning his old Council seat, Michael Ford (the outgoing Mayor’s nephew who had changed his last name from Stirpe to Ford) beating a seasoned incumbent Trustee, Tiffany Ford winning an open Trustee seat here in Downview, and Russ Ford who came very close to beating a long-time Councillor in Etobicoke.As a young adult who is deeply interested in politics, I spent a great deal of time discussing the election with my peers (mainly other young adults in the Jane-Finch area). There was a great deal of disenfranchisement for many, stating “politicians are all the same” or “my vote doesn’t matter” and showing no interest in voting. For those who expressed interest in the election, the conversation was all about the mayor. For them, the election was a referendum on his track record even though it was his brother running for the big job.I was amazed at how people would simply summarize the entire election and the candidates themselves into catch phrases like “he/she is for the little guy”, “he/she will tax us to death” or “he/she hates this/that”. For the majority of people I spoke to, they were unable to list anyone’s platform even though they claimed they were very familiar with who they were voting for."
