        "text": "For voters living in 10 Toronto wards, certain pairs of names are going to look very familiar on the ballot.\n\n- INTERACTIVE | Make My Mayor\n\nThat's because renewed cage matches are taking place in these wards, where voters will see two candidates running who also placed first and second at the polls in a prior election.\n\nIn Ward 7 York West, Giorgio Mammoliti finds himself up against Nick Di Nizio.\n\nIn 2010, Mammoliti retained his seat on council, picking up 5,338 votes from people living in the ward. Di Nizio placed second, receiving 3,601 votes.\n\nIn Ward 9 York Centre, Maria Augimeri and Gus Cusimano are battling it out once again.\n\nIn 2010, Augimeri won the ward by just 89 votes. There was a court challenge, but the incumbent councillor hung on to her seat.\n\nTo the south of these two lies Ward 12 York South-Weston, where Frank Di Giorgio and Nick Dominelli are competing for votes for the third straight election.\n\nLast time, Di Giorgio (3,636) topped Dominelli (3,214) at the polls by 422 votes.\n\nThat was a much closer contest than in 2006, when Di Giorgio (4,980) bested Dominelli (2,725) by a much wider margin.\n\nIn Ward 17 Davenport, Cesar Palacio finds himself fighting Alejandra Bravo, who ran against him in 2006 and in 2003, but not in the last election.\n\nIn 2006, Palacio (4,827) came out ahead of Bravo (4,546). It was an even tighter race than in 2003, when Palacio finished with 5,127 votes and Bravo with 4,336.\n\nFurther east in the city, John Parker is up against Jon Burnside in Ward 26 Don Valley West.\n\nBack in 2010, Parker (6,203) came out ahead of Burnside (5,788), though Mohamed Dhanani (5,627) captured a similar slice of the available votes.\n\nIn Ward 30 Toronto-Danforth, Paula Fletcher is back on the ballot alongside Liz West.\n\nIn 2010, Fletcher finished the election with 8,766 votes, just ahead of West (8,507).\n\nIn Ward 32 Beaches-East York, Mary-Margaret McMahon is now an incumbent seeking re-election.\n\nSandra Bussin, the veteran councillor she defeated in the last election, is back on the ballot in a bid to regain her seat on council.\n\nIn 2010, McMahon (15,159) trounced Bussin (5,998) at the polls by more than 9,000 votes.\n\nIn Ward 36, Gary Crawford and Robert Spencer are out hitting the streets of Scarborough Southwest.\n\nIn 2010, Crawford (4,392) finished ahead of Spencer (3,970). They faced off in an election in which the incumbent, Brian Ashton, chose not to run for re-election.\n\nIn Ward 42 Scarborough-Rouge River, Raymond Cho and Neethan Shan are both on the ballot.\n\nLast time, Cho received 10,811 votes, while Shan received 6,873.\n\nIn Ward 44 Scarborough East, Ron Moeser and Diana Hall go head-to-head for the third straight election.\n\nIn 2010, Moeser (10,185) came out ahead of Hall (9,901), but only by 284 votes.\n\nThat was a slightly more comfortable cushion that in 2006, when Moeser received 6,480 votes and Hall received 6,419."
