        "text": "Article content\n\nHalf way through Tuesday afternoon’s beheading of transit boss Gary Webster, Councillor Gord “Guard His” Perks was quoted on another media outlet as saying he couldn’t remember a time at City Hall “when any civil servant was fired for telling the truth.”\n\nThis was after the apologist for the status quo summoned anyone who wanted to “save transit” to join him in one of City Hall’s committee rooms — presiding with some of his buddies (Councillors Janet Davis, Paula Fletcher, Joe Mihevc and Pam McConnell) over a leftist handwringing session while the nine commissioners sat in private debating Chief General Manager Webster’s fate.\n\nLater, before the five commissioners finally voted to proceed with the beheading, Councillor Maria Augimeri — in her best imitation of the Shrew Before She was Tamed — dramatically urged her fellow commissioners to do some “soul-searching.”\n\nShe claimed that those who wanted to axe Webster would send a message that honest hardworking professionals “get kicked out the door” and “toadyism wins.\n\n“This (firing) is a clear demonstration of abuse of power,” La Grande Drama Queen declared. “I’ve never seen anything like this before in my 30 years (as councillor).”\n\nThankfully, the five commissioners who voted for Webster’s axing — Denzil Minnan-Wong, Norm Kelly, Vince Crisanti, Cesar Palacio and Frank DiGiorgio — were having none of this leftist theatre of the absurd.\n\nI knew Augimeri was a lost cause. But I still can’t understand why TTC Chair Karen Stintz, Vice-Chairman Peter Milczyn and Commissioner John Parker so vociferously supported a CGM who has been out of his depth for years, is downright resistant to change, failed to improve customer service, runs a secretive organization rife with nepotism and can’t seem to bring a single major project (capital, IT or whatever) within budget.\n\nEither they’ve all swallowed the TTC Kool-Aid or are just a pack of wimps.\n\nLook, I still maintain Webster should have been canned a year ago.\n\nThe Ford regime asked for the pushback by allowing the timing to get the better of them. But getting back to the brazen assertions from Perks and Augimeri, methinks the two have very selective memories indeed.\n\nIt didn’t take long to dig out the long list of six-figure bureaucrats tossed out the door without a second thought by their feckless former leader and the great abuser of power, former mayor David Miller.\n\nI know for certain La Drama Queen was here throughout and before Gord Perks became a councillor in 2006, he certainly spent enough time here as a professional eco-lobbyist.\n\nSo pray tell how could they forget?\n\nFact is, Miller pushed so many people out who dared not bend and scrape, it ended up costing taxpayers $14-million in severance payments over his seven years in office.\n\nSome were at City Hall one day, gone the next.\n\nOthers were treated to a full public hanging, simply because they dared disagree with King David.\n\nTake ex-police chief Julian Fantino. When council tried to re-open the subject of Fantino’s contract in July of 2004, Miller quickly shut down debate.\n\nThere was the very public case of Municipal Licensing and Standards boss Pam Coburn, fired in October 2005 by Miller at a press conference.\n\nAngelos Bacopoulos, former head of solid waste management, was also told in 2005 that his contract wouldn’t be renewed with one year left to go before retirement. The reason? He was not prepared to be the mayor’s toady.\n\nDitto for lovely Tim Ivanyshyn, the manager who oversaw the unit responsible for approving councillor expense claims. He was fired without cause in early 2008 for daring to blow the whistle on how some councillors misused their expense budgets.\n\nTo this day, I believe former city manager Shirley Hoy was pushed out the door in 2008. Highy competent Brenda Librecz, general manager of parks and recreation, was treated like dirt by the Millerites before she left for the top job in Markham.\n\nMike Price, Paula Dill, Joe Halstead, Joan Anderton, Dave Kaufman, Eric Gam and Ana Bassios were all top bureaucrats pushed out the door so Miller could install his own toadies.\n\nOne more thing. Lest you think Tuesday’s leftist theatre of the absurd over this so-called “abuse of power” ended with the vote to axe Webster, think again.\n\nAfter the vote, Stintz, Parker, Milczyn, Perks, McConnell, Mihevc, Carroll and assorted other transit hangers-on met to hold a wake for the CGM.\n\nThe tributes flowed from the usual leftist suspects.\n\n“We lost a great man in Gary,” proclaimed Parker.\n\nThen they all held hands and had a group cry."
