        "text": "Midway down the red carpet at the Money Monster premiere on May 12, Julia Roberts defied the strict rule that all women must wear heels on the carpet at the Cannes Film Festival and removed hers. She walked the rest of the way to the premiere barefoot, laughing as she did so. America’s sweetheart scoffs at convention. Now, it appears she might be inspiring other actresses to do the same. Sasha Lane, who’s making waves as a breakout star at this year’s festival thanks to her performance in American Honey, also ditched any sort of footwear at the photo-call for the film on Sunday.\n\nAmerican Honey is Sasha Lane’s first movie. She plays the film’s protagonist, Star, an 18-year-old barely surviving on food she finds in supermarket Dumpsters in Texas. She joins a group of teens and twentysomethings selling magazine subscriptions door-to-door in hopes of escaping her past life. Director Andrea Arnold discovered Lane, who is from Texas, while she was sunbathing on the beach during spring break. Before she started filming American Honey, Lane worked at On the Border, a Mexican restaurant. She was hesitant to listen to Arnold’s pitch about auditioning for the movie, because Lane knew that adult film producers also liked to trawl the beaches during spring break looking for talent.\n\n“I felt Andrea’s vibe. She just seemed really nice and smiley,” Lane tells The Telegraph about how she decided to trust the filmmaker. “I knew she was someone important and going to look out for me and that this wasn’t going to be a porn scam.”"
