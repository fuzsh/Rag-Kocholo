She has a brother named Eric, a sister named Lisa, and a half-sister named Nancy. Robert’s parents were actors and playwrights. When the actress was a child, her parents ran a children’s acting school. Her parents’ work influenced her to pursue an acting career. Roberts went to Campbell High School, Griffin Middle School, and Fitzhugh Lee Elementary School. She enrolled at Georgia State University after finishing high school. Roberts dropped out of college to follow her dreams of becoming an actress. She then moved to New York and enrolled in several classes in acting.

After her debut on the big screen, Roberts did two more films before having her big breakthrough, “Mystic Pizza” and “Steel Magnolias.” With “Steel Magnolias,” Roberts got her first Academy Award nomination and won her first Golden Globe Award. In 1990, the actress got the leading role in the movie “Pretty Woman.” Her performance in “Pretty Woman” made Roberts a worldwide-known movie star. In 2002, Roberts won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the film “Erin Brockovich.”\n\nRoberts dated several Hollywood personalities. In 1993 she married Lyle Lovett, a country singer.
