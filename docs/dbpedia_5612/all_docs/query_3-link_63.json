The burgeoning superstar had ducked into the Armani boutique in Beverly Hills ahead of the ceremony and found the now iconic outfit in the menswear department, she tells Vogue. “I could not have known that it was gonna become this statement outfit,” Roberts says of her ’90s tailoring’s current ubiquity on Instagram and Pinterest. “I just thought I looked fabulous... and I still have that suit.” Watch the full episode of British Vogue’s Life in Looks, as Julia Roberts breaks down 17 of her most memorable looks.",

        "text": "What's my style? In a word, Edward.\n\n[Edward] Chic and effortless.\n\nChic and effortless.\n\nYou know, my style is chic effortless.\n\nI was told that once by a friend,\n\nand so I'm gonna just go with that.\n\n[bright music]\n\nHi, British Vogue. My name is Julia Roberts.\n\nAnd this is my Life in Looks.\n\nWhat will it be? This is me before I met Serge Normant.\n\nAs is very clear by this haircut.\n\nI had no future at that point\n\nand I had no tweezers either, apparently.\n\nLook at my eyebrows.\n\nWell, I wore this outfit a lot.\n\nThe jacket, I thought I had a big butt\n\nand that's why I wore that jacket like that in the movie.\n\nAnd why I have a plastic chicken foot as my accessory.\n\nI don't know.\n\nThe funny thing about this dress\n\nis I think it was about $20.\n\nIt was, I think black and white\n\nand the costume designer changed it up\n\nto make it a little bit different\n\nand the boots were really uncomfortable.\n\nMarilyn Vance was so great.\n\nShe made the red dress that I wore.\n\nShe made the polka dot dress that I wear to the polo match.\n\nI remember her to be very caring\n\nabout how I felt in the clothes\n\nbecause I'm not really comfortable wearing such bare things.\n\nAnd she was very mindful and respectful of that\n\nand I appreciated that.\n\nThis was one of my all-time favorite outfits\n\nfor the Golden Globes.\n\nI went for Steel Magnolias.\n\nI did my hair, my girlfriend did my makeup,\n\nand I got this suit at Armani in Beverly Hills.\n\nI went into the men's department\n\nand they had an in-store tailor\n\nand they tailored it to fit me.\n\nI don't even know that people wore really fancy gowns\n\nto the Golden Globes then the way they do now.\n\nBut I thought that I was very extra in this outfit.\n\nI could not have known that it was gonna become\n\nthis like statement outfit.\n\nI just thought I looked fabulous and I still have that suit.\n\nI can't believe how tan I am in this photo. I'm adorable.\n\nI made all the necklaces that I'm wearing in this picture.\n\nThis looks like I'm at the airport\n\nand it's a paparazzi picture,\n\nso I'm smiling through terror, no doubt.\n\nBack in these days, there were no fashion rules.\n\nYou just wore whatever you wanted to wear.\n\nAnd I wore jeans and a white T-shirt all the time.\n\nAnd I think obviously wearing this black blazer,\n\nI thought I was very dressed up.\n\nI'm a little ashamed of these sneakers, I have to say.\n\nAll these pictures, when my 19-year-old daughter sees them,\n\nshe's like, Mom, where are those pants?\n\nWhere's that jacket?\n\nBecause now what's old is new and cool again.\n\nThis was Richard Tyler.\n\nObviously the suit is a theme in my life.\n\nAnd short hair, cute. Stockings, maybe a swing and a miss.\n\nAnother little statue of gold in my hand. Always fun.\n\nOh, now I do not know who this woman is.\n\nShe's got quite a look here. I'm kind of staring at her.\n\nThis was at an event in Las Vegas and one of the few times\n\nI ever have shown my belly button in public.\n\nI feel really good about that right now\n\nbecause my belly button doesn't look like that anymore.\n\nThis was Ralph Lauren. How do I remember that?\n\nHigh boobs, low waist. It's fabulous.\n\nOh, Vivienne Tam skirt. I loved this skirt.\n\nI had it in two colors.\n\nI have a picture of myself and Muhammad Ali from this night\n\nthat is on my shelf at home.\n\nThis might have been the sweater that I wore\n\nin that scene in Notting Hill with Hugh at the end,\n\nbecause it looks the same.\n\nI mean, this is pre stylist.\n\nThis is just when you put on what you think looks nice.\n\nThis is a Cynthia Rowley dress\n\nthat I bought in her store in downtown Manhattan\n\nfor the Stepmom premiere.\n\nI loved it so much. I just thought it was so beautiful.\n\nIt fit perfectly.\n\nI don't do a lot of strapless, historically speaking,\n\nand I thought it was fantastic.\n\nWhen did I get a stylist?\n\nLet's hurry up and get a stylist, shall we?\n\nVivienne Tam, this was the premiere of Notting Hill\n\nin London.\n\nI waved and people saw I had armpit hair. It was a scandal.\n\nI could scandalize you people right now\n\nif I took my jacket off.\n\nOh, Erin Brockovich, fabulous. So fabulous.\n\nThe engineering that went into creating this bust line\n\nwe had, you know, NASA send a couple people in to help.\n\nWe accomplished our goals. Was very impressed.\n\nDisappointing at the end of the day\n\nwhen I took it all off.\n\nI mean, look at the little side skin. Sexy.\n\nOur costume designer on this, Jeffrey Kurland,\n\nwho I had worked with on My Best Friend's Wedding,\n\nand then he did Ocean's 11 and Ocean's 12.\n\nA brilliant costume designer.\n\nAnd he really just found all the right pieces\n\nto create the sense of her style and her vibe\n\nand the way that she portrayed herself.\n\nSometimes costumes, when they're so unlike\n\nwhat you would wear normally, make it that much easier\n\nto get into character.\n\nIt was a good, extra boost into character study.\n\nAnd then I won the Oscar.\n\nOh, the next page. What did I just say?\n\nThis dress, Oscars are on a Sunday,\n\nand I tried this dress on on Saturday.\n\nFabulous stylist, Deborah Mason.\n\nAmazing, beautiful woman, just incredible.\n\nAnd she went to Valentino\n\nand went into their basement archive and rooted around\n\nand found this dress, brought it to my hotel the Saturday\n\nbefore the Oscars, I tried it on, it fit perfectly.\n\nWe did no alterations to it. And they let me keep it.\n\nPeople say, How do I know when a script is right for me?\n\nYou just read it and you just feel it\n\nand you go, Yep, this is something\n\nthat I wanna be a part of.\n\nAnd it's the same thing I think with any outfit,\n\nwhether it be super dressed up or casual.\n\nYou know, you put on a pair of jeans\n\nand you go, Oh yeah, these are the jeans for me.\n\nYou just know.\n\nThe bracelet, I didn't get to keep. But you know what?\n\nMariah Carey bought it.\n\nThat's who has that bracelet right there.\n\nAh, all right. Ricardo Tisci.\n\nI love Ricardo Tisci inside and out.\n\nThis day was fun to spend an entire day\n\ndoing a photo shoot where never once did he say Smile.\n\nI think I smiled once and he said, Can you not do that?\n\nAnd I thought, Hmm, we're best friends. I looked so rad.\n\nThis is the coolest moment of my life\n\nand thank God someone took a picture of it.\n\nI like my hair like that too.\n\nHere I am at the Cannes Film Festival\n\nand I'm wearing Armani.\n\nI am terrified here.\n\nVery scary, all these people taking your picture\n\nall at once.\n\nWe were there for Money Monster,\n\na movie I did with this up-and-comer, George Clooney.\n\nKeep your ears out for that name because he's going places.\n\nAnd I'd never been before 'cause it looks so scary on TV.\n\nSo there is this huge flight of stairs to walk up\n\nand I just thought, Wow, that seems kinda dodgy\n\nin these heels.\n\nAnd I just stepped out of them very quietly\n\nand as I was walking up these stairs, I did think to myself,\n\nHmm, how will I get my shoes back? It was a statement.\n\nI didn't wanna fall down the fucking stairs.\n\nThat was a statement.\n\nOh, look at this.\n\nNow this is one of my favorite outfits I've ever worn\n\nin my whole life, this Armani jumpsuit.\n\nAnd look at him, he's such a nice man.\n\nI really adore Giorgio Armani.\n\nHe has been a friend and he's a legend\n\nand he's a really beautiful person.\n\nGiorgio Armani is the kind of person\n\nthat you can tell he's living his dreams.\n\nHe's living his best life. What he does is what he loves.\n\nAnd this jumpsuit fit me like a glove.\n\nI felt like a million bucks in it. My boobs look good too.\n\nAdidas and Gucci. Do you have to say anything else?\n\nCute guy in the picture. What was his name again?\n\nGeorge and I met for Oceans 11,\n\nand within about five minutes we were just like,\n\nOh, we're gonna be best friends forever.\n\nAnd that's pretty much what happened.\n\nThis was going into a talk show\n\nto promote, Ticket to Paradise.\n\nIt's such a good outfit. It's really good.\n\nAll right, Thom Browne. I love me some Thom Browne\n\nI love a tie, I love a stripe, a coat over the shoulders.\n\nI think an impeccable look.\n\nJust finished shooting the cover of British Vogue.\n\nRichard Curtis, he agreed to do the interview\n\nfor the British Vogue piece.\n\nHe and his wife have been friends for a really long time.\n\nHe is such a great writer and there's just no telling\n\nwhat he's gonna write down,\n\nbut I'm sure it will be witty and clever\n\nand very Richard Curtis.\n\nAfter very long days of travel\n\nand very long days of promotion,\n\nI worked until about 12:45 last night,\n\nand got up today like it was Christmas morning\n\nto do the cover of British Vogue.\n\nAnd we had such a good time.\n\nI'm sure if nothing else, that the photos will reflect\n\nthe incredible amount of joy that we all felt today.\n\nThank you. This was super fun.\n\nI'm gonna close our little story time book here.\n\nAnd thank you very much."
