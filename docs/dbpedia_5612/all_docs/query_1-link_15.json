        "text": "I've been waiting for at least 15 years for a Julia Roberts cover for Vogue (US or UK) but I've never understood why in her more than 30 year career she's only had one (Vogue US in the 90s) Does Anna Wintour not love Julia Roberts? I love the glamorous 70s style\n\nI guess her last US Vogue covers in 94 wasn’t a best selling or something.\n\nThe cover isnt bad according to todays standards, the hair gives it a 70s / 80S YSL feel but I wish she was looking at the camera. I love the editorial, nice to see her styled in a more vintage style, Anna would have her in a garden wearing pastels or maroon.\n\nknee-jerk reaction: she looks crazy\n\nafter seeing the other photos: she still looks crazy\n\nit's the hair. the hair and that out of place piece of bang ruins it. full, uniform, bountiful curls would have rounded out this feature which had the elements to actually be great. the electrocuted hair flattens the whole look.\n\ncongrats on the cover, julia, but the hair... nah\n\nI love this cover… until I look at it for too long, at which point Julia starts to look manic. Beautiful colour scheme and background though, and great to get an unexpected choice from Edward. I love an outside shot at nighttime and it’s refreshing to see one on the cover.\n\nHappily awaiting this issue in the post, it’s the touch of glamour I need amidst the gloominess of January.\n\nReview time!\n\n186 pages\n\nThe Meet Cute\n\nStar: Julia Roberts\n\nPhotographer: Lachlan Bailey\n\nStylist: Edward Enninful\n\nWriter: Richard Curtis\n\n10 pages (including article)\n\nGreat Strides\n\nModel: Liu Wen\n\nPhotographer: Dan Martensen\n\nStylist: Kate Phelan\n\n10 pages\n\nAdventures in Motherland\n\nStar: Sienna Miller\n\nPhotographer: Annie Leibovitz\n\nStylist: Tabitha Simmons\n\nWriter: Chloe Schama\n\nSienna's US Vogue article + editorial\n\n4 pages (including article)\n\nUp & Away\n\nModels: Sora Choi, America Gonzalez\n\nPhotographer: Scott Trindle\n\nStylist: Eniola Dare\n\n12 pages\n\nMy Roman Empire\n\nModel: Lila Moss\n\nPhotographer: Theo Liu\n\nStylist: Gabriella Kareefa Johnson\n\nWriter: Jason Horowitz\n\nEditorial shot in Rome featuring the new Gucci collection + article about Sabato De Sarno\n\n8 pages (including article)\n\nReality Check\n\nStar: AJ Odudu\n\nPhotographer: Ben Weller\n\nStylist: Jessica Gerardi\n\nWriter: Kerry McDermott\n\nFeature on TV presenter Aj Odudu\n\n6 pages (including article)\n\nNew Horizons\n\nModels: Angelina Kendall, Jill Kortleve, Awar Odhiang, Chu Wong\n\nPhotographer: Jack Davison\n\nStylist: Alex Harrington\n\n12 pages\n\n+\n\nFront-of-book features on:\n\nCordelia De Castellane's apartment in Paris\n\nLeslie Jamison on how to dress for her new life after divorce\n\nTate Modern's new director Karin Hindsbo\n\nA look at Vogue's 'Forces for Change' party\n\n+\n\nVogue Asks (back page Q&A)\n\nGwyneth Paltrow on the last page for 'Vogue Asks'\n\n-\n\nSo it's quite a packed little issue!

It says Spring/Summer 2024 and it’s shot by Meisel. It also lists the model names but the writing is so small and hard to read that I can only make out Nora Attal and Lulu Tenney. There’s also a model named Vivienne but I can’t read any of the others.\n\nThere are 8 pages of these ads in the issue, but here’s a couple of previews.

But even having a career like that, as Angelina Jolie, her beauty makes the things way more worthy to see. It's not a classic model beauty, she has the Hollywood beautiful appeal. It's another type, but puts her even above a fashion model. It's something I can't explain.\n\nI’m not the best at keeping up with campaigns but I think this is a new one for Dolce & Gabbana?
