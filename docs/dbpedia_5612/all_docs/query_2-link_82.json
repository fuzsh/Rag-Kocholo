        "text": "Character Strengths and Virtues is a groundbreaking handbook compiling the work of researchers to create a classification system for widely valued positive traits.\n\nThis handbook also intends to provide an empirical theoretical framework that will assist positive psychology practitioners in developing practical applications for the field.\n\nThere are 6 classes of virtues that are made up of 24 character strengths:\n\nWisdom and Knowledge\n\nCourage\n\nHumanity\n\nJustice\n\nTemperance\n\nTranscendence\n\nResearchers approached the measurement of “good character” based on the strengths of authenticity, persistence, kindness, gratitude, hope, humor, and more.\n\nBefore you continue, we thought you might like to download our three Strengths Exercises for free. These detailed, science-based exercises will help you or your clients realize your unique potential and create a life that feels energized and authentic.\n\nWhat Makes Us Strong and Virtuous?\n\nCultures around the world have valued the study of human strength and virtue. Psychologists have a particular interest in it as they work to encourage individuals to develop these traits. While all cultures value human virtues, different cultures express or act on virtues in different ways based on differing societal values and norms.\n\nMartin Seligman and his colleagues studied all major religions and philosophical traditions and found that the same six virtues (i.e. courage, humanity, justice, etc.) were shared in virtually all cultures across three millennia.\n\nSince these virtues are considered too abstract to be studied scientifically, positive psychology practitioners focused their attention on the strengths of character created by virtues, and created tools for their measurement.\n\nThe main assessment instruments they used to measure those strengths were:\n\nStructured interviews\n\nQuestionnaires\n\nInformant Reports\n\nBehavioral Experiments\n\nObservations\n\nThe main criteria for characters strengths that they came up with are that each trait should:\n\nBe stable across time and situations\n\nBe valued in its own right, even in the absence of other benefits\n\nBe recognized and valued in almost every culture, be considered non-controversial and independent of politics.\n\nCultures provide role models that possess the trait so other people can recognize its worth.\n\nParents aim to instil the trait or value in their children.\n\nThe CSV Handbook’s List\n\nThe Handbook delves into each of these six traits. We’ve summarized key points here.\n\n1. Virtue of Wisdom and Knowledge\n\nThe more curious and creative we allow ourselves to become, the more we gain perspective and wisdom and will, in turn, love what we are learning. This is developing the virtue of wisdom and knowledge.\n\nStrengths that accompany this virtue involve acquiring and using knowledge:\n\nCreativity (e.g. Albert Einstein’s creativity led him to acquire knowledge and wisdom about the universe)\n\nCuriosity\n\nOpen-mindedness\n\nLove of Learning\n\nPerspective and Wisdom (Fun fact: many studies have found that adults’ self-ratings of perspective and wisdom do not depend on age, which contrasts the popular idea that our wisdom increases with age).\n\n2. Virtue of Courage\n\nThe braver and more persistent we become, the more our integrity will increase because we will reach a state of feeling vital, and this results in being more courageous in character.\n\nStrengths that accompany this virtue involve accomplishing goals in the face of things that oppose it:\n\nBravery\n\nPersistence\n\nIntegrity\n\nVitality\n\n3. Virtue of Humanity\n\nThere is a reason why Oprah Winfrey is seen as a symbol of virtue for humanitarians: on every show, she approaches her guests with respect, appreciation, and interest (social intelligence), she practices kindness through her charity work, and she shows her love to her friends and family.\n\nStrengths that accompany this virtue include caring and befriending others:\n\nLove\n\nKindness\n\nSocial intelligence\n\n4. Virtue of Justice\n\nMahatma Gandhi was the leader of the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. He led India to independence and helped created movements for civil rights and freedom by being an active citizen in nonviolent disobedience. His work has been applied worldwide for its universality.\n\nStrengths that accompany this virtue include those that build a healthy and stable community:\n\nBeing an active citizen who is socially responsible, loyal, and a team member.\n\nFairness\n\nLeadership\n\n5. Virtue of Temperance\n\nBeing forgiving, merciful, humble, prudent, and in control of our behaviors and instincts prevents us from being arrogant, selfish, or any other trait that is excessive or unbalanced.\n\nStrengths that are included in this virtue are those that protect against excess:\n\nForgiveness and mercy\n\nHumility and modesty\n\nPrudence\n\nSelf-Regulation and Self-control\n\n6. Virtue of Transcendence\n\nThe Dalai Lama is a transcendent being who speaks openly why he never loses hope in humanity’s potential. He also appreciates nature in its perfection and lives according to what he believes is his intended purpose.\n\nStrengths that accompany this virtue include those that forge connections to the larger universe and provide meaning:\n\nAppreciation of beauty and excellence\n\nGratitude\n\nHope\n\nHumor and playfulness\n\nSpirituality, or a sense of purpose\n\nDownload 3 Free Strengths Exercises (PDF)\n\nThese detailed, science-based exercises will equip you or your clients with tools to discover and harness their unique strengths.\n\nDownload PDF\n\nPositive Psychology & Character Strengths and Virtues\n\nPositive psychology practitioners can count on practical applications to help individuals and organizations identify their strengths and use them to increase and maintain their levels of wellbeing.\n\nThey also emphasize that these character strengths exist on a continuum; positive traits are regarded as individual differences that exist in degrees rather than all-or-nothing categories.\n\nIn fact, the handbook has an internal subtitle entitled “A Manual of the Sanities” because it is intended to do for psychological wellbeing what the DSM does for psychological disorders: to add systematic knowledge and ways to master new skills and topics.\n\nResearch shows that these human strengths can act as buffers against mental illness. For instance, being optimistic prevents one’s chances of becoming depressed. The absence of particular strengths may be an indication of psychopathology. Positive psychology therapists, counselors, coaches, and other psychological professions use these new methods and techniques to help build people’s strength and broaden their lives.\n\nIt should be noted that many researchers are advocating grouping these 24 traits into just four classes of strength (Intellectual, Social, Temperance, and Transcendence) or even three classes (excluding transcendence), as evidence has shown that these classes do an adequate job of capturing all 24 original traits.\n\nOthers caution that people occasionally use these traits to excess, which can become a liability to the person. For example, some people may use humor as a defense mechanism in order to avoid dealing with a tragedy.\n\nCharacter Strengths\n\nCharacter strengths are the positive parts of our personality that make us feel authentic and engaged. They are a core and foundational part of who we are. Our strengths are linked to our development, wellbeing, and life satisfaction (Niemiec, 2013).\n\nThey influence how we think, act, feel, and represent what we value in ourselves and others. When we draw on our strengths, research shows we can have a more influential positive impact on others, improve our relationships, and enhance our wellbeing and happiness.\n\nSo, where can we begin? By recognizing our strengths, of course!\n\nThe VIA Survey is one validated tool that can help us discover our strengths, including those we tend to use and rely on the most (Peterson & Seligman, 2004).\n\nScientists found a common language of 24 character strengths that make up what is best about our personality. Everyone possesses all 24 character strengths to different degrees, so each person has a truly unique character strengths profile.\n\nEach character strength falls under one of these six broad virtue categories, which are universal across cultures and nations:\n\nWisdom: These strengths are useful in helping us learn and gather knowledge.\n\nCourage: These emotional strengths empower us to tackle adversity and how we tend to work through it.\n\nHumanity: These strengths come into play by helping us build and maintain positive, warm relationships with others.\n\nJustice: With these strengths, we relate to those around us in social or group situations.\n\nTemperance: Temperance strengths help us manage habits and protect against excess, including managing and overcoming vices.\n\nTranscendence: As a virtue, transcendence strengths connect us to the world around us in a meaningful way.\n\nKnowing our strengths allows us to consciously use those that benefit us and develop those that we might find useful.\n\nWhat Strengths Do Women Score Higher?\n\nThere’s an interest in identifying dominant character strengths in genders and how it is developed.\n\nAs Martin Seligman and his colleagues studied all major religions and philosophical traditions to find universal virtues, much of the research on gender and character strengths have been cross-cultural also.\n\nIn a study by Brdar, Anic, & Rijavec on gender differences and character strengths, women scored highest on the strengths of honesty, kindness, love, gratitude, and fairness.\n\nLife satisfaction for women was predicted by zest, gratitude, hope, appreciation of beauty/excellence, and love for other women. A recent study by Mann showed that women tend to score higher on gratitude than men. Alex Linley and colleagues reported in a UK study that women not only scored higher in interpersonal strengths, such as love and kindness, but on social intelligence, too.\n\nIn a cross-cultural study in Spain by Ovejero and Cardenal, they found that femininity was positively correlated with love, social intelligence, appreciation of beauty, love of learning, forgiveness, spirituality, and creativity. The more masculine a man was, the more he correlated negatively with these character strengths.\n\nWorld’s Largest Positive Psychology Resource\n\nThe Positive Psychology Toolkit© is a groundbreaking practitioner resource containing over 500 science-based exercises, activities, interventions, questionnaires, and assessments created by experts using the latest positive psychology research.\n\nUpdated monthly. 100% Science-based.\n\n“The best positive psychology resource out there!”\n\n— Emiliya Zhivotovskaya, Flourishing Center CEO\n\nWhat Strengths Do Men Score Higher?\n\nBrdar, Anic & Rijavac reported that men score highest on honesty, hope, humor, gratitude, and curiosity.\n\nTheir life satisfaction was predicted by creativity, perspective, fairness, and humor. Alex Linley and colleagues study showed that men scored higher than females on creativity.\n\nMiljković and Rijavec’s study found sex differences in a sample of college students. Men not only scored higher in creativity, but also leadership, self-control, and zest. These findings are congruent with gender stereotypes, as the study by Ovejero and Cardenal in Spain showed that men did not equate typical masculine strengths with love, forgiveness, love of learning, and so on.\n\nIn a Croatian sample, Brdar and colleagues found that men viewed cognitive strengths as a greater predictor for life satisfaction. Men saw strengths such as teamwork, kindness, perspective, and courage to be a stronger connection to life satisfaction than other strengths. There is an important limitation to this sample population, as most of the participants were women.\n\nWhat Can We Learn From Both?\n\nWhile there are differences in character strengths between men and women, there are many that they share. Both genders saw gratitude, hope, and zest as being related to higher life satisfaction, as well as the tendency to live in accordance with the strengths that are valued in their particular culture.\n\nStudies confirm that there is a duality between genders, but only when both genders identify strongly with gender stereotypes. It makes one wonder if men and women are inherently born with certain strengths, or if the cultural influence of certain traits prioritizes different traits based on gender norms.\n\nLearn more about strengths and weaknesses tests here.\n\nDevelopment of Character Strengths in Children\n\nPeterson and Seligman’s, Character Strengths in Action handbook (2004) theorized that it is not common for some young children to demonstrate gratitude, open-mindedness, authenticity, and forgiveness.\n\nPark and Peterson’s study (2006) confirmed this theoretical speculation, concluding that these sophisticated character strengths usually require a degree of cognitive maturation that develops during adolescence. So although gratitude is associated with happiness in adolescents and adulthood, this is not the case in young children.\n\nPark and Peterson’s study found that the association of gratitude with happiness starts at age seven.\n\n“Gratitude is seen as a human strength that enhances one’s personal and relational wellbeing and is beneficial for society as a whole.”\n\nSimmel\n\nAlthough most young children are not yet cognitively mature enough for sophisticated character strengths, there are many fundamental character strengths that are developed at a very early stage.\n\nThe strengths of love, zest, and hope are associated with happiness starting at a very young age. The strengths of love and hope are dependent on the infant and caregiver relationship. A secure attachment to the caregiver at infancy is more likely to result in psychological and social well adjustment throughout their lives.\n\nThe nurturing of a child plays a significant role in their development, and role modeling is an important way of teaching a child certain character strengths as they imitate behavior and can then embrace the strength as one of their own.\n\nMost young children don’t have the cognitive maturity to display gratitude but have the ability to display love and hope. Therefore, gratitude must not be expected from a young child but must be taught.\n\nPositive education programs have been developed to help children and adolescents focus on character strengths. There are certain character strengths in adolescents that have a clearer impact on psychological wellbeing. These strengths must be fostered to ensure life long fulfillment and satisfaction.\n\n“Character strengths are influenced by family, community, societal, and other contextual factors.
