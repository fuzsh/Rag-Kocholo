        "text": "This risk calculator asks questions about your personal and family history to determine the possibility of developing breast cancer. The results will display your lifetime risk score. The purpose of this tool is simply to inform you. Please consult with your physician should you have any questions about your risk for breast cancer or for guidance on options for breast cancer screening or genetic counseling.\n\nThe Tyrer-Cuzick model is not intended to assess the risk of women who have already been diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nAttention Clinical Users: This free calculator is for non-commercial, including non-clinical use. Such use would require a license. Learn more about our clinical risk assessment software.\n\nBased on the information provided, your estimated lifetime risk for developing invasive breast cancer is . The U.S. population's average lifetime risk is for women of the same age.\n\nIf your lifetime risk is 20% or greater: you are at high risk for developing breast cancer. Yearly MRI is recommended in addition to a mammogram. If MRI is not possible, a contrast-enhanced mammogram (CEM) or molecular breast imaging (MBI) is recommended. If these tests are not possible, an ultrasound should be considered.\n\nIf your lifetime risk is less than 20% and you have dense breasts: dense breasts make cancer more difficult to see on a mammogram. Consider yearly MRI in addition to your yearly mammogram as MRI finds more cancers than a mammogram alone in dense breasts. If MRI is not possible, consider a contrast-enhanced mammogram (CEM) or molecular breast imaging (MBI). If these tests are not possible, consider ultrasound.\n\nIf your lifetime risk is less than 20% and you do not have dense breasts, it is recommended that you follow protocol for women at average risk for breast cancer (and without dense breasts). A yearly mammogram beginning at age 40 is recommended for women at average risk.\n\nShould you have any questions about the results you see here, recommendations for screening tests, or about your personal breast cancer screening journey, please contact your healthcare provider (primary care physician or OB GYN).\n\nDisclaimer: This information is not intended as a substitute for professional healthcare or to replace a healthcare professional's evaluation. Always consult with a healthcare provider for advice concerning your health. Only your healthcare provider can determine if you have breast cancer. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking advice or treatment because of something you have read here."
