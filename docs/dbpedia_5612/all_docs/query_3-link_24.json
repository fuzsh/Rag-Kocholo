        "text": "Emma Roberts Shared The Lessons She Learned From Growing Up Around Julia Roberts’s “Scary” Level Of Fame\n\n“When you've seen fame like that up close, and you see what that really does to people and to their families… it’s scary sometimes.”\n\nEmma Roberts has no interest in reaching the same “scary” levels of fame as her Oscar-winning aunt.\n\nIf the last name wasn’t enough of a clue, Emma is Julia Roberts’s niece.\n\nFrom playing dress-up on the Erin Brockovich set to being cast as an extra in America’s Sweethearts, Emma’s historically made no secret of the fact that she learned a lot about the industry by tagging along with her aunt throughout her childhood.\n\nBy the age of 8, Emma was inspired to get into acting, too, and she soon landed a role in her first movie, Blow, alongside Johnny Depp and Penélope Cruz, when she was only 9 years old.\n\nAs she got older, she moved on to teen movies like Aquamarine, Wild Child, and Nancy Drew. Although she’s perhaps best known for her work with Ryan Murphy, having starred in Scream Queens and numerous seasons of American Horror Story.\n\nEmma has previously brushed off comparisons between herself and Julia, telling Tatler that she “never aspired” to replicate her aunt’s career path. “I love her so much, I love her work, but I’m just doing my own thing,” she said.\n\nNow, the 33-year-old is doubling down on her stance, admitting that she does not envy her Aunt Julia’s fame after witnessing the scrutiny that comes with it.\n\n“It’s obviously fun, and it’s great, but there is a part of it that’s really scary,” she said during the latest episode of iHeartPodcasts’ Table for Two with Bruce Bozzi, where she recalled seeing “very up close” what mega-fame “really looks like.”\n\n“Fame at a certain level is kind of scary,” she reiterated. “And I remember [thinking] as a kid, even in my later teens, I never want my fame to outweigh my work because there’s nothing scarier to me than being so famous that you’re never left alone.”\n\nAt the start of this year, Julia appeared on the cover of British Vogue and reflected on being perceived as “harsh” or “difficult” to work with earlier in her career.\n\n“I think I speak very plainly,” she told the outlet. “That’s kind of how I see myself. I’m very forthright. There are a lot of personalities in the world that don’t accept that easily, and it can seem really harsh, even if I feel like I’m just being honest about something and just saying this is how I see it. I never am trying to be unkind.”\n\nShare This Article"
