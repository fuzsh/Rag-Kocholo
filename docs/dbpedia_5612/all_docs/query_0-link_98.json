On her face, she wore hunter-green eyeglasses.\n\nTo Ms. Roberts’s left was her longtime stylist, Elizabeth Stewart. To her right was her longtime publicist, Marcy Engelman. At a table by the windows was her new friend Edward Enninful, the outgoing editor in chief of British Vogue.\n\nIt was two days before the Oscars, and the parties were already in full swing.\n\nAt some, the movies were the main thing being celebrated. At others, the upcoming awards merely served as a pretext for luxury brands to place their products on actors and actresses, rappers and singers, basketball players and TikTok influencers."
