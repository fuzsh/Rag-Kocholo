        "text": "After hundreds of fashion shows across New York, London, Paris, and Milan, the spring 2024 season has finally come to a close. Perhaps nobody is more ready for a break than the models, many of whom walked a marathon of shows across all four cities.\n\nThere were plenty of new faces who caught our eyes this season. Some, like Sascha Rajasalu and Hejia Li, walked 27 shows. Others, like Violet Hume and Ali Dansky, closed out major runways.\n\nThis season, Vogue rounded up 11 of the most exciting breakouts. The new class is an international bunch: some are working in their hometown of New York City, while others hail from Morocco, China, Australia, Estonia, and Brazil. You may recognize some thanks to their successful acting and singing careers or their early life in the public eye. Others have come from more anonymous beginnings, scouted in their hometowns and quickly rising to the upper echelons of the fashion industry. Below, discover the 11 freshest faces from the spring 2024 season."
