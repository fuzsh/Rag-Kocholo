        "text": "For a long time, there was only one name people thought of when it came to plus size models: Ashley Graham. She was (and is) a household name, breaking down barriers in a world that for far too long, valued thinness above all else.\n\nThese days, however, things are certainly changing (and not a second too soon, given that the average Australian woman is a size 12 to 14). From Australian Australians Robyn Lawley and Kate Wasley to the unapologetic Tess Holliday and bonafide supermodel Paloma Elsesser, these women not only have millions of fans on social media but are appearing on the runway, red carpet and cover of magazines.\n\nThese woman are also calling for more representation in our fashion media, as well as releasing plus size clothing lines that prove fashion doesn’t end at a size 16.\n\n“The industry may carve out space for a select few names like mine, but it firmly shuts the door on countless others,” Elsesser wrote in a 2024 essay for The Cut.\n\n“Yes, I face criticism and doubt, but I keep going because it matters. I continue because it matters enough to me and because the people it impacts matter enough to me.”\n\nHere, the 14 most famous plus-size models in the world.\n\nPaloma Elsesser\n\nPaloma Elsesser shot to fame after she appeared on Glossier billboards and as the face of Fenty Beauty, and her career has only gone from strength to strength.
