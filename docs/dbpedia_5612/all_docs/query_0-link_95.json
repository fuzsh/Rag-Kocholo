        "text": "Naturally, Vivian Ward is living her dream.\n\nWith a stacked IMDb page that includes rom-com favorites like Pretty Woman, Notting Hill, and Runaway Bride, Julia Roberts isn't a stranger to a blockbuster. She is, however, not so familiar with the world of sequels, but in a new interview on CBS Mornings, Roberts told co-host Gayle King that she had a few ideas for where her iconic characters would be today if their stories continued after the credits rolled. Roberts, who stars in Netflix's new movie Leave the World Behind, played a game called \"Where Are They Now?\" with King and didn't hold back when it came to her beloved characters.\n\nWhen Gayle asked the Oscar winner about Pretty Woman, one of the films that shot Roberts into superstardom, she said that her character would definitely be in the corner office.\n\n\"I think he passed away peacefully in his sleep from a heart attack, smiling,\" Roberts said of her co-star Richard Gere's character, Edward. And as for Ms. Vivian Ward? \"Now she runs his business.\"\n\nAnd as for 1999's Notting Hill, which co-starred Hugh Grant? Roberts doubled down on the entrepreneurship, saying that her character, an actress named Anna Scott, would be running a quiet knitting annex across the pond.\n\n\"She's retired. She has six children and has maintained her waist size, amazingly. And yeah ... he runs the bookshop still. And now there's a little knitting annex to the bookshop that she runs,\" Roberts explained.\n\nRelated: Julia Roberts Just Revealed the \"Hardest Drug\" She's Ever Taken\n\nThe superstar even had ideas for other favorites, like My Best Friend's Wedding, where she played opposite Dermot Mulroney and Cameron Diaz.\n\n\"He's married and faithful to his wife,\" Roberts said of Mulroney's Michael O'Neal. \"And George and Julianne start a do-it-yourself show on HGTV and become wildly famous.\"\n\nRoberts's latest promotional tour has also included her opening up about her children going to college. Her twins, Hazel and Phinnaeus, enrolled last April.\n\n\"I mean, it makes me a little lightheaded,\" she told Extra. \"You say that, I mean, I'm completely excited for them. It's really thrilling and I wasn't lucky enough to have a college experience. And so to see how it's happening for them is really fascinating. And yeah, I'm just, I'm excited for them.\"\n\nHer kids' decision to pursue higher education hits close to home for the actress, who previously said that she never had the chance to go.\n\n''I had convinced myself that I had three choices: I could get married, I could go to college, or I could move to New York,\" she told the New York Times in 1990. \"Nobody was asking to get married and I didn't want to go away to school, so I moved.''\n\nFor more InStyle news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
