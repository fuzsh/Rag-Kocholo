        "text": "Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images\n\nThough we could swear that Pretty Woman just came out on VHS, like, last week, apparently it's a little older than that.\n\nThe R-rated rom-com actually hit theaters in 1990, ushering Julia Roberts' beaming visage into the national consciousness and giving rise to the phenomenon that is \"Julia Roberts.\"\n\nFast-tracked to the top of the A-list and nominated for an Oscar (which, incidentally, was already her second nomination), Roberts' star—while occasionally in hiding over the years behind the clouds of fickle box offices and her own desire to have a personal life—has yet to dim.\n\nSo few names still carry the wattage that Roberts' does, evoking the same level of reverence for decades and rebounding from any perceived misstep without missing a beat. And she's still such an exciting presence whenever she chooses to show up onscreen that it's hard to believe that moviegoers have been watching this woman for 30 whole years.\n\nBut don't let all this longevity make you feel anything less than fabulous. It certainly doesn't bother Roberts, who recently immersed herself in two of her juiciest roles in years and earned a Golden Globe nomination for her efforts—her ninth overall, but her first in a TV category.\n\n\"I think that's made-up bulls--t that at a certain age, the bell is going to ring and you are done, go on back home,\" Roberts, who turned 51 in October, told the U.K.'s i News last fall. \"It's silly and I don't think anybody buys into that. I don't think I am special. I've always been fortunate that I have always found the work I am looking for. I mean, 30 years is a long time and I am grateful and satisfied.\"\n\n\"But honestly, I don't know what freakout we're all supposed to have, turning 50. For myself, last year, I was quite proud and happy.\"\n\nShe also put it succinctly in the December 2017 issue of InStyle, talking about folks obsessing over her 50th birthday: \"Really, people? Are we still in that space? Did anyone go over this with George Clooney or Brad [Pitt] before their 50th birthdays?\"\n\n\"It's layered, it's crazy and it's mind-bending,\" Roberts said excitedly at the Toronto International Film Festival last September. \"How Sam made it work and made sense of it, and made it so stylish and just incredible...I'm just happy to be one of the elements to it.\"\n\n\"It's incredible, she's like none other,\" James said at TIFF about Roberts. \"She's one of the most important prolific actresses of our generation, and what's more impressive than just her as an actress is her as a human being, so I'm very blessed and grateful to have done this with her.\"\n\nCompared to the multiple-films-a-year schedule she maintained for over a decade, she conscientiously started to spread the work out more once she and Moder welcomed twins Phinnaeus (Finn, these days) and Hazel, in 2004, and then son Henry in 2007.\n\nThe family of five settled down in Malibu in a spacious, toy-strewn spread and one parent is always home when the other has to leave town to work. During school vacations and holidays, Roberts is known to have the kids on set with her. With two teenagers and an 11-year-old in the house, there's seemingly always a soccer game to go to (she tells E! she's a \"jubilant\" screamer on the sidelines) or other kid-centric errand to run.\n\n\"There's no way to describe it without sounding sappy or ridiculous because everything in my mind ends with an exclamation point,\" Roberts told InStyle in 2017. \"And the thing is, we have these three human beings who are just a complete reflection of the affection we have for each other.\"\n\nAfter 16 years and counting, she and Moder have been the subject of their share of split rumors, and by this point there's almost nothing to do but laugh. (She's got people to do more if need be.) \"What I like is when they write, 'The $150 Million Divorce,' and then a week later a different tabloid says, 'The $275 Million Divorce,'\" she shared with longtime pal Oprah Winfrey for the November 2018 issue of Harper's Bazaar. \"I'm like, 'Well, somebody got a paycheck in the last week. This is getting good.'\"\n\nRoberts loves to cook—naturally she brought homemade banana and pumpkin bread (plus healthy tangerines) when it was her weekend to bring snacks to soccer—and doles out homemade cookies at Christmas. She plays Mahjong weekly with her girlfriends in L.A., and she was one of the first big stars to make knitting into a cool hobby again, so she loves her simple pleasures (as well as dark dramas like The Handmaids Tale and Big Little Lies). And, she finally joined Instagram last June, but has kept her page a Finn-Hazel-and-Henry-free zone so far.\n\nHer latest movie son has made some appearances, though.\n\nWhile getting ready to play Lucas Hedges' mother in Ben Is Back, which was directed by Lucas' father, Peter Hedges, she had the young actor over for Thanksgiving to really immerse themselves in a family vibe.\n\n\"I felt she was very generous,\" Hedges told Newsweek in December. \"I experienced her as a mother and the thing I keep coming back to is, what makes her such a great actress, is how rooted she is in her role as a mother in her own life.\"\n\nHedges couldn't be more right about that."
