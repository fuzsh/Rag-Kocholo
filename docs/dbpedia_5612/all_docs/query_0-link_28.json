        "text": "By the time she made Mystic Pizza, in 1988, he had already directed 10 films and was busy making Working Girl and Biloxi Blues. Since they met, nine years ago, they have become the closest of friends. Mike Nichols directed Julia Roberts in Closer in 2004 and, three years later, in Charlie Wilson’s War. Now they’re talking about doing Shakespeare in the Park together.\n\nThe first thing I heard was laughter from unheard jokes—it was her laugh, the same one that we fell in love with when Richard Gere suddenly snapped the jewelry box shut on her in Pretty Woman. It’s a shame you can’t hear it in this conversation between Mike Nichols and Julia Roberts, held on one of those gray, shapeless days in Manhattan when you realize that summer is truly over. “I’m Julia,” she says, introducing herself in the middle of Nichols’s living room, offering her hand, a Hindu prayer bracelet circling her slender wrist.\n\nThere has been no one like her for quite a while now. Too much has changed—in her life and in ours—since she first dazzled us in her early, insouciant films. But to see her on-screen now is to experience that same simple joy all over again. One never tires of it, like seeing a shooting star: where did that come from? You are grateful to simply have seen it at all. And if you are lucky enough to make her laugh, which Nichols does effortlessly, her voluptuous mouth breaks into a radiant grin. No wonder he seems so taken with her, so obviously delighting in her company—and, for that matter, she in his. No wonder she feels confident enough to play the Evil Queen in Mirror Mirror, coming out this spring. This is not Walt Disney’s Snow White, but a witty, swashbuckling adaptation by the Indian director Tarsem Singh, whom Julia calls “a mad, lovable genius.” Tarsem describes the movie as “more like Gaudí meets the Brothers Grimm, with turn-of-the-century Russian filmmakers like Sergei Eisenstein thrown in.” She didn’t want to take on the role at first, until she learned that the movie would be directed by Tarsem. (She and her husband, Danny Moder, loved his 2006 fantasy adventure film, The Fall.) She told her agent to “make a lunch. I’m a crazy Tarsem fan.” As far as Tarsem was concerned, the Evil Queen was the first character he was interested in casting. “I knew that it would dictate the tone and age of everyone else. I was only interested in Julia.”\n\nJulia has always been lucky in her directors. Enter Mike Nichols, “one of the great artists of the 20th century,” as actor Philip Seymour Hoffman said recently. Hoffman appeared with Julia and Tom Hanks in Charlie Wilson’s War and will wrestle with the daunting role of Willy Loman in Nichols’s 2012 Broadway production of Death of a Salesman. But that’s just how many of America’s leading actors and directors feel about Nichols. For Steven Soderbergh, who directed Julia in her Academy Award-winning performance in Erin Brockovich, in 2000, Nichols is both hero and teacher. And when Natalie Portman accepted her Academy Award for Black Swan last year, she reserved a tender thank-you for Nichols, who had directed her in Closer. When Angels in America was filmed for HBO, in 2003, playwright Tony Kushner turned to Nichols as the one person who could steer such a grand ship safely into port. Indeed, images from Mike Nichols’s films are now a part of our cultural DNA—Mrs. Robinson’s seduction of Benjamin in The Graduate; George and Martha’s night of fun and games in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?; Alan Arkin peeling back the bombardier’s jacket in Catch-22; Shirley MacLaine crossing her legs atop a piano in Postcards from the Edge; a furious Sigourney Weaver brandishing her crutches in Working Girl.\n\nOne hopes Nichols and Roberts will make other films together. Like Katharine Hepburn and George Cukor, who collaborated on eight feature films, among them The Philadelphia Story, Adam’s Rib, and Pat and Mike, they seem to bring out the best in each other. Meanwhile, think of this as a little one-act play, starring Julia Roberts and Mike Nichols. Call it:\n\nJULIA & MIKE:\n\nA FAIRY TALE BASED ON REAL LIFE.\n\n[The scene: a Manhattan apartment just before lunch.]\n\nVANITY FAIR: I hope you don’t mind that I brought this by.\n\n[V.F. shows them a 1961 Smirnoff advertisement featuring a boyish Mike with his former comedy partner, Elaine May.]\n\nMIKE: No, I’m thrilled—are you kidding? I think this is Avedon.\n\nJULIA: [Looking at photograph] You’ve changed so little, Mike, it’s amazing!\n\n[Laughter.]\n\nV.F.: So, how would you like to do this?\n\nJULIA: Give us topics … It can be like Password.\n\nMIKE: So, why are we in the pages of Vanity Fair? Is it that Julia has a movie coming out?\n\nV.F.: It’s a conversation between the two of you. I’m just here to provoke you into talking.\n\nJULIA: Provoke us. We love to be provoked.\n\nV.F.: A lot of my questions will be inane.\n\nMIKE: We can match that.\n\nJULIA: Yes!\n\nV.F.: I want to know how you came into each other’s lives. Was it for Closer?\n\nJULIA: It was. I owe it all to Cate Blanchett.\n\nV.F.: How so?\n\nMIKE: She got pregnant.\n\nJULIA: She had been cast in Closer and got pregnant and then couldn’t be in it. So I owe a great debt to her.\n\nMIKE: Cate Blanchett said she had done a picture when she was pregnant, and she just wore a corset. The more I thought about it, the more I thought, Well, I don’t think that could work for Closer, since it’s all about sex. And somehow a corset that you can’t remove is not a big turn-on. [To Julia] I hadn’t dreamed that you would consider it, because there were four equal roles in the movie, and I didn’t know you were willing to be part of a group thing. That was very exciting for me. But I didn’t yet know about your modesty …\n\nJULIA: I am a human corset. I think Mike just had such a great understanding of the four of us [Julia, Jude Law, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman] as people and how we related to each other.\n\nV.F.: That was a good foursome.\n\nMIKE: It really worked. Everybody was there for everybody else. Everybody was so inventive and true. It’s funny, because I made another movie long before about sex, Carnal Knowledge—also four people. But one of them had never really acted, Art Garfunkel, and the other three [Jack Nicholson, Candice Bergen, and Ann-Margret] were at the very beginning of their careers. I mean, Ann-Margret wasn’t, but she wasn’t primarily an actress at that point. Closer felt like a great string quartet of soloists. It’s what it was in a way. Everybody knew exactly what they were doing and what they hoped to do.\n\nJULIA: That’s what it felt like—we were frighteningly in tune. I think what I liked the most about working with Mike and being friends with Mike is that he’s the most plainspoken and the most encouraging person I’ve ever met in my life. Those two things are like milk and honey to me. I think back on that movie so fondly. I remember the night that movie premiered because I was in the hospital on bed rest, pregnant as a house, and Mike came to see me on the way to the big premiere. It was so sweet.\n\nMIKE: I remember you in bed, proudly showing your belly …\n\nJULIA: Hard to hide it!\n\nV.F.: When you’re working with someone, did you screen a lot of each other’s films? Would you do that for an actress, Mike?\n\nMIKE: I had seen pretty much everything of Julia’s, because I was shocked seeing her in Mystic Pizza.\n\nJULIA: O.K., let’s just stop there for a second—isn’t it funny just to think of Mike Nichols watching Mystic Pizza? Isn’t that … it’s so cute!\n\nV.F.: It’s pretty great.\n\nMIKE: I got very excited, because here was this amazing presence. You weren’t young or not young; it had nothing to do with age. The character was all about starting out. But you seemed like you’d always been there.\n\nI don’t know whether you ever found it hard or easy, Julia, because all the machinery is invisible. It’s a thing of yours in life too. I don’t know whether you work out. I don’t know how you got your shape back in what seemed to be 10 minutes [after her twins were born]. I don’t know any of the troubles in your life, because you never talked about them or referred to them, if there were any. What do you call that?\n\nJULIA: Being southern?\n\nMIKE: I’m married to someone [Diane Sawyer] a little bit like you, in that the technique, the machinery of both the person and the work, is not only never discussed, it’s never even considered—it’s so personal that it doesn’t seem to exist. I think that goes with what I saw in the first shot of Mystic Pizza—it looks like life; it is life.\n\nJULIA: Well, you know what? I think there’s something that Diane has that Danny has, which is this incredibly deep, deep interest in everyone else. It’s kind of a learned thing …\n\nV.F.: Isn’t that just good manners?\n\nJULIA: The manners that I was brought up with—and this doesn’t work well when doing press at a young age—is when someone asks you a question, you answer it. Then you wait to be asked another question. It’s not very conversational; it doesn’t show a great interest in the other person. You’re kind of cutting yourself off from a whole world of other people’s opinions. Diane and Danny both have that art of true interest in other people, other situations, other ideas. I’ve learned a lot about that artfulness from both of them.\n\nMIKE: One of the things that fascinates me about Diane, who goes all over the world all the time—she’s in Afghanistan, she’s in Iraq, she’s everywhere and then back in a day and a half—is that no one ever asks her about what she saw.\n\nJULIA: But Diane has the most interesting stuff to tell you about anything!\n\nMIKE: People, by and large, would rather be talking than listening.\n\nJULIA: You’re a great listener, though, and you have the best stories.\n\nMIKE: That’s the other thing about Julia … We had one scene where, in Closer, we did about 10 or 12 takes because it was technically complicated, the moves for the camera … and she’d blush at the same point every time we did it—now that’s beyond technique.\n\nV.F.: When you were playing Joanne Herring in Charlie Wilson’s War, did you talk to Mike about your character? Marlon Brando actually wrote out little autobiographies of his characters’ lives up until the movie starts, so he had a sense of who that person was.\n\nJULIA: Oh, to have that kind of time! When we did Charlie Wilson’s War [in 2007], obviously we had the book, and we had Joanne as a resource. She’s such a very strong, visual person. Her personality is very clear and distinct; I think that I caught on to it pretty quickly, and it just required a lot of makeup and great hair.\n\nMike brings you into these wonderful environments. I would rather work in an ensemble. To have been with Clive, Jude, and Natalie—dear, sweet Natalie—and then go off to Morocco with Tom [Hanks] and Philip [Seymour Hoffman]. These are great opportunities; the quality of your life just increases immensely when you hitch your wagon to Mike, because he’s always going to be someplace that’s creative and filled with interesting people.\n\nV.F.: I want to ask you both about the idea of the fairy tale, and not just because of Julia’s new movie, Mirror Mirror, but a lot of your films are fairy tales. Pretty Woman is a fairy tale. And there’s probably a Ph.D. thesis out there on how The Graduate is a fairy tale, with Mrs. Robinson as the evil queen.\n\nMIKE: It’s so funny you say that, because I was just telling Julia that it took me 30 or 35 years to realize that The Graduate is a major myth—it’s Phaedra and Hippolytus.\n\nVery often when a story really holds us, it gets pushed away because it’s too close for comfort. Over and over, this story keeps getting told—older woman, younger guy. Who does that remind us of? And you tell the story, then it gets pushed away, then it comes back again in another form. You keep telling the same stories. I made Cinderella twice, with Working Girl and Annie.\n\nThe sacred, the central myths are always going to hold us.\n\nV.F.: Metamorphosis, transformation: that’s what holds us, I think, in every story.\n\nMIKE: To become something better, to be less unhappy. But it’s mostly a fantasy. It’s the hardest thing on earth to like yourself, and then when you do, it’s a catastrophe. I mean, the people I know who like themselves—I don’t want to see them!\n\nV.F.: They’re insufferable.\n\nJULIA: Worse than insufferable. They’re boring.\n\nV.F.: Julia, do you see your life as a fairy tale?\n\nJULIA: I think I’m more in control of it than that—my confidence and drive to do the work that I love, and to believe that I can do it. I don’t think it’s magic dust that made Mike Nichols appear and made Danny Moder appear. I think that I am a deeply optimistic person. I’m a hopeful person. I mean, that’s sort of the cornerstone of fairy tales. But now I read fairy tales to my children, and there’s a lot of parental editing that goes on when you have the Brothers Grimm in your hand and it’s seven P.M.\n\nV.F.: Your amazing career reads like a fairy tale.\n\nJULIA: Well, it’s funny. We were talking about Mystic Pizza earlier, and I’m sitting here thinking to myself, It’s too bad that young actors coming up now will never get that kind of experience. The business is so different; you can never be that new girl that has that moment of “Where’d she come from?” Those gradual steps that you get to take …\n\nV.F.: There are no steps anymore?\n\nJULIA: No. There’s the express elevator and there’s rehab.\n\nV.F.: So there’s nothing in between?\n\nJULIA: It’s so awful; nobody gets a fair trial-and-error period that everybody deserves and everybody needs. I was lucky that I made a few movies in a row that people really responded to—not me particularly but the films as a whole were appreciated. Then you have a couple that aren’t when you think they’re going to be, and that’s O.K. You can keep going. People can keep hiring you. But that doesn’t happen now, and it’s a pity because it is a way to develop yourself and figure out what kind of actor you are.\n\nV.F.: We were talking earlier about Garry Marshall, who directed you in Pretty Woman, your breakout film.\n\nJULIA: In essence, I owe my career to Garry Marshall. There was no known reason for him to hire me for Pretty Woman. And even he was puzzled by his decision. He’d say, “I don’t understand Some people say they can’t dress you up; some people say they can’t dress you down. I don’t understand you.” But I really owe the forward motion of my career to Alan Pakula—\n\nV.F.: Who directed you in The Pelican Brief—\n\nJULIA: —because I worked for almost two years and just didn’t like things, wasn’t connecting to things that were offered to me. It was really at a time when I was encouraged—as all young actresses are—you know, “You’ve got to keep going; you’ve got to get out there, people are interested.” I was only 24 or 25.\n\nMIKE: Alan was a sweet guy.\n\nJULIA: I just didn’t have it in me, to move. It wasn’t until I met Alan, and he had written the screenplay for Pelican Brief. We had a really interesting conversation about it, and I was really interested in that material, and I went back to work. It kind of re-ignited my enthusiasm for acting and participating in that circus.\n\nMIKE: I still think that luck is what a lot of the good things come from. It’s simply the luck of where you are, when.\n\nJULIA: Hmmmm …\n\nMIKE: The first movie I ever did had something to do with luck. I had done a lot of plays, I had a lot of hits on Broadway—but I signed to do a movie based on The Public Eye and The Private Ear. They were two one-act plays by Peter Shaffer that were very funny, very good. I was in L.A. for something Elaine [May] and I were doing, and I met with Ross Hunter, who was producing the movie. So I said, “How are you?” He said, “I’m not happy. Last night I went to see Doris Day’s new movie—not for me, I can assure you. I was offended by the movie.” I asked him, “In what way?”\n\nHe said, “Well, as a producer I was offended. I just wanted to rush up to the screen and rip every bow off her dress.” I thought, I can’t do this. I called my agent and said, “You’ve got to get me out; I can’t direct this movie. I love Peter [Shaffer], but I can’t talk to Ross Hunter. We don’t see things the same way.”\n\nThen I read that Warner Bros. had bought Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and they wanted Elizabeth [Taylor] to play Martha. She and I had the same publicity guy, John Springer, so I said, “Tell Elizabeth I should direct that movie.” He did, and she said, “You’re right, he should.”\n\nV.F.: Virginia Woolf and The Graduate put you on the map, big-time! [The former was nominated in every eligible category and won five Academy Awards, including Elizabeth Taylor’s second Oscar for best actress.]\n\nMIKE: Where is anything but luck in that? I was lucky that Ross Hunter revealed himself to me in our very first exchange. And I was lucky that I got to meet Elizabeth.\n\nJULIA: It’s so funny; people have really strong opinions about luck.\n\nMIKE: I can’t speak for anybody else, but I do believe in luck …\n\nJULIA: I do, too—luck and good friends, just believing in all the little daily things that sometimes go unobserved. They all add up to that moment of being right where you’re supposed to be.\n\nV.F.: Julia, do you think you would have become an actor if you didn’t grow up in a theatrical family?\n\nJULIA: I don’t think I would have. I wouldn’t have seen it as a real option if my parents weren’t actors and my siblings … It just wouldn’t have occurred to me. [Her parents, Betty Lou and Walter Roberts, founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop, and her older brother, Eric Roberts, made his film debut in King of the Gypsies, in 1978.]\n\nMIKE: That’s interesting, because I would have said if I hadn’t happened to live in New York and had a girlfriend whose mother got us theater tickets for the second night of A Streetcar Named Desire I wouldn’t have been drawn to the theater. That’s another type of luck, that you are exposed to something that takes. When it was over, we never got up. We were two 15-year-old kids, stunned. Two long intermissions, three long acts—we never moved.\n\nJULIA: Going to the theater is such a joyous experience. My dad would take my sister and me to plays when we were very young, like six or seven years old. We saw Hair in New York on summer vacation. We would go see Yul Brynner do The King and I in Atlanta. It was phenomenal to be exposed to these kinds of things, because there’s nothing else like the experience of seeing a play.\n\nMIKE: I feel the same way. Seeing a story on the stage—and when you see something great, you feel so connected to the people sitting next to you.\n\nJULIA: I did Three Days of Rain [her Broadway debut] because I remember how strongly I felt about my dad taking us to see plays.\n\nV.F.: I always wondered if actors feel the way writers sometimes feel when they haven’t written in a while—this fear of shutting down. What they call writer’s block, for lack of a better word.\n\nJULIA: I think all creative people feel that way.\n\nMIKE: Yes.\n\nJULIA: I’ve certainly felt that way. Every first day of any job, you’re getting ready and you think, I hope it’s in there. I hope it comes out when it’s supposed to. You have to feel that way; you have to be nervous.\n\nMIKE: It’s not something you can count on, by definition. I do think people go through cycles. The people I’ve admired most have gone through cycles, lost themselves briefly, usually in the middle, and then they’d found a way to keep generating it. I think it’s like Dante’s Inferno—you do find yourself in a dark wood one way or another. And then you get stronger after that. It’s such a fleeting and mysterious thing.\n\nV.F.: Julia, would you go back to the stage?\n\nJULIA: Absolutely. I would really like to do that. I had a great time doing Three Days of Rain—but I could definitely find ways to have more fun because now I have a much better sense of what I’m getting into. I mean, when we did Three Days of Rain, I had two little children and was doing eight shows a week. There was a relentlessness to it that you can’t understand if you haven’t been in that situation.\n\nMIKE: It’s true.\n\nJULIA: It’s like childbirth: you don’t know until you’ve done it, but you get a little bit away from it and you go, “Of course, I want to do that again.” You get sucked back into doing theater, because it’s really thrilling, and it does challenge you as an actor in really unique ways. You know, I love the medium of film; I love that environment, but it’s just different.\n\nMIKE: But theater is harder and harder these days, because plays now are more like fragments; structured plays are getting shorter and shorter—the audience’s patience is getting shorter and shorter.\n\nV.F.: In a perfect world, if you were to put Julia into one of the great roles, what would it be?\n\nMIKE: It’s funny you ask that, because we were just talking about Shakespeare in the Park today. If we could do either Taming of the Shrew or Much Ado About Nothing—they’re plays that take care of you.\n\nJULIA: To have fun and be in the park! That would be a dream of mine. Seeing Shakespeare in the Park, for me, it’s just this side of feeling like you’ve witnessed some kind of magic. It’s this spell that you’re under, to be part of that!\n\nV.F.: [To Julia] Do you let the idea of movie stardom reach you on any level? Is it a cosmic riddle you’ve been given to solve?\n\nJULIA: Well, it’s not a riddle, but it’s a manufactured, external element. I don’t think it’s personal. I don’t think it’s really clearly defined. And it’s funny; some people think of it as very valuable. Some people think of it as something very useful to be called a movie star. For me, it’s just insignificant.\n\nMIKE: Can I tell him about you and the kids at the zoo?\n\nJULIA: I don’t know; tell him, and then I’ll say if it’s all right.\n\nMIKE: You told me that you had the kids at the Central Park Zoo. You were looking at the monkeys or the seals, or whatever you were looking at, and a woman came up to you and said, in a quiet voice, “Aren’t you Julia Roberts?” And you said, “Yes, but my kids don’t know—will you help me?”\n\nJULIA: It’s interesting being in a business like this with three little children, helping them navigate the waters of what gets manufactured about you. You really have no sizable control over it. It’s definitely been educational and interesting. And so far, so good.\n\n[Danny Moder returns from his afternoon at the Guggenheim, his camera slung around his neck.]\n\nDanny, what was it that Finn [one of their three children] said that time we were in Toronto? It was on a crowded street, and somebody noticed me, and then another person noticed. Somebody said as we were walking past, “Oh, that’s Julia Roberts.” We all just kind of kept going, and then Finn said, “Yeah, my mom’s Julia Robinson.” That’s what gives you perspective. It could be Robinson, it could be Johnson, because it has nothing to do with me as a person.\n\nDANNY: One of my favorite stories was when I visited Julia on set with Finn. Where were you shooting? Brooklyn? And I said, “We’re going to take the subway back and go over the Manhattan Bridge.” That would be cool: his first subway experience. So we do it, and the bridge is beautiful and you go back in the tunnel. And we get off the subway at Union Square and I throw him over my shoulder because he’s like four …\n\nJULIA: We were doing Eat Pray Love, so, yeah, he was four.\n\nDANNY: So we get off, and suddenly there are thousands of people. And Finn was looking around, and he says, “Daddy, no one knows who we are.”\n\nJULIA: To go from being on a soundstage, where everybody is looking after you, to nobody noticing. That’s kind of a great thing.\n\nDANNY: We don’t coddle them …\n\nJULIA: When we were filming Larry Crowne, I was playing a schoolteacher, and one of my students was the very lovely Grace Gummer, Meryl Streep’s daughter. One day all the kids came to visit, and we’re hanging around, getting some snacks. Later on, as they’re leaving, Grace comes up and goes, “Gosh, it’s so sweet seeing all your kids on the set. It reminds me of when I was little, and I would go see my mom at work.” I asked, “Were you happy?” Suddenly, I thought, here is a source of information. I said, “How old were you when you realized your mom was Meryl Streep?” She said, “I think I was probably nine when I put that all together.” I said, “Were you cool with it?” She said, “Yeah, it was fine. There was no trauma.” So that was hopeful.\n\nYou know, my father died when I was nine years old. Mike, I am so beholden to our relationship. You really are a father to me, and I’m so grateful to be in your love and good care all these years.\n\nV.F.: Finally, do you love the work the way you did when you started?\n\nJULIA: Probably more, because I think I’m just more knowledgeable about what I’m trying to accomplish. Yes. I do.\n\nV.F.: And you, Mike?\n\nMIKE: Yes, I do, too.\n\nV.F.: I now pronounce you man and wife.\n\n[Laughter.]\n\nJULIA: We have to get ourselves to the airport. We promised the kids we’d be home for supper.\n\n[Mike walks them to the elevator. Julia hugs Mike and kisses him good-bye as the elevator arrives. The elevator door opens and she and Danny exit.]\n\nJULIA: [To Mike] I love you.\n\n[Mike blows her a kiss as the elevator door closes, and they’re gone.]\n\nThe End"
