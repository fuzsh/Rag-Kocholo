        "text": "For teenagers, the combination of immaturity and inexperience makes driving especially risky. If they’re going to drive, choosing a safe vehicle is key. In addition to safety, reliability and affordability are also top concerns for families.\n\nIIHS and Consumer Reports (CR) have joined forces to make it easier for young drivers or their parents to find a vehicle that checks all those boxes.\n\nYoung driver safety\n\nAn IIHS-HLDI guide for parents of teens\n\nOur recommendations include two tiers of used vehicles, Best Choices and slightly more affordable Good Choices. Starting prices for recommended used models range from under $6,000 to nearly $20,000. A separate list of new vehicles for teens offers an even higher level of safety.\n\nRead the news release about our May 2024 update.\n\nRemember to check for recalls!\n\nUse the vehicle identification number or license plate to check for outstanding recalls before buying a used vehicle. To receive future recall notices, notify the manufacturer of your purchase. NHTSA also advises vehicle owners to check its database for new recalls every six months or so.\n\nBest Choices — used\n\nUpdated May 22, 2024\n\nAll listed vehicles have a curb weight greater than 2,750 pounds and earn good ratings from IIHS in the original moderate overlap front, original side, roof strength and head restraint tests, as well as an acceptable or good rating in the driver-side small overlap test. If rated by NHTSA, they earn 4 or 5 stars overall. In addition, Best Choice vehicles have standard automatic emergency braking systems that earn an advanced or superior rating from IIHS in the original vehicle-to-vehicle front crash prevention test.\n\nAll recommended vehicles have above-average reliability scores from CR (4 or 5 out of 5) for the majority of model years listed and CR emergency handling scores greater than or equal to 3 out of 5. They also have dry braking distances (going from 60 mph to zero) of 145 feet or less.\n\nPrices, provided by Kelley Blue Book and rounded to the nearest $100, are average U.S. values from April 19, 2024, for the lowest trim level and earliest applicable model year. The estimates are based on the following criteria: vehicle in good condition, typical mileage and private party purchase.\n\nSmall cars Model years Price Toyota Corolla sedan or hatchback Sedan — 2017 or newer; hatchback — 2019 $10,600 Toyota Prius 2017 or newer $13,800 Mazda 3 sedan or hatchback 2021-22 $16,400 Toyota Prius Prime 2017 or newer $17,000 Honda Civic sedan or hatchback 2021 or newer $17,600 Midsize cars Model years Price Toyota Camry 2018 or newer $9,600 Volvo S60 2017, 2021 $10,200 Volvo V60 2017,2021 $12,300 Subaru Legacy 2019 $14,700 Hyundai Sonata 2021 $17,200 Honda Accord sedan 2020 $19,200 Large car Model years Price Toyota Avalon 2017 or newer $14,400 Small SUVs Model years Price Chevrolet Equinox 2020, 2023 $13,800 Kia Sportage 2020 or newer $14,400 Toyota RAV4 2017 or newer $14,700 Hyundai Tucson 2020 or newer $14,900 Mazda CX-5 2021-23 $17,600 Lexus UX 2019-21 $18,100 Honda CR-V 2020 or newer $18,700 Nissan Rogue 2021 $19,000 Subaru Forester 2021 or newer $19,000 Mazda CX-30 2022 or newer $19,900 Midsize SUVs Model years Price Volvo XC60 2017 $12,100 Hyundai Santa Fe 2019, 2020, 2023 $15,200 Toyota Highlander 2017 or newer $15,700 Nissan Murano 2019, 2020 $15,900 GMC Terrain 2020, 2023 $16,100 Ford Edge 2020 or newer $16,700 Lexus NX 2018-21 $17,100 Infiniti QX60 2019 $17,800 Mazda CX-9 2020, 2022 $18,800 Minivan Model years Price Toyota Sienna 2018-20 $19,100\n\nGood Choices — used\n\nUpdated May 22, 2024\n\nAll listed vehicles have a curb weight greater than 2,750 pounds and earn good ratings from IIHS in the original moderate overlap front, original side, roof strength and head restraint tests, as well as an acceptable or good rating in the driver-side small overlap test.
