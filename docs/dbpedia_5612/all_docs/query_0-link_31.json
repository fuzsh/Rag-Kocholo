        "text": "So many truths in one article; importance of diverse senior representation; lack of understanding from public sector of the impact and value of the VCS, and the fact that many VCS are needing subsidise contracts; lack on consideration about the full impact of the short-term nature of commissioning; the continued willingness of commissioners to allow contracts to run to the wire year after year before confirming if funding will continue, leading funded staff to have anxiety about their jobs, ultimately leading to charities losing dedicated staff who are forced to make difficult decisions to find financial security elsewhere destabilising service provision; and so much more. As we continue to transform the health and care system, we need really need to address these realities which are causing harm to charities, and the people who rely on their services. These are often relational and severely impacted by enforced/unneccasy staff turnover if a longer term, and more sustainable approach was adopted.\n\nHome is a great place to be. It's a place that is hard to replicate and a feeling that emulates belonging, hopefully for the majority of us. I've created a new blog entry, this time on a different type of homecoming: coming home to my Maxwell Leadership family. To all of my new Maxwell Family, comment below if you can pinpoint what made you feel a Sense of Belonging, whether this year at IMC or a past event. #leaderslead #maxwellleadership\n\nLast week Candid released the largest demographic study of the nonprofit sector, which demonstrates that while the sector is diverse, \"diversity dwindles in larger organizations as well as at higher leadership levels.\" The state of diversity in the U.S. nonprofit sector report provides some key takeaways that the sector should be questioning. ✔ Majority BIPOC-led organizations have fewer financial resources. ✔ White majority leadership models are predominant among larger organizations. ✔ Smaller organizations tend to have smaller, more racially diverse boards. ✔ People are less likely to share demographic information about sensitive identities. ✔ The U.S. nonprofit sector is less diverse across all demographic categories at more senior levels of leadership. #diversitymatters #nonprofitleadership\n\n#diversityandinclusion #equity #dei #fraud I am beginning to wonder if this Diversity-Equity-Inclusion campaign is a sham perpetrated by #wokes A must read post by @BillAckman in X. Imagine the following: You're a man who serves as Chairman of the Board of a large University who led the search for the recently hired president. Your wife runs a non-profit in the DEI space. She is the only full-time employee of the organization, serving as Founder, CEO, and CFO. You serve as Treasurer. The non-profit ostensibly sells two principal products in the DEI space: 1. \"Evidence-based 'how-to-guides' and 2. \"The most comprehensive intersectional analytics platform of its kind...\" but the non-profit has no revenues. It relies entirely on contributions to fund its operations, which principally consist of your wife's salary and some other ancillary overhead. There have been only two contributors to the non-profit, the University whose board you chair, which has contributed: 2018 $100,000 2019 $300,000 2020 $150,000 2021 $600,000 2022 $789,000 and a donor advised fund (DAF) affiliated with you which has contributed: 2018 $0 2019 $0 2020 $0 2021 $10,000 2022 $20,000 Doesn't this seem very strange? What if the University was @MIT ? What if the Chairman was Mark Gorenberg? What if the non-profit is http://parity.org? Why are there so many conflicts/scandals concerning DEI organizations? All of the above can be found in MIT's and http://Parity.Org's IRS Form 990s which are available and summarized here: https://lnkd.in/dTPC6CjE\n\nTHIS RIGHT HERE. Hiring leaders of color is only a step. There is much more to do to ensure real impact & success, applicable to both nonprofits and org making Social Impact (and, really probably, everybody!) This is such a great read - thanks for sharing María Amparo Fernández! \"...many nonprofits have made moves to increase leadership diversity, which is good. However, when these changes are rooted in racist, performative, and voyeuristic values instead of community, membership, and leadership change management, nonprofits fail to fully achieve the true, transformative, and restorative impact that such a leadership transition could bring. All the while, the social fabric that undergirds our country—red or blue state, for-profit or nonprofit—remains significantly harder for POCs. We must do better.\" https://lnkd.in/ggp5t96j\n\nDistributed leadership is a keystone principle at Modern Widows Club nonprofit. When the entire team is valued, kind, safe, respected and ideas seen as worthy to benefit the whole in results - this translates to equal ownership in mission. Our MWC HQ team is coast to coast- Lyn Kienholz, CHSP, CRME #Minneapolis, Laurie Rich, MCLC #Sacramento, Cindy Toledo #Seattle and me in #Orlando. We lead a large community of thrivers - #widows/ #widowleaders/ #widowadvocates internationally on a small scale budget. Without distributed leadership and a trust in each others talents and insights, we couldn’t have accomplished what we have in 12 yrs!! Revolutionizing #widowhood is a team effort and our team is great because we are all leaders in this movement to better serve todays and tomorrows widow leaders. Trailblazing is more fun (and healthy) when you go together!! #leadership #modernwidowsclub #impact #widowsupport #teamdevelopment #infrastructure #collaboration #goalgetters #mindsetmastery #charityjobs #nonprofitleadership #nonprofitorganization #distributedleadership #network https://lnkd.in/eesWXr4w"
