        "text": "🏆 The World Cup journey was a rollercoaster of emotions for the England team, that's why it's vital to emphasise the importance of Performance Decompression. The emotional impact can be significant after major competitions, so to assist in processing these emotions, I've been trained to deliver the UK Sports Institute Performance Decompression programme to The Rugby Players Association members. Performance Decompression allows those directly involved at the World Cup to make sense of their experiences, avoid maladaptive emotional responses, and reset for the next challenge. 🔄 Time Zero is the starting point. This phase focuses on restorative care, encouraging individuals to live in the moment, embrace their emotions and connect with loved ones. In future posts i'll delve deeper into the other phases of the Performance Decompression programme. #PerformanceDecompression #Wellbeing\n\n📸 Capturing Moments of Growth 🌱 With our workshop 𝐃𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐛𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐠𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 We are thrilled to share this memorable moment with our dedicated referees from the Arubaanse Voetbal Bond - AVB 🙌 🧠 𝑈𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛 𝐵𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑟 💡 During our recent workshop, we delved into the complexities of human behavior, explored the art of change, and discussed ways to enhance our Quality of Life. One of the highlights was learning about a regulating technique, a valuable tool in our repertoire. 👥 𝐵𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑆𝑘𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠 🤝 This event was not about rules on the field; it was about building a deeper understanding of ourselves and the individuals we encounter. Exploring ways to keep ourselves within our window of control and maintain outside factors or “nasty pots” from reaching in. As referees are not just guardians of the game, but also champions of sportsmanship and their well-being. 💪 𝘌𝘮𝘱𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘖𝘶𝘳 𝘙𝘦𝘧𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘦 𝘍𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘭𝘺 🏁 We are now better equipped to handle the diverse situations we may encounter. Together, we are united in our commitment to enhancing our mental health on and off the field! Expressing gratitude to Sharline Monique Ras, Head of Refereeing AVB, for her trust in Psyched. 📣 𝘓𝘦𝘵'𝘴 𝘒𝘦𝘦𝘱 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘎𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘨 💬 Share your thoughts on how we as a community can improve in order to create a safer and friendlier environment during the biggest, most unifying sport in the world ⚽️ #referee #understandingbehavior #qualityoflife #emdr #arubaansevoetbalbond #mentalhealthawarenessmonth\n\nThe risk of Concussion in contact sports has been hot in the press recently Sensational claims by a group of researchers has seen them call for rugby in schools and clubs to be banned for under-18s as it is “a form of child abuse”. Their argument, published in The Times is that the risk of brain injuries from high-impact sports – including rugby and boxing – runs counter to child abuse laws. This is an extreme statement that lacks balance. An excellent podcast from science of sport podcast provides balance to the argument - in that waiting until age 18 to introduce contact in rugby may pose a greater risk. They point out that World Rugby’s recent Otago study found under-13 rugby to be less dangerous than higher age groups and the adult game. Therefore refining your tackling and contact skills at a younger age may be considered lower risk for concussion than when older and more powerful. Aside from the technical aspects of the game, the cardiovascular, general health and social benefits of rugby may well outweigh the potential risks. Issues such as inactivity and obesity, along with antisocial beviour may carry a different set of health risks. High profile players on the Netflix six nations documentary speak openly about the positive effects rugby has had on their lives and how their social direction may have been very different. Credit to them for being so candid and acknowledging the positive impact rugby can have on young peoples lives. Ban rugby and boxing where do you stop? And how may this impact on the future of young people?

The inaugural event in 2023 occurred as the curtain raiser to Melbourne Victory’s ANZAC round fixture against Macarthur FC. The event held at Gosch’s paddock consisted of training clinics and engaging activities, concluding with a 5v5 round robin all abilities tournament. This year, the event has increased in capacity. Two sessions for different age ranges will commence. From 3:15pm to 3:45pm, children aged between 4 to 12 will have their session, with the older contingent aged from 13 to 18 to participate in their session from 4:00pm to 4:30pm. Upon declaring their involvement for the event, all participants are offered a free ticket to attend the round 25 A-League Men’s fixture, where Victory will host Brisbane Roar at AAMI Park. TAC have been one of Victory's key sponsors since their inception in 2005 with the partnership nearing its 20th anniversary that is scheduled for next year. Inclusivity within society has become a point of focus for sporting codes across the globe - none more so than football. Members of society who face the difficulties of having special needs should have an engaging outlet. This allows for those to have a joyful and fulfilling, outdoor experience. Amongst other codes of football, the globally renowned variation tends to be far simpler and palatable, especially in terms of building skills and understanding general rules. Therefore, parents and guardians of those who have a disability may lean towards electing soccer as the sport that their kids can participate in, aware of the unique subtlety and non-aggressiveness that surrounds it when in comparison to the likes of Australian Rules football or rugby. The community event hosted by Victory simultaneously contributes to the community across Melbourne, while also increasing participation and appreciation for the sport of football within a state where it remains down in the pecking order of preferred sports.
