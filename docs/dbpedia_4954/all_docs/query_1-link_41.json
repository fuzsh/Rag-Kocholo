        "text": "Thomas,\n\nSorry for my delay. I wanted to test a few things before I replied.\n\nI checked both pages, and I don't see where anything is missing an ID. Here is what I have been able to confirm so far... I think the error is occurring because the dropdown listbox (which calls the JavaScript function that opens the new window) is within a tableView. I have tested by using the exact same JavaScript function on a button, and I do not receive the JavaScript error message. I also tested by creating a stand-alone dropdown listbox, outside of the tableView, and it also does not receive the error. But for some reason, when I call the JavaScript to open the new window from a dropdown listbox that it within a tableView, I do get the error.\n\nDoes this trigger anything in your memory? Like I said earlier, this error was not occurring before the upgrade to 6.40.\n\nThanks for any advice you can offer!\n\nShannon\n\nThomas,\n\nI have some more info (I think). I tested a few other things within the tableView cell instead of the dropdownlistbox. For example, I tried using a link and a button to call the JavaScript function. Both of those worked successfully without any kind of error. So the error does seem to be limited to the dropdownlistbox. Also, the error seems to be limited to the situation where the dropdownlistbox is within a tableView cell. As I mentioned in my last post, the error does not occur if I use the exact same logic for a dropdownlistbox that is outside of the tableView.\n\nI tried to see what may be causing the error. Now, I am not a JavaScript expert, so I warn you that these may be stupid and/or insignificant observations! But something interesting is that, even though I get the JavaScript error, it isn't actually preventing it from going back to WebAS. In fact, I put a break-point in my DO_HANDLE_EVENT, and I saw that immediately after selecting the hidden button on the page via JavaScript, it did go back to WebAS with the correct htmlb Event info. Everything is processing successfully on the backend. So, it is really just the annoyance of the message that I want to eliminate. The JavaScript error message is not actually preventing the backend logic from being successfully executed.\n\nNext, I looked at the generated code for my dropdownlistbox, and I saw that it has:\n\nonchange=\"htmlbEF('openwindow(\\'parameter\\')');return htmlbEventCO(this, 'select', 'htmlb:dropdownListBox:select:null', 'mainForm', 'controller_fieldID', '', 0);\"\n\n(I just put \"parameter\" and \"controller_fieldID\" here instead of the actual names that I am using, but you get the point.)\n\nSo, this made me wonder if the error is occurring within the htmlbEventCO JavaScript function, which seems to me to be filling the fields for the htmlbevent so that it can submit the event back to WebAS. However, I did not have any \"onSelect\" event specified for my dropdownlistbox. I was only using the \"onClientSelect\" because I only want to trigger a client-side JavaScript function when a change is made to the dropdownlistbox. But I thought I would experiment and see what happens when I use the onSelect instead. So, I replaced the onClientSelect with onSelect and specified a dummy Event name.\n\nWhen I tested again, I saw in debugger that it did successfully submit back to WebAS with my onSelect event. But, when the page tried to refresh, I got the JavaScript error again!!!! This means that the JavaScript error is happening, even if I don't use onClientSelect to call my JavaScript. Therefore, the error has NOTHING to do with me opening a separate window and clicking on a hidden button, etc. It seems that the error is being caused simply by using a dropdownlistbox within a tableView.\n\nI don't know what to do at this point! I don't think that I have done something within my BSP to cause this error, especially considering the fact that this error never occurred before the upgrade. Do you think I should submit a customer message on OSS about this? Or do you have any other suggestions for me to try?\n\nThanks again for your help!\n\nShannon"
