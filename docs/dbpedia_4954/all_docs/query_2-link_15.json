        "text": "World Rugby’s approval of eligibility law changes may bring substantial changes for Rugby World Cup 2023. Players are able to represent a second country following a three-year stand-down period from their last binding representative appearance for their first country. In other words, there are players from both RWC 2019 and / or RWC 2015 who could change country for RWC 2023.\n\n20 teams competed at RWC 2019 in Japan. Of them 17 selected players from other countries. At RWC 2015 in England and Wales only Argentina did not have players born abroad. Eligibility was obtained by meeting Regulation 8 as outlined by World Rugby. This required a player to (a) be born in the country; (b) have one parent or grandparent from the country; or (c) complete 3 years consecutive residency immediately before representative duty.\n\nRWC 2023 will have will two eligibility changes compared to RWCs 2019 and 2015; namely, residency and changing countries. Residency was supposed to be extended from three to five years at the end of 2020. Instead, the May 2017 decision to change Regulation 8 from a 36-month residency qualification period to 60 months began on January 1, 2022, one year later than originally intended.\n\nThe change was implemented not by World Rugby Council vote but by World Rugby’s Executive Committee. It should be noted that many Tier 1 nations had opportunities to cap players before the intended cut-off date of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe second change means players from previous RWCs can play for a different country as of January 01, 2022. As noted, doing so requires a three-year stand-down period from their last binding representative appearance.\n\nThis purpose of this article is to identify which players are entitled to make the change. It documents players from the past two RWCs who could play for a different country at RWC 2023. The past two RWCs are chosen due to the data being reliable and the lifespan of professional rugby players.\n\nSome countries have begun capturing players previously capped by rivals. What remains to be seen is how many will do so and the changes per country. It is also uncertain as to whether or not this will increase the number of Foreign-Born players when compared to past RWC tournaments. There were 129 Foreign-Born players at RWC 2015. The number increased to 144 for RWC 2019.\n\nBelow are all countries that competed at RWCs 2015 and / or 2019 in addition to the RWC 2023 competitors.\n\nThis is an original work researched and written by Americas Rugby News.\n\nRWC 2015 AND / OR 2019 COMPETITORS\n\nNEW ZEALAND (20)\n\nTwenty New Zealanders who played for teams other than the All Blacks can now play for the All Blacks at RWC 2023. Ten of them played for Samoa, four played for Tonga but zero played for Fiji. Indeed, some rugby media have Fiji erroneously considered together with Samoa and Tonga as a general Pacific Islanders category. Fiji’s Foreign-Born players have been very low compared to Samoa and Tonga at past RWCs. Similarly, the law modifications open plenty of possibilities for two but not all three.\n\nIt is very likely that All Blacks will play for other countries at RWC 2023. Indeed, Tonga fielded All Blacks in the July and November 2022 test matches and Rugby World Cup 2023 qualifiers. What is unclear is how many All Blacks will no longer swear allegiance to New Zealand. The new laws mean All Blacks now eligible for Samoa include John Afoa, Charles Faumuina, Josh Ioane, Steven Luatua, Ma’a Nonu, Francis Saili, Julian Savea, Lima Sopoaga and Jeffrey To’omaga-Allen. Chris Vui remains attached to Samoa.\n\nOn the flip side, New Zealand can now select Samoan-capped players who were born in New Zealand such as Brandon Nansen and Danny Tusitala. Scotland’s Phil Burleigh also qualifies as does Ireland’s Rodney Ah You. Jamie Henry and Derek Carpenter are former Japanese players from New Zealand.\n\nWallabies Christopher Feauai-Sautia, Christian Leali’iafano and Caleb Timu are also now eligible to play for New Zealand at RWC 2023. Former England players Ben Te’o and Brad Shields could also both play for the All Blacks in France 2023. Former England flanker Zach Mercer now also qualifies though his New Zealand father. Teimana Harrison and Ben Te’o qualify for New Zealand via birth. All these players could play for the All Blacks; none are expected to do so.\n\nSean Reidy qualified for Ireland via his grandfather. Reidy will not be eligible for the All Blacks for RWC 2023 nor will many others. Notable examples include Bundee Aki, Gareth Anscombe, Hame Faiva, Jamison Gibson-Park, Toa Halafihi, Willis Haloholo, James Lowe, Sean Maitland, Johnny McNicholl, Virimi Vakatawa and Mako Vunipola.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Ole Avei HO New Zealand Samoa NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 24 Manu Leiataua HO New Zealand Samoa NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 20 Motu Matu’u HO New Zealand Samoa NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 22 Anthony Perenise TH New Zealand Samoa NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 30 Paul Alo-Emile TH New Zealand Samoa NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 17 Kane Le’aupepe LO New Zealand Samoa NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 10 Sam Lousi LO New Zealand Tonga NZ Birth; Tonga Parent 8 Piula Fa’asalele FL New Zealand Samoa NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 21 Josh Tyrell FL New Zealand Samoa NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 11 Hendrick Tui N8 New Zealand Japan JP Residency; Sam Parent; NZ Birth 47 Willi Heinz SH New Zealand England NZ Birth; Eng Grandparent 13 Pele Cowley SH New Zealand Samoa NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 15 Nick Grigg FH New Zealand Scotland NZ Birth; Scot Grandparent 9 Christian Leali’ifano FH New Zealand Australia NZ Birth; AU Residency; Sam Parent 26 Otumaka Mausia CE New Zealand Tonga NZ Birth; Tonga Parent 1 Hadleigh Parkes CE New Zealand Wales NZ Birth; Wales Residency 29 Joe Tomane CE New Zealand Australia NZ Birth; AU Residency; Samoa Parent 17 Viliami Tahitu’a CE New Zealand Tonga NZ Birth; TO Parent 4 Viliami Lolohea WI New Zealand Tonga NZ Birth; TO Parent 12 Will Tupou FB New Zealand Japan NZ Birth; JP Residency 12\n\nSAMOA (9)\n\nSamoa may turn out to be the biggest winner of all. In terms of player production Samoa has benefitted more than any World Cup competitor from eligibility laws. Samoa had only 3 players born and developed on the islands at RWC 2019. This continues with those that Samoa can now cap; heritage rather than birth is the overwhelming factor.\n\nThe diaspora includes All Blacks John Afoa, Charles Faumuina, Josh Ioane, Steven Luatua, Ma’a Nonu, Francis Saili, Julian Savea, Lima Sopoaga and Jeffrey To’omaga-Allen; and Wallabies Peter Betham, Christopher Feauai-Sautia, Christian Leali’iafano, Joe Tomane and Caleb Timu. England-capped Denny Solomona and Ben Te’o also now eligible.\n\nSamoa named All Blacks Steven Luatua and Jeffrey To’omaga-Allen on their roster for the 2022 November Internationals. In exploiting the change in the eligibility laws the pair were able to debut for Samoa on the three match tour to Italy, Georgia and Romania. The former missed out through injury while the later debuted. The roster also included call-ups for Duncan Paia’aua and Tala Gray. Paia’aua scored 16 points for the Wallabies vs Barbarians in 2017 while Gray is a former Australian 7’s player.\n\nTiti Lamositele can now also play for Samoa. The gentle giant from Tacoma, Washington missed the USA’s test matches since RWC 2019, including RWC 2023 qualifiers. With the Eagles not qualifying, his involvement in the World Cup remains a possibility for Samoa via heritage. Christian Leali’ifano played for Australia vs Uruguay at RWC 2019. He can legally play against Argentina and Chile at RWC 2023 but for Samoa.\n\nIrish-capped Rodney Ah You is now eligible for Samoa as is New Zealand 7’s player Pita Akhi. Asafo Aumua, Caleb Clarke, Richie Mo’unga, Dalton Papalii, Ardie Savea, Angus Ta’avao, Patrick Tuipulotu, Jacob Umaga and Peter Umaga-Jensen are not eligible.\n\nNone of the aforementioned Samoa-eligible players were homegrown. The same is true of Japanese center Timothy Lafaele. He was born in Samoa but moved to New Zealand at the age of four. He moved to Japan on a four-year scholarship at Yamanashigakuin University.\n\nThere was one homegrown Samoa player captured by New Zealand from 2005-2022. Fritz Lee moved to New Zealand aged 15 and went on to play for New Zealand 7’s. He made his Samoa debut in the 2022 Pacific Nations Cup. Lee was joined by five previously uncapped players from New Zealand and one from Australia in playing for Samoa for the first time.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY CAPS Olive Kilifi LH USA USA US Birth; TO Parent; Samoa Parent 31 Charlie Faumuina TH New Zealand New Zealand NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 50 Titi Lamositele TH USA USA US Birth; Samoa Grandparent 32 Victor Vito N8 New Zealand New Zealand NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 33 Hendrick Tui N8 New Zealand Japan NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 47 Christian Leali’ifano FH New Zealand Australia AU Residency; Samoa Parent 26 Male Sa’u CE New Zealand Japan NZ Birth; JP Residency; Samoa Parent 27 Joe Tomane CE New Zealand Australia NZ Birth; AU Residency; Samoa Parent 17 Julian Savea WI New Zealand New Zealand NZ Birth; Samoa Parent 54\n\nTONGA (8)\n\nTonga is a big winner from the new laws. Tonga may be able to field a Quarter Final competitive team at RWC 2023. Eight players from RWC 2015 and 2019 are eligible to make the jump to Tonga for RWC 2023.\n\nFormer Wallabies fullback Israel Folau is now capped by Tonga. He and second-rowers Adam Coleman and Sitaleki Timani can play for Tonga at RWC 2023. Timani was born in Tonga and moved to Australia aged 19 after he had completed high school in Auckland, New Zealand. Lopeti Timani played for Australia in 2016-2017. In 2021 he debuted for Tonga.\n\nFormer RWC players are the tip of the iceberg for Tonga. All Blacks Vaea Fifita, Frank Halai, Nehe Milner-Skudder, Atu Moli, Charles Piutau, Augustine Pulu and George Moala can also play for Tonga in France 2023. George Moala and Vaea Fifita were named on Tonga’s roster to face Spain, Chile and Uruguay in the 2022 November Internationals.\n\nTonga can also now select Pauliasi Manu, a player who joined the All Blacks roster as injury cover but was never capped. New Zealand 7’s player Pita Akhi is also now eligible to play for Tonga via his mother and Samoa via his father. All Black, Malakai Fekitoa has already changed from New Zealand to Tonga via the Olympic loophole. He and fellow former All Black Charles Piutau played for Tonga vs Fiji in 2022.\n\nAll Black center Ngane Laumape will not be eligible in time. Nor will Richie Mo’unga, Billy Vunipola and Mako Vunipola. The Vunipola brothers were raised in Wales and England and were born in Australia and New Zealand respectively. Their father played for Tonga, his country of birth. Nehe Milner-Skudder is focused on playing again for New Zealand.\n\nCalifornians Samu Manoa, Langilangi Haupeakui and Olive Kilifi are now eligible for Tonga. Their last caps were in 2018, 2016 and 2019 respectively. Manoa came out of international retirement in 2022 but did not play against Chile. Kilifi now qualifies for Tonga via the mother’s side of his family and for Samoa via his father’s side.\n\nJapanese-captured players now eligible for Tonga include Uwe Helu, Fetuani Lautami, Amanaki Lotoahea, Ata’ata Moeakiola, Mifiposeti Paea, Sione Teaupa and Sione Vatuvei. Prop Isieli Nakajima, flankers Faulua Makisi, Tevita Tatafu and center Siosaia Fifita are captured by Japan until after RWC 2023.\n\nSekope Kepu and Tatafu Polota-Nau have 200 caps between them for the Wallabies; notwithstanding, the changes to player eligibility mean they are free to play for Tonga at RWC 2023. Doing so would require them to come out of international retirement. Hong Kong capped Tau Koloamatangi in 2019. The New Zealand u20 player can play for Tonga.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Olive Kilifi LH USA USA USA Birth; TO Parent; Samoa Parent 31 Pauliasi Manu LH Tonga New Zealand NZ Residency; TO Birth – Atu Moli LH New Zealand New Zealand NZ Birth; TO Parent 4 Uwe Helu FL Tonga Japan JP Residency; TO Birth 16 Malakai Fekitoa CE Tonga New Zealand TO Birth; NZ Residency 24 Nehe Milner-Skudder CE New Zealand New Zealand NZ Birth; TO Grandparent 13 Ata’ata Moeakiola WI Tonga Japan JP Residency; TO Birth 4 Israel Folau FB Australia Australia AU Birth; TO Parent 73\n\nFIJI (6)\n\nFiji could cap six players from different competitors from RWCs 2015 and 2019; however, it must be noted that the quantity of players changing countries is low compared to Samoa and Tonga. Fiji’s strength at center and on the wing suggests that players at the level of Tevita Kuridrani or Waisake Naholo are outside chances of playing for Fiji at RWC 2023.\n\n2016 All Black Seta Tamanivalu was named on Fiji’s roster for the 2022 Pacific Nations Cup. He qualified for New Zealand via three-years residency after having moved to the country to complete his high school on a scholarship in Auckland.\n\nFour others without RWC experience who Fiji could select are Samuela Anise, Nathan Hughes, Taqele Naiyarovoro, and Sefa Naivalu. Anise and Hughes played N8 for Japan and England. Naiyarovoro, Naivalu and Tamanivalu played center or wing for the All Blacks or Wallabies.\n\nThe selection of any by Fiji is possible but far from certain; Fiji is well-served in these positions. Hughes previously turned down Fiji to play for England for money.\n\nFiji will not be able to select Alivereti Raka who is captured by France until December 2023.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Joe Tu’ineau LO Fiji Tonga FJ Birth; TO Parent 30 Tevita Kuridrani CE Fiji Australia FJ Birth; AU Residency 61 Waisake Naholo WI Fiji New Zealand FJ Birth; NZ Residency 26 Noa Nakataici WI Fiji France FJ Birth; FR Residency 15 Semesa Rokoduguni WI Fiji England FJ Birth; Eng Residency 4 Henry Speight WI Fiji Australia FJ Birth; AU Residency 19\n\nAUSTRALIA (6)\n\nSix players from RWCs 2015 and 2019 that played for teams other than the Wallabies qualify for Australia for RWC 2023. All six are Australian by birth. All Black Tawera Kerr-Barlow is on record as open to changing his allegiance to play for Australia without hesitation.\n\nOne player who did not play at a RWC that is eligible now is Alec Hepburn. He played for England in 2018. There are many Australians playing for test sides other than the Wallabies that will not be eligible in time for RWC 2023. Scotland lock Ben Toolis, flanker Nick Haining and centers Sam Johnson and Sione Tuipulotu are examples. Others include Italian winger Monty Ioane and English N8 Billy Vunipola.\n\nPotential gains do not appear bigger than losses that Australia has faced over recent seasons. Australian born, raised and produced Jack Dempsey and Sione Tuipulotu now play for Scotland and Mack Hanson plays for Ireland. Australia could lose others such as James Ramm to England. All played for Australia u20’s and all moved to Europe as adults on professional rugby contracts.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Josh Furno LO Australia Italy AU Birth; IT Parent 37 Steve Mafi LO Australia Tonga AU Birth; TO Parent 33 Senio Toleafoa LO Australia Samoa AU Birth; Samoa Parent 4 Jack Ram FL Australia Tonga AU Birth; TO Parent 13 Tawera Kerr-Barlow SH Australia New Zealand AU Birth; NZ Parent 27 Ulupano Seuteni CE Australia Samoa AU Birth; Samoa Parent 6\n\nENGLAND (5)\n\nEngland will be able to acquire players currently captured by others, though the chances of any playing for England are minimal. Five players from RWCs 2015 and 2019 could, in theory, play for England at RWC 2023.\n\nThere are additional players who are now eligible for England after having represented another test team. For example, the Irish-capped Kieran Treadwell is now eligible for England as is Darryl Marfo who was capped by Scotland. Second-rower Ruan Ackermann is eligible for England via residency as his appearances for South African ‘A’ were not capturing.\n\nScotland captured players from England that will not be eligible for England for RWC 2023 include Ali Price, Josh Bayliss, Andy Christie, Chris Harris, Rory Hutchinson, Johnny Matthews, Sam Skinner, Hamish Watson, Ben White and Ryan Wilson. Another is Scotland center Huw Jones who has English parents and was raised in England.\n\nA number of Welsh-attached players are also from England. Alex Cuthbert, Tomas Francis, Jonah Holmes, Dan Lydiate, Will Rowlands, Nick Tompkins and Johnny Williams cannot play for England at RWC 2023. Callum Braley played for Italy in 2021 while Billy Burns and Will Addison played for Ireland.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Aaron Jarvis TH England Wales Eng Birth; Wal Grandparent 18 Aaron Shingler LO England Wales Eng Birth; Wal Residency 27 Tim Swinson LO England Scotland Eng Birth; Sco Grandparent 38 Henry Pygros SH England Scotland Eng Birth; Sco Parent 28 Josh Matavesi FH England Fiji Eng Birth; FJ Parent 24\n\nSOUTH AFRICA (5)\n\nThe Springboks are an entirely homegrown team. All active players on the roster are products of the domestic system. There are players capped by others that could now play for South Africa, though the chances of a call-up are minimal.\n\nSouth Africans play for many different countries and many players are regulars in the test teams. As such there are many capped players who will not be available for the Springboks for RWC 2023. Cornell du Preez, Rob Herring, Oli Kebble, Lappies Labuschagné, Bernard Le Roux, Johan Meyer, WP Nel, Quinn Roux, Dylan Richardson, Pierre Schoeman, Kyle Steyn, Duhan van der Merwe, Jaco van der Walt and Paul Willemse are examples.\n\nThe retired CJ Stander would also be unavailable in time for a return to the test arena. Rory Kockott came out of retirement for Castres in December 2022. Some who will be available for RWC 2023 include Scotland-capped prop Alex Allan, Namibian second-rower Adriaan Ludick, the Italian-capped Dries van Schalkwyk and the Romanian-capped Kuselo Moyake.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Allan Dell LH South Africa Scotland ZA Birth; Sco Grandparent 32 Dario Chistolini TH South Africa Italy ZA Birth; IT Parent 20 Jean Kleyn LO South Africa Ireland ZA Birth; IE Residency 5 Josh Strauss N8 South Africa Scotland ZA Birth; Sco Residency 24 Rory Kockott SH South Africa France ZA Birth; FR Residency 11\n\nITALY (4)\n\nItaly’s rugby team has players from numerous countries. This is not new. The country’s top point scorer is Diego Domínguez who was a Puma before playing for Italy. The two most capped Italian players are also from Argentina – Sergio Parisse (142) and Martín Castrogiovanni (119). This is not by chance; almost two-thirds of Argentines have Italian ancestry.\n\nIndications are that the changes will benefit Italy. Kieran Crowley contacted eligible players in late 2021 about playing for Italy in the 2022 Six Nations. Two of them are Super Rugby players Ricky Riccitelli and Carlo Tizzano. The former played hooker for New Zealand u20 level and the second flanker for the Junior Wallabies. Crowley has also been interested in selecting England fly half Alex Lozowski and England u20s back Paolo Odogwu. In an interview Lozowski confirmed that he will not change allegiance.\n\nLouis Lynagh has also been approached. He was raised in England and played for England at u16, u18 and u20 levels. He qualified for England via residency and was called-up for the 2022 Six Nations. Lynagh was born in Italy.\n\nThe changes meant former Pumas captain Agustín Creevy became eligible. He has since played for Argentina. Santiago García Botta, Javier Ortega Desio and Juan Pablo Socino are all eligible in addition to All Black lock Luke Romano and England fly half Danny Cipriani.\n\nSix others who are no longer bound to Argentina are Tomás Baravalle, Teo Castiglioni, Juan Manuel Pitinari, Gregório del Prete, Mariano Romanini, and Joaquín Riera. All but Baravalle presently play in Italy. Others presently bound to Argentina including Tomás Albornoz, Facundo Ferrario and Lucio Sordoni could play for Italy at some point.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Santiago García Botta LH Argentina Argentina AR Birth; IT Grandparent 34 Luke Romano LO New Zealand New Zealand NZ Birth; IT Grandparent 31 Javier Ortega Desio FL Argentina Argentina AR Birth; IT Grandparent 57 Juan Pablo Socino CE Argentina Argentina AR Birth; IT Grandparent 4\n\nSCOTLAND (3)\n\nScotland is a winner from the new eligibility laws. Three players from RWCs 2015 or 2019 could play for Scotland at RWC 2023. Wallaby Jack Dempsey and English winger Ruaridh McConnochie did not play test rugby between RWC 2019 and the point three years later in 2022. Scotland has captured both players.\n\nDempsey changed allegiance to Scotland in late 2022 and McConnochie did so in January 2023. Dempsey played for Scotland against Australia in October 2022, three years after he started for Australia against Georgia and Uruguay at RWC 2019. Both Georgia and Uruguay were entirely made-up of homegrown players. Dempsey and McConnochie can play for Scotland at RWC 2023 against Ireland, Romania, South Africa, and Tonga. On the one hand, Scotland are six-time Quarter Finalists at RWCs. On the other hand, Romania have never reached the knock-out-stages of a Rugby World Cup.\n\nTwo additional names that Scotland can now capture are Australia’s Kane Douglas and Ireland’s John Cooney. Douglas is also eligible to play for Scotland in 2022 and Ireland scrum-half John Cooney will be eligible for Scotland in 2023. Douglas held down a starting position in the 2015 World Cup. He played against Scotland in the Quarter Final in 2015 but is now eligible for Scotland via a grandparent and can play at RWC 2023. His brother has played rugby league for Scotland. Cooney debuted for Ireland in 2017 and last played in February 2020. His father was born in Scotland.\n\nAdditional players also now qualify for Scotland. Former Maori All Black and All Black Elliot Dixon qualifies for both Ireland and Scotland. Former England N8 Zach Mercer is also now eligible for Scotland. He cannot play for England due to selection policies. He is based in France.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Kane Douglas LO Australia Australia AU Birth; Sco Grandparent 31 Jack Dempsey FL Australia Australia AU Birth; Sco Grandparent 14 Ruaridh McConnochie WI England England Eng Birth; Sco Parent 2\n\nIRELAND (2)\n\nThere are hypothetical gains for Ireland. Kieran Brookes, and Shane O’Leary are eligible to play for Ireland for RWC 2023. A third name that may have appeared is Bernard Foley. The Australian meets eligibility requirements of a grandparent. He was recalled by Australia in 2022. Upon being capped against New Zealand in 2022, Foley became unable to join Mack Hansen in Ireland’s backline. Foley played in RWCs 2015 and 2019.\n\nIreland put eligibility changes into use in Rugby Sevens. Australian Liam McNamara played for Australia u20’s in 2016 and for Australia 7’s from 2017-2019. He changed allegiance from one Tier 1 team to another when he debuted for Ireland 7’s at the 2023 Hamilton Sevens in New Zealand.\n\nIreland can also select another former Wallaby in Joe Powell. Former All Black flanker Elliot Dixon and England fly half Freddie Burns are also now eligible. AJ MacGinty will remain bound to the USA.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Kieran Brookes TH England England Eng Birth; IE Grandparent 16 Shane O’Leary FH Ireland Canada IE Birth; CA Parent 14\n\nARGENTINA (1)\n\nSergio Parisse has received plenty of accolades, such as being one of the best rugby players in history. The most recent of his 142 caps came in October 2019; as such, Parisse would be eligible to play for Argentina at Rugby World Cup 2023. He is still interested in playing for Italy.\n\nOther Argentines have been capped by Italy in addition to Spain and the USA. The Italian-capped Leandro Cedaro is now eligible for Los Pumas. Errors from World Rugby meant that Argentina lost other players to Italy; Martín Castrogiovanni, Gonzalo Canale, Santiago Dellapè, Gonzalo García, Ramiro Pez and Luciano Orquera were capped and played in World Cups for Italy despite not being eligible.\n\nArgentina could potentially lose players to Germany. The German embassy in Argentina estimates that 600,000 Argentines are German descendants. The Hospital Alemán places the number at 1 million. Former Pumita Alan Kessen earned four caps for Germany in 2015. Marcos Kremer also has German connections. Juan Pablo Zeiss could in theory play for Germany. He last played for Argentina in December 2020. England’s Matt Kvesic became German-eligible, via birth, in September.\n\nIt should also be noted that no Argentines are capped by neighbors Chile or Uruguay and no Chileans or Uruguayans are capped by Argentina. Argentina will not gain from the new laws.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBLITY VIA CAPS Sergio Parisse N8 Argentina Italy It Parent; AR Birth 142\n\nGEORGIA (1)\n\nGeorgia will not benefit from the law changes. There were 80 players from Georgia playing at a fully professional level in Western Europe in the 2021-2022 season. 79 of them played in France at a Top 14 or a Pro D2 club. No Georgians are capped by France nor by another Tier 1 test team. No equivalent or Jack Dempsey can change allegiance from Australia to Georgia.\n\nOne could argue that the Lelos will benefit as Georgia could gain the services of Otar Turashvili. The Tbilisi native played for Romania at RWC 2015 and his last cap was in 2019. It should be noted that Georgian props at RWC 2015 and 2019 played for Bayonne, Brive, Clermont, Montpellier, Racing 92, Stade Français and Toulon. No prop was Georgian-based. All Georgian players at both tournaments were homegrown.\n\nThe case of Georgia suggests that the new laws make not for meritocracy but for a distorted playing field. The changes are not a solution for Georgia; the result is that Georgia is a second class Tier 2 citizen compared to Samoa. With former All Blacks playing for Samoa against Georgia in November 2022, Georgia not only gains nothing from the changes but loses at the expense of others.\n\nThe changes mean that the prospects of a repeat of Georgia’s win over Tonga at RWC 2015 have decreased considerably. Moreover, Tier 1 teams Italy and Scotland can demonstrably benefit from the new eligibility laws unlike Georgia.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Otar Turashvili HK Georgia Romania RO Residency; GE Birth 36\n\nPORTUGAL (1)\n\nPortugal was the final team to qualify for RWC 2023. Os Lobos qualified with five French players in the starting XV and three others as replacements. Anthony Alves, Thibault de Freitas, Francisco Fernandes, Samuel Marques and Mike Tadjer are examples of French players who helped Portugal qualify for RWC 2023.\n\nAnother, not to be confused with the Uruguayan of the same name, who is capped by Portugal, is Éric dos Santos. Geoffrey Moïse and Jean Sousa are additional players from France who are capped by Portugal.\n\nIn all cases, the players qualified for Portugal based on heritage. They were not products of the Portuguese rugby system. They were not eligible as a result of World Rugby changing the laws to enable players to allegiance.\n\nThe changes do mean that Os Lobos can select RWC 2011 finalist, Morgan Parra. His grandfather moved from Portugal to Metz, France and his father was born in Portugal and moved to France at the age of six. Parra earned the last of his 71 French caps in 2019. Another Top 14 player who could switch is Thomas Laranjeira. He is a former France u20 player who can make the change.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Morgan Parra SH France France PT Parent; FR Birth 71\n\nCHILE (0)\n\nChile qualified for RWC 2023 as Americas 2. The historic qualification means that Chile will be the first new team at a World Cup since Russia qualified for RWC 2011. The South American country eliminated Canada from the RWC qualifiers to advance to face and defeat the USA.\n\nWhich players from RWCs 2015 and 2019 could play for Chile at RWC 2023? None. How many of Chile’s 2021 and 2022 rosters were not raised in Chile? None. Chile qualified for RWC 2023 with a roster of entirely homegrown players.\n\nChile will not benefit from the law changes but will play against Samoa, a team that could field All Blacks such as Charlie Faumuina, Lima Sopoaga, Julian Savea, and Jeffrey To’omaga-Allen. In other words, the eligibility law changes are non-productive and harmful to Chile. Chile’s qualification is an indication that the eligiblity law changes are a flawed way of growing the sport.\n\nFRANCE (0)\n\nThere are some names but little reason to suggest that France will gain from the altered eligibility laws. Argentine center Bautista Ezcurra has a French passport. Brazil’s Daniel Sancery and Felipe Sancery are French-raised and France-qualified via a parent while Laurent Bourda-Couhet was born in France. The trio will be eligible to play for France in 2025. Ultan Dillane played for Ireland in 2021 and Cameron Redpath played for Scotland. Dilate and Redpath were born in France but moved to Ireland and England at the respective ages of 7 and 1.\n\nRedpath was born in France to Scottish parents. He moved to England at the age of 1 and went through the English system, playing both his amateur and professional rugby in England. He never lived in Scotland. He played for England u18 and u20 and was selected for England to tour South Africa; yet, he subsequently debuted for Scotland in 2021 aged 21. Similar to the case of Axel Müller and the USA, the new laws do not enable Redpath to switch to England but he would be eligible to play for France. This suggests that World Rugby have let down the sport despite World Rugby’s CEO having argued that the law changes are not a Pacific Islands measure.\n\nCould the RWC 2023 hosts lose former test players? It is unlikely but not impossible. If Spain were involved then Camille Lopez and Guilhem Guirado would be eligible. Both last played for France in 2019. Guirado would need to change his mind about retirement. Similarly, Morgan Parra could play for Portugal. What about Africa? Eddy Ben Arous qualifies for Nigeria, Fulgence Ouedraogo for Burkina Faso and Sofiane Guitoune for Algeria.\n\nCould France lose 2022 test players in the future? Again, it is unlikely but the potential does exist. One day Demba Bamba could play for Mauritania, Mohamed Haouas could play for Algeria, Grégory Alldritt could play for Ireland or Kenya while Yacouba Camara and Teddy Thomas could play for Mali.\n\nJAPAN (0)\n\nThere are no players from RWCs 2015 and 2019 that could change country to represent Japan at RWC 2023. All Black Akira Ioane was born in Japan but raised in New Zealand. He has caps for the All Blacks in 2022.\n\nThe new laws mean Japan may lose capped players to a number of teams, most notably Tonga. Japan second-rower Warner Dearns is thinking about playing for New Zealand. Japan will not gain players previously capped by others via ancestry.\n\nThe changes do not benefit Japan. On the one hand, the lower ranked Samoa will gain which means Japan’s chances of winning by a similar scoreline in 2023 to that in 2019 have been significantly reduced. On the other hand, Tier 1 teams Australia, Ireland and Scotland can technically select players previously capped by rivals.\n\nNAMIBIA (0)\n\nNo player from RWCs 2015 and 2019 can change country to play for Namibia at RWC 2023. Namibia’s test rosters at RWCs 2015 and 2019 were dominated by homegrown players. Namibia’s roster that won qualification for RWC 2023 as Africa 1 was also homegrown.\n\nExeter Chiefs front-rower Patrick Schickerling, who played for Namibia in two World Rugby u20 tournaments, was included in England’s training squad in 2022 despite being ineligible. He cannot play for England at RWC 2023. Namibia were without him for the RWC 2023 qualifiers in July 2022. He played for England against the Barbarians in June and toured Australia with England in July.\n\nThere are some names now eligible to play for Namibia via birth. Former Wallaby Richard Hardwick was selected by the Welwitschias for the 2022 November Internationals when he debuted for Namibia. Another is Byron McGuigan who also qualifies via birth. The South African-raised McGuigan has ten caps for Scotland. The most recent was in February 2020. Ahead of changing his allegiance, McGuigan met the Namibian coaching staff in Namibia in January 2023.\n\nThere is evident potential for Namibia to benefit; notwithstanding, gains made are low compared to stronger RWC 2015 and 2019 teams. The law changes mean that a repeat of Namibia’s RWC 2015 match against Tonga would benefit the higher ranked and seriously harm the lower ranked competitor.\n\nROMANIA (0)\n\nRWC 2019 was the first without Romania. The Eastern Europeans were disqualified after it was confirmed that the eligibility rules had been broken. Romania’s involvement at RWC 2023 will be without players who represented different countries at RWCs 2015 and 2019.\n\nRomania may benefit from the new laws but at the expense of lower ranked teams. There are not Australian, French, Italian, New Zealand, South African or Scottish players of Romanian decent who can change eligibility. Instead, Moldova lost second-rower Andrei Mahu. He was selected by Romania’ to face Poland in 2023. Mahu has 24 test caps for Moldova. Neither Moldova nor Poland have ever come close to qualifying for a Rugby World Cup. Another player is Moldova tight head Gheoghe Gajion. He was called-up by Romania to face Georgia in March 2022. Victor Leon has also changed from Moldova to Romania.\n\nMore players could follow; indeed, Vadim Cobîlaş and Cristian Ojovan are also Moldovans who play professional rugby at the elite level. They are now eligible for Romania and Russia.\n\nComparative gains and losses of players suggest that the eligibility law changes are not helpful but are harmful to Romania. In November 2022 Romania faced Samoa in Bucharest. All Black Jeffrey To’omaga-Allen started for Samoa.\n\nRomania may be up against Jack Dempsey in their pool match against Scotland at RWC 2023. They may face additional Wallabies such as Adam Coleman, Israel Folau and Sekope Kepu in their match against Tonga. All Blacks Vaea Fifita, Augustine Pulu, George Moala and Malakai Fekitoa all started against Uruguay in Bucharest in November 2022. In short, the eligibility changes have drastically reduced Romania’s chances of beating Tonga.\n\nURUGUAY (0)\n\nThere are no players from RWCs 2015 and 2019 that can change country to represent Uruguay at RWC 2023 nor are there players capped by other countries that could play for Uruguay in France 2023. Los Teros are entirely homegrown and have one of the smallest player pools. World Rugby data demonstrates that Samoa and Tonga’s on-island registered player numbers are both larger than Uruguay’s.\n\nIn 2018 World Rugby published worldwide player numbers. The data listed Uruguay as having 10,506 registered players, Georgia as having 9,451 registered players and Namibia having 18,848 registered players. RWC 2023 debutants, Chile are listed with 2,988 registered players. By way of comparison, Samoa is listed with 13,249 registered players and Tonga with 23,873.\n\nThe comparative numbers of Georgia, Namibia, Chile and Uruguay on the one hand and Samoa and Tonga on the other are explanatory. They illustrate that the suggestion that the Pacific Islands merit access to foreign players to boost their small player numbers is inaccurate. Moreover, World Rugby’s official data indicate that Uruguay will not benefit at all from the eligibility law changes and will actually lose out to Samoa and Tonga as well as to RWC 2023 opponent Italy. The changes are unjustified, unwarranted and backward for Uruguay.\n\nWALES (0)\n\nWales are not going to be able to cap players who played for different countries at RWCs 2015 or 2019. The changes do free up Wales to select Henry Thomas who played for his native England and Luke Hamilton who qualified for Scotland via a parent and played three test matches in 2017-2018. Other players from Wales that will not be eligible in time are Javan Sebastian, Stephen Varney and Rhys Ruddock.\n\nNames from other countries that could change include Shannon Frizell, Joe Heyes, Huw Jones, Lewis Ludlow and Joe Marchant. They qualify via parent or grandparent but all played test rugby in 2021 and / or 2022.\n\nOTHERS\n\nCANADA (1)\n\nCanada will not compete at RWC 2023. The North Americans were eliminated by Chile during qualifiers in 2021. If Canada were to compete in the tournament then there could be a hypothetical trade with Ireland in the form of Shane O’Leary and Luke McGrath. The Ontario-born hooker Ewan Ashman debuted for Scotland in 2021.\n\nRetired England second-rower George Kruis has a Canadian parent while Luke McGrath was born in Hamilton, Ontario. Both men played at RWC 2019 with the former last being capped in 2020 and the latter at RWC 2019 itself.\n\nCapturing Luke McGrath would strengthen Canada’s player pool. On the one hand, the new laws may boost Canada’s chances in future RWC qualifiers against the USA, Chile or Uruguay. On the other hand, the new laws will greatly decrease the possibility of Canada replicating the RWC 2011 victory over Tonga at a future RWC. In short, Canada is facing a larger loss than a gain from the new laws.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBLITY VIA CAPS Luke McGrath SH Canada Ireland CA Birth; IE Parent 19\n\nUSA (0)\n\nHad the USA succeeded in qualifying for RWC 2023, Players from RWCs 2015 and 2019 would not be able to pledge their allegiance to switch to play for the USA for the tournament. The USA is not alone in being an example in which the new laws are harmful rather than helpful to Tier 2 teams.\n\nItalian Tommaso Boni is USA eligible. Boni played 11 times for Italy from 2016-2018 but has been out of favor ever since. The 30-year-old from Zebre is eligible to switch allegiance through his grandfather who was born in New York.\n\nOther players who could at some point play for the USA would not be eligible in 2023. Ireland’s Jack Carty has a USA grandparent. If the Eagles had qualified for Rugby World Cup 2023 there would not be an opportunity for Carty to play for the USA as he played for Ireland in the 2022 Six Nations.\n\nOthers who are off-limits for RWC 2023 include the Tennessee-born Tommy Seymour who has retired; the Massachusetts-born Rufus McLean, who was captured by Scotland in 2022 though may not play again; and the Ohio-born Sam Underhill who is attached to England. Collegiate All-American and Major League Rugby player Rob Irimescu was selected by Romania in January 2023. He is a native of New York; his parents are from Constanta, Romania.\n\nThe new laws are worded as benefitting emerging nations. However, the changes will not benefit the USA like they will Samoa and Tonga. The Eagles can, in theory, lose homegrown players Olive Kilifi, Titi Lamositele, and Samu Manoa; yet, cannot select a player who spent ten years of his youth in Arizona. There is a case for Axel Müller to be eligible to play for the USA. He holds a U.S. passport.\n\nZIMBABWE (0)\n\nThere has been speculation that Zimbabwe could benefit greatly from the new laws. It is true that despite Zimbabwe not playing in a RWC since 1991, players from the African country have played in recent RWCs. However, no players from RWCs 2015 or 2019 played for Zimbabwe in the RWC 2023 qualifiers.\n\nThere are two reasons for this. First, four of the five RWC 2015 or 2019 players from Zimbabwe have retired. They are David Denton, Tendai Mtawarira, Taku Ngwenya and David Pocock. Second, the remaining player, Sebastian Negri, is captured by Italy until 2026.\n\nThere are three capped players who may interest the Sables in the future. All Black Gareth Evans, who played his only test match in 2018, has Zimbabwean parents. One-time capped Wallaby center Kyle Godwin is Zimbabwean-born. Don Armand is also from Zimbabwe. He qualified to play for England via a Grandparent. However, the fact that none were involved in Zimbabwe’s RWC qualifiers in 2022 suggests that the chances of Zimbabwe selecting these players are low.\n\nTwo further names are English Premiership second-rowers Eli Snyman and Mike Williams. Snyman was previously tied to South Africa due to him having played for South Africa u20’s in 2016. Williams trained for Eddie Jones’ England in 2016 though he was never capped. Both players could have competed in the RWC 2023 qualifiers for Zimbabwe. Neither player did so.\n\nALGERIA (2)\n\nAlgeria is a second African country that has been speculated as one that could benefit tremendously from the new laws. There are over 500,000 Algerian immigrants in France; this is more than the number of Pacific Islanders in New Zealand.\n\nCould Algeria benefit by selecting former French test players? Two players from RWC 2019 are eligible. A RWC 2011 player, Maxime Mermoz qualifies for Algeria via his mother. He had speculated about coming out of retirement to represent Algeria in RWC 2023 qualifiers. Algeria did not qualify for RWC 2023.\n\nAlgeria is able to cap France 7’s or u20’s players including Johan Aliouat, Kylan Hamdaoui and Sadek Deghmache. All are from France and have played in the Top 14. They qualify for Algeria via heritage.\n\nIt should also be noted that many active players from France are capped by Algeria. Bekada Belhaouari, Jonathan Best, Yassin Boutemmani, Sofiane Chellat, Issam Hamel, Said Hiereche, Mallik Hamadache, Thomas Mamou, Frédéric Medves, Nadir Megdoud, Mehdi Mérabet and Enzo Zaitri are examples. This is in contrast to African rivals including Kenya, Namibia and Zimbabwe.\n\nThere are additional French players who qualify under the new rules, but will not be eligible in or before RWC 2023. Racing 92 scrum-half Teddy Iribaren, Montpellier prop Mohamed Haouas and Toulon second-rower Swan Rebbadj could become eligible for Algeria overtime. The trio played for France in 2021. Iribaren, Haouas and Rebbadj are all French born, French raised and are homegrown French players.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Rabah Slimani TH France France FR Birth; DZ Parent 57 Sofiane Guitoune CE Algeria France FR Residency; DZ Birth 9\n\nSPAIN (2)\n\nSpain was disqualified from RWC 2019 qualifiers because former French u20 players, who had played against Wales u20s, played RWC qualifying matches for Spain. They qualified via ancestry. This example highlights the controversy of the new eligibility laws. Spain was disqualified from RWC 2023 due to a scandal involving South African prop Gavin van den Berg and passport forgery.\n\nThe Spanish Men’s test team has players from different countries, most notably Argentina, and France. Estanislao Bay, Gonzalo López Bontempo, Fernando López and Aníbal Bonan, Emiliano Calle, Federico Castiglioni, Ignacio Contardi, Facundo Domínguez, Iñaki Mateo, Bautista Güemes, Juan Pablo Guido, Nicolás Jurado, Santiago Ovejero, and Baltazar Taibo are Argentines. Gautier Gibouin, Lucas Guillaume, Fabien Perrin, Gauthier Minguillon, Manuel Ordas and Guillaume Rouet are from France.\n\nWill the new laws provide Spain with a boost? If van den Berg had not been capped then Los Leones would play at RWC 2023 and Jordi Murphy and Camille Lopez would officially be eligible. They both competed at RWC 2019 and neither player has since played test rugby.\n\nFormer French captain Guilhem Guirado would be eligible but has retired. Spanish-born scrum half Sam Hidalgo-Clyne is captured by Scotland until after the World Cup. Bayonne winger Rémy Baget is Spanish-eligible but was on France’s roster to tour Japan in 2022. Diego Vidal had his eligibility captured by Brazil in 2022.\n\nNumerous other players from France and Argentina are captured via Sevens or the national Next-of-XV. This has resulted in speculation that Spain will be able to cap many players that were previously off-limits. One example is fullback Tomás Jorge. Clarification notes that Tomás Jorge does not have Spanish ancestry. Former Los Pumas 7’s player, Estanislao Bay is now eligible and debuted for Spain in 2023.\n\nSpain may gain in the context of playing against Georgia or Romania, but the law changes suggest that if were Spain to play then the possibility of a Spanish win against Tonga in the Pool B RWC 2023 match are significantly reduced precisely due to Tonga’s gains from the law changes. In addition, Spain loses out in comparative terms to the prospective gains of Tier 1 teams Italy and Scotland.\n\nFrom a Spanish perspective the law changes provide comparatively less than what existed prior to the law changes. The changes are also negative due to players that caused Spain to be disqualified from the RWC 2019 qualifiers now being eligible.\n\nPLAYER POS BIRTH COUNTRY PLAYED FOR ELIGIBILITY VIA CAPS Jordi Murphy FL Spain Ireland ES Birth; IE Parent 30 Camille Lopez FH France France FR Birth; ES Grandparent 28\n\nRUSSIA (0)\n\nRussia competed at RWCs 2011 and 2019 but will not be involved in RWC 2023. If Russia had not been disqualified from qualifying, due to non-rugby reasons, there are not players who represented different countries at past World Cups who could be called-up to play for them in France 2023. Russia was a test team of homegrown players at RWC 2019.\n\nThe new laws do nonetheless mean that Russia can cap players from rivals; specifically from lower ranked teams. The changes enable Russia to benefit at the expense of others from Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Moldova and Kazakhstan started 2022 ranked 58th and 62nd in the world. Russia started 2022 ranked 25th.\n\nMoldova players Viktor Arhip and Maxim Gargalic and Kazakhstan’s Anton Makarenko switched their eligibility to Russia and debuted against Romania in a RWC 2023 qualifier on February 05, 2022. The changes mean that Moldova second-rower Andrei Mahu became eligible for Russia and Romania."
