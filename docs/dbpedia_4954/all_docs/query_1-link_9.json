        "text": "Guess what I spotted at Dunedin airport? The Black Jersey What does this Jersey mean? It depends who you ask I imagine To teams that play the All Blacks they probably know that they‚Äôre going to be in for a battle To NZ rugby players it‚Äôs what most aspire to become, to put that black jersey on or perhaps to create a legacy or to honour that legacy of all the greats that played before them and leave it in a better place once they have moved on. The one thing that everyone can learn from is the standards that the All Blacks set is a continual drive for excellence and that winning is everything. In an age where participation is rewarded without the pressure to get a result, have we become to soft and accepting of ‚Äú AVERAGE or PARTICIPATION MEDALS?‚Äù You either create a focus on winning or a focus on participation. Which one do you prefer? Is the focus on winning to outdated? Be great to get your comments. Do you agree? #sales #salestraining #salestrainer\n\nLove this post from David Clancy ‚òòÔ∏èabout athlete availability. In my years of working in high performance sport, and trying to push the boundaries of human performance through marginal gains and innovation, I always felt very grounded by the fact that above all else, an athlete who is available to train with the quality, frequency and consistency that has been prescribed by their programme, will be seven times more likely to reach their goal. Physical and psychological availability are like gold dust in sport. And that's why it's so interesting to me that we are still rubbish at quantifying and doing something about the impact that menstrual cycle symptoms have on availability of athletes. We've got pretty good at reporting that it's a real issue. The data is so consistent in every research paper that describes the proportion of active women and athletes whose quality or quantity of training is impacted by physical or psychological symptoms of their cycle. Another paper landed in my inbox today confirming (again) what we already know... that in a sample of 300 female athletes, 74% had physical symptoms and 63% had psychological symptoms related to their menstrual cycle. Follow up interviews found these symptoms decreased performance of these athletes, both in competition and training (Bugaevsky, 2023. J Clin Anesth & Res). Given that three quarters of athletes will have availability impacted by the menstrual cycle, and we know availability is key to successful performance (as brilliantly described by David below), what are we doing about it? Are we doing enough? Are we doing the right things (lots of below-par attempts to collect menstrual cycle data from athletes but do nothing useful with it)? Of course, it's complex. If availability was easy, every athlete would have nailed it by now. But it's affected by so many bio, psycho and social factors, some of which are unpredictable, that it's an ever present challenge in sport. But when it comes to the menstrual cycle, we know enough - we know symptoms are impacting availability, we know there are things we can do to help manage symptoms (if you don't, go buy our book!), and we have good tools to monitor the impact of interventions. So what's the problem? Again, it's complex. Some athletes are afraid to report symptoms for fear of judgement or selection consequences. Some are supported by coaches who are uncomfortable talking about the topic. Trainers and practitioners haven't historically had access to good information about how to help their athletes manage symptoms. And there is a deep rooted acceptance of suffering being a normal part of having a female reproductive system that we also have to undo. But for now, I believe we can all do better. We know the issue. We have solutions. We can measure their effectiveness. By helping athletes manage symptoms we can improve their availability, which in turn will improve their performance. What are we waiting for? #femaleathletehealth\n\nAs we go into the second weekend of a thrilling Six Nations, here‚Äôs a really timely story about the unintended benefits of lowering the tackle height (from shoulder height to sternum) in schools and across much of amateur Rugby Union. This was a controversial change. A year ago traditionalists were up in arms. Many feared it would ruin the sport as they knew it. In reality it has proved to do the opposite. While it‚Äôs too early to conclusively say that it has lowered the incidence of concussion, the anecdotal evidence is that there has been a significant improvement. And it has had another unintended consequence - because the rule leads to fewer two-on-one tackles, the ball-carrier can often offload the ball to a team mate. So as well as improving safety, rugby is getting faster and more enjoyable to watch, with fewer set-piece interruptions. Those of us in positions of influence in the game should take heart from this example. * Increasing player safety doesn‚Äôt have to come at the expense of the sporting spectacle. * Innovation is critical to the future of the sport.

As a few of you know im like my Rugby, Last night though we watched Grandslammers on ITV. It was great TV and further showed how team sports especially rugby can help create a bond like no over. They went into a prison to train them to play the guards. Ive youve got kids get them to watch as also showed how bad decisions mean Prision and how tough life was inside. One of my all time fave films is the longest yard(both versions) and mean machine. All that was missing was someone like MONK attacking a guard on the pitch. Whats this got to do with HR though. TEAMS we help you team to make correct decisions and become part of that team to guide you through the match of work. Get in touch for any issues before they escalate. Did you know,They‚Äôve invented a new version of rugby where only people who wear glasses can play it. It‚Äôs a non-contact sport. #hr #hradvice #employmentlaw #rugby #itv\n\nHow do you react when something goes wrong, or you suffer a big defeat? It can be easy to blame, get angry, despondent, retreating into your shell. But the really strong people tackle adversity heads on. They learn from what went wrong. They use the experience to strengthen the bonds of the team, improve processes and preparation for next time. To come back stronger. Watching Gloucester Rugby suffer a 90-0, 14 try defeat to Northampton Saints on Saturday was interesting. No shouting, no blame. They continued to apply themselves but they were simply outclassed. At the end of the game rather than disappearing straight off into the changing room they formed the traditional tunnel to applaud the opposition off the pitch (pretty much a mandatory event in rugby anyway) and then walked around the pitch thanking their fans and speaking to them. Knowing rugby players as I do, they'll learn from this and come back stronger. Whereas if we look to football there are numerous examples of teams giving up when they face adversity. Manchester United at the moment for example. The players are paid so much that they don't really care. They'll get another contract with another team. The manager will get the sack. What do you do in business when you suffer from a major disappointment?"
