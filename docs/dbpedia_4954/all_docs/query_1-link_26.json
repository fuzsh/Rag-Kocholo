        "text": "Thurles were narrowly edged out by Fethard with a score line of 18 – 15 in a game that was dominated by hometown refereeing.\n\nThurles gave a great display of rugby and the score line does not reflect the game. We had tries from Ryan McDonnell and Paddy Dunican and Brandon Shanahan kicked an outstanding conversion from the sideline and also kicked a penalty.\n\nA man-of-the-match performance was given by Thurles wing forward Donogh Moore who has really found his feet this year after being switched in from the backs.\n\nLine-out action from the U-18s clash with Fethard\n\nMunster U18 Girls:\n\nAishling O'Hagan and Gemma Dunican (pictured right) were selected to play for the Munster U-18s in last weekend's Interpro blitz in Dublin\n\nThurles v Clanwilliam U14 Friendly – Thurles 26 – 12 Clanwilliam:\n\nThurles picked up their first win of the year in highly entertaining game under lights in Loughtagalla. Both sides kept ball in hand and attacked from all areas of the pitch. Thurles playing with a strong breeze started strongest and after initial hard running by Connor Bailey Thurles recycled left for Owen Byrne to stretch for Thurles first try after 6 minutes.\n\nTwo more tries followed on 10 and 20 minutes from Thurles try machine James Devaney the pick of which was good move by the Thurles backline with his centre partner putting him in space 40m out, Devaney outstripping the cover the run in close to the posts. Both scores were converted by Sam Quinlan. Clan finished the half strongly and Thurles scrambled well in defence before conceding a try just before half time.\n\nDevaney completed his hat trick just after half time with a solo effort after good work by Edmond Connolly, sprinting from 30m, momentarily halted by a tackle only to spring to his feet and get in . The try was well converted by Quinlan into a strong breeze. This left Clan with an up hill battle but they enjoyed the majority of possession and field position for the second half picking up converted try 5 minutes from time.\n\nThurles set piece was solid with great work by the front five in winning a couple scrums against the head and great effort that driving the Clan pack back, and the home team edged the contest at the break down with excellent rucking all day. The back row were excellent as a unit and their work rate in defence laid the ground work for the win.\n\nRichmond RFC Notes\n\nCourtesy of:- Natalie McNamara, Club PRO\n\nClub Focus:\n\nAnyone that missed last Fridays Independent Article on the club the link is here.

The team look splendid in their new kit, sporting the logo of our sponsors, Keane's Jewellers, for the first time. Unfortunately, that was as good as it got, as we suffered a comprehensive defeat at the hands of a rampant Cashel side.\n\nPlaying with the aid of a strong breeze in the first half, we were first to score when Shane O'Brien kicked a penalty after fifteen minutes. However, while most of the play was in the Cashel half, we were unable to take advantage of the wind, and Cashel were next to score with a converted penalty on one of their few excursions into the Crescent half.\n\nThe first half ended all square at three points apiece, and we now faced a difficult second half in which Cashel would have the wind advantage. We suffered a further blow when our Captain for the day, Cathal O'Reilly, was sin binned five minutes before half-time.\n\nTwo minutes into the second half, Cashel made swift use of the wind advantage, and the extra man, when they scored a converted try on the wing. They followed this up with an unconverted try ten minutes later, putting the visitors 15 points to 3 clear.\n\nDespite being behind, Crescent continued to press forward and troubled Cashel for most of the second half but just couldn't get on the scoreboard. Cashel wrapped up the win with a converted third try on full time. The final score was Old Crescent 3 Cashel 22. Our quest for a first Munster Senior Cup continues.\n\nOur A Team played Richmond in the Munster Senior Seconds League last Sunday afternoon in Rhebogue, and came away with a convincing win by 22 points to 13.\n\nLast Friday night, our Thirds travelled to Annacotty to take on UL Bohs in the Gleeson League. After the previous week's disappointing loss to Richmond, player/coach Andy Cunnane and his team were looking to rebound with a strong performance. In very wet conditions both sides started brightly, but as the first half went on Old Crescent grew into the game and took a deserved lead right before the interval. After a powerful line break by back row Martin Kelly, Crescent recycled the ball and centre Don Caulfield charged over the line from ten meters out, breaking through three tackles in the process. Winger Sean O'Dea converted to leave the visitors 7-0 up at half-time.\n\nIn the second half, Crescent began to control the game through out-half Kevin South, while lock Gerry Fitzgibbon dominated the line out, stealing several of the home side's throws. Crescent extended their lead when South intercepted the ball in his own half and raced to the corner, showing quick feet to beat the opposition cover.\n\nAfter an impressive performance, the forwards got a well deserved try before the end when debutant Welsh back row Marc Fussell broke off the back of a rolling maul and touched down in the corner. The game finished 17-0 to Old Crescent.\n\nJohn O'Riordan Memorial Tournament:\n\nOld Crescent RFC Underage Section held the annual John O'Riordan Memorial Tournament for Under 11's in Rosbrien last Saturday morning. We hosted sixteen teams from the following clubs: Ballinasloe RFC, Cork Constitution RFC, Galwegians RFC, Garryowen FC, Muskerry RFC, Newcastlewest RFC, Sundays Well RFC, Willow Park Dublin, and of course, Old Crescent RFC. Rosbrien was in festive mood last Saturday morning with over 200 young players, parents and coaches, enjoying the sunshine and showers.\n\nThe Tournament got underway at 10.30am with eight games being played simultaneously. After the first three games were played by each team, everyone retired to the clubhouse for a well deserved break and refreshments. Anthony O'Dwyer and his staff played a blinder dishing out sausages and drinks to all. The only downpour of the day occurred during the break so someone was obviously looking out for us!\n\nThe rugby resumed after the break with eight teams left in the competition, four in the Cup and four in the Plate. The teams in the Plate were Ballinasloe RFC v Willow Park B and Galwegians RFC v Garryowen FC. The Plate final was contested by Willow Park B and Garryowen FC, which ended in a close one-all draw.\n\nThe four teams left in the Cup, winners of their respective Groups, were Willow Park A V Old Crescent White and Old Crescent Blue v Sundays Well. The Cup final was between Willow Park A and Old Crescent Blue. After a closely contested final, Willow Park A from Dublin were the overall winners.\n\nCollette and Michelle O'Riordan, widow and daughter respectively of the late John O'Riordan, past President of Old Crescent RFC in whose memory the Under 11 Tournament is held annually, presented the prizes.
