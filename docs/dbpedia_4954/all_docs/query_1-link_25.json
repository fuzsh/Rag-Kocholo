        "text": "Munster are closing in on appointing an American football strength and conditioning coach as head of athletic performance, causing surprise and disappointment within Munster and Irish rugby circles that indigenous candidates have been overlooked again.\n\nHe&rsquo;s the coaching constant at Munster, working under three different head coaches in as many years. Jerry Flannery understands better than most the value system crucial to the province&rsquo;s future - and the importance of the Munster manual.\n\nMunster 36 Ospreys 10:&nbsp;Johann van Graan has declared the transition from one Munster coach to the next at an end as he begins preparation for the first acid test of his new team&rsquo;s European credentials on Saturday.\n\nConor Murray has spoken of the profound impact the sudden death of Anthony Foley has had on him and the entire Munster squad.\n\nThe Connacht team bus will leave the Sportsground shortly after noon today for The Strand Hotel in Limerick where the players and management will have a light meal, run through their plans for the match and then head for Thomond Park.&nbsp;\n\nMunster boss Anthony Foley insists the province are determined to hang onto Ireland wing Simon Zebo and is hopeful a new deal can be reached in the coming weeks to head off Toulon interest.\n\nA Kerry seaside holiday home scheme with 11, large well-built homes with stone facades is for sale for a receiver, guiding &euro;1.2 million, while local reports also suggest the imminent sale of a local hotel or two, to US-based buyers.\n\nMunster are keeping their fingers crossed that two experienced Irish Internationals, Keith Earls and Donnacha Ryan, will be available for their European Champions Cup games against Saracens and Sale Sharks next month.\n\nWHILE professionalism is now well entrenched in rugby, John Kelly&rsquo;s role for Munster Rugby has progressed from a decade as a paid player until the Ireland wing&rsquo;s retirement in 2007 to that of a volunteer, albeit one a chair of a PGC responsible for the recruitment and retention of players as well as the hiring of the coaching staff.\n\nThe Joe Schmidt era continued on its upward curve Saturday when Ireland convincingly put away the second ranked team in the world at a raucous Aviva Stadium.\n\nMunster fly out of the province today on their latest European adventure as the players prepare for tomorrow&rsquo;s Champions Cup Pool 1 opener against Sale Sharks in England&rsquo;s north-west.\n\nThe appointment of Anthony Foley as Munster’s next head coach was great, the timing was right, and I think there is so much more to come from him that we haven’t yet seen.\n\nAnthony Foley wasn’t even a twinkle in his father’s eye when the family name hit the rugby headlines for the first time.\n\nMunster chief executive Garrett Fitzgerald admits it is “common sense” to install Anthony Foley as a leading contender to succeed Rob Penney as head coach but that the search for the New Zealander’s replacement goes beyond one man.\n\nIt is now more than a decade since the famous Miracle Match of 2003, but memories of that never-to-be-forgotten occasion will be revived when three survivors participate in today’s Seat Series clash of Munster and Gloucester at Thomond Park (kick-off 5pm).\n\nAs manager to the Munster rugby team, he oversaw the seat-of-the-pants transition from amateurism to the pro era — with all its attendant scrapes and dramas. It was the age of innocence, smiles Jerry Holland, but there were as many guilty as innocent!\n\nMarcus Horan sat down to decide his future. Another year in rugby? With no contract on the table from Munster he knew it was time to end a long and fruitful sporting career.\n\nThere will be no Heineken Cup miracle match for Ronan O’Gara this weekend after the veteran fly-half picked up a one-week ban that rules him out of Sunday’s must-win final pool game with Racing Metro.\n\nSpa bid to ensure there is no repeat of their dreadful finish to the drawn Kerry IFC final when they face Finuge in tomorrow’s replay (Austin Stack Park, 2.30pm)\n\nMick Galwey, his old sparring partner with Shannon, Munster and Ireland, last night launched John Hayes’s autobiography “The Bull” in the Sin Bin, the Limerick bar owned by another former team mate and rugby legend, Peter Clohessy, who couldn’t be present because of the death earlier in the day of his father, Noel.\n\nThe date of Paul O’Connell’s return to competitive rugby is still unknown after Munster head coach Rob Penney admitted he did not know when the Ireland and Lions lock would be ready.\n\nEnglish and French clubs should learn from Ireland’s Heineken Cup success and not use it as a pretext for opting out of the competition, according to Munster team manager, Niall O’Donovan.\n\nPaul O’Connell and the bulk of Munster’s Irish international contingent are “on schedule” to make their seasonal debuts in 16 days’ time at Ravenhill.\n\nIf first impressions count, then new Munster rugby coach Rob Penney got off to a flyer yesterday at his official unveiling, apologising to the assembled hacks for arriving a few minutes late.\n\nMunster coach Rob Penney has yet to reveal his vision for the future but the line-out and development of a new high quality back row will be high up on his agenda.\n\nMunster coaches Rob Penney and Simon Mannix, who this week jetted in to meet the players, will both be based in Cork, according to the Evening Echo.\n\nMunster are in no doubt captain Paul O’Connell will be ready for pre-season training later this month, despite failing to pass fit for Ireland’s summer tour to New Zealand.\n\nMUNSTER’S latest second row prodigies Ian Nagle and Dave Foley are poised for a breakthrough, but they’re still hampered by the presence of an international “group of four” that will force them to wait their turn in the queue, according to respected analyst and rugby coach Niall O’Donovan.\n\nFROM the fifth minute onward when Ireland chose a scrum rather than a more predictable option after being awarded a free kick and dismantled the Argentine Jaguares at what they are renowned for doing best, there could have been only one outcome to last night’s A international at the splendid new stadium in Tallaght."
