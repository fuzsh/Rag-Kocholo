        "text": "Since her debut on social media, the seasoned actress Zeenat Aman has been creating waves for all the right reasons. Her Instagram handle, going by the name \"thezeenataman,\" opened its virtual doors in February and has since amassed a whopping 223k followers. One quick browse through her profile will lead you to a treasure trove of heart-warming posts that feature cherished memories of her past. Each post is accompanied by stunning visuals and poignant notes, leaving her fans awash with emotion. Just recently, the actress poured her heart out in a touching social media post, reminiscing about her \"desi girl\" roots, her favourite Indian dishes, her comfort meal, and much more.\n\n\"Clothes do not maketh the woman!\" Aman wrote in the beginning of her caption and went on to explain how people have commonly linked her with \"Western glam\" throughout the years, but the truth couldn't be further from the stereotype. In reality, Zeenat Aman is the epitome of all things \"desi,\" down to her very core. She then went into detail her dietary habits, which couldn’t have been more desi. \"It doesn't matter where I am travelling in the world, within two days I begin to crave home food and go in search of an Indian restaurant,\" she wrote. And can you guess what could be her ultimate comfort meal? It is the staple dal chawal of every Indian home. You read that right.\n\nFurther revealing her culinary preferences, Zeenat expressed her fondness for pairing papad and achar with her meals, relishing in the delectable dosas served at Dakshinayan, and indulging in kaju katli at any opportunity. Moreover, she revealed that the season of mango is one that brings her immense joy. \"I always have a couple of jars of namkeen stashed in my bedroom,\" she added. Isn’t that all of us? While concluding her post, the actress implored her fans to suggest local delicacies as she is continuously exploring and discovering new dishes from diverse India and revealed \"P.S.: I'm vegetarian\".\n\nThe post quickly went viral on social media, prompting fans to inundate her with a plethora of suggestions. Actor Manisha Koirala was one of the first ones to comment and wrote \"Home-cooked meals are the best...especially my mother's cooked meals.\" To this, Aman replied, \"Yes, indeed.\"\n\nA fan went on to explain a regional dishes from the remote parts of India. The comment read \"For me, I travel a lot. Extensively in rural corners of India. So I eat in small villages with the family, and in Darjeeling particularly, there's a remote village I work at. They make this 'kaudi' pasta there loaded with vegetables. Uff. One of the best pasta I've had. So healthy! And, their range of forest greens (saag, sabzi)...my favourite is fiddlehead fern cooking in less oil with some potatoes. They serve it with rice, black dal, dalle (spicy chilly) pickle, and their unique radish salad.\""
