        "text": "Neetu Kapoor Speaks About Granddaughter Raha\n\nIn the course of their conversation, Neetu Kapoor also spoke about her granddaughter, Raha Kapoor, who recently turned one. Speaking about Raha, the actor discussed the 'friendly mini battles' she engages in with Alia and her mother, Soni Razdan, regarding her granddaughter.\n\n\"At my home, the baby is growing. I keep instructing the help to tell her to say Papa. But Soni says to tell her to say Mumma. So, I went the other day to the house, and Alia says, 'Oh, by the way, she said Mumma. So, I said, she didn't say Mumma, but she said Mum-Mum. So, don't be so happy,\"\n\nNeetu added.\n\nNeetu Kapoor Recalls Fond Memories With Rishi Kapoor\n\nDuring the show, Karan asked Neetu about her time with her late husband and actor Rishi Kapoor when they were in New York for his cancer treatment. Neetu responded,\n\n\"I don’t like to remember the sad part. I like to remember the good part of our relationship and of our time in New York. So, New York was really sad, but we had the best year of my life. Because Chintu Ji was a very loving person. I always still say in the present tense. He had a lot of love in him. But there was something; he never really showed his love.”\n\nRecalling her memories with Rishi and his changed behaviour following the diagnosis, Neetu added, \"He always kept his distance, bullied people, and didn’t prefer showing his love. Especially with me and my children. He was like a big thing that respect, and he comes from that family. With that, he lost out onall those years with his children. He was never a friend to them, but that year he opened up and showed love towards me as well. We had the best time. We did have some really sad moments when he was neutropenic, chemo days, and the red cells used to go down. But when he was fine, we used to party, go out for lunch, and have fun.”\n\nZeenat Aman on Battling Depression\n\nZeenat also shared her thoughts on why actors in the industry often slip into depression and candidly spoke about how fame is an erratic phenomenon. Zeenat shared,\n\n\"Fame is such a fickle thing. And you cannot hinge your sense of self-worth on that. Because one day you are loved; the next day you are disliked; the third day you are hated; and the fourth day you are pitied. And a few days down the road, they will resurrect you again. So why would you base your sense of self-worth on something as fickle as that?”\n\nSpeaking about Instagram, she added, \"I think Instagram is such a wonderful platform if used correctly. It gives you a voice, provides a space to express yourself authentically, not dictated by a third or fourth person's definition of you. I was overwhelmed with the love and affection, completely overwhelmed.\"\n\n(At The Quint, we are answerable only to our audience. Play an active role in shaping our journalism by becoming a member.
