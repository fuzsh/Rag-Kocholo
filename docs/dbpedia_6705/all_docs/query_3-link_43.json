        "text": "Zeenat Aman was a raging sensation in the ‘70s and the ‘80s and she still continues to reign. Her fearless attitude and outspoken nature made her one of the most iconic and influential actresses in our industry. From the very start of her career, she refused to conform to the norms and walked on her own path. No wonder then she’s still such a sensation!\n\nBesides her badass attitude, the diva is always empowering the youth, especially young women, to stand up for themselves. She recently shared some golden dating advice and I couldn’t agree more.\n\nThe Hare Rama Hare Krishna actress recently got into a candid conversation with Kusha Kapila on her chat show Swipe Ride. When asked to share one piece of advice for the younger generation about love and dating, she had the most practical reply. She said, “I’m really sorry to have to say this but I think young people should just hold on to their physical selves. Don’t jump into bed with the guy right away. Wait to know each other. You yourself are very precious. Don’t fritter it away, don’t throw it away.”\n\nBut wait, that’s not it! In the same interview, Zeenat Aman emphasised on the fact that women need to be financially independent and confident enough to make their own decisions. And I couldn’t agree more with her. She said, “Every woman should be confident and capable of financially supporting themselves. This allows them to make choices for themselves and control their own future. When women have financial resources and opportunities at their disposal, they can overcome obstacles, pursue their passions, and make decisions that align with their goals and dreams. Being financially independent isn’t just about having money; it signifies the freedom to live life on one’s own terms, without relying on others. It’s a way to achieve fairness, make their own choices, and evolve into the best version of oneself.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn today’s digital age, finding a partner might seem as simple as swiping right, but there’s more to it. It’s not just about finding a person but discovering a companion who truly understands you. In this fast-paced world, taking the time to truly know someone is essential.\n\nAs for Zeenat Ji, please keep inspiring us with your golden words and reminding us of our true worth!\n\nFeatured Image: Instagram"
