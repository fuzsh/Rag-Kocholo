        "meta_description": "Following Mumtaz's criticism of Zeenat Aman's support for live-in relationships, Saira Banu has now shared her viewpoint, identifying herself as 'very old-fashioned' and expressing disapproval of modern relationship trends. Rejecting the idea of live-in arrangements as 'unimaginable' and 'unacceptable,' she emphasized her adherence to traditional values. Saira conveyed to HT, 'I cannot agree with this statement. I would never advocate for live-in relationships like that. It's something unimaginable and unacceptable for me.' Mumtaz's caution to Zeenat, referencing her troubled marriage with Mazhar as a cautionary tale, shed light on the complexities of relationships. During her recent interview with Zoom, Mumtaz remarked, 'Zeenat should be careful with her advice. She has suddenly gained significant social media popularity, and while I understand her desire to seem trendy, giving advice that contradicts our moral values isn't the solution to gaining followers. Take Zeenat as an example... She knew Mazhar Khan for years before marrying him. Her marriage was a living hell. She should be the last person giving relationship advice.' This sequence of events stemmed from Zeenat's initial Instagram post advocating for live-in relationships. A portion of her post stated, 'One of you asked me about relationship advice in the comments section of my last post. Here's a personal opinion I haven't previously shared – if you're in a relationship, I strongly recommend that you live together before getting married!'",
