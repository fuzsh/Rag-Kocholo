        "text": "Veteran actress Zeenat Aman took to her social media to share wise relationship advice. She shared a picture with her pet Lily whom she rescued from the streets of Bombay. She wrote about Lily, ''Lily is a good ole desi dog rescued from the streets of Bombay. She is my darling shadow, and the reason that I am a firm advocate of pet rescue and adoption''.\n\nIn the same caption, Zeenat Aman replied to a fan asking for relationship advice. To this, the actress wrote, ''Here’s a personal opinion I haven’t previously shared - if you’re in a relationship, I strongly recommend that you LIVE TOGETHER before getting married!''\n\nShe revealed that both of her sons are in live-in relationships. ''It just seems logical to me that before two people get their families and the government involved in their equation, they first put their relationship to the ultimate test,'' she reasoned. The actress further gave logical reasons to back live-in relationships.\n\n''It’s easy to be the best version of yourself for a few hours a day. But can you share a bathroom? Weather the storm of a bad mood? Agree on what to eat for dinner every night? Keep the fire alive in the bedroom? Work through the million tiny conflicts that inevitably arise between two people in close proximity? In short - are you actually compatible?'' Zeenat Aman wrote.\n\nALSO SEE: Zeenat Aman Says Her 'Face Puckered' After Neetu Kapoor Won The Hamper On Koffee With Karan S8; 'Next Time...'\n\nZeenat Aman is one of the greatest actresses of the 70s Bollywood. She took over Indian cinema by playing unconventionally bold roles on-screen. Her interviews from the 70s also reflected several liberal thoughts that were met with criticism by the conservative audience. Needless to say, Zeenat Aman is the last person to care about 'Log kya kahenge?'.\n\nShe concluded her note by writing, ''I’m aware that Indian society is a little uptight about “living in sin” but then again, society is uptight about so many things! Log kya kahenge?''. Her advice divided the internet. While many agreed with her, some also bashed her for her 'westernized' views.\n\nALSO SEE: KWK: Neetu Kapoor's Marriage Advise To Alia Bhatt; Zeenat Aman Recalls Receiving Fan Letters Written In Blood\n\nCover Image: Sourced"
