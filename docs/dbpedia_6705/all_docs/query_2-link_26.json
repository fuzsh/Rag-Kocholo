        "text": "Veteran Bollywood actor Mumtaz feels actor Zeenat Aman should be mindful of what she promotes on social media. Mumtaz's comment came after Zeenat wrote a post on Instagram promoting live-in relationships. \"Zeenat should be careful what she is advising,\" said Mumtaz.\n\nWhile talking to an entertainment portal, Mumtaz asserted, \"If girls adopt the live-in culture, marriage as an institution will become obsolete. Tell me honestly, would you marry your son to a girl whom you know to have been in a live-in relationship? Aap Zeenat ko hi le lo misaal ke taur par (Take Zeenat for example). She knew Mazhar Khan for years before marrying him. Her marriage was a living hell. She should be the last person doling out advice on relationships.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn her Instagram post a few days back, Zeenat wrote, \"If you’re in a relationship, I strongly recommend that you LIVE TOGETHER before getting married! (sic).\"\n\nZeenat married actor Mazhar Khan in October 1985 and welcomed their first son in October 1986. However, in an old interview, she shared that she realised she had \"made a mistake\" by marrying Mazhar in the first year of her marriage itself. “The only reason to get married is to have a family. I felt ready at the time,\" Zeenat told Simi Grewal on her talk show, Rendezvous with Simi Grewal.\n\nHowever, Mumtaz, who has been married for over 40 years to businessman Mayur Madhvani, took a dig at Zeenat as she said that the veteran star is doing anything to be perceived as 'cool' among young people.\n\n\"Zeenat should be careful with what she is advising. She has all of a sudden come into this huge social media popularity, and I can understand her excitement about sounding like a cool aunty. But giving advice that is counter to our moral values is not the solution to increasing your following,” Mumtaz was quoted as saying.\n\nContrary to what Zeenat advised in her social media post, Mumtaz, popular for her roles in films like 'Do Raaste', 'Sachcha Jhootha', 'Aap Ki Kasam', and 'Roti', suggested one should never get married.\n\nShe said, \"Kitna bhi live-in kar lo, kya guarantee hai (What is the assurance that even after living-in together your marriage will be a success)? Main toh kehti hoon, marriage hi nahin honi chahiye. What is the need to tie yourself down in this day and age? Why marry? For children? Arrey, go out there, find the man who appeals to you, and get his baby without physical intimacy. Zamana bahot aage chala gaya hai (the society had evolved).”\n\nWhile promoting live-in relationships in her social media post, Zeenat Aman also mentioned Indian society's reservations about the setup. She concluded her post with the words, \"I’m aware that Indian society is a little uptight about “living in sin” but then again, society is uptight about so many things! Log kya kahenge? (What will people say?)\n\nZeenat Aman will be making her comeback to movies with the film 'Bun Tikki', which will see her share screen space with Abhay Deol and Shabana Azmi."
