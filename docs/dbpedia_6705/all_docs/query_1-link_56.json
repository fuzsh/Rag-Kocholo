        "text": "New Delhi: With the Hindi flicks Ittefaq and Do Raaste, actor Bindu made her film debut. Additionally, she is recognised for the well-known cabaret song Mera Naam Shabnam from Kati Patang (1970). Recently, the veteran actress named Zeenat Aman as the co-star who was most likely to flirt with other co-stars on set. She also apologised for naming her.\n\nBindu last appeared on the big screen fifteen years ago. The actor's most recent films were Mehbooba (2008), Om Shanti Om (2007), and Main Hoon Na (2004). Zeenat seems to be making a comeback as an actor, in contrast to Bindu who has retired. In February 2023, the actor joined Instagram for the first time. As of now, she has close to 300,000 followers. This year, she will also be seen in the web series' Showsttopper and Margaon: The Closed Case.\n\nThe seasoned actor Bindu was questioned about the co-star who was most likely to flirt with other co-stars on set during a recent rapid-fire segment of an interview with Bollywood Hungama. Bindu named Zeenat Aman and also apologised, \"Sorry Zeenat ji.\" Prem Shastra (1974), Chor Ke Ghar Chor (1978), Laawaris (1981), and Bandhan Kuchchey Dhaagon Ka (1983) are among the films in which the two actors have worked together during their illustrious acting careers.\n\nFurthermore, Bindu mentioned that back when she was at the peak of her career, she received a tonne of fan mail, including one crazed supporter who wrote her messages in his own blood. She claimed she never handled the letters directly. In the same interview, she shared, \"Woh banda apne khoon se mujhe letters likhta tha. Aur jab letter bhi aate the, haath lagane ka dil nahi hota tha (He used to write me letters in his own blood. And whenever the letters arrived, I didn't feel like touching them either). His blood group was also written down. He was so mad fellow. I didn't answer back. If he would have continued, I would have had to go to the police. I remember it till today.)\""
