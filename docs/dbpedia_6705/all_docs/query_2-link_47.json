        "text": "BY RAMNATH N PAI RAIKAR | NT NETWORK\n\nThe very mention of Zeenat Aman conjures colourful images of various characters she enacted in Hindi films during the 1970s, all of which epitomised what she represented on the silver screen – A sex symbol and a fashion icon, having become the first lead actress to do so in Bollywood.\n\nThe revolutionary actress, who has stayed away from the silver screen for more than two decades with the exception of small roles in flicks ranging from 'Boom' (2003) to 'Dunno Y… Na Jaane Kyon' (2010), was present at the recently concluded THINK fest held in Goa. Still displaying the effervescent energy and free spirit, that was once reflected in her performances, she fondly looked back at her career.\n\n\"I never planned to arrive in the film world with the image of an Westernised girl; the fact is that I was just the right person, who arrived at the right time, in the right role,\" Zeenat recalled, stating that the role of a disenchanted sister who gets involved with the 'Flower Power' movement in Nepal, fell into her lap after a number of actresses refused it in Dev Anand's 1972 blockbuster, 'Hare Rama Hare Krishna'.\n\n\"I had returned from California after completing my studies, and had even managed to win the Miss India title in 1970, just when the offers from filmmakers started coming,\" Zeenat said, informing that small roles in 1971 films like 'Hulchal' and 'Hungama' were followed by a role in the Dev Anand film, which even fetched her a Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award. \"I had been in California for my studies, and was already witness to the hippy culture there,\" she mentioned, pointing out that her performance in 'Hare Rama Hare Krishna' was very much inspired.\n\n\"The audiences liked me, and as nothing succeeds like success, the filmmakers wanted to repeat me in similar glamorous, Westernised role,\" Zeenat maintained, lamenting that though she had author-backed roles in films like 'Satyam Shivam Sundaram' and 'Insaaf Ka Tarazu', they were unfortunately overlooked in terms of broad perspective. \"And then I was a director's actress, having not been able to attend any acting school,\" she said, observing that she always delivered what was expected from her by the directors, with the fortune of finding maximum directors, who had already been actors.\n\nDev Anand ('Hare Rama Hare Krishna', 'Heera Panna', 'Ishq, Ishq, Ishq'), Raj Kapoor ('Satyam Shivam Sundaram'), Manoj Kumar ('Roti, Kapda aur Makan'), Sanjay Khan ('Abdullah'), Feroz Khan ('Qurbani'), Vijay Anand ('Ram Balram') and O P Ralhan ('Hulchal') were some of the actor-directors, who groomed Zeenat Aman and according to her brought best out of her.\n\nInterestingly, despite her Western features, Zeenat never made it to Hollywood. \"The fact is that I never made a conscious effort to approach the Hollywood producers,\" the senior actress said, adding that lot of work approached her here, at the peak of her career. \"And then one should not forget that the phenomenon of globalisation was far away,\" Zeenat noted, drawing attention to the fact that cable television, cell phones, e-mail and other advanced means of communications remained yet to be introduced. \"As also I never had an agent who would represent me in Hollywood,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"However, I did get a chance to act with an international cast in the film 'Shalimar', which had both Hindi and English versions,\" Zeenat informed, further remembering that early in her career, she also acted in the Hindi remake of the Hollywood musical, 'Irma la Douce', reprising the role of a hooker as played by Shirley MacLaine. \"The film was 'Manoranjan' and actor, Shammi Kapoor had turned director with this film,\" she recalled, stating that working in the film was an interesting experience and she found a sense of expression through the film.\n\nReminiscent of her favourite films, Zeenat said that 'Insaaf ka Tarazu' had its director, B R Chopra providing her with a perfect script, which had a strong woman-oriented subject, narrating the tale of injustice and revenge. \"On the other hand, 'Satyam Shivam Sundaram' had a concept of duality, which I liked very much,\" she mentioned, \"Besides getting an opportunity to work with a master, a craftsman of cinema – Raj Kapoor.\"\n\nZeenat also admitted that almost all her films had wonderful music and the voice of Asha Bhonsle was a perfect fit for her. Right from 'Phoolon ka taaron ka' ('Hare Rama Hare Krishna') to 'Chura liya hai' ('Yaadon ki Baarat'), 'Panna ki tamanna' ('Heera Panna') to 'Main na bhoolunga' ('Roti, Kapda aur Makan') and 'Ishwar satya hai' ('Satyam Shivam Sundaram') to 'Do lafzon ki hai' ('The Great Gambler'), the actress had amazing songs. \"Most of my songs such as 'Hum dono do premi' ('Ajanabee') formed the crest of the music of Pancham (Rahul Dev Burman),\" she said, pointing out that though 'Aap jaisa koi' song from the film 'Qurbani' was hugely popular, she just cannot choose her favourite song from the rainbow of melodies in her films.\n\n\"Interestingly, many of my songs have been re-done or re-mixed, and the new generation kids watching these versions just enjoy calling me Zeenie baby,\" Zeenat said, stating that she really felt flattered, when recently she was chosen as the sexiest Bollywood star of all time. \"I was happier because I had to compete with the present day actresses,\" said the actress credited for laying the blueprint for the sexier heroines, who dominate Bollywood today. Reacting to the trend of every other modern-day actress turning into glamour doll, Zeenat said that she did not believe in present generation actresses becoming content with glitzy persona. \"There have been capable actresses in recent times; some of the fine talent,\" she observed, adding that actresses like Madhuri Dixit and Aishwarya Rai were able to deliver in traditional roles, and if essential, went on to portray even Westernised roles.\n\nShocked at the irony of India being presently divided into glamorous, Page 3 culture on one side; and suffering, poor people on the other, the senior actress said that she was shocked to hear about the atrocities committed on the tribal in the country, especially in Chhattisgarh. \"The media should address these issues and expose such atrocities,\" she observed, maintaining that justice is required at all levels in the country.\n\nOn the parting note Zeenat said, \"Believe in yourself, and do the things for you as you feel.\""
