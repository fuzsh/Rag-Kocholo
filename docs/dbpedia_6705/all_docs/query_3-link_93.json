        "text": "Veteran actress Zeenat Aman who recently made her Instagram debut had been sharing many interesting posts with her followers.\n\nThe actress took to her Instagram on Thursday and shared a picture of herself dressed in a gorgeous back and white polka dot dress paired with a black ballerina, glasses, and handbag. She completed her look by accessorising with a golden chain, bracelet, rings and earrings.\n\nSharing the picture, the actress spoke about 'privacy' in a witty manner. She wrote, \"A quick picture in the foyer before heading to a friend’s birthday party the other night. I know you may want to ask me which friend, so I will give you an answer about privacy.\"\n\nShe continued saying, \"I think there’s a fine line between a healthy interest in a public figure or a person you admire, and an entitlement or desire to know every detail of their lives. The former is wonderful and that on which artists and audiences thrive. The latter is a drag for everyone involved and, in my view, keeps us from approaching new ideas and a higher level of conversation.\"\n\n\"The world is so spectacularly diverse and rich, I promise you there are more interesting things to learn than which celebrity met whom and where. Just a thought,\" she wrote concluding the note.\n\nSee Also: Zeenat Aman shares throwback pic from Satyam Shivam Sundaram and reacts to accusations of obscenity"
