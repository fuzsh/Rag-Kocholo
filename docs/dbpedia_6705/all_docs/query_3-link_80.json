Every time I drape a saree, I'm taken back to the sunlit corner of my childhood home where my mother, a revered linguistics professor, transformed gracefully as she chose her saree for the day. It was more than attire; it was a ritual, a cherished silent conversation. 🌸 I was mesmerised by the delicate dance of her hands—tucking, pleating, arranging the fabric with magical ease. The rustle of silk, mixed with her jasmine perfume, created an aura of elegance and strength. Her fan following, especially evident during her bustling birthday gatherings, was a testament to her altruistic personality. On my tenth birthday, she wore a saree woven with gold threads. Catching my admiring gaze, she smiled and let me drape her dupatta over my shoulders. It felt like I was wearing a cape that day – a mantle of history, beauty, and power. Years have passed since those cherished mornings; I lost her too early when I was just 15. Yet, the love for sarees she instilled in me endures. To me, a saree is not just a garment but a narrative of resilience, a canvas of artistry, and a testament to the strength that women like her exhibit every day. How do the traditions from your past inspire your leadership today? It is your personal stories that shape your unique leadership style.

When my first child was born. I recall my mother taking into work sweets and cakes to celebrate the birth of her first grandson. Whilst everyone congratulated her, it was the South-Asian women who openly congratulated her for having a grandson. When my daughter was born, my mother brought in even more cakes and sweets, and the same women asked why so many as she was only a girl. The mood was quieter and less celebratory. It’s this in-ate mentality that may just rub off onto our confidence and ability to shine in the workplace. We are just as important and can achieve as much and more as our brothers. Even in a place like Goa where my heritage is from, where there is a heavy westernised influence due to Portuguese colonialism, we still appear to have a mentality that “girls are only girls” despite what they achieved. I am sorry mother, but you may also had a part to play in this. Despite the times I told her I have a busy job, at a senior level, she still asks “What are you cooking for your husband tonight?” The annoying part is that I may have grown to expect that this is my role despite the busyness of my life and the seniority of my leadership roles at work, and I automatically do it like a programmed robot, and then complain afterwards. Is it because I am just a girl and have duties and tasks that should belong to me. But this subservience may have filtered into my work life. I see it where I allow others to speak before me. I see it when I allow others to choose the projects they want to work on. It’s time to recognise that culture impacts the way we show up in our careers. As part of South Asian Heritage Month be the woman and girl you really are. Be free to be you.

Everyone likes quoting and referring themselves to the proverbs 31 woman or a virtuous woman in Bible without talking about how she got to that place. The way she lived her life reveals an answer – she developed wisdom, and as a result, her household was peaceful and productive. There is a shift required when you are ready to become a virtuous woman, and even in this – the Bible provides a roadmap. One of my mentors always states that there is a difference between being a \"girl\" and being a \"woman.\" She says that “just because you're a female of a certain age doesn't mean that you qualify to be a woman - a woman is someone who has cultivated her spirit and mind with wisdom in key areas of life.” A woman embodies the qualities that she wants to experience in the people around her. A female who is still a \"girl\" carries an expectation that other people should have the qualities that she needs for them to have, whether she has them or not. She can talk to people “any kind of way” but gets mad when other people do the same to her. She can be a poor financial steward with a career that doesn't inspire her but expects her husband to love his job and manage assets well. The results that a “girl” receives in her life will consistently reflect her lack of wisdom. How did the virtuous woman get to where she was? I don’t believe she was born with the title “the virtuous woman”. I would suggest that she didn’t rely on her definition of beauty, but instead, relied on God to develop beauty in her. She released control, leaned into God, and she asked for wisdom. When she was directed by God to take the next step, she probably took that next step more times than she did not. When you cultivate yourself as a woman, you boldly take responsibility for asking God what he needs from you, as well as answering the questions God is asking you. There is a shift required, and if you're ready to receive better results, are you ready to try God’s plan? Think about the cultivation areas you want to focus on today and pray to God, asking Him for guidance. It is a long term process. #Cultivatingyourselftobeavirtouswoman #beawoman\n\nI'm Gen Z, and of course, I had to jump on this challenge! 😂 You know that feeling when energy suddenly surges within you from nowhere, and that task you've been procrastinating on suddenly becomes a must-do?

My first reaction was repulsion, because this is not how I or most of India imagines Indian women 😕, not in any chauvinistic sense or women's rights limiting thought... This senseless replication of the pattern of beauty pageants in the west is uncalled for because it doesn't fit in our social context, it is not warranted, it is distasteful, because in India we are taught to view our women like goddesses(at least in cultured houses like mine) this display of flesh is repulsive😕😒 But then on second thoughts I thought this has already infiltrated our Bollywood film industry 🙄 but then this phenomenon begets the thought, if you are so openly completely on display... Do you really have the right to complain about casting couch? Because you are already consentually using your body as a tool to further your career and get material gains, when you are renting your body out. Which means that you only cry foul when you do not derive the desired benefits in exchange of giving the right to use your body as a prop I wish we don't follow western templates blindly Also not all of these participants will be the winner of the pageant, some of them will enter corporate jobs... Then is it really inexcusable for their male bosses or colleagues to make sexual advances towards them? I think the answer to that (from my standpoint of being from a cultured family that respects women as goddesses) is sure you have the right to express your feelings and interest in the lady if you are her acquaintance or have the opportunity to introduce yourself to her, but if she does not encourage the contact.. Respectfully accept her decision treat her as a book you read because she was on display in the public library, wanted to own, but wasn't available! And that's it... Don't be obsessive or intrusive. Don't be a creep! 😖 https://lnkd.in/d-zKa74A"
