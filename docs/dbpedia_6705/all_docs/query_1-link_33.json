        "text": "In a delightful stroll down memory lane, Bollywood actress Zeenat Aman recently took to social media to share a heartfelt glimpse into her past, reminiscing about the endearing pet names she's been affectionately called throughout her life.\n\nZeenat Aman shares heartwarming childhood memories and pet names; says, “Dev saab started to refer to me as ‘Zeenie’”\n\nSharing a picture of herself, Zeenat wrote, “Childhood pet names can be sticky things. As a little girl I was the apple of my father’s eye, and he used to lovingly call me Babusha. A name that emerged as a go-between Babushka and Babugosha. He had quite the sense of humour because Babushka, which refers to an old Russian lady, and Babugosha, which refers to a pear, are hardly apt monikers for one’s daughter!”\n\nRecalling her pet names, Zeenat wrote, “My childhood friends, many of whose parents would socialise with my own, were quick to pick up on this nickname. In their mouths, Babusha evolved into Babs, which is how my earliest friends still know me. Later of course Dev saab started to refer to me as ‘Zeenie’, and then the media concocted ‘Zeenie baby’. Both of which stuck. Now that I’m too old for younger people on set to refer to me as either of those, I’m also called ZA or Zee.”\n\nThe actress further added, ““Home names” are such a wonderful sign of love and intimacy. I took a leaf out of my father’s book, and both my boys received pet names soon after their birth. The older is Azaanchu, and the younger Zanuski.”\n\nThe actress concluded by saying, “If you have an odd or funny or unique pet name, I’d love to hear the story behind it in the comments!”\n\nZeenat Aman is an Indian actress and a former model. The Evil Within (1970), starring Dev Anand, marked the former beauty queen's acting debut. She has acted in films like Yaadon Ki Baarat, Satyam Shivam Sundaram, Qurbani, Dharam Veer, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Insaaf Ka Tarazu among others. The actress will soon return to the silver screen with Faraz Arif Ansari’s next, Bun Tikki. The film will also feature Shabana Azmi. As per reports, the plan is to take the movie on floors by November of this year in Himachal Pradesh. The director plans to talk about parenting and gender identity throughout the movie. Abhay Deol will play the role of a father in the film.\n\nAlso Read: 100 Years of Dev Anand: Zeenat Aman pens heartfelt note for “Stylish, suave and prolific” actor; says, “He was a dynamo beyond…”\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES"
