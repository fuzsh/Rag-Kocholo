        "meta_description": "Zeenat Aman has revealed that she has been suffering from ptosis for the past 40 years and delved into her experience of dealing with it. While discussing her battle with the condition at length, the veteran actress took to her Instagram handle and gave a health update, stating that she has been recovering slowly lately. She dropped a couple of photos from the hospital room and penned a long note that read, 'There has been an elephant in the room with me for the past 40 years. It is time to show this elephant the door. I have a condition known as ptosis - the result of an injury I suffered many decades ago that damaged the muscles around my right eye. Over the years, it caused my eyelid to droop further and further. And a few years ago it became so acute that it began to obstruct my vision.' She also added how it was tough for her to come to terms with the condition as it affected her appearance, narrowing down her opportunities. 'When so much of one’s career is predicated on one’s appearance, coming to terms with a dramatic change to it is difficult. I know for a fact that this ptosis narrowed my opportunities and made me the subject of unwanted attention', said the 'Don' actress. She concluded the note by sharing, 'Recovery has been slow, steady and is ongoing. But I’m happy to share that my vision is so much clearer now.' For more news and updates, stay tuned to ETimes.",
