        "text": "Zeenat Aman is one of the most popular Indian actors to have ever graced the silver screen. Throughout her career, Aman played several roles that were considered ‘bold and brave’ for her time. Let’s take a look at some of them.\n\n1. Rupa in ‘Satyam Shivam Sundaram’\n\nSource: YouTube/Shemaroo\n\nIn the movie, Aman’s character is a simple, village girl whose right cheek and parts of the neck have serious burn scars. However, despite the trauma, she stays hopeful in life and even falls in love and gets married. Aman’s costumes and character in the film were considered bold and ahead of her time but it remains one of the most iconic roles in the history of Indian cinema.\n\n2. Jasbir/Janice in ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’\n\nSource: YouTube/Shemaroo Bollygoogly\n\nSure Don is an iconic Amitabh Bachchan movie, one that’s still loved and watched by movie buffs. In the film, Aman’s character sets out to exact revenge from Don for killing her brother. She shines as the sharp and strong woman who packs as much punch as Bachchan’s character.\n\n4. Sunita in ‘Yaadon Ki Baaraat’\n\nSource: YouTube/bollyoldisgold\n\nA young, lovestruck Aman playing the guitar will be forever etched in the memories of cinema lovers. In this movie about estranged brothers, she plays the role of one of the leading man’s love interests. While you may or may not remember the movie, there’s no way one can forget this iconic song that became one of the landmarks of Aman’s career.\n\n5. Sheela in ‘Qurbani’\n\nSource: YouTube/Gaane Sune Ansune\n\nUnless you have been living under a rock, there’s no way you’d have missed this song that’s synonymous with Aman. In the movie, the actress plays the role of a bar dancer and Feroz Khan’s character’s love interest. While there’s nothing to write home about the movie in general, Aman shined through her performance.\n\nThese are some of our favourite Zeenat Aman movies. Which one’s yours? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nSocial and lead image credit: R. K. Studio, Raj-Baug Loni; and Dev Anand\n\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news."
