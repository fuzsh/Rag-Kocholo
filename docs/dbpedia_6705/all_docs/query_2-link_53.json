        "text": "Bollywood actor Zayed Khan, who has been a part of films like ‘Main Hoon Na’, opened up about his father Sanjay Khan's alleged affair with Zeenat Aman. Sanjay Khan and Zeenat Aman’s affair was publicised during the 80s, but they both refrained from accepting it or making it official in public. Talking about it, Zayed admitted that the 70s and 80s was the ‘Wild Wild West’ of Bollywood with something happening at every actor’s house.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“It wasn’t just at my dad’s house but was happening in every actor’s house,” Zayed said in an interview with Zoom. He added, “Every person was highly eccentric except one or two oddballs who were really sincere and grounded; the rest of them... phew! When I was young, I used to see these guys partying and dressing up in those jazzy Versace shirts and their things. It was a whole different era back then. They were real personalities.”\n\nWhat was highly publicised was the rumour of Sanjay Khan publicly hitting Zeenat Aman at a gathering, that left her with an eye injury that still has its effect on the actor.\n\nHowever, Sanjay Khan denied it and told Hrishikesh Kannan on his podcast that he ‘never slapped her’, calling Zeenat’s accusations a ‘PR attack against him which came like a blitzkrieg’. Addressing the accusations, he claimed that in Zeenat’s case, it was ‘hereditary’ and that the ‘facts were totally, radically opposite’.\n\nHe had said, “If you see ’81, ’82, ’83, ’84, she did several films. There is evidence that she had perfect eyes. Later in life, she became a little squint because her mother was a bit squint. It was a hereditary thing that was labelled on me. I never slapped her, and this was blasphemy.”\n\nZeenat Aman also recently addressed her eye injury, saying that she suffers from ptosis. “There has been an elephant in the room with me for the past 40 years. It is time to show this elephant the door. I have a condition known as ptosis - the result of an injury I suffered many decades ago that damaged the muscles around my right eye. Over the years, it caused my eyelid to droop further and further. And a few years ago it became so acute that it began to obstruct my vision (sic),” she had written on Instagram. She also underwent a surgery in April 2023."
