        "text": "OREN Peli’s low-budget 2009 horror Paranormal Activity was a welcome injection of adrenaline to the horror genre.\n\nMade for a reported $15,000 and shot in the Israeli-born film-maker’s home, the first film grossed almost $200m worldwide, giving birth to a franchise that has churned out sequels at a rate of one film per year.\n\nThis eagerly anticipated fourth chapter retains directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman and propels the narrative forwards five years after the events of Paranormal Activity 3.\n\nHowever, while Paranormal Activity 4 is unsettling and honours the established mythology, there’s very little here we haven’t jumped and shrieked at before, and the flimsy storyline doesn’t develop the characters.\n\nProtagonists are in the wrong place at the wrong time and their deaths are a mere interlude before the inevitable fifth film, which is apparently in the works for Halloween next year.\n\nAt the end of the third film, set in 2006, Katie (Katie Featherston) killed her sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) and made off into the night with her baby nephew, Hunter.\n\nThey disappear from Carlsbad, California, without trace. Years later we move to the leafy community of Henderson, Nevada, where plucky teenager Alice (Kathryn Newton) lives with her parents (Stephen Dunham, Alexondra Lee) and younger brother, Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp).\n\nWhen a single mother, who lives next door, is taken ill, Alice’s mother agrees to provide temporary refuge for the sick woman’s son, Robbie (Brady Allen). Alice quickly realises that there is something peculiar about the new arrival.\n\nParanormal Activity 4 has a few decent scares and a terrific piece of sustained tension with a missing kitchen knife. The centrepiece gimmick with the Xbox’s infrared motion-tracking dot matrix is incredibly neat but Joost and Schulman slightly overuse it.\n\nVisual tricks outweigh narrative treats but when the film screams ``Boo!”, we still jump."
