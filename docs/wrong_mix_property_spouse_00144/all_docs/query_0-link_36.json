        "text": "[Click here for a guide to Booze Revooze and the rating system used]\n\nFrom the juiced-box and the soundtrack: Rob Zombie – Dragula\n\nhttps://pjensi.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04-rob-zombie-dragula.mp3\n\n[Press ‘Play’ for a song they dance in the dark to]\n\nRamblings: Paranormal Re-Activity\n\nFinal Proof: 3 Shots\n\nYou know how you get drunk and possessed by beer farts? You start in on the spirits and you already know what’s going to happen even before you begin but sure enough after the first glass you feel the tension terrify your ass and it stresses you out a little bit but the beer is good and your having such a good time you don’t want to stop so you keep adding liquid fuel to the gas and when the bubble finally bursts at least its not a piece of shit plus the wind makes you jump and some moments are bigger than others and some really freak you out but in the end of your end it’s “no shart, no foul” and you walk shakily away just happy it didn’t stink. Paranormal Activity 4 is a lot like that flatulence.\n\ni heard what you were saying about this movie before i went and i didn’t listen but believed you anyway so i really expected not a whole hell of a lot. Now, i’m not saying y’all were wrong but i am saying you weren’t right. OK, just uttering the words “Paranormal Activity 4” is enough to make a toddler laugh but the fact it’s lost its cool factor doesn’t mean it’s not cool.\n\nWhat do i know about it? What do i know about it? Are you forgetting i’m the guy who’s reviewed Paranormal Activity 1, Paranormal Activity 2 and Paranormal Activity 3? (What can i say– i needed counting practice.) Basically, they get better as they go along and i mean the movies, not my reviews which kick it from the start and never let up.\n\nPA3 was the scariest of the series but instead of going one better, Paranormal 4 gasps and dies a little.\n\nFor those of you who want to see the movie but don’t remember what happened in the other Paranormals, here’s a cheat sheet for your lazy asses:\n\nParanormal Activity 1: (October 2006) Micah and Katie are harassed by a demon and record it on a digital camera.\n\nParanormal Activity 2: (Prequel: September 2006) Kristi (Katie’s younger sister), her husband and her hot step daughter are bugged by the same demon and record it on digital home security cameras.\n\nParanormal Activity 3: (Pre-prequel: 1998) Kristi and Katie are little girls and are stalked by a demon and their stepdad records it on videocassette camera.\n\nParanormal Activity 4: (Sequel: November 2011) A blonde teen is tormented by an evil Ben with hormones, but also an evil spirit and the neighbor kid from across the street. Her adventures are mostly recorded on webcams and an Xbox.\n\nYou probably want to know what doesn’t work here and i get that so i’ll tell you, but it’s mostly minor things. Like at the beginning, Alex (Kathryn Newton) films stupid things that no one would ever film in real life but it just happens to be what we need to see to understand what the fuck the movie is about. Once she sets up webcams to figure out what the fuck is happening in her house, it gets a little more logicaller.\n\nThe bottom line is that the movie was good enough to “scare” me. i mean, i wasn’t huddled down under the seat but i was definitely tense and sure, most of the frights came from “got you” moments when things jump at the screen and most of the suspense was knowing things were going to jump out at you and you had to wait for it, but there were some genuine moments of creepy eeriness and those made the movie worthwhile.\n\nKathryn Newton carried the movie well on her delicate shoulders and there were only a couple scenes where she had “actor in training” tattooed on her forehead. While we’re on that, i have to card Kathryn here because she’s only 15. [Meaning i won’t put pictures of her with the seductive shots of the other actresses and I won’t use any shots that are not obviously promotional shots from her team–nothing age inappropriate inside the Bar None, peeps.]\n\nBuzz Kills (Watch Out for Spoilers)\n\nSex: 1 Shot\n\nKatie Featherston is amazing because she gets thinner and younger with each movie. It doesn’t make any sense in the story, but there’s definitely something out of this world playing with that girl and i’m thinking it’s because she sold her soul to the devil. Just sayin’. Here’s what i’m on about.\n\nThere are some single shots of Katie filling my drawers at the bottom of this post. Scroll down until you hit the “Read More” link.\n\nPlaying Paranormal’s MILF (Mother I’d Like To Frighten) is Alexondra Lee who goes something like this:\n\nIMDB lists Sprague Grayden (Katie’s sister Kristi) as being in the movie but i didn’t know that she didn’t film any nude new scenes for Paranormal 4 until i saw the film because they only used footage from Paranormal 2. Fortunately for you, i’d already downloaded all the shots so you get some Sprague shots in your face whether you want it or not.\n\nWhatever, “Sprague” is still the coolest girl’s name ever and i’d so love to live naked with her for no other reason (except one or two) that we could have exchanges where i’d be all,\n\n“Hey, Sprage-un.”\n\nAnd she’d be all, “Dude…think of more cool nicknames for me.”\n\nSo i’d think for a minute and then i’d yell out,\n\n“Sprag-a-Muffin!”\n\nAhh, the good ol’ days we haven’t had yet. Check my drawers for more spare Sprague shots.\n\nFor those of you who are more into Incubus than Succubus, there’s the DILF (Dad i’d Like to Freak) Stephen Dunham.\n\nLet’s talk about the spark between Ben and Alex (Kathryn Newton, who is too young to be talked about here but apparently her character isn’t). While it’s mentioned she’s still a virgin, her Ben Pal is definitely interested in piercing that mystery. Problem is, in real life Kathryn is only 15 and Matt Shively (Ben) is 22. Has he not heard of ½ your Age + 7? [On another age related note, Katie Featherston plays Sprague Grayden’s older sister in the series, but IRL Katie is 2 years younger than her “younger sister”.]\n\nHere’s a bonus of this Frog Prince.\n\nDrink: ½ Shot\n\nNothing much to write home about, or here either for that matter. There were a couple references i jotted down in my notebook, though.\n\nDad drinks beer in front of the TV. Uses a glass.\n\nMom drinks wine. Uses a glass, too.\n\nRock & Roll: 3 Shots\n\nYeah, i’ll go all the way up to 3 shots on this. The movie starts off a little slow but then kicks in and that’s gotta be worth something, as does the fact they included Rob Zombie’s “Dragula” (as did i at the top of this post) so all in all i feel good about rounding up to 3 shots on this.\n\nBoring Technical Crap\n\nWritten by:\n\nChad Feehan – story\n\nChristopher Landon – screenplay\n\nDirected by: Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman\n\nStarring\n\nKatie Featherston – Katie\n\nKathryn Newton – Alex\n\nSprague Grayden – Kristi\n\nAlexondra Lee – Holly\n\nMatt Shively – Ben\n\nStephen Dunham – Doug\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf it’s between Paranormal Activity 4 and a bad movie, choose this one.\n\nHaven’t Had Your Fill of the Booze Revooze?
