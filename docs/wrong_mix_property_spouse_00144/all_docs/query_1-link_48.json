As any good profes- sor of religious studies would do, I made for the eathedral, as they are generally a foeal point historieally, arehiteeturally, and, frankly, now eeonomieally (in terms of tourists). The eathedral in Bareelona is no exeeption. A steady flow of tourists mixed with the oeeasional loeals, presumably those for whom this is their parish ehureh, their plaee of devotion, meditation and, very likely, long historieal assoeiation. For the tourists, however, it might well be just an interesting site along their route and another plaee to tarry in briefly before eheeking it off their “to see” list and moving on. Barely three bloeks away from this aneient plaee, however, is a very reeent shrine to a different sort of religion: the see- ond largest Apple retail outlet in Europe. It opened just a month ago. The eomparison between the two plae- es of “worship” were striking. At both, the “faithful” made their way up an imposing and steep flight of steps. (The Apple store is in an imposing granite monumental strue- ture that was formerly a bank and loeated on a major plaza.) At the door, the visitor is immediate- ly greeted by the equivalent of a verger — in this ease a well-groomed eoneierge, equipped with an iPad — strategieally plaeed to guide one through the faeility to ensure that the experienee is eomplete and satisfying in all respeets. I observed earefully as the “Appleites” (my name for the iFaithful) made their guided way through the saered spaee, stop- ping at the several “shrines” inside, bearing not the statues of the saints or apostles, but the ieons of teehnology. They eame with a brand association, many of them with their iPhone and/or iPad in hand, almost like their Rosary. But for what reason? Just to say they’d visited this retail trendsetter in northern Spain, or for a deeper sense of connection to the “true faith” that seems to be the common bond linking Apple product consumers the world over? What should I make of this, I wondered? Perhaps it’s just the liberated musings of a professor on vacation, but then, perhaps not. Will tourists still be at this new cathe- dral 900 years from now? Let’s muse on that together. Stephen Reno is executive director of Leadership New Hampshire and former chancellor of the University System of New Hampshire.

Courtesy photo. The Concord Planning Board recently signed off on site plans for a new retail project off Exit 17 of Interstate 93. According to a Con- cord Monitor article, the new proj- ect would entail a gas station, a Dunkin’ Donuts and a convenience store at the corner of Whitney and Hoit roads. Freedom Physical Therapy, at 219 Fisherville Road in Concord, is planning to celebrate its grand opening on Saturday, Oct. 27, from noon to 2 p.m. The celebration will include a petting zoo, children’s crafts and games, food and five- minute chair massages. Derry Americans for Prosperity-NH rolled back the price of gas at Klemm’s Mobile in Manchester for one day to $1.84 per gallon — the same price gas was four years ago, before President Barack Obama took office. According to the organization, it charged $1.84 per gallon to the first 150 customers between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 21. Money for neighborhoods and community center The Citizens Bank Foun- dation provided $85,000 for neighborhood revitalization and economie development in New Hampshire as part of its new Growing Communities ini- tiative, which is designed to foster neighborhood revitaliza- tion and economic development activities. The program is target- ing the Manchester Community Resource Center, along with the International Institute and the Berlin Main Street Program. The program is designed to invest in businesses and organizations that provide important servic- es and healthy food options, as a way to encourage shopping local, strengthening workforce development and creating jobs, according to Citizens Bank. The Manchester Community Center, to be located on Lake Avenue in the former Odd Fellows Hall, will receive $35,000. The reha- bilitated building is expected to be turned into a multi-service center to support education pro- grams and job training, as well as support services for immi- grants and refugees. • New program to assess offender risk: The state Depart- ment of Corrections is set to utilize a new risk assessment sys- tem to allow for better placement of offenders into rehabilitative and treatment programs, while they are incarcerated and after they are paroled or released. The new program, the Ohio Risk Assessment System, is an evi- dence-based practice geared toward successful offender re- entry, according to a state press release. “Training of staff in the use of the ORAS method will begin in October and is integral to imple- menting the second phase of the Justice Reinvestment Initiative that began in New Hampshire in 2010,” said Commissioner Wil- liam Wrenn, in a statement. “We are optimistic that this will help us define the appropriate needs of the offender population with the goal of lowering recidivism.” The new assessment pro- gram will help the department in a number of areas, includ- ing determining consistent meaning to rehabilitative treat- ment outcomes, reducing service duplication, defining potential treatment barriers, set- ting up an automatic tracking system for determining effec- tiveness of treatment, generating inmate-specific case plans and predicting the likelihood of re- arrest, the release said. Department of Corrections counselors and case manager, as well as probation and parole officers will be trained in the assessment and they will be responsible for training oth- er staff in its use. Funding for the training was made available by a grant from the Council of State Governments Bureau of Justice Assistance. Participants will also receive training in how to enhance communication with offenders so that they take more responsibility for their own actions, the release said. The new assessment program is a product of the Justice Rein- vestment Initiative, which was the result of a bipartisan multi- agency study to help reduce the prison population, decrease cor- rections costs, and lower the rate of recidivism while increasing public safety. • Students in the cold: Uni- versity of New Hampshire Manchester students are sleep- ing out on Thursday, Oct. 25. As part of the Warmth from the Millyard program to gener- ate donations of warm-weather clothing for the state’s home- less residents, UNH students and faculty will be sleeping outside by the river at Arms Park to raise awareness of homelessness and poverty in the state. Participants will try to solicit pledges for every hour they spend outside to raise money for The Way Home, Nashua Soup Kitchen and Shel- ter and the New Hampshire Food Bank. To date the Warmth from the Millyard project, which will run from Thursday, Oct. 26, to Friday, Nov. 16, and in which participants collect donations of winter jackets, hats, mittens, scarves, new long underwear and socks, has collected over 13,000 items of warm clothing, and has created over 100 com- munity partnerships. • West Bank stories: The Social Responsibility Committee of the Unitarian Uni- versalist Church of Manchester, in conjunction with the New Hampshire Veterans for Peace, will host a talk by lyad Burnat, the head of the Bil’in Popular Committee and a leader in the West Bank village’s non-violent popular resistance movement. The talk will take place on Mon- day, Nov. 5, at 7 p.m. at the church, 669 Union St., Manches- BEST WEEK ter. Since 2005 citizens of Bil’in have held weekly demonstra- tions against the building of the Israeli separation wall through the community’s agricultural lands and the steady encroach- ment of illegal settlements. Burnat is conducting a tour of America to tell stories of Bil’in and life in the West Bank.

John Lynch in a statement. “He served the people of New Hampshire well at the state level and in the U.S. Sen- ate, where among other issues, he worked to ensure our veterans received the benefits they deserved. His passing is truly a loss for New Hampshire.

That, along with a hotly contested presidential election, might be a big reason why national labor organizations, like the AFL-CIO, are targeting New Hampshire leading up to the Nov. 6 election. Historically, the AFL-CIO has been firmly behind Democratic candidates and initiatives. That hasn’t necessarily changed, but the organization is trying to focus less on candidates and parties and more on issues. “We decided we couldn’t just sit back and tie our fortunes to one candidate or another,” said Elizabeth Shuler, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO. Shuler visited New Hamp- shire’s Seacoast last weekend to energize voters and to recruit activists for canvassing efforts. “We had to build an infrastructure and do year-round mobilization, instead of just ramping up for an election and then trailing off after. So we decided to do some- thing different and we hope more effective in keeping people engaged....” After the 2010 election, an election in which Democrats lost across the board, the organization made the switch, Shuler said. In that sense, the AFL-CIO can focus on key points, while clearly finding com- mon ground with Democratic candidates, to mobilize voters and then to hold candidates accountable after an election. That should make for a more natural progression of the political process, Shuler said. “I feel like we’ve got the energy level up,” Shuler said. “For the most part, peo- ple are really concerned about jobs and the economy.” Shuler will visit eight or nine more states before the election. The AFL-CIO is target- ing six key battleground states, including New Hampshire, as well as 25 others with direct mail, phone calls and door-to-door visits. “We’ve been at it for a long time,” Shul- er said. “Our program started earlier than it ever has before. You do risk a burnout. ... I have been surprised in the last few weeks, traveling to see people and canvassing. There are definitely a lot of conversations happening worker to worker, and I think that’s the most effective.” Not just liealtli care When it comes to elections, women are often talked about in the context of health care and abortion. Candidates strive to get the “women vote” on Election Day. Dem- ocratic candidates in New Hampshire have charged that Repub- lican candidates are attacking women’s abilities to make their own health care deci- sions. It’s not a new political strategy. But it turns out that while, of course, women care about health care and abortion, they care about a lot more than that. When candidates, like just about all of them in New Hampshire, say this elec- tion is about jobs and the economy, there is really no argument there. The statement holds true for women too. “A lot has been made of the war on wom- en between the candidates and the gender gap,” Shuler said. “That women care about different things than men do. I think that’s true, but women are very much concerned about job opportunities. They care about the pay gap, pay equity.” “Women are paying attention, but not just exclusively to so-called women’s issues,” Shuler added. “But women are just as con- cerned about those pocketbook issues, just like everybody else.” The AFL-CIO is looking to organize the women’s vote in 2012. “We’re trying to move women to talk to other women,” Shuler said. “We really think it’s powerful to have someone in the work- place or in the neighborhood talking to you, someone who looks like you and is a wom- an as well.” Shuler said more and more women are concerned they are being pigeonholed with particular issues, like health care. Shuler said it’s not that health care issues aren’t impor- tant; they just aren’t the only things women care about. Trying to balance the demands of work and family — that’s the type of thing women, and today, all people care about it, Shuler said. Youngsters Since 2008, 16.8 million new young voters have registered to vote nationally. Groups are targeting those voters to make sure they hit the polls next month. The AFL-CIO is one of those groups. In 2008, young voters turned out in record numbers. One of the big questions is how energized young voters will be for this election. In 2008, young voters outnum- bered seniors at the polls. “Are you going to let seniors beat you?” Shuler laughed, as she referred to her remarks to young voters at a recent event.

And I have an innovation plan ... foeusing on ... ereating a skilled and strong workforee so that we ean have the best workforee in the eountry, that attraets big businesses here and also makes sure our young people are prepared for 21st-eentu- ry jobs. I am also talking ... about providing teehnieal assistanee to small businesses so that they ean grow. And also making sure that we have targeted tax eredits like the researeh and development tax eredit. [W]hat kind of governor are people looking for? First of all, I think we’re lueky to have had John Lyneh as governor for the past eight years, and I’m very proud that he endorsed me last week. And I worked very elosely with him, balaneing two state bud- gets and working on a lot of job ereation and job preservation efforts that have really helped the people of New Hampshire. And I think people want very mueh to eontinue along that path.... in a state like New Hamp- shire ... if you ean eome together ... we ean find ways to solve our problems. We ean do that without an ineome or a sales tax, whieh I opposed and I would veto. That’s the kind of governor I think folks are looking for. When you look back on your time in the Senate, what are some key accomplish- ments that come to mind? In my very first term when I was a mem- ber of the minority party, I worked with Demoerats and Republieans ... we man- aged to get a very misguided law repealed that had allowed insuranee eompanies to dis- eriminate against state workers. ... The New Hampshire Working program is something I sponsored and worked on with Gov. Lyneh that helped businesses and workers. ... And I’m very proud of the role I played in passing marriage equality here in New Hampshire. I managed to bring people together in our Senate eaueus ... so we got more and more support for it. I’m very, very proud of the faet that we have marriage equality ... and what it signifies ... not only about the eivil rights of all of our eitizens, but also about the faet that we’re a plaee Courtesy photo. weleomes all people. If you are elected, what ... would be your goals? I really want to make sure that we are foeusing on ... our sehools, our apprentiee- ships, our eareer and teehnieal sehools ... improving standards ... beginning to restore the euts to the eommunity eollege and uni- versity system that were made. But I also want to make sure that we freeze tuition if we’re going to restore those euts. Remem- ber, this legislature eut signifieantly, 50 pereent university system, about 30 per- eent to the eommunity eollege system, while they also eut the eigarette tax. They might as well have said to young people, ‘Smoke more, study less.’ ...

What are [voters] most con- m m ^ cerned about? % Three issues eome up eon- '^^^stantly: jobs, jobs and jobs. It’s all about the eeonomy. There is a lot of anxiety among the people, even people with jobs. A lot of them are underemployed. ... There are peo- ple who are eoneemed about whether or not their business is going to ... survive. ... We’re still down 30,000 jobs from the time at the start of the great reeession in 2008 into 2009. ... They’re eoneemed for their ehildren. ... We’re losing the New Hampshire advantage beeause of some of the failed polieies implemented by and ehampioned by my opponent, Maggie Hassan, while she was in the legislature as the majority leader in the state Senate. What kind of governor are people look- ingfor? I think people are looking for a governor like I will be, someone who does two things. One is to be very mueh like John Lyneh, [to be] available to them. I’ll be present at nat- ural disasters, fires and floods, plaees where you’d expect the governor to take a man- agement role. I’ll be at the celebrations, ribbon-cuttings and activities in the civic and charitable world, and I do that anyway in my private life. ... And like John Lynch, I’ll be accessible to the people. ... But I’ll also bring this to the governor’s office: real leadership. ... And that’s why I’ve taken a number of pledges. It’s called Ovide’s Oath. ... One of the pledges is to sign or veto any bill that comes to my desk. ... The constitu- tion of New Hampshire allows the governor to sit back and let bills pass and become law without his signature. Gov. Lynch has done that on a number of occasions on some pret- ty significant bills. I won’t do that. I will sign or veto any bill that comes to me. That means the burden will be on me to work with our legislative leadership to make sure that the bills that are being written and passed are ones I can support. How well would you be able to work with both Republicans and Democrats? Very well. People who work with me, beginning with my own law firm — I’m owner of one of the largest law firms in the state — some of the other sharehold- ers and owners are not conservatives or Republicans ... but when we find we have a shared goal ... we’re able Courtesy photo. work together. ... it won’t matter to me whether you’re a Democrat or Libertari- an or independent or Republican, if you have a problem or if you have a solution to a state problem, then come into the office and work with me and I’ll work with you. Why are you qualified for this job? ... If you believe, as I think most of the people of New Hampshire believe, that the challenges facing our state are about jobs and the economy, then as a business law- yer and a business owner, and someone who has been chairman of the board of St. Mary’s Bank, the nation’s first credit union, I bring real-world business experience that my oppo- nent does not have. I also bring experience, in government as chairman of the state Board of Education, legal counsel for the state Sen- ate, a member of the New Hampshire Judicial Council, about how government works and should work in New Hampshire. And I bring experience in the civil and charitable world, which partners with government to deliver a safety net for our citizens and to improve the HIPPO I OCTOBER 25 - 31, 2012 I PAGE 10 Planned Parenthood and also fertility treat- ment. Just last night, a man I was talking to said ... he and his wife had struggled to have a ehild and ... went through extensive fertil- ity treatment and now they have a daughter and they have a family and they’re building their future together. And under my oppo- nent’s vision and agenda — he sides with this very extreme agenda that has tried to outlaw abortion and would limit ... things like fertility treatment — that family would be left out. ... I aetually traveled on a plane reeently with a guy who is a reeruiter for a major employer in New Hampshire. He told me marriage equality was the best reeruit- ing tool he had. And that’s beeause it signals to the rest of the eountry and our potential workforee that we’re a plaee that weleomes all eontributions from everybody. ... And that’s really important for the future of our eeonomy. Are we at a time when we need more bipartisans h ip ? I think bipartisanship is ineredibly important. ... I’m very proud of the faet that I worked on two budgets with Gov. Lyneh ...to balanee the budget in extraordinari- ly diffieult eireumstanees, and we did it without an ineome or a sales tax, whieh I oppose. We ereated a eompromise budget that made tough deeisions and eut spend- ing but also proteeted the people of New Hampshire. ... [W]hat we do in Coneord is about problem solving and eompromise. ... “go it alone” never solves problems. Why should people vote for you? ... I’m running for governor beeause I want every family to have an opportu- nity to sueeeed. ... My husband Tom and I have raised two ehildren in Exeter. My 24-year-old son is a wonderful young man and happens to have severe physieal dis- abilities and it was New Hampshire’s way of ineluding Ben in eommunity and in sehools, making it possible for us to have him live with us at home, that signaled to my family and me what a partieularly spe- eial plaee New Hampshire is and how well we all do when we work together. I have spent my adult life as a business lawyer, and as a mother, and as a state senator bringing people together to find eommon-sense solu- tions to eomplieated problems. And I have a reeord of results in the state senate.... We brought kindergarten to every family in the state of New Hampshire, something, by the way, that my opponent opposes. We ... bal- aneed the budget in extraordinarily diffieult times, working together to do that. But we kept unemployment low. We kept our tax burden one of the lowest in the eountry.

I am pledg- ing to New Hampshire voters that I will present a balaneed budget without raising any taxes. My opponent ... has a reeord of tax-raising that’s really extraordinary. She’s never voted against a tax inerease and sup- ported over 99 taxes and fee hikes in the mere six years she was a state legislator..., whieh is why I think . . . her own eonstituents vot- ed her out of office in 2010, because she was wrong on taxes, she was wrong on spend- ing, which was high, and she was wrong on the policies that killed jobs in this state. How different is [the political tone] compared to 2010? I would say that ... there has been a lot more third-party advertising, largely because of the presidential race and large- ly because New Hampshire is such a swing state ... We estimate that there has already been more than $3 million of negative advertising against me since the primary. And that amount is climbing substantially over the final stretch of this campaign. Why should people vote for you? I would hope people would vote for me because they see in me the experience and the vision and the plan in my prosperity agenda to move our state forward. That they would know me as ... a fourth-generation New Hampshire native, who not only under- stands the state and our people, but who is committed to build on the good things that are here because it’s part of who I am. ... I live in the same east side Manchester house that I grew up in. I think people look at you in terms of your life experience — my par- ents have been my next-door neighbors for 26 years.

Clean trails Twenty- five volunteers spent Wednesday cleaning the Nashua Her- itage Rail Trail, including children and adults from Nashua PAL and eight students from Daniel Webster College. At the end of the day, roughly a dozen bags of trash and a trailer full of cut branches and leaves were pulled from the area, stretching about 300 feet, as report- ed in the Nashua Telegraph. QOL score: +2 Comment: If a city proposal to buy additional land goes through, the trail could extend to an east-west walking trail, right through Nashua, the article said. Eek! This is what we get for warmer weather: stink bugs and mice. Busi- ness owners credit the mild winter and rainy spring for a boom in rodent populations in New England, including mice, squirrels, chip- munks and everything else you don’t want running around in your house. This is always the time of year for such pests, but some pest management services are seeing up to 40 percent more calls for mice troubles in than in recent years, according to the Eagle Tribune.

Secondary issues are important to Patriot Nation SPORTS DAVE LONG’S LONGSHOTS ^ Patriot Nation is once ^ again apoplectic over the state of the secondary and the strain it puts on the front seven and especially the offense to score a lot of points because, as in the last two Sundays vs. Seattle and the Jets, no lead seems to be safe. What’s worse is that it’s not a new problem. It’s an old one that they just can’t seem to solve — an odd circumstance when the guy in charge made his bones on that side of the ball, don’t you think? Who as far back as the mid-1980s has been called a defensive “genius.” Of course, when that rep was building he was just scheming the defense and not picking the groceries. That was done by a brilliant personnel guy named George Young who handed Coach B a linebacker core of Law- rence Taylor, Carl Banks, Harry Carson and Pepper Johnson, which is in the con- versation with the ’70s Steelers as well as the Packers and Chiefs in the ’60s for the greatest crew ever. But since this prob- lem has been going on since 2005, and the defense in 2011 surrendered the second- most yards in NFL history. Bill Belichick seems to be living more on the ’80s reputa- tion than reality. So what is the problem? Most people want to blame the players, and while I think that’s always the first place to start, there’s more to it. I think it has to do with a break- down in the entire operation from talent evaluation to overall philosophy, and here are the factors to consider: Talent Evaluation: Since 2005, first- round picks yielded Devin McCourty and Brandon Meriweather. Second-round picks have landed Terrence Wheatley, Pat Chung, Darius Butler and Ras-I Dowl- ing. In the third round came Ellis Hobbs. In the fourth round came Jonathan Wil- hite. That’s a lot of draft capital invested for a problem that just won’t go away. Pass Rush: This is a huge part of the problem. A great pass rush cures a lot of secondary ills. I mean, can you even name any of the secondary guys for the Giants as their pass rush shut down the most prolif- ic offense in NFL history in winning the Super Bowl in ’07? Ditto for da Bears, who had the fiercest rush I’ve ever seen as they dominated the NFL in 1985. But it’s not so much the sacks. It’s consistent pressure to force the QB to get rid of it quicker. And while Chandler Jones, with five so far, is a nice addition, they’re on pace for just 29. And if they are getting in the QB’s face reg- ularly, there’s no way Russell Wilson has time to go deep like he did in the one-point loss to Seattle. Coaching: I never really thought about this until I heard someone talking about it on the radio, but McCourty has regressed since an impressive rookie year. It’s the same for Chung, though I’ve said more than a few times I think locals vastly overrate him. Then throw in Meriweather, Hobbs, Butler and Dowling and you’ve got a lot of people taking a step back after decent ear- ly starts. So maybe there is something to it. They keep getting beat deep anyway, so why not forget giving such a cushion and play them tight at the line to take away all the short stuff they get killed by too? Salary Cap Management: They had pro- ductive comer backs on the team in Ty Law and Assante Samuel and let them walk and things haven’t been the same since. That’s because they have a system where the most indispensable guy on offense and defense get the big money and they spread around the rest to have more B and C+ lev- el players than anyone else to keep getting production when the inevitable injuries hit. Tom Brady is the guy on offense. On D in the Super Bowl winning years it was Rich- ard Seymour. But when he slipped a bit as he and Vince Wilfork were both coming into contract years, Wilfork was deemed more irreplaceable and Seymour was shipped off to Oakland even though they really didn’t have a replacement. It’s hard to argue that it hasn’t worked. But given all the trouble they’ve had finding a shutdown corner since ’05 - maybe it’s time to tweak the system a bit to throw some money in free agency at a guy who’s already proved he can do it in the NFL like when Nmandi Asomaugh came out in 201 1? Drafting Philosophy: “Trade down to accumulate more picks” seems to be the philosophy, based on a belief, I guess, that extra picks makes it more likely you’ll come out of every draft with four or five useful players. But every once in a while, if the right player is there, you’ve got to go for it — like Washington did in April. Yes, they gave up a boatload of high picks, but they hit a home run with the spectacu- lar RGHI. Like when the dynamic Patrick Peterson was on the board when they were looking for a comer in 20 1 0 with assets to go up and get him. Instead they went down and got Dowling. Other Guys: How have the Ravens been a top defense since the 1990s? Because they got Ray Lewis 26* overall, Ed Reed at 24, Terrell Suggs at 10, Haloti Ngata at 12 and tough comer Ladarius Webb in the third round in 2009 — when the Pats took Chung, Butler, Ron Brace, Sebastian Vollmer AND Brandon Tate before the Ravens took him. YIKES ! So the bottom line is it’s time to tweak the entire system. Bill, and to get someone who’s better at shopping for the groceries on the defensive side of the ball.

Among his best decisions was picking linebacker coach Bill Parcells to succeed Ray Perkins when he succeed- ed Bear Bryant at Alabama in 1983. Next was to stick with him amid rumors he’d be out after the G-Men dropped to 3-12- 1 in his first year. It was uphill after that, as they went to the playoffs 6 times in the next 7 years and won those 2 Super Bowls. Despite the two rings, he only drafted one Hall of Tamer, Lawrence Taylor, though he drafted Phil Simms (1st), Carl Banks (1st), Gronk-like Mark Bavaro (4*), Pepper Johnson (2\"^^^) and Michael Strahan (2\"^^^). ^60s Packers linebackers: In Ray Nitschke and Dave Robinson, this group featured one Hall of Tamer and one should- be Hall of Tamer. Also had third backer Lee Roy Caffee (not to be confused with Cowboys great Leroy Roy Jordan), who was good enough to be All-Pro in 1966 when Nitschke and Robinson also made it and went to the Pro Bowl with those two and the aforementioned other Leroy Roy as well. Won 3 straight titles together, including the first 2 Super Bowls. ^60s Kansas City Chiefs: In Willie Lanier and Bobby Bell they had two Hall of Tamers. Third guy in was ND’er Jim Lynch, who came along in 1968. Played together for 8 seasons when they had 1 8 Pro Bowl appearances and 6 trips to the playoffs and won Super Bowl IV in a 23-7 romp over the 13-1 Vikings. ^70s Steelers: In Jack Lambert, Jack Ham and Andy Russell it had 2 Hall of Tamers and one guy in Russell who’s get- ting screwed by not getting in. And if you don’t believe me, ask yourself how many 7-time Pro Bowlers didn’t make the Hall. They played together on Pittsburgh’s dom- inating Steel Curtain defense that won the Super Bowl in 1974 and ’75 when it gave up a measly 13.6 and 11.9 points per game. Between them, they have 24 Pro Bowl appearances. No Crime and No Punishment: After the annual NCAA investigation into one of Coach Cal’s recmits at Kentucky, Noel Nerlens has been cleared to practice and play with the Wildcats. The agile big, who’s expected to replace the departed Anthony Davis after being the No. 1 ranked prep play- er in the country, got the OK reportedly after two NCAA types traveled to New Hampshire for a chat with the folks at the Tilton School, where he spent the last two seasons. Sports 101: Name the manager who was ejected from a game the most in baseball history. Little-Known Fact: Maybe he should DH for the Cardinals if they get to the series, as Chris Carpenter was 3 for 4 as a batter to start the postseason. He was also the first pitcher with 2 doubles in the same postseason since Orel Hershiser in 1988. Alumni News: Overshadowed by what Chip Kelly is doing at Oregon is that Dan Mullen’s Mississippi State team is unde- feated and untied at 7-0 after Saturday’s 45-3 win over Middle Tennessee. To be fair it has been helped to this point by a cup- cake schedule, so the real test lies ahead for the ex-Trinity QB’s club in the next three weeks starting with No. 1 ranked Alabama followed by 18th-ranked Texas A&M and No. 6 LSU. The Numbers: There are first goals in a career and then there are TIRST goals in a career. The one by Bedford’s Sean Purcell was of the latter category: The first goal of his varsity career came in the 14th game of his senior year and gave the 14-0 Bulldogs a 1-0 win over Keene to keep their hopes of an undefeated and untied season alive. On This Date — Oct, 25: 1937 Casey Stengel signs to manage Boston Bees. 1978 Gaylord Perry is first to win Cy Young in both leagues. 1981 George Steinbrenner scuffles with 2 fans in a hotel elevator. 1986 Trailing 5-3 with 2 out and no one on in bot- tom of 10th, the Mets rally to win Game 6 of the World Series when the ball goes through Bill Buckner’s legs.

Deaths: 1995 Bobby Riggs, tennis hustler who famously played and lost to BUie Jean King in the Bat- tle of the Sexes, at 77. Sports 101 Answer: New York (base- ball) Giants John McGraw was thrown out of more than 100 games, the most in histo- ry. No. 2 is Leo Durocher at 93. The Numbers 3 - TD passes from Car- men Giampetruzzi to Tristan Theroux as the Trin- ity juggernaut kept rolling on Triday night with a 55-8 win over Hanover when Austin (torture) Chambers scored two more TDs including one on a 8 1 -yard punt return. 7 - overtime games this year for the Central girls after Lindsay Read sent it to OT by scoring with 19 seconds left to lead to a 2-2 with Bed- ford on Senior Day at Gill Stadium on Triday afternoon. 8 - shots turned back by Memorial goalie Gary Archaubault in shutting out Winnacunnet as the 2-11-1 Crusaders tied 0-0 in double OT to hand the 9-4- 1 Warriors their first tie of the year at the start of the week. 13 - wins against just 2 losses for the Londonder- ry girls after a 3-1 win over Nashua South in NHIAA soc- cer action, behind goals from Kristen Bourque, Emily Crocetti and Kayleen Wal- berg while the South goal came from Lauren Smith. 21 - seconds between Londonderry goals scored by Rob Hart (throb) and Dril- hn Dylan Holland to put the Lancers on path to an 8- 1 win over Nashua South 1 when Nate Gaw (fish) chipped in with 2 goals for the now 13-1 Lancers. ^ eaucnlii- ' A FAMILY TRADITION SINCE 1887 926 Elm Street, Manchester, NH {Next to City Hall) 603-625-8442 • 800-457-6539 Watches, Jewelry, Diamonds and Precious Stones www.pearsonsjewelry.com | We Want to Buy Your Watches! Honey Matters Q: I'm 26 and don't have a family yet — why should I get Life Insurance? Al The need for life insurance is there even if you don't have a family. First you don't want to burden your parents or other family members to cover your final expenses if the worst happens. And secondly — the cost is much lower at 26 and that will keep the premiums lower when you do have your own family. tSuM- Plofia PFwMOipnt tkn.

It’s a time to get creative in choosing or making an eye-catching, head-turning, frightening or funny costume.

They say after people die, their energy remains. Paranormal inves- tigators and ghost hunters are eanvassing southern New Hampshire in seareh of that energy. They all have different styles, tech- niques and beliefs, but all have a similar goal. While they don’t necessarily want to force anyone into believing in ghosts, they all want to teach people about the theories behind what they do and help explain mys- terious happenings. Susan Allen of Nashua, director of the Souhegan Paranormal Investigators, said when her group hosts events for the pub- lic, the goal is to provide a forum in which to learn about the topic. “We will have speakers that speak on the subject of the paranormal and show our evidence we have collected,” Allen said. “We try to educate the public and do not attempt to sway anyone on whether or not to believe in the paranormal.” In most cases of reported para- normal activity, Allen said there is a perfectly logical explanation behind any strange occurrences. But when the group comes across what it feels is tru- ly unexplainable, that is when they think a connection with the spirit world can be made. Though the group explores throughout New Hampshire and the Northeast, Allen said it has returned on multiple occasions to The Governor’s Mansion in Hampton Falls. The structures on the property date to 1880, and Allen said it is where the group has picked up some of its best elec- tronic voice phenomena. Referred to by ghost hunters as EVP, this is one of the most commonly tools said to show evidence of the paranormal. Armed with a voice recorder, paranormal investi- gators will record sounds at locations they suspect could be haunted. When playing back the recordings, ghost hunters listen for sounds they say could be voices of the dead. Eric Perry, founder of the Manchester- based Central New Hampshire Paranormal Society, said the best results are picked up on a digital recorder. Allen explained it as the ghost or spirit leaving an “imprint” on the recorder. Perry said he has picked up knock- ing sounds and voices on his recorders. But one of the best recordings his group has received came from one member per- forming an EVP session in a home where a loved one had passed away. On the play- back, Perry said they could hear a voice saying “I love you,” “I miss you,” and even asking, “I’m dead?” “We talk to [ghosts] in a normal voice and will let them know we don’t want to hurt them,” Perry said. “We just want to see if they’re still around.” People who are really serious about seeking the paranormal can take years of training under the guidance of an experi- enced ghost hunter. Perry said one of his mentors is CC Carole, a ghost hunter, author and Inter- net personality from Merrimack. Carole’s online series CC The Huntress, which shows her performing solo explorations in New England and beyond, is consistently among the top-viewed online paranormal programs. The episodes are available at www.ccthehuntress.com. For the show, Carole has climbed moun- tains and explored the depths of a well. Her goal, in addition to coming into con- tact with spirits, is to teach her audience about the history of the locations she visits and ways they can make their own para- normal connections. “I want to teach people how to use their equipment,” Carole said. “I leave them with tools that they can carry with them and use.” In addition to a keen intuition, Carole uses EVP, electromagnetic field meters, pendulums, dowsing rods and mineral sprays when she goes on ghost hunts. Electromagnetic field meters detect electrical energy. The meters can be used when there is no interference from other electronic devices; Carole says the meters may be able to detect residual energy left over from the dead. Carole said she also uses a pendulum to interact with the spir- it world. An amethyst stone hangs at the bottom of a silver chain and Carole said she will hold it out and ask spirits to move Ghost hunting groups While some ghost hunters do their investi- gations solo, many in the area have formed groups, with eaeh member performing a speeifie role in their explorations.

Once the amethyst is swinging, Carole will ask the spirits to stop the pen- dulum. On occasion, she said, the stone will halt immediately, frozen and pointing toward the ground. Dowsing rods have been used by people looking for the paranormal for centuries, Carole said; the idea is that the handheld metal rods, bent at a 90-degree angle, can start vibrating or heating up when in the presence of a spirit. “People get highly emotional when they work,” Carole said. “It’s amazing when people feed into the energy that remains.” While Carole does not have any public ghost hunts scheduled in New Hampshire at the moment, she frequently invites groups to explore with her. Some of her targeted locations have included for- mer apothecaries and Nashua’s Holman Stadium. For those who want to give ghost hunting a try, the East Coast Transcom- munication Organization, orTeam ECTO, a group based in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, will lead a ghost hunt through America’s Stonehenge (105 Haverhill Road, Salem) on Saturday, Oct. 27, from 6 to 10 p.m. Ron Pinkham, founder of Team This photo, taken by the Souhegan Paranormal Society, shows orbs outside the Governor’s Mansion in Hamp- ton Falls. These orbs are believed by some to be spirits remaining in the mansion. Courtesy photo. ECTO, said before the group heads out to explore, the team will provide a lecture and instruction on ghost hunting techniques. Pinkham said this will be the group’s fourth time exploring the site. While the paranormal is not always eas- ily found, Pinkham said it is important to consider the possibility. “This stuff goes on every day and people don’t stop and think about why,” he said. • Dark Knights Paranormal in Henniker.

SPOOKY FUN Ghosts are people, too Historical records help identify who’s boo By Jeff Mucciarone Joshua Card was the lighthouse keeper at Boon Island Light from 1867 to 1874, the highest-paid lighthouse keeper in the eountry, making $860 per year on an island miles out at sea. In 1 874, Card took a signifieant pay eut to take the lighthouse keeper post at Portsmouth Harbor Light. And he may never have left. On a few oeeasions, people have seen a man on the lighthouse grounds fitting Card’s deseription. Card died in I9II in Newburyport, Mass. Card spent most of his life at or near the sea. He settled in for 35 years at Ports- mouth harbor. His wife died a few years into his time there, and he lived by him- self on the island until he was 86. “He loved to show around the light- house,” said Jeremy D’Entremont, a lighthouse historian and Seaeoast tour guide. “Summer residents would eome to visit and he knew all the history.” Fiona Broome, a ghost hunter and author (fionabroome.eom), said it’s rare that ghosts ean aetually be identified. “In most eases, we’re just guessing anyway. We’re just putting a label on a phenomenon,” Broome said. “Although I aetually believe in ghosts and an after- life, from the work I’ve done. I’m not eonvineed all the things people think are ghosts are aetually spirits of the dead who are lingering here.” Two women separated by a eouple years who didn’t know eaeh other told similar stories regarding a figure on the HAUNTED HOUSES It’s no surprise that a state rich in history is also rich in history’s black-sheep cousin, the ghost story. At Blaser’s Fireside Tavern in Hopkinton the ghost story starts with a real tragedy, the suicide of Frank Mills there many years ago. Today, some say his ghost roams the build- ing, moving furniture and lighting candles, according to the New England Ghost Project. His niece, Olive Mills, told the current owner, Nancy Blaser, that’s a bunch of hogwash. Blaser says there have been some fun- ny happenings at her Hopkinton tavern. The previous owners of the building also not- ed some strange occurrences, she said, such as lights switching on and off and forks and knives being crossed over. Several ghosts have been said to haunt various parts of the Palace Theatre in downtown Manchester, said Peter Ram- say, president of the theater: A woman in white is said to haunt the stage and an angry man is said to spook the boiler room. The main hall is rumored to be home to a man who fell over the balcony, an actress and a ghostly usher, according to Ghost Quest, a paranormal research group. An actor com- mitted suicide there in the 1930s, and his spirit is also believed to roam the nearly 100-year-old building, Ramsey said. Doors slamming on their own accord at 2 a.m., followed by something cool whooshing through him, have caused Ramsey to leave the hall mnning on several occasions, he said. “Five years ago, I was down in the green room turning the lights off in each dress- ing room. I flicked the lights off, and I heard the water and sink turn on,” he said. So he turned the lights back on, walked to the sink and turned it off But when he turned the lights off once more, it happened again. Tortilla Flats (595 DW Highway, Merri- At the Windham Restaurant, staff would sometimes come in early and find place settings and chairs moved. In this instance, they found Christmas gifts stacked wall-to-wall. Courtesy photo. mack) is another place that has been said to have ghost activity, according to Ron Kolek, lead investigator at the New England Ghost Project. Yet again, the haunter is believed to be a man, named Zechariah, who com- mitted suicide in the building, having hung himself in one of the rooms. Books are said to rearrange themselves on a shelf above the fireplace in the hanging room. Next to the fireplace is a stained glass window, which replaced the regular window — Kolek said owners replaced this window with a stained glass one because there were sightings reporting a figure’s reflection within it. Kolek said Windham Restaurant (59 Range Road, Windham) has at least two ghosts: William, a young boy, and Jacob, an angry spirit concerned about papers bur- ied in the basement. Images of William and another little girl have been seen in the wait station and have been heard running on the second floor, he said. For Portsmouth ghost-hunter Roxy Zwicker, ghost stories a way to keep history alive, even if you don’t believe in them. “No matter what, even if you haven’t had any real ghost experiences, introductions to the paranormal, these ghosts are alive through the storytelling,” she said. — Kelly Sennott HIPPO I OCTOBER 25 - 31, 2012 I PAGE 20 SPOOKY FUN lighthouse grounds in Portsmouth. One saw a white-bearded man standing on the walkway to the lighthouse; she notieed the man’s uniform and figured tour guides must be dressing up in uniforms. As the woman got eloser, the man was no longer there. A eouple years later, another woman deseribed a man with a white beard wear- ing a uniform and had the same thought: guides must be giving tours in eostume. But tour guides do not dress in eostume. In a different instanee, a third woman insist- ed she saw a man with a white beard in overalls standing in the base of the light- house, D’Entremont said. Card wore a serviee uniform with a navy peaeoat, with a K on the lapels. The K stood for keeper, but Card told people it stood for eaptain. D’Entremont said people typieally ealled lighthouse keepers “eap- tain” as a sign of respeet. For ghost hunters, the historieal eompo- nent of ghost stories is important. “You have to have something to doe- ument ... what’s going on and how it’s eonneeted with a ghost,” Broome said. D’Entremont said it doesn’t matter that Card didn’t die on the lighthouse grounds. “We don’t fiilly know the rules,” D’Entremont laughed. “Lighthouse keep- ers were so tied to their partieular lights. To me, it’s not a huge streteh that even after his death he was still tied to that plaee.” D’Entremont thinks of himself as an open-minded skeptie, but two stories and his own experienee give him pause. D’Entremont always says, “Hi eaptain,” when he’s giving tours of the lighthouse. D’Entremont was onee giving a tour to a eouple when he heard a gravelly “Hello,” eome from the top of the stairs. “I felt like if I could lean forward over the top, Ed see someone,” D’Entremont said. Sometimes when people spot what they believe is a ghost, they attach the phenom- enon to a known historical figure. Thomas D’Agostino and his wife, Arlene Nicholson, have conducted more than 1,000 investigations for their orga- nization, the Paranormal United Research Society (www.nepurs.com). “We’re look- ing for the history of a place as far back as we can trace it, along with any leg- ends or stories associated with it,” said D’Agostino, who has spent 30 years investigating ghost reports. “We want to romanticize ghosts and old buildings, battlefields and old houses, but I don’t think we always think through all the implications that go with that,” Broome said. D’Agostino agreed. Broome begins any investigation by looking at census records. “If you don’t have a reason for a particular ghost to haunt a location ... the credibility goes down,” Broome said. Broome asks people to describe the Portsmouth Harbor Light lighthouse keeper Joshua Card. Photo courtesy the Portsmouth Athenaeum. clothing a ghost is wearing. If a ghostly lady is wearing bright yellow shoes, for example, she probably represents a time before 1910 or so. Broome’s favorite ghost is Judith Thompson Tyng, a minister’s daughter from colonial Tyngsboro, Mass. Tyng is one of a few ghosts in the country who are said to have moved from one location to another, in this case to torment her hus- band who allegedly murdered her. Tyng apparently followed her husband, John Alford Tyng, who moved from Tyngsboro to Nashua. At one point, a respected sol- dier wrote in his journal that he saw Tyng when he visited her husband — but Tyng had already died. “It makes for one of New Hampshire’s best ghost stories, in my opinion,” Broome said. Portsmouth seems to be a hub of ghost- ly activity. D’Agostino looks to the city’s port history. It used to be the biggest port in the region. “There was a lot of hustle and bustle,’ D’Agostino said. There were ships traveling in and out of port. There were a lot of rich people who didn’t want to leave their belongings behind. Families dealt with losing members at sea, leaving children orphaned, D’Agostino said. “There are a lot of mixtures of energy,” D’Agostino said. “Things tend to stick around and keep showing up.” We Are Proud To Be One Of The TOP ORTHODONTISTS Voted in NH MAGAZINE 2006 thru 20 ^ ^ invisalign ^ C.V r- -Ln 1-rl » >t>u«nr<sa4j‘ ■a deautifid itnile. i ' ORTHODONTICS * Specialists in Children and Adult Orthodontics 623-8003 • www.drmehan.com 1 1 3 Mammoth Road, Manchester, NH Call for your complimentary smile consultation.
