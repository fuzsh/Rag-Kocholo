        "text": "Mockumentary filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (Catfish) know a thing or two about misdirecting an audience, as they proved again with 2011's Paranormal Activity 3.\n\nTogether with returning screenwriter Christopher Landon, this time around they seem short on new ideas, however, relying more on the series' reputation for low-budget thrills to attract audiences. Regardless, by now Paramount's franchise is a brand unto itself, and it's unlikely that anything will stop the first few waves of fans boosting Paranormal Activity 4 up the chart until at least through Halloween.\n\nQuickly recapping the conclusion of Paranormal Activity 2 with flashbacks and documentary-style introductory cards — the prequel to 2007's original film shows Katie (Katie Featherston) killed her sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) and abducted her nephew Hunter (William Juan Prieto) — the current version jumps ahead to 2011, relocating the action from California to Nevada and introducing an entirely new family.\n\nTeenager Alex (Kathryn Newton), her 6-year-old brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp) and their parents (Stephen Dunham and Alexondra Lee) live a typical middle-class suburban life, even if they think their neighbors across the street — single mother Katie and her young son Robbie (Brady Allen) — are a bit of an odd pair.\n\nAfter Katie is unexpectedly and mysteriously admitted to the hospital for some unknown illness, Alex’s mom offers to take Robbie in while his mother is recovering. Alex soon begins to notice strange events coincidental with Robbie’s arrival, while the young visitor’s insinuations increasingly draw Wyatt away from her. Other family members also begin to clue into the strange goings-on, with mysterious sounds, shifting furniture and alarmingly animated household objects suggesting something is seriously amiss.\n\nAsymmetrically framed scenes, staccato editing techniques and oppressive ambient sound (and the ominous lack of a score) are substituted for any real narrative development, leaving a plot essentially consisting of a series of setups followed by frightening payoffs.\n\nParanormal Activity 4\n\n(C) Directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman. R (language and some violence/terror). 95 mins. In wide release."
