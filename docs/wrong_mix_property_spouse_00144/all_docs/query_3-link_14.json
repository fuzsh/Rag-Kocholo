It shows, of course, the climactic scene of Billy Wilder’s Sunset Blvd (r 950) when Gloria Swanson (above), playing one-time silent-era movie star Norma Desmond, is about to be taken away by the police. Seeing the press crowd that’s gathered, she flips delusionally back to her former glory days and says, “All right, Mr DeMille. I’m ready for my close-up.” We too are ready for our close-ups this month. We celebrate a new DVD and Blu-ray restoration of that ultimate close-up film The Passion of Joan of Arc (p.44). Mark Cousins looks at significant use of the face in cinema (p.47). We have an in-depth career- survey interview with Michael Haneke (p.54). We cover The Master (-p. 28) - a portrait of the war-damaged and those who would exploit them - and talk to its director Paul Thomas Anderson (p.32). And speaking of movie stars of the golden age, we also profile tough cookie Miriam Hopkins (p.36).

During the opening week of the recent BFI London Film Festival, I was editing the transcript of an interview with the Romanian director Cristi Puiu that I’d conducted at the same festival two years earlier - about his film Aurora (see page 40). The first thing to say about Aurora is that it is at the extreme end of what we might call quotidian cinema: films that allow the details of everyday life to provide the texture of suspense and drama, without much obvious recourse to the traditional storytelling virtues of action and motivation. With Aurora thus on my mind, I saw two more terrific films at this year’s LFF that also attempt to portray a passage of time in a real- life situation: Ira Sachs’s Keep the Lights On and Michael Winterbottom’s Everyday. Together these three films would make a fascinating - if exhausting - triple bill, for they offer a rich variety of approaches to the same problem of depicting the everyday over a specific time period. Aurora charts 36 hours in the life of a man (played by Puiu himself). According to my 2010 Cannes report, he’s “a seemingly gentle, dreamily distracted bear of a man only half preoccupied with a life that shows traces of some emotional cataclysm. When he takes delivery of two new firing pins for his hunting rifle, you remain unsure of his intentions - and of the full nature of his slightly off-kilter relations with the people he meets.” Though there are elements of suspense and action in Aurora, what fascinates above all is the detail of his estrangement. Keep the Lights On is more about gradual change. It describes the evolution of a ten-year relationship involving Erik (Thure Lindhardt), a diffident Danish documentary-maker living in New York, and the seemingly strait-laced Paul (Zachary Booth), who works in publishing. They meet through a casual- sex hook-up; although Paul presents himself at first as having a girlfriend, he eventually moves in with Erik. Any reluctance I might have about ruining the plot of this film is assuaged by the fact that plot is beside the point. What matters is the emotion on the faces of the actors; although Sachs’s film is happy to enjoy their prettiness, his camera is forensic in its keenness to show how the vagaries of desire and It’s often claimed that storytelling has been abandoned by Hollywood, but a fascination with authenticity has led specialist filmmakers to an equal mistrust of the dramatic fictional yam romance, the tensions between enthralment and self- interest, and the waxing and waning of emotional connection play out on the surface of the human face and in that mysterious realm ‘behind the eyes’. Everyday is more of a deliberate experiment in that it chronicles five years in the life of a family and it took five years to make, shooting for a couple of weeks every year. The film’s main focus is on a mother (Shirley Henderson) who’s raising four children while their father (John Simm) is in prison. Even more so than the two previous examples. Everyday is made up of small, seemingly ordinary moments: the journeys to the prisons, the kinds of treats they can afford to give the kids, the snatches of shared pleasure. The unique aspect is that the excellent actors visibly age their five years’ worth on film - especially noticeably, of course, in the case of the children. In all these films, it’s the familiarity of what the characters are going through that encourages us to invest emotion in their respective fates. In that sense these films share some of the vicarious pleasures of reality television, even though the desperation to sensationalise in a show like Big Brother is the very opposite of what these films set out to achieve. It’s often claimed that the traditional virtues of storytelling have been abandoned by corporate Hollywood studio product in thrall to the superior success of shoot-’em-up videogames, but we can see here - across this wide range of festival-friendly films - that a fascination with authenticity has led specialist filmmakers to an equal mistrust of the dramatic fictional yam. And yet if you compare these three (the fatalistic Romanian tragedy, the elegant New York gay-relationship portrait and the realist near-docudrama set at prisons around England) the strange thing is that the film that requires the most endurance to watch, and which dwells most on authenticity - Aurora - may in the end be the one that relies most on the props of fiction. © December 2012 | Sight&Sound | 9 Rushes NEWS AND VIEWS IN THE FRAME MISTER FREEDOM TARAK ATURE TARAK TM FREEC ROCK ATURE TARAK\" FREED EROC^ ATURE ATUR TARAK: ^TK FREED EROCKi ATUR^ TARAK FREED EROCKI ART STEB Bright lights, big city: film strips from William Klein's first short, ‘Broadway by Light' Tate Modern’s exhibition of William Klein’s photographs also allows us to sample his extraordinary films By Isabel Stevens Blending in has never been William Klein’s style. In the early 1950s, when the painter- turned-shutterbug-rebel started losing himself in New York’s streets, he couldn’t have been further from the mould of the invisible photographer, hiding or disguising his camera, composing and calculating his exposure from a safe distance. Klein made sure the anonymous faces in the crowd saw a tall man with a wide-angle lens coming for them, grabbing everything from the scene - a haze of passersby, logos, graffiti - in, as Klein put it, “a gluttonous rage”. The violent, blurred close-ups, grainy views of nowhere street corners and casual, off-kilter horizons didn’t impress publishers, who regarded Klein’s New York as a slum. Only Chris Marker, then working at the Parisian publishing house Editions du Seuil, recognised the wild beauty of Klein’s photo book (its half-Beat, half-tabloid subtitle says it all: Trance Witness Revels’) and announced he would quit unless Seuil published it. “Now you’ve done a book, you can do a film,” was Marker’s advice to the American, ON OUR RADAR A Nos Amours The eclectic programme of Joanna Hogg and Adam Roberts’s Maurice Pialat-inspired collective continues with a screening of Herk Harvey’s macabre B-movie delight ‘Carnival of Souls’ at the ICA, London on 15 November, www. anosamours.co.uk Jennifer Lawrence She was a convincing mountain girl in the excellent ‘Winter’s Bone’ (2010) and suitably iconic and mysterious in ‘The Hunger Games’ but if you want to see what a scorching talent the 22-year-old is, see her in David 0. Russell’s ‘Silver Linings Playbook’ where she fires up scene after scene as a bipolar widow who forces the equally mental-health-issues- afflicted Bradley Cooper (excellent too) to take part in a dance contest. Even toe to toe with Robert De Niro, playing Cooper’s CCD dad, she demonstrates a dramatic and comedic range way beyond her years. 10 I Sight&Sound | December 2012 BROADWAY BY LIGHT 1958 © WILLIAM KLEIN (i) ANATOMY OF A MOVIE ARGO now relocated to Paris. And so, just as Klein had chanced on photography via a series of accidents (winning a Rolleiflex in a poker game and being bewitched by the sense of movement the camera captured when photographing abstract panels he’d painted), he now fell into filmmaking. With Marker and Alain Resnais as allies, Klein made Broadway by Light, a delirious, kaleidoscopic 13-minute tour of Times Square’s neon nightscape - a deluge of flashing, fragmented signs and cinema marquees that feels like a berserk animated version of Piet Mondrian’s painting Broadway Boogie-Woogie (Mondrian was Klein’s favourite artist). The film didn’t receive much attention on its release in 1958 (“the colour is striking but hardly accurate,” sniffed the Monthly Film Bulletin), but what is now regarded as the first Pop film gets the prominence it deserves at the Tate Modern’s current Klein retrospective (where his photographs show in a double bill with those of his fellow street prowler, Japanese photographer Daido Moriyama). Dancing above visitors’ heads in the exhibition’s entrance, the film clearly demonstrates Klein’s skill with both types of 35mm camera, putting his photography and filmmaking on an equal footing. In the late 1950s and early 60s, while juggling fashion shoots, his own photographic surveys of Moscow, Paris and Tokyo, as well as documentaries for French television, Klein gradually became more drawn to cinema, spending his nights at the Cinematheque (the film he saw most comes as no surprise: Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera) and appearing with his wife Jeanne as the couple from the future in Marker’s La Jetee. Meanwhile his time as art director on Louis Malle’s Zazie dans le Metro (in which the abstract, message-less posters lining Parisian walls are his creations) ensured he learned how a film was put together. With his Pop lust for repetition, Klein was amazed by the rushes and puzzled as to why eight different versions of a scene weren’t all used. When in 1966 he finally embarked on his feature debut, it was an irreverent, slapstick fairytale-cum-spoof which drew heavily on his experiences on the street, in the fashion industry and in French television. The wacky extravaganza Who Are You, Polly Maggoo? magnified everything that was grotesque and absurd about fashion and the media, setting the maximalist tone for Klein’s future features like the unhinged superhero farce Mister Freedom With Marker and Resnais as allies, Klein made ‘Broadway by Light’, a delirious tour of Times Square’s neon nightscape (1968). “Ten years ahead of its time” was Stanley Kubrick’s verdict on Who Are You, Polly Maggoo? (critics were far more perplexed). Certainly Klein had a knack for being prophetic. The Model Couple (1975) predicted reality television years before the phenomenon took hold, while the rebellious, anti-imperialist stance of Mister Freedom chimed so heavily with the events of May 1968 (although it had been filmed earlier) that it was banned in France. Increasingly throughout the 60s and 70s, Klein turned to documentary, drawn to such vivacious, outspoken figures as Muhammad Ali, Eldridge Cleaver and even John McEnroe in The French (1981), his roving, behind-the- scenes study of the French Open. Yet, with the exception of Muhammad Ali, The Greatest (1974), Klein’s films have largely remained overshadowed by his photography, and even now are only just appearing on DVD. However, the singular visual style for which Klein is so well known can be detected in every one of his films, for which he designed all the bizarre costumes and zany sets, as well as drawing the exploding credit sequences and the posters. So too can his love of pavement life be traced across his filmography. It’s there in his document of the May ’68 protests. Maydays (Grand Soirs et Petits Matins, 1978). When in his little-seen The Little Richard Story (1980) his subject slips away from him, Klein returns to Richard’s hometown - Macon, Georgia - to record the city and the sounds and music emanating from it. Look closely at Who Are You, Polly Maggoo? dind you’ll see his camera does crazy things with crowds and street signs and reflections. Two seconds was what Klein reckoned a great photographer’s career amounted to.

A few years into habitual digital communication, however, a flip had occurred: instantaneous flickers from across the globe were standard and it was the physical transportation of a letter from hand to far-offhand that seemed quasi-miraculous. The movie equivalent of this shift is the process whereby lifelike computer-generated imagery seemed thrilling until it was standard, whereupon handcrafted objects and stunts done for real came to be prized anew - at least by filmmakers and viewers with an enduring investment in authenticity It seems notable that high-profile international directors of the artier stripe became increasingly invested in boundary-pushing depictions of unfaked experience just as the big-budget mainstream pursued an ever-less substantial imitation of life. So while Toy Story (1995) was making pixels lovable, the Dogme 95 movement fetishised physical immediacy to the extent of prohibiting the use of unnatural lighting; and kerfuffles about real sex in the likes of Baise-Moi (2000), Intimacy (2000) and g Songs (2004) ran alongside the creation of ever more elaborate simulated bodies in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Star Wars prequels and the Matrix sequels. (The inorganic nature of the product was evidently suited to replication, for here blockbusters began cloning themselves, just like The Matrix's Agent Smith.) Just as stuntmen are kept under wraps if a star wants to look like a real-life hard man, so CGI - and body doubles, and prosthetics, and stage combat - can be construed as a slick solution for those too effete to take on the work for real. Once it had become perfectly possible to alter Christian Bale’s appearance digitally, it was all the more mad and impressive that he shed a third of his real body weight for The Machinist (200-^). The Bale torso was the equivalent of a puppet from the workshops of Aardman or Tim Burton: physical evidence of painstaking craftsmanship. By this rationale, why even script a character eating a living octopus if you’re not going to have the poor bastard do it for real? Which poor bastard claims your sympathy - man or octopus - rather depends upon your opinions regarding the rights of cephalopods. The director of Old Boy (2003), Park Chanwook, declared that his own sympathies were less with lead actor Choi Minsik than with the beast that was eaten. ‘Irreversible’ (The true death toll was seven; only on the seventh take did Park capture “the tentacles really moving around in a good way”.) The scene, not long into the film, has protagonist Oh Daesu entering a sushi bar having recently been freed from years of unexplained incarceration. His tormentor is still sending him cryptic messages. Half-mad with fear and rage, but also drawn to the physical after years without touching or being touched, he tells the waitress that he wants to eat something live. She brings a large octopus that writhes on the plate; he chews it savagely and swallows some before vomiting and collapsing. Divine ate excrement in Pink Flamingos (1972); consumption of grubs and bugs is a standard dare on the survival strand of reality TV shows. Still, Old Boy’s most grisly and wriggly of gross-out scenes struck a particular 12 I Sight&Sound | December 2012 THE FIVE BEST... FILMS SHOT BY THE LATE HARRIS SAVIDES chord and retains a grisly fascination. What is more indicative of Eastern ‘otherness’ to a mainstream Western palate than the fondness for raw fish? Sushi carries connotations of sex - via the longstanding association of fish with female sex organs - and poison, via the legend of the hlowfish dish that might end it all. For international audiences, the Old Boy scene draws on existing suspicions about what ‘orientals’ eat. So as well as providing a good solid shudder of the sort of body horror Julia Kristeva termed “abjection”, and warning Oh Daesu of his imminent undoing through reckless, compulsive sensuality. Old Boy’s octopus tickles the audience with their own fear of the extreme other. The octopus in Old Boy isn’t critical to the plot. But like the jaw-droppingly graphic bludgeoning by fire extinguisher that had kicked off the previous year’s Cannes cause ceTehre, Caspar Noe’s Irreversible, or the dare that kicked off the same director’s Seul centre tons (“You have 30 seconds to leave the cinema”), the sushi-bar scene sets the stakes. Old Boy is going to go to extremes to unsettle you. In declaring this intent. Park’s film fell in with much of the cinema from South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong that was selling internationally at the time. The fad for ‘extreme’ Asian cinema - horror and gangster movies characterised by dark humour and elaborate, often stylised violence - got going after the international success of Nakata Hideo’s Ring(iggy). The ‘extreme’ fad opened many new eyes to Asian cinema (Old Boy is known to audiences who’d never have been in the market for a South Korean film but for its notorious content). But as a branding tool, it unabashedly drew on cultural stereotypes to attract curious English-speaking audiences. Weird sex. Sadism. Weird sexual sadism. Ancient ghosts and spirits. Infantilised, sexually Only on the seventh take did Park capture “the tentacles really moving around in a good way” available women. Fetishism. Weird food... And somehow, as a result, the content of these ‘extreme’ films tended to draw out repressed stuff in not otherwise racist people. I recall watching Kim Kiduk’s g-Iron (2004) with a friend who repeated throughout, “They’re so cruel! They’re so inscrutable!” An infamous review of Old Boy by the American critic Rex Reed, meanwhile, made reference to Charlie Chan murder mysteries and “Oriental mumbo- jumbo” before asking, “What else can you expect from a nation weaned on kimchi?” Or, for that matter, raw squid (which, in real life, tends to be served sliced, not whole and wriggling)? Oriental weirdness will get a Hollywood gloss with an upcoming remake of Old Boy, due in 2013. Real octopus involvement is unconfirmed, but the story’s notes of otherness, self-disgust and inherited guilt should get director Spike Lee going. © Harris Savides (1957-2012) The ground-breaking DP, who has died (of brain cancer) tragically young at 5 5, began as a fashion photographer, but it was his dazzling opening credits for David Fincher’s Seyen (1994) and the immense subtlety and finish of the lighting in The Game (1997) and James Gray’s The Yards that made his name. Three regular collaborations marked his career: six features with Van Sant, three with Fincher, and a clutch of music videos with Mark Romanek.

I felt like I understood filmmaking for the first time There was no cutting, no elaborate lighting set-ups. In many ways it was the purest form of cinema. In working so simply, I gained a confidence that I never had before.” 4 ‘Birth’ (Jonathan Glazer, 2004) “I light a room and let the people inhabit it, as opposed to lighting the people. It’s more organic. There’s a constant battle between the best light for the face and the best light for the story. You don’t want to get to the point where the audience notices the light.” 1 ‘The Yards’ (James Gray, 1999) “James Gray walked me through a museum once. He wanted me to see things that he liked - Georges de La Tour, a painter who uses candlelight. There’s a kind of muddiness in his blacks, whereas in digital, black is really black. It’s very unnatural.” 3 ‘Elephant’ (Gus Van Sant, 2003) “Gus wanted to keep the format true to a TV image and shot in the 1.33:1 ratio. We tried to put our information, or most of our characters, in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and protect the 1.33:1, so we ended up with a very Diane Arbus Rolleiflex composition.” 5 ‘Zodiac’ (David Fincher, 2007) “Movies of the 1970s look a certain way. The photographer Stephen Shore had these banal kind of images of America in the 70s which were a great reference for colours and for props.

The award for Best British Newcomer at this year’s BFI London Film Festival went to writer-director Sally El Hosaini for My Brother the Devil, one of the most visually striking British debuts in recent times. It tells of two brothers of Egyptian descent growing up on a Hackney council estate. Elder brother Rashid (James Floyd) is mired in drug-dealing and local gang culture, but determined that younger brother Mo (Fady Elsayed) shouldn’t follow suit, preferring him to focus on educational achievement as a way out. Mo has different ideas, of course, and further twists in the tale will place their patiently evoked fraternal bond under pressure. I probably don’t need to remind you of the numerous British horrors mining similar urban territory. Apart from skirting cliches, what El Hosaini brings to the table is a profound understanding of the dislocations often attendant on a mixed cultural heritage (she herself is half Egyptian); a concern for authenticity (particularly East London street argot) which doesn’t fetishise or glamorise; a brilliantly chosen and directed cast of mainly non-professionals; and a sensitive figuring of turbulent interior lives through superb camera and sound work. It all adds up to a heartfelt film that lives and breathes. Kieron Corless: What was the starting point for ‘My Brother the Devil’? Sally El Hosaini: I’d lived in Hackney for over ten years, on the same council estate, and I’d seen a lot of change over that time. I wanted to do a film about two brothers, and because it looked like it was going to be micro micro micro-budget I thought, “Well, I’ll just set it on my council estate.” In the wake of the London bombings there was a lot of stuff in the press about Arabs and Muslims and a certain kind of image projected, and I thought, “I really want to do the film that’s notth^ terrorist film - that’s a bit playful, that’s actually showing the real things these kids are dealing with.” KC: The older brother Rashid is played by an actor, James Floyd, but the others are mainly non-professionals. SEH: I met so many fascinating boys during my research and thought, “Wow, they can really act. They could do better than an actor.” But I was really worried about casting an actor among non-actors. I wasn’t able to find a real boy who was prepared to do the Rashid role. James really impressed me with the amount of hard work he put in just for the audition - it was miles more than anyone else had done. And I realised I needed someone who was going to be Method, and who was going to go and get to know the real guys. All I said to him was: “Don’t get arrested.” KC: What were you looking for when you chose your cinematographer? SEH: With David [Raedeker] what I noticed I needed someone who was going to be Method, and who was going to go and get to know the real guys was he allowed his camerawork to get messy for the performance. And I had seen other extremely talented cinematographers, but their work was so stunning that it was inaccessible. You almost didn’t care about the characters because it was just too good. I really felt that [Raedeker] was someone who was going to allow space for the actors to blossom. When you’re working with non- actors and young actors, it requires someone who’s going to be much more spontaneous - in the moment and responding, not coming at it with a very dogmatic “This is the shot” or “This light has moved two inches because an actor kicked it.” I needed that more flexible way. KC: What else were you looking to achieve visually in the film? SEH: Our main rule was that the shooting style would be subjective, so whenever we composed shots of the brothers we would Sally El Hosaini always be thinking about the experience of that moment through the five senses. The other big decision that affected the aesthetic was to shoot in Scope. When I was shopping the script around trying to raise money, something a lot of people said to me was, “Oh, it’s set on a Hackney council estate. OK, we know what that film is.” Well actually, no. Because have you been to Hackney? Have you been on a council estate? There’s actually grass - they’re not that bad; there’s sky, there’s flowers, there’s trees. What I realised was that there was this whole thing of outsiders making films looking in, and I thought if there’s one aspiration I have, it’s for this film to be from the inside looking out. That matched up with our ambition to be very subjective. So we realised that we should make this film an adventure rather than mundane, and Scope made it that - because you’re suddenly applying a different way of looking at a world that we’re used to seeing on TV screens. KC: It lifts your film into another dimension. SEH: And also it allowed us to be very intimate, because you’re forced into all these close-ups with Scope. And the actors had better be completely honest, because they’re going to show up if they’re not. KC: Your own background clearly informs your depiction of the brothers and their family. SEH: In a way Rashid has become the dad that his father can’t be, because the parents are so out of touch - because they literally come from another world. They don’t actually understand the world their sons inhabit. Their sons are living this split because there’s them outside, navigating the world, and there’s them at home. A lot of Arab people living in the West will identify with that split personality. © 0 ‘My Brother the Devil’ is released on 9 November, and is reviewed on page 96 December 2012 | Sight&Sound 1 15 RUSHES INTERVIEW SOMETHING ROTTEN IN DENMARK Cause for celebration: director Thomas Vinterberg, above, is back with his best film since Testen’ Fourteen years after his second film Festen launched Dogme, Thomas Vinterherg is back with the equally hard-hitting The Hunt By Matthew Taylor “It’s a bit like The Shire,” muses Thomas Vinterberg on the rural Danish community beset by hysteria in his seventh feature The Hunt (Jagten). “They’re all very good-hearted, like hobbits, but very stern inside. When they feel the strength of togetherness, they can be tough.” Middle Earth might seem an unlikely reference point for the one-time Dogme practitioner and Bergman acolyte. Then again, Vinterberg is the filmmaker who blindsided audiences with the formal provocations of his sensational second film Festen (1998), only to renounce Dogme and resurface four years later with a whimsical dystopian romance (It’s All About Love). T/ie Hunt marks a return to Festen’s difficult subject-matter, grippingly depicting the persecution of divorced kindergarten teacher Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) after a false accusation of child abuse. “The idea was to make the antithesis of Festen,” Vinterberg explains. “When I made that film, it highlighted one set of victims, but it became apparent that other victims existed in the same situation. I found an opportunity to create a film about friendship, loss of innocence, love - it wasn’t just a moral obligation. It began with a psychiatrist giving me a case and saying, ‘You should look at this.’ I then researched a lot of other similar cases. Many ended with people in prison - [in] some [cases] 30 or 40 people, including local authorities. So we created a fiction but read a lot of material beforehand. And the reality is, as usual, much worse.” TheHunfs liberal, inclusive countryside setting renders the community’s knee-jerk accusations all the more sourly ironic. “The fairytale nature of this story means it has to take place in some village, in a forest, far away from everything,” says Vinterberg. “It needs to be an experiment inside glass. I see this as almost a Hans Christian Andersen story. You have the good people, the togetherness, the warmth, the innocence - and then this sliver of glass falls in, and everything descends into darkness and fearfulness. [It’s like] a virus that spreads through this whole group of people. I find it important when I make a film that there’s a sense of a film around it - meaning, these people have a past together; they always refer to this past through their rituals. Therefore families, gatherings, communes - 1 wrote a play about a commune, which I’m going to film - are really great dramatic material for me.” Lucas’s innocence is established early on. Was there ever a temptation to make his character more ambiguous? “We had that in mind for a while, but found it bored us,” Vinterberg admits. “It’s what an audience would expect. But more importantly, I felt distanced [from] it. I wanted to totally step into the life of this man, and remove any distance between the audience and him. So there was no chance of playing around with it. Every time we had a suggestive camera angle of Lucas, we had to adjust things; it was actually a big challenge to avoid making him look suspicious. We created this not odd but slightly lonely bespectacled man who works in a kindergarten - so Mads and I had to work hard to keep him innocent.” Did he always have Mikkelsen in mind? “I normally write for specific actors,” says Vinterberg. “You can take them out of their element, put them on thin ice. But in the case of Mads it doesn’t work, because he wants to see a script. He’s a big movie star now. Originally I envisaged the young Robert De Niro from The Deer Hunter- then Mads was attached and I rewrote it for him. Lucas changed from being a self-reliant man of few words - a tough guy - to this very humble, civilised, castrated Scandinavian man who finally has to step up. Which was more interesting, I think. And as Mads is such a stallion, I found we had to humble him.” One extraordinary scene sees Lucas Lucas changed from being a self-reliant tough guy to this castrated Scandinavian man who finally has to step up Mads Mikkelsen in ‘The Hunt’ determined to buy groceries, despite the violent objections of store workers and former friends. “He’s just being civilised,” Vinterberg explains. “And the moment when he’s not civilised any more, that’s when people clapped in Cannes, which I find interesting. We’re all a bunch of animals! I have a very moral friend in Denmark, director Per Ely - he wanted me to cut that scene out. He said, ‘You can’t let him down like that. He’s your godly figure!’ He was morally against it. And this is where all the satisfaction is for the audience.” Is it almost as if Lucas is testing this supposedly moral majority on how far they will go? “That’s very precise. I’ve always said that Lucas wants to believe in the good of his community, but in that sense he’s also waiting for them to be good - and that’s a test.” The Hunt is a bracing addition to the ranks of cinematic witch-hunts, from Day of Wrath and Le Corheau to The Wrong Man. Vinterberg acknowledges his film is “an old tale in modern clothes”, and mentions how he found similarities to his Dogme compatriot Lars von Trier’s Dogville. But he was, he says, “more inspired by Bergman, as always, and for this one, by my own films - how self-obsessed is that? Of course, it is a mirror of Festen somehow. And I had just made Suhmarino [2010], which is entirely blue and very dark. Lor this film, we constantly talked about creating warmth - putting some orange in the blue.” Lourteen years on, does he still find aspects of Dogme relevant? “Dogme was an attempt to create purity,” he points out. “But since then, it’s become a kind of fancy-dress. There was a huge element of risk in it, which disappeared on Festen’s opening night, when people stood clapping for 13 minutes. It was over, because obviously then it’s no longer a risk. Having said that, it was a cleansing moment, a milestone - in the sense that I and others realised you can make films in other ways.” © 0 ‘The Hunt’ is released in the UK on 30 November, and is reviewed on page 80 16 I Sight&Sound | December 2012 DISPATCHES THE RULE OF THREE A trip to Moscow prompts reflections on angels, Bulgarian paramedics and changing perspectives on the classics By Mark Cousins I’m on a flight to Moscow. This’ll be my third time in the Russian capital. The first was in 1988, when it was still Soviet. How the place has changed. Thought of such change reminds me of a recent trip to Rome. Late one evening, by the river Tiber, I came across the Ara Pacis. I realised I’ve seen this Roman peace altar twice before and wondered how many more times I’d see it. Maybe never. Maybe everything should be seen just three times. Maybe this third trip to Moscow should be my last. Of course this made me think of movies. I saw Citizen Kane for the first time when I was 18. After years of anticipation, it seemed somewhat mechanistic and cold. When I saw it a second time, in my late thirties, it had morphed into a film about paradise lost and the un-recuperability of youth. It hadn’t changed, though, of course; I had. To think of my own youth was to see the image of snow, of play, of a camera tracking backwards. (Perhaps I’ll watch Kane one more time.) When as a student I saw Cocteau’s LesEnfants terribles, I wanted to live like the people in it. Ten years later, I convinced a friend to watch it with me, did the big build-up, and put it in the DVD player. The film went on and on without affect or charm. QUOTE OF THE MONTH LUIS BUNUEL “Our imagination, and our dreams, are forever invading our memories; and since we are all apt to believe in the reality of our fantasies, we end up transforming our lies into truths. Of course, fantasy and reality are equally personal, and equally felt, so their confusion is a matter of only relative importance.” From his autobiography ‘My Last Breath’, translated from the French ‘Mon dernier soupir’ (1982) by Abigail Israel But we don’t just lose, we gain. I first saw Iranian films long before I went to the country. I liked the fine grain of their humanism, the photo-realism of their command of human interaction and community, their sense that such command is not only appealing but unavoidable. Then I drove to Iran in my campervan and saw that the warmth of the films wasn’t just a textual hypothesis, it’s something that meets you everywhere there. Now when I look at Jafar Panahi’s The White Balloon or Abbas Kiarostami’s And Life Goes On, I see their humanism starting not from the image outwards (a hope) but coming into the frame from beyond its edges (a fact). What I’ve experienced in my trips to Iran is not only in the room when I watch films from Iran, it’s between me and the screen. The more we live, the more things are in the room (countries, adventures, trepidations, boredoms, shocks, certainties, abstractions, dreads, sunsets). The movie comes at us at the speed of light, 3x10^ metres per second, through these things. The light is refracted by its journey through them. The movie reveals itself. To think of this crowded room is to wonder about films we’ve never seen. I’ve never watched Anatomy of a Murder or Donnie Darko. When I do, will they be better than if I had seen them earlier? If so, the logical conclusion is to watch no films until you are old. Or watch films three times, when you are 15, 45 and 75 - our lives as three-act structures, as triptychs. I finish this article five days later, after seeing films on the jury of Moscow’s 2-in-i film festival (named after Kira Muratova’s film). The best movie was a triptych, Sofia’s Last Ambulance, The best movie I saw in Moscow was a triptych, ‘Sofia’s Last Ambulance’, about a team of three Bulgarians Paramedic trinity: ‘Sofia’s Last Ambulance’ about a team of three Bulgarians who drive around Sofia on medical emergencies. As in Kiarostami’s 10, we see not the world, just the faces of the three, in close-up, as we hear the screams of patients or the crackle of the radio telling them to go to another incident. One young face, one middle-aged face, one old face. They sit side by side in the cab like they’re watching a movie. I identified most with the middle-aged character, but in 15 years’ time will I have shifted towards the older doctor? The day after I saw this film, I went to see Andrei Rublev’s most famous icon. Trinity, a depiction of the three angels who visit Abraham in ‘Genesis’. The greatness of Sofia’s Last Ambulance comes from the rigour of what it excludes visually - the patients. Rublev’s painting excludes Abraham and Sarah, who are usually central to the story. A triptych of rigorous exclusion - of offscreen suffering. The painting is like the poster for the film. When I go home, I look up Kira Muratova’s filmography - and see that one of the few of her films I haven’t seen is Three Stories (Tri Istorii). © December 2012 | Sight&Sound 1 17 The Industry BUSINESS NEWS & OPINION DEVELOPMENT TALE AMERICAN PI Animal magic: ‘Life of Pi’ benefited from a protracted development schedule as it allowed digital technology to catch up with the demands of the book Yann Martel’s bestselling fantasy adventure was always going to be a hot property in Hollywood but it still took years to reach the screen By Charles Gant When a book wins the Man Booker Prize and goes on to sell millions of copies worldwide, Hollywood will always have its eye on a film adaptation. But in the case of Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, the challenges were daunting. The story of a shipwrecked 17-year-old Indian boy on a lifeboat with a zebra, hyena, orangutan and Bengal tiger, it seemed to have a potential mismatch between the budget needed to mount the production and the likely commercial appeal. Even if you get it right, there’s no role for a major movie star - how do you sell Cast Away without Tom Hanks? At Fox 2000, the division of 20th Century Fox that has created hits from books such as The Devil Wears Prada, Marley & Me and the Percy Jackson series, president Elizabeth Gabler loved Life of Pi from the start, but her interest only became firm when, a year after its 2001 publication, in-house producer Gil Netter announced he had a screenwriter who had come up with a promising take on the material. Optioning the book for Dean Georgaris to adapt, Gabler and Netter began a journey that would take exactly ten years to complete. The first speed bump was that Georgaris - who at the time had yet to see a screenplay made into a feature, but whose credits now include The Manchurian Candidate remake - never actually delivered a script to Fox, due to delays in his schedule. Consequently, when M. Night Shyamalan signalled an interest in writing and directing his own adaptation, Gabler jumped at the opportunity. But Shyamalan also proved too busy. “He never did anything either,” explains Gabler. “He was really unavailable due to all the different movies he was making, and we were reluctant to wait, so we moved on. Those two people never did anything, apart from having meetings with us. I’m sure that Dean did work, but I don’t know what it was, because we never saw it.” A fresh start arrived in 2005 in the form of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, with co-writer Guillaume Faurant, and several screenplay drafts followed throughout 2006. But Jeunet’s insistence that only live animals be used caused too many headaches for Fox. Says Gabler, “We tried very hard to see how to make his version, but at that time, the advances in technology were not strong enough to where he felt comfortable using CG animals. The process he wanted to use, we thought, was fraught with danger. For example, you would have to have the tiger in the boat. You couldn’t put a hyena in the same boat. You’d have to wash it out with bleach and then shoot the hyena. You obviously couldn’t put a child or a young man in the boat with the tiger, or any of those other animals either. So it was a constant switching, and different boats, and none of us could figure out a way to make sense to do it that was within any reasonable time period and consequently budget. Every time we went back to the drawing board, it just escalated. And so it was a sad parting of the ways.” Although it was reported in the trade press that Alfonso Cuaron was also in the mix to direct, Gabler insists he was never involved. Instead, it was interest from Ang Lee that finally broke the logjam. “It was my dream to work with Ang,” says Gabler. “He’s one of those directors you literally hope that you have something good enough to submit to some day. And he’d passed on everything we’d sent him so far. One of our chairmen at the time, Tom Rothman, was close to him - he was the man who distributed The Wedding Banquet when he was at the Samuel Goldwyn Company, and they made The Ice Storm at Fox Searchlight. So I met him, and Ang said, ‘Why would a studio want to make this movie?’ But we knew that he had made movies of very difficult subject-matters and made them 18 I Sight&Sound | December 2012 THE NUMBERS: GERMAN CINEMA IN THE UK accessible and commercial worldwide. He really has taken on many different genres. As my boss Tom said, ‘If he’s afraid of it, you have a chance to get him.’ And I guess that proved true.” Lee was committed to Taking Woodstock at that time, but finally, after eight months, was ready to turn his attention to Pi. For the screenwriter, Gabler’s suggestion of Finding Neverland scribe David Magee immediately struck a chord. “Ang said, ‘Oh, I’ve been dying to work with him. In fact we almost did a project together a couple of years ago, but there were some rights issues on it and it fell apart’ It was fortuitous. David was a big fan of the book, and was obviously still dying to work with Ang as well. In his first draft, you could see the movie. They did a lot of research, a lot of travelling. He had a lot of artistic consultants working with him; he had one survivor of a pretty long stretch on a shipwreck. A lot of veracity It was a long process and there were times when it was not going to happen. There were definitely moments of darkness went into the creation of the screenplay.” Asked to explain the difference in the approaches of Lee and Jeunet, Gabler says: “Ang explores all the different theological and philosophical threads of the book much more, and the scope of the drama is very different. Ang’s film has a giant scope as far as the shipwreck, the experiences that Pi has. Everything is just much more dramatic and critical and realistic. Jean-Pierre’s was a much more, if you would, whimsical version.” At Fox, Gabler reported to joint chairmen Rothman and Jim Gianopulos (Rothman has since departed), and needed their approval to get it greenlit. “It was a long process, and there were times when it absolutely was not going to happen. There were definitely moments of darkness. Finally we got everything to a place where they felt it was actually physically possible, and the budget was where they were comfortable. Ang had brought the audition of Suraj Sharma, his choice for Pi, a 1 2-minute tape, and he also did a very extensive pre-visualisation of the shipwreck sequence. When we saw both those things together, that was the defining moment when they said, ‘OK, you can make the movie.’” It didn’t hurt that Lee was keen to explore 3D, which helped position Life of Pi as a mainstream spectacle, rather than a niche literary adaptation. But in the end it was the protracted development period that finally worked in the film’s favour, with digital technology catching up with the demands posed by the book. Says Gabler, “The technological advances that have been made were a giant, giant help. I feel, I hope, we are at a place right now where audiences are looking for something original, something that reaffirms the strength of the human spirit, and this movie does that.” © © ‘Life Of Pi’ opens on 20 December, and will be reviewed in a future issue By Charles Gant On the last Friday of September, two foreign- language films were pitched at the UK’s arthouse cinema fans on the eve of the BFI London Film Festival, hoping to take advantage of what can be a relatively uncluttered market. And in the battle between Leos Carax’s ‘Holy Motors’ and Christian Petzold’s ‘Barbara’, it was clear that the latter was always going to be the underdog. A Cannes darling. Artificial Eye’s ‘Holy Motors’ benefited from a highly visible press campaign and lead reviews in the broadsheets, including five stars from Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian. ‘Barbara’, from Soda Pictures, was also well reviewed, but often less ecstatically and less prominently. While Soda distribution boss Kate Gerova agrees that “reviews remain highly important for world-cinema movies”, the trajectory of the two films confirms that critical heat is only part of the story. While ‘Holy Motors’ dominated the first weekend with £49,000 from 23 screens, compared with ‘Barbara’ on £23,000 with 12, successive strong holds from the German picture meant that by week three, it found itself four places higher than ‘Holy Motors’ in the UK box-office chart. After 24 days of play, ‘Barbara’ had an impressive gross of £130,826. Although Soda had discussed moving its film after ‘Holy Motors’ muscled in on its chosen release date, Gerova explains, “We were always relying on the fact that it was ‘Barbara’ that was going to get the word of mouth. We had to hold our nerve. We just felt that audiences would respond, and they did.” When acquiring the title after the Berlin Film Festival, nationality was never viewed by Soda as a selling point. “I cannot say that there is a German audience in the UK in the way that there is definitely a French audience,” says Gerova. “It really does all come back to the quality of the film.” Nevertheless, the box- office chart below tells its own story. While an equivalent chart for French-language films would prominently feature romance (‘Amelie’), comedy (‘Untouchable’), thrillers (‘Tell No Against the wall: Nina Hoss in ‘Barbara’ One’) and biopics celebrating French cultural icons (‘La Vie en rose’, ‘Coco Before Chanel’), UK audiences for German stories have been more commonly drawn to political fare. The Communist era in East Germany, in particular, has given rise to ‘Good Bye, Lenin!’, ‘The Lives of Others’ and now the 1980-set ‘Barbara’. For Gerova, the success of these films is more about authenticity, a topic that emerged in the recent London Film Festival industry discussion, ‘Understanding the Hearts and Minds of UK Audiences’. “‘The Lives of Others’ and ‘Downfall’ and now ‘Barbara’ shine this very authentic light for an audience,” says Gerova. “[They are] so believable, and they just put you there, and that’s the thing that resonates. And if there is a political strength, then good. In the cinema landscape as a whole, you don’t necessarily see audiences coming out for politicised film.” © GERMAN-LANGUAGE FILMS AT UK BOX OFFICE Film The Lives of Others Downfall Good Bye, Lenin!

IN PRODUCTION Hunting for audiences: Tabu’ failed to translate critical approbation into commercial success Is Tabits disappointing showing at the UK box office a sign that press critics are losing their influence over the arthouse crowd? By David Locke The changing role and nature of film criticism has been debated at length in previous editions of Sight & Sound, especially with regard to the proliferation of new social media. We now find ourselves in an increasingly digital environment where access to potential consumers is instant, and largely unfiltered. One relatively hard and fast rule for distributors looking to release specialised product into a competitive marketplace has been to seek positive notices from prominent critics. Niche/foreign-language/specialised (delete as per preference) titles seeking UK distribution have always stood a much better chance of being acquired if they had the support of the press, especially the broadsheets. The advocacy of The Guardian’sFQlQi Bradshaw, in particular, has become increasingly important, and the general industry perception is that, where a specialised title is concerned, he alone has the power to translate words into ticket sales. A positive critical opinion, distilled into a soundbite, has usually been essential to form one plank of the film’s press and advertising campaign - alongside other marketable factors such as the auteur’s status and, if possible, a festival prize or two. In the past couple of years, several supposedly difficult titles have received positive reviews and gone on to overachieve: Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s epic Once upon a Time in Anatolia, Patricio Guzman’s masterful Nostalgia for the Light dJid Niche titles seeking UK distribution have always stood a better chance of being acquired if they had the support of the press the documentary Bill Cunningham: New York are three that come to mind. But what happens when a film seemingly has everything lined up - critical approbation and an appealing campaign - and yet fails to make any impression on the more adventurous filmgoer? There are many examples of this, but perhaps none so significant in recent memory as Tabu, by Portuguese director Miguel Gomes. This FW. Murnau-inspired reflection on Europe’s colonial past won both the FIPRESCI prize and the Alfred Bauer award. An impish poetic meditation on melodrama, slapstick and passion, it was praised to the rafters. With all doubts about marketability banished by the critical acclaim, UK indie distributors jostled to bag it. Of course. Tabu had no hope of achieving the success of The Artist- to which it was erroneously compared - and its director is not yet well known in this country, but when released on 7 September with all the required elements in place, it was expected to find an appreciative, if select, audience. The Daily Telegraph’s Tim Robey and The Independent on Sunday’s Jonathan Romney both awarded it five stars, while distributor New Wave must have been particularly delighted when Bradshaw’s rave review appeared. Under a bold headline declaring that the film “isn’t just for cinephiles”, he called it “a gem”. And yet, and yet... Released in a sensible 1 1 locations. Tabu took a very disappointing three-day gross of £9,751. It’s first seven days at its lead location in London’s West End garnered a shade over £5k. As a point of comparison, Barbara’s first weekend gross was greater than Tabu’s totdl first-week takings. It is difficult to pinpoint why audiences didn’t respond to Tabu. The film was released during a spate of inclement weather, but that didn’t affect The Queen of Versailles, released on the same date. So if the critics, Bradshaw included, are no longer an effective barometer of what the arthouse public will go for, what new tactics and reserves can distributors and exhibitors draw on to reach their prospective audiences? It will be intriguing to see what emerges. © • Joanna Hogg, director of ‘Unrelated’ and ‘Archipelago; has started shooting her third feature.

He is both prolific and resourceful in how he finances films and gets them into distribution. “The knack of raising money is figuring out first of all who would be interested in giving money to any particular film,” he suggests. “Those people are completely different.” It helps, too, that he has a record of “coming in on budget” and has had a number of financial successes. “Then, you look for opportunities... Somebody wants a film done on such and such. Then, you think, ‘Well, is that interesting to me? Could I make that into an interesting story?’ You decide on that basis because you know there is money attached. To be honest, very often the choices made in terms of what films to do are sometimes market-based, not purely creative.” Gibney was passing through London in mid-October, accompanying his latest feature doc Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God to the London Film Festival. The HBO- backed film, which painstakingly documents sex-abuse scandals within the Catholic church, following a trail from Milwaukee to the Vatican, is being given a theatrical release in the US. At the same time Gibney was also busy finishing his Lance Armstrong doc. The Road Back (diS it was originally titled.) Supported by Sony Pictures, this focuses on Armstrong’s attempt to come out of retirement in 2009 to try to win the Tour de France yet again. Inevitably, the revelations about doping in the cycling world have forced Gibney to rework the film. Meanwhile, he has also recently completed The Last Gladiators, a doc about Chris ‘Knuckles’ Nilan, an ice hockey enforcer, which is being ‘roadshowed’ by its US distributors, shown on one-night stands at cities across America with Nilan in attendance. There is a constant that runs through much of Gibney’s work. From Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room (2005) to Client-g: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer (2010), to Mea Maxima Culpa to the Lance Armstrong doc, the films have explored characters or institutions that have pursued a code of silence when it comes to their own wrongdoing. “I am interested in deception and self-deception,” he states. The challenge is financing films that probe such uncomfortable areas. “It’s always different,” Gibney says. “I tell people who are raising money that you have to think of it like a political campaign.” Gibney’s career doesn’t tally with romantic images of American documentary-makers like D.A. Pennebaker or the Maysles brothers making films on the hoof. He is a businessman as well as an artist. “Everything changed for me when I wrote and produced a film called The Trials of Henry Kissinger, which no broadcaster would touch,” he recalls. The film, partly supported by the BBC, finally reached an audience in cinemas. It dawned on the director that even if he couldn’t rely on TV to support his films, they could potentially work on the big screen. “That taught me a lesson, a good lesson, that there can be a market for well-told stories.” There have been anguished debates in documentary circles recently about how close filmmakers should allow themselves to become to their corporate patrons. Gibney’s argument is that it doesn’t really matter where the money comes from as long as there is transparency and the director maintains editorial control. On Client-g, his backers included Wall Street investors who clearly were hoping he would do a demolition job on disgraced former New York governor Spitzer, who had targeted the financial sector before resigning in the wake of a sex scandal. “A lot of investment in that came from hedge-fund guys who, I think, wanted to revel in Spitzer’s embarrassment,” he recalls. Gibney made it clear to his investors that he wasn’t interested in muckraking and that they would have no impact on the tone of the film. “The deal with them was explicit. You put the money into an account. So long as I don’t go over budget, I have access to that account and you don’t. That’s it, pure and simple.” He also acknowledges that broadcasters can have agendas. “You have to be careful. It’s tough out there being able to maintain editorial independence. Sometimes, it helps to have access to the markets and to be able to balance other interests.” If you make the film entertaining, he suggests, you may have a better chance of being allowed to say what you want. To be honest, the choices made in terms of what films to do are sometimes market- based, not purely creative Nor is the director apologetic about his recent deal with the Content Media Corporation, which saw Content buying a 50-per-cent stake in his company. Jigsaw. “The deal was supposed to be an economic alliance. The idea was that Content was going to allow me to grow my company,” Gibney says. “The key aspect for me was that there were no restrictions put on what kind of projects I could do or what kind of partners I could do them with.” Through the alliance, the filmmaker suggests, he now has “clout” in the marketplace when it comes to launching his own projects or those of other directors whose work he produces. Gibney fights his corner in an aggressive fashion that doesn’t tally with the stereotype of documentary-makers as dreamy types without a head for business. He sued distributor THINKFilm when it failed to capitalise on the Oscar won by Taxi to the Dark Side. He admits the part it played in helping win the Oscar, but was dismayed by the lack of follow-up. “It wasn’t like, ‘Oh gosh, I should have had bigger grosses!”’ he says. “We took THINKfilm to arbitration because we were astonished that when we won the Oscar... there was no publicity, no prints in theatres and nothing happened.” Generally, Gibney produces as well as directs his films. “It gives you more control. I am pretty good at raising money and I am pretty good at reassuring the people that I raise money from that I am not going to go over budget.” One reason his films reach audiences is arguably that he is sympathetic, even to the ostensible villains. “Very often, when you get up close with somebody, you can’t help but be interested in them as human beings,” he says. “On the Enron film, there was a lot of pressure on me to make my portrait of [bosses] Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling more vicious... I said, ‘I am sorry, you may think that is more commercially viable for you, but I am interested in them as human beings.’ If they become monsters, then we can’t see how we are complicit in frauds like Enron. The fact is these are human traits.” © December 2012 | Sight&Sound | 23 Festivals BUSAN STEALING THE SHOW Daylight robbery: Choi Donghoon’s charismatic heist caper The Thieves’ has become South Korea’s biggest domestic hit at the box office Busan is an eccentric mix of devout cinephilic respect and rampant, high-gloss commercialism - with an excellent selection of films By David Jenkins Before each screening at the 17th Busan International Film Festival, an announcement is made asking that no one exit the auditorium until all credits have rolled. There’s even one cinema where it is politely requested that patrons do not cross their legs during screenings in order to avoid kicking the seat in front. And yet the large majority of screenings take place in vast, neon-hued multiplexes that reek of synthetic butter and are situated on the upper floors of two adjoining (and gigantic) department stores. This eccentric combination of devout cinephilic respect and rampant, high- gloss commercialism neatly sums up Busan, as it’s a festival where executive programmer Kim Jiseok has pulled together a commendably broad (and largely excellent) selection of titles, which then play out in a landscape littered with skyscrapers, architectural follies and roads that are as wide as they are long. Since 2006, South Korea’s biggest domestic box-office hit had been Bong Joonho’s mutant tadpole satire The Host (which in itself is a strange mix of high art and big money), but it was finally - and perhaps understandably - toppled this year by Choi Donghoon’s charismatic heist caper The Thieves (Dodookdeul), which received a triumphant outdoor screening at the festival’s Film Centre. Like all of Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean’s films rolled into one, this polished saga sees a gang of crack Korean art thieves deciding to team up with their Hong Kong-based counterpart to pull off an impossible-odds diamond heist in Macao. The Thieves wdiS actually the second-best film set in Macao at the festival, as top honours go to Joao Pedro Rodrigues and Joao Rui Guerra da Mata’s sublime The Last Time I Saw Macao (A Ultima Vez Que Vi Macau). Part city symphony, part post-colonial essay film, part lurid neo- nczr and part romantic homage to Sternberg and Marker, this dazzling and original work follows a Portuguese filmmaker to Macao at the harried request of an old transsexual paramour, who claims to be in trouble. Employing a hard-boiled mystery template as an excuse to dissect the cultural evolution of a city, it’s a film that cements Portugal’s cinematic- powerhouse status and would play in a neat double bill with Miguel Gomes’s Tabu. The best new Korean title I saw this year was Jeon Kyuhwan’s extraordinary hardcore gothic fantasia The Weight (Muge), which frankly wipes the floor with Kim Kiduk’s operatically awful Venice Golden Lion-winner Pietd. Cleverly recalibrating Korean cinema’s predilection for harrowing violence and protracted misery. Jeon offers a lightly surreal and darkly comic retelling of The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, here with the hunchback as a monosyllabic Films play out in a landscape littered with skyscrapers, architectural follies and roads that are as wide as they are long Dance macabre: The Weight’ 24 I Sight&Sound | December 2012 TRIESTE EYE OF THE STORM mortician who goes to bizarre lengths to care for his unhinged brother, a pre-op transsexual. Japan’s ultra-prolific Sono Sion returned with his most sedate film in some time, The Land of Hope (Kibo no kuni), an absurdist parable in the vein of Passport to Pimlico that concerns a family whose house is right on the edge of a nuclear fallout boundary. It’s a patchy film which perhaps could have been edited a little more tightly, but Sono’s political and emotional insights remain piercing and he proves yet again - this time with assiduous use of Mahler’s Symphony No. lo- that he’s a guy who really knows his classical music. China’s Wang Bing brought his traumatising but brilliant Venice Orizzonti prizewinner Three Sisters (San zimei) to Busan, and again there was a small irony to viewing an epic (but intimate) documentary about chronic poverty and child labour in the Chinese countryside while sitting above eight glistening floors of consumer goods. At nearly two-and-a-half hours, it’s what you might call a tough film, but Wang’s rigorous technique, languorous pacing and unflagging empathy for his subjects (three dirt-poor, pre-teen sisters) puts him right up there with Pedro Costa as one of cinema’s high poets of the disenfranchised masses. Iran’s Mohsen Makhmalbaf returned with a plea for peace and religious tolerance in his occasionally charming DV experiment The Gardener Filmed in Israel’s Hanging Gardens of Haifa and comprising a series of theatrically staged father-son dialogues, it could be seen as a radical articulation of Makhmalbaf ’s fervent ideological preoccupations or an overly poeticised m^ange of half-baked ideas about religion, conflict and image-making. The one film that offered an entirely opposing view of art and commercialism (and one which would be of unique interest to Sight & Sound rodidors) is Seo Wontae’s 56-minute documentary portrait Tony Rayns and a Quarter Century of Korean Cinema. Rayns, who somehow manages to balance life as a journalistic powerhouse and a kind of Western gatekeeper to new Asian cinema, ruefully explains the meaning of the term “hand-to- mouth existence” to a table of young directors in a bar. They simply laugh at the notion and gulp back their beer. With its declarations of love and respect from Lee Changdong, Hong Sangsoo and other Korean luminaries, Seo’s film is less a cover-all life story than it is a lilting portrait of a lone man attempting to retain his independent ideals in the face of an all-encroaching capitalist scourge. Which kind of sums up Busan as a whole, really. © Mystery games: The Last Time I Saw Macao’ By Simon Merle Trieste’s I Mille Occhi is one of those many small festivals held day in, day out all over the world. It runs for seven days in the lone arthouse of Italy’s easternmost cily, mainly for a local audience. Foreigners are warmly welcomed, of course, but they will have to know the language. Given the festival’s minuscule budget, it’s impossible for it to subtitle everything in English, and equally impossible to show too much in English or with English- only subtitles. This means programming a lot of Italian films - and worse things could happen, as artistic director Sergio Matiassich (formerly Grmek) German! and his team demonstrated once again this September. What makes I Mille Occhi such a remarkable endeavour is its attitude: it shows almost exclusively ‘old’ films, but doesn’t consider itself a place for historians or archivists - it’s not looking back. For I Mille Occhi, a film is always new because times change, which makes a difference to the way we see the work; if the festival is interested in a film or a director at a certain moment in time, there’s a reason for it. There are few places where programmers have such trust in their own civic instincts, not to mention their curiosity. German! calls it research, in line with the Rossellinian spirit that animates the event as a whole. I Mille Occhi shows almost exclusively ‘old’ films, but doesn’t consider itself a place for historians - it’s not looking back Appropriately, a few of Germani’s choices were gambles. To give one example: Gianni Fontaine’s ‘Okiba, non vendermi!’ (1955), a film considered lost and only recently found by a young collector in one of those magic attics. For German!, that’s reason enough to show it - he had to see it, so why not do that in good company? - and he programmed it unseen. ‘Okiba, non vendermi!’ turned out to be a nice find: a remarkably assured piece of missionaty cinema with often surprising grit. For additional edge, German! presented it with a pair of little-seen gems on religious subjects: Guido Brignone’s slightly screwy heritage comedy ‘Ginevra degli Almieri’ (1935) and Oreste Palella’s done-with- papal-blessings biopic ‘Caterina da Siena’ (1947). Both proved quite rewarding to watch, ‘Ginevra degli Almieri’ for its supreme craftsmanship, ‘Caterina da Siena’ for its lack of it; made immediately after World War II, with scarcely any means and a third-echelon director, the film is moving in the same way as a parish passion-play. It’s these kinds of dynamics - inspired guesses combined with enormous knowledge and the guts to act on both - that make I Mille Occhi so special. This edition’s programme was organised around the complete works of director Valerio Zurlini, occasioned by a genuine historical find: ‘La promessa’ (1970), the sole television OKlBA.^ A rare find: ‘Okiba, non vendermi!’ movie Zurlini ever did. It was aired once on the Italian TV channel RAI, and that was it; the screening at I Mille Occhi marked its second-ever presentation. ‘La promessa’ is so arcane that it’s not even mentioned in any of the major studies of Zurlini; German! only found out about it during his research into Gianni Da Campo,Zurlini’s sole pupil. Initial research su gg ested the film was lost; then, by the kind of accident that happens when the conscious seeker keeps his sensors synched to certain signs, an RAI employee found the tapes in a corner of the channel’s archive. ‘La promessa’ proved quite the revelation: humble in size as it is compared with the robust grandeur of Zurlini’s other works, its artistic decisiveness is on a par with that of his masterpieces like the Golden Lion-winner ‘Family Diary’ (‘Cronaca familiare’, 1962) or ‘The Desert of the Tartars’ (‘II deserto dei Tartar!’, 1976). In some ways, with its three chapters detailing the lives of three Leningraders from the midst of the siege during World War II to the late stage of the thaw, ‘La promessa’ plays like a microcosm of Zurlini’s unrealised multi- part epic ‘II paradiso aM’ombra delle spade’, which would have chronicled more than a century of Italian colonial history. As Zurlini was such a melancholic, it seems fitting his greatest dream was realised only in morsels: the main arc and general narrative thrust here; the setting in his African passion ‘Out of Darkness’ (‘Seduto alia sua destra’, 1968); the final chapter in ‘La prima notte di quiete’ (1972); the initial idea (a meditation on the nature of duly) in ‘The Desert of the Tartars’. Zurlini’s early demise - as well as the small number of features he was able to direct (nine including ‘La promessa’) - make him something of an unfinished master. I Mille Occhi went to uncommon lengths to give as full a picture of his work as possible, which meant not only showing masses of miscellanea (commercials; a documentary on his friend Alberto Burri; a tape of a theatrical production) but also listing in the programme several unrealised projects, alongside the death of Pasolini and a painting Zurlini wasn’t able to see on his last visit to Venice - elements of a mental landscape that materialises in part through the films actually screened. I Mille Occhi is a festival that sees itself as an eye in the storm of history - a moment of calm around which everything that could and should and shouldn’t have been rages and swirls. © December 2012 | Sight&Sound | 25 Reader offers COMPETITIONS THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC: FIVE STEELBOOK EDITIONS TO BE WON SEARCHING FOR SUGAR MAN: THREE COPIES ON DVD AND BLU-RAYTO BE WON Masters of Cinema presents a new restoration of Carl Theodor Dreyer’s enigmatic The Passion of Joan of Arc, now for the first time making its way to Blu-ray.
