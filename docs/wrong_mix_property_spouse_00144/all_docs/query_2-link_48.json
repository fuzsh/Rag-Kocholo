        "text": "Judge sides with DC Comics in battle with heirs of Superman co-creator\n\nDC Comics and its owner Warner Bros. will retain all rights to continue using the character in books, films, television and other mediums.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — DC Comics will retain its rights to Superman after a judge ruled Wednesday that the heirs of one of the superhero's co-creators signed away their ability to reclaim copyrights to the Man of Steel roughly 20 years ago.\n\nThe ruling means that DC Comics and its owner Warner Bros. will retain all rights to continue using the character in books, films, television and other mediums, including a the film reboot planned for next year.\n\nDC Comics sued the heirs of artist Joe Shuster in 2010, seeking a ruling that they lost their ability to try to reclaim the superhero's copyrights in 1992. U.S. District Court Judge Otis Wright II agreed, stating that Shuster's sister and brother relinquished any chance to reclaim Superman copyrights in exchange for annual pension payments from DC Comics.\n\nShuster and writer Jerry Siegel created Superman, who made his comic book debut in 1938 in Action Comics (hash)1. Both men battled for increased compensation for the superhero throughout their lives and Siegel's heirs have also fought DC for a stake in copyrights to Superman.\n\nShuster's heirs had argued that the copyright agreements could be terminated under provisions that allowed creators of works made before 1978 a mechanism to reclaim their rights. Wright ruled that the decision by Shuster's sister to accept higher annual payments created a new agreement and the pre-1978 rights no longer applied.\n\n\"We respectfully disagree with its factual and legal conclusions, and it is surprising given that the judge appeared to emphatically agree with our position at the summary judgment hearing,\" the Shusters' attorney Marc Toberoff wrote in a statement. He declined further comment, and Warner Bros. and its attorney Daniel Petrocelli also declined comment on the ruling.\n\nToberoff had argued that an agreement altering copyright interests would have been much longer than the one-page 1992 agreement between DC Comics and Shuster's sister, Joan Shuster Peavy, and his brother, Frank.\n\nThe latest Superman film, \"Man of Steel\" is scheduled to land in theaters in 2013. Director Zach Snyder told fans earlier this year at Comic-Con that his film would make the superhero more relatable than previous depictions that showed him as \"a big blue Boy Scout up on the throne and you can't really touch him.\"\n\nIn April, the $412 check that DC Comics wrote to acquire Superman and other creative works by Shuster and Siegel sold for $160,000 in an online auction.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWine gets in the spirit with new liquor blends\n\nHard liquor is showing a softer side as producers shake things up with new blends that put wine and spirits in the same bottle.\n\nMICHELLE LOCKE\n\nCognac blended with moscato? Pink wine mixed with port? And how about a mashup of sparkling white wine and vodka? Hard liquor is showing a softer side as producers shake things up with new blends that put wine and spirits in the same bottle.\n\n\"Companies are going out of the box,\" observes Ted Carmon, spirits buyer for the BevMo! liquor chain.\n\nThere's no official category name so far — Spirited wines? Laid-back liquors? — but Carmon traces liquor's \"anything goes\" movement to Pinnacle Whipped, the wildly popular whipped-cream flavored vodka that came out a couple of years ago. \"That really rewrote the rules on what kind of flavors could be used.\"\n\nBill Newlands, president of Beam Inc., which bought Pinnacle Vodka earlier this year, sees the intensely flavored Whipped as playing into a trend of consumers \"whether it's an alcohol beverage or anything else, looking for more flavor reward.\" They're looking for two things, he says, \"flavor and flavor intensity.\"\n\nThat quest influenced Beam's latest product, Courvoisier Gold, which blends French cognac with moscato wine from the South of France. Research indicated customers, particularly women, wanted a cognac with less alcohol but more flavor, and Gold answers on both counts coming in at 36 proof, or 18 percent alcohol by volume, well below the 40 percent (80 proof) of traditional cognac. Suggested retail for a 750-milliliter bottle is $24.99.\n\nGold follows last year's introduction of Courvoisier Rose, which blends cognac with French red wine grapes. Both blends can be drunk on the rocks or mixed into cocktails.\n\nGold and Rose are both grape-on-grape affairs since cognac, a type of brandy made in the Cognac wine region in France, is a distilled grape spirit.\n\nBut TUNE, a new product from ABSOLUT, goes in a different direction, blending grain-based vodka with a sparkling white wine, New Zealand sauvignon blanc to be precise. It comes in a Champagne-style bottle decorated with gold stars, swirls and other patterns which has an outer wrapper of silver, black and gold that \"unzips\" for presentation pizazz. TUNE, so named for the dual notes of vodka and wine, is 14 percent alcohol by volume and has a suggested retail of $31.99.\n\nAnother beverage taking a lighter touch is Croft Pink, which is a port (not a liquor but wine that's been fortified by addition of a spirit). Croft traces its roots to 1588, making classic ruby and tawny ports. Croft Pink is made from traditional port grapes but with light contact between the wine and the grape skins, resulting in a light ruby color. It was made with cocktails in mind to introduce port to a new audience. Alcohol content is 19.5 percent by volume, similar to traditional port. Suggested retail is $19.99 for a 750-milliliter bottle.\n\nLain Bradford, a South Carolina wine and spirits writer who blogs at winetalk.org, has noticed the blurring of the lines between wines and spirits, especially in restaurants, for instance margaritas made with fruit wine that's been flavored to taste like tequila. As for the flavored spirits trend, \"It almost feels like the vodka producers are just walking down the grocery aisle and saying, 'Let's try this flavor,'\" he says, noting that flavored rums and tequilas also are being introduced.\n\nHe sees the new spirit-wine products as tailored to Americans' fondness for all things sweet. \"The sweet market has taken off so much. I think a lot of the spirit houses are capitalizing on the sweet market right now and introducing spirits with sweet wine to come out with drinks that will be a good cross-over. It's a good way to bridge sweet wine drinkers with new spirits and the classic spirits.\"\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.croftpink.com\n\nhttp://winetalk.org\n\nhttp://www.absolut.com/us/tune\n\n↧\n\nRestaurant review: Brewmaster's Tavern in Williamsburg\n\nHistoric surroundings and an extensive menu do much to make the Brewmaster's Tavern a noteworthy destination.\n\nHistoric surroundings and an extensive menu do much to make the Brewmaster's Tavern in Williamsburg a noteworthy destination. Add in freshly brewed beers and some attractive off-peak menu deals, and it's not hard to understand why the restaurant has prospered.\n\nWe're always a bit wary of operations that have encyclopedic bills of fare, since too often such variety means tradeoffs involving quality and freshness. That's not the case, however, at Brewmaster's Tavern; our dining experience exceeded our expectations.\n\nDinner possibilities include light options like Shepherd's Pie ($10.99) and Beer Battered Fish and Chips ($12.99).\n\nHeartier presentations range from Lemon Chicken ($16.99) and Braised Lamb Shank ($18.99) to an Old Fashioned Turkey Dinner ($17.99) and Roast Prime Rib ($24.99).\n\nStarter choices don't stake out much new territory. Instead, they're restricted to the likes of Mozzarella Sticks ($8.99), Fried Potato Skins ($8.99) and Cherry Pepper Calamari ($10.99).\n\nWe decided to preface our main course with an order of Gorgonzola Garlic Bread ($6.99).\n\n\"Adequate but not exceptional\" was our assessment; the bread (in actuality, a split grinder roll) had been spread with garlic butter and Gorgonzola crumbles before being toasted under the broiler. A dish of the house marinara, a hefty sauce with intense tomato paste flavor, was provided for dipping purposes.\n\nA Petite New York Sirloin ($16.99), prepared just as we'd ordered it, offered plenty in the line of red-meat enjoyment. Served with mashed, skin-on potatoes and a vegetable selection, the plate suggested that the Tavern's \"Lighter Fare\" might be more than adequate for most appetites.\n\nPrepared with a traditional cracker and paprika topping, the Baked Scallops ($20.99) were just fine, thank you. Cooked 'till translucent and full of from-the-sea sweetness, the scallops did justice to our shore dinner cravings.\n\nMuch the same could be said of the Baked Stuffed Shrimp ($23.99) and the Grilled Maple Glazed Salmon ($19.99) we ordered. In both instance the marquee ingredient was fresh and appealing; the preparation, skillful.\n\nWe appreciated the subtle kiss of maple the fish had been afforded; the shrimp were cooked just enough and featured a buttery crumb stuffing.\n\nAs we've noted before, restaurants locally seem to observe a predictable calendar of vegetable offerings. In the spring it's usually asparagus that's in vogue, with a zucchini-summer squash medley making widespread appearances around July first.\n\nWhen cold weather arrives, butternut squash takes over the local veggie limelight, and Brewmaster's kitchen proved to be right on schedule in implementing that changeover. Lightly sweetened and delicately spiced, the mashed squash was altogether enjoyable.\n\n\"Hearty\" dinners at Brewmaster's also include a choice of soup or garden salad.\n\nThe greens were just fine, and the split pea soup being offered the evening we stopped by had an appealing, slightly smoky flavor profile.\n\nOwned by the same business interests that operate the Opa Opa Brewing Company, Brewmaster's features that organization's malt beverages. A wine list of about two dozen bottlings is available as well.\n\nAmong the homemade dessert selections the menu discusses (all are priced at $5.99) are Jack Daniel's Corn Bread Pudding, Hot Apple Crisp a la Mode, and a Brewmaster Brownie Sundae.\n\nThe Triple Chocolate Cake, fashioned from devil's food layers spread with dark and milk chocolate ganache, was an exercise in dark, sweet intensity,\n\nInfused with mellow boozy goodness, the restaurant's Bailey's Irish Cream Creme Brulee elevated that commonplace favorite to a whole new level of indulgence.\n\nIn addition to its dinner offerings, Brewmaster's is prepared to serve sandwich selections such as a half-pound Brewmaster's Burger ($9.99), a Monte Cristo ($9.99), and a Fried Oyster Po' Boy ($10.99).\n\nPizza now had a place on the agenda, with possibilities including custom creations as well as assembled-to-order pies.\n\nServing breakfast on weekends until 2 p.m., Brewmaster's serves up an extensive list of morning food creations -- omelets, egg platters, pancakes, and the like.\n\nThe restaurant itself features a traditional decor that's a mash-up of historically authentic and country-cutesy.

Job cuts are expected.\n\nBy MICHELLE CHAPMAN, AP Business Writer\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Newsweek plans to end its print publication after 80 years and will shift to an all-digital format aimed at online users starting in early 2013. Job cuts are expected.\n\nNewsweek's last U.S. print edition will be its Dec. 31 issue.\n\nWith more and more consumers on the go and using their cell phones and tablets to receive the news, media organizations have had to increasingly shift more of their emphasis online.\n\nSmartMoney, for example, announced in June that it was shuttering its print publication in favor of a digital format. Dow Jones & Co., a unit of News Corp., said at the time that 25 positions at SmartMoney would be eliminated.\n\nNewsweek's decision does not come as a complete surprise. Barry Diller, the head of the company that owns Newsweek, announced in July that the publication was examining its future as a weekly print magazine. Diller said then that producing a weekly news magazine in print form wasn't easy.\n\nThe announcement of the change was made by Tina Brown, editor-in-chief and founder of The Newsweek Daily Beast Co., on The Daily Beast website Thursday.\n\n\"In our judgment, we have reached a tipping point at which we can most efficiently and effectively reach our readers in all-digital format,\" she said.\n\nBrown said staff cuts are expected, but didn't give a specific figure. She also said that Newsweek's editorial and print operations would be streamlined in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nBrown said that the online publication will be called Newsweek Global and will be a single, worldwide edition that requires a paid subscription. It will be available for tablets and online reading, with certain content available on The Daily Beast website.\n\n\"We are transitioning Newsweek, not saying goodbye to it,\" she said.\n\n↧\n\nMovie trailer: 'Carrie' remake with Chloe Moretz\n\nBased on the horror tale by Stephen King, the film arrives in theaters on March 13.\n\nA new take on the Stephen King horror tale about Carrie White, a shy girl outcast by her peers and sheltered by her deeply religious mother.

The July 13 appearance will be the initial stop on his first stadium tour. Aldean made the announcement Thursday in the shadow of the Green Monster with an assist from Red Sox executives. Members of the team made a celebratory clip for the singer that played on Fenway's video board.\n\nThe Georgia native released his fifth album, \"Night Train,\" this week. That title is an apt metaphor for his career, which has been steaming along on a steep trajectory.\n\nAldean is one of country's top draws. His yearlong \"My Kinda Party\" tour wraps later this month after more than 1.9 million tickets sold.\n\n↧\n\nBruce Springsteen explains why he's supporting Obama, urges support for Elizabeth Warren\n\nSpringsteen called Obama's four years in office \"a really rough ride.\"\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — After vowing not to get involved in this year's presidential election, Bruce Springsteen is supporting Barack Obama again, saying he believes Obama is the best person to lead America.\n\nThe Boss posted a message on his website Wednesday night endorsing Obama's re-election, saying he had been \"getting asked a lot about where I stand.\" Springsteen is making his debut on the 2012 campaign trail Thursday at events in Cleveland and Ames, Iowa, with former President Bill Clinton.\n\nSpringsteen supported Obama in 2008. In his letter, he called Obama's four years in office \"a really rough ride\" because of the \"economic chaos\" from President George W.

Try a skirt.'\"\n\nULA ILNYTZKY\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — A new exhibition is hailing the fashion sense of Katharine Hepburn, whose trademark khakis and open-collar shirts were decidedly unconventional in the 1930s and 40s, when girdles and stockings were the order of the day.\n\nThe fiercely independent Hepburn famously once said: \"Anytime I hear a man say he prefers a woman in a skirt, I say, 'Try one. Try a skirt.'\"\n\nBut skirts and dresses abound in \"Katharine Hepburn: Dressed for Stage and Screen\" at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, which opens Thursday.\n\nHepburn, who died in 2003 at age 96, saved almost all the costumes from her long career that included four Oscars and such memorable films as \"The Philadelphia Story,\" ''The African Queen,\" ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" and \"On Golden Pond.\" Forty are on view at the exhibition, which runs through Jan. 12.\n\nOne of the first things visitors will notice is how slender Hepburn was — she had a 20-inch waist — and a grouping of seven khaki pants artfully arranged on a pair of mannequin legs.\n\n\"The fact that she wore slacks and wanted to be comfortable influenced women's ready-to-wear in the United States,\" said Jean Druesedow, director of the Kent State University Museum, which was given 700 items from Hepburn's estate. Kent State was selected because it's one of the country's only museums of performance clothes.\n\n\"That image said to the American woman 'Look you don't have to be in your girdle and stockings and tight dress. You can be comfortable. That was probably the first aspect of becoming a fashion icon,\" said Druesedow, a co-curator of the exhibition.\n\nThe strong-willed actress known for taking charge of her career worked closely with all her designers to decide her performing wardrobe.\n\n\"They understood what would help her characters, what she would feel comfortable wearing ... how it would support the story,\" Druesedow said.\n\nMargaret Furse, an English designer who created Hepburn's wardrobes for \"The Lion in Winter,\" ''A Delicate Balance\" and \"Love Among the Ruins,\" went shopping with the star and talked extensively about what kinds of things would set the scene.\n\nAmong the highlights is a stunning satin and lace wedding gown created by Howard Greer for her role as Stella Surrege in \"The Lake.\" The 1933 production was her first major Broadway role and also a huge flop. Writer and wit Dorothy Parker described her performance as running \"the gamut of emotion from A to B.\" The experience taught Hepburn to have a bigger say in what roles she accepted, said Barbara Cohen-Stratyner, curator of exhibitions at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.\n\nWhen she really liked a costume she had copies made for herself, sometimes in a different color or fabric. A silk dress and coat by Norman Hartnell from \"Suddenly, Last Summer\" and a green raw silk jumpsuit by Valentina from \"The Philadelphia Story\" were among the pieces she had copied.\n\nComfort was paramount to Hepburn — being able to throw her leg over a chair or sit on the floor. She always wore her 'uniform' — khakis and a shirt — to rehearsals and pant ensembles to publicity appearances.\n\nA companion book, \"Katharine Hepburn: Rebel Chic,\" describes how RKO executives hid Hepburn's trousers in an effort to persuade her to abandon them.\n\n\"Her response was to threaten to walk around the lot naked. Though she only stripped down as far as her silk underwear before stepping out of her dressing room, she made her point — and she got her trousers back,\" fashion writer Nancy MacDonell wrote in an essay for the book.\n\nBut comfort didn't mean sacrificing style — and she certainly knew how to be glamorous especially when a role called for it.\n\nIn her private life, she shopped at the major cutting-edge New York couturiers and worked with the best costume shops of the period, including Muriel King and Valentina, said Cohen-Stratyner.\n\n\"She really appreciated good fabric and good construction,\" she said. \"Even her trousers are couture.\"\n\nThe exhibition is supplemented by film clips, movie posters, and archival photographs of Hepburn wearing the very costumes worn by the mannequins. Her false eyelashes, makeup trays and sensible shoes are also on display.\n\n___\n\nIf You Go...\n\nKATHARINE HEPBURN EXHIBIT: \"Katharine Hepburn: Dressed for Stage and Screen\" at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, 40 Lincoln Center Plaza (65th Street west of Broadway)\n\nhttp://www.nypl.org/events/exhibitions/katharine-hepburn-dressed-stage-and-screen\n\nOpen Monday-Saturday noon to 6 p.m. and until 8 p.m. on Thursdays\n\nFree admission\n\n↧\n\nOff the Menu: Theme dining boosts revenue, reputation\n\nThese events are great ways to fill slow nights and to introduce the restaurant to customers that might not have visited before.\n\nSearching for ways to boost revenue and reputation, restaurants at all price levels from casual to elegant are promoting theme dining.\n\nIt's a strategy designed to capitalize on the public's seemingly insatiable appetite for exotic foods and food-related experiences, an interest that seems to be have been little diminished by the recent recession.\n\nWhite-tablecloth establishments and casual bistros alike are putting on wine tastings, beer dinners, and unusual holiday celebrations like never before.\n\nOrganized around various ethnic cuisines, high-profile vineyards and breweries, or unusual edibles, these events are great ways to fill slow nights and to introduce the restaurant to customers that might not have visited before.\n\nSuch special dinners can also motivate kitchen staffs, giving chefs and line cooks the chance to work with ingredients and create dishes they otherwise don't often get to prepare.\n\nSocial media like Facebook and Twitter offer restaurants that want to promote special events new ways to effectively get the word out. An eatery (or chef) that has assiduously cultivated an on-line following has a built-in audience for any special menus or occasions that establishment chooses to organize.\n\nHere in Western New England several venues – the Delaney House in Holyoke, the Farm Table in Bernardston, and the various Max Restaurants in Massachusetts and Connecticut – have been aggressively filling seats with special events, a business-building practice others might do well to emulate.\n\n↧\n\nRestaurant cell phone distractions still irritate\n\nOwners who once relied mostly on \"no cell phones, please\" signs, increasingly are experimenting with everything from penalties for using phones, discounts for not and outright bans on photography.\n\nMICHAEL HILL\n\nAssociated Press\n\nALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — The digital divide is wider than ever between diners who talk, tweet and snap pictures mid-meal and those who wish they'd just shut up, shut down and be present.\n\nCaught at the center of the discord are restaurant owners and chefs, who must walk the careful line of good customer service for both those who dine under the influence of smart phones, and those who won't. But as the devices have morphed into an unrelenting appendage for texting, photography and games, more restaurateurs are challenged to keep the peace.\n\nOwners who once relied mostly on \"no cell phones, please\" signs, increasingly are experimenting with everything from penalties for using phones, discounts for not and outright bans on photography.\n\n\"There's no place to get away from the chatter,\" said Julie Liberty of Miami, who started the Facebook page \"Ban Cell Phones From Restaurants\" earlier this year. \"Everything has a soundtrack, including when you go into the ladies room. That's just not right.\"\n\nIt's a touchy issue. Consider the crush of news coverage Eva Restaurant in Los Angeles generated when it began offering patrons a 5 percent discount if they leave their phone at the door. Online comments ranged from cheers of \"YES!\" to others who said their phones would have to be pried from their cold, dead hands.\n\nThe policy is working, though. Eva's Rom Toulon said about 40 percent of our customers will leave their cell phones at the door.\n\n\"After a few cocktails and glasses of wine, it can be challenging to remember that you left the phone behind,\" he said.\n\nThe burst of headlines for Eva came after a Burlington, Vt., deli took on cyber-folk hero status for posting a sign informing customers that $3 will be added to their bill \"if you fail to get off your phone while at the counter. It's rude.\" Disgusted diners are doing their part too with games like \"phone stack,\" in which everyone places their phones in a stack in the middle of the table. The first person who reaches for their phone pays the bill for all.\n\nThese are more creative approaches to the no cell-phone signs now common in restaurants ranging from highbrow to quick-eats. The landmark Boston restaurant Locke-Ober asks diners — in language appropriate for a place with a dress code — to \"kindly refrain from using cellular phones.\" In Albany, N.Y., the Hamilton Street Cafe has a more direct, hand-drawn \"No cell phones at the counter\" sign with a phone with a red \"X'' through it.\n\nOwner Sue Dayton said the sign by the counter helps keep the lunch line moving.\n\n\"You get a half-hour for lunch. You walk up here and you have to stand behind someone not paying attention enough to say what kind of bread they want on their BLT because they're on their cell phone,\" Dayton said.\n\nIrritation over distracted dining has broadened with the rise of photo-sharing apps like Instagram. The popular online scrapbook Pinterest is clogged with pictures of everything from pan fried noodles to poutine snapped moments before digestion. Chefs — who, as a rule, put a premium on control — don't always take kindly to their dining rooms becoming shooting galleries.\n\nGrant Achatz, the famous Chicago-based molecular gastronomist, wrote a much-forwarded post several years ago grousing about diners who snap the meal away and even try to video his staff without asking permission. \"I can't imagine how celebrities feel,\" he wrote. \"No wonder they punch the paparazzi out when they get the chance.\"\n\nSome restaurateurs go with the digital flow. Sarabeth Levine, of New York City-based Sarabeth's, said she's perfectly fine with people chatting, playing games or even taking pictures. It's free advertising, after all.\n\n\"I'm happy to have our customers,\" Levine said. \"They come, they tweet, they Facebook, they bring their children. It's high energy to begin with. I mean, people are noisy even in the way they speak today.\"\n\nOther restaurants go as far as to bar picture taking, like David Chang's Ko in Manhattan. Others take a middle ground, like the high-end Washington, D.C., restaurant Rogue 24, where hostesses politely tell guests that if they do take pictures, please do so without a distracting flash.\n\n\"I mean you can't fight it,\" said owner R. J. Cooper. \"Why fight a losing battle?\"\n\nActually, the battle might already be lost.\n\nThe use of hand-held devices at the table is implicitly encouraged at the growing number of restaurants that offer Wi-Fi access or accept payment via smartphone. The Manhattan restaurant Comodo even encourages guests to upload pictures of their dishes to Instagram with the hashtag (hash)comodomenu to create a user-generated \"Instagram menu.\" Sharing trends are likely to accelerate as the generation who has no memory of a world before cell phones comes of age.\n\nAlready, about one in five U.S. adults say they share online when eating a meal with others, and more than a third of teens do the same, according to the 2012 State of Mobile Etiquette Survey for Intel Corp.\n\nThe same survey found 81 percent of U.S. adults believe mobile manners are getting worse, up 6 percentage points from last year. A Zagat survey this month found most respondents disapproving of texting, tweeting and emailing when eating out, but a majority accepted picture taking.\n\n\"I think it's about having more time under our belt with what the new normal is,\" said etiquette expert Anna Post, the great-great-granddaughter of Emily Post.\n\nWhile the technology is new, the rules of etiquette are old-fashioned common sense. Silence your phone in restaurants and don't answer unless there's a very good reason, like a sick kid back home. And if you do answer, excuse yourself from the table. Try to keep your phone off the table, it signals to your companions that you waiting for something better.\n\nAs for taking pictures, Post said consider the sort of place you're in — busy pub or cloistered bistro? — and who you're with.\n\n\"Ask yourself, 'Just because I want to take a photo of my food, is this the right place? Am I with the right people for this to be OK?'\" Post said. \"The answer can't always be yes.\"\n\n↧\n\nNBC cancels 'Animal Practice'\n\nThe show will be replaced by \"Whitney,\" which returns for its second-season debut on Nov. 14.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Crystal the monkey is hanging up her doctor's coat.\n\nNBC said Thursday it's pulling the low-rated sitcom \"Animal Practice,\" with the last episode to air Nov. 7.\n\nThe series stars Justin Kirk (\"Weeds\") as a veterinarian at a New York animal hospital. His co-stars include Crystal, a Capuchin monkey with the \"Hangover\" movie sequel among her credits.\n\n\"Animal Practice\" had the dubious distinction of annoying Olympic viewers: NBC interrupted the Summer Games' closing ceremony to air the sitcom's debut episode.\n\nThis week, \"Animal Practice\" drew less than 4 million viewers. That compares to the more than 14 million averaged by top-rated sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory\" on CBS.\n\n\"Animal Practice\" will be replaced by \"Whitney,\" starring Whitney Cummings, which returns for its second-season debut 8 p.m. on Nov. 14.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nMoby Dick still causing a stir 161 years later\n\nWell call me Ishmael!

Maybe.\n\nJustin Bieber? Perhaps.\n\nFree porn? Duh!\n\nTry the title of a classic American novel published exactly 161 years ago today in London.\n\nYes, \"Moby Dick\" still knows how to cause a stir, more than a century and a half after Herman Melville released his book set on the high seas as Captain Ahab and his crew chase down the infamous white whale.\n\n(And as many of our readers probably know, not only were many of the early scenes in the novel set in Massachusetts (New Bedford and Nantucket), Melville wrote the book while living in Pittsfield, where he purchased the farm house known as Arrowhead in 1850. And by the way, if you have have to chance to visit Arrowhead, take a look out the window above the spot where Melville reportedly wrote \"Moby Dick.\" Mount Greylock looms in the distance and looks very much like the large hump on the back of a whale. Coincidence? I think not!)\n\nSo why is the title of book among the most searched phrases on Google this week, generating over a million searches on Wednesday alone? Perhaps Google helped out a little bit, by featuring a \"Google doodle\" (those drawings that sometime appear on the Google search page) of a crew of fisherman in pursuit of a white whale.\n\n(Then again, maybe all those Zepheads in love with \"Led Zeppelin II\" just happened to flood the Internet the same day that literary scholars stumbled across Google's tribute to the Peqoud and thought to themselves, \"Hey, look!

It garnered more than 170,000 views and generated equal amounts of buzz and hometown pride among Western Massachusetts residents and expatriates alike.\n\nThe sequel is called \"(I'm from) Western Mass.,\" and like \"413\" it features scenes from the area spliced with footage of Westchesterson mingling with the natives, seeing the sights and singing the praises of this end of the state.\n\n\"There's plenty of trees\n\nAnd lots of grass.\n\nYou get what you need in Western Mass.\n\nOh, and he also has a cool car. Specifically, his ride for the video is a vintage Dodge Charger replica of the General Lee from the TV show \"Dukes of Hazard\".\n\nAnd if you look closely, there's a cameo of Westchesterson and comedian Steven Wright in downtown Northampton.\n\nThe video is officially to be released on Friday, according to Westchesterson's website, although the video was posted on YouTube on Thursday afternoon. It already generated close to 300 views in an hour.\n\nThe release is intended to coincide with a local tour beginning Oct. 27 in Agawam. Dates and locations of upcoming performances are posted on his website\n\nThe only criticism of \"413\" was that it was centered mostly in the lower Pioneer Valley, primarily Springfield, Agawam and West Springfield, at the expense of parts to the north and west.\n\nWestchesterson corrects that 413 faux pas by including scenes from Northampton, Shelburne, Greenfield and Stockbridge along with scenes of Westcherston out and about at the Big E.\n\nIn a scene filmed in downtown Stockbridge, Westchester raps about Alice's Restaurant and the Norman Rockwell Museum.\n\n\"Hey baby, I'm in the Berkshires.\n\nWe're gonna party like it's the Berkshires.\n\nI wear a cardigan in the Berkshires.\n\nYo, and I don't even care cuz it's the Berkshires.\"\n\n↧\n\nScott Prior exhibit opens at William Baczek Fine Arts\n\nAn opening reception with the artist known for his contemporary realism landscapes, still life and figurative works will be held Saturday.\n\nA solo exhibition featuring 40 years of paintings, drawings and prints by Northampton artist Scott Prior opened at William Baczek Fine Arts on Wednesday.\n\nAn opening reception with the artist known for his contemporary realism landscapes, still life and figurative works will be held on Oct. 20 from 5 to 7 p.m., along with a signing of his first major book, “Scott Prior: A Monograph.”\n\n“As appreciated as Scott’s paintings are and how avidly they are collected, there was never a full-pledged book to examine the scope and history of his art. William Baczek Fine Arts has published many catalogues for our artists but never a book of this size,” said William Baczek, who met Prior while directing the Hart Gallery at the Guild Art Centre.\n\n“It was over two years in the making, and although Scott did not want the book to be a retrospective of all of his work, it nonetheless covers his development as an artist over 40 years.”\n\nThe coffee table book is the first comprehensive overview of paintings and drawings by Prior and contains 118 reproductions spanning his entire career. Also included are essays by Prior, Baczek, art author Richard Morange and Trevor Fairbrother, former curator of contemporary art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.\n\n“Because Scott lives locally, it is easy for people to sometimes forget the magnitude of his renown,” said Baczek. “Here in the Pioneer Valley we have musicians, writers, artists and scholars living in close proximity to us and are incredibly fortunate to have a wealth of incredible talent whose fame and reputation extend nationally and internationally.”\n\n“Scott Prior: A Monograph” is $55 and available at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts bookstore, on Amazon.com and online at wbfinearts.com.\n\nThe associated exhibit, which runs from Oct. 17 to Nov. 25, includes the “Red Lion Diner”, a painting that a short time ago resurfaced after being lost for many years. Created in 1979 for AT&T, the painting vanished after the telephone conglomerate was broken up.\n\n“I didn’t know it had disappeared until somebody here in town called and said that someone was looking to see who the artist was. They didn’t even know who it was painted by and they contacted a gallery here in town and they finally put it together that it was mine,” said Prior. “I don’t quite get it but for some reason I didn’t sign this painting. It was a major painting, too, and I think I might have spent four or five months on it.”\n\nThe painting of the local landmark 1930s Worcester Railroad red dining car on Pearl Street had been hidden away in a collector’s basement for the past fifteen years.\n\n“This person bought it for themselves but we’re borrowing that for this exhibition. I just saw it the other day and it sort of blew me away what I was able to do 30 years ago,” said Prior. “It’s a highly detailed painting with a lot of work in it and I’m so happy that it’s going to be shown again in town right around the corner from the subject.”\n\nPrior’s work has shown in one-person and group shows in the United States and abroad. It shines in private collections and can be seen in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and Boston-area DeCordova Museum, Danforth Museum, and Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University galleries.\n\nFamiliar subjects in his work are his wife, Nanny Vonnegut, and family, countless configurations of luminous still lifes and locations like California’s Muir Beach, his Northampton gardens and backyard, and the iconic Whately Diner Fillin’ Station.\n\nOne of the happiest times in Prior’s career was in 2001 when the DeCordova Museum, focused on modern and contemporary art by artists with connections to New England, held a mid-career retrospective and published an art catalogue of his work.\n\n“That was a real validation of my career up to that point, which at that time was almost 30 years old. It was an occasion to gather in a lot of paintings from the previous years and put them all together in one show and it was an important event for me,” said Prior.\n\nPrior has lived in the Pioneer Valley ever since graduating from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1971.\n\n“I used to build telescopes and wasn’t going to be an artist at all but Calculus made me change my mind. I was not good in math so I jumped out of that pretty quickly,” said Prior. “I had always done art and my mother signed me up for my first oil painting lessons when I was younger. My parents encouraged me but they didn’t push it.”\n\nPrior also shared his thoughts on the belief many artists have that turns into an ultimate goal in their careers: You are not complete until a New York City gallery represents you.\n\n“What I learned over the years is that it actually isn’t the be all and end all of a career. You can do quite well in many other galleries in different cities,” said Prior, who is represented by the Nancy Hoffman Gallery in New York City and Alpha Gallery in Boston. “It’s not an overnight eureka moment. It’s a slow process over the years of multiple events that teach you things. You learn something from each of those experiences every time and it’s an accumulation of knowledge.”\n\nScott Prior’s opening reception and book signing for “Scott Prior: A Monograph” is free to the public.

Running time: 102 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.\n\nJames Patterson titled his 12th Alex Cross crime novel simply \"Cross.\" The filmmakers who adapted it expanded the title to \"Alex Cross.\"\n\nThey might as well have gone for broke and called it \"Tyler Perry's Madea's Stab at Expanding Her-His Hollywood Marketability as James Patterson's Alex Cross.\"\n\nPerry's name will draw his fans in. Patterson's name will draw his fans in. There's no trace of Madea in director Rob Cohen's adaptation, yet the spirit of the sassy grandma inevitably hangs over the project for viewers curious to see Perry playing it straight and dramatic.\n\nAlex Cross the man and \"Alex Cross\" the movie wind up suffering for it. It's perfectly reasonable for Perry to try to broaden his enormous popularity beyond the Madea lineage in his own raucous portraits of family life. It's also perfectly reasonable to say that casting Perry as Cross was a bad idea, though it's not necessarily the worst in a movie built on bad ideas.\n\nPerry has little allure as supposedly brilliant criminal profiler Cross. He looks the part of Patterson's big, athletic hero. And no one expects a Morgan Freeman, who played Cross in \"Kiss the Girls\" and \"Along Came a Spider.\" But Perry is low-key bordering on sleepwalker dull, and the standard-issue cop-vs.-serial-killer story presents Cross as more of a dopey psycho-babbler than a guy whose incisive mind cuts right to the heart of the case.\n\nIn this scenario, Cross is early on in his career, a star on the Detroit police department along with partner and best pal Thomas Kane (Edward Burns). They're tracking a killer code-named Picasso (Matthew Fox) who's working his way up the food chain with murders and attempted murders of execs at an international conglomerate, with the big boss, Giles Mercier (Jean Reno), clearly the ultimate target.\n\nIt's unclear just how the showy crimes against underlings are going to get Picasso closer to his goal, rather than simply alerting authorities to put extra security on Mercier. But such is the hazy thinking of the twisted mind, and such is the hazier thinking of Hollywood hacks who don't care about making sense.\n\nIt made enough sense to Patterson, though, a producer on the movie.\n\nDirector Cohen (\"The Fast and the Furious\") and screenwriters Marc Moss and Kerry Williamson weave in as bland a home-life as imaginable for Cross, with his perfect wife (Carmen Ejogo), their perfect kids and his perfect live-in mom (Cicely Tyson). The filmmakers offer a miserly personal life for Kane, who's feeling his way through a new romance with a fellow detective (Monica Ashe).\n\nAs the irascible police chief, John C. McGinley looks permanently constipated and wishing he could be anywhere but here.\n\nUnlike Freeman's R-rated Alex Cross movies, the grisly crimes are only talking points, the images sanitized to a Perry-friendly PG-13 level. Cohen's strong suit usually is action, but fights, chases and gunplay are mostly a jumble of quick cuts. An opening scene in which Cross literally dodges a bullet a second or more after it's fired kind of sums up the action trajectory, which eventually devolves from bad police procedural into a bad \"Dirty Harry\" copycat.\n\nFox plays Picasso like a drop-out from the Heath Ledger's Joker school of cackling villainy, repeatedly calling Cross on the phone to toss around dreary taunts.\n\nCross' profile technique amounts to \"I don't have any concrete information about this perp so I'm going to spout vague generalities while furrowing my brow.\" He blathers on about Picasso as a rogue sociopath, a narcissist out to make someone suffer, maybe his mom or his dad or himself or the whole world.\n\n\"Who the hell knows?\" Cross says.\n\nTyler Perry's Alex Cross certainly doesn't. Neither does Tyler Perry.\n\n↧\n\nMovie review: 'Paranormal 4' has little regard for plot\n\n“Paranormal Activity 4,” a Paramount release, is rated R for language and some violence/terror. Running time: 95 minutes. By JUSTIN LOWE Hollywood Reporter for the Associated Press Mockumentary filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (Catfish) know a thing or two about misdirecting an audience, as they proved again with 2011’s “Paranormal Activity 3.” Together with returning screenwriter Christopher Landon,...\n\n“Paranormal Activity 4,” a Paramount release, is rated R for language and some violence/terror. Running time: 95 minutes.\n\nBy JUSTIN LOWE\n\nHollywood Reporter\n\nfor the Associated Press\n\nMockumentary filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (Catfish) know a thing or two about misdirecting an audience, as they proved again with 2011’s “Paranormal Activity 3.” Together with returning screenwriter Christopher Landon, this time around they seem short on new ideas, however, relying more on the series’ reputation for low-budget thrills to attract audiences. Regardless, by now Paramount’s franchise is a brand unto itself, and it’s unlikely that anything will stop the first few waves of fans boosting “Paranormal Activity 4” up the chart until at least through Halloween.\n\nQuickly recapping with flashbacks and documentary-style introductory cards the conclusion of “Paranormal Activity 2,” when in a prequel to 2007’s original film Katie (Katie Featherston) killed her sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) and abducted her nephew Hunter (William Juan Prieto), the current version jumps ahead to 2011, relocating the action from California to Nevada and introducing an entirely new family. Teenager Alex (Kathryn Newton), her 6-year-old brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp) and their parents (Stephen Dunham and Alexondra Lee) live a typical middle-class suburban life, even if they think their neighbors across the street – single mother Katie and her young son Robbie (Brady Allen) – are a bit of an odd pair.\n\nAfter Katie is unexpectedly and mysteriously admitted to the hospital for some unknown illness, Alex’s mom inexplicably offers to take Robbie in while his mother is recovering. Alex soon begins to notice strange events coincident with Robbie’s arrival, while the young visitor’s insinuations increasingly draw Wyatt away from her. Other family members also begin to clue into the strange goings-on, with mysterious sounds, shifting furniture and alarmingly animated household objects suggesting something is seriously amiss.\n\nWith the help of her boyfriend Ben (Matt Shively), Alex sets up the family’s home video cameras and laptops to record Robbie’s late-night wanderings and vaguely sinister activities around the house. As Alex becomes more convinced that some evil presence is seeking her out, the mysterious forces behind Robbie’s visit become more assertive, squarely threatening the family’s survival while inexorably tracking back to the earlier abduction of Hunter.\n\nBy now the basis of the “Paranormal Activity” franchise, concerning Katie’s possession by a demonic force that results in a series of malevolently haunted houses, is well-known to those who care to follow each new iteration. The fourth installment adds very little new information while playing out the inevitably unpleasant outcomes that await the characters, preferring to recycle plot elements from previous films.\n\nFairly mild in tone and riffing – if not quite ripping – off a collection of horror classics that includes “The Shining,” “Rosemary’s Baby” and “Poltergeist,” both the franchise’s premise and its execution nevertheless remain rudimentary, with the narrative and character backstories representing more of a sketch than a fully realized vision of the supernatural world that Katie inhabits.\n\nAlthough Newton and Shively are likable enough in their roles as the sleuthing teens, the other performances remain perfunctory overall. Laptop webcams and camera phones are substituted for the earlier video-surveillance cams, but little has changed visually in the style of the filmmakers’ alternation of static and frantic hand-held shots, mixed with a surfeit of distracting closeups.\n\nAsymmetrically framed scenes, staccato editing techniques and oppressive ambient sound (and the ominous lack of a score) are substituted for any real narrative development, leaving a plot essentially consisting of a series of setups followed by frightening payoffs. Weak attempts to introduce a smattering of satanic symbology are belatedly superfluous. It’s just such lack of creative investment that inevitably leads to further sequels, if a theatrical audience can actually be sustained going forward.\n\n↧"
