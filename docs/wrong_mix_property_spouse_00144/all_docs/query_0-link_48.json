He also has no interest in talking about it. So since he's the one who does the descriptions for each, he will instead use this time to talk about the proper way to do preventative maintenance on your garage door.\n\nEvery 3 months or so you're going to want to inspect your door. See if the bottom seal fully closing. Make sure the door is aligned properly in the door frame and.... what's that? Oh nobody asked?.... okay.\n\nEmail: roughnightpodcast@gmail.com\n\nHOSTS\n\n@Allison_Faye\n\n@JonastyDrawz\n\n@kyleckelly_\n\nEDITOR/HOST\n\n@brycelkelly\n\nWhen the Reys move into their new Southern California home, little do they realize that the house is already occupied. After coming home one day to find the house in disarray -- but with no signs of forced entry or robbery -- they install a video surveillance system to catch ABSOLUTLY NOTHING!
