        "text": "Tag Archive for 'Kathryn Newton'\n\nAbigail (Blu-ray Review)\n\nHorror films are like preschoolers. They’re likely to test your limits and may even make you scream. The analogy is my own and it hits home for me. In my day job as an early childhood educator, I find myself in this predicament especially at the beginning of a new school year. When I approached […]\n\nABIGAIL Bites into Blu-ray in July!\n\nFrom Radio Silence comes the bloodthirsty, wild, and critically acclaimed vampire romp, ABIGAIL, available to own with all-new exclusive content on Digital June 25, 2024, and on Blu-ray™ and DVD July 9, 2024 from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. Hailed as “a Bloody Blast” (The Detroit News) and Certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, ABIGAIL brings a […]\n\n‘Lisa Frankenstein’ on Blu-ray April 9!\n\nKathryn Newton and Cole Sprouse star in Focus Features’ 80’s inspired dark comedy, LISA FRANKENSTEIN, available to own as a Collector’s Edition with never-before-seen bonus content on Digital March 29, 2024, and on Blu-ray and DVD April 9, 2024, from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. The electrifying bonus material includes a hilarious gag reel, deleted scenes, […]\n\nAnt-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania (4K UHD Blu-ray Review)\n\nKicking off Marvel’s “Phase 5” of its cinematic universe, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania will be arriving on 4K Ultra-HD Blu-ray on May 16th. Already available digitally and on Disney+, the film will be able to actually own and in its best possible presentation that day to go along with some nifty extras and Atmos […]\n\nFreaky – Killer Switch Edition (Blu-ray Review)\n\nIt surely sucks not being able to get to see movies I’m very excited about in the theater. Freaky is one of those films. Yes, it did have a theatrical release, but I’m not heading back to the theater anytime soon. Luckily this was a Blumhouse film and theatrically did well considering its budget. It […]\n\nFREAKY Slices Onto Blu-ray February 9th!\n\nPrepare for a FREAKY take on the body-swap movie which only Blumhouse, makers of Happy Death Day & The Purge franchise, could bring: a teenage girl switches bodies with a relentless serial killer! From the deliciously debased mind of writer-director Christopher Landon (Happy Death Day, the Paranormal Activity franchise) and prolific horror producer Jason Blum (Halloween, The Purge franchise), comes a horror-comedy about a […]\n\nIt’s Time 2 Get ‘Freaky’ (Movie Review)\n\nOn Friday the 13th, a deranged killer with a final girl’s body will wreak havoc at Blissfield High. The body-swap trope gets a slasher makeover (or is it the other way around?) in Christopher Landon’s new genre mashup. Vince Vaughn is the knife-wielding maniac, and Big Little Lies‘ Kathryn Newton is a shy teen who […]\n\nPokémon: Detective Pikachu (4K UHD Blu-ray Review)\n\nPokemon: Detective Pikachu was the first potentially “real” challenger to Avengers: Endgame’s box office championship belt, but fell just under 9 million shy of taking it. As Avengers was the fourth film with that moniker, so was Detective Pikachu the fourth Warner Bros produced Pokemon movie (Though not in any continuity as the first 3 […]\n\nBlockers (Blu-ray Review)\n\nWinding down the spring into summer movie season, there was the big hit move, A Quiet Place, which proved to be no joke. But, making the jokes was another solid film, Blockers. While it didn’t do gangbusters, the film proved to be a pretty solid hit financially. Add to that, it was very much well […]\n\nBlockers Is Like a Good Pixar Film, Something In It For Both Young & Old To Enjoy (Movie Review)\n\nI really hope this goes without saying, but you never know. The worst you can ever do is to assume. So here’s the million dollar question I feel I need to ask before we start legitimately talking about the new comedy film Blockers. You all know what the rooster in front of the word “Blockers” […]\n\n‘Paranormal Activity 4’ on Blu-ray January 29th!\n\nThe global horror sensation that has mesmerized fans around the world continues to terrify and thrill audiences with the latest installment in the franchise, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4, debuting on January 29, 2013 in a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack with UltraViolet™ and a Digital Copy. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4 continues the shocking story of the evil surrounding Katie […]\n\n‘Para4mal Activity’: The Voyage Home\n\nI can understand the ambivalence involved with caring about the fourth entry in a horror series, let alone one that has been churning out entries on a yearly basis. Paranormal Activity has been chugging along and providing yearly follow-ups that have been surprisingly effective for me. While the basic concept has not altered, I have […]"
