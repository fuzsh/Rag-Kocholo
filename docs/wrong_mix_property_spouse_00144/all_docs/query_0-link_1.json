He was 48.\n\nThe actor, who was usually credited as Stephen Dunham, also recurred on the WB’s “What I Like About You,” starring Amanda Bynes and Jenny Garth, and in 2009 on TBS’ “The Bill Engvall Show.” He guested on series including “Just Shoot Me!” and in 2011 on “Hot in Cleveland.”\n\nHe also appeared in many films, starring with Paul Provenza in 2000 in the independent film “Nothing Sacred” and appearing in supporting roles in “The Mummy,” Steven Spielberg’s “Catch Me If You Can” and Steven Soderbergh’s “Traffic.” He was memorable as the actor-waiter Dr. Chamberlain in the film “Monster in Law” with Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda and was last seen onscreen in Oliver Stone’s “Savages.”\n\nIn Dunham Bowers’ final film, “Paranormal Activity 4,” set for release in October, he and his wife, actress Alexondra Lee, will appear as husband and wife.\n\nBorn in Manchester, N.H., Dunham Bowers attended NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nIn addition to his wife, he is survived by his father, mother, brother and sister.\n\nDonations may be made to the National Brain Tumor Society or Kiva.org."
