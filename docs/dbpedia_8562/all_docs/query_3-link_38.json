        "text": "Andrei Tarkovsky (1932–1986)[1] was a Soviet filmmaker who is widely regarded as one of the greatest directors of all time.[2][3] His films are considered Romanticist and are often described as \"slow cinema\", with the average shot-length in his final three films being over a minute (compared to seconds for most modern films).[4] In his thirty-year career, Tarkovsky directed several student films and seven feature films,[3] co-directed a documentary, and wrote numerous screenplays. He also directed a stage play and wrote a book.\n\nBorn in the Soviet Union, Tarkovsky began his career at the State Institute of Cinematography, where he directed several student films.[5] In 1956, he made his directorial debut with the student film The Killers, an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's eponymous short story.[6] His first feature film was 1962's Ivan's Childhood, considered by some to be his most conventional film.[7] It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.[8] In 1966, he directed the biopic Andrei Rublev, which garnered him the International Critics' Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.[9]\n\nIn 1972, he directed the science fiction film Solaris, which was a response to what Tarkovsky saw as the \"phoniness\" of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).[10] Solaris was loosely based on the novel of the same title by Stanislaw Lem and won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival.[11][12] His next film was Mirror (1975). In 1976, Tarkovsky directed his only play—a stage production of William Shakespeare's Hamlet at the Lenkom Theatre. Viewing Tarkovsky as a dissident, Soviet authorities shut down the production after only a few performances.[13] His final film produced in the Soviet Union, Stalker (1979), garnered him the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at Cannes.[14]\n\nTarkovsky left the Soviet Union in 1979 and directed the film Nostalghia and the accompanying documentary Voyage in Time.[15] At the Cannes Film Festival, Nostalghia was awarded the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury but was blocked from receiving the Palme d'Or by Soviet authorities.[16] In 1985, he published a book, Sculpting in Time, in which he explored art and cinema.[17] His final film, The Sacrifice (1986), was produced in Sweden, shortly before his death from cancer. The film garnered Tarkovsky his second Grand Prix at Cannes, as well as a second International Critics' Prize, a Best Artistic Contribution, and another Prize of the Ecumenical Jury.[18] He was posthumously awarded the Lenin Prize in 1990, the most prestigious award in the Soviet Union.[19]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nTable featuring completed feature films by Andrei Tarkovsky Year Title Credited as Notes Ref.
