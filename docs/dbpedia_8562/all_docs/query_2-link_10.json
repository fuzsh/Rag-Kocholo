        "text": "(Dir. Andrei Tarkovsky, Soviet Union, 1966)\n\nAdding to the Beauty\n\nWhat do we think about when we engage art? When we gaze at a painting, do we appreciate it for its beauty – the images we see and perceive – or for the craftsmanship it took to create it? Depending on a person’s tastes and tolerance for any given art form, it’s probably a combination of both. Film as art is no different. For the masses movies are generally appraised based upon the stories they tell, the themes conveyed, and the performances delivered by its actors. For those with a deeper interest in film these aspects are still important, but there is also typically an added layer of evaluation that weighs the achievements of those behind the camera – the how and the why a sequence is captured at a particular angle, for example – and the stories that chronicle the making of – a director or writer’s inspiration for the film, the themes he or she wishes to convey, or the greater context in which the film is conceived. Looking at film through this perspective, then, is why we remember the works of great directors like Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, Akira Kurosawa, and Yasujiro Ozu and consider them true artists.\n\nI would add to that list Andrei Tarkovsky who may not be as well known as the four listed above, but has certainly been just as influential (especially on the work of my favorite living filmmaker, Terrence Malick). He was an artist in the vein of Carl Theodor Dreyer and Ingmar Bergman who openly and honestly wrestled with religion and had a penchant for long takes, sparse storytelling, and contemplative pacing. He’s probably best known today for his two sci-fi masterpieces Solaris and Stalker or his autobiographical filmic poem Mirror, but it’s one of his earliest films that remains his most enduring. Andrei Rublev is a medieval epic that chronicles the life of one of Russia’s most famous religious iconographers and the tumultuous nation in which he lived. And yet, Tarkovsky’s film is less strict biographical account of the real Andrei Rublev than it is a meditation on Russian society filtered through the pain of the past, the influence of Christianity on a nation’s history, and the struggle inherent in artistic pursuits.\n\nThis last point is perhaps what elevates Andrei Rublev above simply adhering to the tradition of cinematic epics (though it does succeed in this area as well – its set pieces, costumes, sweeping cinematography, and choreographed battle sequences are some of the grandest and most accomplished in all film history). From its opening, unrelated prologue featuring an ambitious inventor who takes to the sky in a primitive hot air balloon, Tarkovsky establishes his film as one highlighting the fruit of creative minds. And, as the elated inventor first marvels at the desolate countryside below only to plummet disastrously to the ground as his own invention fails him, Tarkovsky also suggests that choosing to create comes at a great cost.\n\nThe rest of Andrei Rublev, in its sprawling narrative comprised of semi-related vignettes, follows a handful of other creators who each approach their art and handle their setbacks differently. Andrei (Anatoly Solonitsyn) is one of three wandering monks who serve as iconographers as they traverse the Russian landscape in search of cathedrals to paint. While Andrei is renowned for his superior skills and seeks to portray the good in humankind, his friend Danil (Nikolai Grinko) is more pragmatic in his approach and their companion Kirill (Ivan Lapikov) desires recognition for his work and even abandons the faith consumed with jealousy of Andrei’s talents. Then, there is the old painter Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev) who holds a rather cynical view of humankind and as such sees his work as a burden. Foma (Mikhail Kononov) and Andrei’s other protégés are skilled, yet stubborn, impatient, or indifferent with their brushes. And finally, Boriska (Nikolai Burlyayev), a young boy who crosses paths with Andrei at a crucial juncture in the monk’s life, serves as the most significant fellow creator he encounters on his travels. Andrei has given up on his own art feeling uninspired and seeking atonement for a sin he committed by taking a vow of silence when he meets the son of a respected bell-maker who died in the plague.\n\nYoung Boriska only enters the film in its final third, but the story of how he risks shame, punishment, and even execution for the chance to create is easily the beating heart of Tarkovsky’s work. When messengers from the royal prince come searching for the boy’s father to cast a bell for a new cathedral, he boldly offers to oversee the project himself. Boriska is often overconfident and harsh as he orders the workers around though they are much older and far more experienced than him. But, as the project nears completion, the boy’s head begins to fill with doubt. What if it breaks easily? What if it doesn’t ring? All the while, the silent Andrei watches on skeptically alongside the other villagers. But, when the bell does ring the crowd erupts into cheers of delight as Boriska collapses to the ground in relief. Inspired by the boy’s ambition and commitment to his craft, the monk runs to his side, breaks his silence, and vows to continue painting, his redemption now complete.\n\nChoosing to create can come at a great cost indeed. There is risk – risk of failure, that the creation might be misused or abused, that the creation might betray its creator. Throughout the film, Andrei suffers great loss as he pursues his passion to paint – friendships that cave under the weight of envy, apprentices that storm off after disagreements, and even the loss of some of his works as a cruel invading force sets fire to a cathedral that he and his guild spent months painting. But, in the end Tarkovsky reveals that the struggle and the pain are more than worth it. After nearly three and a half hours of stark black-and-white imagery, the director brilliantly and jarringly cuts to an epilogue of sorts as the camera pans over a number of the iconographer’s real frescos in eye-popping color. It’s a sequence full of emotion as we are given a glimpse into what Andrei’s efforts have yielded. And, what a beautiful glimpse it is!\n\nIt’s safe to assume the Andrei of Tarkovsky’s film creates because he too was created by one who took great risk in breathing his creation into being. Somewhat surprisingly, then, the tale of a monk who lived hundreds of years ago in medieval Russia serves as a charge to each and every one of us to dare to create, to push through the pain in pursuing art to add to the beauty. And, that is precisely what Tarkovsky has done with Andrei Rublev, a tremendously gorgeous and affecting film. And, not only does it boast powerful themes and performances from its actors and a host of masterful filmmaking flourishes, it also provides a unique depiction of the very creative process that produces the art we appreciate. For that, it will always be remembered for the classic it is.\n\n[This evaluation was originally written for film site Reel World Theology.]\n\n20) Make Way for Tomorrow (Dir. Leo McCarey, United States, 1937)\n\n“Honor thy father and mother.”\n\nAny film significant enough to influence cinematic master Yasujiro Ozu is undoubtedly worthy of our attention today in spite of its accepted “forgotten classic” status. And, though Ozu’s arguable opus Tokyo Story and Leo McCarey’s early Hollywood masterpiece Make Way for Tomorrow share a central concern regarding the treatment of the elderly, the filmmakers take their similarly themed narratives in separate directions. Ozu’s film charts the widespread national changes in a post-war Japan within the context of one family whose grown children find their pace and modern way of life suddenly inconsistent with the slower, more traditional manner in which their aging parents still live.\n\nMcCarey’s film likewise anticipates this gap in generational understanding, but he’s far more concerned with the trajectory of the relationship between the father and mother than he is the one between parents and their ungrateful children, though he poignantly captures that too. McCarey’s story is a beautifully tender tale of new romance as its septuagenarian couple rediscovers their love when faced with an unexpected, perhaps definite separation.\n\nThe stark contrast between Make Way for Tomorrow and more well-established canonical classics is staggering. Where other Hollywood staples from American cinema’s supposed golden age have all but faded in relevance, McCarey’s remains surprisingly fresh. Its depiction of romantic love between two elderly characters is still unparalleled in film today, and its challenge of the traditional family unit still shocks. And, McCarey’s ability to oscillate between humor and tragedy, sometimes within the course of a few lines of memorable dialogue, elevates his film from trite cliché or pandering sentimentalism, but it achieves considerable depths of pathos to remain of cinema’s most emotionally devastating works of art.\n\n19) M (Dir. Fritz Lang, Germany, 1931)\n\n“I can’t help what I do!”\n\nIn Fritz Lang’s M, little Elsie Beckmann is in grave danger when there’s a twisted child killer on the loose. And, Lang stages one of the most unsettling, yet effective sequences in all of cinema as he introduces the murderer by way of his shadow on his own wanted poster all while the girl’s mother, waiting at home, grows increasingly anxious regarding her daughter’s tardiness. Finally, a static shot of the girl’s empty dinner chair gives way to a pair of shots of her ball rolling away and her balloon getting caught in telephone wires. It’s a terrifying and audacious introduction to this chilling cat-and-mouse tale that still stuns audiences today.\n\nThe film follows the police as they desperately try to catch this criminal, the murderer – played to eerie perfection by Peter Lorre in a career-high performance – as he evades his captors, and the city’s organized underworld of crime as it too bands together to oust this chief of sinners. The tension builds, and Lang’s shifting camera catches these three sides from every possible angle in the proto-noir style he helped pioneer. It also remains one of the most thrilling early talkies with its densely layered soundtrack as well as intentionally disturbing bouts of silence.\n\nBut, what really sets M apart from its contemporaries and the films it influenced is its unexpected finale that finds criminals in the judge’s seat as they get to the killer before the authorities. In front of a host of wrongdoers and even other murderers, this child killer’s sins are laid bare, and when a plea of insanity finds the man on hands and knees, Lang draws our attention to the great hypocrisy unfolding that may even garner our sympathy for this mentally unstable individual in desperate need of help. We’re left to wonder: are our lives free enough of blemishes that we might cast the first stone?\n\n18) Taste of Cherry (Dir. Abbas Kiarostami, Iran, 1997)\n\n“You want to give it all up? You want to give up the taste of cherries?”\n\nSo few filmmakers extol the preciousness of life without sinking to the tropes of melodrama or pandering sentimentalism, but the work of Abbas Kiarostami is a welcome exception. His entire Nineties output found ways to celebrate life – whether amidst the aftermath of a devastating earthquake as in Life, And Nothing More and Through the Olive Trees, or in the juxtaposition of differing traditions in The Wind Will Carry Us, or when a person decides to end his own life as in his masterpiece Taste of Cherry.\n\nNotably more linear than his other Nineties triumph Close-Up, Taste of Cherry is still by no means an easy or readily accessible film. Its story wanders as its subject drives around Tehran looking for someone to bury his body after he commits suicide. Understandably turned down by most people he encounters, Mr. Badii’s story becomes a meditation on life and death as three different men give very different reasons for their disapproval of his actions. It’s not the first two men’s objections – a fear of the law and an appeal to religious morality – that give him reason to pause and reflect, but the third man’s focus on all that Badii would give up if he gave up on life. The sun rising over the horizon, the sound of children playing, the taste of cherries – the small wonders are what make life worth living.\n\nThe fate of our protagonist is intentionally vague. Kiarostami’s penchant for viewer participation is never more apparent than here. He invites us to finish the story, and what we as an audience bring to the table will provide Badii’s story with a proper conclusion. And, lest we forget that we’re just watching a movie, Kiarostami brilliantly reminds us in the film’s subversive final moments that still have fans scratching their heads to this day.\n\n17) Stalker (Dir. Andrei Tarkovsky, Soviet Union, 1979)\n\n“A man writes because he’s tormented, because he doubts.”\n\nThe films of Andrei Tarkovsky – pioneer of slow, contemplative cinema – are challenging to say the least. Though the director often worked in established genres – war films (Ivan’s Childhood), historical epics (Andrei Rublev), science fiction (Solaris), apocalyptic tragedy (The Sacrifice) – he merely utilized these well-trodden tropes to explore matters of self, the universe, and beyond. Inspired by the likes of Carl Theodor Dreyer and Ingmar Bergman who never shied away from honestly engaging Christian faith, Tarkovsky also crafted some of cinema’s most profoundly philosophical and religious films. His greatest film, Stalker, finds the filmmaker dipping into the deepest recesses of that spiritual well.\n\nAs with his masterpiece Solaris, Tarkovsky again offers his own take on sci-fi with Stalker as an eccentric guide leads a jaded writer and a solemn professor into the realm of the Zone – a restricted area that conceals the untold mysteries of the alien force that created it. Of course, these fictitious elements matter very little to the cinematic philosophizer who makes brilliant use of his long-take aesthetic and the heady discourse exchanged between his man of faith, man of science, and man of the arts to force his audience into deep contemplation.\n\nFaith – in God, in science, in artistic pursuit – plays an integral role in the journey of these three men. Each of them enters the Zone in desperate need of answers, but each of them also crucially fears what he might find. Stalker, then, is not only a fascinating entry in the expansive canon of cinematic sci-fi, but also one of the most thought-provoking films ever produced. Its narrative wanders, its existential quandaries are bookended by ellipses, and its ending is, to some, frustratingly irresolute, but more than most of the other films on this list it sticks with its viewers for days, if not weeks, after it ends.\n\n16) Ordet (Dir. Carl Theodor Dreyer, Denmark, 1955)\n\n“Is it crazy to wish to rescue life?”\n\nHeavily influenced by his strict Christian upbringing, Carl Th. Dreyer’s entire oeuvre grapples with matters of faith and tradition in one way or another. But, none can contend with the religious complexity of his masterpiece Ordet. Skewering Christianity is easy and frankly uninspired in film today, but Dreyer opts for something different here. He gives nearly every side – clergy, science, fundamentalism, agnosticism – a voice as each must reckon with a tragedy that hits close to home.\n\nThese disparate viewpoints realistically inhabit the very lifelike world Dreyer creates both in the rich complexity of his characterizations and the unparalleled masterful staging he utilizes to populate his frame. If Dreyer revolutionized the use of the close-up in his earlier work The Passion of Joan of Arc, then Ordet finds him conquering the medium wide shot. The film, then, inevitably bears a theatrical quality as Dreyer maximizes his actors’ performances for heavy emotional impact. And yet, Dreyer’s work is unmistakably cinematic. His use of stark lighting and shadows is staggering, effectively haunting. Even when his characters escape the home where the majority of the film’s narrative transpires into the open air, the weight of his material still manages to suffocate.\n\nFor though there are enough dramatic cues and genuine pathos to engage his audience, Ordet is also deeply contemplative and metaphorical. Dreyer foregrounds dichotomies that divide humankind: science and faith, rich and poor, progressivism and tradition. And yet, strip away these classist, religious, and academic divisions and everyone must face the reality of life and death. It is in this final polarity that Dreyer discovers what it truly means to be human – we all must meet death one day, but as long as there is life, we should try to live it.\n\n15) Seven Samurai (Dir. Akira Kurosawa, Japan, 1954)\n\n“Again we are defeated.”\n\nThough others tried their hand at it before and since, there is only one director so closely associated with the samurai film: Akira Kurosawa. And, though his contributions to the Japanese sub-genre were many – Rashômon, Throne of Blood, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, and Ran to name a few of the most celebrated – he’s best known (and rightly so) for one of his earliest: Seven Samurai. An epic in every sense of the word, Kurosawa’s film remains the legendary director’s greatest achievement precisely because it features everything he did best: elaborate sets and costumes, expertly choreographed battle sequences, caricature-like yet rich characterizations, a fine balance of romanticism surrounding samurai and accurately portraying the despair of feudalism, and a tinge of late-film cynicism regarding humanity.\n\nFurthermore, it’s difficult to even imagine the last fifty years or so of cinema without it. Seven Samurai, with its narrative comprised of hero recruitment and a central goal to unify them, has remained wildly influential shaping pockets of cinema as disparate as the American western and Pixar. It’s brilliant mix of thrills and philosophy make it one entertaining ride full of raw human emotion, humor, excitement, and even tragedy. It also stands as one of the few films nearing the four-hour mark that never bores or falters even for a minute.\n\nKurosawa famously collaborated with two Japanese greats during his career – Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune – and with Seven Samurai he brings them together to deliver career-high performances as the polar opposite leaders of the ragtag band of samurai enlisted to protect a small and ultimately ungrateful village. The film may end on a note of sadness, but everything that comes before ensures that Kurosawa’s greatest film won’t disappoint.\n\n14) Playtime (Dir. Jacques Tati, France, 1967)\n\n“Keep up!”\n\nCertainly one of the most ambitious films of all time, Jacques Tati’s Playtime is unquestionably a feat of filmmaking to be admired. Tati famously refused to compromise his vision for his fourth feature film, thus he shot on 70mm and constructed the enormous sets seen in the film – structures so large, the lot garnered the nickname Tativille. So, what could possibly be on the director’s mind for another amusing outing for his character Monsieur Hulot that nearly bankrupted his financiers?\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Playtime is a comedy – not perhaps in the way we typically think, but rather in the spirit of silent films that relied upon visual comedy. Furthermore, Tati never resorts to slapstick or vulgar jokes for a laugh, but instead opts for subtle sight gags to satirize our rapidly modernizing world. M. Hulot is on a mission, though during the course of the film we never learn as to why. But, no matter, for his presence is merely an excuse to plop him in the midst of this chaotic and complicated age. Hulot visits an office building, an expo, an apartment complex, and a brand new restaurant, and slowly Tati reveals the utter insanity of his day’s hurried and cluttered way of life.\n\nModernity, however, is skewered only gently; there’s no resistance to technological advancement here. Instead, it seems Tati hopes we might laugh right along with him at the ensuing confusion as a shoddily constructed upscale restaurant falls to pieces as patrons arrive, or as urban residents gawk at their TV screens where their gaze has been permanently fixed, or, in the film’s final sequence, as a tour bus full of American tourists enters a traffic circle resembling a carousel and spins into a whirl of societal conformity. The film’s called Playtime after all, and Tati seems to make the best of our increasingly bizarre and overly complicated world. In the early years of a social media saturated twenty-first century, Tati’s work seems more pertinent than ever.\n\n13) Vertigo (Dir. Alfred Hitchcock, United States, 1958)\n\n“If I let you change me…will you love me?”\n\nAlfred Hitchcock’s seminal Vertigo is a stunner if there ever was one. It’s a film that demands to be seen to be believed, for on paper several aspects might raise a few eyebrows. Jimmy Stewart as a demented, obsessive lover? A Hitchcock film without any of the dry humor that propelled Rear Window to success? A murder mystery that gives away its startling reveal half way through the film? Any one of these features may leave viewers wondering how Vertigo has become the master’s most highly regarded work.\n\nAnd yet, without a doubt, Vertigo remains an unparalleled triumph in Hitchcock’s untouchable career. Utilizing a fairly simple narrative revolving around a rather convoluted murder plot, the director lathers on layers of psychological depth as Stewart’s retired police officer Scottie becomes unhinged after the death of the object of his desire Madeleine. Matters grow complicated when Judy, resembling his former love, walks into his life, and Hitchcock explores the notions of dualities and dangerous obsession.\n\nIt’s difficult to articulate what one thing makes Vertigo tick, for it’s ultimately a sum of its extraordinary pieces – a tightly wound thriller with a killer twist, a deeply unsettling and effective performance from Stewart, Bernard Herrmann’s perfectly eerie score, a lush Technicolor palette, and the sustained dread that we as the audience have no idea where Hitchcock is taking us as the film spirals deeper and deeper into its protagonist’s troubled psyche. Ultimately, Vertigo is a rather grim affair, but Hitchcock masterfully turns this material into utterly gripping stuff – easily one of the most thoroughly accomplished films of all time.\n\n12) Citizen Kane (Dir. Orson Welles, United States, 1941)\n\n“If I hadn’t been rich, I might have been a really great man.”\n\nGreatest film of all time? Who can really say with something so subjective? But, there’s a good reason Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane repeatedly appears at the top. Innovative in its technical aspects and its non-linear narrative, Kane set the stage for decades of experiments in cinema to come. Moreover, during his career Welles was a force to be reckoned with. Though his later films such as The Magnificent Ambersons and The Lady from Shanghai were plagued by studio interference and unfortunate edits, he was the sole driver behind the wheel of his debut. In addition to directing, writing, and acting in Kane, the studio granted him an unprecedented amount of control over the final cut. Thus, the film may have unintentionally triggered the notion of director as true auteur for Welles’ unmistakable touch is all over this masterpiece.\n\nRevisionist history has tried to downplay the influence of Kane, just as some cranky audiophiles attempt to disrepute The Beatles today, but I don’t believe cinematic history will allow it. Its technical achievements are still hard to miss – low-angle cinematography, impressive use of lighting and shadow, the extensive use of deep focus camerawork. These hallmarks of the classic, along with the bold narrative structure, are in full use in Hollywood to this day. To say Kane is influential is simply an understatement.\n\nAnd yet, perhaps what remains more often unsaid is what makes Welles’ film such an enduring work of art – the enigma that is Charles Foster Kane himself. Welles wrote one of film’s very best characters in this complex newspaper tycoon who’s barely understood by his closest friends and family, and who’s none the more explained by film’s end. This characterization is Welles’ greatest trick and one that makes Citizen Kane a film worth watching again and again and again.\n\n11) A Brighter Summer Day (Dir. Edward Yang, Taiwan, 1991)\n\n“Is life really that hard?”\n\nSet only a few years after the events of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s City of Sadness, Edward Yang’s A Brighter Summer Day plays like a spiritual sequel to that film, documenting another significant time period for the nation of Taiwan. Newcomers from mainland China and native Taiwanese continued to struggle toward a peaceful coexistence after the Japanese handover in 1945 well into the Sixties. Yang’s film, then, lends a voice not primarily to the men and women on either side of the divide, but rather to these people’s children. The youth at the center of the film – born during the time of this monumental political and cultural shift – are growing up without any sense of a unified identity. Thus, many of them turn to gangs to find their worth and appropriate Western pop culture to fill the void where there is none.\n\nYang’s film is an epic in scale – nearly four hours with hundreds of speaking roles – and yet it never overwhelms or appears overly ambitious. For like City of Sadness, Yang chooses to focus on how these national changes affect a few. At the center is the young Xiao Si’r (played impeccably by newcomer and future star Chang Chen) along with his family and friends as he wrestles with establishing his own identity and leaving a mark as gang leaders die off and become martyrs for their causes.\n\nAt once a poignant depiction of youth and a heartbreaking account of Taiwan’s tumultuous history, Yang’s hefty Summer Day shines brightly despite its dreary tone and aesthetic. Some may find Yang’s signature long takes and literary narrative a bit laborious, but the film more than earns every minute of its lengthy runtime featuring some of the finest child performances put to film and one of the most sincere portraits of the loss of innocence with an ending that packs a heavy emotional punch.\n\n<< 50-41 40-31 30-21 10-1 >>\n\n(Dir. Andrei Tarkovsky, Soviet Union, 1979)\n\nTesting the Supernatural\n\nWith a canon made up of a mere seven feature films released over the course of three decades, Andrei Tarkovsky has incredibly built the most unshakable reputation based on the fewest number of works of any director in cinema, with perhaps the exception of Carl Theodor Dreyer (who, fittingly, is one of Tarkovsky’s greatest influences). His significance in the medium was likely solidified with his fourth film, the semi-autobiographical Mirror, a film that both reflected the personal struggles of an artist and the all-encompassing travails of a nation’s recent turbulent history. And, while that film is typically regarded as his opus, it is his fifth film – the satisfyingly opaque and unquestionably accomplished Stalker – that is arguably his greatest. It is surely the culmination of his efforts up to that point. It boasts the poetic flourishes of his debut Ivan’s Childhood, the scope of his historical epic Andrei Rublev, the glacial, contemplative pacing of his other sci-fi classic Solaris redefining the genre for an audience hooked on cheap thrills, and the impenetrable metaphorical draw of Mirror that invites innumerable repeat viewings.\n\nAnd yet, Stalker is, of course, more than just the sum of these parts. While Tarkovsky certainly welcomed the idea of an authorial voice assigned to the director of any given film (a notion in full swing in the post-Novelle vague world in which he worked), Stalker represents not simply another chapter in a string of films forming some narrative arc, but rather the fullest exploration of metaphysical thought in his entire oeuvre. Like Solaris before it, the story that sets Tarkovsky’s film in motion is remarkably simple. Somewhere in Russia an extraterrestrial force has taken over a once populated region of the countryside and left the area – dubbed the Zone – mysteriously uninhabitable for humans, and those who enter are never heard from again.\n\nThe government has understandably sealed the area off with armed soldiers, barbed wire fences, and guarded entry points, but there remain those who still wish to venture inside. Thus, Tarkovsky introduces us to a guide, known as a stalker (a possibly mistranslated term that has nevertheless stuck with the film in the West), who has braved the dangerous unknown of the Zone, believes in the mystical powers of its presence, and smuggles in those willing to pay. The unnamed stalker at the center of this film (Alexander Kaidanovsky) agrees to accompany a desperate writer in need of inspiration (Anatoli Solonitsyn) and a quiet professor with hidden motives (Nikolai Grinko) into the Zone as they risk their lives on a quest through the unknown.\n\nWith a thirst for knowledge, a man of faith, a man of the arts, and a man of science each enter the Zone to either prove or disprove what he already believes. As more is revealed about this modern wasteland (which Tarkovsky brilliantly shoots in color as opposed to the sepia toned introduction and epilogue that take place outside the Zone), we learn that there is an equally unexplainable phenomenon that allegedly occurs in a location known as the Room. Inside, some believe the living, breathing space grants individuals their wishes. On the surface, then, it appears quite obvious why these three men might journey into the depths of this restricted area, following seemingly overcautious rules set out by the stalker that dictate their every carefully placed step. The promise of this wish fulfillment dangles in front of them, just out of reach, as the stalker leads the pair in a circular pattern and through a series of obstacles as they slowly approach the Room rather than head straight for it. Their guide insists the Zone must be respected; they are not allowed to simply do as they please, nor apparently what seems most logical.\n\nThis section of the film unfolds in this way as the trio circles the ruins that supposedly host the sacred-like Room. The stalker’s blind faith in the Zone and its unexplained intricacies keeps the other two on their toes as he insists on new rules to follow. At first, the professor follows quietly while the writer cynically objects. But, as their time within drags on, both professor and writer find themselves at odds with the stalker’s zeal for the Zone when his promise of the supernatural lurking behind every corner appears inconsistent with reality. Sure, an eerie atmosphere lingers throughout the lush ruins of the Zone, but aside from one major physics-defying misstep that the stalker labels a “trap,” the supernatural evades them.\n\nAs the three draw nearer to the Room, their motivations and desires become clearer. The writer, who has become disillusioned with both humanity and his craft, doubts the power of the Room, yet fears it. The professor, who at first appears to enter the Zone for scientific study, reveals that he wishes to destroy it for fear that someone with evil or destructive desires should enter some day. The stalker, too, with his own secrets reveals that he himself has never been inside. At the threshold of Room, then, in Stalker’s defining moment, the three choose not to enter. All three – the stalker included – begin to doubt any good could come from entering. What if the Room only grants its visitors’ deepest, subconscious desires rather than requests? What if entering the Room leaves them with no greater understanding, no further inspiration? What if nothing happens at all? These doubts, these unsettling questions, keep this trio from fulfilling their most dangerous of missions and threaten to leave Tarkovsky’s viewers unsatisfied.\n\nFollowing this defeat, he takes us outside the Zone where the writer and professor go their separate ways and the stalker returns to his wife (Alisa Freindlich) and child (Natasha Abramova). Crushing disappointment has left the man literally lying on the floor of his home, numb to the comforts of his concerned wife. The pair he led into his personal holy of holies ultimately leaves unaffected or, at least, unappreciative in his eyes. But, his own unwillingness to enter the Room exposes his own doubt with regards to its supposed power. Early on in the film the stalker journeys to the Zone to escape his ordinary life claiming, “everywhere is a prison to me” to his wife who’s opposed to his upcoming trip. Yet, now his devastation may be less related to again being forced to leave the Zone than leaving unfulfilled.\n\nWhat, then, is the Zone? Tarkovsky, typically, offers no clearly defined answers. It’s an area where occasionally some unexplained incidents do occur, but in the end it proves to be mostly devoid of the supernatural. Interestingly, however, Tarkovsky chooses to shoot these scenes in color, perhaps painting the Zone how the infatuated stalker perceives it, or possibly hinting at something more than what we – and those who venture inside over the course of the film – see. As mentioned previously, Tarkovsky switches back to stark sepia toned palette for the film’s epilogue. Yet, there are two notable exceptions in color, both featuring the stalker’s unnamed daughter. The only information the audience receives with regards to this minor character is through dialogue between the writer and professor, one of which reveals the girl suffers from some physical ailment as a result the Zone.\n\nIn the film’s understandably much-discussed final scene, Tarkovsky’s camera rests on this young girl sitting at the kitchen table. Before long she rests her head upon the surface and begins moving cups and glasses across the table with her mind. It’s the first true moment of the supernatural caught on camera in a film full of doubts (not unlike the jaw-dropping miracle at film’s end in Dreyer’s classic Ordet). The film’s final scene could be interpreted as Tarkovsky acknowledging that though we may be disappointed in the Zone as well, there could still be hope for the existence of the supernatural after all. Here, in the stalker’s home outside the Zone the spiritual intersects with the physical. Of course, the three men who enter the Zone searching for answers miss it. While they are busy testing the supernatural, venturing deep within the unknown, all three fail to see what they’ve been hoping to find just outside the parameters of their search.\n\nIt’s impossible to know if Tarkovsky intends to confirm some specific Christian, or otherwise, belief system, but the film’s finale does seem to suggest that faith – in art, in science, in religion – is important, yet may not always yield the answers we’re looking for. The same is true for the cinema of Andrei Tarkovsky. It’s part of what makes it so difficult to write about his work. There is certainly deep meaning there; it’s nearly impossible to finish one of his films unmoved, but he leaves the burden of interpreting his work to his audience. It makes him one of the most satisfyingly challenging filmmakers in the history of the medium, and Stalker the most rewarding feature he ever directed.\n\n(Dir. Andrei Tarkovsky, Soviet Union, 1972)\n\nBack to Earth\n\nThe conception of Andrei Tarkovsky’s Solaris – now widely regarded as one of cinema’s finest science fiction films – sprang from a reaction. If the enigmatic Russian auteur’s somewhat supercilious assertion that Western sci-fi lacked any real depth – a complaint unbelievably leveled against Kubrick’s seminal 2001: A Space Odyssey, a film which Tarkovsky’s work is forever destined for comparison – resulted in Solaris, it’s nearly impossible to disagree with him. And, even though the metaphysical heft of Solaris is merely a prelude to the director’s later masterpiece, the sobering Stalker, it remains one of the most humane, thought-provoking explorations of the human psyche in all of cinema.\n\nLike 2001, Tarkovsky takes his time rocketing us into space. His film opens on earth as psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) prepares to visit a far-off space station orbiting a planet named Solaris after ground control has received some unusual communications from the crew. His mission, we learn, is to assess whether or not to pull the plug on ongoing explorations of the planet’s vast ocean. Tarkovsky introduces Kelvin as a somber, serious man with as-yet-unknown personal baggage and a skepticism surrounding the tales he’s told about strange occurrences on Solaris. These early scenes are dialogue-heavy as Tarkovsky builds suspense around the mystery above and scenery-heavy as his camera gently rests on the natural landscape of Kelvin’s father’s country home, allowing his central character to bask in this planet’s beauty before he tears him (and us) from it for the remainder of the film.\n\nOnce aboard the space station, Kelvin realizes rather quickly that things have gone awry as he learns of one colleague’s unlikely suicide and the frightening aloofness of the remaining two crewmembers. Before long he’s forced to believe the absurdity of the claims of supernatural phenomena on Solaris when his late ex-wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk) appears by his bedside one morning. This is no mere apparition; Hari has a physical presence with a full memory of her ex-husband and a range of human emotions. The revelation is disturbing as Kelvin is both confronted with this unexplained appearance as well as painful memories from his past. Here Tarkovsky parks his narrative as Kelvin unconsciously grows to love this version of his former lover who he knows full well isn’t who his eyes believe her to be. Conflict between the three scientists arises when Kelvin begins defending his relationship with this human-like being while one of his colleagues wishes to conduct studies on her.\n\nFortunately, Tarkovsky doesn’t leave his audience completely in the dark. Of course, there’s very little real science behind this premise, but the explanation for these occurrences – that Hari and others are physical manifestations of the crew’s memory and thoughts projected from the depths of the planet’s living, thinking ocean – provides the backbone for Tarkovsky’s thematic exploration. Strip away the space station and the phony science and at its core Solaris concerns one man’s reckoning with the grief that plagues him as he’s literally confronted with the memories – both good and bad – of someone he once dearly loved. The replica of Hari as a stand-in for his memories of her forces him to face his past. The intimacy the pair shares aboard the station initially clouds the reality of their parting ten years prior when Kelvin left her and she subsequently committed suicide in his absence. Tarkovsky brilliantly exposes our human desire to revel in the good memories of our past, even if it means subconsciously or consciously manipulating aspects of those memories so that we may enjoy them more fully (a notion Tarkovsky explores further in Solaris’ follow-up The Mirror where that film’s central character recalls memories of his mother as his ex-wife, visualized by the same actress cleverly playing both roles).\n\nAnd yet, to strip away the deep space odyssey of Solaris’ outer layer would be to diminish all that Tarkovsky uncovers in this sci-fi masterstroke. For not only does he find his characters haunted by people from their pasts, but the lonely crew of the station also experiences a nostalgia and longing for a place. The thrill of discovery that this long-gestating project promises as humankind explores the depths of outer space still can never fill the void left by leaving home. In an early scene aboard the station, Kelvin’s colleague Dr. Snaut (Jüri Järvet) ties strips of paper to an air vent in his room claiming that the sound resembles that of ruffling leaves. He even asserts that his seemingly unfeeling counterpart Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) utilizes this simple reminder of home in his own quarters as well. Furthermore, the cold, stark lifelessness of the manufactured space station contrasts with the warmth and beauty of earth Tarkovsky captures in the sustained opening shots of the film prior to Kelvin’s departure. The absence of earth is palpable.\n\nIf Kubrick’s 2001 exposed the myth of human progress as the failure of deep space voyages resulted in disaster, then Tarkovsky’s Solaris takes this notion one step further: the farther humankind gets away from its home, the less human we become. There’s a reason Tarkovsky ends his film with Kelvin’s dramatic return to earth as he embraces his father (Nikolai Grinko), kneeling before him on the steps of his home. It is only when he is home – facing the very memory of all that word holds – that he is once again happy. Yet, as this is a Tarkovsky feature, the film’s final shot leaves his audience with a satisfyingly ambiguous finale urging us to question all that we’ve seen. The cinema of Andrei Tarkovsky is never easy, always challenging, and rewards multiple viewings if one has the time and patience to dive into his world of eternal questioning."
