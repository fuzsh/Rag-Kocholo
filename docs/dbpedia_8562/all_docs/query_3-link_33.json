        "text": "Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky was a Russian filmmaker, writer, film editor, film theorist, theatre and opera director. His work is characterized by long takes, unconventional dramatic structure, distinctly authored use of cinematography, and spiritual and metaphysical themes. Director Ingmar Bergman said of him: Tarkovsky for me is the greatest, the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream."
