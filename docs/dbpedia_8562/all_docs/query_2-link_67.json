        "text": "Although long recognized in the Soviet Union and later Russia as a great poet continuing in the tradition of Osip Mandelstam, Arseny Tarkovsky — father to renowned film director Andrei — has been little known to Western readers, and almost entirely unknown in English. The close friend to early 20th century Soviet greats such as Marina Tsvetaeva (who sought out a romantic relationship with Tarkovsky before committing suicide), Anna Akhmatova, and numerous others, few Americans might have imagined that Tarkovsky, as Akhmatova described him, was perceived by many as the one “real poet” in the Soviet Union:\n\n[…]of all contemporary poets Tarkovsky alone is completely\n\nhis own self, completely independent. He possesses the most\n\nimportant feature of a poet, which I’d call the birthright.\n\nThere are numerous reasons for the oversight. Although recognized as a war hero for his actions in World War II as a correspondent for the Soviet Army publication Battle Alarm, during which time he was seriously wounded, his leg eventually sacrificed to gangrene, Tarkovsky came of age after Central Committee secretary Andrei Zhdanov’s ideological attack on the works of Akhmatova and Mikhail Zoshchenko, and, accordingly, Tarkovsky’s own 1946 book, although accepted for publication, was withdrawn. It was not until 1962 that the poet was able to publish his first volume, Before the Snow, when he was 55 years of age. Although his work did gain some fame in the West through his son’s films Mirror (1974) and Stalker (1979), which included quotations from a few of his poems, his writing is nearly impossible to convey into English, based as it is on the long Russian traditions of end rhyme and meter. Tarkovsky died in 1989, just prior to the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nFinally, in Philip Metres and Dimitri Psurtsev’s I Burned at the Feast: Selected Poems of Arseny Tarkovsky we get a fair idea of what Tarkovsky’s work might sound like in Russian. If the poetry that results sometimes seems to lack the excitement of other major Russian poets of the day, the translators are certainly to be commended for their brave attempts to render a completely “other” poetic tradition into a language that makes sense to the American ear.\n\nIndeed, one of the most important aspects of this book is just how much it reveals the difficulties any translator faces. The afterword by Philip Metres, presented as 25 Propositions about the process of translating, is worth the price of the book.\n\nRather than presenting these concerns as an academic exercise, Metres, often with humor and always with intelligence, outlines some of the basic impossibilities of translating an “authentic” poetry. The fact that Tarkovsky was a noted translator of numerous languages into Russian who well knew of the translator’s difficulties may have provided Metres and Psurtsev a tacit feeling of support. Metres quotes from Tarkovsky’s poem “Translator”\n\nFor what did I spend\n\nMy best years on foreign words?\n\nO, Eastern translations,\n\nHow you hurt my head.\n\n“Of course,” notes Metres, Tarknovsky “wrote nothing of the kind. He wrote…”—a passage in Cyrillic follows. “Or,” continues the translator, “as an email once encoded it”:\n\n?????????????????????????????\n\n?????????????????????????????\n\n?????????????????????????????\n\n?????????????????????????????\n\nBesides the poet’s deep reliance on Russian root words and other tropes from Romance languages dating back to Pushkin, Metres notes just a few of what he describes as “Russian poetry’s acute and irreducible particularities, the most acute and irreducible its relationship to meter”:\n\nThe regularity of Russian conjugations and declensions, the\n\nflexibility of word order in sentence meaning, and the multi-\n\nsyllabic nature of Russian words all combine to create a seem-\n\ningly endless wellspring of rhymes and metrical possibilities.\n\nIn contrast to the poetries of the West, which inhaled modernism’s\n\nbreath of free verse and only rarely return to the formal rooms of\n\nstrict meters, Russian poetry has, until only very recently, been\n\nalmost entirely faithful to its high organized and lush meters. In\n\nTarkovsky’s poetry alone, one can find poems not only in iambic,\n\nbut also in trochaic, dactylic, anapestic, amphibrachic, not to\n\nmention folksong prosodic patterns, unrhymed metrical poems, and,\n\nyes, even free verse. It’s as if, in the United States, our poetry,\n\nmetrically speaking, plays its tune within the limits of the pop form,\n\nwhile in Russian, whole symphonies continue to be produced.\n\nTo recognize these and the many other impediments to an easy assimilation of Tarkovsky’s work in English, is not to suggest that the translators do not, time and again, find a way to convey the grandeur and beauty of this Russian poet. Many of these poems begin within the confines of a simple metaphor that quickly spirals out into another time and world. The image of a “table set for six,” for example, in the wartime poem beginning with that image, soon moves into a somewhat frightful nostalgic scene:\n\nLike twelve years ago, her hand,\n\nstill cold to the touch.\n\nHer silks, blue and old-fashioned,\n\nStill rustle and swish.\n\nBy the next stanza the poet takes the simple dinner-time activities of “wine singing” and “crystal ringing” into a dark, haunted song of the past:\n\nHow much we loved you,\n\nHow many winters ago.\n\nEnding the poem in what might at first seem like a snapshot memory of prior events, it is transformed through the presence of a vague female voice (whom, we discover in the footnotes is the now-deceased poet Marina Tsvetaeva) speaking out from the dead:\n\nMy father would smile at me,\n\nmy brother, pour some wine,\n\nHer ringless hand in mine,\n\nthe woman would say:\n\nMy heels are caked with dirt,\n\nmy plaited hair’s gone clear,\n\nand our voices now call out\n\nfrom under the earth.\n\nIndeed, given the fact that Tarkovsky wrote many of these poems during War II, death haunts a number of his earliest works. The inevitability of death is most evident in a poem like “[A German machinegunner will shoot me in the road, or]”:\n\nA German machinegunner will shoot me in the road, or\n\na detonation bomb will break my legs, or\n\nan SS-boy will slam a bullet in my gut—\n\nin any case, on this front, they’ve got me covered.\n\nWithout my name, or glory, or even boots—\n\nwith frozen eyes, I’ll gaze at the snow, blood-colored.\n\nThe poem is made even more sardonic by the translator’s explanation that during the early days of World War II, when Russian “valenki” boots were in short supply, dead soldiers were often stripped of their footwear, one story telling of hundreds of frozen legs that were sawed off by Russian troops so that they might remove the boots which had frozen to the dead men’s feet.\n\nAnd even in such later poems as the multi-part elegy to Anna Akhmatova, from 1967, Tarkovsky writes about death in a manner that expresses deep grief while yet accepting its inevitability. That poem ends in painful tolling out of the words “all night,” reiterating the endlessness of death when faced by the living:\n\nAll night we promised\n\nyou immortality, all night\n\nwe longed for you\n\nto take us from the house of grief—\n\nall night, all night, all night,\n\nas it was in the beginning.\n\nGiven the suffering Tarkovsky endured during his lifetime, it is rather amazing that, despite these dark expressions of grief, so many of his poems look to nature for regeneration and new possibility. Sometimes that rebirth, as in section IV of his poem “After the War,” represents the violence between the forces of life and death the poet has personally experienced:\n\nLike a tree splashing the earth\n\nabove itself, having collapsed from a steep\n\nundermined by water, roots in the air,\n\nthe rapids plucking its branches—\n\nso my double on the other rapids\n\ntravels from future to past.\n\nFrom another height, I trail myself\n\nwith my eyes, clutch my chest. Who gave me\n\ntrembling branches, a sturdy trunk\n\nyet weak, helpless roots?\n\nDeath is vile, but life is worse,\n\nand there’s no binding its tyranny.\n\nAre you leaving, Lazarus? Well, go away!\n\nNothing holds us together. Sleep,\n\nVivacious one, fold your hands\n\non your chest and sleep.\n\nBut, more often, the horrors of his life are transformed into scenes of renewal and beauty through the natural world. One need only read his remarkable “Field Hospital,” which recounts Tarkovsky’s leg injury of 1944. About to have his leg amputated, the poet begins the poem with an out-of-body vision of himself, one might say “etherized upon a table”:\n\nThe table was turned to light. I lay\n\nmy head down like meat on a scale,\n\nmy soul throbbing on a thread.\n\nI could see myself from above:\n\nI would have been balanced\n\nby a stout market weight.\n\nSoon after, as his leg is cut away, time seems to stop:\n\nOn that day,\n\nthe clock stopped, souls of trains\n\nno longer flew along lampless levies,\n\nupon the gray fins of stream;\n\nneither crow weddings nor snowstorms\n\nnor thaws penetrated this limbo\n\nwhere I lay in disgrace, naked,\n\nin my own blood, outside the future’s\n\nmagnetic pull.\n\nYet the poem continues with an almost miraculous “coming-to” (predicted in the repetition of “and also”) as the poet calls from his inner self the language of an almost biblical past, bringing him back to life and to a vision, once again, of the beauty of the natural world:\n\nMy lips were covered with sores, and also\n\nI was fed by a spoon, and also\n\nI could not remember my name,\n\nbut the language of King David came\n\nalive on my tongue.\n\nAnd then\n\neven the snow disappeared,\n\nand early spring, rising on tiptoes,\n\ndraped her green scarf over the trees.\n\nEven at the front in 1942, Tarkovsky, through the glory of nature and his memory of the past, was able in the unforgettable poem “Beautiful Day” (which in Russian means “White Day”) to recover an almost radiant joy. The poem is among those quoted in Andrei Tarkovsky’s Mirror:\n\nBeneath the jasmine a stone\n\nmarks a buried treasure.\n\nOn the path, my father stands.\n\nA beautiful, beautiful day.\n\nThe gray poplar blooms,\n\ncentifola blooms,\n\nand milky grass,\n\nand behind it, roses climb.\n\nI have never been\n\nmore happy than then.\n\nI have never been more\n\nhappy than then.\n\nTo return is impossible\n\nand to talk about it, forbidden—\n\nhow it was filled with bliss,\n\nthat heavenly garden.\n\nI don’t know how that poem works in Russian, but in English the third stanza, with its simple statements of joy, each altered with their enjambments and attenuations, express some feelings about the world which remain unspoken if read merely as one long sentence. The narrator begins with an incomplete phrase that suggests a sense of his non-existence (“I have never been”) before continuing on in the second line with his expression of joy. The third line extends that feeling, “I have never been more,” suggesting that happiness is just a portion of the fullness of his feeling, before the stanza continues with the (now limited) happiness that closes stanza.\n\nAccordingly, even in expressing his great joy, he seems already aware, as it puts it in the last stanza, that such joy is somehow beyond himself, is something to which he can never return. The happiness comes from somewhere outside of his being, and, once experienced, beyond even his memory of it. It is, in fact, a “white” world, a void that is at once pure and cleansing, yet nonetheless a forbidden territory to the surviving adult.\n\nTarkovsky’s world, we quickly realize, is not simply fragile, but lost, a postlapsarian universe, a place perhaps haunted by an Edenic past, yet permeated with the smell of death, the burning of flesh. As he puts it in “My sight, which was my power, now blurs”:\n\nI am a candle. I burned at the feast.\n\nGather my wax when morning arrives\n\nso that this page will remind you\n\nhow to be proud and how to weep,\n\nhow to give away the last third\n\nof happiness, and how to die with ease—\n\nand beneath a temporary roof\n\nto burn posthumously, like a word.\n\nI Burned at the Feast: Selected Poems of Arseny Tarkovsky (2015) is published by Cleveland University Poetry Center and is available from Amazon and other online booksellers."
