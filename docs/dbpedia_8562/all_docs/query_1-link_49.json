        "text": "Before Stanley Kubrick, Béla Tarr, and the like, there was Andrei Tarkovsky: the master of slow cinema. Believe me when I tell you that the Russian master has a filmography that gets as close to perfection as any possibly can. In fact, all of his official feature narrative films (seven of them in total) made my best-of lists: a feat that almost no other filmmaker has achieved. To say he is one of my favourite directors of all time is an understatement because I think — even to this day — no one has the same eye as Tarkovsky ever did. A perfectionist with his body of work, you can sense spiritual elation, societal dread, existential ambiguity, and abstract beauty in all of his major works. You simply cannot go wrong with blindly watching any of Tarkovsky’s feature-length films.\n\nDon’t believe me? Solaris remains one of the greatest blind buys I’ve ever made. A local HMV — the very one that I spent hours at weekly as a youth — was closing nearly two decades ago, and everything was discounted. I had just discovered what the Criterion Collection was (my first official purchase, Charade, was made a week or two earlier) and I knew what special treats now came with these releases. I was transfixed by their box art for one Solaris (credit goes to Criterion on this front) and picked it up for less than twenty dollars (!). At home that evening, I had no clue what I had just watched regarding the conventions of science fiction, but sixteen-year-old me was blown away. There was a four-minute-long shot of highway driving that suddenly smashes into a jumpcut that sends us into space, a curtain blocking a majority of the mysteriousness of the film until Tarkovsky wants to bowl us over (bit by bit), and that zero-gravity sequence that will forever nestle rent-free in my mind for the rest of my life. I was an instant convert.\n\nThe greatest discovery is that I couldn’t really detail why I loved Solaris so much. I just knew that I had never seen anything like it. You’ll find below that Solaris isn’t even the highest-ranked film on this list (considering how short the list is, it actually isn’t even really that close to being number one), which is not a slight on a sci-fi masterwork but rather an indication of how highly I think of Tarkovsky’s films overall. After many years of viewing these films, facing life and growing up, and having my own psychological, spiritual, and biological battles, dilemmas, and discoveries, I perhaps understand Tarkovsky’s quest to identify the unidentifiable. Then again, maybe I only think that I do. I’ve likely ascertained my own identity in these films, but I think that’s what Tarkovsky wanted the most. He can take us to other realities, realms, countries, or mindsets, but the ending point that he always had in his films was to arrive at a new version of ourselves. Sometimes, this is the only comfort available when his films get as challenging as they can (and, believe me, he did make one of the most cryptic films ever created).\n\nIn order to understand fulfilment, one has to know struggle. With this in mind, I’d love to limit this list just to the well-known, narrative motion pictures Tarkovsky released so his career can look free of blemishes, but this isn’t accurate nor is it sincere. Instead, I will be including Tarkovsky’s student films (most of which don’t come anywhere near the heights of his prime, but you’ll likely find that they are fairly strong for being student films, especially the one exception that does compare with his full-length releases). Furthermore, because it’s just one extra film and so it can’t hurt, I’m tossing in Voyage of Time, which was co-directed by screenwriter Tonino Guerra; for the curious, this may be the best way to tap into who Tarkovsky was as a person more explicitly than anything else can. Otherwise, I’d rather jump into the works of an absolute cinematic legend whose body of work feels untouchable by most. Here are the films of Andrei Tarkovsky ranked from worst to best.\n\n4. Solaris\n\nHow do you use the conventions of science fiction to depict grief? By experiencing complete isolation on both Earth and in space. Solaris makes us feel so alone that we will imagine what is not actually there; the film knowingly toys with our hallucinations as well. With occasional blips and instances where visual cues pop out unexpectedly, you will feel like your mind is going crazy. That’s precisely how protagonist Kris Kelvin feels as he is sent out into space to discover why a crew went mad while conducting planetary research. As our nightmares, dreams, and desires begin to come to fruition, Solaris begins to battle against us: are we really living out our wishes if we can fully accept that what we see is not real? Solaris pretends to be a sci-fi film, but it’s really a commentary on memory and thought more than anything, as daydreams converge with nostalgia. As Tarkovsky gives you very few answers to work with, he rewards you with moments of bliss; the zero-gravity sequence brings tears to my eyes every time it arrives. Sometimes, our quest to find answers only gives us more questions, and a mission like Solaris lets us know that it’s okay to be lost amidst the uncertainty; our purpose is what we give ourselves, and it’s not out there for the world — or the universe — to grant us.\n\n2. Stalker\n\nHow much control does a director need in order to make a science fiction masterpiece that barely shows anything from the genre? Stalker is fully a sci-fi epic even though much of what seemingly transpires is in our minds: fear of the unknown and what is to come. As three hopefuls trek closer and closer to a mysterious location known as the Zone (a spot that can allegedly grant any wish that one desires), we feel the anticipation and expectations weigh down on well-wishers, with the gravity of society’s destruction and philosophical qualms antagonizing our protagonists more and more. Stalker is often considered one of Tarkovsky’s greatest works because of how powerful he is with next to nothing: we even believe that there’s something to come when, for hours, there hasn’t really been much to cling onto (outside of the impeccable character structuring and the stealthy crawl of the film’s brooding pacing). We still feel every ounce of the existential damnation that drives our leads to destruction, and it’s at this moment that Tarkovsky finally grants us something magical to work with (so we aren’t lost once we leave the theatre; this is a merciful director). A major inspiration for many films, particularly Alex Garland’s Annihilation, Stalker is a masterclass in how to approach the world building, philosophies, and mindsets of science fiction even without the stars, effects, and glitz.\n\nAndrei Tarkovsky’s magnum opus just so happens to be one of the most challenging films ever made. That work is Mirror: the appropriately titled arthouse, experimental drama that forces us to find ourselves within the cryptic puzzles found within. Structured around the potential dying thoughts and dreams of a poet (inspired by the works of Tarkovsky’s father, renown writer Arseny Tarkovsky, who provides the narration here), Mirror is an avant-garde look at an artist’s perspective on life, religion, politics, and wellbeing. It is impossible to fully understand on one’s first watch, and I’d argue that it never becomes fully decipherable even on the fiftieth watch. That’s part of what makes Mirror so special, though. It is a rare film that cannot be properly, fully described by anybody from esteemed film scholars to Letterboxd cinephiles. It encourages you to create your own meaning within the spellbinding, jaw-dropping visuals. It very much is a visual poem, which feels like the goal Tarkovsky had in mind given the film’s nature and premise. Whether you love Mirror or are befuddled by it, I promise you that you leave the film a completely new person with a different perspective on art, life, faith, and yourself. There aren’t many films that leave me speechless or have my mind chasing for answers (or, sometimes, I just allow my brain to enjoy the ride and not work overtime) in the ways that Mirror does. It is unquestionably one of the greatest films I’ve ever seen, a celebration of enigmatic art, philosophy, and prose, and Andrei Tarkovsky’s best film."
