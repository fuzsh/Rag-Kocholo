        "text": "Few times I had the chance, of speaking in front of an audience like this, tonight here in Rome. That's why it's hard to know what you expect me to say to you, begins Andrei Tarkovsky at a special event in 1982 called Ladri di cinema or Thieves of Cinema. The filmmaker, in Italy during his time with Nostalghia--a timeless film we explore in Andrei Tarkovsky’s Nostalghia: Study of a Cinematic Masterpiece--shares his insights and philosophy on filmmaking and the art of cinema while offering a deeper understanding and appreciation of his work. It is captivating to see the master filmmaker present himself in person for an hour to speak about the world of films, making Donatella Baglivo’s (director of Andrei Tarkovsky in Nostalghia) portrait of Tarkovsky an essential part of his film career.\n\nThe human tendency to categorize leads to the question of influences on the artist. However, what is the true nature of influence? For Tarkovsky, influence is a connection founded in the sharing of similar ideas and approaches to filmmaking. He says:\n\nBut what is influence? It is, for example, the artist's selection of the environment in which he wants to work, the people, of collaborators with whom he wants to work, and with whom he will feel comfortable with...And then, if you ask me, if you ask me what influence I have received from names like, for example, Bresson, Antonioni, Bergman, Kurosawa, Mizoguchi...I must say none. I have no desire to imitate them. Because it would be impossible to do so, And more, if my goal was the imitation of great directors, I would be distancing myself from the true goal of cinema, since the main goal of any kind of art is to find a personal means of expression, a language with which to express what's inside of you. Therefore, the influence that these directors, that I adore, have on me, lies in the fact that I find myself in the pleasant company of movie people, people I am comfortable with.\n\nWe can learn much by exposing ourselves to the great films and directors of the past and present, and by doing so we grow our palette, deepening our understanding for cinematic storytelling.\n\nHowever, the key is to use this larger palette to more precisely create our cinematic visions or ideas (precise defined as “marked by exactness and accuracy of expression or detail”). Since, as Tarkovsky suggests, the main goal of art--a universal language--is to find a means for self-expression, a language with which to express what’s inside of you--a personal language--then a broader knowledge of filmmaking as an art and craft proves its utmost importance in the hands of a filmmaker striving to achieve an honest translation of his or her film from page to screen. That honest translation often creates singular films that are definitions within themselves; they are works of cinematic art that bring to the fore filmmakers to whom we should give our attention. Andrei Tarkovsky calls these filmmakers poets:\n\nCinema is divided mainly into two categories of artists. On the one hand, there are those that mimic and try to recreate the world in which they live. On the other hand are those who create their own world. Those who create their own world are usually poets. For instance, Bresson, Dovzhenko, Mizoguchi, Bergman, Buñuel, Kurosawa, and in general, the great names of contemporary cinema. For that reason, it is difficult to distribute their movies because they are the result of the development of their personal world, that corresponds to their ideas and their personal interests. These authors almost always go against the general taste of the spectators, but not because they do not want to be understood by the public, but because they prefer to listen and understand the needs that the audience, the public, feels. Commercial movies can not, by nature, satisfy the deepest and most intimate needs and interests of each viewer.\n\nBresson, Dovzhenko, Mizoguchi, Bergman, Buñuel, Kurosawa, and Tarkovsky himself are poets of the cinema because they follow their own filmmaker’s style. How is a filmmaker’s style best defined or expressed? As Tarkovsky once said, In the cinema a director expresses his individuality first and foremost through his sense of time, through rhythm. Rhythm gives color to a work by distinguishable stylistic characteristics. Rhythm must arise naturally in a film, a function of the director's innate sense of life and commensurate with his quest for time. The temporal dimension in cinema, which gives existence to the language of film, offers us filmmakers the opportunity to seek personal expression by how we manipulate time or the progress of existence within each shot and within the arrangement of these shots. A text on the filmmaker’s style of Andrei Tarkovsky (title of book unavailable) reads, When one views Tarkovsky’s films in order, at least up to and including Mirror, they seem like one long film, divided into “chapters.” The subjects, the stories that the filmmaker is telling, are the variable parameter of the film, while the inner world of the author remains the constant. The subject is but the peg upon which to hang a reveal of this inner world, a world that is not merely a collection of memories, but a universe furnished with laws of its own. The elements within this universe are united by what Tarkovsky himself called “rhythm.” Thus, “rhythm” is simply another title for the filmmaker’s style. Tarkovsky continues in the masterclass:\n\nI would like to speak now of the poetics of cinema, the cinematographic art...Each art, and cinema is an art (even if it's in a position of, let's say, humiliating inferiority), each art form has its own specific element. What does this mean? It means that it has a content, a subject, that does not correspond with the essence of the other art forms, other artistic activities. In practice, it is what distinguishes one art from another. Photography could be an art form. We all know Cartier-Bresson, a genius in this field. We have painting, that can not compete with photography, just like photography can not compete with painting. What is done in films can't be done in another art form. What is done in literature can not be done in cinema. Otherwise, such different art forms would not exist, because they would be a mixture. I think film is the only art form that works with the concept of time. It's not that it develops in time, because they all do: music, theatre, ballet, and other artistic activities. I refer to \"time\" in the literal sense of the word. To what a shot is, from the moment you say \"action\" until you say \"cut.\" What is that? It's the fixing of reality, fixing of time's essence. It is a way of preserving time which, in theory, gives us the possibility of moving forward and backwards freely, for all eternity. No other art form is able to fix time as cinema does. Therefore, what is cinema? It's a mosaic made of time.\n\nAfter Tarkovsky gives his definition of cinema, he touches upon the filmmaker’s style:\n\nImagine a camera, rolling for an hour on a determined scene, any scene that you want. You can see we have two cameras here. If we gave the recording of these scenes to several directors, each with a different personality, that would give us three or four types of films. Clearly, I'm not talking about tonight's footage, that could be boring, but about what, based on the given choices of what is more interesting for each director, the artist discards or keeps elements of the film, the final result changing from one director to another. The film will be different. What I'm saying is that, despite the fixing of time, of the same recording of time, the artist or the artists are able to elaborate, to choose the material, to impose their own creativity into the film.\n\nIn sharing his definition of cinema and confirming the importance of the filmmaker’s style, Tarkovsky offers a handful of scenes from films that he appreciates. Two scenes are from Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, another scene from Luis Buñuel's Nazarin, and the final scene from Michelangelo Antonioni's La Notte. Tarkovsky explains the significance of these works, leading to the reason: rhythm or the filmmaker’s style. He says:\n\nI would like to show you a few scenes that I feel are close to my films, in the language of cinema. I want you to see them to understand what is the poetic thought and how it is reflected in the art of cinema...I have shown you these scenes so you can know who my favorite directors are, or, as the writers say, those who are part of my readings. When starting a new movie, I always revisit these scenes. And I do not try to imitate them, but to be inspired by them...The poetry of these films and their authors is that they are able to transform what they touch into valuable things. The scenes we've seen are unique, exceptional, and at the same time far from what actually does happen in daily life. And, as it always happens with real artists, the fact that they are unique is what makes us define them as \"typical.\" Through these scenes, we get to know their inner world. All these scenes were shot without thinking about the desires of the viewer because they try to show beauty, truth, and not to please those who watch them. It is almost impossible today to speak in those terms. It is absurd. Because nobody is willing to invest money in poetry. But film will continue existing thanks to the resistance of these poets. You can be sure that cinema history is made of films that recreate the inner world of their artist, and not the movies we see today and that I hope will not continue to please the public for much longer. Since the beginning, cinema has been in a difficult situation. To make movies, you need money. To write poetry, all you need is some paper and pencil. I bow to those directors who keep trying, with what they have, to make their own movies. We have seen that these films have a specific, personal rhythm.\n\nBefore his final words on how he works with both the script and edit, Tarkovsky sheds light on the filmmaker’s struggle to create engaging works:\n\nCinema is as difficult as any other artistic activity. Some time ago, the Americans surveyed to find out what professions were more likely to lead a man to death due to the stress and difficulties of that profession. The survey was conducted in 1945, the year in which the atomic bomb was dropped. In the first place were test pilots. And in the second, film directors. This is not a coincidence. It is a very difficult profession, an almost suicidal profession. It is difficult because, in movies, it’s hard to be yourself. It’s easier to please others than not to please them–at least, not try to please by any means. When the director thinks “Will this please the audience?” is when he starts to make mistakes because he cares for success rather than the essence of the film.\n\nFilms have the ability to go beyond entertainment and be impacting in people’s lives as much as the most moving works of other art forms. However, for such films to thrive, it is necessary for us to give real thought and real creative expression greater importance in contemporary cinema--especially since, as Tarkovsky points out, In a way, you, the audience, are who have chosen the movies that are now in circulation. A greater cinema made of timeless films depends on it. On Antonioni’s L’Avventura, Tarkovsky says, [O]nly bad movies age...There is not an ounce of falsehood, nor anything that makes it age. Why? Because the film was directed by a poet, by a director who remained true to a vision. This ties into a question from one of the audience members to the Russian film director. When asked why he filmed Mirror between Solaris and Stalker, Andrei Tarkovsky answers, Because every movie I've done is the one I wanted to do at the time."
