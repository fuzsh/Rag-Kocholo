        "text": "© 2021 by James Clark\n\nHaving tested the waters of the mysterious Andrei Tarkovsky, by way of his film, Solaris (1972), I feel obliged to settle matters that could test the patience of those seriously intent upon appreciating processes of great merit. Braced by the sophisticated genius of the work of Ingmar Bergman, Tarkovsky has chosen to maintain a mysticism—far from supernatural—but clinging to (perhaps confusing) tinctures of mainstream devotion. In the film, Solaris, he takes his directions from Bergman’s films, The Devil’s Eye (1960) and All These Women (1964), where the force of nature pertains to pathos. Not satisfied to contest the weakness at several points of science, Tarkovsky, by way of a form of sleight of hand, installs dead victims of a violence becoming life-like to those now-touched by guilt. A perhaps questionable (though intense) means of challenging the brutality of wayward captains of a small planet. An unbalanced touch in the service of deep pathos should not become a song and dance. Bergman, the kudos notwithstanding, would not be a fan.\n\nOur second selection, here, namely, The Sacrifice (1986), mercifully desists from fantasy, though its cast of players tends to whimsy. (I’ve chosen this film, being Tarkovsky’s final work, a work by way of the young maestro’s being stricken by fatal cancer, because this film administers most effectively the artist’s campaign, leaving the other films to supplement the rigors. Our study today recalls all those pedantic, bourgeois targets whom Bergman regarded as travesties. Whereas being “educated” appears to virtually everyone’s sense of virtue, Bergman [and now Tarkovsky] want us to see a very different form of action, and thereby a form of problematic reflection never being saliant, because the educational history of the planet has throttled a crucial aspect.)\n\nOur film begins with one, “Alexander,” (an echo of the affluent Alexander of the Bergman film, Fanny and Alexander[1983]), planting by the sea, a fragile tree. This tree does not become décor, but instead a statement, a statement of recognition that, by way of study of not only Japanese culture but Eastern Orthodox culture, he has reached the comprehension of treasures of the depths of life itself. Along that shore, he includes his young son, Little Man, and attempts to introduce him into the life of understanding. “Once upon a time, long ago, an old monk lived in an Orthodox monastery. His name was Pamve. And once he planted a barren tree on a mountainside, just like this. Then he told his young pupil, a monk named Ioann Kolov, that he should water the tree each day until it came to life. Anyway, early every morning Ioann filled a dipper with water and went out. He climbed up the mountain and watered the withered tree, and in the evening when darkness had fallen he returned to the monastery. He did this for three years. And one fine day he climbed up the mountain and saw that the whole tree was covered with blossoms! Say what you will, but a method, a system, has its virtues. You know, sometimes I say to myself, if every single day, at exactly the stroke of the clock, one were to perform the same act, like a ritual, unchanging, systematic, every day, at the same time, the world would be changed… Yes, something would change… It would have to… Beautiful, eh? Like Japanese Ikabana.”\n\nOn the other hand, Alexander, and his sidekick (the latter desultory to a mountainous degree), describe scenes from the mid-century play, Waiting for Godot, by Samuel Beckett. (The withered tree, the withered land, the withered bid.) You’ll recall, I hope, that the repetitious pedantry there was not “beautiful.” In fact, that that work was aptly ensconced within what was called, “Theatre of the Absurd.” His disciplined dialogue going for naught. On another note, however, it’s Alexander’s birthday and new maturity would be a nice gift (except that the maturity needed seems only derived from the bidder alone). The gardening barely mustering enough rocks at the base to keep the statement from crashing. Along comes Otto, the cyclist/ mailman with a card for the dreamer. Not having brought his reading glasses, it is the job of the postman to deliver the joy. “Happy Birthday, dear friend. STOP. Mighty regards, great good Prince Myshkin. STOP. God grant you joy, health and peace. STOP. From your loyal Richardians and Idiotists. STOP.” Alexander remarks, “Friends and their jokes…. That’s not half bad.”\n\nTaking up the matter of God, in the card, Alexander brags that his relationship to God is “non-existent.” He adds, “It could be worse.” (It could be, that he not, as his “Mighty” clique prefers, treat the matter of willful incoherence like a child. All those stops unheeded.) Otto, happy to be invited to the birthday party later, pays homage to his friend. “Here you are, a famous journalist, a theatrical and literary critic, who lectures on aesthetics for students at the university and produces essays… But you’re so gloomy. You shouldn’t become tangled with something vaguely arduous. You shouldn’t be waiting for anything…”/ “Who says I’m waiting for something?” His friend insists, then, utterly inarticulate, “We’re all waiting for something.” (And yet!) “All my life, in fact, I’ve been going around waiting for something.” (Godot?) “And I’ve always felt as if the living I’ve done, so far, hasn’t actually been real life… but a long wait for it… a long wait for something real, something important… What about you?”/ Alexander, not long ago a maven of the immutable, comes across with, “Yes, if that’s what you mean. I just never knew you were interested in that kind of problem.” Our protagonist veers away with, “Do you really think that mankind could devise a universal concept, a model, so to speak, of Absolute Truth? Why, it’d be like trying to create a new universe!” Alexander, on this wave of speculation, adds, “Look here my boy, we’ve lost our way. Humanity is also on the wrong road.”\n\nHere our leading man rallies somewhat, concerning the day he and his wife, driving along this stretch, discovered their Dream House. “I knew that if I lived there, I’d be happy until I died.” Quickly dismissing the situation of death in the mix, he tells her, “Don’t be afraid. There is no such thing as death. No, there’s the fear of death, and that is an awful fear. Sometimes it even makes people do things they shouldn’t. But how different things would be if only we could stop fearing death.”\n\nSomewhat like the wiggle room of Hari, in Solaris, we’ve backed into a very unique and placid form of death, without disclosure of its corollary. Why? Surely, as with the hatchet-job toward superficial science, there is an animus against mainstream sophistication. Tarkovsky, aware of course, that modern life thrives upon inconsistency, overdoes that matter, to the point of absurdity. Why? I’m betting on his unspoken carrying of a vision of cogency so hard and so joyous which works only within a transaction between a solitary and nature itself. The fervid melodrama to come would function as a sort of barren mountainside to discern, and not only survive, but to delight as far as one’s life reaches, with its inconsistencies and solace, and then to disappear. (During the concern about a missing motif [the whole action being well described as a tone poem], Little Man had attached a rope between Otto’s bike and a tree, with a result of the postman’s being dumped. All in good spirits! All in good Beckett.)\n\nBefore the birthday party convenes, Alexander faints, after being surprised by the boy, who receives a bleeding nose in the melee. During that moment he calls out, “Dear God, what’s wrong with me?” Cut to a black and white “documentary,” of a city in panic. Following that haunting portrayal, we see Alexander at home, appreciating a book of ancient Christian imagery, before the hoped-for festivity.\n\nThe first arrivals are Adelaide, a former actress and a former mistress of Alexander, in his days as a theatrical actor, and Victor, a medical doctor and lover of Adelaide. Victor, after opening by, “I had a rotten day today. Or rather, a day I lost control of…” adds, “Have you never felt that your life was a failure?” Before coming in, the doctor had protested, “I don’t like his (Alexander’s) monologues… Moreover, there is the uncomfortableness, in the air, that I’ll soon be leaving for Australia” (where I’ve been offered a clinic). Their twentyish daughter, Marta, asks, “Are you serious?” (That the dialogue is stagy here relates to the flimsiness of the sensibility.) Someone very intent is the next visitor, Otto, now appearing with a large, ancient, framed map of Europe, as a gift—a form of discovery. He had striven with the weight, pushing his bike. (The others brought a bottle of wine in their chic car.) Someone from the earlier group teases him, “Julia [the in-house servant], your beaux’s coming calling.” Julia helps Otto with the heavy picture. The others declare it a reproduction; but Alexander ascertains it to be genuine. “It’s too expensive, Otto,” the man of the night scolds gently. The alert working man argues, “I know it’s a sacrifice, but why shouldn’t it be? Of course it’s a sacrifice!” (Victor looks at the map once again.) Otto, having been set up by the world of diplomas, pushes back, “Every gift involves a sacrifice. If not, what kind of gift would it be?” (The pride to reach a form of validity. And also, though, the flagging veer of advantage.) Quick on the draw, Adelaide, not a nostrum of rare sensibility, blurts out, “But I liked being the great actor’s wife.” This, then, elicits from the patrician/ intellectual, the idea that the gift “looks like Mars” (a conflict). “It has nothing to do with truth. But people lived then.” Otto adds, “And not badly, either.” The postman, not wanting to seem naïve, picks a fight about Alexander’s interest in “truth.” “What truth? You keep going on about truth. Truth, what is truth? There is no such thing! Here comes a cockroach!” But Victor lunges, “A fantastic map! It’s a first-class chart…”\n\nThen the party, running all the way to the morning, begins in earnest. Active Victor opens the theatre by asking more about Otto’s having more time for his interests, due to a very slight caseload. “I’m sort of a collector, a collector of incidents. Things that are inexplainable but true.” The largely sanguine and generous soul proceeds to reiterate the bizarre function of pathos concerning a dead victim becoming active on the basis of, once again—as in the Tarkovsky film, Solaris—being a figure of reflective singularity. “Are you pulling our leg?” Victor sneers… “And you see fit to joke with us, Mister Postman?” In the glare of ridicule, the metaphysical overkill creates a fainting spell (the second philosopher in the day, to fall). On coming to, he explains, “Only an evil angel…” Otto, not pleased, declares, “There’s nothing to joke about here.”\n\nA few minutes later, a more comprehensive trouble appears. The political powers that be, fake a nuclear crisis, and a nuclear blah. “The only dangerous enemy in our midst at the moment is panic. It’s contagious. Order and organization, and nothing less, good citizens… Only order… order… order…” Soon Adelaide is overcome with the notion of imminent death, and requires a strong needle. (One of countless impetus to emigrate.) With panic in the room, the others acquit themselves with sangfroid. A rolling passion. Will it frequent the house? Even more challenging is the yard. An infrequent, supplementary servant, Maria, perhaps being impossible to frighten, turns up by way of Alexander’s need for vision. The vision she delivers is not promising. She’s asked, by the only too-facile inquisitive, “Who made that [fuss]?”/ (Ask a stupid question, and you get a stupid answer.) “Little Man.”/ “Really! But what is it?”/ “He made it for you. It’s his birthday present to you. It was he and Otto the postman who built it together. Don’t say that I told you, Mister Alexander. I’ll go now.” She turns back for a minute, “Happy Birthday.” He replies, “Go home now. It’s so damp out, like a battlefield.” (The exquisite hat she wears, infused with visions of wild, stunning foliage, brings a focus upon something exciting. Though her Bohemian appearance drew the lose-cannon, Adelaide, to avoid looking at her, the free-lancer undertakes her chores, preparatory to a feast that never occurs, unfailingly in her sense of dignity. “I’ll put the plates to warm at once… Can I go now?” The rude bourgeoise plays cat and mouse. Maria asks, “Is there something more?”/ “Oh, one more thing! Would you put the candles on the table. Then you may go… You have opened the wine, haven’t you?”/ “No.”/ “Well, open it. Then you won’t be needed…” More testing in unintentional form, by Otto: “We’re neighbors, she and I… We’re acquainted. She came from Iceland a few years ago. She is very odd.” / “Who?” Victor asks, with a smirk./ “Maria… Yes, Maria. Sometimes she scares me…” Adelaide makes a point of snubbing Maria. Near the end of this cataract of a film, with the house ablaze, Adelaide is not only missing, but forgotten.\n\nNow the singularities come in twos. With seemingly, anything goes, Alexander thrills, “I’ve waited for this all my life. My whole life. My whole life has been one long wait for this! With Otto cringing before the “gloominess” of Leonardo’s print of the painting, “The Adoration of the Three Kings,” he seeks to strike a confederacy with Adelaide, the routed (seemingly part of that black and white visitation). The postman listens to the now tranquillized screamer. “I have loved one man and married another… When two people love each other, they don’t love in the same way. One of them is strong, the other weaker. And the weaker is always the one who loves without reckoning, without reservation.” (Her flakiness nailing down Hollywood melodramatic “women’s films,” from the Depression-era and beyond. “Meaningful interaction” being astoundingly difficult because there has been no concentration upon what a human is—the church and science having been the worst of candidates.) Plowing ahead, she imparts, “It feels now as if I’ve awakened from some kind of life. For some reason, I always offered resistance. I fought against something. I defended myself, just as though I’d had someone else inside me, saying, ‘Don’t give in to anything… don’t go along with… anything… or you’ll die!’ But God, how foolish we are anyway!” (Bathos, bathos, bathos…) In the same collapse, Otto tells her, “It’s good that you finally understood that…” She adds, “I’ve finally understood, even though it’s a bit late. But what shall I do now?” She tries to stand up. Otto says, “Easy, easy…”\n\nAlexander opens a valise and takes out a gun. Does he imagine himself to be a lawman? He spends a short time observing Little Man asleep, while luxurious curtains create alternate brightness and darkness. The boy has a cloth, covering his throat. Perhaps a slight injury from the collision. Domesticity and violence. (The renowned cinematographer, Sven Nykvist, as with his stellar career with Bergman, brings a quiet powerhouse of discompose.) Next step for the unpredictable protagonist, is a cognac, and then many cognacs. Over to the Leonardo. He chants the Lord’s Prayer. The gunman turns to his own rhetoric. “Lord! Deliver us in this terrible time. Don’t let my children die, nor my friends…my wife.” (Yes, he apparently does have a wife, but she’s not a good communicator. Lives leaving, lives hoping to embrace.) “And Victor… All those who do not believe in Thee, because they are blind, those who haven’t given Thee a thought, simply because they haven’t yet been truly miserable. All those who, in this hour of our lost hope, their future, their lives and the opportunity to surrender to Thy will. All those who are filled with dread, who feel the end coming closer, who fear, not for themselves but for their loved ones. All those whom no one, except Thou can offer protection. Because this war is the ultimate war. And after it, there will be no victors and no vanquished, no cities or towns, grass or trees, water in the sky.” (A smog of cliches.)\n\n“Waited for this, all my life…”/ Show time! “I will give Thee all I have. I’ll give up my family, whom I love. I’ll destroy my house and give up Little Man… I’ll be mute, and never speak another word to anyone. I will relinquish everything that binds me to life, if only Thou restore everything as it was before, as it was this morning and yesterday. Just let me rid of this deadly, sickening, animal fear…” (An anatomy of a coward.) “Yes, everything, Lord! Help me. I will do everything I have promised Thee.” (The thrust of so-called “animal fear” surpassing, by far, in dignity the ways of humans who cover their sensibility as in a tailspin positioned upon a rollercoaster.) On hands and knees, toward the Leonardo. Then outside, and sludge down to the ankles. We see the integrity of a stand of pine trees.\n\nBack home, he’s dressed like a priest. Otto tells him, “There’s still one last chance, one last hope… Engage in coitus with Maria. Maria can do it… You must go to her, and convince her.” Both of them become drunk. Otto begins to obsessively come his hair. He tells the biblical scholar, “I’ve gathered evidence. She is a witch… There is no other alternative. I’ve left the bike for you down by the shed.” (Mood aplenty; but going nowhere, because sludge fails to dig deep enough.)\n\nSurprisingly enough, this leg of the crash (Alexander having fallen off the bike and being left with a limp to the denouement) has a hope. At the door of Maria’s place, in the middle of the night, a small flock of sheep run back and forth. (Sheep being a violent crisis point in many Bergman films.) Ill at ease, our protagonist is at a loss for words, in the semi-darkness. “Why don’t you say something?” she asks, knowing he’s wildly overrated. (He gazes at the gas lamp, a source of energy to her, but no such thing to him.) She notices his dirty and bleeding hands. In cleaning him up, she says, as if to a child or an idiot, “You mustn’t go about with dirty hands.” The tiniest of crosses on the wall, suggesting that much more effort be expended upon matters of vision than matters of demand. He rallies with charming, media articulation. She has a small organ in the room and he’s quick to play a passage. “As a child, I played this prelude. My mother loved it years ago. I often went to visit my mother in the country… Her cottage was surrounded by a garden, dreadfully neglected and overgrown. Even then, my mother was very ill. She almost never left the house. Still, in its way, it was beautiful. (Maria sheds a tear. She had been touched by the music, and touched with the calculations of a not to be long in this world modest appreciation of nature. The rest of the haunting would not create a tear. He admits that his bid to improve the garden was heavy-handed , leaving the lady with a sterile failure to look away from. [A slightly clever performance of bathos. In The Devil’s Eye, a man conscientiously feeling guilt for slighting his long-dead mother, impresses the women he wants to make love with, and a performance of passionate pathos ensues.]) Alexander piling on another show of “heart,” pertaining to his father being cruel to his sister, and subsequently crying in guilt, would measure clearly the mediocrity having invaded. Out comes, “Could you love me, Maria?”/ “Go home now,” she tells him. He counters with, “Don’t kill us. Save us, Maria!” On his putting the gun to his head, she rushes to him, saying, “You poor, poor man…” (Don’t, though, for a second, think, at this juncture [Maria not amused], she’s not had to contemplate the crosshairs of a nasty devastating scandal.) She plays along to shut down the drama. “Who has frightened you so?” (She’s the only one around not fooled by the politicians.) Calm down, calm down… I understand, I know [that I could be run out of town, or worse]. I know [Alexander’s elusive wife is wicked]… Don’t be afraid of anything… Everything’s going to be all right…” [in bed]. Using the phrases, “You poor, poor man… there, there,” the connection, as it were, adopts a slow carousel, lifting off a few feet toward heaven. “Nothing will happen to you here,” she assures the critical sleuth. “Don’t cry, don’t cry…”\n\nCut to the black and white city, and its load of gamers, its load of pedantry and its load of advantage. The power comes back at the Dream House, and Alexander has changed his priestly garb in favor of a black shawl with a Japanese insignia. On avoiding the alfresco breakfast which included the presence of a loud and argumentative wife coming on board (having, it seems, that she preferred to snub the entire joy in one of the upstairs rooms), Alexander, biding his time at the shed until the party marches off for their constitutional, ramps up his short wave upon Japan and its music and proceeds to burn down the Dream House. Soon the party rushes to confront a singularity failing to shed light. A bathetic melodrama. The cosmopolitan dresser announces, “I did it. Listen to me. I’ve got something very important…” Falling to his knees, he demands, from out of his gross lostness, “Say nothing! Ask nothing!” His wife holds him and rocks him as if a baby. Rushing away, he encounters Maria wondering, perhaps, where her finances stand. He falls to her knees. Victor tries to move him away. “Come, Alexander! You can’t stay here!” They drag him away, but he rushes back to Maria, only to be dragged away again. The woman with a capacity for pathos, tells the mob, “Let him be! What are you doing to him!” The violent wife attacks, and Maria backs off. Though she subsides in the finale, Maria is the one to watch, the one transcending “normality,” the one grown up. (How many lone figures like this have we seen in the films of Bergman?)\n\nAn ambulance arrives. The family marches toward it. Then he’s off again, leading a contingent, a picture of Theatre of the Absurd. Otto holds him, but both of them are captives of “a long wait for something real,” the cosmetics of lucidity, in lieu of the real war and its arduous days. The critic races in the direction of the inferno, and the House of the Leaders is reduced to smoke. Maria bikes across the fields to catch up to the ambulance and the last of his madness. On the rude path toward her bivouac, the quiet distances manage to be remarkable.\n\nLittle Man is watering the pedantic tree. Even worse, he mentions, “In the beginning was the Word… Why is that, Papa?” The tree, panning upward against the sun and sea, is doing very well by itself. An operatic snippet also seems a bourgeois touch, even funerial.\n\nMany initiatives come our way here. Skillful film artists can reveal much about the life around us and ourselves. They add up, however, to be, a job for the viewer/ reader, the viewer /reader’s gut. Beyond cinema, there is a universe of intentional sensibility, which can never fully deliver on the screen. No matter how evocative, the crucial topspin of major films might reach, their tactile creativity, their full-scale drama will fail to complete the realization. It comes as a shock, to those practitioners, that the very most contentious historical powers in film are off limits to the screen. When strong filmmakers want to fully think what is so wrong that religion and bourgeois-technical-science are paramount in our life, they become tongue tied.\n\nFor all his film career scanning 60 years, Ingmar Bergman would send hordes of images of hands and fingers in play in his works, being not quite germane because the force in play is intimate. Moreover, another standby would be dialectic positioning, hoping for synthesis that only individual carnality could essentially deliver. The seas of such creativity would require a unique rostrum indeed. A paradox to ponder."
