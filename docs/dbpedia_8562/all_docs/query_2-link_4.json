        "text": "I have heart that Ã‚Â Andrei Tarkovsky made some very interessting movies and it is time for me to watch some.\n\nWell I have heart about this:\n\nThe Mirror\n\nIvan’s Childhood (aka My Name is Ivan)\n\nAndrei Rublev\n\nSolaris\n\nStalker\n\nAnd IÃ‚Â´m not sure which one I should start. Is there someone who can give me some recommondations?\n\nIt seems that Solaris could be the best entry, what do you think?\n\nHave you seen more of his work?\n\nWhy does everyone recommend Solaris? Cuz it is his best work or cuz it is the best entry in his work?\n\nAnd can you give me some more detailed information about your thought of Solaris?\n\nI saw 90% of Solaris. (There was a 15 minute stretch where I had to leave the television to do something else). It’s great. It seems to be his most known film, so I’d start there. I haven’t seen many of his movies myself, and I hope to do so soon. He’s the Soviet response to Kubrick (and I LOVE Kubrick).\n\nSo I will try to buy Solaris…\n\nit seems really to be the best entry in his movies…\n\nHm, the soviest Kubrick , well in this case his movies must be good…\n\nAnyone on this board has seen an other Tarkovsky?\n\nSome recommondations for me?\n\n[quote]So I will try to buy Solaris…[/quote]\n\nRewind @ www.dvdcompare.net - Solaris AKA Solyaris (1972)\n\nthis should help you decide which version to get. Criterion are as expensive as fuck though\n\nSo far, IÃ‚Â´ve only seen STALKER - that movie is really terrific. Absolutely awesome direction which reminds me a lot of Stanley KubrickÃ‚Â´s directing style in some scenes. For example, thereÃ‚Â´s a five or maybe six minute dialogue sequence that was completely done in one shot, with some kind of ultra-slow zoom into the scenery. Simply stunning. Besides that, the whole movie has a wonderful, underlying dangerous atmosphere, with some pretty stirring sequences.\n\nProbably one of the best european films IÃ‚Â´ve seen in my days, even though it feels a little “stretched” during the last hour.\n\nQuestion (due to the fact, that I have not that much money, I can not buy everything…):\n\nWould it be better to buy the DVDs of Tarkovsky and Sonderbergh of Solaris and read the book written by Lem.\n\nOr should I focus of seeing more “only” Tarkovsky movies?\n\nWhat would be better.\n\nFocusing on one theme or on one director?\n\nFocus on the director - the Soderbergh version of SOLARIS, in my opinion, isnÃ‚Â´t a must see. ItÃ‚Â´s well done and quite interesting for various reasons, but I really donÃ‚Â´t think it can keep up with the original (even if I donÃ‚Â´t know it).\n\nAnd if youÃ‚Â´re planning to read the book in any case, you should do that before checking out the movie.\n\n@ Yoshi: I found out that they will shown Solaris in a theatre in Dortmund in two week! IsnÃ‚Â´t it great, I wanna see a Tarkovsky movie and some days later I have the chance!\n\nAbove all bob from the Manifest board recommended me to see it on the big screen than to see it on TV.\n\n‘Mirror’ is a fantastic film. Since film is the art of what you see coupled with the length of time that you see it then ‘Mirror’ is a good example of a film that utilises that discipline very well without resorting to storytelling. Nothing against storytelling. I like a good story myself. ‘Mirror’ consists of the memories of an unseen dying man (though some might want to correct me on that, the last time I saw it was in 1996) and uses colour and monochrome cinematography coupled with newsreel footage. In some sense the film could be called ‘Amacord’ (’ I Remember’)\n\nTaken from the same website Andrei speaks about contemporary (1982) cinema:\n\nTo make a film you need money. To write a poem all you need is pen and paper. This puts cinema at a disadvantage. But I think cinema is invincible, and I bow down to all the directors who try to realise their own films despite everything. All the films from which I’ve shown examples have their own rhythm. (Nowadays, it seems, most directors use rapid short scenes, and directors who use cutting and speed are considered to be ‘really professional.’) The aim of any true director is to express truth, but what do producers care? In the 1940s, there was a survey in America ranking professions according to stress. This was at the time of Hiroshima and pilots came out on top. The second place went to film directors. It’s almost a suicidal profession."
