        "text": "Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky (Russian: Андре́й Арсе́ньевич Тарко́вский) (April 4, 1932 - December 29, 1986) was a Soviet movie director, writer and opera director. Tarkovksy is listed as one of the 100 filmmakers best liked by movie critics.[1] He received critical acclaim for directing such movies as Andrei Rublev, Solaris and Stalker.\n\nTarkovsky also did a lot of work as a screenwriter, movie editor and theater director. He was also important as a movie theorist. He directed most of his movies in the Soviet Union, with the exception of his last two movies which were produced in Italy and Sweden. His movies are characterized by Christian spirituality and metaphysical themes. Other things that are typical for his movies are extremely long takes, the lack of conventional dramatic structure and plot, and memorable images of exceptional beauty.\n\nTarkovsky died of lung cancer in Paris, at age 54.\n\nOther websites\n\n[change | change source]"
