The grant of $16,600 will support a community reading program focused on Roz Chast’s graphic memoir Can’t We Talk About Sometime More Pleasant? in March 2025.\n\n“We are so excited at Peter White Public Library to be bringing the NEA Big Read back to the Upper Peninsula,” said Marty Achatz, Adult Programming Coordinator and Big Read organizer for Peter White Public Library. “And we’re excited to be focusing on Roz Chast’s Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?, which highlights subjects like intergenerational communication, elder care, family dynamics, and people who make up a community. Chast approaches this subject matter with so much humor and compassion. Everyone is going to fall in love with this book.”\n\nIn total, the NEA is investing $1,075,000 to support programming centered around a book from the NEA Big Read Library, with the goal of inspiring meaningful conversations, celebrating local creativity, elevating a wide variety of voices and perspectives, and building stronger connections in each community.\n\n“With every page turned, the NEA Big Read fosters understanding, empathy, and connection,” says Dr. Maria Rosario Jackson, Chair of the NEA. “Through a shared reading experience, our NEA Big Read grantees will explore their collective story and sense of place, cultivating a deeper appreciation for the diverse narratives that make up our beautiful and complex communities.”\n\nThe NEA Big Read offers a range of titles that reflect many different voices and perspectives, aiming to inspire conversation and discovery. The main feature of the initiative is a grants program, managed by Arts Midwest, which annually supports dynamic community reading programs.\n\n“We live in a nation full of so many stories,” says Torrie Allen, President and CEO of Arts Midwest. “The NEA Big Read offers jumping off points for us to connect, converse, and learn about each other, all inspired by incredible books.”\n\nThis Big Read cycle focuses on the theme “Where We Live.” Grantees chose their NEA Big Read book based on how its themes, characters, and setting relate to the unique aspects of their community.\n\nPeter White Public Library will partner with many community organizations and libraries for its Big Read programming, including the Center for Native American Studies at Northern Michigan University (NMU), English Department at NMU, Marquette Regional History Center, Upper Peninsula Children’s Museum, and arts organizations and libraries throughout the U. P.\n\nThe NEA Big Read will kick off on Monday, March 3, 2025, at Peter White Public Library with an event featuring award-winning novelist John Smolens discussing the subject of researching history/historical personages to understand who we are and where we live. Other programs during the month include writing workshops, movies, art exhibits, and a virtual appearance by Roz Chast, author of Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?\n\nSince 2006, the National Endowment for the Arts has funded more than 1,800 NEA Big Read programs, partnering with over 40,000 organizations. More than six million Americans have attended an NEA Big Read event, and over 90,000 volunteers have participated at the local level to make NEA Big Read activities possible. For more information about the NEA Big Read, including book and author information, podcasts, and videos, visit arts.gov/neabigread.\n\nEstablished by Congress in 1965, the National Endowment for the Arts is the independent federal agency whose funding and support gives Americans the opportunity to participate in the arts, exercise their imaginations, and develop their creative capacities. Through partnerships with state arts agencies, local leaders, other federal agencies, and the philanthropic sector, the Arts Endowment supports arts learning, affirms and celebrates America’s rich and diverse cultural heritage, and extends its work to promote equal access to the arts in every community across America.
