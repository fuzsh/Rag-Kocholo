(JOHN) 81 YEARS 4/06/2022\n\nHelen Fearnley advised that husband John had suffered from serious illnesses for the past 4 years but was a fighter and will be missed by the family.\n\nHelen said that she was the daughter of John Hobbs, a Senior Executive in Staff Department at the time of merger of ANZ and ES&A when she and John married. She was transferred to ES&A and John to ANZ, and they were happily married for 52 years. The marriage featured in the local press with headlines along the lines of “Happy Merger, Happy Family”.\n\nDavid Jones and Bruce Mathrick texted to say that their old Treasury chum John Fearnley passed away on 4/06/2022.” A quiet man of integrity who you could rely on and trust in the support roles he held.”\n\nLANCASTER S.A. (STAN) 87 YEARS `28/05/2022\n\nDierdre, widow of Stan has prepared a brief article on Stan’s ANZ career and his interests which follows …..\n\n“Stan Lancaster was born on 26/8/1934 – died 28/5/2022\n\nHe commenced his working life with the E.S. & A. Bank (January 1951 in Ballarat) which was in due course taken over by the ANZ Bank.\n\nHe was admitted to practice as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court on 1/10/1979 after studying part time while working in the bank. This involved early morning and late-night lectures outside of 9.00-5.00 working hours whilst he was also raising a young family.\n\nWhen he turned 18, he had to register for National Service and served in the Navy, part of that time was on HMAS WAGGA, a mine sweeper. He always said he mainly learned how to polish brass.\n\nHis final position at the ANZ Bank was as Chief Legal Officer with quite a few solicitors working within his department.\n\nHe finally retired from the Bank in 1992 and enjoyed fly fishing and golf at Eastern Golf Club. Stan was a life member of The Victorian Fly Fishers’ Association. He enjoyed many adventures, travelling both overseas and within Australia, throughout his retirement.\n\nStan is survived by his wife of 62 years, Deirdre Lancaster, 2 daughters, 7 grandchildren and 1 great grandchild.”\n\nMAUNDER D. L. (DAVID} 93 YEARS 12/11/2020\n\nWidow Janet advised us of David’s passing 18 months ago.\n\nOn behalf of ANZROC members our condolences are extended to the families and friends of John, Stan and David.\n\nFURTHER TRIBUTES TO PASSED MEMBERS\n\nROBIN PEATFIELD FAREWELL\n\nEamon Veaney emailed “Robin Peatfield had a great send off at Wildgrain restaurant in Mornington on Tuesday June 7 attended by a large contingent of family and friends.

Barbara will be dearly missed by many. Forever in our Hearts.”\n\nFor many years Barbara was a regular attendee to our ANZROC lunches and a valued correspondent contributing to our newsletter.\n\nEamon Veaney emailed “Barbara Bruce had a heartwarming funeral service at St Leonard's Uniting Church at Brighton with an excellent turn out of family and friends. Barbara had planned the whole service in a meticulous manner including detailed notes on her life which formed the basis of her eulogy. We learned of her early family and school life and her long-standing association with the church including her time in the choir. She retired from a 40-year career with ES&A and ANZ in 1990 when she was PA to GM International, John Holberton. She then returned part-time for another 5 years working in International.\n\nBarbara then spent time as a volunteer with the MCG / MCC for a number of years and was an Essendon Bombers supporter for over 70 years. Their theme song was played as she departed the church.\n\nHer good friends Maria Natoli and Jill Paterson also attended the funeral. Vale Barb.”\n\nGraham Holt emailed “I had the pleasure of working with Barbara in International Division in the 1970’s. In more recent years Carole and I often caught up with her on the train home from an Essendon match. After a win the discussion was always on how good we were, however in more recent years we talked about the days in International and Barbara had a million stories to tell about her regular trips to England. Memories of Barbara always are accompanied with a smile.”\n\nKate Freer from National Sports Museum Volunteers emailed “We recently received the very sad news that one of our retired volunteers, Barbara Bruce, died at the age of 91 on 13th April, after declining health in recent weeks.\n\nBarbara was in the inaugural group of National Sports Museum Volunteers who started in 2008 and was a regular in the Tuesday team. Barbara was an MCC Member and also volunteered in the MCC Museum for several years until she retired in 2019.\n\nIn her working career, Barb worked at the ANZ Bank for many years, and was an excellent typist. Barb also volunteered at the Commonwealth Games in 2006, she was very well travelled and a keen Bombers supporter.\n\nEveryone who knew Barb would agree that she was a very kind, gentle and intelligent person, and a pleasure to spend time with. “\n\nPEATFIELD A.R.D.(ROBIN) 77 YEARS 14/05/2022\n\nSue Peatfield phoned to advise of the passing of husband Robin aged 77 years on 14/05/2022 after struggling with a severe chest infection. Robin was well known to many ANZ’ers spending time in London and Melbourne where I used to often see him at the ANZ functions. Robin and Sue left the bank and moved to South Gippsland to become dairy farmers until they returned to Mount Martha to be with family. Robin had a quick mind and a dry wit. He will be missed.\n\nMembership Officer Reny Frighetto emailed “Very sad news. Robin was a delight to be around, and his humour was very catchy.”\n\nDavid Jones emailed “He was a character Eamon. Robin left ANZ to become a dairy farmer which he doubled with being a lecturer at one of the Gippsland educational institutions. Bob Bennett coaxed him back to ANZ in the early 80s and he took over from Ron Cashin as senior manager running the Queens Road training centre. He also got the top job as the head of global HR along the way.”\n\nEamon Veaney emailed “I first met Robin in London when I joined the Bank in 1967 working in Cashbook. Robin was on a graduate transfer from Australia at the time from recollection. Our paths crossed years later when he was appointed to a Senior role in London in the 1980's. More recently Robin attended our ANZROC lunches in Geelong and Mount Martha. He will be missed.” https://www.anzroc.com.au/roc-notice-board/1028-vale-robin-peatfield-respected-member-of-anzroc-victoria-aged-77-on-14-5-2022\n\nSTEWART J.W. (JACK) 86 YEARS 19/03/2022\n\nAndree Stewart-Speed, daughter of our Honorary Member Jack Stewart emailed “I am very sad to advise that my dear father Jack passed away peacefully at home on 19 March 2022 aged 86 years.\n\nHe loved his career at ANZ which spanned 39 years starting out at the age of 16 he loved work and made many friends. We had a great photo of the Staff at the 350 Collins Street Stock Exchange branch at the service.\n\nHe also had a great time as relieving officer in country Victoria for a period and often helped out when needed for other duties.\n\nIt was funny to hear some of the things he did such as\n\n· putting on the footy boots for Katamatite when they were a player short\n\n· serving behind the bar at a pub where he was staying when the barman called in sick\n\n· playing the drums one night when the band member couldn’t make it\n\nHe was a great sportsman playing, cricket, football, and athletics and was a life member at Mulgrave Football Club.\n\nJack also did his National service in the Australian Navy at age 18 for 6 months.\n\nHe enjoyed reading the newsletters and seeing familiar names. On a personal note, for me, I worked at ANZ for 12 years and I also fondly remember some of the names I read in the newsletters.\n\nPhil Dunstan was my first manager and I fondly remember Paul McKernan, Roy Sloggett, Dieter Telburn, and Stephen Green.”\n\nOur condolences are extended to the families and friends of Barbara, Robin and Jack.\n\nFURTHER TRIBUTES TO PASSED MEMBERS\n\nCHRIS FIEGGEN\n\nIan Fieggen emailed “The funeral went well, and I was pleased to have spoken with four of Dad's old work colleagues who attended. My memory is blurred due to the events and emotions of the day – but I seem to recall that three were fellow programmers while one was from the communications dept?\n\nFor some time, I've been considering doing something worthwhile with Dad's early ANZ computing memorabilia. I'll probably add a section to my own website covering this chapter in Dad's life.”\n\nROB TURNBULL\n\nPeter Harney emailed “I was shocked at hearing of the loss of Rob so suddenly after a short illness. Our banking careers almost mirrored each other. Rob was in Horsham in the early 70's, then we met up in Stawell followed by transfers moving Rob and Cheryl to Wodonga and we were sent to Wangaratta. Further transfers came up with the Turnbull's to Kyabram and us to Shepparton. We then went our separate ways for a number of year until we finally came together again in Ballarat. Rob remained in the financial field after we both resigned in 1993. I went carpet cleaning. He was a great bloke and will be missed by many of his old banking mates. “\n\nFIEGGEN C.W.(CHRIS) 90 YEARS 21/03/2022\n\nIan Fieggen emailed: Just a quick word to say that my father, Chris Fieggen, passed away peacefully this morning aged 90 years. Chris was one of the founder members of ANZ IT/DP department in the 1960's and was well respected by all.\n\nIan McCormick emailed: Chris died at his nursing facility on the outskirts of Geelong in the early hours of 21st March.\n\nHe joined the Armstrong Siddeley Car Club in August 1966 (the Vic Branch's 5th meeting when I was still at school) and remained a member until his Sapphire Limousine and Saloon were sold.\n\nHis youngest child, daughter Jenny Marshall in Adelaide took over the Limo and it is now beautifully restored, being now dark blue over light (bluish) grey.\n\nLouis Hebrard emailed “Yes, very sad. Chris had been unwell for quite some time. I have fond recollections of Chris in my early days as \"second generation\" computer programmer in 1969. He was so welcoming and helpful. A straight talker with a great sense of humour. A dedicated and proud family man. We shared a love of good cars, and I appreciated his passion for his two Armstrong Siddeleys. Vale Chris.”\n\nTAYLOR KEITH CLARKE 93 YEARS 30/01/2022\n\nSon Peter contacted Reny Frighetto to advise of his father, Keith’s passing on 30/01/2022.\n\nTURNBULL ROB 73 YEARS 05/04/2022\n\nWidow Cheryl advised that Rob passed away suddenly on 5/04/2022.\n\nOur condolences are extended to the Families and friends of our passed members Chris, Keith and Rob.\n\nFURTHER TRIBUTES TO PASSED MEMBERS\n\nBob Lamb emailed “Some weeks ago Ray Allsop and I attended the funeral of Trevor Cookson.\n\nTrevor was the son of Bill Cookson, the legendary secretary of The Essendon Football Club.\n\nTrevor was a handy all-rounder sportsman and later-on coached the Bank`s Football Side.\n\nNot many weeks later, Ray also passed away.\n\nLast week my wife ANNE (nee LAWLESS) and I attended the funeral of Frank Donovan at Kilmore.\n\nANNE knew Frank from his visit to Horsham in 1951 and I knew him as Area Manager/Moonee Ponds.”\n\nDONOVAN FRANCIS LEO (FRANK)\n\nBob Grant emailed “I was sad to learn of Frank Donovan’s passing on the 6thMarch.\n\nI was Manager Operations when Frank was Area Manager, Moonee Ponds.\n\nHe was a thorough gentleman and a great boss.\n\nHe married late in life to Mary, and I know that they had a least one child, a son.\n\nHe loved the farm at Kilmore, and it is good to know that he had such a long and fruitful life.\n\nLindsay Baglin was the Lending Manager at Moonee Ponds Area in Frank’s time, and it is good to see his name appearing in the March Birthday list. Have a good one Lindsay.\n\nSorry to hear of the recent passing of Trevor Cookson, who was an Accountant at one of the branches in the Moonie Ponds Area during my time there, and Bob Stamps who I knew through cricket.\n\nAs others have said Bob was a very good bowler and a champion guy. It was always great to be in his company.”\n\nFrank Valastro emailed “I read in the last newsletter of the passing of Frank Donovan at the age of 99 years. I remember Frank fondly as my mentor when he was Area manager at Moonee Ponds Area. I was his Senior Advance Officer at the time and Frank taught me many tricks of the trade in gaining good business opportunities, many of which I used when I went on to become a manager in my own right. Vale Frank Donovan. “\n\nJONES ERWIN\n\nGordon Christensen emailed “Sad to read that my old mate Erwin Jones had passed away.\n\nErwin and I sat together for our last two years at Foster High School 1951/52.\n\nWe both started work with the bank in early 1953, Erwin at Welshpool and me at Foster branches.\n\nWe have kept in touch over the years, and we had spoken about arranging to meet up during last year, but because of our ages and health it unfortunately did not happen.\n\nALLSOP R.J. (RAY) 86 YEARS 04/02/2022\n\nAnn Allsop emailed “It is with great sadness that I have to tell you that my beautiful husband of 61 years died on the 4th of February and his funeral was on the 9th. As you can imagine our family are very sad but grateful for the life of Ray and the love he has always shown us. “\n\nAnn mentioned later that Ray played around 230 games of football for the old ES&A team and often with his great mate and colleague. the late Trevor Cookson. Ann said that the Allsop and Cookson families were very close friends and socialised together often. Many members would remember Ray.\n\nCOOKSON T.W.

(Trevor) Cookson aged 90 (almost 91) on 14/12/2021\n\n“I wish to advise that my darling husband, Trevor Cookson, of nearly 67 years passed away peacefully last Tuesday 14th December at 3.40.p.m. in his home. surrounded by his family and ‘round the clock’ beautiful care which had been ongoing for some months. He would have been 91 today, the 17th.He met every challenge happily and without complaint. Trevor's devotion, love and care for his family was unwavering.”\n\nLindsay Baglin was saddened to hear of Trevor’s passing as he worked with Trevor and found him to be a good friend and colleague. Lindsay said the Trevor was a very good cricketer playing for the Essendon District team. RIP Trevor.\n\nFLORENT S.J. P (SERGE) 82 YEARS 7/02/2022\n\nSerge McIntyre phoned to advise the passing of his brother-in-law Serge Florent, Honorary ANZROC member, aged 82 years on 7/02/2022 in Morningside QLD after battling cancer.

During these two years he had married Joan (now deceased) and on the 4/02/1943 he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force discharging in December 1945 with the rank of Leading Aircraftman, Headquarters North Command.\n\nIan would have had many stories to tell.\n\nTAYLOR J.C.

(John) Taylor of his passing aged 85 years on 28/01/2022.\n\nOn behalf of members, we extended condolences to the families and friends of Ray, Trevor, Serge, Ian and John.\n\nMaria Natoli emailed “Dorothy Bailey's family has asked me to let ANZROC members know that Dorothy Bailey passed away at home on Saturday, 8 January after a battle with cancer. Dorothy never really recovered from the shock of Will passing away so quickly and unexpectedly. As per Dorothy's wishes, a private family funeral will be held in a small chapel on Monday, 17 January.\n\nDorothy and I regularly kept in touch. She told me that when Will passed, she was overwhelmed with the number of letters, cards, messages, and flowers she received from Will's bank friends. Many times, she tried to respond, but the task was too daunting and upsetting for her. I know that Dorothy was very grateful for the thoughtfulness that she and her family received at that time.”\n\nRay Galliott, Secretary of ANZROC WA advised of the passing of Bill Gregory on 8th January in Victoria after a long battle against cancer. Bill attended an ANZROC luncheon when he last visited Perth and Ray spoke with him late last year and they shared a few laughs.\n\nJohn Brown advised that Bill worked in IT at EMANZA in the early computer years, John thought he originally came from Perth. His name comes up a few times in the Jeff Pitt IT history articles in our ANZROC Vic archives.\n\nJeff Pitt emailed “Bill was a very knowledgeable contributor to the series of stories I compiled on the History of ANZ Computers, and then the various \"EMANZA\" State Data Centres. From his background in WA, and then postings in Branch Liaison in both Melb and Sydney he had a vast knowledge of the people and events which shaped that part of ANZ as it is today. I knew him from many contacts on project implementations thru the 1970's and later. He was a much-respected manager of teams and of people generally. His approach was always professional and cooperative, and he had the full confidence of his leaders.\n\nEamon Veaney advised Bill wrote a history of ANZ EDP for us in 2020 and the link is: https://www.anzroc.com.au/images/stories/pdf/billgregorymemoir.pdf\n\nBill was not an ANZROC Vic Member but was well known during his time at Emanza to many in Victoria. He had also contributed the amazingly detailed article to our IT stories, and he must have had a photographic memory.\n\nOur condolences are extended to the Bailey and Gregory families.\n\nFURTHER TRIBUTES FOR PAST MEMBERS\n\nSTAMPS R. J. (Bob) 71 years 6/12/2021\n\nGary Mason emailed “Sad to learn of Bob Stamps' passing. He was a good person to be around.”\n\nKevin Mitchell (Life member, Past President and long-term committee member of ANZROC) phoning from Tasmania said how sorry he was to read of Bob’s passing. Bob had given great support to the ANZ Staff Club when Kevin was involved. Bob was always a reliable and hardworking colleague and always friendly with staff club members and committee. Will be missed. RIP Bob.\n\nStamps R.J. (Bob) 71 years 6/12/2021\n\nJohn Inglis emailed “Bob enjoyed many years of service with the ANZ, where he was also a staff club committeeman. He was a very good sportsman playing cricket for the MCC in one of their sides. After his time in the Bank, he worked in local government until his retirement. He also spent over 30 years as Greensborough RSL's Social Club president. His service to the RSL was recognised with a Hall of Fame award from ANZAC house, being one of very few non-service personnel to be honoured in that way. Vale Bob.”\n\nAlan Lauder emailed” In the late 60’s I was a shift supervisor at the Emanza Centre in South Yarra, Bob was one of my assistants. He was a most likeable fellow, full of fun and well-liked by all of us on the floor, especially all of the ladies on the machines. Sorry to hear that he has passed away, especially at such a young age in these times.”\n\nKen Parry emailed “Very sad day for all that knew him. Fantastic man was Bob, excellent sportsman and I had many an enjoyable day on the park playing cricket with him. Great competitor and teammate. Condolences to the family.”\n\nCAMPBELL M.G.

Mal Campbell was a very good friend of mine, in his position as an ESANDA Investment Manager he arranged for Cheltenham Golf Club to become an agent for ESANDA Debenture Investments with excellent results for both parties. Many other Clubs also became agents. Mal would regularly pay the Golf Club a visit on a Friday always coinciding with the then famous Friday BBQ. Many ANZ and ESANDA staff members would also attend the BBQ. This was very convenient for Mal as he would not only have an Agent’s\n\nvisit, but he also caught up with Various ANZ Staff from Cheltenham Area Centre and surrounding Branch staff.\n\nPart of the entry for the BBQ was a small fee to cover the food but it was also for a small raffle e.g., Bottle of wine, Frozen Chook, or a couple of pots, on one visit Mal won a frozen chook and was very excited about his win, unfortunately Mal left without taking his HIGHLY VALUED PRIZE” THE FROZEN CHOOK” home with him. Alas, the BBQ’S ceased, and caterers were hired before Mal could pick up his prize and he would remind me and others at our ANZROC Christmas lunches every year of the missing FROZEN CHOOK always with a good laugh. He never got his FROZEN CHOOK.\n\nRIP My Friend.”\n\nThere are several more tributes on our Facebook page.\n\nDAVIS R. L. (Leigh) 75 years 3/10/2021\n\nMike Devlin emailed “Leigh Davis's wife Sandra advised that Leigh passed away yesterday.

L. (PIERRE) 75 YEARS AUGUST 2020\n\nDanielle Reilly emailed “My father Pierre actually passed away in August last year after a battle with cancer.

(PETER) 84 YEARS 2/08/2021\n\nGillian Welch, widow of our Honorary Member Peter, advised of his passing on 2/08/2021. I worked with Peter in ESANDA in the 80’s and 90’s and he was a likeable character who will be missed.\n\nOur condolences are extended to the Campbell, Davis, Farhat and Welch families…...\n\nAthol Watkins telephoned to advise me that sadly his wife Barbara Watkins passed away on 3/10/2021 and he said that as they had moved around Victoria to many branches in his career (about 16 moves) with ANZ, Barbara would be known to many ANZ families.\n\nOur condolences are extended to Athol and his family and friends.\n\nCLEZY M.B.E. J.J.A. (JUSTIN) 85 YEARS 26/08/2021\n\nThe family tribute in the Age “A humble warm and humorous gentleman who is at peace after a long illness. Sadly missed.”\n\nOur condolences are extended to Judy and the Clezy family.\n\nBarry Kennedy emailed “I note that Justin passed away 26/08/21 aged 85 – I first met Justin when I was transferred to 55 Gracechurch St London branch of ES& A Bank. Justin’s father was the General Manager of ES&A Bank in UK but had retired prior to my working days in London.\n\nJustin was a great source of knowledge to all of the ‘expats’ who arrived ‘bushy eyed’ from Australia and I must say was very helpful to me at that time – we enjoyed our mutual friendship and experiences during my time in UK.\n\nJustin returned to Australia a number of years after my return to Melbourne and had a number of Management positions mainly around the city branches.”\n\nKay and Wayne Bevan emailed “Wayne and I met at 19 Swanston Street Branch when Justin was the Senior Manager. Wayne was the accountant, and I was one of the lending clerks working upstairs with Justin. We have very fond memories of these days and we both had a very close working relationship with Justin. He was like a father figure to me, and we had many good times working together. We had some interesting times there with Justin as he was ever the “entrepreneur”. I have very clear memories of him promoting the business of the customers. We had a window display of models wearing the swimwear from a customer of the rag trade which was a huge client base in those days. We even had John Blackman visit with a cow present in the office…….yes….. a real cow. Not sure what we were promoting, although it was possibly to increase the customer base of ANZ.\n\nWayne and I began our relationship at this office to eventually marry and we had Justin and Judy at our wedding. We thought we had kept this relationship under wraps from the other staff and we had done so, but not from Justin. He had somehow worked it out but played along like he did not know and would make cryptic comments which was very off putting but he loved stirring.\n\nWe also had a customer who had a French Patisserie and Justin would purchase croissants for the staff (there were a lot of us) on a regular basis for us to have for morning tea. Justin was a true gentleman, very kind and generous and will be sadly missed. Wayne and I pass on our condolences to Judy.”\n\nDuring the month we received notice of several ex ANZ Staff known to ANZROC members who have passed away in August and our condolences are extended to their families and friends.\n\nDICK MENTING passed away on 26/08/2021 aged 74…...past ANZ colleague known to many ANZROC members\n\nEamon Veaney emailed “Sadly, I received advice from Richard Harding and Andrew Kelly to say that Dick Menting passed away at Epworth. He had been in poor health for some time but it's still a shock to hear that news. The family tribute in the AGE recorded “Dick Menting will be remembered for his significant contributions to the community, Well done Dick”\n\nGeoff Archer emailed” Dick Menting died in Epworth Hospital, Richmond, which is where he was when I last spoke with him. He was having tests regarding the spread of cancer and was not expecting good news. I will always remember Dick as a genuine, determined, and proud man, who was great company. He gave back to the community in spades, including being a Councillor for the City of Boroondara and Camberwell Grammar School Council and as chairman of the local Bendigo Community Banks (after he left ANZ of course!).\n\nI worked adjacent to him in ANZ’s Strategic & Financial Planning Group in the 1990s when ANZ had numerous superfluous non-operating subsidiaries. David Craig, who I think was CFO at the time, set Dick a target of winding-up 100 of these, all within one year, and to Dick’s frustration he (only) got 99 of them. I sincerely hope ANZ paid him the bonus applicable to him as if he had reached the 100\n\ntarget.”\n\nRod Rowe emailed “I’ve just seen a post from a local sporting club advising that former ANZ member Dick Menting has passed away.\n\nI first met Dick back in the early 70s when he did a Migrant Shipboard Agency with me from Fremantle to Sydney, because we were anticipating that Dutch migrants were likely to be aboard, and Dick was of Dutch origin.\n\nHe was in a department in GMO as I think it was in those days (it may have been Economics or some such).\n\nI caught up with him again many years later, possibly 30 or more, in his role as Chairman of our local Community Bank in Surrey Hills, a role which I believe he still held up until his death.

Douglas Diger-Didoris Hancock\n\nVale Barrie Tony Langone\n\nMy condolences to Barrie's family - a true gentleman and always made the time to speak to anyone in the Bank no matter what rank. My prayers and thoughts are with the family at this time. Graeme Riley\n\nI remember Barrie well from my early days in the bank in the late 70’s in Controllers Dept (it may not have been called that at the time). He was a funny bloke with a unique personality and always dressed well. Condolences to the family. Mark Ryan\n\nSo sad to hear this news. He was great to work for and always had a story. RIP Gibbo\n\nFURTHER TRIBUTES FOR GERRY MCPHERSON\n\nBob Lyon emailed “I was saddened to hear that Gerry McPherson had passed away. I knew that he had broken his leg and was not well. I worked with Gerry and Fay in GHQ for a few years, and we were all members at Croydon Golf Club where Gerry and I think Fay were Life Members.\n\nGerry had a fantastic life in many respects. We all know about his wartime service in the RAF, but he was also a very good cricketer with Essendon.\n\nI remember when the Bank had a managerial dining room at 55 Collins Street. Gerry and Harry Kerwin used to have lunch there every Friday and I recall Gerry impressing Harry one day when he fronted up with a bottle of Penfolds Grange which they quaffed over lunch. Sincere condolences to Fay.”\n\nDennis Murphy emailed “Deeply regret the passing of Gerry.\n\nOn transferring from Royal Exchange branch Sydney to Flinders Way branch in September 1954 (following on from my father’s transfer (J.D.M.) was my first meeting with Gerry.\n\nJack Davis, Manager, Ian Walton, Accountant and Gerry was the Bill Clerk. After Mr. Walton asked what work I had been doing in Sydney (in Bill Dept) I was allotted to Gerry as his assistant. He was an excellent and patient tutor. He had beautiful handwriting and could accurately add lengthy money columns in seconds!! Over the years we had numerous recollections of our days in the branch. Especially our endeavours of downing beers before rushing to catch the earliest train home after 6.00pm hotel closing time following our sessions at the Port Phillip hotel across from the branch. Vale Gerry “\n\nJoan Nathan emailed “Such a sad sad day, Gerry gave so much over his lifetime.\n\nHis Military efforts during his Airforce career during the Second World War has given us the freedom we have today. ANZROC has certainly been enriched by the work Gerry has given as treasurer over such a long period of time.\n\nGerry would have been a wonderful work colleague, he touched so many lives, and I certainly feel blessed to have known him. Fay has been right by his side, a real tower of strength. Deepest Sympathy to Fay and family”.\n\nGARDINER WILLIAM R.(BILL) 90 YEARS 05/08/2021\n\nMargaret Gardiner, wife of our respected Honorary Member Bill, advised us of his passing on 5th August 2021 at the age of 90. Bill retired from ANZ as Relief Manager at Rosebud and has lived on the Mornington Peninsula from retirement.\n\nDaughter Moya emailed “His early career was in the city for a stint, I believe he spoke of Royal Bank Branch, and there was mention of sometime in Port Fairy. Bill married Margaret in ’69 while working at the Yarram branch, then in the 70’s Bill was Manager of Pakenham where he started his family . Another move as Manager Foster for a few years (where he employed the services of a\n\ngoat to maintain the banks back yard) and he then requested a sea-change. He was stationed at Rosebud from 1979 for quite a few years, I can’t remember if he was Manager of Mornington or relieved there quite a bit, he retired in the role of Relief Manager.\n\nFour out of five in the family worked for ANZ at some point, Margaret was a courier, me in branch-land and the Mulgrave Call Centre, the youngest did a short stint in branch-land. I had one day where he was Relief Manager in the same branch that I worked – Mornington. I remember that I needed to refer a matter to ‘the manager’ and couldn’t think of how to gain his attention, I’d only ever called him ‘Dad’ and that was obviously not appropriate, it was an awkward interruption.\n\nAfter Bill retired from the bank he and Margaret (his wife of 52 years) ran the Rosebud General Store for about 14 years, after retiring from there they enjoyed several Grey Nomad style laps around Australia and eventually settled on annual road trips to Harvey Bay spending their Winters’ with idyllic beach frontage in their caravan. Lawn Bowls was his specialty, he could frequently be found at the Rosebud Country Club over more than 40 years, he competed often and was a proud Club Champion and winner of the RSL Edinburgh Shield.”\n\nOur condolences were extended to Margaret, Moya and their family.\n\nMCPHERSON GERALD M (GERRY) 96 YEARS 27/07/2021\n\nPresident Ken Crawford emailed\n\n“Gerry was born on 14 November 1924 in Horsham, Victoria.\n\nHe had 44 years of service with the ANZ.\n\nHe enlisted on 29 January 1943 and embarked for England on 17 November 1943.\n\nDuring the war (WW2) he was a rear gunner attached to Lancaster Bomber group, RAF Squadron #186, #5 Group flying out of Stradishal, Suffolk UK.\n\nHe was the recipient of France’s “Legion of Honour” in 2015.\n\nVal Goldsworthy (ANZROC member) once ask Gerry about the Cathedral in Cologne (Germany) as it was not damaged during the war and Gerry advised that the Cathedral was a checkpoint for Navigators so it’s preservation was essential for Navigators for air raid directions.\n\nGerry (and wife Fay) was on the Odd Bods committee (an associated RSL group) for several years.\n\nGerry was Treasurer of ANZROC from 1984 to 2009, 25 years and was granted Life membership in 1995\n\nWe were fortunate to have him and Fay attend our ANZAC meeting last April where he gave a talk on his WW2 service and the content of which has been included in the past three newsletters.\n\nVale Gerry” https://www.anzroc.com.au/roc-notice-board/966-vale-gerry-mcpherson-respected-life-member-of-anzroc-victoria\n\nJohn Brown emailed “\"Gerry was elected to the ANZROC (Vic) committee, and in 1984 he took on the role of Treasurer, a position he held for 25 years, an enormous commitment.\n\nDuring his time as Treasurer, member details were recorded on around 800 individual hand-written cards that also contained records of annual subscription payments. The cards were held in alphabetical order in about 10 binders.\n\nIn those days, member subscription payments were made either by cheque or cash - no electronic payments - and financial records were meticulously handwritten by Gerry into a journal for reconciliation with the bank statements each month. As you can imagine, this was a very time-consuming job, and I am sure that Fay would have assisted Gerry during the busy times.\n\nGerry enjoyed his time as Treasurer, but he was happy to hand over the role in 2010 when it was decided to transfer the records and financial accounting to the computerised MYOB system.\"\n\nReny Frighetto emailed “Very sad to hear the passing of this true legend”.\n\nCon La Fauci emailed “Very sad he did so much for our club.”\n\nJohn Hudgson emailed “This is very sad news he will be sadly missed at our functions.

Vale Gerry.”\n\nKen Parry emailed “Very sad day , Gerry was a gentle man who served the Bank , his country and ANZROC with distinction. He will be sadly missed. My sympathy and love to Faye and family at this very sad time.”\n\nDick Sanders emailed “Gerry will be remembered by many over a long and dedicated Service.\n\nI recall Gerry being appointed the first Manager of Blackburn Branch as I was working with Bob Bennett and as Gerry and Fay lived close to Box Hill Golf Club, I used to see him regularly in his back garden. My sympathy to Fay and the family,”\n\nBill Stevens emailed “ I first met Gerry when he was attached to the audit staff and conducting an audit at Ringwood branch in July 1965. During the audit period he was appointed Manager of the new to be opened Blackburn branch and asked me if I would be interested in the position of Account/Teller. The branch opened on the 25th of September 1965, 5 days prior to annual balance, staffed by Gerry, Evon Whalen/Ledgers and me.\n\nOur first major account was Victorian Printing Works (introduced by Bob Bennett who was then Manager of ANZ Stationery Department) which at that time was the printers of ANZ cheque books and other negotiable instruments.\n\nAt time of his appointment Gerry didn't have a driver's licence so I was required to drive him to appointments and for valuations after closing hours.\n\nGerry finally bought a car from Ethridge of Blackburn (then a Mitsubishi dealer) from a salesman he met at the Blackburn Hotel which was frequently visited as Gerry loved a beer.\n\nNow that Gerry had a car he had to learn how to drive, so that was the next challenge, teaching a very nervous Gerry how to drive, which we did just about every night after work for a few months until he got his licence.\n\nAfter I left Blackburn branch our friendship still remained and we played golf together at Croydon Golf Club for a couple of years. In latter years I would see him at the MCG Members at cricket test matches and we would have a chat.\n\nMany members of ANZROC may not know that Gerry played district cricket for Essendon Cricket Club and was an opening fast bowler, he told me many good, interesting, and funny stories about his cricketing career.\n\nGerry, you could say that you had a wonderful \"Innings\" and thanks for the great memories when we worked together.”\n\nTributes from our FACEBOOK Page : Michael Devlin\n\nVale Gerry, thank you for helping to make the world a better place.

We were fortunate to have Harry join us shortly thereafter as our Manager Methods.\n\nA major function of Methods at that time was the preparation for conversion to decimal currency. Under Harry’s guidance work was both productive and enjoyable which lead to the smooth change in banking.\n\nHis ability to positively communicate and encourage staff to pursue their goals whilst ensuring that he provided beneficial support was a major factor in the development of our careers. As was standard protocol in those times, Anne’s career was curtailed by our marriage.\n\nMy career involved travels beyond Victoria which necessarily limited contact with Harry but when we did meet up it was always time for a good laugh. My condolences are extended to Beryl and her family. Vale Harry.”\n\nKen Fitzgerald wrote “ Harold (Harry) Carrodus\n\nCondolences to Beryl and family from Ken Fitzgerald , ANZROC member and ex Bank of Australasia (Burnley) 1944 and more recently ANZ Nominees 1987. I am exactly 2 months older than Harry and always enjoyed reminiscing with him at the Christmas luncheon. Here is something from the past: in 1945 Harry and I on a number of occasions were taken out of our branches to work the day in the Armoured Escort Van delivering cash and coin from Head Office to and from the suburban branches under police escort. Quite an education seeing where our branches were and meeting their staff. A great memory.”\n\nFURTHER TRIBUTES TO THE LATE ROLY WEBSTER\n\nRoger Dupuy emailed “Roly Webster.\n\nI joined the Bank at Rochester where Roly was then Accountant/Teller.\n\nUnfortunately, our careers did not cross again but I remain thankful for Roly’s guidance in my formative banking year.\n\nRoly operated a cheerful and smooth operating office with a dash of dry humour. Work didn’t interfere with social activities ensuring that I was always early for football and cricket practice. Even on our busy Saturday mornings I would be permitted to leave prior to 11am on away game days.\n\nLack of air conditioning on the warmer summer days was compensated by Roly arranging for the proprietors of the adjacent business – “Ada and Elsie’s Pub”- to deliver to the branch after 3pm, complimentary coldies in silver tankards. Hotel brewed ginger beer for the junior.\n\nRevolver practice was conducted after dark which assisted containment of the local vermin – spotlight shooting of foxes and rabbits!\n\nYes, banking was a stress-free profession in those times.\n\nMy condolences are extended to Joan and her family. Vale Roly.”\n\nFURTHER TRIBUTES TO THE LATE DAVID VALENTINE\n\nGraham Taylor emailed “I know this is late, for which sincere apologies but having been out of touch for a number of years, I have only just learned that David died a couple of years ago. I led the team from Lloyds that sold NBNZ to ANZ and spent many weeks with David during the negotiations and completion of the deal. He was great fun to work with and I really did feel that, although the negotiations were tough, they were completely fair and undertaken in exactly the right, professional, spirit. Just thought I should record my appreciation of a true professional.”\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAndy Herd emailed “I received an email advising the death of Jeff Barnes on 22 July 2021 in Vancouver where he and family had emigrated many years ago .

John Brown emailed “Sad news, Harry was a great guy, a long-time supporter of ANZROC (Vic) and came to many of our lunches. He had a long career in ANZ Data Processing and Methods. Our condolences to Beryl and her family.”\n\nCommitteeman John Hudgson emailed “So sad to hear of Harry’s passing, he was a great friend and mentor to me. I reported to him whilst working on a lot of projects during my time in ANZ. A wonderful person who was always a gentleman, never had a bad word against anyone and always\n\nwilling to share his knowledge and advice. It was always a highlight for me to catch up and have a chat with Harry at our Christmas Lunches. He is sadly missed. Vale Harry.”\n\nLouis Hebrard emailed “Sad news. I never worked directly with Harry but attended a few project review meetings with him over many years. I liked his no nonsense approach and integrity. Very personable too.”\n\nJeff Pitt emailed “It is indeed sad news that Harry has passed away. Harry was a true gentleman banker, and a thorough professional in all that he did across a range of fields of banking.\n\nI first encountered Harry in his Senior Management role in Methods Dept at South Yarra. He and his team were always extremely constructive and supportive in a number of IT projects we worked on together. Probably the most notable was the computerisation of branch Term Deposits in the early 1980's where all the bank ledgers for these deposits were written up by hand in large bound folders. Harry and his process management team took to the task of helping to get the Australia-wide network of branches organised to have all these records transferred to computer and then to have the State and AHQ administrative areas responsible for the overall management of this important sector of deposits.\n\nI also worked with Harry on a pains-taking and laborious job after a major organisational upheaval in 1980's where we were tasked with producing a definitive schedule of administrative authorities and discretions for each of the respective levels of the newly created structure. I was continuously impressed with Harry's unwavering persistence and inexhaustible patience as we struggled to create a document of many columns/pages by hand (no big spreadsheets in those days!). I seem to recall that we achieved the finalisation of this task and presentation to the CEO and management committee just before the next major re-organisation occurred! Fortunately, Harry and I had both moved on by then and some-one else had to work out how to update it.\n\nWhile Harry performed many special projects for the CEO and top management, I recall one particular task that gave him immense pride and satisfaction. ANZ Bank was nominated as the Official Banker for the 1986 Pope's Visit to Australia and Will Bailey asked Harry to act as the bank's representative on the organising committee. This secondment took the large part of a year as I recall, and Harry committed himself to it whole-heartedly. He had a fund of stories from this secondment but was always 100% discreet in what he shared to others. Harry was immensely proud of his part in this high-profile tour by the Pope.\n\nOf course, Harry was also a very popular retired officer; always with a cheery smile and a warm greeting for everyone. Good on you Harry”\n\nEamon Veaney emailed” He was a lovely person. That is so sad. He was a great friend of Dick Milnthorpe “.\n\nTributes posted on Facebook were: Vivienne Smith\n\nFond memories of a friendly and fair man during our time together at Bankcard AHQ.

From there we formed a friendship and we decided to join the ANZ football team the same year.\n\nHosie`s hotel was a regular place to have a quick lunch, and the Black Cat Café for a not so quick morning tea. Late 1958 I was transferred to Moonee Ponds branch and over time I lost contact with Geoff.\n\nHe spent many years in the country. Towards the end of the 90`s I relieved one of the Managers at 55 Collins Street and again met up with Geoff who was in charge of the Tellers. We were able to have a few lunches together whilst I was at that branch.\n\nOn retirement in 1995 and after joining Anzroc, I attended my first Annual Xmas Function and met up with Geoff and Lesley.

The branch was full of wonderful people from the top down who ensured it was a happy place to work, and dare I say, enjoy the odd beer or three after working very hard of course!. Clive or 'Mr. never better 'as I see others have mentioned truly epitomised the branch culture. Clive never forgot a staff members birthday to which I can attest, and this followed through long after being transferred. If a staff member or a member of their family was sick Clive was always quick to enquire and offer assistance. To arrive at work and bump into Clive with his huge smile never failed to get the day started on the right note.\n\nOn a more personal note, early on Clive invited Joan, me and our two children to their Mooroolbark home to meet Margaret and their children and to see how to operate a barbecue and drink Aussie beer! Not bad since he was also a POM! That one event has always remained in the minds of Joan and me!\n\nWhatever success I may have had in my career with ANZ, and later Esanda was due in large part to the encouragement of Clive and putting my name forward when an opportunity arose for which he thought I was suited.\n\nLater on, when Clive was an Area Manager, and I was with Esanda we used to meet often, and the encouragement never ceased. His enthusiasm was infectious.\n\nMy biggest regret is in recent years I did not kept in touch as I should have, and this is something I will have to live with!\n\nTo Margaret and her family, Joan and myself send our deep condolences on their sad loss.\n\n'Mr. Never Better 'rest in Peace´.\n\nMore Facebook postings Diane Carew\n\nI was so sad to hear of Clive’s passing.

Noel was moved at the service by the anecdotes and family tributes that reflected the distinctive nature of Clive.\n\nPast President Kevin Mitchell emailed. “I was saddened to hear that Clive Bayley had passed away; he was one of the good guys. If you asked Clive how he was, the answer was always the same - “Never Better”.\n\nDuring my term as Secretary/Manager of the ANZ Staff Social Club, Clive was elected as President for three years 1989/90/91. During this time, we developed a close working relationship and became good friends. I always greeted him as Sir Clive, and in response he would greet me as Sir Clip. He had a great sense of humour and a quick wit.\n\nAt each of the annual Staff Club Balls during his Presidency, after his welcome speech and with a glass of red wine in hand, he would ask all the males in in the room to be upstanding to drink a toast to their beautiful partners.\n\nClive was a great supporter of the Staff Club, and in retirement the Retired Officers’ Club, attending many of the lunch meetings and events. Vale Clive, you will be missed by your many friends.\n\nGlen Fullerton emailed “ Clive was an Area Manager in WA for a short time (sometime between 1979 and 1981) before he returned to ANZ in Victoria. I often ran into him at the ANZROC Vic Christmas parties.”\n\nDoug Ramsay emailed “ I have put down a few lines about Clive and also included a copy of a poem I wrote about him when he retired in 1992. The thoughts expressed in that poem I believe are a reflection of who Clive was. I first met Clive when the former Moonee Ponds, Footscray and Preston Areas were merged into the newly created Melbourne North West Zone around 1990/91. Clive was\n\nappointed Senior Manager – Sales and Services as manager of the zone network (excluding lending services) and my first impression of him was of a very dapper, friendly man with an engaging personality – this impression never changed and I came to regard him as one of nature’s gentlemen. In those days he was a great advocate for the annual “Wagga Wagga Weekend” held over the long weekend in June at Wagga in NSW. It was a huge event during which teams from Victoria and NSW competed against each other in such sports as golf, tennis, running, tenpin bowling etc. More importantly, it was a great opportunity for the ANZ Bank fraternity to get together to have fun and strengthen friendships. Clive convinced me to participate, which I did even after I retired in early 1996, but sadly the event ceased soon thereafter following major Bank restructures. And so, we say goodbye to Clive Bayley, a true “ peoples” person, a rarity in today’s world.\n\nODE TO “NEVER BETTER”\n\nNow all have heard of the “Silver Bodgie”\n\nour ex-PM who could be dodgy\n\nnot to be confused with our “Dapper Clive”\n\nwho was seldom known to take a dive.\n\nIt is common custom most every day\n\nas we meet people along the way\n\nto say ”G ’day” or “How are you”\n\nmost respond ”Very well” without much ado.\n\nBut not our Clive, he always said\n\n(even when his face was red)\n\n“Never Better” in that deep voice\n\nto smile back you had no choice.\n\nClive, knowing you has been a pleasure\n\nthe good times we had we’ll always treasure\n\nfor the Bank and staff, you’ve done your duty\n\nthe time has come to collect the booty.\n\nAnd so, my friend we bid farewell\n\nbut on our parting we will not dwell\n\nexcept to say without a letter\n\nto both you and Margaret “Never Better” Doug Ramsay 1992\n\nTRIBUTES TO CLIVE BAYLEY POSTED ON OUR FACEBOOK PAGE John Aust\n\nSo sad to hear that we have lost Clive....he was extremely supportive and encouraging to me in my first management role when he was Area Manager Camberwell back in the late 80’s.\n\nHis air of positivity was infectious....the words “never better” were his response to how he felt and dealt with matters....they remain a permanent memory to me of Clive.....RIP. My thoughts are with Margaret and family.. Sandra Bellmaine\n\nSo sad he was a lovely man. Employed me at Camberwell area as receptionist and promoted me quickly to promotions manager. As I showed him things he would always say \"now what do we have here?\". A lovely lovely man. RIP Clive\n\nKerry Buckley\n\nVale Clive. He was Bossy and I was Flossy when I was his lending assistant @ ANZ Croydon in the 80s. Famous for his saying \"Never Better\" He and Margaret were like our second parents. He will be sadly missed Imelda David Christie\n\nRIP. Cheryl Cottle\n\nVery sorry to hear. Clive was a lovely man Debra Emmett\n\nSuch a lovely man. I worked with Clive at ANZ Croydon in Vic back in the 80’s. It was an absolute pleasure to work with him. Clive you will be sadly missed. Such a gentleman. Thank you Clive Wolfgang Frank\n\nVale Clive. A real gentleman and also character. Had pleasure working with Clive at 388 CSM, where he was a lending Manager on 1st floor. Mary Lewis\n\nAn absolute gentleman. Always there as a very supportive Senior Manager. Had a lot of laughs. A pleasure to work for. Rest in Peace Mr. Bayley - always to me Mr. Bayley! Mandy Rashleigh\n\nSo sad to hear of Clive’s passing. He was a true gentleman and a great leader. RIP Clive - condolences to his family.\n\nOur condolences are extended to Margaret and her family and friends\n\nBELL ROBERT G (BOB) 12/01/2021 73 YEARS\n\nEamon Veaney attended the funeral service for Bob Bell and emailed in this report “Bob was given a moving send off by family and friends at Wattle Park Chalet this afternoon.

Bob spent the majority of his ANZ career involved in the Foreign Exchange markets. He joined the International Banking Division (IBD) in 1970, in Melbourne, before transferring to London in 1974 to further his FX dealing capabilities. After another period in Melbourne, Bob, Joyce and family moved to Singapore where he ran the FX operation for five years. Upon returning to Melbourne Bob was appointed Senior Manager FX where he was responsible for the FX operation in Australia reporting to me.\n\nBob was President of the Australian Forex Association for five years and much involved in arranging the annual worldwide ACI Congress, which was held in Australia, for the first time, in 1992. Over the past 35 years, Bob was a regular member of the annual IBD golf trip to the Murray and a past winner of the prestigious Hastie Trophy. Bob had lots of friends at ANZ. He was a truly great guy who will be sorely missed. “\n\nRichard Harding emailed “Sad news”\n\nBob Forsyth emailing from USA “One of the greats. Rest in Peace Robert. Condolences to Joyce”\n\nGeoff MacFarlane emailed “What a sad time.

He was straight up and down and what you saw was what you got. He had a strong set of values where fairness and doing the right thing ranked highly in Jim’s world. There were no short cuts and his understanding of the Banks balance sheet and financial details were second to none, reflecting his long stint as Financial Controller for the Group.\n\nI remember when the Trustee Executors Agency Company joined the ANZ Group and Jim was asked to attend a diner at Raheen given by the late Richard Pratt to recognise the work of Father Kiss who would now be joining ANZ. During the dinner Richard Pratt asked each of the guests to say a few words in support of Father Kiss. Knowing that Jim had considerable misgivings about Father Kiss, (which latter proved to be well founded) I asked him how he handled his turn to speak. He replied that as he did not know Father Kiss it was enlightening to hear the favourable words of those who had spoken, and he promptly sat down.\n\nWhen Jim retired I asked him to come to New Zealand and lead a review of UDC our finance arm. This he did with great distinction and he and Hilda enjoyed a return to their home land and a chance to catch up with many of their friends from the time he started his banking career. In the final analysis Jim’s sense of humour and love for his family is an enduring memory of my time working alongside him. A true gentleman banker.”\n\nOn behalf of ANZROC members our condolences are extended to Hilda and her family and friends,\n\nWe were advised recently that Les Stevens, husband of our member Lyn\n\nStevens had passed away. Les was 89 years of age.\n\nMany members would remember Lyn and Les from the time when Lyn was on\n\nthe Staff Club committee and Les accompanied her to many events run by\n\nthe Staff Club. Les not only attended events, but was a willing worker\n\nand always ready to help with whatever needed to be done. Les was\n\nregarded by all as 'part of the team', and he will be sadly missed by\n\nall his friends.\n\nWe extend our condolences to Lyn.\n\nBRIANT A.S. (ALAN) 88 YEARS 5/09/2020\n\nPeter Briant, son of our Respected Honorary member Alan Briant emailed “I wish to advise with deep sorrow that my father Alan Briant passed away on 5th September 2020 after a short illness. He unfortunately succumbed to the COVID 19 virus in the aged care facility he had only recently moved into with his wife of 62 years, Ruth. Alan was an Honorary member of the ANZ Retired Officers Club which I recall he was looking forward to enjoying the celebrations of the ANZ/ES&A merger 50th Anniversary.\n\nAlan had worked with ES&A/ANZ in Tasmania, from the age of 16, starting as a Clerk then onto Bank Teller. He worked his way around Tasmania serving in Wynyard, Oatlands, New Norfolk, Moonah and then finally in Hobart where he became an Auditor. Alan retired around 1992. My parents moved to Victoria in 2002, residing in Bairnsdale where they enjoyed many years there till “old age” brought them to Melbourne, to be closer to family.\n\nAlan fondly told us how he enjoyed receiving the monthly ANZROC (Vic) newsletters and wished he was able to attend one of your lunches when he moved to Melbourne.\n\nPlease pass this email onto all the members of ANZROC.”\n\nOur condolences were extended to son Peter and widow Ruth and family on the passing of our Honorary member Alan Briant.\n\nMILNTHORPE R.H.(DICK) 88 YEARS 30/10/2020\n\nSad news from UK of the passing of our Respected Honorary Member Dick Milnthorpe on 30/10/2020 at the age of 88 years….\n\nDick was a prolific contributor to our ANZROC Newsletter and the initiator of the recent articles about the development of the computerisation of ANZ …\n\nEamon Veaney emailed this tribute “Sadly, I received a call from Pat Milnthorpe this morning to say that Dick passed away peacefully at home yesterday after being diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer in September. Dick had recently celebrated his 88th birthday.\n\nWe managed to complete Dick's story of his career in IT at ANZ earlier this month.\n\nBelow is a link to the story. https://www.anzroc.com.au/ima…/stories/…/londonithistory.pdf\n\nDick made an enormous contribution to the growth of Technology at ANZ and will be missed.\n\nI was very fortunate to accompany Dick to the USA in 1976/77 to set up the offices in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nThe message below was received from Dick one week ago and shows that he kept his sense of humour to the end\n\n''Just to say thanks to you all who have written, I see Bob(Wheeler) sees us meeting ‘down there’ and guess, he is probably right, we wouldn’t want to go to a place where none of our friends were, and Alan(Findlay) is probably running it now! (And giving Will (Bailey a hard time). Anyway, I’m comfortable, I’ve had a good run, and never broke the 11th Commandment! It was a privilege to work alongside you all. Yours with great affection, Dick.''\n\nOur deepest condolences are sent to Pat and her family.”\n\nWarren Taylor emailed “ I had the privilege and honour of not only knowing Dick Milnthorpe but also working with him (New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and London ) and then out of the office, sailing with him on Long Island Sound, and the Solent; in the off season in London preparing his yacht for the coming season. He was a master sailor.\n\nI first met Dick in London in 1969 on the completion of a Shipboard Agency (SS) Canberra) spending 10 days in London Office attached to International Department, before flying home.\n\nOur next encounter was early January 1976 when Dick, then Manager IT London and his 2 I C Bruce Plaice- Leary was sent over by Mr. Pinks at the request of John Holberton General Manager International Division to determine within two weeks a computer system (both hardware and software) for the new Banking Agency being established in New York.\n\nAt that time, I was the assistant Representative for North America.\n\nMy role, as directed by John Holberton, was to immediately make contact with Dick Milnthorpe and assist him in every way possible for the matter was urgent, organise a visiting programme, make appointments with parties he wished to speak with and advise him of the projected product and services to be provided by the new agency, together with likely volumes of business.\n\nAfter the first week had concluded, Dick had made his decision before arrival in New York. The software system he was looking for had to be multi- currency and modular in design with broad parameters, operating on an IBM platform. His submission was masterfully crafted, for his vision was not just a system for New York Agency, but a group system, one that could be used anywhere in the world, whether it be in a regulated or deregulated market. Wheel it in, plug it in, tick the appropriate parameters and we are up and running were his visionary words.\n\nHis recommendation was MIDAS being developed by BIS a UK company, operating on an IBM system 32 Platform\n\nWhen conveying to him the directive from Mac Brunckhorst (then CEO) to set up the most effective and efficient operation possible adopt world best practice, get the computer to do everything and forget how we do it in Australia, he simply smiled, for this was music to his ears. When questioning him “Can a computer do everything”, his simple answer was yes, if you give me the specifications and accounting entries. Still doubting him he added, although his chosen system Midas only had two modules (dealing and accounting ) consisting of only five general ledger accounts, the strength of his chosen software was its two features of being modular and with broad parameters, enabling modules to be added together with the appropriate general ledger accounts until it is a full commercial banking system. This was his visionary goal. Sensing I was still not convinced he proceeded to deliver a historical evolution of computerisation of being developed from the bottom up of simply computerising the biggest problem/volume first, stating within the banking industry it was cheque accounts first followed by savings account, then term deposits and then loan accounts resulting in many sub systems being added to produce the other essential information. Whereas, systems should have been developed from the Top down outlining that this visionary concept of capturing all of the elements at the outset to produce all information, reports, returns etc., required by external authorities and internally for headquarters and local management. Adding at the end of the month we should be able to go to the computer press a button and all internal and external reports would be produced automatically and data transmitted to the recipient. That was his visionary concept to which he committed himself to achieving.\n\nHe became more convinced his objective was achievable when informed of the USA compulsory accounting principles of accrual system of accounting for all interest and discount and the daily accounting of all contingent liabilities, neither of which existed in any ANZ operation.\n\nDick quickly appreciated the significance of these stipulations, as both would enable him to achieve his visionary concepts for returns and reports.\n\nInternally, this included the monthly return, half year and annual balance day returns, each of one page, were computer produced and data transmitted to GHQ at close of business on the required day for submission i.e. annual balance was a one a one-page report transmitted at 6 pm. New York time on 30 September.\n\nOne other convincing argument Dick advanced in support of his choice, was the unique client numbering system within Midas; it sold me.\n\nOver the years I found Dick to be a highly dedicated and committed officer.\n\nThroughout his career, his contributions were enormous. He was always seeking ways to improve operational processes based on his broad knowledge and experience of commercial banking practices, both domestic and international.\n\nHis visionary concept of developing MIDAS into a full commercial banking system was achieved in stages, with three new modules added in New York before opening day in June 1976, and a further four by annual balance day 30 September 1976, and finally accomplished during the restructuring of London Branch operations over 1980/82 when London’s computer operations were transferred from its existing system to MIDAS, requiring some new modules to be added to accommodate existing business practices, as well as from new products introduced from the restructuring processes. Thus, Dick’s visionary concept had been accomplished to his immense satisfaction. Thereafter, some further modules were added to accommodate the ever-evolving derivative products within the London Market. Finally, a Business Unit Accounting Module was then developed to satisfy the McKinsey recommendations.\n\nAt the conclusion of the London restructuring process, Mike Tong then Manager Foreign Exchange Dept London, suggested that with all the additional modules added by ANZ, the system should be renamed MIDANZ. Mike had been involved from the outset setting up the foreign exchange dealing activities in New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nDick was a remarkable man in fact a legend. A visionary extraordinaire. He was an outstanding\n\nconsiderate; blessed with a great sense of humour; he was an excellent raconteur.\n\nDick was highly respected by everyone he made contact with throughout his career which included Bill Ray, the Senior Partner of Brown Brothers Harriman and company. A that time Bill Ray was considered to be the doyen of Wall Street Bankers. Internally he earnt the total trust of the master banker Tom Williams.\n\nVale Dick”\n\nPat Milnthorpe, widow of Dick emailed “Thank you Eamon for all the kind messages from friends and colleagues from ANZ. Richard would have been so pleased that he was so well thought of. Will you give my thanks to everyone.”\n\nYORK B.R. (JOHN) 89 YEARS 22/10/2020\n\nNotice in the Age Newspaper 27/10/2020\n\n“YORK Bernard Roy\n\nSandra, Katherine, Peter and Richard honour the peaceful passing of Bernard on October 22nd in Kew.\n\nBorn in Northampton, England on 10th July 1931, he moved to New Zealand in 1955 and later Melbourne in 1971 to pursue a lifelong career in banking with the ANZ Bank.\n\nHis kindness, dignity, intellect and immense integrity will be eternally missed by all his family including Cameron, Michele, Siri, Nicholas and grand-children Caroline, James, Kirin, Archer and great granddaughter Arabella. Deeply missed and always in our hearts”\n\nOur condolences are extended to Sandra and the York family.\n\nPHILLIP ELLIS\n\nLouis Hebrard emailed “in case ANZROC has not been advised, Phillip (Phil) Ellis passed away last Friday the 16th, aged 77. I knew Phil in Retail Marketing in the late 80' and early 90's. I worked with him in Perth, when he was General Manager of Town & Country Bank, on a project to develop a strategy and plan to integrate their products and accounts into ANZ. We also worked together later, on a project with McCaughan Dyson to develop a margin lending product. After ANZ, he had a successful business doing financial planning and SMSF management. He had a jolly and direct character; we enjoyed the work we did together. Vale Phil.\n\nCharles Griss emailed “I was very sad to hear from a former close work colleague Paul McKernan (and nowadays my “LIFE WEALTH” Financial Planning Advisor-just retired), that Phil Ellis had died.\n\nPaul had rung me a few days earlier to let me know that Phil was in palliative care. Unfortunately, Phil’s condition deteriorated very rapidly, and I was unable to speak with him or indeed his wife Jane before he died.\n\nPhil suffered a very serious bout of cancer quite some years ago, but he was a fighter and true to form, got back on his feet and lived life to the fullest until relatively recently.\n\nI met Phil back in ANZ Controllers days when he came to ANZ from Philip Morris to head up the Cost Accounting Section of Controllers. I subsequently became his boss. Phil brought quite a different culture to the Bank as well as many ideas, business processes and policy initiatives and of course a lot of experience from a totally different industry. I think it is fair to say he held and implemented his ideas with conviction and was a catalyst for a number of improvements in ‘the way we did business’. Whilst he was demanding of his staff, he was also very loyal to and supportive of them, a quality which always stood out to me.\n\nFor well over 20 years we maintained regular contact through so called “Controller’s Lunches”, which were initiated by Dieter Telburn. Unfortunately, COVID 19 intervened this year, so to some extent the 8/10 of us who wined and dined 3/4 times a year have temporarily lost the contact we had with each other. Phil’s external persona was one he played to with much pleasure and some could not always see past that. As evidenced after his initial bout of serious illness, he remained positive in his outlook and enjoyed good company, friends, and much travel. We in the “Controllers Group” will miss him. Our thoughts are with Jane, whose loss, whilst perhaps not unexpected, is great and we send our condolences to her.\n\nVale Phillip. “\n\nBOAK R.A.(ALAN) 85 years 22/09/2020\n\nAlan’s passing was noted in the Age newspaper 23/09/2020. Alan was a regular contributor to our ANZROC newsletter, and our condolences are extended to his widow Diane and their family.\n\nKeith Witney emailed “Alan and I worked closely together on Economics Dept. ANZ Business Indicators’ when it was keenly awaited and much quoted by business media. Alan’s enjoyment of the English language caused him to sometimes include a not common word to see if it might ‘ get a run’. One that I recall was a great success was when he used “parlous” to describe the state of a part of the economy and subsequently and for some time it became part of the economic commentary landscape. Vale Alan.”\n\nCARR L.J. (LEN) 82 years 27/09/2020\n\nFiona Cranny, daughter of Len Carr advised of her father’s passing on 27/09/2020 aged 82 years after a short illness with late diagnosis of lung cancer. Fiona said that her father joined the bank in Bendigo followed by a journey around country Victoria that included terms in Bendigo, Ballarat, Pakenham, Mildura, Geelong and suburbs and on retirement Len had been manager Corio and finally Belmont in Geelong. Apart from his career in banking and caring for his family he had two passions in life. The first was his love of music and singing, performing in musical theatre and light opera in Bendigo and Geelong Light Opera groups. His second was the Belmont Bowls Club where after retirement he served in management and treasurer roles for more than 20 years.\n\nOur condolences were extended to Fiona, her mother Norma and the family.\n\nDE MORTON ROSS 75 years 19/09/2020\n\nANZROC member John Gawne emailed “A note to inform you that sadly my good friend and work colleague Ross de Morton passed away on 19/09/2020 in Horsham.\n\nRoss unfortunately suffered two severe strokes in recent weeks. He was Operations Manager Gippsland under the old Area Concept, Manager Kooweerup, Leongatha, Morwell, Lending Manager Gippsland and District Manager West Gippsland.\n\nComing from Essendon and a staunch supporter of the “Bombers” he also worked at Marnoo, Stawell and the launch of Bankcard. Ross and I in recent years spent grand final day together, sadly no more.”\n\nKim Charlton emailed “I knew Ross from earlier Gippsland days before I moved on in my career with the Bank and was branch manager (no business lending) at 91 William St, Melbourne. In 1992, Ross, in his capacity as District Manager West Gippsland, advertised the position of branch manager (including business lending with a CAD) at Koo Wee Rup. Although I had no experience in business lending I rang Ross to enquire whether lending experience was important should I decide to apply. Ross explained given my knowledge of the area and sport/community involvement over the years, plus a need to ‘mend some bridges’, my lack of business lending experience was ‘not a great concern and something that would be easily remedied’. After a couple of months in the job, I wondered if Ross’s opinion qualified for the ‘famous last words’ category. I soon realised Ross’s reputation for caring for and supporting his staff was well deserved. Even at his farewell dinner, he espoused the importance of supporting each other while giving honest feedback on how life can sometimes throw unkind curveballs. A champion all-round bloke. Vale. Ross.”\n\nOur condolences are extended to family and friends of Ross.\n\nHOSKIN Ms. J. M (June) HOSKIN 93 years 23/08/2020\n\nNephew Jeff Hoskin advised of his aunt, our Honorary Member June Hoskin’s passing on 23/08/2020. June worked with ANZ Group in a secretarial role for more than 40 years.\n\nJune was also a regular contributor to our ANZROC newsletter.\n\nBarbara Bruce emailed “I went on the ANZ Retired Officers' overseas tour in 1995 or 1996 and June was on the tour. Brian Christensen led the tour which was very enjoyable. “\n\nMaria Natoli emailed “I had some dealings with her when she was secretary to Stuart Brooke, when he was head of Marketing Department (this would have been in the 1980s, I think). As I recall, June was very quiet and reserved, but very diligent. I know that she enjoyed working for Stuart. “\n\nJohn Brown said that when he knew June she was secretary to Keith Witney, Chief Manager Marketing.\n\nCOLLINS W.T. (BILL) 83 YEARS 11/07/2020\n\nWe heard the sad news that Bill Collins passed away in July from his daughter Maree Tandon who was also a long term ANZ employee\n\nBill was mentioned in our recent articles on the birth of IT in ANZ as one of the pioneers. In 1964 Bill went on to lead the team which created the current accounts application. He then held a number of senior positions in the IT/DP area.\n\nMaree advised that Bill passed away on 11 July 2020, after a fall and a short illness and she emailed the following information although she said that from a date perspective it may not be entirely correct but is to the best of the family’s recollection!\n\n“Dad joined ANZ in his hometown of Chinchilla Queensland around 1954.\n\nDad took the opportunity of a secondment to New Guinea in the late 50’s, where he met Mum, Deanne, who was also on a secondment in New Guinea.\n\nMum and Dad married in 1961, and lived in Queensland, whilst Dad worked relieving in a number of country branches, like Kilkevan and Gympie. At this time, computers and computer programming became a passion for Dad, which continued right up and into his 80’s. The family moved to Melbourne, as ANZ started to set up their Data processing operations. Dad was part of the team that introduced Honeywell into ANZ working at the “state of the art” office at 227 Toorak Road. I remember the previous building, which I think was like a house, was it 145 Toorak Road?\n\nDad then worked in Communications for ANZ in the 80’s, and was also a Senior Manager in Credit Cards, working out of the newly refurbished Bryant and May Factory in Richmond.\n\nDad “retired” in the early ‘90’s, purchasing Edithvale Hardware and Lotto, where he and Mum worked until around 1997 when they properly retired.\n\nThey both enjoyed travelling, locally and overseas, and had a great number of friends who they loved to have over for a visit and much raucous laughter.\n\nDad’s health was always a concern, diagnosed with bowel cancer 20 years ago, he always bounced back and made the best of everything life threw at him.\n\nOur household was the proudest ANZ household around, our whole lives were entwined with all the ANZ milestones, Dad could not have been prouder to work anywhere else, and every milestone for ANZ was a celebration for us.\n\nEmbarrassingly, I remember when 55 Collins Street was in development, Collins Place, I naturally assumed it was named after Dad, and told all my friends so!!!\n\nDick Milnthorpe emailed “Very sorry to hear that Bill Collins has died, he was a leading light in the pre-1980 IT Dept. I arrived in March 1980 from UK and was very surprised that at that critical time it had been decided to transfer him to another area. The success of the former Honeywell Accounting system was in no small way due to Bill who had had a large part in its design and installation. They were portentous days, such a large and vital system is an extremely large and expensive investment by the Bank and the changeover from a Honeywell to an IBM based operation was somewhat like turning the proverbial oil tanker around, not to mention the expansion of IT into other areas of the Bank. Nevertheless, Bill continued to be successful in other areas where he was a convivial and popular leader. I will miss him.\n\nThe loss of Bill serves to emphasise the importance of the current “Memoirs” in preserving an important record of the Bank’s history.”\n\nBruce Plaice- Leary emailed “So sad to hear about Bill Collins a perfect gentleman and a great ANZ man. He was one of the people I met when I went to Australia for the first time. He greeted me as if he had known me all my life and I felt a great kindred spirit, larger than life, a true Aussie. Out for an evening with Bill and other members of the IT team, he said to me \" I hope you’re not one of those Poms who don't take their drink\", apparently on Dick's earlier visit he had been observed tipping a couple of drinks in the shrubbery and Dick had told me that and thought he got away with it! Much later when Derek Gall took over ENS, I took over Communications from Bill, and I think that included the Wang email system. He made it very easy for me introducing me to the staff and to the suppliers. Everything was in prime order as you would expect of Bill. He went on to run Cards Operations for Charles Carbonaro. Highly respected and liked by all he was truly a hard act to follow.”\n\nThe link to more articles relating to Bill’s time in ANZ is : https://www.anzroc.com.au/roc-notice-board/886-vale-bill-collins-respected-honorary-member-of-anzroc-victoria-passed-away-july-11-2020-aged-83\n\nOur condolences are extended to Maree and the Collins family and friends\n\nTAYLOR T.B.(THOMAS) 92 YEARS 12/06/2020\n\nLea Trafford daughter of ANZROC Honorary member Thomas Taylor of 13 Pioneer Street Foster advised her father had passed away on June 12th, 2020.\n\nTom had been ailing for a few years but especially since his beloved wife Deirdre passed in April 2019. Together, they had joined the community at Prom Country House for their final years together.\n\nPrior to that Tom had retired down to South Gippsland where he had run cattle with his father in law, on a farm at Waratah Bay/Fish Creek. Together, with a few other retired ANZ fellows and of course his wife Deirdre, he travelled extensively. Tom had a rich life and contributed to the lives of many.\n\nOur condolences are extended to Lea and the Taylor family and friends.\n\nFURTHER TRIBUTES FOR THE LATE WILLOUGHBY J (WILL) BAILEY\n\nTerry Earle emailed “One of the funny memories of my experience with Will was when we launched ANZ VISA Card. As was the practice, any new product launch required us to ensure the Executive Team were given priority. And so, it was with the Visa launch.\n\nWe had to manually intervene and produce cards for the Executives that were hand delivered in advance of the launch. This was achieved successfully. However, the manual intervention resulted in the cards being deemed expired – something to do with the expiry date that was altered. This only came to my attention after the launch.\n\nI received a hostile and angry call from Will on his return from New Zealand telling me that he had been chased down a street in Wellington after he had bought flowers for Dorothy on his new Visa card. It was rejected!!!!He shouted at me …… ‘I suppose thousands of our customers are affected by this mistake!!!!!!!” I responded… “No. Just the Executive team on the 14th and 15th Floors”. He just slammed the phone down and I didn’t hear any more about it. But there were many chuckles on the 14th and 15th floors, I was reliably informed. Their cards were replaced in 48 hours…………”\n\nRay Nicholson emailing from Adelaide “Geoff Pitt sent me the ANZROC August Newsletter with reference to the late Will Bailey. I worked under Will in NZ and later in Melbourne when I transferred into the Group Personnel area. Later I was SM HR Vic Admin before transferring to Adelaide. Then a move back to NZ as GM HR and following that back to Group HQ involved in the Grindlay’s group from an HR perspective. Contracting a bad cancer, I had to retire at age 58 in a\n\ntenuous situation but with lots of good medical interventions and support that passed, and now at 81 in a couple of weeks’ time, life is great. So, I found reading the ANZROC Newsletter most interesting bringing back names from former times.\n\nWe are watching the Victorian situation with dismay re COVID 19 – what a dreadful situation with so much loss of life.\n\nA final note re Will Bailey, we were happy to meet and most sorry to part. The loss of a great banker and workmate is heavily felt.”\n\nHONORARY BIRTHDAYS\n\nBAILEY W. J. (WILL) 87 YEARS 13/08/2020\n\nWill was CEO of ANZ Banking Group from 1984-1992 , well known to many ANZROC members and a great supporter of ANZROC and a regular contributor to our Newsletter.\n\nOur condolences are extended to Dorothy and her family.\n\nMaria Natoli emailed “It is with great sadness that I am writing to let you know that Will passed away in hospital this morning with Dorothy by his side. Will had a fall at home last week and sustained a serious brain injury from which he did not recover. In recent months, Will had not been in the best of health. A very special person has left us.”\n\nJohn Ries emailed this tribute to Will Bailey\n\n“I first met WJB in London in 1978; he was the no 2 of ANZ’s operations in UK and Europe and I was on secondment to a London Merchant Bank. During my stay in London I grew to appreciate the character of Will; energetic, far sighted, independent and ready to upset the “London Establishment “and the ingrained behavioural culture. Meaning for example a long day at the office was 7 hours; a maximum of 4 hours work (including siesta time), pre-lunch drinks at 11.30am at the local and then a beautifully catered for, hot or cold 3 course menu (a real silver service).\n\nNeedless to say, the locals were not endeared to WJB, but that was a stimulant for him for more action to change London.\n\nSocialising was big for WJB and we were entertained often in Dulwich with Will, Dorothy and others in their Manor. Incidentally, the house was bought by Will beyond his discretion, but when tackled by Wheeler-Bennett the No 1 local, WJB’s response was “don’t worry I’ve made you $100,000 already (1978 values!!). During the 18 Months overlap WJB would always ensure Sandra (my wife, since deceased) and I were part of ANZ’s entertainment world (I worked in Fenchurch Street at Kleinwort’s). The entertainment functions held at 71 Cornhill in the Chamber rivalled everything including the ground floor at 388 Collins Street (the Gothic Chamber). Worth noting that WJB had the latter restored to perfection along with the development of 100 Queen Street.\n\nIn Australia in the mid-1980s WJB took over from J D Milne (“gidday Mister”). The so-called ‘contenders’ for CEO were the 2 Nicolsons, Reg and Jim, and Bruce Dickinson. Often, I would have to present in front of JDM with his successors and always on such occasions when entering WJB would give me a wink, as much to say, “good luck”. That continued for the rest of my career under WJB’s CEO duration.\n\nRestless for change to modernise the Bank and give a much bigger presence in the Corporate and Government worlds as well as the media generally, WJB enthused in his stewardship. An Organisational Restructure was significant in 85/86; not forgetting that the acquisition of Grindlays Bank in the early 80’s was still in its relative infancy within the ANZ stable. Moreover, one has to recognise WJB’s influence in the National Mutual matter that found its declinal on Keating’s desk.\n\nMany other great things happened during Will’s tenure, too many to list, but suffice to say a very, very busy agenda in which he thrived. Just one for noting, being the Holmes a Court threat to BHP, ANZ, as a blue-chip establishment, was to the fore and an occasion where WJB exercised Board discretion to facilitate an arrangement that assisted the Big Miner, and further cement the long-term relationship. A government enquiry ensued but ANZ came out with a clean slate.\n\nWill sat comfortably with the big picture future scenario, and it was easy on many occasions to find you were in disagreement with him. My experience was, that didn’t matter; he would hold his line but be contented that there are different ways to view things and respect you for it.\n\nOn a very personal point, I have always felt he treated me somewhat special and guided my career from our London times. If that were true, my family and I are very fortunate to have had someone so powerful and yet so “down to earth” looking f"
