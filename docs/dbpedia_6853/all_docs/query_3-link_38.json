        "text": "Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and was the first outside investor in Facebook, is probably the most successful – and certainly the most interesting – venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. He lists among his passions chess, the works of Tolkien and ‘intellectual conversations with friends’. And what he calls ‘the problem of death’ is a topic that he returns to often. ‘I think there are probably three main modes of approaching it,’ he says. ‘You can accept it, you can deny it or you can fight it. I think our society is dominated by people who are into denial or acceptance, and I prefer to fight it.’\n\nThiel is an amiable, softly spoken man who gives the impression of thinking out loud. Questions are frequently greeted with a series of ‘ums… aahs… I think… let me put it this way…’, beginning a thought, stopping, trying another, and then another, as if he is testing the best way to be as precise as he can possibly be. ‘Hobbes said that in the state of nature life is nasty, brutish and short,’ he says. ‘And, um, I do think we want to overcome the state of nature. It is true that you can say that death is natural, but it is also natural to fight death. But if you stand up and say this is a big problem, we should do something about this, that makes people very uncomfortable, because they’ve made their peace with death. In some ways it’s a microcosm of the whole complacency of the Western world. I do think there is this danger that our society has made its peace with decline. I’d like to jolt them out of their complacency a little bit.’\n\nThiel, whose net worth is reported to be $2.2 billion, is Silicon Valley royalty, and a singular figure even in that rarefied world. He is a gay practising Christian, a libertarian who has thrown money and support behind the political campaigns of the Republican John McCain and the Libertarian Ron Paul, and who sits on the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group – the elite band of the rich and powerful from politics, industry and business that convenes each year to discuss nobody-outside-the-inner-circle-quite-knows-what. Above all, he is a man with a utopian belief in the power of technology to change the world.\n\nThrough a variety of venture capital funds and his non-profit Thiel Foundation, Thiel has invested substantially in space travel, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and information technology. He has been one of the most public champions of ‘sea­steading’ – the idea of establishing floating communities outside territorial waters and beyond the regulatory powers of governments. His Thiel Fellowship programme encourages clever people under the age of 20 to forgo a college education and start their own companies. And he has poured millions of dollars into what he calls ‘the immortality project’. ‘I would like to live longer, and I would like other people to live longer.’ His belief is such that he has signed up with Alcor, the leading company in the field of cryogenics, to be deep-frozen at the time of his death – as much as an ‘ideological statement’, he says, as in any expectation of being thawed out any time in the near future. ‘In telling you that I’ve signed up for it [cryogenics], there’s always this reaction that it’s really crazy, it’s disturbing. But my take on it is it’s only disturbing because it challenges our complacency.’\n\nPeter Thiel’s fortunes may rest largely in Silicon Valley, but he lives and works in San Francisco. His office is in a low-slung building in the Presidio, the national park close to the Golden Gate Bridge, which is also home to George Lucas’s film business. Thiel’s offices house his hedge-fund business, one of his venture capital funds and the Thiel Foundation. Founders Fund, the venture capital firm that he runs with six partners, is in a neighbouring building. Thiel’s home, in the Marina district overlooking the ocean, is a five-minute drive away. He also owns a home in Maui, Hawaii.\n\nThiel has invited me to join him for breakfast, prepared by his own chef, which we eat in a glass-walled conference room. Thiel is of medium height, stocky in build, and moves like a man who, even at the age of 46, has not quite got used to his body. He has come from a run – he does a three- or four-mile jog two or three times a week, and enjoys hiking and surfing – and is dressed in a T-shirt, chinos and trainers. He is eating an egg-white spinach omelette – ‘I’m on a crazy diet,’ he grumbles. I am eating a cheese omelette with the yolk left in, a side of bacon and a bowl of fruit, at which he occasionally throws covetous glances.\n\nAlmost the first thing Thiel does after we have been introduced is to ask what are the three most interesting things I’ve encountered in the past year. He might learn something new, he explains, ‘and it gives me a better idea of the kind of things you might want to explore.’\n\n‘Peter is very different from most people in Silicon Valley,’ Luke Nosek, one of the co-founders of PayPal, and now on the Founders Fund board, told me. ‘With a lot of people the conversation is about how are we going to make more money; with Peter the conversation is “How are we going to figure this out?” He has a tremendous curiosity about how the world works, and all the philosophical and moral questions around that.’ Another colleague evaluated his ability for ‘casual bar talk’ as ‘very low. The ability to recall a data point – what was gold trading at on day five of the Second World War and what was the impact of that? He has it like a record-book.’\n\nHe was a fanatical chess-player, becaming one of the highest ranked under-21 players in America; an avid reader of science fiction – Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein in particular. He played Dungeons and Dragons, and was obsessed with Tolkien; two of Thiel’s businesses are named after Tolkien references: a technology investment fund Mithril (a precious metal found in Middle-earth) and Palantir, his data analytics company, named after the ‘seeing stones’ in The Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe seed of Thiel’s libertarian beliefs was sown at Stanford. He founded a student newspaper, The Stanford Review, and co-authored a book, The Diversity Myth, attacking political correctness on campus. And he read Solzhenitsyn and Ayn Rand, the eccentric Russian author whose advocacy of ferocious laissez-faire capitalism, and her celebration of the heroic, individualistic genius fighting against bureaucratic regulation, made her something of a patron saint among the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley. The charismatic founder is a characteristic of many Silicon Valley start-ups, Thiel says, ‘but you need a whole team to get things done.’\n\nIn 1999, with a group of friends, Thiel founded PayPal, a system of electronic payments for e-commerce, designed to replace what he called ‘the antique technology’ of paper money, and underpinned by the idea of creating a worldwide online currency beyond the manipulation and control of governments. In many ways it was a project that typified the start-up culture of Silicon Valley. All of the original founders were male; of the six principals, ‘four’, Thiel notes, ‘had built bombs in high school.’ It is the kind of thing that engineering students do. Thiel was not one of them.\n\nRequired reading among the group was Cryptonomicon, written by the cyber-punk author Neil Stephenson – a cult novel among hackers, which imagines an anonymous internet banking system using electronic money. (The group also preferred ‘the capitalist Star Wars to the communist Star Trek,’ Thiel says.) But PayPal’s more libertarian aspirations eventually foundered on the mundane rocks of banking and Visa card regulations. In 2002 the company was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion. Thiel’s 3.7 per cent share was worth $55 million.\n\nThiel says that one of his goals at PayPal was to build a company where the friendships would last, even if nothing else did. ‘I remember someone from one of the law firms in New York telling me they all made a lot of money and they all hated one another, and that was evidence of what a fantastically professional place it was. We wanted to do something quite different.’\n\nThe founders and various employees of the company would go on to found and develop some of the key technology companies that have flourished in Silicon Valley over the past 10 years, earning the moniker ‘the PayPal Mafia’. Elon Musk founded SpaceX and co-founded Tesla Motors; Reid Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn; David Sacks co-founded Yammer; Max Levchin founded the ‘online urban guide’ Yelp. Thiel, whom Fortune magazine named as ‘the Don’, has remained friends with all of them and is a significant investor in many of their companies. In 2004 Hoffman introduced Thiel to a young computer programmer named Mark Zuckerberg, who had dropped out of Harvard to concentrate on developing his college networking site. Thiel became the first outside investor in Facebook; he retains a share in the business, currently worth some $200 million, and a seat on the board.\n\nAt the same time, along with Alex Karp, his roommate at Stanford Law School, Thiel set up the data analytics company Palantir. This grew out of an anti-fraud system that Thiel had developed at PayPal, which combined computer software and human analysis, and which Thiel believed could be applied to identify not only financial fraud but also terrorist networks. The first major investor was the CIA’s investment venture arm In-Q-Tel. Palantir is reported to have played a critical role in tracking down Osama bin Laden, and is also used by banks and drug enforcement agencies. Thiel does not see any conflict between his beliefs and providing a programme which, in theory, allows even more accurate excavation of personal information by government agencies. The debate about security and civil liberties, he says, is often framed as involving a trade-off between the two things. ‘My view is that it’s quite the opposite. As a libertarian, I believe that it’s critical to develop technology like this, because the alternative is that you will get very low-tech solutions that are enormously intrusive but have very little value, which is basically what happened after 9/11 in the United States. For example, if you have no way of potentially identifying likely terrorists you may require every single person to take their shoes off every time they get on an airplane. And I think this is the way one needs to think of the entire, somewhat dysfunctional, National Security Agency/industrial complex. It’s more the Keystone Cops than Big Brother.\n\n‘What’s very interesting about the [Edward] Snowden episode is that you have, on the one hand, this hoovering up of data from all over the world –bureaucracy run amok; but at the same time one gets the sense they had absolutely no idea what the data contains. I suspect Obama did not know he was recording Angela Merkel’s cell phones. This was probably news to him. It may even have been news to the people running the NSA. I think absent something like Palantir there will be more terrorist attacks, and more draconian, non-technological responses to them.’ After Facebook, Palantir has been Thiel’s most profitable investment. The company is valued at $9 billion, and he owns 12 per cent.\n\nHe invested in Facebook at a time when few envisioned the possibilities of social media. Founders Fund was the first outside venture capital business to invest in Musk’s rocket company SpaceX (the fund made an initial investment of $20 million, and with additional investments Founders Fund’s holding in the company is now valued at $500 million). The British artificial intelligence company Deep Mind Technologies, which Founders Fund seeded with a $15 million investment, was bought by Google in January for £240 million.\n\nThe Thiel Foundation, which perhaps most accurately reflects Thiel’s personal passions, funds a range of projects from a biotech company, Modern Meadow, that has developed methods of producing cultured meat and leather products without animal slaughter, to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, a think tank devoted to the study of artificial intelligence, and ensuring that ‘smarter-than-human-intelligence’ machines behave as humans want them to do, rather than as the machines might want to do.\n\nThe Thiel Fellowship is among his more controversial projects. Each year the fellowship awards 20 young people $100,000 each, spread over two years, to give up education and concentrate on starting their own businesses. This reflects Thiel’s abiding criticism of the American education system: that for many of the brightest people a college education is a cripplingly expensive waste of time that leads nowhere. ‘I feel I was personally very guilty of this; you don’t know what to do with your life, so you get a college degree; you don’t know what you’re going to do with your college degree, so you get a graduate degree. In my case it was law school, which is the classic thing one does when one has no idea what else to do. I don’t have any big regrets, but if I had to do it over I would try to think more about the future than I did at the time.’\n\nSince the launch of the scheme, 83 young putative entrepreneurs, including applicants from India and China, have been awarded fellowships, and this year it received 600 applications. The scheme has prompted widespread criticism from educationalists in America. ‘I didn’t think it would hit this sort of raw nerve,’ Thiel says. ‘I mean, how fragile is the education system when 20 talented people leaving and doing something else is somehow enough to threaten it? My only claim is that not all talented people should go to college and not all talented people should do the exact same thing.’\n\nThe grant is in recognition of the individual’s potential, not for any particular project they may be working on, but former fellows have already produced a variety of things in fields as diverse as robotics and public health, including a walker/wheelchair hybrid that can assist its user according to how strong he or she feels at any given moment; a low-cost mechanism that optimises solar panels while providing clean water for rural, off-grid communities; and a software system for face detection and recognition in banks.\n\nI met two young fellows. As a high-school student Connor Zwick, 20, had developed a mobile app to help students revise that had earned him more than $100,000, before going on to Harvard. After hearing Thiel speak he applied for a fellowship and dropped out of college. Since then he had founded and sold one company developing a game-playing interface for smartphones and, with a partner, has now set up another building personalised learning tools.\n\nLaura Deming, also 20, is working in a field particularly close to Thiel’s heart. Deming told me that she had been interested in age-related diseases since she was a child. At the age of 12 she was working in a research lab with the renowned molecular biologist and bio-gerontologist Cynthia Kenyon, at the same time taking graduate courses in biology ‘to learn how to target ageing processes to treat age-related disease’. At 15 she won a place at MIT but dropped out after two years to found her own venture capital fund, investing in biotech start-ups targeting age-related diseases. The prospect of eventually ‘curing’ death, she told me, was ‘not impossible’.\n\nThiel’s theories of entrepreneurialism are encapsulated in a new book, Zero to One, ostensibly a how-to guide on venture capitalism and tech start-ups, but which ranges freely across his theories on the West’s loss of faith in the future and the redemptive power of technology. The book began life as a series of lectures that Thiel delivered at Stanford in 2012 on the subject of ‘Sovereignty, technology and globalisation’. When Blake Masters, a law student, posted his class notes on his online blog it received tens of thousands of hits. Characteristically, rather than taking exception, Thiel embraced it as the ‘open-source’ thinking that abounds in Silicon Valley and invited Masters to collaborate on developing the lectures into a book. Masters is credited as its co-author.\n\nThiel believes that for much of the 20th century America rejoiced in a happy state of what he calls ‘definite optimism’, its growth driven by a boundless belief in the future that produced everything from the interstate highway system to the Apollo space programme. Mischievously, he dates the beginning of the end of this period to the summer of 1969. On July 20 Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon; three weeks later the Woodstock Festival happened. ‘With the benefit of hindsight that was when progress died and the hippies took over.’ Not to attack hippies, he adds, but this was the point at which a belief in scientific and technological progress ceased to be a powerfully animating force.\n\nIn the years since, America has lapsed into a state of ‘indefinite optimism’ – chugging along in the general assumption that the future will somehow get better, without feeling the need to make any plans to ensure it does. But now, Thiel suggests, America has pretty much given up on the future altogether, mired in a state of complacency and stasis where most people are waiting for someone else to solve their problems, and is veering towards a condition of what he calls ‘indefinite pessimism’ – the belief that things are going to get worse, but with no clear idea what to do about it.\n\n‘My claim is that Japan has been in this state of indefinite pessimism since the 1990s and Europe is there now,’ Thiel says. ‘Culturally, there is something very pernicious about it. The millennial generation in the US is the first that has reduced expectations from those of their parents. And I think there is something decadent and declinist about that.’\n\nAmerica needs to find its way back to ‘a definite future’. And the place that is doing it, the last redoubt of ‘definite optimism’ in America, is – you guessed it – Silicon Valley. ‘I do think it is the most dynamic place in the developed world,’ Thiel says. ‘It’s a very optimistic place; there really is a different mode of thinking about the future here, and that makes some people very uncomfortable, but I think we’re at the start of a multi-decade boom.’\n\nThe sceptic may wonder whether, up until now, Silicon Valley has provided the answers to the really big questions faced by mankind. It can sometimes look like a place that expends tremendous effort – and generates enormous profits – on trivial things: mobile apps that address the pressing problems of the young and technologically savvy people who design them; how to whistle up an Uber car; or locate friends standing on the other side of a crowded bar. Thiel recognises the problem. The slogan on the web page of Founders Fund reads, ‘We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.’\n\nThiel has few apps on his iPhone – ‘I would not describe myself as a super-early adopter of consumer technology’ – and while he defends Facebook as ‘a very successful business, which has changed the world for the better in important ways,’ he himself is a only ‘moderate’ user. ‘The algorithms for servicing news stories that are likely to be of interest to respective users have gotten quite good,’ he notes. Cat videos? I ask. ‘No.’\n\nHe has managed to amass 44,000 followers on Twitter without ever having followed anyone or posted a single tweet. ‘You write things quickly and run the risk of saying something you come to regret.’ He pauses. ‘But then you still run the risk of doing that even when you spend a lot of time on things.’ Social media, he agrees, ‘will not take our civilisation to the next level. But this critique can go in one of two directions. You can say all this technology is no good and we shouldn’t have it. Or you can go in the direction that I would go, which is we need a lot more.’\n\nAt the end of his talk one budding Peter Thiel, tried to hand him a business card. Thiel declined it, explaining that he didn’t accept cards because it sends the wrong message - he’d be expected to hand them his card, and if he accepted a card from one person he’d be doing it all day, and if they really wanted to get in touch with him they’d find a way. Somebody else, cottoning on, quickly scribbled their contact details on a dollar bill, which they folded origami style and offered to Thiel as a gift. He accepted it, ‘because its something you made, and also it’s a dollar which has an established value; it’s a transaction in which the parameters of the exchange are very clear.’\n\nNot everybody loves Silicon Valley. The burgeoning wealth and conspicuous expenditure of some the Valley’s most successful entrepreneurs have occasioned some resentment – last year Thiel’s friend the former PayPal executive David Sacks threw himself a 40th birthday party with the theme ‘Let Him Eat Cake’, reported to have cost $1.4 million. In San Francisco rising property prices have been blamed on the inflated salaries in the tech sector, and led to company buses carrying employees from the city to the sprawling tech campuses in the Valley being stoned by protesters –what one tech executive described to me as ‘the Google bus piñata’.\n\nThiel’s libertarian ideals, his evangelical belief in the power of technology to shape the future, and his network of powerful contacts have elevated him to the role of a prophet in Silicon Valley, if breeding a degree of suspicion in some quarters outside it. In the course of researching Thiel, I came across an article linking his investments in seasteading, artificial intelligence and CIA and NSA intelligence-gathering to his role on the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group to place him at the heart of a ‘Zionist’ conspiracy, supposedly ‘deciding globalist agendas’ and advancing technology that will turn humanity into ‘the new slave-automatons of the Elite’. When I showed Thiel the article he speed-read the five pages in almost as few seconds, like a digital scanner, before tossing it aside with a bemused shake of the head. ‘That’s definitely in the hyper-loony category.’\n\nOne of the remarkable things about the Bilderberg Group, he says, is how it unites people from opposite ends of the political spectrum in attacking it. When the group met in a hotel near Washington, DC, in 2012 there were protesters outside from both the left-wing Occupy movement and the right-wing Tea Party, ‘arrayed,’ Thiel remembers, ‘with digital cameras and mock guillotines for executing the traitors to be found within.\n\n‘Actually, the people on the inside find the protesters to be quite reassuring because this suggests something important is going on. But I think the striking thing is that there is no conspiracy; there is no plan, there is no strategy. We live in a world full of conspiracy theories but with very few old-fashioned conspiracies. If you think what political leaders have plans and are thinking about the future, you get the sense it may be true of Putin and the Chinese leadership, but that’s about it. The shocking thing is there is no plan at all.’\n\nThiel describes his own attitude to politics as ‘slightly schizophrenic’. On the one hand, it is ‘theoretically important’; on the other, he says the system is so sclerotic that ‘it’s very hard to move the dial. I do think that in many ways in the Western world our governments, and politics, have become a reactionary force that is largely stalling out the progress.’\n\nIf he has one particular bugbear it is government regulation, which, broadly speaking, he views much like death – he is against it. ‘Within the sphere of technology over the last 40 years, there’s a world of bytes and a world of atoms; and there’s been tremendous progress in computers and the world of bytes; the world of atoms not quite so much. We have new cell phones and computers, but the cities we live in and the transportation we use are strangely not that much changed. From a regulatory perspective, the world of atoms has been regulated very tightly; the world of bytes has been fairly unregulated.\n\n‘In the last decade in Silicon Valley you’ve had this great success with 2.0 technologies, and this enormous failure with clean technology. And if you drill down on why these things fail, one aspect that was a recurrent motif was that the people who started these businesses underestimated the regulatory hurdles they had. Ironically many of them encountered environmental hurdles: you cannot build windmills in the upper Midwest because there are laws to block the power lines that would send the power to Chicago because it’s not aesthetically pleasing. So there’s something crazy, I would submit, in a world where the environmental rules themselves are having the effect of stopping clean technology.’\n\n‘Most of the social issues the left has won, and for the most part I’m happy about that. I think gay marriage will be legal everywhere within the US in 10 years. And marijuana is going to be largely legalised throughout the country.’ He says that as a libertarian he is in favour of drug legalisation, ‘but as someone who would like our world to be more optimistic I think the reason it’s happening is somewhat more problematic. People talk about medical marijuana as a fig leaf for legalisation. I don’t think it's a fig-leaf at all; i'ts all medical marijuana, all just this giant self-medication.’\n\nThiel is least comfortable when asked to reflect on himself. When I ask whether he would describe himself as a happy person, he ponders the question as if it were a particularly complicated mathematical equation – ‘Um… let me think about that. Um… I always find it difficult answering that sort of question because it’s hard to precisely compare with other people. It’s such an interior type of thing…’ – before finally concluding, ‘I think so.’\n\nHe has no great interest in music, and seldom reads novels. In recent years he has ‘dialled back’ on his chess playing – ‘It’s a very dangerous addiction.’ He lives alone but has a boyfriend. He has thought about having children, he says, and likes the idea. ‘Although I think you have to spend enough time to really raise them well. And I’m not sure I could do that.’ His friends are, for the most part, ‘loosely’ in the world of technology, who share his belief in the redemptive power of technology, his enthusiasm for conversations about macroeconomics, artificial intelligence, and, as Thiel puts it, ‘figuring things out’. He is, as you might expect, a definite optimist.\n\nThiel believes there will be a cure for cancer in the next 20 years, and that a cure for Alzheimer’s is within reach. Immortality, he allows, may take a little longer. He has given more than $6 million to support the work of Aubrey de Grey, the English gerontologist who co-founded the Methuselah Foundation, and is now the chief research scientist of SENS Research Foundation (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence). De Grey has famously pronounced that he believes the first person to live to 1,000 is already alive today.\n\nThe ‘life extension project’, Thiel says, is as old as science itself. ‘It was probably even more important than alchemy. Finding élan vital, the water of life, was of greater interest than finding something that could transmute everything into gold. And I do think people would prefer immortality to lots of gold. On a fundamental level, the question is whether ageing can be reversed or not. Many biological processes appear to be irreversible, but computational processes are reversible. If it is possible to understand biological systems in informational terms, could we then reverse these biological processes, including the process of ageing? I do think that the genomics revolution promises a much greater understanding of biological systems and opens the possibility of modifying these seemingly inevitable trajectories in far more ways than we can currently imagine.’ So immortality may be possible? ‘Well, “immortal” is a long time.\n\n‘There are many arguments against life extension, and they all strike me as extraordinarily bad: it’s not natural; there will be too many people; you will be bored. But I don’t think it would be boring at all.’ He pauses. ‘People always say you should live your life as if it were your last day. I think you should live your life as though it will go on for ever; that every day is so good that you don’t want it to end.’"
