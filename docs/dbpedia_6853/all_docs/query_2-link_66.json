        "text": "Peter Gzowski, broadcaster, writer, editor (born 13 July 1934 in Toronto, ON; died 24 January 2002 in Toronto, ON). A Companion of the Order of Canada, winner of the international Peabody Award, and legendary host of CBC Radio's \"Morningside,\" Peter Gzowski was one of Canada's most accomplished and beloved broadcasters.\n\nPeter was born in Toronto, but grew up in the small town Galt, ON. He won a scholarship to attend the University of Toronto and soon found his calling working as an editor (1955-1956) at the university paper, The Varsity.\n\nAt 19, Gzowski got his first newspaper job as an ad salesman for the Timmins Daily Press. A year later, he was working as a police reporter for the Toronto Telegram. In 1957, bored with his studies at the University of Toronto, Gzowski quit to become the city editor at the Moose Jaw Times-Herald in Saskatchewan. He was paid $55 a week. Gzowski later said it was the \"smartest thing\" he had done. At 28 he became managing editor of Maclean's, a Canadian weekly news magazine.\n\nGzowski became a household name as the host of CBC Radio's lively, eclectic \"This Country in the Morning\" (1971–74), and with his subsequent talk show on CBC-TV, \"90 Minutes Live\" (1976–78).\n\nHowever, his most popular radio program was \"Morningside\" (1982-1997). His curiosity, sensitivity and wit, combined with his ability to project personal warmth, made him one of the best (and best-loved) broadcasters in Canada. It is estimated that over his career, Gzowski conducted some 30,000 interviews and reached 1.5 million listeners. He championed all things Canadian, from Inuit throat singing to overlooked Canadian literature.\n\nOther notable awards/work:\n\nACTRA Award for the best host-interviewer on radio in 1974, 1985 and 1987\n\nGovernor General's Award for the Performing Arts (1995)\n\nDoctorates from 12 universities, including Trent University in Peterborough, ON, which in 1999 named him Chancellor\n\nFounded the Peter Gzowski Invitational Golf tournament, which raised $13 million for literacy projects across Canada\n\nWrote and contributed to 16 books\n\n\"His listeners felt that he trusted them to take an adult interest in their country, and their response showed how their lives were opened and their days warmed by such easy courtesy, such comfortable respect.\" -Author Alice Munroe\n\n\"He was an unforgettable presence\" -Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister (1993-2003)\n\n\"He cared deeply about Canada and, through him, we listened to voices from every corner of our vast land.\" -Adrienne Clarkson, Governor-General (1999-2005)"
