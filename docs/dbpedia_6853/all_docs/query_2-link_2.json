Also one brother and sisters, Lars Raw, Mrs. K.M. Thon and Mrs. M. Wester all of Fergus.91\n\nCame to County 53 Years Ago\n\nPeder Raw, of the Town of Trondhjem Was One of County’s Faithful Pioneers.\n\nRothsay, March 15, 1924- Peder Raw, whose death was briefly referred to in Friday’s journal, died at a hospital in Pelican Rapids March 12. Doctors were not sure of the exact cause of death but an examination disclosed a tumor of the stomach. He had been sick about a month.\n\nHe was born in Hadeland, Norway, July 7, 1844 and would have been 80 years in July. He came here with his parents when five years of age. They came, as most of the pioneers did at that time (1850) with a strong faith in America.\n\nThey had but fifteen dollars capital with which to make a home in a new land. They settled in Wisconsin, where they farmed and as the call came to go farther west they went to Iowa to continue farming.\n\nFinally the Red River Valley in Minnesota attracted many who wished to again take up life in the wilderness and Peder came to Otter Tail County settling on a homestead in Trondhjem in July 1871.\n\nThe same year in December he was married to Miss Kari Bilden in Pelican Rapids. They were among the first settlers of the town, long before the railroad went through. They were hard workers and thrifty always living within their means and laid a little by and prospered. After proving up his homestead he bought an adjoining quarter section to which he moved and resided for thirty years. His two sons being grown up and married he bought a smaller farm, an adjoining eighty and moved on to that and each son got a quarter section to run, keeping the family close together. He lived on his eighty acres until his death, making fifty-three years that he lived in that locality.\n\nDuring the most of his lifetime there were few labor saving machines and conveniences, the hands and manpower being the main asset. Yet he prospered and was content. As the conveniences came on the market he appreciated them and made use of them. Just the few last years he bought a car and drove it himself, getting much pleasure from it. If the present generation would but take a lesson from these pioneers who are leaving us so rapidly, in endurance, thrift and economy and put these lessons into practice there would be better conditions.\n\nMr. Raw will be sadly missed by his family and in the community which was so long his home. He leaves his wife, two sons and two daughters, Ed and Carl of Trondhjem, Hannah (Mrs. Ole Velo of Pelican Rapids) and Miss Carrie at home. Also one brother and three sisters, Lars Raw, Mrs. K. M. Thom and Mrs. M. Wester of Fergus Falls.91\n\nNotes for Kari (Spouse 1)"
