That same year, he was selected to represent Canada at the St. Louis Olympics, where he placed sixth in the 1500 metres and competed in the 800 metres. Additionally, he took part in the non-Olympic 1 mile handicap race and was third among the three entrants. He continued to compete at the national level for several more years, but retired from active competition by the end of the decade. He died of injuries sustained in a car accident in 1956.\n\nPersonal Bests: 800 – unknown; 1500 – unknown; Mile – 4:40.0e (1902)."
