        "text": "Vet care and no gray hair?\n\nBobi does have a few vets looking after him. He was in excellent health; unfortunately, he was treated with Bravecto a few years ago due to fleas, and that is when his head tilt appeared.\n\nAs to why Bobi isn't gray, he likely carries a gene that prevents graying. His longevity is most likely a mix of healthy food, plenty of social interaction, and good genes.\n\nDespite all this, Leonel and his mother, Donna Maria, remained patient, protective, and clear about their boundaries.\n\nOn Sunday, I talked to Leonel about how unprepared he feels for when Bobi won't be around anymore. I understand him well and know that you, my dear readers, do too.\n\nLeonel's openness touched me. We're all scared of the moment our dogs won't be with us anymore. All we can do is keep seeking, researching, and discussing ways to prolong their healthy lives.\n\nI admire Leonel because, despite his and Bobi's fame, he lives a simple life in his humble farmhouse in a small village in Portugal. His openness and hospitality to us and others are undoubtedly genuine and sincere.\n\nBefore leaving, we discussed Bobi's care, particularly his mobility and a small open growth by his rear end. I suggested increasing his Omega-3 intake and shared my experience with natural wound care.\n\nAfter my return from Portugal, I was moved by your responses to Bobi's story. Setting up a \"Bobi and Leonel's Gratitude Fund\" seemed the perfect way to show our appreciation. However, life has a way of surprising us.\n\nJust when I launched the fundraiser on GoFundMe, I spoke to Leonel, Bobi's owner, who graciously insisted that he would not accept any money despite appreciating the gesture. He doesn't want people to think their extraordinary bond could be tied to any form of financial gain.\n\nAnd while it saddens me that our Community can't express gratitude this way, I deeply respect Leonel's decision, closed the campaign and will refund the money to the donors.\n\nWhile this may seem like a setback, it is still an opportunity to celebrate Bobi's life. We have learned invaluable lessons about his care and natural diet and were touched by their incredible bond.\n\nANOTHER WAY TO CELEBRATE!\n\nIn honor of Bobi's extraordinary life, I've decided to make every 10th order ending with the number 7 on our website at peterdobias.com FREE by receiving a gift card in the value of your order.\n\nThis offer applies to new orders only, and repeated orders or refunds do not qualify for this event. If you're a winner, you'll find out instantly at the time of purchase! Please allow us 3 business days to award you with the gift card. This special ends on Monday, May 22, 2023.\n\nMy offer here isn't just about making someone's day with a free order; it's about spreading the love and creating a positive ripple effect to celebrate all dogs!\n\nWishing you many more heartwarming adventures together!\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDr. Peter Dobias"
