        "text": "Now that you understand why raw foods are better for your dog, let’s talk about transitioning.\n\nThe most important thing to grasp is that transitioning to raw dog food does not have a “one size fits all” approach. Each dog may handle the following options in a different manner.\n\nBut we’ll discuss everything you need to know so you can determine the best option for you.\n\nYou have two choices:\n\nCompare this to smoking or eating junk food. Should you wean off the potato chips or throw out the bag and start fresh? The latter is how many dog owners feel.\n\nGranted, it can be more complicated than that…\n\nBut once their eyes are opened to the shortcomings of processed pet food, these dog owners chuck the old food. They march straight to the store, buy prepackaged raw dog food (or set out to make their own) and never look back.\n\nNo instruction is needed. Throw out (or donate) your old food and start with raw ASAP.\n\nMany dogs do fine with a cold turkey switch. My dog was one of them, he was 4 months old when I switched him to raw.\n\nBut for other dogs, it can be different. The experience may send their unprepared caregivers running for the hills. Panicked, pet parents return to processed foods.\n\nBack to the same old problems…\n\nAnd we don’t want that.\n\nYou transition to raw dog food, gradually.\n\nFor most dogs, this is a one – two-week period. But for others, it can last up to 4 weeks or even 6 months, depending on the circumstances.\n\nUnderstand, some dogs have sensitive GI tracts.\n\nChanging from one food to another may cause minor to severe GI upset. This could be caused by age, disease, or a life of kibble and overexposure to chemicals and toxins.\n\n• Day 1: Use the new raw food as a treat. Keep an eye on the condition of your dog’s stool.\n\n• Day 2 – 4: Increase the number of raw food treats over the next several days. Continue to monitor stools.\n\n• Day 5: If the stool is normal, replace one whole meal of old food with the new food.\n\n• Day 5 – 7: Do this for several more days. If the stools remain normal, stop the old food and feed the new food permanently.\n\n• Day 1: feed 1/8th of the new food, 7/8th of the old food\n\n• Day 2: feed 1/4th of the new food, 3/4th of the old food\n\n• Day 3: feed 1/2 of the new food, 1/2 of the old food\n\n• Day 4: feed 3/4th of the new food, 1/4th of the old food\n\n• Day 5: feed 7/8th of the new food, 1/8th of the old food\n\n• Day 6: feed 100% of the new food\n\nFor the people that can’t shake the “never combine kibble and raw foods” rumor, we have a solution for you too.\n\nThis approach is almost identical to the “combined” gradual switch. The only difference is you’re going to feed the old food and new food separately.\n\nIt has the same breakdown:\n\n• Day 1: feed 1/8th of the new food, 7/8th of the old food\n\n• Day 2: feed 1/4th of the new food, 3/4th of the old food\n\n• Day 3: feed 1/2 of the new food, 1/2 of the old food\n\n• Day 4: feed 3/4th of the new food, 1/4th of the old food\n\n• Day 5: feed 7/8th of the new food, 1/8th of the old food\n\n• Day 6: feed 100% of the new food\n\nExcept, the portions of new and old food are separated. Provide one in the morning and one in the evening. Feel free to start at ¼ if your dog isn’t overly sensitive.\n\nHow fast you transition from cooked to raw depends on how your dog is handling it. You many need to extend this transition schedule.\n\nIf your dog has issues with a decrease in cooking, wait until digestive upset resolves before moving to the next step. You can wait it out at the current level or return to the previous level for a few days.\n\nIf you’re unsure how long to cook a percentage of your dog’s daily serving, time how long it takes to cook through on the first day. Then, use that time frame as a guideline for reducing cooking on subsequent days.\n\nOnly cook meat, NEVER edible bone. Cooked bone is prone to splintering and should not be fed to dogs.\n\nWith that said, you can cook a premade, ground raw dog food if the bone in that formula is small enough. Dr. Peter Dobias says, “In this situation, you can cook packaged meat with ground bone in it. The ground bone fragments must be smaller than 1/2 cm (or 1/4 inch to be safe). Such small fragments of cooked bone… do not pose a threat to your dog if fed mixed in the rest of the meat.” If you’re unsure, ask your raw food manufacturer. I know a lot of premade raw brands will, like Darwin’s, for example will instruct new customers (and new raw feeders) to initially cook their food\n\nPuppies tend to have a healthier digestive system, which is why they can tolerate a rapid switch in diet.\n\nSome puppies can handle a raw transition in 1 or 2 days with little issue. Young dogs and puppies can be transitioned with any method (unless they have a health condition) and are great candidates for the cold turkey switch.\n\nWith that said, if your puppy is not healthy, I recommend a gradual transition option.\n\nMove slower with older dogs.\n\nTheir age makes them less robust and more fragile to dietary changes. Give senior dogs plenty of time to adjust to a new food. The transition process may need to be extended for several weeks or months.\n\nMost senior dogs have eaten processed pet food their entire lives. And the same brand!\n\nThe older the dog (and the longer they’ve eaten kibble) the longer you should take to transition them to raw.\n\nThe raw transition for most dogs is smooth and straightforward. But some cases—especially dogs with GI disease—will be more complex.\n\nYou’ll need to proceed responsibly and carefully.\n\nAccording to veterinarian, Dr. Karen Becker, dogs acquire GI issues from dietary transitions for two reasons:\n\n• The speed of the change\n\n• Dysbiosis\n\nDr. Becker explains dysbiosis as “an imbalance of gut bacteria – too few friendly bacteria and too many opportunistic or pathogenic (bad) bacteria.”\n\nThis is why dogs with GI Disease need:\n\n1. A gradual switch\n\n2. Additional support during the transition.\n\nRemember, dogs that eat kibble and dogs that eat raw have different gut microbe populations. When you’re first transitioning, it’s likely your kibble-fed dog may not have the gut microbes and “healthy” bacteria to get the most out of raw food.\n\nThis is why supplementing with probiotics is a good idea.\n\nGut microbe transitions will also take time. It takes about a week to decrease the microbe population we don’t want and increase the ones that we do want.\n\nAccording to dog food formulator, researcher, and author Steve Brown:\n\n“If a seasoned holistic veterinarian isn’t participating in the dietary transition, it can go so poorly for some of these animals that they end up being hospitalized. These unsuccessful attempts at a dietary transition are why traditional vets will say, “Some pets just can’t tolerate raw foods or fresh foods. You just need to leave well enough alone and continue feeding kibble.”\n\nBut it’s important to recognize that with good effort and professional guidance, these animals, too, can be transitioned to better, healthier diets.”\n\nDogs with GI disease will take more time to successfully transition to raw. Some can take up to a year. But the results are worth it.\n\nSadly, many dog owners see it as too much trouble and give up. They continue the same lifestyle that caused the problem.\n\nBut consider this:\n\nYour dog is either moving towards health or away from it.\n\nIn a year from now, do you want a healthier dog? Or, a dog just another year older with the same (or worsening) health issues?\n\nPut the time and energy into making a lifestyle change that will heal you dog’s body from the inside out.\n\nThis is normal. In reality, you should celebrate. Your dog is on the right track. In the raw feeding community, we call this getting “unsick.”\n\nWhile it may seem unnerving, understand your dog is not sick. In fact these are signs your dog’s body is purging itself of the various toxins that have built up over time.\n\nThe detox process may resolve in a week or two. But it could take a couple of months, as new cells replace old ones.\n\nDogs that have been on antibiotics, steroids or other long-term drugs may experience longer detox periods. Consult your vet if detox symptoms don’t go away or if you believe your dogs is experiencing severe issues from the diet change.\n\nBut after your dog has transitioned to raw foods, stools will be smaller and firmer. They may even turn white and crumble in a day or two if you forget to pick them up.\n\nYour dog may pass them with ease or may strain slightly when passing. This is normal and beneficial. Harder stools help your dog express their anal glands. This reduces the likelihood of infection or needing to have them expressed at the vet’s office.\n\nAgain, this is nothing to worry about.\n\nHeaping, messy, smelly piles of poop will be a thing of the past when your dog is on a proper raw diet.\n\nObviously, being on a raw diet does not make your dog immune to diarrhea or “less than ideal” stools. Especially, if they ate something they shouldn’t or when they’re trying to new foods.\n\nBut when fully transitioned, a quality raw diet will produce smaller, harder stools.\n\nI’m telling you this, so you know what to expect.\n\nBelieve it or not, some dog owners have returned to kibble because no one explained their dog’s stools would change so drastically.\n\nFast your dog before their first raw meal – This gives their digestive system a chance to reset and detox. Plus, it ensures they’re hungry and will have greater interest in their new food the next day.\n\nFast adult dogs for 24 hours – (12 at the very least) and don’t fast a puppy under a year of age.\n\nChoose a transition method that supports your dog’s potty schedule. – I recommend a more gradual switch if you’re limited in your ability to let your dog out throughout the day. If you’ve opted for the cold turkey switch, start over a weekend or when you’re off from work. That way, you’re available should additional potty trips be needed.\n\nStop (or at least limit) treats during the transition – Particularly flour/grain-based ones. We want to increase your dog’s appetite for raw meat and decrease their desire for junk food.\n\nProvide access to plenty of clean, filtered water.\n\nBe positive! – Dogs are sensitive to our emotions, like apprehension and skepticism. Confidence will reassure your dog about their change in food.\n\nBe smart about accidents. – Consider where your dog stays when you’re not home. Diarrhea and digestive upset are possibilities. Avoid messes on the carpet or in other areas of your home by crating your dog.\n\nStart with one protein. – Unless you’re feeding premade raw dog food, we’re not aiming to provide a balanced, long-term diet at this step. Variety is important but when transitioning to raw, start slow. This makes it easier on your dog’s digestive system and ensures a gentle and positive introduction to raw feeding.\n\nFeed one protein for at least a week. – Some spend 2 weeks or more getting adjusted to a new protein source, it will depend on how your dog is handling it.\n\nAdd other protein sources gradually. Give each new protein a week – several weeks to adjust. This way, we can ensure your dog is doing well with the addition of each new item.\n\nConsider starting with poultry. – Most dog owners begin with chicken or poultry sources since these proteins are easiest to digest. Bland meals help your dog adjust as too many rich foods can cause diarrhea and digestive upset.\n\nNext, add red meat to the diet. – Red meat is essential to a raw diet. But it should be added following a successful transition of white meat. Try pork, beef, or lamb. Introduce in small amounts and gradually increase.\n\nFeed bone (or a bone replacement with muscle meat)\n\nAdd extra bone (if your dog eats it safely) – It’s recommended to add some extra bone for the first couple of meals and while transitioning. This helps keep stools firm during the transition.\n\nMake sure edible bone is introduced properly. – Ensure you know how to introduce bone before blindly giving it a whirl.\n\nFeed correctly sized raw meaty bones – Make sure the RMB you’re providing is suitable for the size of your dog.\n\nMonitor your dog while eating bone. – Most kibble-fed dogs have never eaten a raw meaty bone and may not know how to do so properly. Choking can happen if your dog eats too fast or tries to gulp his/her food.\n\nStart by hand feeding if you don’t know what to expect. – If you’re uncertain if your dog will try to gulp, start with a ground raw diet, hand feed edible bones to your dog, or provide RMBs larger than their head so you can remove them before they become a choking hazard.\n\nDark Stools. – If you feed mainly poultry, pork and beef and notice that stools are very dark (almost black), too much organ was likely added. But if you feed mostly exotics, wild game, and dark red meats like kangaroo for example – dark stools will be normal.\n\nLoose stools. – If stools are soft or loose, add a little more bone to firm them up and slow down when adding new items.\n\nTreat digestive upset. – If your dog experiences digestive upset or diarrhea for 2 or more days, increase the bone content. And provide slippery elm bark until stools have firmed. Dosage instructions in this article. Buy Slippery Elm Bark in powder form here (organic & non-GMO) or here, and here for just organic. Buy the capsule form here (organic, non-GMO) and here and here for non-GMO only.\n\nThe same transition tips still apply for premade raw dog food brands.\n\nIt’s worth noting that some dog owners prefer to switch to prepackaged raw dog food first. This allows them to gain confidence while getting their feet wet.\n\nWith this approach, dog owners can focus on the switch. They don’t have to worry about sourcing ingredients and providing the right item at the right time. They can hold off on buying supplies and committing to a homemade raw diet until ready.\n\nSome dog owners choose to stay with premade raw dog food. Once comfortable, others begin learning how to feed a raw diet at home. They may switch to a 100% homemade raw diet or feed a mix of both.\n\nIntroduce new formulas slowly. Because premade raw dog food is a ground mixture, you can’t isolate ingredients. So anytime you feed a new protein recipe (even if it’s the same brand) – move slow. Prepackaged raw is a great option for the harder-to-source exotic and novel proteins. But make sure to give your dog time to adjust to an unfamiliar protein. After a slow introduction, your dog should be able to bounce between recipes without issue.\n\nSwitch between different raw dog food brands slowly. Each brand (and their individual recipes) differ. The ingredients used and the quantity of those ingredients vary. Knowing this, proceed slowly when switching between brands. Some brands might contain the perfect percentages of ingredients for your dog. While another brand’s recipe may cause a bout of loose stools.\n\nConsider bone percentages when transitioning from commercial to homemade raw dog food. Most premade raw dog food has a high bone content. If switching to a homemade raw diet, you may notice diarrhea, loose stools, or stomach upset. No need to panic. The bone percentages in your new, homemade diet might be too low. Or you may have increased rich foods too quickly. Take new proteins, red meats, and especially organ slow. And increase bone content until stools resolve.\n\nBe smart when switching from ground bone to raw meaty bones. Commercial raw diets contain ground bone. This doesn’t require your dog’s teeth. Raw meaty bones do. Make sure you understand how to properly introduce bone and how to feed it safely before jumping in.\n\nSome dogs never make the switch completely. Many pet parents leave their dogs suspended between kibble and raw.\n\nPerhaps they’re:\n\n• Still uncomfortable with the idea of raw foods\n\n• Alarmed by digestive upset and detox symptoms\n\n• Afraid they’ll leave important nutrients out\n\nUnless you can’t afford to feed 100% raw, avoid this.\n\nToo many dog owners start the transition; make it halfway and remain there. Sure, some fresh foods are better than none. But you’ll see the most benefit if you transition your dog to a complete raw diet.\n\nDon’t be afraid to reach out for support.\n\nJoin an online raw feeding group. Raw feeding forums and Facebook groups are an amazing support network. Members consist of veteran raw feeders who have years of experience, but also newcomers in the same position as you.\n\nRegardless of experience level, these groups share two things in common:\n\n1. Members are eager to do what’s best for their pets\n\n2. They’re happy to help and share their knowledge.\n\nA raw feeding group is an invaluable tool for beginners, so you don’t feel like you’re at this alone. Plus, you have quick access to other raw feeders should you have a question or run into any bumps in the road.\n\nAt this point, you know how to transition your dog to a raw diet. Now it’s in your hands. You have everything you need to ensure a smooth and successful raw dog food transition.\n\n1. Review the pros and cons for each transition option along with considerations for life stages.\n\n2. Determine if a cold turkey or gradual switch is appropriate for your dog\n\n3. After you’ve made a decision, brush up on what to expect along with tips for success."
