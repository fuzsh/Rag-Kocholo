        "text": "In a cold and beautiful corner of Victoria dotted with dairy farms, two small towns are grieving the sudden loss of three of their own — while the rest of the country has watched on, intrigued by the unusual deaths.\n\nThe national and international media has focused on the town of Leongatha – population 5,800.\n\nHere, Erin Patterson hosted her former in-laws Gail and Don Patterson as well as Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson and her husband Ian Wilkinson for a family lunch on July 29.\n\nSince that lunch Gail, Don and Heather have all passed away from suspected mushroom poisoning while Ian remains in intensive care.\n\nAcross Australia, the focus has been what happened at that Leongatha lunch.\n\nWhat was the meal served? Why didn't Erin Patterson get sick? How did suspected death cap mushrooms make it into the meal?\n\nThe country has been left puzzled by how something as seemingly innocuous as a family lunch could end in such tragedy.\n\nEach part of the police investigation has been closely followed – from police listing Erin Patterson as a suspect, to detectives searching a nearby tip, to Erin Patterson publicly declaring she \"didn't do anything\".\n\nBut in South Gippsland it is in the neighbouring town of Korumburra – population 4,700 — where this tragedy has been most deeply felt, because this is where all four of the lunch guests were from.\n\nKorumburra (pronounced KUH-rum-BURRAH) has one main street which is popular with tourists who stop for coffee and food on their way to Wilsons Promontory National Park.\n\nHere there are both old-school country pubs and trendy newer cafes. Op shops sit alongside more upmarket homeware and vintage stores and all are surrounded by South Gippsland's picturesque rolling green hills.\n\nIn Korumburra, Ian Wilkinson was the Baptist minister who also worked as a handyman at the local retirement village.\n\nHeather worked at the Milpara Korumburra Community House where she taught English as a second language, while the Pattersons had run the local paper, the Burra Flyer.\n\nIn this small dairy town, the headlines about their deaths are deeply personal.\n\nHere, the unanswered questions are less of a focus. Instead, people are dealing with the raw grief of losing friends, colleagues, community leaders and family members.\n\nJenni Keerie is a South Gippsland local councillor who also manages the community house that Heather had worked at for the past eight years.\n\nShe said Heather had a real knack of explaining how the English language works and connecting with her students.\n\n\"She was a really great teacher and her students just absolutely loved her,\" Jenni says.\n\nHeather helped her students who were applying for citizenship and was a huge supporter of migrant women in the community who were isolated or needed assistance.\n\n\"She supported a number of women who had gone through quite critical times and supported the families to be able to manage,\" Jenni remembers.\n\nJenni says Heather was a woman who lived her Christian faith.\n\n\"She didn't make judgements about anyone who had a different following or belief, she was curious to find out what the commonalities were in their religions.\n\n\"She touched the lives of many.\"\n\nSo deeply were Heather and Ian loved and respected in their community, Jenni says she has had community members make extraordinary offers to help Ian who reportedly needed a liver transplant.\n\n\"I've had community members phone me this week and say, 'I've heard Ian needs a transplant … and I want to be a donor so what can I do',\" Jenni explains.\n\n\"That is the calibre of people they were and their contributions to the community.\"\n\nJenni says her community is still in shock over the deaths and is mourning the loss of three people who all made huge contributions to their local community.\n\nRight now, she says those who were close to the Pattersons and Wilkinsons need the space to speak to one another and support each other.\n\n\"I've had people coming in this week who all have a story to share and they just need to express how they are feeling – the shock, being stunned, being confused,\" she says.\n\n\"Those reflections are really key to our community healing.\"\n\nAcross a week, bad news is delivered day after day\n\nIf you drive up a steep hill right behind the Korumburra shops, you'll get to the Anglican Church.\n\nIt sits up high, a beautiful old building with intricate lead lighting windows which show biblical scenes.\n\nThe church is cool with a hushed and calm feel.\n\nReverend Fran Grimes arrived to lead this congregation in 2017, where she was welcomed by Ian Wilkinson.\n\n\"That was lovely the day I arrived, he welcomed me on behalf of the combined churches of Korumburra,\" she says.\n\nSince then, the two religious leaders have worked on a Sunday school and church projects together.\n\n\"I have really loved his humble, loving and kind ways of going about things, very inclusive,\" the Reverend Grimes says.\n\nBut it is here, six years after Ian welcomed her to Korumburra, that the Reverend Grimes has been tending to her shocked and overwhelmed congregation.\n\nAt last Sunday's church service she says the news of the deaths was \"incredibly heavy on people's hearts and a lot of people were feeling numb and couldn't believe it, that such a thing could happen,\" she says.\n\nIn Korumburra, she says the news has been deeply felt because the community members all know each other \"from growing up together, from their kids growing up together\".\n\nShe says many community members are in need of care and support right now, but she has also been uplifted by the way people have banded together.\n\nOne of her parishioners printed out little prayers to hand out to those who were struggling with their grief.\n\nBut what has been tricky to deal with has been the national spotlight.\n\nSince Sunday, the Reverend Grimes, says much of the information about the deaths has come to the community through the media.\n\nIn some cases community members first learnt of the death of their friends through news reporting.\n\n\"It was like it was taken out of the space where we could all love each other and support each other and it was far bigger and out of our control, so it has been difficult,\" she explains.\n\nNot for the first time, the media is 'swamping' Leongatha\n\nFormer South Gippsland mayor Ray Argento says it has been a difficult week for these South Gippsland towns.\n\n\"The community is sort of in a state of shock to be honest, to think something like this could eventuate,\" he says.\n\nHe understands the pressure that comes with the national spotlight better than most.\n\nIn 1977, he was one of nine children who were kidnapped from their school on the outskirts of Leongatha by an escaped prisoner who demanded a ransom for their return.\n\nThe children and their teacher were later rescued.\n\nRay says seeing the media attention focused on the current police investigation, brought back memories of what he went through.\n\n\"It certainly brought back the memories of the media attention swamping a small town and taking information in regards to the events at the time, pretty much the same as what is occurring now, the only difference is there was no Facebook or social media back then,\" he says.\n\nHe says one of the issues his community grappled with then was a sense of disbelief that such a thing could occur in their hometown.\n\nIt's something he knows locals will again be struggling to find answers to."
