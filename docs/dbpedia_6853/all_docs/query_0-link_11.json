        "text": "Ocean temperatures in the Great Barrier Reef are now the hottest in at least 400 years and are an “existential threat” to the planet’s unique natural wonder, according to new scientific research.\n\nScientists analysed long-lived corals in and around the reef that keep a record of temperature hidden in their skeleton and matched them to modern observations.\n\nThe research, published in the prestigious journal Nature, used climate models to find the extreme temperatures of recent decades could not have happened without the extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused mostly by burning fossil fuels.\n\nThe “existential threat” to the reef from the climate crisis was “now realised”, the scientists wrote, and without ambitious and rapid cuts to greenhouse gas emissions “we will likely be witness to the demise of one of the Earth’s natural wonders.”\n\nThe research comes two weeks after the world heritage committee decided not to place the reef, which covers an area larger than Italy, on its list of sites “in danger”, saying it would consider the question again in 2026.\n\nGlobal heating drove a fifth mass coral bleaching event in eight years across the reef this summer that scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science called the most extensive and extreme on record this week.\n\nBefore the bleaching, the institute said surveys showed coral cover in the north and central parts of the reef was the highest since monitoring began in the early 1980s.\n\nFor the new study, scientists built a record of temperatures for the peak three-month January to March period for heat for all years from 1618 onwards.\n\nThe study found 2024 was the hottest in at least 407 years and 1.73C hotter than the average for years before 1900.\n\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nDr Benjamin Henley, lead author of the research at the University of Melbourne, said: “I was shocked when I saw that data point pop out. We had to recheck it several times. It’s shocking too to realise that, right at the point, it was the warmest January to March the Coral Sea had experienced in at least 400 years.”\n\nThe five other warmest years, in addition to 2024, were 2004, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022. Mass bleaching events were declared in five of those six hottest years.\n\nBleaching is a stress reaction to heat where the symbiotic algae that give corals their colour and nutrients is lost. Corals can recover, but are more susceptible to disease and struggle to reproduce. If temperatures remain high for too long, it can be fatal.\n\nHenley said he hoped the new findings would be considered by the Australian government and Unesco in their assessments of the risk the reef faced from global heating.\n\n“It is our assessment that the reef is in danger,” he said.\n\nMost of the 22 corals – from the long-lived Porites genus – used to reconstruct temperatures were outside the Great Barrier Reef, but inside the broader Coral Sea region.\n\nEach year, corals lay down bands of dense and less dense skeleton that scientists can count to work out how old they are. The relative amounts of the chemical strontium or the type of oxygen in these bands is dependant on the temperature of the water, and so acts as a proxy thermometer.\n\nThe reconstructed temperatures were checked against coral samples taken from the Great Barrier Reef and against modern observations of ocean temperatures.\n\nProf Helen McGregor, of the University of Wollongong and second author of the study, said the reef would face “catastrophe” if global heating is not addressed.\n\nShe said: “The very corals that have lived for hundreds of years and that gave us the data for our study are themselves under serious threat.”\n\nProf Terry Hughes, a leading expert on coral bleaching at James Cook University who was not involved in the study, said: “This new study … confirms very convincingly that coral bleaching and mass mortality in the [Great Barrier Reef] region is a modern phenomenon caused by anthropogenic heating.\n\n“It blows out of the water the persistent false claims that coral bleaching is somehow normal or cyclical.”\n\nProf Peter Mumby, a University of Queensland reef scientist who was not involved in the research, said the patterns of heat in recent years were now “well established”. But he said the study authors were “overly pessimistic” about the future because different parts of the reef and corals were not responding uniformly to the rising heat."
