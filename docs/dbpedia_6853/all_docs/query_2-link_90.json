        "text": "Achieving good nutrition in the opossum is a difficult and evolving task. This challenging aspect of opossum care is one of the reasons that diets recommended by various groups and individuals can be so diverse, and some so detrimental. The opossum as a biological organism is not forgiving of a poor diet–they WILL get sick, lose mobility, or die if they are fed inappropriately. We see many cases of Metabolic Bone Disease (nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism) in opossums that have been fed poor diets. MBD can progress to cause immobility and death, if not corrected quickly and appropriately! It is not a matter of IF the opossum will become ill, it is a matter of when!\n\nSince the National Opossum Society first published this article, we are gratified that the then widely publicized Modified Jurgelski diet has faded from most rehabilitation operations. But with the ever-expanding platforms for individuals who do not have basic knowledge of opossum nutrition, diets that are terrible for opossums continue to be promoted by various groups and individuals and websites. These assorted diets may be based on canned cat or dog food, chicken or other meats, eggs, kitten chow, dog chow, and/or include excessive amounts of applesauce, human baby cereals and foods, etc. DO NOT USE THEM! We find it interesting that many of these individuals choose to willfully violate our copyright by publishing our diet recommendations on their Facebook Pages and Groups, websites, Instagram, and links to various Cloud drives where our documents have been pirated. Many give completely unauthorized \"amendments\" to our information, or just disregard it in their own suggestions. We aren't sure why they must have it both ways, but it is reasonable to question the motives of those who simultaneously unlawfully publish and then disregard the information that NOS provides.\n\nThe diet that the National Opossum Society recommends is based on several studies wherein the stomach contents of wild opossums were analyzed. All studies show variation in diet according to season and habitat.\n\nThe following table is drawn from one of those studies, published in The Murrelet, Spring 1980, authored by David D. Hopkins and Richard B. Forbes. The study was performed on road-killed opossums in and near Portland, Oregon.\n\nmammals 27% leaf litter 11% fruits, seed, bulbs, etc. 10% gastropods 10% garbage 9% earthworms 9% pet food 9% grass, green leaves 8% insects 3% birds 3% misc. animal tissue 1%\n\nAnother study conducted in New York State in 1951 analyzed the stomach contents of 187 opossums. The study was conducted by W.J. Hamilton, Jr. and published the The Journal of Wildlife Management, Vol. 15, No. 3\n\nFruit 18.0% Amphibia 17.2% Mammals 14.2% Insects 13.4% Grasses 6.6% Worms 5.4% Reptiles 5.3% Birds 5.0% Carrion 4.8% misc. or Undetermined 6.7%\n\nPlease note this is not a diet recommendation! These studies are examples of the extreme diversity of the opossum's natural diet — one we MUST strive to mimic when we have them in our care!!\n\nCheck out the nutrient content in the foods that you are feeding at FoodData Central, the database of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\n\nAnd try the Nutrition Calculator at Alan and Shirley Casey's website."
