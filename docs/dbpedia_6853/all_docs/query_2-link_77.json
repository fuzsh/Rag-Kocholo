        "text": "Omega-3 fish oil has been a constant in Dr. Peter’s supplement list since 2011. Studies suggest that Omega-3 fatty acids (PUFA) can play a major role in reducing risk of heart disease.\n\nPeter trusts only two brands when it comes to recommending Omega-3 Fish oil supplements for his patients (Quoting Chapter 15 of his book Outlive) — Nordic Naturals and Carlson. Peter himself takes around 2 grams daily of one of two types of Omega-3 fatty acids — EPA or DHA.\n\nWith Carlson, Peter has said he prefers the liquid format. You can buy it here on iHerb or here on Amazon.\n\nPeter discusses magnesium supplementation on episode 145 of “The Peter Attia Drive”. He states that he usually starts off his patients with about 0.4 grams (400mg) of magnesium oxide if they’ve never taken any before.\n\nHe himself consumes around 0.4 to 0.5 grams of magnesium oxide or magnesium citrate daily. He usually takes 2 capsules (143 mg each) of magnesium chloride during the day and two capsules of magnesium l-threonate (96 mg each) before bed.\n\nHe categorizes magnesium in its oxide and citrate forms as the poorly absorbed type. Mentioning that it’s poor absorption can help improve your bowel function.\n\nPeter categorizes magnesium into 3 different types:\n\n1. Poorly Absorbed\n\nThese are the Oxide and Citrate forms mentioned above. These are the base of his daily intake and has said that these should be the first thing people should try if their bowel movements have slowed down.\n\nIf you want to buy Magnesium Oxide by the brand Carlson you get it on iHerb or on Amazon (links to both bring you straight to the product)\n\n2. Well Absorbed\n\nPeter says that Magnesium supplementation can cause upset stomachs, for this magnesium Chloride is a better format. Peter describes it as well absorbed and recommends it in the form of SlowMag which releases it slowly. This links to Amazon, I couldn't find it on iHerb.\n\n3. Absorbed by the brain\n\nIn order to cross the blood brain barrier Peter recommends a compound called L-Threonate which essentially binds to the magnesium. In this form it can cross the blood brain barrier. Peter has said he takes 2 capsules of L-Threonate before bed, which contains ~96 mg of elemental Magnesium.\n\nL-Threonate is a patented compound owned by the company Magtein, they license it to many supplement manufactures so no matter who you buy it from the underlying ingredient is the same. Here are some options for you:\n\nJarrow Formulas, MagMind - Get it here on iHerb or here on Amazon.\n\nPure Encapsulation, Magnesium L-Threonate (only on Amazon, could not find it on iHerb)\n\nJust like all vitamins, Peter doesn’t recommend a random and negligent use of vitamin D. We also couldn’t find many instances where Peter talks about his own Vitamin D intake.\n\nHowever, we did find an instance of him citing that the optimal range of consuming vitamin D lies between 40-60 ng/ml in 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D form. This specific instance took place when Joe Rogan interviewed him as part of episode 1735 of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast.\n\nHe also mentions that to figure out your own optimal range you’ll have to get your blood tested twice. Once prior to taking a supplement — to understand your current position — and another some time after the supplementation, to understand its effects.\n\nFrom my own research I also found that Vitamin D is known to play a critical role in building bones, producing testosterone, reducing cancer cell growth and reducing inflammation.\n\nFrom Peter's Recommended Brands\n\nVitamin D3, 125 mcg (5000 IU) by Jarrow Formulas - Get it here on iHerb or on Amazon.\n\nPure Encapsulations Vitamin D3 25 mcg (1,000 IU)\n\nAttia strongly believes in the importance of glycine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brainstem and spinal cord. His primary reason for taking glycine is to calm down the nervous system in order to go to sleep quicker.\n\nIn AMA #44, he himself cites a study which recorded the effects of 3 grams of glycine on human subjects. Results showed that the supplementation shortened the time it took for subjects to fall asleep without affecting any other aspect of their sleep system.\n\nSurprisingly, Peter also admits that more research is required to fully understand if the compound is beneficial for humans. However, he also says that he’s experienced a significant increase in the amount of sleep he gets from taking the supplement.\n\nScientific research supports this idea. For instance, I found a study showing that ingesting 0.3 grams of Ashwagandha twice a day for 10 weeks can shorten sleep onset latency and improve sleep efficiency and quality.\n\nThe latest mention Peter made of taking Rapamycin was in one of his July 2023 Instagram posts. From 2018 to 2020, Peter mentioned that he only took the drug for 8 weeks consecutively and then took a break for 6 weeks.\n\nHowever, back in September of 2021 he stated in an interview with Matt Keaberlain that he decided to start again and now takes Rapamycin once every week.\n\nPeter admits that the use of Rapamycin for its healthspan benefits hasn’t received any backing from the FDA yet. Rather, he takes the drug as a personal choice.\n\nPeter recently stated in his October 2020 interview of special guest James O’Keefe that he takes a low dose of Pravastatin, a known Statin inhibitor.\n\nSpecifically in episode 134 of The Drive podcast, somewhere around the 1 hour 48 minute mark. He unfortunately does not mention the exact dosage he takes.\n\nFurthermore, he mentions in the same interview that he’s taking a PCSK9 inhibitor but doesn’t further elaborate on the type and dosage.\n\nUpon conducting my own research, I also found a study suggesting that Statin and PCSK9 inhibitors both help reduce the risk of contracting cardiovascular diseases as you age. Primarily\n\nby increasing the availability of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) receptors.\n\nPeter generally tends to avoid taking melatonin for sleep during regular days. However, he makes an exception when he’s trying to avoid jet lag on long flights.\n\nAccording to his words, to avoid jet lag he will “slam himself ” with 0.002 to 0.005 grams (2 - 5mg) during or before his flight.\n\nOne of Peter's recommended brands Thorne does Melatonin capsules, you can get them on iHerb or on Amazon.\n\nEven though Peter talks about phosphatidylserine being an “incredibly potent” supplement that is part of his jet lag protocol, he admits that it’s not a supplement he uses regularly.\n\nIn terms of dosage, Peter takes around 0.4 to 0.6 grams of phosphatidylserine before or during the flight.\n\nHe describes his reasoning for using the supplement is to reduce cortisol and shut down his adrenals. Doing so encourages his body to sleep.\n\nGet Jarrows Formula, PS 100, 120 capsules on iHerb here or Amazon."
