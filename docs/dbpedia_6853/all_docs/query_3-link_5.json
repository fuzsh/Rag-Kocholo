        "text": "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.\n\nBy CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.\n\nTwo-time Oscar-nominee Gena Rowlands (June 19, 1930-August 14, 2024) was not only one of the most accomplished and celebrated actresses to appear in front of a camera; she was also a partner with her husband, director John Cassavetes, in crafting groundbreaking films that helped birth the independent cinema movement in the 1960s and '70s – an American counterpart to the French New Wave. Over four decades, Rowlands and Cassavetes made 10 uncompromising films outside the studio system, including \"Faces,\" \"Minnie and Moskowitz,\" \"A Woman Under the Influence,\" \"Opening Night,\" \"Gloria,\" and \"Love Streams.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Associated Press in 2015 about Cassavetes (who died in 1989), Rowlands said, \"He had a particular sympathetic interest in women and their problems in society, how they were treated and how they solved and overcame what they needed to, so all his movies have some interesting women.\"\n\nRowlands earned Oscar nominations for her performances in 1974's \"A Woman Under the Influence,\" playing a housewife and mother whose drinking barely masks her vulnerability and chaotic efforts to please; and \"Gloria\" (1980), as a chain-smoking, gun-toting former mobster's moll trying to protect a young boy from murderers while wearing five-inch heels.\n\nIn 2001 she told The Guardian, \"We totally financed all the films ourselves, except for 'A Woman Under the Influence,' for which [co-star] Peter Falk and his wife paid half. After John had done the screenplay for it, everyone said: 'Why does anyone want to see a picture about a crazy middle-aged dame?' But we were luckier than a lot of young directors now, because we were both established actors, and when we ran out of money (which was all the time), we would stop and each make a movie. It's harder for young writers and directors now, unless they are very wealthy, because whoever puts up the money always has a lot to say.\"\n\nShe and Cassavetes met at the American School of Dramatic Arts, and married four months later. As Cassavetes pursued acting and directing (he financed his first feature, \"Shadows,\" with the money he earned from the TV series \"Johnny Staccato\"), Rowlands appeared on live TV and the stage. A role in Paddy Chayefsky's play \"Middle of the Night\" opposite Edward G. Robinson took her to Hollywood, to appear in \"The High Cost of Loving.\" Other films included \"Lonely Are the Brave\" with Kirk Douglas; \"The Spiral Road\"; \"A Child Is Waiting\" (directed by Cassavetes); \"Two Minute Warning\"; \"Tempest\" (directed by Paul Mazursky, and co-starring Cassavetes and Molly Ringwald in her screen debut); Woody Allen's \"Another Woman\"; Paul Schrader's \"Light of Day\"; and Jim Jarmusch's \"Night on Earth.\" She also starred in the TV movie \"An Early Frost,\" as the mother of a young man with AIDS.\n\nHer son, Nick Cassavetes, also a director, featured Rowlands in the film version of Nicholas Sparks' \"The Notebook,\" in which she played a woman with dementia, hearing the story of a long-ago romance.\n\nRowlands won three Primetime Emmy Awards (\"The Betty Ford Story,\" \"Face of a Stranger,\" and \"Hysterical Blindness\"), and a Daytime Emmy (\"The Incredible Mrs. Ritchie\").\n\nAccepting an honorary Oscar from the motion picture academy in 2015, Rowlands said, \"You know what's wonderful about being an actress? You don't just live one life. You live many lives.\"\n\nAbdul \"Duke\" Fakir\n\nAbdul \"Duke\" Fakir (December 26, 1935-July 22, 2024) was the last surviving original member of the Motown group The Four Tops, known for such hits as \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch),\" \"Reach Out I'll Be There,\" and \"Baby I Need Your Loving.\"\n\nFakir was not related to his singing partners – Levi Stubbs, Renaldo \"Obie\" Benson, and Lawrence Payton – but they were brothers on the stage since 1954 when they started as the Four Ames, poor kids growing up in Detroit singing on street corners. They spent their early years in small, often segregated clubs, polishing their stage act and versatile vocal style.\n\nThey finally burst forth in 1964, when Barry Gordy's Motown Records put out \"Baby, I Need Your Loving.\" It was a hit. \"We were selling records with 'Baby, I Need Your Loving,'\" Fakir recalled for \"Sunday Morning\" in 1990. \"My mama was really in a bad way. I just asked Barry for an advance. He said, 'Well, how much you need?' And I said, 'About 10,000.' He said, 'What is this for?' And I said, 'I'm going to buy my mama a house.' He said, 'Well, here, take 20,000.' So I just went and bought her a house. Then I bought me 50 pairs of shoes and a Cadillac.\"\n\nBetween 1964 and 1967, The Four Tops had 11 Top 20 hits, including \"It's the Same Old Song,\" \"Something About You,\" \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over),\" \"Standing in the Shadows of Love,\" \"Bernadette,\" and \"You Keep Running Away.\" They also released three albums paired with The Supremes.\n\nThe hits were fewer after 1970, though 1973's \"Ain't No Woman (Like the One I Got),\" reached #4 when released by ABC/Dunhill, and 1981's \"When She Was My Girl,\" on the Casablanca label, hit #11. But the group, which had separated from Motown when Gordy moved the company to Los Angeles, had money in the bank, and a plan. Fakir recalled, \"We had a meeting about that – 'Look, I think it's slowing down here. It's not coming in every day. It's not falling out the sky, OK? And it's not going to keep doing that. So, now we've got to prepare. If you're not prepared, then let's start preparing for the future and let's take this nice little calm period, enjoy your families, and we'll work when we work and we'll just cool off.'\"\n\nBetween 1981 and 1995 they released six albums, including \"Indestructible.\" But the band's lineup changed with the deaths of Payton in 1997, Benson in 2005, and Stubbs in 2008. Fakir continued touring with new members (including Payton's son, Lawrence Jr.).\n\n\"As each one of them (the original members) passed a little bit of me left with them,\" Fakir told UK Music Reviews in 2021. \"When Levi left us, I found myself in a quandary as to what I was going to do from that moment on, but after a while I realized that the name together with the legacy that they had left us simply had to carry on, and judging by the audience reaction, it soon became pretty evident that I did the right thing and I really do feel good about that.\"\n\nThe Four Tops were voted into the Rock Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame. Fakir wrote a 2022 memoir, \"I'll Be There,\" and was working on a planned Broadway musical based on their lives.\n\nJohn Mayall\n\nBritish blues musician and songwriter John Mayall (November 29, 1933-July 22, 2024), whose band the Bluesbreakers was a training ground for Eric Clapton, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and others, was credited with helping develop the English take on Chicago-style R&B. The writer of \"I'm Your Witchdoctor\", \"Crawling Up a Hill\" and \"Don't Waste My Time,\" Mayall was still performing in his late 80s – and was proud of his low profile.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\" He said he played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\nOften called the \"father of British blues,\" Mayall's Bluesbreakers would feature a changing roster of players that included some of the most noteworthy musicians of the era, including Clapton, Fleetwood, McVie, Peter Green, Dick Heckstall-Smith, Jon Hiseman, Harvey Mandel, Jon Mark, Randy Resnick, Larry Taylor, Mick Taylor, Rick Vito and Ernie Watts.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht that Mayall gave his fellow bandmates wide latitude to solo. \"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall made a permanent move to the U.S. in the late '60s, marked by his 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon.\" He disbanded the Bluesbreakers, and in 1969 released the live album \"The Turning Point.\" He would reform the Bluesbreakers, but then retired the name and performed as the John Mayall Band.\n\nSheila Jackson-Lee\n\nCongresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (January 12, 1950-July 19, 2024) helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence, and to have Juneteenth (the anniversary of when the last enslaved people in America gained their freedom) recognized as a federal holiday.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before being elected to the city council in 1989, and later ran for Congress. The Texas Democrat represented her Houston-based district since 1995 (a seat once held by Barbara Jordan), and served on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nShe quickly established herself as a fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues. Her rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nBob Newhart\n\nComedian Bob Newhart (September 5, 1929-July 18, 2024), with his classic comedy albums and two hit sitcoms on CBS, \"The Bob Newhart Show\" (1972-78) and \"Newhart\" (1982-90), played it clean and sweet. A minimalist, his observational humor, delivered with perfect deadpan timing, cloaked a subversive streak in conjuring ridiculous situations, as when a newly-minted guard at the Empire State Building struggles to find in his employee's manual how to deal with King Kong climbing the façade.\n\n\"That's the way I've always considered my comedy, is being the last sane man and going to people and saying, 'Excuse me, but isn't this crazy?'\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2002.\n\nBorn outside of Chicago during the Great Depression, with a stammer that only seemed to accentuate his dry wit, Newhart served in the Army, flunked out of law school, and became an accountant. He admits he wasn't good with numbers, but he was good at making people laugh. Delivery was key. He admitted that while his pieces might not seem funny on paper (a Madison Avenue ad man criticizing Abe Lincoln's Gettysburg Address), his cadences would sell them.\n\nHe actually started off with a writing partner, but after they split up, Newhart performed solo, reacting to an unseen partner on the other end of his phone conversations – which made the bits even funnier. Here he is imagining the boss back in Old England getting a phone call from Sir Walter Raleigh about a New World discovery: \"Are, are you saying snuff, Walt? Uh-huh. And what's snuff? … You take a pinch of tobacco and … and you stick it up your nose, and … and it makes you sneeze. I imagine it would, Walt, yeah.\"\n\nA disc jockey friend sent a tape of Newhart's routines to scouts from Warner Brothers Records. \"So, they listened to them, and they said, `Oh, we think they're funny and we'll record you at your next nightclub.' And then I said, 'Well, see, we have a problem there. Because I've never played a nightclub.' They said, 'Well, then we're going to have to get you in a nightclub.' So, they got me into a club in Houston, Texas, called The Tidelands.\"\n\nHe hit it big in 1960, with three Grammy Awards for his debut album, \"The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart\" (which won album of the year), and its follow-up, \"The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!\" (best comedy performance – spoken word). He beat out Harry Belafonte, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. \"I don't think Frank was thrilled that a stand-up comic beat out his album!\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2020.\n\nHe headlined an NBC variety show in the 1960s (earning his first Emmy nomination for writing), and made appearances on variety shows like \"The Ed Sullivan Show,\" \"The Hollywood Palace,\" \"The Andy Williams Show,\" and \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.\"\n\nHe starred in \"The Bob Newhart Show,\" as a Chicago psychologist, married to Suzanne Pleshette. (He would reprise the role in a cameo on \"Murphy Brown.\") He returned in \"Newhart,\" playing a Vermont innkeeper, married to Mary Frann. After eight seasons, the finale featured a classic ending, riffing on a plot twist from \"Dallas\": The entire series was a dream, as Newhart wakes up in bed with his first TV wife, Pleshette. \"It was my wife's idea,\" Newhart said. \"The audience went nuts.\"\n\nHe also starred in the series \"Bob,\" and \"George & Leo,\" with Judd Hirsch, and had guest roles on \"ER,\" \"Desperate Housewives,\" \"NCIS,\" \"The Librarians,\" \"Young Sheldon,\" and \"The Big Bang Theory\" (for which he won an Emmy). Film appearances included \"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,\" \"Catch 22,\" \"Cold Turkey,\" \"First Family\" (as a boring president), \"In & Out,\" \"Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde,\" and the Will Ferrell comedy \"Elf.\"\n\nIn 2002, he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. His memoir, \"I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This,\" was published four years later.\n\nHe told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"People come up to me. And they say, `Thanks for all the laughter.' And I say, 'It was my pleasure.' And that's the truth.\"\n\nRichard Simmons\n\nThe flamboyant and effervescent fitness guru Richard Simmons (July 12, 1948-July 13, 2024) was a chubby boy with the birth name Milton. (He renamed himself Richard around age 10 to improve his self-image). Growing up in New Orleans, he ate to excess, ballooning to 268 pounds as a teenager, and was teased by schoolmates. As a foreign exchange student in Italy, he did peanut butter commercials and was an extra in \"Fellini Satyricon.\" \"I was fat, had curly hair,\" he told the Associated Press. \"The Italians thought I was hysterical. I was the life of the party.\"\n\nBut then he received an anonymous letter: \"It said, 'Dear Richard, you're very funny, but fat people die young. Please don't die.'\" Stunned, he went on a starvation diet that jeopardized his health. He eventually mastered a regimen that kept his weight in check.\n\nSimmons shared his hard-won weight-loss tips on TV — the Emmy-winning \"Richard Simmons Show\" — and in bestselling books. He also opened exercise studios and starred in exercise videos, including the \"Sweatin' to the Oldies\" series. He counseled the severely obese, and put real people in his exercise videos to make exercise relatable and fitness goals seem reachable.\n\nThroughout his career, Simmons was a reliable critic of fad diets, always emphasizing healthy eating and exercise plans. In 2010 \"Sunday Morning\" asked Simmons what percentage of diets were snake oil. \"I'm going to say that most probably ninety-five percent are not based on nutrition, moving, and motivation. I think most of them are quick fixes. … I'm proud to say that I never put my name on anything, unless it's what I really believed in my heart.\"\n\nAnd what he believed was that people weren't overweight; they were under-exercised, and the secret to better fitness was to keep \"moving and grooving.\"\n\nShannen Doherty\n\nA native of Memphis, Shannen Doherty (April 12, 1971-July 13, 2024) moved to Los Angeles with her family at age 7. Within a few years, she became an actor, working steadily in TV (including recurring roles in \"Little House on the Prairie\" and \"Our House\") and in films (\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun,\" \"Heathers\"). In 1990, she broke out playing Brenda Walsh in the hit teen melodrama, \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" a role she'd reprise when the show was rebooted as \"90210.\"\n\nHer fame grew with the series \"Charmed,\" and roles in \"Mallrats,\" \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,\" \"A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story,\" and \"Satan's School for Girls.\" She competed on \"Dancing with the Stars\" in 2010.\n\nBut Doherty's celebrity was colored by tabloid fame, including two brief marriages, Playboy pictorials, and accounts of drinking. In 1997 she was sentenced to anger-management counseling after allegedly smashing a beer bottle onto a man's windshield during a quarrel.\n\nHer breast cancer was revealed in a 2015 lawsuit filed against her ex-business managers, whom she alleged mismanaged her money and allowed her health insurance to lapse. In 2016 she publicly shared intimate details of her radiation treatment, including her baldness, following a single mastectomy. Four years later, Doherty revealed that the cancer had returned and was at stage four. It would later spread to her brain and bones.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with \"Entertainment Tonight,\" she said, \"The unknown is always the scariest part. Is the chemo going to work? Is the radiation going to work? Pain is manageable, you know, living without a breast is manageable; it's the worry of your future and how your future is going to affect the people that you love.\"\n\nDr. Ruth Westheimer\n\nEven at 4'7\", sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer (June 4, 1928-July 12, 2024) had an outsized impact as a radio and TV host and bestselling author by talking freely and enthusiastically about sexual relations. She became a media star by encouraging dialogue about taboo subjects, and better communications surrounding \"sexual literacy.\"\n\n\"I still hold old-fashioned values and I'm a bit of a square,\" she told students at Michigan City High School in 2002. \"Sex is a private art and a private matter. But still, it is a subject we must talk about.\"\n\nShe was born Karola Ruth Siegel in Frankfurt, Germany. When she was 10 her parents sent her to a Swiss boarding school, to save her from the Nazis. She never saw her parents again. \"I'm grateful that I'm alive,\" she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2002. \"And I have an obligation to contribute something to this world, because otherwise, you know, why was I spared?\"\n\nA sex therapist with a Ph.D. in education who taught at Lehman College in the Bronx, Westheimer was asked in the 1980s to go on the radio to talk about birth control and unwanted pregnancies. She told \"Sunday Morning\" that she didn't shy away from a new medium. \"I didn't start saying, 'Oh, my gosh, I don't know how to do radio. How can I ever do that?' I said, 'I'll try.' That's my philosophy of life.\"\n\nHer daily 15-minute radio spots, broadcast at midnight, grew into two-hour call-in shows. Then came TV (\"The Dr. Ruth Show,\" \"Good Sex with Dr. Ruth Westheimer\") and talk show guest appearances, making words like \"penis\" and \"vagina\" commonplace on the air. She wrote advice columns and more than 40 books, appeared in home videos, and even headlined a board game.\n\nHer rise as an unlikely pop culture icon coincided with the early days of the AIDS epidemic, which gave frank talk about sex urgency. \"If we could bring about talking about sexual activity the way we talk about diet – the way we talk about food – without it having this kind of connotation that there's something not right about it, then we would be a step further. But we have to do it with good taste,\" she told Johnny Carson in 1982.\n\nWestheimer defended abortion rights, suggested older people have sex after a good night's sleep, advocated condom use, and supported the LGBTQ community.\n\nAnd her industry went beyond taboo-breaking talk about sex that would make David Letterman blush. She also narrated a children's recording that was nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\nBill Viola\n\nBill Viola (January 25, 1951-July 12, 2024) was a pioneer in creative and immersive installations of video art, often manipulating time with high-speed cameras.\n\n\"You realize after a while, working with it, that time becomes your basic raw material,\" Viola told \"Sunday Morning\" in 1998. \"Time is like a palette of colors, and the whole society is focused on one narrow range of those colors, represented by the clock.\"\n\nViola studied visual art and electronic music at Syracuse University and received a BFA in Experimental Studios. In Florence, Italy, he was technical director of production for Art/Tapes/22, one of the first video art studios in Europe, and was later artist-in-residence at WNET Channel 13 Television Laboratory in New York City. Traveling the world, he recorded mirages in the Sahara, Buddhist rituals in Tibet, and traditional performances in the Solomon Islands and Indonesia.\n\nViola represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 1995. The installation featured his work \"The Greeting,\" which mimics a Renaissance painting of three women meeting each other. Their 45-second interaction is stretched into 10 minutes, where every moment becomes a wellspring of meaning and emotion.\n\nOther notable works include the enigmatic \"Five Angels for the Millennium\" (2001), featuring multiple projections in which performers are captured with underwater cameras in slow motion; and \"Tristan's Ascension\" (2005), in which a torrent of water pours onto a prone figure, run in slow-motion in reverse.\n\nHe also collaborated with composers and theatrical directors to create multimedia presentations and music videos, including a production of Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde,\" and a three-song video suite for Nine Inch Nails.\n\nAs much as his art is magnified by the technical presentation, the works also reflect the artist's spiritual quest. \"I have this love-hate relationship with technology,\" Viola told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I consider it to be both the obstacle and the pathway to working.\"\n\nShelley Duvall\n\nActress Shelley Duvall (July 7, 1949-July 11, 2024) exuded a refreshing and rare naturalism in her performances, most notably in several films directed by Robert Altman, and in the Stanley Kubrick horror classic \"The Shining.\"\n\nDuvall was a 20-year-old junior college student in Texas in 1970 when she was introduced to Altman, who cast her in \"Brewster McCloud,\" despite her protestations that she wasn't an actress. \"Yes, you are,\" she recalled being told. Duvall would go on to appear in Altman's \"McCabe & Ms. Miller,\" \"Thieves Like Us,\" \"Nashville,\" \"Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson,\" \"Popeye,\" and \"3 Women,\" for which she won the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\"He offers me damn good roles,\" Duvall told The New York Times in 1977. \"None of them have been alike. He has a great confidence in me, and a trust and respect for me, and he doesn't put any restrictions on me or intimidate me, and I love him. I remember the first advice he ever gave me: 'Don't take yourself seriously.'\"\n\nShe appeared as a Rolling Stone journalist covering a \"transplendent\" concert featuring the Maharishi in Woody Allen's \"Annie Hall.\" But her most vivid role was as Wendy Torrance, trapped at the isolated Overlook Hotel with a husband going insane, in \"The Shining.\" Her performance as the wounded soul of a woman and mother with an abusive partner heightened the fear of Stephen King's story, as she sought to protect her little boy from horrors real and imagined (?).\n\nIn the 1980s, she produced and hosted several TV series for children, including \"Faerie Tale Theatre,\" \"Tall Tales & Legends\" and \"Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories.\" She received two Emmy Award nominations.\n\nShe moved back to Texas when her brother was diagnosed with spinal cancer in the 1990s. She largely retreated from Hollywood after making the 2002 comedy \"Manna from Heaven.\" An interview with Dr. Phil in 2016 stirred concern about her mental health, and about exploitation by the media.\n\nDuvall returned to the screen in 2023 in the indie horror film \"The Forest Hills.\" \"Acting again – it's so much fun,\" Duvall told People magazine. \"It enriches your life.\"\n\nRobert Towne\n\nScreenwriter Robert Towne (November 23, 1934-July 1, 2024) was acclaimed not only for the scripts that bore his name – \"The Last Detail,\" \"Shampoo,\" \"Chinatown\" (for which he won an Academy Award) – but also those for which he provided anonymous script doctoring, including \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and \"The Godfather.\"\n\nTowne cut his teeth on TV (\"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,\" \"The Outer Limits,\" \"The Lloyd Bridges Show\") and B-movies for producer Roger Corman (\"Last Woman on Earth,\" \"Tomb of Ligeia\"). In a showbiz story that rivals Lana Turner being discovered at the soda counter at Schwab's Pharmacy, Towne was said to owe his first big break to his psychiatrist, through whom he met a fellow patient, Warren Beatty. The actor-producer asked Towne to revise the Robert Benton-David Newman script for \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" and invited him to the set during filming.\n\nThe movie, though controversial for its violence, became a modern classic. And while Benton and Newman shared an Oscar nomination, the anonymous Towne launched a career as an uncredited ghostwriter and script doctor. He contributed to the screenplays of \"The Godfather\" (creating Vito and Michael Corleone's father-son talk in the garden), \"Drive, He Said, \" \"McCabe & Mrs. Miller,\" \"The Parallax View,\" \"The Missouri Breaks\" and \"Heaven Can Wait\" – films that heralded a revolutionary new cinema in the 1970s.\n\nHe won an Oscar for his original screenplay for \"Chinatown,\" Roman Polanski's acidic take on corruption in 1930s Los Angeles. Inspired by the works of Raymond Chandler, and by the real-life machinations behind L.A.'s expansion, Towne crafted a film noir classic that featured iconic performances by Jack Nicholson (Towne's former roommate), Faye Dunaway and John Huston.\n\nIn 2009 he told The Hollywood Reporter the origin of \"Chinatown\" was a book he checked out of the library called \"Southern California Country: Island on the Land,\" which covered the perilous history of water in Los Angeles. \"I thought, 'Why not do a picture about a crime that's right out in front of everybody? Instead of a jewel-encrusted falcon, make it something as prevalent as water faucets, and make a conspiracy out of that. And after reading about what they were doing, dumping water and starving the farmers out of their land, I realized the visual and dramatic possibilities were enormous. So, that was really the beginning of it.\"\n\nBut the ending became a source of contention; Towne wanted Huston's character to die and Dunaway's to live; Polanski wanted the opposite, and filmed it that way.\n\nTowne wrote what was essentially half a screenplay for \"Greystoke,\" building on the legend of Tarzan, and traded away his rights to the hot property for money to complete his directorial debut, \"Personal Best.\" \"Chariots of Fire\" director Hugh Hudson came in and finished \"Greystoke\" with another writer. Dismissive of the finished product, Towne took his name off the script, replacing it with that of his sheepdog. Hollywood being Hollywood, the dog, \"P.H. Vazak,\" earned an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay.\n\nTowne directed his own script for \"Tequila Sunrise,\" and wrote a sequel to \"Chinatown,\" called \"The Two Jakes,\" which Nicholson directed. He also wrote the screenplays of several Tom Cruise films, including \"Days of Thunder,\" \"The Firm,\" and two \"Mission: Impossible\" entries.\n\nMartin Mull\n\nComedian Martin Mull (August 18, 1943-June 27, 2024) played characters, and himself, with a droll, sardonic edge – a casualness that was hip and arresting, whether in sitcoms like \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,\" \"Fernwood Tonight,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Arrested Development\" and \"Veep,\" to appearances on late-night talk shows.\n\nBorn in Chicago and raised in Ohio and Connecticut, Mull studied art in Rhode Island and Rome. As a songwriter and guitar player, he mixed music and comedy in his club act in the 1970s. Norman Lear saw him perform at the Roxy on the Sunset Strip and cast him as wife beater Garth Gimble on his satirical soap opera, \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.\" Garth would meet an untimely end. But Mull returned as Garth's twin brother, talk show host Barth Gimble, in the spin-off series, \"Fernwood Tonight.\"\n\nMull's films included \"FM,\" \"My Bodyguard,\" \"Serial,\" \"Mr. Mom,\" \"Rented Lips,\" \"Clue,\" \"The Player,\" and \"A Futile and Stupid Gesture.\" TV credits included \"Taxi,\" \"Square Pegs,\" \"It's Garry Shandling's Show,\" the mockumentary \"A History of White People in America,\" \"Dream On,\" \"The Larry Sanders Show,\" \"The Nanny,\" \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch,\" \"The Ellen Show,\" \"American Dad!,\" \"Two and a Half Men,\" \"Community,\" and \"Not Dead Yet.\"\n\nHe earned an Emmy nomination for his guest appearance on \"Veep,\" playing a political aide with Alzheimer's.\n\nAnd he never gave up painting, with exhibitions and gallery shows, noting that sales to Hollywood stars with many houses to decorate \"pays for a lot of paint.\" In a 2020 interview with the Rhode Island School of Design, Mull said that he'd paint while waiting to be called to the set when filming. \"I did a movie for Disney … called 'Beverly Hills Family Robinson.' You can tell by the title how bad a film this was. In the jungles of Australia. And there's a lot of downtime, always, with movie-making. And so while the sound was resetting I had a whole thing of watercolors in my trailer. I did a whole show, that show that I had in New York, sitting in my trailer just waiting for the next take.\"\n\nKinky Friedman\n\nProudly politically incorrect, the larger-than-life Texan Kinky Friedman (November 1, 1944-June 27, 2024) made a career out of shooting from the lip, whether it was as a satirical country musician, a writer of bestselling mystery novels (starring himself), or a candidate for political office.\n\nFriedman, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, earned a cult following, and a reputation as a provocateur. In the 1970s he led a country band mischievously named Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys, singing such songs as \"They Ain't Makin' Jews Like Jesus Anymore,\" \"The Ballad of Charles Whitman\" (an ode to the Texas Tower sniper), and \"Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in Bed.\" [The National Organization of Women did not approve.] Friedman also toured with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, Friedman also wrote crime novels, often starring a fictional version of himself, including \"Greenwich Killing Time,\" \"When the Cat's Away,\" \"Elvis, Jesus and Coca-Cola,\" \"Armadillos and Old Lace\" and \"The Love Song of J. Edgar Hoover.\" Humor collections included \"Kinky Friedman's Guide to Texas Etiquette: Or How To Get To Heaven Or Hell Without Going Through Dallas-Fort Worth.\" He also penned a column for Texas Monthly magazine.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton related the story of when he invited Friedman to the White House, and the singer presented him with an illegal Cuban cigar. \"And he said, 'I want you to have this, Mr. President.' I said, 'Do you know what you're doing to me?' And everybody's looking, right? There's 50 or 60 people staring right at him. He said, 'Don't think of it as helping their economy. Think of it as burning their fields.' And the whole crowd just cracked up!\"\n\nFriedman ran for Texas Governor in 2006 as an independent, with the slogan, \"How Hard Could It Be?\" Some saw the campaign as another Friedman joke, but he insisted it was serious. His platform called for legalizing medical marijuana, boosting public education spending through casino gambling, and backing same-sex marriage. \"I support gay marriage,\" he told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"because I believe they have a right to be just as miserable as the rest of us.\" He came in fourth, with 12.4% of the vote.\n\nBut not all of his energies were to the humorous, or the Quixotic. In the 1990s he founded an animal rescue, Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch, in Medina, Texas, where he saved more than a thousand dogs and cats from being euthanized, and housed strays awaiting adoption. \"I have always felt that what we do when a stray spirit crosses our path – how we react to the hungry, homeless stranger – is indubitably a measure of our own humanity,\" he wrote in Texas Monthly in 2005.\n\n\"Mark Twain once said that when you meet Saint Peter, it's best to leave your dog outside. Heaven, he claimed, runs on protocol. If it ran on merit, your dog would go in and you would stay outside. While I agree with Twain, I see things a little differently. I believe that when you die and go to Heaven, all the dogs and cats you've ever had in your life come running to meet you.\"\n\nDonald Sutherland\n\nCanadian actor Donald Sutherland (July 17, 1935-June 20, 2024) brought a terrific off-kilter quality to his performances in a six-decade career that stretched from heroes to anti-heroes, from leading man to reliable character actor. He became most identified with his roles in the counter-culture war comedy \"MASH,\" the wrenching family drama \"Ordinary People,\" the farcical \"National Lampoon's Animal House,\" the conspiracy thriller \"JFK,\" and the dystopian \"Hunger Games\" series – a testament to his incredible range.\n\nIn his time Sutherland portrayed a wealth of rebels, ruffians and iconoclasts, whose distaste for playing by the rules was searing, and often very funny. So strong was the stamp of a Sutherland rebel that, when he did play a figure of authority, tradition, or cloak-and-dagger subterfuge, the audience was forgiven for believing that his tongue - when speaking of order and control - was very much in his cheek.\n\nBorn in New Brunswick and raised in Nova Scotia, Sutherland switched his studies from engineering to English and began acting while at university. He later attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and appeared on stage in the West End and on U.K. television. His early film credits included the British \"Dr. Terror's House of Horrors.\"\n\nHis first major Hollywood role was in \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), as the psychopathic prisoner-turned-commando Vernon Pinkley. Sutherland's star burned even brighter with his roles in a pair of anti-establishment war films: as nonconformist Army surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"MASH,\" and as a tank commander (nicknamed \"Oddball\") who helps plot a gold heist in the WWII comedy \"Kelly's Heroes.\"\n\n\"There is more challenge in character roles,\" Sutherland told The Washington Post in 1970. \"There's longevity. A good character actor can show a different face in every film and not bore the public.\"\n\nSutherland never bored the public. He would amass nearly 200 film and TV credits, including \"Klute,\" \"Don't Look Now,\" \"The Day of the Locust,\" \"1900,\" \"Casanova,\" \"The Eagle Has Landed,\" \"The Great Train Robbery,\" \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" \"Ordinary People,\" \"Eye of the Needle,\" \"A Dry White Season,\" \"Backdraft,\" \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"Six Degrees of Separation,\" \"A Time to Kill,\" \"Disclosure,\" \"Outbreak,\" \"Space Cowboys,\" \"The Italian Job,\" \"Cold Mountain,\" \"Pride & Prejudice,\" \"Trust,\" \"Ad Astra,\" and \"Lawman: Bass Reeves.\" He appeared with his son Kiefer Sutherland in the western \"Forsaken.\" To younger viewers, he was best known as President Coriolanus Snow in \"The Hunger Games\" films.\n\nFollowing \"MASH,\" Sutherland joined his \"Klute\" costar Jane Fonda in the Free Theater Associates, which produced a 1971 tour of \"The FTA Show,\" a sort of anti-U.S.O. revue at a time when anti-war sentiment was rising. They performed for servicemembers off the premises of military bases in the U.S. and overseas.\n\nThough never nominated for an Oscar, Sutherland received an honorary Academy Award in 2017. He won an Emmy, in 1995 for the TV film \"Citizen X,\" and two Golden Globes, for \"Citizen X\" and the 2003 TV film \"Path to War.\"\n\nIn a 2017 interview for \"60 Minutes,\" Sutherland discussed how he would immerse himself into his characters, who might not seem sympathetic from an audience's point of view, \"but they're sympathetic to me.\"\n\nAsked how he finds something in each role, Sutherland replied, \"I don't find it. It finds me. I mean, I will read it. And suddenly, it starts churning around inside me. And then, it gets violent. And then, it gets loving. And it's an extraordinary thing. It gets more and more and more exciting. It's delicious.\"\n\nA memoir, \"Made Up, But Still True,\" is scheduled to be published in November.\n\nGallery: Donald Sutherland\n\nWillie Mays\n\nThe talent, drive and exuberance of Willie Mays (May 6, 1931-June 18, 2024) made him one of baseball's greatest players, and possibly the most beloved by fans.\n\nThe son of a Negro League player, Mays himself was a gifted athlete who began his professional career in the Negro Leagues in 1948, before being brought into the majors by the New York Giants. But when he first arrived, Mays was hitless in his first series. In 1979 he told \"Sunday Morning\" how Giants manager Leo Durocher boosted his confidence: \"Leo gave me what you call motivation. The only thing he told me, just a couple lines: 'You'll be my center fielder as long as I'm manager here, and you really don't have to hit. Just go out and play center field.' And I think by saying that, I think I relaxed a little bit, and I just started hitting without any problem.\" In fact, in his first year with the Giants, Mays hit .274 with 127 hits, including 20 homers, and scored 59 runs, earning him the National League Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nOver 23 seasons, beginning with the Birmingham Black Barons in the Negro Leagues, and then with the Giants, in New York and San Francisco, and then back in New York with the Mets, Mays racked up 3,293 hits, including 660 home runs (only Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron, at that time, had more), 1,909 RBIs, and a .301 batting average, not to mention 339 stolen bases, a Gold Glove, and two MVP Awards.\n\nBut from his entire career on the field, his most memorable play was undoubtedly \"The Catch,\" in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series. With the score tied in the top of the eighth and with two men on base, Cleveland's Vic Mertz hit a drive deep to center field. Racing to the wall, Mays made a basket catch over his shoulder, his back to home plate, and quickly turned to fire the ball back to the infield, preventing two or three runs. The Giants won the game, and the championship.\n\nMays talked with \"Sunday Morning\" about the importance of being what he called a \"complete ball player.\" \"You can't just run and not hit, or hit home runs, or hit for a batting average. I was active on the ball field, and I had to please the stand just as well as [if] I was on stage or something. When I went to the ball park, I tried to do things a little different sometimes and make sure the fans got their money's worth.\"\n\nMays' exuberance earned him the nickname \"Say Hey Kid,\" and his attention to young fans earned him lasting affection. In 2011, visiting the site of the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, Mays talked of how youngsters would invite him to play in their stickball games. \"I used to have maybe 10 kids come to my window,\" he said. \"Every morning, they'd come at 9 o'clock. They'd knock on my window, get me up. … They'd give me a chance to go shower. They'd give me a chance to eat breakfast. But I had to be out there at 9:30, because that's when they wanted to play. So, I played with them for about maybe an hour.\"\n\nMays was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1979 (his first year of eligibility). In 2015 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nWilliam Anders\n\n\"It was ironic that we'd done all this work to come and explore the moon, and what we really discovered was the Earth,\" astronaut William Anders (Oct. 17, 1933-June 7, 2024), a member of the Apollo 8 crew, told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2018.\n\nFifty years prior, on Christmas Eve, Anders, James Lovell and Frank Borman became the first humans to orbit the moon. Describing the crater-covered lunar surface proved almost as difficult as getting there. \"I said that it looked like dirty beach sand,\" Anders recalled. \"That's how I described it, thus gaining the wrath of poets worldwide!\"\n\nBut it was a photo that Anders took of the Earth, rising above the moon like a big blue marble, that brought all of humanity – everything that mankind had ever known – together in a brilliant, fragile image. Anders took some of the precious little film they had on board – film that was supposed to be used for capturing the moon – to take the picture of our home world. Anders said, \"Even though that wasn't in the flight plan ... hell with that, you know? Here was a beautiful shot.\"\n\nKnown as \"Earthrise,\" it became one of the most reproduced images ever, in part because no other photograph summed up our place in the universe quite like it. It was reproduced on a postage stamp, and became a catalyst for the environmental movement. Life magazine featured it on the cover of its 2003 anthology, \"100 Photographs That Changed the World.\"\n\nBorn in Hong Kong (his father was a Navy officer), Anders was graduated from the Naval Academy, but accepted his wings in the Air Force, rising to major. He also earned a master's degree in nuclear engineering, before joining NASA.\n\nRetiring from active duty following the Apollo mission, Anders served on the National Aeronautics and Space Council, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and as ambassador to Norway. He retired from the Air Force Reserve as a major general in 1988, and co-founded the Heritage Flight Museum in Bellingham, Wash.\n\nRichard Sherman\n\n\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" may appear unspeakable, but it's one of the most fondly remembered lyrics from the songwriting team the Sherman Brothers, who created catchy classics for \"Mary Poppins,\" \"The Jungle Book\" and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" – songs that were infectious, ubiquitous and unforgettable.\n\n\"They call it an earworm – you know, you can't get it out of your ear. It just crawls in there and stays,\" Richard Sherman (June 12, 1928-May 25, 2024) told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2013. He was clear-eyed about their theme park perennial, \"It's a Small World (After All),\" introduced at the 1964 World's Fair. In a 2011 appearance at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, Sherman said of the reaction to that song, \"People either want to kiss us or kill us!\"\n\nGrowing up, older brother Robert Sherman aspired to write novels; Richard, symphonies. One day their songwriting father gave them a challenge: \"'I bet you couldn't team up together and write a song that some kid would give up his lunch money to buy a record of it … Yeah, I don't think you have enough brains to do that.' And he turned around and left,\" Richard recalled.\n\nWithin a decade the brothers had had hits recorded by Annette Funicello (\"Tall Paul,\" \"Wild Willie\"), Johnny Burnette (\"You're Sixteen\"), and Fabian (\"Got the Feeling\").\n\nFor movies, Richard and Robert became one of the most prolific songwriting duos of all time, from comedies (\"Summer Magic,\" \"The Happiest Millionaire,\" \"Follow Me, Boys!,\" \"The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band,\" \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\"), to animation (\"The Sword in the Stone,\" \"Winnie the Pooh,\" \"The Aristocats,\" \"Charlotte's Web,\" \"Snoopy Come Home\"), to musicals (\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,\" \"Tom Sawyer,\" \"The Slipper and the Rose\").\n\nBut their most famous tunes were from \"Mary Poppins,\" inspired by P.L. Travers' magical nanny. \"A Spoonful of Sugar,\" \"Chim Chim Cher-ee,\" \"Jolly Holiday,\" \"Let's Go Fly a Kite,\" and the irrepressibly bouncy \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\"\n\nOh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\n\nEven though the sound of it is something quite atrocious\n\nIf you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious\n\nSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious\n\nTheir music for \"Mary Poppins\" earned the Sherman Brothers two Academy Awards.\n\nIn a 1969 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Robert Sherman (who died in 2012) explained the songwriting approach taken by himself and Richard: \"We don't like the dark side of things, and we only want to entertain people. We like singable songs as opposed to, say, performers' songs. We don't write for someone, we write for everyone.\"\n\nCaleb Carr\n\n\"I wouldn't describe myself as a miserable person, but there are those who would say that my outlook on humanity is pretty miserable,\" writer Caleb Carr (August 2, 1955-May 23, 2024) told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2005. He came to wide attention with his bestselling 1994 novel \"The Alienist,\" about the hunt for a serial killer in 19th century New York City, in a neighborhood that, he wrote, \"knew little of laws, man-made or otherwise.\"\n\nHe followed \"The Alienist\" with a sequel, \"The Angel of Darkness,\" and with a Sherlock Holmes mystery, \"The Italian Secretary.\" \"It was just supposed to be a little cottage industry that would give me a stipend to live off of while I was doing the work that I had always done and was trained to do,\" he explained.\n\nCarr's true calling was military history, as an editor of the Quarterly Journal of Military History, and as a college professor at Bard College outside New York City.\n\nHe grew up on New York's Lower East Side, a then-crime-filled neighborhood where violence was a part of everyday life, including at home. \"My father was a violent person by nature,\" Carr said. \"He was a tempestuous person, and my father told me repeatedly nobody likes a smart-ass.\" And what effect did that have? \"Made me that much more of a smart-ass every time he said it. It's what happens with children if it's accompanied by a swift smack to the back of your head.\"\n\nHis father, Lucien, a news editor and member of the Beat poets' coterie, killed a man when he was 19, and served two years in prison before being pardoned. Carr said his father never spoke about it, which gave him more of a desire to figure out where personal violence comes from.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Carr published \"The Lessons of Terror.\" He traced 2,000 years of war, arguing that strategies that target civilians have always ultimately failed. \"We must develop a way for American military power to be projected in a more enlightened fashion,\" he said. \"We have to, or the entire world – even more of the world that hates us now – will hate us later.\"\n\nHe also co-wrote \"America Invulnerable: The Quest for Absolute Security from 1812 to Star Wars\" (1989), and \"Killing Time\" (2000), a dystopian murder mystery set in the Information Age.\n\nAnd beyond military history and period thrillers, Carr also worked on the libretto of an opera, \"Merlin,\" about the magician in King Arthur's court. \"Traditional styles are very comforting to me,\" he said. \"The modern world is a very uncomfortable place for me. … It's hard to look at the modern world as a student of the things that I study and see it as anything but pretty horrendous. It's not a comfortable place in terms of where our values are going. We are heading into a very dark age.\"\n\nHis final published work was the 2024 memoir of his devoted cat, Masha: \"My Beloved Monster: Masha, the Half-Wild Rescue Cat Who Rescued Me.\"\n\nBut despite his intimations of misery, he praised his students, who are studying the past in hopes of changing the future. \"They're all interested in it. The good ones, the smart ones are all interested in it. It's actually a very reassuring thing that they are, because ... it's not at all gloom and doom, no. There are things to be encouraged by.\"\n\nDabney Coleman\n\nActor Dabney Coleman (January 3, 1932-May 16, 2024) cornered the market in playing likably unlikable characters, from comedies (\"Buffalo Bill\") to dramas (\"Boardwalk Empire\"). His most memorable roles were as the chauvinistic boss in \"9 to 5,\" and the obnoxious soap opera director in \"Tootsie.\"\n\nHe was a dependable presence in nearly 200 films and TV shows, beginning in the early 1960s with appearances in \"Ben Casey,\" \"Dr. Kildare,\" \"The Outer Limits,\" \"The Fugitive,\" \"That Girl,\" \"Bonanza,\" and \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" and in movies like \"Downhill Racer,\" \"The Towering Inferno,\" and \"North Dallas Forty.\" Then he was cast as Merle Jeeter, the corrupt mayor of Fernwood, in Norman Lear's satirical soap opera \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.\"\n\n\"He was just the worst human being, Merle Jeeter!\" Coleman told The AV Club in 2012. \"That's kind of where it all started, as far as people's belief that I could do comedy, particularly that negative, caustic, cynical kind of guy. I was pretty good at doing that kind of humor. So that was a huge turning point, and it was a lot of fun.\"\n\nHe carried the character over into the spinoff series, \"Fernwood Tonight.\"\n\nThen came the revenge comedy \"9 to 5,\" in which he played Franklin Hart, the sexist, conspiratorial boss who gets his comeuppance from female staffers played by Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. \"All three of those girls were [great] to me,\" he told AV Club, \"because they were several steps up the ladder from where I was in my career. … Almost icons in their fields, if you want to break it down like that. And here's this guy coming off of 'Mary Hartman,' which is not too shabby. But it was late-night TV. Anyway, what I'm alluding to is that all three of them went out of their way to make me feel equal. There's no other way to put it. Status-wise and talent-wise, they all made me feel extremely secure and were very supportive.\"\n\nThe film was a box office hit and put him on the map, in such high-profile films as \"On Golden Pond,\" \"Tootsie,\" \"WarGames,\" \"Cloak and Dagger,\" and \"Dragnet.\" He also starred in the short-lived sitcom \"Buffalo Bill,\" playing an egotistical talk show host. He followed that series with \"The Slap Maxwell Story,\" playing a (what else?) egotistical sportswriter. It lasted only one season, but earned Coleman a Golden Globe. Coleman also received six Emmy nominations, winning one award for the TV drama \"Sworn to Silence.\"\n\nLater credits included \"Columbo,\" \"Madman of the People,\" \"Clifford,\" \"Stuart Little,\" \"The Guardian,\" \"Courting Alex,\" \"Where the Red Fern Grows,\" \"Heartland,\" \"Boardwalk Empire,\" \"Ray Donovan,\" \"NCIS,\" and \"Yellowstone.\"\n\nIn 1994 Coleman talked with The New York Times about the seemingly disagreeable traits that the \"Dabney Coleman character,\" on shows like \"Madman of the People,\" would exhibit, and how he'd wring comedy from them: \"Writers write wrong for me sometimes,\" he said. \"They're trying to be funny, usually. Trying to make a joke. And that's not what I do, you know. It's not jokes; it's not words. It's acting. It's acting funny.\"\n\nAlice Munro\n\nNobel laureate Alice Munro (July 10, 1931-May 13, 2024) was one of the world's most highly-esteemed short story writers. She was the first lifelong Canadian to win the Nobel Prize, in 2013, and the first recipient cited exclusively for short fiction. The Swedish academy pronounced her a \"master of the contemporary short story\" who could \"accommodate the entire epic complexity of the novel in just a few short pages.\"\n\nWhile majoring in journalism at the University of Western Ontario, she sold a story about a lonely teacher, \"The Dimensions of a Shadow,\" to CBC Radio, and published work in her school's literary journal. Her debut collection, \"Dance of the Happy Shades,\" was released in 1968; it won the Governor's General Award and made Munro a national celebrity.\n\nOver the next 40 years, her reputation and readership only grew, with many of her stories first appearing in The New Yorker. Her prose style was straightforward, her tone matter-of-fact, but her plots revealed unending disruption and disappointments: broken marriages, violent deaths, madness and dreams unfulfilled, or never even attempted. Among her most acclaimed works were \"The Beggar Maid,\" \"The Children Stay,\" \"Dance of the Happy Shades,\" \"Family Furnishings,\" \"Lives of Girls and Women,\" \"The Love of a Good Woman,\" \"Miles City, Montana,\" \"The Moons of Jupiter,\" and \"Runaway.\"\n\nHer story \"The Bear Came Over the Mountain,\" in which a married woman with memory loss has an affair with a fellow nursing home patient, was adapted by Sarah Polley for the 2006 feature film \"Away from Her,\" which starred Oscar-nominee Julie Christie. In 2014, Kristen Wiig starred in \"Hateship, Loveship,\" an adaptation of Munro's \"Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage.\"\n\nHer 2009 collection \"My Best Stories,\" with an introduction by Margaret Atwood, contained 17 stories chosen by Munro. Her last book was the 2012 collection \"Dear Life.\"\n\nMunro's honors included Britain's Man Booker International Prize and the National Book Critics Circle award in the U.S. In Canada, she was a three-time winner of the Governor's General Award and a two-time winner of the Giller Prize.\n\nMunro would acknowledge that she didn't think like a novelist. \"I have all these disconnected realities in my own life, and I see them in other people's lives,\" she told the AP. \"That was one of the problems, why I couldn't write novels. I never saw things hanging together too well.\"\n\nRoger Corman\n\nRoger Corman (April 5, 1926-May 9, 2024) directed or produced hundreds of movies on threadbare budgets – exploitation films, horror/sci-fi flicks, and other fare for which he was dubbed \"King of the B Movies.\" He also made Edgar Allen Poe a familiar marquee name at drive-ins.\n\nCorman's independent streak was fundamental. \"I do have a hard time with authority,\" he admitted to \"Sunday Morning\" in 2010. \"I was in the Navy for two years. They were the worst two years of my life. Any rule they set out, I felt it is my duty to break that rule.\"\n\nCorman described his production methods: \"I really worked rather efficiently. I planned very heavily in advance.\" Efficiently is an understatement. He shot \"Machine Gun Kelly,\" a gangster film with Charles Bronson, in just 10 days. \"Little Shop of Horrors\" (in which a houseplant expresses a taste for blood) was shot in two days and a night. \"There was a set standing at an independent studio in Hollywood where I had my offices,\" Corman recalled. \"And it was a very good set ... and why let a set go to waste? So, I had about $30,000, and I designed a picture that could be made for the $30,000 that I had available.\"\n\nHe directed more than 50 movies, from \"It Conquered the World,\" \"Not of This Earth,\" \"A Bucket of Blood,\" and \"The Little Shop of Horrors,\" to \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" \"The Raven,\" \"The Young Racers,\" \"The Masque of the Red Death,\" \"The Wild Angels,\" \"The Trip,\" \"Von Richthofen and Brown,\" and \"Frankenstein Unbound.\" He did film \"The St. Valentine's Day Massacre\" for 20th Century Fox, taking advantage of standing sets on the studio's backlot. The resulting film received positive reviews, but the experience put Corman off working for Hollywood studios again.\n\nCorman's productions nurtured a generation or two of Hollywood talent, including Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich, Jonathan Demme, James Cameron, Gale Ann Hurd, Ron Howard and Joe Dante.\n\nHis films provided work for up-and-coming actors like Jack Nicholson (\"Little Shop of Horrors\"), Peter Fonda and Bruce Dern (\"The Wild Angels\"), Robert De Niro (\"Bloody Mama\"), Sylvester Stallone (\"Death Race 2000\"), and Sandra Bullock (\"Fire on the Amazon\"). Corman said of Bullock, \"I remember thinking, 'This is the best actress I've worked with in years.' I called her agent immediately and said, 'I got another picture for Sandra.' He said, 'Roger, you're too late. She's already with the majors!'\"\n\nIn addition to producing, he also helped distribute foreign language films in the U.S., including works by directors Ingmar Bergman (\"Cries and Whispers\"), Federico Fellini (\"Amarcord\"), Akira Kurosawa (\"Dersu Uzala\"), François Truffaut (\"The Story of Adele H.\"), and Volker Schlöndorff (\"The Tin Drum\").\n\nIn 2009 the motion picture academy recognized Corman for his oeuvre with a lifetime achievement Oscar. Accepting the award, Corman said, \"I think that to succeed in this world you have to take chances. Many of my friends and compatriots and people who've started with me are here tonight, and they've all succeeded. Some of them succeeded to an extraordinary degree. And I believe they've succeeded because they had the courage to take chances, to gamble. But they gambled because they knew the odds were with them; they knew they had the ability to create what they wanted to make.\n\n\"It's very easy for a major studio or somebody else to repeat their successes, to spend vast amounts of money on remakes, on special effects-driven tentpole franchise films. But I believe the finest films being done today are done by the original, innovative filmmakers who have the courage to take a chance and to gamble. So, I say to you: Keep gambling, keep taking chances.\"\n\nBernard Hill\n\nBritish actor Bernard Hill (December 17, 1944-May 5, 2024) was best known for his memorable roles in James Cameron's \"Titanic\" (in which he played the captain of the doomed ocean liner), and in Peter Jackson's adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\" (playing King Théoden).\n\nHill first gained renown on the BBC's 1982 drama series \"Boys from the Blackstuff,\" about unemployed Liverpudlians, for which he earned a best actor BAFTA nomination.\n\nHe portrayed Captain Edward Smith in the epic \"Titanic.\" In the J.R.R. Tolkien fantasies \"The Two Towers\" and \"The Return of the King,\" Hill played Théoden, King of Rohan, who rallies his riders against the forces of darkness.\n\nHill's deliveries of the king's speeches, such as his lament in \"The Two Towers\" while an army of orcs descends upon Helm's Deep, are among the most stirring in recent films:\n\n\"Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountain, like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow. How did it come to this?\"\n\nHill's other credits include \"Gandhi,\" \"The Bounty,\" \"Drowning by Numbers,\" \"Mountains of the Moon,\" \"The Ghost and the Darkness,\" \"True Crime,\" and the period drama \"Wolf Hall.\"\n\nFrank Stella\n\nIn his early 20s, just out of Princeton, Frank Stella (May 12, 1936-May 4, 2024) was a star. In an era of abstract expressionism, Stella painted minimalist, monochromatic paintings. In 1959, New York's Museum of Modern Art put some of his \"Black Paintings\" in a show, and then bought one. The New Yorker would later write that Stella's impact on abstract art was akin to Bob Dylan's on music.\n\nIn 2021, \"Sunday Morning\" asked Stella about his fascination with abstraction versus figurative art. \"'Cause I didn't like people that much,\" he laughed. \"Yeah, yeah, I mean, everybody was doing that. Or, I didn't want to spend a lot of time drawing from the model. You know when you see that poor girl sitting up there on that chair after she has to take off her bathrobe and everything, it's pretty pitiful!\"\n\nBut making art is no simple thing, and Stella struggled despite the seeming simplicity of his work. In 1983 he told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"[People] love art, but they love great art more than anything. And you know, I don't blame them; so do I. I mean, I love great art more than anything, too. But greatness doesn't stare you in the face every day. I mean, it's hard to come by. And the audience has a high level of expectation and, if they get something that they like and then they're told it's not great, they feel that they've done something wrong. I mean, they feel they should only focus on the 'great' things. And the artists feel that they should only make 'great' paintings, you know? I mean, you don't like to say, 'Gee, I just had a pretty good day.' You know, you're supposed to have an inspired day.\"\n\nAs Stella pushed the boundaries of abstraction with his paintings and prints, along the way he developed a few artistic obsessions. The painted surfaces of canvases and paper became the painted surfaces of assemblages and sculptures made out of slick fiberglass or aluminum tubing, including some in the shape of a star. (Frank's surname in Italian does mean star.) Carbon fiber materials and 3-D printing allowed Stella to explore ever-more challenging shapes, creating stars that stood 21 feet high.\n\nStella said he wasn't one to consider his legacy. \"I went from being a young artist to a middle-aged artist to a mature artist, and now I'm an 'is-he-still-alive?' artist,\" the octogenarian told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2021. \"It would be probably a lot more satisfying to people if I'd started out like this, and then ended up with the black paintings. If you played my career back the other way, people would say, 'Oh, look, how fantastic! He ended up with those beautiful paintings at the end!'\"\n\nDuane Eddy\n\nRock & Roll Hall of Famer Duane Eddy (April 26, 1938-April 30, 2024) was a pioneering guitar hero whose twangy playing on early rock classics like \"Rebel Rouser,\" \"Forty Miles of Bad Road,\" and \"Peter Gunn\" influenced such artists as George Harrison and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nHis first album, 1958's \"Have 'Twangy' Guitar Will Travel,\" featured such hits as \"Moovin' n' Groovin',\" \"Ramrod\" and \"Cannonball.\" He released 21 more studio albums over the next nine years, selling more than 100 million records worldwide.\n\nHis playing was based on the premise that a guitar's bass strings sounded better on tape than the high ones. \"I had a distinctive sound that people could recognize and I stuck pretty much with that,\" he told The Associated Press in 1986. \"I'm not one of the best technical players by any means … A lot of guys are more skillful than I am with the guitar. A lot of it is over my head. But some of it is not what I want to hear out of the guitar.\"\n\nHe played on Paul McCartney's \"Rockestra Theme,\" and Harrison played on Eddy's self-titled comeback album, both in 1987.\n\nEddy also toured with Dick Clark's \"Caravan of Stars\" and appeared in a few films, including \"Because They're Young,\" and \"Thunder of Drums.\"\n\nThe Eddy sound became defined by the term \"Twang,\" which was used as the title of a 1993 box set, \"Twang Thang: The Duane Eddy Anthology.\"\n\n\"It's a silly name for a nonsilly thing,\" Eddy told the AP in 1993. \"But it has haunted me for 35 years now, so it's almost like sentimental value - if nothing else.\"\n\nMike Pinder\n\nA founding member of the British band The Moody Blues, Mike Pinder (December 27, 1941-April 24, 2024) helped shift the band away from its early efforts covering American blues music (for which they earned little success), to its blend of English folk and progressive rock. Pinder played keyboards, and helped promote the Mellotron (an electronic instrument with two keyboards that incorporated tape loops) to become a familiar sound in rock music.\n\nHaving worked at the Mellotron factory, Pinder was familiar with the instrument's quirks, and mastered it in the band's second album, \"Days of Future Passed\" (1967). It was featured prominently in such tracks as \"Nights in White Satin\" (the Moody Blues' biggest hit) and \"Tuesday Afternoon.\" [Pinder also introduced The Beatles to the Mellotron, which they used on \"Strawberry Fields Forever.\"]\n\nIn a 2018 interview with Rolling Stone, Pinder explained his fascination with the Mellotron: \"I grew up listening to the music of Mantovani and the layers of rich and melodious string arrangements that were his trademark. The Mellotron enabled me to create my own variations of string movements. I could play any instrument that I wanted to hear in the music. If I heard strings, I could play them with the Mellotron. If I heard cello, brass, trumpets or piano, I could play them.\"\n\nWith \"Days of Future Passed\" (which was originally envisioned by Decca as a demonstration album of its recording technology for both classical and rock fans), the Moody Blues connected their progressive rock tracks with orchestral arrangements by Peter Knight, into a concept album of a day's passing. It would become one of the defining rock albums of the '60s.\n\nIn addition to playing keyboards and composing (his songwriting credits included \"Everyday,\" \"Dawn Is a Feeling,\" \"Om,\" \"The Best Way to Travel,\" \"Have You Heard,\" \"Lost in a Lost World,\" and \"So Deep Within You\"), Pinder also recited the spoken-word passages of Moody Blues songs, such as \"Late Lament.\"\n\nPinder played with the band on nine albums (including \"In Search of the Lost Chord,\" \"On the Threshold of a Dream,\" \"To the Children's Children's Children,\" \"A Question of Balance,\" \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour,\" \"Seventh Sojourn,\" and \"Octave\") until 1978, after which he worked as a music consultant for Atari. He also released solo albums, \"The Promise\" (1976) and \"Among the Stars\" (1994).\n\nDickey Betts\n\nSinger-songwriter and guitarist Dickey Betts (December 12, 1943–April 18, 2024) was a co-founder of the Allman Brothers Band, which blended blues, country, R&B and jazz with '60s rock to create a new genre, Southern rock.\n\nA descendant of Canadian fiddlers, Betts was born and raised in Florida, and played the ukulele and banjo before focusing on electric guitar, because it impressed girls. After he and Berry Oakley played together in the band Second Coming, the two joined forces with Gregg and Duane Allman, Butch Trucks and Jai Johanny \"Jaimoe\" Johanson to form the Allman Brothers Band in 1969. They were pioneers for ignoring the traditional formula of pop songs (individual tracks might take up the entire side of an LP), and for being a biracial group from the Deep South. Betts shared lead guitar duties with Duane Allman.\n\nThey released two albums before their 1971 classic, \"At Fillmore East,\" now considered among the greatest live albums of that era. Betts contributed his instrumental, \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed,\" which became a concert favorite.\n\nDuane Allman died four days after \"Fillmore\" was certified gold, and Oakley died in a motorcycle accident about a year later, but the band carried on. Their 1973 album \"Brothers and Sisters\" rose to No. 1 on the charts and featured Betts' song \"Ramblin' Man,\" the group's biggest hit. Betts was also credited as writer or co-writer of \"Jessica\" (inspired by the music of Django Reinhardt), \"Blue Sky,\" \"Straight From the Heart,\" \"Crazy Love,\" and \"Good Clean Fun.\" (Betts and the Allman Brothers' travels with teenage music journalist Cameron Crowe were an inspiration for Crowe's 2000 film, \"Almost Famous.\")\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band would break up and re-form a few times, during which Betts also released solo records or performed with other lineups (such as Dickey Betts & Great Southern, and Betts, Hall, Leavell and Trucks).\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. But five years later, Betts left the band for good in a bitter split.\n\nIn 2020, looking back on his time with the Allman Brothers, Betts told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, \"Gregg tended to write in a melancholy kind of way so I purposely tried to write more an … uplifting way to try and kind of give some depth to the difference between my writing and his writing. Gregg was great but you don't want to hear a whole album of melancholy, at least that was the way I felt about it. We were a good team. We never really wrote anything together, but we wrote well, his songs and my songs went together really well.\"\n\nMandisa\n\nChristian singer Mandisa (October 2, 1976-April 18, 2024) appeared on \"American Idol\" in 2006, and won a Grammy for best contemporary Christian music album for her 2013 release, \"Overcomer.\"\n\nMandisa (whose full name was Mandisa Lynn Hundley) released her debut album in 2007. Titled \"True Beauty,\" it earned a Grammy nomination for best pop and contemporary gospel album. She released five more albums, her last being 2017's \"Out of the Dark,\" which topped the Billboard Christian chart.\n\nIn 2022 she wrote a memoir, \"Out of the Dark: My Journey Through the Shadows to Find God's Joy,\" in which she discussed her struggles with severe depression, challenges with her weight, and her faith. In it she wrote: \"During my life I've been drawn into friendships with all types of people—some very different from me. My tribe has included men, women, single people, married people with kids, millennials, more 'seasoned' folks, and every age in between. God has blessed me with a diverse group of people in my life—mentors from my church, singers I've been on tour with, people I went to school with, fellow artists and influencers, stay-at-home moms—and they've come with a variety of skin tones. You learn so much and become a richer person by surrounding yourself with people who are different from you. As I've walked through hard things in my life, I've sometimes been surprised by the people God has used to comfort and help me. At times I get to be there for them too. That's what it's all about.\"\n\nFaith Ringgold\n\nThe work of pioneering American artist and activist Faith Ringgold (October 8, 1930-April 12, 2024) spanned more than seven decades, during which she commented on social upheavals in America, and advocated for women and African Americans to be better represented in the arts.\n\nBorn in Harlem in 1930, a debilitating asthma condition meant she was educated mostly at home, which, she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2021, gave her the freedom to be herself. She was also inspired by the Harlem Renaissance movement – a blossoming of African American art and literature. \"I think there was a lot of feeling at that time that, 'We can't do this, we can't do that.' Oh, yes, we can! We can do it. All you gotta do is try.\"\n\nRinggold said, \"I have kind of forgotten the sharp feeling I used to get of being rejected, and maybe it has to do with being left out so many times: 'All right, go ahead, leave me out if you want. I'll come in another door!'\"\n\nIn the 1960s, Ringgold created the \"American People Series,\" political paintings in which she explored race relations in America. In 1971, she founded the \"Where We At\" artists collective for Black women. She also created a number of works for public spaces, including a mosaic mural in a Harlem subway station honoring prominent figures like Sugar Ray Robinson and Malcolm X.\n\nShe was best known for her story quilts – a patchwork of images with a story written right onto the fabric. One, \"Tar Beach\" (1988), was adapted into an award-winning children's book.\n\nShe acknowledged feeling more freedom with age: \"As you get older, you become more free,\" Ringgold said. \"If you will take advantage of the freedom that you have attained, anyone can fly. All you gotta do is try.\"\n\nTrina Robbins\n\nTrina Robbins (August 17, 1938-April 10, 2024) was a pioneer in the male-dominated world of comic books, who helped create the first American comic book created entirely by women, \"It Ain't Me, Babe,\" published in 1970.\n\nA cartoonist, writer and editor in the underground comics movement, Robbins' artistic journey first took her to fashion design, with a New York boutique called Broccoli. She created clothes for '60s rock musicians, including Cass Elliott and David Crosby, and was immortalized in the Joni Mitchell song, \"Ladies of the Canyon.\" When she moved to San Francisco in 1969, she became more closely tied to the city's activists and cartoonists. She and Barbara Mendes co-produced \"It Aint Me, Babe,\" which led to a long-running series of \"Wimmen's Comix.\"\n\nWith one foot in the underground comics world, Robbins also worked in mainstream comics, becoming the first female artist to draw an entire Wonder Woman comic book, in 1986. She also created a Marvel Comics character, Misty.\n\nShe edited anthology collections and wrote several books, including histories of overlooked female comic artists and writers. Her titles included \"A Century of Women Cartoonists,\" \"The Great Women Superheroes,\" \"From Girls to Grrrlz: a History of ♀ Comics from Teens to Zines,\" \"Pretty in Ink: North American Women Cartoonists, 1896-2013,\" and \"Flapper Queens: Women Cartoonists of the Jazz Age.\" Her 2017 memoir was titled \"Last Girl Standing.\"\n\nIn 2015 Robbins told The Washington Post, \"My big epiphany when researching my books was: If you're not written about, you're forgotten. And of course, all those comics histories by men — they just want to write about Jack Kirby, so until I started writing my histories nobody knew about these wonderful women and they were forgotten. But no more! …\n\n\"What has evened the playing field is the advent of graphic novels. Now, if women want to draw comics, they don't have to draw overly muscular guys with thick necks and big chins beating each other up. Real book publishers know that girls and women create and read graphic novels. And there are some damn good ones by guys, too! Boys don't have to be afraid that we will take away their superheroes — as long as there are 12-year-old boys, there will be superheroes — but we have added girls to the mix.\"\n\nChristopher Durang\n\nTony Award-winning playwright Christopher Durang (January 2, 1949-April 2, 2024) was a master of satire and absurd black comedy. Among his most noted works were \"Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,\" ″Betty's Summer Vacation,\" ″The Marriage of Bette and Boo,\" and \"Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike.\"\n\n\"I am one of those people who laughed at not-funny things,\" Durang said during a Dramatists Guild conference in 2013. \"If you watch the adults around you make the same mistake 20 times in a row, at a certain point you want to jump out the window, or you laugh. I was one of the ones who laughed.\"\n\nWhile attending the Yale School of Drama, he met Sigourney Weaver, with whom he wrote and co-starred in \"Das Lusitania Songspiel,\" a parody of a Kurt Weill-Bertolt Brecht cabaret. A reworked version played off-Broadway in 1976 and was, in the words of Durang, \"very silly.\"\n\nDurang and Weaver's collaboration would continue over the years; in addition to his one-act play titled \"Titanic,\" the actress starred in productions of \"Beyond Therapy,\" and \"Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike.\" But they joked about their friendship in their Playbill biographies for \"Das Lusitania Songspiel.\" \"We pretended we had performed on Broadway many times, and we use Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontanne's credits as our own,\" Durang admitted to Playbill Magazine in 2012. \"At the end, it said, 'In private life, Mr. Durang and Ms. Weaver are married and live in Connecticut with their daughters, Goneril and Regan.' We thought people would get it's a joke — but no.\"\n\nWhile at Yale Durang also co-wrote a musical comedy, \"The Idiots Karamazov,\" starring Meryl Streep.\n\nHe won an Obie Award for \"Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,\" in which a nun lectures about Catholicism, with gunplay. He was nominated for a Tony for best book of a musical in 1978 for \"A History of the American Film,\" and in 2006 was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for \"Miss Witherspoon,\" about a woman who wishes to die but is continually reincarnated.\n\nOther plays included \"Beyond Therapy\" (featuring two needy psychiatrists trying to counsel needy patients), \"The Actor's Nightmare,\" ″Mrs. Bob Cratchit's Wild Christmas Binge,\" ″The Marriage of Bette and Boo,\" ″Baby with the Bathwater,\" \"For Whom the Southern Belle Tolls,\" \"Why Torture is Wrong, and the People Who Love Them,\" and \"Betty's Summer Vacation.\"\n\nDurang was co-chair, with Marsha Norman, of the Juilliard School's playwrights program, from its inception in 1994 until he retired in 2016. He also taught at Yale and Princeton.\n\nIn a 2012 profile for Interview Magazine, Durang said of his work, \"[M]y early plays—in my 20s—often have very dark endings. Sister Mary Ignatius basically killed two people, one in self-defense and one not, and then it just ends with her keeping a gun on another person while the little boy's on her lap, reciting questions. That's a dark ending. But starting with 'Miss Witherspoon' (2005), and arguably with 'Betty's Summer Vacation' (1999), which is a rather dark play, I seem to have more hopeful things at the end. I seem not to want to send the audience home unhappy.\"\n\nJoe Flaherty\n\nComedian Joe Flaherty (June 21, 1941-April 1, 2024) spent seven years with The Second City in Chicago before moving north to help establish the improv group's Toronto outpost. After NBC hit pay dirt with \"Saturday Night Live\" (which hired several Second City alumni), Flaherty helped form Second City's own sketch series, \"SCTV,\" about a fictional TV station with ridiculous shows and commercials, and even more ridiculous backstage drama.\n\nAmong Flaherty's characters were station owner Guy Caballero, smarmy talk show host Sammy Maudlin, and Count Floyd, who introduced horror films of dubious merit (such as \"Dr. Tongue's Evil House of Pancakes\"). Flaherty won two Emmys for his writing on \"SCTV,\" which costarred John Candy, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy, Harold Ramis, Martin Short, Dave Thomas and Andrea Martin.\n\nFlaherty's other credits included the sketch film \"Tunnelvision,\" Steven Spielberg's \"1941,\" \"Used Cars,\" \"Stripes,\" \"Follow That Bird,\" \"Club Paradise,\" \"Innerspace,\" \"Who's Harry Crumb?,\" \"Back to the Future Part II,\" \"Maniac Mansion,\" \"Dream On,\" \"Happy Gilmore,\" \"Police Academy: The Series,\" \"Freaks and Geeks,\" \"Slackers,\" \"The King of Queens,\" and \"Family Guy.\" His last role was in the 2014 short \"Nightlife,\" reprising his Count Floyd.\n\nFor several years he taught comedy at Humber College in Toronto.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Avenue Edmonton, Flaherty admitted that, in all his years playing the character of Count Floyd, only one person ever asked why the supposed vampire howled like a werewolf. \"The howl just worked,\" he shrugged.\n\nLouis Gossett Jr\n\nA working actor since the early 1950s, Louis Gossett Jr. (May 27, 1936-March 29, 2024) won an Emmy Award for his performance as Fiddler in the TV miniseries \"Roots,\" and became the first African American to win a best supporting actor Oscar, for \"An Officer and a Gentleman.\"\n\nGossett grew up in Coney Island, New York, and had dreams of being a doctor or athlete. But while he was sidelined with a sports injury, he took to the stage in his Brooklyn high school's production of \"You Can't Take It with You.\" An English teacher saw something in the class president: \"He used to say, 'Louis, I see they're looking for a young man to play a lead in a Broadway show,'\" he recalled for \"Sunday Morning\" in 2020. \"I know you never saw a play. But tell your mother to take you down there Sunday. What can you lose?'\"\n\nAt 17 he got the part, on Broadway, in \"Take a Giant Step.\" He studied at an offshoot of the Actors Studio, and by 23 he was already working with legends like Sidney Poitier and Ruby Dee in the original production of Lorraine Hansberry's \"A Raisin in the Sun.\"\n\nHe repeated his role in the film version, and set his sights on Hollywood.\n\nHis 1960s and '70s credits included the TV series \"East Side/West Side,\" \"The Invaders,\" \"Daktari,\" \"The Bill Cosby Show,\" \"The Young Rebels,\" \"The Partridge Family,\" \"Bonanza,\" \"The Rookies,\" \"Mod Squad,\" \"Alias Smith and Jones,\" \"The Jeffersons,\" \"The Six Million Dollar Man,\" \"Little House on the Prairie,\" and \"Good Times,\" and the films \"The Landlord,\" \"Skin Game,\" \"Travels With My Aunt,\" \"The White Dawn,\" \"The Laughing Policeman,\" \"Sidekicks,\" and \"The River Niger.\"\n\nThen came the pivotal role of Fiddler in \"Roots,\" at the time the most-watched TV miniseries in history. Gossett won an Emmy for his performance as a slave who teaches English to Kunta Kinte (LeVar Burton). Of his character Gossett said, \"We look for those magic moments as actors and actresses, when there's lightning in the bottle.\"\n\n\"Roots\" was big, and propelled Gossett to roles in \"The Deep,\" \"The Choirboys,\" and the TV movie \"Don't Look Back,\" as baseball great \"Satchel\" Paige. With his riveting portrayal of Gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley, drill instructor for Richard Gere, in \"An Officer and a Gentleman.\" Gossett earned rave reviews, and won the Academy Award - the first Black actor to win for a supporting role.\n\nHe admitted he did not believe it when his name was called: \"My agent hit me in the chest and said, 'They mentioned your name!' And I had to look at him 'cause I thought I was asleep. And I looked around and there was applause. Not supposed to be possible. So, that's a piece of history.\"\n\nThere was more success: the TV mini-series \"Sadat,\" \"Backstairs at the White House,\" \"Return to Lonesome Dove,\" and \"Watchmen,\" and the films \"Enemy Mine\" and \"Iron Eagle.\" He won a Daytime Emmy for the children's special, \"In His Father's Shoes.\" Later roles included \"Touched By an Angel,\" \"Boardwalk Empire,\" \"Madam Secretary,\" \"The Cuban,\" and the recent musical remake of \"The Color Purple.\"\n\nRichard Serra\n\nAmerican artist and sculptor Richard Serra (November 2, 1938-March 26, 2024) was known for fashioning massive, curved walls of steel into large-scale artworks. Considered one of his generation's most preeminent sculptors, Serra became world-renowned for his metal structures, including monumental arcs, spirals and ellipses.\n\nA native of San Francisco, Serra originally studied painting at Yale University but turned to sculpting in the 1960s. His choice of materials may have been inevitable; his father worked in a shipyard, and Serra put himself through college as a steelworker. This lifelong familiarity with weight and mass is probably the reason he was unfazed by what it takes to make, move and install works that weigh tons.\n\nHis sculptures have always been about changing perceptions of time and space – of weight and weightlessness. \"The content of the pieces is really determined by the viewer,\" Serra told \"Sunday Morning\" in 1998. \"The subject of these pieces is the viewer. You're the subject of these pieces.\"\n\nSerra's sculptures have been installed around the world, from the galleries of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, to the deserts of Qatar.\n\nHis public art was sometimes met with skepticism. In the 1980s his \"Tilted Arc,\" commissioned for Federal Plaza in New York City, was torn down after Serra's sculpture got caught up in the politics of taste, with opponents calling his 120-foot long curved steel wall an \"atrocity,\" and \"a big rusty wall just standing there.\"\n\nStill, Serra persisted. In a 2008 interview with The Guardian, the artist, then 69, said, \"I have a certain obstinacy, a certain willfulness that has got me in trouble, but it has also got me through.\"\n\nM. Emmet Walsh\n\nCharacter actor M. Emmet Walsh (March 22, 1935-March 19, 2024) was a welcome addition to more than 100 films during his career, with performances that were rollicking, humorous, unsettling, and wryly dangerous, with a glint in his eye that went far deeper than the script. He was most recognizable from two standout roles: As a crooked Texas private detective in \"Blood Simple,\" the first feature film by the Coen Brothers; and as Harrison Ford's threatening police captain in the dystopian sci-fi thriller \"Blade Runner.\"\n\nBorn Michael Emmet Walsh, he was raised in Vermont, and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. He appeared on stage for a decade before taking small roles in films, including \"Alice's Restaurant,\" \"Little Big Man,\" \"Cold Turkey,\" \"They Might Be Giants,\" \"Serpico,\" \"Slap Shot,\" \"Straight Time\" (as Dustin Hoffman's parole officer), \"The Jerk,\" \"Ordinary People,\" \"Reds,\" and \"Silkwood.\"\n\nWalsh played Captain Harry Bryant in Ridley Scott's \"Blade Runner,\" who coerces Harrison Ford's Deckard out of retirement to hunt down humanoid replicants. The film is an acknowledged classic, but Walsh told The Hollywood Reporter in 2017 that when the picture was first screened for the cast and crew, \"We all sat there and it ended. And nothing. We didn't know what to say or to think or do! We didn't know what in the hell we had done! The only one who seemed to get it was Ridley.\"\n\n\"Blood Simple\" writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen had seen \"Straight Time,\" and wrote the role of Loren Visser for Walsh, who was shooting in Texas at the time. \"My agent called with a script written by some kids for a low-budget movie,\" Walsh told The Guardian in 2017. \"It was a Sydney Greenstreet kind of role, with a Panama suit and the hat. I thought it was kinda fun and interesting. They were 100 miles away in Austin, so I went down there early one day before shooting. ...\n\n\"Every time, you try and figure something individual that works for the character. If you're playing a villain, you don't play villain. My character in 'Blood Simple,' Visser, doesn't think of himself as particularly bad or evil. He's on the edge of what's legal, but he's having a lot of fun with all that. He's a simple fella trying to make an extra buck and going a little further than he'd normally go in his business enterprises.\"\n\nWalsh said, once the film opened, \"I was, like: Wow! Suddenly my price went up five times. I was the guy everybody wanted.\"\n\nAmong the films and TV shows for which he was wanted were \"The Pope of Greenwich Village,\" \"Fletch,\" \"Critters,\" \"Raising Arizona,\" \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" \"Clean and Sober,\" \"Catch Me If You Can,\" \"Narrow Margin,\" \"The Music of Chance,\" \"My Best Friend's Wedding,\" \"Twilight,\" \"Calvary,\" \"Knives Out,\" \"The Righteous Gemstones,\" and \"Outlaw Posse.\"\n\nIn 2017, when asked about the sequel to \"Blade Runner\" soon to be released, \"Blade Runner 2049,\" Walsh quipped, \"It's sad to know they can make a film without me.\"\n\nCaptain David E. Harris\n\nCaptain David E. Harris (December 22, 1934-March 8, 2024) became the first Black commercial airline pilot when he was hired by American Airlines in 1964.\n\nA graduate of Ohio State University. Harris entered the Air Force ROTC program after he was initially rejected twice due to his race. He joined the Air Force and flew B-47 mid-range and B-52 long-range bomber jets for the Strategic Air Command. After leaving the military in 1964 with the rank of captain, Harris was hired by American.\n\n\"My timing was kind of lucky,\" Harris told The Tulsa World in 2008. \"You had a slug of Tuskegee Airmen out of World War II who came before me, but this nation wasn't ready to have African-American pilots.\n\n\"By the time I came along in 1964 and was hired by American, I was in the right place at the right time with the right stuff.\"\n\nDuring his 30 years with American he piloted the DC-6 and 7, the Lockheed Electra, the BAC 111, the Boeing 747, 727 and 767, the McDonnell Douglas MD-11, and the Airbus 300. He was a founding member of the Organization of Black Airline Pilots (now the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals), for which he served as president.\n\nBy the time he retired in 1994, he noted, there were 80 Black pilots at American. \"There had been noticeable changes,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said, \"Capt. Harris opened the doors and inspired countless Black pilots to pursue their dreams to fly.\"\n\nIn retirement, Harris flew a single-engine Trinidad TB 20.\n\n\"How great it is to be paid well to be doing what you'd just as soon do in your free time,\" Harris told the Tulsa World.\n\nRichard Lewis\n\nComedian, actor and writer Richard Lewis (June 29, 1947-February 27, 2024) was nicknamed \"The Prince of Pain,\" owing to his neurosis-driven, stream-of-consciousness soliloquies. \"I'm paranoid about everything in my life,\" he once joked. \"Even at home, on my stationary bike, I have a rear-view mirror.\"\n\nA familiar presence in comedy clubs and on late-night TV for decades, with his signature look of dressing all in black (inspired, he said, from watching black-clad cowboys in TV westerns while growing up), Lewis was greatly influenced by comics of the '60s and '70s, listing among his favorites Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner, Jonathan Winters, Lenny Bruce, Mike Nichols and Elaine May, George Carlin and Richard Pryor. But Lewis' humor could be much more self-deprecating and neurotic.\n\nIn a 2009 interview with the Huffington Post, Lewis credited David Letterman with shifting his TV persona away from stand-up acts on a late-night stage. \"I haven't done monologues since 1982 – all because of Letterman,\" he said. \"He changed my life as a comedian when he got his show. He gave me my first big break. He was a big fan and he said, 'You know, you're a hit-and-miss stand-up on Johnny Carson, because you're so physical and for the camera it's not good. Plus, you're just so nuts.' He said, 'Just sit down, be yourself and wail. You don't ever have to do stand-up again.' And I never did.\"\n\nHe was named one of the top 50 stand-up comedians of all time by Comedy Central, and one of the 20th century's \"Most Influential Humorists\" by GQ Magazine\n\nLewis also starred opposite Jamie Lee Curtis in the sitcom \"Anything But Love.\" He played Don Rickles' son on \"Daddy Dearest,\" and a rabbi on \"7th Heaven.\" His film roles included a (what else?) neurotic Prince John in the Mel Brooks parody, \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights.\"\n\nHe published a memoir in 2008, \"The Other Great Depression: How I'm Overcoming, on a Daily Basis, at Least a Million Addictions and Dysfunctions and Finding a Spiritual (Sometimes) Life,\" about gaining sobriety from drugs and alcohol. In it he described himself as \"a full-blown, middle-aged, functioning anxiety collector.\" He followed that in 2015 with \"Reflections from Hell: Richard Lewis' Guide on How Not to Live.\"\n\nIn recent years he appeared on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" as comedian \"Richard Lewis,\" a foil for Larry David, a fellow native of Brooklyn (they were born in the same hospital days apart).\n\nLewis told Huffington Post that there was a thin line between narcissism and entertainment, but that he went on stage for validation because he felt so bashed. \"I take a great pride in three things as a comedian: the premises are real, I'm prolific, and I feel strongly that who I am on stage is the same as who I am off,\" he said. \"I'm not saying that's a great thing. But to me, that made me authentic. I thought, 'Let people know who Richard Lewis is because my family didn't take the time to know me.'\"\n\nAlexey Navalny\n\nRussian opposition leader Alexey Navalny (June 4, 1976-February 16, 2024) became an international symbol of freedom in an increasingly autocratic country, as he led a crusade against corruption in the Kremlin, specifically President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party, which he labeled \"the party of crooks and thieves.\" And he never stopped railing against his government, even after he was targeted with politically-motivated prosecutions, imprisoned, and even poisoned with Novichok, in an attempt on his life that captured the attention of the world.\n\nAn attorney who did a fellowship at Yale University, Navalny gained notoriety by attacking corruption within Russia's political and business worlds. By focusing on the notion of ordinary Russians being cheated rather than on human rights abuses, Navalny's investigations (such as revealing the ostentatious country estates of the politically-connected) went viral on social media, resonating with younger Russians far from Moscow and St. Petersburg. It helped him establish a network of regional offices for his group, the Anti-Corruption Foundation, and allowed unprecedented rallies against the ruling party, protesting suspicious election results.\n\nHe was convicted in 2013 of embezzlement (he denounced the charges as political retribution) and was sentenced to five years in prison, but later released, his sentence suspended following protests in the capital.\n\nNavalny did espouse an overt nationalism – he supported the rights of ethnic Russians, and the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia, a move decried by the rest of the world as illegal - but his continued attacks on Putin made him an internationally-known resistance figure. He ran for mayor of Moscow, coming in second.\n\nWhile in jail in 2019 for protesting an election, Navalny fell ill with what authorities said was an allergic reaction, but doctors said was poisoning.\n\nIn August 2020, Navalny became severely ill on a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow. He later told \"60 Minutes,\" \"I said to the flight attendant – and I kind of shocked him with my statement – 'Well, I was poisoned, and I'm going to die.' And I immediately laid down under his feet.\"\n\nThe plane diverted to Omsk, where he was hospitalized. Supporters begged doctors to allow him to be taken to Germany for treatment. Once there, doctors surmised he'd been poisoned with a nerve agent similar to what nearly killed former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England two years earlier. Navalny remained in a medically-induced coma for around two weeks.\n\nThe Kremlin denied it was behind the poisoning, but Navalny released a recording of a phone call in which an FSB officer admitted the assassination attempt and subsequent attempt to cover it up. [The call was the centerpiece of the Oscar-winning documentary \"Navalny,\" filmed during his recovery and later return to Russia.]\n\nHis arrest upon arrival in Moscow in early 2021 sparked protests that resulted in more than 10,000 people detained by police. A court then outlawed the Anti-Corruption Foundation, deeming it an extremist organization.\n\nWhile in prison, he protested, via social media, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and received an additional nine-year sentence. Later, on charges he called fabricated, Navalny was sentenced to 19 years in prison, which he understood was \"a life sentence, which is measured by the length of my life or the length of life of this regime.\"\n\nSeiji Ozawa\n\nBorn in China of Japanese parents, internationally-acclaimed conductor Seiji Ozawa (September 1, 1935-February 6, 2024) lived a life blending the cultures of East and West. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1973 to 2002 (longer than any other conductor in the orchestra's history), and from 2002 to 2010 was music director of the Vienna State Opera.\n\nWhile he was a student in Japan, Ozawa suffered a rugby accident in which he broke two fingers. It ended his piano playing, but his music teacher suggested he take up conducting instead.\n\nIn 1960 he came to the U.S. and attended the Tanglewood Music Center, where he was spotted by New York Philharmonic conductor Leonard Bernstein, who appointed him assistant conductor for the Philharmonic's 1961-62 season. Making his New York debut at age 25, The New York Times praised Ozawa: \"The music came brilliantly alive under his direction.\"\n\nOzawa led various groups, including orchestras in San Francisco and Toronto, before being named head of the BSO in 1970. The first Asian conductor to reach such professional levels in the West, he brought star quality and a tremendous physicality to the podium, and helped raise the international reputations of both Boston's orchestra and the music center at Tanglewood.\n\nHis presence extended beyond the concert hall. In 1998 he led choruses on five continents in a live-via-satellite performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony for the opening of the Nagano Winter Olympic Games. He earned two Emmys for his TV broadcasts, and in November 2022 he beamed a performance of Beethoven's \"Egmont\" Overture to Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata at the International Space Station, as part of the \"One Earth Mission – Unite with Music\" initiative.\n\n\"Music can link the hearts of people - transcending words, borders, religion, and politics,\" Ozawa said in a statement. \"It is my hope that through music, we can be reminded that we are all of the same human race living on the same planet ... and that we are united.\"\n\nHe also co-founded the Saito Kinen Orchestra in 1984 (they won a Grammy for best opera recording in 2016), and was artistic director and founder of the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival, a music and opera festival in Japan. He received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2015.\n\nSpeaking with \"Sunday Morning\" in 1998, Ozawa likened leading an orchestra to skiing. \"When I conduct, concentration is most important that moment, and I forget everything but that moment, this music. Ski, I think, same, when you come down slow, you cannot think other things, just have to concentrate.\"\n\nToby Keith\n\nA singer, actor, and businessman, country artist Toby Keith (July 8, 1961-February 5, 2024) thought of himself first and foremost a songwriter. \"God's gift to me was to be a writer,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006, \"and that's what I do best of all, and I'm as gifted at that as anybody.\" Gifted enough to sell 40 million records and run his own record label.\n\nKeith grew up in Oklahoma, played a bit of semi-pro football, and worked in the oil fields until jobs dried up. All the while, he struggled to make it in country music. When his debut album was released in 1993, the song \"Should've Been a Cowboy,\" went to #1 on the country charts.\n\nHe would log 42 Top 10 hits on the Billboard country charts, with 20 peaking at #1, including \"How Do You Like Me Now?!,\" \"I Wanna Talk About Me,\" \"I Love This Bar,\" \"Whiskey Girl,\" \"As Good As I Once Was,\" \"Red Solo Cup,\" and \"Beer For My Horses\" (a duet with Willie Nelson).\n\nBut the song that made Keith a superstar was his emotional response to the attacks of 9/11. He said that he wrote \"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue\" in 20 minutes, just days after the attacks, partly as a tribute to his father, a veteran. Subtitled \"The Angry American,\" the song doesn't mince words:\n\nYou'll be sorry that you messed with the US of A,\n\nbecause we'll put a boot in your ass,\n\nit's the American way.\n\nThe song brought him much attention, pro and con, including a public feud with the Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines, who called it ignorant. Keith rode the song and the controversy all the way to the bank.\n\nHe followed with \"American Soldier,\" which become a favorite of U.S. forces overseas, many of whom attended his USO tours. But standing with the troops didn't mean he stood with America's decision to go into Iraq. \"When the Iraq war started, I was a little mad because we didn't finish what we started in Afghanistan,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"But our troops had to move on into Iraq, our government asked them to go do it for whatever reason. We won't know for probably 20 or 30 years whether it was the right thing to do or not.\"\n\nAnd while the songs meant many pegged Keith as conservative, he said he disappointed many Republicans who called him for support: \"They go, 'You're a Republican, right?' And you go, 'Well, I'm actually a lot of times Democrat.' And then they go, 'Oh, sorry.' And the Democrats want so bad, the real liberals really want to hate me, and then they go, 'I still hate you, but I can't believe you're a Democrat.' … So, I'm not a real political guy. I'm a very patriotic guy.\"\n\nCarl Weathers\n\nAfter three years of playing professional football, Carl Weathers (January 14, 1948-February 2, 2024) transitioned to Hollywood action star, bringing a towering physicality and deft humor to roles in such films as \"Rocky,\" \"Predator,\" and \"Happy Gilmore.\"\n\nGrowing up in New Orleans, Weathers had performed in plays in grade school. But he pursued football, playing college ball at San Diego State University (while majoring in theater), and playing linebacker for the Oakland Raiders in 1970. Afterwards, he played two years in the Canadian Football League, while taking acting lessons in the offseason at San Francisco State University.\n\nHe had appearances in such TV series as \"Kung Fu,\" \"The Six Million Dollar Man,\" \"S.W.A.T.,\" and \"Cannon,\" and the blaxploitation film \"Friday Foster,\" before taking on his best-known role: Apollo Creed, the world-champion boxer whom the seemingly outmatched Rocky Balboa faces in the ring, in the 1976 Oscar-winner \"Rocky.\"\n\nIn a 2015 interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Weathers recalled that he was asked to audition with the film's writer, Stallone (an actor with few credits at that time). Weathers read the scene but felt it didn't work. He remarked, \"I could do a lot better if you got me a real actor to work with.\"\n\nThe verbal jab – instead of putting him off – made Stallone feel it was in character with Apollo Creed. \"Sometimes the mistakes are the ones that get you the gig,\" Weathers said. Or, the falsehoods (he lied that he had boxing experience).\n\nWeathers returned to the character of Creed in three \"Rocky\" sequels, meeting his end against the steroid-infused Soviet boxer Ivan Drago in \"Rocky IV.\"\n\nWeathers also played an imposing military policeman in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" and appeared in \"Semi-Tough,\" \"Force 10 From Navarone,\" and \"Death Hunt,\" bef"
