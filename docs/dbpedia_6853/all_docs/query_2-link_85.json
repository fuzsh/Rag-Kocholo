        "text": "PETER Andre has posted an emotional tribute to his late brother Andrew nine years after he died.\n\nHe was left devastated by the 54-year-old's untimely passing in 2012 and today marked his birthday with a special message on Instagram.\n\nPeter reposted his other brother Michael's emotional graphic showing how long it has been since his death in months, days and even seconds.\n\nWritten in white over a black background, the post read: \"108 months, 3,285 days, 78.840 hours, 4.730.400 minutes, 283,824.000 seconds, 9 years. Not a moment goes by I don't miss you my brother,\" followed by a grey heart emoji.\n\nIn the original post, Michael tagged his siblings. Pete then added his own caption alongside the post when he re-shared it, writing: \"Miss you brother.\"\n\nAndrew died in December 2012 after a ten-month battle with kidney cancer.\n\nPete was left devastated by his death and today told his fans how much he is missing him - nine years after he died.\n\nPete's followers flooded his most recent Instagram post with kind comments.\n\nIn the new video, he said: \"OK so this is a full dress rehearsal for Miss World and the show goes on tonight.\n\n\"It happens to be nine years since we as a family lost our brother.\n\n\"I'm obviously very sad today but I also know that if he were here, he would love to be watching this from Australia.\n\n\"So it's a bittersweet day so here it goes. Tonight Miss World 2021 live to the world and I know exactly who I'm doing this for.\n\n\"I wish they were here to watch this, so love you bro.\"\n\nHe ended the video with the words \"Still think of you everyday. Rest brother rest\" emblazoned across the screen.\n\nOne user commented: \"He is watching over you.\"\n\nWhile another fan added: \"He'd be so proud of you! Enjoy tonight knowing he's there watching over you.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a third follower shared: \"Your brother will always walk through life with you and he will definitely be with you tonight.\"\n\nPeter struggled to cope with Andrew's death and begged his wife Emily to leave him as he battled depression in the aftermath.\n\nPeter previously said of his brother's diagnosis: \"I was horrified, so shocked, and I broke down.\n\n\"The tears were just rolling down my face and I’ve cried every day since.\"\n\nAndrew was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2012 and Pete took time off from his hectic schedule to be with him.\n\nSadly he passed away in the December of that year, leaving a huge void in Pete’s life.\n\nIn 2016, Peter spoke out on how the death of his sibling affected his mental health during an appearance on ITV's This Morning with Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield.\n\nThe star told the hosts how he and his family struggled to come to terms with. what happened.\n\nHe said: \"We are so close that the pain is as great whoever it is and it happened to be our eldest brother, who was quite young, and it tore us apart,\" he told them.\n\n“We have not to this day - three, four years later sat down as a family and talked about it.\n\n\"We just sort of move it away because it literally is still so raw.\""
