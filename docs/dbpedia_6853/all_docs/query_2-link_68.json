        "text": "Cancer in Dogs\n\nIt's heartbreaking when you receive a cancer diagnosis...\n\nWe received our first cancer diagnosis in 2020 and our second in 2021. Cancer rates in dogs are high and I've always known that this devastating disease who land at our doorstep someday but I still wasn't prepared.\n\nI've learned a lot about canine cancer and share everything that I'm doing to extend our dogs' lives. Sydney didn't survive her diagnosis (it was caught too late). However, my experience with Sydney helped me catch Scout's cancer early. He lived for more than 520 days post diagnosis.\n\nFollow Our Cancer Journey\n\nHemangiosarcoma (HSA)\n\nOn August 5, 2020, we received the devastating news that our dog, Sydney, had cancer and it had spread. Five weeks later, we said goodbye to our sweet girl. I documented our experience to save you time, give you hope, and share what to expect.\n\nSydney was too far gone when she was diagnosed with cancer, but I believe feeding fresh food, keeping her comfortable (and active when she was able) extended her life. I recommend Hemangiosarcoma Diet & Supplement Protocols for dogs – A holistic Approach for support and amazing information and inspiration success stories.\n\nIt's tempting to begin mourning your dog after a devastating diagnosis, but as long as my dog is still breathing, then I'm going to appreciate every second. There will be plenty of times for tears after our dog passes on.\n\nCanine Lymphoma\n\nIn February 2021, Scout was diagnosed with lymphoma. I discovered a lump in his neck region, which were his very swollen lymph nodes. Unlike our experience with Sydney, I caught Scout's cancer early.\n\nI chose the CHOP chemotherapy protocol because Scout's form of cancer is most responsive to chemo. He went into remission within the first month of chemo and remained in remission for 10 months. He came out of remission in December 2021 and I chose to start him on the new Laverdia cancer drug.\n\nWe switched to a new protocol in March 2022, which gave us more time with our dog. Scout transitioned peacefully in August 2022. We got over 520 days with our dogs after his cancer diagnosis and he was healthy, active, and happy until the end.\n\nDeveloping a Canine Cancer Protocol\n\nAlthough Sydney wasn't with us for long after her diagnosis, I learned a lot from that experience that prepared me for Scout's diagnosis six months later. As I was researching canine cancer, I knew that my goal with Scout (and all of our dogs) is to:\n\nsupport their immune system\n\npromote gut health\n\npromote cellular health\n\nhelping the body naturally detox\n\ngive my dogs more healthy days\n\nI found several resources that helped me develop Scout's cancer protocol (linked below). If you're reading this because you're trying to develop a protocol for your dog, please check out the following resources and review my protocol to see if what I'm doing will work for your dog.\n\nCanine Cancer Resources\n\nDr. Kendra Pope – is an integrative veterinarian oncologist that is highly respected. She's spoken at the Healthy Dog Expo and is a wealth of information about holistic cancer treatments and more.\n\nA Path With Paws – I learned a lot about Chinese herbs following this blog and used the information here to choose the herbs that I add to Scout's diet.\n\nDr Sue Cancer Vet – a traditional veterinarian who has created a helpful library of videos explaining various cancers and their treatments on YouTube.\n\nDog Cancer Support | The Dog Cancer Survival Guide – this is a group with helpful information. You'll have to buy and read their book to join their group. There is also a blog with a lot of useful information.\n\nHemangiosarcoma Diet & Supplement Protocols for dogs – Alternative Approach – the absolute BEST canine cancer group on Facebook with a wealth of information and a supportive community.\n\nAngela Ardolino of CBD Dog Health – Angela has a website where she shares the cancer protocol she created for her dog. I took a lot of her information when I was creating one for Scout.\n\nAllie's Crew by Peter Ciancarelli – whenever the topic of canine cancer comes up, this group is recommended by a few pet parents. This is a support group where you can connect with and learn from others going through a cancer diagnosis with their dogs – no drama, no selling, just great information.\n\n10 Books Raw Feeders Should Check Out in 2022\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I took a few days off to decompress and decided to do something that I haven't done in years - I spent a couple of hours in a used bookstore. I opened my phone and looked for a \"bookstore near me\" and discovered that there are several...\n\nread more\n\nLaverdia | A New Cancer Drug for Dogs {Review}\n\nIn 2021, the FDA gave conditional approval to a new drug for dogs diagnosed with canine lymphoma, Laverdia.
