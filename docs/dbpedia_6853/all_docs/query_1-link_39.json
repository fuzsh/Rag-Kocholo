I'm running a Faith-based build, presently lingering on 16 STR and 12 DEX, with my primary weapon being Straight Sword of Astora. Having recently bested O&S, I've seen that my damage is starting to peter out, and wondered about maybe investing in a Raw weapon to compensate for my lack of stats. So I'm curious, would it be worth investing the souls into a Raw weapon, and if so, what would be the better weapon to ascend?",
