        "text": "Between 2013 and 2015, a total of 103,684 participants wore an Axivity AX3 accelerometer (Axivity, Ltd, Newcastle Upon Tyne, U.K.) on their dominant wrist continuously for 24 h per day over a period of 7 days. Standard procedures were used for device calibration, and nonwear periods were detected using established methods (18). Participants with a minimum of 3 valid wear days, defined as wearing the accelerometer for at least 16 h per day, were included in the analysis. Physical activity intensity was determined in 10-s intervals using a validated machine-learning accelerometer-based two-level random forest classifier. Physical activity was first classified into one of four activity classes: sedentary, standing utilitarian movements (e.g., ironing a shirt, washing dishes), walking (e.g., active commuting, mopping floors), or running/high-energy activities (active play with children). These activity classes were then assigned to one of four activity intensities: sedentary, light, moderate, or vigorous (16,17,19). Walking activities were classified as light (an acceleration value of <100 mg), moderate (≥100 mg), or vigorous (≥400 mg) intensity. As described previously (9), this two-level physical activity classification scheme minimized the possibility of false-positive MVPA from stationary activities with high wrist movement, such as ironing or cleaning dishes, because an activity had to be classified first by level 1 as an ambulatory activity and then by level 2 as moderate or vigorous. Similar to in a previous study (20), to assess physical activity timing, participants were categorized into morning (6 a.m. to <12 p.m.), afternoon (12 p.m. to <6 p.m.), and evening MVPA (6 p.m. to <12 a.m.) groups based on when the majority of their MVPA occurred in bouts lasting ≥3 min (e.g., participants undertaking 40%, 30%, and 30% of their total MVPA bouts in the morning, afternoon, and evening, respectively, would be assigned to morning MVPA). Although a previous study categorized morning MVPA as 5 a.m. to 11 a.m., midday-afternoon MVPA as 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., and evening MVPA as 5 p.m. to 12 a.m. (21), we elected to categorize participants into one of three 6-h time windows, as per a previous study (20), to allow for three even 6-h timing windows. The choice of the ≥3-min bout length aimed to better capture aerobic-based MVPA, known for its established benefits in improving cardiometabolic health in adults with obesity (22), as well as its association with reduced cardiovascular risk (9). Participants who did not accumulate at least one MVPA bout lasting ≥3 min in the morning, afternoon, or evening were categorized as having no aerobic physical activity bouts, irrespective of the total minutes of physical activity accumulated. Additionally, we calculated the total time spent undertaking MVPA (regardless of bout length) and MVPA accrued from bouts lasting <3 min.\n\nOur sample for all-cause mortality included 29,836 participants, with a mean age of 62.2 years (SD ±7.7) at baseline; 53.2% were female, and 46.8% were either current or previous smokers. A total of 2,995 participants had a prevalent T2D diagnosis at baseline. During an average follow-up time of 7.9 years (SD ±0.8), corresponding to 236,387 person-years, 1,425 deaths occurred. The sample for CVD analyses included 24,660 participants with 3,980 events, and the MVD analysis sample included 28,455 participants with 2,162 events (Supplementary Fig. 1). Throughout the week, participants in the reference group averaged fewer than one MVPA bout per day, whereas the morning MVPA group averaged 4.8 bouts per day in the morning, the afternoon MVPA group averaged 5.0 bouts per day in the afternoon, and the evening MVPA group averaged 3.4 bouts per day in the evening. Participant characteristics by physical activity timing group are listed in Table 1.\n\nTable 1\n\n. No aerobic bouts . Morning . Afternoon . Evening . Overall .

The 5-year all-cause mortality risk was 25–32% lower for participants in the evening MVPA group (1.79%; 95% CI 2.31%, 1.27%) than for those in the morning (2.64%; 95% CI 3.08%, 2.21%) or afternoon MVPA (2.43%; 95% CI 2.81%, 2.05%) group. Participants in the reference group had a 5-year mortality risk of 4.02% (95% CI 4.48%, 3.57%). This pattern was consistent for the 5-year risk of CVD incidence. For MVD incidence, the 5-year risk was similar between morning, afternoon, and evening MVPA groups and 20–24% lower than that of the reference group (e.g., 5-year risk 5.86%; 95% CI 6.59%, 5.13% vs. 7.78%; 95% CI 8.44%, 7.12% for morning MVPA group vs. reference group). Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3 show the dose-response association for aerobic MVPA (≥3 min) bout duration and frequency. Overall, the magnitude of association was stronger for activity bout frequency (e.g., nadir of the curve HR 0.39 for all-cause mortality) than for activity bout duration (nadir of the curve HR 0.59 for all-cause mortality).\n\nThe analyses for negative control outcomes suggested that residual and unmeasured confounding likely had a minimal impact on the findings. Specifically, with the negative control outcome, the HR point estimate pattern was inconsistent relative to the main analyses, with no significant associations for any of the physical activity timing groups (Supplementary Fig. 7). Additional analyses controlling for LDL and HDL, blood pressure, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index, season of accelerometer wear time, ethnicity, employment status, and diet quality index were consistent with our main analyses (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Consistent results for all-cause mortality were observed after excluding participants with prevalent CVD and cancer (n = 5,258) (Supplementary Fig. 8). The mortality risk ranged from 0.48 (95% CI 0.36, 0.65) for evening MVPA to 0.66 (95% CI 0.56, 0.78) for morning MVPA. Furthermore, separating the no aerobic bouts reference group into those meeting and not meeting physical activity guidelines (i.e., <150 min of MVPA/week) showed that meeting physical activity guidelines did not lower the risk of mortality or CVD or MVD incidence, if no aerobic bouts were undertaken (Supplementary Figs. 9, 10, and 11). Physical activity timing from bouts lasting <3 min was not associated with a lower risk of mortality or CVD or MVD incidence (Supplementary Figs. 12, 13, and 14). The sensitivity analyses in nonshift workers yielded consistent results (Supplementary Table 7). When undertaking sensitivity analyses to control for more even temporal distributions of aerobic MVPA (i.e., participants not undertaking >50% of total aerobic MVPA in one of the three time windows), the results showed that evening MVPA was associated with the lowest incidence rates in all outcomes relative to afternoon and morning MVPA, although similar to the primary analyses, there was little difference between timing groups for MVD. When compared with activity in the mixed MVPA group, evening MVPA was associated with the lowest risk of mortality, and with a similar incidence of CVD. Mixed MVPA was associated with the lowest incidence of MVD (Supplementary Figs. 15, 16, and 17). Finally, there was an inverse dose-response association between total MVPA, including both aerobic and nonaerobic bouts (any bout length), and all-cause mortality and CVD and MVD incidence (Supplementary Fig. 18).\n\nIncreasing MVPA is a proven strategy for effectively managing cardiometabolic risk in adults with obesity and related disorders. This study, to our knowledge, is the first to determine the associations between objectively measured aerobic MVPA timing, all-cause mortality, and incidence of CVD and MVD in adults with obesity. These findings demonstrate a compelling connection between MVPA timing and a lower risk of morbidity and mortality in adults with obesity, including those with T2D. Building upon previous clinical studies (14,15), our analyses underscore the consistent association of evening MVPA with the lowest risk in mortality, as well as strong associations with the incidence of CVD and MVD, when compared with not undertaking aerobic MVPA bouts. These findings are robust and extend to the subset of participants with T2D, in whom evening MVPA exhibited even more pronounced associations with mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that when controlling for more even temporal distributions of aerobic MVPA, evening MVPA was associated with the greatest reduction in mortality, whereas more evenly spread MVPA was associated with the greatest reduction in MVD incidence. Finally, the frequency of aerobic bouts seems to be a more important factor in their association with mortality and CVD and MVD incidence than the duration of aerobic MVPA. Although additional well-designed clinical studies are required to confirm these findings, these observational data suggest that MVPA timing may play a significant role in optimizing MVPA-related interventions among adults contending with obesity and T2D.\n\nInsulin resistance, a common feature in both obesity and T2D, denotes impairments in insulin-mediated processes such as glucose uptake, metabolism, and storage across diverse cell types, including adipocytes, hepatocytes, and skeletal muscle (27). Recognized as a key driver of obesity-related disease and aging (27,28), insulin resistance maintains an inverse association with mortality, independent of body weight (29). Although MVPA per se exhibits an inverse relationship with insulin resistance (30) and is linked to a lower mortality risk among individuals with or susceptible to T2D (31,32), the potential impact of undertaking MVPA during specific time windows on morbidity and mortality remains unclear. Previous findings have shown that MVPA performed in the evening is associated with the greatest improvement in insulin sensitivity (+25%) among adults with or without T2D (20). Our findings add to previous reports by showing that when controlling for total MVPA volume, the timing of MVPA, particularly in the evening, is linked with the lowest risk in all-cause mortality. Additionally, the frequency of aerobic MVPA bouts demonstrated a greater inverse association with mortality risk than the total volume of MVPA, highlighting that accumulating bouts of MVPA within specific timing windows or throughout the day may lead to improved health outcomes.\n\nThe robust findings of this study are in line with previously published cohort (20) and clinical studies (14,15). However, it is important to note that these findings differ from those of other similar studies (21). For example, a recent study by Feng et al. (21) showed that afternoon or mixed MVPA but not evening MVPA was associated with a lower mortality risk and CVD incidence than morning MVPA. These seemingly disparate findings may be explained by methodological differences. Firstly, Feng et al. selected morning MVPA as the reference group, whereas in our study, the reference group reflected individuals who did not undertake any aerobic MVPA. Furthermore, where our study focused on individuals with obesity, Feng et al. included individuals from the general population with and without obesity, which likely affected the results, given the association between obesity, circadian misalignment, and metabolic dysfunction (10,11). This may explain why, even when undertaking a sensitivity analysis to account for more even temporal distributions of MVPA, evening MVPA was still associated with a greater reduction in mortality and equal reduction in CVD incidence compared with activity in the mixed group.\n\nAmong adults with T2D, more than half of all deaths are related to CVD-related events, including myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke (33). The results of this study showed that when compared with other MVPA timing windows, evening MVPA was associated with the lowest incidence of CVD among adults with obesity, including those with T2D. Although further research is needed to uncover the precise mechanism behind this association, our findings align with previous studies indicating that moderate- or vigorous-intensity exercise performed in the evening may be linked to lower mean arterial blood pressure, whereas among morning exercisers, it was increased (34). Similarly, research suggests that evening, but not morning, aerobic exercise can lead to significant reductions in clinic and ambulatory blood pressure, through improvements in systemic vascular resistance and vasomotor sympathetic modulation, as demonstrated in a 10-week randomized trial involving 50 men with hypertension (35).\n\nAn important finding of this study was that aerobic MVPA, regardless of timing, was linked to a reduced risk of MVD. Although the sensitivity analyses revealed that mixed MVPA, followed by evening MVPA, was associated with the greatest reduction in MVD incidence, the differences between the timing windows (morning, afternoon, and evening) were minimal and nonsignificant. This finding highlights the role of MVPA in MVD prevention, and may be explained, in part, by the effects of MVPA on hyperglycemia and oxidative stress, which directly contribute to MVD development and progression (36). For example, findings from a previous clinical study demonstrated that moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise directly improved microvascular function through improvements in redox balance via increased nitric oxide production (37). Furthermore, in addition to the well-established effects of chronic exercise on glycemia (38), it may be that more frequent episodes of contraction-stimulated glucose uptake into skeletal muscle may reduce hyperglycemic excursions throughout the day. This hypothesis is further supported by the significant association between frequency of MVPA and MVD demonstrated in our results. Thus, it seems plausible that these separate mechanistic pathways may have an additive interaction, thereby reducing the risk of MVD; however, additional studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nFor adults with obesity and T2D, where blood glucose regulation is an ongoing challenge, the results of this study highlight that evening MVPA may yield the greatest benefits in terms of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although the precise mechanisms driving this observation remain unclear, the concept of the dawn phenomenon, suggesting that T2D impairs the circadian rhythm, may offer insights. Individuals with T2D, partly due to desynchronized rhythms, often experience relatively better insulin sensitivity and glycemia in the evening, which progressively worsens overnight to the early morning (12,39). Therefore, engaging in MVPA later in the afternoon or evening, when postprandial glycemia is highest and hepatic insulin sensitivity begins to decline, may elicit the greatest metabolic benefits by directly influencing these pathways and leading to lower morning fasting glucose levels (12). Additionally, because β-cell function and glucose tolerance are reduced in the circadian evening (11), particularly in individuals with T2D, MVPA at this time may improve β-cell function when it is needed most. Additional well-designed clinical studies are required to delve deeper into these findings; however, this theory finds support, in part, in a recent prospective study and meta-analysis indicating that MVPA/exercise performed later in the day was associated with the greatest improvements in glucose control (13,40).\n\nAcknowledgments.
