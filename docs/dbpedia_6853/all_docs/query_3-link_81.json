        "text": "Cayley Mandadi, 19, was a sophomore at Trinity University when she was brought to a Texas hospital on Oct. 29, 2017. She was nearly naked, bruised and not breathing. Her sometime boyfriend Mark Howerton told doctors they'd taken ecstasy at a music festival and she passed out after consensual sex in his car. She died at the hospital.\n\nIn February 2018, authorities charged Howerton with Mandadi's murder, alleging her cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. A year later, Howerton's trial ended with a hung jury.\n\nA new trial was set for 2023. Mandadi's mother Alison Steele and stepfather Lawrence Baitland believed for the second trial jurors needed more information about what happened inside Howerton's car. Steele, a scientist, and Baitland, a NASA engineer, launched their own investigation.\n\n\"I needed to be able to show the jury what happened to Cayley,\" Baitland told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant.\n\nUsing autopsy photos and consulting with experts, they developed a theory.\n\nWould the couple's investigation change the course of the second trial?\n\nCAYLEY MANDADI'S FINAL HOURS\n\nCayley Mandadi and Taylor Clement, best friends since ninth grade, had a streak – Snapchatting every morning.\n\nTaylor Clement: Every single day. … She was much more of a morning person. So I would get mine first thing in the morning.\n\nBut on Monday morning, Oct. 30, 2017, there was no word from Cayley.\n\nTaylor Clement: I didn't get a Snapchat at 8 o'clock in the morning, like I usually do. … That's actually how I knew something was really wrong.\n\nBoth good students, they bonded in science class. Clement says she was instantly drawn to Cayley.\n\nTaylor Clement: She had like, a really infectious smile and the big eyes and like, the loving heart.\n\nThe two separated to go to different colleges. That October morning, Cayley was on Clement's mind.\n\nTaylor Clement: As I'm working in the library, it's in the back of my head, like, I haven't heard from her.\n\nClement didn't know it, but just hours earlier, Cayley's mother Alison Steele and stepfather Lawrence Baitland were awakened at 4 a.m. with horrifying news.\n\nLawrence Baitland: \"Your daughter's been involved in some incident, and she has been life-flighted to Kyle, Texas.\"\n\nThey raced from their home in Houston to the hospital, praying Cayley was OK.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What was it like when you entered that room? What did you see?\n\nAlison Steele: I saw my daughter's body smashed.\n\nLawrence Baitland: I could see that she was on a ventilator … and my heart just stopped. And I knew that it was bad.\n\nWithin hours, Cayley's parents were told there was no hope for recovery. Their daughter, just 19 years old, once so full of life, was soon declared brain dead. Baitland and Steele want the world to know what happened to her.\n\nAlison Steele: All that potential had been destroyed. And not knowing how it happened. Or how it was even possible.\n\nThey invited Cayley's friends to see her one last time. Clement sat with Steele as she held Cayley's hand and prayed.\n\nTaylor Clement: I remember her repeating over and over, \"this has to be for something, this has to be for something.\"\n\nCayley had previously requested that her organs be donated to help others. As she was taken to surgery for that procedure, her parents said goodbye.\n\nAlison Steele: It was very emotional. … But, of course, we didn't want to let her go. But this is what had to be.\n\nJust days before, things seemed to be going well for Cayley. A sophomore communications major at Trinity University in San Antonio, she had joined a sorority and was a cheerleader. And she'd met a boy.\n\nAlison Steele: Cayley at the time was very much in love with the only serious boyfriend she had ever had. His name was Jett Birchum.\n\nBirchum was a Trinity football player and fraternity brother. Cayley dated him freshman year, but they broke up.\n\nAlison Steele: What she told me was, \"I don't know that he wants a serious relationship.\" And she did.\n\nTaylor Clement: I think that part of her life got very murky for her very fast.\n\nThere was another man in Cayley's life. Mark Howerton was 22 years old and had been a star high school baseball player.\n\nHowerton lived in Houston but was often on Trinity's campus visiting friends. That's where he met Cayley.\n\nJohn Hunter: I think that they're both very beautiful people and I think that that was the primary attraction.\n\nJohn Hunter is Howerton's lawyer.\n\nJohn Hunter: I think that there were problems with her relationship with Jett. … And Mark was offering an alternative to that.\n\nBoth Jett and Mark knew Cayley was seeing the other man and neither, friends say, liked the competition. Then, just one month into this new relationship, Mark Howerton rushes Cayley to a small rural hospital in Luling, Texas.\n\nWhile medical staff tended to Cayley, police officers interviewed Howerton in the quietest place they could find – the hospital chapel. It was recorded on the officer's bodycam.\n\nDEPUTY CALENTINE (to Howerton/bodycam video): So tell me, where were y'all at today?\n\nHowerton told officers that he and Cayley went to the Mala Luna Music Festival. There they drank alcohol and took MDMA – a drug known as Molly or ecstasy.\n\nChristy Jack is an attorney based in Fort Worth. \"48 Hours\" asked her to look at files in this case. She says things took a troubling turn at the music festival.\n\nChristy Jack: They saw Jett Birchum at some point and began to argue.\n\nHowerton says sometime after 4 p.m., he and Cayley left in his Mercedes — still arguing after Cayley told him she still had feelings for Jett.\n\nMARK HOWERTON (police interview): I was pretty much saying … You need to get over this dude. He ain't worth your time. ... your friends are fake as — I was just telling her all this s*** … I was trying to get it through her head …\n\nHowerton said they then stopped in a parking lot where they had make-up sex.\n\nMARK HOWERTON (police interview): We were having sex. I choked her. But it wasn't like I was killing her. It wasn't — it wasn't like that.\n\nRough, said Howerton, but consensual.\n\nMARK HOWERTON (police interview): 500 percent consensual.\n\nMARK HOWERTON (police interview): After we had sex like she still talked to me for five, six, minutes afterwards …That's when she was like, \"I'm not feeling good\" but then she just passed out.\n\nThey got back on the road. Hours passed. Howerton says at some point Cayley stopped breathing. And he tried to resuscitate her.\n\nChristy Jack: And at 10:30 at night … he sees a sign … that indicates a hospital … at the next exit. He pulls off.\n\nEmergency medical workers told investigators they instantly knew Cayley was in bad shape. She was nearly naked, bruised, and had no pulse.\n\nChristy Jack: You have a — a paramedic or a nurse who says these bruises were on her when she arrived at the hospital in Luling.\n\nMARK HOWERTON (police interview): Why wasn't she responding? (puts his hands in his lap)\n\nHowerton told the police officer Cayley already had bruises on her legs earlier in the day.\n\nMARK HOWERTON (police interview): She bruises easy. I — she — look, seriously, she gets drunk, and she falls over and she bruises.\n\nPolice interviewed Howerton several times, but he was not charged with any crime related to Cayley's death. Then, three months later, her autopsy report was released. The medical examiner ruled that Cayley had died from blunt force face and head trauma; it was ruled a homicide. Mark Howerton was charged with murder. He pleaded not guilty and was released on bail.\n\nJohn Hunter: There were large amounts of drugs taken over the course of this weekend. Mr. Howerton brought the deceased to a hospital, which is something you don't typically see.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Murderers don't usually do that.\n\nJohn Hunter: No.\n\nJohn Hunter: The idea that it was open and shut is a mistake.\n\nAs the trial begins, John Hunter says he has evidence that will surprise the jury.\n\nMARK HOWERTON GOES ON TRIAL FOR THE MURDER OF CAYLEY MANDADI\n\nIn December 2019, two years after Cayley Mandadi's disturbing demise, Mark Howerton is finally brought to trial for allegedly kidnapping, assaulting and murdering her.\n\nJUDGE: How do you plead, Mr. Howerton.\n\nMARK HOWERTON: Not guilty, your honor.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What was it like to see Mark Howerton in the courtroom?\n\nAlison Steele: Like everybody else, I'd try not to look at him too much.\n\nThe trial begins with prosecutor Alessandra Cranshaw's opening statement.\n\nALESSANDRA CRANSHAW (in court): I think the best way to tell this story … is to start where Cayley Mandadi's life ended. And that's in the car of this defendant.\n\nProsecutors allege that Howerton forcefully escorted Cayley from the Mala Luna Music Festival to his car. He then drove her to a parking lot where he sexually assaulted and beat her, causing a fatal brain bleed. Cranshaw presented photos showing Cayley's condition about 18 hours after she arrived at the hospital.\n\nALESSANDRA CRANSHAW (in court): Cayley is covered with bruises from head to toe … I believe that you will have no reservations about finding this defendant guilty of the offense of murder.\n\nJOHN HUNTER (in court):Things are not always as they seem.\n\nIn his opening statement, defense attorney John Hunter attacks the very foundation of the prosecution's case.\n\nJOHN HUNTER (in court): Mark Howerton did not cause Cayley's death.\n\nJOHN HUNTER (in court): No one saw anything that transpired between Mark Howerton and Cayley Mandadi that evening on the 29th. There are no eyewitnesses.\n\nThe state begins its case with paramedic Sharyl Lane, who was driving an ambulance up to the Luling hospital that night when a vehicle suddenly appeared behind her.\n\nSHARYL LANE (in court): There's a black car behind us honking and flashing the lights. … Before I even get out, I see a gentleman that's hollering and screaming. I open the door. He's telling me that — his girlfriend is not breathing. And he needs help.\n\nWhen Lane looked inside Howerton's car, she saw a disturbing scene.\n\nSHARYL LANE (in court): She was exposed … And her pants and her clothes … were in the floorboard by her feet. … She … had bruises on her, just multiple bruises that I just remember seeing. … that's when I started CPR.\n\nBut Hunter says not everyone at the hospital believed Cayley had been attacked.\n\nJohn Hunter: The treating physician at the Luling hospital — approached this as a drug overdose.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Wasn't that because Mark had told them he thought she had overdosed?\n\nJohn Hunter: Correct. But the symptoms she was presenting were consistent with that patient history.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Was this woman beaten or not?\n\nJohn Hunter: No.\n\nHunter insists the photos showing bruising on Cayley don't point to foul play.\n\nJohn Hunter: By the time that the sexual assault nurse … photographs her … she has been resuscitated. Six times, I believe. Maybe eight. … She's had a chest tube inserted. She's had IVs placed on both arms. … She's been worked over by those physicians at the Luling hospital in a traumatic way.\n\nWhile the medical team fought for Cayley's life, police interviewed and photographed Mark Howerton. Police officer Chris Adams.\n\nOFFICER CHRIS ADAMS: While I was taking photographs of him. I noticed … the tops of both of his hands.\n\nDAVID LUNAN | Prosecutor: Do they look red to you?\n\nOFFICER CHRIS ADAMS: Yes, sir.\n\nDAVID LUNAN: Unusually red?\n\nOFFICER CHRIS ADAMS: Yes, sir.\n\nEvidence, investigators believe, that Howerton did hit Cayley.\n\nDEPUTY CALENTINE (to Howerton on bodycam): Those actually do look like they have scabs already on them.\n\nThe Mark Howerton arrested after Cayley's death was an enormously muscled, intimidating figure. Cayley's friends say he used steroids.\n\nChristy Jack: … even in such a confined space. … it would've been relatively easy for him to cause that kind of damage to her head.\n\nHowerton initially cooperated with investigators, allowing police to search his Mercedes, where they found a gun and marijuana.\n\nJohn Hunter: If he was worried about himself, he would have told the police to get a warrant.\n\nInstead, Hunter says, Howerton was much more concerned about Cayley.\n\nMARK HOWERTON (police interview): Can I find out an update on her, please? Is there any way?\n\nThe only person who could counter Howerton's story was dead. Investigators hoped Cayley's remains might speak on her behalf. Dr. Suzanna Dana performed the autopsy and said the evidence shows Cayley was beaten to death.\n\nDR. SUZANNA DANA (in court): She had a number of what I call blunt force injuries to her face and her head. …\n\nALESSANDRA CRANSHAW: And what is this that we see behind the ear?\n\nDR. SUZANNA DANA: That's a bruise. That's a contusion.\n\nBut during cross-examination, Hunter gets Dana to admit that at least one Cayley's injuries was caused by her medical care.\n\nJOHN HUNTER (in court): So CPR can cause a lot of different injuries, not just simply superficial ones. Right\n\nDR. SUZANNA DANA: Yes.\n\nJOHN HUNTER: In this case, a rib was broken. Is that correct.\n\nDR. SUZANNA DANA: I believe so. Yes.\n\nWhatever the jury thinks about how Cayley died, they're about to learn much more about her troubled love life with Howerton.\n\nA DEFENSE WITNESS MAKES A STUNNING CLAIM\n\nIn the agonizing final hours of Cayley Mandadi's life, her friends gathered to say goodbye. Cayley's childhood friend Taylor Clement met her college friends for the first time. They bonded talking about Cayley.\n\nTaylor Clement: Even in that situation, she was bringing people close that would've never met before.\n\nSome of those friends now nervously wait to testify in Howerton's murder trial.\n\nALESSANDRA CRANSHAW (in court): Do you recognize this person?\n\nMORGAN SAMPSON: I do.\n\nALESSANDRA CRANSHAW: Who is this individual?\n\nMORGAN SAMPSON (voice breaking): It's Cayley.\n\nHer roommate, Morgan Sampson, told of a stormy history between Cayley and Howerton, including one particularly disturbing incident just a few weeks before Cayley's death. She was planning to go to a party and says Howerton got upset when she invited Cayley to come along.\n\nMORGAN SAMPSON (in court): Mark and Cayley were out on the balcony. And he had thrown her up against the brick wall —\n\nCayley ended up going to that party against Howerton's wishes. Soon, neighbors reported hearing loud banging in Cayley's room. Campus police officer Roderick Lewis was dispatched to investigate.\n\nOFFICER LEWIS (in court): When I arrived at the location … a male subject was exiting the room.\n\nOFFICER LEWIS (bodycam video): And so you're in the room just waiting on her while she's at a party?\n\nMARK HOWERTON: Exactly.\n\nOFFICER LEWIS: OK.\n\nOFFICER LEWIS: ... You mind if I take a look in the room?\n\nMARK HOWERTON: Man, no ...\n\nOFFICER LEWIS: I would like you to step out here with my partner right now.\n\nWhen Lewis did go into Cayley's room, he found the glass door to the balcony was cracked, and Cayley's clothes were scattered in the trees. Friends say Howerton later smashed Cayley's laptop on the street. The university barred him from campus.\n\nCayley told her ex-boyfriend, Jett Birchum, that she wanted to get back with him.\n\nChristy Jack: She was really torn between two different people and both of whom were vying for her affection.\n\nBirchum told the jurors it all came to a head at the music festival.\n\nJETT BIRCHUM (in court): She said she wanted to break up with him at Mala Luna 'cause there'd be plenty of witnesses and people around.\n\nALESSANDRA CRANSHAW: Did she seem worried about breaking up with him?\n\nJETT BIRCHUM: Yes.\n\nHowerton picked Cayley up to go to the music festival. But first they pulled into a nearby carwash to take MDMA, or molly. Howerton said they had more once they got to the festival.\n\nJohn Hunter: We're talking about massive doses, well above what would be necessary for it to affect — be effective — to gain the experience.\n\nWhen Cayley didn't show up on campus that night, her friends started calling her. Howerton answered Cayley's phone.\n\nMORGAN SAMPSON (in court): I was like, \"Have you seen Cayley?\" Or, \"Have you heard from her? Like are you with her?\" And he said, \"She can't talk right now,\" and then hung up the phone.\n\nPanicked, they began searching for Cayley. Jett Birchum, who also attended the festival, says he saw Mark and Cayley move towards the exit… seemingly against Cayley's wishes.\n\nJETT BIRCHUM (in court): Cayley looked like she was tryin' to create space and kinda just get away.\n\nALESSANDRA CRANSHAW: And then what do you see him do?\n\nJETT BIRCHUM: As she's tryin' to step away, I see him reach out his right arm and hook it around her shoulder and pull her in closer. And then turn and walk away.\n\nPeter Van Sant: This is important testimony.\n\nChristy Jack: It's important testimony because it's showing that she's being … being taken someplace against her will.\n\nDefense attorney John Hunter hammers him on cross-examination.\n\nChristy Jack: It immediately falls apart almost from the very first question.\n\nIn his questioning, Hunter confronts Birchum revealing how he initially misled investigators about what he had seen.\n\nJOHN HUNTER (in court): You advised the police that you saw Mark physically pick her up and place her in his car, isn't that correct?\n\nJETT BIRCHUM: Yes, sir.\n\nJOHN HUNTER: And it differs from the testimony that you gave today, right?\n\nJETT BIRCHUM: Yes, sir. … I did not see him put her in the car.\n\nBirchum admits he exaggerated to police. But why? Prosecutors say he was worried about Cayley's safety and wanted to convince cops to search for her. Hunter then challenges Birchum regarding inconsistencies in his testimony to a grand jury about the timeline at the music festival.\n\nJOHN HUNTER (in court): Would it surprise you to learn that the phone call you placed to Cayley Mandadi's phone was made at 7 o'clock?\n\nJETT BIRCHUM: No, sir.\n\nIn an effort to undermine Birchum's credibility, he is asked about an unrelated drug charge.\n\nJOHN HUNTER (in court): You were on probation at the time, were you not, Mr. Birchum?\n\nJETT BIRCHUM: Correct.\n\nIn 47 minutes of brutal questioning, Birchum \"takes the fifth\" 30 times, with his lawyer by his side.\n\nJETT BIRCHUM: … provided by the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe damage was done.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Tell me the impact of him saying over and over that he's taking the fifth?\n\nJohn Hunter: The impact I think can't be understated. It's — it's a huge thing to see somebody do that.\n\nHunter has a star witness of his own — Dr. William Anderson, a forensic pathologist and former medical examiner who reviewed Cayley's autopsy and records for the defense.\n\nDR. WILLIAM ANDERSON (in court): So you look at the autopsy you're going to see—you're going to see what looked like bruises.\n\nAnderson presents the crux of Hunter's case: that Cayley's bruising was caused in part by resuscitation efforts at the hospital, and the organ donation process.\n\nAnderson goes a step further, pointing to a thin line in a photo of Cayley's skull.\n\nDR. WILLIAM ANDERSON (in court, pointing to autopsy photo): Starting here we have this jagged line. So, like I said, it's like a crack in an eggshell, and that is a skull fracture.\n\nA skull fracture, which Hunter says could indicate that Cayley's brain bleed was caused by a fall.\n\nPeter Van Sant: She was in a car.\n\nJohn Hunter: Well, she was in a car for portions of … that day. … Hematomas don't kill people instantaneously.\n\nCHRISTY JACK: I don't think that you can overstate the importance of his testimony from a defense perspective. … It creates the impression that all of these injuries occurred by every other means, but Mark Howerton.\n\nOnce the defense rests, prosecutors bring the medical examiner back to challenge Dr. Anderson's testimony.\n\nALESSANDRA CRANSHAW: Is that a skull fracture?\n\nDR. SUZANNA DANA: No, it's not.\n\nChristy Jack: The faint line that Dr. Anderson was referring to came from a picture. … I didn't believe it. I thought it was reckless for him to have that opinion so definitively with only a picture.\n\nThe jurors must now make a momentous decision. Did Mark Howerton kill Cayley?\n\nPARENTS LAUNCH THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION: \"CAYLEY GUIDED US\"\n\nAfter just 10 hours of deliberating, the jury in the Mark Howerton murder trial sends a note to the judge. There will be no verdict.\n\nJUDGE RAYMOND ANGELINI (reading note): \"After careful deliberation and discussion, unfortunately we cannot come to a unanimous decision.\" Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I am declaring a mistrial.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Mistrial. Are you happy? Is that in a way, a victory for you?\n\nJohn Hunter: Any time that your client doesn't go to prison, it's a victory.\n\nAlison Steele (sighs): It was a little bit disheartening. But at the same time, I was mentally prepared for that outcome.\n\nProsecutors David Lunan and Alessandra Cranshaw were disheartened, too.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you feel as though you'd let the family down?\n\nDavid Lunan: Well, sure.\n\nAlessandra Cranshaw: Yeah.\n\nDavid Lunan: Absolutely.\n\nBut it doesn't end there. The prosecutors plan to retry the case and get busy preparing for round two, starting with the defense star witness, medical examiner Dr. William Anderson.\n\nAlessandra Cranshaw: I was not prepared for Dr. Anderson to testify, uh — to what he testified to.\n\nThey'd been stunned by his claims that Cayley had a skull fracture, and her bruising was caused in part by the organ donation process.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, do you find that this notion that organ harvesting caused these bruises to be absurd?\n\nDavid Lunan: Absurd. Absurd. In this instance, it's absurd.\n\nWhile the prosecutors work to address those claims, defense attorney John Hunter files a motion to get the whole case dismissed, based in part on what he says were Jett Birchum's lies.\n\nJohn Hunter: The knowing use of false evidence by the prosecution undermines our entire faith and confidence in the judicial system. … If that can happen, then there's no point in even having a trial.\n\nCayley's mom Alison Steele and stepdad Lawrence Baitland sat through the first trial and concluded jurors needed more information about what happened inside Mark Howerton's car.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You became investigators?\n\nAlison Steele: We did.\n\nLawrence Baitland: I knew we needed to show what happened in that car. … The jury needed to know how it happened.\n\nShe's a scientist, he's a NASA engineer. They got to work.\n\nLawrence Baitland: I spent hours and hours, um, studying autopsy photos, and I really fixated on one of the autopsy photos that showed an impact on Cayley's head, you know, right in front of her ear.\n\nThe photo of a small dot above Cayley's right ear. Other photos show deep bruising above Cayley's left ear, like the one described by the medical examiner in the first trial.\n\nALESSANDRA CRANSHAW: And what is this that we see behind the ear?\n\nDR. SUZANNA DANA: That's a bruise. That's a contusion.\n\nCayley's parents believe that when taken together, the photos tell a story.\n\nAlison Steele: We believe that of all of the injuries, the blows landed on her … the fatal one occurred when he reached from his driver's seat, hit her in the left ear and drove her head into the window and onto the lock button of the car.\n\nIn fact, in a recorded audio interview with police the day Cayley died, Howerton admitted he had previously done just that.\n\nRANGER RAYMOND BENOIST (police interview): Did you ever push Cayley's head up against the window?\n\nMARK HOWERTON: I pushed her, and she hit the window one time. That was over a week ago, yes.\n\nChristy Jack: So, in many respects, it was like, same song, second verse.\n\nThey'd need proof to convince a jury. Cayley's parents headed to a used car lot, where Steele posed in a car similar to the Mercedes Howerton drove that night.\n\nLawrence Baitland: I'd photographed her head in different positions while I'm holding the autopsy images, trying to see if they match up with the door and it's a near perfect match.\n\nBaitland decided to go a step further.\n\nLawrence Baitland: So, then I loaded this 3D modeling program.\n\nBuilding a 3D model of Cayley's head.\n\nLawrence Baitland: … first thing you can do is you can create a solid out of that 3D mesh. And then … you can project an image onto it.\n\nAnd bringing them closer to having actual proof.\n\nLawrence Baitland: So this gave me the confidence to go to the next step, which was to seek out the killer's car.\n\nMark Howerton sold the car in 2018. Baitland tracked down the new owner and bought the car.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What'd you think of that?\n\nDavid Lunan: Uh, well, this is new. This is, uh, not something I've been, uh, accustomed to hearing, uh, in other cases.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Show me what you believe went down.\n\nLawrence Baitland: Sure.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Let's go over to the passenger side…\n\nThe car Cayley was fatally injured in is sitting in her parent's driveway. Baitland says driving it home was a haunting experience.\n\nLawrence Baitland: It's torturous. Um, but it's also, you know, she was showing us what happened, you know. She was guiding us to this car.\n\nPeter Van Sant (standing outside of the car): You believe that he struck her. When he did, she came over to this knob, her hit — her head, hit it. Now you notice when you push it down, it doesn't go flush.\n\nLawrence Baitland: Right. … This will not retract fully, no matter how hard you hit it.\n\nCayley's parents decided to make a video to demonstrate their theory in court.\n\nChristy Jack: They went and found two actors, a male and a female to dress the parts. They were, um, similar size, similar weight.\n\nLawrence Baitland: If we did the reconstruction ourselves, it would be considered biased and probably thrown out or at least discredited.\n\nSo they hired a private investigator to produce the demonstration. They didn't even look at it in case they were called to testify about it.\n\nThe video is simple: showing three angles of what Cayley's parents and their experts believe happened.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Would showing a jury a video like this potentially help the prosecution's case. If it — if it's allowed?\n\nChristy Jack: Jurors are very visual. … It makes it easier for them.\n\nChristy Jack: It shows how it can happen. And it answers a number of the questions that the jury had in the first trial.\n\nHunter says however Cayley got that dot above her ear, it's all speculation.\n\nJohn Hunter: It could be from something at the hospital, it could have been from something before she got in Mark's car. … Could it be that that is from a locking thing on the door? I mean, sure. It could also be that a space alien came and put a little, you know, mark on her.\n\nJohn Hunter: I almost feel like it's not worth discussing because it's so unscientific.\n\nYears go by. Alison worked to pass the Texas Clear Alert Bill. It enables law enforcement to quickly initiate searches when people aged 18 to 64 go missing. In 2021, a district court in Texas denied John Hunter's motion to dismiss the case, ruling there was no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct relating to Jett Birchum's testimony. Hunter appealed that ruling.\n\nAlison Steele: It was horrible, just waiting and not knowing what was gonna happen.\n\nHunter filed appeals all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case.\n\nJohn Hunter: We lost in every court we could take it to.\n\nAnd so, more than five years after Cayley's death, a date for a second trial is set. May 23, 2023.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What's at stake here? … Are feelings, are emotions running high?\n\nChristy Jack: I don't think the stakes could be any higher.\n\nJUSTICE FOR CAYLEY\n\nIn May 2023, Mark Howerton is about to go on trial for the second time for the murder of Cayley Mandadi.\n\nTaylor Clement: I felt confident that this was her time.\n\nIn the five plus years since Cayley's death, Howerton was active on social media, posting things like, \"Come @ me legally, I'll beat you ...\" — showing little remorse.\n\nMARK HOWERTON (social video post): Wow. 75% of people think I'm guilty. That just means 75% of people in the world…can suck my d***.\n\nChristy Jack: He was living large and bragging about having beaten the state of Texas in a court of law.\n\nHowerton's attorneys John Hunter and Hallie Pease say acting out on social media was his way of coping with the pressure of being falsely accused of murder.\n\nHallie Pease: He was using social media as an outlet for — to relieve some of that tension.\n\nDuring the first trial, jurors had only one charge to consider – felony murder. This time around, lawyers add more charges, including aggravated assault and criminally negligent homicide. Then came time to consider the video Cayley's parents had made.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you want the jurors to see that video?\n\nDavid Lunan: I did, initially.\n\nPresenting the video came with risks, including the risk that Hunter's cross-examination about it might undermine the whole case.\n\nChristy Jack: The judge said I'm gonna let it in. But if so … then the parents are now witnesses and they will no longer be allowed to sit in the trial. … And the prosecution went and talked to the parents, and they decided to withdraw the exhibit.\n\nOn May 23, trial two begins — this one without television cameras. Alessandra Cranshaw's opening argument is nearly the same.\n\nAlessandra Cranshaw: I basically told the jury that … the best way to explain this case … is to start where Cayley Mandadi's life ended and that's in the car with this defendant.\n\nBut there is a big change to the witness list: no Jett Birchum.\n\nChristy Jack: There was nothing to be gained.\n\nAnd prosecutors add a witness - an expert on domestic violence who told jurors Howerton was a textbook abuser, who isolated and manipulated Cayley, and ultimately became enraged and lost control.\n\nA pattern particularly difficult to handle at just 19 years of age.\n\nChristy Jack: I think she had no idea, the dangerous predicament she was in.\n\nJohn Hunter wants jurors to give Howerton the benefit of the doubt.\n\nJohn Hunter: The … presentation of how Cayley looks in the hospital and how she looked at the autopsy does not mean that she was beaten.\n\nHis case, this time around, relies heavily on the testimony of a pharmacologist who said the high levels of MDMA, or ecstasy, in Cayley's system could have caused her brain bleed.\n\nJohn Hunter: I have always felt that that was the major precipitating reason for her death.\n\nBut prosecutors and Cayley's family say Hunter grossly exaggerated the danger of MDMA.\n\nAlison Steele: There's never been a single documented case anywhere of MDMA causing a subdural hematoma.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What do you say to that?\n\nJohn Hunter: Well, first of all, they haven't done much research on this at all.\n\nHunter plans one final witness — the former medical examiner whose testimony about organ donation and a possible skull fracture caused so much damage to the prosecution in the first trial — Dr. William Anderson.\n\nThis time, prosecutors are ready for him, with a new witness, a respected medical examiner who told them Anderson's claims in the first trial were irresponsible.\n\nAlessandra Cranshaw: They realized that we were gonna be more than prepared to shoot down all those claims that he had made in the first trial.\n\nJohn Hunter: I didn't need to have a fight about the skull fracture.\n\nSo the defense rests without Anderson.\n\nLawrence Baitland: It was a shock. … You could hear a gasp in the courtroom …\n\nNow, a second set of 12 people will determine Mark Howerton's fate. It's an agonizing second wait for Cayley's parents.\n\nChristy Jack: This is the moment of truth; will their daughter get justice?\n\nAgonizing for John Hunter, too. He'd spent nearly six years working to keep Howerton free.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So the jury comes back in, what do you hear?\n\nJohn Hunter: The two most beautiful words in the English language, not guilty.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Not guilty of murder.\n\nAlison Steele: My heart sank when we heard not guilty on the murder.\n\nChristy Jack: … they're thinking, dear God, this is the final nightmare. He's gonna walk outtalk the courtroom.\n\nBut there was more. Howerton was convicted of aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury.\n\nDavid Lunan: Everyone was hugging each other and expressing their relief that Mark Howerton was going to prison.\n\nAlison Steele: I turned to my left and eight sheriff officers had assembled to take him to jail. Eight. So, that was their way of saying, \"we're here for you.\" (cries) So, that was a — that was a nice moment to see that.\n\nHowerton was sentenced to the maximum – 20 years in prison. To Cayley's family, it's not nearly enough.\n\nLawrence Baitland: Mark Howerton is a monster, and he does what a monster does.\n\nFor Cayley's friend Taylor Clement, the wound remains raw.\n\nTaylor Clement: I miss my best friend.\n\nBaitland and Steele say they have no regrets about spending time and money on a video the jury never got to see.\n\nLawrence Baitland: It helped us learn what happened. … We would do it over again if we had to.\n\n\"48 Hours\" showed Steele that video for very first time.\n\nAlison Steele: It's hard to see because that's most likely the blow that killed her.\n\nCayley's mom, who prayed something good would come from her daughter's death, continues her fight to help other victims of violence.\n\nAlison Steele: What I would like is for her sacrifice … to help other people. That's what she would want. I have absolutely no doubt about that.\n\nMark Howerton will be eligible for parole in 2033.\n\n\"48 HOURS\" POST MORTEM PODCAST\n\nPeter Van Sant and \"48 Hours\" producer Chris Ritzen discuss following this case for over five years, two trials and the unconventional investigation that Cayley's parents undertook to seek the truth about what happened to their daughter.\n\nProduced by Mary Ann Rotondi and Chris Young Ritzen.
