Read More\n\nI haven't experienced raising a diabetic dog, but the topic of diabetes in dogs has always fascinated me. I have a dog with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI) and wondered if diabetes would follow on the heels of the EPI diagnosis, but it didn't (more below). According to VetSource.com, “1 in every 300 dogs and 1 in 230 cats will develop diabetes during their lifetime,” and these statistics keep rising.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I'm not a veterinarian.\n\nWhat is Diabetes?\n\nDiabetes is when a dog's pancreas loses its ability to produce insulin naturally, or their body overproduces glucagon, the hormone that releases glucose. Source: PeterDobias.com\n\nIn comparison, with EPI, a dog's pancreas loses its ability to produce digestive enzymes.\n\nDogs that are most at risk of contracting diabetes are obese, eat an unhealthy diet, or have been exposed to prolonged steroid treatments. In some cases, a dog can be genetically predisposed to diabetes.\n\nIn my reading, the first line of defense (or treatment) for diabetes is diet, and holistic professionals often recommend switching to a fresh food (raw or home-cooked) diet. If you're reading this and you have a diabetic dog, be sure to speak with your veterinarian about diet and which natural supplements and Chinese herbs would best support your diabetic dog.\n\nDiabetes and Dog Nutrition\n\nIf we feed raw, is diabetes really a risk? According to Dr. Peter Dobias, diabetes is “very rare:”\n\n“[D]iabetes is very rare or virtually absent in dogs who eat a non-processed, grain-free diet of cooked or raw meat, raw bones, organs, and vegetables. It appears that processed food companies either have not done their homework, or they are not being honest with us when they claim that kibble is better than wholesome food. In essence, they are saying that nature is wrong. Based on my experience, providing a balanced, wholesome diet and essential natural supplements eliminates the chances of diabetes almost entirely.”\n\nSource: PeterDobias.com\n\nSymptoms of Diabetes in Dogs\n\nChange in appetite\n\nDehydration\n\nExcessive thirst/increase in water consumption\n\nIncreased urination\n\nLethargy\n\nUnusually sweet-smelling or fruity breath\n\nUrinary Tract Infections\n\nWeight loss\n\nRaw Feeding, Our Dogs, and Diabetes\n\nNone of our dogs have been diagnosed with diabetes, but I understand that it's essential that I remain vigilant about their health. Feeding our dogs a raw food diet doesn't make them bulletproof. Diabetes can be hereditary, and it can develop through nutrition. I would love for every risk to be managed through their diet, but instead, I've found that their diet has inspired me to learn more to ensure I'm doing my best to manage the risks.\n\nCan EPI in Dogs Cause Diabetes?\n\nRodrigo was diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in 2019 after years of suspecting something was up but not finding the root cause of his digestive issues. I successfully managed his gut issues with diet and a digestive supplement for years. And then it stopped working.\n\nRodrigo began losing weight rapidly, and a stool test confirmed that he had EPI. Adding a digestive enzyme to his diet turned everything around for him, but then I became concerned about his risk of developing diabetes.\n\nIt's actually rare for a dog with EPI to also have diabetes, but it's not impossible. For a dog to also have diabetes, there would have to be damage to both the exocrine and endocrine pancreas. However, according to VCA Hospitals, this is rare and only seen in cases where the EPI results from chronic pancreatitis. In these cases, diabetes mellitus (or sugar diabetes) may also exist and diagnosed by a veterinarian.\n\nDoes Prednisone Trigger Diabetes in Dogs?\n\nSteroids are a risk factor for canine diabetes, and I have a dog that is currently on prednisone. Will his treatment lead to diabetes?\n\nI learned that prolonged use of steroids can result in diabetes, especially in dogs already predisposed to diabetes. In Scout's case, his veterinarian can adjust his dosage to correct his system if diabetes presents. Diabetes may also vanish once the medication is stopped.\n\nIf you are concerned about the risk of diabetes, please get in touch with your veterinarian to discuss your dog's specific risks, proper steps, diet, and alternative drugs.\n\nMore Articles about Dogs and Diabetes\n\nBecause it's not always easy to find articles that address health issues from a holistic or natural point of view, I've put together the following list of sources I trust that discuss dogs and diabetes.\n\nManaging Diabetes in Dogs, The Whole Dog Journal\n\nThe Hidden Causes of Pet Diabetes, HealthyPets.Mercola.com\n\nNine Signs Your Pet Could Have Diabetes, HealthyPets.Mercola.com\n\nWhat You Should Know When Your Dog Has Diabetes, Dr. Ron Hines\n\nDiabetes in Dogs, Treatment and Prevention, Holistic Approach, Dr. Peter Dobias\n\nRead More About Dog Health"
