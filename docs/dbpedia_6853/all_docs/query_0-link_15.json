        "text": "Name of person Image Date of death Details Menes c. 3200 BC According to Manetho, the Egyptian pharaoh and unifier of Upper and Lower Egypt was carried off and then killed by a hippopotamus.[2][3] Teti c. 2323 BC According to Manetho, the first king of the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt was mysteriously killed when he was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards. Other sources say he was killed by Userkare, who would then succeed him. His death is the earliest-known assassination, but his odd death is still under speculation.[4][5] Ado or Lot's wife 1900 BC According to the Bible, during the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah God commanded Lot not to look back on the city as he was destroying it. However, Lot's wife disobeyed this order and was turned into a pillar of salt.[6] Eglon of Moab 1334 BC Eglon was the king of Moab for 18 years. When Ehud stabbed him in the stomach, the obese king was unable to defend himself and died.[6] Sisera 1200 or 1235 BC According to Judges 4-5, Sisera, the commander of the Canaanite Army for King Jabin of Hazor, was killed in his sleep when the Kenite woman Jael stabbed him in the temple with a tent peg.[2] Abimelech Ben Gideon 1126 BC The king of Shechem and son of Gideon was killed in the city of Thebez by a woman who threw a millstone on his head which crushed his skull or mortally wounded him.[6] Eli 1070 BC The 98-year-old priest died when he fell back in his chair and snapped his neck.[6] Goliath 1024 BC The 9 feet 9 inches (2.97 m) tall Philistine soldier was slain by David when he threw a rock at his head which cracked Goliath's skull.[6] Uzzah 1000 or 1010 BC Uzzah, son of Abinadab, was escorting the Ark of the Covenant from the land of the Philistines to Jerusalem.

His cousin Joab found him and killed him.[6] Tiberinus Silvius c. 914 BC It is said that the legendary king of Alba Longa drowned while crossing the Albula river, which became known as the Tiber. This is usually known as the earliest case of someone drowning.[8] Terpander 7th century BC The Greek poet and citharode, considered the father of Greek music and lyric poetry, reportedly choked to death on a fig thrown at him during one of his performances.[9] Draco of Athens c. 620 BC The Athenian lawmaker was reportedly smothered to death by gifts of cloaks and hats showered upon him by appreciative citizens at a theatre in Aegina, Greece.[10][11] Charondas c. 612 BC According to Diodorus Siculus, the Greek lawgiver from Sicily issued a law that anyone who brought weapons into the Assembly must be put to death. One day, he arrived at the Assembly seeking help to defeat some brigands in the countryside, but with a knife still attached to his belt. In order to uphold his own law, he committed suicide.[12][13][14] Duke Jing of Jin 581 BC In 581 BC a shaman warned the ruler that he would not live to see the new wheat harvest. The ruler dismissed him and had the shaman murdered. However, when the Duke was about to eat the wheat, he felt the need to visit the bathroom. Upon arriving in the bathroom, the Duke fell through the hole and drowned.[15] Arrhichion of Phigalia 564 BC The Greek pankratiast caused his own death during the Olympic finals. Held by his unidentified opponent in a stranglehold and unable to free himself, Arrhichion kicked his opponent, causing him so much pain from a foot/ankle injury that the opponent made the sign of defeat to the umpires, but at the same time broke Arrhichion's neck. Since the opponent had conceded defeat, Arrhichion was proclaimed the victor posthumously.[16][17] Milo of Croton 6th century BC The Olympic champion wrestler's hands reportedly became trapped when he tried to split a tree apart; he was then devoured by wolves (or, in later versions, lions).[18][19] Zeuxis 5th century BC The Greek painter died of laughter while painting an elderly woman.[20][21] Pythagoras of Samos c. 495 BC Ancient sources disagree on how the Greek philosopher died,[22][23] but one late and probably apocryphal legend reported by both Diogenes Laërtius, a third-century AD biographer of famous philosophers, and Iamblichus, a Neoplatonist philosopher, states that Pythagoras was murdered by his political enemies. Supposedly, he almost managed to outrun them, but he came to a bean field and refused to run through it, as he had prohibited beans as ritually unclean.[23][24] Since cutting through the field would violate his own teachings, Pythagoras simply stopped running and was killed. This story may have been fabricated by Neanthes of Cyzicus, on whom both Diogenes and Iamblichus rely as a source.[23] Anacreon c. 485 BC The poet, known for works in celebration of wine, choked to death on a grape stone according to Pliny the Elder. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica suggests that \"the story has an air of mythical adaptation to the poet's habits\".[20]: 104 [25][26] Heraclitus of Ephesus c. 475 BC According to one account given by Diogenes Laertius, the Greek philosopher was said to have been devoured by dogs after smearing himself with cow manure in an attempt to cure his dropsy.[27][28] Themistocles c. 459 BC The Athenian general who won the Battle of Salamis actually died of natural causes in exile,[29][30] but was widely rumored to have committed suicide by drinking a solution of crushed minerals known as bull's blood.[29][30][31][32] The legend is widely retold in classical sources. The early twentieth-century English classicist Percy Gardner proposed that the story about him drinking bull's blood may have been based on an ignorant misunderstanding of a statue showing Themistocles in a heroic pose, holding a cup as an offering to the gods. The comedic playwright Aristophanes references Themistocles drinking bull's blood in his comedy The Knights (performed in 424 BC) as the most heroic way for a man to die.[30][33] Aeschylus c. 455 BC According to Valerius Maximus, the eldest of the three great Athenian tragedians was killed by a tortoise dropped by an eagle that had mistaken his bald head for a rock suitable for shattering the shell of the reptile. Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History, adds that Aeschylus had been staying outdoors to avert a prophecy that he would be killed that day \"by the fall of a house\".[20]: 104 [34][35][36][37] Empedocles of Akragas c. 430 BC According to Diogenes Laertius, the Pre-Socratic philosopher from Sicily, who, in one of his surviving poems, declared himself to have become a \"divine being... no longer mortal\",[38] tried to prove he was an immortal god by leaping into Mount Etna, an active volcano.[39][40] The Roman poet Horace also alludes to this legend.[41] Sogdianus 423 BC The ruler of the Achaemenid Empire was captured by his half-brother Ochus, who had him executed by being suffocated by ash.[42][43] Polydamas of Skotoussa 5th century BC The Thessalian pankratiast, and victor in the 93rd Olympiad (408 BC), was in a cave with friends when the roof began to crumble down upon them. Believing his immense strength could prevent the cave-in, he held his hands up to the roof, trying to support it as the rocks crashed down around him. This gave enough time for his friends to flee the cave and reach safety, but Polydamas was crushed to death.[44] Sophocles c. 406 BC A number of \"remarkable\" legends concerning the death of another of the three great Athenian tragedians are recorded in the late antique Life of Sophocles. According to one legend, he choked to death on an unripe grape. Another says that he died of joy after hearing that his last play had been successful. A third account reports that he died of suffocation, after reading aloud a lengthy monologue from the end of his play Antigone, without pausing to take a breath for punctuation.[36] Mithridates 401 BC The Persian soldier who embarrassed his king, Artaxerxes II, by boasting of killing his rival, Cyrus the Younger (who was the brother of Artaxerxes II), was executed by scaphism. The king's physician, Ctesias, reported that Mithridates survived the insect torture for 17 days.[45][46] Democritus of Abdera c. 370 BC According to Diogenes Laertius, the Greek Atomist philosopher died aged 109; as he was on his deathbed, his sister was greatly worried because she needed to fulfill her religious obligations to the goddess Artemis in the approaching three-day Thesmophoria festival. Democritus told her to place a loaf of warm bread under his nose and was able to survive for the three days of the festival by sniffing it. He died immediately after the festival was over.[47][48] Diogenes of Sinope c. 323 BC According to 3rd century biographer, Diogenes Laërtius, he died by consuming raw octopus. His contemporaries, however, claimed he died by holding his breath.[49] Anaxarchus 320 BC According to Diogenes Laertius, Anaxarchus gained the enmity of the tyrannical ruler of Cyprus, Nicocreon, for an inappropriate joke he made about tyrants at a banquet in 331 BC. When Anaxarchus visited Cyprus, Nicocreon ordered him to be pounded to death in a mortar. During the torture Anaxarchus said to Nicocreon, \"Just pound the bag of Anaxarchus, you do not pound Anaxarchus.\" Nicocreon then threatened to cut his tongue out; Anaxarchus bit it off and spat it at the ruler's face.[50] Antiphanes c. 310 BC According to the Suda, the renowned comic poet of the Middle Attic comedy died after being struck by a pear.[51][52] King Wu of Qin 307 BC The king and member of the Qin dynasty reportedly challenged his friend Meng Yue to a lifting contest.

Meng Yue and his family were sentenced to death.[53] Agathocles of Syracuse 289 BC The Greek tyrant of Syracuse was murdered with a poisoned toothpick.[20]: 104 [54] Pyrrhus of Epirus 272 BC During the Battle of Argos, Pyrrhus was fighting a Macedonian soldier in the street when the elderly mother of the soldier dropped a roof tile onto Pyrrhus' head, breaking his spine and rendering him paralyzed. According to a soldier named Zopyrus, they then proceeded to decapitate the king.[55] Philitas of Cos c. 270 BC The Greek intellectual is said by Athenaeus to have studied arguments and erroneous word usage so intensely that he wasted away and starved to death.[56] British classicist Alan Cameron speculates that Philitas died from a wasting disease which his contemporaries joked was caused by his pedantry.[57] Zeno of Citium c. 262 BC The Greek philosopher from Citium (Kition), Cyprus, tripped and fell as he was leaving the school, breaking his toe. Striking the ground with his fist, he quoted the line from the Niobe, \"I come, I come, why dost thou call for me?\" He died on the spot through holding his breath. Qin Shi Huang August 210 BC The first emperor of China, whose artifacts and treasures include the Terracotta Army, died after ingesting several pills of mercury, in the belief that it would grant him immortality.[59][60][61] Chrysippus of Soli c. 206 BC One ancient account of the death of the third-century BC Greek Stoic philosopher tells that he died laughing at his own joke[62] after he saw a donkey eating his figs; he told a slave to give the donkey neat wine to drink with which to wash them down, and then, \"...having laughed too much, he died\" (Diogenes Laërtius 7.185).[37][63] Hannibal c. 183-181 BC According to legend, the Carthaginian general mysteriously died from a wounded finger from his sword while mounting his horse. This event is said to have led to a fever in which he died 3 days later. However, some other stories suggest it was poisoning. The actual cause is still unknown.[64][failed verification] Eleazar Avaran c. 163 BC The brother of Judas Maccabeus; according to 1 Maccabees 6:46, during the Battle of Beth Zechariah, Eleazar spied an armored war elephant which he believed to be carrying the Seleucid emperor Antiochus V Eupator. After thrusting his spear in battle into its belly, it collapsed and fell on top of Eleazar, killing him instantly.[65] Manius Aquillius and Marcus Licinius Crassus 1st century BC The late Roman Republic-era consul was sent as ambassador to Asia Minor in 90 BC to restore Nicomedes IV of Bithynia to his kingdom after the latter was expelled by Mithridates VI of Pontus. But Aquillius encouraged Nicomedes to raid part of Mithridates' territory, which started the First Mithridatic War. Aquillius was captured and brought to Mithridates, who in 88 BC had him executed by pouring molten gold down his throat. According to one story, Marcus Licinius Crassus, a Roman general and statesman, who was very greedy despite being called \"the richest man in Rome,\" was executed in the same manner by the Parthians after they defeated him in the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC, in symbolic mockery of his thirst for wealth. However, it has been disputed as to whether this is how Crassus met his end.[66][67] Porcia Catonis June 43 BC to October 42 BC The daughter of Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis and second wife of Marcus Junius Brutus, according to ancient historians such as Cassius Dio and Appian, killed herself by swallowing hot coals.[68] Modern historians find this tale implausible.[69] Tiberius Claudius Drusus c. 20 AD According to Suetonius, the eldest son of the future Roman emperor Claudius died while playing with a pear. Having tossed the pear high in the air, he caught it in his mouth when it came back, but he choked on it, dying of asphyxia.[70][71] Tiberius 16 March 37 The Roman emperor died in Misenum aged 78. According to Tacitus, the emperor appeared to have died and Caligula, who was at Tiberius' villa, was being congratulated on his succession to the empire, when news arrived that the emperor had revived and was recovering his faculties. Those who had moments before recognized Caligula as Augustus fled in fear of the emperor's wrath, while Macro, a prefect of the Praetorian Guard, took advantage of the chaos to have Tiberius smothered with his own bedclothes, definitively killing him.[72] Saint Peter Between 64 and 68 AD The apostle of Jesus was crucified upside-down in Rome, based on his claim of being unworthy to die in the same way as his Saviour.[73][74] Bartholomew the Apostle 69 or 71 AD St. Bartholomew, an apostle of Jesus Christ, died after either being knocked out and thrown into the sea or being skinned alive and beheaded in Armenia.[75] Antipas of Pergamum 68 or 92 AD Antipas was burned alive inside the brazen bull for supposedly casting out demons who were worshipped in Pergamum.[76] Simon the Zealot 1st century AD According to an ancient tradition, the apostle of Jesus was sawn in half in Persia.[77] Saint Lawrence 258 The deacon was roasted alive on a giant grill during the persecution of Valerian.[78][79] Prudentius tells that he joked with his tormentors, \"Turn me over—I'm done on this side\".[80] He is now the patron saint of cooks, chefs, and comedians.[81] Marcus of Arethusa 362 The Christian bishop and martyr was hung up in a honey-smeared basket for bees to sting him to death.[20]: 104 Cassian of Imola 13 August 363 Cassian of Imola was sentenced to death by Julian the Apostate and was handed over to his pupils to carry out the deed, which they did by binding him to a stake and stabbing him with a poisoned stylus.[82] Valentinian I 17 November 375 The Roman emperor suffered a stroke which was provoked by yelling at foreign envoys in anger.[83] Attila c. 453 Attila the Hun reportedly died on his wedding night by choking on his own blood, which flowed into his mouth from a nosebleed.[37][84] Name of person Image Date of death Details Thomas Millwood 3 January 1804 The 32-year-old plasterer was shot and killed by excise officer Francis Smith, who mistook him for the Hammersmith ghost due to his white uniform. Smith was later sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to one year's imprisonment with hard labor, and he received a full pardon later in the year.[175] John Cummings March 1809 After seeing a circus knife-swallower, seaman John Cummings began actually swallowing knives. On one occasion, he swallowed four knives, and quickly passed three with no ill-health. He later swallowed 14 knives, and after some days with abdominal pain, he passed all of them. He finally swallowed 20 knives and a clasp knife case, but after a few days, he had only passed the case; he died after four years in pain. On autopsy, a knife blade and spring were found in his intestines, and between 30 and 40 fragments of metal, wood, and horn in his stomach.[176] Victims of the London Beer Flood 17 October 1814 At Meux & Co's Horse Shoe Brewery, a 22-foot-tall (6.7 m) wooden vat of fermenting porter burst, causing chain reactions and destroying several large beer barrels. The beer subsequently flooded the nearby slum and killed eight people. Several people also subsequently died from alcohol poisoning as a result of vaporized liquor.[177][178][179] William Huskisson 15 September 1830 The 60-year-old British statesman, financer, and MP was crushed to death by the Stephenson's Rocket after a failed attempt to put the locomotive in reverse.[180] William Henry Harrison 4 April 1841 The 9th President of the United States died a month after his inauguration from an illness (possibly pneumonia or enteric fever) that developed after he stood in the rain to deliver his 2-hour-long inaugural address, the longest by any U.S. President.

He repeatedly stated that he was going to die, which Mr. Schardin, the proprietor of a billiard saloon where Yugle was resting, said that it would be impossible for Yugle to do. In response, Yugle made a bet with Schardin, which Schardin accepted, that he would die in 15 minutes. Schardin and others returned to the room 40 minutes later and found Yugle dead.[189] Jim Creighton 18 October 1862 The 21-year-old American baseball player from Manhattan died from abdominal pain, possibly caused by throwing his own ball which likely gave him a ruptured bladder or a ruptured hernia.[190] Julius Peter Garesché 31 December 1862 The Cuban-born professional soldier was killed on the first day of the Battle of Stones River when a cannon ball decapitated him.[191] John Sedgwick 9 May 1864 In the midst of battle, the Union officer said, \"They couldn't hit an elephant at this distance,\" before being shot and killed by a Confederate sniper.[192] Archduchess Mathilda of Austria 6 June 1867 The daughter of Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen set her dress on fire while trying to hide a cigarette from her father, who had forbidden her to smoke.[193][194] Mary Ward 31 August 1869 The Irish scientist, naturalist, microscopist, author, and artist was killed by a carriage built by William Parsons' sons. While riding in the carriage, it hit a bend which caused Ward to fly out of the carriage where she was cut, bruised, and bleeding from her ears.

The heat caused the barrels in the storehouse to explode, sending a stream of whiskey flowing through the doors and windows of the burning building. The burning whiskey then flowed along the streets where it quickly demolished a row of small houses. Despite the damage from the fire, all of the resulting 13 fatalities were caused by alcohol poisoning after drinking the undiluted flooded whiskey.[205][206] Queen Sunanda Kumariratana 31 May 1880 The 19-year-old queen consort of King Rama V of Siam died when her boat flipped over. A large crowd formed but none of them could help because touching the queen was a capital offense.[37][207] Hague and another female servant October 1881 A British servant of one Mr. Birchall was instructed by his master to retrieve a four-chambered pistol.[208] Hague did so, but while examining the gun he shot himself in the jaw which caused instant death.

Cruikshank \"frequently expressed a wish to die\" and ultimately bought the paint at a hardware shop, instead of buying arsenic at a pharmacy, which would have raised questions. The next day, Cruikshank was playing the piano when she fell ill because of the paint. Her last words were reportedly, \"Mama I may as well tell you. I have taken Paris Green. I have done what I said I would do.\"[213][214] Mrs. O'Reilly 30 September 1883 The 36-year-old servant from the West Clive Hotel in New Zealand was found on the side of a road by a boy carrying milk.

The snake had escaped from its inadequate enclosure and moved through ducts that were easily accessible to the reptile, where the snake then fell through the ceiling where the boys slept 3 metres (9.8 ft) away. Though the snake suffocated them, it did not attempt to eat them. However, an African rock python would not constrict unless it planned on eating; therefore, it is likely that the owners of the python also failed to feed their pet. The python was euthanized.[604][605] Roman Pirozek, Jr. 5 September 2013 The 19-year-old model airplane enthusiast was partially decapitated by the blade of his radio-controlled helicopter while performing aerobatic maneuvers in Calvert Vaux Park in Brooklyn, New York.[606][607] Denver Lee St. Clair 21 December 2013 The 58-year-old was asphyxiated by an \"atomic wedgie\" administered by his stepson during a fight in Oklahoma.
