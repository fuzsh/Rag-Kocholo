CDC has also provided technical assistance to laboratories across the country to attain ISO 15189 accreditation for quality diagnostic services.\n\nKey achievements\n\nSupported accreditation of 15 public health laboratories, including the national microbiology reference lab and the national TB reference labs.\n\nOptimized national integrated sample transport systems coverage and access with 720,930 samples transported to 15 viral load testing laboratories from health facilities in 44 districts, providing HIV, TB, and other disease diagnostics services.\n\nSurveillance and health information systems\n\nCDC Zimbabwe supported the MOHCC's strategic information activities. Activities included providing technical leadership and programmatic guidance for:\n\nRoutine program monitoring, implementing, and using case-based and recency surveillance data to inform program planning.\n\nHealth management information system support, including supporting the development and implementation of an electronic health record (EMR) systems and transition of patient registers from paper-based to the electronic health system.\n\nImplementing population based and Biobehavioral Surveys (BBS) to measure progress towards achieving HIV epidemic control and inform HIV program planning.\n\nKey achievements\n\nThrough a partnership with ICAP at Columbia University, CDC conducted the first BBS among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women/gender queer people (TGW/GQ) in 2019.\n\nCDC will conduct another BBS survey among MSM, TGW, and people who inject drugs in 2024.\n\nExpanded use of the EMR system in health facilities in Zimbabwe.\n\nEmergency response\n\nCDC Zimbabwe and partners continue to support the MOHCC to prevent, respond to, and strengthen health systems to address public health threats like COVID-19. Through CARES ACT funding, the U.S. government supported COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) activities. This included harmonization and strengthening of IPC measures in 105 health care facilities to build sustainable health systems and preparedness for any future pandemics.\n\nCDC has also provided technical support for other outbreaks such as cholera, polio, and measles. CDC is currently providing technical assistance to strengthen national capacities on quality monitoring for water, sanitation, and hygiene and cholera preparedness and response."
