        "text": "The most integrated countries in Africa tend to perform well on at least three dimensions of regional integration. The least integrated countries tend to have poor performance on all dimensions.\n\nInterpreting the rankings\n\nSome countries in Africa are members of more than one regional economic community. Because of this, a country may have different scores and rankings for the same dimension. For example, Libya scored 0.462 on trade integration within COMESA, where it ranked ninth out of 21 countries, but it only scored 0.390 within AMU, where it ranked fourth out of 5 countries.\n\nSome differences in scores and rankings can be explained by historical links, comparative advantages, and topography. Regional policies also play a role. If, for example, a country imposes visa restrictions on the countries that are members of the first regional economic community to which it belongs and but not on countries that are members of the second regional economic community to which it belongs, its score on the free movement of people dimension may be lower within the first community than within the second."
