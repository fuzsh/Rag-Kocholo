        "text": "Zimbabwe has been in a state of political, economic, and social crisis for the past 15 years. In 2004, 80% of Zimbabweans were living below the national poverty line. By January 2009, only 6% of the population held jobs in the formal sector. The Zimbabwean currency has been abandoned in favor of the South African rand and U.S. dollar. The country’s agricultural sector has been crippled by uncompensated and unpredictable land takings. Over half the population received food aid in 2009. Fifteen percent of the population between the ages of 15 and 49 is infected with HIV/AIDS and there are over one million AIDS orphans. Life expectancy in Zimbabwe is 43 years.\n\nProgress has been made toward a measure of political stability. Following disputed elections in 2008, Zimbabwe’s political parties, ZANU–PF (Zimbabwe African National Union–Patriotic Front) and both formations of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) signed a power-sharing agreement committing to an inclusive government. In February 2009, the fragile system of joint rule began. Addressing continuing inequities in land distribution and low agricultural productivity are central terms of the power-sharing agreement. The parties agreed that land takings conducted under the country’s Fast Track Program would not be reversed, that compensation for land taken should primarily come from the United Kingdom (Zimbabwe’s prior colonial ruler), and that further redistributive land reforms are necessary.\n\nZimbabwe’s Constitution provides a right to property and prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. The power-sharing agreement specifically notes the need for women’s land rights to be strengthened. The country’s land resettlement program provides that single women should receive 20% of distributed land. However, the Constitution also permits customary law and traditional practice to trump principles of equality between the sexes in matters of personal law. In the face of discriminatory customary laws, Zimbabwean women have no legal basis to assert equal rights to inherit and hold land.\n\nAn estimated 70,000 hectares of forest land is lost every year to agriculture as populations in communal areas clear forest land to grow food and use wood for fuel. Drought occurs every 2 to 3 years, reducing the country’s agricultural productivity, undermining food security, and putting pressure on water resources. In 2007–2008, collapse of water and sanitation infrastructure led to serious cholera outbreaks. The water sector benefited from revision to the legal framework but has been unable to implement the desired decentralization of sector governance effectively.\n\nZimbabwe is rich in mineral resources, but the government’s articulated plan to take control of mining enterprises caused a withdrawal of investment and reduction in sector growth in 2007–2008. The government has withdrawn the plan in favor of a call for revisions to the legal framework to encourage increased investment in the sector.\n\nWhen Zimbabwe claimed its independence in 1980, white farmers in the large-scale commercial farming sector controlled 75% of prime agricultural land, with farm sizes ranging from 500 to 2,000 hectares. The remainder of agricultural land was held either within the communal areas or by small-scale commercial farmers. Communal areas constituted 42% of land and supported 4.3 million people, 72% of the population (Marongwe n.d.).\n\nSince Independence, the government has undertaken a series of land reform projects. The Lancaster House Agreement, which formed the basis for Zimbabwe’s initial Constitution, established the goal of allocating land to the poor and to war veterans, with the objectives of providing for welfare of the neediest people and increasing agricultural productivity. The government agreed to acquire land for redistribution on a willing-seller, willing-buyer basis for the ten-year period of the Lancaster House Agreement, and set a goal of providing land for 168,000 households. Britain agreed to help finance the land purchases by sharing the cost with the Zimbabwean government. However, the cost of land was market-driven, and the best land was high-priced. By 1990, the government had purchased 3.5 million hectares, but only 19% was considered prime agricultural land (ZI 2004; Marongwe n.d.).\n\nThe program also fell short in land distribution and resettlement. When the Lancaster House Agreement expired in 1990, only 52,000 households (less than one-third of the target) had received land. Resettlement plans were dominated by a model based on planned village settlements with full-time farmers engaged in small-holder agriculture. As implemented, the program lacked flexibility, was expensive, and tended to provide land for asset- rich, skilled farmers. Land distribution remained highly skewed; as of 1988, some 4660 commercial farms (the majority owned by white farmers of European descent) held 11.2 million hectares, while over 1 million black families in the communal areas lived on 16.4 million hectares of land (Cousins and Scoones 2009; Subramanian 1998).\n\nPolitical will for large-scale redistributive land reform waned over the decade following Independence as the focus shifted to the potential of commercial agriculture to drive economic growth and as the government recognized that the commercial farmers held much of the technical expertise in the country. Donors complained that land purchased for resettlement was leased to elites or used for state farms. With the expiration of the Lancaster House Agreement and the commitment to land acquisition on a willing seller-willing buyer basis, pressure from the rural population for the government to deliver on its promises of land redistribution grew. The government amended the provisions of the Constitution concerning property rights and adopted the 1992 Land Acquisition Act, which permitted compulsory acquisition of land for redistribution with “fair compensation” provided to the landowner. “Fair compensation” was determined by an established formula, with a right of appeal to the court. However, little land was purchased because the government lacked the funds to pay for the acquired farms. Donors showed interest but voiced concern about irregularities in land allocations. Donor funds were conditioned on demonstration of a transparent process of land acquisition, land allocation, and resettlement (Cousins and Scoones 2009; HRW 2002; Masiiwa 2004; ZI 2004).\n\nZimbabwe entered a period of political turmoil in the late 1990s. The government’s effort to adopt a new constitution allowing for compulsory acquisition of land without compensation and curtailing rights was defeated. The then-nascent opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), received significant support in the 2000 elections. In response to the political threat, the ZANU–PF government revitalized land reform by adopting a Fast Track Program for land acquisition and distribution. The program set a goal of acquiring 5 million hectares of land for resettlement. Groups of war veterans, thugs, and unemployed and landless youth, which had been invading commercial farms on an isolated basis for several years, increased in numbers and invaded hundreds of farms. In many cases, the invaders destroyed property and used physical violence against farm workers. Some of the invasions were spontaneous local actions, while others were orchestrated by the government. The amount of land invaded and seized quickly exceeded the goal of the Fast Track Program. In 2000, over 1600 mostly white-owned commercial farms were occupied, and by 2003 the government had acquired over 10 million hectares of land. By 2009, 6571 farms had been identified by the government for seizure. As of 2009, only 400 white-owned commercial farms remained in Zimbabwe (Cousins and Scoones 2009; HRW 2002; ZimOnline 2009; Masiiwa 2004; ZI 2004).\n\nEfforts to challenge the new laws, policies, and land invasions in the courts have been almost wholly unsuccessful. Zimbabwe’s court system, which initially struck down many of the government’s legal maneuvers as invalid, has since been stripped of its independence. The government has continued to seize land. As of November 2009, 152 of the remaining 400 white commercial farmers faced prosecution. In a landmark ruling in 2008, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) tribunal held that the Zimbabwean government’s efforts to seize 78 white-owned farms was discriminatory and violated principles of the SADC treaty. The ruling did not change the government’s approach to or position on land reforms (HRW 2002; Reynolds and Flores 2009; Saller 2004; ZimOnline 2008; New Zimbabwe 2008).\n\nThe procedures for distribution of seized farmland under the Fast Track Program have been criticized as failing to meet the objectives of providing land and livelihoods for the poor. In many areas, the government militia and war veterans responsible for violent seizure of farms and eviction of farm workers were responsible for allocating land. Displaced and unemployed farm workers were ineligible for land allocations. Allegiance to the government was a primary criterion for land allocations. One study found that only about half of the beneficiaries of land allocations were the landless poor; the other half were mostly employed business people and civil servants (Marongwe n.d.).\n\nLEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nZimbabwe’s legislation regarding land rights includes: the Constitution of Zimbabwe, 1979 (as amended); Communal Land Act 20 of 1982, which vests ownership of communal lands in the state; Land Acquisition Act of 1992, which allows land to be expropriated by the state for redistribution; Agricultural Land Settlement Act; Agricultural Corporations (Commercialization) Act 13 of 1997; Regional Town and Country Planning Act; Land Survey Act; Deeds Registry Act; Commercial Premises (lease control) Act 27 of 1983; Protected Places and Areas Act 27 of 1959; and Immovable Property (prevention of discrimination) Act 19 of 1982 (Reynolds and Flores 2009; Saller 2004).\n\nAlthough the formal legal system continues to function in Zimbabwe, its legitimacy has been challenged internally and externally. The government operates under a series of laws, orders, and emergency presidential decrees of often dubious legal authority, as recognized by the 2008 SADC ruling against the government and in favor of commercial farmer rights. A 2007 assessment by an international team of legal professionals found that the rule of law was eroding in the country and Zimbabwe’s judiciary and its rulings were often ignored by the police and government officials (Reynolds and Flores 2009; Saller 2004; IBA 2007; HRW 2002).\n\nTENURE TYPES\n\nTenure types include: (1) freehold ownerships; (2) occupancy rights to land in communal areas; and (3) leases of land granted by the government through various redistribution schemes. Leases are generally granted for periods of 99 years (Shumba 2001a).\n\nResettlement land is classified as A1 or A2 land. Land classified as A1 is allocated in villages and in small, self-contained parcels up to 5 hectares. A1 land is allocated to small farmers and is inheritable, but cannot be sold. Land classified as A2 is intended for commercial farming. The government allocates A2 land in parcels of 2 to 2000 hectares to individuals who can demonstrate that they have the experience and access to resources necessary to farm successfully (Masiiwa 2004; Chimhowu and Woodhouse 2008).\n\nThe nationalization of all agricultural land created confusion as to the transferability of land. In some cases, those holding ownership rights to land at the time of nationalization continued to operate as landowners, including selling land. In other cases, the state has exercised its status as the landowner, precluding sales. There is an active informal market in land in some rural areas (Magaramombe 2007; Masiiwa 2004; Chimhowu and Woodhouse 2008).\n\nSECURING LAND RIGHTS\n\nLand within communal areas is vested in the President, and the Rural District Councils (RDCs) allocate land for occupancy and use. In allocating the land, the RDCs must consult and cooperate with the chief appointed to preside over the community (Sithole 2002).\n\nLand occupied through redistribution schemes is typically leased to beneficiaries for 99-year terms with or without the option to purchase the land. Lessees are usually prohibited from transferring their rights without the permission of the relevant minister. Individuals can also acquire land by prescription if a person has openly possessed the land as if he or she were the owner for an uninterrupted 30-year period (Sithole 2002).\n\nLand rights in Zimbabwe are highly insecure. Remaining commercial large-scale farmers fear sudden occupation and eviction. Because the resettlement is being conducted so quickly and often outside the bounds of the legal process, those who have acquired land under the Fast Track Program also lack security; many resettled persons worry about the legitimacy of their land rights, and conflicts among resettled groups occur in some areas (HRW 2002; IRIN 2009).\n\nIn addition to insecurity in the rural sector, Zimbabwe has no legislative framework providing for the regularization of informal settlements in urban and peri-urban areas. In 2005, the government initiated a series of housing demolitions in urban and peri-urban areas (“Operation Murambatsvina”). The demolitions have adversely affected 2.4 million people, displacing 700,000 people and increasing the sense of insecurity in the country’s urban areas (Chimhowu and Woodhouse 2008; IBA 2007; HRW 2005).\n\nINTRA-HOUSEHOLD RIGHTS TO LAND AND GENDER DIFFERENCES\n\nWomen are legally able to purchase and hold land in Zimbabwe. The power-sharing agreement specifically recognizes the need for women’s access to and control over land. In reality most women do not have the resources to purchase land. Women can apply for land in resettlement areas; however, customary practices tend to discourage women from applying for land in their own name. Despite a 20% quota for land to be allocated to single women, applications for land in resettlement areas and the permits issued tend to be in the name of the male head of household (Sithole 2002; COHRE 2004; GOZ 2008).\n\nDespite its pronouncements against gender discrimination, Zimbabwe’s Constitution permits discrimination against women in land matters by deferring to customary law in matters related to adoption, marriage, divorce, and inheritance. Common law reflects the constitutional deference: the court case of Magaya v. Magaya held that a daughter could not inherit her father’s property because she was a “lady,” even though her father named her as his heir. The court awarded her father’s estate to her half-brother (COHRE 2004).\n\nLegal marriages can be either civil or customary, as governed by the Marriage Act and the Customary Marriage Act, respectively. Under the latter, polygamous marriage is permitted. Unregistered customary marriage is not recognized by formal law: women married under customary law cannot own property jointly with their husbands; when a husband dies, land customarily passes to his sons, rather than to his spouse or daughters. Legal provision is made for spousal support according to a plan drawn up by the magistrate. Under the civil marriage regime, married couples can only hold property as “community property” if they signed and registered a written agreement to that effect prior to marriage. A woman married under the civil system after 1997 has the right to inherit the matrimonial home and a portion of her late husband’s estate (COHRE 2004).\n\nThe Matrimonial Causes Act gives divorced women the right to maintenance for themselves and their children. The Deceased Persons Family Maintenance Act provides maintenance for those dependent on the deceased, such as widows and children (COHRE 2004).\n\nDespite legislation providing protection for spousal interests, women face obstacles to asserting such rights due to lack of resources to bring cases to courts, fear of going against customary practice, and social pressure (COHRE 2004).\n\nLAND ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS\n\nThe National Land Identification Committee coordinates the Land Reform and Resettlement Program. Four ministries are officially involved with the Program: the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, and Rural Resettlement; the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing; the Ministry of Rural Resources and Water Development; and the Ministry of Environment and Tourism. In practice, the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing is the primary ministry operating the program. Provincial Land Identification Committees work with District Land Identification Committees, which have members from rural district councils, traditional leaders, and the War Veterans Association. Farm owners can appeal to the Provincial Land Identification Committees if they disagree with the selection of their farm for redistribution. Appeals are generally denied (HRW 2002; Marongwe n.d.).\n\nAdministration of Zimbabwe’s land lacks transparency, clear assignment of authority, and capacity. Many land administration agencies have been created and changed at the whim of the government; civil society groups and members of the former opposition government have unsuccessfully challenged the authority of the land agencies (Saller 2004; Jacobs and Chavunduka 2003).\n\nThe Communal Land Act of 1982 removed the authority to manage and allocate land from customary institutions and vested authority in elected local government institutions. The government often suggested that the customary institutions collaborated with the former white minority government in order to undermine their authority and ensure the power transferred to the local government. Traditional practices of land administration often continued under the elected local government institutions (Subramanian 1998; Dore 2001).\n\nThe Traditional Leaders Act of 1999 formally restored the local land administration role of the chiefs, although the Rural District Council (RDC) continues to play an oversight function. Chiefs use village heads, or masabukhu (singular sabukhu) to maintain the local tax registers. Each village or kraal (20–25 households) is governed in land matters by a head or sabukhu reporting to the chief, who in turn is answerable to the RDC (Marongwe 2003).\n\nLAND MARKETS AND INVESTMENTS\n\nZimbabwe does not have a formal land-sale market for agricultural land. Zimbabwe’s commercial farmland is leased for 99-year periods, and transfer of leases requires government approval. Land in communal areas (66% of agricultural land) cannot be legally sold. However, because of the high demand for land, holdings in communal areas and A1 resettlement land (small farms and village land) are often transferred extra-legally. In some communal areas, traditional authorities sell parcels of grazing land to newcomers for residential and farming purposes, a practice that increases the tax revenue collected by the authorities. There is also a strong market in sales and rentals of houses in rural areas. Residents leaving the area or those who obtained land in the resettlement program often rent their houses to urban residents migrating to rural areas after the loss of their housing, and to former farm workers who lost their houses in farm invasions (Chimhowu and Woodhouse 2008; Chimhowu and Woodhouse 2010).\n\nUnder the land reform program, the government has acquired large tracts of land for resettlement in urban and peri-urban areas. In some cases the government seized productive farmland that served the nearby urban residents. Residential settlements have sprung up, but in most cases the settlements lack planning and have no services. The selection of beneficiaries for the new developments has not been transparent or in accordance with legitimate procedures. The formal law prohibits the transfer of the plots, but an active informal market exists in some areas (Marongwe 2003; Chimhowu and Woodhouse 2010).\n\nMost urban land in Zimbabwe continues to be privately owned and, in comparison to rural land, is considered relatively secure. Unchecked inflation and the rapid devaluation of the country’s currency caused those with the resources to do so to invest in urban real estate, causing a real estate boom (Dzirutwe 2006).\n\nIn the capital, Harare, registration of a land transaction requires four steps and roughly 30 days. Fees for the registration are assessed at 10% of the property value (World Bank 2008).\n\nCOMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS BY GOVERNMENT\n\nThe largest compulsory acquisition issues in Zimbabwe relate to land takings for resettlement. After the expiration of the Lancaster House Agreement in 1990, legislation permitted land takings for resettlement with payment of “fair compensation.” Land for acquisition and resettlement under the Fast Track Program is technically limited to unutilized or underutilized land, land owned by a farmer who has other farms, foreign-owned land, and land contiguous to Communal Areas. In practice, the political affiliation of landowners influenced the initial identification of land for acquisition. As time passed and efforts to require the takings to comply with legal requirements failed, all but a handful of commercial farms became targets for acquisition. The government has provided compensation for 203 of the 6571 farms acquired since Independence (Reynolds and Flores 2009; HRW 2002; ZimOnline 2009).\n\nThe Land Acquisition Act, amended in 2000, streamlined the government’s ability to acquire agricultural land for resettlement. The Act no longer requires the acquiring authority to prove that the land acquired is suitable for agricultural purposes, and the government can take possession of the land immediately on serving notice to the landowner. The government is not required to pay for the land itself, but is required to pay for improvements within 5 years of the taking (Masiiwa 2004; Marongwe 2003).\n\nThe Rural Occupiers (Protection from Eviction) Act, 2001, prevents the eviction of people who have invaded a particular farm until the issue is determined in an Administrative Court. Those who invaded and occupied farms— regardless of their economic status—have been among the first to be allocated land under the Fast Track Program (Masiiwa 2004; Marongwe 2003).\n\nLAND DISPUTES AND CONFLICTS\n\nInequitable land distribution has been at the heart of historic grievances within Zimbabwe. The Fast Track Program introduced new insecurities and created new conflicts. Occupations of white-owned commercial farms were often accomplished through destruction of property, violence against landowners, and brutal attacks on thousands of black farm workers. Settlements of small farmers formerly living within communal areas (under the A1 scheme) have been plagued with conflicts over farm boundaries, access roads, use of farm infrastructure, grazing rights, woodlots, and irrigation. Within settlements of commercial farms (under the A2 scheme), conflicts have arisen over how to divide the large-scale infrastructure designed for very large farming operations for use by the many farmers (Magaramombe 2007).\n\nThe country’s 20 magistrate courts are the courts of first instance for land disputes. A parallel system of courts (1100 village courts and 50 community courts) applies customary law. Jurisdiction is limited to civil and small criminal matters. The magistrate courts hear disputes related to land if the value of the land is very low. Otherwise, the Administrative Court or the High Court has jurisdiction over land disputes. The Administrative Court has jurisdiction over matters related to land acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act. The High Court has jurisdiction over issues related to derelict land under the Titles and Registration Act and also deals with disputes over land ownership such as sale, lease, inheritance, and divorce disputes (Reynolds and Flores 2009; Sithole 2002; Saller 2004).\n\nKEY LAND ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS\n\nUnder the power-sharing agreement, ZANU–PF and the two formations of MDC acknowledge the importance of addressing historical imbalances in land ownership and agree on the irreversibility of land takings that have occurred since 2000. The parties have agreed to: (1) conduct a land audit; (2) ensure that land is fairly allotted regardless of political affiliation, race, or gender; (3) ensure tenure security for all holders; (4) call on the Government of the United Kingdom to pay compensation for land acquired for resettlement; (5) secure international support and finance for the land reform both in terms of compensation for displaced farmers and support for new farmers; and (6) restore the full productivity of all agricultural land (GOZ 2008).\n\nZimbabwe’s Agricultural Policy Framework (1995–2020) set the country’s long-term policy objectives for the agricultural sector. Agricultural development is based on the following principles: (1) land and agrarian reforms will be pursued to ensure productive use of land; (2) institutional development will focus on efficient delivery of services to farmers; and (3) development of a public sector investment program to support agricultural development (FAO 2008; Gumbo 2006).\n\nThe Government of Zimbabwe launched a multi-sector framework, the National Economic Recovery Programme (NERP), in 2003. In the agricultural sector, NERP focuses on the need to provide land tenure security, promote effective land utilization, review minimum farm sizes, provide farm input support, establish producer pricing policies; encourage contract farming; promote dairy farming and livestock development; establish farmer associations; promote irrigation development; establish a land bank; improve marketing of agricultural commodities internally and externally; and assure food security through productivity growth (FAO 2008).\n\nThe success of Zimbabwe’s efforts to implement its land and agricultural policies and restart the rural economy depend in part on its ability to attract new foreign assistance. As of January 2010, the country had US$ 6 billion in international debt and was engaged in parliamentary debate over whether to seek debt relief through the IMF/World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative. Two of the criteria that the HIPC Initiative requires from countries applying for debt relief are the establishment a track record of reform through World Bank and IMF programs and the development of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) through a broad-based participatory process. As of February 1, 2010, Zimbabwe was not among those countries listed with the IMF as interested in receiving HIPC Initiative assistance (IMF 2010).\n\nDONOR INTERVENTIONS\n\nIn FY 2010, USAID’s programming responded to the challenges and opportunities facing the new inclusive government and included significant programming strengthening the judiciary and government and focused on reviving the agricultural sector. If the government meets certain benchmarks, USAID will support institutional reforms aimed at promoting judicial independence and neutrality. USAID will also support programs to promote good governance, accountability, and consensus-building activities, including support for development of a new constitution, development of local government capacity, and the engagement of civil society in national dialogue. In the area of economic growth, USAID will promote private sector development and agricultural recovery, including policy reform to generate investor-friendly conditions and to address agricultural land tenure. USAID will expand agricultural livelihood programs to increase household food security, mobilize financing for rural households to purchase agricultural inputs, help rebuild extension services, develop a farmer union, support contract farming and outgrower schemes that deliver inputs to small-scale farmers and guarantee ready markets for produce, and strengthen farmer, commodity and agribusiness associations to enhance advocacy, research, analytical, and arbitration skills (USDS 2010).\n\nIn the past, USAID has provided wide-ranging support to Zimbabwe, including programs in agriculture, drip irrigation to smallholders, housing, drought-relief, and environmental programs. Fifteen percent of the population aged 15 to 49 is infected with HIV and AIDS, and there are over 1 million AIDS orphans. Life expectancy in Zimbabwe is 43 years. USAID has funded HIV/AIDS programs as part of its core activities in Zimbabwe and included attention in its other programming to the population infected by or vulnerable to HIV/AIDS (USAID/Zimbabwe n.d.; PEPFAR 2008; IRIN 2009).\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been actively engaged in Zimbabwe’s agricultural sector throughout the crisis. Current projects include assisting smallholder farmers with inputs, and providing technical assistance and funding for livestock and vegetable-growing projects. The FAO is a member of the group of donors providing substantial support for the country’s irrigation and water sector (FAO 2005; FAO 2008).\n\nIn 2009, the World Bank provided a US$ 7 million grant for the Zimbabwe Emergency Agricultural Inputs Project (ZEAIP) in response to the food crisis in Zimbabwe. The grant was designed to finance the purchase and distribution of maize seed to approximately 300,000 smallholder farmers (World Bank 2009b)."
