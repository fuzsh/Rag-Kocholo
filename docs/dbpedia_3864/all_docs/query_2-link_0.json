Zimbabwe currently has ten provinces, two of which are cities with provincial status. Zimbabwe is a unitary state, and its provinces exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. Provinces are divided into districts, which are divided into wards.\n\nThe Constitution of Zimbabwe delineates provincial governance and powers. After constitutional amendments in 1988, provinces were administered by a governor directly appointed by the President of Zimbabwe.[1] Since the 2013 constitutional changes, there are technically no longer provincial governors, though in practice they remain in place as Ministers of State for Provincial Affairs. The 2013 Constitution also calls for the devolution of governmental powers and responsibilities where appropriate, though Zimbabwean opposition parties argue that the central government has yet to comply.[2]\n\nWith the establishment of Company rule in Rhodesia in the 1890s, the country was divided into two provinces: Matabeleland in the west and Mashonaland in the east. Under British colonial rule as Southern Rhodesia, the colony was divided into five provinces. Later, the Rhodesian government expanded the number of provinces to seven: Manicaland, Matabeleland North and South, Mashonaland North and South, Midlands, and Victoria (today Masvingo).[3] In the 1980s, Mashonaland North and South were reorganized to become three provinces (Mashonaland Central, East and West). The youngest provinces, Bulawayo and Harare, were created in 1997.\n\nName Towns and cities Established Population (2022)[4] Total area[5] Location Capital Largest km2 mi2 Bulawayo Bulawayo 1997 665,952 900 347 Harare Harare 1997 2,427,231 872 337 Manicaland Mutare 1897[6] 2,037,703 36,459 14,077 Mashonaland Central Bindura 1983 1,384,891 28,347 10,945 Mashonaland East Marondera ? 1,731,173 32,230 12,440 Mashonaland West Chinhoyi Kadoma 1983 1,893,584 57,441 22,178 Masvingo Masvingo ? 1,638,528 56,566 21,840 Matabeleland North Lupane Victoria Falls 1973 827,645 75,025 28,967 Matabeleland South Gwanda Beitbridge 1973 760,345 54,172 20,916 Midlands Gweru ? 1,811,905 49,166 18,983\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nDistricts of Zimbabwe\n\nMunicipalities of Zimbabwe\n\nList of provincial governors of Zimbabwe\n\nList of Zimbabwean provinces by population\n\nList of Zimbabwean provinces by Human Development Index\n\nList of Zimbabwean presidential election results by province\n\nISO 3166-2:ZW\n\nMap of Provinces of Zimbabwe - Statoids.org\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
