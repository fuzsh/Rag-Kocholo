        "text": "\"God willing, the end of America is imminent. Its end is not dependent on my survival. Even if Osama is killed or survives, the awakening has started, praise be to God. This was the point of the September 11, 2001 operation\" (Statement by Osama Bin Laden, 27 December 2001). Osama bin Laden transported the transnational jihadist movement into a new era on 11 September, 2001. With the 9/11 attacks, Al Qaeda peaked as a vanguard seeking to lead the transnational jihadist movement. The primary role of Al Qaeda after 9/11 was in sustaining the transnational jihadist movement with its ideology and operational methodology. Al Qaeda nevertheless continued to carry out major attacks in the wake of 9/11, including the Ghriba Synagogue bombing in April 2002, the October 2002 bombing of the French tanker Limburg and the November 2002 Mombasa bombings.\n\nAfter the horrific events of 9/11, no one thought the battle between the West and radical Islamic extremists was going to be fought like a traditional war, but to the extent that we could do so, we did. We tightened our borders, hardened the targets, took off our shoes in airports and sent troops and tanks and drones and special forces to battle foes in Afghanistan and to take out bin Laden in Pakistan. We adapted our laws and intelligence services to make it easier to monitor terrorist cell, sniffing their emails, phone calls and web traffic. And in some cases, this battle against groups that have sponsored terror attacks in the past has succeeded. —Time Life – Inside the Criminal Mind\n\nNo major Al Qaeda attack has taken place since the 2 May 2011 killing of Osama Bin Laden. The organisation has lost quite a few important leaders. Its operations are said to be in shambles. It is merely attempting to survive rather than expand or even plan an attack. While the Arab spring is said to have depleted the Al Qaeda of its popular appeal, the difficult fiscal situation in the United States could be directing the Obama administration’s public posturing of the outfit’s reduced threat potential. While 11 September is a time for an introspection of a decade-long counter terrorism policy aimed at decimating and defeating the Al Qaeda, a trend analysis of the threat from Al Qaeda post-Abbotabad might have important pointers that speak otherwise.\n\nAl-Qaeda is conventionally portrayed as a monolithic, hierarchical organization whose activities -- coordinated by the network’s leader Osama bin Laden -- are the source of international terrorism today. Al-Qaeda is considered a radical tendency within the broader Islamist Salafi movement, legitimizing its terrorist operations as a global Islamist jihad against Western civilization. Al-Qaeda’s terrorist activity today is considered “blowback” from long finished CIA and western covert operations in Afghanistan. The conventional wisdom is demonstrably false. After the Cold War, Western connections with al-Qaeda proliferated around the world, challenging mainstream conceptions of al-Qaeda’s identity. Western covert operations and military-intelligence connections in strategic regions show that “al-Qaeda” is a network whose raison d’etre and modus operandi are inextricably embedded in a disturbing conglomerate of international Western diplomatic, financial, military and intelligence policies today. US, British and Western power routinely manipulates al-Qaeda through a complex network of state-regional and human nodes. Such manipulation extended directly to the 9-11 hijackers, and thus to the events of 9-11 itself\n\nFrom a symbolic point of view, the killing of Al-Zawahiri is clearly a major blow to Al-Qaeda. For the United States, it represents an important success and effectively closes the circle regarding the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Operationally, this targeted killing shows that Washington maintains unmatched capabilities to carry out such operations even in Afghanistan, in which the US has little direct presence these days. From an operational standpoint, however, the death of Al-Zawahiri is unlikely to change much, at least in the short-term. Over the past two decades, Al-Qaeda turned into a deeply decentralised organisation – a horizontal movement more than a hierarchical, vertical organisation in which the central leadership would dictate the agenda, strategies and main goals to local groups."
