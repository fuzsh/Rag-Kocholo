I was hoping that this part of the panel would go quickly, because I had a job interview later in the afternoon. I delivered a paper that stayed just within my allotted time. When I was done speaking, I breathed a sigh of relief. But this moment of triumph proved to be short lived. I saw that one of the chief experts on Middle East politics, Greg Gause, was in the room. I had read his work extensively in graduate school, and my paper was, in fact, a response to his seminal text, Oil Monarchies. I had just argued that although oil was critical to the history and the politics of the Arab Gulf states, as Gause contends, there were other significant factors in their development, including satellite broadcasting, television, and other modern technologies—not to mention the lack of educational and job opportunities for Gulf men and the growing power of women and non-Muslims. I had also argued that scholars would increasingly look at the Gulf states in much the same way that they now look at Mexico, where oil revenues are an important aspect of government budgets but do not exclusively determine national politics. Since my arguments had little in common with Gause’s, my apprehension turned to dread when I saw him raise his hand. He asked the whole panel to explain exactly who we were each challenging in our presentations. Fortunately, I was not required to go first, so I had a moment to think through what I would say. I did not want to avoid the question, but I was reluctant to say to Gause’s face that I was challenging his ideas. When my time came, however, I decided to take a chance. “You!” I said. I realized I was on safe ground when he smiled and appeared pleased by my answer. vii\n\n01.Foley.FM.qxd:Layout 1\n\nviii\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:28 PM\n\nPage viii\n\nPreface\n\nThe Arab Gulf States: Beyond Oil and Islam is a product of the conversations with Greg Gause that began that day and that have continued ever since, not only with him but with a host of other scholars, colleagues, and friends. I hope I have presented my arguments with sufficient depth and cogency so that one day, if I am impelled to ask who a young scholar is challenging, the answer will once again be “you.” * * * Foremost among the scholars, colleagues, and friends alluded to above is John Voll, who was an early proponent of this book and remains one of my most valued advisers. Another early proponent of the book was Jon Alterman, who critiqued my initial proposal for Lynne Rienner Publishers. In addition, I thank Charles Kestenbaum, whom I met in Abu Dhabi in 1996, at which time he helped to spark my interest in Gulf politics. I cannot thank him enough for sharing with me his insights and considerable expertise about the Middle East, the Gulf, and the United Arab Emirates in particular. There are also four other scholars to whom I owe an enormous debt. For teaching me about global oil markets, strategic and military power, and the challenges facing oil-exporting nations, I thank Anthony Cordesman, Mamoun Fandy, David Painter, and Tarik Yousef. Paul du Quneoy, Bert Kirby, York Norman, Dan Stigall, Stefan Talke, and Rick Unikel are invaluable friends whose guidance, humor, and companionship helped me through the various trials of writing this book. I particularly thank Paul for reading the final draft of the manuscript and for providing me with much useful feedback. I also thank Lior Strahilevitz for friendship and keen insight into First Amendment issues. Special thanks also go to John Calabrese, Patrick McGreevy, and Barry Rubin for their ongoing support of my scholarship. Since coming to Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) in 2006, I have benefited from the friendship, guidance, and support of many faculty members and administrators: Amy Sayward, my department chair; Louie Haas, Ken Scherzer, and my other colleagues in the History Department; Muhammad al-Bakry in the English Department; Samantha Cantrell in the grants development office; Allen Hibbard, the director of the Middle East Studies Center; and John McDaniel, the dean of the College of Liberal Arts. There were also many other knowledgeable individuals who assisted me: Juan Cole, John Cuddeback, Christopher Davidson, John Esposito, Greg Gause, Fred Lawson, Matteo Legrenzi, Mike Mehlman, Caffey Norman, James Onley, and Hugh Wilford. I also acknowledge the valuable contributions of Ambassador Nonoo and her staff at the Bahraini Embassy in Washington.\n\n01.Foley.FM.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:28 PM\n\nPage ix\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nMarilyn Grobschmidt deserves special recognition for first contacting me and for then shepherding me through the process of securing a contract with Lynne Rienner Publishers. Through the magic of Skype, Paul Weisser, my manuscript editor, provided a valuable sounding board for my ideas and writing style from 2,000 miles away. This book would not have been possible without the generous financial support of the Smith Richardson Foundation, which provided me a junior faculty research grant in 2006. That grant supplied funds for me to acquire scholarly materials, take research trips to libraries outside of Tennessee, and pay for substantial course release time in 2007 and 2008. My chief contact at the foundation, Scott Boston, was always a pleasure to work with. An MTSU Faculty Research Creative Projects Committee grant in 2008 also aided my research. I greatly benefited from working with archivists and other librarians in a host of institutions. I especially thank Scott S. Taylor and his colleagues in Georgetown University Library’s Special Collections, who readily met my needs as a researcher and provided expert guidance through their archival materials. Their help was very much appreciated. I also benefited from two of the finest libraries of Middle East studies in the United States: the Middle East Institute’s George Camp Keiser Library and the Middle East and Africa Reading Room at the Library of Congress. I would like to especially acknowledge the assistance of Simon Braune of the Middle East Institute, who provided a great environment for conducting research and went out of his way to make me feel at home. In addition, I thank the library staff of the University of California at Berkeley, the Truman Presidential Library, and MTSU’s interlibrary loan office at the James E. Walker Library. I am grateful for the friendship of Jol Silversmith, Elizabeth Kimmons, and Anny Kimmons. Their extra bed was always available during my frequent research trips to Washington, and I appreciated their humor and good advice whenever I was in the nation’s capital. D¯omo arigat¯o! I am equally grateful for the help of my parents, Jack and Adelle Foley. Their support and guidance have been instrumental to the completion of this book and to my success throughout every stage of my life. I hope that this “grandbook” brings them much joy and happiness. My final acknowledgments go to two people who are closely connected to this book and deserve extraordinary recognition: Charles Featherstone and my wife, Kerry Foley. Charles and I began discussing many of the book’s core issues in the late 1990s, when we first met in graduate school at Georgetown University. Over numerous conversations during the years since then, he has freely shared with me his own views and experiences in the Gulf, reminded me of the benefits of taking a contrarian approach, and helped to convince me that my ideas about the Gulf are viable.\n\n01.Foley.FM.qxd:Layout 1\n\nx\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:28 PM\n\nPage x\n\nPreface\n\nI started this project shortly after marrying Kerry, and I cannot thank her enough for her help with every aspect of the book and her willingness to travel with me to Tennessee. Nor can I imagine anyone doing a better job at keeping me happy and focused on finishing the book. It is to Kerry Foley that this book is dedicated. —Sean Foley\n\n02.Foley.ch1.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:12 PM\n\nPage 1\n\n1 Introduction\n\nMy father rode a camel. I ride a Cadillac.

But my great-grandson . . . will be a camel driver. —Arab Gulf saying, 1980 I’m from Najran city [in Saudi Arabia], and there are still some houses [that] my father tells me belonged to the Jews who used to live in Najran.

One day I was invited to visit the home of Shaikh Nazim al-Qubrusi, the most important contemporary figure in Shaikh Khalid’s Sufi order, the Naqshbandiyya. When I arrived at the home, I was introduced to the shaikh, who asked me in Arabic about my work on Shaikh Khalid. After we spoke for a few minutes, Nazim switched to English, explaining that it was the only language that everyone present could understand, since some of his followers were Asian Muslims or Western converts to Islam. As Nazim spoke, I noticed that one of his followers was videotaping my conversation with him—to be posted, as I later learned, on YouTube and on his website.1 After my conversation with Nazim, I was besieged by several men who attempted to sit next to me, touch my back or arms, or even put their arms around my shoulders. At first, I assumed that the men were enthusiastic fol-\n\n1\n\n02.Foley.ch1.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:12 PM\n\nPage 2\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\nlowers of Nazim who were displaying Arab social norms, since in Arab societies, from Morocco to Kuwait, heterosexual men engage in far more direct physical interaction than their US counterparts. But when one of the men asked if Nazim had touched my backpack, I understood what was happening: the men believed that Shaikh Nazim—like Shaikh Khalid before him—was a Muslim saint who could confer baraka, or blessings from God, onto anyone who interacted with him. By touching me or anything else that had made contact with Nazim, including my bag, they believed that they could benefit from the baraka that God conferred to humanity through Nazim.2 Shortly after my encounter with Shaikh Nazim and his followers, I, too, was seemingly touched by Nazim’s baraka. It happened at a newsstand in London’s Heathrow International Airport. I would normally have gone straight for the Economist and the Financial Times, but another magazine caught my attention, the National Geographic. The cover was of a senior Saudi prince performing his kingdom’s national dance, the ardha sword dance, to conclude a camel festival. Its caption read “Kingdom on Edge: Saudi Arabia.” Even though I had lived close to the magazine’s offices in Washington, DC, when I was in graduate school, I had not read or even looked at National Geographic since I was in fifth grade. Had I not stopped at the newsstand at Heathrow, it is unlikely that I would have ever seen that particular issue.3 But the magazine caught my attention and held it. The cover highlighted Frank Viviano’s article on Saudi Arabia and discussed his recent trip there; it included interviews and photographs of both Saudis and non-Saudis from all walks of life. Men, women (both veiled and unveiled), young, old, commoners, and members of the royal family appeared in rural, urban, public, and intimate settings. There were pictures of things anyone would expect to see: oil fields, deserts, enormous mosques, and palaces. But there were also pictures of things few would expect to see: a family watching Fox News, the crowded and dilapidated homes of foreign laborers, female university students, and a man sporting a colorful Che Guevara T-shirt and jeans rather than the dishdasha, the white full-length garment traditionally worn by Saudi men. As I returned to the article again and again over the following weeks, I was struck by the contrast between the diverse modern society that appeared in Viviano’s photographs and the conservative Arab Muslim society that I had found in my reading on Saudi Arabia and its neighbors in my classes at Berkeley and Georgetown. An especially surprising example of Saudi diversity was the name of the family watching Fox News—Naqshbandi—because Shaikh Nazim and the Naqshbandiyya advocate a vision of Islam that is hostile to Wahhabism, Saudi Arabia’s state-sanctioned interpretation of Islam. Indeed, adherents to the Naqshbandiyya have reportedly been persecuted in the kingdom,4 yet the Naqshbandis were presented as a typical Saudi family. They lived in Jeddah, which resembles cities in other parts of the world, with their countless automobiles and traffic congestion, office buildings, mass-produced\n\n02.Foley.ch1.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:12 PM\n\nPage 3\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nconsumer goods, and low-rise suburban houses. One nighttime picture of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, could easily have been mistaken for Phoenix or Las Vegas. Equally striking to me was how much Viviano’s portrayal of traditional modes of authority undermined the current chief intellectual tool for understanding Gulf states, the rentier model. The rentier model emerged to explain the oil-funded socioeconomic transformation of Iran and what would become the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It by and large ignores traditional modes of authority, such as sword dances at the end of tribal camel festivals, majlises (councils in which politicians field requests from ordinary Saudis), direct payments to Saudis in need, and tribal levies guarding vast expanses of desert. These six states had progressed from poor and isolated communities into wealthy and technologically advanced nations during the 1960s and 1970s. Scholars saw these states, which had tiny indigenous populations and strong monarchies, as so exceptional that they deserved a new scholarly model—the rentier model. In particular, scholars focused on the state monopolies over the fees, or “rents,” that foreigners paid for the right to extract oil from the Gulf nations. Scholars argued that these rents permitted monarchs in the Gulf to acquire the resources necessary to govern as police states without taxing their subjects or negotiating with the rest of society, as their counterparts must do in countries without oil. Within the rentier framework, the autonomy of a government vis-à-vis its population correlates to external rents from oil: the greater the revenues from these external rents, the greater the autonomy, and vice versa. If oil revenues decline, rentier governments must make significant concessions to their populations in order to remain in power.5 The rentier model and oil have even been used to explain patriarchal structures in the Middle East.6 Yet events in recent years, as well as statistics compiled by the United Nations, appear to validate Viviano’s article and to undermine the rentier model in two key ways. First, most Gulf governments lack one critical element of a police state: robust police.7 The number of internal security forces per 100,000 residents in most Gulf states is analogous to that of Portugal, Brazil, and Israel—none of which are seen as autocratic police states.8 Second, although the price of oil and revenues from oil sales increased with breakneck speed between 1999 and the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, the opposite of what the rentier model predicts has occurred. That is, governments held elections and permitted groups outside of their elites—including women, Shia, foreigners, and religious and secular opposition groups—to take a far more visible public role than before. In June 2008, for instance, Bahrain appointed a Jewish woman to serve as its ambassador to the United States.9 Together, these policies suggest that there is more to the politics of these states than oil, and they raise a host of larger questions. To begin with, could\n\n02.Foley.ch1.qxd:Layout 1\n\n4\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:12 PM\n\nPage 4\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\nthe absence of police and other internal security forces tell us something important about the nature of political power and legitimacy in the Gulf? Might the nature of power in the Gulf resemble that of other states that are not rich in oil? Does the diversity of people and workers in the Gulf suggest that discussions of politics and economics in the region require us to consider a host of peoples and traditions besides conservative Sunni Arabs? What about the role of women, especially educated women? Finally, what does the accessibility of Fox and other foreign media mean for the ability of Gulf governments to shape public opinion and to control their own media—both of which are hallmarks of authoritarian police states? * * * In this book, I address these questions in a new way. My analysis is based on four core themes. First, I treat the six GCC countries as normal states that face many of the same social, religious, and economic problems as other states over the past century. Second, I argue that many of the critical challenges that Gulf states face in the twenty-first century (religious tensions, the role of gender, and existential questions of identity) predate the discovery of oil in 1930 and reflect centuriesold social and cultural factors in the Gulf. Among the most important of these factors are tribal and local customs, patron-client relationships, commercial networks, the hajj, geographic and environmental constraints, familial traditions of governance, and religious and cultural tolerance. These factors, unlike oil, help us to explain, for example, the homosexual practices that F. P. Mackie identified in his 1940 report on Saudi public health; they also suggest why a mass circulation Saudi newspaper regularly publishes schedules for satellite television programs and employs an openly gay Saudi journalist, even though both satellite television and homosexuality are officially illegal in the kingdom.10 The record of tolerance in Gulf societies points to my third core argument: we cannot fully understand either past or contemporary realities in the Gulf unless we come to terms with its diversity and investigate the roles of Arab Sunni Muslim men along with those of women, non-Arabs, and non-Muslims. Although these last three groups are excluded from regional histories or treated as collective powerless “others” in contemporary political analysis, they have made and continue to make tangible contributions to Gulf societies. Over the past century, women, Western diplomats, Catholic and Protestant Christians, Jews, South Asians, oil company executives, Asian laborers, Shia, overseas investors, and countless others have shaped regional commerce, comforted the sick, inspired political action, educated thousands, and led soldiers into battle. Regional leaders have worked closely with these communities, granted them autonomy, and, at times, adopted them as groups that deserve the protection of\n\n02.Foley.ch1.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:12 PM\n\nPage 5\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nthe state. Gulf leaders have often provided land and funds for them to construct churches and because of this have been awarded prestigious papal honors usually given to active Catholic laymen, including knighthood in the Order of Pius and the grand cross of the Order of Saint Sylvester.11 Another important component of Gulf life and society is the impact of technological change—and this is my fourth core argument. Radio, television, air conditioning, desalinization, satellite broadcasting, the Internet, and cell phones have had at least as important an effect as oil on daily life and on politics in the Gulf. These technological advances have permitted Gulf Arabs to build communities modeled on postwar US suburbs, increase foreign and native populations, and achieve rapid economic growth. Technology has also forced them and others to face a series of cultural, environmental, and political questions that are as difficult to resolve in the twenty-first century as they were in the 1930s, when both radio and the oil industry first appeared in the Gulf. The seriousness of these problems is encapsulated by the fact that, in the 1970s, Gulf Arabs seriously believed that it was possible (in fact, likely) that their descendants would live as Bedouin Arabs—despite the fact that Gulf societies were the wealthiest and most technologically advanced nations on earth at the time. To support these arguments, I draw on a broad base of primary and secondary sources in Arabic and English: diplomatic correspondence, regional newspapers, poetry, movies, television programs, personal interviews, memoirs, missionary records, and web blogs and other Internet-related materials. I also draw on the records housed in several archives. Georgetown University’s William Mulligan Collection is an especially valuable source, since it includes hundreds of classified reports by the employees of the Arab-American Oil Company on virtually every aspect of life in the Gulf, from the books sold in bookstores to the internal politics of royal families. Of particular interest are Phebe Marr’s reports on girls and education during a key period for Saudi women—the 1960s—when education was first offered to girls throughout the kingdom. Another group of sources I use includes the first feature-length Saudi Arabian movie, Keif al-Hal? (How Are You?); YouTube videos; and Ahmed alOmran and other leading Gulf bloggers. These types of popular and alternative media provide information on Gulf society that is not present in other sources and have become an important and controversial outlet for political debate—so controversial that some Gulf governments have imprisoned bloggers and sought to censor the online content.12 * * * My argument is presented in the six chapters that follow. Chapter 2, which charts the history and politics of the Gulf states from the 1920s until the late\n\n02.Foley.ch1.qxd:Layout 1\n\n6\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:12 PM\n\nPage 6\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\n1970s, shows how Gulf rulers drew on their families’ tradition of governance dating back to the nineteenth century to maintain their authority and to repel rhetorical attacks from Arab nationalists. Rulers reinforced their legitimacy by cultivating various social networks and by promoting Islamic and tribal values. In mosques, sword dances, majlises, markets, hajj pilgrimage speeches, royal visits to provincial cities, and welfare institutions, monarchs interacted with ordinary subjects and were thereby confirmed as leaders. Many rulers further reinforced their authority through a system analogous to a welfare state in which individual subjects and tribes received generous cash subsidies, food, and clothing. Rulers also leveraged their international position and importance to Great Britain, the United States, and South Asian Muslims to win assistance and funds akin to the rents they would later receive from oil. In fact, Saudi Arabia’s dependence in the 1930s on the annual fees paid by hajj pilgrims strongly resembled the kingdom’s later dependence on the proceeds from the sale of oil. Although I discuss the importance of oil in Chapter 2, I also argue that the success of the Gulf rulers should be compared to the records of monarchs and presidents elsewhere in the Middle East, who also had access to vast oil revenues but could not maintain political stability. I emphasize several factors that are generally overlooked by historians of this period: the role of the hajj in USSaudi relations, the importance of air conditioning, the impact of US missionary hospitals and schools, and Jewish and South Asian dominance of Gulf commerce between 1900 and the 1950s. In addition, I stress the importance of radio and other mass media, which took root in the 1930s and were, by the 1960s, as much an aspect of daily life in the region as the call to prayer and Quran readings. The Gulf states treated the mass media as an aspect of sovereignty and competed fiercely with one another, as well as with Western oil companies, Arab nationalists, and regional US military bases, over stations and channels. The result was that Arabs in the Gulf—much like East Germans during the Cold War—had access to broadcasts in their native language from terrestrial radio and television stations based in neighboring states. Although regional governments heavily censored domestic radio and television content whenever they could, they did not in fact control everything that was broadcast within their national borders. Instead, they were forced to compete for domestic audiences, which overwhelmingly preferred foreign television and radio broadcasts. Chapter 3 explores the nexus of political events, economic factors, and new forms of media that appeared in the Gulf from the Iranian revolution in 1979 until the year 2000. This nexus fundamentally altered which foreign and domestic groups could demand access to state resources; it also ensured that government decisions respected the interests and views of those groups. The new media—foreign and Gulf-based—pursued their own agendas and were sometimes funded by governments and organizations that differed consider-\n\n02.Foley.ch1.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:12 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nably from those of other Gulf states. They gave a platform to dissident voices and employed Arabic-speaking journalists who could follow their own inclinations. Unlike Western journalists, Arab journalists did not depend on guides and translators. If that meant interviewing Bin Laden or covering anti-US protests in Bahrain, the stories went on the air. In Chapter 4 I discuss strategies that Gulf states have undertaken since 2000 to address the growing imbalances in their societies and to take advantage of the steep increases in the price of oil from 1999 until mid-2008. From the start, many of these policies produced unintended socioeconomic and political outcomes, some of which undermined the stability of the GCC societies. Although the decision of the Gulf states to maintain close ties with the United States may have deterred Iran or Iraq from attacking them, it also enraged important segments of GCC public opinion, convincing some people to support Al-Qaida and other organizations dedicated to using violence to overthrow Gulf regimes. Initiatives designed to reduce the dependence of Gulf economies on the proceeds from exporting oil joined with an influx of expatriate labor to reopen social divisions, since few GCC nationals were qualified to work in the positions created by the booming private sector. Moreover, the private sector’s dependence on foreign direct investment has left the GCC states open to the whims of foreign investors, especially after oil prices declined rapidly and a world financial crisis erupted in 2008. Without the benefit of new oil proceeds and foreign investment, formerly booming economies in the Gulf slowed, companies collapsed, and thousands of workers lost their jobs. Even the Gulf’s most dynamic and modern economy, Dubai, had to borrow billions of dollars from its neighbor, Abu Dhabi, just to pay its short-term debt payments to foreign creditors. Perhaps the principal beneficiaries of the political and economic reforms in Gulf societies since the late 1990s have been women, the subject of Chapter 5. The chapter focuses on four key themes. First, many women in the Gulf in the past, especially before the discovery of oil, served as teachers, entrepreneurs, and political leaders. Second, issues of gender—such as the veil or gender-separated schools—are often miscast as women’s issues when in reality they are part of a social system in which both women and men are expected to act modestly. The male dishdasha and the accompanying headgear, which are symbols of Gulf Arab identity, cover nearly as much of the body as a veil does. Third, women in Gulf societies acquired ever greater socioeconomic power in the 1990s because they were the only group beside expatriates who were able to fill the positions created by the private sector. Women benefited from the enormous investments made in education in the 1970s, especially in secondary and postsecondary schools. Since younger women on average are more literate and stay in school longer than their male counterparts, this gap will only widen in the future, especially in advanced industries, where women already dominate the workforce. Fourth, the problem of how to reconcile the desire to\n\n02.Foley.ch1.qxd:Layout 1\n\n8\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:12 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\nutilize educated women effectively with the conservative framework of Gulf society remains an important and troubling question for GCC governments and their peoples. Extending the right to vote to women and permitting them to drive—issues that make headlines today—will look minor in comparison to those issues facing the GCC states when women emerge as the only segment of the indigenous population qualified to work in modern economies. Indigenous men show few signs of wishing to compete with them, preferring to work in family businesses, the army, or the government, occupations that do not require extensive education. In Chapter 6 I investigate the role of non-Arabs, non-Muslims, and Shia in Arab Gulf societies along with the relationship of these groups to indigenous Sunni Arab peoples. US Protestant missionaries, Indian merchants, Jewish pearl dealers, South Asian business consultants, and Western oil executives have thrived in the Gulf and have built important institutions. Many of these people still make contributions to the region. Although Gulf peoples, and Saudis in particular, have a reputation for religious intolerance, the ruling families in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have readily integrated non-Muslims into their societies and granted them wide cultural freedoms and, over time, direct state protection and citizenship. Shia have faced official hostility, but they have also benefited from the rise of the oil industry and the opportunities it has provided them for rapid socioeconomic advancement. Just as indigenous Sunni Arabs have been affected by the technological and rapid political changes in the Middle East since 1990, non-Muslims and Shia have, too. These individuals can turn not only to international media and nongovernmental organizations to promote better labor practices in the Gulf but also to the Shia government in Iraq, to India, and to other states that send workers to the Gulf. Many expatriates also maintain extensive communal organizations in the Gulf and have representatives in their home country’s parliament. The demographic presence of foreigners (as much as 70 percent of the population in some states) and their sociopolitical activities have not gone unnoticed by the indigenous Sunni Arabs. Although some fear that the expatriates will lead to the eventual extinction of indigenous Gulf society, others have sought to incorporate Indian democratic traditions into civil society and to give foreigners the opportunity to become citizens. How well indigenous Gulf Arabs (and expatriate workers) reconcile these issues will play an important role in the future of the region. In Chapter 7 I argue that the GCC states are normal—not exotic—societies, which face many of the same challenges that other states have faced for decades. Although there is little doubt that petroleum will play a role in their economies for years to come, I show in this book that there are significant benefits to adopting an approach to the Gulf that does not effectively begin and end with oil. It is worth noting here that the demographic and socioeconomic concerns of Gulf Arabs are analogous to those of Europeans, who fear that\n\n02.Foley.ch1.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:12 PM\n\nPage 9\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\ntheir nations are evolving into a giant Euro Disney that will be run by foreign hordes.13 Similarly troubling is that young men in the Gulf are more interested in reckless driving, drug abuse, and other dangerous forms of behavior than in earning a college education or competing in the modern workforce—much like many of their counterparts in North America. In Georgia and other US states, men have been disproportionately affected by the recent global financial crisis and have fallen far behind their female peers in educational achievement.14 Globalization has also forced Gulf Arabs, much like other peoples, to address aspects of their past that had long been ignored or hidden, aspects such as the Jews who lived in Najran and in Manama. Such problems will continue to vex scholars for years to come as the Gulf diversifies economically and becomes a region in which oil will play a significant but less vital role over time. The economic and political structures of the GCC states may eventually resemble that of contemporary Mexico, where oil revenues allow the national government to provide social services at a lower rate of taxation but do not determine the political and economic structures of the nation’s society. The present moment is an especially exciting one in Gulf history, since states that were made suddenly wealthy by the presence of petroleum must ponder the many questions that arise as their ancient traditions come into uneasy contact with both modernity and money.\n\nNotes 1.

Indeed, it is television which may ultimately make the greatest contribution to . . . change. —Douglas Boyd, Journal of Broadcasting, 1970–1971\n\nIn late August 1952, Edward Debbas faced a challenge. The Harvard-educated1 head of Lebanon’s international airport and the interim head of the country’s airline authority had to figure out how to transport thousands of hajj pilgrims camped at the still unfinished airport to Mecca with only a week left before the start of the hajj.2 These individuals were among the tens of thousands of additional pilgrims who had decided to go on the hajj in 1952, when Saudi Arabia eliminated pilgrimage dues and Turkey’s government allowed its citizens to make the pilgrimage for the first time since the 1920s.3 As the sea and land routes to Mecca became overwhelmed with pilgrims, thousands went to Beirut, which had air service to Jeddah, the traditional gateway to Mecca. 11\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n12\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\nLess than half of the hajj travelers even knew Arabic.4 Among the many dignitaries at Beirut’s airport was Mullah Kashani, the speaker of the Iranian parliament and a fierce critic of US policy in the Middle East. King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia personally promised Kashani that he would travel to Jeddah by a special plane from Beirut, and so the mullah, along with all of the other pilgrims, arrived at the airport with ticket in hand.5 Initially, the ten daily DC-3 flights flown by Air Liban, Middle East Airlines, and Saudi Arabian Airlines could handle the travelers wishing to go to Jeddah. But as thousands arrived at the airport, it was clear what had happened: the airlines had oversold tickets, in part because of a dispute between Lebanese and Saudi airlines over how to divide the profits and fly pilgrims to Saudi Arabia.6 Britain and France could not extend state support, and Western airlines refused Debbas’s appeals for aid, insisting “that all their planes were required for existing commitments, that longer notice would have been needed, and besides, ferrying pilgrims did not offer much commercial incentive.”7 As the deadline for the hajj loomed, pilgrims began to fear that they would never make it and asked increasingly angry questions about when they could go to Jeddah.8 With days left before the start of the hajj, Debbas suggested to the Lebanese Foreign Affairs Ministry that it ask the US government for assistance. After the Saudi government approved Debbas’s idea, the Lebanese foreign minister asked the US minister to Lebanon, Harold Minor, for help.9 Minor, who had already tried to secure seabound shipping for pilgrims, sent an overnight telegram to Washington, recommending US assistance via military aircraft as a goodwill gesture.10 The State Department gave an immediate positive response, and hours later, thirteen US C-54 military transport planes arrived at Beirut’s airport.11 US officials also sent technical, mechanical, and cleaning crews to work with Debbas and other Lebanese airport employees.12 When Debbas told the hajj pilgrims that the Americans would fly them to Jeddah, many yelled out praise for Allah and for the United States. For the next four days, a C-54 took off every hour from Beirut for the tenhour round trip. Lebanese and US personnel devised a system of rope sequencing that allowed groups of eighty pilgrims at a time to be loaded efficiently.13 Following the insistence of the US military, no additional commercial airline tickets were sold, and the $260,000 of proceeds from the tickets already sold were donated to a Muslim charity.14 US planes carried as many pilgrims in four days as the local airlines had carried in three weeks, and each hajj pilgrim received a lunch courtesy of the American Friends of the Middle East.15 Each pilgrim in Beirut who already had a ticket for Jeddah arrived safely, with the last plane landing only hours before the hajj was to officially start. The Saudi government did its part, too, granting the United States Air Force full access to its airfields and extending the hajj deadline a day to facilitate the pilgrims stranded in Lebanon.16\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 13\n\nThe Emergence of the Modern Gulf\n\n13\n\nBoth Time and Life magazines ran stories on the airlift, highlighting the fact that Kashani kissed the cheeks of both the pilot, Alfred Beasley, and his co-pilot, Angelo Elmo, upon arriving in Jeddah.17 Lebanon’s mufti, Muhammad Alaya, told Minor that Muslims must include the US people—“infidels though they are—in their prayers.”18 A Turkish pilgrim cabled his nation’s prime minister and president: “The Beirut-Jedda air-bridge constitutes real international cooperation. At no time in history has so much help been offered from so far away and for such a large number of people in such a noble cause. Muslims, the whole world over, and this year’s pilgrims in particular, will not forget this gesture.”19 British officials coldly reported that the airlift “added much to American prestige” in Saudi Arabia at London’s expense.20 The US Defense Department concurred with this assessment of the operation and noted that the airlift was the most cost-effective action undertaken in years to win support for US policies in the Middle East and the broader Muslim world.21 In the eyes of US diplomats and scholars in Lebanon, the airlift displayed the “power and organizational ability of the United States in the best possible way.”22 Perhaps no people were more impressed than the Saudis, especially the man charged with administering the hajj, Prince Faysal. He had much at stake in the hajj, since the one a year earlier had been a disaster and great embarrassment for the kingdom, which defined itself at home and abroad as the protector of Mecca, Medina, and the pilgrimage. In fact, British diplomats regularly referred to the 1951 hajj as the “holocaust,” because 5,000 to 7,000 pilgrims had died from heatstroke.23 Even Faysal’s father, King Ibn Saud, had only escaped death from heatstroke because his guards promptly covered him with ice.24 The hajj went off smoothly in 1952, however. Pilots in the United States Air Force, as well as some working for the Arab-American Oil Company (ARAMCO), the US oil company in Saudi Arabia, flew pilgrims to Jeddah and directly to Mecca in US planes. In addition, US-supplied trucks moved pilgrims from Jeddah to Mecca on roads constructed by Bechtel, the US engineering firm.25 The US government had acted in Saudi Arabia’s time of need, sparing Faysal and his government considerable humiliation at the most important event of the year for Saudis. This would be a lesson that the Saudi royal family would not soon forget, even after US secretary of state John Foster Dulles decided in 1953 that the United States Air Force would never fly hajj pilgrims to Jeddah again.26 It is significant that the 1952 airlift was not the first time that Washington had lent assistance to Saudi Arabia’s hajj, nor was it the first time that the US government had contemplated using airplanes to ferry pilgrims to Jeddah. In 1943, Archibald Roosevelt, who was an intelligence officer in North Africa, proposed—with the blessing of the US legation in Tangier—that a US plane fly prominent North African Muslims to Jeddah for the hajj.27 Roo-\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n14\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\nsevelt, who was the grandson of Theodore Roosevelt and the cousin of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, thought this would be a goodwill gesture that would also counteract a Free French airlift of notable African Muslim pilgrims.28 Also during the 1943 hajj, Faysal and Ibn Saud lobbied US officials in Saudi Arabia and Washington for US financial assistance and modern transportation for the pilgrims.29 Although Great Britain readily provided assistance for that 1943 hajj, receiving prominent mention for it in Ibn Saud’s annual hajj speech, Wallace Murray and other senior State Department officials refused to assist Saudi Arabia. They argued that US assistance was impractical politically and that air travel was inconsistent with Muslim ideals of suffering while on the hajj. At that time, Saudi Arabia lay within Britain’s sphere of influence, and so it was up to London to address problems there. Furthermore, Murray observed, ARAMCO had won its contract in Saudi Arabia to explore for oil precisely because the United States lacked influence in the kingdom, and therefore Americans were not seen as a threat to its independence. If the US government were to become more involved in Saudi Arabia or its neighbors in the future, even larger oil concessions in the region might go to US competitors. Why take the risk?30 * * * The stark difference between the reactions of senior US officials in 1943 and nine years later to assisting Saudi Arabia with the hajj is central to understanding the development of the kingdom and its five Gulf state neighbors (Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates) in the half century between 1931 and 1981. During those five decades, the six states built wealthy, stable, and technologically advanced societies with modern bureaucracies and cities. Despite frequent predictions of their imminent demise, they weathered rapid socioeconomic change and the challenges posed by the collapse of the pearling industry, the rise of oil, military conflicts, the Cold War, Arab nationalism, decolonization, and Islamism. None of the states collapsed or faced a threat to its authority analogous to the revolutions that toppled the monarchies in Egypt (1952), Iraq (1958), Libya (1969), and Iran (1979). In 1981, the Gulf regimes were, in the words of Jill Crystal, “anachronistically stable monarchical regimes.”31 They were also far more stable and cohesive politically than they had been before Britain’s appearance in the region in the nineteenth century. To explain the remarkable record of continuity of these regimes, scholars universally point to one factor: the revenues that rents from petroleum extraction generated for the region’s ruling monarchies. Although Crystal, Gregory Gause, and many other scholars have marshaled impressive evidence to support this claim, we should bear in mind that monarchies in Iran, Libya, and Iraq also had access to vast oil revenues and powerful international allies but\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nThe Emergence of the Modern Gulf\n\n15\n\ncould not maintain enough political stability to survive. One could say the same thing about the dictatorial regimes in Mexico, Russia, or Venezuela, which ushered in oil development in the early twentieth century and had grown rich from it but had long been confined to the dust heap of history by 1981. By contrast, Morocco’s monarchy, which had no oil revenues, withstood the same political, social, and economic currents that crushed other longstanding monarchies in the Middle East between 1931 and 1981. Samuel Huntington and other Western scholars long looked at Morocco’s regime as anachronistic and medieval, since its claim to legitimacy rested on Islam and the king’s status as sharif, the direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. Morocco’s government appeared weak, compared to modern regimes in Egypt, Iraq, and South Yemen, which rejected religion in favor of popular sovereignty. But instead of collapsing in the face of modernity, Morocco’s monarchy flourished in the twentieth century, utilizing the police and other clearly modern tools of political control with premodern links and retaining support throughout the diverse society. By 1981, Morocco’s monarchy—much like those in the Arab Gulf—was much stronger than it had been before European colonization at the turn of the twentieth century. The close similarities between Morocco and the Arab Gulf states suggest that there are factors other than oil that contribute to state formation, new governing institutions, co-option of elites, and the maintenance of ruling coalitions. The most important of these factors is the “anachronistic” or “medieval quality” of governance, long seen as the states’ biggest weakness. But this weakness also created a vast well of historical or institutional legitimacy, which the monarchies could use to govern or to counteract political crises. Along with the sultanate of Morocco, the ruling families in the Arab Gulf were the only national leaders in the Arab world after 1960 who could legitimately claim a tradition of governance over their national territories that dated back to the nineteenth century. Rulers of seemingly stronger modern states in the Middle East could only achieve a comparable level of legitimacy by framing themselves and their governments within the tradition of ancient, often pre-Islamic heroes, peoples, and states.32 Governing in the Gulf in the twentieth century, however, involved much more than drawing on historical legitimacy, no matter how secure and broad such legitimacy was. As this chapter will show, rulers reinforced their legitimacy by cultivating tribal, familial, ethnic, religious, and commercial networks and by promoting Islamic and tribal values. In mosques, sword dances, salons (councils or majlises), markets, hajj pilgrimages and speeches, royal visits to provincial cities, and welfare institutions, ordinary subjects interacted directly with monarchs, thereby conferring legitimacy on them. Many rulers further reinforced their authority through a system analogous to a welfare state, in which individual subjects and tribes received generous cash subsidies,\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n16\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 16\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\nfood, and clothing. Rulers also leveraged their international positions to win assistance akin to the rents they would later receive from oil. In fact, Saudi Arabia’s dependence in the 1930s on the annual fees paid by hajj pilgrims— many of whom were subjects of Britain’s vast empire traveling to Jeddah on European ships—mirrored the kingdom’s high dependence on the proceeds from ARAMCO’s sale of Saudi oil in the 1970s.\n\nThe British Raj in the Gulf “Under British Protection, but not British Protectorates”\n\nFor much of the century between the 1820s and the 1920s, the Gulf was a “British lake,” which—as James Onley has recently shown in The Arabian Frontier of the British Raj—was closely tied administratively to the British Empire’s possessions in India, Iran, East Africa, and elsewhere. From Kuwait all the way to Oman, political residents and naval steamers projected Britain’s power and worked to maintain a framework by which ruling families were, in the words of one US diplomat, “under British protection, but not British protectorates.”33 As Lord Curzon, the famous viceroy of India, remarked, London “upheld the independence” of several Arab Gulf principalities, but British influence “remained supreme.”34 To maintain their empire in the Gulf, British officials followed a multilayered strategy that utilized both hard and soft power. Even though Britain generally avoided involving itself in the internal politics of the Trucial States, it capitalized on the fact that shaikhs in Kuwait, Bahrain, and elsewhere in the Gulf were often weak rulers, whose power was regularly challenged in their own families and by nearby leaders. Britain helped rulers to distribute state income from land, possessions, and minor taxes to family members and other leaders of the community. (Some shaikhs literally counted every Indian rupee paid by the British government or oil companies well into the late 1950s.35) The wealth of Gulf merchants, however, usually dwarfed that of the shaikhs, and therefore the former could resist “oppressive” policies and flee excessive taxation.36 Merchants also forced local rulers to acknowledge their authority via elected consultative councils and other traditions of mutual consultation. British officials managed the foreign affairs of Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and the Trucial States, often making decisions without consulting local leaders.37 For example, the Kuwaiti emir was not consulted when Sir Percy Cox agreed in 1922 to cede half of Kuwait’s territory to what would become Saudi Arabia. British officials worked tirelessly to exclude other powers from gaining influence in the region and discouraged both Europeans and Americans from visiting. US attempts to establish consuls in Bahrain, Muscat, and Kuwait before and even after World War II met with stiff British resistance de-\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 17\n\nThe Emergence of the Modern Gulf\n\n17\n\nspite the long-term presence of US missionaries in each territory. In addition, British officials asserted jurisdiction over foreigners in the Gulf through a system of extraterritorial laws akin to the systems in place in French North Africa and British India.38 The Gulf’s geography, climate, and socioeconomic structure cemented Britain’s ability to dominate the region without directly administering large regions of it. The area had little arable land, few skilled laborers,39 and no manufacturing, so Gulf populations imported most of their food40 and labor from abroad and depended on rent-seeking activities to survive: pilgrimage fees, transit trade, herding, pearling, and raiding.41 Whenever skilled or unskilled labor was needed, it had to be imported, often from British territories. Poor climate also provided few opportunities for European settlement. The region’s population remained small because of the dearth of resources, the harsh climate, and the frequent outbreaks of disease, including cholera, syphilis, gonorrhea, and the plague. The region’s far-flung population centers, being dependent on seaborne commerce, were vulnerable to external attack from neighboring states or tribes. Two-thirds of Gulf Arabs lived nomadic or seminomadic lives and were therefore well out of state control. Sunni Muslims were by far the largest population, but there were also Jews, various Christian denominations, Hindus, and other non-Muslims. In addition, Shia Muslims were important, especially in Bahrain and Kuwait.42 Gulf merchants further reinforced Britain’s soft power in the Gulf, as South Asians and other British subjects provided modern goods, services, and transportation. As James Onley has demonstrated, merchants served as British consuls in the Gulf and were valuable sources of intelligence, which was “needed to sustain [Britain’s] informal empire.”43 Merchants in Jeddah and other Gulf communities often sent their sons and daughters to British-run schools in Egypt and other parts of the empire.44 They also depended on Indian flour, grain, and rice controlled by the empire.45 Indian rupees and other British imperial currencies were the monetary exchange of choice in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman. British shipping transported passenger and commercial traffic to Europe, Asia, and beyond via British-controlled sea lanes, territories, canals, and straits. These types of overlapping commercial and transportation networks allowed London to control the Arab Gulf, even though it did not directly administer wide areas of the region or have formal political ties with some of its governments. In fact, Great Britain did not have a permanent representative stationed on the Trucial Coast until 1939 and lacked treaty relations with Fujairah until 1950.46 World War I and New Technologies\n\nThe settlement arrangements at the end of World War I seemingly strengthened Britain’s position in the region. The collapse of the Ottoman, German, and Russ-\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n18\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 18\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\nian empires during and after the war eliminated Britain’s principal Great Power competitors in the Gulf. Not only did London maintain its power in Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Iran, and the Trucial Coast, but it gained new bases in Iraq and new influence in the interior of the Arabian Peninsula. Britain’s extension of power in Iraq and the Gulf benefited from three technical innovations that gained in importance in the years after the war: airplanes, wireless communication (telegraphs and radios), and air conditioning. British officials in the region were especially aggressive in maintaining influence after 1933, when London switched responsibility for setting policy in the Gulf from the Foreign Office to the India Office.47 Foreign Office diplomats were sensitive to Britain’s relationship with the United States and other great powers, but India Office bureaucrats saw no reason to yield British influence to anyone in the region. The first two innovations, airplanes and wireless communication, greatly expedited imperial communications, allowing Britain to project its military might over large areas more swiftly than before. For example, in Iraq, airplanes and wireless communication allowed the British-backed Sunni monarchy to overcome geographical barriers in the north and south that had long impeded the ability of a centralized government to rule the nation. In time, Iraq would provide a useful model for dealing with rebellious tribesmen in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other states in the Gulf that faced similar geographic challenges. Airplanes were also an issue when Iran forced Britain to move its imperial air route from Iran’s Gulf coast to the Trucial States on the Arabian Peninsula in 1933. To accommodate the new route, Britain had to build airfields and establish permanent facilities in Sharjah and other areas of the Trucial Coast for the first time.48 The third innovation, air conditioning, permitted Britons and other westerners to work year-round in Sharjah and other areas of the Gulf without suffering the often disabling effects of extreme and prolonged exposure to heat. In a region where humidity can reach as high as 90 percent and daytime temperatures can regularly reach 100 degrees Fahrenheit, this technology was a major advance. For decades, the Arab Gulf was known as a “white man’s grave.” During the nineteenth century, as Onley observes, every British “political officer assigned to the Gulf suffered seriously from ill health at some point during his assignment.”49 Air conditioning in offices, homes, and work camps reduced the incidents of illness from unimaginable levels to those on a par with those in Europe and North America. A British diplomat visiting the Arab Gulf in 1940 noted that air conditioning aided efficiency and was worth an extra “two hours’ useful work a day during the summer.”50 Britain, the Oil Companies, and the Gulf\n\nAir conditioning proved especially important to the rise of the oil industry, which utilized modern machinery, employed scores of Western workers, and\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 19\n\nThe Emergence of the Modern Gulf\n\n19\n\ncame to dominate the Arab Gulf’s economy and very identity. Britain played an integral role in the industry from the start with the formation of the AngloPersian Oil Company (APOC) in 1909 and the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) in 1912 (later the Iraq Petroleum Company, or IPC). In the years immediately before World War I, Britain secured rights to extract oil from the Arab Gulf states along with promises that no future concessions would be granted to anyone else without consulting London first. Even more significant was the British Admiralty’s decision in 1912 that turned oil into the most prized strategic commodity in the world by transforming the British fleet’s steam turbine engines from coal to oil. In a single stroke, Britain ensured that the Arab Gulf would play a paramount role in global affairs over the next century. Yet the importance of the supplies of petroleum in the Gulf was hardly obvious at the time and was dwarfed by larger supplies of oil in the Americas, Russia, Iran, and other states in the Middle East. Major British companies showed little interest in the Arabian side of the Gulf coast until the discovery of petroleum in commercial quantities in 1932 by the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO), a Canadian-chartered subsidiary of US Standard Oil of California (now Chevron). Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, oil companies were formed in the Arab Gulf states, such as the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC). Modeled on APOC and IPC, KOC and its fellow oil companies had Western (usually British) management, were headquartered in the British Empire, and employed local (Arab and non-Arab) workers along with expatriates, many of whom were South Asian. The Western compounds of these companies in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, Awali, Bahrain, and elsewhere in the Gulf featured modern schools, Westernstyle housing, air conditioning, electric lights, paved streets, buses, trees, and grass.51 Air conditioning was especially important to the new compounds, as a former Dhahran resident remembered: “There are a few small squares, which in European towns would contain parks or cafes; in Dhahran they have large buzzing air conditioning units.”52 Over time, the compounds and their air conditioning provided a blueprint for a new mode of living in the Gulf that would have more in common with US suburbs than with cities of the Arab world. After the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s, oil companies gained enormous power, equal to that of many sovereign and independent states— what a Western diplomat characterized with the Latin legal term imperium in imperium (sovereignty within sovereignty).53 In fact, the oil companies developed a degree of socioeconomic and political power equivalent to that of the Canal Company in Panama and the United Fruit Company in Guatemala. This power soared as three principal sources of income for the region evaporated. The slowdown in the global economy immediately curtailed pilgrimage traffic and transitory commerce. At the same time, Japanese entrepreneur Kokichi Mikimoto’s success in developing cultured pearls produced a crash in the price of pearls. Tens of thousands of divers, merchants, and other businesses were\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n20\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 20\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\ndestitute as rulers scrambled to find alternative sources of income. Oil companies quickly provided an almost miraculous source of jobs, a demand for goods, and government revenue. The change in Bahrain’s fortunes in the 1930s was so dramatic that Stephen Longring argues that “no community and government had been more suddenly and timely rescued from disaster than [Bahrain].”54 Oil revenues also produced two key changes in Gulf societies. First, as Jill Crystal and others have noted, oil revenues transformed the power dynamics in the Arab Gulf states by concentrating wealth in the hands of the rulers, who for the first time had a source of secure income that could dwarf those of the merchants. Second, the oil industry stimulated the mass migration of South Asians to the Gulf, helping to create one of the defining features of modern life in the region, the preponderance of South Asian laborers. The mass migration reflected London’s attempts to check rising US commercial influence in the Arab Gulf and vast shortages of labor in the Gulf. Recruitment networks arose in which merchants bought certificates that allowed them to import South Asian workers into Gulf territories under British influence: a system that would be replicated in the 1960s and 1970s by independent Arab Gulf states in the form of the kafala system. Moreover, British officials used formal and informal agreements to pressure regional leaders and oil companies to open recruiting stations in South Asian cities as well as to use British subjects as clerical staff, craftsmen, and unskilled and semiskilled laborers.55 By the end of the 1930s, British policies had achieved their desired results. South Asians represented more than 90 percent of clerical and technical employees at BAPCO and dominated clerical, technical, and artisan positions in both Qatar and Kuwait.56 In both states, oil companies employed many unskilled South Asians. Indian contracting firms also often met the needs of expanding oil companies. In all cases, the factor that drove South Asian migration to the Gulf—as it would for decades—was money. South Asians working in Bahrain or Kuwait earned double the salary of comparable workers in Indian cities. In January 1948, for example, Indian clerks in Kuwait earned around 210 rupees a month in salary plus food and housing, whereas Indian clerks in South Asia earned on average 60 to 70 rupees a month.57 Yet the oil companies’ use of South Asian and other expatriate workers produced a national and socioeconomic backlash among local Arabs, who felt that it was only fair that companies should prefer local workers over expatriates. As early as 1938, Sunni and Shia Bahrainis called on BAPCO to replace foreign workers with Bahrainis, recognize a union, and standardize pay and benefits. BAPCO balked at these demands, arguing, as private employers in the Gulf today still do, that South Asians and other expatriates were far better employees than the Bahrainis were.58 Eventually, the British resident, Charles Belgrave, mediated and solved the dispute, winning a pledge by BAPCO to hire more Bahrainis at higher wages. But the basic issues of the dispute—the\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 21\n\nThe Emergence of the Modern Gulf\n\n21\n\nclash between the expectations of ordinary Gulf Arabs and the interests of private employers—continue to haunt the region. Plans to replace expatriates with local workers in Bahrain and other Arab Gulf states are part of a process that is decades old.59 Britain and the Rise of the Saudi Welfare State\n\nOil and expatriate laborers were equally important to Bahrain’s neighbor, Saudi Arabia. Although the kingdom was an independent state and would develop a partnership with a US oil consortium (ARAMCO), Britain’s influence in Saudi Arabia was as strong as it was in the Arab Gulf states, with which it had treaty relations and resident political agents. That relationship began in the first decades of the twentieth century, when King Ibn Saud, after seizing Riyadh in 1902 and reconstituting a state in the Najd, sought an alliance with Great Britain. This lasted for half a century, during which British power fundamentally shaped Saudi society, politics, and economic life. Ibn Saud viewed Great Britain as critical for recreating the Saudi-Wahhabi emirate, which his family had governed in the eighteenth century. That emirate had conquered much of the Arabian Peninsula, including the Hijaz, but had created powerful enemies because of its frequent raids on surrounding territories and its seemingly fanatical religious views. Egyptian armies, using European weapons and advisers, crushed the emirate in 1811 with the full support of the Ottoman Turkish government and other Muslims. Ibn Saud was determined that his state would not fall to a similar coalition or be surrounded by the Turks again, lack powerful European allies, or go into battle without the latest European weapons and military technology.60 He hoped that Great Britain would back his state, but also he sought assistance from the Turks, Poles, Germans, White Russians, Soviets, Dutch, and Americans.61 The logic of a Saudi-British alliance was sufficiently strong for both sides to realize the benefits of partnership, so, in 1915, the two sides reached the first of a number of bilateral agreements. In exchange for Ibn Saud’s support of Britain’s goals against the Ottoman Empire in World War I and his assurance that he would not invade Britain’s Arab Gulf dependencies, the Saudi monarch received an annual subsidy, ammunition, and modern weapons.62 British support allowed Ibn Saud’s army to seize strategic territories, such as the city of Hail, and to pacify his tribes, which for years had been raiding urban communities, neighboring territories, rival tribes, and hajj pilgrims.63 To keep the tribes from returning to their old ways and provoking a devastating British attack, Ibn Saud implemented a three-part strategy. First, using motor travel and wireless (i.e., radio) technology, he deployed force against unruly tribesmen. Second, he built an efficient intelligence service64 and, third, a welfare state65 in which his power and legitimacy, according to a Muslim Dutch visitor to Riyadh in 1931, rested “on his ability to pay, pay, pay.”66 In 1941,\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n22\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 22\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\nthe king warned a British diplomat “that if he were to remain strong in his own country,” as the British government desired, “he must be generous in his distribution of food and money to his tribes.”67 It should come as no surprise that from the 1920s until the 1950s, Ibn Saud provided generous grants of cash, foodstuffs, tea, sugar, and textiles to tribes, along with subsidized or free food to the populations of Jeddah, Riyadh, Mecca, Taif, and other Saudi towns.68 In November 1931, Ibn Saud gave 4,000 tribesmen a large meal every day and an annual “allowance” of cash.69 By 1941, he was providing subsidies to more than half a million people and feeding 30,000 people daily in Riyadh alone, which was virtually the entire population of the Saudi capital.70 Subsidies to Saudi tribes accounted for a staggering 80 percent of the kingdom’s annual budget in 1943.71 A decade later, subsidies to tribes were still a heavy charge on government revenues.72 Under this system, domestic taxation was unthinkable, and so accounted for less than 5 percent of royal income.73 Indeed, the modern Saudi welfare state was in place long before oil was the dominant factor in the kingdom’s economy. Britain, the Hajj, and the Rise of Modern Saudi Identity\n\nThe Saudi welfare state faced a near fatal crisis in the mid-1920s, when the British government ended the subsidy it had paid to Ibn Saud since World War I. Subsequent requests for assistance or loans were refused by London. In response, Ibn Saud, who no longer feared British financial reprisals, seized a neighboring territory that had been part of the original Saudi state, the Hijaz, and expelled its longtime rulers, the Hashemites. This coastal state had forms of income far more lucrative than Ibn Saud’s one-time British subsidy: hajj pilgrimage taxes, customs duties, and funds from pious endowments around the Muslim world designated for the upkeep of the Hijaz’s two holy cities, Mecca and Medina. By 1926, Ibn Saud had full control of the Hijaz, and in 1932 he merged his original Riyadh-based state, the Najd, with the Hijaz and other Arabian regions into a new kingdom that bore his family’s name, Saudi Arabia.74 Although the new state had a reputation for adhering closely to a very conservative vision of Islamic law and society, the decree establishing Saudi Arabia announced that the date of the kingdom’s founding was specifically timed to correspond to an important date in a non-Islamic calendar: the first day of the constellation Libra.75 The new state’s populations were just as diverse as those of its neighbors in the region and the broader Middle East. Non-Arabs, Jews, Christians, Shias, and Ismailis were all Saudi subjects, with non-Muslims required to pay the traditional jiziya tax instead of the zhakat—much as they had done for centuries under Ottoman rule. Greeks were among the merchants in Jeddah’s main market in 1943.76 Non-Sunni Muslim communities were strong in al-Hasa and Najran, whose Jewish population had maintained warm relations with local tribal\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 23\n\nThe Emergence of the Modern Gulf\n\n23\n\nchiefs for generations and had been the only gunsmiths.77 Homosexuality was so tolerated and pervasive that F. P. Mackie, a US doctor, expressed surprise in a report he wrote on diseases in the kingdom that he did not find “rectal complications” and other conditions commonly linked to homosexuals.78 (Natana DeLong-Bas notes in Wahhabi Islam that the founder of Wahhabis, the eighteenth-century scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, advised toleration of gay men so long as they kept their behavior private.79) US Christian missionaries visited various parts of the kingdom and were invited to the royal court. Diversity extended to the royal family itself, for some of Ibn Saud’s favorite wives and slaves were Armenian Christians.80 Ibn Saud would later tell his British confidant, St. John Philby, that he would readily marry a Jewish woman, who would “have full liberty of belief and conscience.”81 The relative tolerance of the Saudi state, which I will discuss in greater detail in Chapter 6, reflected in part the financial and political significance of the kingdom’s most diverse region, the Hijaz. Following the conquest of the region, Ibn Saud understood that the hajj pilgrimage would be of no value unless he could restore order and safety to the annual event, which had been plagued for a decade by thieves and robbers. Thanks to Saudi military power, Ibn Saud achieved this goal, allowing Muslim participation in the hajj to rise dramatically. Although the number of pilgrims had declined precipitously during the final years of Hashemite rule in the mid-1920s (there were virtually no overseas pilgrims in 1925), an average of 101,563 Muslims participated in the first four hajj pilgrimages under Saudi Arabian administration from 1927 to 1930.82 Each hajj pilgrim spent an average of nearly US$2,000 (all references to dollar figures are in US dollars) in the kingdom during his or her stay, with Saudi merchants marketing trinkets and “holy” dates and figs to pilgrims.83 As the number of hajj pilgrims skyrocketed, their receipts dominated Saudi annual revenues in much the same way that oil would in the post–World War II period. By the mid-1930s, hajj pilgrimage fees constituted 50 percent of all Saudi revenues.84 Customs duties, most of which were tied to hajj-related trade and imports, often accounted for another third of Saudi revenues. Hajj-related income was 80 percent of annual Saudi revenues, much higher than any other source, and allowed the state to demand a remarkably low level of internal taxation from the population.85 (This would remain a significant portion of the kingdom’s budget decades after the start of the oil era in the 1930s.86) For all intents and purposes, Saudi Arabia had become a rentier state economically, with hajj dues serving as the exogenous rent that permitted the government to forgo internal taxes. This model of government finance, built on external income and low domestic taxation, would eventually be adopted by every Arab Gulf state in the twentieth century. Even though the seizure of the Hijaz provided a much needed source of revenue for Ibn Saud to use to replace Britain’s subsidy, it presented a series of complex economic, foreign, and domestic challenges, the most vexing of\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n24\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 24\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\nwhich was the hajj itself. Because of the enormous time and expense involved in making the pilgrimage, Muslims would not take the trip if economic circumstances became unsettled or if travel to Saudi Arabia were unsafe. As a British economic report noted, Saudi Arabia’s dependence on the hajj and its minimal reliance on internal taxation left the kingdom’s government “particularly exposed to the consequences of any world-wide trade recession.”87 The potential consequences of this arrangement were borne out after the start of the Great Depression and World War II, when the number of pilgrims declined from 220,000 in 192788 to 50,000 in 193389 and 9,024 in 1940.90 Pilgrimage fees and other customs duties dried up, collapsing royal finances.91 Another vexing problem that the Hijaz presented to Saudi Arabia was the fact that it was economically and socially an appendage of Europe’s overseas empires—especially Britain’s empire—because of the number of hajj pilgrims who traveled from European-held territories in Asia and Africa.92 Since the nineteenth century, Europeans had been using the fear of epidemics of plague and other diseases associated with hajj pilgrims to win control of the official quarantine station on the Red Sea island of Kamar¯an, which regulated who could enter the Hijaz by sea. Although the Saudis partially circumvented Kamar¯an by building their own quarantine station at Jeddah, they could not avoid the facts that 50 to 75 percent of hajj pilgrims originated in British or Dutch territories and that an equally high percentage of hajj fees were paid in sterling, the rupee, or European-related currencies.93 Many of the charitable foundations that provided funds for the poor and other vulnerable citizens of Mecca, along with maintaining mosques and schools in the city, were located or administered in the British Empire.94 An equally important issue was that Saudi Arabia could not escape the facts that British ships carried 49 to 77 percent of hajj pilgrims traveling to the Hijaz95 or that the British Navy made an official visit to the kingdom every Ramadan.96 To address the problem of British power, Riyadh encouraged wealthier pilgrims to travel on European ships and discouraged destitute Muslims from doing so. Riyadh actively lobbied the Office International d’Hygiene Publique (the predecessor to the World Health Organization) to increase the size of cabins on hajj transport ships in order to raise the cost of traveling to Jeddah.97 The Saudis allowed a film to be made of the hajj to publicize the event abroad98 and replicated the Ottoman strategy of providing means of transport over land to serve as an alternative to European shipping. Yet it was still a British operation through and through. Britain’s role was clear in 1942, when Ibn Saud personally thanked the British government for providing food and transportation to hajj pilgrims during his annual address to Muslim dignitaries on the hajj in Mecca.99 Overcoming dependence on hajj receipts and Britain for the pilgrimage, however, paled in comparison to the challenge of establishing Ibn Saud’s legitimacy in the hajj. Here, too, the British were significant players because of\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 25\n\nThe Emergence of the Modern Gulf\n\n25\n\ntheir influence on Saudi Arabia’s neighbors to the south and east—Bahrain, Oman, the Trucial States, Yemen, and Qatar—and two northern neighbors, Iraq and Jordan. The final two were governed by members of the Hashemite family, who had long administered the Hijaz before being expelled by Ibn Saud in 1926.100 For Ibn Saud, the proximity of two Hashemite states seriously complicated his efforts to govern, because they provided a viable alternative source of authority in the Hijaz, especially since they were among the most prominent families in the Arab world and sought to retake the territory.101 In fact, the Hashemites directly and indirectly supported opposition movements to Saudi rule in the Hijaz and other parts of the kingdom.102 Ibn Saud survived several assassination attempts allegedly tied to the Hashemites.103 To counteract the Hashemite appeal, Ibn Saud pursued a four-part strategy that came to define Saudi national identity. First, he maintained close relations with the British government, hoping that it would keep Hashemite rulers in check. In particular, he treated the British ambassador in Jeddah as his virtual personal attorney on all matters and rejected favorable trade deals with Japan and Germany in the 1930s in order to maintain London’s friendship.104 Second, he participated in Bedouin war dances in Mecca and elsewhere to prove his strength and vigor and did not impede many tribal legal traditions.105 Third, he and his sons emphasized his family’s tradition of governing in association with Wahhabi religious authorities and their resistance to Turkish and European imperialism. In conversations with US and British officials, Ibn Saud and his son, Emir Faysal, stressed their family’s centuries-old rivalry with the Turks and Ottoman Empire and their vigorous support for the Arab revolt.106 Integral to Saudi notions of governance (and those of its Arab Gulf neighbors) were the ideal of equality and the principle that government leaders should be directly accountable to their subjects. Like other Arab rulers, the Saud family maintained open courts and frequently traveled to various regions of the kingdom. These rituals reinforced tribal loyalties and group solidarity (asabiyya) and gave subjects opportunities to seek personal redress for their grievances and even to challenge a monarch’s policies or actions to his face.107 Finally, Ibn Saud emphasized his personal piety and religious idealism. Although he refused to accept a position as eminent as caliph (the religious and political head of the global Muslim community),108 he referred to himself as the “Herald of Islam” and the “Imam of the Hijaz.” He also adopted a role that the Ottoman rulers had utilized to legitimize their presence in the Hijaz: custodian of the two holy places and all the Muslims therein.109 Each year, in an address delivered in Mecca at the start of the pilgrimage, Ibn Saud and his successors have reaffirmed their commitment to protect the holy places and the hajj. From the 1930s forward, the Saud family and their state defined themselves and their place in the world through their ability to manage the hajj pilgrimage for Muslim visitors, whom Saudis termed “God’s guests.” For the Hi-\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n26\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 26\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\njazis, the promise to help Muslims fulfill an obligation from God helped them as well, because of their dependence on the hajj trade.110 Irrespective of the value of the title of “Herald of Islam” at home and abroad, it left a larger question: how to reconcile the central role of the hajj in Saudi life with the fact that Saudis could not care for God’s guests without British assistance. This question became a central element in Saudi foreign policy throughout World War II and the postwar period—an element that would take precedence over virtually everything else and shape the relationship of Saudi Arabia and its Arab neighbors with Britain and other states, including the United States. Britain’s Silent Partners\n\nWhen Saudi Arabia adopted its new identity in the early 1930s, few would have predicted that the United States would take a leading role in Saudi Arabia and the other Arab Gulf states. Although Saudis and other Gulf Arabs readily bought US automobiles, kerosene, petroleum, textiles, radios, and other consumer goods, few Gulf products besides hides, skins, and pearls arrived in the United States.111 British investments in the region’s oil industry dwarfed those of US firms, which felt that they profited from the continuation of Britain’s imperial presence in Iraq, Kuwait, and elsewhere in the Gulf. With the notable exception of the wealthy philanthropist Charles Crane, very few Americans traveled to the region or called on Washington to exercise financial or political influence in the Gulf the way it had done in Latin America and Asia. It was not until World War II that there was a permanent US diplomatic representation in the region outside of Iraq. But the lack of official US presence in the Gulf masked a significant US presence on which Great Britain came to depend. Starting in 1891, the Dutch Reformed Church of America sent dozens of doctors and nurses to its mission stations in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman. Few Gulf Arabs converted to Christianity, but thousands took advantage of the modern medical care provided by the church’s doctors. In the 1920s, Louis Dame, Harold Storm, Gerald Nykerk, Paul Harrison, and Esther Barny, among others, provided medical care to Ibn Saud and other Gulf monarchs. Sara Hosman spent many decades on her own, deep in the interior of Sharjah, serving Bedouin women and men as a doctor, despite the fact that she had a wooden leg.112 Similarly, Burwell M. (Pat) Kennedy and his wife ran a mission and hospital in Buraimi, a desert oasis located in a disputed border area between Abu Dhabi, Oman, and Saudi Arabia.113 These missionaries kept in close contact with friends and family in the United States, promoted US trade, and occasionally provided intelligence to US diplomats stationed in Baghdad and Cairo. US Protestant missionaries, along with Catholics, also founded and administered some of the first modern schools and hospitals in the Gulf. Enroll-\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 27\n\nThe Emergence of the Modern Gulf\n\n27\n\nment in the schools included a broad cross section of Gulf peoples: Sunnis, Shia, various Christian sects, Jews, and Hindus. Bahrain’s Mason Memorial Hospital was the first to offer both basic dental care and x-rays in the Gulf. Missionary doctors regularly served 80,000 to 90,000 patients every year and conducted 1,500 surgeries in the Gulf annually, a remarkable number, given that the population of the region stood at only 3.6 million at the time. Christian schools, hospitals, and mobile medical missions helped lay the foundation for the contemporary educational and health-care systems in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman. Even after the Kuwaiti government built its first modern hospital in the late 1930s, US missionaries annually served 67,000 patients, which was then “approximately equal to treating every man, woman, and child in Kuwait once a year.”114 The mission facilities not only provided education and health care to Britain’s officials and their families in the Arab Gulf but also allowed Britain to reinforce its authority in regions that its officials feared to visit without considerable military support.115 It is worth noting that Britain’s attempt to enforce an arms prohibition in Dubai in 1908 met with fierce resistance, and British officials refused to station a permanent representative anywhere on the Trucial Coast until 1939 out of fear that any such individual would be killed.116 By contrast, US missionaries worked for decades on the Trucial Coast, building enduring institutions that freed London from the obligation of investing in medical and educational facilities there. Because British resources were overstretched in other parts of the world, the work of US missionaries was a welcome way for London to maintain its position in the Gulf cheaply. Missionary doctors, however, were hardly the only Americans in the Gulf who facilitated British dominance in the region. After World War I, US oil companies realized that they could not depend entirely on US suppliers to remain competitive in Asia and Europe. Middle East oil fit the needs of US companies, so after furious lobbying of British officials by Anglo and US petroleum companies and US officials under the rubric of the Open Door Policy, a series of deals was struck. US companies got access to oil fields in Iraq and Bahrain in exchange for investments in Britain’s empire, especially in the City of London, which was rapidly losing its position to New York as the center of world business. An implicit aspect of these deals was London’s belief that it could not easily maintain its empire in the Middle East economically, politically, or strategically unless it gave Washington a tangible stake in the maintenance of British imperial assets in the region. For their part, US officials welcomed the new arrangements because they believed that Washington lacked the resources and will to defend US overseas assets and that the British were the only ones who could do that. In addition, Washington permitted British diplomats in the Gulf to administer the oath of allegiance to acquire new US passports, register marriages between US citizens, and certify various types of forms for US\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n28\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 28\n\nThe Arab Gulf States\n\ncustoms agencies. Just like US missionaries, government officials of the United States and the country’s oilmen were effectively silent partners in Britain’s Raj in the Gulf.117 “Gently” Pushing for ARAMCO\n\nIt is within the context of the US-UK partnership that we can better come to terms with the rise of what came to be known in Saudi Arabia as ARAMCO. Although Britain wielded enormous influence in Saudi Arabia through the hajj and by controlling the territories that surrounded the kingdom, Anglo-Saudi relations were far from smooth in the 1930s and 1940s. During that period, Ibn Saud persistently sought British financial and military assistance,118 warning of the dangers to London if his regime weakened or collapsed. Following the establishment of a Soviet embassy in Jeddah in the 1920s, he even sought to use the specter of communist infiltration into the Middle East and the hajj to win more assistance from Great Britain.119 Time after time, British officials politely rebuffed Ibn Saud’s requests or provided aid that fell far short of Saudi expectations.120 London felt that its limited financial resources were better deployed elsewhere and that Saudi Arabia could ill afford to lose Britain’s protection, regardless of how much British support was given. The strategic value of Saudi oil reserves was not at all clear in the interwar period, and British-controlled reserves in Iraq and Iran appeared larger than anything else in the Middle East. IPC was the only major British company interested in Saudi oil reserves, but its board of directors moved slowly on Saudi Arabia’s proposals to develop the kingdom’s oil fields. Furthermore, IPC’s representative in the kingdom, Stephen Longring, reportedly hunted wild animals in the desert, went on fishing trips, and made few official contacts when Saudi officials made their decision in 1933 as to which company would receive the kingdom’s concession to export oil.121 The attitude of Longring and British diplomats in the Gulf reflected their irritation with Ibn Saud and the seemingly medieval quality of life in his kingdom. When Ibn Saud asked their opinion about his desire to award the Saudi concession to a US oil company, Standard Oil of California, they gave it their full blessing. At the time, British officials privately expressed their relief that the Saudi king would be someone else’s responsibility. Over the next decade, these officials “gently” pushed Ibn Saud toward “greater understanding and cooperation” with ARAMCO and the United States, even when he preferred to work with Britain or keep Washington at a distance because of its support of a Jewish state in the Palestinian mandate territory.122 Indeed, British officials were so committed to a Saudi-American partnership that they provided both planes and ships for Emir Faysal to travel from Saudi Arabia to the United States on a state visit in 1943.123 For its part, Standard Oil of California took advantage of the opportunity\n\n03.Foley.ch2.qxd:Layout 1\n\n2/11/10\n\n3:13 PM\n\nPage 29\n\nThe Emergence of the Modern Gulf\n\n29\n\nthat the British government had offered it. Years before the first barrel of oil was pumped out of the ground, company officials established firm ties with the Saudi government and did what London had hoped they would do: namely, they lent Ibn Saud millions of dollars annually to prop up his welfare state. Standard Oil’s investment took a lead role in various aspects of Saudi society, from economic development, to agriculture, to transportation for the royal family and the hajj pilgrims. Company officials usually blurred the lines between Saudi interests and those of the company, which was, for all practical purposes, a sovereign, independent entity operating within Saudi Arabia. By 1940, the company’s chief representative had amassed more power and influence than any foreign diplomat except Britain’s.124 And it was not unheard of for ARAMCO to host senior foreigners in the kingdom and introduce them to Ibn Saud. British policy in Saudi Arabia in the 1930s was an unqualified success: the kingdom’s government, a British ally, remained stable with little direct cost to the British treasury. World War II, the Mass Media, and a New Arrangement in the Gulf\n\nIn many ways, the Anglo-American partnership forged in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Gulf during the interwar years strengthened during World War II, but it also evolved in important ways that would transform the region in the postwar period. Washington deployed military and diplomatic assets in Bahrain, the Trucial Coast, Iran, and other nearby areas to help Britain protect its communication and supply routes and oil fields, which briefly came under Italian attack in 1943. For the first time, Washington no longer had to depend on the British Navy to protect US overseas commercial assets in the Middle East. It could depend on the power of the United States Navy and later the United States Air Force. During the war, Washington established a naval base in Bahrain and an airfield in Saudi Arabia. The military power of the United States in the region was beginning to match its economic clout there. Washington and London also cooperated in containing the economic disruption that resulted from Japanese and German attacks on Allied shipping. Additional problems were inflation, especially in the Gulf, and the severe shortage of oil tankers and hajj transport ships. In some parts of the Gulf, inflation grew fourfold in sterling and 50 percent in gold between 1939 and the mid-1940s.125 A US report noted in 1944 that inflation and rising food prices during the 1940s had overwhelmed the Saudi welfare state and resulted in malnutrition among adults in the kingdom and acute food shortages in Riyadh.126 To address these problems, Britain and the United States gave financial, agri"
