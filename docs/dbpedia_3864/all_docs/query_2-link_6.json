        "text": "Roy Cole has very helpfully provided me with areas for the districts. He downloaded a public-domain ArcInfo map of the districts from the USAID Data Dissemination Service . Then he calculated the areas using a geographic information system, Manifold GIS 6.0. The results should be considered a close approximation to the actual areas, probably within a few km.².\n\nThe list of 63 districts below is taken from the Population Statistics pages of the Zimbabwe Relief and Recovery Unit site. However, it doesn't exactly match the districts as seen on several online maps. The details of the differences are as follows.\n\nThis Zimbabwe map , from the Southern Africa Humanitarian Information Management Network, is captioned \"Base map, DFID, 2002, Partial Data, Not verified.\" I think that means that the districts are shown as of 2002 or earlier, and may be incomplete. This Zimbabwe map is from the ZRRU site. The ZRRU was formed in October 2001. I believe this map is more recent than the SAHIMN one. If that's true, and if both maps are accurate, the changes shown are these: Chinhoyi district merged with Makonde; Chitungwiza district merged with Harare; Gokwe district split into Gokwe North and Gokwe South; Mutare Urban district split from Mutare; name of Muzarabani district changed to Centenary. (The ZRRU map shows two Chivi districts side by side, an obvious mistake; the one to the east should be labeled Masvingo.)\n\nThe ZRRU site has several other maps. This typical Zimbabwe map is dated November 2003. Some districts on this map are unlabeled. Comparing it to the first ZRRU map, the differences are that Bulilimalangwe district is split into Bulilimalangwe North and Bulilimalangwe South, and Chitungwiza district is shown separate (but not labeled).\n\nFinally, the census list shows Harare divided into four districts (Chitungwiza, Epworth, Harare Rural, and Harare Urban), where the maps all show it as one or two districts (Harare and sometimes Chitungwiza). The census list does not show Chinhoyi district, which presumably is included in Makonde. The census list shows both Bulilimalangwe and Gokwe split into north and south districts. And there are a few name changes. According to the census list, the halves of Bulilimalangwe are called \"Bulilima (North)\" and \"Mangwe (South)\". The census list gives the spelling Mukoto for a district that everyone else spells Mutoko.\n\nNameHASCPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²) BeitbridgeZW.MS.BB104,21213,4225,182 BikitaZW.MV.BK156,8205,2502,027 BinduraZW.MC.BD142,0262,245867 BingaZW.MN.BG118,84213,0585,042 BubiZW.MN.BU47,7125,5662,149 BuheraZW.MA.BH218,5705,3672,072 BulawayoZW.BU.BL676,787465179 Bulilima (North)ZW.MS.BM94,36112,9084,984 CentenaryZW.MC.MZ107,7184,1471,601 ChegutuZW.MW.CG224,5895,3072,049 ChikombaZW.ME.CK120,7476,6012,549 ChimanimaniZW.MA.CM115,2503,3491,293 ChipingeZW.MA.CP283,6715,2962,045 ChiredziZW.MV.CR232,61618,0996,988 ChirumhanzuZW.MI.CH70,4414,7371,829 ChitungwizaZW.HA.CT321,7826324 ChiviZW.MV.CV155,4423,6271,400 EpworthZW.HA.EP113,884(Harare Rural) Gokwe NorthZW.MI.GN214,652(Gokwe South) Gokwe SouthZW.MI.GS294,62718,2467,045 GoromonziZW.ME.GM178,2272,459950 GuruveZW.MC.GV184,8287,5282,906 GutuZW.MV.GT198,1307,1602,765 GwandaZW.MS.GD133,16711,0444,264 GweruZW.MI.GW225,3356,2242,403 Harare RuralZW.HA.HR23,310823318 Harare UrbanZW.HA.HA1,444,534(Harare Rural) HurungweZW.MW.HU309,82119,2017,413 HwangeZW.MN.HW132,18529,68811,463 InsizaZW.MS.IN86,3078,4473,261 KadomaZW.MW.KD235,5319,2123,557 KaribaZW.MW.KR58,8647,9433,067 KwekweZW.MI.KW289,0398,8003,398 LupaneZW.MN.LU98,9857,7352,986 MakondeZW.MW.MK167,4368,5313,294 MakoniZW.MA.MN272,5787,8133,017 Mangwe (South)ZW.MS.MG78,427(Bulilima) MaronderaZW.ME.MA155,1523,5131,356 MasvingoZW.MV.MV265,1727,0092,706 MatoboZW.MS.MT99,3867,4232,866 MazoweZW.MC.ME199,4084,3751,689 MberengwaZW.MI.MB183,7125,0961,967 Mount DarwinZW.MC.MD199,1054,3801,691 MudziZW.ME.MI130,5144,0361,558 MurehwaZW.ME.MU162,6603,4331,326 MutareZW.MA.MR389,9885,6502,182 MutasaZW.MA.MS167,4622,545982 MutokoZW.ME.MO124,4103,9641,530 MweneziZW.MV.MW125,71113,2505,116 NkayiZW.MN.NK111,1185,3072,049 NyangaZW.MA.NY119,3705,6132,167 RushingaZW.MC.RU67,1342,259872 SekeZW.ME.SE77,8402,540981 ShamvaZW.MC.SM98,0462,6861,037 ShurugwiZW.MI.SR884,4393,6651,415 TsholotshoZW.MN.TS119,2217,8443,028 UmguzaZW.MN.UG73,3146,1552,377 UMPZW.ME.UM105,2012,6091,007 UmzingwaneZW.MS.UZ58,5692,8201,089 WedzaZW.ME.WE70,6042,569992 ZakaZW.MV.ZA184,8143,1581,219 ZvimbaZW.MW.ZB220,5955,9792,308 ZvishavaneZW.MI.ZV103,0862,6751,033\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision\n\ncodes.

The Rural District Councils Act 1988, purported to end the dual system of local government in rural Zimbabwe, through amalgamation of the Rural Councils and the District Councils into 55 Rural District Councils.\"\n\nThe ZRRU page doesn't show any 1992 population for Epworth district or for any of the districts in Matabeleland South and Midlands provinces. This may mean that Epworth district was created, and the two provinces were reorganized, between 1992 and 2002.\n\nOther names of subdivisions:"
