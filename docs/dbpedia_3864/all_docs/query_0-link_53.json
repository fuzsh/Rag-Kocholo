        "text": "Anti Americanism is not a new phenomenon and has been around even before the founding of the country. Many Americans believe Anti Americanism rose after the Invasion of Iraq in 2003. While some on the Far Left claim its Americas imperial actions after 1945. Some point out its our “ignorance” and obesity rates. However Anti Americanism has been around for a very long time. This article will explain that.\n\nAmerica:A Naturally Degenerate Land\n\nAmerica was a land before it was a society or country. A strange and mysterious place, virtually the first entirely new territory Europe discovered since starting its own modern civilization. The experience might have been the closest in history to finding another planet with alien life forms. Understanding what went on in this strange locale would always be difficult enough for Europeans despite the fact that their culture would be the biggest influence on the place. Comprehension would be far more so for those from societies having even less in common with the United States.\n\nCertainly, it seemed reasonable for people to expect that the climate, soil, and other physical features in such a thoroughly distinctive place would make for a very different type of human being and social order. The very fact that Europeans knew that the new world they found populated with Native Americans was technologically behind them and considered it to be spiritually inferior as well made it easy to conclude that this relative backwardness had been inevitable. Obviously, too, the idea that America was inferior had a great appeal for Europeans since this validated the superiority of themselves and their way of life.\n\nPerhaps America was doomed and destined to be always inferior. If so, any effort to implant civilization there would fail or, even worse, produce a monstrous hybrid, a Frankenstein’s monster, that some day would menace its creators. Even those who accepted the basic principles on which the United States was ostensibly based often strongly rejected the way they were implemented there.\n\nMany themes of later anti-Americanism began to appear from this very start. A key, though often subtle, element would be the view of America as a separate civilization, at first by Europe and later from other parts of the world of the world as well. Though descended from Europe it was also different, an experiment with unique features. Long before America was a power on the world scene, it had power as an example, a role model to be exalted or despised.\n\nThus, while some Europeans as early as the eighteenth century would think America offered the vision of a better future, others would consider it a horrifying caricature of all that was good in their own society. The debate between these two standpoints, with many variations in each camp, would continue for centuries, shifting emphasis over time but maintaining the same basic themes down to the present. Such arguments, and the divisions between pro- or anti-American sentiments, were also always related to local political or philosophical conflicts.\n\nThis dispute’s first round took place in the eighteenth century as part of a broader debate over the proper form of society. Was change a good thing or something better to avoid or limit? Would such new forces as a faster pace of life, lower class barriers, democracy, and a mass rather than elite culture, advance or destroy civilized life? For better or worse, America was seen as a test case of these and other propositions.\n\nAdvocates of material progress, like the mercantilists, saw the development of America with its vast natural resources as a remarkable opportunity to enhance Europe’s wealth. By providing raw materials and furnishing markets, colonies there would furnish the mother country with endless riches, though obviously only as long as they remained under European control. It was in this context that Anne-Robert Jacques Turgot, the eighteenth-century French minister of finance and advocate of economic development, called America the “hope of the human race.”\n\nBut their rivals, the physiocrats, asked why Europeans should become involved in this far-off land instead of focusing on preserving their way of life at home, with an emphasis on agriculture rather than commerce or industry. They feared the coming of a new type of society whose shape had not yet even become clear. But they already felt that American products or ideas would undermine traditional life. It was a sentiment perhaps best put into words later by the romantic Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi, who warned in 1820, America was a danger because it would destroy Europe’s “supremely poetic” “other world” of “pleasant dreams” and “beautiful imaginings” with a soulless, low-quality, hard-edged society.\n\nAmerica similarly became a test case in the debate over the nature of human beings themselves. Was America’s newness a sign of unspoiled innocence or a rawness that would make it reject higher civilization? If everything good was already created by tradition, if European society was already the peak of achievement, starting afresh was a dangerous and doomed enterprise. To the majority, the new land was simply backward, but a new wave of thinkers — whose agenda was also the renewal of Europe — argued that the very lack of deep-seated traditions and an established structure would let America create a successful society.\n\nOne of the American experiment’s most passionate and articulate proponents was Michel- Guillaume-Jean Crèvecoeur , a Frenchman who fought in his country’s losing war against Britain and then became a farmer in upstate New York in 1765. When the United States gained independence two decades later, he wrote lyrically that America was, “The most perfect society now existing in the world” because it was so fresh and flexible. It was welding together immigrants from all over Europe “into a new race of men, whose labors and posterity will one day cause great change in the world.” In contrast to Europeans, Americans did not “toil, starve, and bleed” on behalf of princes but for their own benefit under leaders they freely chose. Europe would learn new ways of living and governance from this people’s achievements.\n\nCrevecoeur was in the minority. Most members of Europe’s governing and intellectual elite believed that civilization was a delicate matter. They feared any deviation from the existing order–a stable class system based on a monarch’s and an aristocracy’s setting of standards–would be a catastrophic failure. From this perspective would arise the conservative version of anti-Americanism.\n\nThat is not to say, however, that all advocates of change in Europe liked the American experiment. Many of those had their own vision of society to propose as better and more worthy of global imitation than what the United States offered. While conservatives disdained America’s innovations as too extreme, adherents of the romantic cultural movement and radical political ideas, which spread at the eighteenth century’s end, found them to be too limited.\n\nBoth schools would also have much in common, sometimes combining in strange and unexpected ways. When the United States was just a few years old, they were already agreeing to decry it as too materialistic and middle class. Its version of democracy was directionless, amplifying the worst impulses of the masses rather than the leadership of a cultured superior or intellectual elite. Radicals and conservatives certainly concurred that such a society would be a disaster if it was to be the model for their own countries or the world.\n\nBut the very first debate on America of all, in the eighteenth century and long before the United States even existed was over whether civilization was possible there at all. The initial thought of eighteenth-century European science, then in its infancy and much taken by ideas of innate and permanent characteristics, was that something “degenerate” about North America’s environment made it innately inferior. This degeneracy theory would be discredited and eventually forgotten yet its basic concept continued to form the basis, a subbasement in effect, for the nagging proposition that the United States was certainly different and somehow inevitably wrong, bad, or a lesser place altogether.\n\nEuropean civilization’s striking discovery that it was more technologically advanced and the belief that it was more spiritually and culturally so than Americas’ native inhabitants had to be explained. Why were the people of this little-known land relatively backward? Were they cursed by the lack of the proper religion, some racial handicap, or an environmental deficiency? Even if one recognized the advanced civilizations of the Aztecs and Incas in South America why was there nothing remotely equal in the north?\n\nThe resulting theory would predict that the same plight of backwardness was a powerful force that could strike white Europeans who tried to settle America. This was no abstract or marginal debate. It involved Europe’s best minds, the leading naturalists, scientists and philosophers of the day. Few of those who insisted that America was intrinsically inferior to Europe ever visited there. Like many later anti-Americans, their theories were based on ignorance and misinformation or a distortion of facts designed to prove some political standpoint, philosophical concept or scientific theory.\n\nThese claims could also be based on some apparently self-evident observations. Why, European thinkers asked, was the American continent so sparsely populated? Didn’t this imply it lacked the essential requirements for human life? Even if America could eventually be civilized, this task just beginning would require, as it had in Europe, countless generations to achieve. Moreover, they added, in Europe nature was fairly benign and assisted man, while in America such features as hurricanes, floods, lightning storms, poisonous snakes, deadly insects, and epidemic diseases were a wild force which would have to be conquered with great difficulty.\n\nThe issue of climate obsessed the Europeans, especially since they heard most about the blizzards of frosty New England, frigid French Canada and the humid south. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with no air conditioning or effective central heating, people were the pawns of weather. The food one ate, health or infirmity, wealth or poverty all depended on the climate. Extremes of hot or cold were said to create unstable people and conditions inimical to progress.\n\nEqually, most Europeans considered the taming of nature to be the basis of civilization. The gardens of England and France were well-ordered affairs in which flowers, waterfalls, and trees were made to march in discipline. Wild nature meant wild men; a disorderly environment engendered a lawless and backward society. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau might see Native Americans as exemplars of the “noble savage” who enjoyed freedom without the burdens of an oppressive social structure. But most of his contemporaries were convinced that they were only savages plain and simple.\n\nAnd how could their environment permit anything else? For either it made civilization impossible or, at best, it might take many centuries to wrest a decent society from the hostile wilderness. European thinking leaned toward the view that success was impossible. In his noted 1748 work, The Spirit of the Law, the French philosopher Charles de Montesquieu said that the “temper of the mind” and “passions of the heart” are prisoners to climate. In cooler ones, such as in Northern Europe, people were more vigorous, possessing additional strength, courage, and frankness while being less prone to suspicion. But he also warned that a wilderness that had remained largely uninhabited must have a dangerous climate, perhaps fatal to any colonists who went there. Taming this hostile soil and climate would require a constant, probably losing battle.\n\nMost of the ammunition for the early anti-Americans came from another Frenchman, Georges Louis LeClerc, the Count de Buffon. Although now largely forgotten, Buffon was considered to be the greatest biologist and naturalist of his time. His works were widely read and quoted. Born in 1707 into a family of minor officials in a provincial town, he was at first an indifferent student of law and later of mathematics at the University of Angers. Leaving school, he embarked on extensive travels throughout Europe.\n\nOn returning to France in 1732, however, Buffon become both serious and ambitious. Ironically, as a social-climbing, innovative, aggressive self-promoter, Buffon seemed to embody the kind of figure who two centuries later would be the French intellectuals’ negative stereotype of an American. Indeed, Buffon was such a good politician that he even survived the French Revolution with his head intact, no mean feat for a man who became a royal official and aristocrat.\n\nBuffon’s success began when he started translating into French works by the British scientist Isaac Newton and others. He networked with the aristocracy until his contacts brought him to the favorable attention of King Louis XV. As a result, in 1739, Buffon was elected to the prestigious Academy of Sciences and became director of the Royal Botanical Garden, making him officially the country’s top expert on nature. He was a colorful figure known for fancy clothes (his lace cuffs were famous) and the pursuit of women, money and power.\n\nDespite cultivating a superb image, however, he was not a very good scientist. Hhis theories and factual statements were often wrong, not surprising since he rarely did experiments. As an excuse, Buffon claimed that focusing too much on factual details would make it harder to understand the whole, an approach that would characterize the critique of America made by many future French intellectuals.\n\nBuffon’s main work was a multi-volume natural history intended to summarize all human knowledge about geology, zoology, and botany. Each known animal, for example, was described in great detail. When the first three volumes were finally published in 1749 they were translated into most European languages. Buffon became an international celebrity. In honor of his accomplishments, the king made him a count in 1771.\n\nAside from classifying animals, vegetables, and minerals, Buffon also divided humanity into different subgroups along racial lines. All people, he believed, had originated in a single species but had been modified by the climate, diet, and physical conditions in which they lived. America’s environment was so hostile that adaptation there was the opposite of growth, it was degeneration. America would remain backward because its environment was so hostile as to make civilization there virtually impossible.\n\nBuffon, who never visited America, insisted that nature there was, “Much less varied and…strong” than in Europe. Ignorant of such impressive American animals as the buffalo and grizzly bear, Buffon claimed that the biggest American animals were “four, six, eight, and ten times” smaller than those of Europe or Africa. There was nothing to compare to the hippopotamus, elephant, or giraffe. Even if the same animal could be found in both the old and new worlds — like the wolf and elk–the former version was always better. For example, the American puma was “smaller, weaker, and more cowardly than the real lion.”\n\nThe most impressive proof of America’s innate degeneracy, Buffon claimed, was that “all the animals which have been transported from Europe to America–like the horse, ass, sheep, goat, hog, etc–have become smaller.” What went for animals also applied to people. The Native American “is feeble and small in his organs of generation; he has neither body hair nor beard nor ardor for his female; although swifter than the European because he is better accustomed to running, he is, on the other hand, less strong in body; he is also less sensitive, and yet more timid and more cowardly; he has no vivacity, no activity of mind….” In sum, using phrases like those applied by anti-Americans two centuries later to the people of the United States, he concluded, “Their heart is frozen, their society cold, their empire cruel.”\n\nWhat caused this degeneration? Buffon thought it due to the New World’s being both too cold and humid. Without ever inhaling a breath in America, he felt confident in concluding that its air and earth were permeated with “moist and poisonous vapors” which created a “cold mass” unable to give proper nourishment except to snakes and insects.\n\nThis pessimistic belief was widely accepted throughout Europe. Among the many who echoed such views was the great French philosopher Voltaire who said that the American climate and environment was so inimical to human life that it made no sense for France to fight to obtain “a few acres of snow” there. Prospective immigrants, mostly from the poorer classes, either did not hear or ignored such claims and went to America anyway.\n\nAdding grist to the argument, though, was the work done by Peter Kalm, a scientist sent by the Royal Swedish Academy on a three-year study tour of America in 1748. In contrast to Buffin, Kalm was a meticulous scientist who, for example, recorded daily temperature readings in Philadelphia over a four-month period in 1749. But his analysis was also colored by naivety, he believed reports that rattlesnakes caught squirrels by hypnotizing them, and bias, especially against German immigrants he met there.\n\nIn his book on America, Kalm claimed that cattle brought from England became smaller. Though he acknowledged that many of the settlers were robust, he also said they had shorter life spans than Europeans, women ceased having children earlier, and everyone was weakened by the constantly changing weather. America’s climate, Kalm, concluded, inevitably made people there disease-ridden and beset by aggressive insects. When Kalm’s book was reviewed in Europe, like other works of the time, his most negative remarks about America were highlighted.\n\nBut next to Buffon, the greatest eighteenth-century popularizer of anti-American thinking was Cornelius De Pauw. Born in Holland in 1739 he spent most of his life in Germany at the court of the Prussian king in Berlin. Somehow, De Pauw, who never visited America, became Europe’s leading expert on that land following publication of his book, Philosophical Research on the Americans, in 1768. It was a big hit in both Germany and France.\n\nLike many later anti-Americans, he had a hidden agenda. DePauw worked for the Prussian ruler King Frederick II who launched a systematic anti-American campaign. Thus, Prussia became the world’s first state sponsor of anti-Americanism, based on its regime’s interests. Since Prussia had no colonies in the Americas that region must be made to seem a worthless distraction and even dangerous to discourage growing German emigration to America, where they would become British subjects and enrich that rival country.\n\nAccording to De Pauw, Europe’s discovery of America was the most disastrous event in the history of civilization. Useful European products — like wheat, clothing and wine — were shipped off to the colonies in return only for useless luxuries like gold and tobacco. Not only were animals in America smaller than in Europe, he explained, they were “badly formed.” Those brought over from Europe became “stunted; their height shrank and their instinct and character were diminished by half.” Indeed, everything in America was “either degenerate or monstrous.” The natives were cowardly and impotent. “In a fight the weakest European could crush them with ease.” Women quickly became infertile and their children, despite an early precociousness, lost all interest and ability to learn.\n\nInitiating another key anti-American theme of later times, De Pauw was the first European to insist also on the innate inferiority of American culture. In 1776, on the verge of the American revolution, De Pauw wrote another book explaining that there was not a single American philosopher, doctor, physicist or scholar of note. He described Americans as stupid, indolent, lazy, drunken, physically weak and therefore — not surprisingly — incapable of making progress.\n\nIn similar terms, Abbe Guillaume Thomas Francois Raynal, a Jesuit priest, teacher, economist, and philosopher, was the key person setting the tone for French thinking about America. His history of the Western hemisphere appeared in the 1770s and eventually went through twenty authorized editions and another twenty pirated ones. Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson read it with horror.\n\n“Nature,” explained Raynal, “seems to have strangely neglected the New World.” English settlers in America “visibly degenerated” in their new environment. They were less strong and less courage, but also incapable of prolonged thought. America failed to produce a single good poet, mathematician or any superior person in art or science whatsoever. Granted, he explained, Americans were precocious but then they soon slowed down and fell far behind their European counterparts.\n\nIn addition to all this, Raynal could also be called the first leftist anti-American. The European conquest of America had brought death, disease, slavery, and destruction to the innocent natives there, he wrote. Since America was the child of such evil imperialism, Raynal insisted, nothing good could come of it.\n\nDegeneration theory formed the bedrock of German as well as French intellectual views about America. Such ideas became so predominant in Germany as to be repeated by that country’s four greatest philosophers of the era. All agreed that America was fatally cursed. Immanuel Kant wrote in 1775 that Americans are “a not yet properly formed (or half degenerated) sub-race” with a “frigidity and insensibility of temperament.” Climate made these people, “Too weak for hard work, too indifferent to pursue anything carefully, incapable of all culture, in fact lower even than the Negro.”\n\nKant’s colleague, G.W.F. Hegel, like many later ideologues, had to dismiss America because it did not fit into the simplistic linear model he constructed for the development of states and civilizations. Rather than revise his categories, he had to distort the American reality to prove them. In the 1820s, Hegel argued that civilization could only develop in temperate climates whereas in North America surviving the “glowing rays of the sun” and “icy frost” took most of people’s energy. As a result, the New World’s animals were smaller, weaker and more cowardly; their meat was neither tasty nor nourishing; and the birds had unpleasant voices. America lacked such basic requirements of civilization as the presence of iron or the horse.\n\nHegel combined the degeneration theory with the newer view of America as a failed society. The United States was held back because it had too much geography and not enough history to attain the population concentrations and traditions necessary for real civilization. So far, it had produced nothing original and was of no real interest for Europeans. There was little room in his worldview for a workable democracy which he thought trespassed on two of his main values by putting individualism ahead of community and weakening the state for the sake of private property.\n\nA third influential German philosopher, Friedrich von Schlegel, wrote of America in 1828 that “many of the noblest and most beautiful species of animals did not exist there originally and others were found most unseemly in form and most degenerate in nature.” And Arthur Schopenhauer claimed in 1859 that the inferiority of American mammals went hand-in-hand with the country’s ignorance, conceit, brutal vulgarity, and idiotic veneration of women.\n\nEven in England, which had more experience than any other European country with what would become the United States, similar thinking prevailed. The leading American expert there during the first years of U.S. independence was William Robertson, a historian, Presbyterian minister, and politician who, in his History of America published in 1777, repeated all the familiar arguments about the cold climate, impoverished nature, “rude and indolent people,” and inferior animals. The climate which had “stunted the growth and enfeebled the spirits of its native animals proved pernicious to such as have migrated into it voluntarily.” His book, too, became a huge success and was translated into many languages.\n\nAs one can well imagine, these prejudices drove Americans crazy. Knowing their experience totally refuted such claims, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson felt angry and frustrated in trying to prove their inevitable inferiority was a myth, especially when this problem became a vital issue during their independence struggle. If America was ever to be a country instead of a colony ruled by Britain, it had to convince other Europeans to give financial and military help by showing that a viable state and economy could be created in the North American wilderness. This is why they so passionately welcomed Europeans like the Marquis de Lafayette or Alexis de Tocqueville who saw America not as the permanent victim of its past but as the wave of the future.\n\nIn 1755, Franklin published a work showing that America’s population was thriving not decaying. For example, he pointed out that there were twice as many marriages in America than in Europe, each resulting in eight births compared to four in Europe, and doubling of the population every 20 years. As the patriots strove to persuade Europe to back independence for the United States, they sent Franklin to Paris as ambassador to mobilize support.\n\nAt a banquet he held at his home there in February 1778, Franklin asked all the guests to stand against a wall in order to see who had really “degenerated.” All of the eighteen Americans were taller than the eighteen Europeans there. And, as the most delicious conceivable irony, the shortest of them all — “a mere shrimp” in Franklin’s words — was Raynal himself, the main champion of the claim that Europeans were physically superior!\n\nJefferson was equally obsessed with proving anti-Americanism wrong. He wrote a book, Notes on the State of Virginia in part to disprove the degeneracy concept. Jefferson compiled records of the weather for information, to prove that America was not so cold and wet and reports of animals that were not so tiny, as detractors had claimed. He pointed out that the American bear was twice as big as its European counterpart and that fossil elephants discovered in America were gigantic. Of fourteen animals common to both continents, he concluded, seven were actually larger in America while seven more were of equal size.” He compiled statistics to demonstrate how rapidly the population grew, disproving the idea that Americans were sickly and relatively infertile.\n\nAfter the revolution, Jefferson took Franklin’s old job as the American ambassador to France where he continued his predecessor’s efforts to combat anti-American ideas. In 1787, he had the remains of a New Hampshire moose shipped to France and displayed in the lobby of the hotel where he lived to show that American animals were big. In response to Raynal’s claim that there were no distinguished Americans, Jefferson modestly proposed Washington for his military achievements, Franklin as a genius in physics, and David Rittenhouse, a Pennsylvanian who would succeed Franklin as president of the American Philosophical Society, as an astronomer and artist.\n\nAlong with Jefferson’s and Franklin’s great efforts, the American victory over Britain in the revolution had some effect in modifying European views. After hearing Franklin describe America’s growth and prosperity, Buffon in 1777 publicly rejected the degeneration theory, conceding, “In a country in which Europeans multiply so readily, where the natives live longer than elsewhere, it is hardly possible that men degenerate….[In] North America, only strong and vigorous men were found, and all accounts agree on this point. .\n\nEven Raynal, impressed by Franklin, admitted that education was spreading in America, children were well brought up, and that Americans had more leisure to develop their intellects than Europeans. Indeed as reflecting his own new uncertainty about the issue, Raynal personally underwrote an essay contest on whether America was a blessing or a curse to mankind.\n\nWhile after 1783, America was no longer so easily criticized as a formless continent whose climate made it inferior, the degeneracy theory was still repeated by many Europeans. Alongside it, however, new claims arose about the inferiority of the American system and society. The random mixing of different immigrant groups and a democratic system, it was said, undermined any possibility for the development of good manners, fine morals, and high culture.\n\nThe revolution’s triumph and the founding of the United States as a republic also encouraged European liberals, who praised America because they wanted to see more freedom and representative government in their own countries. But indeed, as so often was to happen thereafter, institutions and policies that made friends also inspired enemies, especially among conservatives or those soured by the excesses of the French revolution who wanted to blame America as its model. Thus, the creation of the United States as a democratic republic gave birth to the idea that such a system could work elsewhere and thus encouraged those opposing that idea to prove that America was a bad role model.\n\nThomas Moore, an Irish romantic poet who traveled through America in 1803 and 1804, merged the old and new schools of anti-Americanism in what might have been the first anti-American poems. Despite his Irish nationalism and satires on the British, Moore was horrified at a new society he saw as miserly, quarrelsome, and uncouth. “The rude familiarity of the lower orders” and low level of society might be acceptable if they came from a new and inexperienced people. Instead, the fact that Americans were not merely passing through a naively youthful stage but were already full of a vice and corruption that destroyed any hope that the country would be great in the future.\n\nIn a series of poems on America, Moore wrote that a combined degenerate environment of “infertile strife” and a rabble of immigrants created a:\n\n“Half-organized, half-minded race\n\nOf weak barbarians swarming o’er its breast\n\nLike vermin gendered on the lion’s crest.”\n\nAmericans were “the motley dregs of every distant clime” who reeked “of anarchy and taint of crime.” Like anti-Americans of two centuries later, Moore concluded that the United States had no future but was already on the decline, a dying empire.\n\nComing from the opposite end of the political spectrum, Thomas Hamilton, a British conservative, agreed with the rebellious poet. During his visit in the 1830s he concluded that America was plagued by a wretched climate including extreme temperature changes and emanations from swamps that blighted life. Others spoke of excessive heat, thunder showers, and cold winds which supposedly led to disease far in excess of Europe and made Americans weak and narrow-shouldered. Even Charles Darwin, the great British naturalist, could still suggest in the 1830s that Buffon was largely correct. If fossil evidence showed large animals had once lived there this only proved that any vigor or creative force America once possessed “had lost its power.” Thus, America was an example of evolution heading in the wrong direction.\n\nThe greatest influence in preserving the theory of degeneracy into the 1830s, as well as spreading anti-Americanism generally during that era, was a young German-speaking, Hungarian poet named Nikolas Lenau. Famous for his melancholy moods, Lenau said he hoped that going to America would cure him. As a liberal, Lenau had considered the United States to be the beacon of liberty and regarded Europe, caught in the toils of monarchist repression, as a lost cause. This, he claimed, motivated him to emigrate to the United States in 1831.\n\nInstead, the experience banished his political ideals. His first year seemed hopeful but then things started going wrong. Lenau became ill and was injured in a fall from a sled. He never learned much English and lost money on a property he bought in Ohio. With his enthusiasm waning, Lenau poured his anger into letters to friends back home which were later published in a book and also inspired a bestselling 1855 novel by the Austrian Ferdinand Kurnberger. It depicts the travels in America of a gradually disillusioned German poet who finds people there to be egotistical, materialistic, vulgar, and immature braggarts who lack civilization, religion, freedom or equality.\n\nLenau attributed much of his growing dislike for America to the inferiority of nature there. The idea of degeneration, he concluded, was literally true and he claimed to see it in the moral and mental decline of German immigrants who had lost their energy and even sanity. How could such a fate be avoided in a benighted land where nature “has no feelings or imagination” being itself so monotonous that it destroyed the personalities of those dwelling there.\n\nThe absence of songbirds was for Lenau a symbol of this spiritual poverty. Lenau had captured birds in Europe and kept them as pets. But in America, he wrote his brother-in-law, “There are no nightingales, indeed there are no real songbirds at all.” He also could not find, “A courageous dog, a fiery horse, or a man full of passion. Nature is terribly languid….”\n\nThis and other themes of Lenau would become staples for the critique of America in later eras. “These Americans,” he wrote, “are shopkeepers with souls that stink towards heaven. They are dead for all spiritual life, completely dead. The nightingale is right when he does not want to come to these louts.”\n\nSounding like many European leftists and rightists of later generations, Lenau found America to be hopelessly materialistic. Everything was based on the all-mighty dollar and the rational calculation of personal interest rather than some organic connection as in an antique and traditional society. “What we call Fatherland is here merely a property insurance scheme. The American knows nothing, he seeks nothing but money. He has no ideas” and so neither state nor society had any spiritual values.\n\nLenau returned to Europe “cured…of the chimera of freedom and independence that I had longed for with youthful enthusiasm.” The new world represented not liberty but alienation, power, numbers, and money.\n\nThere was, however, one terribly ironic detail of his life that Lenau kept from his readers. He had never intended to emigrate to America but merely went there to invest in property he could lease out. The critic who had castigated America for being in the toils of an avaricious materialism had gone there to cash in for himself.\n\nBut it is impossible to overestimate the impact in Europe of Lenau’s vision of America. The lack of nightingales became an international symbol of everything wrong with America. Already the British poet John Keats, who had never been in America and whose chronic illness and early death did not prove the superiority of European climes, had called America “that most hateful” and “monstrous” land because, the author of “Ode to a Nightingale,” complained, it had flowers without scent and birds without song. The 1843 lines of the German poet Hoffmann von Fallersleben also touched on the subject:\n\n”And so no grapes hang from your vine\n\nNor do your flowers have a scent,\n\nNo bird can even sing a line,\n\nAnd poetry its life is spent.”\n\nBut the problem was not just a natural one as,\n\nIt is a land with dreams deceptive filled\n\nO’er which the concept freedom, passing by,\n\nEnchanting, lets its shadows flutter down.”\n\nIt is striking that such criticism came from Fallersleben, an outspoken political liberal who supported the growing unrest in the various German lands and was eventually deported from Prussia. He had never visited America and knew it only second-hand through friends who corresponded with German immigrants in Texas. He even wrote several songs honoring that state and, unlike Lenau’s approach, refused an offer of land if he emigrated there. But like other rebels and romantics of the day, Lenau dreamed of a very different sort of paradise from the American experiment.\n\nAlongside the new political and cultural complaints — which grew louder throughout the nineteenth century — the idea that the United States was a hopeless enterprise doomed by nature lived on, especially in France. Some French scientists continued to insist that the degeneracy theory was right and that Americans aged faster while horses, dogs, and bulls there showed less vigor and courage than in Europe.\n\nCriticism about America based on its environmental conditions, hinting of the degeneracy, survived well into the twentieth century. In 1929, the Frenchman Re´gis Michaud, who taught French literature for twelve years at U.S. universities and wrote a critical book on America, described, among many other vices, the United States as, “A geographic mass without harmony, a country of contrasts and disparities on a grade scale with a violent climate.”\n\nIn 1933, the French diplomat and poet Paul Claudel wrote in his journal, while serving in Washington, that the early American statesman Alexander Hamilton had admitted America’s inferior climate stopped dogs from barking. In fact, this was one of De Pauw’s claims that Hamilton had ridiculed. Shortly thereafter, the liberal British poet W.H. Auden bemoaned the excesses of America’s climate, including vast numbers of insects, snakes, and poison ivy. “The truth is,” he wrote, “Nature never intended human beings to live here and her hostility” forced its original inhabitants to a nomadic existence and continued to plague their successors.\n\nDuring anti-Americanism’s first epoch, the cause of that country’s inevitable failure was placed on the innately inferior nature of the land. After America’s independence, though, this blame was increasingly transferred to a degraded people who lived in a badly structured society. By the 1830s, fear grew in Europe that ideas embodied in the United States — republicanism, materialism, the leveling of classes, a rejection of aristocratic high culture — would spread back across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn the reactionary climate following the French revolution’s turn toward terror and dictatorship, Napoleon’s aggressive wars, and the challenge posed by democratic movements, the Old World’s existing system seemed far more welcome to much of the political and intellectual elite there.\n\nIt was thought better by those in the most privileged groups to stick with the status quo of monarchy, high culture, a strong class system, traditional economy, and aristocratic-dominated politics than to make risky changes which threatened their interests and were obviously not going to work. Ironically, many of the anti-democratic ideas developed by the European right at this time would later become staples of the leftist critique of America.\n\nOf course, all peoples like to see their innate superiority asserted and “proven.” Americans themselves would certainly be no exception to this rule. Yet once the United States was established as a self-styled challenge to the European monarchies, anti-Americanism came to serve a specific political function. While anti-Americanism still incorporated aspects of the degeneracy theory, it increasingly focused on the claim that the American democratic experiment was a failure leading to a degraded society and culture. As degeneracy theory declined throughout the nineteenth century, in the new version of anti-Americanism the Americans were still judged uncivilized and degenerate. But now they had no one to blame but themselves for this sorry state of affairs.\n\nAmerica:The Distasteful Republic\n\nThe United States was a revolutionary experiment, a new type of country without a monarch, aristocracy, strong traditions, official religion, or rigid class system. As the British journalist Henry Fairlie later wrote of this era, “One thing was agreed. For good or ill, America was the omen of something new that was happening in the world.” If the United States succeeded in proving itself a better way of organizing a society the status quo in every other every existing polity would be questioned and might well be jeopardized.\n\nIn the American republic’s early years, this potential threat was handled largely through ridicule. By portraying America as an obvious and inevitable failure European critics hoped that no one would follow its example and thus the danger would be averted.\n\nThe idea that civilization could never arise in America, the degeneracy theory, had been the first stage of anti-Americanism. The second stage was the claim that the Americans’ efforts to create one had failed. This view generally dominated the anti-American critique in the years between the creation of the U.S. system in 1783 until roughly the end of the Civil War in 1865.\n\nOf course, some Europeans did think that the United States was offering a vision of something new and fresh they wanted for their own countries. The popular German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, for example, penned an ode to the United States embodying that view:\n\nAmerica, thy happy lot\n\nabove old Europe’s I exalt:\n\nThough hast no castle ruin hoar\n\nNo giant columns of basalt.\n\nThy soul is not troubled\n\nIn living light of day\n\nBy useless traditions,\n\nvain strife and array.\n\nWith reform and revolution-minded Europeans being inspired by the American precedent, their political adversaries had all the more reason to despise and discredit it. Nineteenth-century history proved just how subversive was the American example, the appeal of its ideas and institutions. Following the establishment of the United States, a series of struggles convulsed Europe which included the French revolution, rise of a British reform movement, continent-wide upheavals in 1848, and many more skirmishes in the conflict between aristocratic and democratic rule.\n\nWhile the United States did not directly sponsor foreign democratic movements, its revolution was as inspirational for the nineteenth century as the USSR’s Communist revolution was for the twentieth: the resulting political system was an alternative to all existing societies which entranced some, repelled others, and could be ignored by no one.\n\nThe founders and early leaders of the United States were aware of their unique role as a democratic revolution confronting countries with a different system. “The Royalists everywhere detest and despise us as Republicans,” wrote John Quincy Adams shortly after the triumph of European reaction at the 1815 Congress of Vienna. America’s political principles “make the throne of every European monarch rock under him as with the throes of an earthquake.” America’s growth and prosperity would naturally arouse jealousy and antagonism abroad because if its role as an alternative model.\n\nIn a July 4, 1821 speech in Washington before an audience including the European diplomatic corps, then President John Quincy Adams explained that America represented a new type of government, “Destined to cover the surface of the globe. It demolished at a stroke the lawfulness of all governments founded upon conquest. It swept away all the rubbish of accumulated centuries of servitude.”\n\nFor those viewing the United States as a threat to all existing Western civilization, destructive of order and an enemy of traditional values, discrediting it became a matter of life and death. Such was literally the case for Simon Linguet, a French lawyer, who warned in the 1780s that a rabble of adventurers would use the continent’s rich resources to make the United States a great economic power. Eventually, he predicted, America’s armies would cross the Atlantic, subjugate Europe, and destroy civilization. Linguet did not have to wait long to see the society he revered destroyed by new ideas paralleling those in America. He was guillotined by the French revolution in 1794.\n\nIn Britain, for the majority of the upper class seeking to limit democracy, the French revolution’s terror and disorder confirmed their fear that the kind of liberty and equality existing in America was dangerous. “Britain …has naught to learn from the present state of American democracy,” wrote a clergyman named George Lewis in 1845 after spending several years in America, “except to thank God for the more compact and secure fabric of British freedom.”\n\nMost Europeans visiting America to write about it — as opposed to those who went there as immigrants — were wealthy, conservative, and not predisposed to sympathy with the new country. Only the rich could afford the cost and time required for such a voyage. Most of them were repelled by that nation’s basic precepts, democratic political institutions, and primitive cultural level.\n\nYet even when accurately noting the new country’s problems, critics often wrongly insisted that these faults were innate in the American system rather than correctable over time. Of course, America was still very much a society in development but many of its symptoms were those of youth which experience and experiment would correct. Yet, at the same time, it was also true that there was a spirit of America different from that of Europe. Many of the characteristics Europeans disliked — like classlessness, secularism, and informality — derived from broader trends of modernity which — though few realized it in the early nineteenth-century — would come to characterize Western society in general.\n\nEqually, the emerging American society was the global prophet of a pragmatic world view not to European taste, especially outside of Britain. This notion, so thoroughly integrated into their life and culture as to be taken for granted by Americans, can simply be described as judging any system, institution, or idea on how well it works in practice and a readiness to discard whatever fails that test. In contrast, European civilization up to that time — and to a large extent since then–judged everything on how well it accorded to past practices. Change was viewed as dangerous and destabilizing; the benefit of the doubt rested with the status quo. Innovations were often judged not on their own merit but rather on whether they fit with some pre-existing doctrine or theory of how things should work.\n\nObviously, a pragmatic approach can mean jettisoning much that is good. Anti-Americans saw it as a general assault on tradition, high cultural standards, intellectual life, and all the good things of the past they cherished. They were blind to the benefits of that powerful American optimism and readiness for change which kept the door open to beneficial innovations while facilitating the correction of faults. Moreover, pragmatism was the basis for modernization and for challenging all the past’s bad, non-functional aspects. Pragmatism was America’s great philosophical and practical innovation. All the specific aspects of its model — equality, free enterprise, democracy, human rights, industrialization, and so on — related to this world view.\n\nWhile all the negative claims about America did not discourage many thousands of immigrants from going to America, they certainly shaped the views of future Europeans, those left behind who had never been there. It often seems, too, as if Europe’s rejection of many factors at the root of future American success were reasons why it would fall behind in many arenas. Indeed, it was a mistake for the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer to couple in his condemnation of America “the most vile [pragmatism] combined with its inevitable companion, ignorance.” Ultimately, it was precisely American practicality that inspired battles against ignorance.\n\nOne of the most disconcerting notions emerging from the U.S. system was the advocacy of equality, not as some abstract ideal but as a reality of daily life. The assumption was that the best way to maximize human potential was to give the largest number of people the best possible chance of contributing to society. And if this goal was far from fully realized at the start of the United States, it was a society which continued to evolve toward implementing that principle.\n\nOf course, people did not remain equal in practice. Some factor would determine the rise and fall of individuals’ status. The nineteenth-century American measure of success, still a key theme today despite many changes in emphasis, was that worldly achievement would be largely the result of ability and hard work. This was a reaction against a Europe which Americans saw as bound by an aristocratic system that rewarded people simply for the good fortune of their birth. In contrast, most Europeans argued that by giving primacy to those who were literally noble, their system set a high standard of manners and culture. Underneath its democratic facade, they saw America as simply giving first place to those who attained wealth.\n\nThough surface aspects of these arguments would shift over two centuries, as Europe in some ways came to resemble America more closely, the essential difference between the viewpoints would remain. Europe would see itself as the repository of a high quality culture, spiritual values, and intellectual merit. In contrast, the idea of America was as a society in which an unbridled capitalism determined everything on the basis of profit and market rather than quality, ideas, or values. And if their own societies were moving in this wrong direction — in Europe and elsewhere — the blame was often put on the local imitation or external influence of America.\n\nWhile many of these ideas developed among European conservatives in the early nineteenth century, the seeds of the left’s parallel critique could already be seen in the European romantic movement’s anti-Americanism. A country extolling materialistic pragmatism did not appeal to those extolling the transcendental glory of an organic society based on a comprehensive theory. America, then, was equally distasteful to the aristocrat who revered the European status quo and to the romantic rebel who hoped for spiritual transcendence, just as their right- and left-wing descendants would often agree only on the idea that America was not what they wanted.\n\nAs a result of their personal predilections, then, European critics often ignored the new society’s practical accomplishments and reduced the United States to a country which merely permitted, and encouraged, money-making as its ideal. To make matters worse, European intellectuals and artists could never forgive the United States for denying their class the exalted or central role which they claimed to hold in Europe.\n\nSuch achievements as freedom from the restraints of Europe’s class order, human rights, or the chance for individual betterment were discounted as dangerous illusions by the European critics. The United States was portrayed as merely an artificial creation with no animating spirit. As the Norwegian-born scientist and poet Henrik Steffens put it, America was “a classical statue, cold, motionless, it did not raise its eyes nor move its limbs and there was no living heart beating in its breast.” Its freedom was actually an insidious form of slavery. Steffens mixed his science with romantic philosophy, viewing the spread of civilization and society as leading to ever greater individualization. Like others, he found America to be dominated by conformity and the enslavement of individuals to material goods. Steffens found America to be especially repugnant since, like others who would become harsh critics, he thought it contradicted his cherished theory.\n\nThe argument that the United States was soulless gained a virtual consensus among European critics. Americans, wrote the French novelist Marie-Henri Beyle, best known as Stendhal, “seem to have done away with a part of themselves. The wells of feeling appear to have dried up; they are just, they have common sense and they are unhappy.” The French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, who visited the United States in the 1790s, determined that “The American people are perhaps the people least acquainted with passion in the whole world.” Victor Jacquemont, a friend of Lafayette and a naturalist, concluded after one night in New York in 1827 that the minds of Americans were “generally merely cold, platitudinous and vulgar.” The German poet Heine echoed this theme a few years later in explaining that Americans were incapable of civilization because they “had no passion, hardly speak at all, never caress one another, care about nothing, and are lazy.”\n\nEven as the United States was being disrespected precisely in order to undercut its real and potential influence on Europe, its ingenious political structures and remarkably original revolution were being denied. When Europeans spoke of great revolutions, either to exalt or decry them, the French and not the American model was the standard for judgment.\n\nFor conservatives, the horrors of the French revolution and the failed republic that followed showed the dangers of such experiments, a category in which they included the United States. They shuddered at its example which gave them added incentive to find the American version a failure as well, one more proof that democracy didn’t work or at best produced a dreadful society.\n\nFor romantics as well as the political radicals who were starting to preach the revolutionary transformation of their own societies, the fact that the French revolution had brought disaster to its own people and the continent — with its reign of terror, quick reversion to dictatorship, imperialist ambitions, and endless wars — was no proof that the American version was superior. For them the American counterpart was too bland, bourgeois, and boring, insufficiently utopian or theoretical. In fact, before King Louis XVI was beheaded by them, some French radicals proposed it to be a sufficiently cruel punishment to exile him to Philadelphia, then the capital of American society and culture, anticipating by 150 years the comedian W.C. Fields famous joke that being in that city was preferable only to death.\n\nBoth sides often missed the point, viewing as shortcomings precisely the factors that made America succeed. Thus, in 1823, Hulsemann denounced the country’s “incoherence” in such institutions as the “separation of powers which, as well-known, is a theoretical error.” The word “theoretical” here is most significant. The great breakthrough of Franklin, Jefferson, James Madison, and their colleagues in devising a new and workable system of government based on federalism (a division of authority between central and state governments) and checks and balances (a division of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government) were of no importance.\n\nYet it was precisely this structure that was the centerpiece of the system’s success. Gradually, European systems would move closer to an American-style model. But in the nineteenth century, and sometimes afterward, the European left and right often extolled a centralization of power that would constantly produce failed regimes and repressive dictatorships, in France, the USSR, and throughout the Third World. Ridiculed as purely practical, America was thought incapable of producing any valid political philosophy. The fact that its system worked so well in practice was thus irrelevant. The lack of guillotines and the absence of any decline into dictatorship were not counted to its credit.\n\nNot everyone in Europe mocked the American system but a remarkable number of people did so, including the leading philosophers and historians of the day. Often targeted for ridicule was the notion of giving the common people a voice in governing was an idea that could ever work. It was, as one French observer, Abbé Mably, wrote in his book about the government and laws of the United States in 1784, dangerous and impractical, especially because as common people went, those of the United States were particularly unimpressive.\n\nIn the words of François Soules’ 1787 history of the American revolution, “In America the wise are few indeed in comparison with the ignorant, the selfish, and those men who blindly allow themselves led.” American-style democracy was a step backward, wrote the romantic poet Heine in 1830, into a “monstrous prison of freedom” whose “invisible chains” were more oppressive than the visible ones in Germany. For in the United States, “the most repulsive of all tyrants, the populace, hold vulgar sway.” Louis Marie Turreau de Linières, former French ambassador to the United States, agreed that it was “a fraud” to let common Americans influence public affairs since they were incapable of reasoning. The Bill of Rights would cause anarchy because it would paralyze government from acting effectively.\n\nThus, the French novelist Stendhal, writing in 1830, concluded that American-style democracy was boring and banal because it let “the tyranny of opinion” of the small-minded masses control society. Another French writer, Felix de Beaujour, consul-general in Washington from 1804 to 1811, was so critical of the United States that the British used his book as anti-American propaganda during the War of 1812, when they again fought the Americans. Beaujour explained that unless the Senate was elected for life and the House of Representatives limited to big landowners, the U.S. government would collapse in despotism or disunion.\n\nAn economy that bred rampant materialism was seen as the counterpart of a spiritually empty society and an unworkable political system. The country’s obsession with greed combined with mob rule, Beaujour wrote, ensured that American civilization would be “ugly and vulgar, with unpolished manners, indelicate feelings, primitive social life, and conversation entirely centered on money.” In 1783, the German historian A.L. von Schlozer wrote that as a “commercial country” the United States had replaced monarch and aristocracy with “the nobility of money, which is far more dangerous and tyrannical….” The revolutionary German dramatist Karl Gutzkow expressed the same idea in the mid-nineteenth century: “It is unbelievable how easy the American can change ideas into money.”\n\nThis was a consensus view among much of the European elite and intelligentsia. Heine concluded, “Worldly utility is their true religion and money is their God, their once all-powerful God,” The stereotype of the grasping Yankee, who lived only to work and profit while neglecting all spiritual or cultural values, would remain unchanged over the decades.\n\nAs scores of European writers purveyed this image it entered the world of fiction and in many forms passed down to the following generations. In the mid 19th century, several German novels focused on the unfortunate experiences of immigrants to American that focused on the violence, theft, and fraud practiced on newcomers as well as American arrogance and greed. Some authors openly said their purpose for writing such things was to stop emigration to the United States.\n\nFor example, in his 1841 German novel, Friedrich Rulemann Eylert writes of the unhappy experiences of a German immigrant who discovers, “Degraded thinking, lying, deception, and unlimited greed are the natural and inescapable consequences of the commercial spirit…that like a tidal wave inundates the highest and lowest elements of American society. Every harmless passion and all moral sentiments are blunted in the daily pursuit of money.”\n\nThis theme is illustrated by incidents which one imagines might easily have taken place in Germany. The hero breaks an oil lamp at a hotel and is sent to jail when he cannot pay for the damage. The hotelkeeper bribes his lawyer so the poor man is sentenced to be a servant at the inn and has to work long hours. A fellow immigrant tells him the secret of success in America: work hard and deny oneself all pleasure, which the author called, “The best and truest description of the whole American character” and quite different from the German spirit.\n\nFerdinand Kurnberger, in his very popular 1855 tale of a similarly disillusioned German immigrant, agrees that American culture is impoverished. Newsboys sell smutty literature and a “Negro band” plays so badly that the German has to correct them. A student tells him, quoting Franklin that “time is money” — a concept particularly repugnant to the author — and that man’s purpose on earth is to produce wealth. A boarding house owner’s dilution of his champagne with brandy is a symbol of decadence. In an art gallery, puritanical Americans put clothes on Greek statues. A German immigrant who tries to spread culture in America is hung. The hero remarks, “All man are equal. Does that mean all hogs are equal? What a sham this culture is.”\n\nThe basic cultural critique of America prevalent in twentieth and twenty-first century Europe was already in place by the 1830s, long before the onset of mass production, consumerism, Hollywood, or television. Materialism plus democracy made for a spiritual emptiness. The United States was a mass culture based on the lowest common denominator. Instead of standards being set by an aristocratic and privileged class of intellectuals and artists, its society catered to the vulgar mob with low values, bad manners and a grubby materialistic outlook.\n\nPerrin Du Lac, who visited the American frontier in the first years of the nineteenth century, turned an equally memorable phrase about how materialism destroyed any cultural or spiritual values: “A brook, were it worthy of the muse of Virgil…is nothing to them but so much pure water, so of no value.” In general, Americans only cared for material things, “A good Havana cigar, a newspaper, and a bottle of Madeira — those are the joys of an American life.” Yet those who extolled the virtues of material deprivation for the masses’ spiritual welfare rarely themselves shared in this supposedly beneficial lifestyle.\n\nNothing reveals the universality of this view of American materialism more than the fact that it was echoed by even one of the greatest European defender of the United States, the French nobleman Alexis de Tocqueville. Americans, he explained, were so insensible to the wonders of nature that they only “perceive the mighty forests that surround them [when] they fall beneath the hatchet.” In sum, he concluded, “Nothing conceivable is so petty, so insipid, so crowded with paltry interests–in one word, anti-poetic–as the life of a man in the United States.”\n\nThe story behind Tocqueville’s trip to the United States gives important clues to the disdainful conclusions of so many European visitors. When Tocqueville wrote about America, he was heavily influenced by the current situation and recent experiences of his own country. In the 1830s, no place in the world had suffered more from the excesses of democracy. France’s own revolution had been followed by a quarter-century of turmoil ending in a devastating national defeat with Napoleon’s fall in 1815.\n\nTocqueville decided to make his famous visit to America when the conservative Bourbon monarchy he served was overthrown in 1830 by a regime oriented toward middle class demands. This was precisely the kind of regime which anti-Americans identified negatively with the United States. Unhappy with the transition, Tocqueville looked for a way to get out of Paris for a while, nominally to study the American prison system for the French Ministry of Justice. Instead, he produced his two-volume Democracy in America, published in 1834 and 1840.\n\nWhile Tocqueville’s praise of the United States is well-known to Americans, rarely noted is the fact that he shared most of the contemporary European criticisms of its state and society. He wrote:\n\n“Unlimited power is in itself a bad and dangerous thing. Human beings are not competent to exercise with discretion….The main evil of the present democratic institutions of the United States does not arise, as it is often asserted in Europe, from their weakness, but from their irresistible strength. I am not so much alarmed at the excessive liberty which reigns in that country as at…the inadequate securities which one find there against tyranny.”\n\nYet Tocqueville’s words seem to relate more to the French revolution’s reign of terror, the guillotine, and Napoleon than to the rule of Washington, Jefferson and Madison. But what the author has in mind is not so much dictatorship from above but tyranny arising from below, by public opinion and such institutions as elected legislatures or juries drawn from common citizens. America’s rulers, he complains, are only passive tools of the masses. Writing at a time when autocracy was ascendant in much of Europe, with rampant censorship and repression, he concludes, “I know of no country in which there is so little independence of mind and real freedom of discussion.” So great is this majority tyranny that “freedom of opinion does not exist in America.” The power of the majority “is so absolute and so irresistible” that dissent from it would bring ruin. Thus, no one dares to voice his own view.\n\nHe writes that in the United States, “The power of the majority [far] surpasses all the powers with which we are acquainted in Europe.” In Europe, opposition views circulate in secret. But in America, he explains, discussion is open only until the majority decides and once that happens, “Everyone is silent, and the friends as well as the opponents of the measure unite in assenting to its propriety.” This type of repression explains why America stifles literary genius. In effect, he makes the United States sound as if it practices the “democratic centralism” which was later a principle of Communist parties in which discussion is only permitted before the party line is set..\n\nIn a remarkable passage, Tocqueville foresees the type of “repressive tolerance” critique that would characterize the European post-Marxist left’s critique of the United States. By instituting democracy and satisfying peoples’ needs, he seems to say, America has created a terrible society because it undermines the desire to revolt against it:\n\n“The Inquisition has never been able to prevent a vast number of anti-religious books from circulating in Spain. The empire of the majority succeeds much better in the United States, since it actually removes any wish to publish them. Unbelievers are to be met with in America, but there is no public organ of infidelity. Attempts have been made by some governments to protect morality by prohibiting licentious books. In the United States no one is punished for this sort of books, but no one is induced to write them; not because all the citizens are immaculate in conduct, but because the majority of the community is decent and orderly.”\n\nIf Tocqueville had been a romantic, he might have attributed this problem to the absence of spirit that would give rise to poetry and philosophy or at least have pointed to the weakness of an intellectual class in providing guidance and high culture. As a conservative, though, he concludes that the proper element missing in the society is the absence of guidance by an aristocratic class secure in its wealth and values.\n\nAs a result, Tocqueville is sure that pragmatism must lead to a mindless materialism. Americans, he writes, are tormented by a vague dread “lest they should not have chosen the shortest path which may lead to” their own welfare. The American “clings to his world’s goods as if he were certain never to die; and he is so hasty in grasping at all within his reach that one would suppose he was constantly afraid of not living long enough to enjoy them. He clutches everything, he holds nothing fast, but soon loosens his grasp to pursue fresh gratifications.”\n\nWhile Tocqueville was a better reporter of what he saw than most of the other visiting writers, he shared the agenda of most to prove beyond any doubt that democracy was a bad system which should not be imitated by France or Europe in general. Virtually identical sentiments also dominated the British elite’s perspective on the United States. It had watched with horror events in France and engaged in an all-out war to defeat the revolutionary regime there in addition to fighting two wars with the United States. Following the victory over Napoleon in 1815 came several decades of internal British struggles between reformers demanding more democracy and Tories fighting against change.\n\nBritish conservatives focused on the same points as their French counterparts but with their own national flavor. G.D, Warburton took a vacation to New England in 1844 and concluded, “The Constitution was the work of madmen and meant the reign of the “the oracle of the pot-house and the ignorant swine-herd of the backwoods.”\n\nOne simple factor among the British to believe the American experiment had to be flawed was the fact that the colonists had rebelled against the mother country and then established a very different kind of society. And anything different from Britain, in British eyes — or more broadly anything different from Europe in European eyes — had to be inferior. Edward Wakefield, an influential writer — one of his books was entitled the Art of Colonization–in the 1830s and 1840s saw the problem as a failure to transfer to America the British social structure. Unchecked access to the frontier had created people who were too isolated and independent, bereft of the beneficial presence of aristocrats and gentleman capitalists.\n\nHis critique of the Americans — whom he derided as a “new people”–encapsulated practically every contemporary critique of America and foreshadowed those that would last down the decades to our time. They increased in number but made “no progress in the art of living.” In terms of wealth, knowledge, skill, taste, and civilization in general they had “degenerated from their [British] ancestors.” They lacked education, moved around too much, did not acquire a great enough wealth to be an elite (except the slave owners), were too violent, vain, obstinate, intolerant, and aggressive. Their notion of equality was too extreme and against nature, favoring the vile over the noble. In short, they were “a people who become rotten before they are ripe.”\n\nIronically, Wakefield came from a radical Quaker family but as so often happened, anti-Americanism blended radicalism and conservativism. As one historian characterizes his thought, Wakefield viewed the proper colonial community as harkening “back to a legendary past, to the squire surrounded by his contented, cap-tipping yokels, in the good old days before industrialism and new ideas had upset the rural harmony.”\n\nEqually blunt was Frederick Marryat who was a government official, as well as a former naval officer and author of popular sea tales. Marryat’s agenda was to prove democracy dangerous, or at least what he considered to be the excessive democracy ruining the United States.\n\nBoth Tocqueville and Marryat made their visits at a time when populism was at one of its highest points in U.S. history. The defeat of the austere President John Quincy Adams, about the closest thing to an American aristocrat, by Andrew Jackson in 1828 ushered in a period in which frontier regions held more influence and American culture became self-consciously more mass-oriented. It was an era certain to feed Europeans’ worst fears, though they might well have reached the same conclusions anyway.\n\nAt the age of forty-five, in 1837, Marryat made a grand tour of America and produced a popular book about his travels. He concluded, “With all its imperfections, democracy is the form of government best suited to the present condition of America.” Given Marryat’s views, this was apparently not intended as a compliment.\n\nCompared to Tocqueville’s literary elegance, however, Marryat was quite blunt. Political equality, he wrote, made “the scum… uppermost, and they do not see below it. The prudent, the enlightened, the wise, and the good, have all retired into the shade, preferring to pass a life of quiet retirement, rather than submit to the insolence and dictation of a mob.”\n\nHe concluded that the United States “has proven to the world that, with every advantage on her side, the attempt at a republic has been a miserable failure and that the time is not yet come when mankind can govern themselves. Will it ever come? In my opinion, never.” He added, “No people have as yet been sufficiently enlightened to govern themselves.”\n\nMarryat’s political prejudices were reinforced by events In 1837, a rebellion against British rule broke out in Canada and Americans sympathized with it. The media whipped up anti-British sentiment and the U.S. government let anti-British insurgents operate from American territory in New York state until a group of British loyalists crossed the border and destroyed their base. Marryat, at that moment visiting Toronto, attended a dinner honoring the raiders and toasted them. When news of this behavior reached the United States, he was denounced in the press and burned in effigy.\n\nAs one might expect, this did not make Marryat fond of the American press, which he considered “licentious to the highest possible degree.” As a result, he wrote, mutual defamation was a pervasive disease in America and everyone was “suspicious and cautious of his neighbor.” The real cause of this internecine warfare was each citizen’s relentless effort to maintain equality by pulling everyone down to his own level.\n\nYet this kind of rot was said to pervade all aspects of American life. Giving the common people education, for example, and teaching them to read and write merely corrupted “those who might have been more virtuous and happy in their ignorance” Parents, Marryat wrote. did not control their children, who learned only what they wanted from a school curriculum that was largely republican propaganda teaching students to hate monarchies and glorify revolution. At any rate, the schooling for the elite was inferior to Europe’s and there were few who could be called “a very highly educated man.”\n\nMost European observers agreed with Marryat’s conclusion that, at best, American society was “a chaotic mass” with little that was “valuable or interesting.” Jacquemont’s assessment of Americans was: “Disgusting, disgusting! It is shameful to speak of them: these animals are below criticism….No population is as anti-picturesque….[The United States is a] free and boring country.”\n\nIt was hardly surprising, then, that Europeans thought that bad taste was king in America. Du Lac reported that liberalism was the enemy of politeness, for if everyone was equal no one would give deference to others. On the contrary, they would be obnoxious in asserting their rights. In theatres, men kept their hats on, smoked smelly cigars and did not give up their seats to ladies who, for their part, were pretty enough at first but lost their teeth by the age of 18, their looks by age 20, and were constantly wiping their noses\n\nTalleyrand spoke of Americans as clumsy parvenus who wore hats “that a European peasant would not be caught dead in.” Unsurprisingly, the Frenchman found the cuisine dreadful. It was a country of “32 religions and only one dish…and even that [is] inedible.”\n\nYet while America was seen as banal, passionless, and ruled by conformity, it was simultaneously — and not without reason — portrayed as an extraordinarily hot-headed and violent place. Before the cowboys existed as a stereotype, Americans were compared to the “Indians” in this respect. By 1785 a British dictionary was defining the word “gouge” as “to squeeze out a man’s eye with the thumb, a cruel practice used by the Bostonians in America.” Certainly, there was great lawlessness, especially on the frontier. European visitors were able to catalogue a wide variety of murders, shootings, knifings, duels, and lynching. This problem, too, was ascribed to democracy. In Marryat’s words, “Dueling always has been and always will be, one of the evils of democracy.” This was a strange distortion since that practice had long been a mainstay of European aristocrats. Still, the idea of Americans as excessively and irrationally violent, people would become another of the enduring European stereotypes.\n\nAs the first half of the nineteenth century went by, British visitors became more outspokenly critical of slavery. But the personal habit that seemed to symbolize everything Europeans disliked about America was tobacco-chewing. Alexander Mackay, a British journalist who wrote a travel book in 1849, described a veritable flood of tobacco juice squirting throughout railroad cars. Passengers spit between Mackay’s feet and over his shoulders. One even took a piece from his mouth and drew pictures on a window with it.\n\nThe German poet Heine, who never visited the United States, wrote a poem about this vice in 1851:\n\n“I have sometimes thought to sail\n\nTo America the free\n\nTo that Freedom Stable where\n\nAll the boors live equally.\n\nBut I fear a land where men\n\nChew tobacco in platoons,\n\nThere’s no king among the pins,\n\nAnd they spit without spittoons.\n\n“I hardly know of any annoyance so deeply repugnant to English feelings, as the incessant remorseless spitting of Americans,” said Frances Trollope, who added that this habit had made the lips of male Americans “almost uniformly thin and compressed.”\n\nTrollope might have been the single most influential person shaping European perceptions of America in the first half of the nineteenth-century. Her book Domestic Manners of the Americans, published in 1832, enjoyed a phenomenal success and was translated into several languages. Within a few years, people were speaking of “to trollopise,” meaning to criticize the Americans. To sit “legs a la trollope” referred to that rude allegedly American habit of putting one’s feet on the table and slouching back in a chair.\n\nSo much did she dislike the United States that the experience of visiting there transformed her from an optimistic liberal advocate for democracy to a reactionary opponent of change. A summary of her impressions may be gleaned by her conclusion that the main reason to visit America is “that we shall feel the more contented with our own country.” In retaliation, on display in New York was set up a waxwork of the author in the shape of a goblin.\n\nTrollope never set out to play such a historic role. In 1827 she arrived in Cincinnati with three small children, sent by her eccentric husband to open a department store there. The store went bankrupt and Trollope was stranded with her ill offspring. Desperate for money, she hit on the novel idea of writing a best-seller. Americans criticized her book but bought it any way. Even British liberals condemned it as an exaggerated indictment. Still, it proved a most persuasive one.\n\nThe focus of her attack was America’s ascetic and cultural failing. Like other Europeans before her, she disliked American nature and people for being too wild compared to the highly domesticated ideal expressed in the British garden. This simile was extended to American behavior which she saw as equally untamed. Asked the greatest difference between England and the United States, Trollope pointed to the latter’s “want of refinement.” No one had an interest in high culture. In America, she explained, “that polish which removes the coarser and rougher parts of our nature is unknown and undreamed of.”\n\nPeople ate too fast, had bad table manners, spoke poor English, talked too much about politics and religion (subjects not appropriate for public conversation), and rode roughshod over personal privacy. American gregariousness grated on British sensibilities. When she wanted to take her meals at a Memphis hotel in a private room rather than with the rest of the guests, the landlady became angry. In Cincinnati, a hotelkeeper demanded that she drink her tea with the other guests or leave. People tried to engage her in conversation when she wanted to be alone. She even complained that Americans, at least white ones, could not sing a song in tune. Women walked badly and their clothes, except in Philadelphia, were in terrible taste.\n\nIn this vein, a leading British journalist, G.S. Venables wrote in November 1866: “Perhaps an American England may produce a higher average of happiness than the existing system, but it would not be a country for a gentleman, and I for one would be quite a stranger in it.” The essayist Matthew Arnold pointed out that in Europe one was assigned a place in society at birth while in the United States one must create it. For those already at the top of society — in terms of privilege, power, or prestige — this was a frightening thought.\n\nAlways, the subtext was the ruinous nature of the American belief in equality, ranging from the low character of American political leaders to the difficulty of finding proper servants among such people. Indeed, Trollope wrote, “If refinement once creeps in among them, if they once learn to cling to the graces, the honors, the chivalry of life, then we shall say farewell to American equality, and welcome to European fellowship one of the finest countries on earth.”\n\nThis was a remarkable revelation of a major anti-American theme. Any positive effect of equality was more than cancelled out by the fact that it would undermine the social position of those shaping Europe’s interpretation of America. The success of America and its imitation by their own countries would undermine — or at least they thought it would — their personal interests. In short, anti-Americanism was a class interest, not of the masses — who were the ones most likely to emigrate — but of the elite.\n\nAnother negative consequence of America’s emphasis on freedom and equality was said to be an excessively elevated status for women and children. This criticism was also intended to prove that the United States had rejected the natural order of society. Schopenhauer’s list of American sins included a “foolish adoration of women.” Like others, the Frenchmen Mederic Louis Elie Moreau Saint-Mery, a Frenchman who owned a bookstore in Philadelphia in the 1790s, claimed that American women soon lost their beauty (due to the terrible climate) and never found good taste. He also thought their breasts excessively small. But most importantly, he and other Europeans thought they were not well-behaved, obedient, or affectionate.\n\nAmerica was sarcastically nicknamed in some European writings as a “paradise for women.” In a classical statement of the German writer F.R. Eylert:\n\n“Woman! Do you want to see yourself restored to your aboriginal place of honor with your husband in the house as your slave and at your side in society? Do you want him to dance to your tune and early in the morning rush to buy meat, butter, vegetables and eggs, while you lie comfortably in bed and devote yourself to sweet morning dreams?…If you want to experience the full blessings of a pampered existence, then go to America, become naturalized, purchase an American husband, and you are emancipated….\n\nThe underlying problem in this allegedly exalted status was that equality had gone too far, even in an age when no woman could vote. A working-class Scotsman, James D. Burns, who visited the United States during the Civil War, in his book about the experience recorded, “In America, female notions of equality and personal independence have to a great extent reversed the old order of things in the relation of the sexes….The woman has made up her mind not to be bossed by her husband, which means she will do as she likes irrespective of his will….” This damaged marriage and led to more frequent divorces.\n\nA German contemporary wrote of the “typical” American woman: “She always carried books, brochures, and newspapers on her memorandum book and pencil, with which to copy down fragments from books and conversations. Full of claims to nobility, she nevertheless played the part of an avowed republican. She combined information with misinformation, common sense with transcendental nonsense…one of those educated women who because of pretensions to equality with men have lost all the charm and advantages of their sex.”\n\nAlready, when Hollywood was still a howling wilderness, Americans were also said to be juvenile and obsessed with being youthful. The United States, as an immature society rejecting tradition, was a veritable never-land of Peter Pans determined to stay young forever. “In America,” said one wit, “the young are always ready to give to those who are older than themselves the full benefits of their inexperience.” This was precisely what Europeans accused America of trying to do to them. As always, Oscar Wilde put it best and briefest: “The youth of America is their oldest tradition. It has been going on now for 300 years.”\n\nGiven the exalted status of children attributed to American society, one could hardly blame Americans for wanting to stay young. According to James F. Muirhead, a British editor of guidebooks to the United States, children there, “Learn to throw off the restraints of parental authority” since they feel, according to the national credo they are “equal to everyone.” I do not know of any task more difficult than for a father to keep his children well in hand.”\n\nMuirhead added:\n\n“Nowhere is the child so constantly in evidence; nowhere are his wishes so carefully consulted; nowhere is he allowed to make his mark so strongly on society in general….The small American…interrupts the conversation of his elders, he has a voice in every matter, he eats and drinks what seems good to him, he (or at any rate she) wears finger-rings of price, he has no shyness or even modesty.”\n\nAnthony Trollope, who as an adult wrote a book about the place where he spent time as a child with his mother, Frances Trollope, thought American babies, “Eat and drink just as they please; they are never punished; they are never banished, snubbed and kept in the background as children are kept with us, and yet they are wretched and uncomfortable….Can it be, I wonder, that the children are happier when they are made to obey orders.” While Marryat insisted “there is little or no parental control,” adding:\n\nImagine a child of three years old in England behaving thus:\n\n`Johnny, my dear, come here,” says his mama\n\n`I won’t,’ cries Johnny.\n\n`You must, my love, you are all wet, and you’ll catch cold.’\n\n`I won’t,’ replies Johnny.” And so forth.\n\n`A sturdy republican, sir,’ says his father to me, smiling at the boy’s resolute disobedience.\n\nGiven the fact that everyone in America was criticized for their spirit of equality, it is not surprising that later criticism would often come down to sneering at an insufficient elitism, an excessive emphasis on the lower common denominator, in the United States. Even when those complaints came from leftist intellectuals who claimed to revere equality, the old aristocratic disdain for the masses was often barely concealed beneath the supposed love of all humanity. Naturally, the peasants and workers who flocked from Europe to America as immigrants did not share this attitude.\n\nMoreover, the European visitors’ view that materialism and democracy blocked the creation of a serious culture in the United States was already being disproven. Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, James Fenimore Cooper, Edgar Alan Poe, the Hudson River school of painting, and many others were doing important and original work. As in politics, a viable mass-oriented alternative to Europe’s official aristocratic culture was possible.\n\nEven the kindly British novelist Charles Dickens, least snobbish of his nation and defender of the downtrodden in his great novels, could not quite shake himself loose from European disdain. Dickens had some positive things to say about the United States in a book about his 1842 journey there, finding Americans “by nature, frank, brave, cordial, hospitable and affectionate,” He also had good personal reasons for turning against America after being cheated by speculators in a canal company fraud and publishers who stole his writings and never paid him royalties.\n\nNevertheless, his conclusion was that while the British suffer from being self-absorbed, inner-oriented characters, Americans are colorless because they are obsessed what their fellows think of them, a result of that dreaded equality which makes them want to be like everyone else. And at times even Dickens was overcome by the American disease which so often affected European travelers. Its main symptom was an angry feverish hatred which made otherwise sane people almost froth at the mouth.\n\nTraveling from Cincinnati downstream to Cairo, Illinois, he wrote of\n\n“The hateful Mississippi circling and eddying before it, and turning off upon its southern course a slimy monster hideous to behold; a hotbed of disease, an ugly sepulcher, a grave uncheered by any gleam of promise: a place without one single quality, in earth or air or water, to commend it: such is this dismal Cairo.”\n\nIronically, this was the very material that Mark Twain would render so unforgettably as a writer exemplifying a distinctly American world view. At any rate, in Dickens’ rendition, the United States was a land of sleazy business ethics, rampant lawlessness and violence, crass materialism, insufferable and undereducated boors, and gluttony. It is a list quite familiar a century later. Instead of an eagle as its national symbol, Dickens proposes choosing a more appropriate animal for America’s emblem: A bat “for its short-sightedness, [a rooster] for its bragging,” a magpie “for its [dis]honesty,” a peacock “for its vanity,” or an ostrich for its desire to avoid reality.\n\nDickens’ novel, Martin Chuzzlewit published in 1866 is certainly the funniest nineteenth-century anti-American satire. His poor hero, who makes the mistake of immigrating to America, suffers the entire repertoire of American ills, ranging from terrible climate to cultural barbarism to predatory swindlers who sell him land in a malaria-infested frontier town where he becomes seriously ill.\n\nWhen Martin is invited to dinner, he hears a bell “ringing violently” and is convinced the house is afire as a series of agitated gentlemen rush in. The alarm turns out to be only the dinner bell. American gluttony was a favorite theme of nineteenth-century European writers, perhaps because the average American ate far better than his European counterpart. In the dining room, he sees:\n\n“All the knives and forks were working away at a rate that was quite alarming; very few words were spoken; and everybody seemed to eat his utmost in self-defense, as if a famine were expected to set in before breakfast time tomorrow morning….”\n\nAnd when he finally returns home, according to one of the book’s running jokes, every time the word “America” is mentioned he becomes ill.\n\nObviously, the reactions to America of each country’s nationals reflected the priorities and problems of their native lands. The British put a little more emphasis on excessive equality, the French on intellectual and cultural poverty, and the Germans spoke much of spiritual barrenness. Yet all these themes are found in the ideas of each of them. It is telling, too, how much of this criticism came out of a combination of aristocratic and romantic spirit, of leftist and rightist ideas intertwined.\n\nBoth aristocrats and romantics, conservatives and radicals, looked down on a middle class republic that was certainly not their idea of utopia. Conservative Germans, who had a horror of republicanism, easily classified America as unpalatable. But so did German romantics who had an equal horror of materialism and the masses.\n\nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century, European anti-Americans concluded that the United States was to be ridiculed not feared. Its ludicrous political system was a clear failure and might well collapse of its own weight. If the United States posed any threat it arose from bad example rather than global ambitions. The word “model” sneeringly appeared most often in anti-American literature to discredit the idea that this country might provide an example to emulate. This concept would later be expressed as the rejection of “Americanization.”\n\nThe second stage of anti-Americanism was to insist that the United States was a failure. But contrary to these predictions of early nineteenth century anti-Americans — who would see the Civil War as the embodiment of this expectation–the United States did not collapse. On the contrary, it grew steadily stronger and more visibly successful. Only when the American experiment had clearly worked–around the 1880s, when American industrialization began to lead the world, or after 1898, when the U.S. victory over Spain made it an incipient world power–was it no longer possible to insist that it had failed. But the anti-Americans would find the threat of American success to be an even more serious matter. And this would lead to the third stage of anti-Americanism.\n\nThe Fear of an American Future\n\nBy the late nineteenth-century, America was emerging as a great industrial country. While it was still far behind Britain, France, or Germany in military might or political influence, far-sighted people were starting to see what would become so apparent later: the rise of the United States to global preeminence. It pioneered in the development of big industries and assembly-line methods. By 1924 it produced 38 percent of the world’s coal, 70 percent of petroleum, 38 percent of electric power, 54 percent of copper, 40 percent of lead, 33 percent of iron ore, 75 percent of corn, 25 percent of wheat, 30 percent of cereals other than wheat, 55 percent of cotton, 53 percent of timber, and 22 percent of tobacco.\n\nCulturally, America was becoming known as the land of jazz, movies, and advertising. It was becoming easier to speak of a distinctive American world view, style, and way of life. In some ways, the modernization of Europe seemed to parallel what already existed in America: more secular, democratic, urban, secular, faster-paced, mass-oriented, geographically mobile, classless, questioning of tradition, deifying change, and many other such characteristics.\n\nThis prospect, however, while embraced by many Europeans horrified others who identified it with, among other things, the influence of America’s baleful example. This reaction gave rise to the third era of anti-Americanism. “For some reason or other,” the American writer James Russell Lowell wrote in 1869, “the European has rarely been able to see America except in caricature.” Yet this caricature evolved over time. The idea that America was a failure, widely held in the first half of the nineteenth century, had proved wrong. Anti-Americans had discouraged taking that country as a role model by ridiculing it as politically unviable, culturally impoverished, and socially failed.\n\nNow, however, as the French economist Paul de Rousiers aptly wrote in 1892, “America ceased to be an object of curiosity to become an object of dread.” For if America was no longer a joke to be laughed at or an inferior to be sneered at, if it actually was going to be the prototype of their own future, the United States might really be a danger to the entire world/ If America was going to be a great power, it might impose itself on others. And if Europeans were persuaded to copy voluntarily its alleged spirit of relentless, soulless industrialization and modernization they too would sink into social, political and cultural barbarity.\n\nThus, in 1901, Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, a British writer, said in a letter from the United States to his friend, the novelist E. M. Forster: “The thing that rubbed into me in this country are 1) that the future of the world lies with America, and 2) that radically and essentially America is a barbarous country. The life of the spirit…is, not accidentally or temporarily, but inevitably and eternally killed in this country.”\n\nIronically, then, as the United States proved wrong its historic anti-American critics who said it could never succeed, this very success only inspired more anti-Americanism. One could well believe it was headed for world economic domination and that others must copy its methods or fall far behind. The anti-Americans believed that while the United States had became highly productive it had come at a significant cost to cultural and spiritual values. The cost of the enterprise seemed too high for these critics who felt that it had literally sold its soul to attain material riches..\n\nOne clear expression of this attitude came in 1926 from Johan Huizinga, the Dutch historian of the Middle Ages, a time European conservatives might find preferable to the new age. Huizinga wrote that his group of Europeans traveling together through America constantly felt, “We all have something that you lack; we admire your strength but we do not envy you. Your instrument of civilization and progress, your big cities and your perfect organization, only makes us nostalgic for what is old and quiet, and sometimes your life seems hardly to be worth living, not to speak of your future.”\n\nBut was it the future of only the United States itself that was at stake? Perhaps that country’s success would allow it to dominate the whole world. Or perhaps that same success would convince others to copy the American model. In his 1926 novel, The Plumed Serpent, the British novelist D.H. Lawrence records the thoughts of his protagonist Kate Leslie on encountering America: “Was it the great continent that destroyed again what the other continents had built up, the continent whose spirit of place fought purely to pick the eyes out of the face of God?” Was America the place “where the human will declares itself ‘free’ to pull down the soul of the world?” Was America merely a negation of all that existed, “the life-breath of materialism? And would the great negative pull of the Americans at last break the heart of the world?”\n\nThis was the fear in Europe. The United States would break the heart of the world by becoming the wellspring of a new and very destructive type of society in which everything was subjected to efficiency, organization, and material gain. This new theme of anti-Americanism began to be apparent during the Civil War. The British and French governments were hostile to the Union partly because they saw it as the embodiment of America’s terrible society as opposed to the more “European-style” agricultural and aristocratic South. The French government was on the verge of recognizing and aiding the Confederacy as an independent country. Despite its own anti-slavery policy, the British government only awaited a decisive Confederate victory to provide an occasion for doing the same thing.\n\nIronically, the widespread sympathy for the Confederacy in England and France also rested on the fact that a Southern victory would restart the flow of cotton to their textile mills. Thus, on the one hand, the Europeans opposed the Union as a competing industrial power while, on the other hand, in anti-American terms, they condemned it as inferior to themselves because it was an industrial society.\n\nMany Europeans, both conservatives and romantics, thus defended the Southerners as victims of Yankee imperialists who wanted to seize Southern wealth. The Europeans claimed that the drive to eradicate slavery was just a smokescreen for imperialism just as a century later their spiritual descendants portrayed the U.S. role "
