This may result in inaccuracies.\n\nSmoothing has been applied to series for lower-frequency words, using a moving-average algorithm. This reduces short-term fluctuations, which may be produced by variability in the content of the Google Books corpus.\n\nDecade Frequency per million words 19600.1719700.2619800.3319900.4620000.5520100.59\n\nFrequency of Zimbabwean, adj. & n., 2017–2023\n\n* Occurrences per million words in written English\n\nModern frequency series are derived from a corpus of 20 billion words, covering the period from 2017 to the present. The corpus is mainly compiled from online news sources, and covers all major varieties of World English.\n\nSmoothing has been applied to series for lower-frequency words, using a moving-average algorithm.
