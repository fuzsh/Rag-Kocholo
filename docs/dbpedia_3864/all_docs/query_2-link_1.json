Source [6] says, \"the administrative centre of Matabeleland North was recently moved from Bulawayo to Lupane.\" Source [7] mentions \"Lupane, the Matabeleland North capital\". Source [8] says \"Lupane ... was declared the capital of Zimbabwe's Matabeleland North province four years ago.\" Similar evidence shows that the capital of Mashonaland East has moved from Harare to Marondera, but no date can be established for the move.\n\nSource [5] had 1992 and 2002 census figures for the provinces and districts of Zimbabwe. There are two discrepancies between the figures given on that site for 1992 and the figures previously shown on this page. Mashonaland Central has 875,318 according to [5], 857,318 according to my former data; Midlands has 1,302,214 according to [5], 1,302,212 according to my former data. The total population, according to [5], is 10,401,767, which is compatible with only one combination of the putative populations. The total of the province populations comes out right using my figure for Mashonaland Central and [5]'s figure for Midlands. That is the combination shown below.\n\nChange Notice 8 to FIPS PUB 10-4 is dated 2002-06-28. It lists codes for the new cities with provincial status, Bulawayo and Harare.\n\nInternational standard ISO 3166-2 was published on December 15, 1998. It superseded ISO/DIS 3166-2 (draft international standard). For Zimbabwe, the draft standard showed eight provinces. The final standard shows the same eight provinces, with the same codes, and two new divisions, which are cities with provincial status: Bulawayo and Harare.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameZIMBABWE ISO codeZW FIPS codeZI LanguageEnglish (en) Time zone+2 CapitalHarare\n\nSouthern Rhodesia was a territory administered by the British South Africa Company at the start of the 20th century. It became a British colony in 1923. It joined in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland during that entity's term of existence (1953-1963), and then returned to colony status. In an attempt to retain a European-dominated government, it declared independence unilaterally. After some 14 years as a pariah state, it gave up the attempt and became fully independent as Zimbabwe.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDanish: Zimbabwe\n\nDutch: Zimbabwe, Republiek Zimbabwe (formal)\n\nEnglish: Republic of Zimbabwe (formal), Southern Rhodesia (obsolete)\n\nFinnish: Zimbabwe\n\nFrench: Zimbabwe m\n\nGerman: Simbabwe n\n\nIcelandic: Simbabve\n\nItalian: Zimbabwe\n\nNorwegian: Zimbabwe, Republikken Zimbabwe (formal)\n\nPortuguese: Zimbabwe, Zimbábue (Brazil), República f do Zimbábue m (formal)\n\nRussian: Республика Зимбабве (formal), Родезия (obsolete)\n\nSpanish: Zimbabue, República f de Zimbabue (formal), Rodesia (obsolete)\n\nSwedish: Zimbabwe\n\nTurkish: Zimbabve, Zimbabve Cumhuriyeti (formal)\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nNamed for ancient capital in ruins, whose name is Bantu zimba: palace, bwe: stone\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nZimbabwe is divided into eight provinces and two cities with provincial status.\n\nProvinceHASCFIPSPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²)CapitalAlt BulawayoZW.BUZI09653,337479185Bulawayo HarareZW.HAZI102,123,132872337HarareSalisbury ManicalandZW.MAZI011,752,69836,45914,077MutareUmtali Mashonaland CentralZW.MCZI031,152,52028,34710,945Bindura Mashonaland EastZW.MEZI041,344,95532,23012,444MaronderaMarandellas Mashonaland WestZW.MWZI051,501,65657,44122,178ChinhoyiSinoia MasvingoZW.MVZI081,485,09056,56621,840MasvingoFort Victoria Matabeleland NorthZW.MNZI06749,01775,02528,967Lupane Matabeleland SouthZW.MSZI07683,89354,17220,916Gwanda MidlandsZW.MIZI021,614,94149,16618,983GweruGwelo 10 divisions13,061,239390,757150,872\n\nProvince: Bulawayo and Harare are cities with provincial status.\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.
