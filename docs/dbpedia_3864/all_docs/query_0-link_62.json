        "text": "Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in any economy through generation of employments,contributing to the growth of GDP,embarking on innovations and stimulating of other economic activities.This sector is said to be the backbone of all developed and developing nations. So, the development of this sector is paramount important for any country irrespective of their level of development.This is even more important to developing countries where poverty and unemployment are the persisting problems in those economies. Having understood this fact, successive governments in Sri Lanka have taken various steps, from time to time, to promote this vital sector since independence. But,when analyzing the present contribution of this sector in the national economy,it is clear that the sector has not achieved desired level of contribution when compared with other developed and developing countries in the region.So,there seems to be a vast opportunity for Sri Lanka to harness t...\n\nThe development of Family-owned Businesses in developing countries including Sri Lanka is of great importance for increasing national production, providing employment for youth, developing rural and village industries, establishing a sound national industrial base, encouraging indigenous creativity and reducing the dependence on imported goods. Although the Family-owned Businesses are a vital instrument for realizing the above mentioned goals, the Family Business industrialists who are considered as a principal character, have a very poor survival rate in the economy. Thus, the problem in which the present research will concentrate entails developing a better understanding of how Family-owned Businesses can avoid failure and improve their effectiveness by using outside assistance. For this purpose a sample of 45 Family-owned Businesses were studied. The units of analysis were the network of actors offering support services to Family-owned Businesses and the entrepreneur skills. For simplicity only selected actors of support were considered, but particular attention paid to some intermediary actors who have served to activate, maintain and promote the resource networks with the Family Business.The statistical analysis model has provided significant statistical support for the acceptance that the successes of the Family-owned Businesses are closely related with the Social Networks and the Entrepreneur Skills.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to understand the dynamics and the nature of successful international business relationships between Sri Lankan small business (SB) entrepreneurs and Sri Lankan emigrants in other countries. Using social capital and social network theory framework, this phenomenological study found the nature and underlying values of business relationships that glue Sri Lankan SB entrepreneurs and their emigrant counterparts. ‘Family-like relationships’ and embedded values lead to developing trusting partnerships that became the sources of augmenting knowledge, resources and internationalization of Sri Lankan SBs. The findings will be useful for international human resource development (IHRD) practitioners to develop training interventions to promote SB internationalization. The implications for IHRD practice and research are discussed. It is important for IHRD scholars to conduct in-depth qualitative research to gain a deeper understanding of hidden values and practices of various SB communities whereas practitioners can initiate actions to develop global SBs.\n\nABSTRACT With an impressive history of small firm development policy, in post-Independence Sri Lanka SMEs dominate the industrial scenario through its contribution to generation of employment and income as also tackling the problem of regional disparities. The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) is considered as one of the most important sectors in Sri Lanka which crafts greater contribution to the growth and social development of the country. As spelt out in Mahinda Chintana – vision for the future, compared to large scale industries SMEs contribute more to the Sri Lankan economy since they have a more even geographic distribution and they function as nurseries for large scale industries in developing their creativity and innovativeness. Further, SME clustering is crucial to addressing social and economic objectives, the achievement of which can make them more competitive in the global economy; generating and spreading innovations; creating employment; and distributing broad-...\n\nAbstract Kotler (1997) defines demographic variables as demographic characteristics such as age, gender, family size, income, occupation, and so on. Demographic profile of entrepreneurs is the demographic characteristics of micro, small and medium entrepreneurs who run entrepreneurships in South Eastern Region. Objective of this research is to identify the demographic profile of Micro, Small and Medium Entrepreneurs in South Eastern Region of Sri Lanka. Population includes all Micro, Small and Medium Entrepreneurs -MSMEoperating in South Eastern Region. 121 entrepreneurs have been selected as sample size using convenience sampling method. Data are presented and analyzed using Excel with a version of 2007. It is found that there are 57, 54 and 10 Micro, Small and Medium Entrepreneurs who engage in micro, small and medium enterprises. Majority of the entrepreneurs who fall in the age category of 35 to 49 are young. Male entrepreneurs dominate female entrepreneurs. A majority of the entrepreneurs have 3 to 4 children as their family size. Entrepreneurs hide their definite income from their enterprises. Also, they occupy different roles in their business depending on the situation. A large number of entrepreneurs have studied G. C. E. (O/ L) and G. C. E. (A/ L). It is concluded that age, gender, family size, income, occupation and education have been identified as demographic profile of Micro, Small and Medium Entrepreneurs in South Eastern Region of Sri Lanka."
