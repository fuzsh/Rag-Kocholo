The document is a load shedding schedule from the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission & Distribution Company (ZETDC) for 2019. It explains that ZETDC is experiencing power shortages due to low water levels at Kariba Power Station and generation constraints at Hwange Power Station. To manage this, they will implement scheduled power cuts in two stages - stage 1 cuts certain areas for shorter durations, while stage 2 cuts additional areas if the shortfall increases. Tables then list the suburbs that will be affected during morning and evening peak periods on weekdays under stage 1 load shedding. Larger power users are requested to reduce usage during peaks.",
