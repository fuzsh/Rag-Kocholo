Beethoven-Haus

An important, fundamental cooperation has existed with the Beethoven-Haus Bonn since the founding of the competition.

The Beethoven-Haus sees itself as a research centre for Beethoven, a memorial to the Bonn Composer and also as a cultural institution with its own concert hall. Here, the active care and preservation of Bonn's greatest son is combined with research into the composer's life and work.

Director of the Beethoven-Haus is Malte Boecker.

The cooperation between the Beethoven-Haus Bonn and the International Telekom Beethoven Competition takes place on several levels: For example, the association donates the audience award "Beethoven-Haus Prize," in which the hall audience votes for its favourite in the semifinals. The prize winner receives prize money of 1,000 EUR, an invitation to a recital in the chamber music hall of the Beethoven-Haus and a bust of Beethoven by the artist Naoum Aronson donated by Gudula Neidert-Buech.

Since 2023, the cooperation has been extended: On the day after the finals, all finalists will be invited to perform in the Chamber Music Hall of the Beethoven-Haus Bonn as part of a shared prize-winners' matin√©e, thereby taking their musical leave of the competition audience.
