        "text": "In the Bing vs Google debate, many would point to the widespread popularity of Google ‚Äì the world‚Äôs largest search engine ‚Äì as evidence that users prefer it to its closest rival. Figures suggest that Google has 1 billion daily active users compared to Bing‚Äôs 100 million. Yet whilst Google continues to dominate the global market in 2024 with an 81.95% market share, challenger search engines like Microsoft‚Äôs Bing have pushed to eat up a portion of this share in recent years.\n\nDespite living in Google‚Äôs shadow from a market share perspective, Microsoft has been honing its search offering, achieving excellent performance in search ads in particular. The Bing equivalent to Google Ads, Microsoft Advertising, has made significant strides: in its FY24 Q4 earnings release, Microsoft reported $64.7 billion in total revenue (up 15% year-on-year) with search and news advertising revenue increasing by an above-average 19%.\n\nAlthough digital marketers often prioritise Google over Bing, the reality is that our strategies should focus on both search engines to ensure full coverage of our total addressable market (TAM). As you‚Äôll see in the course of this article, Bing represents an opportunity for SEO and PPC specialists to increase their sites‚Äô search visibility whilst reaching new users from different demographics.\n\nTo take full advantage, it‚Äôs important that you understand the nuances of Bing and Google, particularly with regard to their ranking processes and advertising offerings. Read on to learn more.\n\nNOTE: This post has been updated for 2024 üëç\n\nA Brief History of Bing and Google\n\nGoogle Search Engine History\n\nIn the early 90s, just as the Internet was being adopted by home users, a site called Jerry‚Äôs Guide to the World Wide Web was created. The brainchild of Stanford graduates, Jerry Yang and David Filo, this site would go on to become Yahoo in April 1994. As you can see from the image below, Yahoo was initially a database of websites that was organised through a hierarchical system rather than a searchable index of pages.\n\nThe next big move in the history of search engines came in 1998 when two Stanford PhD students‚Äì Larry Page and Sergey Brin ‚Äì founded Google. It started out as a research project known as BackRub, so-called due to its ranking method of analysing site backlinks to determine relative authority. This was what gave Google the edge over its competitors during its early days.\n\nAs an interesting aside, the name Google derives from the word Googol, a number equivalent to ten raised to the power of a hundred (10100). Page and Brin attempted to secure the domain Googol.com at the time, but changed the name to Google when they found that it wasn‚Äôt available.\n\nBing Search Engine History\n\nThe history of Microsoft‚Äôs Bing, on the other hand, is much more recent. Descended from Windows Live Search and MSN Search, Bing came into being when these services were amalgamated and rebranded in July 2009. The first major update occurred in August 2011, with Microsoft introducing a new index-serving technology known as ‚ÄúTiger‚Äù. Bing was then completely redesigned in 2015, followed by updates that penalised keyword stuffing and enhanced local search. More recently, in October 2020, ‚ÄúBing‚Äù rebranded to ‚ÄúMicrosoft Bing‚Äù, complete with a new logo and colours.\n\nGoogle‚Äôs algorithm updates have been well documented, starting out sporadically with one in 2000 and another in 2002, then becoming increasingly more frequent over the years. In the present climate, hundreds of search algorithm changes are made every year, ranging from minor changes to far-reaching broad core algorithm updates that shake up the search engine results pages (SERPs). By contrast, Bing algorithm changes are rarely spoken about in the SEO community.\n\nBing vs Google Market Share in 2024\n\nAlthough Google still dominates the global search market in 2024, Microsoft has seen some incremental gains in recent times. Google retains an 81.95% share of the global market, although this has fallen from just under 90% in the past five years; during the same timeframe, Bing‚Äôs share has risen from 3.99% up to 10.51% (having first broken the 10% marker at the start of 2024).\n\nCombined, Bing and Google currently hold nearly 92% of the global search engine market share. Yahoo is next in line with 2.67%, followed by Yandex, the most widely used search engine in Russia. These five search engines account for the vast majority of search engine usage around the world, although there are many alternatives out there including the likes of Ecosia, DuckDuckGo, and Brave Search.\n\nThe levels of competition between the search engine giants are intense, but this is healthy and necessary. It is largely as a result of the intense rivalry between Bing and Google that points of difference have emerged between, driven by the need to differentiate themselves and thereby increase market share.\n\nDifferences Between Bing and Google\n\nBing and Google are both search engines that offer paid advertising and follow the same broad set of principles to rank organic results, considering backlinks, content quality, technical health, and so on. Yet when we search for the same query in both of these search engines, we can often find a different set of organic results ‚Äì or the same pages, just organised into a different order. The purpose of the next section is, in part, to explore why this is.\n\nBing vs Google: Differences in Ranking Factors\n\nAlthough there isn‚Äôt a definitive list of confirmed ranking factors, we know that Google analyses more than 200 factors to rank search results. The official documentation from Bing and Google does however contain some useful information, and allows us to pick out key similarities and differences between their ranking algorithms.\n\nGoogle and Bing both look at factors like content quality, backlinks, and page speed as part of their ranking algorithms, so it‚Äôs worthwhile investing time in these areas. But there are also some notable differences in what the two search engines consider important when it comes to rankings.\n\nThis summary table below gives a quick overview of how the two search engines‚Äô automated ranking systems compare. Read on to discover more about each of these factors below.\n\nGoogle‚Äôs Mobile-First Indexing\n\nMost SEOs will be aware of Google‚Äôs mobile-first indexing policy and its implications. In short, Google uses the mobile version of a site for indexing and ranking purposes, making it important for all mobile content and metadata to be optimised fully and match that of the desktop version. (In practice, it‚Äôs best to avoid having separate mobile and desktop sites at all by implementing responsive design.)\n\nAccording to a previous announcement, mobile-first indexing was set to be applied to all websites by the end of 2020, however this was since pushed back to a deadline of March 2021. Any sites that still use a mobile version must optimise it appropriately and improve the mobile user experience (UX) where possible ‚Äì read our guide on mobile-first indexing for more information on this.\n\nBing has a very different policy from Google when it comes to indexing content. Bing‚Äôs Christi Olson has confirmed that Bing has no plans to implement any equivalent mobile-first indexing policy, and is sticking to a device-agnostic approach, stating that ‚Äúwe maintain a single index that is optimised for both mobile and desktop to ensure our users continue to receive the most relevant, fresh, and consistent results no matter where they are.‚Äù Despite this, you should still allow Google‚Äôs mobile-first indexing policy to guide your SEO and UX efforts (as outlined in our mobile-first indexing guide) because doing so will not hurt your performance with Bing.\n\nCore Web Vitals\n\nIn 2021, Google released a ranking factor called Core Web Vitals. It describes these as a set of metrics designed to ‚Äúmeasure real-world user experience for loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability of the page.‚Äù Since they were first launched, the interactivity metric ‚Äì First Input Delay ‚Äì has been replaced by Interaction to Next Paint (INP). Page load times are still evaluated by Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), whilst Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) measures visual stability.\n\nBing also wants to provide users with a great experience by serving pages that load fast and perform well on mobile, but it doesn‚Äôt have proprietary equivalent to Core Web Vitals.\n\nYou can read in detail about Core Web Vitals in our guide.\n\n302 Redirects and Indexing Issues\n\nWhen implementing permanent redirects In SEO, it is considered good housekeeping to use 301 redirects as opposed to temporary 302 redirects. The use of 302 redirects can sometimes cause indexing issues with Google, but Bing‚Äôs system works by automatically interpreting a 302 redirect as a 301 after it has been crawled a few times. 302 redirects are therefore unlikely to cause any problems with Bing. To ensure your site is optimised for both Bing and Google, however, it‚Äôs important not to use 302 redirects when a permanent redirect is required.\n\nGoogle Has a Better Understanding of JavaScript Content\n\nContrary to popular belief, Google‚Äôs crawlers have been able to understand JavaScript sections of your site for a while, and this will only improve over time: in 2015, a post on the Google Webmaster Central Blog stated that ‚Äúas long as you‚Äôre not blocking Googlebot from crawling your JavaScript or CSS files, we are generally able to render and understand your pages like modern browsers.‚Äù By contrast, Bing‚Äôs Webmaster Guidelines caution that ‚Äúrich media (Flash, JavaScript, etc.) can lead to Bing not being able to crawl through navigation, or not see content embedded in a webpage.‚Äù\n\nTaken together, the responses from Google and Bing provide a few useful takeaways when it comes to rich media and SEO:\n\nFirstly, sites should certainly avoid burying any important links on a page within JavaScript, as these may not be read by all search engines.\n\nSecondly, the general advice provided by Bing on this should be suitable for both Google and Bing SEO: ‚Äúto avoid any potential issues, consider implementing a down-level experience which includes the same content elements and links as your rich version does.‚Äù\n\nHere, the term ‚Äòdown-level experience‚Äô refers to the content that would be rendered on the site without all of the rich media (i.e. how some crawlers would see the page). Use the SEO Browser tool to check how your site appears to crawlers and make sure that all of the important content is visible.\n\nBing relies more heavily on old-school methods of understanding and ranking content, such as the use of keywords in title tags and URLs.\n\nBoth search engines still look for keywords in title tags as a way of matching queries with relevant results ‚Äì a quick glance at their official search documentation tells you as much. However, thanks to its ever-evolving natural language processing capabilities, Google has less need to rely on metadata (particularly since the advent of the RankBrain and BERT updates).\n\nHistorically, search engines have also looked for keywords in URLs and used this as a way to rank results. Google‚Äôs John Mueller has explicitly advised against relying on keyword-rich URLs, going so far as to say that ‚Äúa keyword domain name is not going to give you any recognisable SEO advantage‚Äù on the search engine. Despite this, it‚Äôs common even now to see exact match domain names performing well for queries they align with, but this occurs more often on Bing than on Google.\n\nThinking beyond SEO, using descriptive, keyword-rich URLs is best for your users: clear URL naming conventions send a clear signal about the purpose of your pages, whilst also highlighting where they sit in your site‚Äôs structure.\n\nBing Prefers Official Domain Types\n\nBing prefers established content that has either been live for quite some time or has gained a large amount of traffic. This preference is also reflected in the fact that Bing favours more official top-level domains such as .gov or .edu, whereas Google considers commercial or popular websites to be just as valuable in many situations and relies more on PageRank. With this in mind, you could argue that digital PR and link building campaigns are more important for ranking on Google than Bing.\n\nWe‚Äôve already noted that Google‚Äôs ranking process originated with a PhD project called BackRub, which used backlinks to determine relative site authority. Even now, the search engine still utilises backlink analysis as a primary method for ranking websites: the more links to your site, the better it‚Äôs authority (and the better it will stand out in the search results). Although still a deciding factor in ranking, Bing does not place quite as much importance on backlinks.\n\nDespite the fact that backlinks are more important for Google SEO, there are some significant commonalities between the two search engines‚Äô treatment of links. In both cases, it is not just the quantity of backlinks that determines authority but also the quality and relevance. Links from well-established sites that are relevant to the recipient site pass on more link equity than their less authoritative counterparts.\n\nBing Pays Attention to Social Signals\n\nIn 2016, Google‚Äôs Gary Illyes was asked if the search engine incorporates social signals (e.g. consumer-brand interaction on Facebook) into its ranking algorithms. His concise answer: ‚Äúno, we don‚Äôt‚Äù. Bing, however, is much keener on social media engagement, a preference that is reflected by its use of social signals as a ranking factor. Pages that have earned a greater number of likes, shares, and retweets are more likely to rank highly on Bing (although this is not a major ranking factor). Some form of social media marketing should be integrated into your digital marketing strategy by now, but Bing gives you an added incentive in the form of ranking boosts for strong social media performance.\n\nContent Quality, Relevancy, and Recency\n\nWhat unites Bing and Google is their shared focus on surfacing high-quality content for users. Google‚Äôs Helpful Content Update guidance state that its ‚Äúautomated ranking systems are designed to present helpful, reliable information‚Äù in the top search results. Similar sentiments around providing ‚Äúprovide fair, balanced, and comprehensive content‚Äù are expressed in Bing‚Äôs documentation. Both search engines, then, look to reward content that responds helpfully to search queries and objectively adds value to users.\n\nA further point of similarity is their emphasis on the recency or ‚Äúfreshness‚Äù of content, particularly when ranking results for highly topical or news-related queries. Pages containing the most recent, up-to-date information on a topic tend to rank higher than those that have become outdated. For this reason, it‚Äôs vital to continue publishing new content ‚Äì and refreshing older pages ‚Äì as part of your SEO strategy.\n\nBing vs Google: Beyond Ranking Factors\n\nWe‚Äôve covered a range of areas in which Bing‚Äôs ranking process varies from Google‚Äôs. But there are plenty of other differences between the two search engines aside from their ranking algorithms. Read on to discover how Bing and Google differ in terms of search results features, functionalities, AI capabilities and more.\n\nThe main contrasts between Bing and Google are summarised in this comparison table, and then considered in more depth in the sections below.\n\nGoogle Has Additional SERP Features\n\nBing has kept pace with Google throughout many SERP feature updates over the last few years. Whilst many of following SERP features were first created by Google (excluding the Twitter SERP feature), both search engines now use them:\n\nThat said, there are some examples where Bing has decided not to follow the path taken by its main competitor in this area. The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) SERP features that Google serves to mobile users are a conspicuous absence in the Bing search results. Depending on your point of view, the increased implementation of SERP features across both search engines could be considered a blessing or a curse.\n\nSome SEOs rail against the proliferation of featured snippets and people also ask (PAA) boxes in Google‚Äôs SERPs, citing studies that suggest they lower click-through rates (CTRs) for all sites on the first page. Indeed, since Google removed pages that have featured snippets from the organic listings below them, this view has become more and more popular ‚Äì particularly within ecommerce, some sites are opting out of featured snippets in favour of a listing using the max-snippet or no-snippet meta tags.\n\nOthers within the digital marketing community are only too happy to vie for SERP real estate by striving to obtain featured snippets and the like. It‚Äôs true that featured snippets can reduce CTRs in situations where a satisfactory answer is supplied within the snippet itself (why would you click through to a page if your question has already been answered in the SERPS?) However, in many instances users will choose to click through for more information ‚Äì and obtaining featured snippets for long-tail keywords can enable sites to target users with niche questions and drive increases in relevant traffic.\n\nBing Is More Visually Immersive\n\nIn March 2021, Microsoft Bing released a number of updates to their search features with the aim of moving towards ‚Äúsearch results that seamlessly combine information with visually rich imagery in a single beautiful view‚Äù, as described by Bing. This will be particularly welcomed by users who do not want to read large amounts of text to find the information they are looking for ‚Äì meaning, as with Google, users may no longer need to leave the SERPs to have their query answered.\n\nIn the example shown here, an informational search for ‚Äòtiger‚Äô brings up an infographic style search feature. The information is visually pleasing and displays clear, factual information which can be digested quickly. It‚Äôs worth noting that each fact within the infographic is taken from and links to a specific source website, offering a new feature for SEOs to optimise for. Unlike Google, the websites included within the infographic search feature are still listed as normal within the SERP.\n\nOther additional search features reduce the need for a user to click off the results page, such as expanded carousel search and intuitive information highlighting. Expanded carousel search allows users to hover over an image placed within a carousel, where it will expand to offer bite-sized information. With intuitive information highlighting, complete recipes and ‚Äòhow to‚Äô information can be intuitively pulled from a website and placed within a side panel directly into the results page.\n\nThe overall effect is that the user has no need to visit a website and sift through large amounts of text, but can instead gather important information directly from Microsoft Bing through engaging design. In that sense, Bing is much more visually immersive than Google.\n\nLocal Search and User Proximity\n\nBing differs from Google in its approach to handling local search queries such as ‚Äòrestaurants near me‚Äô, displaying an entirely different set of results for the same localised keywords.\n\nBoth search engines display a map of the local area with pins indicating the locations of businesses and places that are relevant to the search. However, Google typically focuses on the user‚Äôs immediate vicinity by default, whereas Bing provides a larger view of the wider area.\n\nCompare and contrast the two SERPs below for ‚Äòrestaurants near me‚Äô, the first of which is from Bing and the second from Google:\n\nThis hyper-local vs local pattern also applies in terms of the top pages that Bing and Google will provide for local searches: Google tends to serve top listings that are very close to the user, whilst Bing will provide the most relevant listing from a wider radius. In the example above, the top restaurant for Google is closer to the user‚Äôs actual location than the one provided by Bing. In 2019, Google updated its local search ranking process to prioritise user proximity, so this is unsurprising.\n\nBing announced an update in March 2021 to their local search results in order to display aggregated information from a variety of sources. In other words, instead of just a piece of text or image carousel for a local search, Bing now shows Bing Maps, images, reviews, and other features to give as much detail on the location as possible. First launched in the US, this move was a sign of Bing‚Äôs continued efforts to provide design-focused informational searches and offer a more comprehensive overview than Google currently achieves.\n\nBing and Google Maps Side by Side\n\nBing Maps and Google Maps are both integral components of their respective search engines ‚Äì these map functionalities have become widely used and are now central to Bing and Google‚Äôs offerings. We‚Äôve briefly touched upon the differences between them in the context of local search, but it‚Äôs worth digging a little deeper into this.\n\nAt first glance, there aren‚Äôt too many visual differences between the user interfaces (UIs) of Bing Maps and Google Maps, as you can see from these screenshots of the two:\n\nBoth maps functions provide the user with a knowledge panel containing information about the area or business, in addition to direction, sharing, and saving functionalities. The main section of both UIs is taken up by the map itself ‚Äì in both cases, the map allows the user to zoom in and move about.\n\nThe most significant differences between Bing Maps and Google Maps come down to the directions they provide and the data that goes with this. The estimated journey times and accompanying route information differs between the two web mapping services.\n\nGoogle appears to give slightly longer estimates: when searching for directions between Impression‚Äôs Fothergill House office in Nottingham and St Pancras Station in London by car, Bing estimates a 2 hour 39 minute journey and Google suggests 2 hours 45 minutes. Other journeys produce a similar disparity, with Google tending to add around 3-5% of the estimated journey time that was suggested by Bing in each case.\n\nAlthough not important in SEO, it‚Äôs interesting that Google Maps provides the user with additional information regarding the fastest route between the destinations. When searching for Impression-St Pancras directions, for example, Google Maps highlights the fact that the chosen route avoids the closure of a major bridge along the way, whereas Bing Maps makes no reference to this potentially significant closure.\n\nBing Impresses with Image and Visual Search\n\nRecent studies have found that 62% of Gen Z and Millennials want visual search capabilities. With the advancement of AI and machine learning, the demand for image search is continuously growing ‚Äì but who is currently ahead of the game between Google vs Bing?\n\nWhile Google offers users a wider selection of images and an Advanced Search function for helpful filtering, Bing offers higher-quality images with more detailed information than Google.\n\nBing also offers visual search capabilities straight from the search engine, giving users the ability to complete a wide range of immersive functions (called specialised skills), such as shopping for furniture or clothing, identifying celebrities, exploring landmarks and finding similar images. The search engine is particularly good at displaying information alongside the images, such as pricing.\n\nAnother advantage of Bing Visual Search is that it allows developers to tell Bing what actions should be offered to a user directly from the image, such as leading users to a sale on a product page. Considering this together with higher quality images and more detailed information, Bing may currently have the upper hand on Google over image search capabilities.\n\nHowever, Google is hot on the tails of its main rival with an ever-improving image search offering powered by its Multitask Unified Model (MUM).\n\nVoice Search ‚Äì Bing and Google Comparison\n\nAccording to data from an Adobe survey, 48% of consumers use voice search for ‚Äúgeneral web searches‚Äù and 39% used virtual personal assistants (VPAs) via their smart speaker devices. Clearly, voice search represents a huge opportunity for SEOs and digital marketers more generally, but what are the key differences between the functionalities provided by Bing and Google?\n\nPrevious commentators have suggested that the two search engines offer different benefits to users of voice search. Writing for Search Engine Watch, Clark Boyd has argued that Microsoft‚Äôs digital assistant, Cortana, has superior speech recognition but less accurate understanding of context than the Google Assistant. The point regarding the understanding of context makes sense when we consider recent Google developments such as MUM and its predecessor BERT.\n\nAs mentioned above, many voice searches take place via a physical smart speaker device such as an Amazon Echo. Given that these devices are one of the primary means by which voice searches are made, we might want to know which of the two major search engines‚Äô results are used to answer queries most often as a further point of contrast.\n\nThere are no published statistics regarding the number of smart speaker VPA queries that are answered by Bing in comparison to Google. However, three of the four VPAs ‚Äì Apple‚Äôs Siri, Microsoft‚Äôs Cortana, and Amazon‚Äôs Alexa ‚Äì use Bing for this purpose, with only the Google Assistant providing answers from Google. As such, we can assume that the majority of smart speaker users are receiving answers to their questions from Bing rather than Google.\n\nWhatever the source of the results provided to users, the process of optimising your website for voice search remains the same. Fortunately for SEOs, this means that the same optimisation techniques will help to ensure that your content is used for voice search results powered by both Bing and Google. Read our dedicated guide for more information on optimising your site for voice search.\n\nBing Offers No Equivalent to Google Books and Scholarly Articles\n\nUniversity students and book-lovers alike will tend to be drawn to Google over Bing due to the search engine‚Äôs useful features for carrying out research, including Google Books and Scholarly Articles. Similar to Google Images, these are displayed as separate tabs within the UI that users can switch over to if they are looking for books or academic papers on a given topic.\n\nThere are plenty of useful applications for these functionalities. Students looking to find that one key reference to support their thesis can use Scholarly Articles to help narrow down the search without having to pore over endless tomes in a physical library. And if you like the sound of a new novel from your favourite author but want to try before you buy, Google Books can help you do just that, with previews available for many titles.\n\nGoogle Got Ahead of the Game With Flights and Finance\n\nFlights and Finance are two other handy features pioneered by Google. Similar to sites like Skyscanner, Google Flights does exactly what it says on the tin: users can search and book flights via third-party operators all from one page, with the added benefit that you can filter flights by their environmental impact in terms of carbon emissions. Although Bing has created its own version of Flights, Google Finance remains unique. This interface allows you to view market trends and current share prices alongside a collection of relevant news stories, all without leaving Google.\n\nAI in Search: Google Gemini vs Bing Chat (Microsoft Copilot)\n\nIn February 2023, Bing took a leap with OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4, debuting Bing Chat (since rebranded to Copilot). This was a new feature allowing users to engage in conversations with its AI chatbot instead of traditional search queries. Responding swiftly in March 2023, Google introduced its AI chatbot, Gemini, powered by Google‚Äôs PaLM 2 language model. Differing from ChatGPT, Gemini leverages a distinct approach by directly extracting information from the web.\n\nComparing the two, Gemini presents three response drafts for selection, while Copilot allows for response refinement upon request. Furthermore, Copilot can create AI-generated images, whereas Gemini can only retrieve images from the internet.\n\nOverall, Copilot‚Äôs versatility and accessibility outshine Google Gemini. However, Google has stepped up its game with the custom Gemini-powered search feature, AI Overviews, which is reshaping the way we research and plan online. Watch this space!\n\nBing vs Google: Paid Advertising\n\nWe‚Äôve now discussed the vast majority of differences between the two search engine giants when comparing them from an organic search perspective. All that remains in this Bing and Google comparison is to explore how the two search engines vary in terms of their paid advertising services: Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords) and Microsoft Advertising (formerly Bing Ads). Here at Impression, we believe in the value of both platforms, offering Microsoft Advertising Management and Google Ads Management.\n\nA Brief History of Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising\n\nMicrosoft Advertising is a much younger paid ad offering than Google Ads, beginning life as MSN adCenter in 2006. Prior to this, all of the PPC advertising on MSN Search was supplied by Overture and then Yahoo. Microsoft was definitely late to the party by comparison to the other major search engine providers, but soon realised that there was a burgeoning market to tap into.\n\nBy the time MSN adCenter was launched, Google Adwords was in its prime and had been running for 6 years, putting the new challenger on the backfoot from the outset. To begin with, its business model was distinct from the present offering: utilising a subscription-based model, Google would set up and manage campaigns on behalf of businesses. All of this changed in 2005 with the release of the Adwords self-service portal, the basis for the contemporary Google Ads service.\n\nDifferences Between Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising\n\nWhen starting out with PPC advertising, the first thing that many businesses want to know is which platform has the greatest reach. Given Google‚Äôs dominance in the search market from an early stage, it‚Äôs unsurprising that Google Ads enables sites to reach a far larger volume of users than Microsoft Advertising.\n\nThat said, Microsoft has made several strategic moves over the years in an effort to eat into Google‚Äôs share of the paid search market:\n\nFollowing the launch of advertising on Facebook in 2006, Microsoft teamed up with the social network and adverts from its adCenter were published across the site (although Facebook replaced this by launching its own ad service the year after).\n\nWith the launch of Bing in 2010, Microsoft partnered with Yahoo. The partnership enabled Bing ads to be syndicated on the Yahoo network.\n\nAt present, Microsoft Advertising in the single source of advertising across the Yahoo and AOL networks.\n\nIn 2021, Bing announced a new responsive ad format called Multimedia Ads following their focus on visually immersive search, which uses machine learning to combine images, headlines and descriptions. Importantly, only one Multimedia Ad will be displayed on a page, giving it prominence in the SERP. Google Ads does not currently offer a similar ad format with such exclusivity.\n\nDespite Microsoft‚Äôs best efforts, Google Ads remains the dominant force in PPC. But with this position comes great competition between businesses for Google‚Äôs SERP space, which can be off-putting for smaller firms and new entrants to the paid search market. Achieving the top paid positions on Google is far more difficult than on Bing, requiring high-quality scores and significant levels of investment.\n\nThis brings us on to another key difference between Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising: the cost. The cost per click (CPC) on individual keywords tends to be lower with Microsoft Advertising than with its paid search rival, with aggregate effects on the cost of campaigns as a whole. (Keep in mind, however, that this is not the case in some verticals.) Whilst costs are generally lower with Microsoft, there‚Äôs a trade-off between price and audience volume ‚Äì costs may be higher on Google Ads, but you‚Äôll reach a much larger audience.\n\nThe composition of Bing‚Äôs audience likewise differs from Google‚Äôs. The challenger search engine is typically frequented by older users with higher levels of education than Google‚Äôs average user, so working with the UK‚Äôs second-favourite search engine can really benefit businesses that target this demographic specifically. Even for brands that have adopted a mass-market targeting strategy, spreading your paid search advertising across both channels can help to ensure even coverage.\n\nIn relation to this, there‚Äôs also variation between the targeting options offered by the two paid ad services. Both platforms enable sites to target specific user segments based on characteristics such as demographics, increasing the efficiency of ad spend. Google Ads offers a wide range of targeting options, from remarketing to dynamic search ads; Microsoft Advertising provides several targeting options, but is generally considered to be less advanced than its main competitor in this respect. In 2021, Bing announced the expansion of the Microsoft Audience Network and also the release of Similar Audiences targeting, although this has only currently rolled out to the US market.\n\nMicrosoft Advertising does allow you to use data from users‚Äô LinkedIn profiles to create target segments. This information can be really useful for certain types of business that want to target users who work in specific industries (recruitment firms, for example, would benefit from this). Working at a more granular level, it can also be used as a tool to target employees of particular companies with ads. The LinkedIn targeting function is exclusive to Microsoft Advertising and LinkedIn Ads.\n\nFor businesses trying to decide which PPC platform to choose, we would recommend using both of them as part of an integrated digital marketing strategy. As we‚Äôve seen, each search engine has its own unique flaws, merits, and audiences, so sites often see the best performance overall when combining the two and serving ads on both.\n\nBing vs Google: Which Is Best?\n\nGoogle is still market leader in 2024 with an 81.95% market share. It is often first to launch innovative features like AI Overviews and has a larger index to pull high-quality pages from. However, Bing has kept pace by bringing AI into its search results with Microsoft Copilot, and excels in offering users a more visually immersive search experience.\n\nRounding Up\n\nWe‚Äôve covered a huge amount of ground here, so let‚Äôs wrap up with a quick overview.\n\nStarting with the history of the two firms and their competitive rivalry, we went on to consider the main differences in their organic ranking processes. This section put forward a number of actionable recommendations around how to optimise sites for both Bing and Google.\n\nChoose URLs and metadata that help include your target keywords and help users to understand the content of your pages.\n\nNever use a 302 redirect when a permanent 301 redirect is required.\n\nFocus your off-page efforts on gaining high quality links from relevant, authoritative sites.\n\nEncourage users to engage with your brand via social media (Bing takes social media metrics into account in its organic ranking process).\n\nFor pages that contain lots of JavaScript and rich media content, ensure that crawlers can read all of the important information. To do this, create a down-level experience with the same elements as the rich version, expressing important details through HTML (you can check how crawlers see your page using the SEO Browser tool).\n\nIf your site still has separate desktop and mobile versions, check that they are both optimised in the same way and that the mobile UX is seamless.\n\nAbove all, keep publishing fresh, helpful content that will add value to your audience ‚Äì and regularly update older pages.\n\nThis blog has also provided a comparison of Bing and Google beyond ranking factors, looking at SERP features, local search, maps functionalities, and voice search. There are a number of important takeaways from this section:\n\nGoogle offers additional SERP features such as Google Scholar.\n\nBing‚Äôs local search scours a wider radius by default, whereas Google tends to focus on listings that are in closer proximity to the user.\n\nGoogle Maps estimates longer journey times than Bing Maps, but also provides more important information regarding the route you have selected.\n\nBing is moving towards a more visually immersive search experience, offering unique search features not currently used by Google\n\nGoogle offers a wider selection of images, however Bing‚Äôs images are higher-quality and offers more detailed information.\n\nIn relation to voice search, the Google Assistant has a greater understanding of linguistic context but less accurate speech recognition than Microsoft‚Äôs Cortana (for tips on optimising for voice search through both search engines, see our blog on this issue).\n\nOnly Google smart speakers and Google Assistant-enabled devices use Google results for VPA responses, whereas Apple‚Äôs Siri, Microsoft‚Äôs Cortana, and Amazon‚Äôs Alexa all use Bing results.\n\nBoth search engines are vying to get ahead with AI in search ‚Äì Google has launched AI Overviews, providing AI-generated summaries and answers to questions directly in search results.\n\nThe third section of this guide compared the two search engines‚Äô paid advertising services (Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising). It‚Äôs worth remembering from this section that Google‚Äôs offering predates Bings by six years, having been launched as Google AdWords in 2000. Another key point to take away is that Microsoft has made several attempts to obtain a share of the PPC market over the years but Google remains the dominant force in this area.\n\nFinally, we evaluated the pros and cons of Google Ads by comparison to Microsoft Advertising: the former service is more expensive, has a larger reach, and offers more advanced targeting options, but we would advise businesses to adopt an integrated PPC strategy that combines both services. In doing so, your campaigns will benefit from the unique features of both platforms and reach a much wider audience in total."
