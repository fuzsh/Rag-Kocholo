        "text": "Microsoft Forms: Live Data Sync to Microsoft Excel\n\nMicrosoft Forms has introduced a live data sync feature with Excel for the web, allowing for automatic updates and coauthor support. This feature applies to both group forms and individual forms. Users can create an Excel workbook in Microsoft OneDrive on the form/quiz responses page, with responses automatically syncing to a table in the workbook. The sync occurs in real-time while the workbook is open in Excel for the web, and coauthors will also receive automatically synced responses. Initially released as a preview, this feature supports syncing for forms created in Microsoft 365 groups and Excel for the web, with plans to extend this functionality to Excel for Desktop over time.\n\nFor additional information, visit:\n\nForms Data Sync to Excel\n\nCreate Group Form or Quiz\n\nMicrosoft OneDrive: Additional File Types Filters\n\nIn your OneDrive on the web file list, you will see a new dropdown menu next to the filter pills in Home, Shared, People, Meetings, and Favorites views. You’ll be able to select from the following file types:\n\nOneNote\n\nMicrosoft Lists\n\nVideos\n\nLoop\n\nPhotos\n\nWhiteboard\n\nPowerBI\n\nMicrosoft Teams: Message Search Result Suggestions\n\nUsers will now see message suggestions when typing search terms in the suggestions box or selecting the message filter. These suggestions are derived from recent chats and include details such as the sender's name, profile picture, message location, meeting or group chat title, participants, message date, and icons for any web links or file attachments. This information helps users evaluate and find the most relevant message.\n\nIf a relevant message is not in the suggestions, you have an option to click See more message results or press Enter in the message-filtered state to see all relevant message suggestions in the Search Results page.\n\nComing Soon to Microsoft 365\n\nMicrosoft Teams: In Chat, \"Files\" Renamed to \"Shared\" (August 2024)\n\nCurrently, the Files tab located at the top of a Microsoft Teams Chat curated one list of files shared in the chat and did not include links. Soon, the “Files” tab will be replaced by the new “Shared” tab, and will include recent files, all files, and links.\n\nMicrosoft OneDrive: Change to Shared Folder Experience (August 2024)\n\nCurrently, when a user opens a shared folder in OneDrive, they are taken to a view of that folder within the sharer’s OneDrive. In the new experience, opening a shared folder will take the user to the shared folder within the People view of their own OneDrive. This view, organized by people, allows for more efficient and organized access to all the files and folders that have been shared with the user.\n\nMicrosoft Teams: Ability to Rename General Channel (August 2024)\n\nIn response to customer feedback, Microsoft is introducing the ability to provide a meaningful name to the General channel in a new or existing team. The General channel can be renamed by the team owners to show up in the teams' and channels' list of all members in alphabetical order.\n\nMicrosoft Teams: New Skin Tone Settings and Reactions (September 2024)\n\nWith skin tone settings and reactions in Microsoft Teams, users will be able to set a preferred skin tone for relevant emojis and reactions. Each user can change their own skin tone setting in the Teams app Settings > Appearance and accessibility menu or in the emoji/reaction menu on Desktop or web. The skin tone rollout will apply to emojis and reactions in chats, channels, and meetings on all Teams platforms.\n\nMicrosoft Teams: Hide Presenters and Support Roles from Webinar Event Page (September 2024)\n\nSoon webinar organizers can add presenter privileges—to join the green room, manage what attendees see, turn their camera on or off, and moderate the event— for individuals without displaying them on the event page. Before this rollout, all presenters added to a Microsoft Teams webinar were displayed on the event page. This feature will allow webinar organizers to support roles like live translators, event moderators, and staff who are not presenting.\n\nTo access this new feature, go to the Teams calendar and select the arrow next to New meeting > Webinar > Presenter bios > Select Hide from site in the three-dot menu:\n\nMicrosoft Lists: Drag and Drop List Item (October 2024)\n\nMicrosoft will soon release a new drag-and-drop feature for the Microsoft Lists app. Previously unavailable, this feature will allow users to drag and drop individual or multiple items to reorder lists. Once released, this feature will be enabled by default for all users."
