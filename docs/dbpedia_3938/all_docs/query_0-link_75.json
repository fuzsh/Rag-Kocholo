        "text": "Swati Rajwal\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nAnalytics Vidhya\n\n·\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nFeb 24, 2021\n\n--\n\nA step-by-step guide for beginners to understand the search tool and start using it today.\n\nWhat is Microsoft Academic\n\nIt is a free public academic search engine for publications and literature, developed by Microsoft Research.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, there are 4527 conferences, 251,367,233 publications, and about 49002 journals in this search engine. I recommend you to visit Microsoft Academic’s website and see the metrics (which may differ from what I mentioned above).\n\nLet’s Get Started: Trending Topics\n\nBeing a curious CS student, I always like to know the current topics or areas of research in an as quick way as possible. In Microsoft Academics, Topics Analytics provides a neat and clean visualization of the trending topics in all the topics (Art, Biology, Chemistry, Business, Medicine, and many more!). By using appropriate filters, you can apprehend topics in the field of your interest.\n\nThere are two fascinating tabs on Topics Analytics:\n\nTopic Browser: It contains the option for you to choose or search a topic (or child topic) and the result will be an easily understandable graph with necessary information. For example, the Topic is Computer Science and the child topic is Artificial Intelligence (fig. 2). You can easily download the CSV file using the download button on the top right corner of the graph, for your own manipulations.\n\nTopic Graph Explorer: This allows visual navigation to the topic graph. Topic level hierarchies are color-coded and the size of nodes denotes the number of publications. Search for a topic of your interest and you will find a large cluster of related domains to the topic of interest (Fig. 3). Click on the node to expand it further.\n\nTake some time to understand the importance of such a powerful visualization.\n\nThe bottom page of both tabs contains even more information like authors, conferences, institutions, journals, publications to give a holistic view of the trending topics. It is amazing to get such a piece of vast information served under one umbrella.\n\nFind Specific Research Studies\n\nWhile the above filters are very helpful to get an insight into the overall incline of research topics in a field, you may want to search specific studies and get information about individual researches independently. You do so by searching very particular and distinct keywords on the top search bar (you also get suggestions).\n\nOn the result page (fig. 4), you can retrieve loads of information per research/study like-\n\nNumber of citations\n\nYear of publication\n\nAuthors\n\nPublisher and Journal\n\nAbstract\n\nOption to download the paper (not available for all papers)\n\nAdd publication to the reading list (for studying later)\n\nAdd paper to citation list for later review or cite in your research work.\n\nThis information helps you to decide if you want to further analyze the paper or not. It also gives you an understanding of the topic under consideration.\n\nMicrosoft Academic Filters\n\nSort search results: By default, the search results are shown in order of relevance. But you can sort the search results based on other criteria like saliency (the measure of impact for each result that matches the query), newest first, oldest first, most estimated citations\n\nTime: Suppose you wish to do a per-year review of a certain topic. Time filter comes to your rescue allowing you to query and reducing the set of results to items matching the year or year range mentioned.\n\nTop topics: The study you’ve searched will probably fall in many “Top Topics” includes many isolated domains in which studies have been done as the topic you’ve searched for. It also shows the most relevant and popular ones on the top helping you to further get an insight into its popularity.\n\nPublication Type: Another crucial filter allowing one to select from many publication types like- Conference publications, Journal publications, repository publications, patents, thesis, books, book chapters.\n\nTop Authors: This shows the authors who made the most contribution in the field you’ve just searched for. You can select the top one or many authors to see their work only.\n\nTop Journals: All the popular journals, where papers/studies related to your search topic have been published, are shown here with highly popular on the top. From this, one can understand the journal to target. This is a very crucial piece of information to know in the field of research, i.e., the journal you wish to get your paper published in. Select one or two journals from the list to see all the work published in those journals.\n\nTop Institutions: The institutions which have contributed the most, to the topic you’re searching for, will be listed here.\n\nTop Conferences: If you wish to see the top academic conferences where a research paper was presented, you can use this filter. You can check the conferences you wish to attend and observe the pattern of papers that were accepted by the conference. Again, like all other filters, this is a very handy way to minimizing the searching and saving tons of time.\n\nQuick Recap\n\nIn this blog, we discussed some of the benefits you get upon using Microsoft Academics-\n\nAvailability of great filters (Top institute, authors, conferences, topics, publication types)\n\nRelevant information in a consolidated format on a single page.\n\nVery pleasant visualization using just clicks. It is user-friendly.\n\nEasily able to find trending topics in many popular fields\n\nConclusion\n\nThis blog gives an insight into Microsoft Academics. Various filters are provided to allow users to reduce the search set and query on the basis of requirements.\n\nAlso, note that there are many other features that I didn’t include for the sake of simplicity and length of this article. This blog is meant to help you understand the platform and get started using it in a constructive manner.\n\nAlso, you can ask me a question on Twitter and LinkedIn!\n\nThank you."
