        "text": "In its latest bid to catch up with rivals Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc., Microsoft Corp. is launching a revamped Internet search engine it says will help computer users find information faster, view it more easily and organize it better.\n\nDebuting in test form Wednesday, Windows Live Search is Microsoft's latest move in a major strategy shift that has the world's largest software company focusing more heavily on Internet-based software and services.\n\nThe goal of the shift, which includes initiatives dubbed Windows Live and Office Live, is to create online products to complement its main cash cows: the Windows operating system and Office business software.\n\nWindows Live Search will be the search engine powering both MSN.com and live.com, Microsoft's Windows Live Web site. MSN spokesman Adam Sohn said the company has not determined how long it will run Windows Live Search in test form.\n\nA key goal with the new search engine will be to give people more control over how they search for information and how they put it to use once they get it, said Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president of information services at MSN, the division that's working on Windows Live.\n\n\"A lot of people think, 'Hey, ... Didn't Google become the popular search engine? And don't they just do a great job? And there's no room for improvement.'\" Mehdi said. Once people get a feel for Windows Live Search, Mehdi said, \"They're going to say, 'Holy cow, I had no idea that search could get this much better!'\"\n\nThe new search engine includes features such as support for tabbed Web browsing, which lets people keep several search panes open in a single window. Microsoft said other features will include:\n\nA search slider bar that offers previews of data in various forms, perhaps just the Internet address of a Web site, or maybe a snippet of text. As the slider is adjusted, more or less information appears.\n\nA \"smart scroll\" function that displays all search results at once rather than on separate pages.\n\nVarious ways to view pictures, say, as small \"thumbnail\" shots or full-sized images, without leaving the search page.\n\nAn ability for users to save their search parameters as macros that can be run to perform the same search in the future. Microsoft said people will also be able to publish their search macros so people with similar interests can use them.\n\nJoe Wilcox, an analyst with Jupiter Research, said he's not ready to make any predictions.\"Conceptually it sounds good. Execution will tell all,\" said Wilcox, who got an early briefing on the new search engine. Microsoft did not give analysts or reporters access to the search engine before its planned launch Wednesday.\n\nWilcox said Microsoft's best shot at gaining ground on its competitors is if it can make search results more relevant.\n\n\"There's something very alien about the whole keyword approach as a means of finding stuff,\" Wilcox said. \"So if Microsoft can move away from that and actually let people ask questions, use more natural language...that could really boost the usability of search. That's the kind of thing that could put pressure on Google.\"\n\nGoogle ended January with a 48.2 percent share of the U.S. search market and Yahoo ranked second with a 22.2 percent share, according to Nielsen/NetRatings Inc. MSN ranked third with 11 percent of the market -- down slightly from a year earlier."
