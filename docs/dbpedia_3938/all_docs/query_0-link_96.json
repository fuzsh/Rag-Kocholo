        "text": "[seattlepi.nwsource.com...]\n\nI read in a news today that Microsoft has released its beta Windows Live Search at [live.com...] which would replace MSN some times in Summer. It's quite innovative with a lot of new features consolidated. Its screen fit with your computer. In search, you don't have to go from page 1 to page 2 or 3, but streamline down - so basically you may not need to be at #1 or page 1 like traditional SE to get traffic.\n\nThe page takes awfully long to load the first time.\n\nHopefully they fix that, otherwise people aren't going to stick around.\n\nAnd the \"Oops, we seem to be having a problem with this feed. Please try again later.\" doesn't impress either, oh well it is a Beta.\n\nYes, no need to change pages for search results, but how far are you going to scroll through results before giving up?\n\nYou will probably still need to be ranked near the top for your keywords to get any traffic.\n\nIt is more than just a search page, looks like they are integrating your hotmail and their new version of messenger as well.\n\nUsability and accessibility test results summary:\n\nWindows Live search (0/10)\n\nGoogle Search (8/10)\n\nFor illustrative purposes, the result of trying to use both services with lynx 2.8.5dev.16 are shown below.\n\nWindows Live:\n\nHome page:\n\n# Windows Live\n\n#Windows Live Search\n\n____________________ Search\n\nIFRAME: naviframe\n\nResulting page from a search for 'test':\n\n# Windows Live\n\n#Windows Live Search\n\n____________________ Search\n\nIFRAME: naviframe\n\nGoogle:\n\nHome page:\n\nGoogle\n\nPersonalized Home ¦ Sign in\n\nGoogle\n\nWeb Images Groups News Froogle Local more »\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nGoogle Search I'm Feeling Lucky Advanced Search\n\nPreferences\n\nLanguage Tools\n\nAdvertising Programs - Business Solutions - About Google\n\n©2006 Google\n\nResulting page from a search for 'test':\n\ntest - Google Search (p1 of 2)\n\nSign in\n\nGo to Google Home Web Images Groups News Froogle Local more »\n\ntest_____________________________________ Search Advanced Search\n\nPreferences\n\nWeb Results 1 - 10 of about 1,980,000,000 for test [definition]. (0.15 seconds)\n\nSite One Title\n\nSite One Snippet ...\n\nwww.siteone URL/ - 36k - Cached - Similar pages\n\nSite Two Title\n\nSite Two Snippet ...\n\nwww.sitetwo URL/ - 36k - Cached - Similar pages\n\netc etc etc...\n\nIf the service isn't made a lot more accessible I hope that Google funds someone in a legal case against Microsoft Live. Personally I cannot stand their interface - it is complex, it isn't intuitive, and it is very very slow.\n\nWow... this is the best search engine around today...\n\nAnd I have (and need) only one raeson:\n\nI am on the first page for many of my sites... :)\n\nAs opposed to the second or fifth on Google.\n\nThe improvements they can make according to me are:\n\n* Faster loading\n\n* It is a bit unclear (the text) on my laptop anyways\n\n* When using the \"more or less\" text feature in the middle of a scroll it jumps from away from the text you have.\n\nWell thats it for me today. Take care everybody\n\nI have to agree with what someelse said, the load time is terrible.\n\nOther than that I noticed some result listed that had an IP address listed as the url. Would it be better to show the domain name rather than the IP Address. When I see an IP Address rather than a domain name, it just yells spam.\n\nAlso on a specific search for a keyword, I found a listing that was nothing more than a test page. The keyword was not even on the page. So it doesn't appear to me that Windows Live concerns itself much with content.\n\nTo me, this look like a high schooler's attempt at a search engine. Not what I would expect from Billy Gates and frankly if this is representative of Microsofts search engine development team, I would seriously consider firing the whole team. I realize it is just a beta product, but for a company like Microsoft, that is just plain embarrassing.\n\nI think Microsoft is shaking with this idea..\n\nThe technics are Cewl and almost a incredible w3schools job! Congratulations for that Team Live.com.\n\nBut in my opinion they forget that it is all about information... fast and easy..\n\nThe scrolling effect in the SERPS are cewl but i still want page navigation links... so build them both!\n\nI only tested live.com on IE sinds my Firefox isnt working anymore.\n\n[edited by: r3nz0 at 3:55 pm (utc) on Mar. 8, 2006]\n\nthat's really really annoying, what's wrong with the browser scroll?\n\nIf i want to go to position 65 on google i move my bar and blamo, i'm there in 0.2 seconds. If i want to get there on \"live\" it takes 3-4 seconds and thus, i'm bored and i've gone back to google."
