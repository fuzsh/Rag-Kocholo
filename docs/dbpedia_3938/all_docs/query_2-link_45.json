Now he is ready to reveal his new AI company in the Netherlands. But can Europe forget his past?\n\nHow IT Departments Scrambled to Address the CrowdStrike Chaos\n\nSystem administrators and their teams sprang into action last Friday and worked tirelessly to get their companies back online amid one of the worst digital blackouts ever.\n\nWe Asked AI to Take Us On a Tour of Our Cities. It Was Chaos\n\nWe had a specialty chatbot to curate perfect days out in London and New York for under $100 each.
