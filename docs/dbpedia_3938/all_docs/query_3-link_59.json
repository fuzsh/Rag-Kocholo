        "text": "Scholarship recipients must be continuously enrolled, full-time, at a SUNY or CUNY college. A pause in enrollment is only allowable for the following reasons:\n\nYou experience the death of an immediate family member.\n\nYou are called to active military duty.\n\nYou interrupt your studies to take care of your newborn child (parental leave).\n\nYour medical or health care provider determines that your medical condition or mental health prevents you from beginning or continuing the term or from continuing a full-time course load.\n\nYou interrupt your studies to provide care for an immediate family member who needs extra care due to health needs, as confirmed by their medical or health care provider.\n\nIf you meet any of the above conditions, please reach out to your school to have your eligibility reviewed. Your school will notify HESC if it is determined that you are eligible to receive your award.\n\nCircumstances other than those indicated above will not allow you to retain your award.\n\nCredit Requirement\n\nAn applicant who is not on track to complete an associate degree in two consecutive years or a bachelor's degree in four consecutive years (which requires the completion of an average of 30 credits per year) can catch up on missing credits to become eligible for an Excelsior Scholarship. Students initially deemed ineligible due to insufficient credits who then caught up on credits must reapply for the scholarship once they meet the credit requirements.\n\nYour household combined federal adjusted gross income must be $125,000 or less.\n\nYou must be in good standing (a non-default status) on a student loan made under any NYS or federal education loan program or on the repayment of any NYS award.\n\nYou must be in compliance with the terms of the service condition(s) imposed by any NYS award that you have previously received.\n\nHas your income been adversely affected due to a disability, divorce or separation of the applicant, parent or spouse or the death of a parent or spouse?\n\nIf you were notified that you are ineligible because your household federal adjusted gross income (AGI) is greater than $125,000, but your income was adversely affected due to a disability, divorce or legal separation of the applicant, parent or spouse or the death of a parent or spouse, you may be eligible to use your current income to establish income eligibility.\n\nTo request a review of your eligibility, complete the Income Eligibility Determination Form and upload it here.\n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, students with disabilities can take longer to complete their associate degree or bachelor’s degree and retain their Excelsior Scholarship eligibility if their disability requires them to attend less than full-time (30 credits per year, or its equivalent) or if they need to pause their studies due to their disability.\n\nStudents with qualified disabilities who attend less than full-time must register with their college office for students with disabilities.\n\nPlease note that neither students with disabilities nor students without disabilities can receive or retain an Excelsior Scholarship if they take longer to complete due to a change of majors or transfer to another college unless such change is a direct result of functional limitations resulting from the impairment that impacts the student’s ability to continue at the college or in the major. Specifically:\n\nFor individuals who have lost college credits due to a change in major or transfer of college, consideration for an award will only be given to students who provide medical documentation that clearly specifies that they (1) both (i) transferred to another college due to their disability or medical condition (e.g., the student must be cared for at home and, therefore, transferred to a college near their home) and (ii) changed majors, if applicable, because their previous major was not offered at their transfer college; or (2) were first diagnosed with their disability or medical condition after entering college/selecting their major, and their capacity to continue at that college or in pursuit of that major is or was limited by their disability or medical condition, resulting in the loss of credits.\n\nLearn more about your rights under the Americans with Disability Act of 1990."
