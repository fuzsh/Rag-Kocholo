        "text": "Purchase an article electronically using the British Library.\n\nMicrosoft said Friday Academic Search would be available in beta form before late September. The company declined to release details for Product Search, but said they would be forthcoming.\n\nIn an e-mail Friday, LiveSide’s Overd wrote that it seems Microsoft is “stacking up the services against Google.”\n\nMicrosoft also recently made available an image search for Windows Live that is similar to Google’s image search service.\n\nThe service, called Windows Live Image Search, allows users to search for images on the Web. It is available in both the United States and the United Kingdom by typing in a search term and clicking on “Image” to find images.\n\nYahoo also offers image searching as an option on its search homepage.\n\n-Elizabeth Montalbano, IDG News Service\n\nThis article is posted on our Microsoft Informer page. For more news on the Redmond, Wash.-based powerhouse, keep checking in.\n\nAlso, have a listen to CIO Publisher Gary Beach’s podcast on Microsoft’s upcoming operating system, Vista, as well as the topic of open source."
