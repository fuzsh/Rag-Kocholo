It was similar to Google Scholar, but rather than crawling the Internet for academic content, Live Search Academic search results came directly from trusted sources, such as publishers of academic journals.\n\nLive Search Academic was known as Windows Live Academic Search when the beta version was officially launched on April 11, 2006.
