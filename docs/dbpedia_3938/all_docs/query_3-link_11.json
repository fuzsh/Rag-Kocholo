        "text": "Bing, search engine launched in 2009 by the American software company Microsoft Corporation.\n\nMicrosoft’s previous search engine, Live Search, from the time of its release in 2006 consistently trailed well behind those of Google Inc., the industry giant, and the Internet portal site of Yahoo! Inc. Microsoft hoped to change the dynamics of the search-engine market with the release of Bing, a “decision engine” designed to display more retrieved information in search pages than was typical, thus enabling better-informed decisions concerning what links to follow or even, in some cases, displaying enough information to satisfy the original query. Bing also displayed related searches and the user’s previous searches on the left side of the page."
