This new page, which can be accessed from Lafayette’s homepage, contains numerous options for finding news about the College, including audio and video files, photos, articles, email, and the Lafayette Live search engine.\n\nLafayette’s web site includes thousands of news stories about student and faculty research, special projects, interesting courses, campus organizations, events and activities, performances, and much more.\n\nLive @ Lafayette goes a step further and offers ways to actually watch campus news through podcasts and photo slideshows. A podcast is an audio or video media file which is delivered over the Internet using RSS feed subscriptions. The podcasts can be viewed or listened to on Lafayette’s web site or they can be subscribed to through the College’s podcast feed by way of an aggregator like iTunes and downloaded to an MP3 player or personal computer. Podcast content will include many topics such as academics, community service projects, club sports, and student activities.\n\nThe photo slideshows called “A Day in the Life” will provide a look at student life and focus on many aspects of what makes Lafayette a unique place. Slide shows will range from events with world-renowned scholars to performances at the Williams Center for the Arts to students giving blood at Farinon College Center.\n\nLinks to Lafayette’s Calendar of Events, Campus News section, and local weather are also provided on the new web page. Through the Lafayette Live link, Lafayette news articles can be searched by academic major, athletic program, or by a student’s hometown.\n\nLive @ Lafayette also contains the subscription service for Lafayette news updates through email as well as the ability to download the College’s screensaver."
