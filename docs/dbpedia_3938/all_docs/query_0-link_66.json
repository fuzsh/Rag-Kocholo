        "text": "If you have hyperlinks in your document, changing their display text to ordinary language can make them much easier to understand for users who rely on screen-reading programs.\n\nHere’s a typical URL in the text of a document.\n\nFor a sighted user, this might seem fine.\n\nBut if you rely on a screen reader or text-to-speech program, it might read the URL out one letter at a time, like this:\n\n\"http://www.nps.gove/olym/planyourvisit/lodging.htm\"\n\nYou can make hyperlinks more accessible by changing their display text to something more natural and meaningful.\n\nJust right-click the hyperlink on the page and then choose Edit Hyperlink.\n\nWhen you select the link like this, Word automatically copies it into the Edit Hyperlink dialog. But we can change the display text to ordinary language that people -- and screen readers -- can more easily understand.\n\nIn the Text to display box, we’ll type “National Park Reservations”.\n\nAnd we’ll click OK.\n\nNow users who rely on screen-readers will have a much better idea of where this link is sending them.\n\nNational Parks Reservation link.\n\nOne last thing to keep in mind: When adding display text, avoid phrases like “Click here” or “Learn more”.\n\nPeople who rely on screen readers often browse a list of the article’s links to get an idea of its content.\n\nIf the display text for all those links is the same generic phrase, it could sound something like this:\n\n\"Click here, link. Click here, link, Click here, link.\"\n\nNot very helpful."
