Stardock, a duchy in the Kingdom of the Isles in Betrayal at Krondor, serves as the home of the Midkemian Academy of Magic on Sorcerer's Isle. The duchy is mentioned, but never visited, in the game.

Master Magician Pug conDoin holds the title of Duke of Stardock, and lives there with his family when not occupied elsewhere in the Kingdom.

Manual[]

The manual notes that Pug was awarded his land and title at Stardock to begin the Academy of Magic after his first return from Kelewan to Midkemia and adoption into the royal family. After the Great Rising, Pug began a program of informational exchange between the Academy and Kelewan's Assembly of Magicians, though withholding sensitive information about the Battle of Sethanon.
