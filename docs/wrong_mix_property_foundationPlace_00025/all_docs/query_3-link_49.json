        "text": "Livonia Residential Internet Coverage\n\nTucked between Detroit, Ann Arbor, and Dearborn, the city of Livonia has much to offer its residents and businesses. This is a mid-sized Michigan city that's home to about 96,000 residents.\n\nAT&T is a widespread internet service provider in this area, bringing DSL coverage to most of the city and fiber internet to a growing part of Livonia.\n\nThrough Windstream, almost everyone in Livonia has access to high-speed internet options. This ISP reaches neighborhoods like 6 Mile Road, Elm, and Middlebelt.\n\nThrough Brighthouse Networks, those living in central and northwestern Livonia have consistent internet access. Neighborhoods that fall in this company's service range include Fox Drive, Dardanella, and Newburgh.\n\nMany of Livonia's key neighborhoods can choose internet service packages through WOW! This ISP primarily services northeastern and southwestern Livonia.\n\nOne of the most sizable ISPs in Livonia is Eaglenet. This company has a service area that covers all of Livonia and many of its surrounding communities.\n\nMost helpful reviews\n\nOverall:\n\nService:\n\nKrystin L | 11-06-2018\n\nThis company is a joke. We set up service for a HD box and a DVR box the technician showed up without a DVR box and they couldn’t get one until Thursday. I called the customer service line because the tech said they couldn’t call them. The first woman told me they would waive the 49.99 install fee and then she transferred me to customer care where I spoke to a woman who was less than helpful. After waiting on hold for an hour and 16 minutes I was told “sorry we can’t waive the fee. Yep that’s it is there anything else I can help you with”. I said no you guys just lost a costumer and she said ok thank you and hung up. GREAT customer service. What a joke. NO ONE should switch to them.\n\nWas this review helpful? 121 4\n\nOverall:\n\nService:\n\nPricing:\n\nSpeed:\n\nDaniel S | 02-25-2017\n\nI have had Brighthouse for a very long time and have found that they have done a great job in keeping up with the changes in the internet overall. Service is excellent, never a charge for fixing what's wrong and always fixes the problem. We have a large family and are always pushing our internet to the limits. It is normal for us to have 4 Xbox One's running with 2 computers,5 Iphones, a couple tablets and a couple HDTV's running at the same time.Lag is rare and connection issues are very rare. Overall we LOVE what we have and can't see changing anything anytime soon!\n\nWas this review helpful? 6 16\n\nOverall:\n\nService:\n\nPricing:\n\nSpeed:\n\nGiovanna D | 07-29-2023\n\nI’ve been with no tv, landline or internet connection going on 3 full days today. Calling the service center is a big joke. Apparently the engineers have not updated the service centers with any updates since this outage has happened. I’ll be taking my business to a different and more reliable company. My rates seem to have increased as well and service given is terrible. Not happy at alll\n\nWas this review helpful? 2 0"
