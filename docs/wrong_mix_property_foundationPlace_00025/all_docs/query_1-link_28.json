With resources that deplete over time creating fierce competition, you will have to adapt to the new environment faster than your opponents do in order to survive. Life support is so strenuous on Io that Mars will look like a paradise in comparison!\n\nWith two brand new factions, a new resource system, a new multiplayer “Infinite Map Challenge,” new patents, buildings, black market items, and much more, Jupiter’s Forge is a must-have addition for your Offworld Trading Company experience.\n\nStardock Community Discount\n\nGet 10% off when you buy direct from us. You’ll get a Steam key to add to your library and can start playing right away!"
