        "text": "We have a little over a week before the 1st day of school. I know there is a lot of anxiety and fear of the unknown with what this year will bring. But what I do know is that we have some of the best PTA units around who are dedicated to making this year great no matter what! Some of you are getting creative, and it's refreshing to see. We need to adapt to this new normal (hopefully it won't be normal much longer) and we need to continue working together and helping each other. So if your unit has come up with some great ideas on virtual events or safe in-person events, I encourage you to share them on the Officer's Forum Facebook page. This year, more than any other year, we need each other's ideas and guidance. Sharing is caring after all!\n\nI'm wishing you all and your kiddos a happy first day of school! I'm also wishing our LPS staff, teachers, and leaders a happy first day as well! I know this has been a trying time for everyone, so remember to give yourself some grace as well as others.\n\nStay healthy,\n\nAndrea Malenfant\n\nCouncil Newsletter Chair\n\nHello everyone!\n\nAs the new school year quickly approaches, I'd like to take a moment and inform you about the changes to this year's Membership dues. Council has voted to change the dues each unit pays to Council for their members. You no longer need to send Council $0.50 per member each month. Instead, you will submit a one time payment of $100 (Niji-Iro and Jackson Center submit $75) for your member dues. This payment is due to Council by October 28, 2020. I have uploaded the new Remittance form, which can also be used as an invoice, in the Membership and President's hubs within Memberhub. Please note, this change is ONLY for Council dues. All payments and dues owed to MI PTA still need to be submitted by the 28th of every month.\n\nIn order to make these changes, Council made an amendment to our bylaws stating this change. Please review your bylaws to make sure they are within compliance. Since this change is coming down to you from Council, you will not need to post these changes for 30 days prior to presenting it to your members. The changes will, however, need to be reflected within your unit's bylaws.\n\nSince the school year is starting virtually, getting your members to purchase a membership may be a bit trickier than normal. A great way to reach your members and have them purchase a membership is by utilizing your school's Memberhub Store. However, Memberhub has changed their payment system and no longer uses WePay. They are now using a program called Stripe. Each treasurer will need to make sure their new Stripe account is properly set up and ready to go. If you plan to use your Memberhub Store, please make sure your treasurer has made this change.\n\nI'm really looking forward to this school year. We all know this year will be a whole new experience for all of us, and I look forward to seeing the creativity from each and every one of you! If you have any membership questions, please feel free to email me at membership@livoniaptsacouncil.org.\n\nSara Bennett\n\nLivonia PTSA Council Membership Chair\n\nI joined the Livonia PTA Council as a Board Member in 1997 and have served as President, Vice President, Secretary & Chair of various committees. I currently serve as the Council Liaison for the Clothing Depot. I first joined PTA as a parent at Tyler Elementary in 1985. I was recruited to join the Tyler PTA Board as their Tyler 4’s Pre-school Leader, and I never looked back. I went on to serve on Livonia PTA/PTSA Local Boards as the chair of various committees, VP, Treasurer, Secretary, and as President of Tyler Elementary, Holmes Middle School and Stevenson High School. I also served on the Michigan PTSA Board of Managers from 1996-2005 in various officer postions.\n\nI truly enjoyed being active in PTA, and this lead me to also becoming more active in our community. I was on the LPS School Board for 8.5 years, the Livonia Planning Commission for five years, the Livonia City Council for two years, and I am in my fifth year as the City of Livonia Treasurer. I also serve as VP of the Livonia Brownfield Authority and as a LPS Education Foundation Board Member.\n\nMy husband Doug and I live in the house that my parents built in Livonia. (I went to Tyler, Bryant and Stevenson). We enjoy camping, hiking, reading, and spending time with our three adult children (and their spouses) and our seven grandchildren.\n\nStandards of Affiliation are requirements from MI PTA that keep a unit in good standing and therefore allows the unit to continue to conduct business. All SOA requirements are due to MI PTA no later than December 1st. All units that have completed the SOA requirements will receive their letter of Good Standing from Michigan PTA in MemberHub. Not sure what the requirements are? Check it out:\n\nOfficers\n\nEach year, officers should be updated in MemberHub. When Michigan PTA contacts officers, only the current year officers are pulled by the system. If they can't contact the leaders responsible for business, they can’t service the unit properly.\n\nMembers and Membership Dues\n\nEach Michigan PTA Unit is asked to submit names and payments for Michigan and National PTA dues. Entering names into MemberHub does NOT make the person a member. Members have to be entered specifically as members and not just people. $5.50 per each member should be sent to MI PTA either by check or electronically through Memberhub by the 28th of each month.\n\nUnit Renewal Dues\n\nUnit renewal dues of $40 which covers the administrative costs of processing standards of affiliation are due each year on June 1st. This year the deadline has been extended to October 1st due to the COVID - 19 situation.\n\nBylaws\n\nEach unit must have bylaws. Bylaws are the rules that govern your unit. Bylaws must be renewed every three years or any time they are amended. Renewed bylaws must be submitted through MemberHub for approval from MI PTA. Units waiting on approval from MI PTA are considered in compliance for bylaws until otherwise notified.\n\nBudget\n\nA new budget must be created each year and should be voted on and approved by the membership. An approved budget should be sent to MI PTA via MemberHub.\n\nFinancial Review or Audit\n\nAn audit is a way to track your unit's finances. Council holds an audit party each year so units do not have to find and independent CPA, although a unit can choose to go that route. Audits should be completed after the fiscal year ends and a copy should be sent to MI PTA via MemberHub.\n\n990\n\nEach year, Units must submit to the IRS their 990 and then should submit a copy to MI PTA via MemberHub. Most Units only have to submit the 990N postcard which is about 8 questions on the IRS website. This should be done immediately! Since our fiscal year ends June 30th, the 990 must be submitted to the IRS no later than November 15th.\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/annual-electronic-filing-requirement-for-small-exempt-organizations-form-990-n-e-postcard\n\nFailure to submit this documentation to the IRS will put a unit’s tax exempt status in jeopardy—even if you fulfill everything else required by Michigan PTA.\n\nA copy should also be sent to MI PTA via Memberhub no later than December 1st.\n\nLiability Insurance\n\nInsurance is a fairly new requirement for SOA. Every policy may be different but MI PTA requires that units get at least $1 million in liability coverage. Coverage for officers and coverage to protect you in case you have to cancel big events can also be considered. Officers may compare companies to get the best coverage for the Unit. This is a Michigan PTA requirement and a copy of your insurance certificate should be sent to MI PTA via MemberHub by December 1st.\n\nIf you have questions about SOA you can contact your Council Liaison or cal MI PTA at 734-975-9500\n\nAfter contemplating the role the Diversity & Inclusion Committee and the PTA in general will be playing in this unique year, I decided that it would be a good idea to get some feedback from students and families. I've created a survey that will help us understand how our families are feeling and how they would like the PTA to support them. I would like to ask you to share this survey with the families at your schools. I'll share the results, so that you can take it into consideration as you plan your year.\n\nSurvey link: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Z6F9ZCD\n\nI'm also looking for people who would like to join me on the Diversity & Inclusion Committee. I have lots of ideas, but could use a few warm hearts to help make things happen. Please let me know if you're interested.\n\nI believe the PTA has a great opportunity to transform the way we support our families this year. Our role as advocates has never been needed more.\n\nThanks in advance for your assistance!\n\nDebbie Yates\n\nLivonia PTSA Council Diversity & Inclusion Committee\n\nThe question has been asked; Do we need to change our bylaws or policies & procedures to include virtual meetings? Here is some guidance from MI PTA Secretary Liz Jarvis from MI PTA's NewsFlash:\n\nIs your unit holding virtual meetings? What do your bylaws say about it? In most cases, the answer is, “nothing.” Currently, there isn't language in our State or in the local unit bylaws template to prohibit the use of virtual meetings, unless a local unit has added it in their local unit bylaws or standing rules. As a non-profit, membership organization, in addition to the local unit, State and National PTA bylaws, there is the Michigan Nonprofit Corporation Act (Act 162 of 1982). It contains no restrictions which would preclude virtual meetings. It is important to note that PTA units are not bound by the Open Meetings Act, unlike school boards or municipal government bodies. Your rules for a virtual meeting should be similar to your rules for an inperson meeting. Your bylaws give parameters for “meetings” without differentiating between in-person or virtual. We recommend that your unit have standing rules, which outline the “day-to-day” activities of your unit. Guidelines for your virtual meetings can be included there. In addition to rules about how and when a meeting is called, they might include guidelines such as:\n\nEveryone should be able to be heard\n\nMinutes must be taken\n\nWhether to include chat notes in the minutes\n\nVoting may require a roll call for any official business\n\nProxy voting is not allowed\n\nSo, Zoom away! If you are satisfied that your bylaws regarding minutes covers your virtual meetings as well, you are all set. If you would like to create a set of Standing Rules (also called Policies and Procedures) we can help you get started. If your unit/council would like to request the use of the MiPTA Zoom account to hold a business meeting, please send the request to outreachsupportvp@mighicanpta.org to reserve that date/time.\n\nElection Day is Tuesday November 3rd. The LPS Board of Education will have 4 open seats on the ballot. The PTSA Council will Host a Candidate Forum for our members to learn about the Candidates. There are 6 candidates running; the 4 incumbents and 2 newcomers…\n\n- Madeline Acosta\n\n- Tammy Bonifeld (I)\n\n- Karen Bradford (I)\n\n- Dan Centers (I)\n\n- Crystal Frank (I)\n\n- Nichole Hoskins-Goudreau\n\nBecause of the current COVID situation, we will not be able to host with a live, in-person format. The Forum will be Virtual (conducted by Zoom), with only the Candidates and several Council Members (to moderate and ask questions) attending. PTA Members will be able to participate by submitting questions to ask the Candidates. A recording of the Forum will be posted online afterwards for anyone to watch. The details of the Forum are still being finalized. The target date is the last week of September or the first week of October. We will communicate the details as soon as possible and will request support from our local PTAs to help promote. If you have any questions, please reach out to Mike Testa (advocacy@livoniaptsacouncil.org)."
