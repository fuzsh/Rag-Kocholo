Award for Strategy/Simulation Game of the YearCountryUnited StatesPresented byAcademy of Interactive Arts & SciencesFirst awarded1998Currently held byDune: Spice WarsWebsitewww .interactive .org\n\nThe D.I.C.E. Award for Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year is an award presented annually by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences during the D.I.C.E. Awards. This award recognizes games \"in which user directs or manipulates resources to create a set of conditions that result in success as determined within the confines of the game. These games can offer the user the chance to simulate or to virtually reproduce an experience, real or imaginary, which would require some form of equipment. Strategy games emphasize the planning of tactics rather than the execution\".[1] All active creative/technical, business, and affiliate members of the Academy are qualified to vote for this category.[2] Originally, there were separate awards for strategy games and simulation games, which simulate aspects of the real world.[3][4]\n\nThe award's most recent winner is Dune: Spice Wars, developed and published by Shiro Games and co-published with Funcom.\n\nInitially the Interactive Achievement Awards had separate awards for Computer Strategy Game of the Year and Computer Simulation Game of the Year.[3][4] The categories would then be merged into Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year in 2008.[1]\n\nComputer Strategy Game of the Year (1998—2004)\n\nComputer Simulation Game of the Year (1998—2004)\n\nStrategy Game of the Year (2005—2007)\n\nSimulation Game of the Year (2005—2007)\n\nStrategy/Simulation Game of the Year (2008—present)\n\nThere was a tie between Age of Empires and StarCraft for Computer Strategy Game of the Year at the 1st Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.\n\nTable key Indicates the winner\n\nYear Game Developer(s) Publisher(s) Ref. 1997/1998\n\n(1st) Computer Strategy Game of the Year[a] [5][6][7] Age of Empires Ensemble Studios Microsoft StarCraft Blizzard Entertainment Blizzard Entertainment Command & Conquer Gold Westwood Studios Virgin Interactive Sid Meier's Gettysburg!
