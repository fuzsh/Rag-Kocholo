        "text": "The Antec C8 represents the largest of the Constellation series dual-chamber enclosures. The C8 manages to impress with a down-to-earth design, focus on functionality, and plenty of details that make the build process and final result very positive.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 5 8500G is a highly affordable Socket AM5 processor. It features the Phoenix 2 core, which combines the Zen 4 and Zen 4c architecture, for improved energy efficiency. In our review we test gaming performance with both integrated graphics and a discrete graphics card.\n\nThe INNOCN 32M2V is a 32-inch gaming monitor equipped with a 4K Quantum Dot IPS panel and a 1,152-zone Mini-LED backlight system. As such, it's fully equipped for an impressive HDR gaming experience. Even more intriguing is its price: it costs less than half of what you'd normally have to pay for a similarly specced panel.\n\nBeing the successor to the original Lift, the ambidextrous Lift 2 Symm comes with PixArt's PAW3395 sensor, optical main buttons switches, and true 8000 Hz polling, for a wallet-friendly $49.99. Its 55 g weight is achieved by utilizing an open-bottom design with a solid shell.\n\nThis article serves as a continuously updated summary of currently known leaks and official announcements regarding upcoming hardware releases in 2024 and beyond. We cover and keep track of developments for Intel Arrow Lake, AMD Zen 5, NVIDIA's and AMD's upcoming GPUs, DDR6 and GDDR7 memory, chipsets and more.\n\nThe GamaKay TK75HE builds upon its successful TK75 series with magnetic Hall effect switches. It features two first party linear switches that offer customizable actuation force and even multiple keystrokes per switch. Software control for fine-tuning, extensive onboard customization, and RGB lighting complete the feature set.\n\nThe Audeze MM-500 is a debuting entry from a new product line of open-back planar magnetic headphones designed with the working professional in mind. Developed in collaboration with renowned mixing artist Manny Marroquin, the MM-500 offers highly detailed and accurate playback paired with excellent build quality too.\n\nNoctua's much-anticipated replacement for the venerable NH-D15 has arrived. Dubbed the NH-D15 G2, it’s not just a simple refresh. While the name remains familiar, the design has been completely re-engineered, resulting in top-tier performance—at a hefty price.\n\nThe Alphacool Core 1 LT is a more affordable take on the successful Core 1 series of CPU water blocks. It ditches the metal tops in favor of acetal or acrylic, but retains the same cooling engine to give you chart-topping performance paired with cleaner aesthetics and/or better RGB lighting at a lower price.\n\nWeighing 55 g, the ambidextrous AX5 Pro Max comes with a magnesium alloy shell. Equipped with PixArt's PAW3395 sensor, the AX5 Pro Max is capable of both Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz, achieving up to 130 hours of battery life, along with 8000 Hz wired and wireless polling.\n\nAMD has finally shared technical details for their next-gen Zen 5 microarchitecture, which will power the new Ryzen 9000 desktop processors and the Ryzen AI 300 Series laptop CPUs. We detail all the technical innovations, including overclocking, and how AMD achieved +16% IPC.\n\nJelly Key's latest take on the popular Dragons of Eden artisan keycap theme includes the Cherry keycap profile for the first time ever, in addition to SA and the Droplet profile. The former two feature Dragon elements which jut out of the keycap to guarantee a stunning visual and user experience no matter the design or size chosen.\n\nHIFIMAN's new planar magnetic flagship is one of the boldest designs ever made. The Susvara Unveiled builds upon the already-excellent Susvara and ditches the grilles for a fully open-back design aiming to improve sound quality and accuracy. It also has more efficient updated drivers tuned to be more engaging than before.\n\nID-Cooling dominates the competition with the FROZN A620 PRO SE. By forgoing ARGB lighting and excessive visual accents, they've created a cooler that offers a combination of performance and value bordering on unbelievable. At less than $30 it even offers better price/performance than Thermalright.\n\nThe HighPoint Rocket 1608A is a PCIe Gen 5 controller card that lets you add up to eight Gen 5 drives. Performance is truly incredible, we were able to measure raw sequential speeds of over 56 GB/s in our review.\n\nCorsair enters the thick LCP fan market with the RS120 MAX. True to its name, it adopts a 120x120x30 mm form factor and large LCP blades that get real close to the frame to maximize airflow. A novel stator vane design and magnetic bearing helps keep noise low to make for a compelling PC DIY watercooling fan.\n\nAt a budget-friendly $50, the right-handed ergonomic Lift 2 Ergo comes with PixArt's PAW3395 sensor, optical main button switches, true 8000 Hz polling, and pure PTFE feet. Its 58 g weight is achieved by utilizing an open-bottom design with a solid shell.\n\nFiiO aims at the premium IEM market with its flagship FA19 earphones. These use 10 balanced armature drivers with some clever acoustic engineering to put out an esoteric tuning that works very well for vocals and some music genres similar to high-end offerings from others.\n\nThe First Descendant is a first-person looter-shooter with support for up to four players working together cooperatively. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the graphics look great, but hardware requirements are definitely not on the light side. In our performance review, we're taking a closer look at image quality, VRAM usage, and performance on a wide selection of modern graphics cards.\n\nAMD's new FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.1 update (FSR 3.1) features improvements to upscaling quality and Frame Generation. It is now possible to run FSR Frame Generation without any upscaling, or combine it with DLSS, which finally gives GeForce 30 gamers a feasible framegen option.\n\nThe Gigabyte GS34WQC is an affordable 34-inch ultrawide gaming monitor. Gigabyte kept the price down by stripping it of extras but didn't sacrifice picture quality, which many users will happily accept.\n\nLian Li is set to capitalize on the LCD AIO trend with the HydroShift LCD 360S. This product boasts new and innovative features, including pre-routed tubing, a simplified wiring setup, and a bright LCD panel, complementing its attractive visual aesthetic. Its solid performance and a six-year warranty further demonstrate that it's much more than a one-trick pony.\n\nWeighing no more than 49 g, the ambidextrous OP1 8K promises exceptionally low latency, owing to its 8000 Hz polling rate and custom Kailh GX main button switches, which reduce actuation latency even further. PixArt's PAW3395 sensor is used, along with pure PTFE feet and a particularly flexible cable.\n\nThe Corsair MP600 Mini 2 TB SSD delivers outstanding storage performance for the Steam Deck, thanks to its TLC flash and the new Phison E27T controller. While pricing is a bit high, it might be acceptable for people looking to get the best out of their portable console."
