        "text": "Stardock today released a major upgrade to ObjectDock, which is now part of the Object Desktop utility suite and works with both Windows 10 and Windows 11.\n\nLike its predecessor, ObjectDock 3 provides a highly customizable and animated dock, similar to that on macOS, that lets you quickly access apps, files, and other shortcuts. You can use it alongside the Windows Taskbar and Start menu—unlike those interfaces, it can be accessed from any screen edge—or as a replacement. You can also create multiple docks, each on its own screen edge.\n\nBut there are some significant changes in this release too. It now works with both Windows 10 and 11, and Stardock now includes it as part of Object Desktop, too, as noted above. The app is now fully 64-bit and features other under-the-hood improvements, supports high-resolution displays and docking UWP apps, and offers improved animations like zoom.\n\nAs before, ObjectDock is just $9.99, and existing customers can upgrade for $3.99. This is standalone software, not a subscription, and your ObjectDock license is good for use on up to 5 PCs simultaneously."
