Interestingly, Livonia is named after Livonia, New York due to the European- American migrants who settled there from New England and New York. And how many cities can claim to have six U.S presidents as past residents? Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have all lived in the city at one point in their lives.\n\nThe rich history of Livonia is just one of the reasons senior citizens and their families will find this such an appealing place to live.
