        "text": "The commercial management and leasing company invested in a solar panel project last year that will generate 30 percent of the energy needed to power the four-story Cambridge Center on the corner of Six Mile and Quakertown.\n\nThe environmental focus is a long-term attraction for future tenants, particularly larger companies, said Brady Blain, the vice president for The Blain Group.\n\nâWe had a large part of a parking lot that went unused for years so this gave us a chance to redevelop this space,â said Blain, who added that federal solar tax incentives also made the investment worthwhile.\n\nThe five rows of double-sided solar panels, which are expected to last about 30 years, are expected to save the company about $20,000 a year in energy costs to support the 125,000-square-foot building.\n\nThe Blain Group was established by Brady Blainâs father, James, in the early-1980s when he purchased land, designed, and constructed three office buildings along Six Mile east of Haggerty which includes Cambridge Center, one-story AmeriCenter of Livonia, and two-story Cambridge West. The three buildings are home to 100 full-time and 130 virtual tenants.\n\nThese three buildings are part of the companyâs 10-property portfolio in Michigan and elsewhere.\n\nThis award is presented annually by the Livonia Greenleaf Commission on Sustainability.\n\nJane Muszynski, a Certified Personal Trainer will be honored as the Livonia-Westland Chamberâs Ambassador of the Year as the organizationâs leading volunteer. As an active Ambassador for the past seven years, she supports the Chamber at grand openings, chamber events, and other duties promoting the chamber and business in the community.\n\nThis is the second time sheâs won the award, also earning the honor in 2019.\n\nMuszynski earned a Michigan State University degree in retail management and worked in the industry for two decades until she pursued a career change eight years ago when she studied personal training and fitness nutrition and started her own company, Spitfire Training.\n\nShe is also the program coordinator for MI Work Matters, a non-profit organization that supports Anastasia and Katieâs Coffee Shop & CafÃ© in Livonia. She is an active volunteer for many causes, including Mt. Hope Congregational Church, where she leads a womenâs service group and sings in the choir, The Fox Theater as an usher, and she serves on boards for People Driven Credit Union and Livonia Kids & Families.\n\nâA beautiful by-product of being an Ambassador has been the relationships I have built,â Muszynski said. âItâs like having a second family with people who support you personally and professionally, share your passion as a business owner, and encourage you when you need it most.â\n\nMuszynski and husband, Dan, have been married for 25 years and live in Livonia. They have two children, Madison, 23, a graduate of Wayne State University, and Mac, 19, a freshman at Schoolcraft College.\n\nBob Genord started Foundation Systems of Michigan, a company that fixes cracks in a crawl space or basement â out of his basement in 2007.\n\nBy taking time to explain the job of fixing a hidden problem to customers, and doing it well, he quickly grew the business and moved into a larger building three times within five years, reaching its current Livonia site on Schoolcraft near Farmington.\n\nâWhen a customer sees a crack in their basement wall, it can be scary,â said Marie Lambertson, Genordâs sister and FSM marketing director. âHe always took the time to assure a customer that foundation repairs are common and fixable. The time spent to educate customers and ease their worries, helped with referrals, and grow the business.â\n\nThe growth continued with FSM as it reached customers across the state. In 2014, it added a Traverse City office, and in 2017, it expanded into another Livonia building to provide 75,000-square feet to serve as its headquarters.\n\nGenord retired and sold FSM in July 2020 to Groundworks, a Virgina-based company that is the nationâs largest privately owned foundation services operation with locations in at least 24 states. Groundworks is the parent company, but Foundation Systems of Michigan maintained its local identity and it continued to grow.\n\nFSM added a Grand Rapids office in 2021 and Rochester Hills in 2023. The company employs more than 120 people at its Livonia headquarters, and a total of 300 people across its four Michigan locations. Together, they repair at least 5,000 homes a year.\n\nNew general manager Jason Matthews said he remains committed to the philosophies that Genord used to build the company.\n\nâWe just donât hire anybody,â Matthews said. âWe need people who have quality in the work, can articulate well, and value the customer. It still comes down to customer service.â\n\nFor these practices, FSM received the Better Business Bureauâs Torch Award for Ethics in 2023.\n\nIn the last year alone, the company gave back with contributions to the Livonia Goodfellows, the Western Wayne location for the Foster Closet of Michigan, donated new shoes to 200 children via the Starfish Family Services program, and provided resources and volunteers to a Habitat for Humanity house build in Howell.\n\nLeda and Ledion âEddieâ Shahu separately fled the corruption and crime that was rampant in Albania in the 1990s to pursue better economic opportunities here in the United States.\n\nThey met as co-workers at an Eight Mile Road restaurant, married in 1999 and found a home in Livonia.\n\nTwo years later, the couple purchased a diner in a strip center of Five Mile and Middlebelt and opened Ledaâs Coney Island with a focus on fresh ingredients as the menu evolved.\n\nâWe had worked in restaurants so we thought we would take the opportunity to try it ourselves,â Eddie Shahu said. âI took some business management classes in college in Albania.â\n\nThe couple did the cooking, cleaning, building renovations, and often both worked 16-hour days because they only had a budget for one more employee in the beginning. During their 23 years in business, as they assimilated to American life, they started a family that included two busy children involved in travel sports, they endured two bleak economic periods with the Great Recession (2007-10) and Covid-19 (2020-21), and they took in Eddieâs aging parents seven years ago.\n\nThe 55-seat restaurant is busy these days with customers who enjoy its homemade breakfast dishes, chicken lemon rice soup, Greek dressing, and hot sauce.\n\nThe Shahuâs found time and resources to support the Livonia Junior Athletic League, Stevenson High School, youth hockey, and the Livonia Kids and Families Tour de Livonia event, in addition to frequently providing gift certificates and food donations to various community causes.\n\nWith their children, Shaun, 20, a student and football player at Saginaw Valley State University; and Gracie, 17, a senior basketball player at Stevenson, the couple wanted them to learn about community, teamwork, and respect through sports and follow an example they strived to set. They also have a five-year-old son, Luke.\n\nâAs parents and in business,â Leda Shahu said, âwe say to try, try and donât give up and always look at the big picture to realize that things are good, and you just keep doing what you are doing.â\n\nThe couple said they are grateful for the carry-out business maintained by friends and customers during the prolonged Covid restrictions that enabled their business to survive.\n\nâOur kids were born in Livonia, which has given so much to them and to us, so we want to give back to the community we love,â said Eddie Shahu, who was a professional basketball player and member of the U-21 Albanian national team before he immigrated here.\n\nAfter 29 years of work in a hospital lab and medical equipment sales, Cheryl Doelker was looking to start her own business when her college-age sons made her aware of a popular sandwich shop on campus.\n\nThis led to Wayne Countyâs first Jimmy Johnâs Restaurant on Six Mile near Newburgh in Livonia, opened by Doelker and her husband, Jeff, in 2001. While bringing customers in was important, Doelker also found it important to mentor the young people who worked in her shops.\n\nâI felt a responsibility to support the many kids who are working their first job here,â she said. âI wanted a strategy where we trained and mentored our young staff so they would have a good first-job experience. I guess I am a teacher, deep down.â\n\nThe focus on customer service, mentoring and community involvement enabled the Doelkers to grow their business to nine locations: Five in Livonia, two in Canton, one in Plymouth and one in Northville. As the business grew, they grew their support and involvement in the community. They often provided sandwiches and gift certificates to school and youth events, and other charities that helped those in need. During Covid closures, they provided food for first responders and children who didnât have access to school meals.\n\nThey made contributions to numerous local charities such as Emily and Griffin Foundation, PB&J Foundation, Livonia Symphony Orchestra, Livonia Kids and Families, and Livonia Save our Youth.\n\nIn recent years, Cheryl Doelker often volunteered at various career and mentoring programs, Tour de Livonia bike ride, events that supported Livonia and Clarenceville schools, and as an active leader and\n\nvolunteer for the Livonia-Westland Chamber of Commerce. The family business was recognized as the Outstanding Large Business of the Year in 2018.\n\nâThe community was so good to us, so we wanted to give back,â she said. âWe were always interested in helping young people because they were such a part of our success.â\n\nIt became a family venture when the coupleâs twin sons, Dan and Rich, began working with them to grow the business after college graduation. âWatching our kids, and all the kids who worked and grew here, was rewarding,â she added.\n\nThe couple were high school sweethearts from their days at Westland John Glenn High School and lived in Livonia for 30 years. They also have two grandchildren.\n\nAfter 22 years in a business that involved hiring and mentoring 1,800 teen workers, the Doelkers sold their nine Jimmy Johns franchises last fall to pursue retirement from work, but not from community involvement.\n\nJohn Del Signore has been a successful entrepreneur by providing good times and good food at several Livonia locations for 60 years.\n\nHe was born and raised in Italy and lived his early years in Venezuela where he joined other relatives in working in construction. He returned to Italy in 1958 to marry his beloved Lina but left a short time later to go to Michigan to work at a cousinâs restaurant, then later another place in Livonia. Lina joined him four years later.\n\nIn 1964, the Del Signores sold their home to finance their first business, DiGiovanniâs Pizzeria, near Six Mile and Farmington. After four years, they sold the pizzeria and later purchased a small restaurant called Italian Hut on Plymouth Road.\n\nIn 1974, they demolished this site and constructed a new, larger restaurant named for their hometown, Fonte dâAmore. It became one of Livoniaâs signature restaurants with its variety of fine Italian dishes and distinct atmosphere for 38 years before they sold the business.\n\nIn 1988, the family opened Laurel Manor Banquet and Conference Center on Schoolcraft Road, which became one of metro Detroitâs largest banquet facilities. It is managed today by the coupleâs son, Luciano, with semi-retired support from John.\n\nThe success of the businesses led to expansive philanthropy through the years. They also developed a popular annual wild game dinner which raised money for the Tino Del Signore Foundation, named\n\nfor the coupleâs late son. This provided support to local hospitals, veteran causes, drug treatment programs, renovations to the coupleâs hometown church in Italy, and many churches, schools, charities, and non-profit organizations in and around Livonia. John Del Signore was an active member of the Livonia Rotary Club for many years.\n\nâLivonia has been our city: We grew up here, we grew our family here,â he said. âIt has been great to us.â\n\nJohn and Lina Del Signore, who have lived in Livonia since 1966, will celebrate their 66th wedding anniversary on March 9. Their four children led to eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n\nJohn Hiltz basically grew up learning how to make communities a better place.\n\nHe started working on road projects during summers as a high school student at the Livonia company his great uncle started, and his father grew. John took OHM Advisors, a community advancement firm focused on engineering, architecture, and planning, to new heights during his 12-year tenure as CEO.\n\nThe Redford Bishop Borgess High School alumnus earned a civil engineering degree from the University of Michigan and started working full-time at OHM in 1983 where he worked his way through the ranks until he became CEO in 2008. Under his leadership, the company grew from three offices in two states and 180 employees to 18 offices in four states and more than 650 employees. He also evolved into a respected voice advocating for the importance to invest in infrastructure improvements in the states OHM serves.\n\nHe left the CEO role to be board chair in 2020, and recently stepped down from that role and full-time work and now serves as a semi-retired consultant for the company.\n\nAlong the way, he shared his time and resources by helping his community and advancing his industry. He finished an interim term on the Livonia Board of Education, chaired fundraising efforts for the National Kidney Foundation of Michigan, served on the Livonia Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, Marywood Nursing Care Center Board, Plymouth Road Development Authority, and several trade industry boards.\n\nHe continues his role as chair of the Livonia Community Foundation Board and support for the Cornerstone Schools, both organizations he has served for many years.\n\nIn professional and volunteer ventures, Hiltz has long advocated for collaboration and mentorship to help people achieve career success and communities thrive.\n\nâIt is my belief that if youâve been blessed in your life and career, you should give back and make it a better place for tomorrow by putting in the effort today,â Hiltz said. âAs you get older, you want to support a good community and a good industry.â\n\nJohn and his wife of 39 years, Debbie, have lived in Livonia for more than 30 years. The couple have three grown children and six grandchildren.\n\nOften at a charity event in Livonia, you will see Holli Kerkhof peddling raffle tickets to support the cause of the day. As she approaches people with a smile, she will remind them they are gathered for a reason.\n\nShe is also selling drink tickets at Livonia Spree, handing out supplies to children in need, passing out hygiene and food packages to veterans, volunteering time to help causes like D.O. It For Denny and Seedings Braille Books, serving as Livonia-Westland Chamber of Commerce ambassador, and leading the PTA at Coolidge Elementary School.\n\nThis omnipresent volunteer found joy in helping others as a tribute to friends and neighbors who came to her familyâs aid after her father lost his job one fall. She was the oldest of six children in her family who received holiday meals and gifts that year thanks to the generosity of others who rallied to support them.\n\nShortly after her graduation from Wayne Memorial High School, Kerkhof started working at credit unions and volunteering for Relay for Life cancer fundraisers. She has been the Livonia branch manager for Community Choice Credit Union since 2010.\n\nHer job is to find business, and in the process, she finds causes to support. She is a member of the Livonia Lions and Livonia Rotary clubs. She coordinates an annual effort, with credit union help, to donate backpacks with school supplies to 400 students.\n\nâIt seems like one thing always leads to another,â she said. âSo many groups have needs, and I like to get my hands dirty and help them if I can.â\n\nCommunity awareness is a philosophy for the Kerkhof family, who have lived in Livonia for six years. Her husband of 18 years, Kory, started a woodworking business in 2020, Kerkhof Creations, where a percentage of sales from the wood furniture he builds goes to a pet charity. Holli and her 10-year-old son Ben make dog toys and blankets to support the same charity.\n\nKerkhof met D.O. it for Denny founder Sami McKay, the 2023 recipient of the Livonia First Citizen Award, who said the duo has become friends through their volunteer projects since 2018.\n\nâI am so thankful for the light Holli brings to this community,â she said.\n\nShe long engaged in random acts of kindness, where she would often buy multiple items sold to benefit a charity and give them to others: Some friends, some strangers.\n\nThis practice reached another level of intensity after a family tragedy six years ago when her 22-year-old stepson, also named Kory, took his life. Enduring this heartbreak directed her attention to mental health issues, and she realized that any kind gesture could discourage a distressed person from making such a final decision. This motivated her to pay the bill for someone in a drive-through line and do favors for others.\n\nâWe do this knowing that every little gesture can make a difference,â Kerkhof said.\n\nTo expand this effort, she coordinates people around World Kindness Day in November to cover tabs at grocery stores, restaurants, and providing treats to first responders.\n\nâIf you do enough ordinary things, they can have an extraordinary impact,â she said. âWe donât have a lot of money, so we try to incorporate giving back into everyday life.â\n\nElementary Educator of the YearÂ Â\n\n2023-2024Â\n\nAmy Chapman-PintaÂ Â\n\nAmy Chapman-Pinta is a 24-year veteran educator in Livonia Public Schools, where she has served the past nine years as an Elementary Support Teacher at Grant Elementary School.Â Â\n\nAs an EST, she provides caring and personalized support to students who have a variety of needs, including medical issues that can have an impact on a childâs school day. When she is not managing medical plans for students, she provides academic, social-emotional and behavioral support. For many students at Grant Elementary, she is their âgo toâ trusted adult at the school. She makes them feel safe, cared for, and is truly committed to their physical wellbeing as well as their emotional and academic growth.Â Â\n\nAmy is known as a âfloor sweeper,â who stands at-the-ready to jump into any situation and offer her assistance.
