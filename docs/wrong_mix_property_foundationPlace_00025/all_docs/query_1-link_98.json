        "text": "With our state on lockdown, our offices are empty.\n\nThis gives me a rare opportunity to give a little tour of our offices with almost no one here.\n\nA little bit about Stardock\n\nSo I started Stardock from my dorm room back in 1991 and incorporated it in 1993. The building we’re in now, we bought in 2005. We own it, so we are able to do whatever we want with it. It’s about 20,000 square feet and we’ve had the opportunity to try out various working area styles.\n\nThe Welcoming Committee\n\nAs you enter the main lobby of Stardock...\n\nThis is Cheesecake. An essential employee. We allow dogs at work.\n\nStardock has 3 floors. This is the lower floor in an area called Lab-2 (Lab-1 is upstairs). The team is working from home. We let people check out their PCs and take them home.\n\nThis is also part of Lab-2. Lab-2 has the workstation area. It’s not an open floor plan, but rather a hybrid, where everyone gets their own workstation area. There are also 3 offices connected to it – Senior Producer (oversees schedule) – Senior Publisher (oversees the “biz” side) and Senior Designer (the lead designer on the project). We mix the artists and engineers together so that they can work seamlessly together.\n\nThis is the office I’m occupying down here. I’m currently on a new project that won’t be ready for a couple years. This is the first time I’ve been the senior designer on a game project since GalCiv II from the start.\n\nThis is part of our Cafe.\n\nSitting area for the Cafe. The nice thing about this area is that there’s a presentation area up front.\n\nThis is on the main floor. This is where the Impulse team used to be back in 2011. We occasionally use it for podcasts, but it’s been unfilled since 2011.\n\nAlso on main floor. Has been empty since we sold Impulse to GameStop.\n\nBiz Conference room. I spend a lot of time here, unfortunately.\n\nThe fitness room. Empty. So sad.\n\nMy office. Empty now that I’ve moved to the senior designer office.\n\nGamer’s Bill of Rights.\n\nWife and kids.\n\nBack of my office. There’s a little framed box of the “contract” between Chris Taylor and I on Demigod. It’s on a napkin.\n\nUpstairs Lab-1 with Agile wall (Scrum wall). So empty.\n\nKristy’s workstation isn’t empty at least!\n\nCleanest this area has been in years. The IT area.\n\nPlay-testing lab.\n\nDerek Paxton, upstairs in Lab-1’s Senior Designer office.\n\nThe kids of the QA area. Today, just making sure everyone else is able to work from home.\n\nObligatory picture of gender neutral bathroom. We have gender-specific bathrooms on every floor but we also installed this along with an area for employees who have just had children to take care of things (and we did this back in 2005).\n\nThe general goal is to create an environment that is welcoming and comfortable. We have extremely low turn-over and I think a big part of that is our company environment.\n\nAnd with that, back to work!"
