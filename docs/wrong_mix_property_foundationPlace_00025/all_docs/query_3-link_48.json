I have since moved away, but still come back to Livonia for my dental cleanings and any dental work that needs to be done. Great staff, get you in when you have an emergency situation, and very friendly group.\n\nI recently had to have a tooth extracted and a partial built. I cannot praise the staff at Great Lakes Family Dental in Livonia enough. From the hygienist to the dentist and his team, I was made to feel comfortable and at ease with all the steps in the treatment plan process. Thank you also goes to the front staff and the dental office manager. I have already sent my wife and will definitely recommend your group to all my friends for a dentist near Livonia. Thank you again!\n\nI had my first experience at Great Lakes Family Dental recently and it was the best dental experience I have ever had. The staff was courteous, personable and prompt. All dental services were performed efficiently and I am looking forward to my next visit with this group. I definitely would recommend this dentist in Livonia to others.\n\nThe entire dental office staff here was unbelievably kind and compassionate. I was facing severe anxiety over dental treatment and everyone there made me feel so comfortable. My hygienist went above and beyond to calm my fears and get me through the visit as easily as possible without ever once making me feel silly or embarrassed for being so anxious. Easily the best experience at a dentist I have ever had."
