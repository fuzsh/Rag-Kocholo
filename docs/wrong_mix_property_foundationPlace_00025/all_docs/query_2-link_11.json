        "text": "The first major PC publication review of The Political Machine has come out - Computer Gaming World's 4.5 star review and an editor's choice award.\n\nWe are very excited and pleased about this. As you can imagine, trying to create a political strategy game that has the right balance of realism and fun and put it together into a $20 package that has very high production values still was really a challenge. But one that we enjoyed immensely and hope you have been enjoying as well.\n\nMake sure you check out this month's Computer Gaming World as it also has a head to head match up between well known industry reviewers Tom Chick and Bruce Geryk. It was a close game between the two and we won't say who won here."
