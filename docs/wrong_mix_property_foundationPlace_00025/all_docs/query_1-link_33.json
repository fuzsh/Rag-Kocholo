        "text": "Quoting PhoenixRising1,\n\nQuoting KataStrofY,\n\nNo, start calling them \"Start11 Season Pass 2024\"\n\nWhy is more development on the start line bad?\n\nI mean, Start 8 and start 10 hardly changed at all. Why are you against more development at a small cost?\n\nWell typical human behavior is \"I want it all for free forever\". For the most part we have to overcome that and as such many people can accept a small cost etc... However that being said some folks still feel like they should never have to pay any more.\n\nMy confusion is how many people complain when the only \"real\" issue (if you can even call it that) is the naming convention. Folks didn't really complain going from Start8 to Start10 despite the differences being much less. In the case of Start11 the only name change you get is a tacked on V2. Some people may see that as an update and not an upgrade. That's the best I can figure.\n\nOne important thing to note is that you're paying for upgraded functionality NOT an upgraded name. Focus more on what the SW does and not what its called and you will do ok.\n\nQuoting JosephBlake2,\n\nSo as a paying customer who PAID FOR Start11 \"version one\", I don't get access to \"version two\"?\n\nNever buying anything you people make again. Especially not when there are FREE options that do exactly what Start11 does.\n\nAnd don't go quoting EULAs to me. This is bull$hit, plain and simple.\n\nI mean, the writing's on the wall right there where it says Stardock doesn't offer support on its own products... sending people to the forums instead.\n\nNo Version two is an upgrade not an update yes you do have to pay for upgrades. Most companies follow similar paradigms.\n\nAs for the \"free\" options I haven't seen a single one that has any of the features Start11 has. I am aware some have other features Start11 does not but the list of options for Start11 is massive many of which are exclusive. Also note that most of those other titles make use of the old Windows 10 taskbar which MSFT themselves has stated will be removed (I think it already has in the canary builds) and def will NOT exist in Windows 12. Which will make all those titles useless. Free or not.\n\nThe forums IS tech support. Not only can you get help near instantaneously from hundreds of users, The entire staff of Stardock monitors, and responds to posts quite frequently. You can post a question and get a response often within an hour from the guy writing the code. I mean what more do you want? Ever try getting support from MSFT? Never mind the fact that you have to pay for it (depending) but you're lucky if you get some lowly tech who can kind of barely speak english.\n\nStardock also has a support ticket system if you would prefer using that instead. You do have options.\n\nQuoting Jafo,\n\nAs many have said people are simply getting upset about a naming system. You can blame Microsoft for being one name level behind if you must\n\nTo be fair, I don't particularly like the name either. It may be a small detail in an otherwise great product, but the name does feel off putting.\n\nA better name as an example would be something like Start 11 Pro. Why? Because the connotation feels more connected to the original start 11 then the name version 2 does. Using the name version 2 puts a little more emphasis that version 1 may be old and outdated. The word Pro on the other hand put more emphasis on two working products and one being more premium.\n\nI do like start 11 v2 very much. But hopefully there is a better name in the future.\n\ni think going with start11.1 and start11.2 or something might be a better idea. right now its kinda against the cognitive recognition going start11 v2 as a \"paid for upgrade\". it really felt like a slap to the face and a money grab (even tho its cheap, still just a sour taste about it)\n\nmy biggest gripe was when re installing start11 i downloaded it and installed it and when entering my licence it said \"not valid\" (nothing like this is a v1 licence you need to upgrade to a v2). the \"upgrade\" button is so insignificant and feels like upgrade from start8 or some such. i actually only found out about v2 when coming to the forums to sort out my \"licence not valid\" issue.\n\na banner on the page saying \"we have launched v2!!! take note that it needs a new lic\" would of gone a long way to keep this thread to maybe 3 pages instead of 6\n\nnothing here says \"hey you got v1 you need to pay to get v2\". sure the icon changed\n\nbut still feels like we're re-paying for the same software. (start11 feels like adobe photoshop 2022, updates to make that version better are included, but if you want 2023 then pay for it) isnt the 11 already a \"version\"? i think this is why \"we\" are unhappy about it.\n\n--\n\nive paid and am happy with the software.. just still yikes\n\n(i also know start11 works for both win10 and win11 so meh.. the 11 is really just the \"name\" i suppose)\n\nQuoting awstam,\n\ni think going with start11.1 and start11.2 or something might be a better idea. right now its kinda against the cognitive recognition going start11 v2 as a \"paid for upgrade\". it really felt like a slap to the face and a money grab (even tho its cheap, still just a sour taste about it)\n\nmy biggest gripe was when re installing start11 i downloaded it and installed it and when entering my licence it said \"not valid\" (nothing like this is a v1 licence you need to upgrade to a v2). the \"upgrade\" button is so insignificant and feels like upgrade from start8 or some such. i actually only found out about v2 when coming to the forums to sort out my \"licence not valid\" issue.\n\na banner on the page saying \"we have launched v2!!! take note that it needs a new lic\" would of gone a long way to keep this thread to maybe 3 pages instead of 6\n\nnothing here says \"hey you got v1 you need to pay to get v2\". sure the icon changed\n\nbut still feels like we're re-paying for the same software.

It really began with Start8 and as new Windows versions came out the name was changed to match. Personally I would have preferred something like \"Start\" and then tack on to a version. Something like Version 1.0 2.0 etc...\n\nWith that said I do disagree to some extent. Most folks can understand (as I'm sure you do as well) that it's the functionality you pay for. In short what defines a \"New version\"? The name? The version #? Many developers (me included) usually follow a major.minor.build paradigm. Leaving aside build for the moment major releases are typically considered a new product. Windows 10 to Windows 11 would be a major release (Leaving the naming aside as well). Minor releases are typically things such as hotfixes, bugfix patches etc... (Think patch Tuesday). There was once a time where the same scheme Stardock uses was used by most companies. That is, minor releases are free but major releases are \"Upgrades\". While not free most of the time upgrades were heavily discounted for loyal current customers.\n\nIt's essentially a way for the company to say \"We know its not free but we have done a ton of work and added a lot but are still willing to make it easier to buy in\". It's probably the most \"fair\" method. Devs make money for their work (and I can assure you a lot of work goes into start11) while not breaking the bank for loyal customers. I would understand if it was every few weeks you had to buy a new version or if the release really didn't have much added but neither of those are the case here.\n\nWhen looking at the changelog it becomes very clear that V2 is the largest upgrade, with not only fixes to additional functionality but all new functionality as well, than all other prior versions.\n\nAll that said I do understand the confusion and frustration with naming but I think now the ship has sailed on that. I could be wrong and Stardock could rename it but then they would have to rebuild at least a small portion of brand recognition. We would likely see more confusion with \"What's this new XYZ app?\" \"Do I Need Start11 first?\" \"Does it replace Start11?\" etc...\n\nim also a dev hehe.\n\nhttps://www.stardock.com/products/start8/\n\nhttps://www.stardock.com/products/start10/\n\nhttps://www.stardock.com/products/start11/\n\nthey started on a \"windows version = startx version\" but now without any communication changed that. i think thats what gets to me the most. so when win12 comes out and they \"fix\" 1 or 2 things they gonna launch start12 then right? as was pointed out the start11v1 to start11v2 was a bigger changelog than start8 to start11 even.\n\nwith win12 will it be start12 or start11v3 then?\n\ni dont agree with \"fixes\" being a cause for the upgrade.\n\nand everyone that goes on about \"its only 6 bucks\" or whatever.. you do realise its more than just the money right? as far as i can remember.. there also wasnt a \"discount\" for v1 clients. it was simply a discount for when v2 launched.

You may be correct about the pricing I wouldn't know since I got V2 for free (well not technically but sort of). I didn't see the products page at all. Just saw the Thread on the boards and downloaded it.\n\nCertainly it isn't always about the money. The only thing I would argue is that V2 was a significant amount of work and the devs should get paid for it. The amount or timing itself would be a separate argument (I'm sure many would make).\n\nAs for Start12 we don't really know. One thing we do know is that Windows 12 will include the \"new\" taskbar that Windows 11 has (and likely gut the old Windows 10 taskbar). So its very likely that Start11 would work for Windows 12 OOB. It may be that Start12 is just a rebrand of Start11 possibly free. It could also be like V2 was and have a significant amount of new functionality to go along with a new name and cost an upgrade fee. We can't really know as of yet."
