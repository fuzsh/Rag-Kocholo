Responding to valuable player feedback, the update introduces a major UI overhaul. The new main screen UI and Fleet Manager make fleet management more intuitive, enhancing the overall user experience and strategic decision-making.\n\nCustom Civilizations in Multiplayer. The update introduces the ability to use custom civilizations in multiplayer modes, adding a new layer of strategy and personalization to online gameplay.\n\nNew Weapon and Defense Components. Ship designers can look forward to an array of new weapon and defense components, allowing for more intricate and interesting ship designs.\n\nLore-Rich Technology Descriptions. Long descriptions for technologies now provide players with the lore behind each advancement, enriching the game's narrative depth.\n\nNew Planet Biomes. Players can now encounter dozens of new biomes across different planet classes, making worlds feel more unique and interesting.\n\nUpdated Graphics Engine. The update features an updated graphics engine with a new light source system, offering a substantial visual upgrade over previous editions.\n\nImproved Localization. Localization improvements, especially for Chinese, Russian, German, and French players, ensuring players from around the world can play the version in their native language.\n\nv2.1 Genesis Update:\n\nMany of the updates in v2.1 have been inspired by their invaluable suggestions across forums, Discord, Reddit, and more,” said Wardell.\n\nSteam Workshop integration for Steam users\n\nA new Mod Manager for easier mod navigation\n\nAn improved tutorial for newcomers\n\n22 minutes of additional music to enrich gameplay\n\nEnhanced military starbase zone enforcement\n\nExpanded support for various non-English languages\n\nA variety of new events, AI improvements, and much more\n\nStardock’s award-winning turn-based strategy game series gets its biggest release ever\n\nStardock announced the release of Galactic Civilizations IV: Supernova Edition (Supernova) today. Stardock is celebrating its 30-year anniversary this month with the sequel to the game that started the company back in 1993.\n\n“This is, by far, the biggest game release we’ve ever done,” said Brad Wardell, founder and CEO of Stardock who returned to design Galactic Civilizations IV: Supernova after handing the reigns to others for Galactic Civilizations III and Galactic Civilizations IV: base game. “We’ve been so fortunate to be able work with our fans to create something that we think strategy game players are going to really appreciate. You can really tell the love and care that we’ve put into this release.”\n\nThe game takes place shortly after humanity has discovered faster-than-light travel. Earth has united and the stars await. The player takes on the role of a civilization's leader (Earth or one of the many alien civilizations) to expand their species into the universe and contend with competing civilizations who are doing the same.\n\nSupernova introduces many firsts for PC gaming including AlienGPT, a generative AI technology trained on Stardock’s own art portfolio that allows players to describe their own custom civilization, and generates not just what the civilization looks like, but its background, lore, galactic events and interactions with other civilizations.\n\nOther new features include Terror Stars, a new end game technology that causes enemy stars to go Supernova, a new mission system, an interactive tutorial, new victory paths, a new core neutral AI opponent system, a host of new alien civilizations with their own tech trees to play as or against, an artifact Vault and hundreds of other additions and enhancements.\n\n“Having done a lot of games in early access over the years, we’ve never had a game receive the kind of positive, enthusiastic response this has,” said Wardell. “With the community, we’ve taken a top to bottom look at how strategy games in 2023 should play and made dramatic improvements as a result. In the past couple of years, the ability to collaborate online has really changed, which has fundamentally altered the way we make games, and the end results are clearly on display in Supernova.”\n\nStardock has also enhanced the modding and multiplayer functionality in Supernova. Cooperative multiplayer has been added and a new integrated modding system lets players upload their own factions, starship designs and more.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1357210/Galactic_Civilizations_IV/\n\nThe latest entry in our award-winning space turn-based strategy game, Galactic Civilizations IV: Supernova Edition, will launch on October 19, 2023\n\nThe release will coincide with Stardock’s 30-year anniversary.\n\nBeginning shortly after humanity has discovered faster-than-light travel, Galactic Civilizations puts the player in the role of leader of a united world looking to expand their civilization into the galaxy. As leader, you must decide what technologies your scientists focus on, what policies your government enacts and what your foreign policy with alien species will be.\n\n“Supernova is, by far, the biggest expansion Stardock has ever made,” said Brad Wardell, founder of Stardock who returned to the design chair for Supernova. “It doesn’t just add a lot of new content but transforms the gameplay in ways not seen in a 4X game before.”\n\nAmongst the new innovations in Supernova is AlienGPT, a technology that allows players to describe their own custom civilization and then uses generative AI to create it. Other new features include the Civilization Vault, Cultural Progression, a story-driven campaign, several new canon alien civilizations, a new starship designer, a new battle system and much more.\n\nAdd to Wishlist:\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1357210/Galactic_Civilizations_IV_Supernova\n\nScreenshots:\n\nAs many of you know, the GalCiv III Elite Founders had the ability to name their own star in game.
