This issue occurs when you set the user locale to a location that does not use comma signs (,) to separate the lists. For example, Germany uses semicolons (;) to separate the lists. When you set Germany as the location, data validation lists that contain commas are all broken.\n\n- Fixes an issue in which an .xlsx file created in Microsoft Office 2013 that contains an App bound to a table is corrupted on save. Additionally, it addresses the issue in which all Agave formulas in the workbook sheet are removed from the file.\n\nOutlook 2010 SP2:\n\n- Fixes the issue regarding the message size of certain long email messages. Additionally, it fixes an issue that occurs when you perform a spell check before you send an email message.\n\nPowerPoint 2010 SP2:\n\n- Improves the quality of videos in a presentation after the videos are optimized or compressed by PowerPoint.\n\n- Fixes issues that occur when you co-author a presentation with other users at the same time.\n\n- Fixes an issue in which Mozilla FireFox crashes when you try to view a presentation in PowerPoint Web App on a Mac computer that has Microsoft Silverlight 3 or Silverlight 4 installed.\n\nWord 2010 SP2:\n\n- Fixes issues regarding bookmarks, fields, track changes, templates, tables, object wrapping, autocorrect options, and email addresses. Additionally, it fixes general reliability issues that occur when you post a blog entry on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 and Microsoft Office 365 blogs.\n\n- Issues that are fixed by this service pack:\n\nAccess:\n\n- If Windows Regional Settings are set to \"Romanian (Romania)\", exporting with formatting from Access to Excel Workbook (*.xlsx) may result in an error when the file is opened in Excel.\n\n- In certain cases, the subform footer control in Access does not stay anchored to bottom of a subform.\n\n- When importing Excel data into Acess which is formatted using rounding, certain numbers may be rounded to too few significant digits.\n\n- If you create an Access query that uses a blank name for a query parameter, Access may crash when running the query.\n\n- Choosing a one-to-many or a many-to one-relationship in the Access Relationship dialog does not always dismiss the dialog and create the approriate link.\n\n- If you filter a column after already having applied a filter on a multi-valued column in a SharePoint list datasheet view, inaccurate results may be returned.\n\n- After you compact and repair a database in Access, adding a new row to a table may throw this error: \"The changes you requested to the table were not successful because they would create duplicate values in the index, primary key, or relationship. Change the data in the field or fields that contain duplicate data, remove the index, or redefine the index to permit duplicate entries and try again.\"\n\n- After you compact and repair a database in Access, the value of a calculated field that is calculating the length of a memo field may return the wrong data.\n\n- Acess may crash if you create a new MFC project with ODBC database support and choose an Excel file source.\n\n- After you compact and repair a database in Access, you may find that data in memo columns is lost for tables that do not have a primary key.\n\n- When viewing a list datasheet view of a document library in SharePoint, you may be unable to edit properties for checked out files. The list datasheet may report that the columns/rows are read-only.\n\n- When viewed in a browser, Access Services 2010 reports show \"#Error\" for all expressions.\n\n- On Windows 7 with optional tablet PC components installed or on Windows 8, Access may crash when you open a form with a listbox and run code to change that listbox.\n\n- When opening an Access MDB file on 64-bit Windows 8 and entering the user security wizard, clicking Finish on the dialog crashes Access and sets the file's security in a state that doesn't allow you to open it again.\n\nExcel:\n\n- When user opens a corrupt Excel document. Excel does not always initially detect the corruption. At some point working with this document, Excel crashes.\n\n- The bug is: when a workbook uses \"1904 date system\" mode, calculations with dates in pivot tables (but not in regular recalc) ignore the 1904 setting and are wrong.\n\n- A chart with a manual-sized plot area which is not visible on load is never made visible before running a macro setting the chart's series formula, the chart may be resized to be zero width and height.\n\n- Cell formatting applied to PivotTables in areas not associated with any field could cause the file to be detected as corrupt.\n\n- Enabling Smooth line on a scatter chart sometimes can cause the chart series to disappear.\n\n- When using dynamic range when the linked source file is closed, chart becomes blank.\n\n- When user locale is set to a language with a non-comma list separator (such as a semi-colon in German), data validation lists will be broken if a comma appears in the list when the file is saved to XLSX or XLSB.\n\n- When using VBA statement Workbook.Open with password to open a metro workbook encrypted with default password, workbook fails to open.\n\n- Pie charts with relocated labels and deleted backing data will crash on save to xls format.\n\n- When copying data between different Excel.exe processes, extra builtin styles may be copied, which will result in a larger file.\n\n- When users open workbooks with Excel embedded as an icon and double-click the embedded workbook, when the file is saved, the Excel icon may be replaced with a blank document icon.\n\n- On a series of a charts with data labels showing, users can't set the text of the data label for the first category by using object model property datalabel.characters.text.\n\n- After customizing the min and max settings for an date axis, the Error bars at the boundaries can be drawn outside the plot area.\n\n- When manually opening a file checked out from a Sharepoint server drafts folder that has a relative external link to something else on that same server, when the file is later checked in, the file will now have a local link to the user's draft folder instead of the relative link.\n\n- OpenType fonts may be displayed in Excel 2013 as TrueType fonts in the Ribbon Font drop-down list.\n\n- For a chart with many data points on one series, the hitTest result is not always correct.\n\n- When opening a file with a model pivot table created in Excel 2013, invokeing the Context menu for the pivot table and moving the mouse over the menu items may start an infinite loop of error messages.\n\n- Print title columns are clipped starting from page 2 when all the following conditions are met:_x000D_\n\n- 1.

Verify that the file has not been corrupted and that the file extension matches the format of the file.\"\n\n- When loading a file with DRM readonly rights which includes a Pivot Chart, you may see multiple identical alerts before you can see the chart.\n\n- A file containing a PowerPivot Pivot table, which was originally created using Excel 2013 and saved as an .xlsx file, and then later opened using Excel 2010, saved as an .xls file and then reopened, does not open in protected mode as expected.\n\n- When an Excel file is open via DDE from SkyDrive or SharePoint 2013, the Unicode characters in its path and name are encoded with %XX UTF-8 encoding. When the same file is opened directly from Excel, the Unicode characters in the file path and name are not encoded. When the user creates external links alternating between two methods of opening files, two sets of links are created - those with encoded Unicode charaters and with regular Unicode characters. If such an external workbook becomes resident, only one set of links is going to be updated, thus possibly leading to unexpected calculation results.\n\n- Updated EXPRSVR.dll and VBAJET32.dll to take advantage of dynamic basing security features of latest Windows OSes.\n\n- PivotTables with large data sets containing errors could sometimes be sorted incorrectly.\n\n- After saving a workbook containing a chart from Excel option dialog, if then change to use some custom decimal/thousand separators and close Excel, when reloading the file, the number formats on chart will be incorrect.\n\n- Editing a cell by typing in characters in a very long existing string can cause extremely slow response.\n\n- When opening an .xlsx file created in Excel 2013 which contains a table Agave binding, saving the file in Office 2010 and then re-opening it either Office 2010 or Office 2013 will generate a file-corruption message and all Agave formulas in the sheet will be discarded.\n\n- Depending on screen resolution, Text in E1O text boxes may be shifted down, causing the last line to be truncated.\n\n- When opening an Excel file containing an image or object in the range of merged cells in mobile EWA, the mobile EWA will try to add the image when Viewer loading the Excel file, resulting in the following error message: \"MewaGridView.InsertImage: target cellElement is null. Unable to insert image.\" _x000D_\n\n- Excel Workspace files were previously not captured in the file block settings. Excel 4 Workspace files have been added to the file block list under \"Excel 4 Workbooks\" and are now blocked by default. Excel 97-2003 Workspace files were added to the \"Excel 97-2003 Workbooks and Templates\" which still allows them to be opened unless those types of files have been added to the block list.\n\n- When creating text links in Excel the cell formatting doesn't display correctly.
