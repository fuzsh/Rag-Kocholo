        "text": "… back in August! I forgot all about it. Not many websites out there can lay claim to being online for 20 years, but this site can.\n\nNo one really comes here anymore, since I don’t post (and there are no players). This site is barely getting 30-50 visitors a day. I expect over the next few years, people will notice The Stardock has had an anniversary.\n\nI found the original 10 year anniversary post. I took the time to update the links in it so they work! Unfortunately, I haven’t posted much in the decade since. I closed my TWGS three years before the 10 year anniversary, and shortly after it I updated the website to what you see today. I’ve been wanting to update the look of it for about five years, but I can never find a theme I like. A lot of themes today require thumbnails and most of this site’s news has no thumbnails. They simply won’t work.\n\nLooking around the forums I found out the TWGS software is nearing death. It requires some special maneuvering to work in Windows 10, TWGS and TWX Proxy both rely on a version of Delphi that doesn’t exist anymore, and every server I visited was mostly empty. That’s OK, I’ll keep the site around for nostalgia. There is a lot of good stuff deep in this site. Good times.\n\nEleq\n\nA new article from PC Magazine states:\n\n“TradeWars 2002 is a space trading game based on a classic gaming formula: buy low and sell high. Mix in ship to ship combat and a horde of Star Trek references, and you have yourself a potently addictive strategy game.\n\nTW2002 originated as a BBS door game designed to run on dial-up Bulletin Board Systems. It has since escaped its BBS shackles and made its way onto the Internet at large thanks to the TradeWars Game Server.\n\nYou can play TW2002 on dozens of free servers today. The author recommends the ICE9 server for starters, which can be reached via telnet at ice9-tw.com port 2002.“\n\nRead more at PC Magazine\n\nGreetings and Salutations To Traders and Evil’doers everywhere.
