Georgetown is the capital of Guyana, as well as the largest city and the country’s urban, cultural, commercial, and administrative heart.

Georgetown is famed for its unique British colonial architectural style, with its iconic wooden stave churches as testaments to this heritage. The city’s botanical gardens are renowned, adding to its charm. Further, the lively markets of Georgetown, abundant with local produce, handcrafted items, and diverse food options, offer a rich, sensory experience.

Where is Georgetown?

Georgetown is located on the northeast coast of South America, facing the Atlantic Ocean, near the mouth of the Demerara River. Specifically, it is situated in the Demerara-Mahaica region, one of Guyana‘s ten regions. Despite its coastal location, Georgetown is slightly below sea level, necessitating a system of sea walls to prevent flooding.

History of Georgetown

Georgetown, originally called Stabroek, was founded by the Dutch in 1782. It began as a small settlement, and over time, it became the capital of the Dutch colony of Demerara. The Dutch laid out the street grid that still characterizes much of the city and built several key buildings and fortifications.

In 1812, the British took over the Dutch colonies of Essequibo, Demerara, and Berbice and renamed Stabroek to Georgetown after King George III. Georgetown then became the capital of the new colony, British Guiana. The British expanded the city and created much of the colonial architecture that gives Georgetown its unique character today.

One of the most significant events in Georgetown’s history was the great fire of 1945, which destroyed much of the city. However, the city was rebuilt, with many damaged wooden colonial buildings replaced with more modern and fire-resistant structures.

Georgetown remained the capital when British Guiana gained independence in 1966 and became the cooperative Republic of Guyana. Despite numerous political and economic challenges since independence, Georgetown has continued growing and is the country’s largest urban area and cultural, administrative, and financial center.

The historical periods that have shaped Georgetown, and indeed Guyana, include:

The periods of Dutch and British colonial rule

The struggle for independence

The post-independence era

Each period has left its mark on the city, influencing its architecture, culture, and role in the country.
