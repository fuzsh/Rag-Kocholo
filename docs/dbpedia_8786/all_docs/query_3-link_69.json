        "text": "The Georgetown Steam Plant is a National Historic Landmark â€” a reminder of the era of electrification when industry was first attracted to Seattle by its inexpensive hydroelectric power and electric trolley car system. It is also a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark, a Seattle Landmark, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nOnce at the center of the rapidly growing Georgetown neighborhood, the Georgetown Steam Plant was built by the Seattle Electric Company in 1906-1907 on 18 acres of land along the Duwamish River. The plant's two vertical Curtis Turbines helped establish the steam turbine as capable of producing large amounts of power more cheaply and efficiently than other generators at the time.\n\nToday, tours and open houses are available at no charge for anyone wanting to learn more about Seattle's energy history. You can also take a 360-degree virtual tour of the Georgetown Steam Plant by clicking the button below. This virtual tour is presented by Seattle City Light in partnership with the Georgetown Steam Plant Community Development Authority.\n\nGeorgetown Steam Plant Video Series\n\nCan't visit the Georgetown Steam Plant in person? Do you have lingering questions or want to explore at your own pace? Welcome to a series of videos made to serve as a virtual tour of this iconic National Historic Landmark in Seattle's Georgetown neighborhood. Nothing can replace experiencing the steam plant in person, but we hope you enjoy the information presented and make plans to visit soon.\n\nSeattle City Light thanks filmmakers Angela Bernardoni and Derek Johnson for their special dedication to this project and also to the wonderful volunteer docents for generously sharing their knowledge and time.\n\nThis video series is made possible through donations given by visitors of the Georgetown Steam Plant.\n\nHistory Highlights\n\nJoin regular tour guide and City Light Sr. Resource Planner Mike Aronowitz for an interesting overview usually provided at the beginning of every tour, including history of a fast-growing Seattle in the early 20th century, the innovative architecture and construction of the building, and the role its builder and designer played as a pioneer of time and motion studies in America.\n\nThe Boiler Room\n\nNormally the last stop of our in-person tours, this video puts you in the heart of the action, the Boiler Room, located upstairs and across a cat walk inside the steam plant. Volunteer docent Mike F. explains the many interacting components and the fuel systems that fired the plant to create energy.\n\nThe Engine Room\n\nSet against a bank of west facing windows, two monuments to innovation loom large; these are two of the only Curtis Vertical Steam Turbines left in place in the world. Join electrical engineer and volunteer docent Kelsey W. to learn more about the context in which they were created, how they work, and other special features of the engine room.\n\nUnit #3, Horizontal Turbine\n\nLearn how technological innovation weaves and advances throughout the steam plant and over the years with this informative presentation by volunteer docent Greg A., who shares his passion for the engineering involved via the final turbine installed in the plant in 1917.\n\nA Brief History of Electricity\n\nElectrical engineer and volunteer docent Kelsey W. illuminates the history of how electricity spread across the nation in the 1800s, the people leading the innovations making it possible, and the emergence of hydropower.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nEven though the Georgetown Steam Plant hasn't produced electricity in more than 70 years, there's still a buzz about this place. Its biggest fan is Sam Farrazaino, President of the nonprofit Georgetown Steam Plant Community Development Authority, which signed a long-term lease to manage programming and operations of the plant. Already, the steam plant has hosted dance, theater, music, even ghost hunting events! Thank you to Seattle Channel for creating this video."
