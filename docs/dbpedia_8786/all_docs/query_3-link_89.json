Approximately 3.5 miles of the trail are in Montgomery County.\n\nThe trail, one of 500 rail-to-trail projects in the nation, traverses’ neighborhoods and parkland and includes stretches along the Potomac River. The trail is the most popular trail in Montgomery County.\n\nUnless noted otherwise on the map, trails marked “Natural Surface” and “Hard Surface” are “Shared by All” trails which include hikers, bikers, and equestrians.\n\nThe Coalition for the Capital Crescent Trail, a private, non-profit group, maintains a website about the trail with detailed maps.\n\nOn April 9, 2021, Montgomery Parks and the Parks Foundation unveiled a public-facing Eco-Totem to display the numbers of pedestrians and bicyclists using the Capital Crescent Trail each day and each year.\n\nProjects\n\nRecently completed projects along the Capital Crescent Trail include the Capital Crescent Trail Crossing at Little Falls Parkway, the Neal Potter Plaza, and the Ourisman Plaza.\n\nSeveral current projects are managed by third-party agencies. Please refer to the links below for more information.\n\nElm Street Park and the Capital Crescent Civic Green will be impacted by third party projects."
