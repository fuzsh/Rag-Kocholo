True, the scent is poor. The mind is not understandable as it does not spoil the appetite of the batter's nose stock of everything that rolls on the beach. But do not seem to bother. Where we try to quickly run past some carrion thrown on shore, residents calmly and with an appetite for the whole family partake in Fig.\n\nHowever, to eat their rice from boksikov Guyanese are everywhere. Do it with pleasure, and every free weekend minutu.V all sivoll filled by people who came here to \"promenade\" to cultural and Sunday evening.\n\nThe main attraction of Georgetown - the wooden Church of St. Dzhordzha.On is the tallest wooden church in the world (the height of the bell tower about 40m).\n\nThe most beautiful building of 18-19 cc. located on Main Street. They are built mostly of wood and are renowned for the famous local shutters, the so-called \"Demerara-shatters.\" These shutters have a special period, which was placed before the ice, and passing through the ice cooled the air space.\n\nParliament building is constructed, as they say, at the very place where freed slaves bought their first land.\n\nNot far from the complex is the Victoria Law Courts, before which stands a statue of Queen Victoria.\n\nNear it is a beautiful Gothic city hall.\n\nThe most enormous building in Georgetown is almost entirely built of cast iron.\n\nThis building is the largest and most famous market in the country - Stabrok, built in 1792. His main decoration - the clock tower, similar to the Tower of London Tower of London.\n\nIndians AIM-AIM built in Georgetown, unusual building conical shape that resembles an Indian hut.
