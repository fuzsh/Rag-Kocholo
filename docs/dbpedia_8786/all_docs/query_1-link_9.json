        "text": "Georgetown, Guyana's capital, lies at the mouth of the Demerara River on the Atlantic.\n\nThe sea here does not have much to recommend it, with mud flats along much of the shore.\n\nMany of Georgetown's buildings are wooden, with bags of character in a shambolic sort of way. The cathedral, built in 1842, is the largest wooden structure in the world and well worth stopping to see.\n\nA handful of lodges on or around the Demerara are within reach of Georgetown, including the venerable Shanklands, a reminder of former glories.\n\nOtherwise there is not much to do except head into the interior."
