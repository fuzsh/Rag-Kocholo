        "text": "Overview\n\nGuyana’s capital, Georgetown, has enough history, intrigue and indeed nature, to easily keep you entertained for a few days.\n\nThe population of 240,000 is made up of a melting pot of people that have given the city a completely contrasting look and feel to any other capital on the continent. Unlike its mainly Latino neighbours, Georgetown is distinctly Caribbean in vibe, with its strong British colonial heritage also clearly showcased in much of the now crumbling architecture. Influences from elsewhere are also prominent, with both mosques and Hindu temples hinting at the heavy influx from Asia, with the grid patterned, canal lined streets providing clues to the past presence of the Dutch.\n\nThe offshore oil developments that have recently thrust Guyana into the limelight as the world’s fastest growing economy are already having a positive impact on its bustling capital. Foreign investment has seen a rapid improvement in its infrastructure and a co-ordinated clean up and modernisation program is making inroads into the long journey to return the city to its former majesty.\n\nDespite being located almost 150 miles away, Kaieteur Falls make for a wonderful day trip from Georgetown, flying south in the morning and returning later the same day. A lack of accommodation means that overnighting in the region is not recommended, but, as Guyana’s most iconic attraction, it remains a must for any first-time visitor. Situated within Guyana’s only national park, Kaieteur cascades 226 metres in a single drop and is the largest such waterfall in the world (by volume). As well as being endlessly photogenic, the falls also help sustain a unique and biodiverse ecosystem, so visitors hiking one of the many trails can hope to spot a variety of creatures, including frogs, butterflies, ocelots, howler monkeys, giant river otters and hundreds of species of birds."
