        "text": "On this page you can find incidence and mortality rates for all cancers.\n\nInitially we include non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) — to give a clear picture of total cancers globally — then further tables with NMSC excluded.\n\nA total of 19,976,499 cases of cancer were diagnosed in 2022. The age-standardised rate for all cancers for men and women combined was 196.9 per 100,000 in 2022. The rate was higher for men (212.6 per 100,000) than women (186.3 per 100,000).\n\nWhen non-melanoma skin cancer was excluded the number of cancers globally dropped to 18,741,066 with a rate of 186.5 per 100,000. For men the figure was 9,566,825 with a rate of 198.6 and for women, 9,175,141 with a rate of 178.9.\n\nWith the burden growing in almost every country, preventing cancer is a significant public health challenge. Around 40% of cancer cases could be prevented by tackling risk factors relating to diet, nutrition and physical activity — for more information see our Cancer Prevention Recommendations.\n\nReducing the cancer burden requires concerted and integrated action across society, including civil society, private sector, and health and other professions. Browse our policy section to see how we’re working with others to help make this happen.\n\nASR = age-standardised rates. These are a summary measure of the rate of disease that a population would have if it had a standard age structure. Standardisation is necessary when comparing populations that differ with respect to age because age has a powerful influence on the risk of dying from cancer.\n\nGlobal cancer incidence: both sexes\n\nThe highest cancer rate for men and women combined was in Australia at 462.5 people per 100,000 when all cancers were included.\n\nThis changed to Denmark when NMSC was excluded (349.8 per 100,000). A further table below includes global cancer incidence excluding NMSC.\n\nThere were several countries for which the age-standardised rate was at least 300 per 100,000 when NMSC was excluded including:\n\nUnited States of America\n\nFrance\n\nIreland\n\nCancer incidence in men\n\nThe highest cancer rate among men was found in Australia at 514.3 per 100,000. This changed to Lithuania when NMSC was excluded (386.4 per 100,000). Several countries had age-standardised rate of at least 300 per 100,000, including:\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe Netherland\n\nSpain\n\nUnited States of America\n\nCancer incidence in women\n\nThe highest cancer rate in women was in Australia at 415.2 per 100,000. This changed to Denmark when NMSC was excluded (340.8 per 100,000). Several countries had age-standardised rate of at least 300 per 100,000, including:\n\nNorway\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nAustralia\n\nGlobal cancer mortality: both sexes\n\nThe highest rate of cancer deaths for men and women combined was in Mongolia at 181.5 people per 100,000. When NMSC was excluded, Mongolia still had the highest rate at 181.3. The age-standardised rate was at least 130 per 100,000 in four countries:\n\nZimbabwe\n\nHungary\n\nPoland\n\nRomania\n\nCancer mortality in men\n\nThe highest rate of death from cancer in men was in Mongolia at 227.5 per 100,000. When NMSC was excluded, Mongolia still had the highest rate at 227.3. The age-standardised rate was at least 180 per 100,000 in three countries:\n\nBelarus\n\nHungary\n\nLithuania\n\nCancer mortality in women\n\nThe highest rate of death from cancer in women was in Zimbabwe at 150.9 per 100,000. When NMSC was excluded, Zimbabwe still had the highest rate at 149. The age-standardised rate was at least 120 per 100,000 in three countries:"
