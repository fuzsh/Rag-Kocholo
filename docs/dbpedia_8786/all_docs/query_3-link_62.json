In addition, MedStar Georgetown was the first hospital in Washington, D.C., to receive Magnet® recognition for demonstrating excellence in nursing care. Since then, we have been re-designated four times given our outstanding commitment and dedication to our patients from our world-class nursing staff.\n\nAs we continue caring for people and advancing health, we remain on the forefront of healthcare delivery with the opening of our new Verstandig Pavilion. Nearly 477,000 square feet, the Pavilion houses 31 state-of-the-art operating rooms, 32 private rooms in a modern and expanded Emergency department, 3 levels of underground parking, and 156 private patient rooms designed to support patients and their loved ones. When time is of the essence, a helipad atop the Pavilion enables direct and immediate access to the appropriate point of care.\n\nFounded in the Jesuit principle of cura personalis, caring for the whole person, MedStar Georgetown is dedicated to focusing on the full needs of our patients and their families that go beyond their immediate healthcare needs and providing the comfort they need to help them heal. This philosophy empowers our associates to work together to provide holistic care, as well as a trusting and compassionate environment."
