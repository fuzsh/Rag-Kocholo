Focused on oil and gas, it explores the three circuits of capital, emphasising the severe impacts of the booming oil and gas industry on marine environments and coastal communities. Through interviews, research, and consultation with diverse experts, the publication aims to inform and empower local communities and beyond, fostering strategies for environmental, social, and economic justice.",

        "text": "This issue brief aims to critically analyse different forms of the ocean economy in Guyana, including its socioeconomic and ecological impacts, and how different groups are affected by its expansion. It is written, in particular, to inform fishing, coastal, and local communities in Guyana and the Caribbean about the developments in ocean sectors with the hope it will contribute to strengthening networks and alliances pursuing environmental, social and economic justice. The methodological approach coupled with the focus on oil companies also makes the publi- cation relevant for people and organisations beyond the Caribbean. It is the result of a collaboration between the Transnational Institute (TNI), the Caribbean Network of Fisherfolk Organisations (CNFO) and the Guyana National Fisherfolk Organization (GNFO).\n\nIn Guyanese waters, three economic sectors stand above the rest: shipping, fishing, and oil and gas. While this publication explores all three sectors, more attention is dedicated to the oil and gas industry because of its massive growth over recent years coupled with the severe impacts on the marine environment, the climate, and the livelihoods of coastal and fishing communities. The analysis explores what Marxist scholars describe as the ‘three circuits of capital’,1 namely the extractive or productive circuit; the commodity exchange or value chain circuit; and the financial or money circuit. Analyses of extractive industries often revolve around the first (production) circuit, as they focus on on-site strategies and impacts of extracting raw materials. Extending the analysis to the second (exchange) and third (monetary or financial) circuits allows us to build a holistic picture of the strategies, operations and interconnections between extractive companies.\n\nWe hope that this analysis, together with the exploration of the impacts of the three sectors on the Guyanese population and environment, will help movements, alliances and networks to develop or refine their strategies.\n\nThis publication begins by introducing the Guyanese fish- ing sector. The oil and gas industry is then explored from its production, exchange and financial perspectives (the three circuits). Against this background, the brief explores how oil and gas extraction and industrial fishing aggravate the harsh socioeconomic conditions in coastal and fishers communities and negatively impact the Guyanese marine environments. Moreover, the effects and contradictions of relying on an alarmingly polluting industry such as oil and gas to develop Guyana are also explored. Finally, this brief explores how local actors are resisting the expansion of the ocean economy in the country, along with some ideas for future action.\n\nThe publication is based on research conducted through- out 2022 and 2023, which included interviews with Guyanese fishers and academics. More concretely, primary research engaged with one representative and two workers in the fisheries sector; one environmental consultant and one expert on nature conservation from Guyana; and two experts in marine spatial use and planning in the Caribbean. It also includes the analysis of several relevant governmental, scholarly, corporate and policy documents, including national and regional governmental plans, reports and scholarly publications on the ocean economy, the fisheries sector or climate change. Core findings were consulted with the co-publishing organisations."
