        "text": "Archivist Kathy Hertel-Baker shares the following information on Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.:\n\nGeorgetown University opened in 1789, the first Catholic and first Jesuit institution of higher learning in the new nation. Georgetown University was founded by John Carroll, Bishop of Baltimore and first Bishop in the United States. The new University was located in what is now Washington, DC. Georgetown University expanded and in 1893 a thirty-three bed hospital staffed by Sisters of St. Francis was a component of its School of Medicine. A nurses’ training facility, also staffed by the Sisters of St. Francis, was opened in 1903. The hospital and nursing school flourished and benefited from its location in the nation’s capital. In 1946, the Franciscan Sisters withdrew from their ministry at Georgetown. Reverend Paul McNally, S.J., Director of the Hospital, and Dean of the Medical School, asked the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth to come take over operation of the hospital.\n\nMother Ann Sebastian’s circular letter of December 7, 1946 described the new venture for SCNs in health care:\n\nThe Jesuits at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C expect to open a new 400-bed hospital adjoining Georgetown University School of Medicine sometime in early summer. These two buildings will be the first two units in a great Catholic Medical Center, and we have been asked to operate the hospital. As Georgetown University School of Medicine offers unusual advantages for our sisters in every department of the nursing field, such an opening would be a fine thing for the Community. Despite our present anxiety in trying to fill current needs, we have determined to practice Mother Catherine’s reliance on Divine Providence in opening new missions with only a handful of sisters, and we have written the Jesuits that we would accept Georgetown Hospital.\n\nMother Ann Sebastian assigned sisters to staff the new hospital and appointed Sister Mary Antonella Staubach as administrator. In her letter of acceptance to Mother and the Council, Sister wrote:\n\nSo Georgetown is my India! [The new SCN foreign mission] When I read your beautiful letter, Mother, there was nothing left to do but to bow my head in humble submission to the Will of God …. There are two factors that serve to make this cross lighter, the first is that it is the Will of God, and the second that you have provided such wonderful sisters to serve with me.\n\nIn addition to the administrator, nineteen sisters were assigned to the staff of Georgetown Hospital and its School of Nursing. The Sisters’ early days at the hospital were filled with practical matters such as interviews with prospective employees, purchase of hospital equipment, and selection of furniture. The elevator and tile-floor workers spent long hours completing their jobs as the hospital could not be opened until essential areas of construction had been completed.\n\nOn June 18, 1947 the SCNs moved into the seventh floor, designated as the convent for the new hospital. Furnishing the convent took many weeks. A month after the sisters occupied the seventh floor, Sister Mary Antonella wrote to Mother Ann Sebastian: “The seventh floor is far from settled and looks as though the Sisters have just moved into their home.”\n\nOn July 31, 1947 at the 7:30 a.m. Mass, the newly-constructed Georgetown University Hospital was blessed by Most Rev. John M. McNamara, Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Washington. In his homily he defined the purpose of the hospital:\n\nThis Mass has been offered for a particular purpose and to emphasize that Jesus Christ Our Lord is to be a permanent guest in this hospital ­ maybe I should put it – be a permanent patient in this hospital. Since it is our obligation, and the obligation of those who have the destiny of this hospital in their hands, to see Jesus Christ Our Lord in every patient who comes here for treatment.\n\nDignitaries arrived almost daily to tour the new hospital, causing Sister Mary Antonella to write Mother Ann Sebastian:\n\nWe have entertained and entertained until I feel as though I have met everybody in Washington. Today, Father Paul McNally, S.J., gave me a list of distinguished guests for next week including Harry S. Truman, President of the United States.\n\nAmong other distinguished guests were personnel from the U.S. Army and Navy including Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy. International guests included seven Chinese generals, who were also doctors. The 1948 annual report included the following statistics for Georgetown University Hospital: Total Patients 9,632; Daily Census 222; Days of Average Stay 8.4. Such numbers confirmed the obvious need for the hospital and its acceptance by the people of Washington D.C. Georgetown University Hospital was known for excellence in healthcare and the new facility was welcomed as an indispensable part of the Georgetown University Medical Center complex.\n\nIn November 1960, Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of then President-elect John F. Kennedy, went into labor with and was rushed to Georgetown University Hospital. After a difficult birth, both mother and child rested comfortably under the skilled care of SCN nurses. Mrs. Kennedy was so pleased with her treatment by the Sisters that she sent them a personal thank you note and a monetary gift to show her gratitude. The Sisters used the gift to purchase a set of dishes for the Georgetown convent.\n\nMother Lucille Russell and her Council withdrew the SCNs from Georgetown University Hospital in 1963 due to a shortage of nurses and other medical personnel in SCN hospitals. At the expiration of their contract in 1963, after sixteen years of dedicated professional leadership, the Sisters left Georgetown Hospital.\n\n(Featured image at the top of the story shows the Georgetown University Hospital Staff with the Medical Center Director.)"
