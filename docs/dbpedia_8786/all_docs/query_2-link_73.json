The international diversity is the number one reason attending this school is the best choice for a global career.\n\nCharlene from Washington, DC\n\nGreat location in D.C. The prep is real, and turned me off initially, but it's all about who you surround yourself with. I find that people have a hard time relaxing.\n\nHarry from Peoria, IL\n\nSimilar Colleges\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nProvidence, RI\n\nStanford, CA\n\nNew Haven, CT\n\nWashington, DC\n\nBaltimore, MD\n\nCambridge, MA\n\nPrinceton, NJ\n\nNew York, NY\n\nIthaca, NY\n\nNew York, NY\n\nDurham, NC\n\nSee All"
