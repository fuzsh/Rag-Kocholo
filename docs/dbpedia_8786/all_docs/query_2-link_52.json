        "text": "Every now and then I write about a destination in slight disbelief. Disbelief that I went there and explored these incredible destinations.\n\nGuyana is one of those. I recently spent the best part of 2 weeks exploring Guyana. Starting and finishing in Georgetown, with a pretty hefty chunk of the trip in the Rupununi Savannah. Make sure you check out that article.\n\nFor now let’s start with a brief intro to Guyana as a country, before I move on the all the fun things to do and places to see in Georgetown, Guyana.\n\nWhat is Guyana known for?\n\nPerched on the northern part of South America bordering Brazil, Venezuela, and Suriname, Guyana is one of the most offbeat destinations in South America. It’s a great place to visit especially if you have an adventurous soul.\n\nBesides being famed as the only English-speaking country on the continent, Guyana is also home to a some incredible and unique ecosystems and terrains – from highlands covered in pristine rainforests, to coastal plains and unique savannah, it’s a destination that has it all.\n\nSurprisingly, Guyana is still one of the least visited countries in South America, which means the country is a rare gem in a world that’s struggling with over-tourism.\n\nHowever, over the past decade, the country is slowly but surely gaining the attention it deserves, so if you enjoy visiting untapped destinations, it’s time to pack your bags and get to Guyana before its unspoiled reality changes.\n\nHow to get to Guyana?\n\nThe country is served by Cheddi Jagan International Airport (GEO) but there are no direct flights from London.\n\nYou can use the London Gatwick route which usually has a stopover in Trinidad and Tobago (at Port of Spain Airport) via the Caribbean Airlines.\n\nHowever, the easiest and the most popular way to get to Guyana from the UK is flying to the US.\n\nFrom London Heathrow to New York, JFK Airport, (or Miami), and then take a connecting flight to Georgetown.\n\nOnce you get to Georgetown, I recommend booking a transfer from the airport to your hotel, which is by far the best way to start your trip.\n\nBest Tours in Georgetown Guyana\n\nThings to do in Georgetown, Guyana\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of Guyana, let’s dive into the main topic, the things to do in Georgetown Guyana!\n\nWhile most visitors mostly come to discover the countryside, there are great places to visit in Georgetown Guyana that you don’t want to miss.\n\nExplore the Markets\n\nFirst things first, when coming to Georgetown Guyana, you’ll want to visit the markets. On this trip, we visited 2 different ones, Bourda and Stabroek, and I’ll tell you everything about each here below.\n\nBourda Market\n\nBordered by Regent Street on the south and Robb street on the North is the Bourda Market – the most popular and one of the busiest vending spots in Georgetown.\n\nHere you’ll discover some of the freshest and most exotic fruits as well as vegetables and it gives you a wholesome local shopping experience.\n\nNot only will you enjoy shopping for local produce but you also get a chance to mingle and interact with the locals.\n\nPlus, the vendors are super friendly and kind – it’s not alien for the sellers to offer samples as you shop. And please make sure you see Buddy for a fresh coconut (pictured!).\n\nStabroek Market\n\nVisiting this market is one of the best things to do in Guyana. Stabroek is another bustling local marketplace in the central area of Georgetown.\n\nDating back to the 17th century, this market is considered the largest in the country.\n\nAside from having a variety of fresh produce, the square is surrounded by some unique buildings imitating the Tudor architectural style that you can stand and marvel at.\n\nIt’s also the starting point for the Demerara River cruise, a bit further down this list.\n\nAlso, it’s worth noting that the 2 markets are included in the Guyana’s City Center Tour, which I highly recommend checking out while coming to Georgetown.\n\nThe Singing Chef & the 7 Curries Tour\n\nDining in the secret garden in the company of the Singing Chef Eon John and his wife Jessica, is probably one of the most authentic experiences you can have in Guyana.\n\nEon from Singing Chef Adventures is a multi-talented chef that has also had a marvellous career in the mainstream music industry.\n\nIn addition to sharing his love for music and food by preparing amazing Guyanese meals in their secret garden, you also get to explore some lesser-known parts of Guyana with this amazing couple.\n\nYou can chose just to eat in the garden, or do the full 7 curries tour (as we did). The tour starts with sourcing local ingredients from the Bourda Market. A great chance to connect with locals and see their way of life.\n\nThis was followed by a visit to Tony’s Puri Shop where we would watch a demonstration of how the dhal puris are made. It was cooked right in front of us and we even had the chance to get involved.\n\nAfter we picked our own waterlily leaf to eat from (be careful not to fall in the swamp as I did!), we headed to the secret garden for a masterclass in cooking and singing. Eon and Jessica are fantastic hosts, talking us through the entire process in their beautiful secret garden.\n\nThe 7 curries are a much loved traditional dish in Guyana, they are all vegetarian and I can hand on heart say they are some of the most flavoursome mouth-watering curries I’ve ever eaten! This is a must do for Georgetown.\n\nVisit the St. George’s Cathedral\n\nSoaring to a height of 143 feet, St. George’s Cathedral is one of the tallest wooden structures in the world.\n\nBut that’s not the only thing that makes it intriguing – built in the 18th century, some hundred and something years ago, this white-coloured building has withstood the test of time and you can still explore, admire the architecture or even worship in the building!\n\nThe secret to the building’s longevity is arguably the type of timber that was used in the construction of the cathedral, the Greenheart is a tree that’s endemic to Guyana and the neighbouring Suriname.\n\nThe Greenheart, also known as Bebeeru, is a timber tree that’s remarkably stiff, durable, and resistant to termites.\n\nSt. George’s Cathedral is also included in the Guyana’s City Center Tour that I shared below, and this is only another great reason to check it out!\n\nVisit the Endangered Manatees\n\nThere are a couple of places to visit the endangered West Indian Manatees in Georgetown, either the Botanical Gardens or the National Park.\n\nWe visited the National Park, which is a lovely green space full of people exercising. The looped track is popular with runners, and we saw school children practising for a relay race.\n\nBut the main reason we went was to see the Manatees. There are couple of schemes in place to rescue manatees in Georgetown, and there are around 15 Manatees here.\n\nYou can just about see them shuffling around, but if you swish some grass around the top of the water, they usually come over. They are completely harmless and incredibly gentle, amazing creatures to see close up.\n\nJoin the Famous 5-Island and Town Hopping Tour\n\nHit the ground running with the 5-Island and Town Hopping Tour in Georgetown! This tour packs a punch with an itinerary that will take you to some of the most picturesque and historically significant islands and towns along the Essequibo and Mazaruni Rivers.\n\nStart the tour heading over to Bartica, where rich history meets modern convenience, with a stop at Fort Island for an immersive learning experience.\n\nNext, indulge in some of the most delicious lunch options imaginable with a choice between the lush and verdant Nature Resort at Sloth Island or the Modern Resort at Aruwai Resort.\n\nBut the adventure doesn’t stop there! After lunch, you’ll visit the Kykoveral Island, known for its colonial-era architecture and views of the Mazaruni River. Finally, end your exciting island hopping tour with a relaxing visit to Wel te Vreeden town, where you can shop for unique trinkets and souvenirs to forever remember your visit.\n\nDoesn’t it sound like the perfect plan for a day out in Georgetown Guyana?! That’s right, this is a 12-hour tour, and definitely a great way to start (or end) your Guyana trip.\n\nTake a Demerara River Cruise\n\nCruising along the Demerara River is a must-do while in Guyana! And for sunset? Even better.\n\nThere are some amazing bird-watching opportunities here, you can regularly see Snail Kites, Herons and three kinds of Egrets. But the showstopper was the Scarlet Ibis, watching them as they fly across the sky and settle into the mangroves for the evening. Stunning.\n\nYou can also enjoy panoramic views of the Demerara Harbour Bridge, which has an intriguing history. It used to be the largest floating bridge in the world (total length 1851m).\n\nThe Harbour Bridge was commissioned in 1978 to link the west and east banks of the river and make transportation between the two areas easier and quicker.\n\nAlthough this bridge was designed to serve these purposes for only a decade, it has withstood the test of time and it’s still in use today, almost half a century later.\n\nMake a point to hop on a cruise in late afternoons or early evening, after a long day of exploring to relax as you watch the world go by, and see the magical sunset over the fast-flowing waters of the Demerara River.\n\nExplore the History of the City\n\nIt would be a pity to visit Guyana and not peruse the history of Georgetown! Like most things in Guyana, I recommend doing this on a tour.\n\nOur trip and itinerary was planned by Wilderness Explorers, who are experts in Guyana and South America. Our guide Salvador was fantastic.\n\nGeorgetown was dubbed as the Garden City of the Caribbean thanks to its natural beauty and serene surroundings, it rose from a sleepy village in the 18th century when it became the capital of the colony of Demerara-Essequibo.\n\nIt was selected by Lieutenant-Colonel Kingston to be established as a town due to its strategic location, at the mouth of the Demerara River.\n\nToday, you can still see the traces of the colonial ruling in the country imprinted especially on Dutch and English architecture.\n\nGeorgetown is Guyana’s capital as well as the chief port with so much display of culture and history.\n\nWalk the Promenade along Georgetown’s Main Street\n\nOn a sunny afternoon, nothing beats a stroll along the streets of Georgetown. Be sure to take a leisurely walk along Main Street and Regent Street.\n\nThese streets are lined with charming colonial structures including some of the most significant buildings in the country such as the Public Library (formerly Carnegie Free Library) where you’ll find loads of antiquarian books.\n\nAlong these streets, you’ll also find the City Hall, a stunning piece of gothic-style architecture, the State House, which is the official residence of the president, and the Victoria Law Courts.\n\nFly to the Kaieteur Falls\n\nTechnically the only thing on this list not in Georgetown. I couldn’t not include it. You absolutely cannot come to Guyana without taking a trip to the Kaieteur Falls.\n\nThe Kaieteur Falls is the trademark of Guyana, and for good reason; it’s the largest single-drop waterfall in the world at 224 metres (741 feet). It’s an absolutely breath-taking sight to see and feel the force of this waterfall.\n\nThis unique micro-climate is also home to golden frog, Kaieteur Swifts, Makonaima Birds or the beautifully orange ‘Cock-of-the-rock’.\n\nYou can take flights from Georgetown, which typically stop for 3 hours so you can explore the falls. Or you can charter your own plane if there’s enough of you. Nothing can quite prepare you for the first view of the waterfall from your tiny plane. Check out the video below.\n\nEnjoy the Nightlife in Georgetown Guyana\n\nAs is often the case, we didn’t have loads of time to explore the nightlife in Georgetown, but from what I did see it looked like it had a real Caribbean vibe to it.\n\nRum-tasting\n\nOkay for a start this is not strictly a night time activity, but it is something you’ll become accustomed to in Guyana, they love their rum!\n\nYou’ll see El Dorado rum everywhere, it’s world famous and they are extremely proud of it here. It’s (apparently won the best rum in the world award numerous times). You can go tasting at the distillery itself, where they have been producing since the 17th century. They also have an impressive sustainability pledge.\n\nAlternatively the Cara Lodge Hotel offers rum tasting and a rum infused dinner menu! That was brilliant. You can taste the rum aged 12, 15 and 21 years sampling the differences. These are their sipping rums, drank more like a whisky. And they were delicious, I bought a selection from duty free to bring home.\n\nPalm Court, Georgetown\n\nPalm Court is one of the oldest and among the best upscale bar & restaurants where you can visit to enjoy the nightlife in Guyana.\n\nIt’s located right at the heart of the city and its exterior is adorned by lots of palm trees that make the ambiance very cosy, especially at night.\n\nThey offer amazing food, drinks are reasonably priced and they always have a DJ that gives off relaxed vibes.\n\nIgnite Bar & Grill / Poolside dining\n\nThis is another awesome place to visit for an evening out. It’s part of Pegasus Hotel so it’s great if you’re looking for a fine dining experience and a great selection of drinks.\n\nIgnite Bar & Grill is also a great place to enjoy music as you vibe to a combination of Indian, reggae, and Soca tunes.\n\nBest Tours in Guyana\n\nWhen in Guyana, you want to make the most of your time, and for that to happen, I recommend joining a tour with an experienced guide. Here are the 3 best tours in Guyana you should consider:\n\n8-Day Trip Around Guyana From Georgetown\n\nIf there’s one way to visit Guyana, it must definitely be this one. You’ll start the 8-day trip from Georgetown and make your way to Kaieteur Falls, easily some of the best spots in the country.\n\nApart from natural wonders, you’ll go deep into the heart of Guyana’s lush rainforest, where you’ll catch glimpses of rare endemic species such as the jaguars, giant anteaters, and capybaras.\n\nYou’ll also visit the Rupununi savanna, where you can observe the enchanting beauty of the Caroni and Essequibo rivers.\n\nBut it’s not all about nature – we’ll take you to the charming urban hub of Georgetown, where you’ll soak up the local culture and indulge in delicious cuisine.\n\nThe tour includes 6 breakfasts and lunches, as well as 3 dinners and transportation around Guyana, so you won’t have to worry about a thing!\n\n5-Island and Town Hopping Tour\n\nWhen staying in Georgetown, you can enjoy several tours, but one not to miss is the 5-Island and Town Hopping Tour, which will show you the best of Guyana’s natural and historical beauty.\n\nFirst up, you’ll visit the charming streets of Lamaha and Waterloo, where you can soak up the local culture and history. Next, you’ll venture to Fort Island, where you’ll stand in awe of the old fort and learn about its history as a Dutch colony.\n\nAfter that, it’s time to hit the river and explore the lively town of Bartica, before we head to Sloth Island for lunch at Nature Resort. You’ll have the chance to fuel up and relax in the lush tropical surroundings.\n\nNo Guyana adventure is complete without a visit to the historic Kykoveral Island. You’ll explore the ancient ruins of this once-great city, and learn about its fascinating past.\n\nLast but not least, we’ll wrap up our tour in Wel te Vreeden, where you can take in the serene riverside views and bask in the peaceful countryside.\n\nAfter visiting Guyana, I can confidently say that this is a tour that you don’t want to miss when coming.\n\nGeorgetown 7 Curry Tour\n\nLast but not least on this section is the Georgetown 7 curry tour, a popular day trip that I personally loved.\n\nThis immersive culinary experience will take you on a journey to discover the secrets of one of the most beloved Guyanese dishes, 7 Curry.\n\nJoin a singing chef, Eon John, as he teaches you how to prepare seven different curries using the freshest ingredients from the local market. Immerse yourself in the vibrant surroundings of Bourda market as you handpick vegetables like eggplants, edoe, and catahar.\n\nAs you cook and eat, Eon will serenade you with enchanting Guyanese folk songs. And don’t worry, you’ll get a chance to try a few of your own as well!\n\nI included this tour in the things to do in Georgetown Guyana above, and I highly recommend it again here.\n\nWhere to Stay in Georgetown\n\nHere’s a list of great places to stay in Georgetown Guyana:\n\nLuxury: Guyana Marriott Hotel\n\nThe Guyana Marriott Hotel Georgetown stands as a beacon of luxury in the heart of the city, offering a unique blend of modern sophistication and historical charm. Overlooking the picturesque Demerara River, this hotel is just a stone’s throw from Georgetown’s vibrant central district.\n\nThe rooms provide breathtaking views of either the ocean or the city’s twinkling lights, equipped with amenities like flat-screen cable TVs, minibars, high-speed WiFi, and comfortable work desks.\n\nFor relaxation and entertainment, the hotel boasts an outdoor pool with a pool bar and grill, perfect for enjoying the sunset.\n\nMid-Range: Cara Lodge Hotel\n\nOne of the oldest and grandest buildings in Georgetown, Cara Lodge Hotel is a heritage house and has that boutique hotel feel to it. It was built in the 1840s, and has had a fair few dignitaries visit in its time including HRH Prince Charles and Mick Jagger.\n\nThe rooms are modern and spacious, with really comfortable beds! The onsite restaurant is also really good, and this is where we had the rum-tasting and rum menu.\n\nBudget: PG Quality Inn\n\nPG Quality Inn in Georgetown provides a cozy and convenient stay, and offers a peaceful retreat without straying too far from the city’s attractions.\n\nYou’ll get air-conditioned rooms that come equipped with free Wi-Fi and cable TV, with some of them boasting charming city views.\n\nWith free private parking, PG Quality Inn combines comfort, convenience, and a touch of local charm, making it a great choice for those visiting Georgetown.\n\nConclusion – Places to See in Georgetown Guyana\n\nSo that rounds off my experience and things to do in Georgetown. What would you add to the list? Have you been yet? Please let me know in the comments below.\n\nThis article was supported by the Guyana Tourism Authority, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.
