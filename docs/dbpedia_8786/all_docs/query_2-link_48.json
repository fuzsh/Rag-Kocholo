        "text": "The school wants students who will impact campus and the world for the better, and those who demonstrate leadership ability in their extracurriculars or teacher recommendations are more likely to do so. In the same vein, students who are passionate about theta they are studying are more likely to make an impact in the field. The school wants students to leave a positive impact and the world, and will be drawn to those students who have already shown an ability to do so.\n\nThe school looks for passion and involvement generally in extracurriculars. While it is great if they all fall in line with your intended field of study, it is not required. What is important is that extracurriculars, and the short essay which discusses one of them, describe a student’s passion for what they are doing. A student deeply involved at a high level in a few activities will stand out more to admissions here.\n\nStudents who are descendents of the 292 slaves sold by the university in the 1800s will receive the same boost to admissions as legacy applicants.\n\nThe school is currently actively working to increase the number of low income and first-generation students on its campus, along with increasing recruitment rates for underrepresented student populations.\n\nGeorgetown Strategy\n\nWhile Georgetown does practice holistic admissions, having good academic preparation is still a very important part of an application. While a few low grades or lower than average test scores can be made up for by truly stellar achievements in other areas, it isn’t good to rely on that, especially as the school’s acceptance rate is so low. Having a high GPA, taking rigorous classes, and achieving good test scores will aid your application.\n\nThe school requires all applicants complete an alumni interview, and treats this as a key component of the application. Doing poorly on this will hurt your application, and performing well will aid you. It is a good idea to practice once or twice before attending. Be ready to answer questions about why you like Georgetown specifically, and what field you want to study. Don’t be overly scripted in your response, nor should you only say what you think interviewers want to hear. The interview is a chance for the school to better know you as a person and applicant, and you should take full advantage of that.\n\nYour character will be an important part of your application, and the essays are the best place to show this. While Georgetown does not require students to be Catholic, they do base their values on their Jesuit culture, and look for complementary values in students. While you don’t need to swear undying loyalty to the pope, they are looking for compassion, leadership, and a desire to make the world a better place. Demonstrating these traits in your essays will show the school that you fit in with the culture they are trying to nurture.\n\nFor extracurriculars, what they are looking for specifically will change each year, as they try to ensure a diverse and well-rounded community overall. That said, they will always seek passionate and involved students, who are dedicated to and specialize in one extracurricular activity, and excel in their chosen field.\n\nStudents should consider which of the schools they are best suited for when applying to Georgetown, as admissions decisions are made by school, and changing between them is difficult.\n\nStudents should be aware of the culture at Georgetown, and ok with it before they decide to attend. While students are not required to be Catholic, or indeed show any religious affiliation, the school is still associated with the Catholic faith, and the Jesuits in particular. While this manifests differently from Notre Dame, it does still impact campus culture."
