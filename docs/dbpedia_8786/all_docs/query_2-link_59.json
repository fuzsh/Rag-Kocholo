        "text": "We are Georgetown University’s only Private Equity and Venture Capital Advisory group, connecting students with the world of private investing. We seek to educate students through our comprehensive education program and partner with private equity and venture capital firms to provide them with student-analyst teams to perform due diligence and valuations, as well as serve as pro-bono financial advisors to startups.\n\nComprehensive Education\n\nWe have brought together the experience and intellectual firepower of Georgetown’s professors, students, and partners to develop an education program that will take students from the basics of finance to being able to value private firms like real PE and VC analysts. Knowledge of finance is not required to start. We also test students with a midterm and final before sending them out to work with our partner firms.\n\nReal Work Experience\n\nUpon completing our education program, student analysts join teams and partner with private equity firms, venture capital firms, or startups seeking Seed or Series A funding. They perform various tasks tailored to each client, including due diligence, financial modeling, marketing plan creation, and other ad hoc deliverables. Each project presents different work streams, ensuring continuous skill development. Students make tangible contributions in a complex, technical environment, gaining real-world experience in alternative investments. This program provides firms with trained Georgetown talent to enhance their business.\n\nProfessional Development\n\nAdditionally, we also provide substantial professional development opportunities. We have a Speakers Series where we bring leaders from the private equity, venture capital, and startup space to Georgetown for the benefit of the entire community. We also hold workshops to develop hard technical skills, networking events for firms to meet our talented students, and send updates on internship opportunities and recruiting timelines for PE, VC and investment banking firms."
