        "text": "Location: Georgetown is located on the edge of Texas Hill Country, 26 miles north of Austin, the state capital and home of The University of Texas.\n\nMany Georgetown residents look to Austin for additional access to culture, history and the arts; while significant numbers of the University of Texas faculty make Georgetown their home. The San Gabriel River passes through the city and provides over 30 miles of waterside parks, bike and hiking trails as well as a popular community park.\n\nThe city is served by Interstate 35 and State Highways 29, 195 and 130.\n\nThe eastern part of Williamson County is level black land soil and the western part rolling limestone hills.\n\nThe Hill Country is prized for its cactus, Texas cedar, live oaks, Bluebonnets, and the Red Poppies for which Georgetown is celebrated as The Red Poppy Capital of the Lone Star State.\n\nYou’ll also find celebrated vineyards in the surrounding hills.\n\nGeorgetown Weather\n\nResidents enjoy over 300 days of sunshine annually, while rainfall averages about 35 inches per year. Average daily temperatures:\n\nJanuary 39 to 60° F\n\nApril 55 to 78° F\n\nJuly 72 to 95° F\n\nOctober 56 to 81°F\n\nPopulation: In recent years, Georgetown has experienced rapid growth with the population rising from just over 28,000 in 2000 to over 48,000 in 2011. The city is now ranked 637th largest in the nation.\n\nMuch of this growth has come from retirees and those relocating for the combination of amenities, activities and hospitable climate.\n\nThe area was named #1 Place to Retire in America by Retirement Places in 2007 and in the 10 Gre at Retirement Spots for Golf Nuts by U.S. News & World Reports in 2008.\n\nHistory: Georgetown’s namesake, George Washington Glasscock and Thomas B. Huling, donated the land for the town in 1848 around the same time that Williamson County was formed. Georgetown became its county seat.\n\nThe Chisholm Trail, famed for cattle drives from Texas to Kansas and Missouri, passed through the city of Georgetown.\n\nIn 1873, Southwestern University was founded here, followed almost immediately by the establishment of a rail hub to serve the agricultural-based economy of the time.\n\nGeorgetown grew modestly throughout much of the twentieth century until the sixties, when major expansion in nearby Austin accelerated growth. In the seventies and eighties, major historic renovations transformed the downtown, creating one of the best-preserved collections of Victorian and pre-World War I architecture.\n\nAs a result Georgetown was named the first Great American Main Street city in Texas in 1997. In the County Courthouse Historic District, more than 40 restored structures helped place it in the listings of the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nInvesting in Georgetown Texas Real Estate\n\nDoes Georgetown Texas sound like the kind of place that would complement your needs and interests well?\n\nIf so, then contact me, Virginia Lazenby, your Georgetown Texas real estate expert.\n\nI'll give you an even more detailed idea of what it's like to live in Georgetown Texas as well as answer any questions you might have.\n\nWhile you're at it, feel free to browse some of our Living in Georgetown features, which include:"
