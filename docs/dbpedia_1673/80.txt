LAS VEGAS - The BYU baseball team defeated UNLV, 9-1, in the first-ever Mountain West Conference game played at Earl E. Wilson Stadium on Thursday.

The Cougars (10-10, 1-0 MWC) broke a 1-1 tie in the fourth with five runs off UNLV starter Joe Maruffi, only three of which were earned. Two errors by shortstop Zach Strong proved costly as the Rebels (6-16, 0-1 MWC) would never recover.

BYU designated hitter Aaron Whitley enjoyed a 4-for-5 afternoon at the plate with a double while Matt Carson belted a solo home run in the seventh.

The Rebels were led offensively by Tony DeMarco, who went 3-for-4. Adam Manley drove in the team's only run on a RBI single in the third inning.

Both teams will meet again on Friday and Saturday to complete the three game series, with Friday's matchup scheduled for 3:05 p.m. and Saturday's game set to begin at 1:05 p.m.
