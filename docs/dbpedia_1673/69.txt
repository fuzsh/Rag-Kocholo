Mountain West Conference Tournament Tickets

While it’s one of the newest conferences in college basketball, the Mountain West Conference has quickly gained a good reputation, especially its year-end conference tournament. Since it’s new and doesn’t have the same history as some other conference tournaments, it’s a little easier to find cheap Mountain West Conference Tournament tickets than some of the other leagues. But that just means the value that exists in the Mountain West is among the best in the country every March. In fact, with a bid to the NCAA Tournament on the line and several tournament-worthy teams competing, there always seems to be a demand for last-minute Mountain West Conference Tournament tickets.

The Aztec Invitational?

Throughout the early history of the Mountain West Conference Tournament, the San Diego State Aztecs have been the dominant team in the conference. The Aztecs have won the tournament more than any other team and reached the finals more than half of the time. Especially with teams like Utah, BYU, and TCU leaving the conference, San Diego State has been able to maintain its dominance over the rest of the league. However, Mountain West also has accomplished programs like UNLV and New Mexico, as well as up-and-coming programs like Utah State, Nevada, and Colorado State to challenge the Aztecs and make the Mountain West Conference Tournament one of the most competitive tournaments in college basketball.
