        "text": "Mike Kazlausky enters his 14th year as Air Force baseball head coach in 2024. Kazlausky was named head baseball coach on June 2, 2011. Kazlausky retired from active duty, effective June 1, 2011, and his interim tag was lifted to official head coach status. A former player and Academy graduate, Kazlausky epitomizes what it means to don the Falcon baseball Blue and White.\n\nKazlausky, known as \"Coach Kaz\" is a 1991 Academy graduate and has also logged six years as an assistant coach at the Academy. He is the first Academy graduate to become head baseball coach at Air Force and was the program's first military coach since 1988.\n\nKazlausky retired with the rank of major after 20 years of meritorious service with the U.S. Air Force. As the interim head coach in 2011, Kazlausky led the Falcons to a 19-36 overall record, leading the program to the most wins since 2002. The 19 wins were also the second-most in school history against Division I opponents and the most Division I wins by a first-year head coach at the Academy.\n\nThe Falcons fell one win away from repeating as conference champions in 2023, as Air Force suffered a 12-9 loss in the Mountain West Championship Game. However, the 2023 team helped to illuminate the unique success of the year before. Sam Kulasingam, named the Tony Gwynn Mountain West Player of the Year for the second-consecutive season, became the first player in Falcons history to record at least 100 hits multiple times. Air Force concluded the 2023 season with a 28-31 record, as the Falcons 17 conference wins were second-most in program history. Air Force's five All-Conference selections now stand as a program best.\n\nOn April 29, 2023, a 12-3 win over San Jose State saw Kazlausky pass Joe Robison as the all-time wins leader at Air Force, notching his 283rd win as the Falcons skipper.\n\nThe 2022 season was a cascade of accolades for the Falcons, as Air Force clinched its first Mountain West Championship following three-consecutive wins at the conference tournament in San Diego. The Falcons eventually played in their first NCAA Regional in Austin, Texas, where Air Force reached the Regional Final before falling to host Texas.\n\nThe Falcons concluded the 2022 spring with a 32-29 record, the second-most wins in program history and the most overall victories since joining the Mountain West in 2000. Air Force set a myriad of program-bests in 2022, including the most home runs in a single season (95), as well as the most strikeouts ever by the Falcons pitching staff (455). Sophomore Sam Kulasingam was named the Mountain West Player of the Year, becoming the first Falcon to receive the award. Kulasingamâ€™s 109 hits in 2022 are the most-ever by an Air Force player in a single season. Sophomore Paul Skenes received Mountain West Co-Pitcher of the Year honors. He recorded a 7-1 mark on the mound in conference action with a league-best 2.40 ERA and 56 strikeouts in 10 starts.\n\nAmong the accolades received upon the commencement of the 2022 season, Skenes was named the John Olerud Two-Way Player of the Year, as well as a First Team All-American via such publications as Baseball America, D1Baseball, Collegiate Baseball News, and Perfect Game. Skenes was also honored as a First Team All-American by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association in addition to being named a First Team All-Region selection by the American Baseball Coaches Association. Skenes continued his play into the summer as a member of the USA Baseball Collegiate National Team.\n\nAfter a sterling 2022 season, Kulasingam was also honored by various organizations, having been named a First Team All-Region selection by the ABCA, as well as a Third Team All-American by Collegiate Baseball News. Jay Thomason received First Team All-Mountain West honors while Gabriel Garcia was named Second Team All-Conference. Thomason led the Falcons with 16 home runs, the most by any player in the MW in 2022. Garcia managed a 1.066 OPS in 61 games, clubbing 15 home runs to help collect 161 total bases. Air Force finished 9th in the country in batting average (.312), 4th in doubles (148), 10th in hits (697), and 14th in runs scored (507).\n\nIn the classroom, Air Force produced 13 All-Mountain West Academic Team selections, as well as eight Mountain West Scholar Athletes.\n\nIn the Falcons first full season after the COVID-19 pandemic, Air Force returned to play great baseball, posting a 26-22 overall record, the most wins by Air Force since 1993. The Falcons 18-16 Mountain West record stands as the best conference record in program history. The Falcons knocked off two top-15 teams for the first time since 2010 (#7 LSU & #13 Arizona) while going 10-7 against teams who made the 2021 NCAA Tournament. The Falcons picked up four wins against teams that advanced to Super Regional play (LSU, Arizona, Dallas Baptist). Over the course of the year, Air Force owned winning streaks of six and eight consecutive games over MW opponents, the longest winning streaks over MW opponents in program history. Air Force finished fourth in the MW standings, tied for the highest finish in the MW in program history. Paul Skenes and John Byrnes earned First Team All-Conference honors, with Braydon Altorfer being named Second Team All-Conference.\n\nFreshman dynamo Paul Skenes was named the MW Freshman of the Year, as well as having been named a consensus First Team All-American after being named to three lists (Collegiate Baseball News, Baseball America, NCBWA). Skenes also earned Co-Freshman of the Year honors from CBN, was named the District 8 Player of the Year by the NCBWA, and was one of 25 semifinalists for the Golden Spikes Award. In the MW, Air Force was ranked top-three in eight offensive categories, while also top-three in strikeouts, saves (1st), pick-offs, fielding percentage, and runners caught stealing (1st). Nationally as a team, the Falcons ranked second in doubles/game (2.62), ninth in total doubles (126), 17th in batting average (.302), and 32nd in slugging (.468).\n\nIn an abbreviated 2020 season, which was canceled after 19 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kazlausky still had plenty of highlights. It started with his 200th win as Air Force's head man after a 7-3 win over rival Army West Point, Feb. 29. Kaz became just the second AF baseball coach to reach the 200 win milestone. As a team, Air Force finished the season second in the country in stolen bases, eighth in doubles, ninth in double plays, and 43rd in hits. Three players were named All-MW Conference, including senior Ashton Easley, who went on to be signed by the Miami Marlins organization. Easley is the seventh former Falcon to go on to play professional baseball under Kaz's tutelage.\n\nThe 2019 season saw the Falcons conclude the season with a 26-26 record, as well as a 12-14 record in MW play. It is the third time in the last four seasons Air Force has finished .500 or above, as well as the fourth season in a row with 12 conference wins. Four players were named All-Conference in catcher Rob Dau on the first team, and Nic Ready, Ashton Easley, and Jake Gilbert on the second team.\n\nWith four players honored, it marked the third time in the last four seasons Air Force has had four players earn all-conference accolades, joining the 2016 and 2017 teams. It is also the fourth straight season the Falcons have had at least one player named to the first team, the first time that has happened in program history. Kaz also saw the final chapter of one of his finest recruiting classes at the Academy, as the Class of 2019 finished with 107 wins, making them the winningest senior class in Academy history. In addition, 2019 graduate Nic Ready set new program career-best marks in games played (217), at bats (917), hits (300), home runs (50), RBIs (224), and total bases (544). He also finished second in career doubles (76) and third in career runs scored (190). This parlayed Ready into a 23rd round selection in the 2019 MLB Draft by the Miami Marlins. In addition, Gilbert was also signed as an undrafted free agent by the Cincinnati Reds organization.\n\nIn 2018, Kaz continued the momentum of the Air Force program, posting a 24-30 record to record the fourth 20-win season in a row. It is the first time that has happened at Air Force since recording eight straight from 1988-1995. He surpassed his mentor Paul Manieri for second on the all-time wins list at the Academy, with 171. The Falcon offense remain near the top of the national leaders in most offensive categories, ranking in the top 15 in batting average, doubles, scoring, slugging, and triples. They were also one of the most efficient fielding teams, ranking ninth in double plays and 41st in fielding percentage. He guided Nic Ready to one of the best single offensive seasons in program history, as he was named third team All-American, the 13th in program history and fifth under his leadership. In addition, he had two All-MW Conference honorees in Ready and Rob Dau, who were both also named All-Region.\n\nThe 2017 season had many highlights for Air Force. The Falcons posted a 27-26 season, marking back-to-back seasons over .500 for the first time since 1994-95. Air Force also produced two All-Americans in seniors Adam Groesbeck (3rd team OF) and Bradley Haslam (3rd team 3B), an Academic All-American in senior OF Russell Williams and a MLB Draft Pick in Groesbeck (38th round - Atlanta Braves). Air Force produced four all-conference players, including two first team. The Falcons had a banner year offensively, leading the nation in six offensive categories, including batting average (.344), doubles (153) and slugging (.545).\n\nAir Force put together one of its best teams in program history in 2016. The Falcons posted a 30-27 record and made a deep run through the Mountain West Championship, finishing third. Falcons had the second most wins in a season in program history and for the second-straight season, set a program record for most Div. I game wins. Air Force had four all-Mountain West honorees, including the conference co-pitcher of the year in junior righthander Griffin Jax and the conference co-freshman of the year in 3B/DH Nic Ready. Jax and junior left fielder Tyler Jones earned All-America honors, while Ready earned freshman All-American honors. Air Force had two junior pitchers picked in the MLB draft, as Jax was a third-round selection of the Minnesota Twins and junior LHP Jacob DeVries went in the 38th round to the Cleveland Indians. The Falcons also got it done in the classroom as well, garnering eight MW all-academic honors including junior first baseman Russell Williams, who earned Academic All-America honors.\n\nThe 2015 season showed Air Force's continued upswing as an emerging program. The Falcons went 23-29 for its winningest season since 2002. The 22 wins over Div. I opponents set a new program record. Kazlausky guided the Falcons to its second-ever win over an SEC school with their win over Missouri. Coach Kaz also had his second-ever MLB draft pick, when senior RHP Ben Yokley was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 29th round. In 2015, Kazlausky also became Air Force's winningest coach in the Mountain West era. The 2015 team set 25 school records (individual, team, conference), including best fielding percentage (.966), lowest team ERA in conference play (5.06) and lowest ERA in MW play by a pitcher (Trent Monaghan - 3.65). Kazlausky had three all-conference performers in outfielders Adam Groesbeck, Spencer Draws and pitcher Griffin Jax. In addition, the Falcons excelled in the classroom, with seven MW all-academic selection and an academic all-district honoree in outfielder Russell Williams. The Falcons also sent a player to the prestigious Cape Cod wood bat summer league as pitcher Jacob DeVries played for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox.\n\nIn 2014, Kazlausky guided the Falcons to its best season in over a decade, posting a 20-34 record. The Falcons reached the 20 win mark for the first time since 2002 and its 19 wins over Div. I opponents is tied for the third-most ever in school history. Kazlausky produced his first Freshman All-American in outfielder Tyler Jones, who earned Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American honors. Jones also earned All-Mountain West honors, becoming the first Air Force freshman to earn all-conference honors in 23 years, dating back to 1991. Air Force was 4-2 against ranked teams in 2014, earning its first-ever series sweep of a ranked team, when it swept #20 UNLV in a three-game series.\n\nThe Falcons posted a 15-39 record in 2013. The Falcons had their winningest conference season since 2002. Kazlausky had his first player drafted in senior catcher Garrett Custons, who was a 10th round draft pick of the Toronto Blue Jays. Custons was also one of 15 semifinalists for the Johnny Bench Award. Falcon baseball also continued to excel in the classroom, producing a school-record eight Academic All-Conference players.\n\nIn 2012, Air Force went 14-39 with a young team that often times started as many as five freshmen in the field. The Falcons posted a 6.10 team ERA that was the second-lowest in the past 30 years. The Falcons featured two All-Mountain West selections in junior catcher Garrett Custons and sophomore designated hitter Seth Kline. The Falcons also posted their first winning season at home since 2002 and defeated a Big 12 school (Kansas) for the first time since 2001. In addition, Air Force set a school record with 46 sacrifice bunts.\n\nIn his first year, Kazlausky led Air Force to its first win over a Pac 10 school in 21 years and its first four-game sweep since 2003. The team fielded .960 to set a new school record. Sophomore Garrett Custons earned First-Team All-Mountain West honors by ranking in the conference top 10 in 11 categories. Sophomore right-hander Sean Carley posted one of the best seasons ever by a Falcon pitcher, earning second-team All-MW honors, the first Falcon pitcher to earn all-conference honors since 2002. Carley posted a 3.94 earned run average, the lowest at the Academy in 28 years. His 4.10 ERA in conference games set a school record in the Mountain West era. Air Force lowered its team ERA by over five runs a game from the 2010 season (11.31 to 6.09). The 6.09 team ERA was the lowest at Air Force in 29 years, dating back to 1982.\n\n\"This is my school and no one is more proud than I to have gone through the Academy and to have served for 20 years in the Air Force,\" Kazlausky said. \"I look forward to having the opportunity to continue to represent our United States Air Force Academy! It is a tremendous honor and a privilege to be associated with the Academy and the Air Force as the Head Baseball Coach. I have a great understanding of all the pillars at the Academy, and I truly understand the mission of the Academy and the Air Force. Our job, as a staff, is to ensure success not only on the baseball field but in all facets of the Academy and that each young man is ready to lead our great country upon graduation!\"\n\nAs one of the most inspirational and emotional players to ever wear the Air Force baseball uniform, Kazlausky came to USAFA baseball as a walk-on and started all four years. At the time of his graduation, he held eight career records and still ranks among the top 10 in seven all-time offensive categories. A two-time all-Western Athletic Conference (WAC) selection, Kazlausky led the Falcons in batting in 1989 and 1991.\n\nAfter a standout baseball career with the Falcons, \"Kaz\" spent three seasons from 1993 to 1995 as an assistant coach to former Falcon head coach Paul Mainieri, the now-retired Hall-of-Fame. During this time, the Falcons posted three consecutive winning seasons. The 1994 team led the nation in batting average, slugging percentage and triples. The 1995 team won 29 games, the second most in school history. After leaving the Academy in the summer of 1995, Kaz spent four years at Charleston Air Force Base, S.C., as a pilot in the C-17 aircraft.\n\nHe later returned to the Academy in the fall of 2000 as a TG4 and T-41/C-150 evaluator pilot in the 94th Flying Training Squadron. In addition to his flight duties, he also served as the volunteer baseball coach for the Falcons as well as the Preparatory School head baseball coach. During his tenure, the 2002 Falcon team set the school record for most Div. I victories and two Falcon players were drafted into the minor leagues. Kazlausky then returned back to Charleston Air Force Base in 2004. He spent the next two and a half years as a C-17 pilot actively serving in the War on Terror, before returning to the Academy from 2006-2008 for this third tour as an assistant baseball coach. Kazlausky spent 2010 as an Air Officer Commanding (AOC) for cadet squadron 12 at the Academy.\n\nIn 2007, Kazlausky was inducted to the Lake County Hall of Fame in Lake County, Ill., for outstanding achievement. In 2008, he was inducted into the 14th Airlift Squadron Hall of Fame in Charleston, S.C..\n\nCoach Kaz and his wife, Kris, live in Monument, CO. Kaz's daughter Sam graduated from USAFA in 2022, while their son Mick begins his sophomore year as a Falcon in 2023."
