        "text": "For the first time in the Neal Brown era, the 2023 West Virginia Mountaineers finished the season in the Top 25. They snuck in after a Duke’s Mayo Bowl win over North Carolina, reaching the 25th spot. For a team that returns so many starters and so much production across the board, that invites a conclusion. The Mountaineers should start the following season in the Top 25, right? So far, very few predict the Mountaineers to make such an appearance when the first AP rankings are released later this month. Perhaps one reason for the exclusion lies with the offensive line. Stalwart Zach Frazier entered the NFL draft, and savvy veteran Doug Nester exhausted his eligibility. Losing three of five starters on a top-tier offensive line may explain it. Don’t tell that to the 2024 iteration of the Mountaineers, however, as we see the WVU offensive line maintaining the standard set during the 2023 season.\n\nWVU Offensive Line Maintaining the Standard\n\nDespite the losses of Frazier and Nester, West Virginia enters 2024 with a veteran unit in the trenches. Indeed, four of the five presumptive starters enter 2024 as seniors. The fifth, Tomas Rimac, is now a junior. All five have started multiple games in multiple seasons. Only one enters the season with fewer than 1,000 snaps of experience. Two enter the season with over 2,000 snaps and over 30 starts under their belts. Collectively, the unit enters the season with over 110 starts and over 7,500 snaps. The experience checks out. What about size? The unit averages six feet five inches and 313 pounds. The size checks out and compares favorably. What gives, then? Well, Frazier is a loss. He anchored the line as its leader in the center position for the last three years.\n\nBrown made players available to the media in an open session late last week at training camp.\n\nIn-state star Wyatt Milum hears plenty about the losses of Frazier and Nester. He admits the room is weird without them. Asked whether he expects a fall off in production, though, Milum reacts, “Nothing’s going to change from last year.” He says that the team set the standard for play in 2023, and the veterans expect to maintain that standard this season. Milum and Ja’Quay Hubbard represent the vocal leaders on the unit. We have talked about the luxuries Coach Brown has in our quarterback and running back previews. We continue that theme here. The Mountaineers have a luxury this season that they can spread out the leadership with such an experienced room.\n\nGoals for the Unit\n\nAs far as goals, Milum offers a surprise area of improvement. Individually and as a unit, Milum says the linemen are focused on building consistency in pass protection. Considering the offensive line finished in the top three in the nation in terms of sacks surrendered, it seems they have that down. Milum did not give up a sack the entire season. Perhaps that speaks to leadership: perfection by one measure is not good enough. Milum wants to improve. He pushes his teammates to improve. Why? According to Milum, who has received plenty of pre-season hype and accolades, ignores that noise. Instead, he’s “just focused on winning a Big 12 championship right now.” To get there, his veteran leaders are “just trying to make this team better.” They do not plan to falter; instead, the offensive line “plans on being great.”\n\nThe goals are lofty. Between Milum, Hubbard, Rimac, Brandon Yates, and Nick Malone, however, there is plenty of experience in this unit. Each offers a steady presence. That matters a lot. It enables the unit to focus better in the film room and understand the opposing unit’s tendencies. Given the new teams in the Big 12–of which WVU only plays one–understanding the ways an opposing lineman or edge rusher attacks the line will be critical to whether the offensive line is indeed great or just very good.\n\nBehind the Line: The Second Unit"
