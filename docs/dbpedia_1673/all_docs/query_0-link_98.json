        "text": "Seek Ye First\n\nThis week I took a break from listening to news and talk shows and turned my radio to a Christian program that includes in its mix old time hymns, gospel songs, and now classic praise music – you know, songs from 50 years ago that were popular back when I was becoming an adult!\n\nI was enjoying many of the songs, when one particular tune came up that made me smile. It came out in 1971, before Karen and I were married, but was still going strong several years later in worship services and on my cassette tape player! The song was titled, “Seek Ye First.” The first verse was written by Karen Lafferty and published by Maranatha Music. Then, other anonymous writers added the other verses to it, which made the song more complete. I enjoyed the tune, but also the simple declaration of three teachings of our Lord, Jesus Christ. Very simple, very direct, (no bridges), and no endless repetitions – just the first verse repeated once as the final verse.\n\nToday I’d like to share the song with you (the lyrics, that is, I won’t try to actually sing it) and talk about the importance of what Jesus said.\n\n1. Verse One: Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you, Hallelu, Hallelujah. (Matthew 6:31-33)\n\nThe setting: Jesus spoke these words during the Sermon on the Mount. First he told the people not to worry about about their physical needs, such as food and drink and clothing. Using examples of birds, which are fed by God even though they do not sow crops, and lilies which are beautifully “clothed” by our heavenly Father though they do not toil nor spin. Because we are more valuable to God than many birds or lilies, how much more will he provide for us in our need? Jesus then concludes with the command to seek first God and his kingdom, and all these needs will be added to us.\n\nWhy I like what Jesus said: Jesus promised that our heavenly Father knows our needs, and is ready to provide all we need, if we but look to him and seek him. The rest of the world chases after pleasure and material wants and needs, but God wants us to trust in him and seek his righteousness, which is not found in obeying the law, but through faith in his Son, Jesus Christ. I may not have everything I want, but in Christ I have everything I need. I especially like what Jesus said about my earthly father giving me good things (which he did), and how much more will my heavenly Father give me the good things I need (and keeping from me the harmful things I don’t need!).\n\n2. Verse Two: Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word, that proceeds from the mouth of God. Halleju, Hallelujah. (Deuteronomy 8:3 and Matthew 4:4)\n\nThe setting: Jesus quoted this verse from Deuteronomy during the temptation in the wilderness, in response to the Tempter (Satan) telling a very hungry Jesus to turn the stones into bread so that he might eat. Considering Jesus had just fasted for forty days and nights without food, and “he was hungry” (Matthew 4:2), this seems like a reasonable suggestion. After all, God’s plan was not to have Jesus perish in the wilderness from hunger. Later, Jesus would eat plenty of bread. So why not now?\n\nWhy I like what Jesus said: When I was a kid, my focus in this passage was on the other good things I wanted to eat – ice cream, hamburgers, etc. – definitely “not bread alone.” But when I became an adult I (mostly) put aside childish things (1 Corinthians 13:11), and realized the focus here is on God’s Word. There are two things I get from this passage. First, no matter the temptation, God provides a way out through his words. Jesus rebuffed Satan’s attempt to get Jesus to use his powers for his own pleasure and benefit by quoting Scripture at him (1 Corinthians 10:13 – “No temptation. . . but God provides a way out.”). The other lesson I get is that I get to live by God’s word, that every word of God provides for me in this life by ordering how I live and by sanctifying me; and provides for my life to come by creating in me the faith through which I am saved. Truly we live by God’s Word!\n\n3. Verse Three: Ask and it shall be given unto you, Seek and ye shall find, Knock and the door will be opened unto you. Halleju, Hallelujah. (Luke 11:9-10)\n\nThe setting: Jesus’ words here follow right after he teaches the disciples the Lord’s Prayer. This teaching therefore, is an expansion of the prayer he taught them. He wanted them to know that the Father is eager to hear from them and to ask him for what they need. He gives the example of a friend who has gone to bed, but will get up when a friend knocks to wake him and ask for something. He also said that a father will give his son a loaf of bread instead of a stone, and a fish instead of a serpent. If an earthly father knows how to give good things, how much more will our heavenly Father give what is good to us!\n\nWhy I like what Jesus said: Christ promises that our prayers will be heard – and answered! Unfortunately this verse is often misused. Some people treat the “ask” part as if God were a genie, granting us “three wishes” of whatever we want. But James 4:3 warns us, “You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.” Those same people may try to seek God in all the wrong places – through false religions, self actualization, or occult practices. But the true God is found through faith in his only Son, Jesus Christ, as revealed in the Holy Bible. That Bible tells us that “there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12). And when it comes to knocking on the door, the gates of heaven will be opened to you by Christ himself, through faith in him. What these three promises have in common is that we are not really the actors; we are responding to God who invites and empowers us according to his will. We are the beneficiaries. And don’t forget, that it is Christ himself who promised to come to us: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me” (Revelation 3:20).\n\nThere you have it: a great song filled with Christ’s own words of promise to all who believe. How can you do better than that!\n\nNow may the Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you, the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.\n\nRead: Luke 11:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Matthew 6:5-14.\n\nThe song:\n\nThe Debates Go On: #4, the Final Chapter!\n\nAs we move through the history of the Christian Church, we now come to the present day. Fortunately, since all the controversies over the doctrines of the Church have been resolved over the preceding centuries, we no longer have any debates to consider. No, wait. . . there may be one or two debates still unresolved, just a few issues that are new to modern times that divide Christians today. In this, the last of my series about debates in the Church, I will present just a few current issues. Because any one of these could take entire books to discuss fully, they will just be summarized here.\n\nThe Return of Christ. Beginning in the early 1800s, people began to try to calculate when Christ will return. Using biblical prophecies about Christ’s return, a popular preacher named William Miller predicted 1844 as the time of the return. There was widespread anticipation of that date, but when it came and went with no return, it was called the Great Disappointment. Some sects interpreted Miller’s theory in news ways, leading to groups like the Seventh-Day Adventists and Jehovah’s Witnesses. Since that time there have been many date-setters, but none have been right (“But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.” Matthew 24:36) The various views today agree on the biblical texts, but interpret them differently in the following ways:\n\nPre-millennials: After a period of Great Tribulation, Christ will return in the future, then rule on earth a 1000 years. After 1000 years Satan will be released to deceive the nations, leading to a final battle before Christ wins and issues in the eternal reign.\n\nPost-millennials: The Gospel will spread, the Church will rule over the earth in peace for 1000 years, then when Christ returns, the Church will present the world to him as his kingdom.\n\nAmillennials: The 1000 years refer to the Church Age, when Christ rules over his people. Christ will return at any time to end history and rule eternally. This is the general Lutheran view.\n\nPreterists: Christ already returned in judgment in 70 AD, destroying Jerusalem (by way of the Romans) and ending Israel, which had rejected him. Jesus warned the Christians to flee when they saw the battle coming; they did, and survived the destruction. There may be a second coming when the unrealized prophecies will be fulfilled.\n\nPre-tribulation: Christians will be raptured out of the world, followed by seven years of the Great Tribulation, then return with him to rule during the Millennium. During the Millennium, the Jews will accept Christ in mass. This is the popular view espoused by the Left Behind books and movies, but was only introduced in the 1830s through purported visions.\n\nMid-tribulation: Christians will be raptured out of the world half-way during the Great Tribulation, sparing them from the worst of that period. Jews will convert, and Christians will return during the Millennium.\n\nPost-tribulation: Christians will go through the Great Tribulation, then be raptured to be with Christ to rule during the Millennium.\n\nPan-millennials: A made-up term meaning, “I don’t care which view is right; it will all pan out in the end.” Trust God for his timing!\n\nLiberal vs Conservative. These terms refer to views of the Bible and doctrines, not to political terms (though in practice, there is much correspondence). Conservative theologians and pastors believe the Bible is God’s word, inspired, infallible and inerrant, and therefore the only rule for faith and life. Liberal pastors teach that the Bible records what people wrote about God, but must be interpreted by modern understanding and science to find what truth it may contain. Thus, for example, a conservative pastor teaches that God restricts sexuality between one man and one woman in marriage. A liberal will interpret that because God is love, he accepts all kinds of sexuality as long as people “love” each other. This debate has caused splits in every major denomination over “gay” marriage and ordination. To a liberal, truth is relative and may be found in all religions.\n\nCharismatic Gifts. The historical understanding of the spiritual gifts (charismata) is that the sign gifts (tongues, prophecy, and healing) ended with the death of the apostles and their immediate disciples in the first century. On the other hand, gifts like hospitality, love, and faith have always been active in Christians. This view is called cessationism. But a different view called continuationism became popular around 1900 with the start of Pentecostalism, which taught a second baptism of the Holy Spirit. In that second baptism, gifts such as tongues, prophecy, and healing miracles were said to be bestowed on all Christians; implied by this teaching was that the lack of speaking in tongues meant a person was not really saved. Since the early days of Pentecostalism, there have been several waves of charismatic revivals. Today we are in the “Third Wave” which teaches miraculous signs and wonders to reach unbelievers with powerful acts. Some in this group claim to be like the original apostles, speaking words of God with the same authority and power. Churches opposed to this, claim the power of God is in his Word, which the Holy Spirit uses to convict the heart without flashy signs and wonders. A middle view is that while the Spirit may endow a person with a supernatural gift, the Spirit gives as he wills, and no gift is required as a sign of salvation. (Hebrews 2:4 – “gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.” and 1 Corinthians 12:11 – “All these [gifts] are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.”)\n\nEgalitarian vs Complementarian. One controversy which has ties to the liberal/conservative dispute is the question of the roles of women in the church. While everyone agrees that men and women are both created in God’s image (Genesis 1:27 – “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.”), that Jesus died to save both, and both are called to minister in various ways, the disagreement is whether women are called to be pastors in the Church.\n\nEgalitarians point to Galatians 3:8 (“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”) and to the example of women in the Bible who had some leadership role (Deborah, Priscilla, and Anna). They want the Church to be in line with modern feminism.\n\nComplementarians teach that while both men and women have roles in the church, their natures and roles are complimentary, and not identical. Specifically, only men are allowed to be pastors. They point to Paul’s instructions in 1 Timothy 2:12- “I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man.” They also point to the instructions for elders and overseers as being male-specific (“Husband of one wife” -1 Timothy 3:2) and that the 12 Disciples were all men. They also point to once a church adopts women pastors, they soon will be open to gay ordination and marriage. The AALC holds to the complimentary view.*\n\nCreation vs. Evolution. For millennia, Jews and Christians accepted the first words of the Bible: “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” (Genesis 1:1 and the chapters that followed). There were occasional skeptics, but the Church taught creation ex nihilo, that God created everything in six literal days out of nothing by the power of his word (Christ) and therefore all creation belonged to him and was sustained by his will. But beginning with the publishing of Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species (1859), the theory of evolution grew to dominate the scientific world and many churches as well. Churches’ “old time religion” was rocked to its core, because it was evident that a recent, six-day creation by God could not be reconciled with the theory of millions of years of evolution of man and the animals. As Christians wrestled with the contradictions, several ideas were adopted:\n\nTheistic evolution: God created everything, but did so using evolution over vast periods of times. (This was my view in junior high, when I “thought like a child” – 1 Corinthians 13:11).\n\nDay-age creationism: the days of Genesis 1 are not literal 24 hour days, but are much longer periods. (But how could green plants created on Day 3 survive for ages before the sun was created on Day 4?)\n\nGap theory: there is a gap between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2, which gave the earth a long time to evolve before God intervened to create man. In Genesis 1:2 the earth was made chaotic (“without form and void”). From verse 3 everything was put in order. God chose one hominid to be given special intelligence and spirit.\n\nApparent Age: God created everything with apparent age. If he intended for us to see the stars, for example, their light had to be created en route even if they were set at astronomically great distances.\n\nScientific Creationism: Uses information collected by creation-believing scientists to disprove evolution and confirm the biblical account. Some are new-earth creationists (the earth is really only 10,000s of years old), while some are old-age creationists (accepting millions of years as per secular scientists). I believe the new age creationism is correct, having read much of their literature and data.**\n\nFinally, some churches accept the secular theories of evolution as being true, while saying “the Bible is not a scientific text” but just tells of man’s spiritual development by encounters with God. By this choice, these churches lift the current theories as the authority above the Bible; where a conflict exists, they choose evolution as the real answer.\n\nThere you have it! No more debates. Just one church, united in every way. (Not!) But Paul tells us what we have is “There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call— one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all,” (Ephesians 4:4-6). Therefore, let us proclaim the one true Gospel that saves us all – “that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,” (1 Corinthians 15:3-4). Let us have unity where possible, and charity where we disagree. But in all things, let Christ be proclaimed!\n\nNow may the Lord bless you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you, the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.\n\nRead: Your choice of passages listed above!\n\n* The complementarian view is supported by the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood at CBMW.org for more information.\n\n**The scientific creationist position is presented by several organizations, including: The Institute for Creation Research which has an awesome museum in Dallas, TX (ICR.org); and Answers in Genesis, which as a museum and a life-size replica of Noah’s Ark in Kentucky (answersingenesis.org).\n\nThe Debates Go On, Part 3!\n\nThe Protestant Reformation was one of the most significant events in both Church and World history. During its early years, many debates arose between the established Roman Catholic Church, and those who tried to correct what they saw as incorrect beliefs and practices in the established Church. At first, the reformers hoped to convince Church leaders, such as the pope, to make improvements, but soon it became apparent that the Church would resist their demands, even to the point of violence and excommunication. Because most political leaders were on the side of the Church, they used force to enforce the Church’s condemnations.\n\nIt wasn’t until some princes began to side with the reformers (such as Frederick the Wise in Luther’s state of Saxony), that the protestors were free from persecution and able to continue their reform movement. Eventually, the disagreements turned to full scale war between Protestants and Catholics in what was called the Thirty Years War, which lasted from 1618 to 1648, resulting in the deaths of up to 8 million people. In the end, a treaty would allow each ruler to determine whether his realm would be Catholic or Protestant.\n\nPre-Reformation movements. Beginning over two hundred years prior to the Reformation, there were similar attempts to reform the Church. One was in the 1300’s led by John Wycliffe, called the “Morning Star” of the Reformation, who translated the Bible into English. He said the Scriptures held authority over the Pope and the Church, and that the elements in Holy Communion remained bread and wine. He was condemned as a heretic, and after he died, his bones were dug up and burned.\n\nA second attempt in the 1400’s was by a Bohemian (Czech) named Jan Hus. Hus agreed with John Wycliffe about the authority of Scripture, argued against the sale of indulgences, the appointment of Church officials based on payment of money (called simony), and the Church’s political ambitions rather than the preaching of the Gospel. He denied that the Pope was head of the Church, claiming that only Christ was the head. He established worship services in Czech instead of Latin. Finally, he was commanded to appear at the Council of Constance (Germany) in 1415 to answer charges of heresy. Though given a safe conduct pass, when he got there he was arrested and burned at the stake. His followers, called Hussites, continued to resist the authorities, until they were defeated by Catholic armies in 1434. But the spirit of Reformation continued.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation. October 31, 1517 is the date given as the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, as this was the date when Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Saxony (Germany). His questions (which he offered up for debate – maybe he read my blogs?) were critiques of the Church’s sale of indulgences. Almost immediately, copies of his theses were printed and distributed across Europe. While a lot could be said about Martin Luther and the other Protestant reformers, we’re only going to look at the issues which came up for debate between the Catholic Church and the reformers, and between the reformers themselves.\n\nJustification: by faith or works or papal decree? The Catholic Church taught that when God gave grace to people, it enabled them to do good works which in turn saved them. The Pope also claimed the power to forgive sins here and in the hereafter, thus allowing people to go to heaven. As holder of the keys to the kingdom, the Pope claimed authority over forgiveness and condemnation. Against this doctrine, the reformers claimed that we are justified by God’s grace through faith alone. The Lutheran confessions call this “the chief article of the Church,” and they appeal to Paul’s words in Romans 3:28 – “For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law,” and Romans 1:17 – “For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.””\n\nBaptism. The meaning and practice of Baptism was hotly debated. Both Catholics and Lutherans agreed that baptism was a sacrament, by which God bestowed saving grace on his people. But to the Catholics, baptism only forgave a person’s original sin (what they were born with); subsequent sins required communion or a priest’s absolution for their forgiveness. On the other hand, Lutherans said all of a person’s sins were forgiven in baptism. Contrary to both of these were the other Protestants (called Reformed) who denied the sacraments and just said baptism was just an “ordinance,” done to show one’s faith by obedience to Christ’s command. Many of the Reformed churches refused to baptize infants, calling their practices “believers’ baptisms”, even re-baptizing their members who had been baptized as children. During the Reformation, such churches were called “anabaptists,” where the prefix “ana” meant “again.” These distinctions continue to this day.\n\nHoly Communion. This period saw major debates over the meaning and practice of the Lord’s Supper. To the Catholic Church, during Communion, the priest would call down Christ into the elements and sacrifice him all over again. Only the priest drank the wine to prevent the lay from spilling Christ’s blood (although the first time Luther served communion as a priest, he shook so hard he spilled the wine himself!). They also taught transubstantiation, the turning of the bread and wine into flesh and blood. They also “reserved” the leftover elements as the transformed body of Christ. The Lutherans rejected the re-sacrifice of Christ, distributed both elements to everyone, and though treating the unused bread and wine with respect, denied that Christ was in them apart from when they were given out in Communion. Lutherans and other Protestants also rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation; Lutherans teaching that we receive the true body and blood supernaturally “in, with, and under” the bread and wine, while Reformed saying it is just symbolic, an ordinance and not a means of grace.\n\nOther Sacraments. How many sacraments (means of grace) are there? The Catholic Church claims there are 7: baptism, communion, confirmation, absolution, marriage, ordination, and last rites. Lutherans and some protestants say there are only two: baptism and communion. Other protestants call those two sacraments, ordinances, that is done by obedience to Christ but not conferring any grace.\n\nPurgatory. The Catholic Church taught the existence of Purgatory, a place after death between heaven and hell, where a person would pay the consequences of their sins by having them burned out of them (purged) so they could then go to heaven. Only the pope could shorten a person’s time of “purging.” This unbiblical doctrine was rejected by all the protestant reformers, since Christ declared on the cross that his work was “finished.”\n\nIndulgences. A real argument was whether the Pope could forgive sins (and let people who died out of purgatory) in return for a person’s payment of money or doing some worthy work. This was a great fundraiser for the Church, which at the times was building St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican and funding a war against the Turks in eastern Europe. Protestants rejected such a practice.\n\nAuthority. The question was, who had the final authority for Christians: the Bible, the Pope, or Church Councils (controlled by the pope). The Catholic Church said that the Pope stood in the place of Christ, and could decree what was true based on “oral traditions” passed down from Christ but not written in the Scriptures. Luther and the other reformers claimed that only the Scriptures had that authority (Sola Scriptura).\n\nCelibacy of Priests. The Catholic Church demanded that priests could not marry, in that they were “married” to the Church (the Bride of Christ). Luther disagreed and married a former nun to prove his point.\n\nOrdination of Clergy. According to the Catholic, Anglican, and Episcopal churches today, communion cannot be real unless a duly ordained priest “confects” the mass by his words calling down Christ into the elements. (The magicians’ phrase, “hocus pocus” is a corruption of the priest’s words when he blesses the communion bread: “Hoc est corpus meaum.” Say it aloud!) These churches believed in Apostolic Succession, the idea that only men who were ordained in an unbroken line from Peter to the popes to bishops, could be priests. The reformers said that the local congregations had the power to ordain, based on the “succession” of the apostles’ teachings (the Bible).\n\nElection. No time to go into it here, but the major protestant churches divided over the question of God’s election of who will be saved. On one side were the Calvinists, who held to double predestination (that Jesus died only for the Elect, whom God chose to be saved, while God also predetermined that everyone else will be damned); and the Arminians, who taught that Jesus died for everyone’s sins, so all people could be saved through faith. (1 John 2:2 – “He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.“). Lutherans believe a middle position, saying that man cannot save himself, apart from the work of the Holy Spirit through the Gospel. Luther put it this way in the Small Catechism: “I believe that I cannot by my own reason or strength believe in Jesus Christ, my Lord, or come to Him; but the Holy Ghost has called me by the Gospel.”\n\nWe need to stop here. As you can see, many of these debates that began during the Reformation continue until today. In addition, there are a number of new debates that have arisen in the “modern Church.” We will look at those new debates in the final blog of this series: “The Debates Go On: The Final Chapter!”\n\nNow may the Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you, the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.\n\nRead: Ephesians1:11-14; Ephesians 2:1-11; 1 John 2:1-2.\n\nThe Debates Go On, Part 2!\n\nThe recent Presidential debate so inspired me, that I decided to look into famous debates that have happened over the centuries in the Christian Church. My previous blog began that study, looking at issues the Church faced in its first few centuries, deciding a number of doctrines in the light of various heresies which cropped up and threatened to destroy the Gospel. For example, the debate whether Jesus was just a divine being that only had the appearance of man (the Docetists) or a mere human who had been endowed with some divine attributes (Arianism). The Church rejected both ideas, affirming that Jesus was both true God and true man, as stated in the Nicene Creed.\n\nCoincidentally, the Christian satire site, The Babylon Bee, just posted an article with the headline, “Scholars Now Believe Apostle Paul Spent Five Hours Per Day Arguing Online With Other Christians.” Considering all the problems his letters to the churches address, if the internet existed back then, he could well have spent that much time trying to correct them!\n\nBefore we consider the Church in the Middle Ages, there is one more ancient debate to consider: the Donatist Controversy. The question here was what happens when a priest is forced by the Roman Emperor to make a “donation” to a pagan god under punishment of law: does that render the acts of that priest (baptism and communion) invalid? The Church decided that no, the Christian sacraments are still valid, regardless of the priest’s sins or even lack of faith. This means that even today, the means of grace are still valid, even if the pastor is a fraud and an unbeliever. It is God who makes the sacraments valid, not the man.\n\nBut, now we leave the ancient church and move into medieval times, to see what debates the Church had to resolve. Unfortunately, some debates were not resolved in universally accepted manners, leading to church splits and the rise of new denominations that are still with us today.\n\n1. First, there was the debate over the preeminence of the Roman Pope. When the Bishop of Rome tried to assert his authority over the entire Christian Church, his claim was rejected by many bishops in other regions of Christendom, such as in the areas which came to be known as the Eastern Orthodox Church, and in the Northern African Churches, all of which had their own bishops. The split was formalized in the Great Schism of 1054, when East (Greek) and West (Latin) churches condemned each other and broke communion. This condemnation was not removed until the Catholic-Orthodox Joint Declaration of 1965. The split, however, continues to this day.\n\n2. The debate over predestination. Most theologians of the medieval Church believed in predestination, the doctrine that God determines ahead of time who will be saved (Ephesians 1:11, “In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will. . .”). The debate arose over what came to be called double predestination, whether God had also predestined certain people to damnation. According to this, a person’s faith was irrelevant, other than God determining whether that person would have faith. This debate arose as early as the 800’s, but continued through the Reformation (which we will consider in the next blog).\n\n3. The debate over Holy Communion. What do we receive during Holy Communion? Do we eat bread and wine, or the actual flesh and blood of Jesus? Do the elements miraculously transform on the altar by the priests’ words? Or is what we eat merely symbolic of Christ’s body? This became an important debate in the Church. One view was called the “realistic” view, which said the bread and wine turned miraculously into actual flesh and blood (transubstantiation); the other, the “symbolic view,” said that the elements remained bread and wine and gave spiritual benefits when eaten. This debate arose in the 850’s, and continues to this day, even though the Roman Church decided on transubstantiation.\n\n4. The debate between Faith versus Reason. As a result of the Crusades beginning in the 1o00’s, the works of ancient Greek philosophers became known through the Arabs who had preserved them. One that had an enormous impact was Aristotle and his call to reason. The impact this had was on the question reason played in our faith. Eventually this would give rise to the Enlightenment (1700’s), and to humanism, which made man the source of knowledge and truth, but for centuries before that, there was a huge conflict between truths learned through reason (including science and philosophy), and God’s revealed knowledge through the Scriptures. That’s why Galileo could be imprisoned for his scientific discoveries as being “opposed to faith.”\n\nIn the Catholic Church, St. Thomas Aquinas formed what became known as “Scholasticism” that employed a critical method of philosophical analysis predicated upon Aristotle’s teachings. By doing so, scholars sought to learn all attainable truth, whether revealed or not. Many of the universities of this time were founded on such teachings and philosophical methods. One of the products of this school of thought was the theory of transubstantiation, which used the Aristotelian categories of “essence” and “accidents” to describe the mass. In that view, the elements, when blessed, retained their accidents -(their physical form) but changed their essence (their actual nature). Luther argued against this view, saying that the Church should not base its doctrine on a pagan philosopher, but on the words of Christ in Scripture. Luther recited Jesus’s words at the Last Supper, when Jesus said, “This is my body, this is my blood,” as proof we receive Christ’s true body and blood.\n\n5. The debate between Church and State. The Christian Church went from being persecuted, to tolerated (Constantine’s Edict of Milan in 313 AD), to become the official religion of the Roman Empire in 380 AD with the decree of the Edict of Thessalonica. But when the Roman empire was sacked by the barbarians, the Christian Church became the default unifying force in Europe. For one thing, it was a Pope (Leo I) who saved Rome from Attila the Hun in 451 AD, not by force of arms, but by prayer and persuasion. Also, when Europe was united under the Emperor Charlemagne, it was another pope, Pope Leo III, who crowned him Holy Roman Emperor on Christmas Day in 800 AD. That set the pattern for the church as supreme over state.\n\nHowever, throughout this period, tensions and struggles for power between kings and Popes continued. Part of this was philosophical/theological, but much had to do with money and political control. For example, German bishops of the period had castles and lands, and could enforce taxes and river tolls on boats.\n\nProblems occurred when the Church tried to enforce allegiance to the faith or to religious authority by the power of the State, such as through various Inquisitions, and when the State claimed power over the Church, such as when Henry VIII of England formed the Church of England and declared himself as the head of that Church (and disbanded Catholic convents and monasteries in England, Wales, and Ireland, and seized their wealth and assets).\n\nOne doctrine which arose was the idea of God’s two hands: his right hand the church, and his left hand the state. Each had its own God-ordained roles to play in the affairs of men. One to proclaim the Gospel, the other to use the Law to refrain evil. Luther called this division the “proper” work of God (by the Church’s proclaiming salvation through the Gospel), and the “alien” work of God, restraining evil by the power of governments. This is also called the “Two kingdoms” theory. Both are instituted by God to do his works and must be respected. (Romans 13:1 “Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.“)\n\nThese and other debates continued through the medieval period, and affect us even today. Our First Amendment addresses the Church/State debate by establishing freedom of religion, saying: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” However, most recently, the State ordered churches to be shut down for the COVID pandemic, citing public health reasons. Some churches refused to do so, claiming freedom of religion, which is in keeping with the “Two kingdoms” doctrine.\n\nWe have now come to the end of medieval times. Before us now are the debates of the Reformation, which we will consider in the next blog, known, to no surprise, as Part 3 of The Debates Go On!\n\nNow may the Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you, the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace. Amen.\n\nRead: Romans 13:1-7; 1 Corinthians 11:22-24; Ephesians 1:11-14.\n\nThe Debates Go On!\n\nWell, the first (and only?) Presidential debate is over. Now it’s up to the pundits, and the voters, to decide what it all means. Depending what side the commentators are on, they will “debate” with each other how the two candidates did. In that sense, the debates go on.\n\nBut that’s not what I mean when I say “the debates go on!” What I mean is that in the Christian Church, ever since Christ came to reveal God and his plan to us, and the prophets and apostles have inscribed God’s word to us in the Scriptures, there have always been debates within and without the Church. The debates have been about how to interpret those writings, and about what Christians should believe as true.\n\nWhen such debates arose, they have led to church splits, wars, heresies, and confusion. While no conflict is desired among those who are called to be one in Christ (“one Lord, one faith, one baptism” – Ephesians 4:5), it has been necessary to decide which beliefs are true, that is, in accord with what God has revealed, and condemn the falsehoods. Such divisions have sometimes been resolved through “debates” in official Church Councils such as the one in Nicaea in 325, and in Chalcedon in 451. Those gatherings of Christian leaders settled many issues, and wrote Creeds which we still recite regularly in church services. Some wrong teachings had arisen even while the Apostles were still alive, leading them to write strong letters against the falsehoods, thus guiding the Church in the right direction.\n\nWhat are the specific “debates” that had to be resolved over the centuries? Here are some of the more important ones:\n\nThe Judaizers. This early problem happened during Apostolic times. The issue was whether Gentiles who believed in Christ had to become Jews first, being circumcised and having to adhere to the Jewish Law. When the church in Galatia fell into this error, the Apostle Paul wrote to them to correct their theology. He began his letter to them:\n\n“I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.” (Galatians 1:6-7ff).\n\nThe issue was settled at the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), where it was decided that Gentile converts did not have to become Jews, but had only to refrain from sexual immorality, from blood, and from food which had been offered to idols (Acts 15:28-29). At stake here was the freedom of the gospel, and the recognition that faith in Christ, and not the works of the law, saves.\n\n2. The Colossian heresy. Apparently, false teachings were circulating among the believers in the city of Colossae. This heresy combined adherence to rituals and laws, and asceticism, denial of food and drink. By these actions, people diminished the role of Christ, and put their trust in their own actions to be acceptable to God. Paul’s letter to the Colossians corrected this opinion, by stressing the preeminence of Christ and the folly of observing asceticism or special days as having merit. Paul wrote, “For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him” (Colossians 1:16-17). And in 2:16 he said, “Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.” Such things, he insisted, were fulfilled in Christ.\n\n3. Gnosticism. Related to the Colossian heresy, this heresy was widespread, affecting many churches and resulting in the writing of many false gospels such as the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Judas. “Gnostikos” is a Greek word meaning “learned” or “having knowledge.” It was a system of beliefs that salvation could be gained through a special form of secret knowledge, which came to certain people directly from God, and not from the Scriptures. The heresy also taught that physical matter was evil, and the spiritual was good; therefore some Gnostics believed Christ only appeared to have a physical body, since God could not be held in an evil body. The Church rejected this heresy and the writings it produced.\n\n4. The Arian heresy. Settling this debate was the purpose of the Council of Nicaea. What happened was a false teacher named Arius was having a great influence among many churches. His teaching was that Jesus was not equal to God nor of the same substance, but was made by God and therefore inferior to God. This was in conflict with John 1: 1 which states that “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.” and “the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). Our Nicene Creed states that Jesus is “God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father.” This was a direct refutation of the Arian heresy, and was opposed by Athanasius, after whom one of the creeds is named. (By the way, Jehovah’s Witnesses are a modern day Arian sect.)\n\n5. The Montanism heresy. In the 2nd century, a man named Montanus fell into a trance and began to “prophesy under the influence of the Spirit.” He was soon joined by two young women, Prisca, and Maximilla, who also began to prophesy. They taught a rigorous asceticism, and that the Holy Spirit spoke aloud through their trances. They taught the imminent return of Christ, and many of their followers abandoned home and church to be where Montanus said the New Jerusalem would descend. The heresy flourished for several centuries, but finally died out. However, in today’s church, there are many so called “prophets” who claim to speak words from God, and manifest bizarre symptoms, and also prophesy Christ’s imminent return.\n\n6. The Pelagian heresy. This controversy began in the 4th century when a British theologian named Pelagius taught that man is born without original sin (born good) and by good living and choices could obtain salvation. He was opposed by Augustine and condemned by the Synod of Jerusalem in 415. This is still a common teaching among theologically liberal churches, and was even spoken by Pope Francis, who said in a 2024 60 Minutes interview, “We are fundamentally good. … the heart itself is good.” But the Bible says in Jeremiah 17:9, teaches the opposite: “The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?” And Paul teaches that sin has come to all because of one man. In other words, original sin. Romans 5:12 says, “Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned.”\n\n7. The “Filioque clause.” Not an argument over a heresy, but a debate which highlights one of the doctrinal difference leading to a schism between the Orthodox churches and the western (Roman) churches. The dispute is about one phrase in the Nicene Creed where it says that the Holy Spirit, “proceeds from the Father and the Son.” (western version). Or, he “proceeds from the Father,” (Eastern Orthodox version). The Creed originally had only “from the Father,” but in the 6th century, the Roman Church added the “filioque” which mean “and the Son.” Partly this was done to oppose the Arians by showing the Son’s equality with the Father. At the time, both the eastern and the western churches hurled condemnations at each other over this phrase, but recently there have been attempts to reconcile. One of the issues has been, differences in the understanding of what the word, “proceeding,” means.\n\nIt was important for the Church to address these heresies and disputes, in order that the true faith be taught and preached, that the true Gospel be believed – for there is no other Gospel (Galatians 1:6-7). Of course, the debates didn’t end in the first couple centuries after Christ. They continued in the centuries that followed, which will come in the next blog!\n\nNow may the Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you, the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.\n\nRead: 2 Timothy 2:14-26.\n\nWhat About the Sabbath?\n\nToday in church I heard a sermon from a guest pastor speaking about God’s commandment to remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. He recounted growing up under what were known as Blue Laws, which required local businesses to be closed on Sundays. He then asserted that although the civil laws have changed, God’s command still applies to us today. He then explained that he prefers to be the only person “working” near the altar during a service to prevent the lay people from sinning by working on the Sabbath; they are supposed to be resting during the service. Of course, then he had to acknowledge that we had lay people reading the scriptures and assisting with communion in our service!\n\nWhen the service ended, I found myself uneasy in the wake of this law-heavy sermon. Was he right? Was I (and our church) taking the matter of the Sabbath too lightly? What does the Bible teach about the Sabbath and what we are to do to observe it rightly?\n\nFirst of all, I also grew up where there were either Blue Laws or at least the custom of everything being closed on Sundays. I remember when a new store came in and announced Sunday hours; a group of pastors led a protest in front of the store. The protestors failed to dissuade the store, however, when it was obvious the crowds in the store were greater than those outside protesting.\n\nI also remember asking my dad, who was a devout Christian man, why he often went to work on Sundays at the YMCA. He explained that as Christ healed on the Sabbath, he too was doing the Lord’s work when he went in. I accepted that distinction – which helped a lot later when my own primary work day (some would say only work day) would become Sundays!\n\nSo, what about the Sabbath for Christians?\n\n1. We note the Sabbath was ordained by God at the beginning of creation. We read in Genesis 1 and 2, that the Lord created the earth and all things in six days, and then rested on the seventh day. Genesis 2 tells us:\n\nAnd on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.\n\nThe word Sabbath comes from the Hebrew Shin-Beit-Tav (שַׁבָּת) and means “to cease, to end, to rest.” Thus, Sabbath means to rest.\n\n2. God commanded the Israelites to observe the Sabbath as part of the Ten Commandments he gave at Sinai (Deuteronomy 5:12-15):\n\n“Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant, or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.”\n\n3. The day designated the Sabbath was the seventh day of the week, known to us as Saturday. Observant Jews keep Saturday as their Sabbath, and so do various Christian sects, most notably, the Seventh Day Adventists. They are right: Saturday is the Sabbath. If we are going to be strict about God’s commandment, we should observe Saturday as our Sabbath. So, Sunday Blue Laws or the practice of keeping lay people from assisting worship become irrelevant if Sunday is not the Sabbath.\n\n4. And yet, we Christians do worship on Sunday, the first day of the week, the Lord’s Day, and consider it to be our Sabbath. In a sense we are treating it as a day of rest, so in a sense we are working six days and treating Sunday as our Sabbath. But how did Sunday become our day of worship and rest?\n\nJesus Christ rose from the dead on Sunday. “Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb” (John 20:1). This is why we call it the Lord’s Day.\n\nJesus first appeared to the disciples on two consecutive Sundays. “On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”” (John 20:19) and “Eight days later [one week in Jewish reckoning], his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”2(John 20:26).\n\nThe Holy Spirit descended on the disciples on a Sunday, birthing the Christian Church: “When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance” (Acts 2:1-4).\n\nThe Apostle John received his revelation on a Sunday. “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying, ‘Write what you see in a book . . .'” (Revelation 1:10-11a).\n\nPaul addressed the church in Corinth to gather a collection for other needy Christians on Sundays. He said, “On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that there will be no collecting when I come.” This showed the church was gathering each week on that day.\n\nCertainly, these passages show that Sundays became the important day of the week for Christians. But if Sunday is our Sabbath, does that mean the Old Testament laws just shift one day for Christians?\n\nNo, there is a difference, and that is Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath, has fulfilled the Sabbath rest and therefore, those who are in him, through faith, now perfectly observe the Lord’s Sabbath command.\n\nMany times was Jesus confronted by the Pharisees, who complained that Jesus and his disciples violated the Sabbath laws. They complained when one Sabbath the disciples began to pluck heads of grain. “And the Pharisees were saying to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?” Again, the Pharisees complained when Jesus healed on the Sabbath. They complained that he healed a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath (Matthew 12:10), cast out an unclean spirit from a man (Mark 1:21), cast out a woman’s disabling spirit (Luke 13:14), and healed a crippled man (John 5:9) – all on Sabbaths. Jesus’s reply to their criticisms:\n\nHe did these things anyway, without apology.\n\nHe showed that acts of mercy triumphed over the rules of men. “You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it?” (Luke 13:15). Again, he said, “Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?” (Matthew 12:11).\n\nHe gave us the proper context for the Sabbath. “And he said to them, ‘The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.'” (Mark 2:27-28).\n\nThe Sabbath commandment is the only Ten Commandment not repeated in the New Testament. It has been fulfilled in Christ, who is our Sabbath rest.\n\nTherefore, if we serve the Lord on the Lord’s Day, worshiping him as we ought, in spirit and in truth, whether clergy or lay, as Christians we are in Christ, and are therefore we are not sinning in any way.\n\nShould you still wonder about this matter, consider Paul’s letter to the Colossians, where he wrote: “Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.” The true Sabbath is Christ, in whom we live and move and have our being.\n\nNow may the Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make hi face to shine upon you and be gracious to you, the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.\n\nRead: Mark 2:23-28.\n\nTrial of the Century\n\nAccording to various opinion writers, the trial of the century has just concluded in New York, resulting in the conviction of a former President. But when I think of the most momentous trial of the century, I think of one specific trial in the last century that hardly made the newspapers or even caused a stir, but was in a way so significant that it bears our remembrance.\n\nThat trial took place in the 1930s, and ironically, also took place in New York.\n\nIt was Christmas Eve, and the Mayor of New York, Fiorello LaGuardia (as in the airport), decided to let one of the municipal judges go home for the holiday. So the mayor robed up, and took his place on the bench. He then signaled the bailiff to bring in the first case. As it turned out, the first case was of a woman charged with theft. The accuser was a baker who stood up, pointed his finger at the woman, and said, “She stole a loaf of bread from me!” LaGuardia asked the woman, “Is this true?” The woman sobbed and said it was true, but added, “I took it to feed my child, because we had no food!”\n\nLaGuardia sat there silent for a moment. Should he have compassion and let her go for such a minor offense, or enforce the law which said her act was a crime? He was a judge; how could he ignore the law? At that point, he must have regretted sending the judge home! As he pondered what to do, the courtroom became quiet as all eyes were on him. He had to act. . . .\n\nSuddenly, he reached a decision. He lifted his gavel, and rapped it down on the desk with a loud bang. “Guilty!” he charged, “The fine is $5.00!” The whole court gasped. Five dollars then is worth $114 today. There was no way the woman could pay it; if she had that much money she could have bought hundreds of loaves of bread! The woman began to sob loudly, but then, she and the whole courtroom became silent again, as LaGuardia got down off the bench, and walked over to the bailiff. He took out his wallet, pulled out a five dollar bill, and paid the fine for the woman. Then he announced,”And I am fining everyone in this courtroom 50 cents for living in a city where a woman has to steal a loaf of bread to feed her child!” Then he collected the fines, and gave them to the woman. With a final wish of “Merry Christmas,” LaGuardia called for the next case.\n\nWhy do I consider this the trial of its century? Because it is a perfect example of the day we stand before our Judge to give an account of our lives. There is no doubt this will happen to us all, whether believers in Christ or not. We will all stand before God’s great white throne, and our lives will be revealed before the perfect Judge. No rationalizing our sins, or getting off “on a technicality.” No excuses or shifting blame. Every act and every word laid bare. Yikes!\n\nRevelation 20:12 says, “And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.”\n\nJesus tells us in Matthew 12:36, “But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.“\n\nAnd Paul wrote in Romans 14:12,”So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.”\n\nWhen that day comes, we will realize that the sentence – death and hell – is too much to pay. We will not have a plea in and of ourselves. All our good works won’t atone for the sentence we deserve. Like the woman, we have nothing and are at the mercy of the Judge.\n\nBut then, something miraculous happens. The Judge himself get down off the throne, and he reads from the book of life. He announces that our name is written in it. Then he shows the scars in his hands and feet, and proclaims for all to hear, “I paid this one’s debt.” Then he clothes us in his righteous robes (Isaiah 61:10), gives us his inheritance (Colossians3:24), and welcomes us into heaven for all eternity (John 3:16).\n\nBut, what about our record of sin? Gone. This is good news!\n\nColossians 2:13-14 “And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.”\n\nPsalm 103:12 “as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.”\n\nHebrews 8:12 “For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.”\n\nHebrews 10:17 “I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.”\n\nThis is the future for all who believe in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. The Bible promises that those in Christ will not perish. The whole New Testament is built on that promise, secured by Christ’s own death and resurrection, but key promises are the following:\n\nJohn 11:25-26 “Jesus said to [Martha], ‘I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die'”\n\nMark 16:16 “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved.”\n\nActs 4:12 “And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”\n\nRomans 12:9 “because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”\n\nIn the 18th chapter of the Book of Genesis, Abraham had an encounter with God before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham bargained with God regarding how many righteous people in those cities it would take for God to spare them. (Obviously, not enough.) But one thing that Abraham said stuck with me, and informs my thinking about God as our Judge. Abraham said, “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?”\n\nThe Judge of all the earth shall indeed do what is right and just. He will punish the sins of unrepentant unbelievers, and forgive the sins of those who believe and trust in his Son, Jesus Christ. He will keep his promises, upholding equally his righteous laws and his merciful grace. We will never in eternity wonder whether any of God’s judgments were wrong. His judgments are perfect (Revelation 16:7), even when he gets off the throne to pay our sentence. For each of us, THAT will be OUR trial of the century!\n\nNow may the Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you, the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.\n\nRead: Genesis 18:22-33; Revelation 16:1-10\n\nThe Legacy\n\nLately, I have been contemplating the issue of legacies. In other words, what heritage do we leave behind when our time on earth is done? A legacy is defined as “Something handed down from an ancestor or a predecessor or from the past: a heritage.”* So, the legacy may be something handed down to an heir, or it may be more general, as in, how is the world in general different because a person lived? Legacies may be financial, or in the persons of children and grandchildren, or in lives affected by how a person has lived. A legacy may be good, or conversely, it may be bad. An example of a good legacy is Martin Luther; an example of a bad legacy would be a certain other German named Adolph.\n\nThis has become a topic for me as I consider my own mortality. Having matured to the range the Bible gives for life expectancy (“The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty;” Psalm 90:10, which is the same range in current U.S. statistics -77.5)** Also, being in dialysis, I am constantly reminded that my own longevity depends on hooking up to a machine three times a week. So, it gets a person thinking.\n\nAnother reason it has come to the forefront of my thoughts is the recent death of Pastor Steve Lundblom. I had worked with Steve for many years, first when he was our church’s youth director, and then when he was our associate pastor. He was loved by everybody, both here and later, when he moved to Williston, North Dakota, by the church he pastored there. His life was shortened due to illness at the age of 57.\n\nThis past weekend, four of us flew to Williston for Steve’s memorial service. First came an evening of shared memories at the funeral home. Then, on Friday, was the actual service. The messages were consistent: Steve impacted everyone’s life for the better; his solid faith, his sense of humor, his intelligence and knowledge, his love for people, all endeared him to everybody. The church full of mourners who celebrated him, showed how much Steve touched everyone’s life. Steve left a legacy – in his marriage, in his sons, in his granddaughter, and in other family and friends. And of course, in Christ’s Church. The world is better now for his having lived.\n\nSo what about the rest of us? What kind of legacy will we leave? And more important, what kind of legacy does God want us to leave?\n\nSometimes, people have grandiose ideas of what it means to serve God and accomplish some great work which God has for them to do. For example, to create a new church, to have some high political office, to invent a cure or new machine, or to become a social media influencer. . . in other words, to have a great impact on the world. But the Bible does not talk of any of these things. What the Bible talks of is the everyday works of love, compassion, service, and witness to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. These are works of love for God and love for our neighbor that are things we are called to do, no matter what situations we find ourselves in. To live a life that counts is to live a life with our focus on Jesus Christ, and not on ourselves. In the words of the gospel song,\n\n“Turn your eyes upon Jesus,\n\nLook full in His wonderful face,\n\nAnd the things of earth will grow strangely dim,\n\nIn the light of His glory and grace.”***\n\nSo what does the Bible say about the works we do in this life?\n\n“For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.” (Ephesians 2:10). God has works for each of us to do. Note that works is plural: there are numerous works each of us has – prepared by God for us to do. These works do not save us, but are expressions of our love for our neighbor. These may be small things, or big things. When we look back on our lives, we may not see any big accomplishments from an earthly view, but those little acts of kindness done for the Lord may have created a huge legacy in the effect they had on the people we met.\n\n“If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person’s work. If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward. If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even though only as one escaping through the flames.” ( 1 Corinthians 3:12-5). This passage makes the distinction between the works that have meaning and will last, and those human endeavors that may seem impressive but will perish. Thus, a kind act to alleviate suffering may have eternal consequences, while a life of fame and wealth may die with the person. Maybe the Sunday School you taught, the witness you gave a fellow worker, the respect you showed someone, will have eternal fruit.\n\n“His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’” (Matthew 2:25). In this parable taught by Jesus, three servants were entrusted with varying amounts of wealth to manage in their master’s absence. Two invested their sums and earned more for their master, while one did not. When the master returned, he praised the two who earned interest, saying that because they had been faithful with a little, he would now put them in charge of much. This deals with the truth that while we may have different abilities and resources, what matters is not the size of the work we were given, but the fact that we were faithful with the little we have.\n\nFinally, we read “A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children, but the sinner’s wealth is laid up for the righteous.” (Proverbs 13:22). While this proverb speaks about an inheritance of wealth, the principle applies to the impact a good man or woman has on those who follow them. A legacy of faith, of morals, of character, of compassion, of love – these are all legacies of a spiritual nature far more valuable than any material inheritance. These are modeled by a person’s life, and then are emulated by those whose lives they influence. They are the most valuable gift one can leave to others.\n\nWe may be unaware of the extent of the legacy we will leave behind. In Pastor Steve’s case, one legacy was revealed by an anonymous note sent to his obituary page by a trucker in Canada who happened to hear a radio broadcast of one of Steve’s sermons. He said, “I never met Steve , I wish I could have been his friend. I heard him speak every Sunday on the internet, and its like the nature of Christ came through him when he spoke.”\n\nMay we also leave such a legacy, that people hear Christ, and come to know Christ, through the words we speak, and the works we do. May we hear Christ call us when we go to him: “Well done, good and faithful servant.”\n\nNow may the Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you, the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.\n\nRead: Matthew 25:14-30\n\n*The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition.\n\n** Center For Disease Control, National Center For Health Statistics.\n\n*** Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus, Helen H. Lemmel, 1922.\n\nUnanswered Prayer?\n\nLast night I had a dream. It was a recurring one of sorts, in which I am leading worship but am unprepared for it. I don’t have my robes, haven’t picked what hymns to sing, haven’t written a sermon – you get the idea. A pastor’s nightmare! Especially when the congregation slips away while I’m trying to get myself together.\n\nExcept, in this dream, I actually knew what I was going to preach. The sermon formed fully in my mind, so when I suddenly awoke from my dream I had a smile on my face. I knew what my next blog would be!\n\nIn my sermon, I would begin by telling you that like you, I have times that I am disappointed with God. Not that I would want any other God, but that there are times when my prayers – even fervent ones, go unanswered. I pray that someone I know will be healed of some dread disease, but they get worse, until they die. Or some handicap gets worse, crippling the person. Or even that some newborn suffers birth defects and faces multiple surgeries to lead a somewhat normal life. Or an eagerly anticipated child is stillborn.\n\nThere were times I was sure our prayers would be answered – when multiple people prayed, when we anointed the sick person with oil (as per James 5:14-15- “Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up.”) Once, the person went into remission, only to die soon after.\n\nSo, we complain to God “Why don’t you do what we ask! We don’t ask for much! Just this one healing!” We join with the complaints of the psalmist and cry:\n\nPsalm 56:1 Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me; all day long an attacker oppresses me.\n\nPsalm 3:1-2 O Lord, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me; many are saying of my soul, “There is no salvation for him in God.”\n\nPsalm 6:6-7 I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping. My eye wastes away because of grief; it grows weak because of all my foes.\n\nPsalm 13:1 How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?\n\nPsalm 69:1-3 Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck. I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me. I am weary with my crying out; my throat is parched. My eyes grow dim with waiting for my God.\n\nYes, these (and many other psalms) come to mind when God doesn’t answer our prayers as we want. But even when psalms cry out to complaints to God, they usually end with declarations like: “salvation belongs to the Lord;\n\nyour blessing be on your people!” (Psalm 3); “But I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.” (Psalm 13); and “Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves in them.” (Psalm 69). So, how do all these complaints to God end us praising him anyway?\n\nWhat do the psalmists know about God that we need to keep in mind?\n\nGod is God. He is the one in charge, and he does everything according to his will. You can not make God do anything. He can not be tempted, bullied, controlled, or bargained with. James 1:13 says, “God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one.” and Ephesians 1:11 says, “In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will.”\n\nEven the lifespan of everyone is set by God: Psalm 90 says we are to “number our days,” and Psalm 39:4 “Show me, LORD, my life’s end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is.” Job 14:6 declares, “Since his days are determined, and the number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his limits that he cannot pass.” And Jesus reminded us in Matthew 6:27, “And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?“\n\nGod sees the end of things from the beginning. He knows how everything will end, and how changes would effect everything. Isaiah 46:10, says God “declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, ‘My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose.’” We see what we want, but God sees the result of our getting what we want. What looks good to us, may in God’s eyes be the worst that could happen to us.\n\nGod has an eternal perspective. God may, unknown to you, use your suffering to reach other people with his gospel. The Christian martyr, Telemachus, died while trying to stop a gladiator fight, and led to the emperor outlawing future gladiatorial contests. Father Damien, a missionary to the lepers on Molokai, failed in his mission until he caught leprosy, then saw his mission succeed.\n\nGod may already be putting things in motion to answer our prayer without our knowing it. He doesn’t need to reveal all he is doing; we don’t need to see or approve all his efforts. Until we see the final results, we are to be patient and have faith.\n\nGod disciplines those he loves. Sometimes, the harsh outcomes we are experiencing comes directly from God as a blessing in disguise. This apparent contradiction is revealed in Deuteronomy 8:5: “Know then in your heart that, as a man disciplines his son, the Lord your God disciplines you.” Also, Hebrews 12:6 says, “For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.” Hebrews 12:11 sums up the benefit of the Lord’s discipline: “For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.“\n\nOnly God has the power to do what we ask for. He is omnipotent. We look to him as the grantor and author of all our needs. Like the hymn, “I sing the mighty power of God who fill the earth with food”* he provides all our needs. He can creates something from nothing, as Romans 4:17 says, he “calls into existence the things that do not exist.” He knows what we need before we ask (Matthew 6:8), and gives us good things instead of bad: “What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent?” (Luke 11:11).\n\nSo we keep praying, making our needs known to God, submitting ourselves prayerfully to him, whether or not we see immediate answers to our prayers. Because he is our God, the source of our life and our salvation. To him only go our prayers. From him only come the answers! And that, is no dream!\n\nNow may the Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you, the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.\n\nRead: James 4:1-11.\n\n* Isaac Watts, I Sing the Mighty Power of God, pub. 1715\n\nTotal Eclipse of the Son\n\nLast weekend, Karen and I flew to Dallas, Texas to be in the totality zone of this year’s total eclipse of the sun. We weren’t so sure it would work out, given weather forecasts of clouds and possible storms for the Dallas area. Indeed, when we arrived there Sunday evening, it was overcast with clouds. But on Monday, the day of the eclipse, the sky cleared and we were blessed with a warm (but not hot), sunny day with light, cool breezes. On top of that, we had a great viewing venue at a cousin of mine’s church grounds. Our relatives and we had an unobstructed view, and enjoyed snacks provided by the church to all attendees: Sun Chips and Moon Pies. It was a perfect day, ending with a great dinner out with the family at a local restaurant. This is one of the pictures of the eclipse at totality*:\n\nTo celebrate the event, I wore a t-shirt given me for the occasion by friend Dave. The shirt summed up the experience: “Traveled Miles for Seconds of Darkness Worth Every Penny.”\n\nAt the end of that wonderful day, my cousin sat down with us, and becoming very serious, told us the news of the diagnosis they had just received just days earlier, that her husband had advanced melanoma cancer, and if untreated, had about six months to live. They had kept the news to themselves all day so as not to spoil our eclipse!\n\nThe next day, my cousin, her husband, Karen, and I toured a local creation museum (ICR Discovery Center**) in Dallas, which is a Christian ministry that researches and advocates the connection of true science to what the Bible teaches about the creation. My cousin and her husband are strong Christians, which is a major factor in how they are dealing with the devastating diagnosis. We are joining them and our churches in praying for his healing and their peace.\n\nWhen I thought about their faith and the sureness of all our hope in Jesus Christ and what he has accomplished for us now and for all eternity, I wondered as I often have at the difference it makes in having Christ when we face difficulties and tragedies in life. My cousin and her husband have Christ and it will make a huge difference for their coming journey, wherever it leads. But what about those who don’t have the promises of Christ? What about those who don’t have the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, to work in their spirits to face all that life brings?\n\nYou might say that those without Christ are suffering from “A total eclipse of the Son.”\n\nNot knowing Christ’s love, they face life on their own. They have only a few fallible or fickle people to turn to when troubles happen, and facing the end of life they have nothing sure to anticipate. No “better place” to go to, no eternal life or fellowship with God.\n\nUnfortunately, our society, once founded on the Christian faith (Harvard was originally a seminary for training Christian pastors!), has done all it can to block out the Son of God from our lives and thoughts. Consider:\n\nRenaming of time periods from B.C. (Before Christ) and A.D. (Anno Domini = Year of our Lord), to B.C.E. (Before the Common Era) and C.E. (Common Era). Why should we date everything from the most important event in all history?\n\nComplete omission of any reference to the biblical account of creation in our schools or public life. Only secular explanations are allowed, even when the evidence supports creation. (Hence the need for creation organizations such as the one we visited.) An example of what happens when you go counter to the narrative: the California Superintendent of Schools tried to shut down the Institute for Creation Research for not teaching evolution, even after an accreditation committee approved the Institute. (Which is why they moved from San Diego to Dallas!)\n\nSeparation of church and state used to mean non-interference of government in religion, now it means the government stamping religion out of the public life. Example: The state of Washington was giving out college scholarships for any kind of degree – except for a Christian student applying for seminary studies. And the courts upheld the denial, saying such a grant would be the state supporting a religion.\n\nMost Hollywood TV shows and movies mock religious people as ignorant hicks, or as charlatan preachers, as violent racists, or as criminals wearing crosses. One example was the first episode of a new show on British security services, where the villain was a pro-life American who was going to bomb an abortion clinic. Watch carefully the next show you see for similar themes!\n\nAnd need I say anything about shows celebrating “the true meaning of Christmas” without even mentioning Jesus?\n\nThe FBI was calling devout Catholics terror threats, and placed undercover agents in churches to spy on them. The FBI called conservative Catholics, “Radical-Traditionalist Catholics.”\n\nThe LA Times published an article about the growing godlessness in America, and said, “This increasing godlessness in America is actually a good thing, to be welcomed and embraced.”***\n\nOur Secretary of State called for a cease-fire in Israel and quoted the Quran (Surah 5:32) rather than Jesus’ words about peacemakers (Matthew 5:9).\n\nIn 2022, the Justice Department prosecuted a record 26 pro-life advocates. Meanwhile, last year, nearly 100 attacks against pregnancy resource centers and churches went unpunished.\n\nThe arrest of pro-life activist Mark Houck while at home with his wife and children. A SWAT team burst in with automatic weapons drawn and arrested him in front of his children.His crime was praying in front of an abortion clinic and defending his son from an attack. Charges were later dropped.\n\nI could go on, but you get the point. Not only is Christ excluded from public life, society is aggressively counter to Christian faith and his Church, and has tried in many ways to suppress, ostracize, and (ironically) demonize it.\n\nBut for us who believe in Jesus Christ, and the words of Scripture that give testimony to him, we see such events as the solar eclipse just one more reason to glorify our Creator. Hear what God’s Word says about creation:\n\n“In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” (Genesis 1:1).\n\n“God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.” (Genesis 1:16-18).\n\n“This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.” (Genesis 2:4).\n\n“When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?” (Psalm 8:3-4).\n\n“Through him [the Word = Christ] all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.” (John 1:3).\n\n“For in him [the Son] all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.” (Colossians 1:16-17).\n\n“For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.” (Hebrews 3:4).\n\n“Ah, Lord God! It is you who have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you.” (Jeremiah 32:17).\n\n“I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come? My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.” (Psalm 121:1-2).\n\n“By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host.” (Psalm 33:6).\n\nIn a way, all of Scripture is built around the fact that God created all things, including us, whom he made in his image, whom he gave the breath of life, and for whom he sent his own Son to redeem from the curse of sin and death. It’s amazing to realize that the greatest of all miracles, beyond even the stars, sun, and moon (and their eclipses!), is our redemption and new life in Christ.\n\nAnd for my cousin and her husband, there remains the following words from Psalm 124:8, “Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.” Amen!\n\nNow may our Creator Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you, the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.\n\nRead: Genesis 1; Psalm 8; Colossians 1:15-23\n\n*Photo of this eclipse by Brian R.\n\n**See the website at https://discoverycenter.icr.org\n\n*** LA Times, b Phil Zuckerman,\n\nHe Is Risen, Indeed!\n\nThe story is told about an incident in the early days of the Soviet Union. A commissar and his cohorts arrived in a small town and gathered up the locals into the town square. There he began to harangue the crowd about the blessings of the new soviet state. After two hours his speech took aim at the local priest and his church, claiming that religion was obsolete. After another hour directed against Christianity, the commissar concluded his speech with a smug smile, knowing his arguments were unassailable. He challenged the priest, saying, “And what do you have to say?” Then the priest stepped forward and cried,”Christ is risen!” to which the people replied in one voice:”He is risen, indeed!” It is amazing that even in the days of the atheistic Soviet Union, the Russian word for Sunday was Воскресенье (pronounced voskreseniye), meaning “Resurrection Day.” And we in the West named our day after the sun!\n\n“Christ is risen! He is risen indeed!”\n\nThat chorus will be heard proclaimed in churches around the world this Easter Sunday, just as it has been down through the centuries for almost 2000 years. Jesus Christ’s resurrection is the most life-changing, world-overturning, and hope-creating event in all of history. Without it there would be no Easter, of course. Without it, neither would there be a Christian Church. Without it, (shudder!) there would be no pastors emeriti! Without it, there would be no resurrection for you and me, nor hope of eternal life to come. But, Christ is risen (He is risen indeed!) and therefore we do have the sure and certain hope of our own resurrection to come, based on the historical fact of Christ’s resurrection and the biblically-revealed significance of what happened that first Easter.\n\nMany people doubt that the resurrection happened, or is even possible, because they have never witnessed one in their life. But, the Bible recounts 10 resurrections, instances when people died and were brought back to life. Briefly, these are:\n\nThe son of a widow in Zarephath. Raised by Elijah in 1 Kings 17:17-24.\n\nThe son of a Shunammite woman. Raised by Elisha in 2 Kings 4:18-37.\n\nA man whose body was tossed into Elisha’s tomb and came to life after touching Elisha’s bones. (2 Kings 13:20-21).\n\nThe son of a widow from Nain. Jesus raised him in Luke 7:11-17.\n\nJairus’s daughter. Jesus raised her in Luke 8:40-56.\n\nLazarus. Jesus raised him after four days in John 11:1-44.\n\nDead saints at Jesus’ crucifixion, recounted in Matthew 27:50-53.\n\nA girl named Tabitha (also called Dorcas) raised by Peter in Acts 9:36-42.\n\nA man named Eutychus raised by Paul in Acts 20:7-12. (The man had fallen asleep during one of Paul’s sermons, and fell out a window to his death!\n\nI may have preached a long sermon or two, but at least my listeners didn’t die from them!)\n\n10. Finally, we come to the most important resurrection of all: Jesus Christ. You could call all the other events “revivifications.”\n\nOnly Christ’s resurrection was permanent. The people who were raised were only temporarily alive. Eventually they would die again, and would have to await the final resurrection to come. But Christ being raised will never die again. He is bodily alive right now, seated at his Father’s right hand.\n\nOnly Christ’s resurrection was prophesied. As we say in the Nicene Creed, “On the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures.” Christ told his disciples, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day” (Matthew 20:19, also 16:21, 17:23).\n\nOnly Christ’s resurrection saves us. First, his crucifixion provides for our forgiveness by canceling our debt of sin. Colossians 2:13-14 says, “And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.” Then, with our sins forgiven, we are made alive in Christ. Because Christ was raised, we too who believe in him will be raised to eternal life. His resurrection is not only a wonderful historical event; it is the seal of God’s approval that Christ did indeed cancel our sins and win life for us. Because he was raised, we too will be raised. Romans 6:4-6 tells us, “We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.”\n\nChrist is risen! He is risen, indeed!\n\nThe question is not whether Christ rose from the dead; his resurrection is one of the most attested events from ancient times, affirmed by multiple witnesses and physical evidence. Rather, the question is: how do we live, knowing that Christ, indeed, was resurrected?\n\nFirst, we live in the strength of faith. Our faith is not anchored on a mere philosophy or fable, but in historical fact. As the Apostle Peter testified, “For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty” (2 Peter 1:16). Our faith gives us strength because it is more than just intellectual knowledge – it has the power to save. Romans 10 :9 promises, “because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”\n\nSecond, we live in the confidence of hope. Because Christ rose, we know that our life does not end at death, but instead will continue for all eternity. Therefore, no matter what affects us in this life, no matter how this life ends, we know with confidence that, like Christ, we too will be raised. Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live. And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die ” (John 11:25-26). And according to the Apostle Paul, “And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied. But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead” (1 Corinthians 15:17-21).\n\nThird, we live in the power of love. We love, because he first loved us. The Apostle John wrote in 1 John 4:10-11, “In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.” As Martin Luther once wrote, God does not need our works of love, but our neighbor does. Because Christ rose, we know that all his commandments and all his promises are true. This knowledge empowers us to act sacrificially for the benefit of others, caring, serving, and proclaiming to them the good news of forgiveness and resurrection to eternal life. Rather than timidly hiding our faith, we should be bold in telling others the good news, the greatest news, that anyone can hear: that Christ is risen, and will raise us as well!\n\nThere is a Gospel song written by Bill and Gloria Gaither that sums up the faith, hope, and love we can have in knowing that Christ rose from the dead that first Easter. It’s titled, “Because He lives, I Can Face Tomorrow.”*\n\nGod sent His son, they called Him, Jesus;\n\nHe came to love, heal and forgive;\n\nHe lived and died to buy my pardon,\n\nAn empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives!\n\nBecause He lives, I can face tomorrow,\n\nBecause He lives, all fear is gone,\n\nBecause I know He holds the future,\n\nAnd life is worth the living,\n\nJust because He lives!\n\nChrist is risen! He is risen, indeed!\n\nNow may the Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you, the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.\n\nRead: John 11; 1 Corinthians 15\n\n*Written by: Gloria Gaither, William J. Gaither.

We were all enjoying the movie until it came to a dramatic scene. Just as we became engrossed in the suspense, our (former) friend blurted out, “Oh, I hate this scene! The bad guy wins!” We almost did to him what the bad guy did on the screen.\n\nWell, today, I am going to follow in his footsteps. I am going to spoil the ending to what appears to be a tragic story. For today is Good Friday, the commemoration of a horrible event. On this day, the holy and sinless Son of the living God was arrested, tried, flogged, and crucified. Before the sun set, his lifeless body was sealed in a tomb and guarded by soldiers to make sure no one stole his corpse.\n\nHis followers scattered, fearing they would be next. One of his twelve closest disciples had betrayed him, another denied him three times. The betrayer hanged himself, and the rest hid out of fear. Their hopes and dreams seemed to be over; the man they had followed as the long-promised Messiah was dead. Like other pretenders before him, Jesus and his kingdom were dead and buried.\n\n“Good riddance!” said the religious leaders, who could brook no rival to their religious monopoly. “Good riddance!” said the Roman occupiers, who could brook no rival to Caesar. “Good riddance!” said the spiritual powers in dark places, who thought their enemy was defeated, leaving them free to tempt, torment, and destroy the creatures which God made in his image. Jesus was dead and gone, a joy for evil, but a devastation for those who hoped in the Lord.\n\nSo, that was that. End of story, right? Well, SPOILER ALERT! It’s not over! There’s more to the story. That well-guarded tomb, filled with the dead body of Jesus of Nazareth, would soon be empty, and the Occupant would be seen alive! He would appear to his followers, men and women, eat with them, and invite them to touch his healed wounds. He would teach them from the Scriptures about himself, and would ascend bodily into heaven. And because of that, his timid followers would boldly take the good news into the world, even at the cost of almost all of them being martyred for their faith and proclamation.\n\nYes, this has been a spoiler alert – but not as you might think. The real spoiling has been to those who thought they could destroy the Son of God and his mission to save us from our sins. For by killing him, they enabled his redemptive work to be done, and brought about their own defeat. Death could not hold him. Instead, Hebrews 2:14 tells us, “that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil.”\n\nAs Tony Campolo, a Christian writer and speaker put it: “It’s Friday, but Sunday’s comin’.”* That’s one spoiler I don’t mind hearing!\n\nNow may the Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you, the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.\n\nRead: Mark 15.\n\n*Campolo, Tony. It’s Friday, but Sunday’s Comin’. Contemporary Classics. 2002.\n\nP.S. Watch for a new blog on Sunday!\n\nWhat Would Saint Patrick Do?\n\nA number of years ago (just like this year), St. Patrick’s Day fell on a Sunday. As I was scheduled to preach that Sunday, I told my Senior Pastor, Pastor Deuel, that I planned to preach about Saint Patrick. He asked why, saying “We’re not Roman Catholic.” To which I replied, “Neither was Patrick!” So, even though he shook his head, I did in fact preach a first-person sermon, a monologue, that Sunday about the patron saint of Ireland.\n\nOf course, the sermon was actually about the Gospel; Saint Patrick was only the vehicle for presenting the Gospel, which his own words and writings show he would have completely endorsed. To know why Patrick’s life was all about the Gospel, it would be helpful to remember some of the details about his life and why he came to be called a saint.\n\nFirst, we recognize that Patrick was neither Roman Catholic nor even Irish. Patrick was born a Romanized Briton named Patricius in the 5th Century AD. At age 16 he was captured by Irish raiders who took him to Ireland to work as a slave in a pig farm. While slaving for six years, he became more devout in his Christian faith. Then one night he dreamed that a ship was ready to take him home, so he escaped and found the boat and sailed back to England. He then studied and was ordained as a missionary. Again he had a dream, in which a man handed him a letter called, “The Voice of the Irish.” Patrick later wrote that he seemed to hear a certain company of Irish beseeching him to walk once more among them. “Deeply moved,” he says, “I could read no more.” Therefore, he returned to the land and people of his slavery and brought them the freedom of Jesus Christ. He became their bishop and spent the rest of his life preaching, teaching, and baptizing them, though often opposed and threatened by kings and their pagan priests.\n\nAs I said, we celebrate not the person named Patrick, but rather the Gospel which he took to the Irish people. So how does knowing Patrick’s life help us to know and spread the gospel, too? We could ask, “What would Patrick do?” Consider the following:\n\nThough enslaved and treated harshly, he did not surrender to despair, but used his experiences among the Irish to serve the Lord. Indeed, it was his enslavement which created in him the heart to evangelize his former oppressors.There are two passages in the Bible which encourage us not to be defeated by adversities, but to see in those conditions the benevolent hand of God.\n\nNear the end of Genesis, we read of Joseph’s rise from slave to second in command of Egypt after prophesying to Pharaoh of a coming famine. In his elevated position, Joseph was able to stockpile enough food for many people to survive the famine. Later, Joseph confronted his brothers who had sold him into slavery. Though they feared retribution for their actions, he told them, “As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today” (Genesis 50:20).\n\nIn Romans 8:28, Paul teaches the same principle, “And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.” Rather than cursing the misfortunes that befall us, we should pray to discern how God may use the situation to bless us or others.\n\nHe held no hatred toward his captors, but rather forgave and sought to bless them with the Gospel. Jesus told us not to hate our enemies, but to forgive and love them. In Matthew 5:43-44, Jesus said, “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you. . .” Patrick had every right to hate the Irish and avoid going back to save them, but he gave up that right out of love and obedience to Christ. Likewise, we will meet people we just cannot stand, who have wronged us by word or action. Yet Christ calls on us to forgive them and seek to do them good, rather than evil. Do as Jesus commanded: “But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. To one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also, and from one who takes away your cloak do not withhold your tunic either.” (Luke 6:27-29).\n\nPatrick persevered, though he doubted his ability. In his writings, Patrick confessed that even as he returned to Ireland after escaping, he had serious doubts about his abilities to preach and evangelize the Irish people. He felt inadequate to the task at hand, but he went ahead, and as a result he planted churches and converted many to the glory of God. This is a great example to all of us, most of whom also feel inadequate to the task of proclaiming the Gospel to those around us. Those who haven’t gone to seminary may be afraid they don’t know enough; those of us who went may feel overwhelmed by the immensity of the task. Soon after I began my internship, I was called to the home of a man who had died. When I arrived, his widow called the grandkids into the room and told them that Pastor Eddy would tell them about what happened to their grandpa. At first I panicked inside, feeling inadequate to the task, until I heard a voice inside saying, “What do you think I have called you to do?” With that rebuke in mind, I sat down with "
