Already Houston’s all-time career home run and RBI leader after his junior season, he passed Brandon Caraway (82, 1997-00) for the all-time career extra-base hit record with a double in the series finale against Northwestern State on Feb. 17. With a home run at DBU on March 17, Davis passed Brandon Caraway (435, 1997-00) for the career total bases mark.\n\nOn May 16 at UCF, Davis, who was named Midseason Perfect Game/Rawlings All-America Second Team, recorded his 52nd career double to pass David Villar (51, USF, 2016-18) for The American Athletic Conference career record. Davis closed his career with 53 home runs, 107 extra-base hits, 223 RBI and 503 total bases.\n\nAt the conclusion of the regular, Davis was named to The American Second Team and later to the ABCA/Rawlings NCAA Division I Central All-Region Second Team.\n\nIn the 2019 MLB First-Year Player Draft, junior third baseman Jared Triolo was selected 72nd overall by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the Competitive Balance Round B, while Davis was taken by the Boston Red Sox in the 19th Round (Pick 587).\n\nPromoted to Assistant Coach on July 28, 2017, he helped Houston to an American Athletic Conference regular-season title and an NCAA Chapel Hill Regional berth in his first full season as an assistant coach with the Cougars\n\nHe helped coached the Cougars to a 38-25 overall record and a 16-8 mark in league play.\n\nUnder his direction, Houston hit .266 on the year with 37 home runs, 101 doubles and 11 triples.\n\nHouston slugger Joe Davis broke the Houston all-time home run record by hitting 13 home runs in 2018 to tally 35 total in his career. Davis was a Second Team All-Conference honoree and hit .318 and drove in a league-leading 62 RBI.\n\nThird baseman Jared Triolo remained a consistent threat in the offensive lineup for Houston, starting all 63 games at third base and finishing with a .344 average and 85 hits. Triolo reached base in all but three games during the 2018 season.\n\nThe Cougars ranked second in the league and notched a .976 fielding percentage for second-best all-time in program history.\n\nFour Cougars earned All-Conference honors (Trey Cumbie, Aaron Fletcher, Lael Lockhart Jr., Joe Davis) and three were selected in the MLB First Year Player Draft (Cumbie, Fletcher, Joey Pulido).\n\n2012-17\n\nShotzberger spent four seasons as the program's Director of Player Development and the two years prior to that as the volunteer assistant coach. He helped Houston to four American Athletic Conference Championship titles, three 40-win seasons, a Super Regional appearance and two NCAA Regional host bids.\n\nAT TCU\n\nPrior to Houston, Shotzberger spent five years on staff at TCU with Whitting.\n\nShotzberger has been a part of several successful programs during his time with Houston and TCU. In total, has helped those programs to seven 40+ win seasons, 11 Conference Championships, seven NCAA Regionals, three NCAA Super Regionals and one College World Series berth.\n\nWhile with the Horned Frogs, he coached the catchers, assisted with the hitters, threw batting practice, manned the bullpen during games and filled in as the first base coach. Also during his time at TCU, Shotzberger tutored three All-Conference catchers in Andrew Walker, Josh Elander and Bryan Holaday, the 2010 Johnny Bench Award recipient.\n\nAT DUKE\n\nShotzberger spent the 2006 season on the Duke staff. While in Durham, he was responsible for coaching the infielders, hitters, base runner and catchers.\n\nPLAYING DAYS\n\nA native of Wilmington, Del., Shotzberger attended McDaniel College in Westminster, Md.
