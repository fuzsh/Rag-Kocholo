Freshman right-handed pitcher/infielder Casey Schmitt was named Mountain West Championships Most Valuable Player, while Dean Nevarez, Garrett Hill, and Jacob Erickson were named to the All-Tournament team.\n\nAfter SDSU opened its scoring with a Dean Nevarez two-run homer -- his eighth of the season -- SDSU put up two impressive offensive innings to take control of the game, batting through the entire order in both the fourth and sixth to score four runs and five runs, respectively.\n\nIn the fourth, the Aztecs loaded the bases for Casey Schmitt, who delivered a double off the left-field wall to plate both Chad Bible and Julian Escobedo. After a UNLV pitching change, Matt Rudick reached and advanced to second on an error by third baseman Dillon Johnson, scoring both Nevarez and Schmitt.\n\nSDSU was able to capitalize on another costly mistake by the Rebels in the bottom of the sixth. With one out and Schmitt and Jacob Maekawa both on base, Rudick singled to center field where centerfielder Kyle Isbel misplayed the ball, allowing Schmitt and Maekawa to score on the mishap. Rudick ended up at third base on the play and later scored on a David Hensley single, before Chase Calabuig and Jordan Verdon each recording RBI base-hits to finish the outburst.\n\nThe Rebels put together one big inning on the night, scoring four times in the top half of the fourth. With two on and no outs, Nick Rodriguez doubled to right, scoring Johnson. Nick Ames added a run on a sacrifice fly and Jack-Thomas Wold doubled in a pair with two outs. UNLV added one run in the sixth when Wold grounded into a fielder's choice to second base, scoring Max Smith.\n\nJacob Erickson was lights out for SDSU out of the bullpen, throwing 3.2 innings of scoreless relief and striking out two while only giving up one hit. Erickson earned his second victory of the Mountain West Championships with his effort.\n\nHensley and Nevarez each went 3-for-5 with two RBIs while Schmitt led the team with three runs driven in.\n\nNOTES\n\nTitle Town\n\n- The San Diego State Baseball program wins its fifth Mountain West championship in the last six seasons (2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018).
