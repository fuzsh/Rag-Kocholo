        "text": "Although the UNLV baseball team has won 15 of its past 20 games, it still may be a stretch to say that the Rebels are peaking at the right time.\n\nAt the least, the Rebels will head into their final three-game series next week and the Mountain West Conference tournament the week after with plenty of confidence.\n\nUNLV on Sunday completed a five-game series sweep of the Air Force Academy with a 21-12 victory at Wilson Stadium and, believe it or not, may be the hottest team in the conference -- its 21-30 overall record notwithstanding.\n\n\"I think we're playing with a lot more confidence,\" UNLV head coach Rod Soesbe said. \"We didn't do a good job of coming out and playing all those tough (teams) early in the season.\n\n\"We played well at times, we didn't play well at times and then we kind of lost confidence in ourselves. We really didn't step into conference play with a feeling that we can go out and win.\"\n\nAfter a miserable 7-25 start -- which included losses to national powers such as UCLA and Cal State Fullerton -- and an 0-10 start in the conference, the Rebels managed to stop the bleeding but not the underlying injury.\n\n\"We have started to swing the bat a little bit better and the pitching has been consistent, but we're still struggling at times defensively -- and that's what has hurt us,\" Soesbe said.\n\nSunday's game was a perfect example. UNLV racked up 21 runs on 13 hits -- including four home runs -- but the defense committed three errors that led to seven runs.\n\n\"We just have to play defense behind our pitchers because we don't have guys that punch everybody out,\" Soesbe said.\n\nJunior outfielder Adam Manley continued his torrid hitting against the Falcons Sunday, belting a solo home run in the Rebels' 13-run third inning. In the five-game series, which included two makeup games from the Rebels' trip to Colorado Springs earlier this month, Manley was 13-for-20 (.650) with four home runs and eight RBIs.\n\nHarold Betts contributed to the Rebels' offensive barrage in the third inning with a grand slam and Nate Kaup belted a three-run homer as UNLV sent 16 batters to the plate.\n\nUNLV starter Luke Anderson held the Falcons to three unearned runs on two hits through three innings, but struggled with his control after the lengthy bottom of the third inning. He was removed in the fourth after surrendering five runs on five hits.\n\nAfter closing the regular season with three games next weekend at San Diego State, the Rebels will host the inaugural Mountain West Conference tournament May 17-20 at Wilson Stadium.\n\nSoesbe said he believes the Rebels won't necessarily be a walkover in the double-elimination tournament.\n\n\"I think anybody can win that tournament,\" Soesbe said. \"It's a funny league because everybody has beaten up on everybody else. (Conference leader) New Mexico played well early and has played the most consistent and I think that is what has kept them in it.\n\n\"We had a letdown at New Mexico (losing three games in April) because we just didn't match up with them too well ... but we're a little more offensive now, so we'll see what happens. We'll go into that tournament and take our chances.\"\n\narchive"
