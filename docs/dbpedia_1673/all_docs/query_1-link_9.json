The tandem of Sam Sippel and Jip van Assendelft is currently ranked No. 47.\n\nBRONCOS IN SINGLES: The 2024 spring roster consists of 11 student-athletes; two have recorded 20 singles victories, five others have 15 or more, and three have 10-plus.

He has faced 12 nationally ranked opponents and has gone 3-9 in those contests.\n\nJip van Assendelft typically plays at No. 2 singles, where he is 8-12 with a 16-14 overall record.\n\nJames Van Herzeele, who plays primarily at the No. 3 and 4 positions, has a 21-10 record overall in singles and a 15-5 record in team duals.\n\nJett Middleton is 18-12 overall in singles and 10-7 in team duals, playing primarily at the four and five positions.

He was named the Mountain West Coach of the Year in 2023 — the third of his career and the first with the Broncos — after leading the team to a 21-8 overall record, the MW tournament championship, and the first round of the NCAA tournament. He is currently 38-18 at Boise State and 131-81 in his career as a collegiate head coach."
