        "text": "The end of May signals the end of the Mountain West Conference sports season. Although the baseball and softball MW champions may still be playing in the NCAA tournaments, the Mountain West has crowned champions for all of its sports at this point in the year. Before fall sports start back up with official practices in August, now is as good a time as any to review each sport by listing the regular season and conference champions.\n\nLast year, San Diego State was crowned our 2023 all-sports champion for the Mountain West. This year, every sport was able to have a champion, and some sports featured repeat winners or remarkable runs in their respective sport. More on that below.\n\nThe scoring isn’t a perfect science, and keep in mind it’s all for fun. Don’t get bent out of shape if the team you don’t like scores higher than the team you do like. But if you have an idea for different scoring, feel free to share. We are a blog site doing blog site things, and that involves making up a weighted point system to crown a hypothetical all-sport champion. If it’s not your thing, it’s cool if you move on to the next post.\n\n(All champions are based on listed info from Mountain West official site)\n\nScoring\n\nNot trying to offend any sports, but some should carry more weight than others. The Mountain West sponsors 19 sports. Each sport will be split into three tiers. Football, men’s and women’s basketball, baseball, and softball will all be worth 3 points. The second level will consist of volleyball, and women’s soccer, accounting for two points. The rest will all be worth one point. For sports that have regular season and conference tourney champs, each will get full points and each will count as a separate championship. Same with ties.\n\nChampions\n\nMen’s Cross Country:\n\nNew Mexico (tournament) 1\n\nWomen’s Cross Country:\n\nColorado State (tournament) 1\n\nWomen’s Soccer:\n\nSan Diego State (regular season) 2\n\nUtah State (tournament) 2\n\nWomen’s Volleyball:\n\nUtah State (regular season) 2\n\nFresno State (tournament) 2\n\nFootball:\n\nBoise State (conference championship game) 3\n\nWomen’s Swimming and Diving:\n\nSan Diego State (tournament) 1\n\nMen’s Indoor Track and Field:\n\nColorado State (tournament) 1\n\nWomen’s Indoor Track and Field:\n\nColorado State (tournament) 1\n\nWomen’s Basketball:\n\nUNLV (regular season) 3\n\nUNLV (tournament) 3\n\nMen’s Basketball:\n\nUtah State (regular season) 3\n\nNew Mexico (tournament) 3\n\nWomen’s Gymnastics:\n\nBoise State (tournament) 1\n\nWomen’s Golf:\n\nSan Jose State (tournament) 1\n\nMen’s Golf:\n\nSan Diego State (tournament) 1\n\nMen’s Tennis:\n\nBoise State/Utah State (regular season) 1\n\nBoise State (tournament) 1\n\nWomen’s Tennis:\n\nNew Mexico (regular season) 1\n\nSan Diego State (tournament) 1\n\nMen’s Outdoor Track and Field:\n\nAir Force (tournament) 1\n\nWomen’s Outdoor Track and Field:\n\nColorado State (tournament) 1\n\nSoftball:\n\nSan Diego State (regular season) 3\n\nSan Diego State (tournament) 3\n\nBaseball:\n\nAir Force (regular season) 3\n\nFresno State (tournament) 3\n\nTotals:\n\n(number of championships in parentheses)\n\nSan Diego State: 11 (6)\n\nUtah State: 8 (4)\n\nBoise State: 6 (4)\n\nUNLV: 6 (2)\n\nNew Mexico: 5 (3)\n\nFresno State: 5 (2)\n\nColorado State: 4 (4)\n\nAir Force: 4 (2)\n\nSan Jose State: 1 (1)\n\nHawaii: 0 (0)\n\nNevada: 0 (0)\n\nWyoming: 0 (0)\n\nNotes\n\nThree teams did not have a championship in any sport this season. Although it’s the hardest for Hawaii, as they are only eligible for one sport.\n\nThe repeating champs would be Swimming & Diving (SDSU), Women’s Indoor Track and Field (Colorado State), Women’s Basketball (UNLV), Men’s Golf (SDSU), and Men’s (Air Force) and Women’s (Colorado State) Outdoor T&F,\n\nIt was a tighter race this, with over half the conference winning multiple championships and five teams taking home at least three. Although Utah State gave them a run for their money, it was once again San Diego State who led the way for the Mountain West. The Aztecs took home the most championships and the most points in this scoring. Winning the softball regular season and conference tournament gave them over half of their points, but they also won championships in women’s soccer, women’s swimming and diving, men’s golf, and women’s tennis.\n\nCongrats to the Aztecs, who are the 2024 all-sport champions!"
