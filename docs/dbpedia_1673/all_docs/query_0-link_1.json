        "text": "By STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nThe ability to keep the offensive line moving is one reason Fremont (Ind.) High School finds itself ready to compete for the third IHSAA regional baseball title in school history. The others came in 1998 and 1999.\n\n“We like to move and put pressure on the other team,” says Ian Burkhart, a 2011 Fremont graduate who first coached at his alma mater at the end of the 2015 season is in his second season as Eagles head coach in 2024. He is taking his 14-14 squad into one-game Class 1A regional against North Miami (8-16) at 3 p.m. today (June 1) at Bill Nixon Field in Plymouth. “We’ll put guys in motion, bunt-and-run and hit-and-run. It’s very cool that — 1 through 9 — we can bunt at any time. (Our players) embrace it and they run with it.”\n\nThe Eagles also keep moving via running for stolen bases.\n\n“We give them all the green light until they show us that they can’t,” says Burkhart.\n\nLed by senior Brody Foulk (15), junior Cayden Hufnagle (12) and senior Corbin Beeman (11), the team has pilfered 62 bags.\n\nAmong regulars, Fremont’s top hitters are No. 2 hitter/center fielder Foulk (.424), No. 5 hitter/catcher Tyler Miller (.368), No. 4 hitter/pitcher/third baseman Hufnagle (.366) and junior No. 3 hitter/shortstop Colten Guthrie (.357).\n\nLeading the Eagles on the mound are right-hander Hufnagle (6-4, 1.81 earned run average, 50 1/3 innings), right-hander Beeman (1-1, 2.59, 21 2/3 IP), junior left-hander Jackson Foster (5.47, 15 1/3 IP and right-hander Guthrie (0-3, 4.64, 22 2/3 IP).\n\nWhat does Burkhart ask of his pitchers?\n\n“You’ve got to throw strikes, pound the zone as much we and and force weak contact,” says Burkhart. “We pride ourselves on defensively making the automatics. We don’t need to make all the outstanding plays. We need to make as many of those 90-percents as we can.”\n\nTo get to regional and earn that fire engine ride around town, Fremont hosted and won a sectional title, beating Elkhart Christian Academy 12-2 and Fort Wayne Canterbury 10-0. Others in the seven-team field were Bethany Christian, Fort Wayne Blackhawk Christian, Hamilton and Lakewood Park Christian.\n\nStarting with 1976, Fremont has now earned nine sectional championships. The last three came in 2018, 2019 and 2022.\n\nFremont (enrollment around 290) is a member of the Northeast Corner Conference (with Angola, Central Noble, Churubusco, Eastside, Fairfield, Garrett, Lakeland, Prairie Heights, West Noble and Westview).\n\nRob Hale, Travis Parnin and Dave Smith are varsity assistants at Fremont and Christian Bice (Class of 2021) leads the junior varsity.\n\nThe Eagles’ home diamond is Probst Park, named in honor of former head baseball coach/athletic director Roger Probst.\n\n“We take a lot of pride in the playing surface and how our infield plays,” says Burkhart. “We make it as smooth it can be.”\n\nRe-sodding is done every few years.\n\nThe facility has had lights for many years.\n\n“That’s a fortunate thing for us,” says Burkhart. “We are able to play games all times of day.\n\n“We have an athletic director (Cal Stone) is willing to help us out with whatever we need. He’s told us that whatever we need to be successful, he’ll make it happen.”\n\nWhile there are no commits in the current group, tecent college players include Class of 2022’s Nick Miller at Indiana Tech and Gabel Pentecost at Taylor University.\n\nBurkhart dressed for sectional as a Fremont freshman in 2008. That was the last season as head coach for Probst. Justin Bock was head coach the next three seasons with power-hitting Burkhart on varsity full-time.\n\n“I enjoyed the way Justin coached the game,” says Burkhart, who got his ideas about motion while playing for and coaching under Bock. “He was very much about getting guys moving and getting the defense to adjust and adapt to us.”\n\nAfter high school, Burkhart played four years (2012-15) at Defiance (Ohio) College. He was a catcher when he joined the then-Derek Woodley-coached Yellow Jackets and transitioned to first base as a junior. Woodley is now minor league defensive coach in the New York Yankees organization.\n\nDefiance is also where he met his future wife Stephanie. The couple lives in Fremont and this summer are in charge of the community’s youth baseball and softball programs (ages 4-14) with help of many adult voluteers.\n\nIan coaches the Fremont Eagles 14U team in the Coldwater, Mich.,-based Sandy Koufax League.\n\nAnd if there’s not enough excitement around Fremont, the softball team is also still in the postseason. The slugging Eagles are in the 1A Northern Semistate today (June 1) at Frankfort.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nIvy Tech Northeast (30-23) swept a National Junior College Athletic Association sub-regional series against Lakeland over the weekend.\n\nThe Great Lakes Region 12 tournament will be hosted by the highest seed.\n\nIn the second season of the program (2019), Ivy Tech went 33-14. For now, that is the school victory record.\n\nThe 2021 sub-regional win was also the 10th postseason championship of Titans boss Lance Hershberger’s college coaching career.\n\nHe had earned two NAIA independent sectionals (1996, 1998), one conference tournament title (2000), five consecutive NAIA regional crowns (1998-2002) and one NAIA super regional title (2001) at Indiana Tech prior to Saturday’s feat for Ivy Tech.\n\nHershberger’s 55 postseason victories is the most all-time among college baseball coaches in Indiana.\n\nIndiana University Southeast (43-14) has made it to championship game of NAIA River States Conference tournament.\n\nBy going 3-1 Thursday through Saturday, the Grenadiers earned the right to meet Point Park Monday (May 10) for the right to move on to the NAIA Opening Round.\n\nWith a RSC tournament loss to IU Southeast, Indiana University Kokomo (28-20) saw its 2021 season come to a close. Point Park put out Oakland City (17-27).\n\nThe top six seeds — Indiana Wesleyan (41-12), Taylor (36-19), Huntington (33-14), Saint Francis (34-21), Mount Vernon Nazarene (29-18) and Marian (25-28) — are still alive in the NAIA Crossroads League tournament at IWU in Marion, Ind.\n\nPlay began Friday and resumes Monday, May 10. The championship will be Tuesday, May 11 (Wednesday, May 12, if necessary).\n\nWith each win, Saint Francis adds to its single-season school record for victories.\n\nWith a 10-inning Saturday loss to Saint Francis, Bethel (15-39) concluded its season.\n\nIndiana Tech (31-25) went 1-2 in the NAIA Wolverine-Hoosier Athletic Conference tournament and now awaits the NAIA Opening Round pairings.\n\nIndiana University South Bend (24-23) went 1-1 in its first two games of the NAIA Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference tournament and was slated to play again Monday, May 10 in Joliet, Ill.\n\nNext up for NCAA Division II Indianapolis (21-19) and Southern Indiana (22-18) is the eight-team Great Lakes Valley Conference tournament, slated for Thursday-Sunday, May 13-16 at Lindenwood in St. Charles, Mo.\n\nThe first part of the two-tier NCAA Division IIII Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference tournament has been set.\n\nBest-of-3 series are slated for Friday-Saturday, May 14-15 with No. 10 seed Defiance (6-31) at No. 1 Transylvania (26-10), No. 9 Mount Saint Joseph (12-26) at No. 2 Franklin (23-12), No. 8 Bluffton (16-22) at No. 3 Rose-Hulman (23-12), No. 7 Manchester (19-20) at No. 4 Earlham (21-18) and No. 6 Hanover (20-18) at No. 5 Anderson (20-17).\n\nA five-team double-elimination tournament will follow May 20-23 at the best remaining seed after Round 1.\n\nFifth-year senior Danny Dopp is now the career hits leader at Earlham. His 194 — reached in Saturday’s doubleheader against Manchester — surpass the 192 of Nate Lynch, who played for the Quakers 2014-17.\n\nDePauw (15-21) saw its season wrap Saturday in non-conference D-III play against Washington University of St. Louis.\n\nNCAA Division I Indiana (23-10, 23-10) went 2-0 against Rutgers and 1-1 against Nebraska in Piscataway, N.J., and hold a 1/2-game lead on Michigan for the lead in the Big Ten Conference standings. IU is slated to play three at Michigan Friday-Sunday, May 14-16.\n\nEven with a 1-2 series against Florida State, Notre Dame (25-10, 22-10) is well ahead of Louisville (26-15, 16-10) for the lead in the Atlantic Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\nBy splitting a four-game series at Central Michigan, Ball State (30-14, 21-7) remains 1 game behind first-place CMU in the Mid-American Conference standings.\n\nIndiana State (24-12, 11-5) went 3-1 in a Missouri Valley Conference series at Missouri State. The Sycamores trail MVC front-runner Dallas Baptist by 2 games.\n\nWith a win in the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader at Youngstown State, Purdue Fort Wayne gave Mastodons head coach Doug Schreiber the 500th win of his collegiate coaching career.\n\nBecause of health concerns within the Northwestern program, the Northwestern at Purdue series was postponed.\n\nPurdue has worked an arrangement with Ohio State to add a Tuesday, May 11 game at Alexander Field.\n\nINDIANA COLLEGE BASEBALL\n\nRecords Through May 9\n\nNCAA Division I\n\nBall State 30-14 (21-7 MAC)\n\nNotre Dame 25-10 (22-10 ACC)\n\nIndiana State 24-12 (11-5 MVC)\n\nEvansville 23-23 (6-13 MVC)\n\nIndiana 23-10 (23-10 Big Ten)\n\nValparaiso 13-25 (8-12 MVC)\n\nPurdue 11-20 (11-20 Big Ten)\n\nButler 10-19 (4-9 Big East)\n\nPurdue Fort Wayne 10-28 (7-21 HL)\n\nNCAA Division II\n\nSouthern Indiana 22-18 (18-14 GLVC)\n\nIndianapolis 21-19 (19-13 GLVC)\n\nPurdue Northwest 11-21 (5-18 GLIAC)\n\nNCAA Division III\n\nFranklin 23-12 (23-12 HCAC)\n\nRose-Hulman 23-12 (23-12 HCAC)\n\nEarlham 21-18 (21-18 HCAC)\n\nAnderson 20-17 (20-17 HCAC)\n\nHanover 20-18 (20-18 HCAC)\n\nManchester 19-20 (19-20 HCAC)\n\nWabash 18-15 (9-6 NCAC)\n\nDePauw 15-21 (8-8 NCAC)\n\nTrine 6-26 (6-17 MIAA)\n\nNAIA\n\nIndiana University Southeast 43-14 (26-1 RSC)\n\nIndiana Wesleyan 41-12 (28-4 CL)\n\nTaylor 36-19 (24-12 CL)\n\nSaint Francis 34-21 (23-13 CL)\n\nHuntington 33-14 (23-13 CL)\n\nIndiana Tech 31-25 (16-6 WHAC)\n\nIndiana University-Kokomo 28-20 (16-10 RSC)\n\nMarian 25-28 (17-19 CL)\n\nIndiana University South Bend 24-23 (19-11 CCAC)\n\nOakland City 17-27 (10-17 RSC)\n\nBethel 15-39 (12-24 CL)\n\nGrace 12-31 (9-23 CL)\n\nCalumet of Saint Joseph 7-29 (7-20 CCAC)\n\nGoshen 3-34 (2-26 CL)\n\nJunior College\n\nIvy Tech Northeast 30-23\n\nVincennes 19-27 (7-19 MWAC)\n\nAncilla 6-29 (2-18 MCCAA)\n\nConferences\n\nNCAA Division I\n\nBig Ten\n\nAtlantic Coast (ACC)\n\nBig East\n\nHorizon (HL)\n\nMid-American (MAC)\n\nMissouri Valley (MVC)\n\nNCAA Division II\n\nGreat Lakes Valley (GLVC)\n\nGreat Lakes Intercollegiate (GLIAC)\n\nNCAA Division III\n\nHeartland Collegiate (HCAC)\n\nMichigan Intercollegiate (MIAA)\n\nNAIA\n\nCrossroads League (CL)\n\nChicagoland Collegiate (CCAC)\n\nWolverine Hoosier (WHAC)\n\nRiver States Conference (RSC)\n\nJunior College\n\nMid-West Athletic (MWAC)\n\nMichigan Community College (MCCAA)\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nIt was a title-taking kind of weekend for two of Indiana’s NAIA baseball programs.\n\nIndiana Wesleyan (39-12, 28-4) earned its first Crossroads League regular-season championship since 2018 while going 3-1 at Wildcat Field against Grace.\n\nWith a three-game sweep of Midway at Koetter Sports Complex, Indiana University Southeast (36-13, 23-1) won its third straight River States Conference regular-season title.\n\nThe longest current win streaks among the state’s 38 college baseball programs belong to IU Southeast (8), Ball State (5), Rose-Hulman (5), Saint Francis (5), Indiana (4) and Manchester (4).\n\nWith an 11-inning win in Game 2 Saturday, Saint Francis (32-16, 22-10) capped a four-game Crossroads League sweep at Taylor. Junior right-hander Michael Vochelli worked the last five shutout innings as the winning pitcher.\n\nIn NCAA Division I, Niko Kavadas took his home run bat on the road as Notre Dame (20-8, 18-8) went 2-1 in an Atlantic Coast Conference series at Boston College.\n\nThe senior lefty slugger and Penn High School graduate pounded homer Nos. 14 and 15 in helping the Irish come back to win 13-9 in Game 3. He is among the national leaders.\n\nBall State (25-11, 16-4) enjoyed a four-game home sweep against Mid-American Conference foe Northern Illinois that included John Baker becoming the Cardinals’ all-time strikeout leader.\n\nThe senior right-hander fanned eight Huskies to raise his career total to 359 — No. 1 among active NCAA D-I pitchers and passed Bryan Bullington on Ball State’s K list.\n\nBats did some loud talking and pitchers were stingy as Indiana (18-8, 18-8) took all three Big Ten contest against visiting Minnesota. The Hoosiers outscored the Golden Gophers 39-5.\n\nDrew Ashley (3) and Grant Richardson (2) led the way as IU collected nine hits in Game 1 to support winner Tommy Sommer (11 strikeouts in 6 2/3 innings).\n\nMorgan Colopy (3), Collin Hopkins (3) and Ashley (2 with a homer) led the way as Indiana rapped 10 hits in Game 2 and Braden Scott (who faced one batter in relief) notched the victory.\n\nColopy (3 with a homer), Hopkins (3), Cole Barr (3), Richardson (2 with a homer) and Paul Toetz (2) guided a 17-hit outburst in a 23-1 Game 3 rout and Gabe Bierman (11 K’s in six innings) picked up the win.\n\nButler (9-16, 4-7) went 2-1 in Big East Conference home series against Villanova.\n\nAfter 25 road games to the start the season, Valparaiso (8-21, 3-9) came home to Emery G. Bauer Field and won three of four Missouri Valley Conference games against Southern Illinois. Games 1 and 2 on the new turf came on walk-off wins.\n\nNCAA Division II Indianapolis (17-15, 15-9) outscored McKendree 26-4 to win the three last three games of a Great Lakes Valley Conference series at Greyhound Park. Junior lead-off man Trey Smith went 3-for-4 with a homer, four RBIs and three runs scored in the 13-2 finale.\n\nNCAA D-III Rose-Hulman (16-10, 16-10) swept two Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference doubleheaders — Friday against Bluffton and Sunday at Earlham.

High School where he was a standout in basketball and baseball. He went on to pitch for Purdue University when Doug Schreiber was the Boilermakers head baseball coach.\n\n“He’s probably one of the most influential people ever in my life,” says Blasko of Schreiber (who is now head coach at McCutcheon High School). “I heard as an immature high school kid about attitude and things like that. I didn’t understand what attitude meant until I went to Purdue and was around Coach Schreiber. He drilled attitude, attitude, attitude, attitude.\n\n“When I coach, I carry that piece from him. A good attitude can relate to every single thing you do — how you carry yourself, how your react to people, how you come to practice. It’s the attitude you bring to the table in sports and in life.”\n\nBlasko, who likes to use analogies in his coaching and teaching, sees attitude as the glue that keeps the pieces of the puzzle together.\n\n“If you keep that attitude sound, it takes care of everything else,” says Blasko.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 right-handed pitcher was selected in the 47th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft by the Tampa Bay Rays. The Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association North-South All-Star did not sign and three seasons at Purdue and was taken in the first round (36th overall as a “sandwich” pick) in the 2002 draft by the Chicago Cubs.\n\nMishawaka teammate Eric Good was drafted as a pitcher in 1998 and played in the Montreal Expos organization. Purdue mates David Gassner (Toronto Blue Jays) and Andy Helmer (Cleveland Indians) were also drafted as pitchers.\n\nBlasko wound up his professional career in the Baltimore Orioles organization in 2007.\n\nHe has had two stints as a varsity baseball assistant at Mishawaka, where he has been an assistant boys basketball coach for a decade.\n\n“I’ve always had a passion for playing sports,” says Blasko, 38. “(Coaching) allows me to still be young and be a competitor. This allows me to still connect to it.”\n\nBlasko is also a physical education and health teacher at MHS. Chadd and wife Samantha have two sons — Baylen (5) and Brooks (3).\n\nWhen he became a father, Blasko backed off his baseball coaching duties to spend more time with his wife and sons.\n\n“I sit back a lot of times and realize how valuable my times is with my boys,” says Blasko. “The time people put in with me, especially my dad and mom (Ed and Sandy Blasko). Those things are so important.\n\n“It’s nice to coach kids, but it’s very important to be there for your kids as a father. Before you know it, they’re going to be 7 years old, 10 years old then they’ll be a teenager and won’t want to talk to you because they know everything.”\n\nBlasko, who has a younger brother named Phil (who played basketball at Defiance College in Ohio and is now Mishawaka Parks & Recreation Department director), played baseball at Mishawaka for head coach Gregg Minegar and basketball for Jerome Calderone.\n\n“(Minegar) was more laid-back,” says Blasko. “He had a mellow way of reaching a kid.”\n\nCalderone was more demonstrative as is current Caveman head boys basketball coach Ron Heclinski.\n\n“I remember his tough love,” says Blasko of Calderone (who is now principal at MHS). “I thanked him when I was inducted into the Mishawaka Hall of Fame.\n\n“He was old school. He’s going to let out a bark. He’s not going to let you just go through the motions. He had passion. You have to have a passion for what you’re doing.”\n\nBlasko appreciates how Heclinski finds a way to get though to his young athletes and their many personalities.\n\n“I relate to him a lot,” says Blasko. “If you don’t relate to the kids, it’s hard to get to them. I’ve learned that from him.\n\n“Sometimes you have to give that tough love and get after a kid. You have to hold him accountable.\n\n“Some folks betray that as being too harsh. It’s about knowing that line and not crossing the line to disrespect. You’re showing them your passion. I’m trying to help you out.”\n\nBlasko has also learned from Heclinski that some players respond to the proverbial kick in the hindquarters while other wilt when you do that.\n\n“You should learn your players,” says Blasko. “You can’t just be a cookie-cut coach.\n\n“There’s a common goal there it’s finding a way of how to unlock the kid’s lock.”\n\nBlasko’s bottom line: If you’re in the classroom, on the court or on the field, if you can’t connect with that kid, it’s going to be very hard to teach them.\n\n“I don’t care if I’m trying to teach you to have self esteem and be nice to people or how to pitch,” says Blasko. “It’s going to be very hard for me to get in your brain and for you to trust me.\n\n“If you trust me, I’ve got you. They’ve got to know they can trust you and know what you’re about.”\n\nIn his early Performance Center sessions, Blasko has been showing young pitchers how to load up and use their whole body rather than just their arms.\n\nHe told them that if you’re going to throw a punch, you want to bring it back before you take it forward for maximum power and the same is true with pitching.\n\nOnce again, Blasko is not using a cookie-cut approach.\n\n“They’re all different,” says Blasko. “We have a main goal, but if something works for you, I’m not going to change it all that much. I’m not going to make everybody a robot . We’re not all going to look identical.”\n\nHe wants them all to have the same foundation and be able to balance during their motion.\n\n“You’re not stopping but you’re gathering yourself to make that powerful movement toward the plate,” says Blasko. “We want to be equal and opposite (creating a rhythmic and synchronized arm swing; extending the arms at the same tine, in the same motion, with the elbows matching up int he exact identical position and foot strike), stay on top of the ball and follow through.\n\n“You’ve got to have a base and build your way up to get to the power position.”\n\nChadd Blasko recently became a baseball instructor at the First Source Bank Performance Center in South Bend, Ind. He is a coach and teacher at Mishawaka (Ind.) High School. He played baseball at Purdue University and in the Chicago Cubs and Baltimore Orioles systems.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\n“I think there’s a 90 mph arm in every school in the country. I’m not sure there’s not one in every class.” — Tom Held, head baseball coach, Defiance (Ohio) High School\n\nIn the northwest corner of Ohio, they are developing hard throwers and a Buckeye (Held) and a native Hoosier (Kevin “Scoop” Miller) are playing a big part.\n\nSometimes known as the “Defiance Way,” a system of throwing progressions and long toss has added 17 members to the 90 mph club since 1999.\n\nAmong DHS products are big leaguers Jon Niese (now with the Mets) and Chad Billingsley (most recently with the Phillies). A four-county area (Defiance, Fulton, Henry, Williams) of small schools typically has eight to 12 pro pitchers active each year.\n\n“We throw a lot — more than most people throw,” Held, who has spoken at the Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association State Clinic and many other seminars and camps in his Ohio High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame career. “We don’t baby the arms. We throw three days a week all winter.”\n\nThat off-season program has players throw into a net with tennis balls, softballs and baseballs. They go two sets with each and throw as hard as they can for 72 pitches.\n\n“It seems to have a big impact,” Miller, who is entering his ninth season as pitching coach at Defiance College after a successful baseball and basketball coaching career at Archbold (Ohio) High School (leading the Blue Streaks to the Division 2 state baseball crown in 2005), said. “If guys will invest the time and effort and use the proper mechanics, the sky’s the limit.\n\n“It motivates the kids when they see their (velocity) numbers go up. We also teach them a great 12-6 curve ball, too. That’s the safest pitch you can throw if you do it correctly and it reduces injuries.”\n\nAthleticism has a lot to do with throwing hard, but proper technique and putting in the work is also key.\n\nMuch of the program does not involve getting on a mound.\n\n“You must learn how to throw before you learn how to pitch,” Held said. “Throwing is a science and pitching is an art.\n\nHeld, whose teams have won 670 games and three Ohio High School Athletic Association Division 2 state titles (2013, 2015 and 2016) in 29 seasons, said a player must spend 4-6 weeks throwing everyday to get their arm into great shape.\n\n“That does not mean you can pitch everyday,” Held said. “Kids don’t throw enough and they pitch too much.”\n\nHeld and Miller teach private lessons and run camps in the fall, Christmas break and on Sundays in January and February.\n\n“We don’t label it as a pitching camp, but a throwing camp,” Miller said.\n\nThe desire is to get players at the younger ages before they get a chance to develop bad habits.\n\nHeld said that throwing — when done properly — does not hurt the arm.\n\nA pitcher from 1983-86 in the Detroit Tigers system, Tom Held learned much of his baseball wisdom from father Mel “Country” Held, a veteran of 13 pro seasons with a “cup of coffee” for the 1956 Baltimore Orioles.\n\n“All they did back then was throw,” Tom Held said.\n\nThe younger Held said his Bulldogs — pitchers and position players — will do long toss after a throwing progression every single day once the team gets outdoors.\n\nMiller, a 1980 Jimtown High School and 1984 Goshen College graduate, stresses that conditioning is big for anyone wishing to be good at pitching or throwing.\n\n“We want them in the best shape possible,” Miller said. “We do proper warm-up (of at least 20 minutes) with dynamic and static stretching. We make sure all core muscles are warmed up before we ever pick up baseball.”\n\nThen were are towel drills and throwing progressions, isolating upper and lower body. There are specific drills to isolate every movement.\n\nLong toss is emphasized for Defiance College pitchers, who work their way up throwing the length of a football field (300 feet). These Yellow Jackets will long toss the day before and after they pitch.\n\nAnd their arms are stronger for it.\n\nTom Held (Defiance High School)\n\nScoop Miller (Defiance College)"
