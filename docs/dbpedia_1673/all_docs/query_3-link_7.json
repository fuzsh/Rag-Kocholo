        "text": "The Mountain West baseball tournament starts Thursday with the conference coming off arguably its worst regular season ever.\n\nZero of the MW's seven teams are in the top 100 of the RPI— San José State at No. 108 is the high-water mark— while the conference placed 16th out of 30 Division I conferences in RPI. That was down from 14th in 2022 and eighth in 2021, a troubling trend.\n\nNo matter what happens at this week's four-team conference tournament, which will be hosted by Fresno State and does not include Nevada, which failed to qualify for the first time, the MW will send just one representative to an NCAA Regional. That will mark the eighth straight NCAA Tournament with just one MW team in the field. That streak dates to 2015 when a 41-win Wolf Pack team that spent much of the season in the Top 25 was snubbed from the 64-team field.\n\nThe run of single-bid seasons that started in 2015 comes on the heels of MW baseball sending multiple teams to NCAA Regionals from 2009-14, a streak of six straight seasons. Since the conference formed in 1999, MW baseball has had three distinct periods, which include one-bid representation from 2001-08, multiple-team representation from 2009-14 and back to one-bidrepresentation from 2015-current. Here's a breakdown of those periods.\n\n2001-08: Eight seasons, eight teams in Regionals (one bid every year), 9-16 record at the tournament (zero Super Regional berths)\n\n2009-14: Six seasons, 13 teams in Regionals (multiple bids every year), 23-28 record at the tournament(three Super Regional berths, all TCU)\n\n2015-22: Seven seasons (discounting COVID year), seven teams in Regionals (one bid every year), 7-14 record at the tournament(zero Super Regional berths)\n\nSo, what has happened to MW baseball to put it in its current predicament? We'll go over a couple of issues, but the main culprit was TCU leaving the conference in 2012. TCU is one of the nation's top baseball program, so elite it was able to poach a MW head coach (Nevada's TJ Bruce) to be its top assistant last offseason. TCU has made an NCAA Regional every year since2004 with the exception of2013 and 2018.\n\nThe Horned Frogs were in the MW from 2006-12 and won seven regular-season titles in those seven seasons, making an NCAA Regional each year, a Super Regional three times and the 2010 College World Series when it reached the national semifinals. TCU won at least 39 games in all seven of its seasons in the MW and lifted the entire conference from a baseball perspective. Since it left the MW, no team has stepped up to the plate to replace TCU as a national brand.\n\nSan Diego State had a strong program near the end of Tony Gwynn's tenure as head coach and spilling intoMark Martinez's first few years but has fallen off in recent years.\n\nUNLV showed its potential in the early 2000s but has made just one Regional appearance since 2006 with only five 30-wins seasons since then. With the talent in Las Vegas, that program should more consistently reach Regionals.\n\nNevada qualified for four NCAA Regionals in seven seasons from 1994-2000 but hasn't been the same since moving out of the Big West (if only it could have kept coach Jay Johnson long term).\n\nAnd New Mexico had a great run from 2011-16, making four NCAA Regionals over a six-year period but is 150-175-3 since 2016 and hasn't even made the four-team MW Tournament since 2017.\n\nEach of those programs have higher ceilings than they've shown in recent years, which has resulted in the MW's string of one-bid NCAA Regional berths. No MW team even hit 30 wins this regular season with 40 victories typically being the standard of a NCAA Regional-caliber team. TCU isn't coming back to the MW anytime soon, so getting the MW back to a two-bid league would require internal growth from teams like SDSU, UNLV, Nevada and New Mexico.\n\nGeographically speaking, the MW isn't well suited to be great in baseball given the harsh winters at many of the conference's campuses. Colorado State, Wyoming, Utah State and Boise State don't even sponsor baseball. The only other MW men's sport with four of its members not sponsoring said sport is men's tennis. Clearly, MW schools haven't put much emphasis on baseball, with Boise State briefly sponsoring it in 2020 before shuttering the program after 14 games.\n\nThe MW has shown it can be a good baseball league before, but it is a long way from that right not, and a lot must change to get back to that level.\n\nSports columnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
