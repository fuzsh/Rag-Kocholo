        "text": "Sunday, January 31, 2010\n\n1. Some teams just like playing with their backs to the wall. For Notre Dame that might just be what the doctor ordered on Saturday night at the Joyce Center as the Irish hockey team scored three unanswered goals through the first period and held off the Nebraska-Omaha Mavericks late rally for a 3-2 win in front of a sold-out Joyce Center crowd of 2,857. After coming out flat on Friday night in a 5-3 loss to the Mavericks, Notre Dame came out buzzing early in the game, getting goals from Calle Ridderwall, Nick Larson and Sean Lorenz to build a 3-0 lead by the 8:25 mark of the second period. From there, they turned things over to freshman goaltender Mike Johnson who turned away 32 of 34 shots on the night, giving up third-period goals to Terry Broadhurst and Rich Purslow (extra attacker goal) for the 3-2 win. After dropping to a tie for seventh in the CCHA with Friday’s loss, the Irish jumped into a tie for fourth place with the victory on Saturday. The loss dropped Nebraska-Omaha from sixth to a tie for eighth as fourth place and ninth place in the conference are now separated by just two points. Notre Dame is now 12-11-7 for the year and 8-8-6-2 in the CCHA, good for 32 points to tie the Irish with Lake Superior State for fourth place. Just one point behind with 31 in sixth place is Michigan and Alaska while Nebraska-Omaha and Ohio State are tied for eighth with 30 points. The Lakers, Wolverines and Buckeyes all have two games in hand on the Irish, Nanooks and Mavericks. Nebraska-Omaha is 13-12-5 overall and 9-11-2-1 in conference play.\n\nNotre Dame’s win also was highlighted by the team’s first-ever “Give Them The Jersey Off Their Backs,” promotion as the Irish auctioned off special commemorative jerseys that were worn in both games of the Nebraska-Omaha series with the proceeds from the auction going to the Wounded Warriors Project. The online auction netted $16,604.60 for 28 jerseys. The Irish also had several benefactors who offered matching donations, including former Irish hockey standout and All-American Greg Meredith. Those contributions added $25,000 to the $41,604.60 total that will go to the Wounded Warrior Project that provides programs and services designed to ease the burdens of these heroes and their families, aid in the recovery process, and smooth the transition back to civilian life. Senior alternate captain, Kevin Deeth, who spearheaded the auction had the highest selling jersey as his was auctioned off for $1,575.00.\n\nThe Irish return to action Feb. 5-6 when they travel to Kalamazoo, Mich., for a pair of games against the Western Michigan Broncos. Game time both nights is 7:35 p.m. Notre Dame plays five of its last six games of the regular season on the road.\n\n2. The Notre Dame women’s lacrosse team opened its exhibition season on Saturday afternoon at rain-soaked Disney World of Sports versus the U.S. National Elite Team at the Champion Challenge, a US Lacrosse event. The Irish fell behind 12-1 in the first 20 minutes of the game and trailed 14-3 at halftime on the way to a 23-7 loss. Notre Dame was led offensively by Shaylyn Blaney, Gina Scioscia and Ansley Stewart with two goals each — while freshman Betsy Mastropieri added a single goal. Maggie Tamasitis had one assist in the game.\n\nFormer Irish standout Jillian Byers ’09 (3g, 3a) led Team USA in the victory. After trailing 14-3 to start the second half, the Irish rallied early in the second half, scoring four of the first five goals to cut the lead to 15-7. Freshman goalkeeper Ellie Hilling made 10 saves in goal for Notre Dame. The Irish returned to action today against the U.S. Developmental Team at Disney World of Sports.\n\n3. Sam Young and Eric Olsen both started on the offensive line and Kyle McCarthy made four tackles (two solo, two assists) off the bench to help their North team win the Senior Bowl college all-star game 31-13 yesterday in Mobile, Ala. Two Brian Kelly-coached quarterbacks helped the North win – Cincinnati’s Tony Pike (five of 12 passing for 45 yards) and Central Michigan’s Dan LeFevour (five of 10 for 97). LeFevour ran for one touchdown and threw 32 yards for another TD to Cincinnati’s Mardy Gilyard, another Kelly pupil. Gilyard was the game MVP with five catches for 103 yards.\n\n4. Mike Rosario scored 24 points and Hamady Ndiaye blocked two shots by Luke Harangody in the final minute as Rutgers ended a nine-game men’s basketball losing streak with a 74-73 victory over Notre Dame Saturday. James Beatty hit three free throws in the final 31.1 seconds as the Scarlet Knights (10-11, 1-8) became the last Big East team to win a game in the conference this season. Harangody had 19 points to lead Notre Dame (15-7, 4-5). Ben Hansbrough added 18, including two three-pointers in the final three seconds and Tim Abromaitis had 17 as the Irish lost for the fourth time in five games.\n\n5. Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw winced when Ashley Barlow launched from beyond the arc in the final minute and the third-ranked Irish trailed Syracuse by a basket. But Barlow, who had missed her previous four three-point attempts, was true from the right wing with 34.2 seconds left and Notre Dame escaped with a 74-73 victory Saturday at Syracuse. The Irish finished two of 12 in the period from beyond the arc against the fired-up Orange zone, which was victimized for eight threes in the first half. “That three was so big. We ran a play for her to get it and we executed well, screened well,” McGraw said. “Despite my screaming the entire half to stop shooting the three, she just kept her poise and made it.” Juanita Ward’s three-point play had given the Orange a 73-71 lead with a minute left, but Barlow got open on the wing and saved Notre Dame (19-1, 6-1 BIG EAST), which has beaten Syracuse (16-5, 3-5) 22 times in 23 meetings. “We just had to stay with it. We didn’t hold our heads down,” said Barlow, who tied her season high with 19 points. “We knew that we had to get a couple of rebounds at the end of the game. We knew we had to make a stop.” The Orange’s aggressive defense limited Notre Dame to 25 percent shooting (seven of 28) in the second half and they repeatedly drove the ball inside, outscoring the Irish 22-6 in the paint in the period (38-20 overall). “Defensively, we couldn’t guard the ball,” McGraw said. “They got to the line 37 times. We did a poor job of containing the ball. We did a poor job on the boards. We just really didn’t play our game, and yet despite all the foul trouble and ice-cold shooting in the second half, we managed to hold onto the win.” Syracuse also outrebounded Notre Dame 49-34, but was undone by 25 turnovers and 14 missed free throws. “We didn’t let them get us rattled,” said Irish freshman guard Skylar Diggins, who matched her season high with 21 points. “We knew what we had to do to get calmed down. Their defensive pressure really picked up. They really got after it, had a lot of energy in the second half. We held it together.” The Irish survived despite squandering a 16-point lead in the opening minutes of the game. Syracuse began the second half with a 21-5 spurt to erase a 14-point halftime deficit and make it a game as the Irish went cold, hitting just four of their first 18 shots of the period. Notre Dame won its 10th consecutive game in the series and improved to 23-2 all-time against Syracuse (11-1 on the road, 11-game road win streak). Notre Dame canned a season-high 10 three-pointers, the most for the Fighting Irish in a single game since March 3, 2002, when they also made 10 treys in an 84-79 loss to Syracuse in the BIG EAST Championship quarterfinals at Piscataway, N.J.\n\n6. Senior diver Natalie Stitt set a University and Rolfs Aquatic Center record Saturday off the three-meter board with a score of 376.20, leading the Notre Dame women’s swimming and diving team to a pair of dual meet wins to wrap up the Shamrock Invitational. Stitt, the defending BIG EAST champion in the one- and three-meter events, bettered Heather Mattingly’s school record (351.15) set on Jan. 26, 2001. Furthermore, she bumped ahead of the pool record (333.82) established by Meghan Perry-Eaton on Jan. 12, 2002. Stitt’s performance was flanked by four more wins by the Irish (2-5), who picked up dual meet victories over Denver (275-94) and Iowa (260-110). No. 21 Missouri dealt Notre Dame a 190-180 setback. Iowa defeated Denver, 225-143, while Missouri downed Iowa (269-101) and Denver (276-93). Notre Dame also received NCAA B-cut swims from Samantha Maxwell (100 breast) and Kim Holden (200 back). The additional Irish wins were posted by Megan Farrell (400 IM), Maxwell (100 breast), Holden (200 back) and the 400 free relay squad. Notre Dame now looks ahead to the 2010 BIG EAST Championships hosted by Pittsburgh. The defending champions take part in the league’s diving action Feb. 12-14, with the swimming portion held Feb. 17-20 at Trees Pool. Notre Dame seeks its 14th consecutive BIG EAST title to extend the league’s longest streak by any team any sport.\n\n7. The 30th-ranked Notre Dame men’s tennis team dropped a heartbreaking decision to #35 Tulsa, 4-3, Saturday in the first round of the ITA Indoor Kickoff weekend. Participating at the Ohio State regional in Columbus, Ohio, the Irish raced to an early 3-1 lead behind solid play at doubles as well as first and fifth singles. The Irish got on the board first in the match, tallying the doubles point for the third time in four matches this season. Victories at second and third doubles propelled the Irish to an early lead against Tulsa. After junior Tyler Davis (Nashville, Tenn./Father Ryan) and sophomore Casey Watt (Gibsonia, Pa./Pine-Richland) were defeated at first doubles, 8-4, junior Stephen Havens (Cincinnati, Ohio/Hill Christian School) and sophomore Niall Fitzgerald (Wicklow, Ireland/Blackrock College) knotted the doubles score by knocking off Alastair Barnes and Marko Ballok, 8-4. Junior David Anderson (Sandwich, Mass./Sandwich) and junior Dan Stahl (Bethesda, Md./Walt Whitman) clinched the point for the Irish at third singles with an 8-5 victory over Rusty Turpin and Grant Ive. Notre Dame increased its lead to 2-0 over the Golden Hurricane when freshman Blas Moros (Boca Raton, Fla./Pine Crest School) made short work of Tulsa’s Ive, 6-2, 6-0, at fifth singles. Moros, ranked 74th nationally, improved to 3-1 on the season. Watt gave Notre Dame a 3-1 lead by winning at first singles, defeating Philip Stephens. After dropping the first set to Stephens, 6-1, Watt rallied to win the second set, 6-3, before cruising to a 6-2 victory in the third set. With the outcome of the match hanging in the balance and players from both teams cheering on, Stahl and Barnes played a three-set thriller. Stahl won the first set 6-3 before the see-saw affair began in the second set. Barnes claimed the second set, 7-6 (7-5), forcing a decisive third set. With Barnes leading 5-4, he served for the match and closed out Stahl and the Irish, allowing Tulsa to advance to the regional championship. With the loss, the Irish moved to the consolation match against 51st-ranked New Mexico this morning. The Lobos were defeated by third-ranked Ohio State, 7-0, earlier Saturday.\n\n8. The Irish track and field squads wrapped up competition on a high note at the Indiana Invitational Sunday, earning 17 top-five finishes, including four first-place showings at the Harry Gladstein Fieldhouse in Bloomington. The Irish took the top spot in the men’s 4×800-meter relay, while Eric Quick narrowly missed qualifying for the NCAA Championships and won the men’s long jump. Notre Dame also garnered first-place accolades from Joanna Schultz in the women’s 400-meter invitational and Nevada Sorenson in the women’s 60-meter hurdles. The Irish return to the Loftus Sports Center next weekend when they host the Meyo Invitational Friday at Saturday.\n\n9. The sixth-ranked Irish women’s tennis team advanced to the final match of the ITA Kickoff Weekend with a 6-1 win over No. 46 DePaul Saturday at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. The Irish faced No. 17 North Carolina today with the winner advancing to the ITA National Indoor Championships in Madison, Wis., Feb. 12-15. Notre Dame took the early 1-0 lead after winning the doubles point. The 12th-ranked duo of Kristy Frilling and Kali Krisik knocked off No. 9 Anna Redesci and Selma Salkovic, 8-2, at No. 1 doubles, but Cosmina Ciobanu and Chrissie McGaffigan fell to Katarina Milinkovic and Gia McKnight, 8-3, at second doubles to even the match. Colleen Rielley and Shannon Mathews held off a rally by Sandra Zmak and Kirsten Gambrell to take the No. 3 doubles contest 8-5 and clinch the point for the Irish. No. 30 Frilling put the Irish up 2-0 with her 6-0, 6-2 win over Redesci at No. 1 singles. Notre Dame moved ahead 3-0 when DePaul’s Gambrell was forced to retire her match at No. 6 singles against Colleen Rielley. McGaffigan clinched the win for the Irish after topping Katarina Milinkovic, 6-4, 6-0, at third singles. Krisik downed Zmak, 6-2, 6-4, at No. 4 singles, and Ciobanu edged McKnight, 7-5, 6-4, to give Notre Dame a 6-0 lead. Salkovic defeated Mathews, 7-6, 7-5, at No. 2 singles to avoid the sweep. In earlier action, No. 17 North Carolina defeated No. 33 Boise State, 7-0. The Tar Heels won all three doubles matches, before sweeping the singles contests for the win.\n\n10. Christopher Johnson and Joseph Raycroft led the Notre Dame men’s swimming and diving team to a clean sweep of the breaststroke events Saturday to close the Shamrock Invitational at the Rolfs Aquatic Center. Johnson went 57.34 in the 100-yard version while Raycroft logged a 2:05.36 in the extended race, as Notre Dame (5-6) picked up a 245-124 win over visiting Denver in dual meet action. Iowa (197-171) and Missouri (197-173) each defeated the Irish on Senior Day. Iowa defeated Denver (236-125) and Missouri (184.5-183.5) to leave the invite with a trio of wins. Missouri defeated Denver, 235-134. The Hawkeyes’ 400 and 800 free relays recorded NCAA B-cuts. Notre Dame now looks ahead to the 2010 BIG EAST Championships hosted by Pittsburgh. The defending champions take part in the league’s diving action Feb. 12-14, with the swimming portion held Feb. 17-20 at Trees Pool.\n\n11. It was a successful first day in the Windy City Saturday for the Notre Dame men’s and women’s fencing teams, as both teams picked up sweeps during action at the Northwestern Duals in Evanston, Ill. The men improve to 18-0, while the women run their mark to 17-0. The Irish men’s team went 8-0 on the day, remaining undefeated on the season. The Irish scored wins over Detroit Mercy and Stanford in the morning session, before finishing the sweep with victories #10 Duke, #4 Princeton, Lawrence, Northwestern, arch-rival #3 Ohio State and UC San Diego. The tightest round of the day was with the third-ranked Buckeyes, but the Irish picked up a strong 8-1 mark at sabre to remain undefeated. The Irish men were led by perfect marks from junior foilist Zach Schirtz (Rochester, N.Y.), freshman foilist Grant Hodges (Salina, Kan.) and junior sabreist Avery Zuck (Beaverton, Ore.), while senior epeesit Kelly Hurley (San Antonio, Texas) went 16-0 to lead the women.\n\nThe Irish women’s team also completed a sweep of the day’s action. Notre Dame started off strong by scoring over 20 victories in wins over Fairleigh Dickinson, Stanford and UC San Diego. Things then got a little more interesting, when following a 17-10 win over Duke, Notre Dame needed overtime to beat Princeton, 15-12. The foil came up big in overtime, when after tying the weapon 12-12, Reese, Sarkisova and Malynn all scored overtime wins to capture the victory for the Irish. Notre Dame capped the day with wins over North Carolina and Johns Hopkins. Both teams are in the midst of record-setting regular-season win streaks. The men’s team has now won 62 straight matches, which is the fourth-longest streak in school history. They have a ways to go to continue moving up the list, but next in their sights is a 90-match streak from 2000-2004. The women’s streak improves to 41 straight victories, which is tied for the third-longest such run in program history. A victory in their first match on day two of the NU Duals will tie them for the second-longest streak (1986-88), while they continue to make a run at the longest streak, a 75-match run from 1993-1996.\n\n12. Official dedication ceremonies for Purcell Pavilion take place Thursday when the Irish men’s basketball team plays host to Cincinnati.\n\n13. Stay tuned on Wednesday for college football’s National Signing Day – as the Daily Dish will be embedded with the Irish football coaching staff and will bring you immediate reaction and confirmation as letters of intent arrive on the scene.

Notre Dame has been picked to finish second in the inaugural season of the BIG EAST Conference men’s lacrosse league. The conference’s head coaches casted the votes and were not permitted to vote for their own teams. Syracuse was tabbed to win the league with six first-place votes, while Notre Dame received one first-place nod. Rounding out the order of finish was Georgetown, Villanova, Rutgers, St. John’s and Providence. Men’s lacrosse is the 24th sport sponsored by the BIG EAST and is the 11th men’s sport. The seven teams will play a six-game single round-robin regular-season schedule.\n\nFour Notre Dame student-athletes were named to the 2010 All-BIG EAST Preseason Team. Senior Scott Rodgers was the lone goalie selected to the 15-man squad. Fellow seniors Sam Barnes (D), Neal Hicks (A) and Grant Krebs (M) also were chosen for the all-conference team.\n\nRodgers (Wantagh, N.Y.), a preseason first-team All-American according Inside Lacrosse, is coming off a campaign in which he ranked first among all NCAA Division I goalies in goals-against average (6.14) and save percentage (.663). He earned third-team All-America honors last season. Rodgers, a two-time team captain, was named the 2009 Great Western Lacrosse League (GWLL) Player of the Year. Barnes (Branford, Conn.) was an anchor on the Irish defense that led the nation with a program-record 6.19 goals-against average during the 2009 campaign. He started every contest and notched one assist and 28 ground balls en route to earning honorable mention All-America honors. Barnes has been tabbed as a preseason second-team All-American by Inside Lacrosse. Hicks (Atlanta, Ga.) had a breakout season in 2009 as he led Notre Dame with 43 points on 25 goals and 18 assists. All of those figures were career-best marks for the attackman. Hicks, a team captain, notched a point in every game last season and netted a goal in all but three contests. He received second-team all-GWLL honors in 2009. Krebs (Annapolis, Md.), a preseason second-team All-American according to Inside Lacrosse, deposited 29 goals and assisted on nine others last season. His 38 points were the most by an Irish midfielder and helped him earn a first-team all-GWLL citation. Krebs will carry team-best streaks for points (32) and goals (28) into the 2010 campaign.\n\nNotre Dame is ranked 10th in the Lacrosse Magazine preseason poll. The Fighting Irish open the 2010 campaign at Duke on Saturday, Feb. 20. Notre Dame went 15-1 last season and earned the #7 overall seed for the NCAA Championships.\n\n2. Look for Notre Dame Blue-Gold football tickets to go on sale Tuesday, March 16. Once again there will be a Saturday morning brunch with Irish football players, as well as sales of seats in the Notre Dame Stadium press box. Proceeds from the game benefit the Notre Dame Club of St. Joseph Valley and its scholarship fund. The Blue-Gold game is set for Saturday, April 24 – and that’ll be a busy weekend with the Irish baseball and softball teams playing at home, the BIG EAST tennis championships happening on campus, to go with the formal dedication of the new Irish soccer facility.\n\n3. As national signing day approaches, SI.com (the Sports Illustrated site) lists the top 15 recruiting classes of all-time – and number one on the list is Notre Dame’s class from 1946. That group over the next four years never lost a football game (1946-49) and included ’49 Heisman Trophy winner Leon Hart and classmates and first-team All-Americans Emil Sitko at running back and Jim Martin at tackle.\n\n4. Notre Dame women’s lacrosse coach Tracy Coyne has announced the 2010 women’s lacrosse team captains for the upcoming spring season that gets underway this weekend at Lake Buena Vista, Fla., where the Irish face the U.S. National Team and Developmental Team in a pair of preseason games. Seniors Rachel Guerrera (Wantagh, N.Y.), Gina Scioscia (Summit, N.J.) and Maggie Zentgraf (Charlottesville, Va.) will be joined by junior Shaylyn Blaney (Stony Brook, N.Y.) as the team’s four captains as selected by their teammates.\n\nGuerrera, a two-time monogram winner, opens the 2010 campaign as a starter on defense for the third consecutive season. A tough, tenacious defender, she was a second team IWLCA West/Midwest all-region selection a year ago and will be in the running for all-BIG EAST and All-American honors this year. As a junior, Guerrera was fifth on the team with 33 ground balls and third in caused turnovers in helping the Irish to a 16-5 season, Notre Dame’s first BIG EAST championship and a trip to the NCAA quarterfinals. Off the field, she was selected to the IWLCA academic honor roll with a 3.49 grade-point average with a double major in American Studies and Film, Television and Theatre.\n\nScioscia, a three-time monogram winner, enters her senior season as the team’s top returning scorer after she finished second in scoring a year ago with career highs in goals (53), a school record for assists (43) and 96 points. Those totals earned her second team all-American honors and second team all-BIG EAST recognition for the first time in her career. The 53 goals were the sixth-best total in the program’s history while the 96 points was the third highest in the program’s history. Her totals were fifth in the NCAA in points and sixth in assists for the year. Scioscia is Notre Dame’s all-time assist leader with 82 assists while ranking ninth in goals (77) and sixth in points (159).\n\nZentgraf is a two-time monogram winner who is a well-respected team leader on and off the field. The senior brings versatility to the Irish lineup as she has seen action at both midfield and attack during her career. She is a key member of the team’s draw control unit and has that whatever-it-takes attitude that every team needs. As a junior, Zentgraf appeared in all 21 games, scoring six goals with one assist for seven points. She had 15 draw controls, six ground balls and three caused turnovers.\n\nBlaney rounds out the group of captains and is the lone junior in the group. A two-time monogram winner, she was a first team all-BIG EAST selection and a second team IWLCA/US Lacrosse All-American following at midfield following her sophomore campaign. An all-around midfielder who is strong at both ends of the field, Blaney was fourth on the team in goals (44) and points (470 in 2009. She tied for seventh on the team in ground balls (31), was second in draw controls (46) and fifth with 16 caused turnovers. Blaney, a sophomore midfielder, was a second team IWLCA/US Lacrosse All-American for the first time in her career. A first team all-BIG EAST selection, she was fourth on the Irish in goals (44) and points (47). After just two seasons with the Irish, she is already among the top 10 at Notre Dame in several categories – goals (eighth – 87), points (10th – 99) and draw controls (ninth -88).\n\n5. Keith Law of ESPN.com and ESPN Scouts, Inc. recently released his top 100 Major League Baseball prospects heading into the 2010 season. He also included a list of 10 more prospects that just missed the final cut, including former Irish center fielder A.J. Pollock – 2009 MLB first round pick of the Arizona Diamondbacks. According to Law, Pollock, amongst others, earned serious consideration but didn’t make the cut for one reason or another and included brief notes on why he wasn’t in the top 100 and a thought or two on his future. “He could very well jump into the middle of the list next year. He’s an athletic college kid who plays in the middle of the field and handles the bat well. Arizona pushed several of its draftees aggressively in their first summers, and Pollock, like Matt Davidson and Bobby Borchering, didn’t have great results. I’ve said this elsewhere, but I could see Arizona adding four or five guys to next year’s master list.” The rankings are limited to players who still have rookie eligibility; that means they have yet to exceed 130 at-bats or 50 innings pitched in the majors and have not yet spent 45 days on the active roster of a major league club, excluding call-ups during the roster expansion period after Sept. 1. Only players who have signed professional contracts are eligible.\n\n6. Nebraska-Omaha snapped a 2-1 Notre Dame lead with four unanswered goals on the way to a 5-3 hockey win over the Irish on Friday night in front of a sellout crowd of 3,007 at the Joyce Center. The Irish scored all three goals on the power play with Ben Ryan, Kyle Palmieri and Brett Blatchford all lighting the lamp on eight tries with the man advantage. The loss dropped Notre Dame into a seventh-place tie with Ohio State as the Irish fell to 11-11-7 overall and 7-8-6-2 in the CCHA, for 29 points. That puts them one behind Nebraska-Omaha as the Mavericks improve to 13-11-5 on the year and 9-10-2-1 for 30 points in conference play. The UNO win snapped a six-game Irish winning streak versus the visiting Mavericks. The loss also dropped the Irish to 6-7-3 at the Joyce Center, just a year after going 13-3-2 on home ice. Tonight, the Irish players will be “giving the shirts off their backs,” following the game. Since last Friday, the commemorative jersey that Notre Dame will wear in just the two games of the series have been available for bidding in an auction with the proceeds going to benefit the Wounded Warriors Project. Fans can bid on the jerseys at und.com/auctions until 9:30 p.m. on Saturday night. Following the game, fans in attendance that have the winning bids will receive their jerseys on the ice.\n\n7. Freshman Bill Bass won the 200 individual medley Friday evening at the Rolfs Aquatic Center in a season-best 1:50.70 to give Notre Dame its lone win in men’s swimming and diving action against three visiting teams. Notre Dame leads Denver (77-33) but trails Iowa (66-43) and Missouri (59-51) through the opening session of the Shamrock Invitational. Day two of the invite began this morning.\n\n8. Amywren Miller registered an NCAA B-cut performance in the 50 free with a 23.01 to earn one of three Notre Dame wins Friday to open the Shamrock Invitational at the Rolfs Aquatic Center. Miller was joined in the win column by Natalie Stitt (1-meter diving) and the 200 free relay tandem. In fact, Miller also anchored the relay squad that was led by Amy Prestinario, Lauren Scott and Kellyn Kuhlke. The Irish pace the four-team field in the non-conference swimming and diving event which is being scored as separate dual meets between each squad. Notre Dame leads Denver (89-21), Iowa (71-39) and Missouri (70-40) heading into the Saturday morning session.\n\nFriday, January 29, 2010\n\n1. The Denver Broncos promoted linebacker coach and former Irish graduate assistant coach Don “Wink” Martindale to defensive coordinator yesterday. Martindale replaces Mike Nolan, who parted ways with the Broncos Jan. 18 because of philosophical differences with head coach Josh McDaniels. Nolan was named the defensive coordinator in Miami last week. Denver’s defense was ranked No. 7 in the NFL under Nolan. However, the unit tired toward the end of the season as Denver finished 2-8 and out of the playoffs after a 6-0 start. Martindale, 46, came to Denver after serving as the Oakland Raiders’ linebackers coach since 2004. He was an Irish graduate assistant coach in 1994-95.\n\n2. Starting this year, the Paul Hornung Award will honor the nation’s most versatile college football player. The Louisville Sports Commission announced Wednesday the creation of the new award, named after the 1956 Heisman Trophy winner from Notre Dame. Hornung played quarterback, defensive back and kicked for the Fighting Irish. During his Heisman-winning senior season he led Notre Dame in passing, rushing, scoring, kickoff and punt returns, punting, field goals and points after touchdowns. He went on to a Hall of Fame career as a running back with the Green Bay Packers. The winner will be picked by a selection committee of 12-16 former players and media members, including former New York Giants quarterback and current CBS analyst Phil Simms.\n\n3. The Feb. 1 edition of Sporting News has this to say about Notre Dame’s Golden Tate: “The Bengals are scouting WRs Dez Bryant (Oklahoma State) and Golden Tate (Notre Dame) heavily, with the hope one will fall into their lap at No. 21. Both have the speed, athleticism and playmaking ability to stretch the defense and get the offense into the red zone quickly.”\n\n4. Also from Sporting News, the magazine rates the BCS coaching changes for 2010 based on “who is most likely to win immediately” and lists USC #1, Cincinnati #2, Notre Dame #3, Kansas #4, Louisville #5, South Florida #6, Texas Tech #7, Tennessee #8 and Virginia #9. Of Brian Kelly and the Irish, the publication wrires, “Questions about the quarterback – Can a banged up Dayne Crist replace Jimmy Clausen? – will mark the Irish’s offseason. Questions about the defense – Can they stop anyone? – will loom until midseason. The program will have to trust Kelly – and his .744 winning percentage as a head coach – to be successful in 2010.”\n\n5. Also in Sporting News, there’s a list of the 10 best college basketball transfers and Notre Dame’s Ben Hansbrough makes the second team of five players, with this notation: “The Irish expected him to make shots, but he has made a potent offense more lethal with his playmaking skills.”\n\n6. Although #3 Notre Dame didn’t solve its problem of starting slow, it looked a lot better in the first half against Providence than in its past three games. The Fighting Irish (18-1, 5-1 BIG EAST), who had fallen behind by double digits in their previous three women’s basketball games, trailed for just 13 seconds after Providence scored the first basket and broke the game open with a 13-2 run midway through the first half en route to an 84-59 victory Wednesday night. “I thought we were a little sloppy. I didn’t think we had quite the intensity maybe that we needed to start the game,” Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said. “But overall, offensively, I thought we did some good things.” Lindsay Schrader scored 12 of her 14 points in the second half, Natalie Novosel had 12 and Becca Bruszewski, Skylar Diggins and Ashley Barlow had 10 points each. “I don’t know what’s the deal,” Schrader said. “Our team doesn’t really kick it into second gear until the second half, that’s me included. I don’t know.” Notre Dame’s backups outscored Providence’s 31-13. “We’re wearing people down in the second half because of the depth we have,” McGraw said. Providence coach Phil Seymore said the Irish are a joy to watch except for when on the opposing bench. “They do a wonderful job of passing. They all have a lot of intangibles individually with that team. They’re very skilled, shoot the ball really well. I think that’s what makes them a very good basketball team,” he said. “It’s not like they have enormous height or anything like that. They really are one unit. They really play together.” The Irish led 35-22 at halftime, then opened the second half with a 5-0 burst to take an 18-point lead. “They did a lot of different things to disrupt the way we play,” Seymore said. “They threw a lot of different things at us that threw our rhythm off. We never had a chance to settle in.” Schrader narrowly missed becoming the first Fighting Irish player in six years to record three consecutive double-doubles, a feat last pulled off by Jacqueline Batteast in the 2004 NCAA Championship (vs. Missouri State, Middle Tennessee and Penn State). Senior center Erica Williamson nabbed three rebounds, putting her 10 away from becoming the third active Fighting Irish player with 500 career rebounds (Connecticut is the only BIG EAST school with three active 500-rebound players).\n\n7. The sixth-ranked Irish women’s tennis team will take to the courts at the Eck Tennis Pavilion for the first time this season when they host Boise State, DePaul and North Carolina as part of the ITA Kickoff Weekend. No. 33 Boise State and No. 17 North Carolina will face off in the weekend’s first match at 10 a.m. Saturday, followed by Notre Dame and No. 46 DePaul at 3 p.m. Saturday’s winners will face off on Sunday with the team winning both its matches advancing to the ITA National Team Indoor Championships in Madison, Wis., Feb. 12-15. The losers of Saturday’s contests will also play a consolation match on Sunday. The Irish are 2-0 this season after convincing wins at Iowa and Wisconsin. Notre Dame topped the Hawkeyes, 6-1, before sweeping the Badgers, 7-0.\n\n8. Season tickets for Notre Dame’s 2010 men’s and women’s lacrosse home schedules are currently on sale through the Notre Dame ticket office.

Scottie Reynolds and Corey Fisher each scored 17 points to help #3 Villanova get off to the best start in history–a season after advancing to the NCAA Final Four–with a 90-72 win over Notre Dame on Wednesday night. The Wildcats are 19-1 for the first time and are the only Big East team unbeaten in conference play (8-0). Led by Reynolds, Fisher, Antonio Pena and Co., Villanova has won 10 straight games and is in the mix for the top spot next week in The AP poll. Reynolds and Notre Dame’s Luke Harangody were each expected to state their cases for Big East player of the year. Harangody delivered on his end for the Irish (15-6, 4-4) with 21 points and nine rebounds in 37 minutes. Harangody played hard until the end and kept alive Notre Dame’s early bid for its first win over a top-10 team on the road since 2001. Reynolds’ final numbers weren’t overly impressive until a big spurt at the end. He scored nine straight points during Villanova’s 11-0 run over the final four minutes that put this one away. Reynolds’ first three of the game put the Wildcats up 84-67, then he swiped the ball away from the Irish and accelerated uncontested to the other end for a fastbreak layup that gave the Wildcats the push they needed to go ahead by 20-plus. For 30 minutes, this was a shot-for-shot game that kept the Irish within single digits. Tim Abromaitis scored 16 points for Notre Dame. The Irish coughed up valuable points with a 19-for-30 night from the free-throw line.\n\n11. Notre Dame fifth-year senior guard/tri-captain Lindsay Schrader (Bartlett, Ill.) is one of seven players who have been added to the 2009-10 State Farm Wade Trophy Watch List, it was announced Thursday by the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA). Schrader and her fellow mid-season additions earned their spots on this year’s Wade Watch List by virtue of their on-court performances to date during the ’09-’10 campaign, and they expand the player pool for this season’s national player-of-the-year award to 32, as selected by the State Farm Wade Trophy Committee. Schrader, a preseason all-BIG EAST Conference selection and three-time BIG EAST Weekly Honor Roll choice this year, becomes the fifth Notre Dame player named to the Wade Watch List in the past seven seasons, and the first since Charel Allen in 2007-08.\n\n12. Check out the Senior Bowl at 4:00 p.m. EST tomorrow on the NFL Network — and look for former Irish players Sam Young, Kyle McCarthy and Eric Olsen. Among those watching the Senior Bowl workouts this week has been new Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Charlie Weis.\n\n13. Notre Dame athletics director Jack Swarbrick spoke in Fort Wayne, Ind., yesterday and had this to say about Notre Dame’s new football coach, Brian Kelly, according to the Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette: “He’s extraordinarily strategic. Everything he does, and I mean everything, relates to winning. The smallest decision about the locker room or the players’ lounge or the schedule, all ties back to that goal. That level of strategic thought, I think is critical of a college head coach.” Here are more Swarbrick comments:\n\nOn the state of Notre Dame athletics: “I’m especially proud of the thing that for us means the most. We are competitively successful, but we won the national championship in academics. We were first in the country in graduation success rate. Our football program was tied for first. To be a top 20 Directors’ Cup school, that is to say we compete well in a lot of sports, and No. 1 in the academic measure of success, I couldn’t feel better about that.”\n\nOn the football program and coach Brian Kelly: “We are very optimistic. One of the things I was focused on in the search (for the next football coach) was really making sure that we were bringing in somebody who had a full program. Who understood all the elements of winning football. Brian has proven that. Nineteen years as a head coach, remarkable at his age, 18 winning seasons. We’ve made a number of changes in strength and conditioning, athlete nutrition, scheduling…All the little things that combine to help make a difference.”\n\nOn Notre Dame’s football coaching staff: “When you are in the process of hiring a head coach, one of the things you discuss is staff. How he intends to form the staff and whether he has ideas about specific people. All along, I had an idea of where we were headed and participated in the interviews we had with everybody. Couldn’t be more pleased. It’s a very cohesive staff. What they share in common is an extraordinary interest in being at Notre Dame. To have a head coach at Grand Valley State (defensive backs coach Chuck Martin) come and be an assistant coach, and to have some other guys, who were in great positions, come …Part of it is their relationships with Brian, but part of it is, many of them have longed for an opportunity to coach at Notre Dame. And that is what you want.\n\nOn Notre Dame’s football recruiting during the coaching transition: “I’m very pleased. People focus on the one or two that you lost. If we wind up, at the end of the day, losing two or three that’s great. We don’t want to lose anybody, but in a transition, we are getting some kids we wouldn’t have gotten otherwise. On balance, I’m very, very pleased. One of the things we wanted to do was get this staff on the ground and running as quickly as we could. I think we are reaping the rewards of that strategy.”\n\nOn the addition of a training table for the football team to eat dinner at Monday through Friday: “Nutrition is really important. It is one of those ‘Delta items,’ as they say, the difference maker. If you don’t do it, that’s when you realize how important it is. We think it will help a lot. It is part of a larger effort to focus on athlete performance in all of our sports. The football training table is the first pilot program. We will do another one, probably launch it in another month or so, for some other sports.”\n\nOn the 2011 and 2012 football schedules, and the speculation of an off-site game between Notre Dame and Maryland in Washington D.C. in 2011: “We are close. There has been a lot of speculation about one of the off-site games, but we are close on that one. The other pieces of the schedule are falling in line.”\n\n14. Media reports indicate two more former Irish assistant coaches from 2009 have been hired – Corwin Brown as defensive backs coach by the NFL New England Patriots and Bernie Parmalee as tight ends coach by the NFL Kansas City Chiefs (where he will re-unite with Charlie Weis). Brown played for the Patriots from 1993-96.\n\n15. Former Notre Dame fencer Mariel Zagunis will be honored Feb. 24 at halftime of the Notre Dame-Pittsburgh men’s basketball game in recognition of the sabre gold medal she won at the 2009 World Championships in October in Turkey.\n\n16. ESPN.com has published a review of the college football signees from four years ago – and includes Notre Dame four-year offensive tackle starter Sam Young as a member of its All-2006 Team.\n\nWednesday, January 27, 2010\n\n1. The University of Notre Dame is ranked 17th overall – and had eight of its Irish sports programs ranked in the top 15 — in STACK magazine’s third annual survey of the colleges and universities with the best combination of academic and athletic excellence. Published in the magazine’s holiday issue, the STACK Elite 50 College Rankings survey the country’s 50 leading college sports programs based on academics, athletic opportunity and overall performance. The survey also includes specific rankings for 21 sports.\n\nThe survey’s methodology included overall academic rankings based upon 2010 U.S. News & World Report’s annual “America’s Best Colleges” survey, athlete graduation rates (the current NCAA Academic Progress Rate figures), national sport-specific rankings (from ’07, ’08 and ’09, based on recognized polls), win-loss records over the last three seasons — and the STACK factor (strength of athletic community in terms of support and prowess through the 21 sports rated).\n\nThe top 20 universities are: Stanford, Florida, North Carolina, Texas, USC, Michigan, UCLA, Duke, California, Texas A&M, Virginia, Arizona State, Florida State, Ohio State, Georgia, Penn State, Notre Dame, Maryland, Washington and Connecticut. The STACK assessment of the Notre Dame program said, “Notre Dame’s ‘Four Horsemen’ for the 21st Century: hockey (#2), women’s soccer (#2), men’s soccer (#3) and lacrosse (#3).”\n\nSTACK provides information and entertainment to high school athletes through its magazine, a Web site and other media.\n\nEight Notre Dame varsity sports programs rank among the top 15 in the country within their respective sports in the STACK survey. The Irish hockey and women’s soccer programs ranked number two overall in competition with other programs around the country. Men’s soccer and men’s lacrosse both finished third, women’s tennis was ninth, men’s cross country was 10th – and men’s basketball and men’s tennis both stood 15th.\n\nHere are the various tables in which Notre Dame rates mention (individual sports charts included only the top 15 schools):\n\nTop 20 universities overall (with total points listed) — 1.

Notre Dame junior forward Tim Abromaitis (Unionville, Conn.) has been named to the BIG EAST Weekly Honor Roll for the second time during the 2009-10 campaign. He averaged 28.0 points and 4.0 rebounds per game as the Irish split a pair of contests with fifth-ranked Syracuse and DePaul at Purcell Pavilion. Abromaitis was big for the Irish on ESPN’s Big Monday (Jan.18) against the Orange, putting up 26 points on 10-of-17 shooting from the field, including five of 11 from three-point range. He also added three assists and two rebounds in the contest.\n\nThe forward followed that up by leading the Irish with 30 points in a 87-77 win over rival DePaul on Saturday (Jan. 23) in the 100th meeting between the two schools. Abromaitis connected on nine-of-16 shooting from the field, including five of nine from beyond the three-point line, while adding three assists and six rebounds. For his efforts, he was given the Wendell Smith Award, given annually to the most-valuable player in the Notre Dame vs. DePaul game. In league games only, Abromaitis ranks seventh in the BIG EAST in scoring at 18.4 points per game. His 22 three-pointers in conference contests rank behind only 24 by Seton Hall’s Jeremy Hazell.\n\n2. For the third time this season and the second time in three weeks, Notre Dame freshman guard Skylar Diggins (South Bend, Ind.) has been selected as the BIG EAST Conference Freshman of the Week, it was announced Monday by the conference office. Diggins becomes just the fourth Fighting Irish rookie ever to earn three BIG EAST Freshman of the Week citations in a single season, joining Ruth Riley (three in 1997-98), Alicia Ratay (six in 1999-2000) and fellow Washington High School alum Jacqueline Batteast (six in 2001-02).\n\nIn addition, fifth-year senior guard/tri-captain Lindsay Schrader (Bartlett, Ill.) notched her own triple, making her third appearance on the BIG EAST Weekly Honor Roll this season after both she and Diggins helped the Irish to a pair of comeback victories in BIG EAST play last week, including their fifth win over a ranked opponent this year.\n\n3. The Central Collegiate Hockey Association announced Monday that two Notre Dame hockey players have been selected players of the week for their play during the Lake Superior State series Jan. 22-23. Senior defenseman Kyle Lawson (Sr., New Hudson, Mich.) was named the CCHA defensive player of the week for the second consecutive week and the third time this season — while freshman goaltender Mike Johnson (Verona, Wis.) was the league’s goaltender of the week for the first time in his career. Both players were instrumental in Notre Dame’s 6-1 win over Lake Superior on Friday night and the 1-1 overtime tie on Saturday as the Irish limited the Lakers to just two goals on the weekend.\n\nLawson, the CCHA’s top defensive, defenseman in 2008-09, showed why this weekend as he recorded a pair of assists, six blocked shots and was +4 for the two-game series. In Friday’s 6-1 win, Lawson assisted on two of Calle Ridderwall’s (Stockholm, Sweden) three goals in his natural hat trick in the second period, had two shots on goal and two blocked shots. He also was on the ice for all five Notre Dame even-strength goals, giving him a +5 for the game. Johnson continued his impressive freshman season for Notre Dame as he stopped 71-of-73 (.973) Lake Superior State shots in 125 minutes of playing time while giving up just two goals on the weekend. In the 6-1 win on Friday night, Johnson gave up the first goal of the game at 2:01 of the first period and then slammed the door on the Lakers, stopping 26-of-27 shots on the win. On Saturday night, Johnson had a career-high 45 saves in the game as the two teams battled to a 1-1 tie in 65 minutes. In the shootout, he gave up the only goal of the extra time as the Lakers took a 1-0 win for the extra point in the standings.\n\n4. Among those New York Jets assistant coaches whose contracts have expired and will not be renewed is assistant quarterbacks coach John DeFilippo, who was a graduate assistant coach at Notre Dame in 2001-02. John’s father Gene is the athletics director at Boston College.\n\n5. Randy Hart, Notre Dame defensive line coach in 2009, has joined fellow former Irish assistant Brian Polian on the Stanford football staff.\n\n6. The spring sports seasons are not yet in full bloom, so you may not have noticed that Notre Dame currently has six teams ranked in the national top 10: men’s fencing is #2, women’s fencing #2, women’s basketball #4, women’s tennis #6, women’s lacrosse #9 and men’s lacrosse #10.\n\n7. Ever wake up in the middle of the night imagining you are running out of the Notre Dame Stadium tunnel with the University of Notre Dame football team? Then the 2010 Notre Dame Football Fantasy Camp is for you. Held June 7-10, 2010, the Notre Dame Fantasy Camp will be run by new Irish head coach Brian Kelly and his assistant coaches and support staff, along with current Fighting Irish players and numerous former Notre Dame greats. That group will provide daily hands-on instruction and interaction with camp participants. A portion of the proceeds will benefit the Notre Dame Monogram Club. You can register at http://www.und.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/2010-fantasy-camp.html or direct questions to Chad Klunder, Director of Football Operations, Phone: 574-631-8643 — Email: cklunder@nd.edu .\n\n8. As Notre Dame athletic teams kick into high gear for 2010, we take a last look at the past decade for Irish sports. Here’s a compilation of what each squad accomplished during the decade (winter seasons for 1999-2000 are used for sports that stretch over parts of two calendar years).

The Baltimore Ravens have hired former Notre Dame assistant coach Dean Pees as their new linebackers coach, head coach John Harbaugh announced this morning. Pees enters his seventh year coaching in the NFL after serving the past six seasons with the New England Patriots as their defensive coordinator (2006-09) and linebackers coach (2004-05). A 37-year coaching veteran, Pees was the head coach at Kent State from 1998-2003 and spent 15 other seasons as a defensive coordinator on the collegiate level. Notre Dame’s secondary coach in 1994, Pees also coached with former Irish defensive coordinator and current Ravens defensive coordinator Greg Mattison at the Naval Academy, where Mattison was the defensive line coach from 1987-88.\n\n9. Fundraising efforts held in conjunction with two University of Notre Dame home basketball games have resulted in more than $250,000 in donations that will go toward relief efforts in Haiti in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that hit the island nation on Jan. 12. Through the generosity of fans and alumni, as well as contributions from the University and the Notre Dame Monogram Club, the money was raised at the men’s and women’s basketball games that were played Jan. 23 and 24, respectively, at Purcell Pavilion. Notre Dame donated full gate receipts and net concession revenue from both games to the relief effort. In addition, a collection organized by the Notre Dame Student-Athlete Advisory Council raised more than $25,000 from fans and alumni who contributed during the games. The Monogram Club added a $10,000 matching gift to the student total. Money raised will benefit short-term needs and long-term rebuilding efforts in Haiti and will be distributed to the Notre Dame Haiti Program, which works to eradicate the debilitating mosquito-borne disease lymphatic filariasis; the Congregation of Holy Cross, which has served in Haiti since 1944 and was heavily affected by the earthquake; and Catholic Relief Services, the international humanitarian agency of the Catholic community in the United States.\n\nMonday, January 25, 2010\n\n1. Who knows what postseason NCAA competition will hold for Notre Dame’s fencing teams later this spring? But it’s hard to argue with having both your men’s and women’s teams defeat the #1 teams in the country on the very first weekend of regular-season competition. The Irish fencing teams did just that yesterday and turned in another flawless performance as the men and women combined to post an 8-0 record at the St. John’s Challenge in Taffner Field House. Included in those eight wins were two triumphs over defending national champion Penn State. The men downed the top-ranked Nittany Lions 16-11. After jumping out to a 2-1 lead in the match, the men never trailed. The second-ranked Notre Dame men’s squad also notched wins over eighth-ranked St. John’s (16-11), seventh-ranked Harvard (19-8) and sixth-ranked Columbia (23-4) to push their season record to 10-0. The Notre Dame women’s squad defeated the top-ranked squad from Penn State in much more dramatic fashion. After trailing 2-0, the Irish tied the match at 2-2. The teams then traded runs, with Notre Dame pulling ahead by a 6-2 margin, only to see Penn State come back with wins in four of the next five bouts to cut Notre Dame’s lead to 7-6. The teams then traded blows until Sarah Borrmann (Beaverton, Ore.) gave the Irish a 13-11 lead with her third sabre win of the match. Again, Penn State rallied to tie the match at 13 wins apiece setting the stage for a dramatic final bout that saw junior foilist Hayley Reese (Crestwood, Ky.) beat Olga Ostatnigrosh 5-2 to earn the 14-13 win for the Irish. The second-ranked women also earned wins over St. John’s (14-13), third-ranked Harvard (17-10), and fourth-ranked Columbia (18-9) to push their season record to 10-0.\n\nThe Irish fencing teams opened their 2010 season in style at the New York University Invitational Saturday at the Jerome S. Coles Sports Center, winning all 12 matches they participated in including a sweep of rival Ohio State to cap off the performance. The Irish were led by sophomore epeeist Courtney Hurley (San Antonio, Texas), who turned in a perfect 15-0 mark on the day. The second-ranked men earned wins over ninth-ranked Yale (17-10), sixth-ranked Columbia (20-7), Stevens Tech (22-5), eighth-ranked St. John’s (18-9), NYU (20-7) and third-ranked Ohio State (16-11). The women, who are also ranked second, earned wins over tenth-ranked Yale (17-10), fourth-ranked Columbia (15-12), fifth-ranked Northwestern (17-10), St. John’s (17-10), NYU (23-4) and sixth-ranked Ohio State (14-13). The women’s win over Columbia was particularly impressive as they came back from a 0-5 deficit.\n\n2. If her Irish take an early lead this week in games against Providence or Syracuse, Muffet McGraw may not know what to do. That’s after yet another impressive come-from-behind performance yesterday – this one against an 18-1 West Virginia team that had won 16 straight and after the Mountaineers led by 11 points at halftime and by 13 in the second half. As it turned out, #16 West Virginia could contain fourth-ranked Notre Dame and Lindsay Schrader only for a half. After being held without a shot in the first half, Schrader went six for eight from the floor in the second half and scored eight of her 16 points during a decisive run as the Fighting Irish rallied for a 74-66 victory yesterday. That come-from-behind effort came five days after the Irish wiped out a 12-point deficit to win at Louisville. “In the second half, Schrader just took over,” West Virginia coach Mike Carey said. “She got physical with us. Every time we got physical we got a foul called. She took over. I think she was the key.” McGraw said the Irish usually turn to Schrader when they need a key basket. “Everybody on our team knows when we’re not scoring we’re going to try to find Lindsay,” McGraw said. “Not to the exclusion of anybody else, but that’s going to be a look we want because she has so many mismatches. They had guards trying to guard her down there and we needed to take advantage of that.” The Irish trailed 44-31 after Madina Ali scored the opening basket of the second half, and trailed 49-39 when Vanessa House hit a three for the Mountaineers (18-2, 5-1 BIG EAST). But the Irish responded with a 16-3 run led by Schrader, who repeatedly scored baskets inside. Natalie Novosel capped it with a baseline runner that gave the Irish a 55-52 lead. The Irish put the game away with a 10-1 burst late to take a 74-63 lead. Skylar Diggins added 15 points for the Irish, Melissa Lechlitner had 12 and Ashley Barlow had 10 points and a career-high seven assists. The Irish (17-1, 4-1) turned the ball over only three times in the second half after having 14 turnovers in the first half. The Fighting Irish improved to 5-1 against ranked opponents while the Mountaineers fell to 1-2 against ranked teams. The loss also ended a 16-game winning streak for West Virginia, the second longest in school history.\n\nFor the second consecutive season, the Fighting Irish have registered five wins over ranked opponents, their highest total since the 2004-05 season, when they had seven Top 25 victories. Senior guard/tri-captain Melissa Lechlitner celebrated her 22nd birthday on Sunday by scoring in double figures for the sixth time in the past seven games. Notre Dame welcomed its second sellout crowd of the season (also Vanderbilt on Dec. 31) and eighth in the program’s history, with 9,149 fans in attendance at Purcell Pavilion. All the proceeds (gate receipts and net concessions revenue) from Sunday’s game, as well as Saturday’s home men’s basketball contest vs. DePaul, are being donated by the Notre Dame athletics department to assist in the relief and rebuilding efforts associated with the earthquake in Haiti earlier this month; in addition, members of the Notre Dame Student-Athlete Advisory Council (SAAC) circulated through the crowd at both home games this weekend, collecting donations for the cause — the total donation amount from the basketball games and SAAC collections (expected to be in excess of $100,000) should be determined this week.\n\n3. After having a fairly easy night on Friday night in Notre Dame’s 6-1 win over Lake Superior State with 26 saves, freshman goaltender Mike Johnson came up big on Saturday night, stopping a career-high 45 shots as the Irish battled the Lakers to a 1-1 tie at Taffy Abel Arena. Lake Superior picked up the extra point in the standings by winning the shootout, 1-0, in three rounds. Freshman left wing Nick Larson got the lone Irish goal, tying the game at 11:22 of the third period, just 23 seconds after the Lakers’ Zach Trotman scored Lake Superior’s only goal of the night. In the shootout, Lake Superior’s Domenic Monardo got the lone goal, beating Johnson through his pads on the Lakers’ first shot. Goaltender Brian Mahoney-Wilson stopped Notre Dame’s Ben Ryan, Calle Ridderwall and Ryan Thang on their shootout chances for the shootout win. The tie gives Notre Dame an 11-10-7 overall record while the Irish get one point in the CCHA standings and are now 7-7-6-2, good for 29 points and all alone in sixth place, just one point behind fifth-place Alaska. Lake Superior goes to 14-9-5 overall and the Lakers are now 9-8-3-2 in conference play, good for 32 points in the standings and they remain in fourth place in the CCHA playoff race.\n\nThe tie extends the Notre Dame unbeaten streak versus Lake Superior State to 12 games (9-0-3) since December of 2005. The Irish return to action on Friday, Jan. 29, when they play host to Nebraska-Omaha for the start of a two-game series at the Joyce Center. Face off is set for 8:05 p.m. With the tie, Notre Dame is now 1-0-7 in overtime games this season. The seven ties are the most for the Irish in a season since the 2000-01 campaign. Notre Dame is now 3-4 in the shootout this year. Defenseman Brett Blatchford saw his team and career-high eight-game point and assist streak (0-11-11) snapped in Saturday’s contest. His streak began on Dec. 13 versus Michigan.\n\n4. The Fighting Irish men’s tennis team split a pair of home matches on an eventful Sunday inside the Eck Tennis Pavilion. In its first match, Notre Dame dropped a 7-4 decision to second-ranked Virginia, but the Notre Dame rebounded to post a 7-0 win over IUPUI in the nightcap. Junior David Anderson (Sandwich, Mass./Sandwich) and Sophomore Sam Keeton (Kansas City, Mo./The Pembroke Hill School) led the way for the Irish, as each player recorded two singles wins and Anderson chipped in with a doubles win as well. After one weekend of play, the Irish now stand at 2-1 on the season.\n\n5. Notre Dame doesn’t have a direct connection to the Super Bowl in terms of active players (only the seventh time in 44 games Notre Dame has not had at least one player on one of the active rosters). But former Irish cornerback Terrail Lambert is part of the Colts’ practice squad – while former Irish all-star and all-pro kicker John Carney assists with the SaintsÃƒÆ’Ã†’Ãƒ € ‘ ¯ ¿ ½ kicking game.\n\n6. When Irish coach Muffet McGraw entered Purcell Pavilion yesterday just prior to the start of the Notre Dame-West Virginia game, fans held up placards that read “600” — denoting McGraw’s 600th career victory Tuesday night at Louisville. McGraw became the 19th NCAA Division I coach to record 600 career wins, and tied former Saint Peter’s coach Mike Granelli for 10th on the list of fastest D-I coaches to 600 victories (both McGraw and Granelli hit the mark in game #839); McGraw now has a career record of 601-239 (.715) in her 28th season as a collegiate coach, including a 513-198 (.721) record in 23 years at Notre Dame.\n\nSaturday, January 23, 2010\n\n1. Tim Abromaitis scored 30 points, Luke Harangody added 24 and Ben Hansbrough had 15 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists to pace Notre Dame to an 87-77 win over DePaul today at Purcell Pavilion in the 100th meeting between the two schools. The Fighting Irish (15-5, 4-3 Big East), who ended a two-game losing streak, started the game with a 7-0 run, and the Blue Demons never got closer than five. DePaul used a 7-2 run to close to 77-71 with 69 seconds left on a three-pointer by Mike Stovall. But Harangody scored on an alley-oop pass from Abromaitis with 59 seconds left, then added two free throws with 49 seconds left to put the game way. Notre Dame didn’t commit its first turnover until Hansbrough had the ball stolen with 10:32 left in the game. The Irish finished with a season-low two turnovers (compared to 22 assists). Will Walker led DePaul (8-11, 1-6) with a career-high 35 points on 15-of-30 shooting.\n\n2. The Fighting Irish men’s tennis team earned a dramatic 4-3 win over William & Mary Friday night in their 2010 season opener. Notre Dame took a 3-0 lead but the Tribe battled back to make it 3-3 before sophomore Niall Fitzgerald (Wicklow, Ireland) secured the win with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory at #3 singles. With the overall match and Fitzgerald’s third set with Jamie Whiteford both tied at 3-3, Fitzgerald broke, held and broke serve for the win. “Certainly some of our guys played with some jitters which you would expect in a first match and William & Mary came in here prepared having already played six matches so I think they were ready to go,” said Irish head coach Bobby Bayliss. “I feel like we had to pull out all the stops to win but hopefully being in such a tough match will make us better for the next match,” Bayliss added. Blas Moros (Boca Raton, Fla.) earned Notre Dame’s first singles win as he made quick work of Adrian Vodislav at #5 singles 6-0, 6-1. With the win in his dual season debut, 74th-ranked Moros gave the Irish a 2-0 lead as Notre Dame had already claimed the doubles point. Then, 93rd-ranked Stephen Havens (Cincinnati, Ohio) put the Irish up 3-0 with a straight sets win at #2 singles. After falling behind 3-2 in the first set, Havens downed Anton Andersson 6-3, 6-3. The Irish earned the doubles point with victories at the #1 and #2 positions. After falling behind 5-4, the tandem of Havens and Fitzgerald took down William & Mary’s Vidal and Vodislav 8-5 for Notre Dame’s first doubles point. Then Watt and junior captain Tyler Davis (Nashville, Tenn.) completed a center court comeback to give Notre Dame the doubles point. Watt and Davis had fallen behind the Tribe’s pairing of Juneau and Ilja Orre, 6-5, but the Irish duo broke, held and then broke serve again to clinch the doubles point.\n\n3.

Calle Ridderwall recorded his second hat trick of the season, getting three goals in the second period, while Ryan Thang, Ben Ryan and Patrick Gaul scored single goals to help Notre Dame defeat Lake Superior State 6-1 Friday night at Taffy Abel Arena. The six-goal offensive explosion for the Irish was a season high and the five second-period goals marked a season-best for one period. Ridderwall, who recorded a hat trick on Nov. 28 versus Bowling Green, becomes the first Irish player to get two hat tricks in a season since Tim Kuehl did it in 1987-88. Freshman goaltender Mike Johnson stopped 24 of 25 shots to record the win. The victory improves the Irish to 11-10-6 overall and 7-7-5-2 in the CCHA, good for 28 points. The victory also extended Notre Dame’s unbeaten streak versus Lake Superior to 11 games (9-0-2) since December of 2005. The Lakers are now 14-9-4 on the year and 9-8-2-1 in conference play for 30 points, just two ahead of the Irish in fourth place.\n\n5. The BIG EAST Conference gives a men’s basketball award for most improved player – and it’s hard to believe there’s a more deserving candidate than Notre Dame’s Tim Abromaitis. Coming into this season, Abromaitis had scored all of 20 career points. All those came in 12 game appearances in 2007-08 as a freshman – he didn’t play at all last season as a sophomore. Today he scored 30 points in one afternoon against DePaul and is now averaging 16.7 points a game. Coming into today’s action, he ranked 11th in the BIG EAST in scoring. On top of what he’s done on the court, Abromaitis boasts a 3.7 GPA and will graduate in just three years of study.\n\n6. The sixth-ranked Irish women’s tennis team started the 2010 dual-match season off on a high note today, cruising past Iowa 6-1. Notre Dame swept the doubles matches to claim a 1-0 lead. Twelth-rated Kristy Frilling and Kali Krisik topped Sonja Molnar and Lynne Poggensee-Wei, 8-1, at #1 doubles, while Cosmina Ciobanu and Chrissie McGaffigan defeated Merel Beelen and Zuzi Chmelarova, 8-7, at second doubles.

McGaffigan took down Chmelarova, 6-2, 6-1, at #3 singles, while Krisik toppled Merel Beelen, 6-4, 6-1 at #4. Ciobanu defeated Klockenga, 6-1, 6-2, at #5 singles. Notre Dame’s only loss of the day came at #6 singles as Iowa’s Alexis Dorr edged Kristen Rafael, 7-6, 5-7, 1-0 (10-4). The 1-0 Irish will head to Wisconsin for a noon (CT) matchup on Sunday.\n\nFriday, January 22, 2010\n\n1. Former Notre Dame standout and Arizona Cardinals outside linebacker Bertrand Berry announced his retirement Thursday night on a weekly radio show he co-hosts in Phoenix. Berry played 12 seasons in the NFL, including the last six with the Cardinals. Berry finished his career with 65 sacks, including six this season in a part-time role. Berry, 34, signed with the Cardinals in 2004 and made the Pro Bowl in his first season, finishing the year with 14 1/2 sacks. His next two seasons were cut short by injuries, but Berry played in 29 games over the past two seasons. He had 40 sacks with the Cardinals, ranking him sixth on the franchise’s all-time list. Berry entered the league with the Colts in 1997, a third-round draft pick out of Notre Dame. He spent three seasons with the Colts but was cut and spent the 2000 season out of football. He returned the next year with Denver and emerged as an elite pass rusher.\n\n2. The University of Notre Dame will donate the full gate receipts, as well as the net concession revenue, from both the men’s and women’s home basketball games this weekend to benefit relief and rebuilding efforts in Haiti. The men play DePaul Saturday (Jan. 23) at 2 p.m. (ET), and the women take on West Virginia Sunday (Jan. 24) at 1 p.m. (ET) inside Purcell Pavilion at the Joyce Center. Both games are expected to sell out. In addition, the Notre Dame Student-Athlete Advisory Council (SAAC) is organizing a fund drive to be held in conjunction with both games to encourage fans and alumni to make their own personal contributions to aid the relief efforts. During the first half of both games, more than 100 Notre Dame student-athletes wearing monogram jackets will pass buckets through the crowd. The council’s hope is that spectators will each donate at least $1, which would raise $11,000 for the relief effort. Money raised will be directed toward the Notre Dame Haiti Program, the Congregation of Holy Cross and Catholic Relief Services. Consisting of leaders from all 26 Irish athletic teams, cheerleaders and managers, SAAC discusses critical issues that affect the experiences of student-athletes, initiates new programming ideas, participates in community service projects and acts as the student-athlete group liaison to athletic administration. Information about Notre Dame’s response to the Haiti earthquake is available on the Web at http://haitidisaster.nd.edu/.\n\n3. Four-time Pro Bowl selection Bryant Young, a mainstay on the defensive line for the San Francisco 49ers, was one of four assistant coaches officially hired by San Jose State’s Mike MacIntyre on Thursday. The coaches were to be formally introduced today. Young, who played 14 years in the NFL, was named to the NFL All-Decade Team for the 1990s, which culminated in 1999 with his earning the Comeback Player of the Year award. He coached at Notre Dame last year.\n\n4. Bruce Feldman on espn.com makes a case for Brian Kelly as the best new college football coaching hire, as opposed to two of his espn.com colleagues who considered Skip Holtz at USF and Mike London at Virginia. Here’s what Feldman wrote: “I like both of these hires, especially the Holtz hire, but I’m not going with either because I love Notre Dame’s hiring of Brian Kelly. The guy has been a winner everywhere he’s been and he knows all about putting together a staff, running the day-to-day operation of a college program and developing talent. He is also fantastic at handling the media (check out my interview with him here), which is a huge key at a place like ND — it can diffuse some of the tension that can build or better yet, hover around a program, and you’d better believe that can impact how a team performs. Many times we, especially in the media, get too caught up in systems, stats and who is “a four-star” recruit and who is not, and so we forget about the intangibles like leadership and understanding and instincts. Those are all qualities you can’t measure unless you simply factor them into the bottom line of wins and losses. Kelly’s track record at every program he has run indicates he “gets” it. His explanation last week about how he learns about the pulse of a program was telling: http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=4816079&name=feldman_bruce>\n\nYou talk. You listen. I went around and talked to as many players as I could before I went on the road. You talk to the managers and those people who don’t have any self-interest in what’s going on.\n\nAlso, when Kelly talks about things like “self-inflicted wounds” and spending time on the “internal operations,” those aren’t so much code words for developing talent as they are for enhancing team chemistry and allowing people to be at their best on game days. I’m not saying the Irish will play for a national title or even crack the top 10 in 2010, but they will get better. And I think they will keep getting better under him. I suspect it’ll be a long time before Notre Dame is staying home for bowl season again.”\n\n5. What were the most noteworthy achievements involving University of Notre Dame athletics in 2009? If you ask visitors to und.com, you’ll find that they are as impressed with Notre Dame student-athlete accomplishments in the classroom as they are with those on the playing fields.
