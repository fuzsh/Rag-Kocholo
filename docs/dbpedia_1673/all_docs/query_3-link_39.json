Lintz and leader Carrie Summerhays of Brigham Young shot thelow rounds on Tuesday -- identical rounds of 75. Summerhays, who takes atotal score of 147 into Wednesday's final round, holds a three-shot leadover Lintz at 150. Summerhays opened the tournament on Monday with anopening round 72.\n\nLintz's consistency has been her strength all season. She holds atwo-stroke lead over Ryley Webb and Claudia Ferrini, both of New Mexico, whoeach fired back-to-back rounds of 76 for identical 152 totals. Lintzentered the inaugural MWC Championship ranked No. 4 in the conference instroke average with a 76.0 stroke per round average.\n\nCowgirl junior Jessi Santesson of Worland, Wyo., shot a second roundscore of 82 to go with her opening round of 77. Santesson's 159 total isgood for a tie for 12th place with Heather Rollo of San Diego State.\n\nIn the team competition, the No. 1 seed, New Mexico Lobos, shot thelow round of the day with a 308, overtaking BYU and Colorado State, whichwere tied for the first-round lead. New Mexico's 36-hole total of 619 givesthem a five-stroke advantage over BYU (624 team score) and a 10-stroke leadover CSU (629 total) heading into Wednesday's final round.\n\nThe Cowgirls entered the Championship as the fifth seed, and endedthe second day of competition in fifth with a team score of 640. But UW isonly five strokes back of San Diego State (635).New Mexico entered theChampionship ranked No. 15 in the nation, while CSU was ranked No. 50according to the most recent Golfstat MasterCard Collegiate Golf Rankings.\n\n\"Jordan (Lintz) couldn't be in much better position heading intoWednesday's final round,\" said UW women's golf coach Jill Johnson. \"Withonly a three-stroke difference between Jordan and first place, she has anexcellent opportunity to win the tournament. Jessi (Santesson) fell back alittle bit today, but she's still playing some excellent golf, and is onlyone stroke out of the Top 10.\n\n\"New Mexico separated themselves from the field a little bit today,but it's been an extremely close competition for the team title. The girlsjust need to come out and play a good round tomorrow, and we'll have achance to move ahead of San Diego State.\"\n\nThe tournament is being played at the Sunbrook Golf Club in St.George, Utah. The course plays to a par of 72 and measures 6,011 yards.The tournament is a 54-hole event with the final 18-hole round to be playedon Wednesday, April 26.\n\nBelow are the team scores following the second round and Wyoming'sindividual scores for the Mountain West Conference Championship."
