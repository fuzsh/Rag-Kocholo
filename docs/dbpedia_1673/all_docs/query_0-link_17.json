        "text": "Top-Seed Reinhardt, Tennessee Wesleyan Advance to AAC Softball Winners' Bracket Final\n\nTop-seeded Reinhardt and No. 3 seed Tennessee Wesleyan are set to meet up in the winners' bracket finale in the 2024 Appalachian Athletic Conference (AAC) Softball Tournament. The four-day event is being held at Brickyard Park in Kingsport. Truett McConnell 5, Bryan 0 Kyleigh Sanders' impressive, two-hit, five-strikeout shutout eliminated the Lady Lions Hailey Cronic led the way for the Lady Bears going 2-3 at the plate, tallying one RBI and one run. Rebecca Graham followed going 2-2 with one walk, while Grace Folds had two RBIs and two runs. Jenna O'Brien and Casie Boatright were featured tallying one RBI a piece, while Abner had one run. Columbia 8, Union 6 Trailing 5-2, the Koalas still had Hope. As in sophomore Hope Azurdia, who drove in five runs to help lead No. 6 seed Columbia to the come-from-behind victory and eliminate Union. Azurdia jump-started the comeback with a two-run homer in the third inning to pull the Koalas to within 3-2. Azurdia's home run was her sixth of the season as she now has 24 RBIs, 27 runs scored, and hitting .292. She then smoked a three-run bases-loaded double in the 4th inning to give Columbia a 7-5 lead, their first of the tournament. The Koalas scored the first two runs of the inning on consecutive RBI sacrifice bunts from Bailey Strickland and Mary-Catherine Sanders. Sanders went 3 for 3 with 2 runs scored and a stolen base. A sacrifice fly from senior pitcher Kylie Smith in the sixth inning gave the Koalas an insurance run to go back up by two runs at 8-6. Smith finished off the complete game win with a 1-2-3 seventh inning. Smith allowed 5 runs on 10 hits while walking three and striking out one. Reinhardt 8, Brenau 0 Whitney Shepherd turned in a six-hit shutout as Reinhardt picked up the win over No. 5 seed Brenau. Shepherd had 3 strikeouts for the Eagles and scattered 6 hits over the five innings. Offensively, the Eagles scored six in the first couple of innings which ultimately shut the door on Brenau. Alexis Griffith and Alexis Teems both were 2 for 3 in the game with Griffith picking up one RBI and scoring a run. Eryn Lee and Kylie Freije each drove in a pair of runs for the Eagles. The win was the 40th of the season for Reinhardt (40-8). Tennessee Wesleyan 4, Johnson 3 The last game of the day arguably topped them all in the form of drama as the game went into extra innings tied at 2-all. In the top of the eighth, Bailee Phillips blasted a two-run home run to put Tennessee Wesleyan ahead. However, Johnson's Megan Armstrong led off the bottom of the inning with a solo shot getting the Royals back within one. Ashley Duke followed with a single, but the Royals could not get a runner off of first as the Bulldogs prevailed. Madisun Pritchard (Elizabethton) suffered the loss for Johnson. Audrey Moorhouse (Daniel Boone) had one hit in four at-bats. 2024 AAC Softball Tournament Schedule Tuesday, April 30 Game 1 - No. 5 Brenau 12, No. 4 Truett-McConnell 4 Game 2 - No. 1 Reinhardt 5, No. 8 Bryan 3 Game 3 - No. 2 Johnson 9, No. 7 Union 1 Game 4 - No. 3 Tennessee Wesleyan 8, No. 6 Columbia 0 Wednesday, May 1 Game 5 - No. 4 Truett McConnell 5, No. 8 Bryan 0 - Bryan eliminated Game 6 - No. 6 Columbia 8, No. 7 Union 6 - Union eliminated Game 7 - No. 1 Reinhardt 8, No. 5 Brenau 0 Game 8 - No. 3 Tennessee Wesleyan 4, No. 2 Johnson 3 Thursday, May 2 Game 9 - No. 6 Columbia (25-21) vs. No. 5 Brenau (27-16), 11:00 a.m. Game 10 - No. 4 Truett McConnell (26-17) vs. No. 2 Johnson (24-14), 1:00 p.m. Game 11 - No. 1 Reinhardt (40-8) vs. No. 3 Tennessee Wesleyan (26-11), 3:00 p.m. Game 12 - Game 9 Winner vs. Game 10 Winner, 5:00 p.m. Friday, May 3 Game 13 - Game 11 Loser vs. Game 12 Winner, 11:00 a.m. Game 14 - Championship Game 1 - Game 11 Winner vs. Game 13 Winner, 1:00 p.m. Game 15 - Championship Game 2 - Game 14 Winner vs. Game 14 Loser, 3:00 p.m. (if necessary)\n\nComplete Story\n\nMilligan Opens AAC Quarterfinals With Win Over Bryan as Three of Top Four Seeds Advance to Semis\n\nThe first round of the double-elimination AAC baseball tournament is in the books, with three of the four favorites holding serve. Only No. 6 Montreat pulled the upset, beating third-seeded Pikeville 9-7, in the tournament at Hunter Wright Stadium.

Braden Spano (Greeneville) singled in the game's first run, and Caleb Berry later scored thanks to a Lion error for a 2-0 advantage. The good times continued to roll in the second with a five-run rally. Angel Lobo got the outburst started with a two-run home run, upping the margin to 7-0.

The Lions tried to mount a comeback in the ninth but were only able to scratch out one additional run, making the final 10-3. Lobo finished the game 2-for-4 with three RBI and two runs scored, while Spano and Jones each had two RBI. Berry went 3-for-5 with a double two runs scored.

UPike's Noah Helton had two hits including his 16th home run of the season, a three-run shot in the first. Tennessee Wesleyan 3, Union 1 In a rematch of last year's championship, Union took a 1-0 lead in the fourth on a Tyler Bean single to center. It stayed that way until a Kruise Newman triple tied it in the bottom of the seventh. In the eighth, a double by Jack Stevens put TWU in front and he then scored an insurance run. Sam Rochard won a terrific pitcher's duel, going 8 and recording 8 strikeouts. Ethan Warren went the distance for Union, scattering six hits and striking out three. Reinhardt 8, Bluefield 6 Catcher Matty Maurer blasted a two-run home run to right-center field in the bottom of the 12th inning to give No. 1 Reinhardt the win. Bluefield had rallied from a 5-1 deficit with two in the sixth and three in the seventh to take a 6-5 lead. The Eagles tied it in the eighth and it remained that way until the homer.

As it had in the first two meeting, the Lions won the first frame, and once it again it seemed Milligan was going to answer after evening the match in the second, but the athletic Bryan front line proved too formidable this time around in the 25-17, 18-25, 25-19, 25-21 victory. The win secures a berth in the NAIA National Tournament for the Lions along with CIU which swept to a second straight AAC Tournament title later in the day. âWe just werenât in rhythm from the start,â said Milligan coach Doneva Bays. âI think we fought back, but I feel like offensively we just couldnât get going.â Bryan quickly opened 10-3 and 14-5 leads in the first and third sets. Tied 3-3 in the third, three straight errant passes were answered with kills by the Lion front line. The front line also produced four early blocks and ten total in the match. âWe started in a hole today with our defense and serve receive,â noted Bays. âIt was more of a guessing game than staying disciplined on defense. âOur serve receive then dictated our offense and we became a little bit one dimensional and predictable so that makes it easy for the block and they established their block very well early.â Bryan got expected production from Abby Rector (16 kills) and Raegan Malugin (7 kills) but also got 16 kills from Lillie Van Metre, eight from Sarah Moore and seven from Alison Knop. âA couple of their pins played better,â noted Bays. â16 (Rector) and 33 (Malugin) are by far their best kids and we know that, but they had more kills today from 5 (Moore) and 20 (Van Metre) than theyâve had against us all year.â Shelby Miller (Unicoi County) paced the Buffs with 17 kills followed by all-tournament selection Ella Maiden (Patrick Henry) with 16 and Avery Maiden (Patrick Henry) with 11. âOur pins did great,â said Bays. âShelby (Miller) and Avery (Maiden) played great and Ella (Maiden) is always going to give me kills and digs.â Kolbie Greene handed out 45 assists and came up with 14 digs. Zoie Larkins (Dobyns-Bennett) led the defense with 21 digs with Rachel Falin (Dobyns-Bennett) chipping in with nine and Riley Brinn (Daniel Boone) six. Senior Taylor Povich was solid with nine kills and seven digs. Senior Grayson Stevens (Daniel Boone) served three aces as did Larkins. Another senior, Hannah Holmes (Patrick Henry), struggled through discomfort to come up with two digs and one ace. âHannah struggled with a knee injury and missed the first half of the season,â said Bays. âWeâve been using her in the middle back. Sheâs a very gritty kid that play injured all year.â Milligan ends the season at 26-7, finishing one win shy of the national tournament. âThe hardest part is for the seniors being the end,â added Bays. âThey are a good bunch and we have a good core coming back. I have great players and Iâm a blessed coach. We fought hard all year. One game doesnât define our season.â CIU 3, Bryan 0 Top-seeded Columbia International hit a slight bump in the road in the semifinal round before refocusing and sweeping its way to a second consecutive championship. CIU needed four sets to get by No. 4 seed Reinhardt in the semifinal round; however, it only used three to defeat third-seeded Bryan in the title match. Kira Rymer Attaway posted 13 kills and a .481 hitting percentage in the final for CIU, earning her Tournament MVP honors. Joining her on the All-Tournament Team are Hanah Weiss and Kelcey Mangum of CIU; Abby Rector and Raegan Malugin of Bryan; Sarah Sweet of Reinhardt; along with Maiden.

As long as we take care of our 30x30, it doesnât matter who we are playing on the other side.âThe win is the 15th in a row for Milligan (26-6), which will face Bryan (21-9) in the second semifinal Saturday at 12:30 p.m. Regular season champion Columbia International (29-1) opens the day at 10:00 p.m. against fourth-seed Reinhardt (22-7), a five-set winner over Truett McConell. The winners will meet in the championship match at 4:00 p.m. An eight-point run early in the first set pushed Milligan to a 10-3 lead and the body language exhibited by Bluefield seemed to indicate the Rams knew how the rest of the day would follow.âThat quick start was really important,â said Unicoi County product and second-team all-conference selection Shelby Miller. âWe wanted to set the tone for the tournament that we mean business.âAs it has all season, Milligan let its defense prepare the table, holding Bluefield to a paltry 0.008 hitting percentage. The Rams were below zero in the first two sets.âWeâve been strong defensively all year,â noted Bays. âWe have Ella (Maiden) that can block and hit and Shelby has a huge arm, but our defense has won us a lot of ballgames this year.âFormer Dobyns-Bennett Lady Indian picked up 18 digs from her libero position while another former Lady Indian Rachel Falin came up with nine as did Patick Henry product Hannah Holmes while Riley Brinn, a former Daniel Boone Lady Trailblazers, came up with seven.âRiley has been consistent at middle back,â Bays said. âWe have some really good depth on the defensive side with Rachel and Hannah and Zoie has made just a huge impact on our team.âLarkins spent two years at Division II Francis Marion before coming home to Milligan this season.âItâs been a good fit for us and a good fit for her,â added Bays. âWhen you are happy you look better, you feel better and you just play better.âAAC Setter of the Year Kolbie Greene dished out 38 assists on the day, but also paced the defense with 20 digs.âThe thing that makes Kolbie a really great setter is that she plays really great defense,â explained Bays. âA lot of setters donât play defense so she makes out defense better as a setter and a lot of times thatâs not the case.âLarkins was named to the leagueâs all-conference second team in her first year on the squad.âItâs been fun, getting to play with these girls I played against in high school and with Kolbie, who I played club ball with at K-2,â said Larkins. âItâs been great.âAhead 13-7 in the opening frame, Milligan ran off six more in succession and closed out the set with a 12-4 run. Daniel Boone product Greyson Stevens had a kill on a slide in the sequence with Taylor Povich converting a brilliant dig from Zoie Larkins into a set-clinching kill.Bluefield led early in the second frame, 7-4, before Miller simply took over, collecting four kills over a five-point Buffsâ string.Millerâs eye-popping leaps and swings led Milligan with 14 kills. âShelby has a fantastic vertical and her hang time is incredible,â said Bays. âWe are still working on her timing. We she gets that perfect timing, itâs dynamite. Because of her athleticism and vertical, she gets to balls other people canât get to.âBluefield fought back to within one point at 15-14. It was still tight at 18-16 when Falin strode to the service line. Falinâs deliveries kept the Rams off balance in an six-point streak that included two more Miller kills. Another Miller haymaker off a perfect short set from Greene pushed the Buffs to a two-set cushion.âOn top of her Setter of the Year skills, Kolbie is a fantastic motivator,â noted Miller. âSheâs going to encourage everyone on the team to be the best we can.âTwo phenomenal Larkins one-handed diving digs were turned into a kill by AAC all-conference first-teamer Ella Maiden to start another string of five straight service points by Falin. Miller converted yet another dig to produce a late ten-point cushion that allowed Bays to free substitute down the stretch.âItâs been fantastic having Zoie on the team,â said Miller. âI love having her on the back row and I love playing with her.âMaiden tallied 13 kills on the day while Povich finished with ten.Bluefield got eight kills from Liangelys Santana, 16 assists from Jimenez Nayerly and 19 digs from Georgia Lewis.Columbia International 3, Montreat 0The Rams put on an impressive hitting display in a 25-18, 25-8, 25-13 sweep of the Cavs.CIU logged 46 kills in the match with only six errors for an impressive .465 hitting percentage.Reinhart 3, Truett McConnell 2The Eagles survived the Bears comeback bid from two sets down for a 25-17, 25-18, 20-25, 14-25, 15-13 victory.Allison Selwy compiled 14 kills, while Ashlynn Barnes doled out 53 assists to go with 14 digs for ReinhardtBryan 3, Brenau 0The Lions made it three sweeps in four quarterfinal matches with a 25-10, 25-10, 25-14 whipping of the Golden Tigers.

Saturday, the Bulldogs captured their ninth consecutive Appalachian Athletic Conference Men's Basketball Tournament championship at the venue with an 84-79 win over No. 2 seed Montreat. This is the 10th year the tournament has been held in Kingsport, and Union has one the last nine and is 28-0 during that stretch. Markelle Turner nabbed Tournament MVP honors with 36 points in the title game. Turner tallied 92 total points in the three tournament games in Kingsport, averaging 30.7 per game. Joining Turner on the All-Tournament Team are Andre Silva and Teddy Fifer from Union, Noah Dunn and Jaja Davis from Montreat, Enonka Franky of Truett McConnell, and Darrian Oates of Columbia International. Union opened the game on fire, leading by 14-4 lead with 16 minutes to go. However, Montreat battled back and took a 44-43 lead into the half. The Cavaliers quickly grabbed a five-point lead as the second half unfolded, but the Bulldogs bounced back to tie the game at 51-all with 15:46 remaining. The scoring went back-and-forth until Union used a 6-0 spurt to open up a 66-60 advantage at the 11:21 mark. Montreat managed to tie the score twice more at 71-all and 73-all. Yet, Union used another 6-0 spurt to build a 79-73 cushion with 3:48 to play. A Dunn 3-pointer pulled Montreat within 79-77 with 2:44 left, but union closed out the game on a 5-2 clip to secure the 84-79 victory and the tournament title.

Shut down to due to Covid in early January, the Eagles went from December 13 to January 18 between games before facing a gauntlet of 16 games over a 34-day stretch prior to the tourneyâs arrival in the Model City. The three-day break between an 88-71 first-round victory over Brenau on Monday and a 63-42 win in the quarterfinals on Thursday was just the third 72-hour break between games since the resumption of the season five weeks ago. Thus, the Eagles came into the tournament as the fifth seed before upsetting top-seed and previously unbeaten Bryan, 77-64, in the semifinals Friday and taking out the second-seed Milligan, 72-57 in the finals Saturday afternoon. âThis team has been legit all along,â said second-year Reinhardt coach Tony Wagoner. âWe got shut down in January and we got behind the eight-ball. Then we had to play like an NBA schedule. We finally got a break after playing five games in seven days. But the adversity kind of set the tone for us.â Itâs the first AAC title for Reinhardt (20-13) since 2013 and clinches a spot in the NAIA National Championship Tournament. âIâm so impressed with Reinhardt,â Milligan coach Kylie Russell Greer. âThey have a great roster and everybody in this conference has been waiting for them to turn it up and they brought it at the right time. Major respect to Reinhardt for bringing it, for executing. They have a phenomenal team.â It was the Buffs (25-8) that jumped out to an 8-0 start and the local contingent led 22-11 late in the first period. But Reinhardt settled in, scored the final four points of the quarter and the first 13 of the second as part of an overall 22-1 run to put the Eagles up 33-23. Milligan trailed 37-26 at the break and never seriously threatened the eventual champs the rest of the way. âThe ball stopped falling for us in that second quarter and that separation was the separation that we had until the end of the game,â added Greer. âUsually, we are unfazed by a ten-point deficit. We are a very good second half team.â The Buffs finished just 17-of-54 from the field, 31.5%, and were just 8-for-26, 30.8%, from behind the arc. Most every shot after the initial offensive burst was well-contested by the Eagles. âFirst four possessions of the second quarter we got good shots, but they didnât go in,â noted Greer. âThen they took advantage of it and they turned it up defensively.â The Eagles also outworked the Buffs on the glass to the tune of a 42-34 rebounding edge. âReinhardt did a great job rebounding as well,â continued Greer. âThis is one of the few games where weâve been outrebounded this season.â Reinhardt 5-7 senior guard Abi Haynes was named as the tournamentâs Most Valuable Players. The Vincennes, Indiana native started the tournament with 40 points on 19-of-23 shooting against Brenau and followed with 22 points against Tennessee Wesleyan, 31 against Bryan and tallied a game-high 29 against the Buffs. Haynes was originally recruited by Wagoner while a Southern Conference assistant before originally inking with Ball State. Haynes averaged 31 points, 5 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 2.3 steals in the four tourney games. âThatâs Abi,â said Wagoner. âI recruited her when I was at Georgia Southern. Abi is unbelievable. Sheâs a great person. Sheâs the real deal. She wasnât at Ball State for no reason at all.â Ashley Woodroffe added 13 points and Catherine Shope 12 for the Eagles. Both were selected to the all-tournament squad. Milligan got 16 points and 10 rebounds from Jaycie Jenkins (Daniel Boone). Lauren Longmire (Grainger) finished with 13 points while Halie Padgett (Unicoi County) and Kayla Romines both scored 11 points. Padgett also grabbed seven rebounds as did senior Lily Griffith (Dobyns-Bennett). Jenkins and Padgett earned all-tourney accolades as well. AAC regular season champion Bryan will join Reinhardt in the national tournament. Milliganâs Greer believes the Buffs will receive an at-large bid when the 64-team field is unveiled on Thursday, March 3 at 7:00 p.m. With the tournament title, Reinhardt earned an automatic berth to the NAIA National Championship Tournament. As the regular-season champion, Bryan also advances to the national tournament. The 64-team bracket will be announced on Thursday, March 3, at 7 p.m. ET. âI do believe itâs very likely,â said Greer. âBut Iâm still waiting on that to come out. We have to keep practicing like thatâs the case.â 2022 AAC Women's Tournament Results Monday, February 21Game 1 - No. 2 Milligan 80, No. 15 St. Andrews 54Game 2 - No. 3 Point 88, No. 14 Johnson 62Game 3 - No. 4 Tennessee Wesleyan 92, No. 13 Columbia 43Game 4 - No. 5 Reinhardt 88, No. 12 Brenau 71Game 5 - No. 6 Kentucky Christian 77, No. 11 Montreat 54Game 6 - No. 7 Truett McConnell 58, No. 10 Bluefield 52Game 7 - No. 9 Columbia International 81, No. 8 Union 64 @ MeadowView Conference & Convention Center Thursday, February 24Game 8 - No. 1 Bryan 97, No. 9 Columbia International 77Game 9 - No. 5 Reinhardt 63, No. 4 Tennessee Wesleyan 42Game 10 - No. 2 Milligan 66, No. 7 Truett McConnell 44Game 11 - No. 3 Point 74, No. 6 Kentucky Christian 52 Friday, February 25Game 12 - No. 5 Reinhardt 77, No. 1 Bryan 64Game 13 - No. 2 Milligan 71.
