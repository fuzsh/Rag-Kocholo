        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS- Prior to the commencement of the 2024 Mountain West Baseball Tournament, the league released its 35-man roster of the most accomplished ballplayers in the Mountain West's 25-year existence. Air Force produced five players as members of the 25th Anniversary Team, including Mike Thiessen, Nic Ready, Paul Skenes, Sam Kulasingam, and Jay Thomason.\n\nThiessen, the current offensive coordinator for the Air Force football program, was a First Team All-Mountain West selection in 2000, as well as a two-time All-American. Upon graduation in 2001, Thiessen was selected in the 42nd round by the Arizona Diamondbacks. Thiessen is the all-time walks leader at Air Force with 143 career base-on-balls, and was a career .374 hitter as a Falcon. His 486 total bases are second-most ever at Air Force.\n\nReady, a three-time All-American, produced 224 career RBIs, the third-highest mark in conference history. His 50 career home runs are also the third-most in the history of the league, as are his career 544 total bases. Following his freshman season in 2016, Ready was named Co-Freshman of the Year, and eventually received three career Second Team All-Mountain West honors, as well as one First-Team All-Conference recognition.\n\nSkenes, the first-overall pick in the 2023 MLB Draft, was named to the list as both a pitcher and position player. The former Falcon accomplished much in his two seasons at Air Force, as his .410 batting average as a freshman in 2021 is the highest mark ever produced by a first-year player in Mountain West history, as was his .791 slugging percentage. Skenes also recorded 11 saves as a C4C, tying him with Keith Umlauf for the most by a freshman in program history. Skenes eventually was named the conference's Freshman of the Year in 2021. In 2022, Skenes shared Co-Pitcher of the Year honors after posting a 2.40 ERA, and was named the Mountain West Tournament MVP following Air Force's first-ever tournament championship. He was a First-Team All-Conference pick in his two seasons at Air Force.\n\nKulasingam is the only Falcon in program history to not only earn the conference's Player of the Year honor, but is one of only four players to ever win the award twice, doing so in 2022 and 2023. In 2022, Kulasingam managed 109 hits, becoming the first Falcon to ever record at least 100 hits in a single season. His 109 hits are second-most ever by a player in Mountain West history. He also produced 181 total bases as a sophomore, the third-most in a single season in league history. His 110 total bases in Mountain West play that same season remain a league record. Kulasingam owns 299 career hits, the second-most ever at Air Force, while his 77 career doubles remain in a timeshare as the most in the Falcons existence. Kulasingam, in his final season at Air Force, has produced a career .374 batting average in 203 games.\n\nThomason recently became the conference's all-time home run leader with 56 career homers, managing at least 16 home runs each of his final three seasons. A two-time First Team All-Conference selection, Thomason's 21 home runs in 2023 are the third-most by a Mountain West player in a single season, and are tied for the most ever in one spring by an Air Force player. He led all conference players with a .722 slugging percentage in 2023 while also leading the league with 74 RBIs as a junior.\n\nYou can find the entirety of the Mountain West's 25th Anniversary Team here."
