        "text": "I went from spending three days in San Diego straight to the circus show at Reno’s Livestock Events Center on Sunday afternoon, which is about as drastic a change one can endure from a city of pure bliss to a sad state of affairs (they were trying to charge $15 for a 45-second pony ride at the circus, which is ridiculous). But, enough about sad clowns. Let’s get straight to this week’s Monday Twitter Mailbag. Thanks, as always, for the inquires.\n\n(Editor's note: I think I fixed the tweets for mobile, so those should show up no matter how you’re viewing this story. Our national nightmare is over. Enjoy the Mailbag.)\n\nSo, I heard a few months ago the Mountain West adding Gonzaga wasn't outlandish and that it could actually happen (I even mentioned it in a Mailbag last month). I didn't put much stock into it at the time because I figured, \"Why would the Zags do that?\" But, since the San Diego Union-Tribune broke the story last week that the MW has had discussions with Gonzaga (as well as five other schools) about possible expansion, there seems to be more traction that I initially gave it credit for.\n\nHow much traction? When the talks began about six month ago, some in the MW felt it was more likely than not Gonzaga would actually join the conference. From a pure basketball standpoint, it makes a ton of sense and would be a great add for the MW, which has fallen from multi-bid status to one-bid status in each of the last two years (as well as this year if Nevada wins this week's conference tournament).\n\nStill, there are a lot of issues that have to be ironed out before this happens. Commissioner Craig Thompson called his talks with Gonzaga (and the other unnamed schools) \"exploratory.\" The big question is the financial impact.\n\nGonzaga's NCAA Tournament appearances have largely subsided the West Coast Conference. Each game a team plays in the NCAA Tournament is worth one \"unit.\" A unit's monetary value is $264,859. Gonzaga's run to the title game last season earned $8.55 million (a unit is held by the conference for six years). So, did Gonzaga get all of $8.55 million? No. They split it evenly with the rest of the WCC's other nine members. Rinse and repeat for Gonzaga, which has created almost all of the WCC's NCAA Tournament units while getting only one-tenth of the money.\n\nGonzaga is said to be frustrated with this, as it should be, hence the interest in joining a stronger conference where more teams are creating units to be shared. (There has been talk of Gonzaga joining the Big East, but the travel would be unbearable). Gonzaga is never getting in the Pac-12, so the MW is really the best option to upgrade conferences while keeping travel manageable. The MW has some traditional powers, including New Mexico, UNLV and San Diego State, and Nevada and Boise State have been strong in recent years. It's far better than what the WCC has to offer.\n\nBut, would that alone be enough for Gonzaga, or would the Bulldogs need more concessions? Gonzaga could push for an unequal share of tournament units. Maybe 50 percent of the unit goes to the team that earns it and the rest is split. No conference that I know of does this, and the MW's television deal that favors Boise State was highly scrutinized. But, that deal is a handout, while the tournament units would be earned by on-field accomplishments (much like a team reaching a New Year's Six Bowl in football gets more than an even cut of the money).\n\nIf I'm Thompson, I'd try to build the MW into a basketball conference. Add Gonzaga, add BYU (in all sports if you can, with basketball only has the fallback) and remove San Jose State. If you want to push it even more, you could add non-football schools like Saint Mary's and Grand Canyon to build up the basketball endeavor even more.\n\nThat above scenario would give the MW 12 football schools, with BYU heading to the Mountain Division and Boise State sliding to the West where it can play rivals Nevada and Fresno State annually. It would give the MW 14 basketball schools, which you can split into two divisions. Play home-and-homes within your division and one game against non-division opponents. That's 19 conference games per season, only one more than the current setup. And, the move also would boost the MW from seven baseball schools up to 11 (one three-game series against each MW opponent for a 30-game season).\n\nNow, this all makes sense on the field, but does it make sense financially? Adding more teams to the pot would splintered the television revenue into more chunks, although that TV package would be richer if you're adding Gonzaga basketball and BYU football to the portfolio. You'd also have the issue of Gonzaga, BYU and Boise State all thinking they run the conference. Three alphas can be hard to deal with, especially if they all want a bigger cut of the pie.\n\nIn the end, this could all be a ploy by Gonzaga to get more out of its agreement with the WCC, although if that's the case, its discussion with the MW would have leaked a lot sooner than it did. If you're trying to create leverage, you leak these talks shortly after they happen. This took half a year to leak, so maybe it's really real.\n\nGonzaga doesn't really need to move conferences. The Bulldogs regularly get high seeds in the NCAA Tournament and can schedule basically anybody they want in non-conference. But, maybe they're bored with beating Saint Mary's for the WCC title every season and see a move to the MW as the next step in their evolution.\n\nWhile I still believe the odds of this happens are below 50 percent, it all looks good on paper, and if it does happen, the MW would be a legitimate contender for top Western-based basketball conference in the country given the Pac-12's current standing. It also would give Mark Few a chance to beat Nevada, a team he is 0-2 all-time against. If I'm the MW, I'm doing whatever I can to make this happen.\n\nI spoke with ESPN Bracketologist Joe Lunardi today and he said that's darn near impossible. I'll have a full story Tuesday, but Lunardi has Nevada as a sixth seed (but realistically closer to a seven). If everything breaks right, the Wolf Pack could sneak into a five, but that's not likely. In short, the MW Tournament can't really help Nevada's seed, but it can hurt it.\n\nIt's more likely Eric Musselman stays at Nevada for five-plus years. Here is the full list of mid-major teams to reach the Final Four since 2000:\n\nGeorge Mason (2006), Memphis (2008), VCU (2011), Wichita State (2013), Gonzaga (2017).\n\nOK, that's actually more teams than I thought before I looked it up, but I'm still going with Musselman for five seasons is the better likelihood. It's really hard to make the Final Four.\n\nNo. The Wolf Pack's best athletic season ever (this was a Mailbag topic in November) came in 2005-06 when Nevada basketball earned a program-best five seed in the NCAA Tournament; Nevada football won its conference while beating a ranked team; Nevada softball won its conference title and reached the NCAA Tournament; Nevada volleyball made it to the NCAA Tournament; Nevada swimming and diving finished second in the conference championships; and Nevada women's soccer posted one of the two winning seasons in school history. I don't see all of those things happening next year.\n\nI don't think effort or mindset was an issue. SDSU just beat Nevada, although the Wolf Pack would point to its 12 free throw attempts, its second fewest this season, as the reason why. Nevada was plenty motivated, in part because San Diego is Eric Musselman's hometown and his team got smacked there last season, and in part because SDSU's Brian Dutcher said on his coaches show last week the Aztecs were the best team in the MW, which did not sit well with the Wolf Pack given it won the regular-season title by multiple games.\n\nThe biggest reason Nevada lost that game was only three of its players really showed up. When you have only seven scholarships guys (and Nevada only plays six), you can't have half your guys suffer an off game and beat a solid team on the road. I don't think there will be any negative hangover from the loss.\n\nNevada baseball is 5-5, but it’s a good 5-5. The Wolf Pack beat a ranked team on the road (Fullerton) and opened MW play by taking two of three at New Mexico, the defending MW champs. The pitching improvement has been the biggest takeaway through 10 games. The staff ERA has dropped from 6.18 last season to 3.80 this year. Freshman Jake Jackson has been a revelation. He’s 2-0 with a save and 0.47 ERA in four games (three starts). He’s struck out 27 and walked just three in 19.1 innings.\n\nYou’re right about the hitting. Nevada is slashing .249/.340/.388 as a team, which will not win a MW title. The Wolf Pack slashed .275/.358/.391 last season when it had the conference’s second-worst offense. The numbers have been even worse this year. That must improve. But, this is the kind of team coach T.J. Bruce wants. He’s all in on pitching and defense, which was the formula when he was an assistant at UCLA. There have been plenty of positives for Nevada so far this season. I see a top-three finish in the MW, spots typically held by New Mexico, San Diego State and Fresno State.\n\nI know you want me to pick between these two, but if you put a live wolf in a cage with these mascots, it's the wolf who's coming out last.\n\nI don't see Jordan Caroline transferring out of Nevada in the offseason. He loves it here, so much so he doesn't feel like his college career even started until he joined Nevada following a season at Southern Illinois. He also has a young son here, so there are family considerations. Now, if Eric Musselman were to get another job and a new coach came in and the fit was poor? Maybe. But, Caroline seems to genuinely love Nevada, and he has the freedom here to stretch his offensive game, so I don't see the appeal of a transfer.\n\nIt depends on who they hire and whether the returning players are comfortable with that coach, but I wouldn't expect major upheaval given Nevada really only has four returning players in the Martin twins, Caroline and Josh Hall. (Nevada also has four transfers sitting out this season, but I doubt they'd transfer again and sit out another season).\n\nThe MW, Pac-12, WCC and WAC all hold their conference tournaments in Las Vegas in a fairly close time schedule (the WCC is a little before the other three). Las Vegas has plenty of arenas and hotel rooms, which makes it a nice destination for these tournaments. I'm guessing the MW also gets a little bit of a price break since its event is held at a member institution (UNLV's Thomas & Mack Center).\n\nI don't see the MW leaving Las Vegas any time soon. If it was going to do that, it would have done a trial run for the 2020 event, which was moved up a week because of Las Vegas' CONEXPO-CON/AGG International Construction Trade Show. The MW did hold its tournament in Denver from 2004-06, but the rest of its tournaments have been held at Thomas & Mack. It's a fine location, although some in the MW would prefer the MGM Grand (cost is an issue there).\n\nI will most likely only see the inside of my hotel room and the inside of Thomas & Mack. But, for visitors, I'd suggest visiting the Hoover Dam, the Mob Museum, Red Rock Canyon, the Bellagio fountain show, Linq's Ferris wheel, the Caesar's Palace shops (Pete Rose will probably be there), Mandalay Bay's Shark Reef Aquarium, the Eiffel Tower at Paris Las Vegas, the Fremont Street Experience and dinner atop the Stratosphere tower. You'll probably want to go to a Backstreet Boys show, too.\n\nIt's really more of a six-man rotation since Elijah Foster doesn't get many minutes. The lack of depth is a concern for one reason, but perhaps not the one you would guess. I wouldn't worry too much about the top players wearing down because of too many minutes. Rotations usually shrink in the postseason, with the big dogs getting more time.\n\nI would, however, be concerned at the lack of options if somebody is having a bad game. There's nowhere for Musselman to go if a couple of his role players are struggling. That's an issue, as we saw with the SDSU loss. It's good to have options, and Nevada has few. The Wolf Pack also can't afford foul trouble given the position it's in.\n\nThe Wolf Pack's scholarship players this season as rated by CollegeReference.com's box-score plus-minus (the higher the number the better).\n\n1. Cody Martin, 9.2\n\n2. Caleb Martin, 7.8\n\n3. Lindsey Drew, 6.4\n\n4. Kendall Stephens, 5.8\n\n5. Hallice Cooke, 4.1\n\n6. Josh Hall, 3.3\n\n7. Jordan Caroline, 2.7\n\n8. Elijah Foster, 0.3\n\n9. Darien Williams, -5.7\n\nThat kind of says it all.\n\nFrom what I heard, his surgery went well. Last week, Musselman said Drew could be with the team in Las Vegas for the MW Tournament in a coach-style role.\n\nI have not obtained those numbers (and Nevada never gave them to me last year despite a request), so I'm not sure I will get them this season. Musselman's contract states he would earn 25 percent of every dollar over $1.431 million in ticket sales.\n\nIn its annual Board of Regents filing, Nevada reported $1.618 million in basketball ticket sales last season. The Wolf Pack's season-ticket base increased by about 1,000 people this season. Its overall attendance was a little higher than last year, too. Throw in increased season-ticket prices and the Wolf Pack probably made around $1.8 million in ticket sales (purely a guess there). That would be a bonus just under $100,000.\n\nMusselman also earned a $10,000 bonus for winning the MW title. He will get a $10,000 bonus Tuesday when he's named MW coach of the year by the coaches. And he'll get a $10,000 bonus when Nevada reaches the NCAA Tournament. (He also would get $10,000 if Nevada wins the MW Tournament). So, while Musselman's guaranteed salary is $1 million, he's probably getting closer to $1.15 million this season.\n\nI'd actually give SDSU kudos for holding Pope out and checking into his situation. Most of the other schools who had players in the Yahoo! Sports story didn't even do that. With that being said, I'm not sure what evidence the Aztecs could have found in that one-week period to prove Pope did not take any money from an agent. I have no idea how you prove that.\n\nThey probably can't survive that, but I have no idea why football and men's basketball have to subsidize every other sport on campus, anyway (and I'm not just talking about women's sports, but all non-revenue sports). Some of these programs lose $1 million a year. I know of no other businesses where this is allowed. College sports' business model is all messed up.\n\nSpring training is more or less worthless for fans, but I have noticed D.J. Peters, a Western Nevada College alum, has had a nice spring. He's hitting .462 with a home in 13 at-bats, which again is worthless given its small sample size, but he's raised his prospect stock over the last 12 months.\n\nMy three favorite current Dodgers are Corey Seager, Clayton Kershaw and Kenley Jansen. My three favorite all-time Dodgers are Jackie Robinson, Eric Karros and Matt Kemp. And I like Puig as long as he's playing well. If he's not playing well, the antics get old.\n\nAs long as you're getting players like Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Jordan Caroline and Marcus Marshall, it's sustainable. Talent is talent regardless of where it comes from. With more and more players transferring, the quality of player on that market will only increase. I get why it rubs some fans the wrong way, but I'd continue with the strategy and think it is a long-term strategy that can be effective.\n\nI'd take a good churro over pretty much any food in the world.\n\nKrusty the Clown.\n\nWilton Guerrero.\n\nI'm not allowed to answer this question, but you know the answer.\n\nI would like to see Musselman try and ride a unicycle, which reminds me of his first season when he basically did a circus act in the pre-game warmups to get people to come out to games (and some of those pre-game warmups did include a unicycle). Musselman ditched those the last two seasons because he didn't need them anymore for fans to attend games, which shows how far his program has come in such a short time-frame – from a circus show to the Top 25."
