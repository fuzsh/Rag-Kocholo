        "text": "Welcome to March Madness. As you prepare to fill out your 2024 men's NCAA tournament brackets -- might I suggest ESPN Tournament Challenge, where you can submit up to 25? -- we have a boatload of facts and trends for you to sink your teeth into.\n\nIt's been such an exciting season, one in which we saw top-10 teams lose to unranked opponents at a record rate. Now that the Big Dance is here, why should we expect the upsets to stop?\n\nThe usual disclaimer applies: This column is designed to inform and entertain, not to predict. You will hear from many ESPN personalities throughout the week, but this piece is all about historical nuggets we hope you will find interesting.\n\nNote: Unless otherwise noted, all stats referenced are since 1985 (also called the \"modern era\" throughout the column). In addition, any historical reference to the \"first round\" relates to the round of 64, and \"second round\" to the round of 32. The First Four stands on its own to avoid confusion. Lastly, all results mentioned ignore any subsequent vacating by the NCAA. For example, we consider Louisville the winner of the 2013 national championship game, even though its appearance has been vacated.\n\n(Mostly) seed-related trends\n\nFirst Four\n\n1. In 11 of the 12 tournaments when the First Four has existed, at least one of its participants has advanced to the second round.\n\nTwo have advanced to the Final Four (UCLA in 2021 and VCU in 2011)\n\nThree others reached the Sweet 16\n\n2023 marked the first time that two First Four participants reached the second round (11-seed Pittsburgh, 16-seed FDU)\n\nFirst/second rounds\n\n2. Not only has a No. 15 seed won a first-round game in three consecutive years for the first time, but all three went on to reach the Sweet 16 as well.\n\nPrinceton (2023), Saint Peter's (2022) and Oral Roberts (2021)\n\nSaint Peter's took it a step further by advancing to the Elite Eight\n\nNo. 15 seeds are 11-141 in first-round games. Nine of those 11 winners finished in the top two in their conference standings\n\nThis year, South Dakota State (first in the Summit League) is the only 15-seed that finished in the top two in its conference\n\n3. In the past five tourneys, 14 of the 20 matchups between No. 4 and No. 13 seeds were decided by single digits, the most of any first-round seed pairing.\n\nSurprisingly, only seven of the 20 matchups between 8- and 9-seeds were single-digit games\n\nNo. 13 seeds have won at least one game in 27 of 38 tournaments\n\n4. At least one top-4 seed has lost in the first round in 14 of the past 15 tournaments.\n\nLast year, there were three top-4 seeds ousted in their first game: No. 1 Purdue (by FDU), No. 2 Arizona (by Princeton) and No. 4 Virginia (by Furman)\n\n5. At least one No. 12 seed has defeated a No. 5 seed in 32 of 38 tournaments, but this once \"sure thing\" is trending downward.\n\n12-seeds failed to win a game just three times in the first 30 years of the modern era, but have come up empty in three of the past eight tournaments (2015, 2018, 2023)\n\n6. Second-round trend: No. 3 seeds suddenly feasting on No. 6 seeds\n\nSince 2008, No. 3 seeds are 22-5 against 6-seeds\n\nFrom 1985 to 2007, No. 3s were 26-25 against No. 6s\n\nSweet 16\n\n7. A double-digit seed has advanced to the Sweet 16 in 15 straight tournaments and 36 of 38 overall.\n\nLast year, 15th-seeded Princeton was the only double-digit seed to reach the second weekend\n\nFour teams seeded 10th or worse reached the Sweet 16 in both 2021 and 2022\n\n8. No. 11 seeds have played the Cinderella role well recently.\n\nAt least one 11-seed has made the Sweet 16 in seven of the past nine tournaments\n\nWe've seen multiple 11-seeds make it to the second weekend in five of the past 12 tourneys\n\n11-seeds were absent from last year's Sweet 16. The last time we had consecutive Sweet 16s without an 11-seed present was 15 years ago\n\n9. In the 68-team era (since 2011), there have been just as many No. 15 seeds to reach the Sweet 16 as No. 12s (four).\n\n10. All four No. 2 seeds have reached the Sweet 16 just twice in the past 26 tournaments.\n\nElite Eight\n\n11. At least two teams seeded No. 6 or worse have reached the Elite Eight in each of the past three tournaments (and six of the past seven).\n\n12. Last year marked the first time an Elite Eight did not have at least one No. 1 seed present.\n\nAll four No. 1 seeds reached the Elite Eight just once in the past 13 tourneys (2016)\n\nFinal Four\n\n13. There were zero No. 1 seeds in last year's Final Four, ending a streak of 10 straight tourneys with at least one.\n\nEither one or two No. 1 seeds have reached the Final Four in 30 of 38 tournaments (79%)\n\nOnly once have all four No. 1 seeds made the Final Four (2008)\n\n14. At least one team seeded seventh or worse has reached the Final Four in nine of the past 10 tourneys.\n\nBy comparison, in the first 32 years of seeding (1979-2010), this happened only eight times total\n\nEach of the past 13 tournaments has had at least one team seeded No. 4 or worse reach the Final Four\n\n15. It's been 32 years since a No. 6 seed made the Final Four, by far the longest drought among seeds that have a Final Four appearance.\n\nIn all, three 6-seeds have reached the Final Four: Michigan (1992), Kansas (1988) and Providence (1987)\n\n16. Bad news for Iowa State? Of the 36 teams that were seeded in the top two and in the AP top 10 after entering the season unranked, none reached the Final Four.\n\nBoth teams that fit these criteria last season lost during the first weekend (No. 1 Purdue lost to FDU in the first round, No. 2 Marquette lost to Michigan State in the second round)\n\nIowa State received no votes in the preseason poll, but earned a No. 2 seed and is ranked fourth\n\nEarly-exit alert: 15 of the 23 No. 2 seeds to meet these criteria lost in the first or second round\n\nChampionship game\n\n17. There has not been a repeat champion since Florida in 2007. Since then, no defending champ has advanced past the Sweet 16.\n\nOnly four of the 15 defending champs since then even reached the Sweet 16 ... and four others missed the tournament altogether\n\nDefending champs have lost in the first or second round in each of the past six tournaments, three of which were No. 1 seeds: Kansas (2023), Baylor (2022) and Villanova (2017)\n\nThis is the third straight year the defending champion (UConn) is a No. 1 seed\n\n18. No team has ever won a national championship after losing its first game in the conference tournament.\n\nTennessee (No. 2), Creighton (3), Kentucky (3), Duke (4), Kansas (4) and Alabama (4) are the highest-seeded teams to lose their conference tourney opener this year\n\n19. Since 2002, when KenPom began tracking it, 20 of 21 national champions have finished top 25 in adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency.\n\nThe only exception is UConn in 2014 (39th on offense, 10th on defense)\n\nUConn, Purdue, Arizona, Auburn, Houston, Creighton, Marquette and North Carolina currently meet these criteria entering this year's tourney\n\nDuke and Tennessee are very close to qualifying as well, so they could easily do so by the end of the tournament\n\n20. Twelve of the past 16 champions were 1-seeds. But it has been 11 years since the last time the overall No. 1 seed won the title (Louisville in 2013).\n\nEight of the 19 previous overall No. 1s lost in the Sweet 16 or earlier, including each of the past two years (Alabama in 2023, Gonzaga in 2022)\n\nThey have been more likely to lose during the first weekend (four) than to be champions (three)\n\nThis year's overall No. 1 seed is defending champion UConn\n\n21. A No. 2 seed has reached the championship game just once in the past 10 tournaments.\n\nVillanova won in 2016 as a 2-seed\n\nThe current six-tournament drought without a title game appearance is the longest ever\n\nThere has never been a matchup of No. 2 seeds in the championship game\n\n22. A No. 5 seed has never won a championship, the only seed in the top 8 that hasn't done so.\n\nLast year, a pair of 5-seeds made the Final Four in the same tourney for the first time\n\nSan Diego State became just the fourth No. 5 seed to reach the title game, joining Butler (2010), Indiana (2002) and Florida (2000)\n\nThis year's No. 5s are: San Diego State, Saint Mary's, Wisconsin and Gonzaga\n\n23. It's been 34 years since a champion came from a conference that received fewer than four bids.\n\nUNLV in 1990 (three-bid Big West Conference) and Louisville in 1986 (three-bid Metro Conference) are the only schools to do so in the modern tournament era\n\nThis year, UConn, Marquette and Creighton - all top-3 seeds and the only Big East representatives -- are the highest-seeded teams looking to end this streak. Both WCC reps, Gonzaga and Saint Mary's, are No. 5 seeds.\n\nConferences\n\nThe trends below range from positive to negative to just plain interesting, so the conferences are listed alphabetically to make them easier for you to find your favorite leagues.\n\n24. ACC has had at least one team reach the Elite Eight in 34 of 38 tournaments.\n\nMultiple Sweet 16 teams in 32 of 38\n\nAt least one Final Four team in 26 of 38\n\nAt least one team in the title game in 18 of 38\n\nWhile this is the first time an ACC team earned a No. 1 seed since 2019, the league has had eight teams reach the Final Four in the past eight tourneys\n\n25. Big 12 has had a team reach the title game in three of the past four tournaments, including champions in 2021 (Baylor) and 2022 (Kansas).\n\nConference teams are 21-5 in the first round of the past four tournaments (best win percentage of any conference)\n\nBig 12 teams seeded eighth or worse are 5-1 in the first round in that span\n\n26. Big Ten hasn't won a national title since 2000.\n\nJust four Big Ten teams have reached the Sweet 16 in the past three years (fewest in a three-year span since 1996-98) and none have made the Final Four\n\n27. Coastal Athletic Association has not won a first-round game since VCU left the league after the 2012 season.\n\nFour of the past five CAA teams to earn a 12- or 13-seed have lost by single digits in the first round (Charleston is a No. 13 seed)\n\n28. Mountain West finally got past the Sweet 16 last year but still has demons to exorcise.\n\nLast year, San Diego State became the first Mountain West team to get past the Sweet 16, advancing to the title game\n\nHowever, MW teams are 2-12 in the first round in the past seven tournaments\n\nMountain West teams seeded 10th or worse are 1-26 all time (including 0-4 in the First Four), with the only win coming in 2002\n\nWhile the conference received its most bids ever this year with six, four teams were seeded 10th or worse (Nevada, Boise State, Colorado State and New Mexico)\n\n29. It's been 27 years since the Pac-12 had a national champion ... and this is its final chance.\n\nThe last time it had a team in the championship game was 2006\n\nJust two Pac-12 teams in the past 15 years have reached the Final Four\n\nThe conference hasn't had a team advance past the Sweet 16 in four of the past five tournaments\n\nThis is the sixth time in the past seven tourneys the Pac-12 has received four or fewer bids\n\n30. Since 2016, none of the 17 SEC teams to earn a top-4 seed have reached the Final Four.\n\nThe only two SEC teams to advance to the Final Four since 2016 were seeded No. 5 (Auburn in 2019) and No. 7 (South Carolina in 2017)\n\nThe last SEC team to reach the title game was 8-seed Kentucky in 2014\n\nTennessee (2), Kentucky (3), Auburn (4) and Alabama (4) are top-4 seeds this year\n\n31. The Southern Conference is looking to win an NCAA tournament game in consecutive years for the first time in 47 years.\n\nThe last time it happened was when VMI won two games in 1976 and one more in 1977\n\nLast year, 13th-seeded Furman upset Virginia in the first round\n\nThis year, 13th-seeded Samford represents the conference and faces Kansas on Thursday\n\nSoCon teams are 5-33 in the first round in the modern era. Three of those wins were by teams seeded 11th or worse (Furman in 2023, Chattanooga in 1997, East Tennessee State in 1992)\n\n32. The past three Sun Belt Conference teams to earn a 12-seed won their first-round games.\n\nJames Madison is this year's Sun Belt rep and earned a No. 12 seed. The Dukes will face Wisconsin in the first round.\n\nTeams/coaches\n\nWe'd like to provide a note for every team in the Big Dance, but we had to narrow it down to those with the most interesting tidbits -- some positive, some negative.
