        "text": "Brigham Young\n\nBASEBALL: Sophomore Jeff Stone pitched a complete nine-inning game Thursday as BYU defeated UNLV, 9-1, in the inaugural Mountain West Conference baseball game.Stone, now 4-2, surrendered six hits, gave up one unearned run and one walk in striking out three Rebels as BYU pulled even for the first time this season with a 10-10 record.\n\nStone received help from his teammates in the form of 16 hits, including a fourth-inning double by freshman Kainoa Obrey. Obrey's double opened the floodgates for a five-run, three-error fifth inning. Obrey was one of eight Cougars to get a hit in the victory. Co-captain Nate Mathis had three hits, including a lead-off triple in the third inning for BYU's initial run and a double in the fifth.\n\nSWIMMING/DIVING: The men's and women's diving teams are headed to Federal Way, Wash., to compete in the NCAA Zone E Qualifying Meet Friday and Saturday.\n\nEight women's spots are available, and five men's spots are up for grabs.\n\nBYU's divers dominated the Mountain West Conference Honors during the season. Four different divers were named the conference male/female diver-of-the-week for a total of nine selections. Senior All-American Rachelle Smith Kunkel led the way with five such honors, while freshman Scott Randall was named twice. Devan Porter and Aaron Russell each received weekly diving honors once. At the inaugural Mountain West Conference Championships Feb. 16-19, BYU divers captured four conference crowns (Women's 1M, 3M; Men's 1M, 3M). They also swept the post-season honors, with Kunkel being named the Female Diver-of-the-Year, and Porter receiving Male Diver-of-the-Year.\n\nDiving coach Keith Russell was also named the Diving Coach-of-the-Year for the third consecutive season and fourth time in his career.\n\nUtah Valley State College\n\nSOFTBALL: Lynette Hicks threw a one-hitter as the Wolverines upset defending national champion Central Arizona 2-0 in the nightcap of a twinbill.
