        "text": "Mountain West baseball will be featuring a game of Musical Chairs this weekend. The championship tournament features the top four teams in a double elimination round robin. With three games left and the top five teams all within 2 games of each other, one of those five teams will be left without a chair when the music stops.\n\nTwo teams have already been eliminated. San Diego State is five games out and UNLV has already finished their conference schedule with insufficient wins to capture the last spot.\n\nHeading into the weekend, Fresno State and New Mexico are tied for the top spot. If that condition were to persist after this week’s play, Fresno State holds the tiebreaker against the Lobos, and would finish first. Fresno will play against third place Air Force this week in Colorado Springs, and New Mexico plays fourth place (tied with Nevada) San Jose State in San Jose. Fourth place Nevada has the best draw of the weekend, playing against last place San Diego State at home in Reno, and they have a tiebreaker advantage against Air Force and San Jose State.\n\nNow, let’s look at some possible outcomes.\n\nGiven that these five teams are bunched tightly, it’s safe to say the talent levels on each team are pretty comparable. I would expect the series matching Fresno and Air Force, and New Mexico and San Jose would likely end up as 2-1 splits between the teams. Nevada at home certainly has a chance at sweeping SDSU, but the Aztecs have a trio of starters who are tough to hit against, and when they have good command, as they did two weeks ago when the Aztecs swept the Bulldogs, they can be difficult to beat. Therefore, the most likely outcome will be a 2-1 series, with an advantage for Nevada.\n\nFollowing are some permutations of the possible 2-1 series splits in each matchup.\n\nFresno 2-1 over AF\n\nNew Mexico 2-1 over SJSU\n\nNevada 2-1 over SDSU\n\nResult:\n\nFresno\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNevada\n\nAir Force\n\nFresno 2-1 over AF\n\nNew Mexico 2-1 over SJSU\n\nSDSU 2-1 over Nevada\n\nResult:\n\n1. Fresno\n\n2. New Mexico\n\n3. Air Force\n\n4. Nevada\n\nFresno 2-1 over AF\n\nSJSU 2-1 over New Mexico\n\nSDSU 2-1 over Nevada\n\nResult:\n\nFresno\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAir Force\n\nSan Jose State\n\nAir Force 2-1 over Fresno\n\nNew Mexico 2-1 over SJSU\n\nSDSU 2-1 over Nevada\n\nResult:\n\nNew Mexico\n\nFresno State\n\nAir Force\n\nNevada\n\nNote: Fresno and Air Force would have the same record and a 3-3 head-to-head. The second tiebreaker is the record against the team above them, New Mexico, against which both teams are 2-1. Next would be the team below in the standings, Nevada. Fresno is 3-0, the Falcons 2-4.\n\nAir Force 2-1 over Fresno\n\nNew Mexico 2-1 over SJSU\n\nNevada 2-1 over SDSU\n\nResult: Same as #4\n\nAir Force 2-1 over Fresno\n\nSJSU 2-1 over New Mexico\n\nNevada 2-1 over SDSU\n\nResult\n\nFresno State\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAir Force\n\nNevada\n\nNote: 3 way tie for first. Fresno is 3-0 against the team immediately below the tied teams, Nevada. New Mexico is 3-3, Air Force is 2-4.\n\nFresno 2-1 over Air Force\n\nSJSU 2-1 over New Mexico\n\nNevada 2-1 over SDSU\n\nResult:\n\nFresno State\n\nSJSU\n\nNevada\n\nAir Force\n\nNote: Wild! A 4 way tie for second. The rules aren’t very clear. First evaluation is the record against Fresno. SJSU was 4-2, New Mexico was 1-2, Air Force would be 2-4, and Nevada 0-3. SJSU should be second place. Next evaluation would be NM, AF, and Nevada against the second place team, SJSU. Nevada was 2-1, AF 4-2, and NM 2-4. That would make NM fifth, and leave Nevada and AF tied. Nevada won the matchup from AF 4-2, which would put them in third and the Falcons fourth. My logic might be wrong on this outcome, just hope it doesn’t happen.\n\nAir Force 2-1 over Fresno\n\nSJSU 2-1 over New Mexico\n\nSDSU 2-1 over Nevada\n\nResult:\n\nFresno State\n\nAir Force\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSJSU\n\nNote: 2 way tie for second. New Mexico was 1-2 against Fresno, and Air Force would be 3-3, Falcons taking second place.\n\nI won’t get into situations where teams sweep the series, it takes too much concentration and brain power, and I’m at my cabin looking out on the lake. Please comment below if you see any error in my analysis."
