        "text": "By Alan Snel, LVSportsBiz.com Publisher-Writer\n\nThe Mountain West Conference championship game between UNLV and Boise State at Allegiant Stadium will have the look of a modified UNLV home game with the UNLV and Rebels logos on the field Saturday.\n\nBut there will be some wrinkles.\n\nLVSportsBiz.com spoke with Javan Hedlund, MWC senior associate commissioner of external communications strategy, to find out how the Mountain West will stage the contest.\n\nWhen it comes to sponsors, Hedlund explained, UNLV’s normal advertisers like Star Nursey and Findlay will not have signage at the title game that starts at 12 noon.\n\nInstead, Mountain West’s sponsors like Gatorade and ZenWTR will have signage at the stadium.\n\nUNLV sponsors had the option to pay to be sponsors at the championship game, but none signed up, Hedlund said. Companies often have a budget cycle for sponsorships and may not have had funds to pay for a one-off football title game.\n\nAnd while UNLV is selling tickets for the MWC championship, the conference will hand out honorariums to both the Rebels and Boise State for their appearances in the title game.\n\nBoise State has an allotment of tickets that university can sell and use.\n\nUNLV typically spends about $350,000-$370,000 per home game to rent Allegiant Stadium from the Raiders.\n\nBut Saturday’s game expenses will be paid for by the conference, Hedlund said.\n\nThe Mountain West Conference football championship game is much different than when the conference pays UNLV to use the Thomas & Mack Center as a neutral court for its basketball tournament in March.\n\nSome conferences stage their football championship at a neutral site. But since the Mountain West Conference started its football championship game in 2013, the team with the best regular season record has hosted the game.\n\nMountain West Commissioner Gloria Nevarez will conduct the coin toss and the conference will have a stage after the game for an awards ceremony.\n\nThe MWC game at noon Saturday will follow the Pac-12 title game between Oregon and Washington at 5 PM Friday at Allegiant Stadium."
