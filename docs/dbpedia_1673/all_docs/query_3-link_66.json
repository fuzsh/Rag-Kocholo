That total is now the second-most in school history.\n\n• Utah State's 516 passing yards against New Mexico in 2018 are the second-most in school history.\n\n• Utah State's 39-36 loss at New Mexico in 1998 is its only triple-overtime game in school history and the Aggies have never played in an overtime game that went longer than three periods. In fact, USU has played just 13 overtime games in school history and two have been against New Mexico as the Aggies posted a 45-44 overtime home win against UNM in 2002.\n\n• New Mexico is Utah State's only opponent that it has played multiple overtime games against.\n\n• Utah State's eight forced turnovers vs. New Mexico in 1961 is tied for the most in school history, along with the eight turnovers it forced against Boise State in 2015, Idaho in 1971 and 1969, and San Diego State in 1968. USU's seven recovered fumbles against UNM in 1961 is a school record.\n\n• Utah State allowed just two first downs against New Mexico in 1953, which is tied for the school record, also doing so against Idaho in 1961.\n\n• Utah State's 470 rushing yards against New Mexico in 1960 are the second-most in school history, while its 337 rushing yards against UNM in 2013 rank as the 26th-most.\n\n• Utah State allowed New Mexico zero passing yards and no completions in 1954, both of which are tied for single-game school records.\n\n• Jordan Love's 448 passing yards against New Mexico in 2018 are the fifth-most in school history.\n\n• Jose Fuentes' 80-yard pass to Kevin Curtis against New Mexico in 2002 is tied for the 18th-longest pass play in school history, while Travis Cox's 79-yard pass to Barry Tolli against UNM in 2003 is tied for the 25th-longest pass play in school history.\n\n• Brad Bohn set a then-school record for points scored by a kicker with 18 against New Mexico in 1998, a record that was broken by Dominik Eberle. Bohn also tied the then-school record for field goals made in that game against the Lobos as he was 5-of-5 on field goals (37, 23, 23, 41, 33) and 3-for-3 on extra points. That record was also broken by Eberle.\n\nLAST MEETING vs. NEW MEXICO\n\nLOGAN, Utah - Utah State successfully orchestrated both a fake punt and fake field, the latter resulting in the go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter, as the Aggies scored the final 20 points in a 27-10 Mountain West win against New Mexico on Saturday, Nov. 5, 2022, on Merlin Olsen Field at Maverik Stadium.\n\nNew Mexico (2-7, 0-5 MW) was leading Utah State (4-5, 3-2 MW) 10-7 with 10:51 remaining in the third quarter when graduate senior PK Connor Coles lined up for a 23-yard field goal attempt. Once junior P/H Stephen Kotsanlee fielded the ball from sophomore LS Jacob Garcia, he wasted little time flipping the pigskin to Coles, who ran untouched into the end zone from six yards out, putting the Aggies on top 14-10.\n\nNot only did Coles score his first-career touchdown on the cold and rainy day, but he also booted a pair of field goals from 49 and 27 yards out, respectively, and made good on all three of his extra points as he tied his career-high with 15 points scored.\n\nKotsanlee also converted a first down on a fake punt as he rushed for 10 yards on a fourth-and-3 play from USU's own 41-yard line in the second quarter.\n\nUtah State finished the game converting all four of its fourth down attempts, which is a season high. USU was just 3-of-17 on third down, while New Mexico was 6-of-16.\n\nKotsanlee punted six times on the day for an average of 44.5 yards, including a long of 58. He also had one punt downed inside the 20-yard line.\n\nUtah State's defense also found the end zone as graduate senior S Hunter Reynolds returned a fumble 55 yards for a touchdown, giving the hosts a 27-10 lead with 3:00 left in the game.\n\nReynolds finished with a game-high 10 tackles as the Aggies limited the Lobos to just 258 yards of total offense – a season low for a USU opponent, which included just 42 passing yards. It was Reynolds second double-digit tackle outing of the season and the third of his career, and his second-career fumble recovery.\n\nJunior CB Jamie Nance recovered his second fumble in as many games on a muffed punt in the third quarter that led to Coles' 49-yard field goal to extend USU's lead to 17-10.\n\nThe Aggies' lone offensive touchdown came on their opening possession courtesy of a 38-yard pass from junior QB Cooper Legas to junior WR Terrell Vaughn, making it 7-0.\n\nLegas was 13-of-27 passing for 149 yards and the one touchdown as Utah State totaled 280 yards of total offense.
