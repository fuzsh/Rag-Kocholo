        "text": "The Wolf Pack baseball team will host the University of Nevada's first-ever Mountain West postseason tournament this week with the 2015 MW Baseball Championship, May 20-24, at Peccole Park.\n\nNo. 25 Nevada is the top-seeded team in the tournament and will be aiming for the conference-double after winning the first MW regular season title in program history. The Wolf Pack closed a stellar regular season with 41 wins - the most wins from a Nevada team since 1992 and the second-most in Pack history. Nevada (41-13, 22-7) will make its postseason debut on Thursday, May 21, in the 7 p.m. PT game. Nevada will play the lowest remaining seed from the first round.\n\nNevada's next home victory will be a historic one - its 500th all-time win at Peccole Park. The Wolf Pack is 499-238 (.677) since moving into William Peccole Park in 1988. Nevada is 22-4 at home this year.\n\nAll session passes for the MW Championships are $55 for adults and $25 for youth, seniors and students from participating universities with student ID. Single day tickets will be $20 for adults and $10 for youth, seniors and students. Tickets can be purchased by calling (775) 348-PACK. Fans can also visit the Lawlor Events Center Box Office or Peccole Park ticket booth. Gates will open two hours prior to the first game each day.\n\n\"We couldn't be more excited to be hosting the Mountain West Championship in our home park and in front of a home crowd,\" said head coach Jay Johnson. \"Peccole Park is a special place to us and it means a lot to be hosting a conference tournament here. We're looking forward to our first game Thursday night.\"\n\nThe MW Championship will get underway at 11 a.m. on Wednesday with No. 6 UNLV (24-29, 10-20) and No. 7 San Jose State (13-43, 6-24). The opening game is a single-elimination, play-in-game, while all other games are double-elimination contests. No. 3 Fresno State (29-26, 18-12) will play the winner of the play-in-game at 3 p.m., while No. 4 New Mexico (29-25, 17-13) and No. 5 Air Force (22-27, 11-17) will play at 7 p.m.\n\nTop-seeded Nevada and second-seeded San Diego State (35-20, 19-10) will make their tournament debuts on Thursday. The Aztecs will play at 3 p.m. while the Pack will play the lowest remaining seed at 7 p.m. The championship game is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday, and if necessary, at 1 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nLast season, Nevada won three straight elimination games en route to placing third at the MW Championship in Las Vegas. The Pack went 1-2 in the 2012 MW Championship in Fresno, Calif., in the first MW Championship in program history.\n\nFollowing the conference tournament, Nevada will look to become the fifth team in program history to advance to NCAA postseason competition. The Pack qualified for NCAA Regionals in 1994, 1997, 1999 and 2000. The 2015 NCAA baseball selection show is scheduled for 9 a.m. PT on Monday, May 25, on ESPNU."
