        "text": "FRIDAY, JANUARY 29, 2010- \"Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future.\" Physicist Niels Bohr\n\n*********** I just purchased \"A Fire To Win\" a biography of Woody Hayes. It will be my first read on Hayes and its due to you. My only knowledge of Woody is what I have seen on TV and it wasn't a good view of him and so I had a bad impression but at one of your clinics you had very kind words and so I decided to read up on him. I hope it's a good read.\n\nKevin Rivas,\n\nMontebello, California\n\nWoody Hayes was a great coach. Yes, he was a character. Maybe \"complex\" would be a better way of putting it. It is possible - popular, nowadays - to define him by a couple of hot-tempered acts, but those oughtn't be allowed to overshadow the enormous accomplishments of an illustrious career. There is an awful lot of coaching wisdom to be gained from learning about Coach Hayes. Yes, he would have to be considered somewhat eccentric, especially in comparison with today's buttoned-down, colorless CEO-type coaches, but anyone setting out to write a book dedicated to making him out to be a monster would soon run out of material and adverse witnesses. It would be an awfully thin book.\n\n*********** John Dowd, a friend and a long-time Double Wing coach, has just been hired as head coach at Spencerport, New York, just outside Rochester.\n\nSpencerport, a AA (largest classification) school, was 1-7 last fall, and has gone 11-32 over the past five seasons. Coach Dowd will be the Rangers' fourth coach since Spencerport restored its football program in 1997.\n\nAt Oakfield-Alabama High School, Coach Dowd's teams went 50-12 trom 2003-08, winning four Genesee Region titles, and Section championships in 2006 and 2004. His 2006 Hornets made it to the state title game.\n\nCoach Dowd's teams have been honored five times by the Rochester Chapter of Football Officials as Sportsmanship Team of the Year. He was three times Genesee Region Coach of the Year and was twice named his section's Coach of the Year.\n\nBefore coaching at Oakfield-Alabama, Coach Dowd was offensive coordinator at Rochester Eastridge HS, and before that was on the staff of longtime Double Wing coach Mike Johnston at Corning, New York West High School.\n\nAfter spending the 2009 season coaching outside linebackers at Division III Brockport State, Coach Dowd says he's happy to return to high school coaching.\n\n\"It was a great learning experience,\" Coach Dowd said about his year at Brockport. \"I learned a lot about football, but I also learned that high school is the level I fit best. I really missed the whole Friday night high school thing.\"\n\n(I should add that John Dowd is hard-core, joining me, Brad Knight and Gabe McCown to work with Greg Koenig and his kids at their summer camp in Beloit, Kansas.)\n\n*********** Know any American names with a ü or an ö in them? How about an æ... or an ä... or an ø... or an å...?\n\nI didn't think so. Those are all letters used in places like Germany and Sweden and Denmark, places from which many Americans have come. But when they arrived here, they became Americans. They learned English, and they changed those letters to ones used in our alphabet. (And on our typewriters.)\n\nSo why are sports writers tripping all over themselves to spell Pierre Garcon's name \"GARÇON,\" with that little hook under the \"c\" (it's called a cedille)?\n\nYes, yes, I know - it's French, and it's the way his name's spelled in his family's native Haiti.\n\nNice touch, and all that, what with the tragic earthquake in Haiti, but how far are we prepared to go with this? Are we really ready to start letting immigrants use Greek or Cyrillic or Arabic or Hebrew to spell their names?\n\nAre all those politically-correct sportswriters willing to honor Americans of Hispanic descent by starting all their questions with an upside-down question mark?\n\n*********** Hi Hugh--\n\nGlad to see your getting your clinic schedule organized and hope to see you in Providence in April.\n\nLoved the News section yesterday, especially the quotes you gave to coach looking to stop the DW. When done correctly the only thing I have seen that stops our offense is better personnel that is well coached or our own coaching decisions that stop ourselves.\n\nI applauded the suggestion from the coach that it is time for you put out a third edition of the Gold Standard Double Wing. Not that you don't have anything else to do or need more suggestions lol. Without question the best coaching video I have ever seen and I have seen most of them is the first Double Wing Gold Standard video you did it is today an instant classic as they say. I really believe that it is time for number three - there is so much new material from the WildCat to the HockeyStick to your updated passing game that DW coaches would gobble up. Anyway I thought it was a great suggestion especially given all the knock off stuff out there and it is time for more of the real thing.\n\nAll the Best!!\n\nJack\n\nPS: I hope the coaches out there realize the information you put is out is not just clinic talk but has actually been done in games and proven to work.\n\n*********** I'm watching a basketball game between UCLA, in its classic light blue uniforms, and Oregon, in its white uniforms with pink numbers. And pink shoes. Dear God. More awareness-raising.\n\nLook. Breast cancer is awful. I wouldn't want any woman - or her family - to have to go through it.\n\nBut, jeez - is there anybody in the United States of America who still needs to be made aware that there is such a disease as breast cancer?\n\nCan we maybe take a short break from pink everything?\n\n*********** Dear Hugh,\n\nDon't forget the dirt tracks of Indiana that have produced Tony Stewart, Jeff Gordon, Ryan Newman, John Andretti, et. al.\n\nTyler Sellhorn\n\nFort Wayne, Indiana\n\nYeah,\n\nI guess Indiana - south of Indianapolis, where they speak with a drawl - might qualify. (I'm surprised I haven't had my but kicked by the dirt track people in Maryland and Pennsylvania.)\n\n*********** When a guy goes out and gets drunk and causes an accident, what usually happens? Why, they take his license away, right?\n\nAnd then what happens? Why, he still drives, right?\n\nSo a couple years ago, a guy who lives not far from me went hunting inside Olympic National Park, in the northwesternmost part of Washington state. Inside the park live herds of Roosevelt Elk, majestic creatures which can go upwards of 1,000 pounds. Not supposed to hunt there, fella, but what the hell - the guy hunted down a trophy bull, lured it within range and killed it with a bow and arrow.\n\nHe field dressed it and packed it out over several days - we're talking a lot of meat, guys - until he was caught by Washington Fish and Wildlife officers while in possession of the animal's head and cape.\n\nSo he was found guilty just the other day, and the judge really slammed him. Hard. Placed the guy on probation. Ooooh. Fined him $2,500. Guy'll never pay it.\n\nAnd took away his hunting license for three years!\n\nWow. Loss of his license! That'll keep him from hunting.\n\n*********** Good Morning Hugh!\n\nI can’t tell you enough how much I enjoy reading your Tues-Fri rants! The ESPN article by Ohlmeyer was insightful! Especially to me since I am a friend of Mike Leach from his days @ Iowa Wesleyan in Mt. Pleasant, IA. I think when the dust settles Mike’s reputation will rebound and he will become a quirky coach with an offense that stupefies DC’s at whatever level he lands in coaching.\n\nHe’s fun to be around and you would enjoy spending time with him…..his take on kids is a lot like most of us old guys! If you want to work, do things right and win, you might have a spot in our program. He’s no nonsense, let’s get to work kind of coach.\n\nOn another note, the coach from I suspect, Illinois who wants your help in defending the DW must be stupid! You gave him more to ponder in defending the DW than any other coach in the past has received from you and he doesn’t even send along a thank you! And he’s a DC? At a big school in IL? From my experience, most of the coaches in Illinois, who are at successful programs have little time for us! I think DW coaches in Illinois would agree!\n\nNow that I’m retired, I’m relegated (by my wife) to cleaning out my stuff! I finally got around to doing just that a couple of weekends ago! Yeah, I’ve purged all my football files……except the DW stuff! It took me a while because I had to stop and read the countless notes I’ve taken over the years from your clinics or the clinic presentations of mine about the DW. I even read over notes Jack T has shared with me from your Providence clinics over the years!\n\nThen there is the video’s. I still have every tape and DVD. Plus, game footage of our DW at Keokuk. Playbooks, all editions. I’ve kept them all along with some Fly stuff from Mark Speckman and Zone Fly from Bryon Hamilton @ Foothill, CA. All great stuff…..\n\nNot sure why I’ve kept all this stuff except to say that your DW stuff, to me is like the HOLY GRAIL of ‘POWER FOOTBALL”. God I miss the day when we trucked people with the DW! Maybe the guy from Illinois could call me…..I surely could convince him to change to the DW!\n\nSimple, become a head coach…..run the DW, your defense will get better too!\n\nCan’t wait to hear from you every Tuesday and Friday!\n\nIt Takes A Set!\n\nDon Capaldo\n\nKeokuk, Iowa (Coach Capaldo, who has coached in both Iowa and Illinois, was one of my earliest converts to the Double Wing while at Keokuk High School. Actually, although I did invite him to the Chicago Clinic, the ingrate was not from Illinois. I guess I should have just told him to f-off, the way I used to. It was nice to see Ohlmeyer point out that there were definitely two sides, which most sports fans realized even if ESPN didn't. When you're a conservative, you expect to see \"your\" side of a story get buried, but this handling of the issue by ESPN was so unfair to Mike Leach - and those of us who have do deal with the Craig Jameses in our daily dealings as coaches - that as I mentioned, it was borderline jury tampering. I mean, if you know anything about jury selection, you know there are going to be people who don't know squat about sports who thanks to Mike Patrick have already conjured up mental pictures of a \"child\" being \"confined\" in a \"shed\" as \"punishment\" for having a concussion.HW)\n\n*********** Imagine..\n\n(a) The final game of the World Series goes into extra innings. The two teams flip a coin to decide who bats first. Team A wins the toss and chooses to bat first, and in the top of the 10th, Team A scores. Game over. Team A wins the World Series.\n\n(b) The final game of the NBA finals goes into overtime. Team A wins the coin toss and takes the ball in. Team A works the ball in to its big man, who's fouled in the act of shooting. The big man (not Shaq) misses the first free throw, but makes the second. Game Over. Team A wins the NBA title.\n\n(c) The final game of the World Cup goes into a shootout. Team A wins the toss and goes first. Its first shooter makes his goal. Game over. Team A wins the World Cup.\n\n(d) The NFC championship game goes into overtime. Team A wins the coin toss and elects to receive. Team A drives to within field goal range and - NFL kickers being accurate on roughly 80 per cent of their attempts - makes the field goal. Game over. Team A wins the NFL championship and goes on to the Super Bowl.\n\nAll fantasy, right? Couldn't happen. Not in sports, where both sides are entitled to a \"fair go.\" Every American kid grows up knowing that.\n\nExcept that last Sunday, (d) actually happened! And amazingly, so caught up is everybody in the excitement of the Saints' finally going to the Super Bowl that they're conveniently overlooking the simple fact that the Vikings never got their turn at bat. The Vikings - and America's football fans - were wronged.\n\nI'm telling you - one of these days the Super Bowl itself is going to be decided the same way the Saints-Vikings game was - by the toss of a coin - and there'll be hell to pay. Big Football will be, to say the least, greatly embarrassed. And all because the high and mighty NFL, which believes it created the earth in six days and then on the seventh gave us football, can't bring itself to admit that football is played on other days than Sunday, and that those people who play on Fridays and Saturdays (and in the case of the MAC, Wednesdays and Thursdays) might actually have a good idea or two of their own.\n\n*********** Tom Grady, honorary \"Mayor\" of Cypress Hollow, South Carolina, is a Black Lion, a veteran of the Battle of Ong Thanh. By the most amazing of coincidences, he grew up \"two doors down\" from my wife in Abington, Pennsylvania. He has a razor-sharp wit, which he annually puts to use in coming up with one of the more unusual Super Bowl pools you're likely to come across...\n\nhttp://www.coachwyatt.com/SuperBowlPool.pdf\n\n*********** The abortion (sorry - \"right to life\") folks and the ardent feminists are walking around with permanent wedgies at the thought that Focus on the Family is being allowed to spend $2.5 million on a Super Bowl commercial on CBS. The commercial stars Tim Tebow and his mom, and it evidently tells about the time Tim's mom and dad were on a mission to the Philippines while Mrs. Tebow (yes, they actually were married) was pregnant with their fifth child. While there, Mrs. Tebow was diagnosed with amoebic dysentery, and knowing that the medicines she was taking threatened her unborn baby, doctors advised an abortion. She ignored the advice and on August 14, 1987, gave birth to little Tim Tebow.\n\nWow. The geeks are going wild. CBS can't allow this to go on! I actually heard one right-to-lifer whining on TV that this video would deprive young women of their \"reproductive rights.\"\n\nAnother harpy calls the ad \"divisive.\" Say, \"divisive?\"\n\nHow, exactly, would this ad divide people? What - there are creeps out there who think Tim Tebow should never have been born?\n\nThis ad doesn't deprive anyone of any \"right.\" And it isn't the slightest bit \"divisive.\" What it is is scary as hell to people who think that unborn babies are just globs of tissue, and don't seem to believe that a woman's \"right to choose\" includes the choice to have the baby.\n\nBut, hey, right-to-lifers - you got a nice, heart-warming abortion story you'd like to tell us? We'd love to hear it. Hahahaha. It'll cost you $2.5 million.\n\n*********** Nude photos of Portland Trail Blazer have been on the Internet for a couple of days now. Evidently, he sent them to a \"lady friend\" a year or so ago. After word of the pictures go out, he immediately apologized and said he's \"matured\" since the incident. Holy sh--. Does that mean he's grown since then?\n\n*********** I'm blessed to know Mike Lude, one of the co-inventors of the Delaware Wing-T, one-time head coach at Colorado State, former athletic director at Kent State, Washington and Auburn, and long-time member of the NCAA Football Rules Committee. I thought you might enjoy a bit of his wisdom, from his book, \"Walking the Line\", published in 2004.\n\nI totally believe that those involved in the leadership of intercollegiate athletics are held to a higher standard. They should be held to a higher standard and conduct themselves with the knowledge of that standard.\n\nIn my view, anybody who says he or she shouldn't be or doesn't want to be a role model shouldn't be a teacher.\n\nWhen I was athletic director at Kent State, Washington and Auburn, I made a point of meeting personally with each squad and their coaches in every sport once a year and talked about this responsibility. I made it an absolute must to go over the rules and regulations and the forms the athletes had to sign for the NCAA.\n\nI would read the rules and emphasize my philosophy and beliefs. I emphasized that each of them would be identified as an athlete the rest of their lives. I told them, \"Good or bad, you will carry that label.\"\n\nRight now I may be retired, but if I go out and misbehave - whatever way - the media will refer to me as \"former athletic director at the University of Washington.\"\n\nWhen coaches and athletes said they didn't want to be considered role models and protested, \"I'm on my own time,\" I had a standard response: \"You are until you get into trouble.\"\n\nMike sent along the following column written for the Green Valley (Arizona) News http://www.gvnews.com/sports/ by his good friend Corky Simpson, retired sports columnist and sports editor of the Tucson Citizen. It's reprinted with Corky's permission.\n\nTo protect football players' heads, the people in charge of the sport had better start using theirs.\n\nCongress would be only too happy to turn it into a game of touch and put the touch on taxpayers in the process, most likely.\n\nHearings have already begun in Washington, and the National Football League has asked for players and former players to consider becoming brain-donors in the name of research.\n\nBut before Congress outlaws tackling and football becomes unrecognizable -- and unwatchable -- some fundamental changes need to be made in the sport.\n\nStarting with the Wing-T would be a good idea.\n\nIn addition to being the most exciting and cerebral offensive formation ever invented, the Wing-T promotes and in fact relies upon blocking with the shoulder and not the head.\n\nIn other words, no blocking with the face-guard or helmet, either of which can cause devastating brain-related injuries.\n\nTrap-blocking, encouraging a defender to rush in and grab the shadow of a ball-carrier and general deception rather than helmet-to-helmet warfare, are trademarks of the Wing-T.\n\nThe Wing-T became a national phenomenon after it was developed in the early 1950s by the late Davey Nelson at the University of Delaware. One of his assistants, Mike Lude, carried the tradition of this great offense to Colorado State when he became head coach there.\n\nCoach Lude, who later became athletic director at the University of Washington and at Auburn, lives now in Tucson.\n\n\"It's a great offense,\" Mike says. \"It's still used in many, many high schools and I think it should be brought back to the college campus.\"\n\nIn his 2004 book, \"Walking The Line,\" Lude said the offense caught on like wildfire when he and Nelson invented it. \"Forrest Evashevski, the Iowa coaching guru, wanted the Wing-T and eventually won a national championship with it,\" Lude said.\n\n\"Paul Dietzel of LSU couldn't wait to learn its intricacies. Ditto for Frank Broyles at Arkansas and Eddie Robinson at Grambling.\"\n\nAra Parsheghian at Notre Dame did pretty well with it, too.\n\nThe Wing-T philosophy is keyed to the anticipation of certain adjustments it forces on the defense because of the positioning of the wing back (to the left or right).\n\nIt is a four-back system that forces the secondary to play three-deep coverage because of the passing possibilities.\n\nOK, what's all that got to do with head injuries?\n\nWell, the Wing-T utilizes T-formation offense with single-wing blocking. That is, traps and double-teams and lead blocking in which\n\nthe shoulder -- not the helmet or face guard -- takes out the enemy.\n\nAn occasional shoulder bruise (or at worst, a separation) is nowhere near as bad as a concussion. You don't get dementia late in life from a sore shoulder.\n\nAnd let's take a look at the helmet. This equipment is wonderfully put together with the emphasis on safety, but but it has become a weapon. The modern helmet fits so well, cushioned around the noggin with air bags and suspension straps, that it gives the wearer a false sense of security.\n\nRisks are taken that shouldn't be.\n\nWhy go to the trouble of executing a shoulder block, which requires concentration and dexterity as well as physical ability, when you can just stick a helmet on your opponent?\n\nUnfortunately, from peewee football on through high school and into college, some kids are encouraged to block with anything BUT the shoulder pads.\n\nSo, why did we get away from the Wing-T?\n\nBecause the National Football League is a passing circus and since it's the highest level of football, the game we watch on Sunday, there's a natural trickle-down. College boosters accustomed to watching the NFL demand more passing. College coaches get fired when they don't pass enough.\n\nThe Wing-T, on the other hand, requires a balance between the running game and passing. That's one of its fascinations.\n\nBut football at all levels has become grass-basketball. Pass, pass, pass. The only surprise is whether it'll be a long pass or a short pass.\n\nAnd there's no shoulder blocking in pass-protection. It's about putting your face in the defender's chest. And grabbing and holding his jersey, if you can get away with it.\n\nSince it was first discovered in football's antiquity that the sport was better played by large, thick-shouldered sons of iron mongers, farmers and other heavy laborers, it's been a game of brain and brawn.\n\nThe Wing-T offense puts the emphasis on brain -- and protects it much better than all-out passing attacks.\n\nCongress will be only too happy to ruin football as we know it, if something isn't done about cutting down on concussions leading to dementia.\n\nFootball headgear should be constantly studied and where possible, improved. But that's not the only answer to the problem of head injuries.\n\nWe've got to get back to fundamental football, even in the NFL, and emphasize the block as it was originally intended: a technique that requires striking the opponent with the shoulder, not the head.\n\nThe Wing-T formation won't end all concussions. Players can get their bells rung by crashing into goal posts or by slipping in the tunnel on the way to the field and banging their heads on concrete.\n\nBut going back to the future and encouraging the Wing-T would help enormously.\n\nTUESDAY, JANUARY 26, 2010- \"The leaders of our firm should never ask anyone to do anything they are unwilling to do themselves. The leader exists for the benefit of the firm, not the firm for the benefit of the leader.\" C. William Pollard, former CEO, ServiceMaster\n\nATLANTA COACH WYATT CLINIC: SATURDAY, FEB 27- HILTON GARDEN INN ATLANTA AIRPORT (SAME AS LAST YEAR)...\n\nCHICAGO COACH WYATT CLINIC: SATURDAY MARCH 13 - HILTON GARDEN INN MIDWAY AIRPORT (SAME AS LAST YEAR)\n\nFOR MORE INFO - CLINICS\n\n*********** Apparently a lot of other people joined me in writing to Don Ohlmeyer, ESPN's onbudsman (think of that position as the spokesman for the viewers) about the despicable job ESPN did in \"covering\" the recent Craig-and-Adam James and Texas A & M vs Mike Leach debacle.\n\nHe said it brought ESPN six times the letters and e-mails of any other sports issue all year.\n\nAnd Ohlmeyer, to his credit, agrees that ESPN did a horrible job of (1) ignoring the Texas Tech-Michigan State game while yacking about the Leach situation, and (2) being totally one-sided.\n\nOhlmeyer noted that disgusting comment by Mike Patrick (whose regular broadcast buddy Craig James was pulled off the game when the whole situation erupted) to the effect that poor Adam James \"was punished for having a concussion,\" while totally failing to acknowledge that by many accounts, young James was a spoiled brat and Dad Craig was a highly intrusive parent.\n\nIt's a long read, but it's worth it\n\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=ohlmeyer_don&id=4844048\n\n*********** Nice feature on Samoa and its leading export - football players - on CBS 60 Minutes last week.\n\nIf you aren't aware, American Samoa, with maybe 60,000 people, has an enormous number of players in the NFL.\n\nThere are many reasons why this tiny land in the South Pacific is such a signiticant factor in our sport: First of all, Samoans - all Pacific Islanders for that matter - tend to be big people... Theirs is a warrior culture. They are not taught, as our little boys are, that fighting is bad... Samoan kids are not strangers to hard work. They do not spend a lot of time in their bedrooms playing video games... They are obedient and respectful of their elders.\n\nAnd, in a great article in the New Zealand Herald, Oscar Knightly, an islander himself, writes, there is pride and their is shame...\n\n\"There are probably fewer than half a million Samoans in the world. In Samoan culture, the individual is less important than the group. When something happens to one of us, it happens to all of us. When one of us does something good, we all bask in the reflected glory. When one of us does something bad, we equally feel the shame. When one of us is suffering, we all suffer.\"\n\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10601202&pnum=0\n\nShame, of course, is something that our culture did away with sometime since the 1960s, in our determination not to be \"judgemental.\"\n\n(To give them their due, there are also a lot of Tongans - from the South Pacific Kingdom of Tonga - playing football as well, many of them having been introduced to the game by Mormon missionaries. It is therefore no coincidence that BYU and Utah have had a number of outstanding players of Tongan descent. And New Zealand's All Blacks, perennially one of the world's best rugby teams, have numerous native Maori players as well as players from other Pacific Islands. The 60 Minutes show, by the way, showed young Samoan players doing the haka, a dance which we were led to believe is a part of their culture, but which actually seems to be totally Maori in origin and only recently adopted by other Pacific cultures. If that's wrong, I welcome proof.)\n\n*********** According to a Wall Street Journal study of four recent broadcasts, and similar estimates by researchers, the average amount of time the ball is in play on the field during an NFL game is about 11 minutes.\n\nIn other words, if you tally up everything that happens between the time the ball is snapped and the play is whistled dead by the officials, there's barely enough time to prepare a hard-boiled egg. In fact, the average telecast devotes 56% more time to showing replays.\n\nSo what do the networks do with the other 174 minutes in a typical broadcast? Not surprisingly, commercials take up about an hour. As many as 75 minutes, or about 60% of the total air time, excluding commercials, is spent on shots of players huddling, standing at the line of scrimmage or just generally milling about between snaps. In the four broadcasts The Journal studied, injured players got six more seconds of camera time than celebrating players. While the network announcers showed up on screen for just 30 seconds, shots of the head coaches and referees took up about 7% of the average show.\n\nIf you think the networks are a little too fond of cheerleaders, you may be mistaken: In these broadcasts, only two networks showed cheerleaders at all. And when they did, they were only on camera for an average of three seconds. \"We make it a point to get Dallas cheerleaders on, but otherwise, it's not really important,\" says Fred Gaudelli, NBC's Sunday Night Football producer. \"If we're doing the Jets, I couldn't care less.\"\n\n*********** Coach: I was looking through an article of yours that was located at the direct snap website and you were writing about the VMI \"Wildcat\" and mentioned that you had experimented with what you called the Wildcat I.\n\nWhat can you tell me about those experiments? Alignments, timing, trouble-shooting etc. We ran your offense out of your Wildcat with a lot of success last year, and we absolutely love the direct snap approach. Also, we do have a kid next year that fits the mold of an I-formation tailback. I was hoping that your Wildcat I would be a logical step for us, because we want to be able to maintain our double-wing/10-gap front.\n\nOne of the things I've scribbled with and repped just a couple of times has been using \"C\" blocking at the point of attack and using the B back (our stud) to widen and call it something like 86-C. I recall that at last year's Chicago clinic you mentioned briefly looking at either a 64 or 84 Trap if my memory serves me correctly.\n\nBy the way I was thrilled with the Jets win vs. San Diego for no other reason than a power running team beat arguably the most athletic team in the NFL. What was even better for me was that our kids have fallen in love with the power running game and 3 of them came to my room at separate times this past Monday commenting on how they were pulling hard for the Jets...because they choose to pound it out on the ground!\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nJeff Degner\n\nHead Football Coach\n\nRiver Valley High School\n\nThree Oaks, Michigan\n\nCoach,\n\nFunny that you bring this up, because after having a fair amount of success running Wildcat the last four games of this past season, I've been giving a LOT of thought to this, and I plan to make it a focus of my clinics this year.\n\nAs you know, in my Wildcat I normally position my two \"QB's\" next to each other, \"splitting the ball.\" Except that they're seldom two QBs - they're usually a QB and a B Back, and depending on what I want to run, I have to move the B-Back to one side or the other.\n\nGoing to this \"Cat-eye\" formation (maybe I'd better register this before someone in the NFL gets any bright ideas) has its advantages. The B-Back doesn't have to declare a side, and either back is now capable of running almost any play to either side. If the B-Back is not a good ball-handler, it puts all the snap work in the hands of the QB. It's quite simple to deploy the B-Back or send him in motion either way to get him outside, or into an option-pitch relationship, or just into a better blocking position. (It's also easy to send the QB in motion as well as the B-Back.)\n\nThere's an awful lot you can do without having to do a thing with our terminology or blocking. It's all in place.\n\nPlay action has great potential.\n\nThere is the ability to go unbalanced and still have a very strong shortside game.\n\nAnd those who seem taken by the allure of option football like moths drawn to a flame will like messing with it. Sure, it'll take a lot of their practice time from them, but what the hell. (Actually, though, a straight-ahead wedge play with the QB riding the B-Back and reading people coming off the playside edge does appear to have some potential, although you would have to control backside pursuit.)\n\nThe ability to G-Block to both sides is a must. No problem for most of us - this originated as the \"down\" play with the Delaware Wing-T, from which my system derives, and it's been a foundation of my system from Day One, but it is where I differ from a lot of Double Wings that don't teach G-blocking as a part of their game.\n\nThis was made for \"G\" and variations from it.\n\nOf course C-Blocking is essential, but most people already have it in place, and that is how you'd have to run your \"powers\" with your wingbacks carrying. You may need a TE on the backside to shoeshine (cut off) because it might be hard for the B-Back to get to the line in time to check block.\n\nIf we ran a 64-84 trap it would be best run by the QB, with the backside wingback going in motion playside.\n\nA few immediate disadvantages of the Cat-eye are (1) you lose the deception of the snap possibly going to one or the other back, (2) your B-Back is no longer in a good kick-out position for power plays (leaving you the option of using \"G\" blocking at the Point of attack on all powers, or having the backside wingback do it; (3) you lose the quick direct snap to the B-Back on a wedge.\n\nI've included a video I assembled a few years ago for showing at clinics - before Nevada started making a lot of noise with its \"pistol.\"\n\nhttp://www.coachwyatt.com/singlewingnovelties/singlewingnovelties.mov\n\nIt's really good stuff. There are a few clips of Penn from the late 1950s and there's one from UCLA in the 1950s, but most of the plays are Princeton in the mid-60's running its classic unbalanced single wing, with stacked backs - Cat-eye or Pistol, if you will. In fact, this was about the same time that the veer was coming into play, and you can see one play that either anticipated the veer or was inspired by it. Damn shame that that was the single-wing's swan song at Princeton, because I think they were onto something.\n\nIn my case, I have had the two Cat-eye backs a yard or so closer to the line than Princeton, and I'm usually balanced - but not always - and I usually have two tight ends - but not always - and I usually have two wingbacks - but not always.\n\nIf for no other reason, this stuff is VERY useful in case you run into anyone who thinks brilliant football ideas spring spontaneously from the brains of today's coaches.\n\n*********** Ben Kotwica, Jets' special teams assistant, is a former Army football player who got into coaching after fulfilling his service commitment. He tells how his military service prepared him for coaching...\n\nKotwica believes his military experience serves him well in the NFL. In Iraq, he took part in Operation Iraqi Freedom II, serving as a platoon lea! der, an Apache helicopter pilot, a Battalion executive officer and a company commander. He flew more than 1,000 combat hours and earned a bronze star, among other citations.\n\n\"I think because of my background - going to West Point, being captain of that (football) team, then going into the military and being an air mission commander and flying Apaches - standing up and fronting a group and presenting, whether it be a mission brief or a game plan in football, is something I am very comfortable with,\" he said.\n\n\"Not everybody can go up and stand in front of a group, especially the kind we have here in the National Football League. I mean these are guys where this is their profession. You've got to have a knowledge and an expertise and the ability to communicate in order to effectively get the game plan across and sell that, 'Hey guys, this is the way that we can and will implement our plan and win football games.' \"\n\n*********** And on the same subject of how military service can affect a man for the good...Writes Mark Leinovich in the New York Times, Scott Brown lives by what he calls “Army values,” instilled 30 years ago when he joined the Massachusetts National Guard.\n\n*********** Internet Wisdom...\n\nAfter Monday and Tuesday even the calendar says W T F\n\n*********** Coach, I am very intrigued by the double wing, but I do not see lt much at the varsity level here in (------) . I do not see it in college either which makes me wonder if I could be successful at the bigger HS level. I am an I formation team and we run a ton of power.\n\nHi Coach- It certainly can be successful at the big school level, and it has been.\n\nA lot of things have to come together to make it so:\n\n(1) Recognition by the head coach and his staff that something has to be done and going along with the crowd is not the answer\n\n(2) Total commitment by the head coach and his staff - his entire staff - to installing it right and fussing over the little details and defending it against naysayers\n\n(3) Total buy-in by the kids\n\n(4) A good job of selling it to the community\n\n(5) A supportive administration\n\n(Notice I didn't mention great talent. Talent always helps, but without the other factors, it won't make any difference how talented you are.)\n\nWhat usually brings those things in line with each other is a program that has been down, and is willing to go along with anything that will help it's kids be successful.\n\nIt's rare to find all those things line up, which is why Double Wing teams tend to be scattered around.\n\nYou will never see it at the college level - except maybe D-III - because for one reason coaches are looking to move up and running something old-fashioned is a dead-end track.\n\n*********** I read someplace where somebody is calling the Saints' \"Who dat\"( t'ink gonna beat dem Saints) cheer \"racist.\"\n\nGimme a f--king break. Somebody needs to reset their racism detector.\n\nSeems to me I recall hearing people at LSU chanting, \"Who dey t'ink gonna beat dem Tigahs?\"\n\nNot that a takeoff on black dialect (notice how, unlike Senator Harry Reid, I didn't say \"Negro dialect?\") would be racist, anyhow, but I suspect this was imitation Cajun English, wid all da lack of aitches (h's) common when French-speakers, as Cajuns are, speak English.\n\n***********I have a sneaking suspicion that at least one member of the Saints will be playing the Super Bowl for fun. Or, at most, for a ring on his finger.\n\nBased on some of the shots those guys took at Brett Favre - including that late, low dive into Favre's legs by one Bobby McCray - I think a healthy fine or two might be in order. I can't imagine the league office will let it pass.\n\nI'm not one for putting dresses on quarterbacks, but when punters get better protection than quarterbacks, the league is headed for trouble.\n\n*********** Much to the NBA's relief, Steve Nash and Chris Paul edged out Tracy McGrady for starting guard spots on the West team in the NBA All-Star game. McGrady has appeared in only six games this season, and has basically been in exile, working out on his own, but since the NBA has prostituted itself (what a surprise!) by allowing fans to select the All-Star teams, he was in close contention for a spot. Alan Iverson, who has played in only 19 games this season, for some strange reason remains a fan favorite, and so he will start at guard for the East.\n\nCharles Barkley has already suggested that Iverson should do the right thing and not show up for the game.\n\n*********** NASCAR is struggling to stop the decline of its TV ratings, which are in free fall.\n\nNASCAR and its millionaire drivers share a problem with other sports, which - in my opinion - were all a lot better when they were played by guys who loved the game, and would have played it for free.\n\nIn my judgment, the sport has become too sanitized. No more swearing. No more grabbing a tire iron and chasing after the SOB who cut you off and knocked you into the wall.\n\nProbably more other sport I can think of, the players and the core of fans are disconnected. Good ole boys turn out for an afternoon of racing and wind up watching guys who look and talk like executives and can't say three words without getting a sponsor's name in there.\n\nNow, I feel a sense of nostalgia for the good old days of auto racing, so as a favor to the folks at NASCAR (no charge to them, although I wouldn't mind seeing my \"stones\" logo on the hoods of a couple of cars), I offer a few suggestions...\n\nStart with requiring guys ether to be born and raised in the South, or to spend at least four years driving on dirt tracks somewhere in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky or Virginia.\n\nGo back to racin' - in places like Rockingham and North Wilkesboro.\n\nRequire drivers with fancy, citified names to change them to names on an approved list, such as Junior, Buck, Cale, Dale, Ned, Sonny, Darrell, Rusty and - of course - Richard.\n\nFinally - let 'em fight.\n\n*********** The job by the broadcast crew doing the East-West game Saturday was easily the worst I've ever heard. They all thought they were draft experts, and kept ripping the plays. They were a generic voice named Bob Wischusen, former QB Brian Griese, and draft nerd Todd McShay, a Mel Kiper wannabe.\n\nThey couldn't just call the game. They had to take over. They had to become the show themselves. And they were harshly critical. They had to evaluate every player in NFL terms, which in the case of this collection of players generally meant telling us why they weren't going to make it. So who gives a crap? STFU and call the game.\n\nHow far has this once-great game fallen, from the days when it was played on the West Coast and every college senior coveted an invitation to play in it? It's played in Orlando now, but judging by all the empty seats, fans apparently haven't gotten to word and thought it was still being played in San Francisco. What a shame - proceeds from the game are supposed to go to Shriners' Hospitals, but without the TV rights, they probably didn't cover expenses.\n\n*********** A writer recently told of sitting down in front of the TV with his young son and trying to explain the game of football to him. He said between the incessant close-ups of this player and that, to shots of coaches on the sideline, to face-painted fans in the stands to cuts from one camera to another during the actual plays themselves, he finally gave up. He said that not once was he able to show the kid that football is played on a rectangular field.\n\n*********** HI Coach Hope you and Connie had a wonderful year. I see you are beginning your clinic season. Looking forward to it!!\n\nProbably get to see you in either Phila, or Providence. Incidentally, the clinic dvd's from a few years back were really great. I know that coaching and attending to family is very time consuming ( I have 13 Grandchildren) but the information you could share is gratly appreciated and extremely helpful. There is so much nonsense being sold re: the doublewing, your \"Gold Standard\" would be greatly appreciated!!\n\nFred Gallagher\n\nWest Islip, New York\n\n*********** Good morning, Coach.\n\nHope you had a great weekend. The boys and I enjoyed the games yesterday- and the East/West Shrine game on Saturday. Our thoughts on the Sunday\n\ngames:\n\n-How can anyone root against Peyton Manning? The guy is a machine. How he can look over the defense and know - KNOW - which receiver will be open is truly amazing.\n\n-We love watching all four of these teams run the ball. All of them have plays where they pull linemen around the end as lead blockers. Not necessarily well, but they do pull. Watching those mouthy CB's have to actually come up and take on the blocker is loads of fun!\n\n-We are split. Do you think Coach Childress called the last pass play, or did Favre decide that one on his own? I just can't see the Coach taking that kind of gamble, but the boys think it was the Coach.\n\n-How can all these guys who are making millions of dollars - players and coaches - come out of a timeout in the last seconds of a huge game, and have 12 men in the huddle????\n\nD.J. Millay\n\nVancouver, Washington\n\nAgreed that it was a good weekend. Manning really is in a class by himself, isn't he? The amazing thing is that year after year, the Colts come up with new receivers to replace ones who were seemingly irreplaceable. I'm guessing that Manning has something to do with that.\n\nIf you are referring to that last INT by Favre, the call may have come from the sideline, but the \"trying to be Superman\" throw back to the middle was pure Favre. It goes against everything we've even taught or been taught, but he's made a career of going against conventional wisdom and succeeding more often than not, so you can't really blame him for thinking he could do it one more time.\n\nOf course, they probably wouldn't have been doing that if it hadn't been for that knucklehead 12-men-in-the-huddle penalty. As many cooks as they have in those NFL kitchens, all those layers of coaches (upwards of a dozen assistants, with associate head coaches and assistant head coaches and assistants to assistants) I'm surprised it doesn't happen even more often.\n\n*********** I can overlook almost anything that Brett Favre might do to upset people simply because he doesn't wear his f--king hat backwards like Romo and Roethlisberger.\n\n*********** I really laughed my ass off when I heard the PA announcer ask spectators to stand, remove hats, and join with the singer in singing our national anthem. Good luck, the way those creeps sing it. Before the Jets-Colts game - was there anybody in the United States other than the singer who knew the tune she was singing?\n\n*********** I heard one of the geniuses in the booth (probably Joe Buck, who likes to give us his version of football history) say that the Jets' win over the Colts in Super Bowl III \"validated\" the American Football League. Give me a break. Not a chance. That game was - still is, by many of us - looked on as a fluke.\n\n\"Validation\" didn't occur until a year later, when Hank Stram's Kansas City Chiefs, clearly the better team, handled the NFL champion Vikings, 23-7, in Super Bowl IV, the final one before the leagues merged.\n\n*********** I used to say years ago that TV wouldn't truly be able to replace the actual game experience until it could show us the scoreboard and give us a program. At the time I said that, neither appeared to be possible.\n\nBy now, they've pretty much handled the scoreboard thing with all the score-down-distance-time remaining graphics on every screen.\n\nBut the game program? They barely give us introductions. I love to look through a program and see where the players are from, but if anything, TV has gotten even worse at giving us information about the players. We all know that the NFL hates to mention their colleges in the intros (despite the fact that the colleges save the NFL tens of millions of dollars every year in the sort of player development costs that baseball's minor leagues incur), but jeez - the best CBS could give us for player introductions Saturday was tiny little mug shots - and no first names. Just first initials. WTF?\n\n*********** Didn't the ending to the NFC championship make you sick! A great game decided by a keeker while a future hall of fame QB sits on the sideline helpless to do anything.\n\nGabe McCown\n\nPiedmont, OK-USA\n\nWhat really pissed me off was Joe Buck, afterward, saying, \"So here is the play of the game!\" And it's the f--king FIELD GOAL!\n\nAnd who do they interview afterward? A twerp keeker with his f--king hat on backwards.\n\n*********** There was Joe Buck again, stuffing his foot into his mouth BIG TIME in talking about the Saints and New Orleans. \"Never,\" he said, \"has a team been more closely tied to a city.\"\n\nWTF? Uh, Joe... You ever heard of Green Bay? Baltimore? Pittsburgh? Buffalo?\n\nSurely even you, Joe, know all know about Green Bay, which is owned, essentially, by the people of Green Bay.\n\nAnd, Joe, there has yet to be anything happen in New Orleans comparable to the many ways Baltimoreans showed their love for their Colts.\n\nJoe, the collapse of industry hit Pittsburgh and Buffalo so hard that there are now former Pittsburghers and Buffalonians scattered all over the country, and in every major city there's at least one Steelers' bar, at least one Bills' bar where their fans gather on Sundays. In Portland, they are packed by kickoff for games that start at 10 AM on the West Coast.\n\n*********** Hey coach,\n\nI'm not to big to say I need some help, because I do. Our biggest district rival is a DW team.\n\nWe return alot and can challenge for the district title this year BUT we have lost to them 4 years in a row. I've tried a 6-3, 5-4 and did beat them 5 years ago BUT that was before the addition of Rocket and Rocket pass.\n\nDo you have anything on defending the DW? I sure could use your help. A few years ago, I knew I had to stop toss(24), counter/joker(45), trap and wedge. NOW If I put 11 in the box they kill us with rocket outside and if I don't we can't stop the toss play(power). PLUS the unbalanced formations from it.\n\nI SURE COULD USE YOUR HELP COACH! We are a Belly team, I am the D-CORD. I love the DW offense BUT I hate to defend it. It takes away from everything we work on and forces us to wholesale change for DW teams......Do you have anything on DEFENDING THE DOUBLE WING? Thanx coach...\n\nFirst of all - the fact that it was 1997 when I first went on the Internet and started putting on clinics and selling videos (they were tapes back then) and the Double Wing - and its various permutations - is still going strong is proof that no one - including me - has come up with the silver bullet that kills it. In that time, I have coached at seven different high schools in two different states and every year I see dozens of videos from other Double Wing coaches and I have seen nearly every defense imaginable - and unless there is a significant disparity in talent I have yet to see the defense we can't handle.\n\nSecond, with all due respect, it's not fair to all the Double Wing guys who count on me for help to be giving technical assistance to the \"other side.\"\n\nBut I will give you credit for being wiser than a lot of defensive coordinators who really don't know what they're up against and spend a lot of their time belittling the Double Wing.\n\nThe terms you are using are not familiar to me, so I have to assume that you are not facing one of \"my\" Double Wing guys. I don't know, for example, if your opponent runs the Wedge, which is one of my trademarks, or a \"G,\" which is one of my carry-overs from my Delaware Wing-T days. Or my Wildcat. And you didn't say how well they pass. But if it is a fully-armed Double-Wing team it will be capable of attacking you anywhere, and from a variety of sets. In my opinion, that's a handful. So unless they're one of these one-formation/four or five play Double Wings that they got off the Internet, I don't think that you want to get too far from your base defense.\n\nThere's an old expression, \"familiarity breeds contempt.\" I've heard a football version of it that goes \"familiarity breeds defense.\" In other words, the more familiar you are with an opponent's offense, the better you ought to be able to defend against them. But that means you need to see the Double-Wing a lot, and that's tough when you only have one Double Wing team on your schedule. You might take a page from coaches I know who have one or two option teams on their schedule, and so from the first day of camp, they include 10 or 15 minutes daily of defending the option.\n\nAnd you need to be able to see it reasonably well-run. There's your biggest problem, in my opinion. I see an awful lot of opponents in pre-game whose scout offenses are running the most halfass Double Wings you can imagine. I suggest that you assign a staff member - maybe yourself - to learning everything you can about what that Double-Wing opponent is trying to do - and how and why - and put that person in charge of the Double Wing scout offense. You're not going to do it nearly as well as a lot of my guys who really know the ins and outs and fine details, but at least you won't have to try cobble together a scout team the week of the game that can't possibly give your defense a good look.\n\nMaybe you should come to my Chicago clinic. The only danger is that you might be converted.\n\n(Follow-up - I take the time to answer this guy and not a word of thanks do I get. So let him go get a defense off the Internet.

What they didn't recognize in the telecast was the good technique he used to strip the ball. There was no doubt in my mind that Garcon's D-III pedigree allowed him to have the excellent technique (on both sides of the ball!) that many others from D-I programs would not.\n\nIn fact, at a clinic a few years ago I listened to the Mount Union coach talk about how his line coach had moved to D-I (Bowling Green?) and that he would now be allowed to \"teach holding,\" something that wouldn't fly at the D-III level.\n\nIf you've ever watched Mt. Union play, you may agree that they could give many D-I programs a run for their money. The big boys would have too many substitution packages, I'm sure, but on guts and technique, plus some darn good talent, I bet Mt. Union would beat some of the below .500 D-I guys. Your thoughts.\n\nTodd Hollis\n\nElmwood, Illinois\n\nAgreed. I'm assuming you mean \"D-IAA\", and I agree that a Mount Union could beat a lower-level non-scholarship I-AA (FCS) school.\n\nBut as for a scholarship D-IAA school (Big Sky, Colonial Conference, Southern Conference) , I don't think so. Not even one below .500.\n\nWe have a situation out here in the Pacific Northwest that makes it convenient to make the comparison - a very, very good D-III school in nearby Linfield College, and a (currently) bottom-level Big Sky school in Portland State.\n\nGenerally speaking, PSU's athletes are kids who for one reason or another don't meet the needs of an Oregon or Oregon State, but they're not bad - they are scholarship athletes. The Linfield kids are not. This is not to say that Linfield may not have a few kids who turned down an offer from PSU, but for the most part a talented football player will accept an offer of a full ride at Portland State over having to pay tuition at a small private college.\n\nD-IAA teams don't play D-III teams, but based on PSU's ability to play just one step down and beat D-II teams, I think they'd just be too much for any D-III program. We simply can't ignore the importance of talent.\n\nAlthough the D-III guys would not necessarily concede anything in the area of coaching, and certainly not in the \"intangibles\" that we coaches all love so well, they would give up quite a bit in terms of the measurables, and there would be a few mismatches in favor of the D-I school.\n\nIt would be a classic David and Goliath game, but without his sling, David loses\n\n*********** College Football Hall of Famer Herschel Walker (Georgia) will make his MMA fight debut on January 30 in Sunrise, Florida...

These clauses enable companies to recover compensations such as bonuses for a variety of reasons, including the uncovering of a scandal or if certain performance goals are not reached. A recent editorial in The New York Times called for clear clawback provisions for board members of major banks as part of a financial reform package.\n\nColleges should do the same: Insert clawback provisions into their coaches' contracts calling for a coach - wherever he may be - to reimburse his former employer should he or his program violate NCAA rules.\n\n*********** From the Internet - TEXAS RULES\n\n1.

Bush and how he was arrested for hanging from a goal post after a victory.\n\nMore bad neckrolls then you could shake a stick at\n\nBouscarin talking about how he felt his job was to \"hurt people and get them out of the game\" and how he states \"I used my helmet as a spear\" - What would the NFL Commish do with this guy???\n\nYale fans chanting \"Hold that line!\", \"We are number one!\", \"You are number two!\"\n\nYale male cheerleaders blowing off real mini cannons on the sidelines and almost blowing off their fingers\n\nRolls of toilet paper seemed to fly on to the field every ten plays or so......never thought about sneaking that into a college game before\n\nStudent section smoking \"various\" items during the game and puffs of smoke everywhere\n\nDamn.....I had never seen so many side plots and stories in my entire life......what a great historical viewpoint for a person that wasn't born for another couple years........\n\nThe football related items that I found interesting was that both Yale and Harvard ran a lot of Double Wing sets.......wide splits but definitely double tight double wing along with a good amount of compressed I formation.\n\nBrian Dowling was the deep man on punts and kicks (THE QB!)\n\nBoth punt teams kept THREE (3) blockers five yards deep behind the line on punt formations. Something many coaches have begun to do the last few years BUT act like they just invented it.........as if it is a modern thing to do.\n\nWhat a crazy time to be alive..........don't know what your feelings are about it but I would have loved to be at that game........Bill Lawlor, Crystal Lake, Illinois\n\nThanks for telling me. I haven't seen it and I'd give anything to be able to.\n\nThat was possibly the best Yale team of all time. The name of the film is \"HARVARD BEATS YALE 29-29\" - it was the gloating headline in the \"Harvard Crimson,\" the Harvard Daily newspaper, and it's still painful for old Yalies to have to think about.\n\nBrian Dowling, as it may have said, was the \"BD\" in Doonesbury. Garry Trudeau, the cartoonist, was at Yale at the time, and his original comic strip, \"Bull Tales,\" done for the student newspaper, the Yale Daily News (aka the \"Yalie Daily\") featured Dowling, Calvin Hill and others.\n\n*********** The Wall Street Journal ran an article a week or so ago on the apparent surge in the pro running game. It attributes it to two main factors: (1) defenses are set up to defend against the pass, so the run catches them off-balance; (2) \"Misdirection.\" I know, I know - they wouldn't know real misdirection if you sent them a DVD of the Delaware Wing-T. But evidently the simple zone cutback is driving the pros crazy. Funny how in their own way, they're a lot like youth defenses in that they're so easy to fool.\n\nFrankly, I think NFL rushing seems to be so effective effective because the tackling is so lousy. Especially in the secondary, where the emphasis on either stripping or targeting has led to an almost total absence of tackling skills. What does pass for tackling is normally a dive at the runner's ankles. I couldn't believe what a horrible tackler the Eagles' #42 was. He sure must be a hell of a cover guy. Take a look at the games this weekend and I'll bet that you won't count more than a dozen tackles - total - in which a defensive back has a runner completely wrapped up with both arms.\n\n*********** Bear with me for a few articles. You have to understand - I was honestly afraid might go to my death bed to the strains of the \"Internationale,\" so after Scott Brown's shocking win in Massachusetts Tuesday night, I am positively giddy. It may not be too late for the America I grew up loving.\n\nI ain't much for political rallies, but I would go to a Brown rally.\n\nEven move to Massachusetts. (Actually, other than the high cost of housing, that wouldn't take all that much. My wife and I both went to college in New England, and we love it there.)\n\nBarring something damning in his past - and pending his ability to avoid trouble from here on out - h e's definitely going to be presidential material.\n\nHis biggest obstacle is going to be all the other Republicans with presidential aspirations of their own. Losers, the lot of them, they will act like his buddies, but they will be waiting to stab him in the back.\n\n*********** A friend in Massachusetts sent me a poster of George W. Bush over the caption, \"MISS HIM YET?\" and I wrote back to tell him,\"Miss him? Hey - he's still hard at work for us - Barack said that the reason people elected Scott Brown was the reason they same elected him - they're still pissed off over the last eight years!\"\n\nI also thanked my friend for whatever part he took in the recent election, and told him I'd written to my Representative (a Demo) requesting that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts be readmitted to the United States with all the rights and privileges of any other patriotic state.\n\n*********** Welcome to Scott Brown for President Headquarters.\n\nFinally - a politician with a real sense of humor. Unscripted.\n\nAfter a year under Obama Rule - who can forget his World Apology Tour? - it is impossible to understate the importance to our nation of this one election.\n\nThis really was a mini-revolution. Dems will run from Obama like rats from a burning building, because they realize that when a Democrat can lose in Massachusetts - and lose Teddy Kennedy's seat at that - no one's seat is safe. (With the exception of those few like John Murtha, who've built a veritable security bunker with taxpayer dollars, and those like Alcee Hastings, Charlie Rangel, Maxine Waters and Sheila Jackson Lee, who enjoy gerrymandered racial security.)\n\nI used to teach my classes that there's really only one thing they really need to know about how our system of government works - politicians like their jobs and will do anything they can to keep them.\n\nCongressional Dems, who being politicians like their jobs and will do anything to keep them, have not missed what happened in Massachusetts and they realize it can happen to them if they ride the wrong horse. So no matter what direction Our Great Leader might try to lead them, they're not about to go back into a burning building to try to rescue him. That means, I believe, that we have likely seen the end of (1) Health Care Reform; (2) Cap and Trade; (3) Immigration Reform; (4) Card Check; (5) Civilian Trials for Guantanamo Detainees; (6) Attorney General Holder's Re-opening of CIA \"Torture\" Cases; (7) Repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell; (8) Gay Marriage; (9) More stimulus programs\n\nWe might even see GM go on the auction block.\n\nNow, if no one can find any scandal in his background, and if he can find an acceptable Vice-President - I suggest a long, hard look at J.C. Watts - Scott Brown has got to be a favorite for the Republican nomination in 2012. He's the first Republican I've seen since Ronald Reagan who can actually get people excited.\n\nUnknown? Give me a break. Can you say Barack Obama? A lot of us are convinced we still don't know the guy.\n\nInexperienced? By the time the election rolls around, Scott Brown will have had more experience in national office than Barack Obama did, and all he has to do now is replicate the senatorial career of Senator Obama - one of being careful not to do anything of significance that might pin a target on him.\n\nAnd Scott Brown will probably let us see his report cards from Tufts and BC Law School.\n\n*********** My predicton - unless Scott Brown has had sex with a monkey, he is Number One in the 2012 Republican presidential race. Of course, with his looks he could be a womanizer, but I thank the Mass Dems for having vetted him on that score. Surely they left no stone unturned.\n\nHe will have far better qualifications than Barack Hussein Obama did when he ran. Hell, by 2012 Brown will have served in the Senate longer than Barack did. And before that, he had lots of positions more responsible than \"community organizer.\" He still serves in the Army. We know where he was born and raised - even saw his mother and father on TV (unless those were actors playing them) - and he's probably willing to let us see his report cards from Tufts and BC Law.\n\nIn my lifetime, there have been only two Republicans with great popular appeal - Eisenhower and Reagan. He has the potential to match them.\n\nHe talks eloquently, but like a normal guy, unrehearsed and without a teleprompter. And he actually has a sense of humor.\n\nAbove all - like Justice Potter Stewart on pornography, I can't define it but I know it when I see it - he has IT.\n\nWhere do I get on the bandwagon?\n\n*********** I think that as much as anything, the Massachusetts election was a statement for the old American value of fair play and a repudiation of the imperious, underhanded way the Democratic congressional leadership (Reid, Polosi) have been trying to cram their programs down the unwilling throats of the American people. (You do remember, don't you, the Massachusetts legislature hastily changing the state law that would have allowed a Republican governor to appoint the interim successor to Teddy Kennedy?)\n\n*********** Considering Teddy \"The Lion of the Senate\" Kennedy's dark background (he left the scene of an accident while a young woman drowned in his car, but because he was a Kennedy he paid no price for his criminal actions), you'd think someone at the Boston Globe would have caught the headline that started out \"COAKLEY DROWNS...\"\n\n*********** How nice to jump from a President with an, um, \"uncertain\" background who didn't even notice that his pastor was spewing racial, um, \"dissonance,\" to a guy that everyone in Wrentham, Massachusetts knows.\n\nhttp://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/21/in_wrentham_a_town_citizen_intertwined/\n\n*********** Rubbing salt in the wounds --- One person gloating after a campaign in which he perceived that a certain Boston Globe columnist had leaned toward Coakley...\n\nOne can only imagine the gang of left-wing loons at Joan's neighborhood New Years party. All wearing \"Coakley\" buttons, and scores of Volvo's outside with Obama bumper stickers, and at least two more with some sort of anti- Bush/Cheney/Halliburton sticker. Oh, and one of those little PBS stickers,too. LOL!\n\n*********** As much as I LIKE George W. Bush personally, I can't forgive him for letting the TSA boondoggle happen. As if hiring tens of thousands of drones who couldn't find productive work anywhere else and putting them between us and our flights was going to allay our fears of flying, or convince us that our government was really serious about making flying safe.\n\nIt's as if they took the nastiest, least competent people from the Department of Motor Vehicles and shipped them to airports all over America.\n\nAnything to dodge the simplest, most fail-safe solution: PROFILE\n\n*********** A friend who took over a new program told me about his interviewing people from the previous staff, including a couple who had applied for the head job:\n\n\"Another guy put in for the job, too, and was ticked he didn't get it. Our first conversation was not good - I sensed resentment and I told him so. We had an official interview and I think it went fine - (I sort of told him you're in or you're out). He said he is in, but asked to be put on a lower level (which is fine with me). He said time commitment, but I think it is also to not have to feel humiliated. Either way - fine with me - BUT I will keep a close eye on him.\n\nI wrote,\n\nYou may be surprised how difficult this \"keeping a close eye on him\" can be with all the other things you will have to worry about. (Unless you have another eye in the back of your head.) My inclination when I come across a guy that on first meeting I don't like is to trust my guts. I'm currently reading a book by Malcolm Gladwell called \"Blink\" which - stretching his premise a bit - deals to some degree with how often initial gut feelings are correct. How sometimes, without being able to say why, you just know.\n\nIt's only January. If I'd hired the guy, it would only have been on a \"prove yourself\" basis. I think letting him go to a lower level leaves him free to sabotage and criticize. What are you going to do when you're three weeks into the season and you see his team running plays you don't recognize? The longer you let the branch grow, the harder it becomes to prune it.\n\n*********** You think official NFL apparel is already expensive? Prepare to pay a lot more, if the NFL's latest scheme, allowing only online stores that bought at least $3 million worth of licensed merchandise from Reebok last year to apply to sell again this year. Conventional stores must have bought at least $2 million worth of NFL merchandise.\n\nThis will especially pare down the number of online sellers, which could result in higher prices for consumers. “If the league gets rid of everyone online except them, they can enforce their prices,” said one online retailer.\n\nOf course, if you don't want to pay those high prices, you don't have to - if you don't mind buying knockoffs.\n\nIn fact, Brian McCarthy, an NFL spokesman, said the league’s reason for consolidating its sales to a smaller number of larger retailers was not to create a situation where it can jack up prices, but to combat counterfeiters.\n\n“It’s the same as Tiffany or Levi’s or Ralph Lauren,” he told the New York Times. “Wal-Mart doesn’t sell our top of the line. The game day stuff is our best stuff, and that’s why we need to protect it.”\n\nGood luck stopping counterfeiters. Last week alone, more than 2,100 fake NFL jerseys were confiscated at one Cincinnati sports show.\n\nThe NFL estimates that it loses tens of millions in sales every year to counterfeiters. It's no wonder, considering the opportunity the NFL provides them: NFL \"game day\" jerseys sell for $109 on the NFL's own online shop, but you can find one (or a reasonable facsimile) on some Web sites for as little as $19.\n\n*********** In a column last week on statecollege.com, Penn State quarterbacks coach Jay Paterno, son of Joe, deplores the current state of college football. \"This profession has lost touch with the reality of the world around us, and some coaches have lost touch with what the mission of our profession should be,'' he wrote. \"We are starting to look as arrogant as the Wall Street bankers raking in seven-figure bonuses. The astronomical explosion in coaching salaries continues at a time of 10 percent unemployment in America and exploding tuition costs burdening working class families ... Coaches walk into a recruit's home and talk about how they will look out for that young man's future. The expectation is that the coach will help to guide him through a very formative time. A year later the same coach is off to another job for more money and left behind are the young men he promised to nurture towards their future.''\n\nNot to disagree with what Coach Paterno says about the outlandish coaching salaries that make big time college football a runaway train headed 70 miles an hour toward a washed-out bridge, but I do take issue with this idea of parents turning over their son to a coach, and the coach \"guiding him through a very formative time\" business.\n\nI say it's time we put a little of the burden on these poor, helpless children and their parents.\n\nFor the most part, kids who are recruited to major college programs are not virgins. They know the score. They are Hessians - soldiers of fortune - and they know the price of their labors. They are looking for the best deal they can get. As they should.\n\nBy the time a kid signs with a Florida, or a Texas, or a Penn State, he has heard it all and weighed all the offers, and he's had plenty of advice, good and bad. And he knows what he's worth. And just as it's true that every scam depends on a degree of larceny in the heart of the victim, let's not kid ourselves - he's a willing accomplice in any chicanery that might take place. And if he's really going to a particular school because he expects the head coach to be the father he never had, he's going to be surprised the first time he steps onto that practice field.\n\nWhy isn't there someone who can tell a kid to stop for a minute and put his Heisman fantasies aside and think for a minute about the downside of it all? Yes, yes, I know - the coach is going to be there forever. He gave you his word. But just suppose... What if he moves on? What if he gets fired?\n\nYes, yes, I know - your future is in football. You're going to start as a freshman and win the Heisman Trophy as a sophomore, and go pro after your junior year. But just in case... what if those things don't pan out? What if, for example, you get hurt?\n\nYears ago, I spoke with a high school kid who faced a choice between Stanford and a couple of higher-profile programs. From my perspective, I told him, it was a no-brainer. Things can go wrong in football, I said. There are a lot of unpredictables along the way, and there's an awful lot of life after football. What if you get hurt? Where would you be better off if suddenly you didn't have football - Knucklehead U or Stanford?\n\nDon't know what effect that little talk had, but he wound up going to Stanford and having a decent enough career. Nothing that got him to the NFL, you understand. But that's okay - he's got a diploma that reads STANFORD.\n\nAs a means of ending the coaching carousel, Jay Paterno proposes giving coaches tenure. I can't think of anything dumber. I happen to think that tenure - combined with teachers' unions - is the single biggest impediment to improving American education. No one, including Supreme Court justices, should serve for life.\n\n*********** Good Morning Hugh,\n\nIt is the clinic season and over the years I have sure have attended my share. Anyway the comment from the coach yesterday on speakers who use so much bad language that it takes away from the presentation inspired me to give you a short list of the speakers I have liked the best. It might help some as they attend clinics this season. In no particular order:\n\nRich Ederly ( Carnegie Mellon- Wing T) Witty and intelligent: The material is well presented, supported by film, and topical. I have never failed to take something away from his presentations.\n\nWes Elrod / Hershel Moore (Retired Cumberland University--Wing T) They have a unique play calling system and do a great job presenting Wing T information and their system. They do a terrific job around the use of formations to create an offensive advantage. Both are fun to listen to. Moore is something of coaching Legend.\n\nDenny Creehan (West Virginia Wesleyan College--Wing-T) Although rumor has it he has gone to the spread offense he does a great job of presenting the Wing-t offense fo high school coaches--one of the best.\n\nHugh Wyatt The best DW presenter out there. His one day clinics on the Double Wing are the very best and always include something important for coaches. I have never attended on of his clinicse (I have attend a bunch) Without taking something away from them.\n\nAs you might have noticed there is a theme to my choices but thought others might have suggestions that would help your readers look for presentor at clincs.\n\nJack Tourtillotte\n\nBoothbay, Maine\n\n(Jack is too kind. He knows his Double Wing. As offensive coordinator, he helped build Boothbay Region HS into a state contender, and the program hasn't been the same since he retired. He flew west to assist me in 2008 and we had a great season. I'm hoping I can get him to present at the Providence clinic. HW)\n\n*********** ATLANTA -- Former Army football player Lt. Col. Greg Gadson was presented with the 2010 Award of Inspiration by the NCAA Honors Committee during the NCAA Convention in Atlanta.\n\nWest Point Superintendent Lt. Gen. Franklin Hagenbeck presented Gadson with his award Friday evening. Athletics Director Kevin Anderson and Deputy Athletics Director Gene Marshall were also among the crowd.\n\nA four-time football letterwinner, Gadson embarked on his military career following his graduation from West Point in 1998. He was wounded in action and later received his master’s degree.\n\n“This means a lot,” said Gadson. “I suppose I am still shocked and really humbled by an award at this level. I am truly humbled by the recognition.”\n\nGadson was leading soldiers in Baghdad as Commander of the 2-32 Field Artillery Battalion in 2007 when his vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device during an operational surge. The four-vehicle patrol was returning to battalion headquarters following a memorial service.\n\nDuring the explosion, Gadson was badly injured and lost nearly 70 pints of blood. He was transported to Walter Reed Medical Center and had to have both legs amputated above the knee because of the irreparable damage.\n\nWhile no longer able to lead soldiers in Baghdad because of his injures, Gadson earned his master’s degree in Executive Master of Policy Management from Georgetown University and continues to be a frequent guest speaker on courage, perseverance and teamwork.\n\nGadson lettered as a defensive tackle during his football career and helped the Black Knights to a 9-3 mark his senior season. During the 1997 season, Army beat both Navy and Air Force and played in the Sun Bowl.\n\n“My time as a football player and cadet has been very helpful,” said Gadson. “One of the first things I said when I regained consciousness was about Army-Navy. Certainly, the lessons I learned at West Point and on the football field, in terms of working hard, never giving up and always looking forward helped. One of the things I share with people is that if you make a good play or a bad play, it’s in the past. You have to play the next play. That was one of the bigger lessons I learned. You can’t live in the past, you have to continue to prove yourself, continue to play. Not that I don’t enjoy things, but you can’t live in the past. Maybe that mentality has helped me look forward.”\n\nA veteran for 20 years, Gadson continues to work with the medical community to test the latest prosthetic knees, encourages fellow soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Center and served as an inspiration and honorary captain for the New York Giants on the way to their Super Bowl championship during the 2007-08 season.\n\n“I am begrudgingly beginning to understand this,” said Gadson. “It’s hard for me to look at myself as inspiring. I just feel like I am trying to live my life the best I can and contribute what I can. I am just trying to do what needs to be done. Sometimes the label of inspiration is uncomfortable.”\n\nRead more about Greg Gadson and his inspirational story... http://www.coachwyatt.com/GregGadsonStory.pdf\n\n*********** You may recall my telling you of the tragic death in combat of David Gutierrez, a semi-pro football player who was scheduled to receive his team's Black Loion Award when he returned on leave this month.\n\nI asked his coaches if there were some way those of us who honored his service and respected him as a Black Lion Award winner might be able to make a contribution to his family (he leaves a wife and two boys).\n\nSend a contribution of any size - it;s the support tht matters. And say it's \"from the Black Lions.\"\n\nMr Wyatt-\n\nI have the bank information for donations to the family of SSG David Gutierrez:\n\nCommonwealth Central Credit Union\n\nPO BOX 641690\n\nSan Jose, CA 95164\n\nC/O Patty P. Gutierrez Family\n\nI have attached a photo for you to share with the Black Lion community. We presented Patty with the framed items at a ceremony following his military memorial at Fort Lewis, WA. Tomorrow, Jan 16 was the day David would have been presented his award during his leave at Fort Lewis.\n\nThank you.\n\nMark Meadows, Lacey, Washington\n\nTUESDAY, JANUARY 19, 2010- \"Football is nothing but composed accidents. The great art is to profit from such accidents.\" General Robert R. Neyland, a real Tennessee football coach\n\n*********** My initial reaction to Derek Dooley was \"desperation hire,\" but I have to admit I didn't know enough about him to make anything other than a snap judgment, Further investigation leads me to believe that Dooley may not only be a good hire. He may even turn out to be a very good hire.\n\nImmediately in his favor is that he is the anti-Lane Kiffin. He has a good, varied coaching background. He's a UVa grad. Has a law degree. (So, of course, does Mike Leach, but Dooley actually passed the bar and practiced for a couple of years.) Good family man (hard to carry on a secret second life in Ruston, Louisiana). Wife is an OBGYN. Served as AD at Louisiana Tech, so if nothing else, he'll appreciate what he has to work with at Tennessee. Has been on earth longer than Kiffin, lessening the chance of adolescent behavior. Also, he knows how not to insult his audience. Contrast his first appearance at Tennessee in a suit and orange tie with Kiffin's last - in an open-neck polo with the shirttail hanging out.\n\nAs for his three years as a head coach at Louisiana Tech - I'd say he managed pretty well, if you take the time dissect the record. His overall record was 17-20, but take away six losses in \"fundraiser\" games that teams like Lousiana Tech have to play to stay afloat financially - LSU (twice), Ole Miss, Cal, Auburn, Kansas - and replace them with more reasonable opponents and then assume that LT goes 4-2 against them, and it would be 21-16, which would be enough to get him hired most places on the strength of the job he did.\n\nAnd then there are the six losses to Boise and Nevada. Take them away and he was 21-10 against everybody but the BCS guys and the two conference teams that are pretty much in a class by themselves.\n\nBy the way, LT only lost to Boise State by 10 and LSU by 8 this past season.\n\nIs Kiffin over .500 as a head coach yet? (Hahahaha. Answer: No. He's 12-17) Best anybody's been able to say about him so far is that he almost beat Alabama. Well, yeah. But Kentucky almost beat him, and if he doesn't beat Kentucky in OT, he's 6-7 and the first Tennessee coach to lose to Kentucky in 25 years..\n\nYes, the SEC is merciless, but Derek Dooley's already gone up against SEC teams. With lesser talent, and at their places. I think that, put into a situation like Tennessee where he's swinging the same size bat as everyone else, he could turn out to be a good one.\n\nI do like this quote from him at his introductory news conference: \"If you're going to look for sound bites and things from me that are going to attack other programs and disparage people, that's just not how I am.\"\n\n*********** It wouldn't seem right to write about Derek Dooley and not give Lane Kiffin a mention, too, so here goes, courtesy of Charles Barkley...\n\n\"He has to have pictures of someone having sex with a monkey. He's had three really good jobs and did not deserve any of the three. He has to have pictures of someone having sex with a monkey, theres no doubt in my mind.\"\n\n*********** After watching the scenes of unbelievable suffering in Haiti, it's hard to believe that just a couple of weeks ago people's hearts were going out to the spoiled child of a powerful, meddling father who had to spend a couple of hours inside a \"shed.\"\n\n*********** I think that the NFL has gone way too far with the \"blow to the head\" crap in trying to protect quarterbacks, but after the dirty hit on Kurt Warner (which seemed to be perfectly okay to the guys in the booth, even though it was delivered to the side by a man clearly behind Warner) following an interception, I think it's time to say, in the interests of the league, that on any interception return, the quarterback becomes a non-player: he can't tackle and he can't be blocked.\n\nAlso, while they're at it, a peelback block in ordert to be legal should require contact with the defender to take place \"inside the frame\" of his body. (Maybe we'll also get to see if the officials ever pay any attention to \"the frame.\")\n\n*********** The biggest story at this month’s International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was 3-D television.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell enthusiastically announced his support of 3-D, saying, \"With surveys showing us that more American youngsters get their football from video games than from watching actual NFL games, our future depends on our ability to make our on-the-field product resemble video games as closely as possible. Studies show that kids are disappointed on discovering that real NFL football games don't resemble video games closely enough. We're working on this at our end, and we feel that 3-D can give our product that 'almost-realistic' look of video games that research shows young consumers miss the most when they watch one of our games.\"\n\n*********** Dallas Cowboys linebacker Keith Brooking called the Vikings \"classless\" as Minnesota ran up the score against the Cowboys in a 34-3 loss on Sunday. Brett Favre's 11-yard touchdown to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe with 1:55 to play prompted Brooking to follow Favre to the sideline and yell at Vikings coach Brad Childress. Already up 27-3, the Cowboys felt the Vikings ran the score up at their expense. \"I thought it was totally classless and disrespectful,\" Brooking said. \"This is the NFL, that's not what this is about. I don't think there's a place for that ... I was looking for Childress. I didn't think it was right.\" si.com\n\nVikings running it up at the Cowboys' expense? Give me a break. The Cowboys don't like it? F--k 'em. F--king crybabies. Somebody remind them they're millionaires and they're paid to play. Hard and well. For the entire f--king game.\n\n\"Classless and disrespectful?\" How about a performance like the one you guys put on? You sure showed a lot of respect for the people who make it possible for you to live like lords.\n\nWhat a buncha spoiled pussies. They thump their chests and mug for the cameras whenever they do the slightest little thing that they're paid to do. They love to brag about being \"warriors,\" but contrast them with boxers: when a boxer's on the ropes he doesn't expect his opponent to stop throwing haymakers and just step back and start bobbing and weaving.\n\nI do agree with Brooking on one point, though - this is not what the NFL is about. The NFL is definitely not about scoring touchdowns. The NFL is about getting inside field goal range and turning things over to the kicker.\n\n*********** Not necessarily happy to see the Chargers' great season end, but with a more-than-80-per-cent chance that an NFL kicker will make good on a field goal attempt, and far too many games ending when a team runs the clock down to a second or two before applying the coup de grace with a gimme field goal, it sure was refreshing to see a team lose one because its kicker missed three field goals.\n\n*********** Hi Coach,\n\nWhether you like Rex Ryan or not you have to respect what he has done with a team that has less talent then those that he has beaten. He has put together a formula where they play great defense using a combination of pressure, zone and man principals. But what I really is the way they play situational defense maybe the best in the league where they all play that way. They play sound offense by running the ball and using play action passes (heck they even repeat successful plays unusual for the NFL) and never get beat in the special teams department. Even Sunday they refused to kick the ball deep with game still in doubt.\n\nCome to think of it is this NFL version of a DW team?\n\nJack Tourtillotte\n\nBoothbay, Maine\n\nIt is definitely old-school offensive football, a bruising contrast to the dink-and-dunk we're used to seeing. I could definitely see the Jets lining up in the Double Wing as a change-up without feeling it was beneath them as professionals.\n\nDefensively, they are really a handful.\n\nIt's uphill for them the rest of the way, but it's hard to go against them.\n\n*********** Peter King in si.com predicts that Tim Tebow will be drafted as the 13th pick overall by the 49ers. Now, Peter King has a lot more access to NFL insiders than I do, but my unsubstantiated belief is that whoever takes Tebow - and when - they either won't know how to use him, or won't be willing to take the necessary steps to making best use of his talents, and he will wind up being considered a \"bust\" by all the pundits.\n\n*********** A company in New Jersey bought 10,000 square feet of the natural turf on which Alabama beat Texas and plans to sell 3-inch square pieces of it, encased in plastic, for $99 each. For an additional amount, you can get pieces from the end zone, the logo at midfield, or - Hollywood couldn't make up a scam like this - from places where big plays occured.\n\n*********** \"I would feel a lot better about it if I felt that what they are doing was meaningful. For the life of me, I don't understand what they are achieving.\" Douglas Laird, aviation security consultant and former Director of Security for Northwest Airlines.\n\n*********** Read this and tell me you'd like to be an athletic director in today's gender-equity driven climate...\n\nA recent article in The Chronicle of Higher Education looks at the discrepancy between the price of admission for men's and women's college basketball games and sees a \"gender gap\" or what the authors call \"Ticket Office Sexism.\" Like, surprise - tickets to men's games cost more than tickets to women's games.\n\nThe authors of the article - another surprise: they're women - noted that a study of the top 25 men's and women's teams revealed that colleges charged an average of three times as much for tickets to men's games, which I was shocked to learn. Really? Only three times as much?\n\nFor season tickets, it was even worse - an average of $233 for women compared to $2500 for men.\n\nThe two authors, who seem unaware that a grasp of basic economics might have been useful in writing their article, claim that by charging appreciably less for women's games than for men's, colleges are practicing \"institutional discrimination that is camouflaged as sensible economic practice.\"\n\nI didn't get to the place (although I'm sure I would have) where the authors suggest that since the public clearly won't pay higher prices for women's games, that college athletic departments bring mens' ticket prices down to the womens' level.\n\n*********** Wrote Keith Thursby in the LA Times last week, \"Bill Mulligan was a good basketball coach. But he was a great quote.\"\n\nI didn't know Bill Mulligan, who died last week, but obviously the newspaper guys loved him.\n\nWrote Thursby, \"UC Irvine, where he coached for 11 seasons, once lost a televised game and Mulligan found a silver lining: 'This was a good game to be on TV. Now every kid in Orange County and L.A. will say, 'I want to go to Irvine. They really need players.'\"\"'\n\nFRIDAY, JANUARY 15, 2010- \"Never interrupt your opponent when he's destroying himself.\" Paul Begala, Clinton advisor\n\n(This quote seemed so appropriate to Lane Kiffin's grand arrival on the Pac-10 scene that it had to be carried over.)\n\nTwo of my newest favorites (plus anybody who's playing USC)\n\n*********** Well.\n\nNow that Lane Kiffin has taken the latest Dream Job on his rapid ascent to Wherever He's Headed, I can resume liking Tennessee and hating USC.\n\nI couldn't root for anybody coached by that a**hole Kiffin, and it really was hard to dislike Pete Carroll.\n\nBut now? Bring out my UT hat and my UCLA sweatshirt!\n\nDid you catch the self-congratulatory way Kiffin described his hiring as a \"perfect fit?\" Actually, he didn't realize how spot-on he was: out here on the West Coast, USC is short for University of Spoiled Children. Kiffin and USC? Perfect fit.\n\nDespite Kiffin's vaunted ability to recruit, his hiring is not exactly striking fear among Pac-10 rivals. In fact, between the likelihood of NCAA sanctions and his yet-to-be-demonstrated ability to actually coach, Kiffin's arrival at USC has the potential of increasing the job security of every other coach in the Pac-10, not the least of whom is just across town - Rick Neuheisel.\n\nSo detestable is Kiffin that he makes Neuheisel downright likable, not to mention trustworthy and loyal. And unlike Urban Meyer, who chose not to return Kiffin's fire, Neuheisel will fight back. It won't take long for loudmouth Lane to discover that Slick Rick is a pretty handy guy with the jab himself.\n\nOh, and by the way - with Kiffin's loss to UCLA this past season, he's already 0-1 against Neuheisel. So go Vols! Go Bruins!\n\nAnd Go Beavers! Go Cardinal! Go Cougars! Go Ducks! Go Golden Bears! Go Huskies! Go Sun Devils! Go Wildcats! Go anybody that plays USC! (Yes, even Notre Dame!)\n\nBeat Kiffin.\n\n*********** It was only a year ago, in December of 2008, that I wrote this...\n\nBut I do have to wonder what there is about a guy whose only head coaching experience has been a year and a half in the NFL, at the head of one of the worst teams in pro football at that, that prompted the people at the University of Tennessee to make him next in a long line of coaching giants such as General Robert Neyland, Bowden Wyatt, Bill Battle, Johnny Majors and, yes, Philip Fulmer.\n\n*********** (also from December, 2008) Unless there's more to the Tennessee hiring than simply getting the best coach...\n\nAt the time of his firing at Tennessee, Philip Fulmer said he got a call from Doug Dickey, former outstanding coach at Florida who as AD at Tennesee had hired Fulmer. Coach Fulmer said Dickey explained why he was fired: \"You don't have a football problem,\" he said. \"What it is is a 'marketing' issue.\"\n\nHmmm. Evidently Philip Fulmer was fired - and lightly-qualified Lane Kiffin, a guy without much of a track record, was hired - because people at Tennessee demanded \"change, \" without thinking too much about what that might mean.\n\nHmmm. Demanding change without thinking too much about what that might mean.\n\nSound like any country you know?\n\n*********** The only reason I don't feel completely sorry for the folks at Tennessee is that the whole time Kiffin was there, acting the mouthy brat and tugging on Superman's cape, they were yuckin' it up and lovin' every minute of it. Give 'em hell, Lane! If only they knew how demeaning the whole act was. I mean, this was Tennessee - Tennessee for God's sake! One of the most storied of all college football programs! And they laughed as this sock puppet destroyed it. Surely they had to know that sooner or later, after an act like that, they were going to have to pay the band.\n\n*********** The whole Kiffin caper (reminds me of the Johnny Carson and Jack Webb \" Clean Copper Clapper caper\" comedy routine- see below) is a big hoot to me, but it could have repercussions disastrous to a school I care about - Duke. I'm a Duke dad, and between you and me, I think Blue Devils' coach David Cutcliffe would be the perfect fit (if I may borrow a Kiffin expression). He knows the SEC. He's been a successful head coach at Mississippi and he's getting Duke turned around. And he spent years at Tennessee as an offensive coordinator. He's given credit for developing Peyton and Eli Manning, both of whom still go to him for help. Coach Cut, I'll understand if you go, but please stay at Duke.\n\n*********** Johnny Carson and Jack Webb: \"Clean Copper Clapper caper\" -\n\nhttp://www.smirkingloon.com/humour/video/clevelands_claude_coopers_copper_clapper_capper.php\n\n*********** One big problem for me with the whole Kiffin gang is that whenever I read \"Orgeron\" I always think for a brief instant that I read \"Oregon.\"\n\nUh-oh. I hope the guys who write the headlines are very careful, and I hope the folks at the NCAA read the headlines very carefully, because I have a feeling we're going to be seeing some stories headed \"ORGERON ACCUSED OF RECRUITING VIOLATIONS.\"\n\n*********** With the NFL playoffs going on and everybody talking about Leach and Leavitt and Kiffin, it must be killing the NFL to see college football still getting all the attention.\n\n*********** Rich Brooks wrote this on Twitter late Tuesday: \"How crazy is this profession! I have seen it all now!\"\n\n*********** A caller to a Knoxville station said it best: \"Monte Kiffin has failed miserably at raising his son.\"\n\nAmen to that. Which prompts the question: Is this Adam James in 10 years?\n\n*********** Hard to believe that this time two years ago we never thought we'd see anything to top the disloyalty and treachery of Rich Rodriguez.\n\n*********** Mike Bianchi, Orlando Sentinel\n\nThis is how scummy Kiffin and his assistant coaches are. According the Knoxville News-Sentinel, former Tennessee recruiting coordinator Ed Orgeron has already contacted multiple UT mid-term enrollees and encouraged them not to attend class today so that they can easily leave UT and enroll at Southern California. According to the newspaper, by attending class today, the nine mid-term enrollees who have been at UT since Monday, would have to follow strict transfer rules, which include sitting out a year.\n\nI’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, Lane Kiffin is the only coach"
