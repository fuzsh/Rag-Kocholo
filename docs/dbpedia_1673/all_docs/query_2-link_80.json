And what should Hawai'i do?\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nThe University of Hawai'i has been offered to join the Mountain West Conference for football and Big West Conference for all other sports.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this? And what should Hawai'i do?\n\nNo clue about football, but otherwise, GO FOR IT! In VB, at least, a far better conference and no travel past California! Sounds like a win-win. Plus two guaranteed opps for Beachman and Hawaii fans to go full out!\n\nPost by ccman on\n\nGuess that $5 million agreement (that Fresno/Nevada welched on) is void, and Benson didn't get anyone to sign another one.\n\nMy guess is the key to this was the MWC offer for football. Hawaii really didn't want to go independant. Wouldn't surprise me to see Utah State, SMU, or Houston to get a MWC invite as well. Have to wonder how close San Jose State is to dropping football and come grovelling back to the Big West to join.\n\nSan Jose used to have solid football teams, some good volleyball and basketball teams as well. Kinda sad to see their plight.\n\nThis would be the best thing in a decade for the Big West, and help stem the slide into D-1 purgatory. Wouldn't be surprised to see San Jose State angling for the same situation.\n\nSInce a MWC invite is involved, Hawaii will accept by end-of-the week.\n\nPost by jcchnl on\n\nI think the move is best for both Hawaii and the WAC. Traveling from Hawaii to Texas/Louisiana and Texas/Louisiana to Hawaii is a little too much. As a life-long Hawaii fan, a little sad and nostalgic to think the Hawaii might be out of the WAC though.\n\nPost by reign69heir on\n\nI think the move is best for both Hawaii and the WAC. Traveling from Hawaii to Texas/Louisiana and Texas/Louisiana to Hawaii is a little too much. As a life-long Hawaii fan, a little sad and nostalgic to think the Hawaii might be out of the WAC though.\n\nWell, a move from the current WAC to the Mountain West is really just a move to the WAC 2.0: WAC from the Past.\n\nPost by jr67 on\n\nI think this is great news but somehow I'm not as thrilled as I thought I would be. I love going back to the Big West. However, although this is a step up for the football team I don't relish being back in the same conference with those backstabbers and traitors. I also hope with this move Hawaii hasn't delivered the final deathblow to the WAC. I feel especially bad for Utah State.\n\nPost by IdahoBoy on\n\nIMO, Hawai'i should leave the WAC and accept the offer. The WAC is falling apart and Hawai'i should just ditch it before it gets any worse.\n\nHawaii staying in the WAC doesn't make it worse.\n\nPost by ccman on\n\n\"Backstabbers and traitors\"\n\nWho would that be? Fresno State, who was left at the lurch by the MWC-8 a decade ago? Not Utah State, who left the Big West (good for them) and whose AD was operating behind the scenes with his mormon ties to nab BYU? Utah State ditched the Big West. Nevada? for taking care of itself?\n\nLet's put the onus where it belongs. BCS football is the reason and is a mess.\n\nUnlike V-ball, the D-1 so-called national championship game is a total joke. All of the speculation (especially mine) on this board pales in comparison to the weekly overreaction analysis of college football games, culminating with a pre-arraigned snooty 'title' game that resembles a 1930 Indian arraigned marriage (sorry if offending my Hindu compardres) or Don King/Bob Arum boxing match more than the determination of a champion.\n\nPost by alohawaii on\n\nIMO, Hawai'i should leave the WAC and accept the offer. The WAC is falling apart and Hawai'i should just ditch it before it gets any worse.\n\nHawaii staying in the WAC doesn't make it worse.\n\nI didn't say that Hawai'i staying will make it worse. I'm saying that Hawai'i should leave the conference before it gets any worse (ex: more teams leave, eastern teams added to the conf, etc)"
