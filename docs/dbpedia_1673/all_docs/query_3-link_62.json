        "text": "The Utah baseball team advances to the third round of the Mountain West Conference Tournament after upsetting No. 1 seed New Mexico, 6-4, Thursday.\n\nThe Utes entered the contest in the losers bracket after falling to Brigham Young 9-6 Wednesday. Utah boosts its season record to 26-29, while the Lobos drop to 35-20. The Utes led the game, scoring six runs on 10 hits with one error, while leaving New Mexico with four runs on 10 hits with one error.Sophomore Ryan Bailey earned the win for the Utes, pitching the first six innings. He faced 28 batters, gave up nine hits and only three runs while striking out five at the plate. Brett Lindsey pitched three innings of relief. Facing 11 batters, the junior gave up only one hit and one run to earn the save.\n\nAlthough the Lobos came back to score solo runs in the sixth and eighth innings, the Utes held fast to their lead with a solo homer by Jake Shortino. Brit Pannier led the game for Utah, going 3-for-4 with three singles and two runs. Shortino was 2-for-3 scoring one run and two RBIs.\n\nThe Utes were to continue tournament play today at 3 p.m. with San Diego State.\n\nSAN DIEGO STATE 6, BYU 5: Upsets nearly ruled the day in round two of the Mountain West Conference Baseball Tournament until second-seeded San Diego State came from behind Thursday to beat BYU, 6-5.\n\nBecause of the loss, BYU was to play top-seeded New Mexico today. Utah advances to play the Air Force Academy and that winner advances automatically into the championship game on Saturday.\n\nBYU made a valiant effort Thursday night behind the pitching of Nate Fernley in coming back against SDSU. But Brandon Rogers' two-out homer in the seventh was the difference.\n\nTwo relief pitchers helped the Aztecs strike out the side, stranding three Cougars on base in the seventh after Rogers' homer.\n\nBYU, now 28-28, faces UNM, 35-20, which lost earlier in the day to Utah. No. 6-seeded Air Force eliminated host UNLV, the fifth-seed, in the first game of round two with a 13-11 victory."
