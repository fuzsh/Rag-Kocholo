        "text": "TJ Bruce became the ninth head coach of the Long Beach State baseball program on June 21, 2024\n\n\"Dirtbags Baseball is an institution in the Long Beach community built on an incredible fan base, historic success, and alumni who have excelled at the professional baseball level. Identifying someone who understands and can embrace the Dirtbags Baseball brand was critical to this hire, and TJ Bruce is that coach,\" said Executive Director of Athletics Bobby Smitheran. \"We are thrilled to welcome TJ home to a program he knows well, having worn the Dirtbags uniform as a former student-athlete and assistant coach. TJ returns to Long Beach State with head coaching experience, a winning pedigree, and a track record of success at the highest levels in college baseball. He is dedicated to helping our student-athletes grow as baseball players, focusing on academic achievement and personal development. His leadership will position our student-athletes for sustained success on the field and in life. We are overjoyed to welcome TJ, his wife Heather, and their children to a community ready to celebrate Dirtbags Baseball at the highest levels.\"\n\nBruce played for one season with the program, but it was memorable in 2004 when the Dirtbags reached the Super Regionals with a 40-win season and finished the season ranked No. 12 in the nation. Transitioning directly into coaching, Bruce spent six seasons on the staff with Long Beach State, where the team made three postseason appearances, including a run to the Super Regionals in 2005.\n\nMoving on to UCLA prior to the 2011 season, Bruce served as the recruiting coordinator with John Savage, helping secure the commitments of several players who would go on to play a major role in the Bruins' run to the College World Series in 2012 and then a 2013 National Championship.\n\nOwing to his success in five seasons in Westwood, Bruce was hired as the head coach for Nevada Baseball, where he spent seven seasons, posting a winning record while leading the Wolf Pack to a pair of Mountain West Regular Season titles. In 2021, Bruce was named the Mountain West Coach of the Year after leading Nevada to the regular season and tournament championships, sending Nevada to the NCAA postseason for just the fifth time in program history and the first time since 2000. In his tenure with the Wolf Pack, Bruce qualified for every Mountain West Conference Tournament contested, and he had the highest winning percentage of any coach in the conference.\n\nBruce then joined TCU as an Associate Head Coach, and the Horned Frogs had great success immediately upon his arrival in Fort Worth in 2023. TCU would reach the 2023 College World Series, the sixth trip to Omaha in program history, and advance to the national semifinals for the first time. Coaching the offense with TCU, the 2023 squad had a .298 batting average, hit 89 home runs, and set a program record with 141 stolen bases.\n\n\"My family and I are so excited to return to where my coaching career started for this incredible opportunity at Long Beach State,\" said Bruce. \"I am grateful to President Conoley and Bobby Smitheran for the chance to lead the Dirtbags baseball program, with its rich tradition of success at a world-class university. We will be committed to developing our student-athletes and upholding the values that make Dirtbag Nation special. We will hit the ground running and work tirelessly to make our alumni, fans, and the great city of Long Beach proud.\"\n\nBruce and his wife, Heather, have two daughters, Rhowan and Harloe, and two sons, Jaxon and Nash."
