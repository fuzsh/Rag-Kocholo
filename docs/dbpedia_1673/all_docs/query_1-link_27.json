        "text": "The college football landscape has undergone massive changes. Just look at the Big 12. Out are the Oklahoma Sooners and Texas Longhorns, who joined the SEC. In are the Utah Utes, Arizona Wildcats, Arizona State Sun Devils and Coach Prime's Colorado Buffaloes.\n\nAfter leaving the Pac-12, Utah takes over as the favorite in its new conference. The Utes, who went 8-5 last season, are 3-1 to win the Big 12 and followed closely by the Kansas State Wildcats at 4-1.\n\nOnly Utah (+6000) and K-State (+7500) are among the top 20 teams in terms of odds to win the national championship.\n\nThe playoffs for 2024 will now feature 12 teams. The CFP selection committee will determine the seven highest-ranked at-large teams, and the five highest-ranked conference champions will also qualify.\n\nHere are each ACC team's regular-season win totals, conference and national championship odds and ESPN betting expert Joe Fortenbaugh's best future bet as we head into the season.\n\nOther conferences: ACC, Big Ten (Wednesday), SEC (Thursday), American (Aug. 12), Mountain West (Aug. 13), C-USA (Aug. 14), MAC (Aug. 15), Sun Belt (Aug. 16), Independents (Aug. 17)\n\nOdds accurate as of publication. For the most up-to-date odds, visit ESPN BET.\n\nFortenbaugh's favorite: Utah OVER 9.5 wins (-140), YES playoffs (+280)"
