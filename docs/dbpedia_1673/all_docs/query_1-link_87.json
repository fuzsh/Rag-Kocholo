        "text": "As the NBA free-agent season winds down, Charles Barkley's had the potential to ramp up.\n\nMonday, it was reported in The Athletic that TNT was determined to move forward with Barkley, a mainstay on its signature NBA studio show since 2000, \"with or without the NBA\" broadcasting rights beyond next year. If that prospect seemed dubious, Barkley confirmed he had at least been discussing his future with Amazon Prime Video, NBC and ESPN — the new rightsholders after TNT's contract with the league expires in 2025.\n\nTuesday, the network issued a press release putting all the rumors to rest.\n\nMore news: TNT Plans Future With Charles Barkley 'With or Without the NBA': Report\n\n\"TNT Sports and Charles Barkley today reaffirmed his long-term commitment that will see the broadcasting icon and Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer exclusively contribute to TNT Sports for many years to come,\" the release read.\n\nThe announcement confirms Barkley will fulfill the 10-year, $210 million contract with the network signed in 2022.\n\n\"I love my TNT Sports family,\" Barkley said in the release. \"My #1 priority has been and always will be our people and keeping everyone together for as long as possible. We have the most amazing people, and they are the best at what they do. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with them both on the shows we currently have and new ones we develop together in the future.\n\n\"This is the only place for me,\" Barkley continued. \"I have to say ... I've been impressed by the leadership team who is fighting hard and have been aggressive in adding new properties to TNT Sports, which I am very excited about. I appreciate them and all of my colleagues for their continued support, and most importantly our fans. I'm going to give my all as we keep them entertained for years to come.\"\n\nTNT has contracts with MLB, the NHL, NCAA, NASCAR, and U.S. men's and women's soccer. It also has the domestic rights to the French Open beginning next year.\n\nWill Barkley feature on these broadcasts as well? Luis Silberwasser, the Chairman & CEO of TNT Sports, didn't rule it out.\n\n\"Charles is one of the best and most beloved sportscasters in the history of television,\" Silberwasser said in the statement released by the network. \"I know I speak for all the members of the TNT Sports family when I say we are incredibly thrilled to share this mutual commitment to continue showcasing Charles' one-of-a-kind talents and entertain fans well into the future.\n\n\"We continue to add to the breadth and depth of our sports portfolio — including new properties in the College Football Playoffs, Roland-Garros, NASCAR, BIG EAST college basketball, Mountain West football, among others – and it's fantastic to have Charles for this journey as we develop new content ideas and shows for our fans.\""
