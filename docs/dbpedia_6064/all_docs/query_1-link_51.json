        "text": "Emotionally intense and deeply disturbing, “Shame” explores one man’s sad journey through the dark side of human behavior.\n\nout of 5 stars\n\nCast: Michael Fassbender, Carey Mulligan, James Badge Dale, Nicole Beharie\n\nDirector: Steve McQueen\n\nRating: NC-17 for nudity, graphic sexuality, language\n\nTheater: Ragtag\n\nMichael Fassbender gives a bravura performance as Brandon Sullivan, a 30-something single New Yorker who, at least outwardly, seems to have it all: He’s handsome and successful, employed by an up-and-coming high-tech company, and has a nice Midtown apartment. Behind the façade, however, lurks a dark and potentially dangerous compulsive personality disorder, in the guise of a seemingly unstoppable sexual appetite. It not only controls his life but has begun to threaten his livelihood.\n\nThe camera plays witness to all of Brandon’s sexual releases, from constant self-stimulation and vast collection of pornography, to a revolving door of prostitutes and random one-night stands. Even his work provides no real distractions, as he relieves himself in the restroom or infests his office computer with online porn. It doesn’t help that his married boss, David (James Badge Dale), considers himself a player on the singles scene.\n\nBrandon’s bleak routine is shattered when his younger sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan), unexpectedly drops in for an extended stay. Their relationship is stormy at best, and we soon realize she, too, suffers from emotional damage. Although the pair never go into detail about their childhood, we can only suspect they were subjected to some type of physical or psychological abuse. One of the film’s most-touching scenes comes when Brandon and David attend a performance by Sissy, a professional singer, at a local nightclub. Her soul-baring rendition of “New York, New York,” filmed in a single take using multiple cameras, captures the essence of the siblings’ past, present and future connection. Fassbender’s reaction to Mulligan’s performance is spontaneous, authentic and utterly heart-wrenching. It’s a powerful, chilling scene.\n\nPerhaps the most-telling event in the movie occurs when Brandon shows honest attraction to one of his co-workers, played by Nicole Beharie, only to find he is so psychologically broken, emotional desire equals physical impotency. Real feelings seem to suck the life out of Brandon.\n\nSurprisingly, this is only the second feature film from minimalist British director Steve McQueen, whose acclaimed 2008 debut, “Hunger,” also featured a memorable performance by Fassbender. By comparison, “Shame” is much more intimate but no less provocative. McQueen co-wrote the script with Abi Morgan (“The Iron Lady”), although much of it feels improvised, thanks to McQueen’s stark yet beautiful direction. The film also benefits from an outstanding soundtrack composed by Harry Escott.\n\n“Shame” has garnered an NC-17 rating in the United States, most likely for its graphic sexual content and brief scenes of full-frontal male nudity. After viewing the film, however, I question the validity of this rating. We’ve certainly witnessed much worse in many R-rated movies, from sexuality to over-the-top violence. I’m willing to bet if Fassbender didn’t bare all — accounting for mere seconds of screen time — this rating would have changed. But such is the hypocrisy of the ratings system.\n\nThe most shocking thing about this film is that Fassbender’s performance — a daring and complex portrait of a man trapped by shame and despair — was not deemed worthy of an Oscar nomination. Unbelievable. No matter how you feel about the subject matter or the movie as a whole, there’s no denying the devastating emotional impact of his role. Mulligan is likewise perfectly cast as his lost-soul sister, whose own self-destructive behavior provides clues to his demons.\n\nThe movie owes some thematic debt to movies of the 1970s and early 1980s, such as “American Gigolo,” “Taxi Driver” and “Looking For Mr. Goodbar.” Interestingly, although filmed in New York, the lead actors, director, producer and screenwriter are all from the U.K. “Shame” might not be a fun or happy experience, but its emotional imprint lingers long after leaving the theater."
