        "text": "Time to get your first look at the film all the critics are talking about. The Guardian has debuted the first UK trailer for Steve McQueen's Shame, his \"controversial\" but incredibly well-made drama about a sex addict in New York City. Michael Fassbender stars, giving one of the best performances of his life, along with Carey Mulligan as his sister, who shows up at his place throwing his life out of whack. It's one of my favorite films of the year and has been getting unanimous praise from everyone. This trailer does a perfect job capturing the tone of the film and should leave many of you very interested in seeing this. Take a look!\n\nWatch the first official UK trailer for Steve McQueen's Shame, found via The Guardian:\n\nShame is directed by Steve McQueen, who also wrote the script with Abi Morgan. The controversial and sexual drama stars Michael Fassbender as a 30-something living in New York City who can't control his sex life and sexual desire, and things get thrown out of whack when his \"fragile\" sister, played by Carey Mulligan, moves into his apartment. Fox Searchlight says, \"Steve McQueenâ€™s courageous exploration of modern life's extremes is breathtaking. He has crafted an extraordinary film that probes some of the deepest and darkest issues ever portrayed on screen.\" Fox Searchlight will bring Shame to theaters December 2nd."
