        "text": "Film Review.\n\nShame was directed by Steve McQueen. It stars Michael Fassbender as Brandon and Carey Mulligan as his sister, Sissy. Fassbender was nominated for best actor in The Golden Globes.\n\nIt’s about Bandon, he is in his thirties and he has some problems in his sex life, because he isn’t able to have a serious relationship with anyone. One day, his sister Sissy arrives in his house and she moves in with him (they didn’t have communication between them).\n\nBrandon loses control when his boss and Sissy were together one night (they have sex in Brandon’s bed). During this time, Bandon tries a relationship with a workmate, Marianne, but he can’t keep the relationship.\n\nAfter that, Bandon and Sissy argue and claim for the way to live their sex, love and family life. Both let see the worst part of themselves. Bandon Kicks her out his house and he goes to different places at night having discussions, fights and sex with strangers.\n\nWhile this happens, Sissy fails to commit suicide, because Brandon finds her on the bathroom floor and he saves her life (Sissy tries it, because she fears being along).\n\nIn the end, Bandon reflection on his life and how he relates to others.\n\nWell… I really recommend Shame. It has a very real thing: People don’t change, they only do it if they want it.\n\nOther reason is its soundtrack.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Harry Scott. At the beginning of the film, the soundtrack gives weight to the first sequence that shows us the loneliness and tragedy of Bandon’s life.\n\nThe soundtrack includes Bach songs are performed by Glenn Gould, also includes Chet Baker, John Coltrane, Blondie and CHIC songs.\n\nThe soundtrack makes magical the film!"
