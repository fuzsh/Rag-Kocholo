On 20th February, we will be showing Steve McQueen’s Shame (2011), introduced by Dr Katherine Angel. Full details can be found below.\n\nShame (Steve McQueen, 2011)\n\nIntroduced by Dr Katherine Angel\n\nShame is written and directed by Steve McQueen, Turner Prize-winning video artist and director of Hunger and 12 Years A Slave. Widely glossed (including by McQueen himself) as a film about sex addiction, Shame is a fine-grained portrait of sexual compulsion and suffering. Michael Fassbender plays Brandon, an office worker in New York in his mid-thirties whose routine is peppered with somewhat joyless pornography use, masturbation, the chasing of casual encounters, and visits from sex workers. Brandon’s sister (Carey Mulligan) comes to visit, which creates tensions in which Brandon’s suffering peaks. Shame is a film that reveals contemporary anxieties about pornography and addiction, while reflecting deftly on questions of humiliation, aggression, gender, and power.\n\nDr Katherine Angel is Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at the Centre for the History of Emotions at Queen Mary. She is the author of Unmastered: A Book On Desire, Most Difficult To Tell, a work of literary non-fiction published in the UK, the US, Germany and the Netherlands. She is currently writing a book on Female Sexual Dysfunction and conducting research on psychiatric classification in the US and Europe.\n\nScreenings take place in the Hitchcock cinema, on the ground floor of Arts One (building 37 on this map: http://www.qmul.ac.uk/docs/about/26065.pdf), beginning at 6.00pm.\n\nAttendance is free but space is limited.
