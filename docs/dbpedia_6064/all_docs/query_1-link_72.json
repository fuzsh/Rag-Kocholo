        "text": "Michael Fassbender's provocative movie Shame has been banned from release in Singapore after director Steve Mcqueen refused to cut an explicit sex scene.\n\nOfficials at the country's Media Development Authority (MDA) ruled the critically-acclaimed film, which garnered Golden Globes and BAFTA Awards nominations, could only be shown to moviegoers aged 21 and over if the key segment, featuring a threesome, was edited.\n\nBut McQueen refused to cut his film just to please the censors.\n\nA representative for local distributor Cathay-Keris Films tells AFP: \"They did not request for the entire scene to be cut, just that they felt the scene was too long (sic).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Mr McQueen feels that it is important for his work to be seen in the way it was intended and hence was... not agreeable to have his film be cut in any way."
