Dodgers signed INF Luis Cruz to a minor league contract.

The contract includes a spring training invite. Cruz, who turns 28 in February, .hit 273/.301/.433 in 69 games this past season with Triple-A Round Rock in the Rangers’ system and also played 16 games in the Mexican League. He has an awful .221/.275/.260 batting line over 154 career at-bats in the big leagues and is unlikely to make a major impact with the Dodgers.

Luis Cruz went 3-for-5 with three RBI and a run scored in a win over the Pirates on Tuesday.

Cruz, who made the start at second base, had RBI singles in the fourth and sixth inning. It was his first three-hit game since September 12, 2008 as a member of the Pirates. The 28-year-old should be in the mix for additional playing time at third base while Jerry Hairston, Jr. (hip) is on the disabled list, but he’s unlikely to help much in fantasy leagues.

Dee Gordon (thumb) is not in Thursday’s lineup against the Diamondbacks.

Gordon suffered a dislocated right thumb while stealing third base during Wednesday’s game. He was scheduled to undergo an MRI on Thursday, so the Dodgers should have an update on his status soon. Luis Cruz will make the start at shortstop.

Luis Cruz launched a three-run homer in Monday’s win over the Cardinals.

The blast in the second inning just cleared the wall in left field and gave the Dodgers a lead that they wouldn’t relinquish. Cruz has been the regular shortstop since Dee Gordon’s injury and has started to hit a bit of late, putting together a modest six-game hit streak that includes a pair of homers and eight RBI.

Juan Uribe (ankle) has been scratched from the Dodgers’ lineup Tuesday night against the Reds.

Luis Cruz will start at third base. Uribe suffered a mild right ankle sprain in Monday’s series-opener and is considered day-to-day. He’s batting .200/.259/.280.

Dodgers purchased the contract of INF Luis Cruz from Triple-A Albuquerque.

Cruz, 28, was hitting .318/.348/.529 with eight homers, 46 RBI and an .877 OPS over 74 games this season at the Triple-A level. However, his .690 OPS in the minors is far more indicative of his skill offensively. He can be ignored in fantasy leagues.
