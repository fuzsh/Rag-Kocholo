        "text": "Slowest Average Bat Speeds\n\nWhat about at the other end of the scale? Here are the 25 lowest average bat speeds.\n\nThe adage continues to hold true: As a hitter, you’d rather have bat speed than not. If you don’t, there are still ways to succeed, it’s just going to be a tougher path, and power will likely not be a part of your game.\n\nOf the bottom 25, the median batting average is .232, the median on-base percentage is .314 and the median slugging percentage is .329. All three are below MLB averages. Having a slow bat and struggling to hit often go hand in hand.\n\nBut the bottom 25 also includes some of the best pure hitters in baseball. Marlins second baseman Luis Arraez is an example of how a hitter can succeed with a slower bat. Arraez has the second slowest average bat speed in the majors, and he’s going to win a second straight batting title. Steven Kwan’s numbers have regressed this season, but he’s a productive hitter with below-average power. The same can be said for Whit Merrifield.\n\nThese are average bat speed readings, so this also in some ways measures how often hitters truly let loose in their swings versus using a more controlled swing to emphasize contact ability.\n\nThe hitters at the bottom of the bat speed rankings as a rule seem to focus more on contact. The average strikeout rate for the bottom 25 in bat speed is 22.9%. The average strikeout rate for the top 25 in average bat speed is 25.5%. Of the top 10 in the majors in lowest strikeout rate, Ronald Acuña is the only one whose average bat speed is above the median of 68.1 mph.\n\nWhat you don’t find at the bottom of the bat speed rankings is significant power. No hitter among this bottom 25 has hit 15 home runs this season. The Top 25 average a home run every 18.9 plate appearances. The bottom 25 average one every 74.1 .\n\nWhich Stats Correlate To Bat Speed\n\nWe can also run correlations to see how average bat speed correlates to a variety of statistics. They following are ranked in order of correlation. A 1.0 correlation means two data points have a perfect correlation, while a -1.0 value would indicate they are perfectly negatively correlation.\n\nStrongly Correlated\n\nMaximum exit velocity (.749)\n\nModerately Correlated\n\nExpected Weighted On-Base Average On Contact (.621)\n\nAverage exit velocity (.577)\n\nHome Run Rate (.505)\n\nExpected Slugging (.503)\n\nIsolated Power (.501)\n\nHome Runs (.462)\n\nStrikeouts (.433)\n\nSlugging Percentage (.405)\n\nTotal Bases (.305)\n\nOn-Base Percentage (.025) and Batting Average (.058) showed very weak correlations to average bat speed.\n\nOnce there is more data, other avenues can be explored. A player who increases his bat speed significantly from one season to the next is likely demonstrating the potential for added power. Similarly, seeing how aging players’ bat speed deteriorates over multiple seasons will be a useful study, especially when comparing it to how that player performs offensively.\n\nScatter plots can help show the relationships between various metrics. When it comes to average exit velocity and bat speed, there is a clear relationship. Most players with higher average bat speeds also post higher average exit velocities. Of course, there are outliers.\n\nBut when it comes to weighted on-base average (wOBA) a stat that tries to measure the entirety of a player’s offensive contributions, looking at it and average bat speed shows much less of a relationship.\n\nIt’s possible that, much like exit velocity, a measurement of the 90th percentile bat speed may be more useful than an average. We do not have that to study, but looking at maximum bat speed gives us an indication of how, for some players, the ability to get to faster bat speed when needed provides power.\n\nHere’s a look at how average bat speed and home runs per plate appearance compare:\n\nMaximum Bat Speed\n\nSo far, we’ve been focused on average bat speed, but we also need to examine maximum bat speed. A hitter who swings in a very controlled manner in some counts but gives their “A swing” in advantageous counts might show up more for maximum bat speed than average bat speed. While the median average bat speed in the majors this year is 68.1 mph, the median maximum bat speed is 80.8 mph.\n\nAnd here’s a similar scatter plot to the previous one, but looking at maximum bat speed vs. home runs per plate appearance. Josh Donaldson’s home run rate goes from a massive outlier when looking at average bat speed to more normal when comparing to maximum bat speed. Nelson Velazquez is the slugger sitting at a hard-to-fathom home run every 10 plate appearances at the 78 mph avg bat speed mark.\n\nHere are the 10 fastest maximum bat speeds:\n\nAnd here are the bottom 10 as far as maximum bat speed:\n\nComparing Average And Max Bat Speed Differences\n\nHere’s a look at the players who have the biggest differences between their average bat speed and their maximum bat speed.\n\nHere are the players with the least difference between their average and maximum bat speeds.\n\nThere are no clear and discernible patterns I can find among hitters whose average and maximum bat speeds are significantly different or those who have the smallest differences. Because maximum bat speed is a one-time event, it’s probably less valuable as information than a look at 90th-percentile bat speed, but since we do not have that data, that’s just a guess for now.\n\nThere are so many other avenues we could explore, but here’s one other interesting tidbit. With switch-hitters, we can drill down to look at their average bat speed from either side of the plate. Braves second baseman Ozzie Albies has long had an extremely noticeable split between his righthanded swing and his lefthanded swing. For his career, he has a .247/.308/.442 slash line against righthanders and a .336/.363/.568 slash line against lefties.\n\nA Switch-Hitter Snapshot\n\nSo what do the bat speed measurements show? Is Albies able to swing faster as a righthanded hitter than he can as a lefthanded hitter?\n\nThe answer is yes and no. Albies does show higher average bat speed from the right side, but his max bat speed is higher from the left side, and his exit velocity is basically the same from both sides.\n\nBat Speed For All MLB Hitters\n\nHere are the average and maximum bat speeds for every MLB hitter with 70 or more plate appearances so far this season. All stats included are as of the end of games on Sept. 10."
