        "text": "GLENDALE, Ariz. – The moving boxes scattered about the Dodgers’ spring training clubhouse at Camelback Ranch reflected a baseball team on the verge of returning home to start the regular season.\n\nThe boxes belonged to individual players, their names prominently written in black ink on both sides and their personal belongings packed neatly inside. Soon they’d be taped up and loaded onto the moving truck parked outside.\n\nDestination, Los Angeles.\n\nThe boxes were more than just a means to transport personal property, though. They were a badge of honor of sorts, proof you made enough of an impression to earn a job and head north with the Dodgers.\n\nWhich made the box with the name Luis Cruz written on it so fascinating.\n\nLess than a year after seemingly coming out of nowhere to help stabilize the left side of the Dodgers infield but more than a decade after beginning a long, frustrating grind that seemed destined to end as an obscure, career minor-leaguer, the 29-year-old Cruz is on his way to Los Angeles as a member of the Dodgers.\n\nAfter playing more than 1,200 minor-league games with four different organizations in cities like Altoona and Fort Wayne and Mobile and Round Rock – just good enough to fill a position in an organization but never quite excellent enough to earn a spot in the big leagues – Cruz was breaking camp as the Dodgers’ starting shortstop, where he will play until Hanley Ramirez returns from a thumb injury sometime in May or June.\n\nAt which point Cruz is expected to slide back to third base, a job he earned over 78 solid games through the final two months of last season and then cemented with a steady, effective performance this spring.\n\nIn short, Cruz finally made it.\n\n“Everything he’s been through, there’s a lot of perseverance in there,” Dodgers first baseman Adrian Gonzalez said.\n\nAnd that box headed to Los Angeles with his name written on it proved it.\n\n“It means everything,” Cruz said, his mind wandering to Opening Day on Monday, when he will stand at attention during the national anthem at Dodger Stadium. Scattered somewhere in the sold-out stadium will be his entire family, each member making the trip from his native Mexico to cheer him on.\n\nIncluding one very proud father.\n\nThe elder Luis Cruz is a former Mexican League baseball legend whose career fell short of the major leagues. To be at Opening Day to watch his son play for the Dodgers will complete a dream that has spanned two lifetimes.\n\n“It’s going to be big. For me and for him,” Cruz said. “He never got the chance to play in the big leagues so I’m living his dream in my dream, together. It’s going to be special.”\n\nJust being there will be significant for Cruz.\n\nFor the first time in his career he’s an every-day member of a big-league team, and nestled in his back pocket is a little bit of security in the form of an organization that believes in him.\n\nIn other words, everything he never truly had over a 12-year career in which a lack of faith, politics and a numbers game always worked against him.\n\nEverywhere Cruz went someone was in front of him, a hot-shot prospect or a higher-paid veteran, blocking his path to the big leagues and chaining him to the minors.\n\n“I was always the back-up,” he said.\n\nThere was one season in 2009 with Pittsburgh when he broke camp with the Pirates, but he played just one game that April before getting sent down to the minors. He ended up playing 27 games that year with Pittsburgh before being released at the end of the season.\n\nA year later, Cruz played in seven games with Milwaukee but spent two more years in the Brewers’ organization without reaching the majors and was released in 2011.\n\nIn all, Cruz played just 56 big-league games over his first 11 professional seasons.\n\nAnd it wasn’t like he was making an impression on anyone.\n\n“I probably seen him somewhere but it didn’t register,” Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. “He was a name on a roster, seen an at-bat here or an at-bat there. He was (a guy) hitting seventh somewhere in Pittsburgh or hitting eighth. You don’t even notice. If he doesn’t do something that day you don’t really think about him much past that.”\n\nCruz basically was your quintessential career minor leaguer, a curse that has snuffed out more than a few dreams over the years.\n\n“Those guys can get lost or give up pretty easily,” Mattingly said. “You’re at it for a long time and you’re going from team to team, you’re traveling, you’ve got a family, you’re going from place to place.\n\n“Minor-league life is not a great life as far as having a family and kids. A lot of those guys give up.”\n\nFor some reason, Cruz kept at it.\n\n“I was hungry to be in the big leagues and I knew I could play here. I just never had a real chance to play,” Cruz said. “But you just keep waiting and waiting for that chance and then try to take advantage of it when it comes.”\n\nThat opportunity arrived last season in the form of a midsummer call-up by the Dodgers, who needed a replacement for injured shortstop Dee Gordon.\n\nUnlike his previous time in the big leagues, when the pressure of trying to make an impression took him out of his game, Cruz calmly settled in.\n\nHe didn’t overwhelm anyone; he just got the job done. He didn’t stand out, he just fit in. And while he rarely ended up on the highlight shows, he earned Mattingly’s trust by consistently making the routine plays.\n\n“He, just kind of steady, caught everything,” Mattingly said. “Nothing spectacular looking or anything, he just made all the plays, and that steadied us right there.”\n\nAnd much to the surprise of everyone, he began hitting.\n\n“Which gave us a lift,” Mattingly said.\n\nAnd kept Cruz in the lineup, even when Ramirez arrived and took over at shortstop.\n\n“When we put him at third, he did the same thing,” Mattingly said. “He was able to hit and he played a great third base.”\n\nCruz hit .297 with six home runs and 40 RBIs in 78 games and made enough of an impression on the Dodgers they comfortably penciled him in as a starter heading into 2013.\n\nFor the career minor leaguer, it was the first real job security he ever had.\n\nNot that he took anything for granted. He spent the off-season working out with Gonzalez intent not only on winning a job but keeping it.\n\n“I prepared more this off-season than ever before because I knew I had a chance to come here and compete for a job,” Cruz said.\n\nGonzalez said he was impressed.\n\n“It was nice to see that sense of `I’m going to keep getting better, I’m not going to give up”‘ Gonzalez said.\n\nThe added work enabled Cruz to shed 12 pounds, increased his quickness and range and allowed him to seamlessly slide from third base to shortstop in Ramirez’s absence.\n\nMeanwhile, by trusting his batting technique – and consulting by phone with his father after every game – rather than continually altering it to fit a particular type team or style, Cruz is more confident than ever at the plate.\n\nIt’s only spring, mind you, but through Monday he was hitting .298 with a .327 on-base percentage, a .638 slugging percentage and a .965 OPS with four home runs and nine RBIs.\n\nHe’s not just heading into the regular season. He’s soaring into it.\n\n“I feel good, I feel confident,” Cruz said.\n\nAnd that is quite a change compared to the previous 12 years of his career.\n\nvincent.bonsignore@dailynews.com"
