        "text": "Fernand Cruz – Pic via his Instagram\n\nStarting around 8 AM central time, the 2024 international free agent signing will begin. It will run through the middle of December of this year, but all of the major signings will take place today.\n\nThe Cubs are slated to sign shortstop Fernando Cruz to a bonus somewhere close to $4 million. Cruz is one of the top ranked players in this year‘s class and is also the cousin of former Cub shortstop Starlin Castro, but Cruz is his own player and has been lauded for his ability to go the other way, as well as having outstanding bat control with his forearms and wrists. He also has an above average arm. It’ll be interesting to see the exact amount that he signed for today.\n\nWhile some of you may want a comp today or a ranking, that’s going to be extremely hard to do as he has yet to play in a game that matters. Those rankings and evaluations will come later, but I would not be surprised to see him anywhere from a top 20 prospect this summer or, if things go well, a top 10 in the fall/offseason.\n\nIn early March, we should have a couple of things happen in order to get a better fix on Cruz’s talents, and possibilities. One way for us to do that is if he is in minor league spring training in Mesa. That would mean that he’s not going to play in the Dominican this summer and will debut in the Arizona Complex League in early June.\n\nBefore that, MLB pipeline is going to release their top 30 Cubs list in early March. We should get to see a little preview of what others think of him before we actually get to see him ourselves.\n\nThe Cubs are also slated to sign outfielder Robin Ortiz from the Dominican today. The adjective that keeps coming up on him is power, and that applies to both his bat and arm. We shall see if he signs this morning.\n\nThe only other name I’ve seen besides Ortiz and Cruz is pitcher Yander Maria, who throws right-handed. And that’s all we know about Maria as I haven’t gotten any info from where he’s from. I would assume he’s from the Dominican.\n\nI will be back at 8 AM when the Cruz news is made official. And then I’ll be reporting off and on throughout the day. See you then!\n\n8 AM\n\nThe Cubs got busy early signing the following players per Baseball America:\n\nFernando Cruz, SS, Dominican Republic\n\nRobin Ortiz, OF, Dominican Republic\n\nYander Maria, RHP, Dominican Republic\n\nDiego Gonzalez, C, Venezuela\n\nFrailin Alejo, RHP, Dominican Republic\n\nJuan Monzo, SS, Dominican Republic\n\nThe Cubs have $5.152,200 in their pool.\n\nYander Maria getting some pub over at BA, too.\n\n8:30 AM\n\nMy favorite part of IFA Day is seeing the pics roll in from the academies of the players. It is a life changing day for most.\n\nEventually, the Cubs will release a list of signees with a brief bio. That could come today, tomorrow, or even later. You never know.\n\nFrom the looks of it, MLB Pipeline looks to be dropping a “team article” for each organization. That could be interesting. I will keep an eye out on that.\n\n9 AM\n\nBest part of the article:\n\nCruz sports a tantalizing set of tools that brim with upside. Known as a hitter capable of spraying the ball to all fields because of his tremendously strong hands and forearms, Cruz has enough strength in his swing to enable him to hit the ball to right field as if he were a left-handed batter. With an easy load and superb bat speed, his sound offensive approach will lend itself to 20-to-25 homer power as he matures. Despite being known as an aggressive swinger, he has an advanced feel for the barrel.\n\n9:30 – As for Maria\n\nGot some screenshots from the video. Lot to like in that video. Nice live arm, good movement, projectable body.\n\nI also got some video of Ortiz popping one off on YouTube\n\nAlso got some pics of new pitcher Frailin Alejo via his Instagram.\n\n11 AM\n\nThere is not a lot happening right now. As usual, this day tends to run in spurts. We get some names, go find some pics and video, and then do it again.\n\nRight now would be a good time to reflect on the 6 person (so far) class.\n\nI must say that Fernando Cruz is the star of the class, but Maria is the star of the day. I am impressed so far with his projectability along with his frame and the looseness of his delivery. It does not look max effort at all.\n\nAs most of you know, the signing period runs through the middle of December. The Cubs normally add a lot of names in May and then again in November and December. If you want to, you can bookmark our IFA database to keep up with the signings.\n\nWhat is nice about the signing period being in January if we only have to wait five months for this class to debut. Under the old system, we had to wait 11 months. Ugh!\n\nMost of these players will begin in the Dominican Summer League. I would not be surprised to see someone make it to Mesa at some point this year. Remember, two years ago, Alfredo Zarraga debuted at Myrtle Beach. You never know.\n\nI will be back after a while, hopefully with some signing pics!\n\n1 PM\n\nNo pics from the academy just yet…except one.\n\n4 PM\n\nCubs signed four more this afternoon!\n\nEzequiel Peña, SS, Dominican Republic\n\nEnyel Rosario, SS, Dominican Republic\n\nEdgardo de Leon, SS, Dominican Republic\n\nJulian Duran, RHP, Dominican Republic\n\nTime to go get some info!\n\n6:30 PM\n\nOF Cesar Lugo, VZ\n\nOF Jesus Rodriguez, VZ\n\n2B Isaac Moscote – Colombia\n\nI think I am done for the day"
