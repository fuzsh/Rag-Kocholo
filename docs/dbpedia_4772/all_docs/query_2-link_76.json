        "text": "In February 2004, Major League Baseball announced a new drug policy which originally included random, offseason testing and 10-day suspensions for first-time offenders, 30 days for second-time offenders, 60 days for third-time offenders, and one year for fourth-time offenders, all without pay, in an effort to curtail performance-enhancing drug use (PED) in professional baseball. This policy strengthened baseball's pre-existing ban on controlled substances, including steroids, which has been in effect since 1991.[1] The policy was to be reviewed in 2008, but under pressure from the U.S. Congress, on November 15, 2005, players and owners agreed to tougher penalties; a 50-game suspension for a first offense, a 100-game suspension for a second, and a lifetime ban for a third.\n\nIn December 2009, Sports Illustrated named baseball's steroid scandal of performance-enhancing drugs as the number one sports story of the decade of the 2000s.[2]\n\nThe current penalties, adopted on March 28, 2014, are 80 games for a first offense, 162 games for a second offense, and a permanent suspension (\"lifetime ban\") for a third.[3] Players are also ineligible from participating in the post-season the same year they receive a suspension, regardless of when their suspension is completed, unless the penalty is reduced on appeal.[4] Players receiving a permanent suspension would be able apply to the Commissioner of Baseball for reinstatement after one year, which, if granted, can occur not sooner than two years after the suspension started.[3]\n\nSuspended players\n\n[edit]\n\nPlayers are ordered by the announced date of their suspension, placed in the appropriate table per their MLB experience and roster status at the time they were suspended. Players who are active in professional baseball (not limited to MLB) are listed in italics; players who have retired or have been a free agent for over a year are not considered \"active\".\n\nKey * Major League Baseball All-Star MVP Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player SS Silver Slugger Award winner GG Gold Glove award winner P Pitcher C Catcher 1B First baseman 2B Second baseman 3B Third baseman SS Shortstop OF Outfielder DH Designated hitter UT Utility player † Player was named in the Mitchell Report (may or may not be related to suspension) (#) Number of times the player was suspended (if more than once) Italics Currently active ^ Suspension lasted more than 100 games\n\nPlayers who were on major league rosters\n\n[edit]\n\nPlayers listed in this section were active in MLB at the time of their suspension.\n\nPlayer Team Date announced Drug Penalty Position Response Ref.
