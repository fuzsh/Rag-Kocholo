        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — Next!\n\nWhen manager Joe Girardi put Luis Cruz in last night’s lineup at short, the recently released Dodger became the fifth player to start at the position Derek Jeter has yet to occupy this season.\n\nCruz, 29, signed a free-agent contract with the Yankees on Tuesday, when the Yankees didn’t believe Jayson Nix’s right hamstring problem was that big of a deal. Nevertheless, Wednesday morning an MRI exam uncovered a Grade 2 strain. Nix was put on the 15-day disabled list, but it would be an upset if he returns as soon as he is eligible.\n\n“I was surprised,’’ said Nix, who suffered the injury running out a double Monday night and didn’t play Tuesday. “I feel it improved [Wednesday] morning, it felt good. I went for the MRI and it didn’t come back good.’’\n\nCruz played in 49 games this year for the Dodgers and has experience at short, second, third first and limited time in the outfield. He hit .127 (15-for-118) and was designated for assignment June 28. The right-handed hitter is a career .240 batter.\n\nCruz, who traveled from L.A. Wednesday, batted eighth, went 0-for-3 and made a throwing error in the Yankees’ 3-2 victory, his Bombers’ debut.\n\nCruz said an issue with his father contributed to the low batting average with the Dodgers. It’s a situation that is cleared up, he said.\n\n“It happened kind of quick,’’ Cruz said of becoming a Yankee. “I wanted to take a chance and I am here now.’’\n\nBecause he wanted to see what he had in Cruz, Girardi started Cruz instead of Alberto Gonzalez despite Gonzalez going 2-for-4 with three RBIs and a sensational catch Tuesday night.\n\nAccording to Girardi, Nix wanted to avoid the DL.\n\n“Nixy is tough and he didn’t necessarily want to go on the DL but we just felt that no one that we have ever had that has had a Grade 2 didn’t go on the DL,’’ Girardi said. “I think we were all surprised. Our hope is that we get him back after the All-Star break but we are going to wait and see.’’\n\nAs for Eduardo Nunez and Jeter, Girardi had no timetable for their return from the DL. Nunez is playing minor league rehab games and will move up to Double-A Trenton Thursday night. The Yankees haven’t announced when Jeter will start an assignment.\n\n“You have to make sure he is ready and you don’t want to bring up a player who isn’t ready to be productive,’’ Girardi said of Nunez, who has been out since May 5 with a left oblique strain. “That has to take its course. He has a little ways to go.’’\n\nNunez is eligible to come off the 60-day DL tomorrow, but that is a long shot at this point. Asked if Jeter could start a rehab assignment shortly, Girardi guessed.\n\n“Every day he goes out there I think he is closer [to a rehab assignment],’’ Girardi said of Jeter who is working out in Tampa. “He has done a lot more and hopefully it’s pretty soon.’’\n\nJeter ran the bases Wednesday during simulated at-bats at Steinbrenner Field. He had six at-bats against two right-handed pitchers which produced two singles, a double and three ground outs.\n\n* Mariano Rivera walked into the Yankees’ clubhouse Wednesday and into the arms of MLB’s drug testers who informed Rivera it was his turn to provide a urine sample.\n\nAccording to Rivera, who posted his 28th save, he hadn’t been tested since spring training.\n\n* The Yankees and Dominican Republic shortstop Yonauris Rodriguez agreed to a $570,000 deal. That’s almost one-third of the Yankees’ $1.8 million pool to sign international players.\n\nYankees continue to be the favorite to land Dominican center fielder Leonardo Molina, but he can’t sign until he turns 16 early next month.\n\n* Girardi supported Manny Ramirez’s decision to join the Rangers’ organization via a minor league contract.\n\n“I think it’s a guy who loves the game and just wants to continue to play,’’ Girardi said. “If that’s what you want to do I think it’s great. You don’t ever want to feel like you took the uniform off sooner than you should have.’’\n\n* With a victory Wednesday night, CC Sabathia became the eighth pitcher since 1961 to win 200 games before turning 33.\n\nSabathia turns 33 on July 21.\n\nOther hurlers since 1961 to reach 200 wins before turning 33 are Don Drysdale, Catfish Hunter, Ferguson Jenkins, Greg Maddux, Juan Marichal, Jim Palmer and Tom Seaver"
