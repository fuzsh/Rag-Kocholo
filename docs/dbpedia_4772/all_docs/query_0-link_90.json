        "text": "PITTSBURGH — Aided by an Oneil Cruz throwing error, David Bednar blew his second-straight save as the San Diego Padres completed the series sweep with a 7-6 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nRecap\n\nWith two outs in the top of the first inning, Manny Machado hit a 2-2 hanging slider over the left field fence to put the Padres (64-52) out in front early.\n\nThe following inning, David Peralta connected on a two-run shot down the right field line to double San Diego’s lead.\n\nAfter Peralta’s homer, Ortiz settled in and retired 10 in a row and 14 of the final 16 batters he faced. Ortiz allowed four runs on four hits in six innings. He walked a batter and struck out three. Padres starter Randy Vásquez carried a shutout into the sixth before the Pirates (56-58) struck for three runs.\n\nOneil Cruz hit a liner off the base of the center field wall which allowed Bryan Reynolds to score. Cruz was thrown out trying to advance to second base. Later in the inning, Rowdy Tellez scored on a Carl Edwards Jr. wild pitch and Ji Hwan Bae hit an opposite-field single to left to bring the Pirates within a run.\n\nWith Cruz on first base and one out in the seventh, Bart belted a payoff pitch from Yuki Matsui over the notch in left-center field to give the Pirates their first lead\n\nBednar (3-4) allowed a leadoff single followed by a walk to Jackson Merrill. After striking out David Peralta, Bednar walked Ha-Seong Kim to load the bases with one out for catcher Kyle Higashioka.\n\nHigashioka bounced one to second baseman Isiah Kiner-Falefa, who flipped to Cruz at short for the out. On what would have been a bang-bang play at first, Cruz delivered an errant throw which allowed the go-ahead run to score.\n\nLuis Arraez doubled home Higashioka to put the Padres ahead 7-5 and knocked Bednar out of the game. Kyle Nicolas recorded the final out.\n\nRowdy Tellez singled home Bart in the ninth, but Robert Suarez struck out Bryan De La Cruz for his 25th save of the season.\n\nWith the loss, the Pirates have dropped four in a row and six of their last seven games.\n\nKey Moment\n\nIf Cruz had delivered an accurate throw to first, it looked like the Pirates could have walked away with a win, or at the very least, kept the game tied. Instead, San Diego took the lead and added on to lift them to a win.\n\nStar of the Game\n\nJoey Bart finished 2 for 5 with a homer, a double two RBIs and two runs scored. He’s driven in seven runs over his last six games.\n\nStat to Know\n\nKe’Bryan Hayes finished 2 for 3 with a walk. It was his third multi-hit game in August. Hayes is batting .389 (7 for 18) since the start of the month.\n\nNoteworthy\n\nDespite holding a lead in five of the six games played this home stand, the Pirates only managed one win.\n\nThe Pirates placed RHP Colin Holderman on the 15-day injured list with a right wrist sprain. RHP Ben Heller was selected from Triple-A Indianapolis and outfielder Edward Olivares was designated for assignment.\n\nRHP Jared Jones (right lat strain) and OF Joshua Palacios (left hamstring strain) will begin rehab assignments with Indianapolis on Thursday.\n\nUp Next"
