        "text": "CLINTON, IOWA -- Peoria Chiefs All-Star lefty Austin Gomber struck out a career-high 10 hitters while catcher Luis Cruz earned a victory by pitching the final two innings of a 15-inning battle in a 7-4 victory over the Clinton LumberKings on Saturday before 915 at Ashford University Field.\n\nGomber allowed just three hits over 5 2/3 innings. But the Chiefs bullpen couldn't hold it as reliever Cody Schumacher allowed a two-run homer in the eighth to Joseph DeCarlo that tied the game.\n\nThey battled on into extra innings, where emergency reliever Cruz came in and pitched a 1-2-3 inning in the 14th on just four pitches.\n\nPeoria then took a 7-4 lead in the 15th when Jake Gronsky delivered a one-out, two-run triple to right-center and leadoff hitter Darren Seferina added an RBI-single up the middle.\n\nCruz closed it out in the 15th with another 1-2-3 inning.\n\nCHIEFS BRIEFS\n\n** Chiefs catcher Steve Bean had a triple, double and single.\n\n** Newly-assigned outfielder Harrison Bader, the Cards' third-round pick in 2015, added two more hits and a walk and now is batting .381 after five games in the Midwest League.\n\n** Clinton left 10 runners on base in the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th innings. The Chiefs escaped a bases-loaded jam in the ninth when lefty Nick Lomascolo struck out All-Star Estarlyn Morales to force extra innings and again in the 11th when Kevin Alexander whiffed Gianfranco Wawoe.\n\n** Last Chiefs position player to earn a win as a pitcher was shortstop Kenny Soccoro, who threw two innings on May 29, 2012 in a 4-3 home win against Wisconsin.\n\nSUNDAY'S MATCHUP\n\nPeoria, RHP Jack Flaherty (4-1, 2.70) vs. Clinton RHP Tyler Herb (4-5, 5.04), Ashford University Field, 2 p.m.\n\nInternet broadcast: www.peoriachiefs.com/listenlive."
