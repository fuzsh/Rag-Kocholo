        "text": "The Cincinnati Reds didn’t have a hit until the 4th inning, but once they got one they just kept on going. Cincinnati would score five runs in the 4th, two more in the 5th, and then cap things off with four in the 6th as they blew out the Pittsburgh Pirates 11-5 to open up the 3-game series with a win at home.\n\nFinal R H E Pittsburgh Pirates (37-41)\n\n5 10 1 Cincinnati Reds (37-41)\n\n11 12 1 W: Spiers (1-1) L: Falter (3-6) Box Score | Game Thread\n\nNeither team did a whole lot through the first two innings of the game, but the Pirates got things going in the 3rd inning with three singles that led to a run to put Pittsburgh up 1-0.\n\nThe Reds didn’t have a hit through the first three innings, but Jonathan India broke up the no-hitter with a leadoff single in the 4th. Elly De La Cruz followed up with a single of his own. Spencer Steer then doubled in two runs to get Cincinnati on the board and put them in front. Tyler Stephenson then legged out an infield hit on a chopper to third to put runners on the corners. Both runners would come around to score on a double by Stuart Fairchild, who then took third on a throwing error on the play. Levi Jordan then came through with a sacrifice fly to make it 5-1 and give him the first RBI of his big league career.\n\nPittsburgh wasn’t going to just roll over, and they went to work against Carson Spiers with three straight singles to center to begin the inning, with the last one being an RBI hit for Yasmani Grandal. The Pirates picked up another run on a force out to cut the Reds lead down to 5-3.\n\nThe home team bounced right back. Jonathan India doubled into left center to lead off the bottom of the 5th against new Pirates pitcher and former Reds minor leaguer Justin Bruihl. He then came around to score on a grounder up the middle by Elly De La Cruz, who somehow turned it into a double (the somehow is that he’s faster than lightning). That extended Cincinnati’s lead to 6-3. After Bruihl struck out Jeimer Candelario, Pittsburgh made a call to the bullpen. Dennis Santana didn’t fare much better as he gave up an RBI single to Spencer Steer before he was hit by a comebacker, but recovered to record the out on the play.\n\nCincinnati kept things rolling in the bottom of the 6th inning. Levi Jordan picked up a double off of the wall in right field with one out – his first big league hit – before coming around to score on a single by Luke Maile. Jonathan India followed up with a double to bring in Maile and make it 9-3. Then Elly De La Cruz hit a 2-run homer that landed on the deck of the riverboat above the batters eye in center to put an exclamation point on the 4-run inning.\n\nWith a big lead, the Reds turned the game over to Fernando Cruz in the 7th. He would walk Andrew McCutchen with one out and then Oneil Cruz hit a ball 458 feet into the seats in right center to make it 11-5.\n\nLucas Sims worked around a walk for a scoreless 8th inning. Justin Wilson came out of the bullpen for the top of the 9th inning. He gave up a 2-out single to Bryan Reynolds and then Oniel Cruz followed up with a single of his own to put runners on the corners. The Pirates then went to their bench to bring in pinch hitter Connor Joe and Wilson walked him to load the bases. That brought pitching coach Derek Johnson to the mound for a discussion. Wilson had to battle, reaching a full count, but he struck out Nick Gonzalez to end the game.\n\nKey Moment of the Game\n\nThe entire 4-run 7th inning, which really cemented the game for the Reds.\n\nNotes Worth Noting\n\nJonathan India and Elly De La Cruz each had three hits and two extra-base hits.
