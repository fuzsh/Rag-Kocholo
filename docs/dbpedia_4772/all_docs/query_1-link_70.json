        "text": "Dodgers infielder Luis Cruz has cleared waivers but declined his assignment to Triple-A Albuquerque, the club announced on Tuesday before their game against the Rockies at Coors Field, per Dylan Hernandez of the LA Times. Cruz is now a free agent.\n\nCruz, 29, was designated for assignment on Friday to make room on the active roster for outfielder Scott Van Slyke, who was activated from the disabled list. Cruz, who is out of options, had the right to decline his minor league assignment because he had been previously outrighted to the minors in his career.\n\nIt has been a rough year for Cruz, who was handed the third base job out of spring training. Cruz, who had a dream season almost out of nowhere in 2012, hitting .297/.322/.431 with 20 doubles and 40 RBI in 78 games, hit just .127/.175/.169 in 2013. In 45 games, he had 15 hits in 118 at-bats.\n\nCruz will now likely sign a minor league deal elsewhere, and add to his 4,891 career minor league plate appearances as he tries to work his way back to the majors.\n\nOverall in 123 games with the Dodgers, Cruz hit .247/.278/.354 with seven home runs and 22 doubles in 424 plate appearances.\n\nIn other roster news, the Rockies placed outfielder Dexter Fowler on the 15-day disabled list with a bone bruise in his right hand, and have activated relief pitcher Edgmer Escalona from the disabled list. Fowler was originally slated to play center field and bat leadoff for the Rockies on Friday, but he was scratched.\n\nTyler Colvin now starts in center, batting eighth, giving Clayton Kershaw another left-handed batter to face.\n\nGame info\n\nTime: 5:40 p.m.\n\nTV: KCAL"
