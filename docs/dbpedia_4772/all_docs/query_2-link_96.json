        "text": "BY WILL GRAVES\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) â Josh Lowe homered twice, including a three-run blast in the sixth that broke open a close game, and the Tampa Bay Rays breezed past the Pittsburgh Pirates 10-3 on Friday night.\n\nLowe hit a solo shot to right off Luis Ortiz in the third inning and went deep again with two aboard in the sixth to give the Rays a rare breather amid a string of tight finishes.\n\nTampa Bay entered Friday having had each of its previous four games decided in the final at-bat. There was no drama this time thanks to the first multi-homer game of Loweâs career.\n\nâThatâs the goal right, to have a stress-free win,â Lowe said.\n\nLowe has endured two stints on the injured list this season due to a right oblique strain. Getting back into a rhythm has been difficult, though he believes heâs starting to find himself in the batterâs box.\n\nHe certainly looked comfortable when he sent an Ortiz pitch to a place few left-handed batters reach at PNC Park. Loweâs second homer crashed into the bleachers just to the left of the 410-foot notch in left-center.\n\nâYou know (Lowe is) trying to get that timing,â Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said. âAnd it certainly looked like he got it today ... to go (opposite field) here is really, really impressive.â\n\nBen Rortvedt added three hits, including a three-run homer in the ninth.\n\nJose Siri also had three hits and made a pair of spectacular catches in center. He chased down a line drive to left-center by Nick Gonzales leading off the second and ended the game by robbing Jack Suwinski of extra bases with a leaping grab at the wall.\n\nâI think (Siri) is amazing teammates right now with how consistent his play is, how good he is out in the outfield and look, the quality of his at bats have completely turned around,â Cash said.\n\nYandy DÃ­az singled twice to extend his hitting streak to 14 games and his on-base streak to a career-best 23 games as the Rays finished with a season-high 17 hits.\n\nColin Poche (1-1) helped Tampa escape a bases-loaded jam in the fourth by getting Pittsburghâs Andrew McCutchen to hit into an inning-ending double play.\n\nBryan Reynolds hit his 11th homer of the season to push his hitting streak to a career-best 18 games. The left fielder is hitting .342 in June. Suwinski had an RBI double for Pittsburgh and KeâBryan Hayes added an RBI single.\n\nThe Pirates, still down a man in the starting rotation because of injuries to Martin Perez, Quinn Priester and Marco Gonzales, turned to their bullpen. The strategy has worked of late but not on the first night of a rare visit to Pittsburgh by Tampa Bay.\n\nCarmen Mlodzinski (1-3) gave up a run in the first 1 2/3 innings before giving way to Ortiz. The right-hander who had hoped to make the starting rotation out of spring training has thrived in a long relief role this season but struggled on a steamy night with temperatures in the mid-90s.\n\nTampa touched Ortiz for six runs on 10 hits in four innings. He failed to retire the Rays in order once and things got out of hand in the sixth.\n\nThe loss came on a day Pirates chairman Bob Nutting said heâs given general manager Ben Cherington the green light to seek trades that will help an offense that has kept the Pirates from emerging from a crowded if underwhelming NL Central pack.\n\nPittsburgh managed just five hits and only two over the final five innings.\n\nTRAINERâS ROOM\n\nPirates: C Joey Bart (thumb) served as the designated hitter for Triple-A Indianapolis on Friday night. Bart will catch for Perez (left groin) on Saturday when Perez makes a rehab start. ... Utility player Ji Hwan Bae (right wrist) also made a rehab appearance for Indianapolis on Friday. ... C Henry Davis (concussion) is still showing some concussion-like symptoms and has yet to return to âhigh-exertion activities,â according to Pirates director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTampa Bayâs Zach Eflin (3-4, 4.12 ERA) starts against promising Pittsburgh rookie Jared Jones (4-6, 3.76) on Saturday.\n\n___"
