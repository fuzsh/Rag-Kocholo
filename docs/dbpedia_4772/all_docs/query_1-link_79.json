        "text": "GLENDALE, Ariz. – Luis Cruz had a succinct and direct explanation for his behavior Saturday night during Mexico’s game against Canada in the World Baseball Classic.\n\nSo he repeated that explanation regardless of the question – eight times in a four-minute interview with reporters Monday morning as he and Adrian Gonzalez returned to Dodgers’ camp after their team was eliminated from the WBC.\n\n“I lost it,” Cruz said repeatedly when asked about his actions that led to the benches-clearing brawl. “I feel bad about it. But we’ve just got to move on and get ready for the baseball season.”\n\nCruz has been seen as the instigator in Saturday’s melee. After a bunt single with Canada leading by six runs in the ninth inning, Cruz could be clearly seen gesturing to Mexican pitcher Arnold Leon to hit the next batter. On his third try, Leon succeeded and both benches emptied.\n\nThere was discussion afterward about the need to pad a lead in WBC pool play because run differential is a potential tiebreaker. The 24-year-old Leon (who was optioned to the minors after rejoining A’s camp Monday) said he did not know about the importance of run differential but did what he was told to do by the more experienced Cruz.\n\n“It shouldn’t have happened but I did what I had to do,” Leon told reporters in A’s camp. “I didn’t want to hurt anyone. I didn’t know the rules.\n\n“I saw the sign (from Cruz). If someone like that tells you, your teammate, you’ve got to respect it.”\n\nGonzalez said he believed the Mexican players were aware of the run-differential tiebreaker. He alluded to “slides earlier in the game” being more of a factor in the blowup than the bunt. There were two hard, takeout slides at second base by Canadian baserunners.\n\n“We understood the tiebreaker rules,” Gonzalez said. “But things led to that and it happened.”\n\nCanadian coach Larry Walker kept Gonzalez away from the scrum, which featured Cruz prominently throwing punches. Walker told Gonzalez “you’re too important to the game” to get involved and risk injury.\n\n“He was telling me that in the middle of it,” Gonzalez said. “He had that outside perspective, didn’t want me to get involved. I was trying to make sure nobody got any cheap shots in. He pretty much shielded me off the whole time. He’s a pretty big guy so I couldn’t see much. I saw most of the fight on video from the cameras afterwards.”\n\nGonzalez offered no criticism of his teammate. There have been no suspensions as a result of the incident though Cruz said he didn’t know if he had been fined.\n\nCruz offered no apology to the Canadian team Monday morning, nor did he try to defend his behavior beyond his talking points.\n\n“I just say I feel bad because I lost it. That’s not the way I play,” Cruz said. “But that’s the way it is. I’m ready to move on and get ready for the season.”\n\nDodgers manager Don Mattingly welcomed Gonzalez and Cruz back to camp and said both will be in the lineup for Tuesday’s night game against the Cincinnati Reds. Reliever Ronald Belisario is expected back in camp Tuesday as well. Belisario was on the Venezuelan team that was eliminated from the WBC on Sunday.\n\nMattingly said he didn’t feel it was necessary to talk with Cruz about his involvement in the brawl.\n\n“You understand it because … in the heat of the moment you get fired up,” Mattingly said. “I think the good thing is it’s showing guys care about the tournament. You’re seeing guys get emotional. They’re wanting to win. That’s what you want, right? You don’t want a spring training setting.”\n\nNOTES\n\nRight-hander Chad Billingsley has been bothered by a sore right groin muscle. But he said it’s something that has cropped up “every spring for the past 10 years” and has rarely turned serious. He expects to make his scheduled start Wednesday on the minor-league side of camp. … Right-handers Matt Magill and Steve Ames were optioned to minor-league camp. Non-roster right-hander Matt Palmer was re-assigned to the minors. Palmer will undergo surgery Tuesday to repair a meniscal tear in his left knee. … Reliever Javy Guerra complained of a sore groin muscle after throwing 25 pitches and retiring only two batters in a minor-league camp game Sunday. Mattingly said it’s not considered a threat to sideline him for an extended period of time. … With starters Josh Beckett and Ted Lilly expected to pitch Tuesday against the Reds, relievers J.P. Howell, Brandon League and Jansen are scheduled to throw two innings each in a minor-league camp game Tuesday afternoon.\n\nContact the writer: bplunkett@ocregister.com\n\nRELATED:"
