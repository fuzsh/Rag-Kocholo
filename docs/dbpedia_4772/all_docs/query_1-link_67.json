        "text": "The Pittsburgh Pirates have placed the struggling Colin Holderman on the 15-day injured list with a right wrist sprain. To take his place on the roster, the Pirates selected the contract of Ben Heller from Triple-A Indianapolis.\n\nIn 44 appearances out of the bullpen this season, Holderman has gone 3-5 with a 3.21 ERA with 47 saves in 42 innings.\n\nAfter a hot start to the season, Holderman has struggled of late. He has been scored upon in each of his last five appearances and has been tagged for nine earned runs in total on nine hits in 4.1 innings. He took the loss on Wednesday against the Padres after allowing three runs to score in the top of the 10th.\n\nDating back to June 23, Holderman has a 7.63 ERA in 16 appearances after posting a remarkable 0.68 ERA in 28 appearances up to that point.\n\nHeller had a brief stint with the Pirates in early June and was roughed up in a pair of appearances. He allowed a total of 12 runs (11 earned) to score on nine hits in two innings pitched.\n\nIn 30 appearances with Triple-A Indianapolis, Heller went 2-3 with a 3.55 ERA and four saves. He struck out 63 batters, walked 13 and allowed 22 hits in 37 innings pitched.\n\nIn order to get Heller back on the 40-man roster, the Pirates designated outfielder Edward Olivares for assignment. Olivares appeared in 55 games to begin the season with the Pirates and slashed a lowly .224/.291/.333 with four doubles, five home runs and 23 RBIs in 55 games.\n\nAdditionally, right-handed pitcher Jared Jones (right lat strain) and outfielder Joshua Palacios (left hamstring strain) will both begin rehab assignments with Indianapolis on Thursday. Jones has been out since leaving his start against the Cardinals on July 3 after five innings. Palacios was placed on the 10-day injured list on July 31."
