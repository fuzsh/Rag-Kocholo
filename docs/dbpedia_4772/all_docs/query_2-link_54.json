        "text": "TEMPE, Ariz. –– When Cincinnati Reds right-handed pitcher Luis Cessa pitches for Team Mexico in the World Baseball Classic this month, he’ll have two reasons to feel pressure. He’ll be representing his country, and he’ll also be competing for a spot in the Reds’ starting rotation.\n\nThere’s a big upcoming three-week stretch for Cessa, who will pitch on the international stage while he’s proving he can be a quality MLB starter. Cessa had spent most of his seven-year career in the bullpen, but the short-handed 2022 Reds needed him to move to the rotation last August.\n\nReds spring trainingFormer Reds All-Star Jesse Winker putting past behind him with new start in Milwaukee\n\nReds spring trainingReds starting pitcher Justin Dunn is shut down for 'a couple months'\n\nReds spring trainingElly De La Cruz authors a poetic moment vs. Aroldis Chapman\n\nFacing the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday in his final start before the World Baseball Classic, Cessa looked ready to show what he can do. As the Angels beat the Reds, 8-5, Cessa pitched two scoreless innings while allowing only one hit.\n\n“Sometimes when you’re thinking too much about something, you put too much pressure on yourself,” Cessa said. “I will pay attention to the WBC and pay attention to winning the job in the rotation … I will try to be ready for the WBC but for sure, I want to win the spot in the starting rotation this year. Hopefully, my Spring Training will be the same way I’ve been doing and we’ll figure out what happens.”\n\nAngels center fielder Mike Trout was the second batter that Cessa faced, and Cessa beat Trout with his slider. Cessa got strike two with a slider that dropped onto the edge of the strike zone. Trout didn’t expect the pitch to land in the strike zone, and he shook his head as he recognized a missed opportunity.\n\nWith his next pitch, Cessa threw another slider. This one took a nose dive into the dirt, and Trout whiffed at it for strike three. During Cessa’s second appearance of the spring, he showed that fastball-slider combo that has made him a reliable big leaguer for years.\n\nReds spring trainingAfter rough 2021 season, ex-Reds All-Star Eugenio Suárez finds love for baseball again\n\nReds spring trainingHow Christian Encarnacion-Strand became a prospect to watch at Reds spring training\n\n\"He really attacked,\" Reds manager David Bell said. \"All of his pitches looked sharp. He's throwing the ball well. A lot of our guys that are going to the WBC seem to be slightly ahead of everybody else. I think that can be an advantage.\"\n\nThree observations\n\n1. On Saturday, Reds prospect Elly De La Cruz showed his elite speed with a triple against the Kansas City Royals. One day later, Reds outfielder Will Benson showed that he can run just as quickly. On a double down the left field line, Benson raced from first to home and showed some athleticism that the Reds didn’t have on the big league roster last season. Benson’s helmet flew off as he sprinted around the bases, and he scored easily.\n\n2. Bell used Sunday’s game to get two players competing for utility roles some experience playing different positions. Bell could have started Nick Solak at his natural position of second base and started Chad Pinder in left field, where Pinder has spent a lot of time recently. Instead, Solak played left and Pinder played second against the Angels. Solak made a running catch in the outfield, and Pinder made a diving stop at second base for a ground out.\n\nReds spring training'He can really pitch': Reds prospect Andrew Abbott sticking to his strengths\n\n3. The Reds signed Daniel Norris, a nine-year veteran, to a minor league contract to give them an experienced left-handed option out of the bullpen, but his spring has gotten off to a rough start. Against the Angels, Norris walked three batters, hit a batter with a pitch and allowed three runs in the fifth inning. He became the first Reds pitcher to receive a mound visit from the pitching coach this spring as he struggled locating his pitches.\n\nDaily De La Cruz\n\nIn the sixth inning, De La Cruz was at the plate in a tie game with runners on second and third base and two outs. He hit a routine ground ball to the shortstop and sprinted out of the box. De La Cruz beat the throw to first base to pick up an infield single and gave the Reds the lead. His speed changed the game.\n\nDe La Cruz had two hits on Sunday, and he also had a great seven-pitch battle against Angels starter Patrick Sandoval.\n\n\"He's fun to watch,\" Bell said. \"It's nice getting him playing time, and he'll continue to play.\"\n\nUp next\n\nMonday –– The Reds return to Goodyear Ballpark to face the Colorado Rockies. Chase Anderson, who finished the 2022 season in the Reds rotation, is in minor league spring training this year and will start for the Reds."
