        "text": "With Mexico's 10-3 loss to Canada on Saturday in the World Baseball Classic, it likely means Adrian Gonzalez and Luis Cruz will be back with the Dodgers sooner, as Mexico finished Pool D play at just 1-2. But perhaps more importantly, Cruz could face MLB discipline for his role in an ugly brawl that marred the end of Mexico's game with Canada.\n\nIn the ninth inning of an intense and chippy game, Canada's Chris Robinson bunted to open the ninth inning, up 9-3. This did not please Cruz, who had instructions for Mexico pitcher Arnold Leon.\n\nLeon followed instructions and plunked the next batter, Rene Tosoni, after buzzing him with a pitch. That emptied both benches.\n\nIn the scrum, Cruz escalated things by appearing to throw a punch.\n\nSeven players were ejected for the incident but amazingly Cruz was not one of them. But now we wait to see what kind of discipline he might receive from MLB.\n\nCruz will receive a hero's welcome from Dodgers teammate Javy Guerra, who nearly joined Cruz on Team Mexico before getting declared ineligible.\n\nWhile bunting to get on in that situation is generally a plunkable offense, the fact that run differential is a tiebreaker in the WBC nullifies any complaints of running up the score.\n\nWith Canada's win, Nick Punto and Team Italy have clinched a spot in the second round of the WBC."
