        "text": "NEW YORK — Derek Jeter walked to home plate, toyed with his batting gloves, stepped into the batter's box as fans chanted his name and legged out an infield hit.\n\nA feeling of normalcy returned to the Yankee Stadium. The captain was back after a nine-month layoff.\n\nBut, perhaps, only for a few innings.\n\nJeter singled on his first pitch of the season, then felt a tight right quadriceps and was pulled for a pinch-hitter in the eighth inning of the Yankees' 8-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Thursday.\n\nHe scored a run and went 1-for-4 with an RBI groundout as the designated hitter in his return from a broken ankle sustained in last October's AL Championship Series opener. After icing the leg, the 39-year-old was headed to a hospital for an MRI.\n\nIn a season thus far memorable for sidelined stars rather than sustained success, the Yankees anxiously awaited the test results.\n\n\"It's not frustrating, yet. We'll see. They MRI everything around here,\" Jeter said. \"I hope it's not a big deal.\"\n\nKnown for trying to ignore most injuries, Jeter vowed not to this time. Sort of. \"I can't trick the tests,\" he said, before adding: \"I always play.\"\n\nHe played through September and into October last year with what was called a bone bruise. The left ankle finally gave out in the ALCS opener against Detroit.\n\n\"I don't think it broke because I was 38. I think it broke because I continued to play on something that maybe I shouldn't have,\" Jeter said.\n\nThe possible setback is not what the Yankees were hoping for in a season also hampered by significant injuries to first baseman Mark Teixeira, Curtis Granderson and Francisco Cervelli.\n\n\"It's kind of what we went through this year,\" manager Joe Girardi said. \"So hopefully it's nothing, it's just some leg tightness and he'll be ready to go.\"\n\nAndy Pettitte (7-6) settled down after another shaky first inning to win consecutive starts for the first time since April. Lyle Overbay hit a go-ahead, two-run single in a four-run fifth against Ervin Santana (5-6) as the Yankees overcame a 3-0 deficit and split the four-game series.\n\nThe Yankees cut short Jeter's rehabilitation assignment in the minor leagues after just four games following injuries Wednesday night to Travis Hafner and Brett Gardner, who hit for Jeter in the eighth. Jeter found out about 11 p.m. in Scranton, Pa., went back to his hotel, waited for his equipment and caught a ride to New York. He arrived about 2:30 a.m., fell asleep 90 minutes later.\n\nAnd then woke up about 6:30 a.m.\n\n\"Couldn't fall back asleep,\" he said. \"I was nervous going into the game. It's almost like it's opening day for me, even though we're in — what are we in, July now? I lost track of the months.\"\n\nJeter batted second in his first big-league game since Oct. 13. He said after the initial injury he would return by opening day, then fractured the ankle again in April during his rehab and missed the first 91 games of the season.\n\nJeter turned on a 95 mph fastball in the first — \"I had my mind made up yesterday that I was going to swing at the first pitch\" — and sent a three-hopper up the third-base line that fell from Miguel Tejada's throwing hand. The crowd of 40,381 screamed \"De-rek Je-ter! De-rek Je-ter!\"\n\nJeter's ankle got more tests when he raced to third on Robinson Cano's single up the middle and came home on Vernon Wells' sacrifice fly to right.\n\nThe Yankees' all-time hits leader grounded out in the second and again in the fifth, when second baseman Johnny Giavotella made a diving stop to prevent an RBI single. That's when the quad tightened.\n\nJeter hit a sharp grounder to shortstop with the infield in during the sixth. Alcides Escobar bobbled the ball as Luis Cruz scored from third, and Jeter was thrown out as he jogged up the first-base line.\n\n\"It's awesome to have him back out there. He's so positive,\" Pettitte said.\n\nYankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez had his latest minor-league rehab game postponed by rain. Thursday's game for Class A Tampa was called after one-half inning. Rodriguez is expected to be interviewed by Major League Baseball investigators Friday as part of the probe into the closed anti-aging clinic Biogenesis, which is accused of distributing banned performance-enhancing drugs. Rodriguez has said he used PEDs while with Texas from 2001-03 but has denied using them since. Rodriguez is 2-for-15 (.133) with one RBI in six minor-league games.\n\nA-Rod's REHAB game rained out"
