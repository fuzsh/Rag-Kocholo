        "text": "Hit by a pitch near his right knee in the sixth inning on Wednesday, Jurickson Profar talked his way into staying in the game only to be pulled off the field after hobbling into second base on Xander Bogaerts’ ensuing single.\n\nX-rays taken after the game were negative.\n\nSo Profar has, apparently, talked his way into Thursday’s lineup.\n\nProfar will bat second and play left field as the Padres seek a three-game sweep at PNC Park.\n\nFirst pitch is at 9:35 a.m.\n\n“I’m good,” Profar told the Union-Tribune’s Kevin Acee while walking with hardly any limp as he departed the clubhouse late Wednesday night.\n\nProfar isn’t the only notable return as shortstop Ha-Seong Kim is also back in the lineup after missing the last two starts with right triceps soreness.\n\nKim actually returned to action Wednesday as Profar’s pinch-runner in the sixth inning.\n\nKim will bat eighth, between right fielder David Peralta and catcher Kyle Higashioka.\n\nWith a right-hander on the mound, both Luis Arraez and Jake Cronenworth are both in the lineup. Arraez will play first base and Cronenworth will play second as Bogaerts gets the start at designated hitter.\n\nThe Padres (63-52) are a season-high 11 games over .500 and tied with the Diamondbacks for the No. 1 wild-card spot, two games ahead of the Braves (60-53).\n\nThe Pirates (56-57) have slipped four games out of a wild-card spot.\n\nThursday’s pitching matchup\n\nPadres RHP Randy Vásquez (3-6, 4.62 ERA)\n\nHe’s up to 76 innings — more than double last year’s total (37 ⅔ IP) — in his second year in the majors. Vásquez is coming off five innings of one-run ball in a no-decision over the Rockies.\n\nVásquez faced the Pirates once as a reliever with the Yankees in 2023, allowing two hits over 1⅓ scoreless innings.\n\nHere is how he’s fared against current Pirates:\n\nOF Bryan De La Cruz (1-for-1, 2B, BB)\n\nC Yasmani Grandal (0-for-2)\n\nINF Isiah Kiner-Falefa (0-for-2)\n\n3B Ke-Bryan Hayes (0-for-1)\n\nOF Connor Joe (0-for-1)\n\nPirates RHP Luis Ortiz (5-2, 3.21 ERA)\n\nThe 25-year-old has allowed nine earned runs in 10⅓ innings over his last two starts. Overall, Ortiz has a 2.83 ERA in 35 innings as a starter and a 3.49 ERA in 49 innings this year out of the bullpen. He allowed four runs in 4⅔ innings in a start last year against the Padres.\n\nHere is how he’s fared against current Padres:"
