        "text": "Yesterday saw the release of a new metric in Major League Baseball. Well, it was actually quite a few new metrics, but all are related to the tracking data of a hitters bat. Bat speed, swing length, and more can now be viewed over at Baseball Savant. The good news is that Elly De La Cruz has fairly elite bat speed. You probably aren’t surprised by that. The bad news is that as of today, the Cincinnati Reds as a team do not.\n\nLet’s start off by talking a little bit about what bat speed tells us. Like just about every other stat out there – it does provide us with some good information that can be quite useful. But like every other stat out there, on it’s own it simply doesn’t have enough information in order to give us a full picture. We need a lot of outside information to give that stat fuller meaning. It’s a piece to the puzzle, perhaps even a big piece, but it’s not the full picture.\n\nTo put that point into perspective, let’s talk about the two players who are the biggest outliers among the players there’s enough bat speed data on to be included in the leaderboards. The player with the slowest average bat speed in baseball is Luis Arraez. His average bat speed is a full two miles per hour slower than anyone else. On the other end of the spectrum is Giancarlo Stanton. His average bat speed is 2.9 miles per hour faster than the next closest player.\n\nThose two guys are very different hitters. Arraez is probably the best hitter for batting average in the game for a while now. Since he made his debut in 2019 he’s hit .324 and won two batting titles. What he doesn’t do it hit for much power – he has 24 career home runs in 577 career games. He’s still a well above-average hitter, though, because that high batting average carries his lower walk rate and lower power output to higher levels than a normal hitter who isn’t hitting .320+.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton is known for a few things, but the biggest one is his power. He’s hit 410 career home runs in his 15-year career. Back in 2017 he hit 59 of them with the Marlins that helped him edge out Joey Votto in the MVP voting by two points. But another thing that Stanton is known for is a lot of strikeouts. He’s routinely among the league leaders in that category.\n\nIt’s important to understand that players who are extreme outliers do not make the exception the rule. And these two guys are extreme outliers but did feel like they were both worth talking about.\n\nGetting to the Cincinnati Reds, let’s talk about where their six qualified players ranks. Baseball Savant has data listed for 220 players this season. That’s a little over seven players per team – or basically your sort-of every day players in the league this year. It’s also worth noting that they are only counting “competitive swings” here. The major league average bat speed on such swings is currently at 71.4 MPH. From this article explaining the new stats, it’s noted that “two-thirds (of swings) are between 68-77 MPH.”\n\nTwo of the Reds regulars have an above-average bat speed so far this season. Elly De La Cruz and Will Benson. De La Cruz is averaging 75 MPH on his swings this season, which ranks 23rd. That puts him in the 89th percentile of players in the game. Benson is at 72.1 MPH on his swings, which ranks 99th and has him in the 55th percentile.\n\nThe other qualified Reds are all below-average. Christian Encarnacion-Strand and Spencer Steer are at 71.3 and 71.2 MPH and rank 120th and 125th. Jonathan India is at 70.8 MPH and is ranked 150th. Jeimer Candelario is at 68.6 MPH and that ranks 196th and puts him at the bottom of the list among Cincinnati’s hitters that we’ve got data on.\n\nHere’s how the hitters on the team stack up who aren’t qualified for the leaderboards – and I will note that because they have fewer swings to work with that things could change more quickly for them than the others when looking at this data down the line:\n\nTyler Stephenson – 71.1 MPH\n\nJake Fraley – 71.0 MPH\n\nStuart Fairchild -71.0 MPH\n\nNick Martini – 69.3 MPH\n\nSantiago Espinal – 67.7 MPH\n\nLuke Maile – 67.6 MPH\n\nNot every hitter is swinging as hard as they can with each pitch. And that makes sense, too, because not everyone has the same approach. But perhaps more importantly, not everyone is seeing the same pitches. You’ve got to always be ready for the fastball because you can’t decide to speed up your swing once you start it. But you can slow your swing down a little bit for secondary offerings and not everyone is getting the same kind of distribution of pitches. One addition to the leaderboard is how often a player is swinging the bat at least 75 miles per hour. Among the Reds, Elly De La Cruz is still well ahead of everyone else.\n\nBut there’s more fun stuff to look into. They’ve also got a “squared up” stat. If you want to read a detailed version of what the data behind this stat is, you can here, but basically it’s estimating how good the exit velocity of a batted ball is compared to the best possible outcome it could have been based on the swing and the pitch velocity. Anything over 80% can only occur (at least according to them) on the sweet spot of the bat and is considered “squared up”.\n\nThis metric can be important, too. The leader in squared up? Luis Arraez at 43.5%. The league average “squared up” rate is just under 26%. There seems to be a correlation between slower bats and more “squared up” batted balls. But with that, there is some trade off with the overall exit velocity because the baseline with a lowered bat speed drops that down.\n\nWith the data for the individual players out of the way, here’s how the Reds as a team stack up.\n\nThe Reds average bat speed of 70.8 MPH ranks 24th in baseball. Atlanta stands out from the crowd at 73.2 MPH at the top of the list. When it comes to a team’s “fast swing” rate, the Reds are down at 29th in baseball – only ahead of the Chicago White Sox.\n\nOverall, the Reds bats are slow. And they don’t swing fast very often, either. But they are also missing Matt McLain and Noelvi Marte from their lineup and that could potentially help the overall team bat speed if they have it (we don’t really know since they haven’t played this year).\n\nMore Reading on Bat Speed\n\nEno Sarris of The Athletic looked at some of this stuff this morning. He talked to coaches around the league about it. He spoke with players about it. And there’s also some talk about how the chase of increased bat speed may be leading to more injuries, too. You need a subscription to read the article, but if you’ve got it, it’s worth checking out."
