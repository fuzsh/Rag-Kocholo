        "text": "We recently brought you the 2023 Glove Report so it’s only natural that we follow up with the tools of the trade for the offensive side of the game. Unlike leather, Big Leaguers have proven to be more open to having different brands in the rotation for when they step into the box. Here is that breakdown:\n\nIn order to make this report and the others like it, WPW spends the year cataloging MLB starters (not including pitchers) equipment based on Baseball-Reference.com’s team pages, as well as a few others. When it comes to what the pros are swinging, we focus on what bat or bats each starter uses the most. It’s also important to note that some of these guys will use a plethora of brands throughout the season, but WPW focuses on the two brands that they are most loyal to.\n\n2023 Bats Used By MLB Starters\n\nVictus and Marucci maintained their same exact percentages from 2022 to 2023 at 24 and 22, respectively, accounting for nearly half of the league.\n\nWhat Wood Bat Do You Swing?\n\nWhat Bats Do MLB Starters Use?\n\n2023 Bats Swung By MLB Starters\n\nIn 2023, league-wide bat usage did not change too much.\n\nNearly 75% of bats used by MLB starting hitters come from four companies: Victus, Marucci, Louisville Slugger, and Chandler. Louisville Slugger dropped a percentage point, while Old Hickory saw an even bigger decline (-4%). On the other hand, Chandler saw a very solid jump from eight to 13.\n\nHere’s a look at the seven major brands being swung around the MLB:\n\nVictus | 23.5% of Bats Used by MLB Starters (-0.9%) from 2022\n\nVictus has only been making bats since 2012 and may have the most impressive rise amongst bat companies as it only took them 10 years to beat out the powerhouse bat makers like Louisville Slugger, which has made bats since the 1800s. After taking over the league in 2021 and becoming the most widely used bat amongst MLB starters, Victus has continued to grow in popularity.\n\nVictus is swung by young stud Adley Rutschman, who posted a strong .277/.374/.435 slash line in his sophomore campaign with the ADLEY35. Fernando Tatis Jr. also swings his own signature model – the TATIS23. Although Victus was acquired in 2017 by Marucci, they’ve continued to operate independently.\n\nVictus has an impressive list of believers. Including former MVPs Mookie Betts and Jose Altuve, here’s a list of some the best ballplayers who use Victus bats:\n\nGeorge Springer | Axe GS4-X Maple Bat (Find its closest match here)\n\nOniel Cruz | V271 Maple Bat\n\nRafael Devers | EB12 Bat\n\nBryce Harper | FT23 Maple Bat\n\nJulio Rodriguez | JRODSHOW Bat\n\nSee all of our featured Victus bats here.\n\nMarucci | 21.5% of Bats Used by MLB Starters (-0.9% from 2022)\n\nMarucci holds second position with nearly the same share of starters since 2019. After the savvy acquisition of Victus in 2017, the two brands are used by a combined 45% of MLB starters.\n\nLuis Arraez, who won the batting title in the American League following a stellar 2022, repeated as such over in the National League last season. Other notables include:\n\nFreddie Freeman | CB15 Maple Bat\n\nGleyber Torres | GLEY25\n\nFrancisco Lindor | LINDY12\n\nSee all of our featured Marucci bats here.\n\nLouisville Slugger | 14% of Bats Used by MLB Starters (-1% from 2022)\n\nLouisville Slugger saw a very small slip in its usage from 2022 to 2023, coming in at third and used by 14% of MLB starters. Louisville Slugger has been making bats since 1883 and is a staple in the baseball world. Here are a few more of the league’s best that rocked one of the oldest brands in baseball:\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. | VG27 Birch Bat\n\nRonald Acuña Jr. | A181 Maple Bat\n\nYordan Alvarez | i13 Maple Bat\n\nSee all of our featured Louisville Slugger bats here.\n\nChandler | 13% of Bats Used by MLB Starters (+2.5% from 2022)\n\nChandler Bats jumped up another 2.5% for the second straight season. After being rescued from bankruptcy when Yoenis Cespedes purchased the Chandler bat company in 2019, Chandler quickly reestablished itself among Big League power hitters. Here are some of the other sluggers that join Ohtani on the list of players swinging Chandler Bats:\n\nAaron Judge | AJ99\n\nJazz Chisholm | JAZZ.X\n\nSee all of our featured Chandler bats here.\n\nOld Hickory | 6% of Bats Used by MLB Starters (-4% from 2022)\n\nOld Hickory dropped another couple points for a second straight season, but their roster still carries a list of very decorated names. Their quality has still remained to the standards of J.D. Martinez, Mike Trout, and Nolan Shanuel. Other names include:\n\nMatt Olson | MO28 Maple Bat\n\nJ.D. Martinez | J143 Maple Bat\n\nJuan Soto | AJ25 Maple Bat\n\nSee all of our featured Old Hickory bats here.\n\nTucci Lumber | 4.4% of Bats Used by MLB Starters (+1.9% from 2022)\n\nTucci slotted in behind Old Hickory for the six-spot as the most used bat in the bigs, seeing their fleet double from one year to the next. Two-time All-Star Bo Bichette has continued rocking with the Indiana-based company, with MJ Melendez and Xander Bogaerts joining the mix as well.\n\nSee all of our featured Tucci Lumber bats here.\n\nDove Tail Bat | 2.7% of Bats Used by MLB Starters (+0.6% from 2022)\n\nOffering a bunch of different knob styles, such as the Pro-XR, puck knob, and the style McNeil swings (above), Dove Tail Bat has been very popular in Queens. Pete Alonso and Mark Canha joined their teammate in picking up DTBs, with Harrison Bader, Giancarlo Stanton, and Gary Sanchez also taking a liking to the company that made its Big League debut in 2014.\n\nHarrison Bader | HB22.3-ProXR\n\nEric Hosmer | HOS35\n\nNo wood bat is complete without a perfectly applied pine tar job, as seen here on Josh Naylor’s gamers.\n\nThese are the remaining brands swung by MLB starters:\n\nMore MLB Hitter Insights\n\nProHitter Hitting Aid Used by 54% of MLB Starters (+1% from 2022)\n\nProHitter is a small hitting aid worn around the thumb that provides padding between the thumb and index finger. According to their website, ProHitter helps the batter improve the position of the bat in their hands which in turn leads to an increase in bat speed and an uptick in power. The rubber also absorbs some vibration off the bat leading to less sting. The tiny piece has been a tremendous success in MLB as it, and similar pieces like the Thumbpro, are worn by a whopping 147 MLB starters (a 10% jump from two years ago!), including Aaron Judge and Austin Riley.\n\nProHitter is worn on the top hand and designed to maximize extension and bat speed. Over half of MLB starters can’t be wrong. It just may be worth the $12-$14 cost at Dick’s.\n\nLizard Skins Bat Wraps Used by 51% of MLB Starting Hitters (No change from 2022)\n\nAnother hitting accessory that elevated from “popular” to “dominant:” Lizard Skins. While Lizard Skins have been a popular grip in past years, we saw 140 starters use them in 2023. Marucci acquired Lizard Skins back in 2021, and with Marucci and Victus (a Marucci company) being used by around half the league this information comes as no shock. Lizard Skins has been a popular alternative to standard tape in the MLB for a decade now, and are available at Baseball Express for $15-$18.\n\nBatting Gloves\n\nFranklin Batting Gloves | Worn by 44.5% of MLB Starting Hitters (+2.5% from 2021)\n\nFranklin slightly dropped in their usage across the league from 44.5% in 2022 to 41% in 2023. With a number of different options of high-quality batting gloves – including the CFX Pro, Pro Classic, and Powerstrap – they have a comfortable 33-player lead on Nike. Here’s a few of the hitters using the league’s most popular batting gloves:\n\nPaul Goldschmidt | Franklin Tectonic Pro\n\nJose Abreu | Franklin Pro Classic\n\nXander Bogaerts | Franklin Powerstrap\n\nSpencer Torkelson | Franklin CFX Pro\n\nSee all of our featured Franklin batting gloves here.\n\nNike Batting Gloves | Worn by 29% of MLB Starting Hitters (-3% from 2022)\n\nNike usage dropped a tad from 2022, which had 32% of MLB starting hitters rocking the swoosh. Nike, the official uniform of MLB, has been #2 behind Franklin for the past couple of years. Still, the brand’s magnetic attraction has lured a talented group of players. This includes:\n\nMike Trout | Trout Elite 2.0\n\nRhys Hoskins | Alpha Huarache Elite\n\nJosh Bell | Huarache Elite\n\nRonald Acuńa Jr. | Huarache Elite\n\nMatt Olson | Trout Elite 2.0\n\nSee all of our featured Nike batting gloves here.\n\nAdidas Batting Gloves | Worn by 9% of MLB Starting Hitters (+1% from 2022)\n\nAfter Franklin and Nike, there’s a pretty steep dropoff with Adidas coming in third. Adidas’ roster has a lot of talent, all of which rock the long-standing Adidas Adizero 4.0 Batting Gloves (Available at BaseballExpress.com for $20-$35). Here’s some of Adidas’ heavy hitters:\n\nYordan Alvarez | adiZero 4.0\n\nTrea Turner | adiZero 4.0\n\nCorey Seager | adiZero 4.0\n\nSee all of our featured Adidas batting gloves here.\n\nHere are the remaining batting glove brands worn by MLB starting hitters:\n\nAnd a drumroll for final category up for consideration in the WPW 2022 Bat Report: men who go barehanded at the plate. This category contains four MLB starters, and here they are:\n\nTrent Grisham\n\nMatt Carpenter\n\nHenry Davis\n\nJoey Wendle\n\nFor our loyal readers who made it all the way to the end of this report, check out cool detailing on Masataka Yoshida’s Under Armour batting gloves.\n\nWhat do you think about our 2023 MLB bat and batting glove report?
