        "text": "In 2021 Robert Anthony Cruz was signed by the Washington Nationals to live out his childhood dream of \"Professional Baseball Player\". This accomplishment of his was the result of professional coaching and a lot of hours. There were very few college offers out of high school for him, and he batted only .170 his freshman year at UC Riverside before transferring to Biola University (D2). Thanks to his hitting coach (Kip Gross), Robert Anthony turned around his college career finishing with a .326 batting average and 21 HRs. Without coach Kip, Robert Anthony likely wouldn't have played in college, let alone professionally. Robert Anthony was released in Spring Training of 2022, but his love for the game drove him to begin making coaching videos on TikTok with what he has learned throughout his playing career. Robert Anthony's story has made him passionate about sharing with the next generation, and he want parents and coaches to know how to best love their players with quality coaching.\n\nCoach RAC is BACK with another exciting episode! In this episode he talks about 3 mental pitfalls you should avoid at the plate and how to change your mental approach from a negative to a positive.\n\nNumber 1: Don't say don't! Turn your negative thoughts into a positive outlook.\n\nNumber 2: No Mechanical Adjustments: \"Keep your elbow up!\" \"stride bigger!\"\n\nNumber 3: No Emotional Hitting.\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nCoach RAC is BACK with another exciting episode! In this episode he talks about the three ways to wear your glove.\n\nThe three ways to wear your glove:\n\n1. Straight up\n\n2. Two in the pinky\n\n3. Two in the ring\n\nRecommended use:\n\nStraight up:\n\nUsed for middle infielders to have a more shallow pocket to allow for faster exchanges on double plays and relays.\n\nTwo in the pinky:\n\nRecommended for outfielders and infielders depending on preference.\n\nTwo in the ring:\n\nFor catchers only.\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nCoach RAC is BACK with another exciting episode! In this episode He talks about the 3 Most Common Base-running Mistakes and how to avoid them.\n\n1. STOP Looking down\n\nStop looking down at your feet and back at the base while you lead off!! Look at the ball. And make sure you get your signs BEFORE you lead off the base.\n\n2. Stop Clicking the heels\n\nThe second you come up out of your legs there is nothing you can do until you land. That split second might be enough to get picked off. A good rule of thumb is to keep your head at the same level, which will keep us moving in our legs like this.\n\n3. Stop Starting sideways\n\nIt’s slow, and hard to know how far away you are from the base if we start sideways.\n\nIt is good to step off the base with a consistent step so we can feel out the distance. When I played I always knew EXACTLY how far away from the base I was. So start with your heels on the base. Then go left, cross over, 1, 2!\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nCoach RAC brings Coach Murph on board and they both discuss Advice for Parent Baseball Coaches.\n\n1. Prioritize fun\n\nBy prioritizing fun, you are prioritizing the long game as a parent. Enjoying the game is what keeps players in the game, so don't treat your players as employees.\n\n2. Take off the \"Parent Hat\" when you get to the field\n\nIf you coach your kid differently from the other kids, even with good intentions it can take the fun out of the game.\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nCoach RAC goes over a Pitching Mechanics Masterclass with Bobby O'Neil.\n\n1. Arm path Less is more!\n\nWe need to simplify our arm path. Baseball is a marathon, and especially with pitching, arm health is essential. We need a clean arm path if we desire a sustainable and consistent performance on the Mound. Have a smooth arm path that begins with the hand on top of the ball at the belly button\n\n2. Lower Half Stop jumping forward!\n\nOur lower half needs to maintain ground connection to produce optimal force and to have an efficient kinetic chain. A helpful thought here is to simply imagine there’s a piece of gum that’s stuck under your shoe. Maintain that ground connection through the ball released and then let the hip clear forward. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nCoach RAC gives a Crash Course on Every Infield Position!\n\nAs infielders we need to know WHERE to be and WHEN. Here’s a crash course on every infield position highlighting:\n\n1. Pre-Pitch Positioning (double play depth)\n\n2. Cutoffs and Relays\n\nEach infielder has a unique responsibility, and while coaches and teams may have their unique styles, here are positioning principals that apply to every team out there.\n\nPositioning summary:\n\n3rd Base: Cutoff to home from left field\n\nSS: Cutoff to the left side of the field on Extra-Base Hits\n\n2B: Cutoff to the right side of the field on Extra-Base Hits\n\n1B: Cutoff to home from Right Field\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nCoach RAC discusses two Tips to Overcome Overthinking.\n\nBaseball rewards the simple minded, but I believe even the \"overthinker\" has an advantage if they can learn to leverage their mental game. As someone who has always been an overthinker, these are my best two pieces of advice.\n\n1. You can't shut off your brain\n\nThe harder you try to shut off your brain, the harder it gets. So rather than trying to \"not over think things\" let yourself over think, but redirect your thoughts.\n\n2. Positive reinforcement through video review\n\nDon't watch your bad swings on gameday. Good swings only. Use video to reinforce ideal movement patterns on gameday.\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nWhen we play free and easy, we perform better. The problem is, when the game matters more, we tend to tense up and try harder which in turn harms our performance. Often times coaches will place far more pressure on their players when the game \"means something\" which will result in poor play. Today I hit a grandslam in a Father/Son tournament in Arizona. It is very possible that this can be attributed to the level of competition (lol) however, I undoubtedly felt more comfortable in the box than I ever had before.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Coaches should strive for a fun and free dugout culture\n\n2. Players should strive to prioritize enjoying the game and steering clear of frustration This will not only make the game more fun, it just might help you hit a grand slam.\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nWelcome back to another episode of RAC's Corner! In today's episode, Coach RAC Discusses what your hits on a TEE are telling you.\n\nThis is What Your TEE is Telling You\n\n1. Problem: Top Spin\n\nIf you find yourself top spinning the ball off the tee, your bat path is working too much UP into the baseball.\n\nFix:\n\n- Work in to out\n\n- Hit a hard ground ball right in front of the plate to correct your path, and then try to back spin one to the back net\n\n2. Problem: Side Spin/Pop Ups\n\nIf you find yourself hitting with too much side spin, you will need to think about hitting the ball with the bottom of your bat knob.\n\nFix:\n\n- Knob to the ball\n\n- Focus on taking your back hip to the baseball\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nWelcome back to another episode of RAC's Corner! In today's episode, Coach RAC Discusses Hb Sports' Black Friday Specials!\n\nHere are some RAC approved deals from HB this month!\n\nFirst up, RAC swung a Marucci Cat 8 and Cat 9 in college (one piece) so there is a special place in his heart for the Marucci Cat X. The Cat X will be $50 off 11/24-11/27. Victus Nox 2: Save $100 11/20-12/13. Easton Hype Comp, Encore Hybrid, ALX, around 50% off!\n\nThere are the RAC approved deals, but before you buy, here is a word of advice.\n\n1. The bat won't fix you\n\n2. Don't jump sizes too quickly\n\nHappy Shopping!\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nCan you get fitted for a baseball bat? With so many bats to choose from, how do we make sure we get fitted properly?\n\nBaseball is not like golf. Our goal with a baseball bat is not to fit the bat to our swing, but to give our swing a tool for ADJUSTABILITY. Adjustability is the key to picking the perfect bat. Every pitch is different, which means every swing is different. With so many variables, the most important skill is adjustability at the plate.\n\nHere are my general recommendations for bat sizing by age:\n\n5-7: 26-28 inch\n\n8-10: 28-30 inch\n\n11-14: 30-32 Inch\n\nHS: 31-33 Inch\n\nCollege+: 33-34.5 Inch\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nWelcome back to another episode of RAC's Corner! In today's episode, Coach RAC Discusses Methods of Breaking a Glove In and what you should NOT be doing!\n\nSo you just got a new glove from HB... make sure you avoid these common mistakes.\n\nDO NOT use too much OIL-BASED leather conditioners. It’s okay to use a little bit, it is good for the leather! But using too much will make it an irreversibly heavy weight.\n\nUse a petroleum based conditioner. This won’t make the glove heavy! This will soften the leather.\n\nMake sure to ALWAYS wipe the dirt off your glove, it will eat away at the leather!\n\nIF you have a really nice glove that you want to last. Don’t heat the leather or try anything out of the ordinary. Just play catch. A lot of catch.\n\nIf you break in your glove by playing catch, DO NOT squeeze your glove the wrong way. We want our thumb to close the glove to our ring finger.\n\nIf the glove is too stiff to close, do this:\n\nApply some petroleum based conditioner\n\nPut on a batting glove on your glove hand to prevent rubbing\n\nPut your hand in the glove, and try to play catch, or use a pitching machine.\n\nEach catch will loosen up the glove the right way.\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nWelcome back to another episode of RAC's Corner! In today's episode, Coach RAC Discusses the Road to Pro + Advice to our 14 Year Old Self!\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n1. Don't be married to your plans. They are liable to change, so be flexible!\n\n2. Prioritize relationships, don't be so obsessed with your results on the field. It is easy to get caught up in the endless pursuit of perfection, but remember to enjoy the process.\n\nLet's Grow!\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nWelcome back to another episode of RAC's Corner! In today's episode, Coach RAC gives a full breakdown of \"Effective Velocity\".\n\n90 miles per hour can feel like 86 or 94 depending on what pitch was thrown before it. Sadly very few people even at high levels know how this works.\n\nTo pull the ball, we have to hit it out front, which means we have less time. Feels like 92mph So a pitch at the same speed will seem faster inside vs. outside. The same is true up and down! Because of the vertical-horizontal illusion and maybe even gravity, we seem to have more time on low pitches.\n\nLet's Grow!\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nWelcome back to another episode of RAC's Corner!

However, I have since developed 3 unpopular opinions about what makes a great hitter, and I now believe that the best hitters actually swing and miss and strike out looking more than you think. In fact, it might just be part of what makes them so great.\n\nSwing by Coach RAC's latest video to find out more!\n\nLet's Grow!\n\nHave a look at the full video here to learn more!\n\nWelcome back to another episode of RAC's Corner!
