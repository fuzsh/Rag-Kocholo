        "text": "A pair of left-handers highlighted the mound action for the Dodgers on Thursday, as they beat the Angels 10-8 to extend their unbeaten streak to six games, sending shock waves throughout the Cactus League.\n\nClayton Kershaw got the start, his second of the spring, and was extended to three innings. He allowed three runs, two earned in his three frames, but also struck out seven. Kershaw threw 50 pitches, including 36 for strikes, then threw a few more in the bullpen after the game.\n\n\"Clayton, it looked like he had electric stuff, to be honest with you,\" manager Don Mattingly said after the game.\n\nTed Lilly also took the mound on Thursday, but this was his first start of the spring. The second batter Lily faced, Howie Kendrick, took him deep for a home run, but that was the only hit Lilly allowed in his two innings.\n\n\"I thought Teddy, for not being out there in a long, long time, was for the first game of spring pretty sharp. It was kind of like last year, when he threw the ball good early,\" Mattingly said. \"The ball came out of his hand good, you could see it. It wasn't like there were duds.\n\nThe Dodgers scored two in the first thanks to a home run by Luis Cruz, who missed the previous two games with a bout of food poisoning. It was the second home run of the spring for Cruz, who is Plan A at the hot corner for Mattingly.\n\n\"It's hard for me to not think about Plan B, because there is always one. But I don't want there to be one, because Luis has earned that chance. We want him to be successful, so I don't like takling about it like I have the hammer over him and one bad day and he's gone,\" Mattingly said. \"He gets some rope, and he's swung the bat pretty good.\"\n\nNotes"
