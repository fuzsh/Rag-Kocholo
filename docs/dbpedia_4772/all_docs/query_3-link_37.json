        "text": "More than any Major League Baseball franchise over the past 30 years, the Miami Marlins have been the most mercurial. Their team logo should be next to the definition of mercurial in the dictionary: “subject to sudden or unpredictable changes.”\n\nThat was the 2023 Marlins who improved 15 games and made the playoffs. It equally describes the 2024 club that began 0-9 and was so hopeless by May 4 that it traded two-time batting champion Luis Arraez to the San Diego Padres for four prospects.\n\nThe remaining troops were so inspired they went out that night and lost to the Oakland Athletics, 20-4. Yes, those Athletics, losers of 102 and 112 games the previous two seasons.\n\nWhen the July 31 trading deadline loomed, contenders knocked down the Marlins’ door in hopes of picking up players seeking to get back to the playoffs elsewhere. In return, the Marlins got plenty of prospects.\n\nSan Diego dealt four for relievers Tanner Scott & Bryan Hoeing.\n\nThe New York Yankees sent three for 2B-3B-OF Jazz Chisholm Jr.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles traded two for starter Trevor Rogers.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks dealt two more for reliever A.J. Puk.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates sent two for outfielder Bryan De La Cruz.\n\nAlong with other moves, the Miami added 19 young players to join highly regarded recent draft picks such as pitchers Noble Meyer, Thomas White and Max Meyer — ranked by MLB Pipeline.com as Nos. 1, 3, and 4 in the farm system.\n\nWhite, 19, signed for a well-over slot $4.1 million as pick No. 35 a year ago. The 6-foot-5 lefty has done well this year with 93 strikeouts in 71 innings across two levels. He displays remarkable poise to go with a running fastball that has hit 97 mph, strong spinning curve and a good feel for his changeup. The long-necked youngster resembles Tommy John, who was a hard-throwing lefty for Cleveland in the early 1960s. An elbow injury and resulting operation now known as Tommy John Surgery extended his career until 1989 and he won 288 games.\n\nMax Meyer, 25, a first-rounder in 2020, had Tommy John Surgery after his second start for Miami in 2022. He stands only six-foot yet seems to still have a 94-95 mph fastball and top-notch slider. He’s 2-2 this year for the Marlins as he works his way back.\n\nNoble Meyer, 19, signed a $4.5 million deal as the 10th overall pick in 2023. The 6-5 right-hander has a good slider though he has struggled to find the strike zone enough with it and an upper 90s fastball this year.\n\nPosition Prospects Added\n\nThe Marlins basically got an entire lineup of prospects in recent deals.\n\nFrom San Diego came speedy outfielder Jakob Marsee, first baseman Nathan Martorella, second baseman Jay Beshears and third baseman Graham Pauley.\n\nBaltimore sent second baseman Connor Norby and outfielder Kyle Stowers.\n\nFrom the Yankees came catcher Augustin Ramirez, second baseman Jared Serna and shortstop Abrahan Ramirez.\n\nArizona sent slugger Deyvison De Los Santos and shortstop Andrew Pintar.\n\nAlso added were third baseman Garrett Forrester from Pittsburgh and shortstops Wilfredo Lara from the New York Mets and David Hensley from Houston.\n\nNorby, Stowers, De Los Santos, Pauley and Augustin Ramirez have the highest upside. Marsee and Martorella have struggled since being acquired.\n\nNorby, 24, a 2021 second-rounder, has totaled 66 homers, 222 RBI and a .288 average the past three years in the minors. He’s an OK defender with quick hands at the plate that should make the right-hander a good source of offense.\n\nStowers, 26, totaled 85 homers and 276 RBI the last four years in the minors. The 6-2 lefty must play to keep his big swing in rhythm, something he could not do in short callups to Baltimore.\n\nDe Los Santos, 21, has 31 homers, 90 RBI and a .322 average in the minors this year. Signed for $200,000 at age 17 out of the Dominican Republic, he’s less-than ordinary at third base or first and though he has enormous power numbers and exit velocity rates, his violent swing leads to a lot of strikeouts.\n\nPauley, 23, opened 2024 with the Padres, hit .125 in 13 games and has struggled to find his 2023 form. The lefty swinger batted .308 with 23 homers and 94 RBI a year ago. He’s an ordinary defender at third and may be moved to first or left field – if his bat rebounds and warrants a place in a MLB lineup.\n\nRamirez, 22, hammers pitches when he doesn’t chase breaking balls away from his powerful right-handed stroke. He likely will be moved to first base. He lacks catcher’s skills, including a woefully slow release that allows baserunners to run amok. When he doesn’t expand his strike zone, he can flat-out hit.\n\nEven More Pitching\n\nThe Marlins added seven pitching prospects, too.\n\nRobby Snelling, Adam Mazur, Dillon Head and Woo-Suk Go came over from San Diego.\n\nWill Schomberg was acquired from Seattle and Jun-Seok Shim from Pittsburgh.\n\nJesus Tinoco was claimed on waivers from the Chicago Cubs.\n\nSnelling, 20, is Miami’s No. 2 prospect. The lefty needs to refine all his pitches and is expected to become a solid starter in the majors. Mazur, 23, sailed through two seasons in the minors but was hammed to the tune of a 7.49 ERA in eight starts for the Padres before the trade. The right-hander is listed as Miami’s No. 8 prospect with the same outlook as Snelling – a mid-rotation starter if he can harness his stuff.\n\nMercurial Marlins\n\nThe franchise gathered enough good young players to win the 1997 World Series in just its’ fifth season. Then they sold them all off and lost 108 games in 1998. They bought a number of free agents and won the 2003 World Series and held another fire sale that kept them from making the playoffs for 17 years.\n\nWhether this group of acquisitions becomes winners or losers remains to be seen."
