        "text": "Cincinnati Reds coach Jeff Pickler was standing on the dugout steps, watching Stuart Fairchild sprint home from first on a double, when he decided to have a little fun with Elly De La Cruz.\n\n“Stu’s faster than you,” Pickler said.\n\nDe La Cruz was in the hole, awaiting his turn at bat in only his fifth major-league game. He turned toward Pickler and sort of raised his eyebrows, but didn’t say a word. His statement would come five innings later.\n\nThe sequence last June 10 was memorable, as so many sequences involving De La Cruz are. Spencer Steer hit a double into the right-center field gap. De La Cruz took off from first, ran through a stop sign at third and completed his safe journey home in a blazing 11.48 seconds.\n\nUpon returning to the dugout, he found Pickler.\n\n“How ‘bout now?” he asked.\n\nThe Reds, 4-15 after their 14-10 start, are a bit of a mess. Two of their toughest at-bats and best defenders, second baseman Matt McLain and center fielder TJ Friedl, are injured. Another such contributor, third baseman Noelvi Marte, is serving an 80-game suspension after testing positive for a banned performance enhancer.\n\nDe La Cruz, though, continues to emerge as one of the game’s most electrifying stars, batting .258 with nine homers and an .857 OPS while leading the majors with 26 stolen bases in 30 attempts. Among current major leaguers, his sprint speed, according to Statcast, ranks second to only that of Bobby Witt Jr.\n\n“You can’t take your eyes off him,” Pickler said.\n\nPickler, the Reds’ game planning and infield coach, recalls the impression De La Cruz made in the spring of 2023 at his first major-league camp. De La Cruz was flashy. He had swag. But, as Pickler remembers, “All the old-school people that hated that loved him.”\n\nAs Pickler and even the saltiest Reds people came to learn, De La Cruz wasn’t a “look-at-me” type. He had charisma, yes. He enjoyed himself on the field. But how could anyone be offended? He shut up and played.\n\n“That’s what the league will understand,” Pickler said. “When he’s doing the things he’s doing, it has nothing to do with a lack of respect. It has everything to do with joy, celebrating the game, his teammates.”\n\nThis past spring, Pickler told De La Cruz that as talented as he is, he might be an even better learner. The two worked on De La Cruz becoming more balanced on his back side at shortstop, staying under control, making sure his feet and hands were in sync. “In a day,” Pickler said, “he didn’t know how to do it any other way.”\n\nWith that kind of aptitude, the Reds believe De La Cruz will only get better. And at 22, he already is pretty darned good, a thrill ride of a player.\n\nAnother need for the Orioles?\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles likely will focus on relievers at the trade deadline, but the pursuit of a right-handed hitting outfielder is not out of the question.\n\nThe White Sox’s Luis Robert Jr. probably is a stretch, considering he has missed significant time in three of the past four seasons and is earning $12.5 million in 2024 and $15 million in ‘25 with $20 million club options for ‘26 and ‘27. The surplus value on Robert’s deal is diminishing, and other teams might be more likely to meet what is sure to be a hefty price.\n\nStill, the Orioles’ outfield production has tailed off in May. Anthony Santander is eligible for free agency after this season, Cedric Mullins and Austin Hays after next season. Colton Cowser is in a 5-for-35 slump and a veteran right-handed hitter like Kevin Pillar ultimately could make sense. Hays is the only pure right-handed hitter in the group, though Jorge Mateo can play outfield and Santander is a switch-hitter who generally hits lefties better than righties.\n\nThe trick for the Orioles going forward will be figuring out which of their position prospects are keepers, and which ones they should trade. Coby Mayo and Connor Norby both bat right-handed, but aren’t necessarily future outfielders. Mayo is a Kris Bryant-sized third baseman who might end up at first. Norby plays second and left, but isn’t especially proficient at either.\n\nDarvish going for No. 200\n\nSan Diego Padres right-hander Yu Darvish will attempt to reach a significant milestone Saturday when he faces the Braves in Atlanta. Darvish needs one win for 200 combined between his Major League Baseball (MLB) and Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) careers. Only Hiroki Kuroda (203) and Hideo Nomo (201) have more combined wins in the two leagues.\n\nDarvish, 37, has gone from possibly overrated earlier in his career to possibly underrated now. The Padres signed him to a six-year, $108 contract in February 2023, in part because they believed his repertoire was vast enough for him to succeed even after his velocity declined. That decline has yet to occur – Darvish’s average four-seamer has been in the same 94-96 mph range the past nine seasons. By the time his deal expires, however, he will be 42.\n\nThe contract was front-loaded, with Darvish earning 60 percent of the money in the first three years. His average salary in his final three seasons will be slightly more than $14 million, which is pretty much the going rate for third or fourth starters. The deal still could prove a mistake, but for now Darvish’s work ethic and love for the game make him a role model for the Padres’ other pitchers.\n\nNo funny business in Arraez trade\n\nIn 2016, his second full season as Padres GM, A.J. Preller twice ran into trouble when medical concerns surfaced with players he traded. First, he had to take back Colin Rea and return Luis Castillo to the Miami Marlins when Rea left his Marlins debut with an elbow injury. Then, the league suspended him 30 days without pay for failing to disclose medical information when he traded Drew Pomeranz to the Boston Red Sox.\n\nPreller, in his acquisition of Luis Arraez from the Marlins earlier this month, did not make the same mistake again.\n\nTwo days before the trade, the principal player going to the Marlins, Low-A outfielder Dillon Head, left a game with an injury. According to officials with both teams, the Padres kept the Marlins fully updated on Head’s condition, which the Marlins later announced as an adductor strain. After a review of medical information, the Marlins agreed to the deal.\n\nHead, after an 11-day layoff, made his debut for Low-A Jupiter on Tuesday night, going 3-for-4 with a triple, RBI, two stolen bases and an outfield assist.\n\nA trade that turned out well for the Tigers\n\nFormer Detroit Tigers general manager Al Avila had his share of missteps, which is why the team fired him in August 2022. But one of Avila’s moves proved an unqualified success — his trade of left-hander Daniel Norris to the Milwaukee Brewers at the 2021 deadline for minor-league right-hander Reese Olson.\n\nThe Brewers, on their way to a 95-win season, were seeking a left-handed reliever with swing-and-miss stuff. Norris, it turned out, was not the answer, struggling down the stretch and failing to make the team’s postseason roster. And Olson? Three years later, he is tied for seventh in the majors with a 2.09 ERA.\n\nAt the time of the trade, Olson was enjoying success at High A, but it’s not as if he was a top prospect; he was only a 13th-round pick out of North Hall High School in Gainesville, Ga., in 2018. Some in the Brewers organization were bullish on him, noting that he showed aptitude and his changeup was starting to develop. Those officials proved correct. Olson, 24, might end up an All-Star.\n\nWhy Adames is unlikely to be the next Hader\n\nSpeaking of the Brewers, the return from their controversial Josh Hader trade at the 2022 deadline keeps looking better and better.\n\nLeft-hander Robert Gasser, the pitching prospect they acquired from the Padres, has a 0.82 ERA after two starts. Another player in the deal, outfielder Esteury Ruiz, brought them star catcher William Contreras and reliever Joel Payamps in a three-team deal with Atlanta and Oakland 4 1/2 months later.\n\nThe Hader trade jarred the Brewers’ players, who were stunned the team would trade its All-Star closer while it had a three-game lead in the NL Central. Hader to that point in the season had not pitched particularly well, and would be even worse for the Padres before rallying in the playoffs. But the Brewers’ attempt to backfill with Taylor Rogers and Trevor Rosenthal backfired, and the team missed making the playoffs by one game.\n\nWhich raises the question: Would the Brewers attempt a similar move with shortstop Willy Adames, who is even closer to free agency than Hader was? Hader at the time was under club control for two pennant races. Adames, on the other hand, is only months away from hitting the open market.\n\n“I’ve already been traded twice in my career. I know it’s part of the game,” said Adames, who went from the Tigers to the Tampa Bay Rays in the David Price deal in 2014 and the Rays to the Brewers for pitchers Drew Rasmussen and J.P. Feyereisen in 2021. “But you feel comfortable in a place. You create good friendships with guys, create that bond. And then you get traded, it’s like, ‘Man.’”\n\nAdames, 28, probably can rest easy. If the Brewers traded him, they could slide Brice Turang to shortstop and use Joey Ortiz and others at second base. But club officials recognize the internal damage they caused with the Hader deal, and the potential to unsettle the clubhouse again by parting with an everyday player and team leader. Turang and Ortiz might be succeeding in part because Adames is providing them with veteran cover.\n\nChristian Yelich: The Brewers’ player-coach\n\nFive years into a nine-year contract, left fielder Christian Yelich has assumed an outsized role with the Brewers, serving not just as their primary leader, but also acting almost as a coach.\n\nYelich, 32, recently helped Jake Bauers adopt a toe tap, helping the first baseman/outfielder turn around his season. He also eased Turang’s transition to leadoff by speaking extensively to him about hitting in that spot. Last Saturday, Yelich even ran the Brewers’ pre-game bunting drill, one day after dropping down an RBI bunt single himself.\n\nThe Brewers seemed a good bet to regress after losing manager Craig Counsell to the Chicago Cubs, trading staff ace Corbin Burnes to the Orioles and starting the season without two injured stalwarts, closer Devin Williams and right-hander Brandon Woodruff. Instead, the team leads the NL Central.\n\n“We hold ourselves to a certain standard. There’s an accountability here,” Yelich said. “If you want to be on a bad team, do what bad teams do, talk like bad teams do, play like bad teams do. You can do that. That’s fine. But if you want to be on a good team and play winning baseball, you have to do it a certain way.”\n\nAround the horn\n\n• Only the Los Angeles Dodgers spent more than the San Francisco Giants in free agency. But the Giants recently lost seven position players, including both their catchers and three outfielders, in a 10-day span. Their biggest offseason investment — Korean center fielder Jung Hoo Lee, who signed for $113 million plus an $18.825 million posting fee — suffered structural damage to his left shoulder crashing into a wall, and is expected to miss significant time.\n\nBlake Snell, Alex Cobb and Robbie Ray are among the Giants pitchers who remain on the injured list, though Snell is expected to rejoin the club after making one final start on his rehabilitation assignment. Yet, even when the Giants were healthier, they were not playing well.\n\nIn the forgiving world of the expanded postseason, hardly any teams can be considered buried, not with the schedule only about one-fourth complete. But questions persist about the Giants’ offense in particular, especially now with younger players such as Luis Matos, Heliot Ramos and Casey Schmitt assuming larger roles. The entire slope is slippery, considering that Snell and Matt Chapman can opt out at the end of the season — or not.\n\n• The Los Angeles Angels undoubtedly will be sellers, but what exactly do they have to sell? Any chance they had to pull off a blockbuster disappeared when they failed to move Shohei Ohtani at either the 2022 or ‘23 deadlines.\n\nLeft-hander Tyler Anderson, earning $13 million both this season and next, has a 2.92 ERA and might prove attractive to a team looking for a starter. So could lefty Patrick Sandoval, whose 3.52 expected ERA is well below his 5.00 actual mark.\n\nOthers? Infielder Luis Rengifo, outfielders Jo Adell and Taylor Ward and relievers Adam Cimber, Matt Moore and Carlos Estévez could draw interest, the latter two if they start pitching better. Sandoval, Ward, Adell and Rengifo, however, are under club control beyond this season. Trading them likely would signal a lengthier rebuild, something the Angels consistently have been unwilling to do.\n\n• It was no accident when Lance Lynn and Kyle Gibson signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on back-to-back days in November. The two Indiana natives, teammates with the Minnesota Twins in 2018 and Texas Rangers in 2020, have become good friends.\n\nThe day Lynn agreed to his deal with the Cardinals, he texted Gibson and said, “Hey, let’s go play in St. Louis.” Gibson hadn’t heard from the Cardinals in a few days, and thought maybe they chose Lynn over him. Turned out the team wanted both.\n\n• Infielder Oliver Dunn was on his honeymoon in Hawaii when he learned of his trade from the Philadelphia Phillies to the Brewers on Nov. 14. The move came as a total surprise. The Phillies had just told Dunn they would not protect him on their 40-man roster, so he figured if he was going to join another team, it wouldn’t be until the Rule 5 draft in early December.\n\nIt was a hectic time. Dunn left the Arizona Fall League, where he was named Breakout Player of the Year, on Nov. 9. He married his wife Lucy two days later. When he got the call about the trade three days later, at 5 a.m. Hawaii time, he and Lucy didn’t fret. They viewed it just as another reason to celebrate.\n\n• And finally, think Tommy Pham is making a point?\n\nSince joining the Chicago White Sox on April 26, Pham is batting .319 with an .829 OPS. The team, after starting the season 3-22, is 11-7 in games Pham has played. The Sox lost the one game in which he did not appear.\n\nPham, 36, is earning a prorated $3 million for his time in the majors, and he can make an additional $1.5 million in performance bonuses. He also will receive a $500,000 bonus if the White Sox trade him, as they almost certainly will.\n\n(Top photo of Elly De La Cruz: Thearon W. Henderson / Getty Images)"
