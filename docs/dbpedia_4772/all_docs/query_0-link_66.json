        "text": "NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) -- The Yankees have placed third baseman Luis Cruz on the 15-day disabled list due to a right knee sprain.\n\nThe Yankees have been in trouble at the hot corner due to injuries to Alex Rodriguez (hip surgery/quad strain) and Kevin Youkilis (back surgery). Infielder David Adams will be called up from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to fill in for the injured Cruz.\n\nCruz has played in 61 games this season for the Bombers while posting a .145 batting average and 11 RBIs in 173 at-bats. The 29-year-old sprained his knee when the spike on his cleat got stuck in the grass while he was going for a pop-up.\n\nCruz's knee sprain makes him the 17th Yankee on the DL this year."
