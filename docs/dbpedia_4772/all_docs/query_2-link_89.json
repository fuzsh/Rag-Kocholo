        "text": "LOS ANGELES – The only thing that is not fun for the Dodgers right now is watching the scoreboard.\n\nThey keep winning – lately, in their final at-bat. A.J. Ellis’ single in the bottom of the 11th inning Monday drove in Andre Ethier and lifted the Dodgers to a 4-3 comeback win over the San Diego Padres.\n\nOn Sunday, the Dodgers beat the Arizona Diamondbacks on a two-run double by Adrian Gonzalez in the bottom of the ninth inning.\n\nBut the San Francisco Giants keep winning, too, and the Dodgers’ deficit in the NL West remains at 4 1/2 games. San Francisco came back to beat Arizona in the 10th inning Monday.\n\n“Unfortunately, today we knew what the Giants did and what they’re doing,” said Ethier, whose home run in the ninth inning tied the game at 3-3. “We know what we’re chasing. You can say you’re not watching the scoreboard but it’s sitting right behind me in right field.”\n\nFor a moment, as far as the announced crowd of 33,540 could tell, the Dodgers were merely chasing Ellis into the outfield grass, where veteran utilityman Nick Punto – as is his custom – ripped Ellis’ shirt off from the buttons.\n\nMaybe, as Ethier suggested, the Dodgers needed to work on themselves a little before they go to work on the Giants. First place could be on the line when the teams meet in San Francisco this weekend, and the Dodgers gladly will take the momentum of three consecutive wins on the heels of the 1-5 stretch that came before.\n\nEllis’ game-winning single off Padres reliever Cory Burns (0-1) was just his third hit in 15 at-bats through four games of the homestand.\n\nEthier, who finished 2 for 5, singled with two outs in the 11th inning to start the rally. Luis Cruz, who went 4 for 5, followed Ethier’s single with one of his own.\n\n“It lets us all know no matter the score, no matter who we’re facing, we can come back in the game,” Ellis said.\n\nBrandon League (1-1) pitched two scoreless innings of relief for his first win as a Dodger.\n\nPadres third baseman Chase Headley went 2 for 5 with three RBIs. His two-run home run to right field in the first inning off Joe Blanton gave the Dodgers an early 2-0 deficit.\n\nThe Dodgers scored single runs in the fifth and sixth innings to even the score at 2-2. Mark Ellis drove in Cruz from second base with a single, and Hanley Ramirez’s 20th home run of the season cleared the fence in center.\n\nPadres starter Andrew Werner, in his third major league game, put himself in position to win without throwing a pitch in the seventh inning. The left-hander hit a one-out single up the middle off Blanton for his first major league hit.\n\nWith two outs and left-handed hitter Will Venable due up, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly summoned southpaw specialist Randy Choate from the bullpen. Padres manager Bud Black countered by having Logan Forsythe, a right-handed batter, pinch-hit for Venable.\n\nForsythe shot a grounder up the middle headed for second baseman Mark Ellis, but Choate stuck out his bare hand and knocked down the ball.\n\nChoate was injured and forced to come out of the game, Forsythe was safe at first without a throw, and Werner went to second base.\n\nChoate did not need X-rays after the game and said his hand felt “fine.”\n\nSince Choate is the Dodgers’ only healthy left-handed reliever, right-hander Ronald Belisario jogged in to face the switch-hitting Headley. He promptly laced a single that scored pinch-runner Clayton Richard from second base.\n\nIt was the third run charged to Blanton in 6 2/3 innings.\n\njp.hoornstra@inlandnewspapers.com"
