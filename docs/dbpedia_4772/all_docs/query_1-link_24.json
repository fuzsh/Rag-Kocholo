        "text": "BOSTON — Luis Cruz was taught by his father, Luis Cruz Sr., to always learn from his experiences in the field and make adjustments accordingly. The elder Cruz was a professional outfielder in Mexico for 17 years, a hero in some quarters of Mexican baseball, and he passed on the fundamentals of baseball and a respect for the game to his son.\n\n“He was my coach,” Cruz said Sunday before playing his 15th game for the Yankees. “He was my everything.”\n\nA case in point came during the Yankees’ 5-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park on Saturday, when Cruz scored a career-high three runs, rapped out a single, knocked in a run and stole a base.\n\nHe also continued to play strong defense at third base, which could be of increasing value with Alex Rodriguez’s return from injury still uncertain. Rodriguez has a strained left quad and will go back to Tampa, Fla., for treatment.\n\nCruz’s sharp learning curve was evident in the fifth inning on Saturday when he came to the plate with Eduardo Nunez on third base and no outs. The Red Sox had the infield in, looking to cut down Nunez at the plate should Cruz hit a ground ball, which he did. Cruz lunged at a slider from John Lackey and ripped it at shortstop Stephen Drew. Nunez, who was running on contact, was thrown out at home.\n\nTwo innings later, Cruz came to the plate in similar circumstances. Nunez was at third again, this time with one out, and again the Red Sox brought the infield in.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
