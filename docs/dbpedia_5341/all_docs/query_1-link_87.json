        "text": "by JOSEPH BERT SMILEY (1864-1903)\n\nhttps://reelyredd.com/mp3/vs/JBS-StPeterGate-64.mp3\n\nSt. Peter stood guard at the golden gate\n\nWith a solemn mien and air sedate.\n\nWhen up to the top of the golden stair\n\nA man and a woman ascending there.\n\nApplied for admission, they came and stood\n\nBefore St. Peter, so great and good.\n\nIn hopes the City of Peace to win —\n\nAnd asked St. Peter to let them in.\n\nThe woman was tall, and lank and thin,\n\nWith a scraggy beardlet upon her chin.\n\nThe man was short and thick and stout,\n\nHis stomach was built so it rounded out.\n\nHis face was pleasant and all the while\n\nHe wore a kindly and genial smile.\n\nThe choirs in the distance the echoes woke,\n\nAnd the man kept still while the woman spoke:\n\n“O, thou who guardest the gate,” said she,\n\n“We two come hither beseeching thee\n\nTo let us enter the heavenly land\n\nAnd play our harps with the angel band.\n\nOf me, St. Peter, there is no doubt,\n\nThere is nothing from heaven to bar me out.\n\nI’ve been to meeting three times a week,\n\nAnd almost always I’d rise to speak.\n\n“I’ve told the sinners about the day\n\nWhen they’d repent of their evil way.\n\nI’ve told my neighbors — I’ve told them all —\n\n‘Bout Adam and Eve and the primal fall.\n\nI’ve shown them what they’d have to do\n\nIf they’d pass in with the chosen few.\n\nI’ve marked their path of duty clear —\n\nLaid out the plan for their whole career.\n\n“I’ve talked and talked to ’em loud and long,\n\nFor my lungs are good and my voice is strong.\n\nSo, good St. Peter, you will clearly see\n\nThe gate of heaven is open for me.\n\nBut my old man, I regret to say,\n\nHasn’t walked in exactly the narrow way;\n\nHe smokes and he swears, and grave faults he’s got,\n\nAnd I don’t know whether he’ll pass or not.\n\n“He never would pray with an earnest vim,\n\nOr go to revival, or join in a hymn.\n\nSo I had to leave him in sorrow there\n\nWhile I, with the chosen, united in prayer.\n\nHe ate what the pantry chanced to afford,\n\nWhile I, in my purity, sang to the lord.\n\nAnd if cucumbers were all he got,\n\nIt’s a chance if he merited them or not.\n\n“But oh, St. Peter, I love him so,\n\nTo the pleasures of heaven please let him go.\n\nI’ve done enough — a saint I’ve been,\n\nWon’t that atone? Can’t you let him in —\n\nBy my grim gospel, I know ’tis so\n\nThat the unrepentant must fry below;\n\nBut isn’t there some way you can see\n\nThat he may enter whose dear to me?\n\n“It’s a narrow gospel by which I pray,\n\nBut the chosen expect to find some way\n\nOf coaxing, or fooling, or bribing you,\n\nSo that their relations can amble through.\n\nAnd say, St. Peter, it seems to me\n\nThis gate isn’t kept as it ought to be.\n\nYou ought to stand right by the opening there,\n\nAnd never sit down in that easy chair.\n\n“And say, St. Peter, my sight is dimmed,\n\nBut I don’t like the way your whiskers are trimmed;\n\nThey’re cut too wide, and outward toss,\n\nThey’d look better narrow, cut straight across.\n\nWell, we must be going our crown to win.\n\nSo open, St. Peter, and we’ll pass in!”\n\nSt. Peter sat quiet, and stroked his staff,\n\nBut in spite of his office he had to laugh,\n\nThen said, with a fiery gleam in his eye,\n\n“Who’s tending this gateway? you or I? —\n\nThen he arose in his stature tall,\n\nAnd pressed a button upon the wall.\n\nAnd said to an imp, who answered the bell,\n\n“Escort this lady around to hell.”\n\nThe man stood still as a piece of stone —\n\nStood sadly, gloomily there alone.\n\nA life-long settled idea he had\n\nThat his wife was good and he was bad.\n\nHe thought, if the woman went down below,\n\nThat he would certainly have to go —\n\nThat if she went to the regions dim,\n\nThere wasn’t a ghost of a show for him.\n\nSlowly he turned, by habit bent,\n\nTo follow wherever the woman went.\n\nSt. Peter, standing in duty there,\n\nObserved that the top of his head was bare.\n\nHe called the gentleman back, and said,\n\n“Friend, how long have you been wed? —\n\n“Thirty years” (with a weary sigh),\n\nAnd then he thoughtfully added, “Why?”\n\nSt. Peter was silent. With head bent down,\n\nHe raised his hand and scratched his crown.\n\nThen seeming a different thought to take,\n\nSlowly, half to himself, he spake:\n\n“Thirty years with that woman there —\n\nNo wonder the man hasn’t any hair!\n\nSwearing is wicked, smoke’s not good,\n\nHe smoked and swore — I should think he would,\n\nThirty years with that tongue so sharp!\n\nHo! Angel Gabriel! Give him a harp.\n\nA jeweled harp with a golden string!\n\nGood sir, pass in where the angels sing!\n\n“Gabriel, give him a seat alone —\n\nOne with a cushion — up near the throne.\n\nCall up some angels to play their best,\n\nLet him enjoy the music and rest!\n\nSee that on finest ambrosia he feeds,\n\nHe’s had about all the hell he needs.\n\nIt isn’t just hardly the thing to do,\n\nTo roast him on earth and the future too.”\n\nThey gave him a harp with golden strings,\n\nA glittering robe and a pair of wings,\n\nAnd he said, as he entered the Realm of Day,\n\n“Well, this beats cucumbers, any way.”\n\nAnd so, the scripture had come to pass,\n\nThat “the last shall be first and the first shall be last.”"
