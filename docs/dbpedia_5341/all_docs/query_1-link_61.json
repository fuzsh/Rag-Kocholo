        "text": "Classical music has been used for political purposes countless times, both in oppressive regimes (like in Stalin’s Soviet Union and Nazi Germany) and in battles for self-determination and freedom (like in the Finnish independence movement). European revolutions have had classical music as their soundtrack for a very long time.\n\nToday, we’re looking at ten pieces of classical music about freedom, from Beethoven’s opera set in prison to Undine Smith Moore’s defiant piano music about the experience of being Black in America.\n\nLet’s get started:\n\nLudwig van Beethoven: Leonore Overture No. 3 (1806)\n\nIn Beethoven’s opera Fidelio, a Spanish nobleman named Florestan threatens to expose the corruption of a colleague named Pizarro. Pizarro wrongfully imprisons Florestan and tells the rest of the world that he has been killed.\n\nHowever, Florestan’s wife, Leonore, refuses to believe the news. So she dresses up as a boy, renames herself Fidelio, and gets a job in the prison to find out what really happened to her husband.\n\nBy the end of the opera, Leonore ends up in front of her husband just before Pizarro actually goes to kill him. Pizarro, enraged, threatens to murder both husband and wife, but Fidelio/Leonore one-ups him by pulling out a gun, which puts an end to Florestan’s unjust imprisonment.\n\nBeethoven had trouble writing an overture for this opera, and he wrote and discarded several versions. This one – known as the Leonore Overture No. 3 – is sometimes played after Leonore’s rescue of her husband.\n\nGiuseppe Verdi: “Va, pensiero” from Nabucco (1841)\n\nVerdi’s opera Nabucco tells the Biblical story of the Israelites’ exile in oppressive Babylon.\n\nIn the opera, the Israelite slaves sing it as they work, describing how, even in exile, their thoughts are with their homeland.\n\nHowever, this was not the music’s only potential meaning in mid-nineteenth-century Italy. At that time, a movement for Italian independence and unification was gaining steam, and art and music helped to contribute to national pride and identity.\n\nIn 1844, a few years after the premiere of Nabucco, two brothers named Attilio and Emilio Bandiera were working for Italian unification when one of their followers betrayed them. They were taken into custody and died by firing squad, becoming martyrs for the cause.\n\nVerdi did not necessarily endorse such a movement, but whether he liked it or not, his music likely contributed to the atmosphere that ultimately made the revolution possible.\n\nFrédéric Chopin: Heroic Polonaise (1842)\n\nChopin was very proud of his Polish ancestry.\n\nHowever, when he was twenty years old, he chose to leave Warsaw to make a musical career in a bigger city.\n\nNo sooner had he left for Vienna with his dear friend, political activist Tytus Woyciechowski, than Warsaw broke out into armed conflict.\n\nThe November Uprising in Warsaw lasted from November 1830 until October 1831. (Woyciechowski, for his part, as soon as he heard about the uprising, returned to Warsaw. Chopin stayed behind.)\n\nThe Poles fought their occupiers, the Russians, but were ultimately crushed.\n\nChopin was devastated when he heard about the outcome. He wrote in his journal, “Oh God! … You are there, and yet you do not take vengeance!”\n\nOver the years that followed, he became increasingly obsessed with Polish identity. He began incorporating polonaises – a dance form that originated in Poland – into his piano music.\n\nHe also began dating Paris-based authoress George Sand, who backed the Polish cause in her writings. After he wrote the Heroic Polonaise, she drew a direct line between the Polonaise and other countries’ fights for freedom and self-determination, writing, “The inspiration! The force! The vigour! There is no doubt that such a spirit must be present in the [1848] French Revolution. From now on, this Polonaise should be a symbol, a heroic symbol.”\n\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky: 1812 Overture (1880)\n\nThe overture was commissioned to celebrate the completion of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in St. Petersburg.\n\nConstruction of the cathedral had started generations earlier as a gesture of thanksgiving to God after Napoleon’s ill-fated attempt to overtake Russia in 1812.\n\nTo celebrate the Russians’ preservation of their freedom, Tchaikovsky wrote an overture about the fight, featuring excerpts of the Marsaillaise and Russian folk songs.\n\nHe underlined the importance of the victory by writing parts for large orchestra, brass band, church bells, and even cannons.\n\nJean Sibelius: Finlandia (1899)\n\nFinlandia is Sibelius’s single most famous work. It was written for the Press Celebrations of 1899, a Finnish event that protested press censorship by the Russian Empire.\n\nIn order to sidestep Russian censorship, the piece was initially performed under over-the-top innocuous titles like “Happy Feelings at the Awakening of Finnish Spring.”\n\nHowever, the piece was not just about happy feelings; it was clearly also a rebellious call to arms against oppression.\n\nFinlandia portrays struggle, then transitions into a serene melody symbolizing the noble spirit of the Finnish people. That serene melody might sound like an old hymn, but it was actually composed by Sibelius specifically for this work. The work ends with rousing energy.\n\nAmy Beach: A Song of Liberty (1902)\n\nAmerican composer Amy Beach wrote A Song of Liberty for piano and women’s choir. In it, she set lyrics by Frank Lebby Stanton, the first poet laureate of Georgia.\n\nThe song traces themes about American national identity and liberty and how, in the narrator’s view, the American penchant for liberty stretches “from sounding sea to sea”, in words that echo Katharine Lee Bates’s lyrics for what later became known as “America the Beautiful.”\n\nHail to our Country! strong she stands,\n\nNor fears the war drum’s beat.\n\nThe sword of Freedom in her hands,\n\nThe tyrant at her feet!\n\nEthel Smyth: March of the Women (1910)\n\nComposer Ethel Smyth was born in 1858 in Kent. She was a rebel from childhood, demanding to be allowed to study music in Europe and locking herself in her room until her father let her go.\n\nNot surprisingly, she was a major supporter of the women’s suffrage movement. (She even taught activist Emmeline Pankhurst how to throw stones at windows.)\n\nIn 1910, she joined the Women’s Social and Political Union and actually went so far as to give up her musical career for two years to contribute to the movement.\n\nShe returned to music briefly in 1911 when she composed the March of the Women. During this time, she was arrested for her activism and imprisoned in Holloway Prison. Her fellow suffragettes would march in the prison yard singing the March while she’d conduct them leaning out the window with a toothbrush.\n\nUndine Smith Moore: Before I’d Be A Slave (1953)\n\nAfrican-American composer Undine Smith Moore was born in Virginia in 1904 and died in 1989. By the end of her prolific career, she was known as “the Dean of Black Women Composers.” She often wove themes of the Black American experience into her work.\n\nIn 1953, she wrote a piece for solo piano called Before I’d Be a Slave. She described the program of the work:\n\nIt follows a program which I would hope is evident in the music without verbal explanation – in general:\n\nIn frustration and chaos of slaves who wish to be free\n\nIn the depths – a slow and ponderous struggle marked by attempts to escape-anyway-being bound-almost successful attempt at flight\n\nTug of war with the oppressors\n\nA measure of freedom won – some upward movement less lacerating\n\nContinued aspiration-determination-affirmation.\n\nDmitri Shostakovich: Symphony No. 11 (1957)\n\nIn his eleventh symphony, Dmitri Shostakovich turned to the story of the 1905 Russian Revolution for creative inspiration.\n\nThis symphony has often been described as a soundtrack without a movie. It’s easy to see why: the work lasts for an hour with no breaks, and every movement contains a program.\n\nThe first movement is about the quiet in the Palace Square before unarmed protesters marching to the palace were shot by imperial forces. The second movement depicts the forces beginning to attack the crowd, while the third movement is a memorial to those who have just lost their lives. The finale hints at the 1917 revolution – in which the royal family was defeated once and for all.\n\nIt is possible – although not certain – that Shostakovich was inspired to write this symphony at least in part because he had sympathy for the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Testimony about his political positions is abundant and often contradictory. But aside from all of that, it is very easy to read a narrative of struggle, liberty, and self-determination into this music.\n\nFrederic Rzewski: The People United Will Never Be Defeated! (1975)\n\nSome people believe that this is among the greatest sets of themes and variations ever composed! It was written by composer Frederic Rzewski, an American composer who lived between 1938 and 2021.\n\nThis work consists of a Chilean protest song, ¡El pueblo unido jamás será vencido! (The people united will never be defeated!), and 36 variations on it.\n\nRzewski wrote the work as a commentary on the popular resistance to oppressive dictator Augusto Pinochet, who came to power with the support of the American government in 1973.\n\nThe work is massive, lasting an hour, and is also massively demanding. For one, the score asks the pianist to whistle and slam the piano lid!\n\nConclusion\n\nWhenever people feel oppressed by any force, it is second nature to create or take comfort in music that expresses the pathos, fury, tragedy, and occasionally triumph that can arise when seeking freedom…and these ten works of classical music about freedom prove it!\n\nWhat’s your favorite classical music about freedom?\n\nFor more of the best in classical music, for our E-Newsletter"
