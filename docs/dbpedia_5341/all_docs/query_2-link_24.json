The world hath need Of the humbler strains that fall\n\nOn the wayside lone--on the paths that lead To the light that shines for all.\n\nWEDDED\n\nWell, you are wedded, and around your life Twine two great joys; for some one calls you wife,\n\nAnd child-lips murmur : \" Mother ! \" and you smile After long years of sorrow and heart-strife.\n\nSmile up into the eyes that meet your own-- Feel the strong, sheltering arm around you thrown\n\nAnd with the loveliest words of love you while The hours away, no longer dark and lone.\n\nYou feel the clinging of your child; you feel His arms about your neck; his kisses steal\n\nAway the sigh that trembles to your lips When faithful Memory doth some face reveal\n\nFrom out the fading past; but tears or sighs Are not for your sweet lips--for your bright eyes;\n\nWhat earthly joy can now your joy eclipse ? For, choosing well, your love could be but wise.\n\nAnd yet, I fancy that upon your brow There is a faint, sad shadow resting now;\n\nThe bended head droops lower, till at last Your weeping face in your pale hands you bow\n\nWEDDED\n\n-ftyjflmd give yourself to grief! Is it not so ? ''!$IL voice calls to you from the long ago-- i A hand is stretched toward you from the past ;JAnd joy is lost in bitterness and woe !\n\nYou wonder why the tears your eyes should fill; You whisper to your breaking heart: \" Be still! \"\n\nBut the heart moans with yearning unsufficed-- Vague yearning, which the world can never fill.\n\nFor women love but once; and if denied That first, sweet love, they live unsatisfied, ; Clinging to it as to the cross of Christ-- A cross whereon their hearts are crucified.\n\nAnd this is life--the life which we must lead: A life of dire distress and sorest need;\n\nA life which longs, but vainly longs, for rest-- Rest for the hands that toil--the hearts that bleed.\n\nAye! this is life. Heaven's mercy on us, sweet! 'Be it that you and I no more shall meet\n\nUntil the grass is green above the breast, And God's white daisies grow at head and feet!\n\nDOWN ON THE OLD PLANTATION\n\nIn spite of politics an' sich A-worryin' of the nation,\n\nWe're doin' well in Georgy lan' Down on the oP plantation.\n\nWe're fixin' now fer cotton white-- To fleece the fiel's from left to right, An' take ol\" Georgy out o' sight\n\nDown on the ol' plantation !\n\nAin't nothin' throws us out o' gear, Or hinders our salvation;\n\nWe're good fer all the wear an' tear Down on the ol' plantation.\n\nWe're workin' whilst it's called to-day To meet the Good Times on the way, An' life's a regular hooray !\n\nDown on the ol' plantation.\n\nFer still the seasons as they go Shout joy from every station,\n\nThe joy o' reapin' what we sow Down on the ol' plantation.\n\n4\n\niDowN ON THE OLD PLANTATION\n\n:\n\nJoy in the singin' o' the rills--\n\nThe mockin' birds, the whippoorwills j\n\nWe've struck the halleluia hills\n\n'<'.,-\n\nDown on the ol' plantation!\n\nTHE WORLD-WAY OF THE SOUTH\n\nNot lost in a languor of blisses, In valleys sweet-breathing of bloom,\n\nThough roses are fain of her kisses And stars braid her brows in the gloom ;\n\nThough lilies lean to her and love her, And the love-song is sweet in her mouth,\n\nAnd the world green--the skies blue above her-- Sing the South ! Sing the South ! Sing the South!\n\nIn the strength of high faith she hath risen, Her flag on her mountains unfurled;\n\nShe hath rent the great hills that imprison The glittering wealth of a world.\n\nWith the thrill of a new life elated The harvest its fruitfulness yields:\n\nAnd the ships, far sea-faring, are freighted With the fleece of her flowering fields.\n\nHers all the crowned hills of Endeavor, The garlands, the triumphs of life;\n\nHer voice is a clarion ever-- A battle-song heard in the strife; 6\n\nWOBLD-WAY OF THE SOUTH\n\nWith Freedom in fairest communion. With Liberty facing the Fates,\n\nLove-linked to the stars of the Union, And the flag rippling over the States.\n\nCHRISTMAS TIMES IN GEORGIA\n\nDon't care how the cotton sells-- Christmas times in Georgia!\n\nHear the ringin' o' the bells-- Christmas times in Georgia!\n\nTake your place, Miss Nancy-Lou, Eyes like violets bright with dew! Sugar is sweet, an' so are you--\n\nChristmas times in Georgia!\n\nDon't care how the country goes-- Christmas times in Georgia !\n\nLoud an' sweet the bugle blows-- Christmas times in Georgia !\n\nTake your place, Malinda-Jane, Curls as bright as April rain, Lips as sweet as sugar-cane--\n\nChristmas times in Georgia !\n\nDon't care how the fiddle playi Christmas times in Georgia!\n\nLet the roarin' oak-fires blaze-- Christmas times in Georgia! 8\n\nCHRISTMAS TIMES IN GEORGIA\n\nCome from east, and come from west,\n\nIn your silks an\" satins dressed,\n\n,\n\nKiss the one you love the best--\n\nChristmas times in Georgia!\n\nBalance to your partners all--\n\nI;\n\nChristmas times in Georgia!\n\nLead the ladies round the hall--\n\n;j\n\nChristmas times in Georgia!\n\n|y Roof is ringin'; snow an' sleet j\n\nBut the music's in your feet!\n\nGirls '11 pay the forfeits sweet--\n\nChristmas times in Georgia!\n\nIN AN OLD INN\n\nA jolly landlord and a blazing fire; Without the snow, the sleet.\n\nLet the bleak winter wreak his heart's desire! Here the old friends we meet.\n\nWhile fast the shadows of the night are falling No comfort shall we lack;\n\nFor is not Falstaff from a corner calling: \" Sirrah, a cup of sack ?\"\n\nIt is no time for grief--for melancholy; Great tales there are to tell.\n\nThe \" Sluggish Knight\" drinks with the friar jolly-- Not from Saint Dunstan's well.\n\nTrampling of feet--voices in hallways humming; Here a tired traveller nods ;\n\nA trumpet sounds * * * \" The coach -- the coach is coming!--\n\nO for a coach, ye gods ! \"\n\nCare is a river, but we've crossed the ferry To where the bright fields bloom.\n\nChaucer comes in with tales of Canterbury; Room for the old man--room !\n\nV\n\nIN AN OLD INN\n\nHe scarce hath told the tale, sweet in the telling, Ere a glad eye discerns\n\nA gentler guest. A chorus glad is swelling: 'Fore God, here's Bobby Burns! \"\n\nWas ever yet so wonderful a party ? Dash down, O wintry rain!\n\nClink glasses, O my masters- drink ye hearty Until we meet again !\n\nIt\n\nA SONG OF HER LOVER\n\nI'm a-goin' to meet my lover at the grindin' of the cane--\n\nAt the grindin' of the cane, At the grindin' of the cane; He's comin' on his pony in a canter down the\n\nlane-- He passes all the purty girls, an' gives his pony\n\nrein; Fer my lover's goin' to meet me, My lover's goin' to meet me At the grindin'--at the grindin' of the cane!\n\nI'm a-goin' to meet my lover at the grindin' of the\n\ncane--\n\nAt the grindin' of the cane,\n\nAt the grindin' of the cane;\n\nHe gallops 'crost the medders--he canters down the\n\nlane,\n\nWith not a kiss fer Jenny, nor a wavin' hand to Jane;\n\nFer my lover's goin' to meet me,\n\nMy lover's goin' to meet me\n\nAt the grindin'--at the grindin' of the cane!\n\n12\n\nf\n\nA SONG OF HER LOVER\n\nTho wouldn't wait to meet him as he rides--as he rides\n\nTo the grindin' of the cane, To the grindin' of the cane; fith the foam, like snow, a-fallin' from his frisky\n\npony's sides; ' he'll be the best of husbands, an' I'll be the best\n\nof brides; Fer my lover's goin' to meet me: With a kiss of love he'll greet me \\.t the grindin'--at the grindin' of the cane!\n\nAN OLD MAN'S MUSING\n\nI\n\nAin't takin' no stock in the snow--it ain't what I love an' admire;\n\nI'm jest settin' here in a rickety chair an' smokin' my pipe by the fire.\n\nThe trees are like skeletons white that shake in the wind as it blows,\n\nAn' out in the black o' the night the hills they look ghostly--Lord knows!\n\nII Ain't takin' no stock in the snow; but, somehow or\n\nother, it seems With its lonesome-like whiteness, to take me fur back\n\nto the valley o' dreams; An' I'm thinkin' o' friends that have left me--the\n\nfriends that I loved long ago, Some of 'em fur an' divided, an' some lyin' under the\n\nsnow. III\n\nI'm thinkm' of how, by the fireplace, the good wife was settin' that day\n\nWhen the snowflakes was fallin', an' rosy the chil dren come in from their play 5\n\nAN OLD MAN'S MUSING\n\ngWhen I had not a thought that I'd ever be settin' as 18 lonesome as this, IfFur off from the love o' the children come in from '%. the snow fer a kiss !\n\nIV But mother an' children--where are they ? The\n\nmother went home long ago To the place where the light is eternally bright, an'\n\nthere's never no winter an' snow. ;;An' the children--they're fur from the home place, ;|> an' mostly fergittin to write, ;An' that's why I'm feelin' so lonesome in the snow ;J; : that is fallin' to-night!\n\nV But it's Life, an I ain't a-complainin', fer the Lord \">'.. sent me skies that was fair, An' I'm thankful to-night fer this fire's bright light\n\nan' the rest o' this rickety chair; /But I still fall to thinkin' an' sighin',--an' I reckon\n\n'twill always be so, !;Fill Life's fire is a handful of ashes, an' I pass o'er\n\nthe hills of the snow. 15\n\nA MORNING SONG\n\nI Open wide the windows--\n\nThe green hills are in sight, Winds are whispering, \" Violets ! \"\n\nAnd--there's a daisy white, And, the great sun says \" Good morning ! \" and the\n\nvalleys sing, \" Delight! \"\n\nII\n\nOpen wide the windows--\n\nLife will not let us rest!\n\n'\n\nA thousand airy messengers\n\ni\n\nFrom rosy east to west\n\n.\n\n;\n\nAre come with sweetest singing--with roses for\n\nLove's breast.\n\nIll\n\nf\n\nNo more the white-browed Winter\n\nj\n\nWith stormy, wild alarms !\n\nThere's a poet listening--listening,\n\nWhere a sense of music charms\n\nEven the woman in the doorway with the baby in her\n\narms.\n\n|\n\n16\n\n'\n\n\\\n\nA MORNING SONG\n\nIV Take hands and meet the morning\n\nOn the hills--in valleys deep : The Darkness was but dreaming\n\nWhere we felt the shadows creep. Grief wakens on the breast of Joy who sighed him\n\nself to sleep.\n\nV And the green of field and meadow,\n\nAnd the enfolding blue above, The clear call of the robin--\n\nSilver-thrush and gray-winged dove, Shall seem to us a recompense for lost, remembered\n\nLove !\n\nVI Open wide the windows !\n\nSweet smells the rain-blest sod; The seed dreams of the harvest\n\nAnd the color's in the clod; And the whole world breathes the beauty of the Light\n\nand Love of God!\n\nA LITTLE COT\n\nIt's a little cot In a little spot, With a little heaven has sent, An' her hand in mine In rain or shine, An' I'm goin' my way content.\n\nI'm goin' my way content, With the blue skies over me bent; An' the world is right, an' the world is wrong, But my heart keeps singin' a thankful song.\n\nIt's a little way From that cot each day In the toilin' world I roam; But the whole day long That sweet heart-song, And a kiss when the stars sing : \" Home! \"\n\nA kiss for a welcome home, When the bees are hid in the comb ; An' the world is right, an' the world is wrong, But Love keeps singin' the same sweet song.\n\n18\n\nA LITTLE COT\n\nThe same sweet song Where the toilers throng An' the skies are cold an' gray j For I hear the beat Of her heart so sweet, Callin' me--far away !\n\nCallin' me--far away To the blooms an' the bells o' May; An' the world is right, an' the world is wrong, But her heart keeps singin' that same sweet song.\n\nAn' the little cot In the little spot Is dearer than domes that rise; For the day is bright An' the night is light With the love in a woman's eyes.\n\nWith the love in a woman's eyes-- A love that never dies; An' the world is right, an' the world is wrong, But Love keeps singin' the same sweet song.\n\nTHE WAY OLD GLORY GOES In sunlight or in stormy day, With friendliness or foes, The country's going just the way-- The way \" Old Glory \" goes. To-day--to-morrow--still she waves Over earth's Freedom or our graves !\n\nShe arches earth--a rainbow's ray, Or, when the storm-wind blows,\n\nA beacon-blaze, she lights the way-- The way that freedom goes.\n\nTo-day--to-morrow--still she waves Over our glory or our graves.\n\n20\n\nWHEN THE OLD MAN GOT RELIGION\n\nWhen the ol' man got religion things sorter changed aroun',\n\nThe house wuz topsy-turvy, the worl' wuz upside down;\n\nWe didn't know what hit us; 'peared like we'd started wrong;\n\nLife had to be made over to his halleluia song!\n\n'Twuz, in the winter season ? He lit in thisaway:\n\n'. He pulled the kiver off us long 'fore the break o' day;\n\n\" Stir roun' ! stir roun'!\" he'd holler all up an' down\n\nI\n\nthe stairs--\n\nf \" This life's too short fer sleepin'; rise up fer family\n\nprayers!\"\n\n; We crawled out from that kiver with mournful sighs\n\nI\n\nan' groans,\n\nThe teeth of us a-chatterin' like minstrels beatin'\n\nbones!\n\nAn', ranged aroun' the fireplace--a mighty mournful\n\n!\n\nring--\n\n' He'd holler: \" Hymn Two Hundred : Let ever'body\n\nsing! \"\n\n21\n\nUP FROM GEORGIA\n\nAn' you never heard such singin' sence life an' time begun;\n\nThe angels couldn't stand it, an' stopped their ears an' run!\n\nFer the music, comin' zig-zag from them new singin' ranks,\n\nWuz worse than storm-winds howlin' roun' Jordan's stormy banks !\n\nHe kept the whole house hustlin': \" Work while it's called To-day !\n\nAn' pray whilst you're a-workin'; but work an' work away!\"\n\nBut ever' youngster of us--with sad an' sollum face, Wuz prayin' fer the ol' man to fall away from\n\ngrace !\n\nLong years have passed an' left us still with our work to do;\n\nAn' the ol' man, bein' weary, went Home an' left us, too ;\n\nLed by his homely counsel safe to the shelterin' fold--\n\nSightin' the fur-off city with shinin' streets of gold.\n\n22\n\nI\n\nWHEN THE OLD MAN GOT RELIGION\n\nAn' evermore we're praisin' of the Providence on high\n\nThat the ol' man*got religion in the happy days gone by;\n\nAn' we hope to hear him shoutin', when we reach the heavenly stairs,\n\nIn the bright, Celestial mornin',--\" Rise up to fam'ly prayers!\"\n\nHERE'S HOPIN'\n\nYear ain't been the very best;-- Purty hard by trouble pressed; But the rough way leads to rest,--\n\nHere's hopin'!\n\nMaybe craps wuz short; the rills Couldn't turn the silent mills ; But the light's behind the hills,--\n\nHere's hopin'!\n\nWhere we planted roses sweet Thorns come up an' pricked the feet 5 But this old world's hard to beat,--\n\nHere's hopin'!\n\nP'r'aps the buildin' that we planned 'Gainst the cyclone couldn't stand; But, thank God we've got the land,--\n\nHere's hopin'!\n\nMaybe flowers we hoped to save Have been scattered on a grave; But the heart's still beatin' brave,--\n\nHere's hopin' I 24\n\nHERE'S HOPIN'\n\nThat we'll see the mornin' light-- That the very darkest night Can't hide heaven from our sight,--\n\nHere's hopin'!\n\nTWO PICTURES\n\nI\n\nIn the dewy morn I wove the red sash for my lover's sword, In the sound of the silver bugles Blowing merrily over the violet vales. My red lips leaned to the steel, And kissed it for a holy cause. And then--the lips of my lover-- And over the orchards The music of a farewell song.\n\nII\n\nIn the mist-wreathed twilight I wove the white shroud for my lover's sword, In the sound of the muffled drums Moaning over the darkened vales. My white lips leaned to the steel, And kissed it, and were crimsoned. And then--the cold lips of my lover, And over the orchards The long, desolate Night!\n\nWHEN THE FALL TIME COMES\n\nThere's somethin' like a jingle an' a tingle in the air, Fer the honey's jest a-drippin' from the hives;\n\nThe fields are lookin' frosty with the white that blos soms there,\n\nAn' the corn crap's jest the biggest of our lives!\n\nSummer's a-goin'-- Needn't beat the drums;\n\nWe're bound to have a showin* When the fall time comes!\n\nThere's somethin' like a jingle an' a tingle every where,\n\nAn' the blue smoke has a meanin' as it curls ; They're tunin' of the fiddle, an' there's music in the\n\nair, An' we'll soon be swinging corners with the girls !\n\nSummer's a-goin'-- Needn't beat the drums;\n\nWe're bound to have a showin* When the fall time comes!\n\n27\n\nTHE MERRY ROUND\n\nSich a round o' pleasure--goin' left an' right, Daytime is a picnic--dancin' ever' night! Never wuz so happy--valley, plain, or hill, Forty dozen weddin's, and the women willin' still!\n\nGrowled about the weather when the summer sun Wilted all the cornblades--made the toilers run !

Sing till the firm hills shake !\n\nSing 'till the seas are answering-- Sing till the heart shall break ! 157\n\nUP FROM GEORGIA\n\nThou shalt find little part In earth's scant love and trust;\n\nBut for thy sweetest song, Sweetheart, Measures of tears and dust!\n\nYet sing! for song is still Of graces the one grace ;\n\nThe singers who God's word fulfill Shall see Him face to face.\n\nSing thou of love that lives Where strifes and hatreds throng;\n\nThat, being wounded, still forgives-- That suffers and is strong.\n\nNo pence shall fill thy purse; (Thy soul hath starved too long !)\n\nFor well we know gold is the curse-- The broad world's curse of song !\n\nSing not for worldly gain-- Sing not for dark or fair :\n\nSing thou in pleasure, peace and pain, Because the song is there ! 158\n\nTo A SINGER\n\nSing brave, and be content, When the world-thunders roll,\n\nThat in the night a great Voice sent A message to thy soul!\n\nFor still by hill and glen, And where the cities throng\n\nThey break the singer's heart and then They glory in the song.\n\n159\n\nTHE PASSING OF A HERO\n\nNat Jones had been a-readin' 'bout the novelists of late\n\nThat made enough to corner half the country's real estate;\n\n'Bout the hundred thousand copies that the sufferin' public took,\n\nAn' says he: \" I've 'bout decided I wuz born to write a book !\n\n\" It '11 help to paint the homestead, send the children ; all to school,\n\nBuy Sally a planner, take the mortgage off the mule. Too long I've hid my talents, jest encumberin' the\n\ngroun'\n\nThey'll be runnin' me fer congress ef I keep a-loafin' 'roun' ! \"\n\nSo, without no more considering says he : \" I'll jest begin.\"\n\nBought a quart of ink, an' pens enough to fence the cattle in;\n\nAn' he turned out blotted pages worse than \" moon shine \" from the stills,\n\nAn' 'twuzjest a benediction to the busy paper mills. 160\n\nTHE PASSING OF A HERO\n\nBut his family got anxious, an' 'twuz noticed 'roun' the town\n\nWhatever he wuz writin' up, he kept a-thinnin' down :\n\nWith the sorrow of the ages showin' solemn in his face\n\nHe went around as mournful as a sinner lost to grace.\n\n\" I tell you, I'm in trouble \"--the same wuz plain to see--\n\n\" That everlastin' hero is a-gittin' 'way with me! In the middle o' the story, when I had him safe an'\n\nsoun', He took a dost o' pizen, an' I jest can't bring him\n\n'roun'!\"\n\nAn' the sympathizin' citizens would tell him, with a sigh,\n\n\" Perhaps the thing wuz Providence : It wuz his time to die.\"\n\nAn* at that he'd leave 'em, scowlin', an' sit him down again\n\nAn' resurrect that hero with one splutter o' the pen ! 161\n\nUP FROM GEORGIA\n\nAn' next day, when they'd meet him, with \" How's yer hero's health ? \"\n\nHe'd smile, an' tell 'em : \" Old man died an' left him | lots o' wealth ;\n\nBut the thing that sorter puzzles me, an' circum scribes his glory,\n\nIs, where the old man come from--fer there warn't none in the story !\n\n\" I've got to make a place for him, but how it's to be done\n\nIs more'n I kin tell you, 'less I start where I begun !
