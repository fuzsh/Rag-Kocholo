        "text": "Frank Lebby Stanton or F. L. Stanton was an American Lyrist born on February 22, 1857 in Atlanta, GA. He was the first professional columnist for the Atlanta Constitution and the first poet laureate for the state of Georgia. Mr. Stanton was often called “the James Whitcomb Riley of the South”; The two writers were close friends who frequently traded poetic ideas. Stanton frequently wrote in the dialect of black southerners and poor whites, although he was an opponent of the less-admirable aspects of the culture in which he lived (such as lynching), and he tended to be compatible in philosophy with the southern progressivism of his employer, the Atlanta Constitution, where he was an editorial writer. (Source: AllPoetry.com)\n\nThe Graveyard Rabbit\n\nIn the white moonlight, where the willow waves,\n\nHe halfway gallops among the graves—\n\nA tiny ghost in the gloom and gleam,\n\nContent to dwell where the dead men dream,\n\nBut wary still!\n\nFor they plot him ill;\n\nFor the graveyard rabbit hath a charm\n\n(May God defend us!) to shield from harm.\n\nOver the shimmering slabs he goes—\n\nEvery grave in the dark he knows;\n\nBut his nest is hidden from human eye\n\nWhere headstones broken on old graves lie.\n\nWary still!\n\nFor they plot him ill;\n\nFor the graveyard rabbit, though sceptics scoff,\n\nCharmeth the witch and the wizard off!\n\nThe black man creeps, when the night is dim,\n\nFearful, still, on the track of him;\n\nOr fleetly follows the way he runs,\n\nFor he heals the hurts of the conjured ones.\n\nWary still!\n\nFor they plot him ill;\n\nThe soul’s bewitched that would find release,—\n\nTo the graveyard rabbit go for peace!\n\nHe holds their secret—he brings a boon\n\nWhere winds moan wild in the dark o’ the moon;\n\nAnd gold shall glitter and love smile sweet\n\nTo whoever shall sever his furry feet!\n\nWary still!\n\nFor they plot him ill;\n\nFor the graveyard rabbit hath a charm\n\n(May God defend us!) to shield from harm.\n\nStanton died in 1927 and was buried in Atlanta's Westview Cemetery. One of his most widely quoted lines appears on his tombstone, a quatrain titled “The World:” (Source: Georgia Center for the Book)\n\nThis world we're a'livin' in\n\nIs mighty hard to beat.\n\nYou get a thorn with every rose.\n\nBut ain't the roses sweet?"
