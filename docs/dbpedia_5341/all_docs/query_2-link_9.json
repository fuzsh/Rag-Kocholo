        "text": "About the Author\n\nFrank Lebby Stanton was a prominent American journalist, poet, and lyricist. Best known for his column \"Just From Georgia,\" published in the Atlanta Constitution, Stanton earned the nickname \"The Poet Laureate of Georgia\" for his folksy and sentimental verse.\n\nHis poems, primarily written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, often celebrated the simple joys of life, nature, and home, resonating with a wide readership in the American South. He was a master of dialect poetry, using colloquial language and rhythms to capture the essence of Southern speech and character. This accessible style made his work popular with both literary critics and the general public."
