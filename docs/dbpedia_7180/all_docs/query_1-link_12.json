        "text": "Barbra’s Career Takes Flight ... The 1970’s\n\nBy Matt Howe / Barbra-Archives.com\n\nI look forward to working less and simplifying my life, to fulfilling some of my potential as an individual and as a woman. My little-girl fantasy of being a recording star, a theater star, a concert star and a movie star is impossible to maintain; each of them suffers. There is so much else to learn, so much more to do. What Iâd like is more timeâtime not only to read the stacks of political journals that have been piling up, but also time to read Good Housekeeping to find out different ways to decorate my sonâs sandwiches.\n\n—(Barbra Streisand, circa 1970)\n\nAfter winning the Oscar for her performance in Funny Girl (1968), Streisand and manager Marty Erlichman set their sights on the movies. Streisand signed a contract with Ray Stark and his Rastar Productions that committed her to four feature films of his choice, in essence; Funny Girl being the first. âWe go through periods where we love and hate each other,â Streisand confessed about Ray Stark. âHeâs a real character, an original.â\n\nIn order to discuss Barbra Streisandâs career in the 1970s, one must look back to 1969 when Barbra took a proactive step for artistic control of her film career. She joined forces with actors Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier to form First Artists Production Company, Ltd. (Steve McQueen joined in 1971, and Dustin Hoffman in 1972). The company guaranteed the actors complete creative autonomy over their films. They agreed to make three pictures for which they received no advance money in payment. The films were to cost in the $3 to $5 million dollar range. Their profits were in the backend: 10% of the gross film rental and 25-33% of the profit.\n\nUpon entering into the First Artists Production Company deal, Streisand told the press: âI have always had to be free to play the roles and sing the songs I felt strongly and instinctively were right for me. I know that my new associates have the same desire for artistic individuality and total commitment. This company will fill that need for each individual and at the same time weâll have a teamwork situation based on mutual respect and understanding. Weâll be making many diverse films and weâre determined that every one of themâdrama or comedy or musicalâwill reach the very high standards we demand of ourselves.â\n\nOn A Clear Day You Can See Forever (1970)\n\nThe Owl & The Pussycat (1970)\n\nBesides her film and television work, Streisand also concentrated on political causes. In June 1970 Streisand supported Bella Abzug in her campaign for the Democratic seat in Congress. Streisand held a fundraiser for Abzug in her New York home, and also joined the candidate as she rode around in a flatbed truck, campaigning.\n\nStreisand spent the first few years of the 1970s performing live in Las Vegas.\n\nHilton\n\nRiviera\n\nShe also made bold attempts to record modern music:\n\nStoney End album\n\nBarbra Joan Streisand album\n\nOn October 28, 1972 a telethon for George McGovernâs presidential campaign was broadcast on King-TV in Washington state. Included were filmed endorsements for McGovern from Barbra Streisand and Carroll OâConnor. The show was one hour in length.\n\nLive Concert at the Forum (1972)\n\nWhat's Up, Doc? (1972)\n\nUp the Sandbox (1972)\n\nThe Way We Were (1973)\n\nIn May 1973 Reporter A. H. Weiler wrote a story that Barbraâs next film role would be a nurse in Paramount Picturesâ comedy-drama With or Without Roller Skates. âThe movie will be adapted from an as yet-unpublished novel by George Slavin,â said Peter Bart, Paramountâs vice president for production. âThe story is loosely based on taped interviews Slavin did with an actual New York nurse who worked in war veteransâ hospitals for many years.â Streisandâs longtime manager, Marty Erlichman, was pegged to produce the picture â his first film production! âBarbra and I met the nurse from the book twice,â Erlichman told Weiler. âShe is a fascinating woman â hilariously funny, and very realistic about her running battle with hospital authorities over what she considers the rights of her patients.â The only part of this story that actually ended up transpiring was that Erlichman produced Streisandâs next film â in which she had a non-singing role in an old-fashioned comedy (For Pete's Sake, 1974).\n\nStreisand met Jon Peters, and by the mid-1970s, he had become an important part of both her personal life and professional career.\n\nJon Peters explained, âI was a recluse until I met her. I lived in the mountains in a house I built out of old wood and stucco. Everything was very overgrown. Barbraâs house is very manicured. ”\n\nBarbra elaborated: âDo you know how wonderful it is for me to be with someone where Iâm not the only one with an idea about what we should do on Sunday? In the beginning he was really crazy, a nut. He took me to a party once and said he wanted to go for a walk with me, then put me on his shoulders and wouldnât let me down. He was so vital, so verbal, really terrific and alive. Heâs half Cherokee Indian, you know, and not frightened by the sea or the mountains or sharks or things that Iâm afraid of. And I like a man who isnât afraid.â\n\nâYou know,” Barbra said, “Iâve experienced one part of my career, and I feel now that Iâm in another phase. My star started rising in 1964 and now itâs more than ten years later and watching Jonâs star rise is like having the whole thing happen again. And Jon has a way of seeing me, he knows me as a woman, as a sexual being, and Iâm tired of being just Funny Girl, a self-deprecating waif.â\n\nButterfly album\n\nLazy Afternoon album\n\nStreisand challenged herself in the 1970s. In July 1975, Barbra wanted to perform in a Shakespeare play. Sheâd talked about playing Juliet to reporters since she first came on the scene. So Barbra took a class at the Actorsâ Studio West. With Sally Kirkland, Barbra worked on scenes from Romeo and Juliet.\n\nKirkland told Craig Hall (Barbranews.com), âWe went to see Lee Strasberg. He gave us a scene from Romeo and Juliet âand the tears started to roll down her faceâI said âThe emotion that youâre feeling now, is how Juliet felt about Romeoâ. We initially did it at Barbraâs Carolwood homeâ she kicked ass in front of Lee Strasberg and the Actorâs Studio, he said she was one of the best Julietâs he had ever seen.\n\nStreisand recalled the scene: âWhen I played Juliet at the Actors Studio and the nurse finally tells me sheâs set up a meeting with Romeo, I actually froze. Uh, oh, my God, married? Really? Could I cope with that? Onstage, I became numb, and I believe that was the right feeling.â\n\nStreisand was proud of her work, too. âYou know what I think is the best thing I have ever done?â she explained to Playboy magazine in 1977. âIt was a scene from Romeo and Juliet at the Actors Studio two years ago.â Barbra elaborated on the genesis of her foray into classical acting: âTwo years ago, I said to my agent that I wanted to play Romeo and Juliet, would she call up the networks and see if they were interested in a special? They werenât! They said, âDoes she sing in it? Whoâs playing Romeo?â How big a star do you have to be before you can play Romeo and Juliet on TV? I was so discouraged.\n\nâI was talking to the Shakespeare Company in Connecticut for years and the one in England, but I always chickened out. Maybe because I had such a terrible experience on the stage in Funny Girl.”\n\nThere was a scheduling snafu with The Tonight Show in 1975. As the story goes, Ray Stark and Jon Peters arranged for Streisand to appear on The Tonight Show to promote Funny Lady, which opened in theaters March 1975. Barbra was scheduled to appear July 9 and details were arranged with The Tonight Showâs producers, which included approval of the lighting and orchestra (Streisand would sing two songs). Unfortunately, Barbraâs management cancelled her appearance a day before the show. Several biographies claim Carson was mad and got his revenge on Streisand by pulling the wig off an impersonator the next night. Johnny Carson himself told Rolling Stone magazine the whole story in 1988:\n\n“I remember once Streisand, she was booked on the show and we had a call that afternoon saying she wasnât going to come; I donât know why. But we billboarded her for two days. I went out and said that Barbra Streisand was supposed to be here, she hasnât been here for twelve years, but I think it will probably be another twelve years before she is asked back. It was just a little joke, nothing vicious. [Smirking] So the next night, I get Madlyn Rhue, and we dressed her up in a Streisand get-up and she started to do âPeopleâ. For a moment you couldnât tell if it was Streisand or not because she was lip-synching. I walked over, and said, âThank you, but we donât need you.â And she walked back to the curtain and it was wonderful. I was just taking advantage of what was going on. And of course the papers picked that up and they made a big thing about Streisand and I having a quarrel.”\n\nBarbra did write kind comments about Carson in her liner notes to 1991âs Just For The Record CD set: âI remember Johnny inviting me back several times and that was nice.â\n\nStreisand weathered horrible critical backlash directed at her and Jon Peters while she made A Star is Born. Her hard work, however, was rewarded when her film was a huge hit and her fans embraced her more than ever. A Star is Born received Grammys, Golden Globes and People's Choice awards.\n\nFrank Pierson's article in New West magazine (“My Battles with Barbra and Jon”) prompted Streisand to agree to an in-depth interview with Playboy magazine in Fall 1977.\n\nLawrence Grobel interviewed Barbra Streisand for Playboy. The process of getting an appointment to see Streisand was arduous, as Grobel tells the story â¦\n\nâI wrote her publicist a letter saying, âLook, if Barbra will talk to me, Newsday reaches 350 papers around the country, and Playboy reaches 7 millionâ [â¦] I didnât hear back for half a year [...] Frank Pierson, who wrote the script for A Star Is Born, wrote an article in New West magazine, âMy Battles with Barbra and Jon.â In that article, [Pierson] told what a pain-in-the-ass of an experience it was to make this movie with her. He also mentioned Jason, her son, and that just blew her top, she was just angry with all the things he said about her. Her reaction was she was going to talk, and I became the vehicle for her [â¦]\n\nâ[â¦] So I said to her, âAre going to do this or not?â She says, âCall Lee Solters (Streisandâs publicist) and weâll make arrangements.â It was my moment of decision. I said, âI donât want to call Lee Solters, Iâve been calling him for months. You want to do this, give me your number and Iâll call you directly. So she went over to a yellow pad, and in the corner of the pad, in a one-inch strip, she cuts off this piece of paper, writes the letter B, and a phone number. I mean, it was the size of a thumbnail. Later on, as I got to know her — we spent nine months together — I learned that Barbra believes that everything she touches would be auctioned or sold. She didnât want to do anything that could get sold. So I got it. It was her number, and I was to call and we would set up a time.\n\n“We started talking, doing the interview, and we spent nine months together, off and on. The agreement I made with Barbra was, âEvery time I meet you I have to regain your trust. I will not give the interview to Playboy until weâre done.â Barbra was the exception here, because most other stars wouldâve been done with it in an hour to get it over with. It ended up, I had 52 hours of tape with her. And she became the first celebrity that was on the cover of Playboy. She was on the cover with a Superman T-shirt. So there you have it.â\n\nStreisand finished up the decade with a comedy film, The Main Event.\n\nHaving ascended to the heights of popularity in the 1970s, Streisand was able to record anything she wanted (classical songs, pop songs, standards...) and also able to broker multi-million dollar films starring herself as the main attraction. Still, she searched for more. Wanting to stretch herself as an artist, Barbra sought more control over her films. In the 1980s, Barbra took a giant step (and risk) toward being a film auteur.\n\nWhatâs wrong with wanting more?"
