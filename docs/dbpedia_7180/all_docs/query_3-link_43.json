This includes protecting our patients from communicable diseases, such as influenza (flu) and COVID-19. For this reason, we require that all new employees receive a flu vaccine based on the seasonal availability of flu vaccine (typically during September through April each year) as a condition of employment, and annually thereafter as a condition of continued employment, subject to medical exemption or religious accommodation. For the same reason, you may also be required to receive other vaccines such as COVID-19 as a condition of employment. Cedars-Sinai reserves the right to make modifications to its required list of vaccines as required by law and/or policy. Cedars - Sinai's EEO and AA Policy Statement\n\n\"Working as a Clinical Research Associate at Cedars Sinai has given me the opportunity to work with brilliant colleagues, learn so much about neurology and clinical research, and meet so many of our amazing patients from the greater Los Angeles area. My research team welcomed me so warmly and has taught me so much in a short span of time. I am proud of the work we do every day to fight neurological disease and am even more excited for what is to come.\"\n\n– Mary Clare Kelly - Clinical Research Associate\n\n\"Joining Cedars-Sinai as a Postdoctoral Researcher has been a great experience. Everyone is so friendly, and the research is high quality. My hiring process was easy and smooth. Overall, I would recommend to anyone to join us.\"\n\n– Nuria Sola Tapias - Postdoctoral Scientist\n\n\"As a Clinical Research Coordinator III, working within the Pulmonary department, Cedars-Sinai gave me the opportunity to contribute to breakthrough discoveries of various COVID-19 treatments that are either FDA approved, or given as emergency use authorization to patients within the United States. Along with being recognized as one of the best hospitals in the nation, Cedars-Sinai is an excellent place to work.\"\n\n– Emad Bayoumi - Clinical Research Coordinator III\n\n\"Researchers in all disciplines have clinical partners that enable ready translation of exciting work in the laboratory for patient care with new therapies.\"\n\n– Neil Bhowmick - Research Scientist III\n\n\"I work as a Postdoctorate Fellow in the Pierson Lab at CSMCs Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute. It has been wonderful working in such a collaborative and supportive environment. I am currently developing neurodegerative and neurodevelopment disease models using human Induced Pluiropotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs) derived from affected patients. By doing so, we hope to understand the underlying mechanisms of these diseases with the long-term goal of using this information to develop more effective and targeted novel therapeutics.\"\n\n– Phillip Kenny-Postdoctoral Scientist"
