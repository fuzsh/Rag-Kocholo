        "text": "Barbra Streisand was fourteen years old when she saw her first Broadway play — The Diary of Anne Frank at the Cort Theatre in 1956. Streisand recalled how she felt: “I remember thinking that I could go up on the stage and play any role without any trouble at all,” she said.\n\nA year later, at fifteen, Streisand met Anita and Alan Miller: “the two people who changed my life,” Barbra stated. “I had a job at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village moving sets and painting scenery. Anita was featured in the play; her husband, Alan, was an acting teacher.”\n\n“Barbra was so busy and deep in her plans and dreams for the future, she almost stopped communicating,” her mother, Diana Kind said. “But she kept her promise to stay in school. I was proud when she graduated with a 93 average, after spending her evenings with props, moving scenery and dusting the seats at the theater. I knew now that Barbra would do what she must do—she wasn’t going to let anything stop her.”\n\n“Purple Dust”\n\nby Sean O'Casey\n\nDecember 27, 1956—December 1957\n\nCherry Lane Theatre\n\n38 Commerce St, New York, NY\n\nProduced by: Paul Shyre and Noel Behn\n\nStarring: Kathleen Murray, Peter Falk & Alvin Epstein\n\n(Barbra Streisand: Understudy and Assistant Stage Manager)\n\nIt must have been an exciting time for young Barbra Streisand. Her first job at a Manhattan theater was working at Cherry Lane on their big hit, “Purple Dust, a “comic pastoral” play by Irish dramatist Sean O’Casey. “Purple Dust” ran for 430 performances, longer than any Sean O’Casey play had ever run anywhere, and was written about in all the New York newspapers.\n\nAlan Miller recalled his wife talking to him about Barbra. “Every once in a while, she used to say: ‘You know, there is this young girl backstage, an apprentice. Would you talk to her? She’s really…. Something about her’.”\n\nAnita ended up inviting young Streisand to dinner with the Millers. Alan described fifteen-year-old Streisand as: “Awkward, skinny, dressed like from thrift shop make-up, with long fingernails and this … heat of curiosity just emanated from her.”\n\nOn Streisand’s resume from this time, she listed herself as “Assistant Stage Manager” and understudy for the role of “Avril” on “Purple Dust.”\n\nMalden Bridge Playhouse\n\nRoute 66 between Chatham & Pittsfield-Albany Road (Route 20)\n\nMalden Bridge, New York\n\n“When Barbra was 15,” Diana Kind related in a 1965 interview about her daughter, “she came home one day and said that for her summer vacation she wanted to go to a camp that had a little theater. She had already applied and given her age as 17 so she could work in the theater. I had a lot of misgivings about letting her go away at such a young age, but she persuaded one of her friends, who also had aspirations to act, to go with her. So, I let her go to the Malden Bridge Playhouse in the Adirondacks, after she promised faithfully, she would be sure to eat well.”\n\nIn 1957, Malden Bridge Playhouse was a 200-seat professional summer stock theatre – a place where actors could intern and where several plays were presented in repertory. Malden Bridge audiences attended the plays in an old theatre/barn. The actors who performed in the shows occupied a lodge across the street from the theatre, which also served as a rehearsal hall and costume shop.\n\n“I went to a playhouse upstate with one hundred and fifty dollars my mother gave me. Later I found it was really money my grandfather had left me,” Streisand recalled. “I had a wonderful time at the playhouse,” she said.\n\nBarbra roomed that summer with Ingrid Meighan who remembered Streisand as having “…a wonderful sense of humor and was more of a comic than a serious actor.”\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Kind called her daughter long-distance regularly to check in on her. When Barbra told her about a good review in the local paper, Mrs. Kind replied, “That’s nice. Are you eating?” To which Barbra replied, casually, “Sure.”\n\nOpened August 30, 1957\n\nA drama by William Inge\n\nDirected by Stanley Beck\n\nBarbra played “Millie Owens”\n\nPicnic is Inge’s classic play (and 1955 movie) about a single mother in Kansas with a beautiful older daughter and an intellectual, 16-year-old, tomboy daughter named Millie. It’s a bittersweet melodrama that involves a sexy outsider, Hal, who arrives in the sleepy town and stirs things up.\n\nThe local newspaper, The Berkshire Eagle, noted that this “apprentice play” was performed six times at 8:45 p.m., with three matinee performances August 30-September 1.\n\nKnowing that Streisand went on to capitalize on the “ugly duckling” theme in the movies, it’s interesting that young Streisand was cast as the outsider, Millie, in Picnic. “You’re just saying I’m pretty because you’re my mom,” Millie says in the play. “People we love are always pretty, but people who’re pretty to begin with, everybody loves them.”\n\nClinton Playhouse\n\nRoute 1, Clinton, Connecticut\n\nAugust 1958\n\nStreisand’s resumé lists the character “Ellie May” in Tobacco Road at the Clinton Playhouse. However, the real story is that Streisand accompanied the Millers to Connecticut to babysit (part of her acting scholarship). “Ellie May” was played by Vicky Acosta, according to one Hartford Courant review (Streisand was not the first young actor who exaggerated her resumé).\n\nIt’s serendipitous that some thirty years later, Barbra Streisand began decades of work on a movie about Life magazine photographer Margaret Bourke-White and her lover, the playwright Erskine Caldwell …. who wrote Tobacco Road!\n\nMore notably, Clinton, Connecticut was where young Barbra met young Warren Beatty. “I was babysitting for my acting teacher, and it was Warren’s first summer of stock,” Streisand remembered years later. Warren played opposite the Millers (“Anita Cooper” was Mrs. Miller’s stage name at the time) in A Hatful of Rain. “Can you imagine, he asked if I would cue him! That’s the closest I ever got to a casting couch, not that I could get a part! I saw him a month ago. We’re always, ‘I can’t get over it. Here we are. We were both nobodies!’”"
