        "text": "Synopsis\n\nBarbra Streisand's newly released autobiography, \"My Name Is Barbra,\" chronicles her life from early struggles to superstardom. The book reveals her determination to overcome criticism about her appearance, her ascent to fame, and personal anecdotes like cloning her dog. Streisand's love for food and her journey from a challenging childhood in Brooklyn to the pinnacle of success are also detailed. At 81, she considers this memoir a final chapter in her career and looks forward to enjoying more time with family.\n\nBarbra Streisand, the legendary singer and actress, has unveiled her long-anticipated autobiography, \"My Name Is Barbra.\" After nearly a quarter-century in the making, this deeply personal account offers readers a unique insight into her remarkable journey from a determined young dreamer to a celebrated superstar.\n\nAs she recounts her road to fame, she shares how it was not without its difficult times. During the early stages of her career, she was over scrutinized for her looks, with several being particularly critiquing her nose, bosom, and her hips. Nevertheless, Streisand's incredible talent and magnetic charisma transcended these superficial judgments, propelling her into the spotlight. Her remarkable achievements include the sale of 250 million records and a collection of prestigious awards, such as 10 Golden Globes, five Emmys, and two Oscars.\n\nDespite the subsequent acclaim, the initial criticism left lasting scars on Streisand. In her memoir, she opens up about the enduring pain of those insults and the challenge of reconciling them with the praise she later received. For Streisand, writing this book represents a means of regaining control over her own narrative and leaving behind a lasting legacy.\n\nStreisand, a rare recipient of the EGOT distinction, signifying wins in the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony categories, recently granted an exclusive interview to the BBC.\n\nStreisand recounts behind-the-scenes disputes, bewilderment-inducing admirers, and even an episode involving her falling off a London bus. The memoir delves into her unique experiences, such as her decision to clone her beloved dog, or her habit of using the alias \"Angelina Scarangella\" when checking into hotels.\n\nShe also disclosed that she was the inspiration for Aerosmith's hit song, \"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing\", as she candidly spoke about her marriage to actor James Brolin. Another thing that comes through from her memoir, is her passion for food, as she details the delectable meals she has enjoyed over the years, including molten chocolate cake, New York pizza slices, and her favorite Brazilian coffee ice cream.\n\nStreisand's childhood in Brooklyn is etched in her memory, with her earliest recollections involving singing in the stairwells of her apartment building. Raised in challenging circumstances following her father's untimely death, Streisand found solace in a hot water bottle that she treated as a makeshift doll.\n\nHer journey toward stardom was further complicated by a strained family life. Her stepfather, a used car salesman, remained emotionally distant, and her mother failed to recognize her ambition to become an actress. According to her friend and lyricist Marilyn Bergman, Streisand's early experiences fueled her desire for unconditional love, which ultimately led her to pursue fame.\n\nSetting out on her own at 16, Streisand held a job as a clerk while working weekend shifts as a theater usher, all the while concealing her face to avoid recognition by the very people she had escorted to their seats. Her trajectory to stardom began at a talent competition in a Manhattan gay bar, where she mesmerized the audience and started to catch the eye of celebrities, record labels, and theater professionals.\n\nHer ascent continued with her role in \"Funny Girl,\" a performance that earned her rave reviews and eight Tony Award nominations. However, her co-star, Sydney Chaplin, created a challenging environment for her on set, contributing to her stage fright and her decision to abstain from live performances for 27 years.\n\nThroughout her career, Streisand faced both supportive and challenging male collaborators. Despite the obstacles, she achieved resounding success in both film and music, securing her position as the second best-selling female artist of all time. She even ventured into directing with her debut film, \"Yentl,\" a groundbreaking work that addressed gender equality.\n\nIn \"My Name Is Barbra,\" readers are granted access to the intimate details of Streisand's life, from her early struggles to her meteoric rise to stardom. Now at the age of 81, Streisand considers this autobiography as the final chapter of her illustrious career, envisioning more time spent at home with family.\n\nAs Barbra Streisand takes her final bow in the spotlight, her memoir stands as a testament to her enduring legacy and the resilience that defined her journey in the world of entertainment.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
