The first major female star to command roles as a Jewish actress, Streisand redefined female stardom in the 1960s and ’70s with her sensitive portrayal of ethnic urban characters. Her immense popularity matched only by her outspokenness, she became one of the most powerful women in show business, noted for her liberal politics and her philanthropy.\n\nEarly life\n\nInitially aspiring to be a dramatic actress, Streisand joined a summer theatre group in Malden Bridge, New York, and began studying acting while still in high school. After graduation she moved to Manhattan, where her first break came in 1960 when she sang at a small local nightclub and won an amateur talent contest (and dropped the second a from her first name). Following singing engagements in Greenwich Village cabarets, she landed a small comic role as Miss Marmelstein in the Broadway musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale (1962) and stole the show. An immediate sensation, she made frequent television appearances, notably on The Judy Garland Show, and, beginning in 1963, released a series of best-selling record albums that featured vibrant and original interpretations of popular songs. Her first solo album, The Barbra Streisand Album, won Grammy Awards for album of the year and best female vocal performance—the first two of many.\n\nStar of stage and screen\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nStreisand established herself as a major Broadway star in the career-making role of Fanny Brice in the musical Funny Girl (1964). In 1965 she won two Emmy Awards for My Name Is Barbra, the first of a series of tremendously successful television specials. She made her movie debut in 1968 in an Academy Award-winning reprise of her role as Fanny Brice. Although Funny Girl portrays Brice’s life, not Streisand’s, it established many enduring elements of Streisand’s screen image, including her transition from an awkward ugly duckling to a stylish, sophisticated star, her Jewish origins, and her persistence and determination. Her self-deprecating opening line (“Hello, gorgeous,” said into a mirror) and her first solo number (“I’m the Greatest Star”) underscored the fact that Streisand had succeeded despite widespread early opinion that her unconventional looks would keep her from becoming a major movie star.\n\nStreisand starred in several film musicals in the 1960s and ’70s, including Funny Lady (1975), the sequel to Funny Girl, as well as Hello, Dolly! (1969), On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (1970), and A Star Is Born (1976). She played screwball heroines in such comedies as The Owl and the Pussycat (1970) and What’s Up, Doc? (1972) and the romantic lead in the enormously popular The Way We Were (1973). She made her directorial debut in 1983 with Yentl, based on a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer about a young woman who pretends to be a man in order to continue her studies. Streisand starred in the title role—which she had wanted to play since 1968—as well as cowriting and coproducing the movie. She concentrated on straight dramatic roles in Nuts (1987), The Prince of Tides (1991), and The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996); the last two she also directed. However, she subsequently appeared in the broad comedies Meet the Fockers (2004), Little Fockers (2010), and The Guilt Trip (2012). Despite the seeming variety, most of Streisand’s characters share the qualities of strength and fierce independence combined with vulnerability.\n\nRecording artist\n\nAlthough admired as a filmmaker, Streisand inspired perhaps even greater devotion from her fans as a singer. In addition to the albums featuring the soundtracks from her films and television specials, her most popular recordings included The Barbra Streisand Album (1963), The Second Barbra Streisand Album (1963), The Third Album (1964), People (1964), Je m’appelle Barbra (1966), Stoney End (1971), Streisand Superman (1977), Guilty (1980), The Broadway Album (1985), Higher Ground (1997), and Love Is the Answer (2009). She avoided performing live for several years, but in the 1990s she appeared in a series of live concerts that broke box office sales records. Streisand remained in the public eye well into the 21st century, continuing to perform in concert and releasing albums, among them the duets albums Partners (2014) and Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway (2016). In Walls (2018) she sang about various topical issues and was critical of U.S. Pres. Donald Trump.\n\nFame and the “Streisand effect”\n\nHer fame, however, has caused problems for her. It even spawned a phenomenon called the “Streisand effect,” in which an attempt to censor, hide, or otherwise draw attention away from something only serves to attract more attention to it. The name derives from Streisand’s 2003 lawsuit against a photographer whose 12,000 snapshots of the California coast from a helicopter, later published on the Internet, had also captured Streisand’s sprawling residential mansion. Streisand, who had in the past been harassed and stalked by fans, sued for $50 million, claiming the photo violated her privacy and threatened her security. At the time the lawsuit was filed, the photograph had been downloaded only six times. Within a month of the filing and news of the lawsuit, the photo had been viewed more than 400,000 times and reposted on news sites and elsewhere on the Internet. Streisand lost the case and was ordered to pay the photographer’s legal fees.\n\nAwards and memoir\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Her numerous other accolades include an award from the Recording Academy for lifetime achievement (1995), an American Film Institute Life Achievement Award (2001), and a medal from the French Legion of Honour (2007). Streisand accepted a Kennedy Center Honor in 2008, and Pres. Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015, describing her as “one of our Nation’s most gifted talents.” She published her memoir, My Name Is Barbra, in 2023.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia BritannicaThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
