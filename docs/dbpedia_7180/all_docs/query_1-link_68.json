        "text": "_\n\nBarbra Streisand is a forever style icon. To celebrate her receiving a Life Achievement Award at the 30th Screen Actors Guild Awards on Feb. 24, 2024, we've culled some of the singer-actress-director's best retro style moments from early in her career, starting with this look…\n\nBarbra Streisand is notorious for loving fur: Here she is in December 1969 in a head-to-toe white mink look, hand muff included!\n\nKeep reading for more of Barbra's wildest retro fashion moments from early in her career…\n\nMORE: Follow Wonderwall on MSN for more celebrity & entertainment photo galleries and content\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand won her first Oscar, for her performance in \"Funny Girl,\" in 1969. She wore a sheer tuxedo pantsuit by designer Arnold Scaasi that will go down in history as one of the quirkiest Oscar looks ever.\n\nFun fact: Apparently, she didn't realize the look would be sheer when the klieg lights hit!\n\nMORE: Celine Dion's most over-the-top fashion moments\n\n_\n\nThat is one large hat! We love the way it looked on Babs paired with a matching scarf, perfect black eyeliner and a chartreuse coat — a memorable look circa 1970 ensemble indeed!\n\nMORE: Follow Wonderwall on MSN for more celebrity & entertainment photo galleries and content\n\n_\n\nIn 1965, Barbra Streisand looked supreme in a pop of fuchsia — a satin dress with a scoop neckline and a matching bow at the waist — plus a matching hat.\n\n_\n\nThe little black dress has long been an iconic garment in fashion. Barbra Streisand opted for a slinky floor-length version while taping her first television special, \"My Name is Barbra,\" in April 1965.\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand delivered another standout fashion moment when she attended the Academy Awards in April 1970. That evening, she wore a delightful pink Scaasi gown and matching pillbox hat as she posed alongside best actor winner John Wayne.\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson were the OG Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in the 1976 version of \"A Star is Born.\" Babs is seen here in a promotional poster for the film wearing a sexy, glittery gown. Accessorized with a pair of platforms, this look is '70s glam incarnate.\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand is zoning out on set in zigzags! This ensemble that she wore while filming \"On A Clear Day You Can See Forever\" in 1969 looks straight off a Missoni runway, and we adore it!\n\n_\n\nAn aspect of Barbra Streisand's style we've always loved? Just how fearless she is when it comes to playing with color. When Barbra attended a Los Angeles pro-Israel rally in June 1967, she commanded attention in a brilliant striped coat and dress with a matching headpiece.\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand stunned in an updo and a beautifully beaded gown with a square neckline at a press event for \"Funny Girl\" back in 1968.\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand and Sammy Davis Jr. presented the award for best song at the 1968 Oscars in Santa Monica, California. She looked ravishing in a sparkling deep-V gown — and that choker with a long, dainty diamond chain was the perfect accessorization.\n\n_\n\nIn a more casual moment in 1965, Barbra Streisand donned a red-and-white wool dress and a navy cardigan.\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand rocked a colorful paisley-print dress with a matching pillbox hat when she attended Bedford Stuyvesant's Restore Ball in New York City in September 1970 alongside businessman and attorney William vanden Heuvel.\n\n_\n\nWith her pet poodle, Sadie, by her side, Barbra Streisand arrived in Rhode Island for a one-night appearance at a 1966 musical festival. The best part? She's pregnant with son Jason Gould here — and hiding her baby bump in this gingham tent dress (with a matching hat)!\n\n_\n\nOn set for \"Hello Dolly\" in 1969, Barbra Streisand was matchy-matchy in a whole lot of navy paired with a pink plaid peacoat.\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand was the epitome of sophistication when she wore this three-piece suit with a tie in 1965.\n\n_\n\nMeow! To mark the first anniversary of her hit Broadway musical \"Funny Girl,\" Barbra Streisand posed with a cake while wearing a leopard-print coat and matching bowler hat.\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand looked incredibly chic (and tan!) when she attended a Valentino fashion show in New York City in September 1970 in this beautifully tailored all-black ensemble and minimal accessories.\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand wore a giant bow and her signature fur-hat combo while out with then-husband Elliott Gould in March 1966. We love how the actor is holding an extra fur for her — just in case!\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand in a floppy hat? Yes, please! In January 1969, the singer-actress stepped out in London in the headwear, a collared white dress, a black vest, layered necklaces and tall black boots.\n\n_\n\nOn the set of the movie \"Funny Girl\" in 1968, Barbra Streisand looked like the poster girl for swinging '60s style.\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand rocked black cat-eyes liner and a patterned halter dress as she cut a cake at a farewell party — she was leaving to give birth to her only child — that was thrown for her by the cast of \"Funny Girl\" in London in 1966.\n\n_\n\nLooking oh-so glamorous in a mink coat and matching suede boots and oversized cap, Barbra Streisand exited her car in London in 1966. Chic and warm for the win!\n\n_\n\nAt the premiere of \"Yentl\" in 1984, Barbra Streisand attended in an all-white look. She never misses an opportunity for interesting headpieces, that's for sure!\n\n_\n\nThat casual glass of wine in her hand! In June 1966, Barbra Streisand attended an art exhibit opening at the Grosvenor Gallery in London with first husband Elliott Gould while wearing an elegant black dress, a matching black hat and a pinstriped jacket accessorized with layers of delicate pearls.\n\n_\n\nDuring a party for feminist Bella Abzug that Barbra Streisand threw at her townhouse in New York City in 1970, the singer-actress wore a polka-dot dress with a matching head scarf.\n\n_\n\nDuring the runup to the 1968 presidential election, Barbra Streisand sang to fundraise for Democratic candidate Eugene McCarthy's campaign in New York City, choosing a more demure pink printed skirt suit with matching topper and pearls for her performance.\n\n_\n\nThe original airport-style shot! Here's our girl Barbra Streisand in 1969, swathed in some serious fox fur at Heathrow Airport in London.\n\n_\n\nIf there was ever a picture that screamed \"movie star,\" it would be this snapshot of Barbra Streisand in 1969. We're sure she caused quite the scene with all the flashbulbs popping!\n\n_\n\nAt the 1977 Golden Globe Awards, Barbra Streisand won for best actress and for best original song for \"A Star is Born.\" She naturally wore a giant fur — over a pink dress — for the occasion.\n\n_\n\nWearing thigh-high boots and oodles of fur, Barbra Streisand won second place in the \"Imaginative\" category on a best dressed list in 1969.\n\n_\n\nOn the set of \"Funny Girl\" in 1964, Barbra was wrapped in blue. This may be a costume, but it doesn't look too far from one of her wild and wacky IRL looks during the era!\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand is a self-proclaimed hat lover, and her greatest fashion moments from the '60s and '70s make that clear. She's seen here in 1969's \"Hello, Dolly!\" wearing a fabulously embellished getup with the statement hat of all statement hats. Just look at those feathers!\n\n_\n\nFor her March 1966 CBS special \"Color Me Barbra,\" Barbra Streisand was armed with her pet poodle, Sadie, and as usual, she brought on the sparkle in the form of a metallic bodysuit. This was one of the first specials filmed in color, hence the title.\n\n_\n\nBarbra Streisand was stunning in a mauve angel-winged shawl and gauzy gown as she greeted fans from the red carpet at the Oscar in 1992."
