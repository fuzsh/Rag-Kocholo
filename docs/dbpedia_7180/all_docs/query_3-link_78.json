        "text": "Columbia Records is releasing The Essential Barbra Streisand, the definitive career-spanning overview of the artist's 40 years on the label. The Essential Barbra Streisand brings together for the first time all of Streisand's groundbreaking pop hits, classic recordings, and fan favorites on one breathtaking two disk, 40 song collection. Beginning with 1963's \"A Sleepin' Bee\" and culminating with a stunning new studio performance of \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" (the song she performed at the 2001 Emmy Awards ceremony), The Essential Barbra Streisand is an indispensable gallery of career highlight performances -- from one of the most successful and enduring artists in recorded music history. Featuring including two performances -- \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" and \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\" -- previously unavailable on CD, The Essential Barbra Streisand is in stores Tuesday, January 29th.\n\nHaving earned Oscar, Tony, Emmy, Grammy, Golden Globe, Cable Ace and Peabody Awards (among numerous others), Barbra Streisand is truly a Renaissance woman with her extraordinary popularity now entering its fifth decade. She is the highest-selling female recording artist ever, the only artist to have had a #1 album in each of the past four decades. Consistently releasing #1 albums over a period of nearly 40 years, she has achieved the greatest longevity of success of any recording artist or group. With 45 gold albums, 29 platinum album and 13 multi-platinum albums to her credit, Barbra Streisand has set a series of unprecedented sales records. Her unbroken string of successes began when her debut album, The Barbra Streisand Album, became the nation's top-selling record by a female vocalist in 1963 and has continued unabated through the release of Christmas Memories, which was certified gold and platinum by the RIAA shortly after its release in late 2001.\n\nA recent national poll by the Reuters News Agency named Barbra Streisand and Frank Sinatra as the favorite female and male singers of the century while the RIAA confirmed her status as the leading female recording artist of the 20th century.\n\nThe Essential Barbra Streisand (DISC #1) 1.
