        "text": "01 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand's Childhood\n\nA star was born Barbara Joan Streisand (she'd later change the spelling) on April 24, 1942, to parents Diana and Emanuel Streisand in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nTragedy struck when Emanuel died of a cerebral hemorrhage when Barbra was just 15 months old; Diana moved Barbra and her brother Sheldon in with her parents to help raise her kids while she worked as a bookkeeper.\n\n02 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand's Adolescence\n\nThe star did not have a particularly happy childhood, saying in one interview that she was somewhat of an unsupervised \"wild child\" and was often picked on by her classmates and stepfather for being plain.\n\nBut joining the Erasmus High School choral society gave her an opportunity to exercise her talent, and right after high school she headed to Manhattan, determined to make it on Broadway.\n\n03 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand's Early Career\n\nAfter gaining some early success as a singer in New York City nightclubs, she broke through with her first role in I Can Get it For You Wholesale in 1962. She got attention for the role that landed her appearances on evening talk shows and her debut album, The Barbra Streisand Album, which won three Grammys.\n\n04 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand's Duet with Judy Garland\n\nThe actress was a popular guest almost immediately, logging legendary appearances including this \"Get Happy/Happy Days\" duet with Judy Garland from the latter's self-titled show in 1963.\n\n\"Such a special moment in my career,\" Streisand recalled on Instagram. \"She was incredible. Totally unique. Just been reminded this aired 56 years ago today on CBS. I was 21, and Judy was 41.\"\n\n05 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand's Marriage to Elliott Gould\n\nStreisand and Elliott Gould met on the set of I Can Get it for You Wholesale and married in Carson City, Nevada, in 1963. The two welcomed a son, Jason, in 1966, but by 1969 they had separated, divorcing in 1971.\n\nLater, Gould reflected that his wife's skyrocketing success made it difficult for the two of them to grow together; Streisand agreed in a 1970 interview with Time.\n\n\"It must have been very difficult for him,\" she said. \"Marriages between people who are self-involved is hard. It's safer for actors not to be married to one another.\"\n\n06 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand in 'Funny Girl'\n\nThough her star turn as Fanny Brice in Funny Girl is indelibly associated with her, she almost got fired from the 1964 Broadway production in its early days. She persisted and the show opened to rave reviews; it led to her signing a three-film deal for movies based on Funny Girl, Hello, Dolly! and On a Clear Day You Can See Forever.\n\n07 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand Meets John F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\n\"I never ask for autographs. .. but I made an exception when I met President John F. Kennedy in 1963,\" Streisand wrote in a throwback Instagram post.\n\n08 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand Films 'Funny Girl'\n\nFunny Girl was Streisand's first Hollywood film and it was a smash hit, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1968 with eight Oscar nominations to its name (including a Best Actress win for Streisand, seen here with her onscreen love interest Omar Sharif).\n\n09 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand Wins an Oscar\n\nThe star won her first Academy Award wearing a polarizing sheer sequin pantsuit by Arnold Scaasi that has since become iconic.\n\n\"I had no idea that when the lights hit that outfit, it would become transparent!\" she told W Magazine. \"I wanted a white collar and cuffs, which it had, and I wore my hair under my chin, because I thought to myself, I'm going to win two Oscars in my lifetime, and I'll be more conservative next time.\"\n\nShe would be nominated for four more Oscars and would win one more, for Best Song for \"Evergreen.\" She has amassed countless other awards, making her one of the few stars to earn an EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony).\n\n10 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand as a Mother\n\nThe star reveled in her role as a parent to son Jason, often bringing him to work (he's pictured here with her on the set of Hello, Dolly!). \"It's a miracle, the height of creativity for any woman,\" Streisand told Ladies' Home Journal of motherhood. She often posts loving tributes to her son on Instagram.\n\n11 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand's Relationship with Jon Peters\n\nAfter her divorce from Gould, Streisand began dating producer Jon Peters, and they were together for nearly a decade. After their split, she dated other high-profile men (including Clint Eastwood, Andre Agassi and Don Johnson) throughout the '80s and early '90s.\n\n12 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand in 'The Way We Were'\n\nPeople swooned for the onscreen romance between Streisand and costar Robert Redford in the 1973 hit, The Way We Were.\n\n13 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand in 'A Star Is Born'\n\nStreisand had another massive success with her 1976 turn in A Star Is Born opposite Kris Kristofferson (pictured). She composed the love theme to the film, \"Evergreen,\" which won her an Oscar and hit No.1 on the charts.\n\n14 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand in Concert\n\nIn addition to her successful work as an actress, Streisand had incredible success with her recording and performing careers — so it was no surprise that people turned out by the thousands to watch her perform in concert in what ended up being used as a crowd scene for A Star Is Born.\n\n15 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand Directs 'Yentl'\n\nIn 1983, the star (pictured with the film's stars Mandy Patinkin and Amy Irving) became the first woman to write, produce, direct, and star in a major studio film, Yentl. She also became the first woman to win a Golden Globe for directing — and the only one for more than 30 years after that.\n\n16 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand Wins a Grammy\n\nNominated for 43 Grammys and having won eight (she's seen here accepting Best Female Vocal Pop Performance for 1986's The Broadway Album), the star has also taken home honors including the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n17 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand Marries James Brolin\n\nAfter being set up at a dinner party in 1996, the singer and actor James Brolin hit it off and wed two years later. Streisand serenaded her groom with two new love songs, and he returned the favor with a sweet toast: \"I can't tell you how lucky I am that this would happen to me so late in life. Every night is a new adventure. Sleeping is a waste of time. I can't wait to see her again in the morning.\"\n\n18 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand Wins a Kennedy Center Honor\n\nIn 2008, Streisand (alongside Morgan Freeman, country singer George Jones, dancer and choreographer Twyla Tharp and musicians Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey of The Who) received a Kennedy Center award from then-President George W. Bush for her contributions to the performing arts.\n\n19 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand's Family\n\nIn addition to her son Jason (far right), Barbra is a stepmother to Brolin's three children Josh (second from right), Molly and Jess, and a grandmother to Josh's four children (including Trevor, center). The family is pictured here at a 2006 concert.\n\n20 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand's Dogs\n\nThe star is also an avowed animal lover who was so devoted to her Coton du Tulear dog Samantha that she had Samantha cloned after her death in 2017. In 2018 she shared a photo of her three dogs, Fanny and the clones Violet and Scarlet, visiting Samantha's grave.\n\nShe more recently shared a playful photo with the pups and their many stuffed lookalikes inside her home.\n\n21 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand's Philanthropy\n\nThe star is an outspoken political activist and a passionate advocate for many causes, including women's heart health. She started the Women's Heart Alliance in 2004 and now has her name on the heart research center at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.\n\n22 of 22\n\nBarbra Streisand as a Grandmother\n\nThe star, who says she's happiest as a homebody, revels in her role as grandparent, especially to stepson Josh Brolin's two youngest children, Westlyn and Chapel.\n\n\"One of Jason's first words was \"hat\" — and now it's one of Westlyn's first words too! 💛\" she wrote on Instagram of this sweet moment."
