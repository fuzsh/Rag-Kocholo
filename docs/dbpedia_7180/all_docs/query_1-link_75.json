        "text": "US singer Barbra Streisand has been honoured for her film career with the 40th annual Chaplin Award from the Film Society of Lincoln Center.\n\nAmong those paying tribute to the actress - who turns 71 tomorrow - were former president Bill Clinton, Liza Minnelli and singer Tony Bennett.\n\nShe is one of just a few to have won all four major US awards - an Oscar, Emmy, Grammy and an honorary Tony.\n\nThe event raised $2m (Â£1.3m) to help the centre promote independent cinema.\n\nAccepting the award, Streisand told the audience: \"Ever since I can remember, people have been calling me bossy and opinionated.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Maybe that's because I am. Three cheers for bossy women.\"\n\nStreisand began her film career with 1968's Funny Girl, for which she won an Oscar. Organisers showed clips from the film and her other movies which include The Way We Were, What's Up, Doc? and the Meet the Parents sequel, Meet the Fockers."
