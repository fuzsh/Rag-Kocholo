        "text": "Barbra Streisand had one of the best opening lines ever for an awards acceptance speech when she won her first Oscar for Funny Girl in April 1969. Gazing at the golden statue, she repeated her memorable line from the musical-turned-film, “Hello, gorgeous.”\n\nToday’s announcement that Streisand will receive the life achievement award at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Feb. 24 is just the latest affirmation of the performer’s talent and success.\n\nStreisand is a GOAT, an icon and a legend. While she isn’t officially an EGOT – she has yet to win a Tony in competition – she has won just about every other award an entertainer can win.\n\nShe was nominated for a Tony for her first Broadway show, I Can Get It for You Wholesale, but lost to Phyllis Newman in Subways Are for Sleeping. Streisand won the other three EGOT awards with her first major projects. She won two Grammys for her first album, an Emmy for her first TV special and an Oscar for her first film.\n\nStreisand, who recently talked to Billboard’s Joe Lynch about her long-awaited memoir My Name Is Barbra, set a high bar for all who followed. Many of today’s top stars seem well aware of that fact. Beyoncé said, “It’s an honor to sing for you, Miss Streisand,” after singing “The Way We Were” when Streisand received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2008. Ariana Grande said “I love you so much, thank you so much,” following a duet performance of “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)” at a Streisand concert in Chicago in 2019. Madonna did a playful “we’re not worthy” gesture of respect when Streisand surprised her, Mike Myers and Roseanne Barr at the end of a Saturday Night Live sketch in 1992.\n\nHere are 22 times Streisand made awards show history."
