Nothing impressive yet but what better way to start...\n\n1962...it is clear that we still have difficulty imagining at this stage the immense star that she will subsequently become. It's even hard to recognize the voice...\n\n1962...you have to start well one day as they say. A quiet start which allows her to discover the profession gently...\n\n1963...here she finally goes solo with a first opus. A first opus which will certainly project her into the spotlight, at least in the United States...\n\n1963...an opus which will not produce a classified title but which will at least have had the merit of making the young singer known. It's already that...\n\n1963...after having first revisited in this opus the title of Julie London dating from 1955, then the title of Dennis King dating from 1938, she now takes up this title performed for the first time in 1929 by Lou Levin...\n\n1963...the rise in power in the United States is confirmed and the young singer is no longer really unknown anymore...\n\n1963...the voice is refined year after year, opus after opus, it is clear. But we don't yet have the exact tone of voice that will make her an exception in this area...\n\n1964...a career such as her cannot be achieved in just a few years. These are necessarily years of maturation to get to where she is going to get...\n\n1964...we're going to give her time, there's no point in rushing any further. Even the most beautiful butterfly was first a caterpillar...\n\n1964...the number of titles produced at the start of her career is impressive to say the least. A more than obvious desire to progress...\n\n1964...her first classified title, this time was the right one. A first success which also gives her global influence...\n\n1965...of course she will not succeed in immediately reissuing the feat achieved on the previous title but that doesn't matter, the dynamic of success is now in place...\n\n1965...everything is now going in an ideal manner and the rise in power is certain title after title, opus after opus, it is clear...\n\n1965...a year 1965 which will remain as the year of real takeoff. She will have a string of successes and prove herself that she is certainly not there by chance...\n\n1965...this first part of the decade saw her blossom and then grow inexorably. And that's just the beginning...\n\n1966...her first global top hit. On a luxury cover of Fanny Brice's title dating from...1921, no less. This time the caterpillar has indeed become a butterfly !\n\n1966...now that everything is perfectly in place, all she has to do is climb the last steps that separate her from the summit of the mountain...\n\n1966...final levels that she will not be able to pass during this decade of the 60s but it doesn't matter, she works on it as much as possible...\n\n1966...the only thing that slows her down at this stage is that she hardly changes register and varies tempos little. It will come, one day...\n\n1966...a second part of the 60s which saw her somewhat stagnate in the Charts, both on the albums side and on the Singles side...\n\n1967...all this does not lack quality, far from it. But his style is too repetitive and people are starting to get tired of it...\n\n1967...there will be no notable developments at least during this decade so we will have to be patient to see her start to take risks...\n\n1967...so what better way to restart the machine than to release the good old Christmas special album. And on this one, she will come out with flying colors...\n\n1967... big success there will be but only in the United States once again. She no longer manages to interest the rest of the planet at first glance...\n\n1968...business picks up a little with this new title. As luck would have it, the tempo is much faster than the usual one...\n\n1969...here she is back in her comfort zone. For the moment she takes out very little and doesn't see the point in taking out more than that in any case...\n\n1969...a decade which ends quietly but without succeeding in passing the last stages on which she stumbles for the moment...\n\n1969...when 2 legends rub shoulders, one at the end of his career and the other who is only just beginning. A unique moment for sure...\n\n1969...in the end a busy decade which allowed her to show a large part of her talent. The best is yet to come anyway...\n\n1970...the first half of the 70s will be a phase of transition which will see her move slowly from her old influences to the new ones...\n\n1970...slow transition, it is clear. No obvious improvement at this stage, so we will have to wait a little longer...\n\n1971...change of decade and gradual change of style, finally. A necessary adaptation which will very quickly bear fruit...\n\n1971 ... a year marked by rhythm and the joy of living. Titles with simple but particularly effective melodies...\n\n1971...we couldn't ask for more ! Barbra is undergoing a complete metamorphosis and things are going in the right direction, that's obvious...\n\n1971 ... a decidedly exceptional year 1971 with an uninterrupted series of high caliber hits. A dynamic that is not about to stop ...\n\n1971...in any case, she returns to softer rhythms but she understands that she has to alternate between the two if she wants to finally reach the top of the mountain...\n\n1971...for now we have gone back a few years but nothing worrying at this stage. Metamorphosis cannot be accomplished with the snap of a finger...\n\n1971...there's been better times, it's undeniable. The style is clearly more suited to the times and will finally allow her to show all of her talent...\n\n1972...the year 1972 will be a notch below the year which preceded it but not by much. Everything is going as it should now...\n\n1972 ... the Carpenters version will remain forever the most famous. But this one is not bad either. The original title, composed by Jo Raposo, is actually a credits for a children's TV show called \"Sesame Street\". Even the Carpenters title is just an adaptation...\n\n1972...we constantly alternate between old and new influences. It's clear that she's going to have to choose for good at some point...\n\n1973...here she is again in her comfort zone. This certainly reassures her but it won't help attract the younger generations, that's for sure...\n\n1973...it could be that this year 1973 is the last before the big shift towards the unknown musically speaking. Unknown but oh so effective...\n\n1974 ... no need to be a diviner to know that the young Barbra is going to go far, very far. She signs here one of the most beautiful Intimist titles of the decade, if not of the end of this XXth century. MAS-TER-FUL !\n\n1974 ... the sumptuous ballads follow one another at an impressive speed. A unique know-how that will always remain the trademark of the singer...\n\n1975 ... we continue with this magnificent Ultimate Slow. A title with extreme inspiration and which vividly demonstrates its total control over this area from now on...\n\n1975...a new opus which won't have much to do with the previous one, that's for sure. A parenthesis to the relative interest...\n\n1975...the middle of the 70s which truly represents the global tipping point with the gradual but irreversible arrival of synthesizers. We are at polar opposites on this opus...\n\n1976...a new opus which will also be the tipping point for the singer. Barbra will never be the same as before...\n\n1976...the singer has finally become aware of what the public expects from now on and she will do everything necessary to satisfy him to the highest degree...\n\n1977 ... her 1st WONDER of WONDERS. A pure moment of hearing happiness ! And especially its first global mega hit. A well-deserved consecration ! SUB-LIME !\n\n1977 ... each new song is a sound event in itself. A totally extraordinary talent and an ability to provoke emotions almost unique in the world...\n\n1978 ... and it continues, and it continues, and it continues ! Mind-blowing lyric titles that follow one another in an incredible way. She literally walks on water ...\n\n1978 ... nothing and no one can stop her. No waste, no failure, it's a veritable war machine of emotion !\n\n1978 ... alone, she already produces exceptional pieces. But as soon as she sings as a duet, the sales scores become completely mind-blowing. MAS-TER-FUL !\n\n1979...in an ocean of mega hits he will still produce 'small' ones. Nothing to worry about at this stage anyway...\n\n1979 ... total metamorphosis, here she is now in Disco mode. And as incredible as it may seem, she excels at it too. Very rare versatility for the time !\n\n1979 ... 2 divas among the most famous of the moment for a duo of charm, and especially of shock. Who says duet with Barbra says huge success. New proof with this title !\n\n1980 ... the 60s saw her born, the 70s saw her explode, the 80s will consecrate her definitively as a living legend. Simply !\n\n1980 ... her 2nd WONDER of WONDERS. And especially the biggest hit of all her discography. We reach heights of success at an intergalactic level. She signs without question one of the biggest Ultimate Slows of all time. A sublimated voice and carried by a tailor-made melody. A title written by...the Gibb brothers, better known as the Bee Gees, by chance. Once again SU-BLI-ME !\n\n1981 ... again made-to-measure made in Bee Gees. When legend meets legend, we reach a level of inspiration almost unmatched in this decade !\n\n1981 ... the 2 gifted put back the cover. Admittedly, it will not necessarily be the most exceptional of all that they will have produced but we will be content with it largely considering the level !\n\n1981 ... once again the Gibb at the controls. A new dance track of very large caliber served on a set by tube makers...\n\n1982 ... year after year, decade after decade, each piece produced is a real delight and none is alike. Unbelievable !\n\n1982 ... and here comes the 3rd WONDER of WONDERS. After one of the greatest Ultimate Slows of all time, here comes one of the greatest songs of all time. A-MA-ZING !\n\n1983 ... a single-title year, extremely rare for her. Anyway, one more moment when time stands still, one more !\n\n1984 ... when Michel Legrand writes tailor-made for Barbra. Only the best can compose for the best. Logical !\n\n1984 ... an obvious change in tone and style. Did Barbra reach a turning point in her career ? The rest will tell us ...\n\n1985 ... new duo of shock and charm. Certainly, this one will not have the success of the previous tandem but duos like those there, we want more !\n\n1985 ... a much more trendy Barbra, much more in tune with the times. Indeed, the change is confirmed !\n\n1985 ... a nice nod to West Side Story. Once again, the legend meets another legend. And at the key, a new extraordinary vocal performance !\n\n1986 ... another year with one title. It is clear that the pace is slowing down. After years and years of bloated production, the star is seriously starting to slow down ...\n\n1987...a title that we will find on the soundtrack of the film 'Nuts'. It's hard to imagine that she's behind this title since it doesn't have any words, but it's definitely her...\n\n1988 ... well, it's been a long time since she sang a duet with a male member. And of course, it is not just anyone, again. After an empty year 1987, it was necessary at least that to restart the machine !\n\n1988 ... new luxury cover on this track by Andrew Lloyd Weber specially created for the musical \"The phantom of the opera\". Hunt the natural, it comes back at a gallop !\n\n1989...her first title of the year 1989 will only experience a limited level of success to say the least despite its more than obvious quality. Strange...\n\n1989 ... the end of a decade like everything that has been done since the beginning. That is to say, always as effective, always as inspired !\n\n1989...it now remains to be seen what the next decade has in store for her : consolidation of its position or slow but irremediable deceleration ? Good question...\n\n1992 ... a decade that will prove to be complicated to manage. After 30 years of career and a plethora of exceptional pieces, it is becoming more and more said to stay in the know and renew yourself. Especially in this decade where everything is going very fast, too fast ...\n\n1992...first title of the decade to go under the radar, which is not necessarily a good sign. And there will be others unfortunately...\n\n1993...the adventure continues whatever happens and it is far, very far from being over. Every career has ups and downs, it's inevitable...\n\n1994...anyway, when we see the album sales figures it is clear that she still has a more than substantial fan base...\n\n1994...there is no need to be afraid of the future, everything is under control at first glance. And we know well that with her everything remains possible...\n\n1994...a mid-decade which saw her struggling somewhat but it could be that the future would be much more favorable to her...\n\n1996 ... what better way to stay afloat than asking a friend for help. Especially when he is one of the most prominent artists of the moment !\n\n1997 ... what better way to stay afloat than asking for help from a friend. Especially when he is one of the most prominent artists of the moment !\n\n1998...after the 2 previous mega hits the relapse will be severe to say the least with this new title. From one extreme to the other...\n\n1998...no better with this one. A year 1998 which will not stay as its best vintage, that's for sure...\n\n1999...she will still have gone through 4 decades, producing pieces in each decade that will remain in the legend. Few singers in the 20th century can say the same. A career that is literally exceptional and almost unique in its kind !\n\n1999...duets have been working particularly well for her for some time. They are even the ones who allowed her to save the furniture at the last minute throughout this complicated decade...\n\n2001...here she is, starting a new decade with the firm intention of not giving up as usual. All in Christmas album mode once again...\n\n2001...there is quality in all that but it won't touch the public that much. Times are getting harder and harder, it is clear...\n\n2003...this new opus will already have a slightly more favorable destiny which can only reassure once again about the future of events...\n\n2003...she revisits titles on this opus that have remained famous thanks to certain films and her luxury covers are far from unworthy, that's clear...\n\n2003...after 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' and 'Wild is the Wind', it is the turn of the film 'Best Friends' to be popular. Excellent work once again...\n\n2005...their previous collaboration had worked wonders, will this new opus also succeed in producing miracles ?\n\n2005...despite more than obvious quality, this opus will not be able to match the incredible album produced during their last meeting unfortunately...\n\n2005...this will at least have allowed us to see them together again, which is always a pleasure considering the incredible talent of each...\n\n2009...as before, the albums continue to do well but on the Singles side things are not getting better. Hard law of the trade...\n\n2009...the main thing in any case is that she is still here and still as determined not to give up as always. See you next decade...\n\n2011...here she is almost 50 years into her career, a true achievement of which only the most gifted of each generation are capable !\n\n2011...and the story is far from over once again. She will go as far as she can, to the delight of her countless fans...\n\n2012...it now remains to be seen whether se will succeed in understanding the new musical trends of this new decade. Only the future knows the answer...\n\n2012...it is clear that if she does not get closer to the younger generation, the rest of the adventure risks being particularly complicated...\n\n2014...we could have hoped that the meeting of these 2 artists would produce something grandiose but we will have to be content with a pretty title and nothing more...\n\n2014...this special duets opus will do well - like all his albums - but once again the titles which will be extracted from it will go somewhat under the radar...\n\n2014...it must be said that the style and sound of this opus does not help to attract the younger generations, it is clear...\n\n2016...same for this opus. There is quality in all of this, it is undeniable but this succession of opuses is aimed above all at its unconditional fans who inevitably ask for more...\n\n2016...we feel like we've gone back 40 years with this 'musical comedy' sound. We won't remake her again as they say...\n\n2018...it's already better with this new opus. It more or less follows the spirit of the times and thus offers herself the possibility of casting a wider net on the public side...\n\n2018...the proof with this title which will allow her to be classified again in the Singles Charts. It seems that it really didn't take much to reverse the trend...\n\n2018...it's really good to see her back in the race in this way. She still has everything she needs to shine with a much wider audience than she imagines...\n\n2021...she will have gone through the 60s, then the 70s, then the 80s, then the 90s, then the 2000s, then the 2010s and here she is quietly attacking this new 2020 decade...\n\n2021...exceptional longevity for an artist who is no less so. And the adventure is certainly far from over...\n\n2021...will she finally take the risk of trying new adventures with the younger generation, good question ? But it can only benefit her, that’s for sure...\n\n2022...it now remains to be seen whether this decade will be that of slow but irreversible deceleration or, on the contrary, that of dazzling renaissance...\n\n2024...only her knows the answer. We will therefore wait quietly to see how she will play it afterwards...\n\nWiki :\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand\n\nOfficial Website :\n\nhttps://barbrastreisand.com/walls/\n\nGreatest Hits :\n\nhttps://www.deezer.com/us/artist/5657\n\nDiscography :"
