        "text": "On February 25, 1963, Columbia Records released The Barbra Streisand Album. The first song was “Cry Me a River,” and with that a star was born. Barbra Joan Streisand had a zany personality backed by a talent that Stephen Sondheim once described as “one of the two or three best voices in the world of singing songs,” adding “It’s not just her voice but her intensity, her passion and control.” Harold Arlen, another of her favorite composers, commented, ”This young lady . . . has a stunning future.” With all-male rock groups like the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and the Four Seasons ruling the charts, no one expected a twenty-year-old female singer from Brooklyn to not just hit No. 1, but repeat that accomplishment every decade that followed all the way to the next millennium and become the best-selling female recording artist of all time.\n\nNow, for the first time ever, comes the definitive book on the extensive recording career of this towering cultural icon, the Funny Girl considered by many to be the most talented singer of her generation. Barbra Streisand: The Music | The Albums | The Singles takes readers on a journey through every album, soundtrack, and single Streisand has released over the past sixty years. Our guide on this musical tour is Matt Howe, who has run Barbra Archives, the definitive Streisand-themed website, since 2003. He also has assisted Team Streisand on her Release Me album series.\n\nBesides analysis of every studio, live concert, and official compilation release, the book contains over three hundred FULL-COLOR photos from the albums, press kits, and Streisand herself. Also included are features on both Streisand’s signature songs (“People,” “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers,” “Evergreen,” “The Way We Were,” and “Don’t Rain on My Parade”) and on her longtime collaborators (Sondheim, Marty Erlichman, Alan and Marilyn Bergman, and others.)\n\nNo gossip. No dirt. Just a deep dive into over seventy albums from The Greatest Star, including her latest release: Live at the Bon Soir.\n\nNew interviews with Jay Landers (who also wrote the Foreword), Richard Jay-Alexander, and William Ross. They all have worked along side Streisand for decades and bring an insight to how the songs were recorded.\n\nThis an oversized hardback book with full-color illustrations, printed on premium paper.\n\nThis book is now OUT OF PRINT. It will NOT be reprinted. This is now a collector's item.\n\nWatch the Book Trailer above or here.\n\n9781949024449"
