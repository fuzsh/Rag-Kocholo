Two years later, she originated the role of Fanny Brice in the stage production of Funny Girl.\n\n“I want to play with it, play with the music, you know, rephrase it depending on how I felt that night,” Streisand recalled to NPR's Terry Gross in November 2023 of her experience on the Funny Girl stage. “That's what I think keeps a performance honest. You can't just copy what you did from the night before. You know, it never works, I don't think. I like actors who respect their reality at the moment.”\n\nStreisand reprised her role of Fanny Brice in the 1968 film adaptation, which ultimately earned her an Academy Award trophy. She has since completed the “EGOT” mantle after earning a second Oscar, four Emmys, eight Grammys and one honorary Tony Award.\n\nKeep scrolling to revisit Streisand’s life in photos:\n\nCredit: Earl Leaf/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n1963\n\nStreisand met Elliot Gould, who would become her first husband, in the I Can Get It for You Wholesale audition room when she was 19.\n\n“I loved Elliott. He was familiar to me … from Brooklyn, down-to-earth. But I still wasn’t sure I was ready for marriage,” Streisand wrote in her My Name is Barbra memoir, which was published in 2023. “After all, I was only 21, and he was my first serious boyfriend. I didn’t want this marriage thing to become a big deal.”\n\nThey ultimately tied the knot in Las Vegas in 1963. Streisand and Gould divorced eight years later in 1971.\n\nLater that year, she released her first records, The Barbra Streisand Album and The Second Barbra Streisand Album.\n\nCredit: NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images\n\n2015\n\nPresident Barack Obama presented Streisand with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n“For six decades, Barbra Joan Streisand has used her extraordinary voice to bring life to the range and humor of the human experience,” Obama told reporters. “Her talent, authenticity and bold performances have left an indelible mark on American film, theater and music, inspiring generations of fans and performers. As a philanthropist and powerful advocate for women’s heart health, she encourages others to use their own voices to make a difference.”\n\nWhile listing off Streisand’s accomplishments, Obama joked that he was “getting all verklempt’ just thinking about,” using the Yiddish term for overwhelmed. (Streisand, for her part, is Jewish, and the \"verklempt\" line was a nod to a popular running Saturday Night Live sketch \"Coffee Tal,\" on which Streisand eventually made a cameo.)\n\nCredit: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Dwight D. Opperman Foundation\n\n2023\n\nStreisand’s debut memoir, the 970-page My Name Is Barbra, was published in November, chronicling her relationships and career.\n\n“For forty years, publishers have been asking me to write an autobiography. But I kept turning them down because I prefer to live in the present rather than dwell on the past,” she wrote in the prologue. “And the fact is, I’m scared that after six decades of people making up stories about me, I’m going to tell the truth, and nobody is going to believe it.”\n\nCredit: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\n\n2024\n\nStreisand received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2024 Screen Actors Guild Awards in February.\n\n“I didn’t like reality, I wanted to be in the movies even though I didn’t look like the other women on the screen. My mother said, ‘You better learn to type,’” Streisand said in her acceptance speech. “But, I didn’t listen and somehow, someway, thank you God, it all came true.”\n\nIn addition to sharing her love for film, Streisand used her moment on stage to advocate for equality.\n\n“Now, I dream of a world where such prejudice is a thing of the past,” she added to widespread applause. “I’ve always believed in the power of the truth and I think really good actors rely on that.”\n\nBrolin was pictured in the audience and adoringly watched his wife accept the prestigious trophy, which was presented by Jennifer Aniston and Bradley Cooper."
