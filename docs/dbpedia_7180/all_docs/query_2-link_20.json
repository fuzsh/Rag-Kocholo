        "text": "BARBRA STREISAND has been an actress and producer, and one of the greatest singers in U.S. history. Streisand is the only musical artist with a #1 album in the U.S. in the 1960’s, 1970’s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000’s and 2010’s. She has adoring fans — but has always remembered criticism better than praise.\n\nShe was born around 1942 and raised in a Jewish family in Williamsburg. Her name was spelled “Barbara,” the usual way. Her father, Emmanuel Streisand, was a difficult man, an English teacher who died at 34 of a cerebral hemorrhage, when Barbara was 15 months old. Barbra grew up feeling she was known in the neighborhood as “the girl without a father.”\n\nStreisand’s mother, Diane Rosen Streisand, faced the classic Jewish dilemma of how to keep kosher while eating as much Chinese food as possible. Barbara was often out in the steamy streets in the summer time with the other children, turning on a hose to make a rainbow. She had an older brother named Sheldon.\n\nWhen people sang on the stoops, she realized she could do things with her voice that other kids couldn’t. Now she thought of herself as “the girl without a father — who could sing.” She had just a single singing lesson, and it didn’t have much effect. The gift was there.\n\nYoung Barbara was talented, ambitious and difficult. She got good grades in school but when she knew the answer to a teacher’s question she would often shout it out instead of raising her hand. She got “D’s” in ”Conduct.”\n\nWhen Barbara was six, her mother sent her to an awful health camp where all the children had to wear starchy blue uniforms. But a kind woman taking care of Barbara in the afternoons knit her a lovely burgundy sweater, and Streisand began a lifelong love affair with the color burgundy.\n\nAt Erasmus Hall High, Barbara Streisand had a mild crush on the chess genius, Bobby Fischer. She aimed to be an actress, and read movie magazines, and watched movies and TV. Her mother said, “But movie stars are pretty.” She urged Barbara to be more practical, to take typing and stenography at Erasmus Hall High School “just in case.”\n\nBarbara refused.\n\nShe was a movie theater usher, but looked away from patrons as she led them to their seat. She meant to be famous someday, and didn’t want people in Brooklyn to say: ‘I remember Streisand when she was a movie usher.’\n\nStreisand felt her mother had no sense of style. Plastic slipcovers on the sofas, lampshades encased in plastic, stacks of newspapers on the floor… Barbara found it all offensive. Secretly, she vowed one day to live in high style. She went to acting auditions but never got the part. She thought of becoming a hat designer, where she could at least use her sense of style.\n\nAt 18, she became a professional singer almost by accident. She’d begun singing torch songs and Broadway show tunes in little clubs around New York like The Lion and Bon Soir. She told herself the singing was just to get some performing experience and pick up some pocket change.\n\nBon Soir was at 40 West 8th Street in Greenwich Village. You went 31 steps down to get to a small, square black room with 20 tables. The room was very dark; waiters often carried little flashlights, giving the room a twinkling quality. Singing there at 18, the stakes were low; it was almost a lark. Acting was her obsession — Hollywood was where she was headed. Singing was just something to do.\n\nShe’d belt out some Rodgers and Hart songs, or Harold Arlen or Cole Porter, collect her money at midnight and go home. But she was playful and funny with the audience and made even familiar songs sound new. The crowds began to grow bigger and more affectionate; word spread around the city that there was a kid singer named Streisand with a voice that sounded 40 years old, and a way of making other people’s songs her own. She began to realize she needed a manager; she might have a career here.\n\nWhen Streisand made a hit as a singer, she had to decide: How far was she going to take this singing career? And how much of herself would she sacrifice in order to court fame and fortune? Should she get a nose job? Change her name to something less “Jewish, like “Joanie Sands”? Should she cover recent pop hits to appeal to record companies?\n\nIn the end, Barbara Streisand decided to change very little. There would be no nose job, no songs added to the set list because a producer or record company executive asked. She did make one little change: Barbara became “Barbra.”\n\nJournalist Joanne Stang described Streisand standing “in front of a full-length mirror, head back and Egyptian eyes tilted upward — a Flatbush Nefertiti.”\n\nIn 1961, within a year of Streisand’s first professional singing gig, she had appeared on “The Tonight Show.” She sang at the hungry i nightclub in San Francisco.\n\nIn 1963, she put out her first record. The Barbra Streisand Album featured “A Sleepin’ Bee” by Harold Arlen and “Come to the Supermarket in Old Peking” by Cole Porter and “Cry Me a River” by Arthur Hamilton, which had been a hit for Julie London in 1955.\n\nWhen the album sold well, Streisand’s manager told her there were TV people wanting her for some TV specials. She did them, and the ratings were good. She starred in “Funny Girl” on Broadway which was a lot of fun — for a while. But doing the show every night for 18 months came to feel like a prison.\n\nIn 1968, at age 26, Barbra Streisand made her first movie — “Funny Girl.” She had a nice comic touch in films like “What’s Up, Doc?” She did love and politics and heartbreak well playing opposite Robert Redford in “The Way We Were.” Her movies were hits but never as popular as her records. It was maddening to her, and part of the way she dealt with it was by trying to take more control of her film work. Makeup artists and hairdressers on Hollywood sets learned that Barbra did her own hair, did her own makeup.\n\nThen Streisand read in the press that she was “difficult” or “temperamental.” She blamed the press and stopped talking to them. Later, she decided doing TV interviews was better; the viewers got more context and were more likely to understand.\n\nStung by the Hollywood prejudice that actresses were frivolous, not good at numbers, Barbra Streisand directed a 1983 movie called “Yentl.” For that movie she won a Golden Globe and five Oscar nominations.\n\nBy age 67, Barbra Streisand was living in Malibu, California, a famous film actress and director who had sold over 100 million albums — making her the top-selling female artist in the United States. And she still remembered criticism far better than praise.\n\nNo, she didn’t want to write a memoir, she said. ‘If you want to know me, listen to my albums. Come to my shows. It’s all there.’\n\nBut she knew how much of herself was NOT on stage. A truer reason for avoiding the memoir was that Streisand didn’t want to be isolated in a room. And what control freak goes willingly to confession?\n\nBut for a decade the control freak sat in the confessional, and came out with a 970-page memoir."
