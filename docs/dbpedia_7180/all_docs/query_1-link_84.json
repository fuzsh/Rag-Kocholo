        "text": "Near marriage to Canadian PM Pierre Trudeau, father of the country’s current PM, Justin. Trudeau Senior and Streisand actually first met in London, in January 1969, when they were both been seated at Princess Margaret’s table for a party at Claridge’s to celebrate the British film premiere of Funny Girl. Trudeau was in London for his first Commonwealth Conference and made quite an impression on the capital: at one point sliding down the banister of Marlborough House for the entertainment of the press.\n\nYears she refused to charge people to hear her sing, for fear she’d get stage fright a second time. Though that certainly changed: Streisand was for a long time called 'the highest-priced touring act of all time'. Tickets for her 2007 comeback show at the O2 Arena, for example, cost as much as £500. Still, though that seemed outrageous at the time, the Rolling Stones went on to charge double that at their own comeback at the same venue in 2012.\n\nYears since the grande dame became the second-ever EGOT - as in someone who has won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award - a whole 20 years before BFF Liza Minnelli. Streisand has what is called a non-competitive EGOT, meaning that one of her awards - her Special Tony Award - was honorary.\n\nViews of the Malibu photo that caused the ‘Streisand Effect’ phenomenon before she sued its taker, resulting in more than 400,000 views of the image. The phrase was coined two years later by Mike Masnick of Techdirt, while writing about Marco Beach Ocean Resort's takedown notice to urinal.net, who had used the resort's name. \"How long\", he wrote, \"is it going to take before lawyers realize that the simple act of trying to repress something they don't like online is likely to make it so that something that most people would never, ever see (like a photo of a urinal in some random beach resort) is now seen by many more people? Let's call it the Streisand Effect.\"\n\nShops Streisand has in the underground ‘mall’ beneath her house, which sell gifts, vintage clothing, dolls and sweets. Though she is far from the only famous person to have an extravagant addition to her home. Lady Gaga has a bowling alley in her mansion, while Celine Dion had a water park on her estate. Paris Hilton's mansion, meanwhile, has a separate mansion for her dogs, and of course there are Kim Kardashian's notorious bathroom sinks."
