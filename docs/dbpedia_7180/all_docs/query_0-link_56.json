        "text": "Barbra Streisand age: How old is she and how big is her family?\n\nBarbra Streisand - Memory (Official Video)\n\nBarbra Streisand was born on April 24, 1942. She celebrated her 78th birthday in 2020.\n\nBorn Barbara Joan Streisand in Brooklyn, New York, she was the daughter of Diana (born Ida Rosen) and Emanuel Streisand.\n\nHer mother was a soprano singer in her youth, but later became a school secretary. Her father was a high school teacher at the same school, where they first met.\n\nRead more: When Barry Gibb tenderly kissed Barbra Streisand live on stage at the 1981 Grammy Awards\n\nStreisand's family was Jewish, as her paternal grandparents emigrated from Galicia (Poland–Ukraine) and her maternal grandparents from the Russian Empire.\n\nIn 1943, a few months after Streisand's first birthday, her father died suddenly at the age of 34 from complications from an epileptic seizure. The family almost fell into poverty as a result.\n\nShe also has an older brother, Sheldon, and a half-sister, the singer Roslyn Kind, from her mother's remarriage to Louis Kind in 1949.\n\nWhat are Barbra Streisand's biggest movies?\n\nAfter a successful music career in the 1960s, Streisand moved into film by the end of the decade.\n\nShe starred in Funny Girl, for which she won the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.\n\nRead more: Barbra Streisand's 10 greatest songs\n\nHer other films include The Owl and the Pussycat, The Way We Were, and A Star Is Born, for which she received her second Academy Award as a composer.\n\nWith 1983's Yentl, she became the first woman to write, produce, direct, and star in a major studio film. It won an Oscar for Best Score and a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Musical, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, the first (and still only) woman to win that award.\n\nWhat is Barbra Streisand's net worth?\n\nAccording to Forbes, Barbra Streisand has a net worth of around $400 million as of 2018 (£313m).\n\nWho is Barbra Streisand's husband?\n\nStreisand has been married twice. Her first husband was MASH actor Elliott Gould, and they were married from 1963 to 1971.\n\nIn 1969 and 1970, she dated Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. She had a relationship with hairdresser and producer Jon Peters in 1974, and he went on to be her manager and producer.\n\nRead more: Richard E Grant breaks down in tears after Barbra Streisand replies to letter 47 years later\n\nStreisand also dated tennis legend Andre Agassi - who is 28 years her junior - in the early 1990s.\n\nHer second husband is actor James Brolin, whom she married in 1998.\n\nDoes Barbra Streisand have any children?\n\nBarbra Streisand has one child: her son Jason Gould, with first husband Elliott Gould.\n\nJason Gould was born in 1966, and is an actor, director, producer, writer, and singer.\n\nAged 21 in 1988, he came out as gay. Barbra said at the time: \"I would never wish for my son to be anything but what he is. He is bright, kind, sensitive, caring, and a very conscientious and good person. He is a very gifted actor and filmmaker. What more could a parent ask for in their child? I have been truly blessed.\"\n\nWhy does she spell her name 'Barbra' rather than 'Barbara'?\n\nStreisand changed her name from 'Barbara' to 'Barbra' because, she said: \"I hated the name, but I refused to change it.\"\n\nShe later said: \"Well, I was 18 and I wanted to be unique, but I didn't want to change my name because that was too false. You know, people were saying you could be Joanie Sands, or something like that. (My middle name is Joan.)\n\n\"And I said, 'No, let's see, if I take out the 'a,' it's still 'Barbara,' but it's unique.\""
