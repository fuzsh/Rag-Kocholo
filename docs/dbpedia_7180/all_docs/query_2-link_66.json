        "text": "Barbra Streisand, the Oscar- and Emmy-winning actor, singer, producer, writer and director, has been selected to receive the 2024 SAG Life Achievement Award.\n\nThe honor, given by SAG-AFTRA in recognition of career achievements, humanitarian accomplishments and “the finest ideals of the acting profession,” will be presented February 24 during the 30th annual SAG Awards.\n\nThe news comes as Streisand released her memoir, My Name is Barbra, in November.\n\nStreisand is an EGOT winner with two Oscars (Best Actress for Funny Girl in 1968 and Original Song for the love theme from A Star Is Born in 1977), four Emmys, 10 Grammys and a Tony Award for Star of the Decade in 1970. The latter came after nominations for the musicals I Can Get Get It For You Wholesale in 1962 in her acting debut and originating the Fanny Brice role in stage version of Funny Girl in 1964.\n\nThat same year she won her first Grammys for her 1963 debut The Barbra Streisand Album, and has a total of 46 Grammy noms in a career that has spawned 80 albums. She remains the only recording artist to achieve a No. 1 album in each of the past six decades. Her singing paved the way for several TV variety shows and specials; she won Emmys for them in three different decades.\n\nBehind the camera, she became the first woman to write, direct, produce and star in a major motion picture with 1983’s Yentl, her directing debut that scored five Oscar nominations. She also directed Prince of Tides (seven Oscar noms in 1991) and The Mirror Has Two Faces (two Oscar noms in 1996).\n\n“Barbra Streisand is an icon and unparalleled talent, a force of nature who has seamlessly woven her brilliance through the fabric of our industry,” SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said Wednesday in a release announcing the news. “From her earliest days captivating audiences on Broadway to her unforgettable roles in cinematic classics like Funny Girl, The Way We Were, and A Star Is Born, Barbra’s ability to inhabit her characters with authenticity is nothing short of extraordinary.”\n\nSaid Streisand: “Ever since I was a young girl sitting in the Loew’s Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, I dreamed of being one of those actresses I saw on the screen. The movies were a portal to a world I could only imagine. Even though I was an unlikely candidate, somehow my dream came true. This award is especially meaningful to me because it comes from my fellow actors, whom I so admire.”\n\nAmong her honors, Streisand was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015, a Kennedy Center Honor in 2008, an AFI Live Achievement Award in 2001 and a Cecil B. DeMille Award from the Golden Globes in 1999.\n\nThe 30th SAG Awards will air live on Netflix on February 24 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Nominations will be announced January 10."
