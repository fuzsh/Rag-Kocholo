        "text": "The first building you encounter, driving into Barbra Streisand's oceanfront compound, is a henhouse. So who knew: chickens? They're penned in a prominent spot on her exquisite grounds, amid the drop-dead Pacific views and a collection of houses decorated so meticulously by the superstar that a visitor could hyperventilate from sheer overstimulation.\n\nThe landscape's mesmerizing impact makes even poultry look radiant. As you pass the rustically immaculate chicken enclosure, you're tempted to catch the eye of one of the birds and whisper: \"Hello, gorgeous.\"\n\n\"Barbra gives some of the eggs to her neighbors,\" says her assistant Sara Recer as she conducts a tour of the property, on which a chlorinated stream leading to a lap pool meanders past grassy embankments and manicured rose gardens.\n\nOur destination is the newest addition to the compound, an amazing house overlooking the water that has been Streisand's consuming project for five years. She freely admits that it's a structure, a shrine of sorts, to her passion for early American design, to which she's devoted as much thought and time and energy as any work that brought her an Oscar or an Emmy or a Grammy. She says she's even written a script for the house that explains why she had \"1790\" carved into its stone silo, and why on another side of the house she has inscribed \"1904.\" The year contains her lucky number, 4. It also happens to be the year in which her directorial debut film, \"Yentl,\" was set.\n\n\"Instead of directing a film, I directed the building of a house,\" says Streisand, 66, who wants you to understand what she has been up to the past few years, between occasional recording sessions and the rare big-screen appearance (in \"Meet the Fockers\"). She is sitting in a formal living room of her main house, a few steps from the recently finished showplace, which, with its handsome, automated screening room, she mainly uses for entertaining. She eagerly launches into a discussion of the new house's origins, how during summer driving trips up the East Coast, she stopped with a tape measure to record the dimensions of clapboard siding; how every interior reflects an influential architect at work in 1904, from Charles Rennie Mackintosh to Hector Guimard to the firm of Greene and Greene.\n\nShe catalogues other details, the sort you'd take in only if her homes formed the basis of your doctoral dissertation: \"I don't know if you noticed, but outside of every house the flowers are only the colors of the rooms ...\"\n\nThe stories of Streisand's perfectionism — spun in the press at various times in her career as evidence of integrity, or insufferability — find traction in the intensity of her talk of brass and Stickley and moldings.\n\n\"A movie is an obsession when I'm doing it; the house became an obsession. I just didn't think it would take five years,\" she says.\n\nWhatever drives her obsessiveness, the fruits of Streisand's labors are undeniable. She is one of the greatest singers in history, amassing 50 gold, 30 platinum and 18 multi-platinum albums, a success second only to Elvis's. She's won an Oscar for acting (for the 1968 \"Funny Girl,\" in a famous tie with Katharine Hepburn) and songwriting (for \"Evergreen,\" from the 1976 remake of \"A Star Is Born\"). She's directed movies of deeply personal significance (from the underrated \"Yentl\" to the underbaked \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\") — and, if you will, recast the idea of Hollywood beauty in her own image.\n\n\"People always talk about her as a perfectionist, but what does that mean?\" asks her friend and longtime collaborator Marvin Hamlisch, who met her as a rehearsal pianist on \"Funny Girl,\" the 1964 Broadway musical that launched her as a phenomenon.\n\n\"Her talent is her voice and her unbelievable taste level,\" he adds. \"Let's assume you were working for NASA and they're going to be putting a man on the moon. Everyone has to do a perfect job. What she is, is the vessel that can get you to the moon.\"\n\nTom Santopietro, author of the 2006 book \"The Importance of Being Barbra,\" says our fascination with her has to do with that aspect of her drive that believes \"the public deserved her best.\"\n\n\"The Barbra Streisand engine is: What's next?\" says Santopietro, a longtime Broadway theater manager. \"This incessant 'what's next,' it's always what's just over the horizon. That fuels the artistry.\"\n\n\"Actor-singer-director-composer-producer-designer-activist\" is how she is somewhat grandly introduced in her own handout biography. And now, all these hyphens are to be linked and acknowledged in a single evening Sunday, as she adds to her trophy shelves her Kennedy Center Honors medal.\n\n\"People say: 'You're getting the Kennedy honor? I thought you got this like 10 years ago,' \" she says. It's true: The award is overdue. Politically, though, the timing is odd. When it's pointed out that she's accepting the award in the presence of President Bush, the liberal Democrat shifts a bit uncomfortably.\n\n\"I would have loved to be there during Bill Clinton, of course,\" she says of the president she was closest to; she endorsed Hillary Clinton this year, before shifting to Barack Obama, after he became a numerical certainty for the nomination. But the results of Nov. 4 are \"such an incredible step forward for our country, against racism — the good guy won.\"\n\nSo she'll willingly shake hands this weekend with Bush?\n\nShe grins. \"Barack took the high road in this election,\" she says, \"and I'm going to have to take it, too.\"\n\nStreisand is a sharp-witted if less exuberant version of the passionate, iron-willed characters she created in her two most memorable movies, \"Funny Girl\" and \"The Way We Were.\" Wearing her hair in a sleek variation of that classic Streisand bob, she's a youthful 66. Svelter, too, than she looked as Ben Stiller's earthy Jewish mom in the 2004 \"Fockers,\" the only movie she's been in since 1996's \"The Mirror Has Two Faces.\"\n\nAt 19, Streisand opened in her first Broadway show, \"I Can Get It for You Wholesale,\" earning a Tony nomination. Maybe when you are both famous and put up for prizes your entire adult life, image maintenance becomes a bore. Asked whether her outspoken politics might have touched any raw public nerves over the years, she replies: \"I don't think about that stuff. Did people stop buying my records? Maybe. But that doesn't matter to me. I don't care.\"\n\nShe turns down a lot of awards, especially when they require her to speak. A 1995 address at Harvard, where she was invited to talk about the artist as citizen, made her a complete wreck: \"I was rewriting as I was walking up to the podium.\" Years ago, she declined an offer for that flashbulb-popping emblem of Tinseltown, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n\"I refused it because I thought it was so hokey. ... It's like to me, always the work should speak for itself. And nobody agrees, they have to force me. And guess what? You know when I got the star? When my husband got it!\"\n\nHer husband of 10 years is actor James Brolin, who figures, to some degree, in the issue of why her movie career has all but ceased. She says she does want to direct another film, citing \"The Normal Heart,\" the prescient AIDS play by Larry Kramer, but wonders how the all-consuming task of making a movie would affect her relationship.\n\n\"I've never really been, you know, married during a directorial time in my life,\" she observes. \"How do you, you know, balance the personal?\"\n\nNo process engages Streisand quite like what happens when she's in the director's chair: \"It just encompasses everything you are, everything you know, everything you've learned, all your instincts, feelings, psychoanalysis, dealing with actors, getting the best out of them.\"\n\nTo those who've studied her work, the fact that directing would come to be the primary passion makes eminent sense. \"Of course!\" Santopietro says. \"She's creating her own universe.\"\n\nThe Kennedy Center Honors should be a pleasant distraction. \"It's nice, I like it, because I love America,\" she says. \"It's an American tradition. I loved President Kennedy. I sang for him.\" A photo in her study depicts the young Streisand gazing at JFK as he signs an autograph.\n\n\"And the White House is architecturally so amazing. I actually, in my New York apartment, copied the second-floor draperies. But I had a better color yellow on the walls.\""
