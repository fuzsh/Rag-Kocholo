        "text": "Following a year-long search, the Board of Education has selected Dr. Nicholas Bernice to be Ringwood’s next superintendent of schools. The BOE voted unanimously on Feb. 1 to approve Bernice’s appointment to the district’s top administrative position at a salary of $145,000 annually.\n\nBernice has been employed in various Bergen County schools throughout his career. Since 2009, he has been at Leonia Middle School, where he served two years as vice principal before being promoted to principal. Prior to that, he was the vice principal at West Brook Middle School in Paramus. Before becoming an educational administrator, he was a science teacher at Northern Highlands Regional High School and Immaculate Heart Academy. He has also taught educational courses including data analysis at the post-graduate level at St. John’s University and Ramapo College.\n\nAlthough he was not present during the Feb. 1 BOE meeting, Bernice issued a statement the following day.\n\n\"I’m excited about the opportunity to work in such a great community,\" he said. \"I consider myself very fortunate to serve Ringwood as their next superintendent.\"\n\nThe contract takes effect on Aug. 1 and runs through June 30, 2020. In addition to his salary, Bernice will be eligible to receive merit pay based on the achievement of specific goals after the first full year of employment.\n\nBOE President Ray Dwyer felt confident in choosing Bernice to lead Ringwood’s schools through the next four years.\n\n\"I think he’s going to do very well in this district,\" Dwyer said after the meeting. \"He’s got a great personality, he’s highly qualified and he’s got a great approach to things. We’re excited to have him on board.\"\n\nThe superintendent search committee consisted of trustees Dwyer, Cheryl Botsolas, Allison Beesley and Cythnia Carey. They received 24 applications for the position, from which they selected six interview candidates. Bernice and one other applicant were invited back for a second round of interviews.\n\nHis extensive training and past experience impressed the committee throughout the selection process.\n\n\"We’re very optimistic about his future,\" Beesley said.\n\nBernice holds a bachelor’s degree in general science from Fordham University, as well as advanced degrees in education from Ramapo College, St. Peter’s College and St. John’s University. In 2015 he was recognized as an Exemplary Educator by the NJ Department of Education.\n\nIn addition to his success as an educational administrator, Bernice is a Chief Boatswain’s Mate in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve, a position he has held for more than 20 years. During his service with the Coast Guard, he has been decorated with various awards, including the Humanitarian Service Medal, the Global War on Terror Medal, the USCGR Good Conduct Medal, and Military Outstanding Volunteer Medal. In 2003 and 2004, he was named Station New York Reservist of the Year. He received two Coast Guard Achievement Medals for Superior Performance of Duty for service on and following the 9-11 terror attacks.\n\nThe diversity of Bernice’s background made a lasting impression on the search committee.\n\n\"He’ll be a good asset to the district,\" Botsolas said.\n\nEmail: stewart@northjersey.com"
