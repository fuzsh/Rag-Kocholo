        "text": "Education NSWÂ introduces Parkwood Secondary College in Ringwood North, for all your education and learning needs.\n\nParkwood Secondary College is a 7-12 college that prides itself on providing a learning environment and engaging curriculum where all students are able to achieve.\n\nParkwood’s expansive grounds, landscaped gardens and mature trees, provide a unique setting in the Eastern Suburbs for students to engage in their learning. Parkwood has approximately 400 students, which enables strong relationships to be built between students and staff. This is advantageous as it allows the school to focus on quality teaching and learning for each student.\n\nAt Parkwood we place high expectations on all students to perform with a shared belief that all students want to learn and do their best. This occurs when students are supported by tested teaching methods and student commitment. On that basis every student who enrols at Parkwood will successfully complete Year 12, and we make this expectation known to students from their first day at school. The teachers at Parkwood are committed to working collaboratively to ensure students are engaged, safe and happy learners in reaching their potential.\n\nWelcome to Parkwood Secondary College one of the popular educators in your Ringwood North area. Our aim is help you in your learning journey.\n\nWe endeavour to celebrate each other's uniqueness by providing opportunity for all and to develop a culture that identifies that the journey towards excellence is often paved with trial and error, risk taking, learning from mistakes, flexibility and adaptability. We believe that encouraging students to take ownership of the learning is critical in achieving the best learning outcomes and that implicit in this concept is that students learn their own areas of strength and areas of development, through useful and explicit feedback."
