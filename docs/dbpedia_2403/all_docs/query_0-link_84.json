        "text": "Welcome Back to Term 2\n\nA belated welcome back to the term as we come to the end of week two. I trust that you had an enjoyable Easter with an opportunity to spend time together with family and friends, or perhaps you finally had a long awaited chance to travel within Australia. Our students appear to have returned with enthusiasm ready to tackle the challenges of the busy term ahead.\n\nSadly, I notify the community of the passing of Ms Rosa Coppola this week after a lengthy period of illness. We remember Ms Coppola as a dedicated and creative Art Teacher. Ms Coppola has been a member of the Aquinas community for 17 years and in a recent email to me said; “I have enjoyed and found it so stimulating working with Aquinas visual communication students during my 17 years.” Ms Coppola believed that it was a privilege to teach students to use their personal creativity and develop a love of art and she had this gift.\n\nEternal rest grant unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them. May their souls and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace.\n\nStudents were informed of Ms Coppola’s passing during morning prayer yesterday and the Chapel is open today and Monday as a place of solitude. Students have been asked to speak to their parents if this news has raised concerns and support is also available to students through their pastoral teams and the YFC.\n\nANZAC Day\n\nOur ANZAC Day celebration at the College on the morning of April 26 was a solemn, yet beautiful, liturgy led by students from the Year 11 Faith and Liturgy class. Once again, our student body responded as appropriate and showed genuine respect in their silence for those who have sacrificed so much in the arenas of war and as peacekeepers. On ANZAC Day itself our College Captains represented us proudly and laid a wreath at the Dawn Service at Ringwood Clocktower.\n\nParent Teacher Meetings\n\nParent Teacher Meetings concluded this week. Thank you to those who were able to take advantage of this opportunity to discuss the progress of their children. I also wish to extend my thanks to the teaching and support staff for their continued efforts to provide meaningful feedback to you on your child’s progress. As you are aware, we continued to offer Parent Teacher Interviews online given the feedback that we received during 2020 and in response to our ongoing CovidSafe precautions. We will continue to review this format going forward.\n\nCollege Patrons Mass\n\nNext Tuesday we gather as a school community to celebrate our College Mass in remembrance of our College Patrons - St Thomas Aquinas, St Mary MacKillop and Blessed Edmund Rice. We give thanks for the leadership offered by the Christian Brothers, Dominican and Josephite Sisters in the founding story of Aquinas College. Thank you to Ms Tania Grace for her work in preparing our liturgy and to Fr. Tony Doran for presiding.\n\nVisit of Mr Michael Sukkar MP\n\nYesterday we welcomed Mr Sukkar back to the College so that he could see the shade sails that have been erected in the quadrangle with the assistance of an $18,000 grant from the Australian Government. Mr Sukkar toured the College and was impressed with the ongoing developments since his days as a student.\n\nEnrolment for Year 7 2023 - current Aquinas families\n\nFamilies are reminded that we do not presume that you require a place in Year 7 unless we are made aware by the completion of an application form and, with very high demand on places, there is the risk of no vacancy if you miss the deadline. Applications are now open for Year 7 2023 (current Grade 5) and close on August 20. Please contact Ms Maddy Kalla on 9259 3008 or registrar@aquinas.vic.edu.au should you require an application form or have any questions.\n\nUniform Changeover\n\nWe come to the end of our transition period this week and from Monday, students must be in full winter uniform. Details of the College winter uniform can be found here.\n\nDarren Atkinson\n\nPrincipal\n\nIs social media good for you?\n\nTechnology is an integral part of our lives. It enables us to connect with family and friends, be a source of great joy, disappointment and frustration. It is easy to focus on all the potential risks, negatives and harm social media can bring. It is important to also recognize the positives and the importance of building our capacity to navigate the digital domain safely with integrity. It’s unlikely the plethora of social media platforms will disappear anytime soon and nor is it what we probably want. Incredible humanitarian social action can occur harnessing the instantaneous global reach social media can offer.\n\nInternationally recognised expert in online cyber safety and digital citizenship, Robyn Trevyard suggests we should try and keep things in perspective and be an active presence online to appreciate the complexities of this domain our children and young people are growing up in.\n\nFor a significant period of time, cyber safety literature has referred to young people being ‘digital natives’ and parents, grandparents and teacher (pending on age) digital immigrants. Our students at Aquinas are growing up in the Instagram and Tik Tok era. Facebook is very much an ‘oldies’ space and what even was Myspace? This doesn’t not mean young people don’t need support and guidance from their elders. In fact many would argue the level of mental ill health in society (particularly of youth) requires significant and immediate action. We must look for opportunities to walk beside young people as they navigate the turbulence of adolescence amidst the uncertainty of our times. Whilst many adults experienced adolescence in significantly different ways than their children, an open mind, willingness to listen (even to things we don’t like hearing) and creation of opportunities to learn with and from young people is a valuable protective factor. Connecting with young people on a variety of levels and mediums (including digital platforms) is important. Social media can divide and isolate as well as inform and connect.\n\nErik Woods New York Times writer and radio show host offered the following observation of 'click culture'.\n\n\"Even as the internet provides us great advances, it also segments us. We have social media tribes and our self-esteem is based on likes and retweets.\"\n\nWe all have days where our confidence and self-esteem may be lagging. Self-esteem is something that invariably fluctuates. Pockets of emotional turbulence and self-doubt are normal and to a degree necessary to build capacity and self-awareness. A key issue to keep in mind is the impact harmful content can have on mental wellbeing especially for children and young people. Within the context of social media and the issue of mental ill-health is amplified because of the ways in which it is being used and how it replaces other desirable pursuits. Social media can present a view on the world that is often filtered and unrealistic. Edited images of perfection offers young people a distorted account of society making their pursuit of happiness or success less attainable.\n\nIn light of all these issues is social media good for you? Robyn Trevyuard acknowledges both the challenge and real dangers associated with social media, however also argues young people can use it to improve their lives.\n\nHer research showed 68% of teens claim social media provides them with support during difficult times. Furthermore 46% of adolescent girls agree that social media empowers them to speak about thing they care about. 83% of teens say that social media makes them feel more connected to their friends. Young people have achieved great things by taking to social media to express their concerns. Gun laws in the United States, gender equity, violence prevention and climate change to name a few key areas young people use social media in acts of positive global stewardship.\n\nThe key question being how we can help prepare young people to lead change and use social media well? We must have courageous, honest conversations and engage in deep listening with and for young people. As a starting point I invite you to take the quiz: How much do you know about social media and digital reputation or check out some of the fact sheets provided below.\n\nhttps://aquinas.vic.schooltv.me/newsletter/social-media-and-digital-reputation\n\nhttps://aquinas.vic.schooltv.me/newsletter/social-media-and-digital-reputation#block-views-newsletter-factsheets-block\n\nRobyn also provided some basic conversation starters to support families to have these important conversations. Social media is a space powered by people and as such offers great opportunity to spread kindness and social awareness, educate, create and enhance identity, diversity and tolerance. The well-worn cliché ‘young people are the future’ and young people can use digital media to be active agents of change. As adults we have both a responsibility and opportunity to ensure we influence our children and young people to advocate for positive social change, tolerance and kindness in our world.\n\nCheryl Kane\n\nChild Safety and Wellbeing Coordinator\n\nIntroducing our new Year 7 Leaders\n\n\"I went to Holy Spirit primary school and I was one of the four school leaders last year. I have two sisters, one who is in Year 10 and one who is in Grade 4. I have a Jack Russell dog named Jack. I play basketball and football and I like to go on bike rides with my friends. I also enjoy going to the beach and boogie boarding. I barrack for Collingwood and I enjoy going to watch them play with my dad and my friends.\n\nI decided to nominate for Year 7 Leader as I wanted to represent the voice of my peers, encourage positive relationships across the year level and be able to influence decision making at Aquinas. I know being a leader brings invaluable learning experiences. The most important qualities of leadership are communication, teamwork, support and encouragement, respect for others, and initiative. I personally try to apply these attributes to everything I do (school, sport and any other activities). 2020 was a difficult year for everyone and we all missed out on many activities and events. I want this year to be a really enjoyable year for everyone, and I encourage everyone to get involved in Aquinas activities.\"\n\nLachlan Motteram\n\n\"I first applied to be Year 7 Captain as I saw it as an opportunity to expand my leadership skills and be a part of the Aquinas community, as well as to encourage others to step out of their comfort zone. There were many steps to take in the process, with so many amazing candidates, and after several weeks of written applications and interviews with the teachers, I was immensely honoured to be named one of the two Year 7 Captains of 2021.\n\nI can’t wait to engage in the role of Year 7 captain and I am thrilled to be able to work with students and teachers at Aquinas to allow for every student to have a voice to make a difference in the community. I am also excited to learn from the senior leadership team, team leaders, and staff, as well as being a classmate and friend that anyone can come up to. I’m really excited as to what this year will bring as I never imagined I would be so fortunate to be in the position as a student leader at Aquinas, Year 7!\"\n\nHolly McGill\n\n“The Arts enable students to develop their creative and expressive capacities by learning about the different practices, disciplines and traditions that have shaped the expression of culture locally, nationally and globally. Students are both artist and audience in the Arts. They make and respond and learn to appreciate the specific ways this occurs in different disciplines.” The VCAA\n\nAt Aquinas we provide such a wide range of Arts subjects, giving opportunities for students to express themselves in diverse and rich ways. In a world filled with noise and images, to spend time considering how and why something is created, and its impact on an audience can be significant. To appreciate others points of view and connect with artists and performers from different cultures enriches our lives.\n\nRecently there was a call to remove some TV shows and movies from public viewing due to the appropriateness of the content - Faulty Towers for example. This was discussed with the VCE Studio Arts class this week while we were focussing on historical and cultural context. We looked at artworks showing stereotypes and imagery we now consider inappropriate and erroneous. These works provide insight on the values of the time, how far we have come and how much we still have to talk about. To remove these works from our galleries, similarly to the idea of removing shows from our screens, would be to curate our history. It is important we open discussions, learn from the past, imagine diverse contexts and appreciate how we have evolved and gone past ‘politically correct’ to be ‘morally considerate’ in how we view, express and embrace diversity, this is encouraged in and through The Arts.\n\nA student recently questioned the value of Art class - a valid question and one I welcome. To have a group of young people come into a room and make things, then walk out and head off to Maths or Science...what was the point? The problem wasn’t that I didn’t have an answer, the problem was that I had a million reasons and wanted to jump up and down to tell them how rich their lives could be through experiencing The Arts!\n\nI didn’t do that, they would have thought I was mad! Rather, I asked them to imagine no Art at school. The obvious discussion was about not having a class where they would paint and make stuff from clay, but then it got real - the value of expressing creative ideas, the benefit of movement, imagination, the practical application of designs, the freedom of exploring, the achievement of creating something original, useful, beautiful, that tells our stories, sparks discussion, is provocative, that responds and reacts to our culture and connects us.\n\n“Through engaging in The Arts students are entertained, challenged and provoked to respond to questions and assumptions about individual and community identity, taking into account different histories and cultures.” The VCAA.\n\nOur young people have the opportunity to be vulnerable, supported, a viewer and consumer, a creator and risk taker. Visual and Performing Arts are essential and inevitable.\n\nSandi van der Niet\n\nArts Learning Area Leader\n\nWhen selecting their courses students and their parents often ask the question, \"what job will this subject train me for?”. Which is a reasonable question but in the contemporary terms where the average person will change careers around 5-7 times in their working life; and in a highly competitive employment market (where there are an average of 19 applicants for every job where only 3 get interviewed) shouldn’t the question be, “what employable skills would this subject help me develop?”\n\nIn a 2019 Department of Employment Skills, Small and Family Business research report* employers were surveyed on the skills that they want in their prospective employees. The report discovered that the essential 7 employability skills that employers valued, as much as technical skills, were:\n\nCommunication and Teamwork Skills\n\nInterpersonal and People Skills\n\nCreativity and Problem Solving Adaptability and Resilience\n\nReliability and Motivation\n\nCritical Thinking\n\nDigital Literacy\n\nAnd with predictions that 84% of new jobs will be created in service industries the ability to communicate, work in teams, relate to other people, be creative and adapt is going to be more essential than ever.\n\nSo if you think, “Drama isn’t important,” you may want to shift your thinking.\n\nDrama at all levels has a strong emphasis on collaborative work. Students work in teams toward a common goal; their communication, interpersonal and people skills progress through this collaboration. Teamwork requires adaptability and resilience particularly when students find themselves working with others who have a range of ideas and opinions. The need to problem solve in order to work out the best attack on their ensemble task frequently requires compromise and critical thinking to meet the directive. Add to this the need to create and use a range of digital resources for research and presenting work then you might be contemplating, “Why aren’t I do doing Drama?”\n\nThe acting in Drama might be called ‘pretending’ but the development of employability skills it delivers certainly aren’t pretend.\n\nClaire Travers\n\nTeacher\n\n* https://cica.org.au/wp-content...\n\nFlower Field\n\nA white rose.\n\nRoots twisting into the cold earth, struggling to curl around rocks, hidden under the snow. It seemed impossible for it to grow in the frigid air but still it persisted. The stalk stretched up toward the sun, trying to catch the feeble sunlight. The single flower glistened in the morning light, dew dripping off its petals.\n\nIt lived alone on that peak, the other flowers unable to live in such a climate. There were fields of blue and red near the base, whispering to each other. They were envious of the rose. How it stood alone looking down at the world. What a view it must have had. Able to see the land for miles around while the other flowers were stuck in the damp grass, only seeing each other. A constant battle of beauty. How they wished they stood tall and proud, sought out by travellers who climbed the mountain. All the attention. All the praise.\n\nOf course, they didn’t know how the rose felt. They couldn’t imagine it would want anything more than the mystery and beauty it already held. But it struggled every day, using all its strength to stay alive.\n\nWhen it first grew, it felt special. It enjoyed the attention and loved how everyone recognised its petals. But the isolation broke its heart and left it longing for company. The rose wished fate didn’t place it atop the mountain. It craved to belong, to flourish among the fields that looked so alive.\n\nBoth sides wished they were the other. Both sides were unhappy with their lives and unable to live with what they were given. Ungrateful, hostile, striving for something they could never be.\n\nIt’s impossible to live in harmony when such hatred and envy for each other exists. It’s impossible to accept what has been given, to fill your heart with hope, loving yourself, if you have that grain of envy for the other.\n\nLily Evans\n\nYear 10\n\nCommemorating ANZAC Day\n\n\"With a variety of speeches, prayers and music, the ANZAC day dawn service at the Ringwood Clocktower was a chance to reflect on the men and women who made the great sacrifice for our country those many years ago, pay our respect to them and their families and to honour the spirit of ANZAC. Following a year of separation, being able to gather as a community tightly huddled around the Clocktower with performances from a local brass band, pipe ensemble and bugle rendition of The Last Post - as opposed to a shaky tuba performance by me in my driveway last year - was a promising reminder of the community we know and love, as well as the return to normality. Looking up at the Clocktower, its proud face lit in red, standing as a beacon of memory above an ever developing Ringwood metropoly while hundreds of silent individuals had gathered around its base to pay their respects to the fallen was a touching example of the Australian, ANZAC and Ringwood spirit and is one that will stay with those in attendance for time to come. Lest we forget.\"\n\nFlynn Wilkinson\n\nCollege Captain\n\n\"After only being able to honour our ANZACs from the end of our driveways last year due to restrictions, it was fantastic to have the opportunity to come together as a community for this year’s dawn service at the Ringwood Clocktower. It was an important time for reflection for us all as we laid a wreath at the foot of the monument, thinking about the ANZAC spirit. Those who have and those who continue to serve in our armed forces have sacrificed so much for us all and our prayers and gratitude are with those brave men and women and their families.\"\n\nMikaela Tenney\n\nCollege Captain\n\nOne of my favourite events to attend is the annual Maroondah Youth awards. These awards recognise the strengths, resilience, and achievements of young people aged between 10-25 in Maroondah. The event is a night filled with personal stories, inspiring speeches, amazing performances, and recognition of young people. Despite the fact I have been attending these religiously over the last five years or so, each and every time I am still amazed at the talent, capacity and resilience of the young people in our community.\n\nThis year the award ceremony was like many others things, impacted by the events of last year. In a way it made the achievements of those we gathered to recognise even more special! Whilst there is no shortage of great young people at Aquinas, it was my privilege to witness four of our students receive awards from Maroondah Mayor Cr Kylie Spears and various councillors.\n\nMikaela Tenney one of our current College Leaders was recognised in the category of Leadership. Mikaela has served our school community in a leadership capacity each year at Aquinas. Her dedication to supporting others in particular last year during remote learning was simply inspirational.\n\nDylan Tudor was recognised for his achievements also in the category of Leadership. Dylan is an active year level student leader, a motivated and energetic member of in our Chid Safety and Wellbeing Student Advisory Committee and other capacities outside of school.\n\nAndre Painter was recognised in the Perseverance category for his determination and dedication to his learning. Andre has an impressive work ethic and is willing to seek further clarification of any issue when required. Andre reminds us intelligence comes in many shapes and forms, It’s not if your smart, it how your smart!\n\nIsabelle Flores (class of 2020) also received a Perseverance award. Completing Year 12 in a very different year, establishing an online business to replace the loss of part time income and keep her motivated and busy is testament to Isabelle’s character and strength.\n\nLast but definitely not least Ted Walker O’Brien’s award recognised his achievement and character strength of Perseverance. Ted has a bright future ahead given his motivation and entrepreneurial positive outlook on life. In addition to managing his learning form home in 2020, Ted established his own car detailing business to replace casual employment during lockdowns. Ted is a fine example of self-efficacy, determination and hands on learning!\n\nWhat a pleasure to see our students shine their individual and our collective Aquinas light proudly and bright.\n\nDespite limited numbers being able to attend and other commitments preventing some recipients receiving their award in person more people than ever before could access the awards via a live stream option.

We took the Senior Boys and Girls teams who had been competing in the EISM championships.\n\nA report from the Senior boys team\n\n\"On Tuesday, in the last week of term our small team from EISM went to the State Ultimate Competition in the city, where there was a large tournament of about 18 schools all competing. Caulfield Grammar managed to beat us early on in the morning, and then we beat the other four teams in our pool to finish second in our pool, with Caufield on top. Since we were the highest ranked second placed in all the pools, we entered the finals and were up against Caulfield again. Once again they beat us. We ended up finishing third place overall beating Covenant College Geelong. Because Caulfield had two teams, it worked out that we were the second best school in the whole competition! Overall everyone had a fantastic time, and we’re confident we’ll do better next time! A huge thank you to our coach Mr Jess on his work with us.\"\n\nThe Boys team: Sam Alvarez, Max Baines, Nathan Boland, Isaac Curtis, Billy Gleeson, Charlie Hewitson, Kobe Hussey, Joel Jobling, Lewis Johnson, Max Napolitano, Rainier Palao.\n\nA huge congratulations to Max Napolitano whose performance at the championships and trials has seen him selected in the U18 Men's Ultimate team for Victoria!\n\nA report by Nathan Boland\n\n\"The Aquinas College Senior Girls Ultimate Frisbee team recently competed in the Victorian Schools Championships. The team was extremely competitive, winning their first four matches convincingly and finishing first in their pool. The girls then had a solid win in the semi against Canterbury Girls Grammar School, before proceeding to the Grand Final. Here they faced Covenant College Geelong in a very tough, competitive match. Covenant started well with a few quick scores giving them a decent lead, but to our girls’ credit, they stepped up the defensive pressure and fought back from a 5 point deficit to eventually go down by just 2. Our team gave it their all and walked away with a silver medal and their heads held high after a successful day and a good result. The Aquinas team should be very proud of their display of impressive skills and fitness, determination and positive attitudes throughout the day, as well as proud of their commitment in preparing for the tournament. They have worked hard, developed as a team and have played every match in the spirit of the game. A fantastic and inspiring effort from this wonderful team.\"\n\nCongratulations to the team: Mikayla Aloi, Christina Doan, Erin Gualano, Natasha Langsdon, Mikaela Tenney, Emily Box, Indi Clarke, Rory O'Brien, Chloe Ross, Issy Edwards and Sophie Stokes. Coached by Miss Megan Lemieszek\n\nThe senior boys and girls touch football teams competed in the Victorian Schools Touch Football Championships in the second last week of Term 1 at Endeavour Hills.\n\nA huge thank you to the team coaches: Mr Steve McGrath (girls team) and Mr Tom Wilson (boys team)\n\n\"The senior girls touch team competed in a round robin format. There were three pool matches before finals so the potential to play five games in total for the day, a tough challenge in itself given the unexpected humid and hot conditions. The first game of the day was definitely an eye opener for our girls as we got a little bit overwhelmed by the speed of play by the opposition and a lack of awareness for the width and space to have to defend. To the girls credit after a review and reflection post game the girls turned it around in the second game and demonstrated an ability to drive with run and support through the middles and links making the most of quick turnovers. Reward for effort with several tries and a win gave the girls confidence in their ability and recognition for their efforts at training to implement game strategies and tactics. We finished the pool matches with one win and two losses which meant that we were playing in the Plate finals. The first semi final against Fountain Gate was a game played with great spirit and close all the way throughout, finishing level at the siren which meant we went into a drop off period. Both teams dropped two players from the field essentially now 4 V 4 for a two minute period. Fortunately we were able to score a great try on the wing just before the siren to win and move into the Plate final against Luther. The Final saw a similar outcome to the Semi with both teams tied at the end of the game and again going into a drop off. Unfortunately one of the Luther girls saw a gap in our defence and scored with a great diving try to win the game. It was great to watch the girls improve considerably through the day as they gained confidence and a greater understanding of game play. Well done to all the girls who competed, and thanks to the Year 12 girls especially for their commitment over the years and we look forward to next year.\"\n\nCongratulations to the players - Emily Box, Tahliah Cameron, Sienna Devink, Kamryn Disney, Leila Hedderwick, Sienna Jones, Natasha Langsdon, Ashlyn Tait, Sophie Stokes, Grace Walsh.\n\n\"It was brilliant to be back in a competition setting and competing against other schools again after what transpired in 2020. The Senior Boys started the day very strongly with a good win against Luther College. With solid competition throughout the day both teams competed extremely well. With the boys finishing the day with 2 wins, 1 draw and 3 losses. The boys tried really hard and the losses were always close, which was so very impressive. As a result we would find ourselves runners up in the plate competition. Thanks to all the Year 12's for their commitment over the journey of their touch football careers at Aquinas College, your contribution hasn't gone unnoticed. Finally, thanks to all students and Mr. Brummell for their commitment towards the Touch Footy carnivals and championship.\"\n\nCongratulations to the players - Seb Di Simone, Owen Foxwell, Luke Dowling-Horgan, George Sajive, Ryan Webster, Harry Flynn, Jesse Meikle, Michael Barics, Pat Lavemai, Jayden Urban.\n\nBOYS BASKETBALL A\n\nAquinas 63 defeated Emmaus 50\n\nAfter a great season with only losing once and that was to Emmaus in a really tight game, the boys were looking forward to the grand final, and what a great game to finish off a great season. A team effort ensured that we controlled the game and ultimately a positive result. This team of great young adults is extremely talented, dedicated, supportive and passionate about playing with and for each other. They should be very proud of themselves and the way they handled the season. They are all an asset to the Aquinas community on the court, but more importantly off the court. Well done on a great season and the grand final win!\n\nBOYS BASKETBALL B\n\nAquinas 41 defeated Mt Scopus 40\n\nThe Aquinas boys took on an unfamiliar foe in Mt Scopus, with our round one match up cancelled due to Covid restrictions at the\n\ntime. The game was hard fought from the first whistle to the last, neither side holding more than a 5 point lead at any stage and many lead changes as momentum swung. In the first half we battled hard on the boards against a bigger Scopus outfit, but kept them in the game with sloppy turnovers at times. Jake Moore and Felix Seymour were strong on offence, getting to the basket and forcing the Scopus talls into some early foul trouble. Tom Rees, Linden Hammersley and Sean Griffiths all played great roles off the bench, bringing energy and being productive on offence. Reid McGreevy had a big role to play as our only true tall and he stood up with strong work at both ends. Michael Barics whilst undersized, was a beast on the boards and his hustle made sure we didn't give up too many second opportunities.\n\nThe second half was more of the same. as the game went down to the wire. Down 5 with 2 minutes remaining, our boys were able to hang in, make smart plays and give ourselves the opportunity to take the win. Josh Leonard was the stand out player on the court and deservedly awarded the MVP medal for the game. He was prolific all game but took over down the stretch making clutch free throws and the go ahead basket with 4 seconds remaining. The final score of 41-40 was a true indication of the closeness of the contest, and a win to savour. Congratulations to both our boys and Scopus, who all played the game hard, but in great spirit. Nothing like winning the close ones, well done boys!\n\nSENIOR GIRLS BASKETBALL A\n\nAquinas 36 def Emmaus 29\n\nIn a really tight final that saw the lead change many times, we finally took control in the last few minutes of the game. The girls used the ball effectively throughout the game and our defence was very impressive. It was really pleasing to see how hard the team worked when under strong pressure from Emmaus. Well done to all the players for their endeavours and commitment to EISM Sport at Aquinas\n\nSENIOR GIRLS BASKETBALL B\n\nAquinas 26 lost to Emmaus 32\n\nCongratulations to all the players on the way we played today. We tried really hard against a very consistent team. We were always in the game and put lots of pressure on them but missed some key shots that could have made the difference. It was an exciting final as both teams pushed each other to play good basketball. Well done to everyone on your performance today and across the season\n\nSENIOR GIRLS ULTIMATE FRISBEE\n\nAquinas 10 lost to Mt Lilydale 16\n\nIn a great final we worked really hard and pushed Mt Lilydale all the way for the first three quarters. Unfortunately, they were able to overrun us and ended up winning convincingly. Well done to all the players for a wonderful season and your commitment to the team. Congratulations to all the Year 12s for your valuable contribution to the team and the Ultimate frisbee team over the past four years.\n\nSENIOR GIRLS SOCCER\n\nAquinas 4 defeated Mt Lilydale 1\n\nThe girls were very excited to get to play Mt Lilydale at home in the grand final having lost to them at the start of the season. We started well but were unable to take some chances early. Mt Lilydale scored first and this made the girls even more determined and we replied quickly after their goal. At half time the scores were level at 1 all. Scoring first in the second half was vital and the team's confidence grew and we took control of the game, scoring three times in the second half to win well. Congratulations to all the players on a superb final and their commitment to the each other throughout the season\n\nSENIOR BOYS SOFTBALL\n\nAquinas 0 lost to Mt Scopus 15\n\nAfter having had a great season and not losing a game, we met Mt Scopus in the final (who we did not play because of the Covid lockdown). Unfortunately we met a very strong team who were clearly the best team in the EISM. We tried hard but could not match their skills and general play today. Well done boys on a great season and commitment to the team.\n\nSENIOR BOYS TABLE TENNIS A\n\nAquinas 0 lost to Donvale 6\n\nThe boys were looking forward to a really great final against the only team that had defeated us throughout the season. In every game we pushed them all the way but could not get key points. We were beaten by a good team who played consistent table tennis. Well done to all the players on a great season. Look out 2022, we will be back"
