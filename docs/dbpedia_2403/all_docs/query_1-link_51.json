The first floor also connects to the upper level of the Workshop and Trades Building.\n\n​​​​We completely redeveloped the school, including constructing a new Junior School building, replacing 11 relocatables with permanent classrooms, refurbishing the library, and reconfiguring the car park.​\n\nThe Maroondah Education Plan includes Ringwood Secondary College's redevelopment, a stadium for Norwood Secondary College, a performing arts centre for Mullum Primary School, and the consolidation of Melba College's two campuses onto one site.​​"
