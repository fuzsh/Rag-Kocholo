        "text": "We built on the upgrades completed in 2018 and 2019 with further modernisation of the school. We worked with school leaders to ensure the work helps them achieve their educational goals and that improvements are targeted where they are needed most.\n\nWe delivered a new architect-designed modular building to Norwood Secondary College. To do this we demolished Block A and replaced it with a Science Building.\n\nOur modular facilities require less time for planning and construction, resulting in reduced disruption to students, staff and teaching programs. They are sustainable and innovatively designed, with a comparable lifespan to bricks and ​mortar structures. Norwood Secondary College is benefitting from the Permanent Modular School Buil​dings Program​.​\n\nWe built a new stadium at Norwood Secondary College, including a new competition-grade basket​ball court and additional single court complex.\n\nThe Maroondah Education Plan includes the stadium for Norwood Secondary College, a performing arts centre for Mullum Primary School, a redevelopment for Ringwood Secondary College, and consolidation of Melba College's two campuses onto one site.​"
