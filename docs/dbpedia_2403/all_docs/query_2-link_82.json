        "text": "The things I liked about Ringwood Public Schools are that they have wonderful teachers. Teachers that help out when your stuck on problems, coaches are very pleasant with their students also coaches teach their students the right positions of each sports games so for the future they could be great players and can play for college if they wanted too. Every one at Ringwood schools is polite to each other. Some things that I have experience is that not only I have learned from the books, I also have learned about the life that is out there and the road ahead of me. From an inexperience junior and now a cheerful senior, a lot of things have change for me. Soon I will leave high school as a intelligent senior. I don't know what the world out there holds for me, but all I can do is enter it with an open mind and hope for the best"
