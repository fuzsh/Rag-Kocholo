        "text": "CRITICISM of your work as an adult is hard to bear, especially if it comes from a bunch of kids. But teachers at Ringwood Secondary College have learnt to live with it.\n\nWhen 17-year-old Mitchell Roberts found himself in a class where the teacher focused his attention on only a few students, while the rest struggled to understand the concepts being taught, he knew what to do.\n\nHe raised his concerns in the student feedback survey that teachers at Ringwood, in Melbourne's outer east, hand out to their classes to determine how they can improve their tuition skills.\n\n''After I mentioned that in the survey we noticed a drastic change,'' Mitchell says. ''The teacher spent more time moving around the class making sure everybody knew what they were supposed to be doing.''\n\nUnlike Ringwood, most schools have been slow to embrace the use of student feedback surveys, a performance appraisal tool commonly used by lecturers in universities for the past 10 years.\n\n''There's been a long-standing reluctance in teaching to actually listen to students,'' says Professor Stephen Dinham of Melbourne University, who runs training seminars for teachers across Australia. ''Teachers today increasingly engage in collaborative discussion and feedback with colleagues but feedback from students about an individual teacher is still considered off-limits in many cases.''\n\nHe says the rise of social media forums such as the Rate my Teacher website and Facebook, where school teachers have been denigrated or harassed, also hasn't helped break down the profession's traditional wariness about seeking student views on a teacher's skills.\n\nRate My Teacher is a US-based website where anonymous contributors name a teacher and post comments about them. Comments tend to be of the unhelpful variety - ''He's awesome'' or ''He's a loser''. Critics complain the site's data can be easily manipulated by malicious users and is therefore unreliable. The site's US owners claim 60 per cent of comments praise teachers and it fills a vacuum because most schools don't bother to ask pupils what works best in class.\n\nStudent surveys have been part of the Victorian school landscape since 2005, when the former Labor government introduced a performance and development initiative into all schools.\n\nUnder the reforms, schools were expected to choose multiple methods of assessment - student results, peer observation, peer feedback, student feedback, parent feedback, attendance data and student exit surveys - to provide feedback to improve classroom teaching.\n\nHowever, a Grattan Institute report on teacher appraisal and feedback released earlier this year found schools used the assessment methods inconsistently. Some schools were using student surveys to identify good and less effective classroom teaching but the practice was not widespread.\n\nThe report also found teacher appraisal systems across Australia smacked of tokenism. Sixty-three per cent of Australian teachers say appraisal of their work is mainly done to fulfil administrative requirements and has scant impact on the way they teach.\n\nDespite this, the report says there is ample education research showing that students know good teaching when they see it. ''Student ratings of teachers have been found to be better predictors of student achievement than teacher self-assessments and principal assessments of effectiveness,'' says Dr Ben Jensen, the report's author.\n\nOther studies reveal student opinion tends to be a reliable source of information for teachers wanting to improve their classroom practice. A 2005 Cambridge University study found British teachers who used feedback from their students felt that many of their pupils' ideas were sensible and practical.\n\nLast year results were released from a $US45 million research project on teacher effectiveness, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world's largest philanthropic organisations. Thousands of school students across America were asked to fill out confidential questionnaires about their classroom's learning environment.\n\nTeachers whose students described them as skilful at maintaining classroom order, explaining each topic in several ways and helping pupils learn from their mistakes, tend to be the same teachers whose students learn the most during the year, as measured by gains on standardised test scores, according to a report in The New York Times. Most of America's 15,000 public school districts do not systematically question students about their teachers' skills.\n\nVicki Phillips, an education director at the Gates Foundation, said one of the study's notable findings was that teachers who drill their students to prepare for standardised tests tend to have lower value-added learning gains than teachers who work their way methodically through the key concepts of literacy and maths.\n\nThe steady stream of evidence revealing the merits of student feedback is starting to change the attitudes of Australian teachers, according to Professor Dinham, Melbourne Graduate School of Education's director of learning and teaching. But he says the Grattan report findings shows how easily student feedback can be rendered meaningless if it is merely used as part of an annual performance review. Students are also unlikely to take it seriously if it is not part of an on-going dialogue between staff and students, using one-to-one discussions, surveys and focus groups.\n\n''There's a danger these things can end up being bureaucratic if they're just another hurdle in an annual appraisal,'' Professor Dinham says. ''Teachers need to be given time and professional learning to seek and use feedback, otherwise the day-to-day hurly burly of their workload takes over.''\n\nTeachers at Ringwood Secondary College have used student feedback surveys for three years. Questions on the confidential surveys ask students whether they agree with statements such as ''My teacher can break difficult concepts into simpler ideas'' and ''My teacher is always organised and well prepared''.\n\nTeachers hand out the surveys to their classes, collect the results and use them to improve their tuition. They also share the findings with colleagues on their performance and development team, a group that uses a variety of student data to improve teacher practices.\n\nPrincipal Michael Phillips says a few other schools in the regional network of 21 nearby schools are starting to use student feedback surveys. ''One of the things we've found over three years is that teachers sharing practices and being prepared to talk about their approaches in the classroom has built more trust at a professional level.\n\n''The student survey has been widely accepted by staff. It's not used as a popularity contest or a promotional tool. It's an improvement tool - there's a level of ownership among teachers about what they need to focus on.''\n\nCommon themes to emerge from the surveys include students wanting teachers to be clearer about their expectations of work standards and to use more online reference material rather than textbooks.\n\nMarjan Maani, a VCE English teacher and year 9 co-ordinator, says the year 9 program has been altered to include more hands-on learning activities based on suggestions from the surveys.\n\nIn her year 11 class, survey feedback has prompted her to set a personal goal: to spend more time with each student discussing ideas about the process of the writing task before students submit their final draft. ''The surveys have also been good in getting the kids to take responsibility for their learning,'' Mrs Maani says. ''They feel valued in knowing they can express themselves and have their voices heard.''\n\nAll students fill out the survey anonymously. Most pupils treat the process seriously and have noticed teachers responding to their ideas, according to year 11 student Katie Webber.\n\nIn one of the surveys she and fellow students described how their teacher relied too heavily on one teaching technique - asking questions based on reading from a textbook. Students suggested more class discussions. ''Our teacher started doing that and the class became more involved: more students were contributing to class and were more interested in learning.''"
