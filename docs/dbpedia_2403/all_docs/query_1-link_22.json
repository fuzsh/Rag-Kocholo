        "text": "St Mary’s College for the deaf welcomes deaf and hard of hearing students from Prep to Year 12. Our College offers an inclusive and integrated education and warmly welcomes students of all nationalities and faiths into any of our 6 campuses.\n\nDeaf Education in Bendigo formally began in 1951 with Deaf students attending McDonald House School for Deaf Children. By the end of 1989, McDonald House had officially closed and students integrated into mainstream schools; these being Kennington Primary School, Golden Square Secondary College (now Bendigo South East College) and Bendigo Senior Secondary College.\n\nCharles La Trobe College is a Government P-12 college located in Melbourne’s northern suburbs. The school sits within beautiful, spacious grounds adjacent to La Trobe University. The contemporary design of our school buildings provide our students with access to bright modern classrooms, open learning spaces, studios and smaller tutorial spaces for personalised support.\n\nSt Mary’s College for the deaf welcomes deaf and hard of hearing students from Prep to Year 12. Our College offers an inclusive and integrated education and warmly welcomes students of all nationalities and faiths into any of our 6 campuses.\n\nThe MLC Deaf Integration Program commenced in 1986. It grew from a visionary idea that, given the right planning and support, deaf or hard of hearing students could learn alongside hearing students in a school that promoted achievement for all and celebrated individual differences. This unique program caters for both signing and oral deaf students from Prep to Year 12, to assist them to reach their full potential.\n\nThe Deaf Education Centre opened at Mount Erin College in 1998. SInce then we have worked with Deaf/Hard of Hearing students to expand their horizons and outcomes. We support students in both VCE and VCAL, enabling their successful completion and opening up a wide range of future pathways for our students. We look forward to celebrating our 25th anniversary in 2023 and welcoming you to our centre.\n\nSt Mary’s College for the deaf welcomes deaf and hard of hearing students from Prep to Year 12.
