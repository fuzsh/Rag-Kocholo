        "text": "Indie School is a registered and accredited non-government school providing an alternative education for young people aged 15-18.\n\nThe greatest difference between Indie School and many other alternative education settings is that our foundations lay in Adult Education philosophies. Choice, independence, mutual respect, accountability all have a significant role to play.\n\nIndie School teachers are committed to changing the lives of young people.\n\nStudents enjoy learning in an environment that is fun, secure and provides pathways to employment or further education.\n\nSmaller class sizes allow students greater opportunity to identify their strengths and work to improve areas in which they lack confidence.\n\nIndie School provides students the opportunity to learn in a supportive environment that uses individualised learning plans tailored to each students own education/life circumstances. In return for higher levels of self responsibility, the students can enjoy some greater freedoms."
