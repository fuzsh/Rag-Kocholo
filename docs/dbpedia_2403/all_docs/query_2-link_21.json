        "text": "MELBOURNE'S spate of school closures is putting neighbouring schools under pressure as hundreds of displaced students are forced to find alternatives.\n\nRingwood Secondary College will be 100 students over its enrolment cap next year after picking up students from Parkwood Secondary College and Christadelphian Heritage College.\n\nAnd Doreen and Mernda residents want the state government to build a new high school by 2016, after the collapse of Acacia College, which had 520 students in prep to year 9.\n\nThey say the closure has left Acacia College students in years 7, 8 and 9 without a secondary option in Mernda next year.\n\nRingwood Secondary College principal Michael Phillips has asked the Education Department for another portable classroom. ''Obviously closures put pressure on numbers at places like Ringwood, where we are already at capacity.''\n\nHe said most of the 250 students from Parkwood Secondary, which will close at the end of the year, would go to one of five state schools in Melbourne's east known as the Maroondah Education Coalition.\n\nBut to Mr Phillips' frustration, the schools have not seen a cent of the $100 million redevelopment promised by the former state government.\n\n''As it stands, some students are in 50-year-old temporary portables,'' Mr Phillips said.\n\n''As a lead principal in the Maroondah Education Coalition since day one, there will clearly come a time when I have to say enough is enough. There is a limit to how many times you can stand in front of parents, teachers and students to promise them something and then have to make excuses … for the lack of government action.''\n\nIn 2010 former education minister Bronwyn Pike said a $100 million regeneration project aimed at reversing the brain drain to private schools would go ahead if Labor was re-elected.\n\nNorwood and Parkwood secondary colleges and Croydon and Maroondah secondary colleges were to merge. Each of the five schools, which also included Heathmont College, Ringwood Secondary College and Croydon Community School, would specialise in fields such as technology, football and sustainability.\n\nThe project was not funded, however, when Labor lost. Norwood pulled out of the merger, saying the uncertainty would have been damaging for the school. A year later, Parkwood said it was closing.\n\nAlthough the merger between Maroondah and Croydon has gone ahead, with the new school to be known as Melba Secondary College from next year, state-of-the-art facilities never eventuated.\n\n''We just can't continue to be on the never-never plan,'' Mr Phillips said.\n\n''We've done all the hard yards … and it's incredibly frustrating that five years down the track nothing concrete has actually occurred.''\n\nA spokesman for Education Minister Martin Dixon said capital works funding was considered during the budget process.\n\n''While the government is not able to fund all schools in every budget, it recognises there are significant funding needs and is working towards the goal of upgrading schools across the state.''\n\nMeanwhile, the Doreen and Mernda Secondary School Alliance wants the government to immediately start building a high school in the 3754 postcode area. ''Based on the 2011 census results for Doreen, Mernda and Yarrambat, there will be 1816 children of secondary age by 2015,'' said spokeswoman Lisa Muldoon.\n\n''With [the] sale of Acacia College to Gilson College, the opportunity for the state government to purchase the site for a state secondary college has evaporated.''"
