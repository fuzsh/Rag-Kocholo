        "text": "$1.6 million slam dunk for new basketball stadium at Norwood Secondary College\n\n01 June 2016\n\nMichael Sukkar, Liberal Member for Deakin, visited Norwood Secondary College today to announce that a re-elected Turnbull Liberal Team will invest $1.6 million into building a new indoor basketball stadium at the school.\n\nThe new indoor basketball stadium will deliver two competition sized courts, new change rooms and spectator seating – it will also provide multipurpose meeting and learning spaces for the school and basketball clubs.\n\nSpeaking in front of representatives of the school, local basketball clubs, students and parents, Michael said that federal funding was urgently needed to secure the future viability of the project after the school had been left stranded by the Andrews Labor Government.\n\n“The former Napthine Coalition Government had earmarked $7.5 million to build the new gymnasium at Norwood Secondary College, but Labor slashed funding for this project to the bare bones,” Michael said.\n\nThe additional $1.6 million in federal funding will enable a new partnership between Norwood Secondary College and the Ringwood Hawks Basketball Association.\n\n“The school came to me concerned that their new stadium was just going to be a tin shed with a few rings at either end of a court unless they could secure funding from other sources.\n\n“I began conversations with the Ringwood Hawks Basketball Association to see if they would get involved in the project, and without hesitation they agreed.\n\n“This project has truly become a triumph of the local Ringwood community, coming together to deliver real outcomes,” Michael said.\n\nAndrew Sloane, Principal, Norwood Secondary College, said that this funding will support the largest sporting association in Maroondah to access a facility that provides for all levels of competition and training from junior through to ‘Big V’.\n\n“These funds will contribute towards providing a facility that meets the needs of both the Ringwood Hawks Basketball Association and Norwood Secondary College,” Mr Sloane said.\n\n“For the first time in the College’s fifty-eight year history, whole school assemblies will also be able to be held in the one place.”\n\nTim Mottin, President, Ringwood Hawks Basketball Association, said the funding will enable the association to continue to provide and expand upon the sporting programs for the children, youth and adults of Maroondah.\n\n“Each year our Association has had to deny over 160 children the opportunity to play Basketball. This funding to deliver the new facility will provide these young children and youth of our community a program to become involved in, where they not only learn basketball, but important life skills.”"
