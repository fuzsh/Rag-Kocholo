        "text": "I have been attending Ringwood my whole life except for 2nd and 3rd grade. I would say that athletics are a good experience here and recently Ringwood has picked up new coaches making the situation better. Academics probably aren't the most prestigious around but are good. The high school teachers are good, but the elementary isn't great. Administration here has gotten better throughout my time and is definitely respectable. Overall Ringwood is a good place in my opinion.\n\nRingwood Public Schools is a small school. At small schools students are able to be in multiple activities at once. It gives students every opportunity to find what they enjoy and stick with it or drop it. Another good thing about small schools is that the students and the teachers are able to have one on one conversations and get the help they need.\n\nRingwood is a small community. Its a nice community, its very friendly and everyone usually knows everyone. The school is friendly and its small so you get to know everyone. The classes aren't very big, I think the biggest class I have with people is twenty. Teachers are nice and help you with anything you need. The administration is good and will help you also. Our superintendent is very kind, he has help us with some scholarships."
