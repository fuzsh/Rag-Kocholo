        "text": "Schools across Australia face a common challenge.\n\nMost are arranged in a traditional campus arrangement of disconnected, inflexible, internalised spaces.\n\nBut what’s needed today is an adaptable, coherent, learner-centred environment that prioritises student agency and strengthens community connections.\n\nSo since 2015, Ringwood Secondary College, a single-campus school of more than 1,600 students in Melbourne’s outer east, has been working closely with ClarkeHopkinsClarke Architects to masterplan and deliver transformative facilities, in stages over time.\n\nThe gradual pace allows time for new approaches to learning and connecting with the local community to be tested, embraced, and sustained.\n\nBefore his recent retirement, former Principal Michael Phillips explained, “A key challenge of the project is replacing a mish-mash of buildings and relocatable stock with no overall coherence.”\n\nStage 1 established a new architectural language for the College by introducing a purpose-built Junior School Building.\n\nStage 2 augmented that approach with a contemporary split-level learning hub for senior students.\n\nThe students chose an Indigenous name for the building, which was endorsed by the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation.\n\nYanna Mudjirr means stepping stones.\n\nThis reflects a core purpose of learning in the building and relates exceptionally well to transitions and pathways for students.\n\nAt ground level, the Senior School Building features learning spaces separated by sliding glass walls, which can be reconfigured for collaboration or spill out into a versatile central space featuring a kitchenette, study nooks, and tiered seating.\n\nA gallery on the upper level overlooks the central Study Centre and includes a casual break-out area, Media, and ICT rooms.\n\nA bridge on the upper level connects through to Ringwood Training Centre and allows for sharing of facilities.\n\nClarkeHopkinsClarke Architects Education Partner Wayne Stephens says the new facility “introduces a young-adult environment that maximises choice for senior students.\n\nThe site was extremely tight and surrounded by buildings and services,” he says.\n\nDespite that, the design features generous volumes, uplifting spaces, high ESD values, a sense of openness and transparency, clear sightlines, and lots of natural light and ventilation.\n\nOur builders Lloyd Group did an exceptional job with construction.”\n\nProject Architect Karin Allen says the interconnected learning spaces with glazed acoustic panels can open up for co-teaching, out for external learning in shaded outdoor settings, or inwards into the light-filled central core of adaptable shared spaces.\n\n“These can be easily configured for large and small groups, formal and informal learning, collaboration, self-directed learning, presentations, and events,” she says.\n\n“This means there’s flexibility for both explicit instruction and collaborative learning. Detailing like green screens in the media space and a custom ICT fit-out deliver outstanding specialist areas.”\n\nA standout of Yanna Mudjirr is an informal, skylit study space overlooking the central void.\n\nDecorative screening, natural light, flexible bench seating, and endless power points make it a popular place for students to connect or engage in self-directed learning.\n\nAnother highlight is the specialist ICT spaces and facilities, created to an exacting brief.\n\nThese form a new community hub used outside school hours by Ringwood Training.\n\nPreviously, senior students accessed Ringwood Training’s vocational education facilities via a circuitous route.\n\nThe new design introduces an upper-level bridge that links both facilities and literally elevates this important community partnership in the minds of learners and educators.\n\nThe easy two-way flow of students between both facilities enables after-hours use of state-of-the-art ICT facilities by the Ringwood community.\n\nIt allows senior students to move seamlessly between VET and VCE learning.\n\n“ClarkeHopkinsClarke Architects creates learning places where our teachers and students increasingly feel part of a community of learners,” said former principal Michael Phillips.\n\n“Learning transitions from junior to senior school are no longer a theoretical construct. Teachers and students now operate beyond the static, outdated one-space and one-teacher models. We continue to go deeper, open the classroom doors, and look forward to future possibilities enhanced by a fit-for-purpose built environment.”\n\nProject Awards\n\n2021 LEA Vic Chapter People’s Choice Award.\n\n2022 Learning Environments Australasia Award for Best New Individual Facility under $8M.\n\nProject Team\n\nArchitecture\n\nClarkeHopkinsClarke\n\nThe three founders of ClarkeHopkinsClarke are RMIT Architecture graduates Jack Clarke, David Hopkins, and Les Clarke.\n\nChalk and cheese and unlikely friends, but true believers in the power of architecture to connect people and communities, fulfill needs, and enrich lives.\n\nwww.chc.com.au\n\nPhotography\n\nRhiannon Slatter\n\nRhiannon is well-established Melbourne-based fine art and architecture/interior photographer.\n\nwww.rhiannonslatter.com.au\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nClick on a thumbnail image to enlarge it.\n\nDesign © 2022 ClarkeHopkinsClarke.
