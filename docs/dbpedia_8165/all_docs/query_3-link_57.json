        "text": "08/18/17\n\nThis year is going by way too fast. I've been busy and that's great! Spent some quality time in Florida in the winter with my family, sister, daughter, cousins, friends and lots of golf. Got back home and was asked to go right back for a film in Orlando, \" My Little Baby \". Filmed it on my birthday. How cool is that? Doing what you love on your birthday! I went to LA after to see my son and some friends and have a few meetings then, Wham! I was off to Toronto to film \" The Neighborhood \", opening today, with a fantastic cast and terrific director, Frank D'Angelo. I went back for the premiere in Toronto and had a blast! Last month I had the pleasure to return to Stuttgart, Germany for the ComicCon there. I hadn't been there since touring with the USA Theatre group performing at the America Houses there back in the '70's. Had some great flashbacks! I'll be going to the ComicCon in Colorado Springs next week and I'll be able to spend some time with my brother, whom I'm very proud of and, to me, a true American hero. Later this year I'll be in Providence,RI and Boston,MA. Hopefuly I'll have time to swing down to CT to my home town and see some friends and my sister. I will give you an update. If you get a chance in any of these areas, drop by and say hello. Until then. Later.\n\n12/16\n\nWell, here I am again being way too unconcious. Sorry, guys. Anyway, lots has happened since I last updated. As you can see from my home page, I have changed representation. I'm looking forward to working with Alan Somers, my new manager, and Peter Young and everyone else at The Sovereign Agency. We had great meetings when I was in LA a few weeks back. \" Uncle John \" is doing great and I'm looking for some new material that will be as good. I know that's a stretch, but you gotta keep your sights high and your hopes up. I had a misfortune at the ComicCon in London. Out of nowhere, my retina was detached in my left eye, and I had emergency surgery there. Everything is fine now, but it totally ruined my plans to play the Olde Course at St. Andrews, Scotland. I still went there, because I could not fly home, but it was frustrating WATCHING instead of PLAYING!! I still made the best of it, and met some fine folks there. Outstanding Fish and Chips too! Looking forward to the New Year and working with my new team. Hope you all have a good one too, and enjoy the Holidays. I will definately try to update more often. Stay safe, healthy, and have fun!!\n\n8/19/15\n\nHi guys! Shame on me again for not updading. \"Uncle John\" has now been picked up and being released September 18!! Yea! I will be at the the Breckinridge,CO FF that weekend, and looking forward to meeting some creative and exciting film makers. I didn't mention all the wonderful people I met after Madison in Orlando,FL, Michigan, and my home state of CT in Greenwich at their festivals. Gracious, kind, people, all. Thank you for your generosity, hospitality, and and love of the art!\n\n4/8/15\n\nWell, gang, I'm off to Madison,WI for the Wisconsin Film Festival! SXSW was amazing, and \"Uncle John\" was one of the top 10 finalists! Pretty awesome! Not only got to see my buds from the film, but got to spend some quality time with my son and daughter. We had a blast!! Looking forward to Madison this weekend, since we shot part of \"Uncle John\" in Lodi, about 30 miles north. I hope to see some of the townfolk at the screening, since they were so helpful and courteous during our filming. Thanks again to Lodi. Giving a speech Monday at the University. Always enjoy intermingling with some fresh, new talent, and the Q & A is always fun! Then off to Orlando for the Florida Film Festival until the 19th. Should have a great time there, and get to see some relatives also, sister, cousins, etc. More Festivals on the way. I'll let you know! And remember, \"Love the art in yourself, and not yourself in the art\"!\n\n2/17/15\n\nWow!! What a thrill it is to be accepted in the SXSW Festival in Austin, TX. Not only has \"Uncle John\" been accepted, it is 1 of 10 finalists in the competitive narrative category! What an honor! I am so happy and thrilled for all the filmakers involved, whom I have mentioned before. Kudos to all of you. The World Premier will be held there March 16th. Of course I will be there beginning the 12th to enjoy the other festivities as well. Waiting for the word on other festivals as well. All very promising, but too early to mention. Good stuff! Believe me! See you all at SXSW!!\n\n9/11/14\n\nIt's been an interesting month. We've had so much positive feedback on \"Uncle John\" and are diligently pursuing the festival circuit. Received an incredible review from David Lynch after his viewing, and he was even gracious enough to single out my performance. Thank you David. I am so proud of this film and the filmakers and cast, I can't believe that nothing but positive things will come of it. Lots of buzz on the \"Beverly Hills Cop IV\" front, but still nothing definite yet. Will let you know as soon as something happens. Came in third in my Club Championships. Missed first by 2 shots! Dang! Was 2 under after 15 and had a 45 minute rain delay. Went bogey, bogey, double bogey, for a 74. Golf Gods got me. Oh, well. Stay safe and Remember! See you soon.\n\n7/14/14\n\nWell, gang, what can I say. I have been reprimanded by my sister (which I do not take lightly) for not updating my website often enough. My apologies. I have been busy, but no excuses. I will try to be more diligent. As you may have been reading, there is serious talk of doing another \"Beverly Hills Cop\". I think they are serious this time. I would enjoy being in the film (if all the pieces are right) and would love to hear your feedback. On a more immediate subject, \"Uncle John\", which is in my previous post, is finished and I went to the screening in LA a few weeks ago. I'm very proud of this project, and if you would like to see a trailer, go to http://www.unclejohnfilm.com/ and check it out. Let me know your thoughts! Later gang.\n\n9/12/2013\n\nWell, gang, what can I say. Just wrapped on a \"indie\" in Lodi, WI. This was probably one of the most rewarding and creative experiences in all my film career. The two young film makers, Steven Piet ( Director, Writer ) and Erik Crary ( Writer, Producer ) were two of the most talented guys I have worked with in a LONG time. The cast, which included, Ronnie Gene Blevins, Alex Moffat, and Jenna Lyng, were incredible young performers. You will be hearing alot from them, I'm sure. I'm so thankful that we all got the opportunity to work on this project together. All from an email and script sent to me from Erik. The script was so compelling, I jumped at the chance to play the title role of \"Uncle John\". The whole experience was the reason I entered my craft in the beginning. It was about the work and the process. Telling a story about people and the situations in which they find themselves. A real story about real people. Thank you all for keeping my dream alive. As for the locals in Lodi,WI, thank you for your generosity and hospitality. We probably,literally, couldn't have done it without you. There is a Stanislavsky quote that I passed on to everyone when we wrapped, that I live by; \"Love the art in yourself, and not yourself in the art\". Well, you did it, my friends. And to the crew. Ditto. You were awesome. Until later, \"Think Big, Work Hard, Have a Dream, and Make a Difference\".\n\n12/14/16\n\nWell, here I am again being way too unconcious. Sorry, guys. Anyway, lots has happened since I last updated. As you can see from my home page, I have changed representation. I'm looking forward to working with Alan Somers, my new manager, and Peter Young and everyone else at The Sovereign Agency.
