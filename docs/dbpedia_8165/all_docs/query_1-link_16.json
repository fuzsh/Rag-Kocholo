        "text": "The Maritime musical community is coming together to help the family of one of their own.\n\nWell-known Cape Breton guitarist and music teacher Dave McKeough and his wife Donna were killed in a car crash in June in Millville, N.S.\n\nAn all-star lineup of musical talent will take to the stage Friday night at the Membertou Trade and Convention Centre for a benefit for the couple’s three children.\n\nAmong the 21 acts are names like Rita McNeil, Matt Minglewood, Sam Moon, Bruce Guthro and Dave Gunning. It has taken two days of rehearsals for all of the performers to complete their sound checks\n\nCape Breton singer Aselin Debison will be hitting the stage on the eve of her wedding.\n\n“For me, there is absolutely no way that I could not be here,” Debison tells CTV News. “Dave played in my band for over ten years, and he is the man who taught me how to play guitar.”\n\nOver 500 tickets were snapped up two hours after going on sale.\n\nFellow musician and benefit organizer, Fred Lavery, is not surprised by the outpouring of support\n\n“Music is a great healer,” says Lavery. “We are using that tonight to try and honour Dave and Donna and Dave’s musical contribution to our scene in Cape Breton and all over the country, really, because he was such an amazing musician.”\n\nEven bands that couldn’t be there to perform are pitching in. The Barra MacNeils have offered up a private backyard concert for auction and Ashley MacIsaac will also go to a winning bidder’s home to play.\n\n“Tens of thousands of dollars have been donated for both a silent and live auction this evening from everyone; musicians, concert tickets, hotels and restaurants,” says tribute coordinator Phil Dubinsky.\n\nAll the proceeds from the benefit will go to a trust fund for the McKeough children, who range in age from 11 to 20 years old.\n\nWith files from CTV Atlantic's Randy MacDonald"
