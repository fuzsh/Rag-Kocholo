        "text": "Amanda Debison anchors CTV Morning Live.\n\nAmanda grew up in Lower Sackville, N.S. Her love for the Maritimes has kept her in the region through school and work. She earned a Bachelor of Arts with Honours from Dalhousie University before enrolling at the Nova Scotia Community College where she studied broadcast journalism. She was the only student in 10 years to graduate with Honours from the program, with the highest grade average in her class.\n\nAmanda is fluent in both French and English. She was enrolled in French Immersion while in public school and took additional French courses in university.\n\nAmanda comes from a military family and has a passion for meeting people and telling their stories. Amandaâ€™s first job as a journalist was with CHSJ News in Saint John. She worked as both a radio news reporter and anchor. She then moved to Halifax, reporting and anchoring for News 95.7. She came to CTV in 2013, filling many roles behind the scenes, including production assistant and digital reporter, before landing in front of the camera in 2014.\n\nAmanda grew up watching CTV Atlantic and is proud and grateful to be working at a station she admires. Her goal is to tell stories that have an impact and to shine a spotlight on people who make a difference.\n\nWhen Amanda isn't working, she's enjoying family time with her husband and son, training for half-marathons, or playing board games with friends."
