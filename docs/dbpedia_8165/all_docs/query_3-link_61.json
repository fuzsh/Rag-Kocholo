Have you learned how to live with regret? Yeah, I can't get these things in my head 'Cos if I turned out like you I would wish I was dead No thanks, I'd rather sit here and die on this island No thanks, I'd rather sit here and die on this island No thanks, I'd rather sit here and die on this island No thanks, I'd rather sit here and die on this island"
