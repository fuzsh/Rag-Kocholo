        "text": "When she was 3, she would stand on the raised hearth of the fireplace in her parents' modest home in Glace Bay, on Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Island, and dramatically announce, \"Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the one, the only Aselin Debison!\" She would then jump from the tiled hearth, grab whatever was available -- a roll of paper towel, a broom -- and sing into the imaginary microphone.\n\nFast forward to the summer of 2000, when she was in Ottawa, singing at the Canada Day celebrations. Jean Chr√©tien made a point of coming up on stage to congratulate her, gushing: \"You're going to be the next Celine Dion.\"\n\nNow, an international recording deal with a major label is imminent, according to her Halifax-based manager, Brookes Diamond. She has been approached once before. Just before Christmas, a five-CD contract with Warner Classics International, one year in negotiation, fell through at the last minute when the company made unexpected cutbacks in its London operations. Warner executives had seen her perform at the East Coast Music Awards two years ago and had ambitious plans to develop her as a singer of \"Celtic-tinged\" music.\n\nThis year, she is the youngest nominee ever in the East Coast Music Awards. In the category of best pop artist of the year, the winner of which will be announced Feb. 3, she is one of seven nominees. A fellow competitor is Anne Murray.\n\nNow, at 11, the one, the only Aselin Debison is sprawled across the pink bedspread on her double bed, which sits in the middle of her smallish room like a luxuriant island in a sea of pink-and-purple girlishness. It is late-afternoon, dark and cold outside the two-storey house with dark-blue siding situated on a street of similar houses in this wind-swept blue-collar town, in which many people, miners mostly, have lost their jobs.\n\nBut her room is radiant, humming with the joys, the activities, that lovely, pure, protected innocence of childhood. There's a computer, a stack of CDs, a parade of collected porcelain dolls, medals from team sports, a scooter, a dog bed, a dresser top cluttered with little-girl necklaces and hair accessories, a poster board with pasted-on pictures of pop stars -- Christina Aguilera and Destiny's Child -- and teenaged fashion models. Above her desk hangs a poster of a Nova Scotian landscape with words scrawled across it. \"Remember me when you become a big star,\" it reads. It is signed by Bruce Guthro, a veteran songwriter and singer in the province, and her mentor.\n\nSurrounded by stuffed animals and frilled pillows, Aselin -- named after Aslan, the lion in C. S Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, she tells me -- lies on her stomach, in jeans and a fuzzy pink sweater, as she answers questions. She looks up with huge brown eyes, her dark curly hair pulled back in a ponytail.\n\n\"Well, it really started when I was 8,\" she says in an even, matter-of-fact voice. What she means by \"it\" is her career. That was in 1999 when she was asked to sing for thousands of protesting miners in her hometown. \"Miners were losing their jobs,\" she says solemnly. \"One of the miner's wives called to ask if I could sing at the rally in the skating rink.\" It was televised locally. Her performance of The Island, which is considered the Cape Breton anthem, moved many to tears.\n\nFrom that point on, the Legend of Aselin grew.\n\nShe has starred in Global TV's Foster Parents Plan Gala, along with Chantal Kreviasuk. Last April, she travelled to New York to record with Wesley Chu, the eight-year-old piano prodigy who lives in Calgary. At Christmas, she performed for a crowd of 50,000 in Boston for a tree-lighting ceremony. Late last year, with record deals still pending, Brookes Diamond took the initiative to back her first CD, a collection of Christmas songs, entitled, The Littlest Angel. She went on tour to packed auditoriums throughout Nova Scotia.\n\nShe has had no formal music or voice training. Her parents, Donny and Joan, both sing in the local church choir. Music has been a tradition in their families for generations, but they knew nothing about the music business. Donny Debison, who is 44, has worked for a local landscaping company, for the past 15 years. In the winter months, he collects unemployment. Joan Debison, 38, worked as a hairdresser before the birth of her two children. Aselin has a brother, Blake, aged 6.\n\n\"What's happened to Aselin has all just been a natural progression,\" says Joan. Cape Breton communities are close-knit and family-focused, perhaps because there's not much to do outside the home. The Debisons are no exception. Joan enrolled Aselin at the age of 2 in a local private preschool, Learning Leprechauns, because the woman who runs it used to teach her and her sisters Irish jigs when they were young. Every St. Patrick's Day, Aselin would sing with classmates at a concert in nearby Sydney. But no one paid her much attention until the Miner's Rally.\n\nIt was at that point, besieged with requests for their daughter to sing and unsure what to charge or claim as expenses, that the Debisons contacted Diamond. But they are not pushy stage parents. \"It's scary,\" says Donny. \"She's our baby. And we want her to enjoy her childhood.\"\n\n\"When a request comes in, we always ask her first if she wants to do it,\" says Joan. \"In two or three years, we don't want her coming to us and saying, 'What did you do to me?' \" Donny explains.\n\nJoan accompanies her daughter to every performance and helps her choose her \"non-Britney Spears\" outfits. But neither takes any money from Aselin's earnings. She has a savings account and a chequing account that she draws upon to go to McDonald's with her friends, to movies or skiing at the local hill. Sometimes, Aselin offers to buy something for her parents. But they refuse.\n\nFor all their protection of Aselin's childhood, the Debisons are remarkably confident in her ability to fend for herself. While I talked to their daughter in her bedroom, they remained downstairs in the kitchen out of earshot. Perhaps they are sure of the values they have instilled in her. She is poised, mature beyond her years, and unfailingly polite.\n\n\"Some girls were picked for dancing. Some girls were picked for other certain things. I was just one of the girls picked for singing,\" Aselin reports when asked about her involvement with Learning Leprechauns. And what did she feel about all the attention she got at the Miner's Rally? \"It made me feel good,\" she says. \"Once, I was just a little kid who did concerts, but then I was Glace Bay's own Aselin Debison.\"\n\nWas she aware she could sing well? \"Well, my parents and grandparents told me I was a really good singer. At first, I didn't believe them when I was in preschool. But once I started getting calls from people to come sing, I thought, 'Hey, I am a good singer.' \"\n\nShe is not precocious, in case you're wondering. She says this guilelessly, as though she's talking about somebody else. She has been interviewed several times in the local media so there's a sense it's all a bit routine. I had read that Rita MacNeil, who lives in the same area, is one of her role models. So I ask her if this was true. She nods slightly as if she's familiar with the question, takes a little breath and spouts: \"Rita MacNeil is such a great singer with a beautiful voice and she's a very, very nice woman, but I would have to say that my true idol is Bruce Guthro.\"\n\nGuthro first met her at the Foster Parents Plan gala. She asked to meet him and when she came to his dressing room, requested that he sing one of his songs for her. \"Only if you'll sing along with me,\" Guthro told her. She knew his songs, word for word in the same key. \"She has what I would call the magic dust,\" he says. \"It's the appeal of the package -- her talent, her charm, her looks -- that finds its way into your heart.\"\n\nGuthro co-produced The Littlest Angel and plans to help her with another CD this summer, if a recording deal is not signed. Even if she does agree to an international contract, she wants Guthro to help her as a consultant.\n\n\"He encourages me and he helps me,\" Aselin explains. \"And he's fun to be with in the studio. He knows what it's like, so if we try something and I can't get it, we just go outside, shoot a couple of hoops, and come back inside.\" Is there pressure? \"Well, it's more that you need the confidence in order to get it,\" she tells me. She doesn't sing every day, although she likes to download music from the Internet and sing along. At a concert, just before she goes on stage, she may have a drink of water or practise a scale. \"Moments before I go on, I go, like, 'Oh God,' but as soon as I step foot on stage, it's all fine,\" she says.\n\nHer taste in music is varied, from pop to country. She also loves the musical Grease,with Olivia Newton-John. What does she hope for in her career? \"I really hope that I'm going to go as far as I can with my singing, and if I don't make it as far as I want, that will be all right,\" she says. \"But,\" she adds emphatically, \"I want to go to college. I want to be a phys-ed teacher and I want to get a scholarship in basketball.\" And what would her goals be for her singing? \"A couple of CDs. Meet some great people. Maybe a Grammy Award,\" she says.\n\nOnly once during the course of our bedside chat does she reveal that she's more ambitious than she lets on. Her parents have worked hard to keep her grounded, to manage her expectations. Was she upset when the deal with Warner Classics International fell through? \"Not really,\" she says unconvincingly. She looks at me, holds a finger to her lips as though she knows she's not supposed to say anything about it. Was she disappointed or not? \"Well, kind of,\" she says. \" 'Cause I was really looking forward to it. But then again, I just want to be a kid.\"\n\nThe magic in this room, I realize, comes not only from being inside the bubble of happy childhood, but from a sense of promise, and the changes to her life that hover around its edges. She doesn't know what it all means. Nor do her parents. Standing by the side of my car in the darkness to wave me off, Donny displays more apprehension than excitement as he says: \"There are so many things we have to think about if she becomes a big star.\"\n\nIn the hardscrabble life of a once-booming coal-mining town, Aselin is a rare find, a diamond no one was looking for. She may represent riches, but what her family seems to be most concerned about is the scrutiny it will bring, and the changes to the small, tight world of their family, which is all they ever really wanted."
