        "text": "Overview\n\nOver the past twenty years I have promoted the importance that Cape Breton played as the industrial heartland of eastern Canada, as the foremost bastion for the defense of Canada's Atlantic frontier, and I have highlighted the efforts of the Merchant Navy that sustained the Allied cause during both WWI and WWII.\n\nThe Sydney Harbour Fortifications played an important role in guarding the harbour during some of Canada’s darkest moments, and after decades of neglect that lead to structural decay and serious safety hazards, I decided to launch the Sydney Harbour Fortifications Restoration Project to preserve the remnants of a once formidable defence system.\n\nThe following is a personal account of one of the greatest challenges of my life. Many years ago, I united many dedicated grass-roots organizations, Parliamentarians, Members of the Nova Scotia Legislature, the Town of Sydney Mines, and more, to fight the good fight and preserve a vital part of our forgotten history, culture, and way of life.\n\nThroughout the ‘Project Origin-the Passionâthe Inspiration’ sections, I tell the story of how the projects were assembled, planned, and organized. I also acknowledge the names of the many that inspired me, and that helped make this initiative a reality. Without their support and positive influence, none of these initiatives would have come to fruition.\n\nTo the late Ronnie Keough and Harry Boardmore, I am eternally grateful for everything that you did for me. I thank you both for believing in me, and giving me the opportunity to play the lead role of Romeo alongside Lisa Decker, Bette MacDonald, and many others, in the play Romeo and Juliet that took place at the Boardmore Playhouse, University of Cape Breton, Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada, and for your other many acts of kindness. I will never forget you.\n\nThe Island song has always inspired me.Â On this site, I dedicate it to their indomitable spirit, and for the perseverance it forged in me.\n\nThe Island\n\n(Official Song of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada) â (Lyrics)\n\nOver an ocean and over a sea\n\nBeyond these great waters, oh, what do I see\n\nI see the great mountains which climb from the coastline\n\nThe hills of Cape Breton, this new home of mine\n\nOh, we come from the countries all over the world\n\nTo hack at the forests, to plow the lands down\n\nFishermen, farmers and sailors all come\n\nTo clear for the future this pioneer ground\n\nWe are an island, a rock in a stream\n\nWe are a people as proud as there's been\n\nIn soft summer breeze or in wild winter wind\n\nThe home of our hearts, Cape Breton\n\nOver the rooftops and over the trees\n\nWithin these new townships, oh, what do I see\n\nI see the black pitheads; the coal wheels are turning\n\nThe smoke stacks are belching and the blast furnace burning\n\nAnd the sweat on the back is no joy to behold\n\nIn the heat of the steel plant or mining the coal\n\nAnd the foreign-owned companies force us to fight\n\nFor our survival and for our rights\n\nWe are an island, a rock in a stream\n\nWe are a people as proud as there's been\n\nIn soft summer breeze or in wild winter wind\n\nThe home of our hearts, Cape Breton\n\nOver the highways and over the roads\n\nOver the Causeway stories are told\n\nThey tell of the coming and the going away\n\nThe cities of America draw me away\n\nAnd though companies come and though companies go\n\nAnd the ways of the world we may never know\n\nWe'll follow the footsteps of those on their way\n\nAnd still ask for the right to leave or to stay\n\nWe are an island, a rock in a stream\n\nWe are a people as proud as there's been\n\nIn soft summer breeze or in wild winter wind\n\nThe home of our hearts, Cape Breton\n\nThe Beginning Dr. Brian Tennyson and Stéphane Ouellette (1988)\n\nThe passion began when I was a resident of Cape Breton Island. One cloudy October day in 1988, Dr. Brian Tennyson (historian/author), and I were driving along a road in New Victoria, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada, and I noticed an odd looking concrete structure (that later would turn out to be Fort Petrie). I asked Dr. Tennyson what it was, and he stated that this was part of a network of WWII fortifications that were now sitting in ruins. We also found out, shortly thereafter, that Fort Petrie was scheduled to be demolished.\n\nIt is at this time, at the age of 19, that I suddenly became intrigued by the history-rich environment that permeated this magical land. My attention was now focused on the crumbling WWII fortifications surrounding Sydney Harbour. I strongly believed that these sites needed to be saved to preserve this unique and important aspect of Cape Bretons heritage and culture. The possibility of creating jobs and generating spin-off revenues for the local economy, were also very important considerations.\n\nPlease select Dr. Tennysons Acknowledgements in his book (published in 2000) Guardian of the Gulf: Sydney Cape Breton and the Atlantic Wars (also co-authored by Dr. Roger Sarty).\n\nPlease select CBC News Coverage (1988) to view the video clip.\n\nThe song below moved me greatly at this time. The lyrics are as follows:\n\nThe Green Fields of France by the Fureys\n\nOh how do you do, young Willy McBride\n\nDo you mind if I sit here down beside your graveside\n\nAnd rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun\n\nI've been walking all day, and I'm nearly done\n\nAnd I see by your gravestone you were only nineteen\n\nWhen you joined the great fallen in 1916\n\nWell I hope you died quick\n\nAnd I hope you died clean\n\nOh Willy McBride, was is it slow and obscene\n\nDid they beat the drums slowly?\n\nDid they play the fife lowly?\n\nDid they sound the death march as they lowered you down?\n\nDid the band play the Last Post in chorus?\n\nDid the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest?\n\nAnd did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind\n\nIn some loyal heart is your memory enshrined\n\nAnd though you died back in 1916\n\nTo that loyal heart you're forever nineteen\n\nOr are you a stranger without even a name\n\nForever enshrined behind some old glass pane\n\nIn an old photograph torn, tattered, and stained\n\nAnd faded to yellow in a brown leather frame\n\nDid they beat the drums slowly?\n\nDid they play the fife lowly?\n\nDid they sound the death march as they lowered you down?\n\nDid the band play the Last Post in chorus?\n\nDid the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest?\n\nThe sun shining down on these green fields of France\n\nThe warm wind blows gently and the red poppies dance\n\nThe trenches have vanished long under the plow\n\nNo gas, no barbed wire, no guns firing now\n\nBut here in this graveyard that's still no man's land\n\nThe countless white crosses in mute witness stand\n\nTo man's blind indifference to his fellow man\n\nAnd a whole generation were butchered and damned\n\nDid they beat the drums slowly?\n\nDid they play the fife lowly?\n\nDid they sound the death march as they lowered you down?\n\nDid the band play the Last Post in chorus?\n\nDid the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest?\n\nAnd I can't help but wonder oh Willy McBride\n\nDo all those who lie here know why they died?\n\nDid you really believe them when they told you the cause?\n\nDid you really believe that this war would end wars?\n\nWell the suffering, the sorrow, the glory, the shame\n\nThe killing and dying it was all done in vain\n\nOh Willy McBride it all happened again\n\nAnd again, and again, and again, and again\n\nDid they beat the drums slowly?\n\nDid they play the fife lowly?\n\nDid they sound the death march as they lowered you down?\n\nDid the band play the Last Post in chorus?\n\nDid the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest?\n\nFighting for the Preservation of Cape Breton Island's Heritage and Culture â Mr. Dwayne Dalton, Dr. Robert Morgan, and Dr. Kenneth Donovan (1988-1990)\n\nWith the imminent destruction of Fort Petrie, I quickly devised a plan to prevent its demolition. Little did I know of the sheer magnitude this project would become, and the tumultuous times that lay ahead. We had to avoid another Moxham Castle catastrophe.\n\nOne brisk windy afternoon, my very dear friend, and Cape Breton resident, Dwayne Dalton and I went to explore these abandoned relics. We visited the Fort Petrie site, and climbed down the old air shaft into the musty underground, and eagerly explored the gun magazine. We both felt that we were explorers like young Indiana Jones.\n\nWe then descended the cliffs to examine one of the collapsed search light emplacements. This was during the month of December, and without paying attention, I fell full force on the back of my head. I loss semi-consciousness, and Dwayne immediately came to my assistance. I was quickly taken to the hospital and received a few minor stitches. I still have the scare to this very day, and I still remember the time I bleed on the shores of Fort Petrie.\n\nLater that month, we visited the Beaton Institute at the University of Cape Breton where Dwayne and I conducted the initial research, and met a wonderful man by the name of Dr. Robert Morgan.\n\nThe late Dr. Robert Morgan contributed significantly to my cause. He was a visionary that inspired me to persevere in this fight. Here is a reference letter he provided to me in 1990.\n\nAnother great influence in this project was Dr. Kenneth Donovan. Among many things, Dr. Donovan and I co-authored an article published in the Cape Breton Post entitled: Destroying Fort Petrie and South Bar Another Moxham Castle, on August 4, 1990.\n\nI have always maintained a loyalty to Cape Breton Island by ensuring that I would promote Her at every opportunity afforded to me. In this instance, I included part of the lyrics (below) in a presentation I made before to the Senate Sub-Committee on Veterans Affairs, of the Standing Senate Committee on National Security and Defence.\n\nPlease select Second Session Thirty-ninth Parliament, 2007-08, SENATE OF CANADA, and scroll to page 4-8, to view the presentation.\n\nWe Rise Again - Rankin Family (Lyrics)\n\nWhen the waves roll on over the waters\n\nAnd the ocean cries\n\nWe look to our sons and daughters\n\nTo explain our lives\n\nAs if a child could tell us why\n\nThat as sure as the sunrise\n\nAs sure as the sea\n\nAs sure as the wind in the trees\n\nWe rise again in the faces\n\nof our children\n\nWe rise again in the voices of our song\n\nWe rise again in the waves out on the ocean\n\nAnd then we rise again\n\nWhen the light goes dark with the forces of creation\n\nAcross a stormy sky\n\nWe look to reincarnation to explain our lives\n\nAs if a child could tell us why\n\nThat as sure as the sunrise\n\nAs sure as the sea\n\nAs sure as the wind in the trees\n\nWe rise again in the faces\n\nof our children\n\nWe rise again in the voices of our song\n\nWe rise again in the waves out on the ocean\n\nAnd then we rise again\n\nWe rise again in the faces\n\nof our children\n\nWe rise again in the voices of our song\n\nWe rise again in the waves out on the ocean\n\nAnd then we rise\n\nVetoing Demolition of Fort Petrie (Phase I) â The Old Sydney Society and Dan White and Associates (1988)\n\nDr. Brian Tennyson and I approached the Old Sydney Society to provide us with the assistance needed to preventing the demolition of an historic site, in favour of its preservation and restoration.\n\nWith their kindness in accepting our request, the Old Sydney Society guided us in developing a proposal that was submitted to the Cape Breton Development Corporation.\n\n(Cover of the feasibility study carried out by Dan White and Associates â November 1988)\n\nThis incited the need for a feasibility study. The County of Cape Breton put the demolition on hold. The contract was given to Dan White and Associates. It concluded, based on various factors, that Chapel Point was the site most suited for restoration.\n\nHenceforth, the Chapel Point Society was soon to be incorporated.\n\nMedia Coverage (1988)\n\nPlease select news articles below for additional story details.\n\nSUBJECT/TITLE DATE MEDIA SOURCE AUTHOR Historical Group Halts Demolition: Old Sydney Society wanted assessment 21/09/1988 Cape Breton Post Ron Stang Monument or Eyesore 23/09/1988 Chronicle-Herald Unknown Demolition delayed as study undertaken 24/10/1988 Cape Breton Post Ken MacLeod Battle of Fort Petrie already lost - Sydney Mines fort may be named historical site 17/12/1988 Cape Breton Post Ron Stang\n\nAs the fighting began, the following song was an inspiration.\n\nThe lyrics are as follows:\n\nFight the Good Fight â Triumph\n\nThe days grow shorter and the nights are getting long\n\nFeels like we're running out of time\n\nEvery day it seems much harder tellin' right from wrong\n\nYou got to read between the lines\n\nDon't get discouraged, don't be afraid, we can\n\nMake it through another day\n\nMake it worth the price we pay\n\nThe Good Book says it's better to give than to receive\n\nI do my best to do my part\n\nNothin' in my pockets I got nothin' up my sleeve\n\nI keep my magic in my heart\n\nKeep up your spirit, keep up your faith, baby\n\nI am counting on you\n\nYou know what you've got to do\n\nCHORUS:\n\nFight the good fight every moment\n\nEvery minute every day\n\nFight the good fight every moment\n\nIt's your only way\n\nAll your life you've been waiting for your chance\n\nWhere you'll fit into the plan\n\nBut you're the master of your own destiny\n\nSo give and take the best that you can\n\nYou think that a little more money can buy your soul some rest\n\nYou better think something else instead\n\nYou're so afraid of being honest with yourself\n\nYou'd better take a look inside your head\n\nNothing is easy, nothing good is free\n\nBut I can tell you where to start\n\nTake a look inside your heart\n\nThere's an answer in your heart\n\nCHORUS (CORRECTED AGAIN ON NOV. 11, 2010)\n\nFight the good fight every moment\n\nEvery minute every day\n\nFight the good fight every moment\n\nMake it worth the price we pay\n\nEvery moment of your lifetime\n\nEvery minute every day\n\nFight the good fight every moment\n\nMake it worth the price we pay\n\nYeah\n\nVetoing Demolition of Fort Petrie (Phase II) The Creation of the Sydney Harbour Fortifications Society (1988-1990)\n\nAs the battle for the South Side Forts was mounting, the Town of Sydney Mines, and the Government of Nova Scotia began to focus on the Chapel Point Battery, as recommended by the Unique Historical Attraction feasibility study conducted by Dan White and Associates.\n\nWhiteâs study indicated that it would have cost approximately $500,000 to fully restore the Chapel Point Battery to its wartime conditions. It was also predicted, on a number of factors, that this heritage site would attract approximately 30,000 people a year, with at least a $1,000,000 in spin-off revenues for the local economy.\n\nAfter a number of considerations, it was decided to incorporate the Chapel Point Military Museum development proposal with that of Lloydâs Cove. The amalgamation of these two initiatives was called: The Sydney Mines Integrated Tourism Development Project.\n\nA number of successful meetings were held between municipal and provincial officials. At the end of 1989, Dr. Tennyson and I organized the The Sydney Mines Integrated Tourism Development Project Conference that was held at the North Star Inn, in North Sydney. The Conference was attended by officials from the Cape Breton Development Corporation, the Nova Scotia Department of Tourism and Culture, the Town of Sydney Mines, the University of Cape Breton (formerly known as the University College of Cape Breton), and more.\n\nIn May 1989, Dr. Tennyson and I invited Dr. Roger Sarty, who at the time was a military historian with the Department of National Defence, to make a presentation to Town officials.\n\nDr. Sarty had done his PhD thesis on the Sydney Harbour Fortifications. It was a delight to receive him. In his presentation, Dr. Sarty drew many important conclusions, historically and otherwise, that was very favourable to restoring the Chapel Point Battery.\n\nWith all the inertia, Dr. Tennyson and I decided, along with our stakeholders, that the Chapel Point property would be purchased for a full scale restoration. The amount for the property was $75,000. Thus, the fundraising process began, and the story continues.\n\nMedia Coverage (1989)\n\nPlease select news articles below for additional story details.\n\nSubject / Title Date Media Source Author Historical Society to Be Revived 27/02/1989 Cape Breton Post Unknown Sydney Mines Historical Society rejuvenated 01/03/1989 North Side Tribune Unknown Revival Meeting - Sydney Mines Historical Society 01/03/1989 North Side Tribune Mel Brown Community Futures broadens it scope 02/03/1989 Cape Breton Post Wes Stewart Review restoration project 14/03/1989 Cape Breton Post Unknown Negotiations for Chapel Point property continuing 22/03/1989 North Side Tribune Ira Balderton Authority on fortifications to speak 08/05/1989 Cape Breton Post Unknown Dr. Roger Sarty guest speaker 25/05/1989 North Side Tribune Unknown Chapel Point Historical Society Formed 31/05/1989 North Side Tribune Unknown War years in Sydney recalled 11/11/1989 Chronicle- Herald Julie Zatzman\n\nVetoing the Demolition of Fort Petrie (Phase III) â The Creation of the Sydney Harbour Fortifications Society, and Obtaining Support from the Department of National Defence, and the Government of Nova Scotia (1990)\n\nWhile progress was making its way for the development of the Chapel Point Battery on the South side of Sydney Harbour, a war was mounting on the North side between the factions that wanted to preserve the forts and those that wanted them demolished.\n\nTo deal with this impending disaster, I directed Dr. Brian Tennyson to assume full presidential responsibilities for operating the day-to-day operations of the Chapel Point Society.\n\nI then turned my attention to Fort Petrie. The County of Cape Breton wanted to proceed with the demolition of Fort Petrie, the South Bar Battery, and the Fire Command Post with the assistance of the local militia to avoid direct costs to the municipality.\n\nFor the militia to proceed, the County needed the approval of the Department of National Defence.\n\nTo counter this situation, I assembled a team of key individuals that would focus on preserving the South side batteries. As a part of a much larger strategic plan, I incorporated the Sydney Harbour Fortifications Society (SHFS) on June 25, 1990. I assumed the Presidency of the organization, and appointed (the now late) Mrs. Patricia Grezel as the SecretaryâTreasurer. She served the organization well, and was very dedicated to the cause.\n\nFrom this moment on-ward, politics became the governing force. Several letters were written to government departments. Petitions were circulated. The fight for its demolition even was debated in the House of Commons in 1990.\n\nHowever, with perseverance, I was able to persuade the Honourable Bill McKnight, Minister of National Defence, to veto demolition of Fort Petrie.\n\nPlease select Minister McKnight’s Letter of Victory for viewing.\n\nIn October 1990, I arranged a successful meeting with Minister Roland Thornhill, Minister, Department of Tourism and Culture, Government of Nova Scotia. I invited Dr. Brian Tennyson and Councilor Murray Johnston, Town of Sydney Mines, to attend.\n\nMy objective was to acquire moneys for both Fort Chapel Point and Fort Petrie. At this point, Minister Thornhill agreed to provide me with “half-the-purchase-price” amounts for each fortress.\n\nPlease select letter of agreement provided by Minister Thornhill for viewing.\n\nWith the demolition veto in place, and with the funding process underway to purchase both Fort Petrie and Chapel Point, the third phase was achieved.\n\nMedia Coverage (1990)\n\nPlease select news articles below for additional story details.\n\nSubject/Title Date Media Source Author Shore batteries should be kept and made into tourist attraction 06/02/1990 Cape Breton Post Gordon Sampson\n\nLetter to the Editor Shoreline forts viewed as tourism potential 09/02/1990 Cape Breton Post Dan MacGillivray Abandonned fortifications around Sydney Harbor deteriorating emblems of Cape Breton's naval role 10/10/1990 Cape Breton Post Brian Tennyson\n\nEditorial Halifax's Forts- Response indicates public's concern 10/10/1990 Chronicle-Herald Lorna Inness Society wins support to town council 06/03/1990 Cape Breton Post Unknown Sydney Mines Town Council holds special meeting 07/03/1990 North Side Tribune Unknown Group tries to shore up crumbling fortifications 12/03/1990 Chronicle-Herald Laura Haas Fort demolition won't be delayed 19/04/1990 Cape Breton Post Doyle MacKinnon Gun batteries may hold tourist potential: MP 03/05/1990 Cape Breton Post Unknown Save Fort Petrie group needs council's help 03/05/1990 Cape Breton Post Unknown 45 year later, memories still strong - Cape Breton prospered while war raged 08/05/1990 Cape Breton Post Noreen March Victory in Europe meant wild celebration at home 08/05/1990 Cape Breton Post Noreen March Forts should be heritage sites 12/05/1990 Cape Breton Post Patricia Grezel\n\nLetter to the Editor Preservation of forts would be progressive 23/05/1990 Cape Breton Post Charlie Musial Shore batteries are important local heritage 01/06/1990 Cape Breton Post Gordon Sampson\n\nLetter to the Editor Dingwall undaunted as council rejects bid to save historic site\n\n26/06/1990 Cape Breton Post Mary E.

Several court injunctions were obtained, and the demolition was finally thwarted.\n\nEventually, Mr. Paul and Mrs. Patricia Grezel (Board Members that I appointed to the Sydney Harbour Fortifications Society) purchased Fort Petrie for approximately $15,000.\n\nThis was a landmark victory that eventually resulted in the development of this nationally recognized military museum located in New Victoria, Cape Breton.\n\nWe finally had a secured site with the Grezelâs purchase of Fort Petrie, and with the $75,000 Dr. Tennyson and I raised, we brokered the purchase of the Chapel Point Battery, with the intent of fully restoring her to WWII condition, as Dan Whiteâs feasibility study had highly recommended.\n\nAnd the saga continued…\n\nMedia Coverage (1991-1992)\n\nPlease select news articles below for additional story details.\n\nSubject/Title Date Media Source Author Restoration of fort would be leap back 24/01/1991 Cape Breton Post C.

It goes as follows:\n\nBroken Heroes\n\nThey came to fight for glory in their thousands\n\nYoung men with their dreams\n\nThey died before the guns for their country\n\nA book of faded pictures, broken dreams\n\nWhere are they now\n\nWhere are they now\n\nWhere are they now\n\nWhere are they now\n\nThe broken heroes\n\nUncle Sam is waiting with the draft card\n\nHe says you've got to fight the Vietcong\n\nThe stations full of flags and rule Britannia\n\nThe engine pulls you out towards the Somme\n\nWhere are they now\n\nWhere are they now\n\nWhere are they now\n\nWhere are they now\n\nThe broken heroes\n\nThe broken heroes\n\nThe broken heroes\n\nThe broken heroes\n\nWhere are they now\n\nWhere are they now\n\nWhere are they now\n\nThe broken heroes\n\nThe pipes are calling young men back to Belfast\n\nThe general says you march to Stalingrad\n\nYou rode into the valley with the hundred\n\nSeven lonely graves on Goose Green\n\nWhere are they now\n\nWhere are they now\n\nWhere are they now\n\nWhere are they now\n\nThe broken heroes\n\nThe broken heroes\n\nThe broken heroes\n\nThe broken heroes\n\nWhere are they now\n\n(Repeat to end)\n\nRead more: Saxon - Broken Heroes Lyrics | MetroLyrics"
