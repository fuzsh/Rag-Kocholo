        "text": "The Ennis Sisters - Red Is the Rose (1997, self published) -- The first album of these three teenage singer/sisters created a big splash throughout Atlantic Canada, understandably -- they're great. They were the 2002 East Coast Music Award (ECMA) Group of the year. This CD has gorgeous harmony singing, exceptionally intelligent arrangements, good songwriting. The sisters sound a lot like Cookie, Heather, and Raylene Rankin -- high praise indeed -- though some feel they are even better! From the first few bars of the first song -- Ron Hynes' brilliant \"No Change in Me\" you know you are in for a treat. The material ranges from Eric Bogle's \"Somewhere in America\" to various traditional English and Irish ballads, plus five of their own songs. If you like The Rankin Family sisters, you'll love the Ennis Sisters.(Very highly recommended).\n\nTheir third CD, The Ennis Sisters 3 (2000) is a fine album of 15 songs. There is only one traditional song, 6 songs written jointly by Maureen Ennis and Mark Murphy, 2 written separately by them, the great Stan Rogers song \"Lies\" and 5 others. The quality of the tunes written by Maureen and Mark are remarkably high, given her young age, particularly the slower love songs. I don't find this album meets the extremely high standard of Red is the Rose, particularly in the more ordinary arrangements. It also takes more listens to appreciate this album. But these sisters have so much talent, this is still a very good album.\n\n( I was not as impressed by their 2001 album, Ennis Sisters which consists entirely of Maureen Ennis/Mark Murphy songs, which is a mistake since the songs are weak and very repetitive.)\n\nGreat Big Sea, known simply as \"GBS\" to their legends of fans, is the ultimate party band. As a friend of mine astutely commented: \"You can't listen to a Great Big Sea album and be unhappy.\" Great Big Sea mixes up traditional Newfoundland songs and shanties, their own songs, lots of acoustic guitars, a fiddle and an occiasional accordion, terrific harmonies and a rock & roll level of energy. It works better than you could ever imagine. Unless you have experienced GBS, it is hard to imagine how much fun this band is (and how deservedly popular this group is in Canada). GBS fans know the lyrics, and all the group has to do is sing the first three words of a song and the crowd will sing all the rest. Nobody works a crowd as well as GBS. GBS has won the ECMA Entertainer of the Year Award several times, and for good reason.\n\nA great introduction to GBS, and my favorite album of theirs is Road Rage (2000, Warner Music Canada) This ultimate party band took their party on the road in late 1999 - a coast-to-coast tour across Canada (and with some visits to the S.F. Bay Area). This a selection of live tracks from that tour. The tour culminated in a New Year's Eve celebration on the waterfront in St. Johns, Newfoundland, with 90,000 fans all singing the songs, captured on the CD! This CD of 19 songs lacks the polish of their studio albums, but there is such an incredible and wonderful energy on this CD, it is a winner. (Very Highly recommended)\n\nThe group also has some excellent studio CDs.Rant and Roar (Sire Records 1998) is an American \"best of early GBS\" CD. The title track \"Rant and Roar\" is not some grunge electric blast a la Ashley MacIsaac, but a lovely traditional tune about sailing into Toslow, Nfld. The band members don't have the greatest voices, but they demonstrate excellent solo and harmony singing, including a wonderful a capella version of the sea shanty \"General Taylor\". This album is big fun. GBS's very fast version of the Scottish tune \"Mari-Mac\" is amazing. You try singing this chorus clearly at very high speed (less than 7 seconds!):\n\n\"Mari-Mac's mother's making Mari-Mac marry me,\n\nMari's mother's making me marry Mari-Mac,\n\nWell, I'm going to marry Mary for that Mary's taking care of me,\n\nWell, I'll be feeling merry when I marry Mari-Mac.\"\n\nGBS' 2d U.S. CD, Turn (1999) is also an excellent CD. The opening song , their own creation, Consequence Free, is an instant classic -- a desire we've all had--great lyrics, catchy tune; this is a song you'll hum or sing along with from the first time you hear it. The rest of the album has less of the over-the-top energy that characterized their debut album, but is again a set of very well crafted songs, half traditional, half originals, all with the same folky feel. Despite their accents, the group does a very creditable version of Trois Navies de Blï¿½, a traditional Newfoundland song in French.. Sea of No Cares (2002) Something Beautiful (2004). GBS, now a trio w/ guests rather than a quartet. This new album is mellower than Road Rage, but still consists of well-crafted, highly \"singable\" songs and some rousing instrumental breaks. Most of the songs are new, although there is one traditional song - \"John Barbour\". My favorite from the CD is the song \"When I Am King\", a catchy, upbeat tune with great lyrics. The songs tend to share a theme of maintaining mental health, perspective and hopefulness through love and laughter in a world that is often discouraging. It is a tonic most of us can use. (Recommended) .\n\nThe Hard and the Easy (2005). Everyone's favorite band \"from the tropical island of Newfoundland\" is back with a different, but still highly enjoyable CD. Rather than lots of songs about the sea, the boys have 12 traditional songs about workers in the woods and rivers for a change., including not one, but two, songs about horses that fell through the ice, and a rolicking, slightly off-colour ballad about falling in love with a mermaid... The infectious energy and lovely harmonies are still here. Pour some rum and get ready for a good time. (Highly recommended)"
