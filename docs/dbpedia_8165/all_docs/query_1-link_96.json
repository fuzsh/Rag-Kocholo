        "text": "Thursday February 28\n\nDON’T PICK ON THE ARTS: The Atlanta City Council, facing budget shortfalls, proposed cutting funding for arts groups. But after a spirited council meeting at which arts supporters rallied to speak against the cuts, funding restored almost to 2001 levels. Atlanta Journal-Constitution 02/27/02\n\nLEARNING THROUGH POP CULTURE: Does “teaching” popular culture dumb down education? Maybe not. “Getting our students to ‘read’ popular cultural critically may well become our task as teachers in an age increasingly dominated by the mass media. If students can learn to reflect on what they view in movies or on television, the process may eventually make them better readers of literature. The many critics of popular culture, who adamantly oppose its inclusion in the college curriculum, fear that studying it inevitably involves dragging what has traditionally been regarded as high culture down to the same level. But that is not to say that no embrace is possible. By being selective and rigorously analytical, one may be able to lift popular culture up to the level of high culture, or at least pull it in that direction.” Wilson Quarterly 01/02\n\nTHE ART OF GLASS AND BODIES: Surprised researchers have discovered that “the cells that make up the heart, lungs, and many other organs in the body display glasslike properties, according to a report in the October Physical Review Letters.” They conjecture that “just as heat can turn an apparently solid champagne glass into liquid, cells are made more fluid – and therefore able to contract, crawl, and divide – by internal jostlings within the cell, what is called noise temperature.” Harvard Focus 11/01\n\nWednesday February 27\n\nEVEN TOUGHER COPYRIGHT LAWS: The World Intellectual Property Organization, an international body of government representatives that globalizes laws, has announced new guidelines to crack down on digital piracy. The WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performance and Phonograms Treaty, which go into effect over the next three months, extend copyright protection to computer programs, movies and music.” Wired 02/26/02\n\nMIGHT AS WELL HAVE ASKED JAMIE SALE TO DESIGN IT: One sure way to get a hostile reaction from the Russian press is to allow a foreigner, particularly an American, to design a building in St. Petersburg. It works even better if the American is chosen over a prominent home-grown architect. So when a commission chose Eric Owen Moss to head up the massive renovation needed for the Mariinsky Theatre, it was a good bet that many people were not going to be happy. Andante 02/27/02\n\nSUBVERTING THE TEST: From kindergarten on, Korea’s education system is geared towards teaching students how to pass the exam any student wanting to go to college must take at the age of 18. “There are no alternatives for less academically minded students interested in subjects like art or music, or who don’t want to go to college at all. The result is a system designed to produce cookie-cutter test-takers.” But Korea’s students – many of whom are expected to study 18 hours a day – are demoralized by the test, and drop-out rates have soared. So why is the government trying to shut down an alternative school that seems to be finding success? Far East Economic Review 02/28/02\n\nMAKING STRIDES IN ST. PAUL: Long in the shadow of its larger sister city, Minneapolis, St. Paul has in the last decade begun to come alive again. Now, a new mayor is making the arts an emphasis, meeting with the city’s existing theater and music execs as well as looking for ways to draw new blood into the St. Paul arts scene. “Where new Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak plans to eliminate that city’s Office of Cultural Affairs, [St. Paul Mayor Randy] Kelly says he hopes to be able to direct more city resources toward the development of arts and culture.” Saint Paul Pioneer Press 02/24/02\n\nTuesday February 26\n\nNEW YORK’S NEW CULTURE CZAR: New York City has a new culture czar. Cultural affairs commissioner Kate D. Levin “inherits a department many arts professionals describe as in need of serious reinvigoration. Even as Rudolph W. Giuliani poured an unprecedented amount of city money into cultural building projects and became known for his love of opera, the agency charged with promoting the interests of New York’s arts institutions quietly but steadily diminished in size and influence amid years of budgetary ups and downs.” The New York Times 02/26/02\n\nSELLING OUT SELLARS: The end, when it came, was swift. Director Peter Sellars had promised something completely different for this year’s Adelaide Festival. Within a few days of revealing what that was, though, Sellars had resigned. Why? Interviews with Adelaide City Messenger editors reveal the increasing skepticism Sellars plans had provoked. The Idler 02/26/02\n\nSELLING OUT ABORIGINAL: Australian Aboriginal art is very popular these days. But is it being over-promoted? “When we talk to old people in this country and they … tell us their stories, and then when we go somewhere like Germany and see that story told on a tea-towel … or we see a woman playing the didgeridoo, that is a total abuse of what we are giving the world.” The Age (Melbourne) 02/26/02\n\nMonday February 25\n\nMESSING WITH THE CLASSICS: Why do critics get so upset by resettings of classic works? Okay, maybe dance gets away with some updating, but play Verdi “with a line of men sitting on the loo,” and throw in “midget devils and gang rape” and everyone’s screaming. “What’s in operation is an artistic dress-code in which we believe that old stories should be told in the old way even though the artists who are now the beloveds of cultural conservatives – Shakespeare, Mozart, Bach – told old stories in a new way.” The Guardian (UK) 02/23/02\n\nBUT HE THROWS A GOOD PARTY… London “arts celebrities” have mounted a campaign to pressure Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi not to remove Mario Fortunato, the Italian cultural envoy to London. “A letter to Mr Berlusconi, published last week in Italian and British newspapers, praised Dr Fortunato’s tenure as a roaring commercial and artistic success which turned the Belgravia institute into one of London’s hippest cultural spots.” The Guardian (UK) 02/25/02\n\nSunday February 24\n\nDRAWING THE LINE: A man in British Columbia is on trial for distribution of child pornography, in the form of a story he wrote. The accused claims that the story is literature, not porn, and as such is protected speech. Not a new debate, of course, but still a brutally difficult one to participate in. Does the quality of the work determine whether it is art? Or the content? Or the inclusion of non-pornographic material beside the offensive stuff? One thing’s for sure: no one envies the judge. Toronto Star 02/23/02\n\nWHO NEEDS LONDON? “The decision as to which UK city will be appointed European Capital of Culture in 2008 will be made in March,” and at least one British writer is pitching an unlikely candidate. “To argue against Belfast winning the honour because it has no opera or ballet and has not produced a Belfast Ulysses is to deny the aspirations of present and future generations – culture pitches itself endlessly forward; culture is a debate, an argument.” The Guardian (UK) 02/23/02\n\nBBC4 – ARTS HAVEN OR CLEVER DODGE? For years now, Brits have complained that the BBC has been dumbing down the level of its arts programming, and bemoaning the recent lack of much in the way of live concerts or truly informative arts documentaries. The public broadcaster’s response has been to launch BBC4, a cable channel supposedly dedicated to the arts. But critics are howling still, saying that the arts should not be relegated to “niche” programming, but distributed throughout the BBC schedule as they once were. Sunday Times of London 02/24/02\n\nFriday February 22\n\nBUSH’S ARTS COUNCIL APPOINTMENTS SEND “MIXED MESSAGES”: President George Bush has appointed six new members of the National Council on the Arts. The Council advises the National Endowment for the Arts. “However, the nominations to serve on this Council, which oversees the selection of grants for all American artists, send mixed messages about the President’s support of diverse art forms and of the Arts Endowment itself.” One of the appointees, for example, belongs to an organization that advocates abolishment of the NEA. Artswire Current 02/21/02\n\nJAPAN STAYS AT HOME: Yes travel is down worldwide since September 11. But in Japan travel has shrunk to almost nothing. Companies specializing in Japanese cultural tours to New York say business is about 10 percent of usual levels. Why? “The herd mentality appears responsible for a chain reaction involving Japanese tourists avoiding overseas travel, particularly to the United States, with one Japanese company after another canceling its employees’ overseas travel for training or other purposes, simply for the reason that other companies also have canceled.” Daily Yomiuri 02/22/02\n\nTHE DEATH OF CITY LIFE? “James Howard Kunstler’s 1993 book The Geography of Nowhere was an impassioned rant against suburbia, shopping malls, cheap disposable architecture and the fragmentation of communities fostered by an increasingly mobile, car-oriented culture. His latest book, The City in Mind, is a sort of companion to that earlier volume, a jeremiad against poor urban planning and the decline of the American city. His outlook is pessimistic, to say the least.” The New York Times 02/22/02\n\nWednesday February 20\n\nA COPYRIGHT TOO FAR? The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that will review whether Congress’ 1998 copyright law went too far in protecting the rights of those who create intellectual property. Plaintiffs “argue that Congress sided too heavily with writers and other creators when it passed a law in 1998 retroactively extending copyright terms by 20 years.” Wired 02/19/02\n\nHOLDING ON TO WHAT YOU’VE GOT: Give credit where its due: American arts organizations have come a long way in the lobbying game in the last decade or so. With most states facing crushing budget deficits this year, and almost everything on the chopping block, theatres, orchestras, and galleries are fighting desperately to keep the pittances they’ve managed to squeeze from their elected representatives. Of course, this works better in some states than others. Minneapolis Star Tribune 02/20/02\n\nSAYING NO TO CIVIC ART SINCE 1911: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is a textbook example of a city risen from the ashes of a bleak, post-industrial malaise that many thought it could never dig out from. But although many aspects of Pittsburgh life are much improved, the realm of public art is still a difficult area. The city’s Art Commission, when it is mentioned at all, is usual cited as a bunch of folks determined to put a stop to civic art projects for one reason or another, rather than a group encouraging new and diverse public art. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 02/20/02\n\nTuesday February 19THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROBLEM: “There is a growing catalogue of worries about intellectual property issues—from the emergence of overly broad ‘business method’ patents to heated charges that proprietary claims on pharmaceuticals stifle affordable access to medicine in the Third World. A day hardly goes by without a high-profile intellectual-property battle heading to court. Meanwhile, university researchers are griping that open, collegial dialogue is being eroded by proprietary interests and secrecy as professors vie to create startups and get rich. These issues are interwoven because they all involve balancing similar kinds of private and public needs in a knowledge-based economy.”Technology Review 02/18/02\n\nHOLLICK TAKE OVER SOUTH BANK: Lord Clive Hollick, a Labour Party friend and media tycoon, takes over as chairman of the South Bank Board. “His most pressing task will be to raise the money necessary to upgrade the centre.” Criticisms of the appointment were immediate. “This does show total insensitivity to the concerns of the public about cronyism.” BBC 02/19/0\n\nCRONIES R US: Yet another political crony has been put in charge of an English cultural institution, writes Norman Lebrecht. Lord Clive Hollick might think he has the political clout to make a success of his new job as chairman of London’s South Bank, but he doesn’t have the experience to succeed, and besides, “Tony Blair does not want to be bothered with culture – or with building schemes, for that matter, since the Millennium Dome fiasco.” The Telegraph (UK) 02/19/02\n\nSELLARS RETURNS TO ADELAIDE: Director Peter Sellars showed up for the Adelaide Festival this week promising to explain after the festival why he had been removed as director of the festival. “My mistakes here – I will give you a very impressive list of them mid-March,” he said, breaking into peals of laughter. “I have a very impressive list. I have looked it over pretty carefully and I see things that, of course, I didn’t see when I came here. Next time out …” Sydney Morning Herald 02/19/02\n\nMonday February 18PUBLISHING DEFENSIVELY: Want to protect your great idea from being stolen by others? Tell the world. “Such disclosure, known as defensive publishing, is an increasingly common tactic for protecting intellectual property. Publishing an innovation means that competitors have access to it, of course. But many companies say the competitive risk is outweighed by the benefit of making it difficult for someone else to win a patent — a patent that could give the holder the right to demand licensing fees from all other users of the technology or technique.”\n\nThe New York Times 02/18/02\n\nA CHAIRMAN FOR SOUTH BANK CENTRE: There’s a new man in charge at London’s South Bank Centre, which includes the Royal Festival Hall and the Hayward Gallery – Clive Hollick, one of Labour’s biggest business supporters and former owner of Express newspapers. “The job is unpaid and arguably thankless as the centre has been involved in years of dramatic attempts at redevelopment that have been repeatedly stalled.” The Independent (UK) 02/18/02\n\nPURELY PURITAN: Oh, let’s all dump on the Puritans, shall we? Those odd folk of 17th Century England weren’t appealing? “A puritan is a censor, a prude, an enemy of the arts.” And yet, the Puritans “were certainly united in their belief that works of art were necessary adjuncts of political greatness.” The Guardian (UK) 02/17/02\n\nSunday February 17\n\nCHANGING THE SYSTEM: New York City’s new commissioner of cultural affairs has swept into office with a plan to reform what she sees as a broken system. Specifically, Kate Levin wants to provide for a more open and equitable distribution of the city’s resources allocated for support of the arts. Under the current system, “85 percent of the city’s arts financing is given to the Cultural Institutions Group, a group of 35 prominent cultural institutions, while the rest of the city’s arts groups are left to apply for remaining 15 percent.” The New York Times 02/16/02\n\nHOORAY FOR ELITISM! “These days, to be called elitist is to have one’s character defamed, like being called racist or sexist. Unfortunately for arts organizations, fear of the label can have a worse outcome than wearing it proudly — especially when it leads to mundane programming and favors diversity over quality.” Minneapolis Star Tribune 02/17/02\n\nThursday February 14\n\nHELPING OUT AFTER 9-11: An anonymous arts-loving donor gave the Carnegie Corporation $10 million to give to New York arts groups hurting after September 11. The money – as much as $100,000 each will go to 137 arts organizations. The New York Times 02/14/02\n\nWHERE NO ONE KNOWS YOUR NAME: “So what do you do?” “I’m a conceptual artist.” “How interesting. What project are you working on at the moment?” “I only have one project. I change my name by deed poll every six months.” The Guardian (UK) 02/13/02\n\nWednesday February 13\n\nROYAL OPERA HOUSE TO GO MULTIMEDIA: London’s Royal Opera House is going multimedia. Under new director Tony Hall (who knows something about electronic media after his years at the BBC) the ROH will broadcast performances on large screens. A test is planned for London, and the idea will be tried elsewhere if the initial broadcasts are a success. There are also plans to offer broadcasts of live performances in cinemas and “the opportunity to have online chats with stars including Placido Domingo and Darcey Bussell.” The Independent (UK) 02/13/02\n\nTuesday February 12\n\nINSITEFUL: “Site-specific work has developed out of a gradual loss of faith, or interest, in traditional purpose-built venues – the gilt-and-velvet theatre in which the curtain rises on a play, the gallery where flat paintings hang on white walls, or those dreary municipal ‘centres’ such as the Barbican, that sprang up in the Sixties and Seventies.” For 10 years one of the most ambitious presenters of site-specific work in the UK is a group called Artangel. “Many such Artangel projects involve what is known as ‘the community’. But we don’t tick politically correct boxes, or set out to be accessible and non-elitist. It’s the artist who leads, and we follow.” The Telegraph (UK) 02/12/02\n\nSHIFTING SEAT OF LEARNING: For a long time, New England has been considered home to America’s most prestigious universities. “But these days, the region’s dominant hold on the higher-education market is fading. The nation’s population center is shifting to the South and West, where a handful of public and private colleges have emerged as real competitors in selectivity, quality, and, most of all, price.” Chronicle of Higher Education 02/11/02\n\nSunday February 10\n\nCOPYWRONG: Last week a judge ruled that the new Austin Powers movie couldn’t use the name “Goldmember” because it infringes on MGM’s James Bond copyright. “The Goldmember affair – which riled MGM because it parodies the 1964 Bond film Goldfinger in which Sean Connery uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve – is just one in a long line of copyright battles that continue to erupt over the ownership of everything from book and movie titles to acronyms, initials, images, even single words or catch phrases.” The Globe & Mail (Canada) 02/09/02\n\nFriday February 8\n\nAN END TO DECENCY: Ex-New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s “Decency Commission,” set up after the mayor objected to an art exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, finally came up with a report. But that report will likely never see the light of day now that Giuliani is out as mayor and Michael Bloomberg is running the city. Says Bloomberg: “I am opposed to government censorship of any kind. I don’t think government should be in the business of telling museums what is art or what they should exhibit.” Nando Times (UPI) 02/08/02\n\nTAKEBACKS: On Monday Catherine Reynolds canceled her $38 million gift to the Smithsonian. The money had been controversial because Reynolds had wanted the museum to build a paean to individual accomplishment with the cash, and even suggested who might be included. But Washington’s big arts donors are philosophical about the debacle. Says Reynolds: “I think we really hit a nerve. We’ve gotten so many calls from museums in the past two days.” Washington Post 02/07/02\n\nALL ABOUT THE ENTROPY: A group of mathematicians has been analyzing documents using the “file-ZIPping” programs that computers use to conserve space, and some interesting linguistic results have emerged. The patterns, or entropy, of the language in the text being analyzed is unique to the point that, after being fed multiple documents of varying styles, the computer was able to identify different languages, and even anonymous authors, based solely on the sequence of the text. The Economist 02/07/02\n\nGRASS WON’T KEEP OFF THE TABOOS: “German novelist Guenter Grass has broken two national taboos this week, calling for the publication of Hitler’s Mein Kampf, and raising the delicate subject of German wartime refugees fleeing from the Red Army. He called for basic information on National Socialism to be made available, and for public discussion of the phenomenon. He said that would help young people who may be fascinated with Nazism, but do not understand the reality behind it.” BBC 02/08/02\n\nThursday February 7\n\nRESTORING AFGHANISTAN’S CULTURE: UNESCO has made the reconstruction and preservation of Afghan heritage the focus of “International Year of Cultural Heritage – 2002.” “The immediate priority is the formation of a cultural policy by the Afghan government, revival of Kabul museum and the reconstruction of Islamic cultural heritage in Herat city.” Asia Times 02/06/02\n\nTHE BEST WE CAN BE: For a long time we humans have believed that humankind would always continue to evolve, to get better and better. Look at all the improvements in our species in the past few hundred years. But a scientist says we may have peaked – that this is the best it gets, that it’s all downhill from here… The Observer (UK) 02/03/02\n\nPENNSYLVANIA TO CUT ARTS FUNDING? After increases in its budget for most of the 1990s, the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts would see a 9 percent reduction in its budget – from $15.4 million to $14 million – if a proposal by the state’s governor. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 02/07/02\n\nWednesday February 6\n\nCHICAGO’S NEW THEATRE: A new Music and Dance Theatre has started construction in Chicago. “The venue, which will serve as the performance space for a dozen local arts groups, including Chicago Opera Theater, Music of the Baroque, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago and Joffrey Ballet of Chicago, will carry $53 million in design and construction costs. The theater’s board also hopes to raise between $9.5 million and $10 million for an endowment fund that will subsidize the cost of operating the space for the arts groups.” Chicago Business 02/04/02\n\nTuesday February 5\n\nBUSH ASKS FOR MORE ARTS/HUMANITIES MONEY: “As part of its fiscal 2003 budget proposal, the Bush administration yesterday requested an increase of $9 million for the Smithsonian for a total of $528 million, an all-time high in its federal appropriation.” Bush also asked for $2 million increases for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. This would be the fifth year in a row the NEA has had a budget boost. Washington Post 02/05/02\n\nINDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OR LAZINESS? Some critics decline to do independent research into the subject they are reviewing, claiming some invisible line between critic and journalist. But the “rigid segregation of the critic and the work has always seemed both precious and limiting to me. It suggests both a haughty distance from the thinking, breathing creator and a fear that the critic’s pristine sensors might be blunted or corrupted by deigning to talk with artists about their work. Being able to engage in spirited discourse, rather than unthinking boosterism or jealous sniping, is the first sign of a mature cultural society.” The Globe & Mail (Toronto) 02/05/02\n\nTHE TROUBLE WITH TOYS: A toy exhibition in Nuremberg showcases the latest in kids’ toys. “Many new products try to reconcile children’s needs and parents’ concerns. The solution is to separate form from content, the first offering children fun, the second soothing adult consciences. However enjoyable and colorful the many new toys are, seeing them all at the same time is rather depressing. Many of them talk, dance, react and simulate so perfectly that they look more like playmates or caregivers than toys. They are aimed at annoying the lonely, unimaginative child so that he or she annoys no one else.” Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 02/05/02\n\nMonday February 4\n\nSTANDARD-ISSUE TASTE? The tastemakers of yesteryear helped blaze a way through art. But have the special feelings for art these people had become too commonplace? “Does there inevitably come a point, when more and more individuals have a feeling for art, at which all those feelings become standard-issue feelings? There are certainly a good many people working in our museums and arts organizations who seem to believe that this is the case. They regard the public not as a group of individuals but as a monstrous abstraction – as a mirage. The very idea of the tastemaker may now be a paradox. We may be entering a time when what we must celebrate is the individuality, the privacy, even the loneliness of taste. To affirm the solitariness of taste may be the best way, right now, to celebrate the things we love.” The New Republic 02/01/02\n\nCHOOSING TO WALK OUT: Unlike politicians or bores at dinner parties, it’s pretty easy to discard art. “Whether you care about opera, or books, or music, or theatre, or whether you couldn’t give two hoots about them, whether your occasional displeasure with them is an expression of sound critical judgment or bias or merely a bad mood, you have to admit that compared with most other things in life, they are easy to get rid of. You can say goodbye to them abruptly, frankly, unequivocally, completely — either because you’re bored to tears with the whole idea of them, or else because you know there are too many good operas, good books, good plays, good musical compositions to waste time on bad ones.” The Globe & Mail (Canada) 02/04/02\n\nSunday February 3\n\nSTORYBORED: “It is one of the most notable features of this age of artistic over-production that just as the quantity of fiction produced has grown so alarmingly, so too has the number of observers ready lazily to declare that all life has gone out of the activity. We no sooner open the cultural pages of a newspaper than some commentator tells us that the novel, the theatre, the television play, the poem or the movie has died, but that somehow nobody else has noticed.” The Guardian (UK) 02/02/02\n\nWHERE ARE WE GOING? When you’re right in the middle of consuming contemporary art, it’s difficult to see where its going. “Certainly, in the free-for-all that is contemporary art, the challenge is to find any connection within the chaos of its styles, influences, cross-influences and impulses. As art critics, we’re largely dancing in the dark.” Hartford Advocate 02/01/02\n\nFriday February 1\n\nBEWARE – THE ARTISTS AT THE GATES: In the UK, enrollment is down in university science courses, and up in arts and humanities. Whether that’s good news or bad depends upon your outlook: the information was presented to Members of Parliament as warning; it indicates, said one MP, a “slide toward the cheap end” of academia.” The Guardian (UK) 01/31/02\n\nThursday February 28\n\nHANDS OFF OUR BUSINESS! With the US Congress threatening to write legislation requiring copy protection technology in new digital devices, tech companies pledge to come up with a standard of their own. The movie industry is worried that new devices will allow consumers to rip off their products. Wired 02/27/02\n\nWednesday February 27\n\nNPR SCALING BACK ON CULTURE? “National Public Radio has begun an extensive review of its musical programming, and is considering overhauling or eliminating some of its venerable jazz and classical offerings. A strategy paper written by NPR’s top programming executive says some of the network’s live performance and recorded music shows ‘may disappear,’ although officials stress that nothing is final.” Washington Post 02/27/02\n\nPROBLEM SOLVED? For the first time in 30 years, three African-American actors have been nominated for top acting Oscars. “But instead of drawing cheers from those who have been fighting for greater black representation at all levels of the entertainment industry, the situation is raising concerns that many people will conclude that the problem has been solved.” It hasn’t been. The New York Times 02/27/02\n\nSYNERGY OR MONOPOLY? When Congress changed the rules of the broadcast industry back in the mid-90s, supporters claimed the new system would spur greater competition and better content for consumers. The exact opposite has been the case, as “old-fashioned, bare-knuckled competition grudgingly gives way to attempted “synergy,” as companies that bring us news, information and banal sitcoms keep getting bigger and more powerful, while simultaneously trying to use their various assets to prop up and support each other.” Los Angeles Times 02/27/02\n\nTuesday February 26\n\nHOLLYWOOD UNDER ATTACK: Motion Picture Association president Jack Valenti has discovered who’s behind all those nasty accusations about Hollywood. It’s “a small community of professors.” Those blackguards, says Jack, have charged that “producers deliberately are holding back the exhibition of movies on the Net … and that copyright owners are stifling innovation in the digital world.” Nothing, he says, could be further from the truth. Washington Post 02/25/02\n\nSUCCESFUL IN HOLLYWOOD, BUT BORED: Lasse Hallström is a hot director in Hollywood right now: Chocolat, The Shipping News. But he’s ready to go home to Sweden, so he can make films that are, well, less American. “”I think Americans are more likely to be satisfied by experiencing the expected,” he says. “They feel safer and have a better time. Europeans are more open to being genuinely surprised.

So the government has introduced a bill to give movie producers shooting in Australia a 12.5 percent tax rebate, which could save producers millions of dollars.

For years now, Brits have complained that the BBC has been dumbing down the level of its arts programming, and bemoaning the recent lack of much in the way of live concerts or truly informative arts documentaries. The public broadcaster’s response has been to launch BBC4, a cable channel supposedly dedicated to the arts. But critics are howling still, saying that the arts should not be relegated to “niche” programming, but distributed throughout the BBC schedule as they once were. Sunday Times of London 02/24/02\n\nCROSSING THE COLOR LINE: “The Academy Awards have long been known as a lily-white affair, with only six black actors ever winning an Oscar and 36 snagging nominations. So the Feb. 12 Oscar nominations of Will Smith, Denzel Washington and Halle Berry have drawn the attention of many academy watchers. After all, this was the first time in the 73-year history of the Academy Awards that two African-Americans were nominated in the lead actor category, and the first time since 1973 that three black lead performers received nods.” Dallas Morning News 02/23/02\n\nGRIEF AS A VOYEURISTIC EXPERIENCE: The trouble with portraying real mourning in a film is that most people do not express their grief by wailing uncontrollably for five minutes and then moving on with the plot of their lives, as movie scripts would tend to require. So historically, much of character grief in the movies has tended to occur off-screen. But a new batch of critically acclaimed films features human grief so prominently as to almost make it a character in itself.

When the September 11 attacks knocked classical radio station WNYC-FM off the air, and threw the national media into a frenzy of information gathering, the station began simulcasting its AM sister station, which carries a public radio news/talk format. “It’s been five months now, with no move back to music.

Their audiences may be shrinking, but TV networks are still money machines. And it’s only going to get better if a federal appeals court decision this week is allowed to stand.

The films were no worse than those in Cannes or Venice, and the stars were no fewer in number.

As we enter a new millennium, we are in the process of losing our biblical attachment to an entire form of communication: the graven image. From the carved tablets of the Ten Commandments, to walls of stone hieroglyphs, to the boxes of ancient magnetic tapes that Krapp lugs on to his desk, there was a physical cumbersomeness to these archives that related to their human origins.

For the first time since commercial TV was introduced in Britain (in 1954), the BBC scored more viewers than its commercial competition. Good right? “But just as BBC executives were congratulating themselves, the sniping began. The Beeb, as it is widely known here, was obsessed with ratings, its critics complained. It had not become the world’s most prestigious public broadcaster by kowtowing to the masses. Indeed, to have nudged ahead of ITV in the scramble for audiences was the ultimate proof that it had dumbed down its programming.” The New York Times 02/03/02\n\nPreviously: BBC SURGES: For the first time, the BBC1 TV channel has scored higher ratings for the year than chief competitior ITV1. “Ratings show BBC One with an audience share of 26.8% compared to 26.7% for ITV1.” BBC 01/01/02\n\nAnd: BBC RADIO AT RECORD LISTENERSHIP: BBC Radio listenership is up, beating out all commercial radio stations. “The number of people listening to BBC Radio each week has risen by 300,000 since September, taking the total to 32.7 million – a record since new monitoring methods were introduced in 1999.” BBC 02/01/02\n\nSEE CANADIAN: In the last two weeks of 2001, Lord of the Rings took in $40 million at the box office in Canada.

Both, however, are best-selling authors and TV pundits, which is why this literary scandal has generated so many headlines during the past two months. The controversy has touched off a national debate about what constitutes ethical behavior among writers and researchers, especially now that the Internet has made it so easy to copy passages electronically and insert them into a text.” Forbes.com 02/28/02\n\nMORE AMBROSE: Yet more passages from books by historian Stephen Ambrose are found to have been plagiarized from others. “Several more passages from the historian’s current best seller, The Wild Blue, have been found to closely resemble the works of others, among them the autobiography of former Sen.

The club revised that number to 9.1 percent — still well below the 15 percent annual return of the overall stock market, with dividends reinvested, over the same period.” Now the first reader lawsuits have been settled, and anyone who can prove they bought the books will get $25 vouchers from the publishers.

The Guardian (UK) 02/26/02\n\nPOETRY IN THE PASSING LANE: Editorial writers like to claim, without a lot of evidence, that ‘poetry is on the move.’ They rejoice that Beowulf is a best seller at last. Does this mean that poetry and democracy have come face to face? That poetry is no longer stuck under the thumb of the learned or even the literate? It might. With recent developments in technology; with poems traveling around the world on the Internet without price, tariff, or tax; with cyberwatchers able to encounter a fresh poem every day of the year, selected from new books and magazines, at poems.com, poetry may be gaining lots of customers.” The Atlantic 03/02\n\nI’D LIKE TO TEACH THE WORLD TO SING… So what’s wrong with the one city/one book idea where every citizen is encouraged to read the same book? What’s the point of it? The idea seems to promise so many things, like making the world a better place, like peace and understanding … but really – the reality is that the books that are chosen don’t really promote that at all… MobyLives 02/24/02\n\nMonday February 25\n\nGRAND THEFT HISTORY: Last Friday, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin admitted that her plagiarism of material was more extensive than she’d admitted before. Three of her books contain material stolen from others, and her publisher will destroy remaining copies. Why are historians stealing one another’s work? “The apparent epidemic of plagiarism is surely attributable in part to the new style of historical writing – the breezy, informal, anecdote-laden work that can’t bother itself with pesky distractions such as footnotes and proper sourcing.” Chicago Tribune 02/25/02\n\nTOO SOPHISTICATED TO READ TOGETHER? As New York struggles to find a book that the entire city might read, some of the city’s intellectuals have dumped on cities like Chicago that have had success with the one city/one book idea. New Yorkers, they say, are too independent to go for gimmicks that might work in less sophisticated cities (like Chicago). Chicagoans strike back: “They’re missing the point. What we found with our program is that it brought people from so many different backgrounds together.” Chicago Tribune 02/25/02\n\nTHE CURSE OF THE VANITY PRESS: Universal publishing might seem to be a good idea, but really… have you seen what people really want to have published? “All that stands between us and this nightmare vision of total authorship is the publishing industry itself, especially the major houses, trading on their power not to publish. By not publishing a lot of tat each year, these giants keep the storytelling hordes at bay.” The Observer (UK) 02/24/02\n\nBURIED IN SLUSH: “Some publishers consider reading slush a waste of resources and no longer accept it; some bribe their assistants to read it by throwing slush-and-pizza parties (presumably figuring that nothing makes cheesy fiction go down easier than a little cheese and pepperoni). My publisher welcomed all slush and handed me the reins. Thus for two years, in addition to fulfilling my normal editorial duties, I hired freelance readers, generated form rejection slips, evaluated the rare promising submission and fielded phone calls from every would-be Frank McCourt with a manuscript in his drawer and an Oprah’s Book Club Pick in his dreams. I wish I could say that serving as a conduit between the publishing elite and the uncorrupted masses taught me valuable lessons in compassion and grace. Instead, it convinced me that the world is full of lunatics.” Salon 02/25/02\n\nSunday February 24\n\nYOU MEAN THE ENRON SCANDAL ISN’T FICTION? “Whatever happened to fiction — any fiction — in actual newspapers and magazines? Sure, everyone does some special issue, once a year. But nobody does what the general-interest American magazines do: Harper’s, The New Yorker, the Atlantic and Esquire all run at least one short story, usually a piece of serious literary fiction, every month. No one even attempts it here [in Canada]; even Saturday Night had not had a regular fiction section for years before its demise.” The Globe & Mail (Toronto) 02/23/02\n\nHOW GOOD WAS STEINBECK? The debate has raged for decades, from the East-centric halls of Academia to the small towns of the plains. Was John Steinbeck one of the great writers of the last 200 years, or a good-not-great writer of only regional interest? Whichever side you come down on, you’ve probably never considered for a moment that the opposite opinion might be the case. But there are compelling arguments for each conclusion. Dallas Morning News 02/24/02\n\nBELATED TRIBUTE: At the time it was written, The Grapes of Wrath did not do wonders for John Steinbeck’s image in his California hometown, as the book painted locals as foul-mouthed, abusive extortionists and brutal oppressors of the Okie protagonists. But time heals many wounds, and this month, the 100th anniversary of Steinbeck’s birth will see him honored in the same town that once reviled him. The Age (Melbourne) 02/22/02\n\nFriday February 22\n\nTHE SAME READ: Getting everyone in a city to read the same book is an idea that is catching on big time. Why? “In an age of multimedia menus, with 24-hour cable TV and movies on demand, it might seem anachronistic that the low-tech book is occasioning this sudden civic interest. But some believe the surge of popularity for communal reading – not just by cities but also by book clubs and at bookstore events – is a direct response to the essential loneliness of modern life, an antidote to the ‘bowling alone’ syndrome coined by Harvard University’s Robert D. Putnam to describe the recent downturn in civic participation.” Los Angeles Times 02/17/02\n\nThursday February 21\n\nTHE ELECTRONIC LIBRARY: E-publishing may have slowed with the dot-com bust, but libraries are starting to get into the electronic book business. A library system in California is jumping online. “By clicking on links that are integrated into the library’s own catalog, computer users will be able to read the full text of any book in Ebrary’s database, a collection of about 5,000 titles. The system enables people to search electronically through a book and read its pages on the screen, while ultimately encouraging them to check out a physical copy when they want to read it in full. No option is available for downloading the books to portable devices.” The New York Times 02/21/02\n\nFIXING TO READ ONE BOOK: Did one of the judges choosing a book for the One Book, One New York program – in which everyone is encouraged to read the same book – trade his vote in an Olympic ice dancing-type scandal?

Indeed, the poet laureate writes words for every official occasion. But why? “The whole concept of the poet laureate is completely ridiculous and they shouldn’t have one. When the idea of it started, poets had to have aristocratic and royal patrons in order to survive, but everything is different now. The masses are not interested in what the queen wants anyway, so it’s all a farce. And the forced subjects are bound to make the poetry worse.” The Guardian (UK) 02/19/02\n\nCOPYING IS SOMETIMES A VERY GOOD IDEA: The recent exposures of plagiarism by successful writers have obscured an important fact of writing: One good way to develop a style is deliberately to copy someone else’s, as painters do with great works of art. That seems to have been exactly what was going on with The Bondwoman’s Narrative, a nineteenth-century American manuscript which may have been the work of a runaway slave. The New Yorker 02/18/02\n\nTHE EMPEROR’S NEW HORROR STORY: So Stephen King says he’s going to retire. Maybe it’s not a bad idea. “King’s retirement may be unlikely, but it’s not a bad idea. In fact, it’s a great idea. Truth is, King hasn’t reached the point of recycling; he’s been recycling for years. His fans may not want to admit it, but Stephen King’s most recent books are dull, dreary, repetitive, unoriginal, uninspired hack work. And the best thing – perhaps the only thing – that King can do about it is to stop writing.” Salon 02/19/02\n\nMonday February 18\n\nWHAT PEOPLE READ (HAVE READ): Michael Korda’s new book traces the history of best-selling books over the past century. The lists, he reports, haven’t changed much over the years: “These kinds of books can be easily categorized: dieting, self-help advice (financial or personal), celebrity memoirs, popular fiction, scientific or religious revelations, medical advice (sex, longevity, child-rearing), folksy wisdom, humor, and the Civil War.” But, writes critic Jerome Weeks, if you check the lists carefully, there’s quite a difference in what sells now from what used to sell. Dallas Morning News 02/17/02\n\nLESS THAN THE MERITS: What is it with authors lately? Caught plagiarizing, they’ve not exactly acted gracefully. Then there’s historian Caleb Carr, who responded to negative reviews with some boneheaded self-promotion. Thing is, some of his complaints may be justified, but the vitriol with which he defended himself negates any sympathy he might have earned.

Critic Johnathan Yardley recently touched a nerve when, in the course of writing a column on the state of bookselling, he dared to posit the heretical notion that the big chain bookstores (Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Million, etc.) are not only not evil, but actually superior in many ways to small independents. A firestorm of responsible opposing viewpoints has descended, and several of them got together for a little conference-call Yardley-bashing. Holt Uncensored 02/08/02\n\nVICTOR HUGO AT 200: The French (and a lot of other people) are celebrating the 200th birthday of Victor Hugo – not without a bit of ambiguity. The webpage for the Education Ministry, for example, presents him as an exemplar of the values on which the Republic is founded. “This is a risky thing to say about a man who began as a court poet, became the ringleader of the young Romantics, cosied up to three monarchies and managed to be a hero to socialists at the same time.” The Economist 02/14/02\n\nGOOD CITIZENSHIP OR SNEAKY MARKETING? The literary magazine Book has been making strides in the publishing world recently, and the glossy, high-impact look it favors has been attracting attention from some big-money types. But a controversy has arisen over Book‘s newest benefactor, and despite protestations of editorial independence from all sides, some observers are worried that the magazine will soon become little more than a Barnes & Noble promotional tool. Philadelphia Inquirer 02/14/02\n\nThursday February 14\n\nARE YOU NOW OR HAVE YOU EVER BEEN… When police came into one of the largest independent bookstores in the country with a search warrant demanding to know what books a client had bought, the store said no. “Although many people aren’t aware of it, in the eyes of the law buying a book is different from buying a bicycle or a pack of cigarettes. Through the years, the protections accorded materials covered by the First Amendment, such as books and newspapers, have evolved to protect the institutions that provide those materials as well. So when law enforcement officials say they just want information about the books a suspect purchased, booksellers and civil rights advocates see the demand as something that could erode book buyers’ privacy and First Amendment rights.” Salon 02/13/02\n\nIN PRAISE OF SMALL PRESSES: “Everyone knows book publishing is an easy thing to do, just as everyone knows he can run a baseball team or put out a newspaper. The business model for these small houses permits them to produce print runs of 3,000 or 4,000 or 5,000 copies and still have a chance for profit. Larger houses need minimums of 12,000 or 15,000 copies, virtually eliminating the likelihood that they will take a chance on the experimental. Would one of today’s conglomerate publishing houses be the first to publish Joyce’s Ulysses? Not likely.” The New York Times 02/14/02\n\nTHE GO-TO GUY OF PLAGIARISM: Thomas Mallon is a distinguished writer in his own right, but people most want to talk to him about plagiarism. That’s because he wrote the book: “We can’t make up our minds just how serious a lapse plagiarism really is. The confusion comes from an aura of naughtiness, a haze that shakes like a giggle: people think of plagiarism as a youthful scrape, something they got caught doing at school. We often, and mistakenly, see plagiarism as a crime of degree, an excess of something legitimate, `imitation’ or `research’ that got out of hand.” Chicago Tribune 02/14/02\n\nSTICKY SITUATION: For months someone has been pouring syrup in the book return boxes of Tacoma, Washington-area libraries.

He “bitterly attacked reviewer Laura Miller and New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani, implying that they should stick to writing about ‘bad women’s fiction’.” Not surprisingly, the comments didn’t go well with readers, and now Carr has apologised. “Meanwhile, Amazon.com has pulled Carr’s self-review of Lessons of Terror. The author had given himself the highest rating, five stars, and stated, ‘Several reviews have made claims concerning my credibility that are, quite simply, libelous, and will be dealt with soon’.” Baltimore Sun (AP) 02/13/02\n\nANOTHER HISTORIAN INVESTIGATED: Emory University is investigating the work of its award-winning historian Michael Bellesiles. Bellesiles “won last year’s prestigious Bancroft Prize, the most coveted award in the field of American history, for his book The Arming of America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture. But the book drew intense criticism from researchers who said they could not find the data upon which he said he based his thesis.” Chicago Tribune 02/13/02\n\nTuesday February 12\n\nTHE DISAPPEARING AUSTRALIAN: Only two of Australia’s Top 10 best-selling books last year were Australian. “Interest in Australian writers, it seems, is waning fast, leaving our culture in danger of either being swamped by globally marketed mega-sellers, or disappearing up its own, scarcely regarded, fundament. The figures don’t lie, but perhaps the root of the problem rests not in a lack of interest, nor in disregard for our own history by publishing houses. Perhaps it lies in the practical application of those two awful words: ‘Australian’ and ‘literature’.” The Age (UK) 02/12/02\n\nCLUBBING: It’s a common perception in the book industry that book clubs divert retail sales rather than add new readers. But a new industry study concludes that “the clubs serve as powerful promotional vehicles that stimulate sales through a wide variety of channels.” Publishers Weekly 02/11/02\n\nMonday February 11\n\nNEXT GENERATION LIBRARY: A new Irish library is pulling in the crowds. It was built right next to a busy shopping center, its librarian hands out carnations, and it projects a different tone than traditional temples of books. “Here are the people who have nowhere else to go, people who would go demented sitting at home, people who have a thirst for knowledge and a dearth of funds to satisfy it, people with an inquiry no bookshop could deal with and people relieved, finally, to find a space where they are no longer refugees but library users.” Irish Times 02/07/02\n\nCOMMISSION INCREASE: “The largest literary agencies, William Morris and International Creative Management, have both quietly raised the commissions they charge authors to 15 percent of their advance and royalties from 10 percent.” The New York Times 02/10/02\n\nWRITING WITHOUT A NET: There has been a recent rash of publishing “restored” versions of “classic” novels — “novels put back together the way the writer originally had them before some demented editor got his or her filthy hands on them and ruined them.” Wait – it isn’t a bad thing – about that 1200-page dream sequence that was cut… MobyLives 02/11/02\n\nSunday February 10\n\nTHE LIBRARY PROBLEM: Libraries are having difficulty getting people through their doors, as more and more research is done online. “Ironically, although library visits nationwide are on the decline, library resources are being used now more than ever, librarians and students say.

Does an author own not only the sequence of words in his/her work, but the characters and events as well? Almost a year after the controversy over a parody sequel to Gone With the Wind, another legal storm is brewing over a companion book to J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. Coincidentally, Houghton Mifflin, the publisher which defended the Wind parody, is the group suing the author of The Lord of the Rings Diary. Boston Globe 02/07/02\n\nA POEM AS LOVELY AS A… “The Academy of American Poets yesterday named Tree Swenson its executive director, succeeding William Wadsworth, whose departure after a dispute with the organization’s board last fall provoked angry protests from some prominent poets.

But she’s still writing poetry, and still worrying about the new generation of writers. “The thing that’s depressing is teaching graduate students today and discovering that they don’t know simple elemental facts of grammar. They really do not know how to scan a line. Many of them don’t know the difference between lie and lay, let alone its and it’s. And they’re in graduate school!” The Atlantic Monthly 02/06/02\n\nDULL OR NOT, THE ESTATE IS WORRIED: “A one-man publishing house has been ordered not to publish – at least for now – his The Lord of the Rings Diary, which puts J.R.R. Tolkien’s trilogy in chronological order.” In his defense, the author of the book says, “To be honest, Diary makes for dull reading. It isn’t exciting and it isn’t literary and it wasn’t intended to be. It’s like a dictionary, it packages facts about Rings in the most useful possible format.” Washington Post 02/07/02\n\nWednesday February 6\n\nWANNA READ A GOOD FIGHT? When it comes to slinging words and hurling phrases, lightning adjectival jabs and roundhouse predicates, a roomful (or a pageful) of cantankerous poets is where you’ll find world-class vituperation.

Yet another has been caught up in charges of extensive plagiarizing. Historian Robert M.

That hasn’t stopped people from writing it though – The Atlantic gets about 250 short stories a week submitted by hopeful authors. That works out to one story published for every 1000 sent in. Even if you get rejected though – keep trying. The Atlantic has rejected writers for years before finally publishing them. Those “who just keep writing sooner or later find a workable voice and form, in ways that are unconscious.” Hartford Courant 01/31/02\n\nTOLKIEN RULES CANADIAN PUBLISHING: What was the biggest selling book in Canada last year? Tolkien’s The Lord Of The Rings series and its prequel, The Hobbit, which sold 1.5 million copies. “That’s more than the combined number of books Canada’s medium-sized publishers sell in a year.

SORT OF: “There are something like six or seven sentences in three or four of my books that are the sentences of other writers. I know they are, and now reporters know they are, and now the whole world knows they are because I put footnotes behind those sentences and cited where I got this from. What I had failed to do – and this was my fault, my mistake – was to put quotation marks around those six or seven sentences.” Washington Post 02/01/02\n\nTHE COMPUTER MADE ME DO IT: You might think electronic data banks and sophisticated word processing programs and instant Internet access would simplify research, making it ever easier to keep track of who wrote what.

Observers expect Daniel Libeskind’s entry will be chosen because of its theatricality and big statement and potential to draw in the crowds. But some of the museum’s senior staff favor another design they believe would better show the collection. Problem is, the public presentation of that entry was poorly done, and failed to fire up anyone’s imagination… The Globe & Mail (Canada) 02/25/02\n\nA VALENTINE TO CHRYSLER: “There may be New Yorkers who dislike the Chrysler Building, but they rarely step forward in public. To do so would only invite derision and disbelief. The Chrysler Building is shorter than its fellow art deco triumph, the Empire State Building (which took its place as the tallest building in the world only a few months after the Chrysler’s completion), but it looks so much more significant. The Chrysler Building is indisputably the gem of the city’s skyline.” Salon 02/25/02\n\nSunday February 24\n\nSAFETY SELLS: Americans may not want to hear it, but evidence suggests that the homegrown works that fetch the highest prices and inspire the most interested bidding at our auction houses are barely distinguishable from the old socialist realist art of the Soviet Union. Complex and beautiful landscapes from the post-impressionist period go for a song, while generic, dime-a-dozen “American realist” paintings rake in the big bucks. European collectors have begun to notice, and are looking to the American auctions as an easy way to snap up great works that are going unnoticed. International Herald-Tribune (Paris) 02/23/02\n\nTHE MODERN CONNOISSEUR: There is a difference between being an art lover and being a connoisseur. The former requires only love of art, the latter a deep understanding of what makes art, what differentiates one artist from another, and the context in which a given work exists. But “connoisseurship looks at the end product, while much contemporary art is process-oriented.” A new exhibition in Boston aims to upgrade the art world’s concept of the connoisseur. Boston Globe 02/24/02\n\nDENVER DONATION: “The Denver Art Museum will have more than a new wing to offer in 2005. An investment banking family has donated a collection of 213 contemporary works that was sought by museums in London and Los Angeles… The gift includes works by Bruce Nauman, James Rosenquist, Antony Gormley and Francesco Clemente, as well as sought-after young artists Damien Hirst, Roxy Paine, Richard Patterson and Cecily Brown.” Baltimore Sun (AP) 02/24/02\n\nHUGHES’ HALLUCINOGENIC REVELATIONS: “IN 1999, a week into filming [a] television series about Australia, the art critic Robert Hughes was involved in a near-fatal car crash. During the five weeks that he lay in a coma in intensive-care, Hughes became intimately acquainted with the Spanish painter Francisco Goya. He was visited by a series of powerful hallucinations more concrete than dreams, more intense than the LSD experiences that he had sampled when he was younger, in which the Spanish painter appeared to be inflicting a prolonged torture on him.” The Telegraph (UK) 02/23/02\n\nTHAT’S ALL, FOLKS: “Oscar-winning cartoon animator Chuck Jones, who brought to life a host of cartoon characters including Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, has died in California of heart failure. He was 89.” BBC 02/23/02\n\nFriday February 22\n\nARNAULT BAILS ON PHILLIPS: When Bernard Arnault’s LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton acquired Phillips auction house in November 1999, “reportedly for $115 million,” Arnault made an aggressive play to overtake the larger but troubled Sotheby’s and Christie’s. It didn’t work, and now the opportunity has apparently passed, so LVMH is selling its stake in Phillips. International Herald Tribune 02/20/02\n\nFOSTER AT THE TOP: Norman Foster is arguably Britain’s most-successful architect ever. “He has achieved this as a modernist architect in a notoriously conservative country, a mere decade after the traditionalism of Prince Charles seemed all-conquering and as an outsider in this allegedly class-ridden land. How? The short answer is talent and determination. Yet these alone cannot explain his appeal to institutions as diverse as the British Museum, Wembley Stadium, Sainsbury’s, the Royal Academy and the mayoralty of London. It would be nice to believe that they have all suddenly converted to beautiful and radical architecture; nice but, alas, not plausible.” Prospect 023/02\n\nThursday February 21\n\nSTOCKHOLM ART THEFT: Five paintings, including a Brueghel, were stolen over the weekend from an arts and antiques fair in Stockholm. “The paintings, worth over £1.7 million, were part of the stock of an international art dealer.” The Guardian (UK) 02/20/02\n\nREOPENING THE MILLENNIUM: More than a year and a half after it opened and then abruptly closed again when an alarming sway was detected, Norman Foster’s Millennium pedestrian bridge across the Thames is to reopen this week. “Engineers claim to have cured the jitter that made the £18.2 million structure, dubbed ‘the blade of light’ by its creators Norman Foster and the artist Anthony Caro, an instant hit.” On the day of its first opening, 160,000 people thronged across it. The sway was in part blamed on the practice of crossing pedestrians to cross in lockstep with one another. The Guardian (UK) 02/20/02\n\nTHE MEANING OF TALL: “Though the music, poetry, painting, discourse, and dance in which cultured New Yorkers take justified pride are rarely born in skyscrapers, we’re forced to ask again what these steel, glass, and stone behemoths contribute to the life of this city. The atrocities committed by Al Qaeda magnified our awareness of the precious contents of what might appear at first as mere mountains starkly rising from the landscape.” Village Voice 02/20/02\n\nWednesday February 20\n\nTHOSE KANSANS, ALWAYS STEALING 20TH CENTURY MASTERPIECES: “A painting found in a Kansas postroom last month has been authenticated as a Marc Chagall stolen last year from the Jewish Museum in New York. The Russian painter’s Study for Over Vitebsk, is believed to be worth $1 million.” BBC 02/20/02\n\nCLOSE CALLS: Art historians have weighed in on David Hockney’s theory that great artists used a mechanical device to aid their plotting of pictures. But Chuck Close, an artist who knows a thing or two about projecting portraits over large surfaces says: “It doesn’"
