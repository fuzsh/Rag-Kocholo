        "text": "If you are a faithful reader of this blog then you will be aware that I was born and raised on the east coast of Canada on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. I grew up with the sound of the fog horn’s lullaby, the smell of the salt air and knowledge and humility that comes with living beside something as mighty as the Atlantic Ocean. My home town of Glace Bay was a coastal town. Both of our main industries were heavily influenced by the sea and the geography that it helped to form. If you didn’t work in the fishing and coal mining industries yourself then you certainly knew dozens of people who did. Glace Bay wasn’t a fancy town by any stretch. It was populated with good people who worked hard to make a living for their families. The rugged nature of the land in combination with the blue collar nature of many of the folks who lived there helped to form a proud cultural backdrop to much of the poetry, music and art that was created while I was growing up as a proud Cape Bretoner myself. Singers like Rita MacNeil, Bruce Guthro, Matt MInglewood and others along with bands such as the Rankin Family, The Barra MacNeils and Glace Bay’s own the coal mining chorale, The Men of the Deeps all sang songs about the sea, about the sense of community that existed on the island and about the history of how it all came to be. There was a universality to the music that caused me to believe that it all aligned with the core values of what was meant to be a Canadian. When I left Cape Breton Island for the greener pastures of larger centres, I took that Cape Breton culture with me. It doesn’t matter how long I have been away, I still tear up whenever I hear the song “We Are An Island” no matter who happens to be singing it at the time. That anthem of my island is embedded in my soul. No amount of wandering can change that.\n\nI thought a lot about this in relation to the subject of today’s post, Corb Lund. Lund was born and raised in Taber, Alberta. Taber is actually twice as close to the Canada-U.S. border crossing at Coutts, Alberta than it is to the nearest major Canadian city of Calgary. Lund’s parents came to Taber as part of a series of cattle migrations that saw species such as highland cows moved from the U.S. midwest up into Canada. Taber, Alberta is a farming community and is specifically known for its corn. In fact, Taber is considered by many to be the corn growing capital of the world. Not surprisingly, Corb Lund grew up on a farm. Lund, like many of the people in his family and his social circle, have lived the farming life for generations. They know the fundamentals of soil and irrigation the same way that the people from my hometown know the sea and the tides. Corb Lund grew up working with his hands and like many children who grew up on a farm, he grew into a man who was very big and strong and capable of fixing things on his own. There is something about the vastness of prairie farmland and the big sky nature of daily life that has often caused many a young farm person’s thoughts to turn toward music. The most common manifestation of that is how closely Country and Western music is associated with farmers and cowboys and with working class life on the land. That many famous Country singers have donned cowboy hats, for example, further solidifies that genre’s connection to those who make their living in this world from the land. The funny thing about Corb Lund was that, initially, he did not gravitate toward a career on the land nor in Country and Western music. When Corb Lund was a teenager, he and a friend set off in search of a musical education. They ended up five hours to the north in Edmonton at a school known for, of all things, Jazz music. Although Jazz was not the genre that interested him, Corb Lund was happy to have left Taber and find himself in a city that was bigger and offered more diversions and opportunities. One of the things that Edmonton had over Taber was the sheer number of bars and nightclubs that offered live music. At one of those nightclubs, Lund found himself at a punk rock show. As you may know from my series on punk rock Who’s Punk?! What’s the Score?!, the ethos of the punk rock scene was often DIY in nature. Bands handled their own staging, promotions, sound and lights, merch. sales and so on. In that way, they remained in control of the music they produced and eliminated the corporate interference that came with signing major label record deals. The show that Corb Lund had wandered into was a concert by Edmonton punk legends SNFU. The lead singer of SNFU was a man named Ken Chinn who went by the stage name Chi Pig. ***(Chi Pig recently passed away. His death was mourned in Edmonton as a great loss. You can read an article about his legacy here . This article is from a website known as Broke-Ass Stuart’s Website which you can reach here). The experience of watching that concert changed Corb Lund’s life in a very profound and fundamental way. Prior to that SNFU show, Lund had laboured under the belief that creating music and reaching an audience was some mysterious process that required the help of music executives and other folks with specialized skills. Up until the SNFU show, Lund had never realized that absolutely anyone could make music and that there was an audience for every type of music as long as that music came from the heart. If the music you created was good and your skills were sharp enough then people would find you. It really was as simple as that.\n\nImpressed with what he learned at the SNFU show, Corb Lund and his buddies decided to form their own punk band and head out on the road. Lund’s punk band was called The Smalls. This band became such a cult favourite in Alberta and western Canada that they became the subject of a feature documentary called The Smalls: Forever is a Long Time. *(you can watch the trailer for that documentary here). The Smalls toured relentlessly, as many smaller bands do. But instead of touring from east to west, as Canada is defined geographically, The Smalls toured north to south. They were equally as popular in American border states like Wyoming, Colorado and Montana as they were in the Canadian prairies. However, after touring for a while, it started becoming clear to Corb Lund that the potential for growth for a prairie punk band like The Smalls was limited. They were popular but not likely to grow much beyond what they had already achieved. As Lund was thinking these thoughts, he began to notice that many of his punk contemporaries were starting to incorporate acoustic guitars into their shows and their songwriting. Punk was definitely taking on a country air. Corb Lund saw this as a sign that his music could be more that speed metal and thrashing guitars. So he decided to end his time with The Smalls and launch a solo career that would be filled with music that drew on Jazz, Country and Rock music elements. This transition happened also around the same time as a band from Hanna, Alberta (just up the road a bit from Taber) called Nickelback was starting to gain some traction in the world of music. While Nickelback opted to head in a more straight-forward rock direction, Corb Lund turned toward country and western music. That decision has been one of the best of his life. He is now considered to be one of, if not, the biggest music star in Canadian Country music today.\n\nOne of the things that helped Corb Lund and his band the Hurtin’ Albertans to gain an audience was the authenticity of their music. The bands I grew up listening to back home like The Rankin Family all sang of people, places and events that had some personal, geographical or historical connection to the island of Cape Breton, to the ocean and to the Maritime provinces, in general. That band earned the respect of thousands of Maritime Canadians because we knew that what they sang about was true. Their music corresponded to the reality of the lives that we actually were living. The truth behind their music was very real. Take that regional truth and apply it to the farming/oil production world of Alberta and, instead of The Rankins, you have Corb Lund.\n\nCorb Lund rose to the top of his field because he wrote songs that were about people, places and subjects that arose from the lives of the real people who lived in Alberta and the Prairies. It is not for nothing that Lund has songs about highland cows, oil rig workers and farmers in his discography. To date in his solo career, Lund has recorded eleven albums and has three Gold records. He performs everywhere in Canada and the world but has the most success emulating the path trod by The Smalls, using the north-south farmland corridor that exists in North America. He is also very popular in Australia where there is a long history of farming, too. The song that I have chosen for today’s post is called “Truck Got Stuck”. I find this song to be hilarious. I don’t know Lund enough to know if comedy was the intent here but, regardless, this song makes me giggle. It is a simple story concept that centres on a pickup truck getting stuck in the mud on a farm after a sudden downpour of rain. One farm boy after another all show up with their own trucks to help pull the original truck out of the mud. But, one after the other, the new arrivals get their trucks stuck, too. While “Truck Got Stuck” comes off as a humorous song, it also draws upon several real truths of life in Taber, Alberta and in communities all across the prairies. For example, the community feel to life in a farming town is accurately portrayed. When someone needs help and sends out a call for assistance, your friends and neighbours arrive to help. That is part of the cultural glue that makes small farming towns the close knit communities they tend to be. The fact that rain and soil conditions come into play also highlights a fact of life on a farm. Farms need rain but too much rain is not a good thing, either. This is not the throw-away plot element that it may seem to be at first. In these times of climate change, the future of agriculture in Canada is not as stable and secure as it once was. Rain and soil is as important to an Albertan as rising sea levels are to a Maritimer. Finally, the song closes by taking a shot at a federal government agency known as Agriculture Canada. It is true that many residents of the prairies hold a somewhat less than enthusiastic view of the Feds who make their rules from far away in Central Canada. That sentiment finds a place in the closing lines of “Truck Got Stuck”. As a result, this humorous song ends up cutting a little closer to the bone than it may appear upon first listen. Once again, Corb Lund’s lyrics ring true.\n\nWhile Canada may be a geographically large country, it features elements of regionalism that help to define individual areas. Good people are good people no matter where they all live but the issues that affect us in Ontario are not always the same as those in the Prairies nor the same as those on the east coast or west of the Rockies or way up north in the Arctic. Sometimes I find myself getting caught up in my own interpretation of regionalism with my Cape Breton sensibilities. As genuine as those feelings may be, I am sure that Corb Lund and his fan base would have views that differ from mine but which would be just as valid as anything I have experienced and know to be true. It behooves us all to keep this in mind as a new general election draws near. There are those seeking the office of Prime Minister who would seek to prey upon those regional differences to pit people and political parties against one another. That needn’t be the case. I have always believed that learning new things from people who live differently than I do is one way I grow as a human. Thus, I listen to the music of Corb Lund as he sings about oil rigs and cattle and, instead of shaking my head at it all because it doesn’t reflect my reality, I slow down, allowing him the opportunity to paint a picture of those good people from his world for me. As a result, I grow a little. Growing up on Cape Breton Island taught me to have respect for those who toil with their hands and backs each day. Honest work is honest work, whether it takes place in a coal mine or a fishing trawler or a wheat field or a cattle ranch or an oil rig. I respect the effort involved and the people who make it. Thus, I enjoy the music of Corb Lund, even though it is not my standard musical fare. Lund makes good music that serves to tell the stories of the people in his world. He does so with humour, with attention to detail and with respect. The success that he has achieved speaks for itself. He is one of Canada’s most prolific music stars for a reason.\n\nThe link to the official website for Corb Lund can be found here.\n\nThe link to the video for the song “The Truck Got Stuck” by Corb und and the Hurtin’ Albertans can be found here. ***The lyrics version is here.\n\nThe official website for The Smalls can be found here.\n\nThe link to the official website for the town of Taber, Alberta can be found here.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.

The end of the school year is a funny time for all whose lives revolve around bells and timetables. Slightly over a decade ago I attempted to put into words the mixture of emotions that teachers feel as the final days of such an intense personal and collective journey draw to their conclusion. Way back in my days on Blogger, I wrote these words. Please give them a quick read.\n\nJune and July\n\nIt is the day after the last day of school.\n\nI am sitting at my desk in my classroom. Except for me, the room is empty. It is very quiet.\n\nAs I look out at the room, it seems hard to believe that, a mere 24 hours ago, this space was filled with the energy, words and body heat of my students. Yesterday, this space was a beehive of activity and excitement and anxiety as the kids shared their last social moments together before heading off on their separate ways for the summer break. Today, there is no one here who requires my counsel, my knowledge or my sense of calm to take the edge off their own amped up sensibilities. Today, I am left alone with my thoughts. My time is my own.\n\nI tidy the papers on my desk for the final time.\n\nBefore me sit the remnants of a frenetic last month of activity: results from school-level and area track and field meets (I coached the running events), a programme from the closing awards ceremony (where I presented eight awards), the agenda from our last staff meeting (where we discussed teaching assignments for next year, extra-curricular responsibilities, school-wide academic goals and so on), my class list for next year, as well as the class lists that contain the names of my students from this year, all neatly divided up and sorted into what are, hopefully, workable pairings/groups based on ability, social compatibility and gender, my copy of the consumable order (pencils, pens, paper, notebooks, etc.) which has already arrived, been inventoried and stored away in freshly dusted cupboards, and a sheaf of permission forms for the students to travel to the end of the year school picnic that I helped to organize down at the park by the waterfront.\n\nMost importantly, I have my final academic report cards to sign and file. That truly closes out the year. Our shared journey together ends with my assessment of their accomplishments (or lack thereof) and, in doing so, my own assessment of how successful my year as their teacher has been. In neat, organized little boxes sit paragraphs of pronouncements on the state of each child’s personal evolution and, at the end, the letters of reaction from their parents once the report cards had gone home. Meetings of concern or complaint have, by now, been held and dealt with as best suited each situation. Discussions have been held, strategies mapped out and arrangements made for those students who require extra support for the coming year. I have notes from students asking, privately and nervously, who their teacher will be for the coming year, will they be in the same class as their friends, what is the state of their marks? I have assuaged their anxiety as best I could, but now, all of the unknowns are known and the residue of their relieved or bitter responses blanket my mind and my heart.\n\nIt always comes down to this.\n\nA school year, whose foundation is built upon personal trust between teachers and students, culminates in a crescendo of emotions ranging from gratitude to anger to indifference on behalf of those whose world you were the center of mere days ago. The evidence of this human interaction lays in piles of papers on my dusty desk, awaiting their time to be filed and stored in a secure location. In a year or two, I will stumble upon these track and field results and wonder why I bothered to keep them, but, for now, they are evidence of my purpose as an educator and my relationship with the students whose lives I am purported to have touched.\n\nSo, in the solitude of my room, I file and tidy until my desktop is bare.\n\nThe bulletin boards have been stripped during the past few weeks. The students’ desks have been emptied and stacked neatly in one corner of the room, revealing an always surprisingly large amount of floor space. The bookshelves have been dusted, book bins sorted and wiped. Art supplies, cleaned and kept, or else discarded, depending on their state. Science equipment, put back from whence it came behind cupboard doors. The floor swept. Curtains drawn. Computers powered down. Whiteboards erased. Everything is done. Nothing remains here for me to do.\n\nI am no one’s teacher any longer. It is time for Mr. MacInnes to go home.\n\nThe school year always begins with an empty classroom, a teacher and groups of young boys and girls. And, so it ends, with a teacher and the ghosts of those relationships.\n\nI take one last look around the classroom that has been home to so much activity and marvel at how peaceful and serene it all appears to me now. It is so, so quiet. And empty.\n\nThere is nothing left to do.\n\nI gather up the dusty family photos that sat atop my desk all year, wipe them clean and pack them for home.\n\nI close the door.\n\nExit the building.\n\nWalk into the warm sunshine of summer.\n\nAlone.\n\nSilently.\n\nThis is always how it begins. This thing we call Summer.\n\nJune and July by Tom MacInnes, 2014.\n\nAs much as I always found the annual summertime transition from classroom teacher to regular Joe to be somewhat disorienting, it is nothing compared to what my eldest daughter Leah is about to experience. A few days from now, she will graduate from high school. As milestones go in life, this is one of the bigger ones along the way. The end of highschool marks the symbolic end of childhood. The acceptance of that graduation diploma represents the proverbial cutting of strings from the mittens of each person who began their school career as a child wearing rubber boots and a backpack covered in cartoon characters, wanting nothing more from life than to read a good book, have fun with their friends and maybe enjoy a cold chocolate milk along the way. Now, when that walk across the graduation stage is over and the applause has subsided and the photos have been snapped, what awaits is the world of adulthood. The responsibility that comes with accepting that graduation diploma is nothing less than the awesome task of saving the planet from overheating and our species from becoming extinct. For my daughter, I would be equally happy if she simply lived a happy, healthy life and got to experience how love feels when it finds your heart.\n\nNeedless to say, as graduation draws near, we are all filled with the mixed emotions that arise when faced with change. We have always been a family that functions best on organization and routine. We take comfort in predictability. For that reason, it is not surprising that we have all been engaging in doses of wistful nostalgia lately. Our lives together as a family have been good so far. Our memories are mainly happy ones. It is because of those trips down memory lane that we arrive at today’s latest pit stop on the Great Canadian Road Trip, a small but special place known to us as the Merwin Greer woods.\n\nAs new parents, you are faced with an avalanche of life-altering decisions with regard to the health and happiness of your newborn child. Some of those decisions can be researched and arrived at with a fair degree of confidence that the choice you have made for your child is a good one. However, some other choices are made in a more random fashion with the hope that it will all somehow work out for the best in the end. This is sorta, kinda what happened when it came time for our eldest daughter to start her school career. I know that some parents “shop” for schools that they feel will give their child some sort of competitive advantage in life. For us, we basically had a simple choice between two schools. One school had a population of over 800 students and offered French Immersion programming. The other school was a small community school that was actually the one within the neighbourhood boundary in which we lived. That school has never had much more than 100 students the whole time we have lived in our home. It also did not offer French Immersion programming. After some consideration of the pros and cons of each school, we opted for the smaller community school experience. While our daughter bemoans not having a level of fluency in French that would have come with enrolment at the larger school, we, as her parents, have never regretted our decision. The small community school experience was wonderful for both of our girls. We loved the staff at the girls’ school. We loved getting to know the other families who made up that school community. We also liked that both of our daughters established good relationships with their classmates and also with their teachers. All things considered, the memories of elementary school that both girls possess are warm ones. This brings us to today’s song, “Jackpot”, by Jocelyn Alice.\n\nJocelyn Alice is a Calgary born singer who has had one Top 40 hit in her career, and “Jackpot” is that song. She originally gained fame as a contestant on a pre-American Idol style talent show called Popstars, finishing in the runner-up spot the year she competed. Alice decided to give a career in singing a go and formed a band with a friend of hers that they called Jocelyn and Lisa. That partnership failed to make it in the world of music, so Jocelyn Alice opted to try out a solo career. On her debut album released in 2016 was a song called “Jackpot”. It cracked the Top 40 in Canada and the U.S. and earned her an invitation to sing the Canadian national anthem at the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star game in Miami. Unfortunately, Alice botched the anthem by giggling throughout it. She received much criticism and has yet to be heard from again on a national scale. If “Jackpot” remains as the only song of hers to earn airplay, then it will have been worth it for no other reason than that this song has meaning for my eldest daughter. It is meaning that is coming into play as her graduation date draws near.\n\nOne of the things that Leah associates with her time at her tiny elementary school is safety. I don’t use that word in terms of a fear of dangerous things happening. That school was a bucolic setting if there ever was one. There was nothing to worry about in terms of violence or bullying. Instead, when I mention the word safety, I am talking about the emotional warmth that comes from spending time with good people who care about your wellbeing. That is the key attribute that helped make our children’s elementary school experience so valuable. They spent their formative days in an environment where everyone knew everybody else, and there was always someone there who cared about you and how you were feeling. As part of her time there, Leah has fond memories of the role music played in establishing that sense of community. Music was played at assemblies, during Christmas concerts put on for the school community, during celebrations for birthdays and the birth of new babies, as well as when fundraising rallies were held for a teacher who had developed cancer. Songs such as “Brave” by Sara Bareilles, “Fight Song” by Rachel Platten, “Celebration” by Kool and the Gang, all became songs that formed the soundtrack to those formative years. The staff and teachers at that tiny school knew that music helps create emotions and that as part of their deliberate plan to create a caring atmosphere for children like ours, there would be music played that had meaning for the kids. I wrote a previous post about how the song “That Power” by will i am featuring Justin Beiber was used at school that you can read here.\n\nAnd so it was this past weekend that my two daughters came upstairs at one point muttering and mumbling about a song called “Jackpot”, asking me if I knew it. Leah said that the song was stuck in her head. She insisted that I would recognize the tune if I heard it. So I immediately took her up on that challenge and called the song up on YouTube. She was right. I recognized it immediately, as will you if you choose to give it a listen. “Jackpot” may be Jocelyn Alice’s only hit song, but it was one of those ubiquitous songs of the summer that seem to pop up year after year, and, as such, it is a song that I am sure we will be hearing on the radio at random times for many years to come.\n\nAs for Leah, “Jackpot” was also one of those soundtrack songs from her elementary school career. It is a song that she associates with feelings of warmth and security at a time when a huge life change approaches. As we all know, the one constant in life is change. We all go through periods of transition at various times in our lives. Some of those transitions are familiar, such as the end of the school year was for me. That didn’t make those changes in routine any less jarring as I went through them year after year. But, guess what? I survived them all and have lived to tell the tale in blog posts such as this one. However, other changes are less familiar. They are giant leaps into the unknown. That is more like what Leah is facing as she prepares to walk across that graduation stage in a few days. She has had a safe and happy childhood to this point. We know it, but more importantly, she knows it, too. A period of life that was filled with warm fuzzies concludes with a handshake from her principal, a round of applause from the audience and a series of photos from those who love her most. Then, she walks off that stage and the next phase of life begins. As parents, we are confident that Leah will do well in whatever path she chooses to follow. Leah is not so confident. Straying from the familiar can be scary. The one thing that she needs to remember is how it feels to be loved and to know you are safe and cared for. Part of what will help her to remember those feelings are songs such as “Jackpot” by Jocelyn Alice. We all need songs in our lives that remind us of the good times. “Jackpot” and “Celebration” and “Brave” and “That Power” all do for Leah. I am eternally grateful to the staff at Merwin Greer Public School for giving my daughter the gift of music and linking it with such positive memories that she can take forward with her into adulthood.\n\nOn the very same day that Leah walks across that graduation stage, those teachers at Merwin Greer P.S. will be spending their last day with the students in their own classrooms. It will be a day of parties and assemblies and cupcakes and freezies and, of course, of music. And then, the noise will subside, the students will pack up for the final time, the parents will offer their thank yous as they come to collect their children and then, suddenly, the world will grow still and quiet. Those same teachers will return to their classrooms and tidy them one final time…in solitude. It will seem surreal. Then they will pack up as well and go home to places where no one calls them Mrs. or Mr., simply mom or dad or Honey. Leah and several hundred other students like her will take their bows, pose for photos, be the centre of their own family celebrations, and then their world will still, too. Childhood will be over. The grand adventure that is adulthood awaits. The world will be theirs to enjoy and experience. And, of course, there will be music.\n\nThe link to the video for the song “Jackpot” by Jocelyn Alice can be found here. ***The lyrics version is here.\n\nThe link to the official website for Jocelyn Alice can be found here.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.

This is one of those times.\n\nAs someone who writes a daily blog, it is my job to put the feelings I possess into words. For most of the year, my work focuses on the world of music and manifests itself in the form of blog posts about the stories behind many of the songs that form the soundtrack of our lives. In some of those posts I share stories from my life as a husband and father, as a school teacher and/or as a child growing up on the island of Cape Breton in the province of Nova Scotia. Regular readers of my words should have a fair idea of the type of values I possess based upon the personal connections I make to the world of musical creativity. However, if you are new to my blog, please allow the following story to fill in some of the blank spaces for you. This post is about what Christmas means in Cape Breton. For me, it is what I believe the true essence of Christmas to be and why I believe that Christmas time is the best part of the entire year. Get out your milk and cookies and let me tell you a story about some little old ladies who have got it going on at Christmas time.\n\nMy mother is 92 years old as I type these words. She is a healthy person who scoots around in her wheelchair at the nursing home where she lives as if she was a Formula One race car driver. She goes everywhere allowable and does everything she is invited to partake in yet she remembers almost none of it at all. She still remembers that I am her son. Sometimes she remembers the name of my wife. My daughters are simply referred to as “the girls” but she remembers enough to know that they are growing up and that “Nanna loves them”. The staff at the nursing home where she lives refer to her as a pleasant dementia patient. That label does not surprise me as my mother has always been a kind, caring and generous person throughout her life. She has always been well-regarded by those who came to know her. Everyone considers her to be a good person and a true friend.\n\nBefore moving into the nursing home this past Spring, my mother spent the previous ten years of her life living in an assisted living retirement complex. An assisted living lifestyle is one in which residents have their own apartments and spend the day as they see fit. However, their meals are prepared for them, a nurse visits them daily or weekly as needed, housekeeping services are provided and so on. It is independent living but with assistance. While at her assisted living complex, my mother made many new friends. Visiting her on my own or with my own family usually meant visiting with my mom’s extended assisted living community of friends as well. That was ok. If you can imagine what it would feel like to be taken into the warm embrace of an entire building filled with grandmothers then you might have some idea of what the atmosphere was like whenever I/we came home. Not only was it nice to be welcomed so warmly, it was also nice to see how popular my mother was and how so many people valued her for who she was.\n\nNeedless to say, these same grandmothers who cared about my mother so much were also well aware that dementia was slowly encroaching on her mind. They were all very protective of her when it came to making sure she remembered to come to dinner in the dining room or to put out her garbage on trash day. They were also very quick to pull me aside for hushed conversations whenever I came home. They were worried about how long my mother was going to be able to safely stay in their midst. One of the things that you come to know if you are living in a retirement complex of any sort is that people come and go as their health inevitably declines. But because my mother had been there for almost a full decade, she was viewed as a fixture in the building. Thus, when the time came one day that she fell and broke her hip, the fact that she was taken away by ambulance and never came back (because of how far her dementia had progressed) shook those who remained behind.\n\nWhen the doctors informed us that my mother required permanent care and could not ever go back to her assisted living complex, it necessitated a trip down to deal with her belongings and clear out her apartment. I took my youngest daughter Sophie with me. She is an excellent worker and organizer and I knew she would be a big help. For eleven consecutive days we worked our way through every closest, dresser drawer and cupboard. We quickly learned a lot about how my mother viewed the world based upon the things she held on to as she aged. Almost all of it dealt with her relationships with the people in her life. We found birth announcements and obituaries, marriage licenses and death certificates, Christmas cards, pictures drawn by my girls when they were toddlers, newspaper articles about some of the good things that happened to Cape Breton over the years and on and on it went. All of it was uplifting and positive and came from her heart or else was something that had touched her heart. If this story only involved the things that Sophie and I found while performing our familial duties then it still would have been enough of a memory to have lasted us a lifetime. But there was more and better things to come.\n\nWe didn’t toil away in isolation. When word spread that “Tommy and Sophie” were down to clean out the apartment, the league of grandmothers sprang into action. One by one, they stopped by to say hello and introduce themselves to Sophie. As each lady darkened our door, they made sure to tell Sophie about who her grandmother was, some of the ways that she made a difference in their life and how lucky they all were to have known her. For Sophie, who only really knew her Nanna as an old lady that she saw once or twice a year, the gift of this information was priceless. It went a long way toward helping her develop a richer, more realistic picture of who her Nanna was. As the days went by, Sophie began to even recognize some aspects of her own personality as being connected with my mother. I do believe that her teenage heart grew as a result.\n\nWhile there were many grandmothers who took the time to stop by the apartment as we worked, there was one lady with whom Sophie formed a special bond. That lady was the person who lived across the hall from my mother. Her name was Stella. Stella was one of the ladies with whom my mother spent the most time. They visited every day; chatting away about family and past memories, watching TV together and sharing a cup of tea of two as well. It was Stella, along with another grandmother on the same floor, who found my mother the day she fell and broke her hip. It was Stella who came to us in tears that first day we were down, apologizing for not having found my mother sooner and for having done more for her before her final day at the assisted living complex arrived. Stella was a great friend to my mother for a number of years. She needn’t have apologized for anything. Her friendship with my mother was a priceless treasure. The entire time that Sophie and I worked, Stella would come over and offer us a cool treat or a drink. We declined most of the time but some times we would stop what we were doing and have a visit with her in her apartment. That made her feel important. It made Sophie feel special to be doted upon by a grandmotherly figure such as Stella. A new friendship blossomed before my very eyes. Stella and Sophie have since become penpals. She just received a letter from Stella last week (as I write these words).\n\nAs Sophie and I worked away, we often had to make decisions as to what to do with various possessions that we came across. While we donated many to charities in the area and trashed a lot more (including using a shredding machine to destroy any documents that contained account numbers or personal information), we also thought that some of the grandmothers who knew my mother might want something of hers to help remember her by. For many, that meant receiving a small doll, as my mother was a doll collector and loved her dolls almost as much as she loved her family. One lady asked for her electric kettle because she associated knowing my mom with having good hot tea. One lady asked for the rocking chair that she always saw my mother sitting in. To everyone who asked, we gave them something that we felt they would appreciate. Stella asked for nothing. Sophie and I decided that we weren’t going to leave a grieving friend without anything. In time, we knew what we wanted to do.\n\nMy mother loved Christmas. As children, my sister and I grew up in a house with the smell of pine Christmas trees and baked goods wafting through our home. There were candles in the windows, tinsel on the tree and a mountain of gifts for us to open on Christmas Day. Friends and family came to call and invited us to come to their homes as well. Carols played. We went to church. And every day Christmas cards came in the mail. We always had over one hundred festive cards hung on lengths of string or else taped to the walls of our living room for all to see when they visited us. Most of all, I remember the feeling of warmth and togetherness that seemed extra intense at Christmas time. I feel soooooo lucky to have grown up in this atmosphere.\n\nNot surprisingly, my mother loved collecting Christmas ornaments. About one hour from our home in the village of St. Peters there used to exist a store that sold Christmas merchandise all year round. My mother loved that store. One of her proudest purchases from the Christmas Store in St. Peters was a set of ceramic figurines. One was a set of snow people, all decked out in sky blue scarves and toques. The other was a couple: Santa and Mrs. Claus. For the last thirty or forty years of her life, my mother took those ceramic figurines with her everywhere she lived, including when she moved into her assisted living complex. All ten years of her stay there saw those figurines brought out of closets and displayed for everyone to see at Christmas time. Even as her world shrank as she aged, it was figurines such as those that connected her to her past, when life was full and she was truly independent. So as Sophie and I came across those figurines and I shared their significance with her, we both knew what it was that we were going to give to Stella.\n\nStella, too, knew what Santa and Mrs. Claus meant to my mother and was almost too overwhelmed to accept them but in the end she did. She promised to take them out and display them every Christmas that she was able to do so going forward. Last night I received an email from her daughter who had stopped by for a visit. Included in that email was the photo you see at the top of this post. Those figurines at the foot of that Christmas tree are the ones that used to belong to my mother. This tree is located in the main foyer of the assisted living complex. The chairs around the tree are where many of the grandmothers would gather mid-afternoon to discuss the events of the day. By placing Santa and Mrs. Claus there, Stella has ensured that my mother is remembered by those who were her friends for so many years.\n\nMemories are wonderful things at times. I have promised Stella and her daughter that I will show my own mother that photo when I come down to see her this week. I braced them for the fact that I cannot guarantee that my mother will understand what she is looking at. But even though dementia is a cruel disease, I am still willing to bet that seeing Santa and Mrs Claus will bring a smile to her face. The magic of Christmas remains real…at least for one more year. While I am home I will stop in and visit with the grandmothers at the assisted living complex and I will stop in to see Stella personally and pass on the Christmas card that Sophie is working on as you read these words.\n\nWhen I try to describe what it was like to grow up in Cape Breton at Christmas time, this story is as close as I can get to showing it to you. No gifts were exchanged, only gestures of love and kindness and remembrance. That spirit of doing for others is fully present in this act by Stella and the others. My mom will probably never know what Stella and her friends have done in her honour but she will feel that love through the fog of her mind I guarantee it. The grandmothers will feel better for having engaged in an act of compassion and humanity for a kind soul who could use a heartfelt hug. So even though my childhood tree was always crammed with gifts and my stocking was always full, the thing that I always, always, always remember most about Christmas in Cape Breton was the love. Always the love.\n\nNOTE: Today’s post is the one you just read. Tomorrow and Wednesday I will have new holiday-themed music posts. Thursday and Friday I will be with my mother for an early Christmas visit so no posts on those days. I will be back and ready to create new music posts to lead everyone into the holidays the next Monday.\n\nTechnology and Information: Part #5\n\nI have devoted a large portion of the last few years of my life to writing about music. I really came of age as a music blogger while working on a series entitled The Top 500 Songs in Modern Music History. This series looked at the stories behind 500 songs compiled by Rolling Stone Magazine, along with radio station KEXP FM from Seattle. Writing the five hundred posts that made up this series took some time but it was a whole lot of fun. One of the best things about doing such a project was the interactivity I enjoyed with my readers. Since these were some of the most popular and important songs ever recorded in modern music history, many of them resonated with readers who, in turn, happily shared their own stories relating to each song. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the comments that came after each post was published just as much as I did creating each post in the first place. By the time the countdown was nearing its conclusion I had decided that I wanted to share the conclusion of the series with those who had followed along and contributed so much. So, I contacted the twenty five readers who had made the greatest number of comments throughout the series and asked them to nominate their own favourite song. This song would become known as an Honourable Mention song. The only conditions I put in place were that the nominated song couldn’t be one that I had previously written about during the countdown and that I wanted each person to tell me a little bit about what their song meant to them. One of the twenty five people that I reached out to was a woman from Vancouver named JoAnne Teal. The song she nominated was “Round Here” by The Counting Crows. *(You can read that post here. In that post I describe how JoAnne and I came to know each other and what having her in my life meant to me). JoAnne has been a treasured friend for over the past fifteen or so years. She is someone who I considered a mentor as well as a muse. She was a gentle soul and a truly lovely person. Yesterday I discovered that she had passed away. Today’s post is a tribute to someone who made the world a better place simply by being herself. But her death is also a cautionary tale that has much to do with technology and how we live so much of our lives online these days. God Bless you JoAnne and thank you for taking a shine to a meat and potatoes writer like me. I miss you tons. Here is what happened.\n\nI have spent a lot of time this past week writing about social media and the dangers inherent in investing too much of ourselves into the products created by companies such as Twitter and Facebook. With Twitter and Facebook, I have talked a lot about how they operate using algorithms that track your habits and interests and then tailor content for you. In doing so, you don’t get to see all of the available content being created by those you follow. Instead, you get a version of reality that is tailored for you. One of the things that happens on Facebook in particular is that, every now and again, you will notice that certain “friends” that you follow have stopped appearing on your feed. The reason for this is that what they are posting doesn’t match your algorithm formula and, consequently, they drop off of your feed. With that in mind, in the past week or so I found myself thinking about JoAnne. Specifically, I had begun to notice that she didn’t seem to be interacting with me anymore. I felt that this was odd but, Facebook being Facebook, I figured that she had fallen off of the feed as people sometimes do and that was all there was to that. JoAnne had recently retired from her job with the Alzheimer’s Society in British Columbia and had taken up the popular puzzle game Wordle. Much of our recent interactions had been related to how we had each managed to do with the daily Wordle puzzle. Yesterday I decided that enough was enough and that it was time to click on my friend’s name and see what she had been up to lately and drop in for a Facebook Messenger chat.\n\nSo I logged into Facebook. I went to the search bar at the top of the screen and began typing in her name. I was expecting her name to appear on the list of names that appeared on the drop-down menu as soon as I typed in the letter “J” but such was not the case. I spelled her name completely out. She was nowhere to be found on the search list. I re-typed her name using different variations of JoAnne i.e., “Joanne” and “Jo-anne” but no luck there, either. I called up my own “Friends” list and scrolled through it from top to bottom. She wasn’t listed. That was odd. I took her absence from my own list to mean that she had unfriended me (which would have been devastating in its own way) or else that JoAnne had already done what so many others have been thinking of and had closed out her account. In order to check to see if she was still on Facebook, I selected the name of a mutual writer pal and friend named Kern Windraith. Surely JoAnne would still be on Kern’s list even if she wasn’t on mine any longer. But she was nowhere to be found on Kern’s list either. This led me to try one last ditch maneuver which was to follow my own advice from yesterday’s post and stop using Facebook as a middleman in my search and instead, go directly to JoAnne’s own fabulous blog. Once I clicked on the link to her blog (that you can click on if you read the Counting Crows post from above), I found that her blog had changed from containing all of her beautiful, beautiful writing into something that now was an apparel website called JTealWriter of all things. I tried to find her using the Google search engine, all to no avail. Now I began to fear the worst. So I circled back to Facebook and contacted Kern about my concerns. It was Kern who broke the news to me later that night. Our friend was dead and gone. The most disconcerting thing about it was what happened to her legacy.\n\nAll of us….you as well as me….have all slowly but surely have allowed technology to become intertwined with the very core of who we are. Just think of all the email messages we have saved online or the family photographs that we store “on the Cloud” for safekeeping. Consider all of the social interactions you have had with friends and family because of things you have posted on Facebook or Instagram or some other social media site. And if you are someone who writes for a living or as a hobby, consider the amount of your work that only exists in digital form on a website like Facebook or a writing site like WordPress. I have written almost 900 blog posts since I have retired. None of them exist on paper in the real world. They are all archived digitally through WordPress. In the case of JoAnne Teal, Kern was not sure if it was via wishes left in her Will or simply the actions of family members left behind but, all of JoAnne’s social media presence was deleted and scrubbed clean. All of her wonderful stories on her blog have been removed. Her Facebook account was closed and all posts and comments erased. I cannot even find an image of her online to place in this post of remembrance. The extent of the erasure of her online presence even extends to the comments that she left on my posts over the years. This includes the one she left on the Counting Crows post thanking me for including her in the countdown and talking about why “Round Here” mattered to her. All of her supportive comments that she gave to me over the years with regard to my own writing have disappeared too. Poof! Just like that! Gone! If I found myself on the witness stand in a court of law and had to prove that my fifteen year relationship with JoAnne was real, I would be hard pressed to be able to do so. I never met JoAnne in person. We never shook hands or hugged. I never spoke to her in real life so I don’t even know the sound of her voice. I don’t know if she wore perfume or if she was shorter or taller than me or the same height as me. For all intent and purposes as you read these words, it is as if JoAnne Teal never existed. Maybe she didn’t. Maybe this life I think I am leading is actually just like the movie The Matrix and I am really laying in a pod plugged into some machine that siphons away my life energy to fuel other sentient beings. How else can I explain how someone who seemed so special and to whom I gave my friendship and respect could so completely and utterly cease to be?! I believe that JoAnne was real. But my belief is shaken or as we sometimes say in my house, I am shooketh.\n\nThe bigger picture lesson to take from this is how easily someone’s identity can be erased and eliminated. Because we have all invested so much of ourselves and our lives into our online existence, we find ourselves precariously close to losing everything we value with a few clicks of a computer mouse. It clearly shows just how fragile our grip is on the lives which we think we are leading. Let’s take this a step further and say that Facebook and the Federal Government continue to be at loggerheads and Facebook were to threaten to lock out Canadian account holders from using their platform. How much precious personal information or photographs or correspondence would you lose in a heartbeat? How would you ever get it all back? Do you have hard copies of your family photographs anymore? We could extrapolate this out to show how easily hostile governments/leaders could control your identity, too. I am sure that my lovely friend JoAnne was a real person who lived and breathed and talked and slept but I am at a loss to prove that to you today because of what has happened to her online presence which is completely gone.\n\nThis brings up two additional points. On a related but different note, you may be aware that there is a new Beatles song that has just been released called “Now and Then”. There is a video that I will link to at the bottom of this post that describes how the song came to be known as the last Beatles song. The short strokes are that the song was created using a demo cassette tape that John Lennon had recorded on a homemade tape recorder after he and Yoko Ono had moved to New York City. The tape was not a professional endeavour by any stretch. However, with new technology that was available today, Peter Jackson (who directed The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as well as the Beatles documentary called Get Back) was able to lift John Lennon’s voice off of this cassette tape, polish the sound quality up and mix it into new recordings of other instrumental parts recorded this year by Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr and, just like that, the world has a “new” Beatles song to enjoy. I know that for many fans, being able to hear John Lennon sing again will seem like a treasured gift. However, as Goerge Harrison says aloud in the video for this song, “We might be opening up a can of worms” by taking a snippet of someone’s voice that was never meant to be heard and turning that into new music in that person’s name. What I think of the quality of the song is not as important as how it was made. I agree with Harrison that the use of technology to create new realities is frightening. Just like the way the Internet initially was a wonderful step forward to society, what was done to create the new Beatles song could, if used by bad actors, create a whole myriad of problems in the future. History can be rewritten on a whim. Whole new portions of history can be altered to seem real. US Presidents could be made to give speeches espousing the benefits of slavery, for one small example. Anything is possible with the technology used to make a simple song come to life. It is truly a case of Frankenstein’s monster. And we know that didn’t end well.\n\nThe second and final aspect of how modern technology impacts identity and history can be found in the existence of an entity many of you will be familiar with and that is our friend, Siri (or Alexa, if you are a Google customer). You may know that Siri is the automated virtual assistant who exists within your computer. Many people like to consult with Siri about such things as what the temperature is outside or how to spell a word or if Siri will start a certain playlist of music for them. As a virtual assistant, Siri/Alexa appear to be tools that we can summon and dismiss as we see fit. But have you ever wondered if Siri is spying on you? I am pretty sure that Siri’s technology is actively listening to everything that goes on in my home. There have been dozens of times when, as a family, we have been eating dinner or watching television together and chatting away as we do. Suddenly, without any of us having our phones, iPads or computers up and running, Siri will self-activate to join our conversation. In each of those instances, we have never summoned Siri nor mentioned Siri’s name. We were just talking between ourselves only to have Siri join us in a manner that is appropriate for our conversation which says to me that Siri was listening all along. On the one hand, this is a gross invasion of privacy that has been foisted upon us because of our reliance on technology to do so many of the everyday things that we do. That we willingly bring listening devices into our homes and freely disclose our personal information in front of these devices seems crazy to think about. But we all do it, every day, all of the time. The other side to this situation is that if, in fact, Siri/Alexa are recording every single utterance being made 24/7 in our homes then somewhere in the world exists a precious historical record of each of our lives. I am not sure why someone in a basement office somewhere would care about archiving the making of the MacInnes Family’s grocery lists or our discussions about how school went that day but the possibility realistically exists that this information has been recorded and is being kept somewhere by someone for purposes unknown. It would be wonderful to get a print out of our lives together with the ones we love. That book would be a thick one for sure!\n\nIn the case of my friend JoAnne and The Beatles and with Siri/Alexa, the history of our lives is rife for manipulation and abuse. I would like to be optimistic and say that it is also set up for positive purposes such as the celebration of a life lived with dignity and grace and purpose like that of my friend JoAnne, too. For now, we have to anticipate the worst case scenario of having our memories erased at the click of some benevolent overlord’s computer button or else having our memories and information held for ransom by cyber thieves. In these cases, it behooves us to take steps to ensure that we have our own hard copies of those photos, certificates and other documents and conversations that have value to us and to those who love us. I know that Facebook enables you to download your history which, I hope, includes actual transcripts of conversations you have with friends and family, videos clips, photos and so on. It might be worthwhile checking out. As for me and my writer pal, JoAnne. I don’t have much to show for our friendship except the feelings I have in my heart. I can picture her thumbnail image in my mind but I know that in time even that will fade and become clouded until such time as her image disappears entirely and she is truly gone. I wish I had known she was sick. I wish I could have acted to save the evidence of our friendship. Most of all, I wish she was still here. But she is not. My friend is gone. Technology is what enabled us to have known each other in the first place so I am grateful that such things as computers and interactive message boards ever existed. Believe it or not, I am thankful that facebook exists because it allowed the two of us to stay connected after our writing community disbanded all those years ago. However, the threads of those connections have proven to be tenuous at best. In times like these, the old adage of holding close to the ones you love applies. But even more to the point, don’t rely on others to protect your relationships and your identity for you. It is up to all of us to do that ourselves. If I had known how JoAnne’s life was going to end, I would have taken steps to have saved our conversations and her comments as they held great value to me. Rest in peace, JoAnne. Thanks for being part of this world and of my life. I am better for you having been there. May Peace Be With You now and forever more.\n\nThe link to the video for the making of the song “Now and Then” by The Beatles can be found here.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.

I appreciate your interest and your support. I also wish to give a shout-out to those of you who have decided to give Mastodon a try and/or have indicated that they intend to do so in the future. I want to make clear that I have no proprietary interest in Mastodon. My intent in promoting it as an alternative information source to Twitter was simply to illustrate that when it comes to having access to the kind of information that is relevant to each of us there are alternatives to the major players out there. We still have choices and options and, as long as we do, let’s explore them to see if there is a fit for us. I firmly believe that social media has long ceased to be mainly a tool for connecting with loved ones. The evolution of social media companies, as well as search engine companies such as Google has taken information and turned it into currency. Controlling, organizing and disseminating information is big financial business with broad economic implications for companies like Meta (Facebook), Twitter and Google, as well as for companies on the other end of things such as television broadcasters, local and national magazine and newspaper chains and the economies of provinces/states and entire nations, too. With big profits tends to come big power and influence. Long after I finish this short series and go back to talking about the stories behind the songs we hear and sing, the legal battle regarding who gets to decide how information is controlled in Canada will be ongoing still. It may sound like an exaggeration but the ability of national governments to function with any authority at all is at stake here. Just think about it if Facebook ends up winning and gets to continue to use locally created content in whatever way it chooses. It could opt to promote government press releases, ignore them or change how this information is received by us, the public, by the way of how that news is presented. Social media company’s ability to create their own version of reality for us to consume is very real. It happened with Donald Trump and the 2016 U.S. election so there is no reason it won’t happen here with Justin Trudeau and Pierre Pollievre. It behooves all of us to remain vigilant when it comes to being able to access information that is factual and as unbiased as possible and then using our own minds to decide on our actions going forward.\n\nAs I type these words, I can no longer use Facebook as a means of finding information about any news-related story that is happening anywhere in the world. I cannot post any news-related story about anything that is happening in the world. If you live in Canada and are using Facebook as your sole source of news and information you may be surprised to learn about the war that has erupted in Gaza and how close we are to having this conflict become a global affair that could launch WWIII. If you use Facebook as your sole source of news and information then you probably had a hard time recently finding relevant health information when forest fires were burning and air quality warnings were being issued. This was especially true when The Weather Network came under cyber attack and went offline for a week. If Facebook is your sole source of information and news are you even aware of the shenanigans that Ontario Provincial Premier Doug Ford has been up to regarding selling off the Greenbelt to his real estate robber baron buddies? One of the most important roles that journalism fulfills for the public good is holding those in positions of power to account. The ability for journalists and for most media organizations to continue to perform this role has become more difficult when their broadcast platform (social media companies like Facebook) close off their access points. It is easy to reply to that statement by saying that newspaper reporters continue to publish articles in their papers and television reporters continue to report the news on TV. But, if most people (80%) are using social media companies such as Facebook as their primary news and information gathering platform then, who is left to actually read newspapers anymore or to watch late night televised newscasts? I am sure that the demographic for those viewers and newspaper readers skews toward seniors. Most people who use social media for their information are younger and fully connected. They are the workers and money spenders. It is tough for newspaper reporters and television reporters to continue to play a prominent role when four out of every five people have already turned their backs and accepted the seductive embrace of social media in all its many forms. So then, what is one to do if you are a Canadian and want to stay up to date with what is going on? Well, let me tell you.\n\nMy wife and I try our best to be proactive in our decision making and to avoid having to be reactive because we have let things go too long. Keri, especially, has always been very good about connecting directly to local businesses and service providers so that she gets her information about what is going on directly from the source. Many of those connections came via “LIKING” the facebook pages that many businesses and organizations set up. But since Facebook has started getting uppity and censoring the content we can access and that they are willing to deliver, we have begun slowly divesting ourselves from the platform. This means skipping the middleman-role that Facebook has carved out and connecting directly to information sources by activating email notifications. This is how we get our local news now. This is how we get Public Health announcements such as the locations of Covid vaccine clinics and flu shot clinics. There really is no need to not be aware of what is happening in your own community, town, province or country. There are still ways to find this information on your own and, by doing so, to take back some of the power we have freely given to a private, for-profit foreign company. What follows is just a brief listing of websites we subscribe to in order to stay on top of current goings-on around us. If you want to pay for the privilege of remaining informed, all national newspapers will hook you up with digital subscriptions that cost less than actual home delivery. The same is true on apps issued by national television networks such as the CBC, CTV and Global-TV. While each of those networks offers some free content via their apps, most require a subscription either directly to them or via a cable tv company for the full package. However, one thing you can watch online for free via these network TV apps is their national newscasts. Each network app also has a 24/7 package of news-related content available online for free as well. In any case, here is a listing of some of where we have gone to ensure our own access to relevant and current news and information.\n\nNews and Information:\n\nLocally (which means my hometown of Cobourg and vicinity):\n\nMyFM 93.3 has really stepped up and is providing excellent local news coverage via their website. We receive an email filled with local news content each morning for free. Sign up via their website.\n\nToday’s Northumberland (Pete Fisher’s news coverage, for my local peeps). The Today’s Northumberland website is updated regularly with Pete’s great local news content. You can sign up for email delivery but we have found that to be inconsistent. Simply bookmarking Today’s Northumberland’s website and checking it daily seems to be the better way to go,\n\nNorthumberland News remains active. We have signed up to receive email reports filled with local news and that seems to work out just fine.\n\nMYFM radio station is also free to stream on the web. If you go to their website you can “Listen Live” to them in real time and get the latest news reports as they are being broadcast. You can also do it the old fashioned way and listen to them directly via your car or home radio. Go figure!\n\nProvincially (which means in Ontario):\n\nCBC.ca/news is the online news portal for CBC. You can use the app to read articles that they post and update during the day. There are also ways to watch live reports and newscasts via links available on the app. So far, this basic content is free.\n\nCTVnews.ca has the same set-up as does CBCnews.\n\nGlobalnews.ca is the same as the other two. All the news of the day is free to access via their app. As well, all three apps have regional-specific content. So if you want Toronto-centric news, you can get it. The same applies for other provinces. I often check in on Halifax and/or Atlantic Canadian news this way.\n\nCity-Tv.ca is an app that focuses on programming from Toronto TV station City-TV. The beauty of this app is that not only do you have access to printed articles that are updated throughout the day but there is a live link to the CityPulse 24 hour news ticker channel that you can watch for free.\n\nMany of the major cities in Ontario have radio stations that have apps or else they stream on the internet which is an additional way you can gather news and information from regional-specific areas of the province.\n\nAs mentioned above, all major newspapers have their own websites where some content is free but much of it is not. Depending on how anxious you are to access news directly, maintaining a digital or home delivery subscription is the best route for those newspapers such as The Globe and Mail, The National Post, The Toronto Star or even The Toronto Sun. Many local newspapers have gone belly-up as a direct result of revenue losses that came as a result of Facebook draining their ad revenue away. If you still have a local newspaper in your area then, I am fairly confident that, like the ones near me, your local newspapers have their own websites and would probably allow you to subscribe to a daily newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nNationally (which means Canada):\n\nThe same apps listed in the provincial section apply here as well. All of the bigger television and newspaper chains seem to have good national and regional content available via their apps and websites.\n\nOther national sources for information include magazines such as MacLeans and The Walrus, just to name two. Their content is generally provided for a fee.\n\nThere are numerous news-related podcasts out there for those who are into podcasts. Keri likes to listen to one from Sault Ste. Marie called Inside the Village which is run by former MacLeans Magazine columnist and author Michael Friscolanti. This podcast, which is available for free, discusses current trends in news and often digs a little deeper into their stories than you might see on a regular news provider such as City-TV, where content is constantly being refreshed. Like many of the items mentioned on all lists, you can subscribe to this podcast and have new episodes appear automatically in your inbox. I am sure there are many other good news-related podcasts out there. If you have your own favourite, feel free to share it in the comment section below.\n\nHealth:\n\nLocally:\n\nThe Haliburton, Kawartha, Pine Ridge District Health Unit often releases news updates and public announcements. We subscribe to this service and have these updates come directly to our inbox.\n\nNorthumberland Hills Hospital also often makes health-related public announcements. Bookmark their website and/or sign up to their email list and you, too, can get all the latest information delivered to you for free.\n\nMany service organizations have a health-related component to the services they provide for our local community. Organizations such as the United Way, The Salvation Army, Five Counties Children’s Centre, Kinark Family Services, The Green Wood Coalition, FareShare Food Bank and many churches all have websites that provide excellent information. Many also allow you to subscribe to their email newsletter services for free.\n\nProvincially/Nationally:\n\nThe Ontario Ministry of Health would be more than happy to send you email updates of their announcements so that you can stay up to date with provincial regulations and mandates.\n\nThe Canadian Red Cross can be subscribed to for national events and information as well as for local events such as blood donor clinics.\n\nWith so many people being affected by stress, anxiety, addictions, etc., access to mental health information and services is critical. The Canadian Mental Health Association is a good place to start in that regard. They have a website you can bookmark and email notifications that you can subscribe to. There are many other valuable resources out there that you can access directly and avoid going through Facebook. Please feel free to list as many websites/organizations that you can think of that you have found useful. I am happy to collate everything in one spot for ease of use going forward.\n\nFood:\n\nLocally:\n\nSubscribe directly to restaurants in your area and/or bookmark their websites for ease of access. It is important to support local businesses and if you can do so and get a tasty treat or meal out of it for yourself and your family at the same time then why would you not do this?!!! I have a menu of apps on my iPad that are all connected to local chain restaurants such as Swiss Chalet, Boston Pizza, etc. We also make extensive use of the websites provided by non-chain local restaurants and happily, regularly order online for takeout or to make a reservation to eat in. The only downside to subscribing to a business of any type is that you may get sick of advertisements filling up your inbox. Fair enough. However, if you want to know who is having a two-for-one supper special then those same advertisements are helpful, too. As always, you can manage your email settings to control how often you receive advertisements in your inbox.\n\nGrocery store flyers used to come in the local newspaper. If your local newspaper no longer exists thanks to Facebook then you can still get hold of flyers for your local grocery stores via the websites of each grocery store. As with most businesses, if you find searching for websites to be cumbersome then those same stores will happily email the flyers to your inbox via a link on their website.\n\nI could go on and on with lists like the ones created above. What is most important is the big idea behind it all. That big idea is that we have allowed ourselves to become dependent upon websites like Facebook to serve up information to us without much effort being required on our parts. Their algorithm-based programming means that you tend to receive targeted advertising and information based upon your clicks and LIKES that helped to create your personal online preference profile. In many ways, this ease of access to things we tend to like has lulled us into a false sense of security and even laziness. While we were allowing Facebook to provide us with our greatest online informational desires, we stopped using our own initiative and energy to do the work ourselves. We stopped watching TV network newscasts. We stopped buying national and local newspapers and magazines. We stopped directly accessing the websites of those companies who benefit from clicks and LIKES on their own websites which, in turn, helps justify what these companies charge advertisers for advertise on TV and in newspapers. For businesses and media companies such as the ones who run your local newspaper, advertising rates are often arrived at because of something called “Reach”. This term is used to describe how much interactivity is provable between a business and its potential customers. Those businesses who have a big reach tend to be bigger brand names such as Walmart and McDonalds. Smaller, local businesses do not automatically have that brand name recognition and, as a result, they rely on being able to advertise locally. If sources of advertising such as local newspapers disappear then, local business owners are forced to pay higher rates to advertise via Canada Post or else, they have to climb into bed with monopolistic entities such as Facebook who can control the success or failure of any advertising campaign because of algorithms.\n\nRegardless of whether you are seeking information or else seeking to provide information, having businesses such as Facebook controlling it all takes away local autonomy. There is no need to be a slave to the terms by which a company like Facebook chooses to operate. Right now, they are deliberately censoring access to news and are restricting our ability to communicate with each other about current events that require access to news and information. But, as you can see from the small lists above, you can take control back into your own hands again by eliminating Facebook’s role as information provider from your life. If you want to continue to use Facebook because you like being connected to your friends and family then, be my guest. But be aware that using Facebook and Twitter and other social media companies has a direct impact on the health of local economies and, taken to extremes, can actually manipulate public opinion because of how they tailor the information you receive. This is dangerous for democracy which kinda seems important to me. Maybe I’m crazy. I dunno. I remember when Facebook first came on the scene. Some people referred to it as “Crackbook”. I always took that to mean that using the programme would become addictive. Well, it appears as though it actually has. Do you have the willpower to take control of your information away from Facebook or are you so completely hooked that you don’t care what Facebook is actually doing anymore? I am curious to see how it all unfolds. All that I do know is that I support the Federal law that was passed recently requiring facebook and Google to Pay for using local content on their sites. I also know that I am willing to take control of how I access information while I still have the ability to do so. If Keri and I can sign up for email subscriptions, you can, too.\n\n***As always, all information contained in this post remains the sole property of the author. No portion of this post shall be reblogged, copied or shared in any manner without the express written consent of the author. ©2023 http://www.tommacinneswriter.com\n\nInformation and Technology: Part #3\n\nIn the first two posts in this series *(which you can read here and here) I talked about some of the ways in which we use computer technology has changed over the years. I have also gave examples of how technology is absolutely wonderful when it is used with the aim of simplifying daily tasks, connecting us to the information we need and to putting us in touch with those people we love. But I have also shown how computer technology can be misused and may actually become a threat to our democracy. Our ability to access the information we desire at any given time and our ability to communicate with others is being curtailed as you read these words. Facebook and Google are already censoring the information we have access to in response to initiatives by the federal government aimed at having these companies direct a portion of their ad revenues back toward Canadian media companies as a fee they should pay for using locally created content on their social media sites. Regardless of whether you support Mark Zuckerberg, owner of Facebook or Prime Minister Trudeau, on behalf of journalists and media outlets across the country, the fact remains that there is a battle being waged over who controls the information that you and I get to see, how we get to see it and how we express our reactions to it with each other.\n\nIn this debate I can only speak for myself. I have been growing increasingly uneasy with how these companies are operating and the seemingly omnipotent nature of their influence on our daily lives that they seem to possess. So, this leaves me with the question of am I just going to complain about this state of affairs or is there something that I can actually do about it? I have wrestled with this problem and have come to the conclusion that I have three major choices to make: 1- I can throw my hands into the air in despair and admit that social media usage and technology in general, are both so fully integrated into my life that there is no way to meaningfully disengage from it. The battle is already really over and I need to reconcile myself with the fact that companies such as Facebook and Google have more real power to affect my life than national governments do. As such, Trudeau is wrong to seek redress from social media companies. The future will unfold as social media companies dictate and we will become increasingly dependent/vulnerable as a result. 2- The second alternative is to pull the social media plug completely and close all social media accounts. In the short term, that would mean that I would revert back to the way things were before social media ever became a thing. If I wanted to contact someone back then I would pay them a call, use the telephone, write a letter or send an email. If I wanted access to news and information, I would start watching the CBC National news again. Perhaps I would buy a newspaper subscription, as well as some magazine subscriptions, too. I may not get as many birthday greetings as I do now and I may miss seeing everyone’s Halloween costume ideas but I would be able to connect with the world on my own terms, albeit in a greatly reduced manner. 3- I could seek alternative platforms that would allow me to remain connected via social media without having my content censored and/or manipulated by a single company or person like Zuckerberg or Elon Musk. But are there social media alternatives that function any differently than the mainstream sites? That is what this post will truly be about.\n\nAs I pondered what to do about the sense of unease that was consuming me these past few years regarding social media and its role in my life, I came to the conclusion that maintaining the status quo on my end was simply not feasible over the long haul. Something had to change. That something turned out to be Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter. His deal to buy Twitter was what gave me the impetus to pull myself away and, as always, it all had to do with information and who controls it.\n\nAs I have stated before, I loved Twitter. It was my favourite social media site bar none. At the time I joined in 2007 or 2008, Twitter billed itself as a virtual town square. As you may know from history, town squares were the original meeting places in many towns and cities. It was where speakers stood atop soapboxes and stated their views for all to hear. You could choose to listen to these speakers or you could go on about your day. If you stayed, you could mount the soapbox when the speaker was finished and rebut their claims or agree with them and, by doing so, amplify and reinforce the points being made. It was where the news of the day was shared. It was where people came together in times of crisis and in times of joy and celebration. You don’t have to go back very far into world history to see examples where town squares (or other similar meeting spaces) played significant roles in shaping world events. When I think of such places I immediately remember the Solidarity Movement at the Gdansk Shipyards in Poland. I remember Hong Kong citizens gathering in their downtown core by the thousands to sing songs of revolution from Les Miserables while defying Chinese authorities. I remember environmental activist Greta Thunberg and tens of thousands of those she inspired, all marching together to try to stop climate change from ending life as we know it on our planet. Is there a more well known town square than Times Square in New York City which sees thousands of revelers gather to ring in the new year? Finally, if you have access to news coverage today, what you are witnessing are the mass protests against Israel’s invasion of Gaza and the loss of so many innocent lives. Being able to gather together to share and debate ideas is one of the most fundamentally established of our social behaviours. It is true of cultures all over the world and for a while, it was true on the social media site known as Twitter.\n\nFor most of the years between 2007 and 2022, Twitter was my go-to source for news. I can’t tell you the last time I actually read a national newspaper that I was holding in my own hands or when I last watched the CBC or CTV National news before bedtime. This is not to say that I cut myself off from those news sources. On the contrary, organizations such as the CBC had a strong presence on Twitter. So very early on in my time on Twitter, it became increasingly clear that shows such as the CBC National News at 10:00 at night were becoming redundant to me and many others as well. By the time the evening news came on television, most of the content it was broadcasting had already been experienced in real-time throughout the day by Twitter users. This meant that network news shows ended up taking on the role of recapping the news of the day rather than delivering breaking news. This caused these news shows to alter their delivery model in such a way that they spent more time talking about the news than reporting it. The last decade or two has seen the rise of the news commentator as an important participant in the dissemination of information. In many cases, news commentators appear on panels so as to give opposing sides the opportunity to air their views. This has led to a climate of both-sides-ism in which every fact is seemingly up for debate and a consensus on what is real has become increasingly unobtainable. If the basis of good journalism has been a clear and unbiased reporting of the facts of a story then modern television news has done journalism a disservice by creating an atmosphere when facts are allowed to be declared as mere opinions which, when done, allows these “opinions” to be dismissed as fake or biased.\n\nBecause television news shows seem to have lost the plot when it comes to their mandate, Twitter became a more relevant and informative route for me to take. It was the absolute best place to be when news events were actually breaking. It was thrilling to find myself involved, so to speak, when events such as the Boston Marathon bombing was happening, for one example. In real time Twitter users came together to connect victims with first responders, they began piecing together (through video clips) what had actually happened and, in doing so, who the bomb suspects were, thus, enabled the tracking of their whereabouts to take place in real time. That is just one news-related example. There were many others along the way. I also enjoyed Twitter during events such as the Academy Awards when so many truly funny and insightful people would be live tweeting the ceremony. I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed my time there. I still consider my time on Twitter to have been well spent. Even though I no longer have an active account, I still miss the experience of being on Twitter. But, having said that, because of the way social media has been weaponized by those seeking to undermine democracy, it was impossible to stay. This leads us to the crucial question: did I simply turn my back and walk away or was there an alternative soft place to land? As it turns out, there was.\n\nI began questioning how Twitter functioned around the time that Donald Trump was campaigning to be U.S. President. Prior to this, there were always loud, passionate voices on Twitter. But I never really minded that because it seemed to reflect the reality of the world I am familiar with. There are leaders and followers everywhere. There are those who enjoy the sound of their own voices, too. That, in and of itself, does not disqualify a website or a society from being important and useful. But as the Trump campaign heated up in 2015 or so, the nature of how those loud voices were being used seemed to change. Debate on Twitter became less about forcefully changing opinion or passionately debating a point of view. Soon it became a means of intimidation. Twitter started becoming a social media site where certain speakers would be targeted in a political sense and ganged up on online. A perfect example of this is former Canadian Energy Minister Catherine McKenna. This is unfortunately far from a unique experience. Many people, especially women and minority group members have gone through the same thing. In the case of McKenna, she came to national prominence in 2015 when the Justin Trudeau government came to power. Initially, the sense was that this government was going to be very progressive in many ways. One of those ways was the appointment of many women into cabinet positions. While this was not the first time a woman has held a position of power in the Canadian government, it did send a message to the rest of Canada that a new regime was in charge and that change was afoot. As we all know, there are some people who adapt to change more easily than others. Many of the very best people I know in this world are women. I think that we might actually stand a better chance at saving the planet if women were in charge of it all but that may just be me. Many others were not like me. Modern politics being what it is, working together across party lines is almost completely unheard of these days. It seems as though an opposition party’s main modus operandi these days is to destroy their rivals whatever the cost. In the case of Catherine McKenna, she was not only a strong woman in a traditionally male-dominated role, her portfolio was one that was charged with helping Canada to transition from a fossil fuel-based resource economy to one based upon green initiatives and renewable energy. Her gender and her policies were seen as threats to the oil industry and, specifically, to the province of Alberta. Therefore, those who sought to oppose her did so in the guise of defending the traditional Albertan way of life. The method they chose to use to attack her was social media. Primarily, it was through Twitter. McKenna maintained an official Government of Canada, Ministry of the Environment Twitter account through which she would publish news releases, photo ops, etc. These tweets became battlegrounds. It didn’t matter if she would tweet about some city getting a new fleet of battery-powered electric buses or that an elementary school somewhere was growing their own food in a garden for school lunches…it didn’t matter at all what the content of her tweets was about or how innocuous they were, each tweet would be met by a barrage of negative comments. Most of the comments were from men or else they were from accounts known as trolls or bots. Trolls could be real people or they could be computer-generated responses. The idea behind the negative accounts was never to convince others of a differing point of view. The sole purpose of the negative response was to silence her voice. Whether the comments were rising from a wellspring of misogyny or were economically based is irrelevant. The point was that they were organized and targeted responses aimed at intimidating McKenna from leading the way forward in a portfolio that was as important to the world as any in the Trudeau government. It was disappointing but not surprising that Catherine McKenna did not run again for re-election in the last federal election. Her voice was effectively silenced. As a country, we are the poorer for it. And like I said, her experience was definitely not unique. Twitter was becoming a very difficult palace for many people to be.\n\nLife on Twitter was becoming problematic for many but it got worse when Elon Musk took over. One of the first things he announced upon taking ownership was that he was going to cut Twitter staff back to bare bone numbers, he was going to reinstate the accounts of many who had been banned for inappropriate behaviour (such as Donald Trump) but, most of all, he was going to demand that users offer up lots of personal identification in order to be recognized as a verified user (as opposed to a troll or a bot account). In reality, he was stripping away many of the security features that had previously existed and yet, was demanding access to the most personal of our information in reply. He asked for our trust that it would be a better Twitter experience for all. I didn’t trust that this would be the case so I closed my account. It was getting harder and harder to stay on a website that was openly making life difficult for so many users. The question wasn’t if I would leave, it was whether or not there was somewhere else to go. Fortunately for me, around the time that Musk was taking over Twitter, users began talking about leaving for a social media site called Mastodon. They said it was a much more civilized version of Twitter and that it was run more as a co-operative rather than being owned by a single owner. Having nowhere else to go, I decided to check it out. This is what I have found out about Mastodon.\n\nThis explanation will be helped a lot if you have even a passing familiarity with the TV show Star Trek. If you don’t then that is ok. I will do my best to make it all make sense. But, if you are familiar with Star Trek then you will remember that Captain Kirk or Captain Picard (or whoever was the captain in the version you may have watched) did not navigate their way through outer space on behalf of the United States of America. They did so on behalf of an organization called The United Federation of Planets. The United Federation of Planets was an alliance of a wide variety of planetary inhabitants who all worked together for their mutual benefit. Each planet remained autonomous. Each planet had their own culture, languages and history. All were allowed to exist as they saw fit. One of the overriding “laws” in the United Federation of Planets was that none of the Starfleet spaceships could interfere with events on an allied planet without first being invited to do so. In other words, it was a universe in which the inhabitants of the various planets all acted as one would in our own local neighbourhoods. In those neighbourhoods, we each have our own house. We each basically do as we please within the confines of our homes. We respect our neighbours’ right to live as they see fit in their own homes. We look out for each other, too. This sort of setup is how Mastodon is structured.\n\nUnlike Facebook or Twitter, there is no one person who owns and operates Mastodon. Instead, Mastodon is made up of several hundred individual computer servers called Instances. (I don’t know why they are called that but they are). Each of these servers is dedicated to serving the interests of a particular group. Those interests can be by nationality or by hobby or any number of other things. My home base in Mastodon is on a server called Mstdn.ca, which stands for Mastodon Canada. Most but not all, of the people who have accounts on Mstdn.ca do so because we are Canadian and/or because we have interest in Canadian affairs. However, I am not limited simply to my little part of the Mastodon world. My server is connected to every other server in the same way that the Star Trek planets were all under the umbrella protection of The United Federation of Planets. In this way, I have a news timeline feed (that looks and functions a lot like Facebook and Twitter) for just those accounts I follow, as well as a feed that is made up of posts by all members of Mstdn.ca whether I follow them or not and then, a third and final feed that consists of every account from every server on Mastodon. I watch one feed at a time and can switch between news feeds whenever I desire.\n\nThe big difference between how Mastodon is run and how Facebook and Twitter work is that there are no algorithms at play because there is no overload there. My local feed of people that I follow is only ever as busy as it gets because of their activity. For the first few months on Mastodon, it felt as though I had left the hustle and bustle of the virtual town square and had landed in the middle of a public library. It was very calm and quiet and peaceful. My content was filled with people primarily sharing their art and music and poetry and scientific projects than anything else. As time has gone on, I have found more accounts to follow in terms of breaking news and current events. Because of that, there are more people who follow me now, too. I use Mastodon as a pipeline to get my blog posts to the world and am slowly accruing followers there because of a shared love of music and/or storytelling. Mastodon has still not fully become what Twitter used to be for me but it is ok and getting better. It is certainly a much more civilized experience and because of that, it is a very welcoming place to land should Twitter prove to be too much for you.\n\nWay back in the beginning of this post, I stated that there were three ways to respond to how manipulative social media sites seem to be these days: you could stay and suck it up, you could cut the strings from your mittens and simply leave or else you could search for alternative sites that might do the same sort of thing. With regard to Twitter, I have opted to leave that site and try out Mastodon. So far so good. I am hopeful that my Mastodon experience will continue to grow and become richer and more interactive but, for now, I am content to be there and am happy to be as far away as possible from Elon Musk. In tomorrow’s post, I will shine the spotlight back on Facebook and tell you about some of the things that my wife and I have done to combat their ban on news coverage so that we can remain as informed as possible about what is going on in our world. Until then, take care. Bye for now.\n\nThe link to the official website for Mastodon can be found here. ***Having said that, if anyone is truly interested in Mastodon and would rather sit down and have me walk you through it all, I would be happy to do so. For now, feel free to try it on for size yourself or have me help, whatever works best for you.\n\n***As always, all original content contained in this post remains the sole property of the author.

This has provided me with the opportunity to take a break from the regular music-related posts that I serve up each day in order to talk about some other things that have been kicking around the confines of my mind. I will call these ramblings “News and Notes” to see if Facebook will allow me to post it. Let’s see how it goes. I apologize in advance for typos and mistakes with grammar and punctuation. I actually proofread my work but what my eyes see and what my mind believes is there are often two different things. Be gentle. On this day I am working without a net. 🙂\n\nAs many of you who follow me and the other members of my family on social media may know, one of the biggest bits of news that has happened to us lately was my eldest daughter Leah gaining acceptance in university for the fall of 2024. The process of gaining acceptance into the university of her choice and in the academic programme of her choice did not begin with the university application letter. It began a couple of years ago when Leah started narrowing down her what-I-want-to-do-when-I-grow-up list of careers to a select few. Then she began conducting research to see which university programmes matched her career-related desires. She initially whittled the potential choices down to a list of ten. At this time, she began creating a “pro” and “con” list for each university. In some cases we were able to travel to these universities and arrange for a guided tour. We did that for Brock U., Trent U., Carleton U. and the University of Ottawa in Ontario. Because my mother and sister still live in Nova Scotia, we were able to combine a trip home with tours of Acadia U. and St. Francis Xavier University, too. For those universities, as well as the other schools on Leah’s list that we weren’t able to see in person, the school websites almost all provided her with the opportunity to see the school virtually. That included being able to see classrooms, dorm rooms, stroll the grounds and so on. Each website had virtual assistants who were available to answer any questions Leah may have had along the way. All universities seemed happy to help. When it came time to actually apply to the universities that made the final cut, Leah’s school marks were uploaded to an Ontario-wide university database. Then she simply filled out the online unive"
