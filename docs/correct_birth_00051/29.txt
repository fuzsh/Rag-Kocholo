MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - The birthplace of the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, was sold on the Shelby County Courthouse steps Friday at noon.

The house at 406 Lucy near McLemore and South Third Street in South Memphis had been in foreclosure and Environmental Court.

Franklin was born at the home on March 25, 1942, to parents Barbara and Rev. C.L. Franklin.

The woman who oversees Historic Clayborn Temple, Anasa Troutman, personally bought the Franklin house.

She says she wants to preserve the house and keep it right where it is as a catalyst to help improve the highly challenged and impoverished neighborhood.
