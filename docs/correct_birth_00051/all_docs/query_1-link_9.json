        "text": "Aretha Franklin may have left her humble Memphis, Tennessee roots when she was barely two years old, but the city is nevertheless desperate to save its small connection to the “Queen of Soul.\". In 1942, Franklin was born in this tiny wooden home, but her family left Memphis about two years later. Now, the Memphis mayor's office is trying to save the dilapidated structure, left vacant for years, to preserve it as a landmark. A group from the mayor's office is seeking funding sources to assist in the preservation and future use of the historic home.\n\n[#instagram: A post shared by Kon (@konradstagram) on May 28, 2017 at 8:20am PDT]\n\nFranklin isn't the only star whose childhood home has been deemed unworthy of being landmarks. Plenty of stars homes, living and deceased, have not received official landmark status. Below, we visit the places where some of the most famous faces in Hollywood grew up—and the hometowns that should consider following in Memphis's footsteps.\n\n[#instagram: A post shared by Madonna (@madonna) on May 3, 2017 at 4:58pm PDT]\n\nMADONNA\n\nThese days, Madonna's permanent residences are in London and New York—but the pop star grew up in flyover country. Madonna Louise Ciccone lived in a two-storey brick Colonial in Rochester Hills, Michigan (about 30 minutes outside Detroit) with her parents and seven siblings until she was 18. Her father and stepmother moved out in July 2001, selling the home for $270,000, but in 2008 the home burned down, reportedly due to arson. It later sold partial state for $91,700 in 2012. The property still attracts hordes of tourists to this day, despite the home not being in its original condition.\n\n[#instagram: A post shared by Farrah Fawcett Foundation (@farrahfawcettfn) on May 4, 2017 at 11:18am PDT]\n\nFARRAH FAWCETT\n\nFamous for her feathered blond hair and a starring role on “Charlie's Angels,” Farrah Fawcett got her start in Texas. Before heading to Hollywood, Fawcett lived with her parents (her father was an oil man) in this 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom house in Corpus Christi, Texas. After her 2009 death, the actress's childhood home was remodeled with new paint, tile, carpeting, lighting, and bathroom fixtures before being listed for $215,000.\n\nMARLON BRANDO\n\nThis five-bedroom, four-bathroom frame house in Omaha, Nebraska is where legendary actor Marlon Brando grew up with his father (a pesticide and chemical feed manufacturer) mother, and two older sisters. (Fun fact: After winning an Oscar in 1973, Brando returned to the house and shocked the new owners by asking for a tour.) Public records show the 4,119-square-foot home was built in 1900 and while it has been updated, and though it now includes a pool, it's yet to be landmarked.\n\nMICHAEL JACKSON\n\nThe Jackson family's Gary, Indiana residence was The King of Pop's first home. And while the house has long been part of the history of Michael and the Jackson Five's rise from poverty to international fame, the tiny 672-square-foot, 2-bedroom, 1-bath house (which housed 11 people) has never been made a historic landmark. The property is reportedly still owned by the family.\n\n[#instagram: A post shared by Janis Joplin (@janisjoplin) on May 10, 2017 at 5:49pm PDT]\n\nJANIS JOPLIN\n\nOh lord won't you buy me … a music legend's childhood home? In the 1940s and 1950s, Janis Joplin grew up in this Port Arthur, Texas, house. She even carved her first name into the floor of the garage in the 1,450-square-foot, 5-bedroom residence. Though the homeowners did contact the Museum of the Gulf Coast about acquiring the house, the museum declined. It went on the market last year for $500,000.\n\nKURT COBAIN\n\nIn one of the rare cases of preserved childhood homes, Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain's Aberdeen, Washington home is pretty much in the same condition as when he lived there. From the flowered wallpaper and shag carpeting to the linoleum floors and yellow Formica kitchen counters, the grunge icon's mother Wendy O'Connor didn't remodel after the musician died in 1994. Many hope the home does eventually become a tribute museum as thousands visit the nearby Kurt Cobain Memorial Park annually.\n\n[#instagram: A post shared by Barack Obama (@barackobama) on Oct 7, 2016 at 1:09pm PDT]\n\nBARACK OBAMA\n\nOther than the four years he spent living in Indonesia between 1967 and 1971, President Barack Obama was raised primarily in Honolulu, Hawaii. Though he and his family lived in multiple houses there, Obama's first boyhood home was a pale yellow bungalow on Kalaniana'ole Highway in Makiki. The current owners bought the house without ever knowing the 44th president of the United States lived there, and, though it's not a historical site, they say many people come by to photograph the residence.\n\n[#instagram: A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Oct 30, 2016 at 12:33am PDT]\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ\n\nShe started out as \"Jenny From the Block\", but musician and actress Jennifer Lopez went on to be one of the most famous names in Hollywood. The block where she started out was Blackrock Avenue in the Bronx, New York in a 5-bedroom, 3-bathroom townhouse in the Castlerock neighbourhood. Her family sold the house in 1999—the year “If You Had My Love” was released and hit the Billboard Hot 100. Though fireworks set the home ablaze in 2003, it was eventually fixed and resold.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Architectural Digest."
