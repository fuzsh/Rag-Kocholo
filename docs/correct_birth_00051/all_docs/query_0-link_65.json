        "text": "At the age of 18, Franklin switched from religious music to secular (nonreligious) music. She moved to New York, New York, where she signed with Columbia Records. She released a number of recordings, singing everything from Broadway ballads to rhythm and blues. However, Franklin did not achieve great success until after she signed with Atlantic Records and famed producer Jerry Wexler in 1966.\n\nAt Atlantic, Franklin returned to her gospel-blues roots. She refined a style associated with Ray Charles—a mixture of gospel and rhythm and blues—and raised it to new heights. Her first song to sell a million copies was “I Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You)” (1967). The same year she released “Respect”, which became an anthem on personal and racial levels. Franklin continued to release hit songs over the next five years.\n\nIn the early 1970s Franklin triumphed on tours of Europe and Latin America. She released Amazing Grace (1972), a live recording of her performance with a choir at a Baptist church in Los Angeles, California. Amazing Grace is considered one of the greatest gospel albums of any era and remains the best-selling live gospel recording. Her popularity dipped in the late 1970s, but she scored hits with “Jump to It” (1982) and “Freeway of Love” (1985). Her later albums included A Rose Is Still a Rose (1998) and A Woman Falling Out of Love (2011).\n\nIn 1987 Franklin was the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Over the course of her career she won 18 Grammy Awards, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. She also received a Kennedy Center Honor in 1994, a National Medal of Arts in 1999, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. At Barack Obama’s 2009 presidential inauguration Franklin sang “My Country ’Tis of Thee” for a crowd of more than 1 million. Franklin died in Detroit on August 16, 2018. Later that year the documentary Amazing Grace, which chronicles the recording of the 1972 album, premiered."
