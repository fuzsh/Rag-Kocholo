        "text": "Aretha Franklin\n\nThe queen of soul, Aretha Franklin was one of the giants of soul music, and indeed of American pop as a whole. More than any other performer, she epitomized soul at its most gospel-charged. Although renowned for her soul recordings, Franklin is also adept at jazz, blues, R&B and gospel music. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Franklin No. 1 on its list of The Greatest Singers of All Time.\n\nAretha Franklin was one of the most honored artists by the Grammy Awards, with 18 competitive Grammys to date, and two honorary Grammys. She has scored a total of 20 No. 1 singles on the Billboard R&B Singles Chart, one of which also became her first No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100: \"Respect\" (1967).Â She also has the most million-selling singles of any female artist with 14. Between 1967 and 1982 Aretha had 10 #1 R&B albums - more than any other female artist.\n\nAretha Louise Franklin was born at a two-room house in Memphis Tennessee. She was the second of four children born to BarbaraÂ and C.L. Franklin. Franklin's family moved to Buffalo, when Franklin was two, and then by six, had settled in Detroit. Following the move to Detroit, Franklin's parents, who had a troubled marriage, split. Due to her father's work as a Baptist minister, Franklin was primarily raised by her grandmother, Rachel. Aretha Franklin suffered a tragedy when her mother died in Buffalo when Aretha was ten. Franklin sang in church at an early age and learned how to play piano by ear. By her late preteens, Franklin was regularly singing solo numbers in her father's New Bethel Baptist Church. Franklin's father, C.L., was a respected and popular preacher. Franklin grew up with local and national celebrities hanging out at her father's home including gospel greats Albertina Walker and her group The Caravans, Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward, three women who played a pivotal role in her vocal development as a child.\n\nAfter Franklin's father gained fame for his recorded sermons for Checker Records and for gaining even more popularity for his work as a civil rights activist, he helped his daughter sign a contract with Checker's JVB gospel record division. In 1956, when Aretha was only fourteen she released her first album, Songs of Faith. Aretha Franklin began touring the gospel circuit and worked under the direction of James Cleveland. When it seemed that the child prodigy was unstoppable her career hit a road block.\n\nBy the time she was fifteen years old, Aretha Franklin was pregnant and at the age of seventeen she was the mother of two children. Aretha overcame these hitches in style. John Hammond was Columbia Record’s official talent scout; he offered Aretha a contract with the famous company."
