        "text": "Why American Idol Champ Never Quit: I Couldn't Stay Away\n\nThird time's the charm for American Idol's Season 12 champ. Candice Glover's victory on the reality singing competition show Thursday night comes after two major setbacks. She had previously auditioned in Season 9 and 11 and even made it to the Hollywood rounds, where she was then eliminated. She came back again in Season 12 and this time, made it to the very end. Check out all the new fall shows! \"I always knew for some reason that it would happen if I kept going,\" she told reporters backstage after the finale. \"At some point I said, 'American Idol obviously doesn't want me, so why would I go back?' But I found myself on the website, looking at auditions again and being determined. I just couldn't stay away.\" Check out Candice's other thoughts on: Her winning moment \"I'm still trying to process the whole thing."
