        "text": "The \"Queen of Soul\" was a true trailblazer\n\nAretha Franklin - \"The Queen of Soul\" - was a trailblazer. Aretha is one of the most decorated artists in Grammy history, the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1981 and was rated by Rolling Stone as the top spot in their 2010 list of \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\".\n\nSo, it's hard to understate the impact of the American singer, musician and civil rights activist.\n\nWhere was Aretha Franklin from?\n\nBorn in Memphis, Tennessee, to the famous Baptist preacher C. L. Franklin and Barbara Sigger Franklin in 1942, Aretha began her career as a gospel singer in Detroit in her father's church, where she was also friends and neighbours with Berry Gordy Jr and Smokey Robinson.\n\nFranklin was considered a child prodigy from an early age, leading to a series of gospel recordings before she landed her first recording contract with Columbia, with whom she released her 1961 debut Aretha: With The Ray Bryant Combo at the age of 19.\n\nHow did Aretha Franklin become famous?\n\nHowever, it wasn't until Aretha joined Jerry Wexler at Atlantic Records, that Aretha fully unlocked her full, soul-filled musical potential from 1967 to 1979, releasing hits such as 'I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)' (1967), 'Respect' (1967), 'Think' (1968) and 'I Say a Little Prayer' (1968).\n\nHer chart dominance during this time soon earned her the title \"Queen of Soul\" whilst simultaneously becoming a leading symbol in the civil rights movement, even singing at Martin Luther King Jr's funeral.\n\nIn the 1970s, the singer began working with producers such as Quincy Jones and Curtis Mayfield, before her career started to fade with the rise of disco.\n\nBy the early 1980s, and after a cameo in The Blues Brothers (1980), Aretha had signed to Arista with whom she stayed with for 23 years and saw a resurgence of more pop-orientated hits, including collaborations with The Eurythmics and George Michael.\n\nWas Aretha Franklin married?\n\nAretha was married twice - first to her manager Ted White in 1961 at the age of 18. They divorced in 1969, and she married actor Glynn Turman in 1978 and they divorced in 1984.\n\nShe also had four sons. Her first child was born in 1955 and named Clarence after her father, and his paternity was only discovered in 2019 to be Edward John, who was also the father of her second son, Edward Derone Franklin, born in 1957. She shared her third son, Ted White Jr., with her first husband, born in 1964 and is now known as Teddy Richards, and her fourth son is Kecalf Cunningham who was born in 1970 to Aretha and her road manager Ken Cunningham.\n\nWhen did Aretha Franklin pass away?\n\nThe singer remained musically active until 2017, but her career was ultimately curbed because of her declining health, where she succumbed to pancreatic cancer on 16th August 2018.\n\nWhether it was performing soul, R & B, gospel or pop, Aretha Franklin had a monumental impact within the 20th century, and many of her songs are still revered today.\n\nWhich are Aretha Franklin's best-known songs?\n\nAretha Franklin: 'Respect'\n\nOf course, 'Respect' is one of Aretha Franklin's most iconic songs. The song is actually a cover of Otis Redding's song from 1965. Aretha's version was released in 1967, and the song was very successful, reaching Number 10 in the UK, and Number 1 in the USA.\n\nAretha Franklin: 'I Say a Little Prayer'\n\nWritten by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, and originally released by Dionne Warwick in 1967, Aretha covered it with huge success just a year later.\n\nAlthough it was a B-side and a cover, 'I Say a Little Prayer' was a hugely popular song for Aretha here in the UK, reaching Number 4 in 1968. It became so popular that despite being a B-side it received a lot of airplay on the radio and continues to be well-known Aretha song to this day.\n\nAretha Franklin: 'Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves'\n\nReleased in 1985 'Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves' with the Eurythmics was another Top 10 song for Aretha Franklin. The female anthem was written by the Eurythmics and featured on their 'Be Yourself Tonight' album along with Aretha's 'Who's Zoomin' Who?'.\n\nSince its original release, the song has been covered a number of times, including by the Spice Girls and Hazell Dean in 1998, and The Pointer Sisters in 2005.\n\nAretha Franklin: 'I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)' with George Michael\n\nOne of Aretha Franklin's most popular songs was 'I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)' with George Michael. The song reached Number 1 around the world, including the UK.\n\nAretha Franklin: '(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman'\n\nOne of Aretha's most iconic love songs, '(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman' was released in 1967, having been written specifically for Aretha by Carole King and Gerry Goffin. Many other artists have covered the track since its original release including songwriter Carole, Peggy Lipton, George Benson, Celine Dion, Rod Stewart and Mary J. Blige among many others.\n\nAretha Franklin: 'Chain of Fools'\n\nAretha first recorded 'Chain of Fools' in 1967. The track was originally written by singer-songwriter Don Covay for Otis Redding, but Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler gave it to Aretha instead. She won the Grammy Award for Best Female R & B Vocal Performance for the song.\n\nRead up on our favourite artists beginning with A:\n\nRead more:\n\nWATCH: Aretha Franklin RESPECT trailer\n\nAretha Franklin wins posthumous Pulitzer Prize\n\nHow to listen to Jazz FM:\n\nListen to Jazz FM across the UK on your digital radio, the free Rayo app, via the play button below and by asking your smart speaker to \"play Jazz FM\"."
