She said through a spokeswoman Monday that her and her family's interests will not be overlooked as plans for making the house a shrine to Franklin's legacy move forward.\n\nRogers and members of House's family are expected to attend an Environmental Court hearing set for 10:30 a.m. Tuesday. The hearing was already scheduled prior to Franklin's Aug. 16 death in Detroit.\n\nEnvironmental Court has been overseeing efforts to preserve the South Memphis property at 406 Lucy Ave. since 2012, when it was declared a public nuisance because of rotting floors and a collapsing roof. Retired Judge Larry Potter saved it from the wrecking ball amid competing plans for how to honor Franklin.\n\nFranklin's connection to the house was slim — she was born there on March 25, 1942, but her family moved to Detroit when she was 2 years old. Franklin did in later years, however, become involved in efforts to preserve the home.\n\nRogers said House — who at one point submitted a plan to make the home the headquarters of WLRM-AM 1380, a small blues and soul radio station — wants the home to remain in its current location regardless of how it is used. House also would like to see Lucy Avenue renamed Aretha Franklin Avenue.\n\nOther proposals have floated the idea of moving the home, perhaps closer to the Stax Museum in Soulsville, and making it a tourist attraction there.\n\nJudge Potter put the property into receivership and named Jeffrey Higgs of South Memphis Renewal Community Corp. the receiver.\n\nHiggs could not immediately be reached Monday about Rogers' comment, but he said following Franklin's death that those seeking to restore the home are \"in a pretty good position to move forward.\"\n\nHe said untangling ownership issues was among the problems that have slowed plans for the home's future, but that grant money has been secured and a plan is in place that he cannot yet discuss.\n\nThe only visible signs of progress at the house so far are a fence that was erected to secure the property and a historical marker noting the home's significance.\n\nOne issue House, who now lives the next street over from Lucy on Simpson Avenue, faces in preserving her interest in the property is paying property taxes. Rogers said just under $1,200 is owed, and a fundraising effort is afoot to raise the money. Rogers said she will bring some of the money to court Tuesday and ask for time to raise the remainder.\n\nMildred House, one of 12 children Vera House raised at the Lucy Avenue home, said her family is eager to see Franklin's Memphis heritage preserved as long as her family's voice is part of the process.\n\n\"We think it'll be good for Memphis, Tennessee,\" House said. \"But it's also ours. We think this can be part of something great.\"\n\nAdded Rogers, \"Everybody has their own agenda. This is going to be a long process, but we just want to make sure these folks (the House family) are respected.\"\" (visit link)\n\nType of publication: Internet OnlyWhen was the article reported?: 08/27/2018Publication: Memphis Commercial AppealArticle Url: [Web Link]Is Registration Required?: noHow widespread was the article reported?: regionalNews Category: Society/People\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nGive the date of your visit at the news location along with a description of what you learned or experienced.\n\nSearch for...\n\nGeocaching.com Google Map\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nMapQuest\n\nBing Maps\n\nNearest Waymarks\n\nNearest News Article Locations\n\nNearest Geocaches\n\nCreate a scavenger hunt using this waymark as the center point\n\nRecent Visits/Logs:\n\nThere are no logs for this waymark yet."
