        "text": "She was born in Memphis, and during her earliest visits to Nashville, Aretha Franklin would light up the famed R&B clubs of Jefferson Street.\n\nHalf a century later, the \"Queen of Soul\" would play her final Nashville shows at the city's most prestigious venues and events: the Swan Ball and the Schermerhorn Symphony Center.\n\nThe epic musical journey of Franklin — who died Thursday at age 76 — included many intersections with Music City over the years. In addition to concerts and award ceremonies, she recorded a handful of country songs and would prove to be an immeasurable influence on some of the genre's most celebrated vocalists.\n\nRaised on an eclectic musical diet of gospel, R&B, classical and jazz, she blossomed out of her father's Detroit church to become the most distinguished black female artist of all time, breaking boundaries while placing nearly 100 hits on Billboard’s R&B chart — 20 of them reaching No. 1.\n\nThe Queen of Soul, as she was crownd in the 1960s, leaves a sprawling legacy of classic songs that includes \"Respect,\" \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\" \"Think\" and \"Freeway of Love,\" along with a best-selling gospel catalog.\n\nHer death follows several years of painstakingly concealed medical issues, which led to regular show cancellations and extended absences from the public eye.\n\nA family statement released by her publicist Gwendolyn Quinn said \"Franklin's official cause of death was due to advance pancreatic cancer of the neuroendocrine type, which was confirmed by Franklin's oncologist, Dr. Philip Phillips of Karmanos Cancer Institute\" in Detroit.\n\nMemphis roots\n\nAretha Louise Franklin was born March 25, 1942, in Memphis. Two years later, her family would move to Detroit, where she began singing at her father's New Bethel Baptist Church. Her childhood home and birthplace in Memphis — a 1920s \"clapboard cottage\" — is still standing at 406 Lucy in South Memphis.\n\nIn the hours after Franklin's death, visitors came to the house to write tributes on the boards that covered up its windows.\n\n\"It's like a part of Memphis is dying,\" local resident Erica Qualy told The Commercial Appeal, leaving a purple bouquet at the door.\n\nJefferson Street\n\nIn 1960, Franklin made the jump from gospel to secular music, and her earliest years as an R&B singer included visits to Nashville's Jefferson Street. There was even a four-night run at The New Era Club, which she recalled during a late-night interview with The Tennessean in 1971.\n\nReporter Jack Hurst caught up with Franklin at the King of the Road Motel, \"just before she punched the button for the elevator,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I like Nashville,\" she said. \"It's a beautiful town. Nice climate.\"\n\nFranklin was in town that year to headline a benefit concert for Fisk University, which she deemed a \"terribly worthy cause.\"\n\nThe Nashville Grammys\n\nTwo years later in 1973, when the Grammy Awards were held in Nashville for the first and only time, Franklin was among the stars in attendance.\n\nShe presented an award at the Tennessee Theatre during the CBS telecast, and picked up two awards the next morning at a \"champagne breakfast\" at Municipal Auditorium. Those wins — for best female R&B vocal performance and best soul gospel performance — are a small portion of her 18 career Grammys.\n\nCountry connections\n\nIn the 1960s, Franklin put a one-of-a-kind spin on several country songs. Among them was Willie Nelson's \"Night Life,\" John Hartford's \"Gentle On My Mind\" and \"I May Never Get to Heaven,\" penned by Bill Anderson and Buddy Killen.\n\nOn social media, Nelson called Franklin \"the greatest gift and the voice of a generation. She could turn any song into a hymn.\"\n\nA few decades later, country artists were the ones covering Franklin and claiming her as an influence. Reba McEntire rocked the boat at the 1988 CMA Awards by belting out \"Respect.\"\n\nFaith Hill and Franklin recorded a duet for the latter's 2011 album, \"A Woman Falling Out of Love,\" but the track was ultimately shelved. Last year, Hill and Tim McGraw opened their \"Soul2Soul\" tour concerts with \"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me).\"\n\n\"The choir of angels now have the greatest voice of all time to lead, praise and join in to sing before Jesus,\" Hill wrote on social media Thursday.\n\nGospel glory\n\nIn 2012, the Nashville-based Gospel Music Association inducted Franklin into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\"Aretha most certainly brought her gospel roots into secular R&B,\" the hall wrote on its website, calling her \"one of the finest songwriters of all time as well as one of (the) finest pianists in gospel today.\"\n\nA newer Nashville institution — the National Museum of African American Music — shared its own tribute Thursday morning.\n\n\"Aretha Franklin was a true genius of American music,\" museum President Henry Beecher Hicks III wrote Thursday. \"We hope that her journey is a peaceful one. While we look forward to celebrating her at the (museum), she will be sorely missed.\"\n\nHer final Nashville performances\n\nIn 2012, Franklin performed at Nashville's Swan Ball, an annual white-tie gala known as one of the South's premier social events.\n\nThat came after two stops at the historic Ryman Auditorium in 2010 and 2011, where fans waited in the alley behind Tootsie's to catch a glimpse of the queen.\n\nHer final Music City performance was a sold-out concert at Schermerhorn Symphony Center in 2015. Franklin, then 73, proudly proclaimed it was her 60th year in the music business, and treated an ecstatic crowd to a 90-minute set that featured “Chain of Fools,” “Think,” \"Freeway of Love\" and, finally, \"Respect.\"\n\n\"She can still fill every inch of a concert hall with her powerful voice,\" wrote The Tennessean's Juli Thanki.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press and Memphis Commercial Appeal contributed to this report."
