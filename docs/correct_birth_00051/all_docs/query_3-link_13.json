He says she's no longer physically here but her music will always live on, especially in Nashville.\n\n\"Aretha will never die from the hearts of Nashville. That goes for the whole country but I'm going to specifically say Nashville. That's who I represent,\" said Washington.\n\nThose clubs are no longer on Jefferson Street."
