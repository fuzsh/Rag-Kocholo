        "text": "The onus is on those seeking to restore and preserve Aretha Franklin's Memphis birthplace to come up with a plan by mid-October, Environmental Court Judge Patrick Dandridge said Tuesday.\n\nDandridge gave the city, receiver Jeffrey Higgs, current home owner Vera House and anyone else with an interest until Oct. 16 to decide how they want to use the dilapidated South Memphis house to honor Franklin, the renowned soul singer who died Aug. 16.\n\nQueen of Soul remembered: Memphis music veterans mourn Aretha Franklin\n\nInterest in the house in which Franklin was born March 25, 1942, has only grown since her passing at age 76. There's no shortage on ideas about what to do with it, but Higgs said he wants to make sure everyone is heard.\n\n\"We could start on something tomorrow,\" Higgs told Dandridge, \"but (we) want to make sure we consider everyone.\"\n\nAt least one party, however, isn't so sure her interests are being taken seriously.\n\nCurrent homeowner concerned about being left out\n\nHouse, who has owned the home at 406 Lucy Ave. for about 30 years and raised 12 children there, appeared and hoped to pay $300 toward taxes owed. Dandridge declined to take the payment, saying he wanted House involved in discussions before the Oct. 16 court date.\n\nAfter the hearing, an emotional Patricia Rogers spoke on behalf of House and said she was adamant that House be taken seriously and share in any benefits derived from the property.\n\n“She is a major stakeholder,” Rogers said of House. “I'm going to send a message to this city that she is going to be respected and not exploited or manipulated.”\n\nRogers added that she has spoken with people connected with Franklin’s family in Detroit, and “not one piece of memorabilia will go into that — whatever they’re trying to do — until (House) is respected.”\n\nHouse, who now lives on nearby Simpson Avenue, said she isn't interested in living in the home again, as suggested during the hearing as one possible solution for what to do with the house. She just doesn't want to be left out of whatever other plans are floated.\n\nTwo pastors spoke on House's behalf as well. Bishop E. Lynn Brown of the CME Church said the church would help House raise money and do anything else necessary to maintain her stake in the house's future.\n\nMore: Remembering Aretha Franklin: 'It's like a part of Memphis is dying'\n\nMore: Lynn Norment: Aretha Franklin delivered a lifetime of inspiration\n\n\"The time has come for this stakeholder to not be railroaded under any political avalanche,\" Brown said outside the courtroom. \"We will stand with her to do whatever it takes for this young lady to be a stakeholder.\"\n\nA GoFundMe fundraiser also has been established to help preserve the home. Started by Memphis audio engineer Gebre Waddell, the fund has raised $920 toward a $250,000 goal.\n\nCity seeks a sustainable solution\n\nRogers gave a breakdown of taxes and fees owed on the home. She said about $235 is owed in city property taxes for 2017-18, plus another $300 roughly in fees for cutting weeds. House also owes just under $800 in Shelby County property taxes.\n\nAttorney Alan Crone, who appeared with Higgs on behalf of the city of Memphis, said he was satisfied with Dandridge's plan to come back in October. He said he thought it would allow time for all parties to get together.\n\nCrone said during court proceedings that the big concern was making sure the site, whatever is done with it, will be maintained long-term.\n\n\"The issue driving this is sustainability over the long haul,\" Crone said. \"Nobody on the scene has stepped up.\"\n\nCrone and Higgs asked Dandridge to set a deadline for a restoration plan. Dandridge punted the issue back into the hands of Higgs and Crone, however, saying it was the receiver’s role to contact all interested parties and come back with a plan.\n\nHiggs, with the South Memphis Renewal Community Corp., was named receiver after retired Environmental Court Judge Larry Potter put the property into receivership during the years-long discussion over what to do with the site. At one time, it looked like the house might be demolished as a public nuisance.\n\nGrant money in place, but no will for Franklin's estate\n\nHiggs said shortly after Franklin's death that those seeking to restore the home were \"in a pretty good position to move forward.\"\n\nHe noted at the time that untangling ownership issues with House was among the problems that have slowed plans for the home's future. He said grant money has been secured and a plan is in place that he cannot yet discuss.\n\nFranklin's connection to the home over the years was thin. Though born there, her family moved to Detroit when she was 2 years old, and Franklin was always associated more with that city.\n\nShe did in later years, however, express some interest in maintaining the Memphis home. Higgs said he spoke to her personally about it.\n\nFranklin, who died in Detroit of pancreatic cancer, left no will and there were no plans for her estate to assist in any restoration or maintenance of the Memphis property."
