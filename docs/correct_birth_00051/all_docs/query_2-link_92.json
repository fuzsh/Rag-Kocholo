        "text": "Cord Martin loves jazz.\n\nThe Whitthorne Middle School Band Director, one of two, has been playing saxophone since he himself was a student in the band there. Tonight, however, he has his sights set on a bigger platform: the stage at Schermerhorn Symphony Center in Nashville, playing with the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin.\n\nThe Nashville Symphony Orchestra will be supporting Franklin, and Martin got the call to join the horn section about three weeks ago.\n\nMartin explained that his connection to the Symphony began back in his days as a student at MTSU. “As soon as I got to my upperclassman years,” Martin said, “I started getting calls to sub for different horn players in Nashville.” Some of these calls turned into long-term gigs, which Martin said he obtained by “trying to work hard and trying to be as professional as possible.”\n\nHis work paid off, as he met and developed a professional relationship with Lloyd Barry, an arranger and composer who regularly organizes professional horn players, Martin says. It was Barry who recommended him to the Symphony for this concert.\n\nBarry telephoned Martin to see if he was available. Martin recalls the September conversation: “He was like ‘Cord, how’s it going?’ I said, ‘Everything’s good.’ He said, ‘Man, how are your flute chops? Can you read well?’” Martin, in true jazzman style, said, “Yeah. Yeah, I can hang.”\n\nA week or so after that call, the Symphony emailed Martin and the gig was set.\n\n“I haven’t really told anyone,” Martin said. “I’m just grateful for the opportunity. I know that I have practiced and prepared myself for this moment, but it still feels like it’s surreal.”\n\nMartin did mention the upcoming show to some of the students in the Whitthorne Jazz Band , and a few of them didn’t quite grasp the concept of who Aretha Franklin is. Others, though, immediately connected her with the song “Respect,” which they have heard, and were excited.\n\n“You can’t not be (an Aretha fan) doing the type of stuff that I do. Being a horn player, most of those pop horn lines, you have to learn them,” Martin explained.\n\n“Her music is timeless. I haven’t dug deep into her discography or anything like that, but I am a big fan. And growing up in the church, she definitely has the gospel roots, so that just kind of resonates with me.”\n\nAs much as Martin loves jazz, he loves his job more. He never wants to stop performing, but his priority is teaching.\n\n“I always want to teach, because I see the importance of it,” Martin explains. “I can play for thousands, like I’m going to be doing tomorrow, playing in an awesome venue, but when I come in here, and I’m down in the trenches, actually teaching students how to make a sound for the first time, and to see them develop and grow, to potentially make more performers that can spread the music, that’s what it’s about to me, the gift of music.”\n\nHe has to take some of his own lessons to heart this week.\n\n“A lot of the stuff I tell my students about the importance of being able to read and sight-read, I feel like it’s really hitting home for me, even now. I’m having to practice what I preach to them,” Martin said.\n\nHe won’t have a chance to see the music until the three-hour rehearsal today, the first and only rehearsal for the show. This isn’t uncommon when players are contracted out to orchestras, common practices for instruments not usually in orchestral arrangements.\n\nMartin will be part of a four-piece horn section made up of alto, tenor and baritone saxophone players. They’ll all also be “doubling,” or playing other instruments in the same show, on clarinet and flute as necessary for the arrangements. Martin’s main instrument is tenor sax, but he has had opportunities to play and record on alto, soprano and baritone sax as well.\n\nOf his co-performers, Martin says “it’s pretty crazy.”\n\n“I’ve met all the other people that I’m playing with and they are A-list, normally get-the-first-call players. So for me to be considered, and to be on stage with those horn players, means a lot,” said Martin.\n\nPart of his preparation for the show includes research. “I’ve been looking at a lot of live performances just to try to see if I can hear what the horns might be like, and kind of what her personality is like on stage,” Martin said. “I’m excited, I’m very excited.”\n\nMartin started on alto sax when he was in the sixth grade, but that wasn’t his first brush with music. His grandmother, a long-time piano player, signed him up for piano lessons when he was in third grade so he could help with rehearsals for the church choir.\n\nIn high school, he realized how important music really is to him, and decided to pursue a career in performance. He earned a music scholarship to MTSU. After graduation, Martin moved back to Columbia to substitute in the school district before becoming a full-time band director in the fall of 2011. He’s been praised for his work with Brian Webster, the other Whitthorne Band Director, in building a jazz band at the middle school, a unique group for that age level.\n\nPresent members and alumni of the Whitthorne Jazz Band were in the lineup for last week’s Muletown MusicFest. The group was supposed to perform on the courthouse steps Saturday, but were moved inside due to the rain.\n\n“It actually worked out better,” said Martin. “The atmosphere was amazing in Puckett’s. The few (students) that stayed around afterwards, (said) they felt like they were professionals, many of them, just being able to play on a stage.”\n\nMost of them had never performed outside of the Whitthorne gym or the Central High School Auditorium, so this was their first real chance to perform in the community.\n\nMartin loved the festival.\n\n“To see some of those students rise to the occasion, it was like they really understood what it was like to perform outside of learning it in a big band situation. Just to see that kids are being passionate about it, and you’re sharing your passion, and you see them wanting to do more, too, it’s a good feeling. I really felt it last Saturday, it was just awesome to see the kids do as well as they did.”\n\nAs for his own performance? Martin said he’s ready, but that he still feels butterflies.\n\n“It is a sold out show, I couldn’t even get comp tickets for my wife. It’s gonna be a full house, and I’m thankful for the opportunity.”"
