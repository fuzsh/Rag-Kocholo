        "text": "DETROIT, MI - The world has lost one of its greatest voices. Aretha Franklin has passed away at the age of 76.\n\nThe publicist for Franklin tells the Associated Press she passed away this morning from pancreatic cancer at her home in Detroit surrounded by family.\n\nFROM PAUL MCCARTNEY TO IVANKA TRUMP, THE WORLD REMEMBERS FRANKLIN\n\nFranklin was born in 1942 in Memphis, Tennessee. She was raised in Detroit and has lived in the Motor City for decades.\n\n\"There will never ever be another sister Aretha,\" said Rev. Wendell Anthony at an event on August 13. \"She has shown nothing but respect and love for Detroit. She's always been a speaker and an advocate for social justice and for liberty and for what is right.\"\n\nSEE FRANKLIN'S MOST SPECTACULAR LIVE PERFORMANCES\n\nNot many musicians achieved the success Franklin did. She won 18 Grammy Awards. That's the third most ever by a woman (Beyonce -22 and Alison Krauss 27).\n\nShe scored 20 No. 1 R & B hits including \"Respect,\" \"Chain of Fools,\" \"Think,\" and \"Freeway of Love.\" Franklin is also one of the top selling music artists of all-time having sold more than 75 million albums.\n\nIn 1987, the Queen of Soul became the first women inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nMany people often mistake Franklin with being at Motown legend. She was never with Motown. Franklin spent her early years with Columbia records. She released her first album with Columbia in 1961. She left Columbia and signed with Atlantic in 1966. She was with Atlantic throughout the late 60s and 1970s before joining Arista in the 80s and 90s.\n\nFranklin performed her last concert in Detroit when she headlined the inaugural free Detroit Music Weekend outside of the Detroit Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts on June 10, 2017. Her last live performance took place on November 2, 2017 in New York City at the Elton John AIDS Foundation Gala.\n\nIn June 2017, the city of Detroit honored her by renaming a secondary street of Madison Avenue between Brush Street and John R after her."
