        "text": "Aretha Franklin singer, Memphis Tennessee - Born March 25, 1942. She has been dubbed for years \" The Queen Of Soul \" but many also call her \"Lady Soul,\" as well as the even more affectionate \"Sister Re.\" As a child, Aretha moved from Tennessee to New York and then to Detroit. At age 14, she made her first recordings in a local Detroit church. She ten had her first two sons around this time. Clarence, Jr. was born when she was 15 and Edward \"Eddie\" was born when she was 16. She dropped out of high school soon after the birth of her second son. Her grandmother took in her sons to help Aretha move on in her career. Among her most successful hit singles from the 60's and 70's were \"Chain of Fools\", \"You Make Me Feel (Like a Natural Woman)\", \"Think\", \"Baby, I Love You\", \"The House That Jack Built\", and \"Respect\", which became her signature song. She currently lives in Detroit when she is not on tour."
