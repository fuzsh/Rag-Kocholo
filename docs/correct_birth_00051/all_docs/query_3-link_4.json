        "text": "Three of the most iconic women in the history of popular music were born to humble roots in Tennessee between 1939 and 1946.\n\nTina Turner, who is technically the biggest-selling Tennessee-native singer of all time (according to Billboard), was born in Nutbush, Tennessee, to sharecropper parents on Nov. 26, 1939.\n\nAretha Franklin was born to a preacher father and pianist/singer mother at 406 Lucy Ave. in Memphis on March 25, 1942. Franklin died early Thursday at age 76.\n\nAnd on Jan. 19, 1946, Dolly Parton was born in a rural cabin in Sevier County, the fourth of what would be 12 children for Avie Lee and Robert Parton.\n\nFranklin moved to Detroit with her family when she was a young child, Turner grew up all over the South (including in Knoxville for a couple of years), and Parton stayed rooted in East Tennessee throughout her youth.\n\nMore: Aretha Franklin dies at 76 - Memphis roots and Nashville connections\n\nPreviously: Reports: Aretha Franklin 'gravely ill' in Detroit hospital\n\nAlthough the three Tennesseans took different routes to stardom, their careers took parallel paths, including a time in the 1980s when the success of each woman coincided into a chart-topping juggernaut.\n\nTurner, whose career launched when she teamed up with husband/Mississippian Ike Turner, saw her first hit with “A Fool in Love” in 1960, followed by what would be the duo’s second-biggest hit, “It’s Gonna Work Out Fine,” in 1961. “Proud Mary,” released in 1971, would prove to be Ike & Tina Turner’s biggest hit in a string of singles that also included a nod to Tina Turner’s birthplace, “Nutbush City Limits” (released in 1973).\n\nJust months after Ike and Tina Turner’s first hit, Franklin emerged from the influential Detroit scene with her first hit, 1961’s “Won’t Be Long.” But it wasn’t until 1967 when Franklin released two of her most iconic hits, “Respect” and “Chain of Fools.”\n\nThat was around the same time that Parton, the youngest of the three women, was establishing herself with her first substantial country hits, “Dumb Blonde” (1966) and “Something Fishy” (1967). By 1972, Parton had scored four Top 10 country hits - including the No. 1 “Joshua” in addition to “Coat of Many Colors,” “Mule Skinner Blues (Blue Yodel No. 8)” and “Touch Your Woman.”\n\nAlthough Ike and Tina Turner disbanded in 1976 (after years of his abuse), temporarily derailing Tina Turner’s career, and Franklin’s success tailed off a bit at the same time, Parton’s star just got brighter as a string of No. 1 country hits (including 1973’s “Jolene” and 1974’s “I Will Always Love You”) eventually led her to a major crossover to the pop charts with 1977’s “Here You Come Again,” a No. 1 country hit that also soared to No. 3 on the Billboard Top 100.\n\nThen all three of the Tennessee natives hit their chart-topping stride in the early-to-mid-1980s. Parton landed at No. 1 in 1980 with “9 to 5,” the theme for the movie that proved to be a breakthrough film role for Parton. In 1983, she returned to the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Top 100 with her duet with Kenny Rogers, “Islands in the Stream.”\n\nMore: Dolly Parton gives updates on 2019 Netflix series, '9 to 5' remake, 'Dumplin'' soundtrack\n\nMeanwhile, Tina Turner rebounded from obscurity in 1984 with the smash solo album “Private Dancer,” which spawned the hits “What’s Love Got To Do With It” and “Better Be Good To Me.” Turner’s career continued to cruise through the 1980s with the hits “We Don’t Need Another Hero” (1985), “Typical Male” (1986) and “The Best” (1989).\n\nAnd just as Parton and Turner were reaching career heights, Franklin was enjoying renewed public interest that led to her 1985 Top 10 hits “Freeway of Love” and “Who’s Zoomin’ Who,” which was soon followed by the biggest hit of her career, her 1987 duet with George Michael, “I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me).”"
