        "text": "Leadership at the Drive-In\n\nI did not expect to learn about leadership at the drive-in movie. Last night I made my popcorn, grabbed a pillow, and headed to the Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop Drive-in to pay my respects (get it?) to Aretha Franklin. Jennifer Hudson is Aretha Franklin in the film, Respect, a biographical film based on the life of the incomparable Aretha Franklin. This is a story of Aretha Franklin’s long and sometimes painful journey to becoming the Queen of Soul. It provides a look into her strong leadership capabilities demonstrated as she overcomes racism, discrimination, and physical and mental abuse, all in her quest for finding her voice and her crown as the Queen of Soul, and the most influential female vocalist of the 1960s.\n\nAretha Franklin Had a Dream and a Goal\n\nAretha Franklin faced hate, discrimination, abuse, and even exploitation, yet pulled herself through it with confidence, conviction, passion, determination, and leveraged her strengths and the strengths of others around her to become her best. She stuck to her values and stood up for what she believed in, when black women were not….well, respected. As a child, Ms. Franklin aspired to be a singer. She was asked to entertain family, friends, and her congregation. But just having talent is not enough. It takes a delicate blend of finding the right people, in the right place, and the right time to create something legendary and unleash potential.\n\nThe Wrong Environment Restricts Franklin’s Success\n\nPeople can have the right skills, the willingness, and the desire to succeed, but the wrong work environment can limit performance and restrict potential. This happened early in Franklin’s career. She was driven, had the skill and the willingness to be great, but she could not thrive because of the work environment.\n\nHer first producer, John Hammond, tried to create the right work environment to set Franklin up for success, but it could have been better. He pushed her into the jazz-blues genre, which limited Franklin’s creative freedom and slowed the discovery of her style, voice, passion, and energy. Despite working with top musicians, songwriters, and producers -- something was missing for Franklin; she didn’t know what it was. Hammond did not effectively facilitate her discovery of what excellence is for Franklin, and as a result, did not bring out her potential.\n\nThe work environment was missing something. She worked in a big and beautiful New York City Studio, surrounded by upwards of 50 talented musicians, yet stayed in a tiny glass recording booth taking instructions from Hammond. She was surrounded by friends and family, including a stubborn father that had his own biases, beliefs, and agenda – and an abusive husband that created tension and anxiety for those around him. For the first nine years of her career, she was in this creatively restrictive environment. The studio was too big, too stodgy, uncomfortable, and not conducive to her success. This work environment inhibited her performance and success so much, that after six albums, Franklin had to pay money to her record label because of lower-than-expected sales.\n\nInsightful Leaders Create the Right Environment\n\nMs. Franklin required something different. Not knowing what it was, she moved to a new producer and a new record label. She connected with producer, Jerry Wexler, a white Jewish male… vastly and diversely different than Franklin. He hypothesized Franklin needed to be in a smaller rural studio, with a small core team of musicians. Guess what. He was correct.\n\nHe took the Memphis-born, and Detroit-raised gospel singer under his wing and shuffled her away from New York and to a small studio along the Tennessee River in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Wexler, recognizing the untapped talent and potential in Franklin, was committed to unleashing it. The environment he created defined Aretha Franklin as we know today and helped to define the music of the 1970s. He introduced her to a small group of studio musicians, The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, creating the right blend of people, in the right place, and at the right time. He crossed the boundaries of gender, race, and social norms during the Civil Rights Movement, and facilitated the creation of something legendary and magical. Wexler, with his innovative leadership, openness to diverse ideas and opinions, would become one of the most legendary music producers and music influencers of the 50s to 80s.\n\nFranklin Thrives as a Leader in the Right Environment\n\nIn the environment Wexler created, Franklin is seated at the piano and takes control of the studio session. Although her husband creates initial racial tension, he eventually backs away allowing Franklin to lead the studio sessions. Previously, she is trapped in a recording booth in New York, surrounded by producers giving her demands, and unable to fully become immersed in the musical developmental experience. Now, the environment is different and it works.\n\nFeeling comfortable and in control at her piano, Franklin displays strong leadership skills. She shares her music, thoughts, ideas, and perspectives with the group of all-white studio musicians, The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, and her new producer. She creates a comfortable and collaborative environment by confidently providing direction, feedback, praise, and critique to her newfound musical colleagues. She gets to know them, explores their talents and strengths, and pushes and inspires them to become better than they are as individuals. She appeals and flexes to their different communication styles, and over time, they congeal and define a new genre of music. All during a time of racial tension amidst the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nUnder Franklin’s and Wexler’s leadership and mentorship, the musicians create the legendary sound that defines Aretha Franklin. They create and record songs like, Respect, (You Make Me Feel) a Natural Woman, Chain of Fools, and I Say a Little Prayer. This earns Ms. Franklin the title, the Queen of Soul.\n\nPulling it All Together\n\nAretha Franklin overcame significant challenges on her journey to become legendary. She embraced her core values of faith, courage, determination, and persistence. As a Civil Rights Activist, she stood up for herself and the black community until her untimely death in 2017. She touched the lives of so many, selling over 75 Million albums with 44 Grammy Award Nominations and 18 Grammy Awards. She was driven to become her best, and throughout her career, demonstrated the leadership to inspire others, tear down cultural divides, provide clear communication and feedback, all to help others to become their better best. For this, we RESPECT you, Aretha Franklin."
