        "text": "The soulful strains of the Queen of Soul wafted across Lucy Avenue and landed gently on a tearful Erica Qualy.\n\n\"It's like a part of Memphis is dying,\" Qualy said after leaving a purple bouquet at the door of Aretha Franklin's birthplace.\n\nMore: Aretha Franklin dies at 76: Detroit star transformed American music\n\nMore: Efforts to preserve Aretha Franklin's childhood Memphis home has been ongoing saga\n\nShe joined others who, along with reporters, began to clog the narrow South Memphis street Thursday morning in the hours after word of Franklin's death began spreading.\n\nFranklin, 76, died at her home in Detroit surrounded by family, according to reports. A family statement said she died of pancreatic cancer.\n\nVisitors in Memphis came to Lucy Avenue to write on the boarded windows of the tiny, dilapidated clapboard cottage where Franklin was born in 1942. They just wanted to show a little respect for the woman who put the soul in Soulsville.\n\n\"She was like a source of joy,\" said Qualy, who has called Memphis home for eight years. \"She was really soothing. When I hear the album 'Lady Soul,' it really speaks Memphis to me.\"\n\nThough most identified with Detroit, Aretha belongs to Lucy. Residents say they only let the rest of the world borrow her.\n\n\"It's always been an honor having her house across the street,\" said James Johnson.\n\nIt was from a speaker on the front lawn of his house that Franklin's music greeted those passing by Thursday morning. But it wasn't just Thursday; Johnson said he plays Franklin's music for visitors often.\n\n\"We play it all the time, out of respect,\" Johnson said. \"I met her a couple of times. She was a very nice person.\"\n\nFranklin's family moved to Detroit when she was 2 years old, and she seldom visited her Lucy Avenue birth place over the years. She did, however, become involved with efforts to restore the home in recent years. Those involved with restoration efforts said earlier this week they're making progress.\n\nMore: Memphis soul veterans mourn Aretha Franklin, recall her musical connections to the city\n\nJeffrey Higgs, executive director of the LeMoyne-Owen College Community Development Corp., said earlier this week efforts to preserve and promote the home are \"in a pretty good place.\"\n\nSo far, a fence has been erected around the house to secure it and Mayor Jim Strickland last year unveiled a plaque outside the home.\n\nHiggs said multiple issues have slowed any plans for the house â€” untangling ownership issues, getting permission from Franklin's family to use names and likenesses, and deciding what direction to go in promoting the house.\n\n\"We've finally figured that last one out,\" Higgs said, \"but we can't talk about it yet. We think we have a very positive message to tell. We have some grant money.\"\n\nRico Scott, like Qualy, said at the site Thursday that there was just something so Memphis about Franklin's music.\n\n\"I grew up on Aretha Franklin,\" Scott said. \"Both gospel and R&B. There's just no other woman who could compare. Her music taught me how to continue to love the Lord. I'm just so grateful she was born in my hometown.\"\n\n\"The passion appealed to me,\" added Qualy. \"I'm a musician myself, so you know it when you hear it in someone else. She's just such an inspiration.\"\n\nAnd the house, Qualy said, needs to stay where it is, in spite of talk of relocating it.\n\n\"Keep it where it is,\" she said. \"I read that they were talking about cleaning it up and moving it somewhere, which is so ridiculous. Leave it in this place and this neighborhood. This is Memphis. Don't try to make it pretty like Beale Street.\""
