        "text": "Franklin also had an amazing touch at the piano. She was a meticulous arranger and composer and wrote several of her successful songs including Daydreaming, Rock Steady, and Call Me\n\nAretha Franklin was a powerful force in the civil rights movements as well. Reflecting on her career in a 2008 Washington Post Interview she said, “Being the Queen is not all about singing and being a diva is not all about singing. It has much to do with your service to people. And your social contributions to your community and your civic contributions as well.”\n\nAretha’s perspectives on civic responsibility and activism were formed early in her life. Her father, well known preacher and activist Clarence L. Franklin, was actively involved in politics and the civil rights moment. Her home was frequently visited by politicians and activists and many of the gospel superstars of the day including her mentors, Mahalia Jackson, the “Queen of Gospel”, and Dinah Washington, the “Queen of the Blues”. By blending politics and art, the activism that surrounded her in her youth remained an important part of her work and legacy, and Aretha Franklin took her place in the long line of Black women performers like Lena Horne, Hazel Scott, Odetta Holmes and Nina Simone who used their talents and the public platforms they had to challenge social injustice and advocate for civil rights for Black people. Arguably her most famous song, “Respect”, became an anthem of the civil rights movement as well as a strong statement on Black female empowerment.\n\nThere are no words that can fully convey the impact Aretha Franklin had on American music, Black female musicians, the Black community, and her fans. The first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Aretha Franklin was the voice and sound of an important era in American history and the cultural history of Black Americans. She defied convention, expectations, and norms by combining feminism with Black pride in her music and delivered it with a voice and passion that was impossible to ignore. Her ability to move among genres allowed her to connect with a range of audiences and is a testament to the breadth of her talent. The impact of her music on the civil rights movement and American culture is a testament to the power of her presence and artistic truth. An unparalleled singer, accomplished arranger and composer, a powerful and effective activist, the voice of a people, a time and a movement, and an inspiration to countless musicians and fans. Undoubtedly, Aretha Franklin, the “Queen of Soul” (and so much more), is one of the greatest American musicians of all time."
