This is where the the queen of soul was born’. Silent for a moment to the sight of the simple wooden shack and the poor neighborhood in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nAretha Franklin passed away today.\n\nWhen The Blues Brothers film was out, THINK was the first soul record that had an earth quake effect on me. Even more than RESPECT. It was its thriving rhythm, the clear loud soul voice of Aretha Franklin and the simple lyrics that got stuck in my head right away.\n\n[…]\n\nYou better think (think)\n\nThink about what you’re trying to do to me\n\nThink (think)\n\nLet your mind go, let yourself be free"
