        "text": "Aretha Franklin passed away on August 16, 2018.\n\nBorn in an old shack in Memphis Tennessee, she ended up owning a handful of beautiful homes, some in Detroit.\n\nThe photos below show you the inside of one of her Detroit homes and what her birthplace in Memphis currently looks like.\n\nThe Detroit house was built in 1929, and Aretha bought it in 1993. You can't get to it, since the road is blocked off by a gate, as you'll see in the photos below...but you can see the house from the gate. It's located on the very private Hamilton Road north of the Detroit Golf Club.\n\nWhether you try to get pics of the Detroit house or roadtrip to Memphis, treat both places with respect.\n\nAretha Franklin's Childhood Michigan Home\n\nMORE HOMES OF MICHIGAN'S FAMOUS:\n\nMotown's Martha Reeves\n\nThe Michigan Home of the Man Who Gave Us “Mony Mony”\n\nWhere Eminem Lived in Michigan"
