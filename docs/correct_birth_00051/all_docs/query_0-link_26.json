        "text": "MEMPHIS, TN (WMC) - The now-owner of Aretha Franklin's childhood home is set to appear back in environmental court.\n\nThere's a GoFundMe account to help turn the home into an international attraction.\n\nBut before it can be made into a museum, taxes need to be paid.\n\nThe home on Lucy Street is filled with decades worth of memories dating back to 1942 when the Queen of Soul was born in the front bedroom.\n\nNow, this home belongs to the House family.\n\nVera Lee House, the mother who raised 12 children in the home will ask a judge Tuesday for a little more time to allow her to pay off the taxes.\n\n\"We have a lot of good memories growing up here,\" said daughter Mildred House.\n\nFrom an early age, all 12 of Vera Lee's children knew their home was special--the birthplace of Aretha Franklin.\n\n\"This is where she was born,\" daughter Nicole Waters said. \"This is where she stepped off. This is her porch.\"\n\nFranklin shared those memories with the House family during her 1995 visit to the home.\n\n\"She talked about her mom and dad in the kitchen cooking also, where we had the same memories with our mom and dad in the kitchen cooking,\" Mildred said.\n\nBut the home later fell on hard times. By 2012, the dilapidated house was declared a public nuisance.\n\n\"My mom, she just did everything that she could to try and keep it standing,\" Mildred said.\n\nIn 2016, Shelby County Environmental Court Judge Larry Potter saved it from the wrecking ball.\n\nNow, the House family is asking for help again from Environmental Court, asking for more time to pay $1,200 in back taxes on the home.\n\n\"Anybody who can come in and help keep it standing at 406 Lucy we would like the help from them,\" Mildred said.\n\nBy preserving this historic home, they hope to one day turn it into a museum.\n\n\"She's the Queen of Soul,\" Nicole said. \"She deserves this.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 WMC Action News 5.
