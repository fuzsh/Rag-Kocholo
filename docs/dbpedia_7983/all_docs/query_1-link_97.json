        "text": "Pannonia Superior was a Roman province created from the division of Pannonia in 103 AD, its capital in Carnuntum. It overlapped in territory with modern-day Hungary, Croatia, Austria, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n\nHistory\n\nIt was as governor of the province that Septimius Severus made his bid for the Roman Imperial throne in April 193 CE.\n\nIn 308 Emperor Diocletian chaired a historic meeting with his co-emperors Maximian and Galerius in Carnuntum, to solve the rising tensions within the Tetrarchy. Diocletian and Maximian were both present on 11 November 308, to see Galerius appoint Licinius to be Augustus in place of Valerius Severus, who had died at the hands of Maxentius. Galerius ordered Maximian, who had attempted to return to power after his own retirement, to step down permanently. At Carnuntum people begged Diocletian to return to the throne, to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine the Great's rise to power and Maxentius' usurpation.[1] Diocletian's reply: \"If you could show the cabbage that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed.\"[2]\n\nCities\n\nSome of the important cities in Upper Pannonia were:\n\nVindobona (today Vienna in Austria)\n\nSiscia (today Sisak in Croatia)\n\nIovia Botivo (today Ludbreg in Croatia)\n\nAquae Balissae (today Daruvar in Croatia)\n\nAndautonia (today Ščitarjevo in Croatia)\n\nSavaria (today Szombathely in Hungary)\n\nScarbantia (today Sopron in Hungary)\n\nArrabona (today Győr in Hungary)\n\nPoetovio (today Ptuj in Slovenia)\n\nLater usage\n\nThe northern part of the 8th-century Frankish March of Pannonia was also called Upper Pannonia.The name can be found even much later in a similar, but wider, meaning. E.g. Otto von Freising (Chron. 6, 15) uses it to refer to Austria (i.e. Austria proper) in the 12th century.\n\nList of Roman governors\n\nPublius Metilius Nepos 106-107/8[3]\n\nLucius Minicius Natalis 113/114-117/118\n\nLucius Cornelius Latinianus c. 126[4]\n\nCornelius Proculus 130/131-133/134\n\nLucius Aelius Caesar 136-137\n\nTitus Haterius Nepos 137-c. 141[5]\n\nMarcus Pontius Laelianus Larcius Sabinus c. 145-c. 150\n\nClaudius Maximus c. 150-c. 155\n\nMarcus Nonius Macrinus c. 159-c. 162\n\nLucius Dasumius Tullius Tuscus c. 162-c. 166\n\nMarcus Iallus Bassus Fabius Valerianus c. 166-c. 169\n\nGaius Julius Commodus Orfitianus c. 169-c. 172\n\nSextus Quintilius Maximus c. 175-c. 179\n\nGaius Vettius Sabinianus Julius Hospes between 182 and 191[6]\n\nPrastina Messalinus after 185 to 191\n\nSeptimius Severus 191-193\n\nLucius Fabius Clio 197-c. 201\n\nTiberius Claudius Claudianus between 201 and 207\n\nEgnatius Victor c. 207\n\nCassius Dio between 226 and 229\n\nSee also\n\nPannonia\n\nRoman provinces\n\nRoman Empire\n\nSources\n\nEpitome de Caesaribus (translation) ca. 395.\n\nBarnes, Timothy D., Constantine and Eusebius.
