        "text": "Background\n\nPannonia Valeria was a Roman province located in the central part of the Danube basin, encompassing parts of modern-day Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Here's an overview of the province:\n\nConquest and Formation:\n\nPannonia Valeria was established as a Roman province in the 4th century CE, during the reign of Emperor Diocletian. It was formed as part of Diocletian's administrative reforms, which divided the Roman Empire into smaller administrative units known as dioceses and provinces. The province was named after Emperor Valerian, who ruled from 253 to 260 CE. It was created by splitting the existing province of Pannonia into two parts: Pannonia Valeria to the east and Pannonia Savia to the west.\n\nGeography:\n\nPannonia Valeria was situated in the fertile basin of the middle and lower Danube River, bordered by the provinces of Pannonia Prima to the west, Dacia Ripensis to the north, Moesia Superior to the east, and Dalmatia to the south. The province encompassed a diverse landscape, including plains, river valleys, and low hills. It benefited from its strategic location along the Danube, serving as a trade route and military frontier.\n\nUrban Centers and Infrastructure:\n\nThe major cities of Pannonia Valeria included Sirmium (modern-day Sremska Mitrovica), Singidunum (modern-day Belgrade), and Cibalae (modern-day Vinkovci). These cities served as administrative, commercial, and military centers, boasting Roman architecture such as forums, temples, and amphitheaters. Pannonia Valeria was connected to other provinces of the Roman Empire by a network of Roman roads, facilitating trade, communication, and military transportation.\n\nEconomy and Resources:\n\nPannonia Valeria was an agriculturally productive region, known for its fertile soil and favorable climate. The province produced grains, grapes, olives, and other crops, which were cultivated in the river valleys and plains. The province also had mineral resources such as gold, silver, iron, and copper, which were mined and exploited. Trade flourished in Pannonia Valeria, both within the province and with other provinces of the Roman Empire.\n\nCulture and Society:\n\nThe population of Pannonia Valeria was ethnically diverse, consisting of indigenous Illyrians, Celts, and other tribes, as well as Roman settlers and immigrants. Latin was the administrative language, but local languages and dialects were also spoken. Romanization gradually influenced the culture and society of Pannonia Valeria, with Roman customs, laws, and religion introduced alongside indigenous traditions. Temples dedicated to Roman gods and goddesses were erected, alongside local deities and cults.\n\nLegacy and Decline:\n\nRoman control over Pannonia Valeria lasted until the decline of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century CE. Following the Roman period, the region was conquered by various powers, including the Huns, Ostrogoths, and eventually the Kingdom of Hungary. The legacy of Roman Pannonia Valeria endures in its archaeological sites, monuments, and cultural heritage, which provide valuable insights into the history of the region and its interactions with the broader Roman Empire and the ancient world.\n\nRoman Provincias\n\nRoman Provincias List\n\nSources\n\nPrimary Sources\n\nSecondary Sources"
