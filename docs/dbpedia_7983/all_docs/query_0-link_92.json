        "text": "Vol.Â I\n\np265 ChapterÂ IX\n\nThe Empire of Attila\n\nÂ§Â 1. The Geography of the Balkan Peninsula\n\nThe misfortunes of the Balkan Peninsula have been almost uninterrupted from the fourth century to the present day. In the fifth and sixth centuries their plight was almost unendurable. They suffered not only from the terrible raids of nomad savages who had come from beyond the Volga, but also from the rapacious cruelty of the Germans. From the reign of Valens to that of Heraclius the unhappy inhabitants might any morning wake up to find a body of barbarians at their gates. As we shall be concerned in these volumes with the successive invasions of Huns, Ostrogoths, Slavs, and Bulgars, it will be well for the reader to have a general idea of the conformation and geography of the peninsula.1\n\nWe may consider Mount VitoÅ¡, and the town of Sardica, now Sofia, which lies at its base as the central point. Rising in the shape of an immense cone to a height of â¢7500Â feet, VitoÅ¡ affords to the climber who ascends it a splendid view of the various intricate mountain chains which diversify the surrounding lands â aÂ view which has been pronounced finer than that at Tempe or that at Vodena. In the group of which this mountain and another named Ryl, to southward, are the highest peaks, two Â p266Â rivers of the lower Danube system, the Oescus (Isker) and the NiÅ¡ava have their sources, as well as the two chief rivers of the Aegean system, the Hebrus (Maritsa) and the Strymon (Struma).\n\nFrom this central region stretches in a south-easterly direction the double chain of Rhodope, cleft in twain by the valley of the Nestos (Mesta). The easterly range, Rhodope proper, forms the western boundary of the great plain of Thrace, while the range of Orbelos separates the Nestos valley from the Strymon valley.\n\nThe Haemus or Balkan chain which runs from west to east is also double, like Rhodope, but is not divided by a large river. The Haemus mountains begin near the sources of the Timacus (Timok) and the Margus (Morava), from which they stretch to the shores of the Euxine. To a traveller approaching them from the northern or Danubian side they do not present an impressive appearance, for the ascent is very gradual; plateau rises above plateau, or the transition is accomplished by gentle slopes, and the height of the highest parts is lost through the number of intervening degrees. But on the southern side the descent is precipitous, and the aspect is imposing and sublime. This contrast between the two sides of the Haemus range is closely connected with the existence of the second and lower parallel range, called the SrÃªdna Gora, which runs through Roumelia from Sofia to Sliven. It seems as if a convulsion of the earth had cloven asunder an original and large chain by a sudden rent, which gave its abrupt and sheer character to the southern side of the Haemus mountains, and interrupted the gradual upward incline from the low plain of Thrace.\n\nThe chain of SrÃªdna Gora, which is not to be confused with the northern chain of Haemus, is divided into three parts, which may be distinguished as the KaradÅ¾a Dagh, the SrÃªdna Gora, and the Ichtimaner. The KaradÅ¾a Dagh mountains are the most easterly, and are separated from SrÃªdna Gora by the river StrÃªma (aÂ tributary of the Maritsa), while the valley of the TundÅ¾a (Taenarus), with its fields of roses and pleasantly situated towns, divides it from Mount Haemus. SrÃªdna Gora reaches a greater height than the mountains to east or to west, and is divided by the river Topolnitsa from the most westerly portion, the Ichtimaner mountains, which connect the Balkan system Â p267Â with the Rhodope system, whilst at the same time they are the watershed between the tributaries of the Hebrus and those of the Danube.\n\nThere are eight chief passes across the Haemus range from Lower Moesia to southern Thrace. If we begin from the eastern extremity, there is the coast pass which a traveller would take who, starting from Odessus (Varna), wished to reach Anchialus. The next pass was one of the most important. It crossed the Kamcija at Pannysus, and through it ran the road from Trajan's Marcianopolis (near Provad, between Å umla and Varna) southward. Farther west were the two adjacent passes of Veregava and Verbits (together known as the Gylorski pass).​2 Passing over the Kotel and Vratniti passes, which seem to have been little used for military purposes in the period which concerns us, we come to the celebrated pass of Å ipka which connects the valley of the Jatrus (Jantra) with that of the TundÅ¾a. Through it ran the direct road from Novae (Å istova) on the Danube to Beroe (Stara Zagora), Philippopolis, and Hadrianople.\n\nFrom this pass eastward extend the wildest regions of the Balkans, which have always been the favourite home of outlaws â scamars, as they were called, or klephts â who could defy law in thick forests and inaccessible ravines, regions echoing with the songs and romances of outlaw life.\n\nThe traveller from Novae or Oescus (at Gigen, at the mouth of the river Isker) could also reach Philippopolis by the pass of Trojan, close to the sources of the river Asemus (Osma). Finally the long pass of Succi lay on the road from Sardica to Constantinople.\n\nThe journey from Singidunum to Constantinople along the main road was reckoned as â¢670Â Roman miles. Singidunum (Belgrade), situated at the junction of the Save with the Danube, was the principal city of the province of Upper Moesia, and was close to the frontier between the eastern and western divisions of the Empire. The road ran at first along the right shore of the Danube, passing Margus (near the village of Dubravica, where the Margus or Morava joins the greater river), till it reached, Â p268Â ten miles from the Viminacium (close to Kostolats), an important station of the Danube flotilla. Here the traveller, instead of pursuing the eastward road to Durostorum (Silistria), turned southward and again reached the Morava at the town of Horreum Margi, one of the chief factories of arms in the peninsula. The next important town was Naissus (NiÅ¡), on the north bank of the NiÅ¡ava, so strongly fortified that hitherto no enemy had ever captured it. Toâday it is the junction of railways, in old days it was the junction of many roads. The Byzantium route continued south-eastward, passing Remesiana (AkÂ Palanka) to Sardica, the chief town of the province of Dacia Mediterranea, beautifully situated in the large oval plain, under the great mountains, VitoÅ¡ on the west and Ryl to the south. From here south-westward ran a road to Ulpia Pautalia (KÃ¼stendil) and Dyrrhachium. The traveller pressing to Constantinople, when he left the plain of Sardica, ascended to the pass of Succi in the Ichtimaner mountains. This pass was considered the key of Thrace and was strongly fortified. Descending from this defile the road followed the left bank of the Heberus to Philippopolis (the chief city of the province of Thracia), standing on its three great syenite rocks, with a magnificent view of Mount Rhodope to the south-west. From Philippopolis to Hadrianople (the capital of the province of Haemimontus) was a journey of six days. On the way one passed the fort of Arzus, on a river of the same name (probably the UzundÅ¾a). Hadrianople lies at the junction of three rivers; here the Tonzus (TundÅ¾a) from the north, and the Artiscus (Arda) from the south, flow into the Hebrus. Another journey of six days brought the traveller to the shore of the Propontis. He passed Arcadiopolis (LÃ¼leÂ Burgas) the ancient Bergule, which the Emperor Arcadius had renamed, on a tributary of the river Erginus.​3 He passed Drusipara (near KariÅ¡taran), from which a road led northward to Anchialus on the Black Sea. Then he came to Tzurulon (Corlu), and at last to Heraclea (the old Samian colony of Perinthus) on the sea, now a miserable village. Here the road joined the road from Dyrrhachium and Thessalonica, and the rest of the way ran close to the seashore, past Selymbria​4 and the fort of Athyras (near Â p269Â Boyuk-ChekmedÅ¾e) and Rhegium (at Kuchuk-ChekmedÅ¾e), to the Golden Gate, which the traveller who tarried not on his way would reach on the thirty-first day after he had left Singidunum.5\n\nWhen we turn to the western half of the Peninsula, the lands of Illyria and Macedonia, we find an irregular network of mountains, compared with which the configuration of Thrace is simple. In these highlands there are no great plains, and perhaps the first thing to be grasped is that the rivers which water them belong to the systems of the Black Sea and the Aegean, except in the south-west where the Drin and other smaller streams fall into the Hadriatic. Thus the line of watershed between the western and eastern seas runs near the Hadriatic eastward to the range of Scardus (Å ar Dagh), which divides the streams that feed the Drilo (Drin) from the western tributaries of the Vardar. The Alpine lands of Dalmatia, using this name in its ancient and wider meaning, are watered by the river Drinus (Drina) and other tributaries of the Save. They are inhospitable and were thinly inhabited and their chief value lay in their mineral wealth.​6 The principal roads connecting these highlands with the Hadriatic were those from Jader (Zara) to Siscia on the Save, and from Salona to AdÂ Matricem, which corresponds to the modern Sarajevo though it is not on the same site.\n\nThe Drina is the western boundary of modern Serbia which answers roughly to the ancient provinces of Moesia prima, Dacia mediterranea, and Dardania. In the centre of this country is the high range known as Kopaonik (mountain of Mines), which with the Yastrebac Planina and the Petrova Gora forms a huge triangle round which the two great branches of the river Morava flow in many curves and windings. The western branch is now known as the Ibar in its upper course and the eastern is sometimes called the Bulgarian Morava.7\n\nThe three places marked out to be the most important inland centres in Illyricum were Naissus, Scupi (Uskub), and Ulpiana. We have seen that the great road from Constantinople to Â p270Â Singidunum and the west passed Naissus, which lay near the right bank of the western branch of the Margus. Another road connected Naissus directly with Ratiaria (Widin) on the Danube, while south-westward it was linked by a route passing over the PrepolaÄ saddle with Ulpiana,​8 which was on the site of the modern village of Lipljan but corresponded in importance to PriÅ¡tina. This town was situated at the southern end of the Kossovo Polje, a plain â¢about twenty miles long, famous as a battlefield in the later Middle Ages. Through this plain ran a road to AdÂ Matricem which passed Arsa, close to the modern Novipazar, and then turning westward continued its course by Plevlje and GoradÅ¾a. Two other roads converged at Ulpiana, one from Scupi, which followed the course of the Lepenac, a tributary of the Vardar, and crossed the KaÄanik Pass. The other road led to the Hadriatic: crossing the hills it emerged in the open country watered by the upper streams of the Drilo, and known as Metochia, from which it descended to Scodra (Scutari), whence the coast was reached either at Ulcinium (Dulcigno) or at Lissus (Alessio).\n\nScupi lay on the great road through the valley of the Vardar which brought Thessalonica into communication with the central districts of Illyricum and the Danube. From this centre Naissus could be reached not only by the KaÄanik Pass and Ulpiana, but also by another road which skirted the mountains of Kara Dagh and followed the course of the western Margus. The most important station between Thessalonica and Scupi was Stobi, where a north-eastward road diverged to Pautalia and Sardica, while a cross-road connected Stobi with Heraclea (Monastir).\n\nThe land communication of Constantinople and Thessalonica with the ports on the Hadriatic was by the great ViaÂ Egnatia.​9 Westward of Thessalonica, this road ran through western Macedonia and Epirus by Pella, Edessa (Vodena), Heraclea, Lychnidus (Ochrida), Scampae (ElÂ Basan), and Clodiana, where it diverged in a northerly direction to Dyrrhachium and in a southerly to Apollonia and Aulon (Valona).10\n\nÂ p271Â Throughout the greater part of the peninsula, north of the Egnatian Way, Latin had become the general language when the Roman conquest was consolidated,​11 except in Thrace south of Mount Haemus and the southern towns of Macedonia near the coast-line, where the Greek tongue continued to be spoken.\n\nÂ§Â 2. The Hun Invasions of the Balkan Peninsula (A.D.Â 441â448)\n\nAt the beginning of the reign of Theodosius an invasion of the peninsula by a host of Huns was a prelude and a warning. They were led by Uldin, who boasted that he could subdue the whole earth or even the sun. He captured Castra Martis,​12 but as he advanced against Thrace he was deserted by a large multitude of his followers, who joined the Romans in driving their king beyond the Danube. The Romans followed up their victory by defensive precautions. The strong cities in Illyricum were fortified, and new walls were built to protect Byzantium; the fleet on the Danube was increased and improved. But a payment of money was a more effectual barrier against the barbarians than walls, and about A.D.Â 424 Theodosius consented to pay 350Â lbs. of gold to King Rugila.\n\nThe tribes of the Huns were ruled each by its own chieftain, but Rugila seems to have brought together all the tribes into a Â p272Â sort of political unity.​13 He had established himself between the Theiss and the Danube. The treaty which the government of Ravenna made with Rugila, when the Huns withdrew from Italy in A.D.Â 425 after the subjugation of the tyrant John, seems to have included the provision that the Huns should evacuate the Pannonian province of Valeria which they had occupied for forty-five years.​14 But soon afterwards a new arrangement was made by which another part of Pannonia was surrendered to them, apparently districts on the lower Save,​15 but not including Sirmium. We may conjecture that this concession was made by Aetius in return for Rugila's help in A.D.Â 433.16\n\nRugila died soon after this,​17 and he was succeeded by his nephews Bleda and Attila,​18 the sons of Mundiuch, as joint rulers. Bleda played no part on the stage of history. Attila was a leading actor for twenty years, and his name is still almost a household word. He was not well favoured. His features, according to a Gothic historian, \"bore the stamp of his origin; and the portrait of Attila exhibited the genuine deformity of a modern Kalmuck: aÂ large head, a swarthy complexion, small, deep-seated eyes, a flat nose, aÂ few hairs in the place of a beard, broad shoulders, and a short square body of nervous strength though of a disproportioned form. The haughty step and demeanour of the king of the Huns expressed the consciousness of his superiority above the rest of mankind, and he had the custom of fiercely rolling his eyes as if he wished to enjoy the terror which he inspired.\"​19 He was versed in all the arts of diplomacy, but Â p273Â the chief aim of his policy was plunder. He was far less cruel than the great Mongolian conqueror of the thirteenth century, Chingiz Khan, with whom he has sometimes been compared; he was capable of pity and could sometimes pardon his enemies.\n\nAttila had some reason for his haughty disdain if he could trace his line of ancestry back for aÂ thousand years and was directly descended from the great chieftains of the Hiungânu,​20 whose names have been recorded by early Chinese writers. And if we accept this descent as a genuine tradition, we can infer that he was not of pure Turkish blood. Some of his forefathers had married Chinese princesses, and there may also have been an admixture of the blood of Indo-Scythians.21\n\nAt the beginning of the new reign several points of dispute which had arisen between Rugila and Theodosius were settled. The settlement was entirely to the advantage of the Huns. The Imperial government undertook to double the annual payment, which was thus raised to 700Â lbs. of gold; not to receive Hun deserters; to surrender all those who had already deserted; to restore or pay a ransom for Roman prisoners who had escaped; not to form an alliance with any barbarian people at war with the Huns; and to place no restrictions on the trade between the two peoples. The prohibition of receiving fugitives from Attila's empire was particularly important, because the Roman army was largely recruited from barbarians beyond the Danube.\n\nDuring the early years of his reign, from A.D.Â 434 toÂ 441, he seems to have been engaged in extending his power in the east towards the Caucasian Mountains. But in A.D.Â 441 an irresistible opportunity offered itself for attacking the provinces of Theodosius, for in that year the Imperial armies were engaged in operations against both the Vandals and the Persians.\n\nHe condescended to allege reasons for his aggression. He complained that the tribute had not been regularly paid, and Â p274Â that deserters had not been restored. When the Imperial government disregarded his complaints,​22 he appeared on the Danube and laid siege to Ratiaria. Here Roman ambassadors arrived to remonstrate with him for breaking the peace. He replied by alleging that the bishop of Margus had entered the land of the Huns and robbed treasures from the tombs of their kings, and he demanded the surrender of these treasures as well as of deserters. The negotiations broke down, and, having captured and plundered Ratiaria, the Hunnic horsemen rode up the course of the Danube to take the great towns on the banks. Viminacium and Singidunum itself were overwhelmed in the onslaught. Margus, which faces Constantia on the opposite side of the river, fell by treachery; the same bishop whom Attila accused as a grave-robber betrayed a Roman town and its Christian inhabitants to the cruelty of the heathen destroyer. Advancing up the valley of the Margus, the invaders halted before the walls of Naissus, and though the inhabitants made a brave defence, the place yielded to the machines of Attila and the missiles of a countless host. Then the marauders rode south-eastward and approached Constantinople. He did not venture to attack the capital, but he took Philippopolis and Arcadiopolis and the fort of Athyras.23\n\nThe strong fortress of Asemus on the Danube, in Lower Moesia,​24 won high praise for its valiant resistance to Hunnic squadrons, which separating from the main body had invaded Lower Moesia. They besieged Asemus, and the garrison so effectually harassed them by sallies that they were forced to retreat. AÂ success­ful defence was not enough for the men of Asemus. Their scouts discovered the times when plundering bands were returning to the camp with spoils, and these moments were seized by the garrison, who unexpectedly assailed these small bodies of Huns and rescued many Roman prisoners.\n\nThe Imperial troops, which had been operating against the Persians and the Vandals, must have been available for operations against the Huns in A.D.Â 442 or 443, but it is not recorded Â p275Â that Aspar or Areobindus took the field when they returned from Persia and Sicily. We hear that a battle was fought in the Thracian Chersonese and that Attila was victorious, and after this a peace was negotiated by Anatolius (A.D.Â 443). The terms were humiliating for the Emperor. Henceforward the annual Hun-tribute of 700Â lbs. of gold was to be trebled, and an additional payment of 6000Â lbs. was to be made at once. All Hun deserters were to be surrendered to Attila, while Roman deserters were to be handed over to the Emperor for a payment of ten solidi a head.\n\nHitherto the realm of the Huns had been divided between the two brothers, Bleda and Attila. Of Bleda's government and deeds we hear nothing. We may conjecture that he ruled in the east, from the Lower Danube to the Volga, and Attila in the west. Soon after the Peace of Anatolius, Attila found means to put Bleda to death and unite all the Huns and vassal peoples under his own sway. For the next nine years (A.D.Â 444â453) he was the most power­ful man in Europe.\n\nThe Illyrian and Thracian provinces enjoyed a respite from invasion for three years. But in A.D.Â 447 the Huns appeared again south of the Danube. The provinces of Lower Moesia and Scythia, which had suffered less in the previous incursions, were now devastated. Marcianopolis was taken, and the Roman general Arnegisclus fell in a battle on the banks of the river Utus (Wid). At the same time, another host of the enemy descended the valley of the Vardar and advanced, it is said, to Thermopylae.​25 Others approached Constantinople, and many of its inhabitants fled from it in terror. So we are told by a contemporary, who says that more than aÂ hundred towns were taken, and that the monks and nuns in the monasteries near the capital were slain, if they had not already fled.26\n\nAttila was now in a position to enlarge his demands. AÂ new peace was concluded (A.D.Â 448) by which a district, along the right bank of the Danube, extending from Singidunum eastward to Novae, and of a breadth of five days' journey, should be left waste and uninhabited, as a march region between the two realms, and Naissus, which was now desolate, should mark the Â p276Â frontier.​27 But Attila continued to vex the government at Constantinople with embassies, complaints, and demands, and as the drain on the treasury was becoming enormous, the eunuch Chrysaphius conceived the base idea of bribing an envoy of Attila to murder his master. Edecon, the principal minister of Attila, accepted the money and returned to his master's residence, which was somewhere between the rivers Theiss and KÃ¶rÃ¶s, in company of a Roman embassy the head of which was Maximin. But the plot was revealed to Attila. He respected the person of the ambassador, but he sent to Constantinople Orestes (aÂ Roman provincial of Pannonia who served him as secretary) with the bag which had held the bribe tied round his neck, and ordered him to ask Chrysaphius in the Emperor's presence whether he recognised it. The punishment of the eunuch was to be demanded. The Emperor then sent two men of patrician rank, Anatolius (Master of Soldiers inÂ praesenti) and Nomus (formerly Master of Offices), to pacify the anger of the Hun. Attila treated them haughtily at first, but then showed surprising magnanimity and no longer insisted on the punishment of Chrysaphius. He promised to observe the treaty and not to cross the Danube (A.D.Â 449â450).\n\nUntil the end of the reign of Theodosius the oppressive Hun-money was paid to Attila, but, as we saw, Marcian refused to pay it any longer. It seemed that the Illyrian provinces would again be trampled under the horse-hoofs of the Hun cavalry, though little spoil can have been left to take. But Attila turned his eyes westward, where there was hope of richer plunder, and the realm of Valentinian, not that of Marcian, was now to be exposed to the fury of the destroyer.\n\nÂ§Â 3. The Empire and Court of Attila\n\nUnder the rule of Rugila and Attila the Hunnic empire had assumed an imposing size and seemed a formidable power. The extent of Attila's dominion has doubtless been exaggerated, but his sway was effective in the lands (to use modern names) of Austria, Hungary, Roumania, and Southern Russia. How Â p277Â far northward it may have reached cannot be decided. The most important of the German peoples who were subject to Attila were the Gepids (apparently in the mountainous regions of northern Dacia),​28 the Ostrogoths (who had migrated westward from their old homes on the Euxine),​29 and the Rugians (somewhere near the Theiss)​30 â all in the neighbourhood of the lands where the Huns themselves had settled. The Gepid king, Ardaric, was Attila's most trusted counsellor, and next to him, Walamir, one of the Ostrogothic kings. On these peoples he could rely in his military enterprises. Before A.D.Â 440 the Huns had made an incursion into the Persian empire, and such was the prestige of their arms and Attila's power eight years later that the Roman officers talked of the chances of the overthrow of Persia and the possible consequences of such an event for the Roman world.\n\nAttila indeed looked upon himself as over­lord of all Europe, including the Roman Empire. Theodosius paid him a huge sum yearly, Valentinian paid him gold too; were they not then his tributaries and slaves? He dreamed of an empire reaching to the islands of the Ocean,​31 and he was soon to make an attempt to extend it actually to the shores of the Atlantic.​32 In his dealings with the Empire he had one great military advantage. We have already seen how the Imperial government depended on the Huns and on the Germans beyond the frontier for the recruiting of its armies. Without his Hunnic auxiliaries Aetius would hardly have been able to save as much of Gaul as he succeeded in saving from the rapacity of the German settlers. Attila was in a position to stop these sources of supply. He could refuse to send Hunnic contingents to help the Romans again their enemies; he could forbid individual Huns to leave Â p278Â their country and enter Roman service; and he could bring pressure to bear on his vassal German kings to issue a similar prohibition to their subjects. That he was fully conscious of this power and made it a feature of his policy, is shown by his stern insistence, in negotiating with Theodosius, that all Hun deserters should be surrendered; perhaps by the device of keeping a strip of neutral territory south of the Danube in order to make it more difficult for his own subjects to pass into the Roman provinces; and particularly by the fact that when his empire was broken up after his death, the empire was inundated by Germans seeking to make their fortunes in Roman service.\n\nSince their entry into Europe the Huns had changed in some important ways their life and institutions. They were still a pastoral people, they did not learn to practise tillage, but on the Danube and the Theiss the nomadic habits of the Asiatic steppes were no longer appropriate or necessary. And when they became a political power and had dealings with the Roman Empire â dealings in which diplomacy was required as well as the sword â they found themselves compelled to adapt themselves, however crudely, to the habits of more civilised communities. Attila found that a private secretary who knew Latin was indispensable, and Roman subjects were hired to fill the post. But the most notable fact in the history of the Huns at this period is the ascendancy which their German subjects appear to have gained over them. The most telling sign of this influence is the curious circumstance that some of their kings were called by German names. The names of Rugila,​33 Mundiuch (Attila's father), and Attila are German or Germanised. This fact clearly points to intermarriages, but it is also an unconscious acknowledgment of the Huns that their vassals were higher in the scale of civilisation. If the political situation had remained unchanged for another fifty years the Asiatic invader would probably have been as thoroughly Â p279Â Teutonised as the Alans, whom the Romans had now come to class among the Germanic peoples.34\n\nOf Attila himself we have a clearer impression than of any of the German kings who played leading parts in the period of the Wandering of the Nations. The historian Priscus, who accompanied his friend Maximin, the ambassador to Attila, in A.D.Â 448, and wrote a full account of the embassy, drew a vivid portrait of the monarch and described his court. The story is so interesting that it will be best to reproduce it in a free translation of the original.35\n\nÂ§Â 4. Attila's Invasions of Gaul and Italy,\n\nand the Fall of the Hun Empire (A.D.Â 450â454)\n\nIf the western provinces of the Empire had hitherto escaped the depredations of the Huns, this was mainly due to the personality and policy of Aetius, who had always kept on friendly terms with the rulers. But a curious incident happened, when Attila was at the height of his power, which diverted his rapacity from the east to the west, and filled his imagination with a new vision of power.\n\nOf the court of Valentinian, of his private life, of his relations to his wife and to his mother we know no details. We have seen that he was intellectually and morally feeble, as unfitted for the duties of the throne as had been his uncles Honorius and Arcadius. But his sister Justa Grata Honoria had inherited from her mother some of the qualities we should expect to find in a granddaughter of Theodosius and a great-granddaughter of the first Valentinian. Like Placidia, she was a woman of ambition and selfwill, and she had inherited the temperament of her father which chafed against conventionality. We saw that she had been elevated to the rank of an Augusta probably about the same time that the Imperial title had been conferred Â p289Â on her brother.​43 During her girlhood and until Valentinian's marriage her position in the court was important, but when her nieces were born she had the chagrin of realising that henceforward from a political and dynastic point of view she would have to play an obscure part. She would not be allowed to marry except a thoroughly safe man who could be relied upon to entertain no designs upon the throne. We can understand that it must have irked a woman of her character to see the power in the hands of her brother, immeasurably inferior to herself in brain and energy; she probably felt herself quite as capable of conducting affairs of state as her mother had proved herself to be. We can divine that she was a thorn in the side of Valentinian, but we are given no glimpse into the domestic drama played in the Palaces of Ravenna and Rome.\n\nShe had passed the age of thirty when her discontent issued in action. She had a separate establishment of her own, within the precincts of the Palace, and a comptroller or steward to manage it. His name was Eugenius, and with him she had an amorous intrigue in A.D.Â 449.​44 She may have been in love with him, but love was subsidiary to the motive of ambition. She designed him to be her instrument in a plot to overthrow her detested brother. The intrigue was discovered,​45 and her paramour was put to death. She was herself driven from the Palace, and betrothed compulsorily to a certain Flavius Bassus Herculanus, a rich senator of excellent character, whose sobriety assured the Emperor that a dangerous wife would be unable to draw him into revolutionary schemes.46\n\nThe idea of this union was hateful to Honoria and she bitterly Â p290Â resented the compulsion. She must often have heard â she had perhaps been old enough to have some recollection herself â of the breach between her mother and her uncle after her father's death. In that crisis of her life Placidia had turned for help to a barbarian power. Her daughter now decided to do likewise. She despatched by the hands of a trustworthy eunuch, Hyacinthus, her ring and a sum of money to Attila, asking him to come to her assistance and prevent the hateful marriage. Attila was the most power­ful monarch in Europe and she boldly chose him to be her champion.\n\nThe proposal of the Augusta Honoria was welcome to Attila, and was to determine his policy for the next three years. The message probably reached him in the spring of A.D.Â 450.Âº She had sent her ring to show that the message was genuine, but he interpreted, or chose to interpret, it as a proposal of marriage. He claimed her as his bride, and demanded that half the territory over which Valentinian ruled should be surrendered to her.​47 At the same time he made preparations to invade the western provinces. He addressed his demand to the senior Emperor, Theodosius, and Theodosius immediately wrote to Valentinian advising him to hand over Honoria to the Hun. Valentinian was furious. Hyacinthus was tortured, to reveal all the details of his mistress's treason, and then beheaded. Placidia had much to do to prevail upon her son to spare his sister's life. When Attila heard how she had been treated, he sent an embassy to Ravenna to protest; the lady, he said, had done no wrong, she was affianced to him, and he would come to enforce her right to a share in the Empire. Attila longed to extend his sway to the shores of the Atlantic, and he would now be able to pretend that Gaul was the portion of Honoria.\n\nMeanwhile Theodosius had died and we saw how Marcian refused to pay the annual tribute to the Huns. This determined attitude may have helped to decide Attila to turn his arms against the weak realm of Valentinian instead of renewing his attacks upon exhausted Illyrian lands which he had so often wasted. There was another consideration which urged Â p291Â him to a Gallic campaign. The King of the Vandals had sent many gifts to the King of the Huns and used all his craft to stir him up against the Visigoths. Gaiseric feared the vengeance of Theoderic for the shameful treatment of his daughter,​48 and longed to destroy or weaken the Visigothic nation. We are told by a contemporary writer, who was well informed concerning the diplomatic intrigues at the Hun court, that Attila invaded Gaul \"to oblige Gaiseric.\"​49 But that was only one of his motives. Attila was too wary to unveil his intentions. It was his object to guard against the possibility of the co-operation of the Goths and Romans and he pretended to be friendly to both. He wrote to Tolosa that his expedition was aimed against the enemies of the Goths, and to Ravenna that he proposed to smite the foes of Rome.50\n\nEarly in A.D.Â 451​51 he set forth with a large army composed not only of his own Huns, but of the forces of all his German subjects. Prominent among these were the Gepids, from the mountains of Dacia, under their king Ardaric, and the Ostrogoths under their three chieftains, Walamir, Theodemir, and Widimir;​52 the Rugians from the regions of the Upper Theiss; the Scirians from Galicia; the Heruls from the shores of the Euxine; the Thuringians;​53 Alans, and others. When they reached the Rhine they were joined by the division of the Burgundians who dwelled to the east of that river and by a portion of the Ripuarian Franks. The army poured into the Belgic provinces, took Metz (AprilÂ 7),​54 captured many other cities, and laid waste the Â p292Â land. It is not clear whether Aetius had really been lulled into security by the letter of Attila disclaiming any intention of attacking Roman territory. Certainly his preparations seem to have been hurried and made at the last moment. The troops which he was able to muster were inadequate to meet the huge army of the invader. The federate Salian Franks, some of the Ripuarians, the federate Burgundians of Savoy, and the Celts of Armorica obeyed his summons.​55 But the chance of safety and victory depended on securing the co-operation of the Visigoths, who had decided to remain neutral. Avitus, whom we have already met as a persona grata at the court of Tolosa, was chosen by Aetius to undertake the mission of persuading Theoderic. He was success­ful; but it has been questioned whether his success was due so much to his diplomatic arts as to the fact that Attila was already turning his face towards the Loire.​56 There was a settlement of Alans​57 in the neighbourhood of Valence, and their king had secretly agreed to help Attila to the possession of that city. The objective then of Attila was Orleans, and the first strategic aim of the hastily cemented arrangement between the Romans and Goths was to prevent him from reaching it. The accounts of what happened are contradictory.​58 The truth seems to be that the forces of the allies â the mixed army of Aetius, and the Visigothic host under Theoderic, who was accompanied by his son Thorismud â reached the city before the Huns arrived, and Attila saw that he would only court disaster if he attempted to assault their strongly fortified camp. No course was open but retreat. Aetius had won a bloodless strategic victory (summer A.D.Â 451).59\n\nÂ p293Â The Huns took the road to Troyes (Tricasses), and not very far from this town, in a district known as the Mauriac place,​60 they halted, and prepared to oppose the confederate army which was marching close upon their heels.​61 The battle, which began in the afternoon and lasted into the night, was drawn; there was immense slaughter,​62 and king Theoderic was among the slain. Next day, the Romans found that Attila was strongly entrenched behind his wagons, and it was said that he had prepared a funeral pyre in which he might perish rather than fall into the hands of his foes. Thorismud, burning to avenge his father's death, was eager to storm the entrenchment. But this did not recommend itself to the policy of Aetius. It was not part of his design to destroy the Hunnic power, of which throughout his career he had made constant use in the interests of the Empire; nor did he desire to increase the prestige of his Visigothic allies. He persuaded Thorismud to return with all haste to Tolosa, lest his brothers should avail themselves of his absence to contest his succession to the kingship. He also persuaded the Franks to return immediately to their own land. Disembarrassed of these auxiliaries, he was able to pursue his own policy and permit Attila to escape with the remnant of his host.\n\nThe battle of Maurica was a battle of nations, but its significance Â p294Â has been enormously exaggerated in conventional history. It cannot in any reasonable sense be designated as one of the critical battles of the world. The Gallic campaign had really been decided by the strategic success of the allies in cutting off Attila from Orleans. The battle was fought when he was in full retreat, and its value lay in damaging his prestige as an invincible conqueror, in weakening his forces, and in hindering him from extending the range of his ravages. But can the invasion and the campaign regarded as a whole be said to assume the proportions of an ecumenical crisis? The danger did not mean so much as has been commonly assumed. If Attila had been victorious, if he had defeated the Romans and the Goths at Orleans, if he had held Gaul at his mercy and had translated â and we have no evidence that this was his design â the seat of his government and the abode of his people from the Theiss to the Seine or the Loire, there is no reason to suppose that the course of history would have been seriously altered. For the rule of the Huns in Gaul could only have been a matter of aÂ year or two; it could not have survived here, any more than it survived in Hungary, the death of the great king, on whose brains and personal character it depended. Without depreciating the achievement of Aetius and Theoderic we must recognise that at worst the danger they averted was of a totally different order from the issues which were at stake on the fields of Plataea and the Metaurus. If Attila had succeeded in his campaign, he would probably have been able to compel the surrender of Honoria, and if a son had been born of their marriage and proclaimed Augustus in Gaul, the Hun might have been able to exercise considerable influence on the fortunes of that country; but that influence would probably not have been anti-Roman.\n\nAttila lost little time in seeking to take revenge for the unexpected blow which had been dealt him. He again came forward as the champion of the Augusta Honoria, claiming her as his affianced bride,​63 and invaded Italy in the following year (A.D.Â 452). Aquileia, the city of the Venetian march, now fell before the Huns, and was razed to the ground, never to rise again; Â p295Â in the next century hardly a trace of it could be seen. Verona and Vicentia did not share this fate, but they were exposed to the violence of the invader, while Ticinum and Mediolanum were compelled to purchase exemption from fire and sword.\n\nThe path of Attila was now open to Rome. Aetius, with whatever forces he could muster, might hang upon his line of march, but was not strong enough to risk a battle. But the land south of theÂ Po, and Rome herself, were spared the presence of the Huns. According to tradition, the thanks of Italy were on this occasion due not to Aetius but to Leo, the bishop of Rome. The Emperor, who was at Rome, sent Leo and two leading senators, Avienus​64 and Trygetius, to negotiate with the invader. Trygetius had diplomatic experience; he had negotiated the treaty with Gaiseric in A.D.Â 435. Leo was an imposing figure, and the story gives him the credit for having persuaded Attila to retreat. He was supported by celestial beings; the apostles Peter and Paul are said to have appeared to Attila and by their threats terrified him into leaving the soil of Italy.65\n\nThe fact of the embassy cannot be doubted. The distinguished ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But we are at a loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart.​66 It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, and it is not recorded that money was paid. AÂ trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short,​67 and at the same time troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy.\n\nÂ p296Â If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.68\n\nAttila survived his Italian expedition by only one year. His attendants found him dead one morning, and the bride whom he had married the night before sitting beside his bed in tears.​69 His death was ascribed to the bursting of an artery, but it was also rumoured that he had been slain by the woman in his sleep.70\n\nWith the death of Attila, the Empire of the Huns, which had no natural cohesion, was soon scattered to the winds. Among his numerous children there was none of commanding ability, none who had the strength to remove his brothers and step into his father's place, and they proposed to divide the inheritance into portions. This was the opportunity of their German vassals, who did not choose to allow themselves to be allotted to various masters like herds of cattle. The rebellion was led by Ardaric, the Gepid, Attila's chief adviser. In Pannonia near the river Nedao another battle of the nations was fought, and the coalition of German vassals, Gepids, Ostrogoths, Rugians, Heruls and the rest, utterly defeated the host of their Hun lords (A.D.Â 454). It is not improbable that the Germans received encouragement and support from the Emperor Marcian.71\n\nThis event led to considerable changes in the geographical distribution of the barbarian peoples. The Huns themselves were scattered to the winds. Some remained in the west, but the greater part of them fled to the regions north of the Lower Danube, where we shall presently find them, under two of Attila's sons, playing a part in the troubled history of the Thracian provinces. The Gepids extended their power over the whole of Dacia (SiebenbÃ¼rgen), along with the plains between the Theiss Â p297Â and the Danube which had been the habitation of the Huns.​72 The Emperor Marcian was deeply interested in the new disposition of the German nations, and his diplomacy aimed at arranging them in such a way that they would mutually check each other. He seems to have made an alliance with the Gepids which proved exceptionally permanent.​73 He assigned to the Ostrogoths settlements in northern Pannonia, as federates of the Empire. The Rugians found new abodes on the north banks of the Danube, opposite to Noricum, where they also were for some years federates of Rome. The Scirians settled farther east, and were the northern neighbours and foes of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia; and the Heruls found territory in the same vicinity â perhaps between the Scirians and Rugians.​74 But from all these peoples there was a continual flow into the Roman Empire, men seeking military service. In the depopulated provinces of Illyricum and Thrace there was room and demand for new settlers. Rugians were settled in Bizye and Arcadiopolis;​75 Scirians in Lower Moesia.76\n\nThe battle of the Nedao was an arbitrament far more momentous than the battle of Maurica. The catastrophe of the Hun power was indeed inevitable, for the social fabric of the Huns and all their social instincts were opposed to the concentration and organisation which could alone maintain the permanence of their empire. But it was not the less important that the catastrophe arrived at this particular moment â important both for the German peoples and for the Empire. Although their power disappeared, at one stroke, into the void from which it had so suddenly arisen, we shall see, if we reflect for a moment, that it affected profoundly the course of history. The invasion of the nomads in the fourth century had precipitated the Visigoths from Dacia into the Balkan peninsula and led to the disaster of Hadrianople, and may be said to have determined the whole chain of Visigothic history. But apart from this special consequence of the Hun invasion, the Hun empire performed a function of much greater significance in European history. It Â p298Â helped to retard the whole process of the German dismemberment of the Empire. It did this in two ways: in the first place, by controlling many of the East German peoples beyond the Danube, from whom the Empire had most to fear; and in the second place, by constantly supplying Roman generals with auxiliaries who proved an invaluable resource in the struggle with the German enemies. The devastations which some of the Roman provinces suffered from the Huns in the last years of TheodosiusÂ II and ValentinianÂ III must be esteemed a loss which was more than set off by the support which Hunnic arms had for many years lent to the Empire; especially if we consider that, as subsequent events showed, the Germans would have committed the same depredations if the Huns had not been there. This retardation of the process of dismemberment, enabling the Imperial government to maintain itself, for a longer period, in those lands which were destined ultimately to become Teutonic kingdoms, was all in the interest of civilisation; for the Germans, who in almost all cases were forced to establish their footing on Imperial territory as foederati, then by degrees converted this dependent relation into independent sovranty, were more likely to gain some faint apprehension of Roman order, some slight taste for Roman civilisation, than if their careers of conquest had been less gradual and impeded.\n\nÂ§Â 5. Deaths of AetiusÂ (454) and ValentinianÂ IIIÂ (455)\n\nThe reward of Aetius for supporting Valentinian's throne for nearly thirty years was that he should fall by Valentinian's hand. One of the most prominent senators and ministers since the later years of Honorius was Petronius Maximus.​77 He had been twice Prefect of Rome, twice Praetorian Prefect of Italy; he had twice held the consul­ship; and in A.D.Â 445 we find him a Patrician. He had a distinguished pedigree, though we do not know it; perhaps he was connected with the great Anician gens. But he probably owed his prestige and influence more to his immense wealth than to his family or to his official career. Â p299Â He was a notable figure at Rome, \"with his conspicuous way of life, his banquets, his lavish expense, his retinues, his literary pursuits, his estates, his extensive patronage,\"​78 In A.D.Â 454 he was approaching his sixtieth year. He bore personal enmity against Aetius and determined to oust him from power.\n\nHe discovered that the sentiments of Heraclius, a eunuch who had the Emperor's ear, were similar to his own. The two conspired together, and persuaded Valentinian that he would perish at the hands of Aetius unless he hastened to slay him first.79\n\nValentinian listened to this counsel and devised death against his power­ful general. One day, when Aetius was in the Palace, laying some financial statement before the Emperor, Valentinian suddenly leaping from his throne accused him of treason, and not allowing him time to defend himself, drew his sword and rushed upon the defenceless minister, who was at the same moment attacked by the chamberlain Heraclius. Thus perished the Patrician Aetius (SeptemberÂ 21, A.D.Â 454). AÂ poet wrote his epitaph:80\n\nand it is said that some one afterwards boldly told the truth to Valentinian, \"You have cut off your right hand with your left.\" Who was now to save Italy from the Vandals?\n\nPetronius Maximus assuredly was not the man for the task. It was his ambition to be \"the Patrician\" of the Emperor, but he reckoned without Heraclius. The eunuch persuaded Valentinian that, being well rid of the oppressive influence of Aetius, he would act foolishly if he transferred the power to Maximus. Bitterly disappointed, Maximus wove another murderous plot. He sought out two barbarians, Optila and Thraustila, who had been personal retainers of Aetius, had fought in his campaigns, and enjoyed the favour of the Emperor.​81 He urged these men to avenge their master, and the issue may be told in a chronicler's words:\n\n\"It seemed good to Valentinian to ride in the Campus Martius with aÂ few guards accompanied by Optila and Thraustila and Â p300Â their attendants. And when he dismounted and proceeded to practise archery, Optila and those with him attacked him.​82 Optila struck Valentinian on the temple, and when the prince turned to see who struck him dealt him a second blow on the face and felled him. Thraustila slew Heraclius. And the two assassins taking the Imperial diadem and the horse hastened to Maximus. They escaped all punishment for their deed.\"​83 The day of the murder was MarchÂ 16, A.D.Â 455.\n\nThese two bloody deeds mark the beginning of a new disastrous period in the history of the western provinces. The strong man who might have averted the imminent danger from the Vandals, and the weak man whose mere existence held Italy, Gaul, and Spain together, were removed; there was no general to take the place of Aetius, \"the last of the Romans,\"​84 as there was no male member of the Theodosian house to succeed Valentinian. AÂ chronicler speaks​85 of the Patrician Aetius as \"the great safety of the western republic\" (magna occidentalis reipublicae salus), the terror of king Attila; \"and with him the Hesperian realm fell, and up to the present day has not been able to raise its head.\" We can comprehend this judgment; the death of Aetius was a grave event. He was the greatest of the three Romans who had been responsible for the defence of Italy and the western provinces since the fall of Stilicho, and he was to have no Roman successor. Two years after his death the supreme command of the Imperial forces would again pass into the hands of a Romanised German. But we must not leave out of sight the importance of the death of his master Valentinian without male offspring. AÂ legitimate heir of the Theodosian house would have prevented some of the troubles which befell Italy in the following years.\n\nÂ p301Â Â§Â 6. Christian and Pagan Speculations on the Calamities of the Empire\n\nAn amazing sequence of events had surprised the Empire after the death of Theodosius the Great. Provinces had been seized by barbarous invaders, and the very soil of Italy desecrated by German violence. The sight of Rome herself stricken and insulted, no longer able to speak the language of a mistress but compelled to bargain with the intruders on her own territory, could not fail to make men ask, \"What is the cause of these disasters? Civil wars there have been in the past, our frontiers have been crossed, our provinces invaded, but since the Gauls bore down on Rome nearly eight hundred years ago, the queen of the world has never been violated and plundered by a foreign enemy till now, and it hardly entered any man's dream that such a horror might some day come to pass.\" In that age there was probably no one who held the view that political and social changes depend on the series of antecedent events and that sudden catastrophes are no exception. It was in the will of heaven, the anger of divine tyrants, or the inscrutable operations of the stars, that men were prone to seek explanations of shocking or unexpected public calamities.\n\nPagan patriots had no difficulty in solving the problem. \"So long,\" they said, \"as the gods under whose favour Rome won her Empire were supreme, so long as the traditions of the ancient religion were preserved, our empire flourished and was impregnable. But now their temples are destroyed, impious hands have been laid on the altars, the worship of our divinities has been proclaimed a crime. And what is the result? Has the alien deity, who has usurped the time-honoured prerogatives, conducted the state to new glory or even to its old prosperity? On the contrary, the result of his supremacy is rapine and ruin. The Empire is inundated by a wild tide of rapacious savages, the dominions of Rome are at their mercy, her sword is broken, and her lofty walls have been scaled. These are the gifts that Constantine and the religion of Galilee, which he embraced in a disastrous hour, have bestowed upon the world.\"86\n\nÂ p302Â Similar arguments indeed had been urged long before. In the third century pagans had made Christianity answerable for plagues, droughts, and wars; nature herself, they cried, had changed, since the advent of this abominable religion. Two African divines had replied to the charge. Cyprian the bishop of Carthage declared​87 that the disasters of his day were signs of the approaching end of the world, and the inference might be drawn that they did not much matter in view of the vast event so soon to happen. Arnobius of Sicca, half a century later, in his Seven Books against the Nations, met the arguments of the heathen by pointing out that before the appearance of Christianity the world had been the scene of as great or rather of greater calamities.\n\nBut in the early fifth century there was stuff for a more telling indictment, and one to which the average Christian of that age might find it hard to produce a convincing answer. And the Christian himself might have his own difficulties. How, he might wonder, is it compatible with a wise and just government of the universe that the godly who hold the right opinion concerning the nature of the Trinity should suffer all these horrors at the hands of barbarians, and that those barbarians who believe in a blasphemous heresy, which places them as much as the heathen outside the Christian pale, should triumph over us and wrest our provinces from us.88\n\nSuch questionings evoked three books. Africa, Spain, and Gaul each contributed an answer, one a work of genius, the other two dull but remarkable each in its way.\n\nThe first, as it was the greatest, was Augustine's City of God. Augustine had been deeply impressed by the capture of Rome by Alaric, and he recognised that the situation of the world called Â p303Â for a Christian explanation in reply to the criticisms of the pagans who made the new religion responsible for Rome's misfortunes. The motive and occasion of the work, which seems to have outgrown its original scope, may account for some of its defects.​89 It is one of the greatest efforts of Christian speculation, but the execution is not equal to the conception, and the fundamental conception itself was not original. The work consists of two distinct sections which might just as well have formed two independent treatises. The first section (Bks.Â IâX) is a polemic against pagan religion and pagan philosophies, in which it is shown that polytheism is not necessary to secure happiness either in this world or in the next. The most effective argument is that which had been already used by Arnobius: the miseries which we suffer toâday are no exception to the general course of experience, for we have only to read the history of Rome to find them paralleled or exceeded. The writer insists that earthly glory and prosperity are unnecessary for true happiness. These things were bestowed on Constantine the Great, but that was in order to prove that they are not incompatible with the life of a Christian. On the other hand, if the reign of Christian Jovian was shorter than that of the apostate Julian, and if Gratian was assassinated, these were divine intimations that glory and long life are not the true reward of the Christian faith.​90 Such an argument was not likely to make much impression upon pagans.\n\nBut the answer of Augustine to the questions which were perplexing the world is not to be found in the first part of his work. He realised that any satisfactory solution of the problem must lie in discovering a harmony between the actual events of history and the general plan of the universe. The synthesis which he framed for the interpretation of history as part of a general scheme of things is an essay in that field of speculation which is known nowadays as the philosophy of history. It can hardly, however, be described as philosophical, for the premisses Â p304Â on which it is based are not derived from reason but from revelation.91\n\nAugustine's conception is that the key to the history of the human race is to be found in the coexistence side by side of two cities or states which are radically opposed to each other in their natures, principles, and ends, the Civitas Dei and the Civitas Terrena. It may be observed that this conception was not original; Augustine derived it from his Donatist friend Tychonius. The origins of both these states go back to a time when man did not yet exist; the City of God was founded by the creation of the angels, the other city by the rebellion of the angels who fell. Since the sin of Adam the history of each of these cities, \"intertwined and mutually mixed\" (perplexas quodam modo invicemque permixtas), has been running its course. The vast majority of the human race have been and are citizens of the earthly city, of which the end is death. The minority who belong to the heavenly city are during their sojourn on earth merely foreigners or pilgrims (peregrini) in the earthly city. Till the conversion of the first Gentile to Christianity the members of the City of God belonged exclusively to the Hebrew race and its patriarchal ancestors; and Augustine determines the chief divisions of universal history by the great epochs of the biblical record: the Flood, Abraham, David, the Captivity, and the birth of Christ.​92 This last event is the beginning of the sixth period, in which we are living at present; and the sixth period is the last. For the periods of history correspond to the days of Creation, and as God rested on the seventh day, so the seventh period will witness the triumph of the heavenly City and the eternal rest of its citizens. To the question how long will the sixth period last, Augustine replies that he does not know.​93 In this connexion he tells us an interesting fact. An oracle was current among the pagans, and seems to have given them much consolation, that the Christian religion would disappear from the world at the end of 365Â years. It was said that the disciple Peter had been able by his sorceries to impose upon the world the worship of Christ for this period, but at its termination the work of the wizard would dissolve like a dream. Â p305Â Augustine observes triumphantly, and perhaps with a certain relief, that more years thanÂ 365 had already elapsed since the Crucifixion, and that there was no sign of the fulfilment of the oracle.94\n\nTo a modern, and possibly also to an ancient, inquirer, Augustine's work would have been more interesting if he had seriously addressed himself to an historical study of the Babylonian and Roman Empires, which according to him were the two principal embodiments of the earthly City. But he entrenches himself and remains almost immovably fixed in his headquarters in Judaea, and the excursions which he makes into other regions are few and slight. Many of his notices of events in secular history are simply trivial.\n\nHaving completed his historical survey he devotes the last portion of his work to an exposition of the ultimate goal to which the world and the human race are travelling. He examines the question of the Last Judgment, expatiates on the fiery death which is the destiny of the earthly City, and ends with a discussion on the bliss which awaits the citizens of the City of God.\n\nAmong the thinkers of the Middle Ages the influence of Augustine's work went far and deep. But his fruitful conception was lodged in a somewhat dreary mansion. If the polemical section which he intends to be a preliminary defeat of the enemies of the City of God​95 had been omitted, the work would have gained in simplicity. But the main argument itself, although it has a definite architectural scheme,​96 is marred by diffuseness and digressions. Augustine did not possess the literary art or command the method of lucid exposition whereby the prince of Greek philosophers compels his readers to assist in the building of the City, \"of which a model perchance is in heaven,\" with breathless interest from page to page and from section to section. There is at least one part which may hold the attention of the reader, fascinated by the very horror, the Book in which this arch-advocate of theological materialism and vindictive punishment expends all his ingenuity in proving that the fire Â p306Â of hell is literal fire and spares no effort to cut off the slenderest chance that the vast majority of his fellow-beings will not be tormented throughout eternity.\n\nAugustine had produced a book which transcended in importance its original motive. But it is this motive which concerns us here. It was to teach the world to take a right view of the misfortunes which were befalling the Empire, and to place them in their true perspective. He says in effect to the pagans, \"These misfortunes are nothing exceptional, they are simply part of the heritage of your City of sin and death.\"​97 To the Christians he said, \"These things do not really concern you. Your interests are not affected by the calamities of a country in which you are merely foreigners.\" This theory might be consolatory, but if it were pressed to its logical conclusion it would assuredly be destructive of the spirit of patriotism; and, though the author would doubtless have deprecated this criticism, he does not consider the secular duties of Christians towards the state of which they are citizens in the earthly sense.\n\nHe was conscious that his treatment of the history of Rome was casual and superficial, and he thought that a fuller development of his historical argument in reply to the pagans was desirable. He requested his friend Orosius, a Spanish priest, to supply this need. He said to Orosius, \"Search the annals of the past, collect all the calamities which they record, wars, plagues, famines, earthquakes, fires, and crimes, and write a history of the world. Thus my general refutation of the charges of the unbelievers who impute to our religion the present misfortunes, which they allege to be unusual, will be proved abundantly by a long array of facts.\"​98 AÂ work entitled Histories to confute the Pagans was the outcome of this request, and it may thus be regarded as a sort of supplement to the City of God.​99 Perhaps it deserves more than any other book to be described as the first attempt at a universal history, and it was probably the worst. But it had considerable vogue in the Middle Ages, and gave currency to the idea of four great monarchies, the Â p307Â Babylonian, Carthaginian, Macedonian, and Roman, corresponding to the four points of the compass.100\n\nFifteen or twenty years after the completion of Augustine's work Salvian, a priest of Marseilles, wrote his treatise OnÂ the Government of God,​101 dealing from a different point of view with the same problem which had suggested the books of Augustine and Orosius. Salvian addresses his discourse expressly to Christians, for he has no hope that his arguments would have any effect upon pagans.​102 He propounds the question: How comes it that we Christians who believe in the true God are more miserable than all men? Is God indifferent to us? Has he renounced the business of governing the world? If he regards human affairs, why are we weaker and more unfortunate than all other peoples? Why are we conquered by the barbarians? Salvian's answer is, We suffer these evils because we deserve them. If, living in such vice and wickedness as we do, we flourished and were happy, then indeed God might be accused of not governing. In support of his argument the author paints an appalling picture of the condition of the Empire. His descriptions of the corruptness of the administration and of the oppression of the poor by the rich furnish the modern historian with an instructive commentary on those Imperial laws which attempt to restrain the rapacity of public officials. Salvian does not forget to dwell, with the zeal of a churchman, on the general love of unedifying pleasures, the games of the circus and licentious plays in the theatre, amusements of which the average Christian was not less avid than the average pagan.\n\nBut, it might be objected, we, whatever our faults, have at least right theological beliefs, whereas the barbarians who are permitted to overcome us are heathen or heretics. That is true, replies Salvian; in just one point we are better than they; but otherwise they are better than we. He then proceeds to enlarge on the virtues of the barbarians, which he uses, somewhat as Tacitus did in the Germania, as a foil to Roman civilisation. Among the Germans, or even among the Huns, we do not see the poor oppressed by the rich. If the Alamanni are Â p308Â given to drunkenness, if the Franks and Huns are perjured and perfidious, if the Alans are rapacious, are not all these vices found among us? On the other hand, the Vandals have put the provincials to shame by their high standard of sexual morality, and if the Saxons are ferocious and the Goths perfidious, both these peoples are wonderfully chaste.\n\nThere is no relief in Salvian's gloomy picture. It must be accepted with the reserves with which we must always qualify the rhetoric of preachers or satirists when they denounce the vices of their age. But the tone of despondency is genuine. He says that \"the Roman Republic is either dead, or at least is drawing her last breath in those parts in which she still seems to be alive.\"​103 He speaks as if this were a fact which was beyond dispute and to which men had already become accustomed. More than thirty years had elapsed since the news of the Goths at Rome had surprised Jerome in his retreat at Bethlehem and extorted the cry, Quid salvum est si Roma perit? Meanwhile the Romans had quickly recovered from the shock and had almost forgotten it. The calamity of the provinces did not move them to alter their way of life or renounce their usual amusements. And the one phrase that is worth remembering in Salvian's gloomy, declamatory book is the epigram on Rome, Moritur et ridet.\n\nÂ§Â 7. Modern Views on the Collapse of the Empire\n\nThe explanations of the calamities of the Empire which have been hazarded by modern writers are of a different order from those which occurred to witnesses of the events, but they are not much more satisfying. The illustrious historian whose name will always be associated with the \"Decline\" of the Roman Empire invoked the \"principle of decay,\" a principle which has itself to be explained. Depopulation, the Christian religion, the fiscal system have all been assigned as causes of the Empire's decline in strength.​104 If these or any of them were responsible Â p309Â for its dismemberment by the barbarians in the West, it may be asked how it was that in the East, where the same causes operated, the Empire survived much longer intact and united.\n\nConsider depopulation. The depopulation of Italy was an important fact and it had far-reaching consequences.​105 But it was a process which had probably reached its limit in the time of Augustus. There is no evidence that the Empire was less populous in the fourth and fifth centuries than in the first.​106 The \"sterility of the human harvest\" in Italy and Greece affected the history of the Empire from its very beginning, but does not explain the collapse in the fifth century. The truth is that there are two distinct questions which have been confused. It is one thing to seek the causes which changed the Roman State from what it was in the best days of the Republic to what it had become in the age of Theodosius the Great â aÂ change which from certain points of view may be called a \"decline.\" It is quite another thing to ask why the State which could resist its enemies on many frontiers in the days of Diocletian and Constantine and Julian suddenly gave way in the days of Honorius. \"Depopulation\" may partly supply the answer to the first question, but it is not an answer to the second. Nor can the events which transferred the greater part of western Europe to German masters be accounted for by the numbers of the peoples who invaded it. The notion of vast hosts of warriors, numbered by the hundreds of thousands, pouring over the frontiers, is, as we saw, perfectly untrue.​107 The total number of one of the large East German nations probably seldom exceeded 100,000, and its army of fighting men can rarely have been more than fromÂ 20 toÂ 30,000. They were not a deluge, overwhelming and irresistible, and the Empire had a well-organised military establishment at the end of the fourth century, fully sufficient in capable hands to beat them back. As a matter of fact, since the defeat at Hadrianople which was due to the blunders of Valens, no very important battle was won by German over Imperial forces during the whole course of the invasions.\n\nIt has often been alleged that Christianity in its political effects was a disintegrating force and tended to weaken the power of Rome to resist her enemies. It is difficult to see that Â p310Â it had any such tendency, so long as the Church itself was united. Theological heresies were indeed to prove a disintegrating force in the East in the seventh century, when differences in doctrine which had alienated the Christians in Egypt and Syria from the government of Constantine facilitated the conquests of the Saracens. But, after the defeat of Arianism, there was no such vital or deep-reaching division in the West, and the effect of Christianity was to unite, not to sever, to check, rather than to emphasise, national or sectional feeling. In the political calculations of Constantine it was probably this ideal of unity, as a counterpoise to the centrifugal tendencies which had been clearly revealed in the third century, that was the great recommendation of the religion which he raised to power.​108 Nor is there the least reason to suppose that Christian teaching had the practical effect of making men less loyal to the Empire or less ready to defend it. The Christians were as pugnacious as the pagans. Some might read Augustine's City of God with edification, but probably very few interpreted its theory with such strict practical logic as to be indifferent to the safety of the Empire. Hardly the author himself, though this has been disputed.\n\nIt was not long after Alaric's capture of Rome that Volusian, a pagan senator of a distinguished family,​109 whose mother was a Christian and a friend of Augustine, proposed the question whether the teaching of Christianity is not fatal to the welfare of a State, because a Christian smitten on one cheek would if he followed the precepts of the Gospel turn the other to the smiter. We have the letter​110 in which Augustine answers the question and skilfully explains the texts so as to render it consistent with common sense. And to show that warfare is not forbidden another text is quoted in which soldiers who ask \"What shall we do?\" are bidden to \"Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages.\" They are not told not to serve or fight. The bishop goes on to suggest that those who wage a just war are really acting misericorditer, in a spirit of mercy and kindness to their enemies, as it is to the true Â p311Â interests of their enemies that their vices should be corrected. Augustine's misericorditer laid down unintentionally a dangerous and hypocritical doctrine for the justification of war, the same principle which was used for justifying the Inquisition. But his definite statement that the Christian discipline does not condemn all wars was equivalent to saying that Christians were bound as much as pagans to defend Rome against the barbarians. And this was the general view. All the leading Churchmen of the fifth century were devoted to the Imperial idea, and when they worked for peace or compromise, as they often did, it was always when the cause of the barbarians was in the ascendant and resistance seemed hopeless.111\n\nThe truth is that the success of the barbarians in penetrating and founding states in the western provinces cannot be explained by any general consideration. It is accounted for by the actual events and would be clearer if the story were known more fully. The gradual collapse of the Roman power in this section of the Empire was the consequence of aÂ series of contingent events. No general causes can be assigned that made it inevitable.\n\nThe first contingency was the irruption of the Huns into Europe, an event resulting from causes which were quite independent of the weakness or strength of the Roman Empire. It drove the Visigoths into the Illyrian provinces, and the difficult situation was unhappily mismanaged. One Emperor was defeated and lost his life; it was his own fault. That disaster, which need not have occurred, was a second contingency.​112 His successor allowed a whole federate nation to settle on provincial soil; he took the line of least resistance and established an unfortunate precedent. He did not foresee consequences which, if he had lived ten or twenty years longer, might not have ensued. His death was aÂ third contingency. But the situation need have given no reason for grave alarm if the succession had passed to an Emperor like himself, or ValentinianÂ I, or even Gratian. Such a man was not procreated by Theodosius and the government of the West was inherited by a feeble-minded boy. That Â p312Â was aÂ fourth event, dependent on causes which had nothing to do with the condition of the Empire.\n\nIn themselves these events need not have led to disaster. If the guardian of Honorius and director of his government had been a man of Roman birth and tradition, who commanded the public confidence, a man such as Honorius himself was afterwards to find in Constantius and his successor in Aetius, all might have been tolerably well. But there was a point of weakness in the Imperial system, the practice of elevating Germans to the highest posts of command in the army. It had grown up under ValentinianÂ I, Gratian, and Theodosius; it had led to the rebellion of Maximus, and had cost ValentinianÂ II his life. The German in whom Theodosius reposed his confidence and who assumed the control of affairs on his death probably believed that he was serving Rome faithfully, but it was a singular misfortune that at a critical moment when the Empire had to be defended not only against Germans without but against a German nation which had penetrated inside, the responsibility should have devolved upon a German. Stilicho did not intend to be a traitor, but his policy was as calamitous as if he had planned deliberate treachery. For it meant civil war. The dissatisfaction of the Romans in the West was expressed in the rebellion of Constantine, the successor of Maximus, and if Stilicho had had his way the soldiers of Honorius and of Arcadius would have been killing one another for the possession of Illyricum. When he died the mischief was done; Goths had Italy at their mercy, Gaul and Spain were overrun by other peoples. His Roman successors could not undo the results of events which need never have happened.\n\nThe supremacy of a Stilicho was due to the fact that the defence of the Empire had come to depend on the enrolment of barbarians, in large numbers, in the army, and that it was necessary to render the service attractive to them by the prospect of power and wealth. This was, of course, a consequence of the decline in military spirit, and of depopulation, in the old civilised Mediterranean countries. The Germans in high command had been useful, but the dangers involved in the policy had been shown in the cases of Merobaudes and Arbogastes. Yet this policy need not have led to the dismemberment of the Empire, and but for that series of chances its western provinces would not Â p313Â have been converted, as and when they were, into German kingdoms. It may be said that a German penetration of western Europe must ultimately have come about. But even if that were certain, it might have happened in another way, at a later time, more gradually, and with less violence. The point of the present contention is that Rome's loss of her provinces in the fifth century was not an \"inevitable effect of any of those features which have been rightly or wrongly described as causes or consequences of her general 'decline.'Â \" The central fact that Rome could not dispense with the help of barbarians for her wars (gentium barbararum auxilio indigemus) may be held to be the cause of her calamities, but it was a weakness which might have continued to be far short of fatal but for the sequence of contingencies pointed out above.\n\nThe Author's Notes:\n\n1 The following works have been useful: JireÄek, Die Gesch. der Bulgaren and Die Heerstrasse v.Â Belgrad nach Constantinopel; Evans, Antiquarian Researches in Illyricum, with good sketch maps; W.Â Tomaschek, Haemus-halbinsel (in S.B. of Vienna Acad. 1881); F.Â Kanitz, RÃ¶mische Studien in Serbien (Denksch. of Vienna Acad., ph.-hist.

These routes became important in the eighth century when the Bulgarians had built their royal capital at Aboba, near Å umla; for they connected it directly with the towns of Marcellae (Karnobad) and Diampolis (Jambol on the TundÅ¾a).\n\nâ¦\n\n3 Not far away was the port of Vrysis, now Bunar Hissar.\n\nâ¦\n\n4 Arcadius renamed it Eudoxiopolis in honour of his wife, but the new name, like so many other names of the kind, soon fell out of use, though it appears in the Synecdemus of Hierocles.\n\nâ¦\n\n5 From Aquileia the distance was calculated as 47Â days.

For instance, the bishop of Marcianopolis used it in his correspondence with the Council of Chalcedon. Priscus in describing his journey to the court of Attila (see below, p283) says that Latin was the language everywhere. Nicetas, bishop of Remesiana (in the fourth century), who converted the Thracian Bessi, was a Latin writer. The Emperor Justinian, a native of Dardania, speaks of Latin as his own language. The first traces of the development of Latin into Roumanian are found in the sixth century.\n\nâ¦\n\n12 On the Danube, near Oescus.\n\nâ¦\n\n13 AboutÂ 430 there seems to have been at least three Hun kings â Rugila, his brother Mundiuch, and Octar (probably another brother).

IÂ am sure that Mommsen and others are wrong in assuming that the province of Savia is meant. The words can equally apply to the parts of Pannonia Secunda west and north of Sirmium, between the Save and the Drave, districts which (like Valeria) were only separated by the Danube from Hunland. IÂ am inclined to suspicion that Valeria was again handed over to the Hun at the same time.\n\nâ¦\n\n16 See above, p248.\n\nâ¦\n\n17 According to Socrates, VII.33 (cp.Â Theodoret, H.E.Â V.37), he was killed by lightning in an invasion of Thrace.\n\nâ¦\n\n18 The indications are that Bleda was older than Attila, cp.Â Chron. Gall. (A.D.Â 434), p660 Rugila rex Chunorum, cum quo pax firmata, moritur cui Bleda successit; Marcellinus, subÂ 442, Bleda et Attila. Bleda is the historical proto­type of BlÃ¶del, as Attila is of Etzel, in the Nibelungen Lied.\n\nâ¦\n\n19 Gibbon, III. p443, after Jordanes, Get.Â 182. For Attila and his relations and wars with the Empire the main source was the history of Priscus. Of this we have one long and a good many small fragments; but we have a great deal of important matter derived from Priscus, through Cassiodorus, in Jordanes.\n\nâ¦\n\n20 See above, Chap.Â IV, p101.\n\nâ¦\n\n21 The pedigree is preserved in John of ThurÃ³cz, Chronica Hungarorum, in Schwandtner's Script. rer.

In this list Bendegus or Bendeguck appears as Attila's father, and Hirth gives reasons for believing that it is the same name as Mundiuch of the Greek sources. He also seems to succeed in identifying the names of some of the remoter ancestors of the list with the names of Hiungânu chiefs (between 200 and 60Â B.C.) mentioned in Chinese documents.\n\nâ¦\n\n22 Cp.Â GÃ¼ldenpenning, op.Â cit. p341.

Britain, as Mommsen suggests, is probably meant.\n\nâ¦\n\n32 Priscus says that Attila thought himself destined to be lord of the whole world by virtue of the accidental discovery of \"the Sword of Mars.\" AÂ cowherd one day had seen a heifer limping, and following the tracks of blood that had dripped from her wounded foot found a sword on which she had trodden, and brought it to Attila. It was declared to be the Sword of Mars â that á¼ÎºÎ¹Î½Î¬ÎºÎ·Ï ÏÎ¹Î´Î®ÏÎµÎ¿Ï to which the Scythians used to sacrifice animals and men (Herodotus, IV.62). So the Alans used to fix a naked sword in the ground and worship it as the god of war (Amm.Â Marc.Â XXXI.2.23). See Jordanes, Get.Â 183, and Priscus, fr.Â 3, DeÂ leg.

Ruga and Rugila are probably both right, the termination -ila being hypocoristic. Attila (as Mr.Â H.Â M.Â Chadwick informs me) could mean \"little father.\" The derivation of Marquart (Chron. der alttÃ¼rk.

The error arose from the indictional dating: 449 was a 2ndÂ indiction, and Marcellinus made the entry inadvertently under 434, also a 2ndÂ indiction.

There had been a struggle for kingship among the Ripuarian Franks; they had appealed to him, and the claimant against whom he decided appealed to Aetius. The route which he chose for the invasion of Gaul was perhaps determined by this affair. When he was already on the march he sent another embassy to Ravenna, renewing his demand for the surrender of Honoria and transmitting her ring as a proof of the betrothal (Priscus, fr.Â 8).\n\nâ¦\n\n51 For his account of the Gallic campaign Jordanes used Cassiodorus, and the account of Cassiodorus was derived from Priscus. This narrative, doubtless abbreviated and distorted in a reproduction at third hand, is supplemented by Sidonius Apoll. Carm.Â VII and the Latin Chroniclers (Prosper, Marcellinus,Â etc.). Sidonius intended to write a history of the war, but only began it. Cp.Â Epp.Â VIII.15.\n\nâ¦\n\n52 We are not told where precisely the Ostrogoths were settled at this period. Schmidt (op.Â cit.

Nor doÂ I think that the words of Sidonius Apoll. Ep.Â 8,Â 15 oppugnatio, inruptio nec direptio (we must allow for the rhetoric) imply that the enemy entered the city. But in this passage we may see the beginning of the ecclesiastical legend, which is expanded in the late Vita Aniani. Bishop Anianus probably did much to keep up the hopes and spirits of the alarmed inhabitants. The arrival of the allies in time to save the city would be interpreted as an answer to his prayers. It was natural to magnify the danger and augment the services of the Church by representing the enemy as already within the gates.\n\nâ¦\n\n59 The date implied in the Vita Aniani, c.Â VIIÂ p113 octavodecimo kal. Iulias =Â JuneÂ 14, for the relief of Orleans probably preserves a true tradition. Clinton (F.R.Â I.642), combining Isidore (Hist.Â Goth. p278) with Hydatius, puts the battle of (p293) Troyes after Sept.Â 27. Hodgkin conjectures that it was fought early in July (II.124). If the Vita is right, the battle may be placed about JuneÂ 20.\n\nâ¦\n\n60 The battle has been vulgarly known as the battle of ChÃ¢lons, because some of the sources (Jordanes, Hydatius) vaguely describe it as fought in the Catalaunian Plains, an expression which probably denoted nearly the whole of Champagne. That the scene was near Troyes and not near ChÃ¢lons (Durocatalaunum) is shown by the more precise notices in Chron. Gall. p663 Tricassis pugnat loco Mauriacos and Consul. Ital. (Prosper Havn.) p302 in quinto miliario deÂ Trecas loco nuncupato Maurica in eo Campania. (Cp.Â Greg. Tur. II.7 Mauriacum campum; and in the Lex Burgundionum, XVII.1, the battle is called pugna Mauriacensis.) It has been thought that the Mauriac name may be preserved in MÃ©ry-surâSeine, which is â¢about 20Â miles NÂ of Troyes, and it may be that the battle was fought between MÃ©ry and Troyes. But MÃ©ry cannot be identified with Maurica of Cons.Â Ital. if the numeral quinto is right. Hodgkin (ib.Â 139â142) thinks that the claims of this locality (as against the neighbourhood of ChÃ¢lons) are made more probable by the discovery inÂ 1842 at Pouan, â¢ten miles from MÃ©ry, of bones, weapons, and gold ornaments (including a ring inscribed heva). PeignÃ©-Delacourt was confident that here was the grave of Theoderic. There is, however, no evidence for connecting the bones and ornaments with the battle ofÂ 451.\n\nâ¦\n\n61 Aetius was posted on the right wing, Theoderic on the left; the Alans, whose treacherous designs were suspected, in the centre. On the other side, Attila was in the centre. The action began with a struggle to gain possession of a hill, in which the Romans and Goths were success­ful.\n\nâ¦\n\n62 Jordanes gives the absurd figure ofÂ 165,000 for the fallen.\n\nâ¦\n\n63 AfterÂ 452 we hear nothing more of Honoria. We are left to wonder whether she was compelled to marry Herculanus, who was consul in that year. AÂ word in John of Antioch seems to hint that some grave punishment befell her. Recording her escape from death inÂ 450 he says that \"Honoria on that occasion (ÏÏÏÎµ) escaped from chastisement,\" suggesting that afterwards she was less lucky.\n\nâ¦\n\n64 For Gennadius Avienus, consul inÂ 450, see Sidonius Apoll. Epp.Â I.9.\n\nâ¦\n\n65 Pope Leo in his Sermo in octavis Apost. Petri et Pauli, LXXXIV (P.Â L.Â 54), probably refers to this invasion, not to that of the Vandals inÂ 455 (see Gregorovius, Rome in the Middle Ages, I.200). Was it, he asks, the circus games or the protection of the saints that delivered Rome from death?\n\nâ¦\n\n66 Hydatius, 154. According to Priscus (Jordanes, Get.Â 222) it was Attila's own counsellors who decided him to abandon the idea of marching to Rome by reminding him that Alaric had died aÂ few weeks after its capture. There may be something in this. Attila's secretaries were doubtless open to bribes.\n\nâ¦\n\n67 It may be noted that in the winter ofÂ 450â451 Italy suffered from a severe famine. See NovelÂ 32 of Valentinian (Jan.Â 31,Â 451) obscaenissimam famem per totam Italiam desaevisse.\n\nâ¦\n\n68 Jordanes, Get.Â 223.\n\nâ¦\n\n69 Ib.Â 254. Priscus doubtless is the source and there is no hint at foul play. Ildico was the name of the woman.\n\nâ¦\n\n70 Marcellinus, subÂ 454. In Teutonic legend the tradition that he was murdered by a woman was preserved, but the lady was Gudrun, the sister of the Burgundian king. Cp.Â Chadwick, The Heroic Age, 37, 156.\n\nâ¦\n\n71 The source for the battle is Jordanes, Get.Â 260. The Nedao cannot be identified.\n\nâ¦\n\n72 Jordanes, Get.Â 264. It is probable that they also had part of Walachia, see Schmidt, op.Â cit. I.308.\n\nâ¦\n\n73 Schmidt, 309. Jordanes, ib. They received the yearly payments (annua sollemnia) granted to Federates, and this arrangement lasted till the fall of the Gepid power.\n\nâ¦\n\n74 Schmidt, 335.\n\nâ¦\n\n75 Jordanes, ib.Â 261. Cp.Â JohnÂ Ant. fr.Â 214 (DeÂ ins. p137).\n\nâ¦\n\n76 Jordanes, ib.Â 265.\n\nâ¦\n\n77 He was comes sacr. larg. inÂ 415â417, and Prefect of the City inÂ 420â421. On laying down this office a statue was erected to him by the Emperors, on the petition of the senate and people, in the Forum of Trajan, and there his distinguished pedigree is referred to, a proavis atavisque nobilitas (CILÂ VI.1749 ). His first consul­ship was inÂ 433, the second inÂ 443.\n\nâ¦\n\n78 Sidonius, Epp.Â II.13, tr.Â Dalton.\n\nâ¦\n\n79 IÂ follow John of Antioch (fr.Â 85, ib. p125), because IÂ hold that he followed Priscus. That Maximus played a part in the fall of Actius is confirmed by Marcellinus; Valentinianus dolo Maximi patricii cuius etiam fraude Aetius perierat.\n\nâ¦\n\n80 Sidonius Apoll. Carm.Â VII.359 .\n\nâ¦\n\n81 Cp.Â Prosper, subÂ a. Gregory of Tours calls Optila Occila bucellarius Aetii (H.F.Â II.8).\n\nâ¦\n\n82 The scene of the attack was called the Two Laurels (Prosper, Chron.Â Pasch. ). There was a place of the same name on the ViaÂ Labicana. Cp.Â Holder-Egger in Neues Archiv, I.270, and Hodgkin, II.198.\n\nâ¦\n\n83 JohnÂ Ant. ib. p126. The story of Valentinian's adultery with the wife of Maximus may or may not be true. The Salmasian fragment, attributed by MÃ¼ller to JohnÂ Ant. (fr.Â 200), belongs to some other writer. The story is also found in Procopius, B.Â V.Â I.4.\n\nâ¦\n\n84 Procopius, ib., where Aetius and Boniface are so described. The compliment to Aetius is weakened by the inclusion of Boniface.\n\nâ¦\n\n85 Marcellinus.\n\nâ¦\n\n86 This point of view appears in the writings of pagan historians like Eunapius and Zosimus.\n\nâ¦\n\n87 See Cyprian, AdÂ Demetrianum.\n\nâ¦\n\n88 The Eunomian historian Philostorgius, who graphically described the miseries which the provinces suffered in the reigns of Arcadius and TheodosiusÂ II, attributed the calamities to the persecution of the Eunomians. It seems likely that he shared the view of those who saw in these contemporary events the signs of the end of the world predicted by Jesus in the Gospels. This view is reflected in a clearly contemporary Apocalypse, preserved in Syriac and translated by Arendzen, in Journal of Theological Studies, 1901, 401Â sqq. (Cp.Â Bidez, Proleg. to hisÂ ed. of Philostorgius, CXVÂ sqq.). How soon the impression of great events may grow faint is illustrated by the fact that Socrates and Sozomen, who wrote in the middle of the fifth century, notice Alaric's capture of Rome as if it were no extraordinary event; Theodoret does not even mention it. We can see from the abridged notice which has been preserved how differently it struck Philostorgius (XII.3).\n\nâ¦\n\n89 It was composed in the years 413 toÂ 426 and parts of it were published before it was completed. In reading Augustine it is always well to bear in mind that he was a Neoplatonist before he was a Catholic, and a Manichean before he was a Neoplatonist. The stages of his thought have recently been studied by P.Â Alfaric, L'Ãvolution intellectuelle deÂ Saint Augustin, 1918. It is also well to remember that he was a rhetorician. His most interesting work The Confessions is marred for modern taste by its rhetoric.\n\nâ¦\n\n90 DeÂ civ.
