        "text": "Medieval Sourcebook:\n\nNotitia Dignitatum\n\n(Register of Dignitaries), c. 400\n\nThe Notitia Dignitatum is an official listing of all ancient Roman civil and military posts. It survives as a 1551 copy of the now-missing original and is the major source of information on the administrative organization of the late Roman Empire.\n\nFrom William Fairley, Notitia Dignitatum or Register of Dignitaries, in Translations and Reprints from Original Sources of European History, Vol. VI:4 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, n.d.). Pagination preserved in this etext.\n\nReaders of this etext should note:\n\nThere is a new edition of the Notitia Dignitatum due:\n\nNotitia Dignitatum, ed. Robert Ireland, (Teubner: 1999, catalogue no. 1552)\n\nThere is also a new annotated translation expected, to be published in the Translated Texts for Historians series, issued by Liverpool University Press.\n\n[p.2]\n\nINTRODUCTION [Fairley]\n\nThe NOTITIA DIGNITATUM is an official register of all the offices, other than municipal, which existed in the Roman Empire. It suggests, our Statesman's year-book and other such publications. But this register was official, prepared, as will be seen, by the \"chief of the notaries\" in the East and West respectively. (See pp. 15, 35) It differs from its modern representatives in that it gives only the offices, and not in any case the name of the incumbent. Gibbon gave to this document a date between 395 and 407 when the Vandals disturbed the Roman regime in Gaul. Bury, following Hodgkin (Italy and her Invaders, Vol. 1, P. 717), thinks that 402 is the probable date from the fact that the twentieth legion which was in that year transferred from Britain to Italy is not mentioned as being in either of these divisions of the empire. But Dr. Otto Seeck (in Hermes, Vol. XI, 71-78) finds some conditions, principally in the disposition of the troops which could be true only of a time before the battle of Adrianople (378) and others which are as late as 427. He infers that the Notitia was drawn up as early as the time of Valens, and corrected from year to year here and there, while left in many parts unchanged; and that, therefore, does not give the exact military status at any one time.\n\nThe text comes to us through four manuscripts, now at Oxford, Paris,Vienna and Munich respectively. The last named is of the sixteenth century, the other three of the fifteenth. The four are exact copies, even in form, of a manuscript once preserved at Spires, but lost in the latter part of the sixteenth century. This Spires manuscript contained several other documents besides the Notitia Dignitatum, one of them known to be of the year 825. Thus the earliest possible date for the Spires MS. is fixed, and its palaeographic form, reproduced in the four copies mentioned, shows that it was written not later than the eleventh century.\n\nThe Notitia Dignitatum has preserved for us, as no other document has done, a complete outline view of the Roman administrative system in early fifth century. The hierarchic arrangement is displayed perfectly. The division of prefectures, dioceses and provinces, and the rank of their respective governors is set forth at length. The military origin of the whole system appears in the titles of the staff officers, even in those departments whose heads had, since the time of Constantine, been deprived of all military command.\n\nPrefixed to the accounts of some eighty-seven of the chief offices are insignia. These were probably emblazoned on the codicils, or commissions of these officers, and they are illustrative of the dignities and duties of those to whom they were assigned. Those of the pretorian prefects display a book of mandates reposing on a richly covered table, and flanked by four tapers; also the four-horse chariot and a pillar with the portrait of the emperor or emperors. The insignia of military commanders show the distinctive shields of the several bodies of troops under them. The insignia of the master of the offices in the West are reproduced on p. 28.\n\nThis translation gives practically everything of prime importance in the text. The spheres of work and the staffs of the chief officials have been given in full. Omissions are always indicated in the translation, as where lists of troops, after a few illustrative examples, are summarized, without giving the names and locations of the various organizations. From the list of minor officials, of whom there are a considerable number of the same rank, one has been selected as typical of the rest, as, e. g., one duke, one count, one consular, in each half of the empire.\n\n[p. 3] The matter of translation was somewhat difficult, owing to the lack of precedents, especially in the case of the staff officers. The lexicons for the most part say of any one of these designations that it was \"the title of a high official of the later empire.\" This is true, but not sufficient for the purposes of this book. A careful study of the functions of these officials, as disclosed in the Theodosian Code, and as commented on by Boecking (see bibliography), has made possible a more exact, if somewhat arbitrary, rendering. An English word which fully expresses the Roman function is, in many cases. hard to find. Sometimes the translation is only approximate, and requires a note. In general, the effort is made to retain the Roman flavor of the original, and not to translate the official terms of the empire by modern ones which might convey a false implication. For instance, it has been thought better to say -count of the sacred bounties\" rather than \" chancellor of the exchequer,\" or \"grand treasurer,\" and \"provost of the sacred bedchamber rather than \"grand chamberlain.\"\n\nBrackets, [ ] enclose words not in the original.\n\nIn this extext footnotes, marked with *, have been moved from the foot of pages to the end of sections.\n\nREGISTER OF DIGNITARIES\n\nI.

THE PRETORIAN PREFECT OF THE EAST.\n\nUnder the control of the illustrious* pretorian prefect of the East are the dioceses below mentioned:\n\n[*] Each of the great officials of the empire at this time was dignified and graded by one of three titles: illustris, \" illustrious; \" speciabilis, \" worshipful;\" clarissimus, \"right honorable.\" The first of these titles is the highest. A study of the Notitia will show the bearers of the respective titles. In general, it may be said that the illustrious correspond in rank to our cabinet officers, the worshipful to our State governors and highest military officers, and the right honorable to our brigadier-generals and colonels. See the references to Gibbon, Bury and Hodgkin in the bibliography, p. 40.\n\n[p. 6]\n\nof the East; of Egypt; of Asia; of Pontus; of Thrace.\n\nProvinces:\n\nof [the diocese of] the East fifteen:\n\nPalestine; Phoenice; Syria; Cilicia; Cyprus; Arabia (also a duke and a military count); Isauria; Palaestina salutaris; Palaestina secunda; Phoenice Libani; Euphratensis; Syria salutaris; Osroena; Mesopotamia; Cilicia secunda.\n\nof [the diocese of] Egypt five:\n\nupper Libya; lower Libya; Thebais; Egypt; Arcadia.\n\nof (the diocese of] Asia ten:\n\nPamphylia; Hellespontus; Lydia; Pisidia; Lycaonia; Phrygia Pacatiana; Phrygia salutaris; Lycia; Caria; the Islands.\n\nof [the diocese of] Pontus ten:\n\nGalatia; Bithynia; Honorias; Cappadocia prima; Cappadocia secunda; Pontus Polemoniacus; Helenopontus; Armenia prima; Armenia securida; Galatia)' salutaris.\n\nof [the diocese of] Thrace six.\n\nEuropa; Thracia; Heemimontus; Rhodopa; Moesia secunda-, Scythia.\n\nThe staff *1 of the illustrious pretorian prefect of the East:\n\nchief of staff, (princeps)\n\nchief deputy, (cornicularius)\n\n[p. 7]\n\nchief assistant, (adiutor)\n\ncustodian, (commentariensis)\n\nkeeper of the records, (ab actis)\n\nReceivers of taxes, (numerarii)\n\nAssistants, (subadiuuae)\n\nA curator of correspondence, (cura epistolarum)\n\nA registrar, (regerendarius)\n\nSecretaries, (exceptores)\n\nAids, (adiutores)\n\nNotaries. (singularii)\n\nThe pretorian prefect of the East does not receive post-warrants*2 for each year, but himself issues them.\n\n[*1] The dozen officers or types of officers here indicated were the heads of departments under the pretorian prefect. All the other officia or staffs were on a similar model. These officials belonged to the political aristocracy. The whole number of officers might run into the hundreds, besides numbers of slaves who did the drudgery. The count of the officials; the proconsul of Africa, 400; the vicar of Africa, 300; the sacred bounties, 224 regular assistants and 610 supernumeraries. The beginning of a civil service career under the pretorian prefect for a Roman gentleman, after a training in the law, was the post of \"treasury advocate\" of whom we are told that there were at one time 150 under a single prefect.\n\nThe officials named in the text received high salaries. After working through to the highest staff position, which was commonly held for either one or two years, they were eligible for the lower governorships, as presidents or correctors. and so on till the highest stations were reached.\n\nThe Latin titles have been given to make it clear that the translation cannot be an exact equivalent for the terms in use under a system so different from anything now in existence.\n\n[*2] The cursus publicus was the post-service for the conveyance of government dispatches and of government officials. It was elaborately organized and very effective. Its control was in the bands of the pretorian prefects. Its control was in the hands of the pretorian prefects and and the master's of the offices. Other officers were limited in their use of this service, as the last paragraph of each chapter in the Notitia shows. There is no reference to this service in the Notitia of the West, though there is no reason to doubt that the regulations there were similar.\n\nIII.
