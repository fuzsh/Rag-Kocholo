        "text": "General Description : Serie: 714, Type: R, Stamps in serie: 1\n\nMotif: a panoramic view of one of the streets in Sisak and a photography of the Old Bridge (photography by: Marko Čolić) Author: Hrvoje Šercar, graphic designer from Zagreb Sisak is situated in central Croatia, located at the confluence of the three rivers – Kupa, Sava and Odra. A favourable geographic position has marked a historical development of this town. Cross over point from the littoral zone into a Pannonian plane, determined the importance of the town from its prehistoric times. Ilyric and later on Celtic tribes established a settlement called Segestica in the 4th century B.C. Roman authority was felt in that area already in the 2nd century B.C, and in the year 35 B.C. Roman Commander Octavian with his soldiers conquered the town thus fortifying its authority in the region. After Romans had conquered Segestica they built Siscia. Siscia soon became one of the capital towns of the Roman Province in the Pannonian region. In the year 71 a town gained the status of a colony (Colonia Flavia Siscia), at the end of the 3rd century is called Colonia Septimia Siscia Augusta, and in the year 297 became the capital town of the Province of Pannonia Savia. The town became one of the urban centres of the Roman Empire with well organised craft, trade, outstanding infrastructure (water supply, sewage system, road lay out, military units, a theatre and empire mint) and was fortified by a strong defence wall. Numerous archaeological findings even those uncovered today represent the evidence that at the Roman time Sisak played special importance. However at the time of the great migration in the 7th century the importance of Sisak declined when most probably the town was devastated and pillaged as the towns of Sirmium and Salona. The first Christians came to Siscia relatively soon, and the town became a centre of bishopric at the end of the 3rd century. The best known Bishop was St. Kvirin who was martyred in the 4th century. St. Kvirin is patron of the town of Sisak. By the migration of Croats in this area, Sisak became one of the capital towns of the Croatian State in the Early Middle Ages. In the 9th century, the prince Ljudevit Posavski who came into conflict and fought wars against the Francs chose for his stronghold the town of Sisak. After his defeat, Sisak had gradually experienced stagnation. With the establishment of the Zagreb Bishopric in the year 1094 Sisak ceased to present the centre of bishopric, and from the 13th century Sisak came under the ownership of the Bishop of Zagreb as a feud and remained under his authority until the year 1851. The most important event in that period, which earmarked not only the history of the town but also the Central European region was a battle fought against the Turks on 22nd June 1593, Turks were heavily defeated and Croats were victors. As the memory to that great battle stands the Old Town citadel, close to the estuary of Kupa and Sava. In the second half of the 18th century when the Turks were driven away outside the Croatian borders, the town rose to prominence again. The town was economically developing thanks to the opening of river transport. At that time on the right bank of the river Kupa, opposite to the centre of the town of Sisak, a Cordon militair was built, representing the integral part of Vojna krajina, a defence border against the Turks. Sisak shall remain divided into two parts up to the year 1874, when the two parts of the town finally reunited into a uniform city. At the time of reunification the town had well developed river trade and craft, the important railway to Zagreb was built and a wooden bridge over the Kupa river, uniting the two parts of the town. In the 18th century a parish church of Sv. Križ (1765) and «Mali kaptol» as a catering establishment were built. In the period from the19th century up to the 20th century numerous buildings have been built. The most famous «Veliki kaptol» was built as a catering establishment identical to «Mali kaptol», opened for numerous boatmen and traders who used to reside in Sisak. In the 20th century, apart from commerce and craft, the strongest branch of economy –industry, triggered reconstruction of the town, influx of citizens and Sisak became one of the most industrially developed centres(industry of oil and metallurgy, chemical industry, river transport). Sisak took part in the antifascist movement, on 22nd June 1941, in the nearby wood Brezovica local resistance fighters established a first partisan unit in this region. Since the end of the Second World War, the town of Sisak has become one of the most industrially developed towns of the Yugoslav state (Iron and Steel works «Sisak», INA – Oil Refinery, Radonja, Dunavi Lloyd, Segestica, Siscia). During the war in Croatia from the year 1991 until 1995 Sisak was on the first battlefield line and suffered considerable destruction. From the end of the war up to the present time, Sisak has been economically recovering with the perspective of even more intense progress after the completion of the highway «Zagreb – Sisak» under construction."
