        "text": "Theoretical models of past human landscapes have become more and more detailed and accurate in recent years. Growing accuracy and availability of historic and environmental spatial datasets and the widespread use of GIS methods contributed fundamentally to this process, as they help us in one of the key figures of it: understanding the drivers and factors of human habitation through the analysis of settlement patterns. Mapping out these patterns has therefore become an essential part of our research on the social dynamics of Roman era southern Transdanubia, concentrating mainly on Hungary’s Tolna, Somogy and Baranya counties. By utilizing recent advances in non-invasive site detection techniques (such as GPS-aided large-scale field surveys), we have examined a number of micro-regions in the area, each as similar in their environmental and observation characteristics as possible. We then surveyed these areas in their entirety. These surveys gave us the opportunity to map out not only the complete distribution of sites and find material in these regions, but also the empty areas between the different settlements. While these off-site areas were often excluded from the analysis of past surveying efforts, they form an integral part of any human landscape as the parts utilized by the inhabitants of local settlements. They may also indicate various social or economic factors that could influence where and how people settled. As such, the analysis of these areas is vital not only to the understanding of these complex human landscapes, but to their modeling as well. The presentation aims to discuss our approach to these off-site areas, the impact of their incorporation into the assessment of micro-regional structures and the creation of a more accurate model on central Pannonia’s Roman landscape.\n\nLate Antique hilltop settlements have played a somewhat minor role in the research agenda in the Pannonia region, partly owing to the topography of the area, and partly because research has paid greater attention to the prehistoric occupation phases at individual sites. Over the last few decades, however, some sites have been (re)discovered, altering the distribution of known defended hilltop settlements, increasing their number in western and southern Pannonia and bringing to light new aspects of the settlement dynamic of these regions in Late Antiquity. The present contribution gives a brief overview of the state of research in the Pannonia region and presents three hilltop settlements of the 4th to 6th centuries AD located north of the Sava River: Velem-Szent Vid in Pannonia I (present-day Hungary), and Lonja-Gradišče and Lobor-Majka Božja Gorska in Savia (present-day Croatia). The investigations undertaken at these sites are chronicled, and the structures and assemblages recovered summarised; a discussion of their chronology and function within the context set by further sites in Noricum and Pannonia follows. On this basis we present preliminary conclusions and formulate elements of a future research agenda.\n\nOne of the fundamental events in the formation of the medieval European continent was the transition to more complex organisational structures, even for the inhabitants of the territories beyond the Roman limes. The historical-social transformation movement of the western European world and the new multiethnic composition of the new Roman-Germanic societies were only two of the consequences of the collapse of the division between the highly-developed Mediterranean world and the areas not directly controlled by Rome where, however, stable socioeconomic organisational forms had still developed, involving both the steppe and the Germanic populations. Even if it never was an insuperable boundary for all those who lived in the areas not under Roman control , the limes forever lost that ideological concept of barrier and border between two diverse and opposing worlds. The mechanism that caused such consequences involved very complex processes that, as they occurred, affected the environmental geographic conditions as well as the local traditions and ethnic affinities. The populations that continued to live in the areas beyond the Pannonian border introduced themselves into the stream of cultural transformations that arose in that part of the post-Roman European territories between Late Antiquity and the early medieval centuries. It would still be several centuries before this change would complete its natural cycle. In the end, the tribal societies disappeared and new social and cultural structures arose. This helped to spread new ways of using nature, new standards for social coexistence and a new vision of the world. 1. THE BALKAN AREAS AS THE CROSSROADS OF CULTURES In 364, following Jovian's death in Ancyra, the commanders of the regiments and other high-ranking imperial officials chose Valentinian, a Pannonian officer and a Christian, to succeed him as emperor; in turn, Valenti-nian personally proclaimed his brother Valens Augustus on 28 March of that year. 1 The end of the Constantine dynasty led to a return to the system of the 'military monarchy' of the third century and, as was the case under the Tetrarchy, to the division of East and West into two areas, assigning the pars ori-entis to Valens and the pars occidentis to Valentinian. Given that they had to deal with the problem of defending the imperial boundaries, the emperors lived more and more frequently at their residences near the borders – Treviri, Antioch and Constantinople – rather than Rome. 2 In the western areas, Valentinian had to deal with constant raids by the Alamanni in Gaul, the Picts and the Scots in Britannia, and the Sarmatians and the Quadi along the Danube. Valentinian died in Pannonia in 375 and was immediately succeeded by his son Gratian and half-brother Valentinian II, although the latter was appointed upon the advice of the magister militum per Illyricum, the Frank Merobaud, solely to garner the loyalty of the imperial regiments. 3"
