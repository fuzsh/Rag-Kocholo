        "text": "Andautonia is rarely mentioned in ancient literary sources so that the history of this Roman town can be reconstructed by the results of the past archaeological researches, and in line with general historical events in the region. Plenty of information are also revealed in the well-preserved epigraphic monuments.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the Romans this territory was probably inhabited by Pannonian tribes, pre-Celtic population, linguistically cognate to the Illyrians, which, as mentioned by Appian, was divided in numerous smaller tribes. The arrival of the Celts, probably at the end of the 4th century, and their migrations changed the ethnic picture of the territory of the future town of Andautonia, and according to the archaeological finds it can be traced from the end of the 2nd century BC by the spread of the Celtic tribe Taurisci to the east. During archaeological research in this area the indigenous tradition was noticed even on the finds from the Roman age, which testifies about lasting existence of customs and production by the Celtic and Pannonian tribes.\n\nAccording to Roman writer Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD) this area was inhabited by the Illyrian-Pannonian tribe of Varciani. In view of the Latin form of the name we can assume that they were one of the groups organised and named by Romans, in this case they were probably named after the settlement – Varceia. Since the position of the settlement is unknown, the issue of the location of the Varciani’s in the Andautonian territory remains open.\n\nSince Andautonia emerged at the place where a prehistoric road crossed the Sava, it is certain that the Romans realised the strategic importance of the location very early. The entire Sava plain including the area of the future town of Andautonia must have come under the Roman rule as early as 35 BC, when Segestica was conquered, or during the Tiberius’s invasion in the second decade BC at the latest. Roman historian Dio Cassius reported about a thirty-day siege of Segestica, when Octavian (later on Roman Emperor Augustus) used ships supplied by the allies from the neighbourhood. These allies might have also been the tribes inhabiting the territory of the future town of Andautonia, which means that the Romans relatively peacefully gained control over the region. This could also be the reason this tribe has not been mentioned in literary sources unlike some other regions (e.g. Yapodic) where severe battles were fought.\n\nAlthough archaeological excavations apart from so me individual finds from the last decades of the 1st century (legion Denars, Emperor Augustus’s coin) have not so far confirmed it, it is possible to presume that, at the period after the conquer of Segestica, the army was stationed here, which at the time enabled the Romans to secure the area of what today are Turopolje and Posavina up to the Sava. As the past researches gave no confirmation about a pre-historic settlement at the place of the Roman town of Andautonia, it is probable that the Roman settlers founded the town, possibly by an early military camp fortifying the boundary on the Sava.\n\nOnly a few finds from the prehistoric age were discovered in the territory of Ščitarjevo by now. During the 1994 research in the centre of the village, along the cincture of St. Martin’s church, several fragments of the pottery as belonging to the Lasinja culture and the late Bronze Age were discovered.\n\nIn the southern part of Ščitarjevo, in the area of Kutelo, just by the place where the probably Roman, that is, pre-historic road crossed the Sava, a hollow axe (kelt) from the late Bronze Age was accidentally discovered in 1961.\n\nAccording to the majority of materials the development of the Roman town can be observed from the first decade of the 1st century. This coincides with the period after the Pannonian-Illyrian rebellion (6-9 AD), followed by the complete pacification of the region, while the boundaries of the Empire stabilise on the Drava and the Danube. The peace following the rebellion at the territory of the entire Empire is reflected in the development of Roman town Andautonia, which experienced its greatest prosperity in the 2nd century AD.\n\nInformation preserved on epigraphic monuments points to the conclusion that the territory, that is, the wider area around Andautonia, was legally established as a territorial community of indigenous population Respublica Andavtoniesivm – its centre being in Andautonia, which had the status of municipium – a town which had autonomous administration in the 1st century already.\n\nAs the Roman Empire was divided into provinces, Andautonian territory belonged to the province of Pannonia, and since the 2nd century, after the Trajan’s reforms, in the province of Upper Pannonia. In the 4th century, as the Empire was reorganised under Diocletian, this region was situated in Pannonia Savia, with Siscia as its capital.\n\nConstruction phases noticed on some objects indicate destructions during the so-called Marcoman wars (166-175) as well as reconstructions and alterations during the 3rd century. In the 4th century, there are some major changes in the manner of construction and in the repertoire of the finds in general, which is the consequence of general events and insecurity in this part of the Empire with civil wars, barbaric invasions and settlements. The latest finds date from the end of the 4th century, while according to past research the life in the region starts again only during the 11th century, which is indicated by the discovery of the graves found around today’s church during archaeological excavations in 1994-1999.\n\nProof of Andautonia’s importance on prominent roads and its strategic importance is given in the work of Claudius Ptolemy (90-168), mentioning it was on the road Neviodunum (Drnovo near Krško)-Bononia (Bonoštar), and in the Itinerarium\n\nAntonini from the end of the 3rd century as being on the road Poetovio-Aqua Viva-Pirry-Dautonia- Siscia.\n\nPhotos:\n\nPots (handmade), pottery, 1st c.\n\nLegion Denar, silver, 32-31 BC\n\nCoin of Emperor Augustus, 15-13 BC\n\nDice, bone, size 1,5 cm, 1st-4th c.\n\nBrick with Roman sandal print, lenght 43 cm, 2nd-3rd c.\n\nMarble board with the relief of Nemesis, detail, 2nd/3rd c."
