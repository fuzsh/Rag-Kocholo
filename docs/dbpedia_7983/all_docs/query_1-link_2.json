        "text": "Hello and welcome to Rome Across Europe! It has been a few weeks since we have ventured to see any new places of interest, either via video or an in-depth article.\n\nWell that streak ends now. With so much to ever possibly think about covering it makes for an exciting time for we have all the Imperium Rōmānum to cover.\n\nHaving this luxury, today we head to the Danube to discover Pannonia!\n\nPannonia was an ancient Provincia Romanum with a north and eastern border of the Danube, which has the same boundaries westward with Noricum and upper Italia, and southward with Dalmatia and upper Moesia.\n\nPannonia was located over the territory of the present-day western Hungary, eastern Austria, northern Croatia, north-western Serbia, northern Slovenia, western Slovakia and northern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Suffice it to say that Pannonia was a large overall territory.\n\nPrior to Roman Conquest the original inhabitants of this area known to history were the Pannonii, a group of Indo-European tribes akin to Illyrii. From the 4th Century BC onward Pannonia was invaded by various Celtic tribes.\n\nUntil 35 BC little is known of Pannonia. It was then that its inhabitants, allies of the Dalmatae, were attacked by Augustus on his path to conquer and occupy Siscia (Sisak). The country was not, however, definitively subdued by the Romans until 9 BC.\n\nThis was when it was incorporated into Illyricum. The Empire’s frontier was thus extended as far as the Danube.\n\nUnder Roman Rule the Pannonians, Dalmatians and other Illyrian tribes, engaged in the so-called Bellum Batonianum in AD 6. All tribes were overcome by Tiberius and Germanicus, after a hard-fought campaign which lasted for 3 years.\n\nAfter the rebellion was crushed in AD 9, the province of Illyricum was dissolved, and its lands were divided between the new provinces of Pannonia in the north and Dalmatia in the south. The date of the division is unknown, but it was most likely around AD 20-50.\n\nThe proximity of dangerous barbarian tribes, such as the Quadi and Marcomanni, necessitated the presence of a large number of troops. Numerous castra were built on the bank of the Danube, with 7 Legiones added later.\n\nSometime between the years 102 and 107 AD, between the First and Second Dacian War, Trajan divided the province into Pannonia Superior (western part with the capital Carnuntum), and Pannonia Inferior (eastern part with the capitals in Aquincum and Sirmium).\n\nAccording to Ptolemy, these divisions were separated by a line drawn from Arrabona in the north to Serbinum in the south. Later, the boundary was placed further east. The whole country was sometimes called the Pannoniae.\n\nPannonia Superior was under the Consular Legatus, who had formerly administered the single province, and with 3 Legiones under his control. Pannonia Inferior was initially under a Praefectus Legatus with a single Legio as garrison.\n\nAfter Marcus Aurelius, Pannonia Inferior was also put under a Consular Legatus but still with only a single Legio. The frontier on the Danube was protected by the establishment of the colonies Aelia Mursia and Aelia Aquincum by Emperor Hadrian.\n\nUnder Diocletian a fourfold division of the country was made:\n\nPannonia Prima in the northwest, with capital in Sabaria; Pannonia Valeria in the northeast, with capital in Sopianae; Pannonia Savia in the southwest, with capital in Siscia; and Pannonia Secunda in the southeast, with capital in Sirmium.\n\nDiocletian also moved parts of today’s Slovenia out of Pannonia and incorporated them in Noricum. In 324 AD Constantine the Great enlarged the borders of Roman Pannonia to the east, annexing the plains of what are now eastern Hungary, northern Serbia and western Romania up to the limes that he created: the Limes Sarmatiae.\n\nIn the 4th-5th Century, one of the dioceses of the Roman Empire was known as the Diocese of Pannonia. It had its capital in Sirmium and included all 4 provinces that were formed from historical Pannonia, as well as the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum Mediterraneum and Noricum Ripense.\n\nFollowing the Migrations Period in the middle of the 5th Century, Pannonia was ceded to the Huns by Theodosius II. After the collapse of the Hunnic Empire in AD 454, large numbers of Ostrogoths were settled by Emperor Marcian in province as foederati.\n\nThe Eastern Roman Empire controlled Pannonia for a time in the 6th Century, and a Byzantine province of Pannonia with capital in Sirmium was temporarily restored. However, it only included only a small south-eastern part of historical Pannonia.\n\nAfterwards it was again invaded by the Avars in the 560s, the Slavs and then the Franks. The Franks named a frontier march the March of Pannonia in the end of the 8th Century, and the term Pannonia was also used for a Slavic duchy that was vassal to the Franks.\n\nFurthermore, between the 5th and the 10th Century the Romanized population of Pannonia developed the Romance Pannonian Language. It was mainly focused around the Lake Balaton in present-day western Hungary, the language and related culture was extinct with the Magyar Invasion.\n\nOverall, the country was fairly productive and even more so after the great forests had been cleared by Probus and Galerius. Before that time timber had been one of its most important exports.\n\nPannonia‘s chief agricultural products were oats and barley, from which the inhabitants brewed a kind of beer named sabaea. Vines and olive trees were little cultivated.\n\nPannonia was also famous for its breed of hunting dogs. Although no mention is made of its mineral wealth by the ancients, it is probable that it contained iron and silver mines.\n\nThe native settlements consisted of pagi (cantons) containing a number of vici (villages), the majority of the large towns being of Roman origin. The cities and towns in Pannonia were:\n\nNow in Austria:\n\nCarnuntum (Petronell, Bad Deutsch-Altenburg) and Vindobona (Vienna)\n\nNow in Bosnia and Herzegovina:\n\nSaldae (Brčko) and Serbinum (Gradiška)\n\nNow in Croatia:\n\nAd Novas (Zmajevac); Andautonia (Ščitarjevo); Aqua Viva (Varaždin); Aquae Balisae (Daruvar); Certissa (Đakovo); Cibalae (Vinkovci); Cornacum (Sotin); Cuccium (Ilok); Iovia or Iovia Botivo (Ludbreg); Marsonia (Slavonski Brod); Mursa (Osijek); Siscia (Sisak) and Teutoburgium (Dalj)\n\nNow in Hungary:\n\nAd Flexum (Mosonmagyaróvár); Ad Mures (Ács); Ad Statuas (Vaspuszta and Várdomb); Alisca (Szekszárd); Alta Ripa (Tolna); Aquincum (Óbuda); Arrabona (Győr); Brigetio (Szőny); Caesariana (Baláca); Campona (Nagytétény); Cirpi (Dunabogdány); Contra-Aquincum (Pest); Contra Constantiam (Dunakeszi); Lugio (Dunaszekcsõ); Gorsium-Herculia (Tác); Intercisa (Dunaújváros); Lugio (Dunaszekcső); Lussonium (Dunakömlőd); Matrica (Százhalombatta);Morgentianae (Tüskevár); Mursella (Mórichida); Quadrata (Lébény); Sala (Zalalövő); Sabaria (Szombathely); Scarbantia (Sopron); Solva (Esztergom); Sopianae (Pécs); Ulcisia Castra (Szentendre) and Valcum (Fenékpuszta)\n\nNow in Serbia:\n\nAcumincum (Stari Slankamen); Ad Herculae (Čortanovci); Bassianae (Donji Petrovci); Bononia (Banoštor); Burgenae (Novi Banovci); Cusum (Petrovaradin); Graio (Sremska Rača); Onagrinum (Begeč); Rittium (Surduk); Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica) and Taurunum (Zemun)\n\nNow in Slovakia:\n\nGerulata (Rusovce)\n\nNow in Slovenia:\n\nCeleia (Celje); Neviodunum (Drnovo) and Poetovio (Ptuj)\n\nPannonia was important throughout history for, and because of, the Romans. The legacy of the ancient name Pannonia is retained today by the modern term Pannonian plain.\n\nWith so much area and people of various cultures settling there, Pannonia has developed quite a bit over the centuries since Rome took over. We hope you enjoyed learning about this special area in the Roman Empire and wish you will be able to actually visit at least a part of it someday.\n\nThanks for stopping by and till next time, Don’t Stop Rome-ing!\n\n- See more at: http://www.romeacrosseurope.com"
