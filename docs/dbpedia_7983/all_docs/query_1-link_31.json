        "text": "Geography\n\nThe province was located between the Danube river in the north-east and Sava river in the south. The western border of Byzantine Pannonia stretched approximately to the estuary or river Drina into Sava. Important cities in the area were Sirmium and Bassianae. Byzantine Pannonia bordered Byzantine province of Moesia Prima in the south and Avar Khaganate in the west, north and east.\n\nBackground\n\nByzantine Pannonia was named after the former Roman province of Pannonia, which included much more territory. The Byzantine province included only a small eastern part of historical Pannonia. In the 2nd century, the original Roman province was divided into two provinces: Pannonia Inferior and Pannonia Superior. Subsequently, the area was divided into four provinces: Pannonia Prima, Pannonia Valeria, Pannonia Savia and Pannonia Secunda. Capital of Pannonia Secunda was Sirmium.\n\nIn the middle of the 5th century, the territory of former Roman Pannonia was ceded to the Huns by Theodosius II, and after the death of Attila it successively passed (entirely or partially) into the hands of the Ostrogoths, Lombards and Gepids.\n\nA contract from 510 assigned most of the territory of former Roman Pannonia (including Sirmium) to the Ostrogoths, while the eastern part of present-day Syrmia (which included the city of Bassianae) was assigned to the Byzantine Empire. In 536, Sirmium was placed under the control of the Gepids. The Lombardâ€“Gepid War (567) ended with a Lombard-Avar victory and annihilation of Gepids, while Sirmium was retaken by the Byzantine Empire.\n\nUnder the Byzantine Empire\n\nFrom 567 to 573, Byzantine Empire was in a war with the Avars, who aimed to conquer Byzantine Pannonia. Temporary truce was agreed in 573, but the war was resumed. Due to the fact that Byzantine-Persian war also started in this time, the Byzantine Empire was not able to defend Pannonia. The city of Sirmium was finally conquered by the Avars in 582, thus marking end of Byzantine control of Pannonia.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe Byzantine Empire re-established control over Pannonia in the 11th century, leading to the creation of the Theme of Sirmium to administer the region."
