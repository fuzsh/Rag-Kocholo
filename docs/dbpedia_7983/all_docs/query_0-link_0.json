        "text": "Roman province (295 - 5th century)\n\nPannonia Savia or simply Savia, also known as Pannonia Ripariensis, was a Late Roman province. It was formed in the year 295, during the Tetrarchy reform of Roman emperor Diocletian, and assigned to the civil diocese of Pannonia, which was attached in the fourth century to the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum, and later to the Praetorian prefecture of Italy.\n\nDuring the 4th and 5th centuries, the province was raided several times, by migrating peoples, including Huns and Goths. In the 490s, it became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom.\n\nThe capital of the province was Siscia (today Sisak). Pannonia Savia included parts of present-day Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nPannonia\n\nRoman provinces\n\nRoman Empire"
