Floyd\n\nIn his 1972 Turing Award Lecture Dijkstra quipped: \"The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem.\"\n\nEdsger W.

At the time of his death, Wilkes was an Emeritus Professor of the University of Cambridge.\n\nMaurice Wilkes"
