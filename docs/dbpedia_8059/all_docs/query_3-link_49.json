        "text": "The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) awarded Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun with what many consider the \"Nobel Prize of computing,\" for the innovations they've made in AI.\n\nThe $1 million prize, funded by Google, is named after the British mathematician Alan Turing, who laid the theoretical foundations for computer science.\n\nThe three men who won developed Deep Learning with conceptual and engineering foundations for AI by using neural networks for computing. Bengio is a professor at the University of Montreal and the science director of both Mila (Quebec's AI Institute) and the Institute for Data Valorization. Hinton is a vice president and engineering fellow at Google, chief scientific adviser of the Vector Institute and a professor at the University of Toronto. LeCun is a vice president and chief AI scientist at Facebook and a professor at New York University. Bengio and LeCun are also co-directors of CIFAR's Learning in Machines and Brains program.\n\n“Artificial intelligence is now one of the fastest-growing areas in all of science and one of the most talked-about topics in society,” said ACM president Cherri M. Pancake in a statement. “The growth of and interest in AI is due, in no small part, to the recent advances in deep learning for which Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun laid the foundation. These technologies are used by billions of people. Anyone who has a smartphone in their pocket can tangibly experience advances in natural language processing and computer vision that were not possible just 10 years ago. In addition to the products we use every day, new advances in deep learning have given scientists powerful new tools — in areas ranging from medicine to astronomy to materials science.”\n\nTheir work over the past several years used algorithms to extract patterns in data that recognized languages, environments and objects and led to breakouts in speech recognition, robotics and machine learning of digital images and videos. These deep neural networks became advanced at image recognition.\n\nAccording to MIT, Neural nets are a means of doing machine learning, in which a computer learns to perform some task by analyzing training examples. Usually, the examples have been hand-labeled in advance. An object recognition system, for instance, might be fed thousands of labeled images of cars, houses, coffee cups, and so on, and it would find visual patterns in the images that consistently correlate with particular labels.\n\nThey used large data sets to train on graphics processing which is well suited to the parallelized computations required. Their work has transformed multiple industries including transportation, healthcare, and e-commerce. In fact, many of their findings are being used in everyday technology like smartphone facial recognition, self-driving cars and Google predictive email text.\n\nAnyone who has a smartphone in their pocket can tangibly experience advances in natural language processing and computer vision that were not possible just 10 years ago,” Pancake said. “In addition to the products we use every day, new advances in deep learning have given scientists powerful new tools — in areas ranging from medicine, to astronomy, to materials science.”\n\nACM will present the 2018 A.M. Turing Award at its annual awards banquet on June 15 in San Francisco."
