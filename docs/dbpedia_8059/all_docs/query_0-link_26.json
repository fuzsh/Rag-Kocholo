        "text": "Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali have been awarded the 2012 ACM A.M. Turing Award for their pioneering work in enabling secure Internet transactions, the Association for Computing Machinery, or ACM, said Wednesday.\n\n“By formalizing the concept that cryptographic security had to be computational rather than absolute, they created mathematical structures that turned cryptography from an art into a science,’’ ACM said in a press release.\n\nThe ACM Turing Award carries a $250,000 prize with financial support provided by Intel Corp. and Google Inc.\n\nGoldwasser is the RSA Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, and principal investigator at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab as well as a professor of computer science and applied mathematics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\nMicali is the Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT and a principal investigator at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.\n\nThe A.M. Turing Award was named for Alan M. Turing, the British mathematician who articulated the mathematical foundation and limits of computing and who was a key contributor to the Allied cryptanalysis of the German Enigma cipher and the German “Tunny’’ encoding machine in World War II. Since its inception in 1966, the Turing Award has honored the computer scientists and engineers who created the systems and underlying theoretical foundations that have propelled the information technology industry."
