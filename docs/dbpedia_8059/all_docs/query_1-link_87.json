        "text": "The ACM A. M. Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for contributions of lasting and major technical importance to computer science.[2] It is generally recognized as the highest distinction in the field of computer science and is often referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of Computing\".[3][4][5]\n\nThe award is named after Alan Turing, who was a British mathematician and reader in mathematics at the University of Manchester. Turing is often credited as being the founder of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence,[6] and a key contributor to the Allied cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher during World War II.[7]\n\nFrom 2007 to 2013, the award was accompanied by a prize of US$250,000, with financial support provided by Intel and Google.[2][8] Since 2014, the award has been accompanied by a prize of US$1 million, with financial support provided by Google.[1][9]"
