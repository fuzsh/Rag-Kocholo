These women are helping to shape the future of technology and influencing others to follow in their footsteps.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTop 10 Women in Computer Science From the Last 10 Years\n\nFei-Fei Li\n\nDaphne Koller\n\nShafrira Goldwasser\n\nDina Katabi\n\nBarbara Liskov\n\nTimnit Gebru\n\nNancy Lynch\n\nDaniela L. Rus\n\nJennifer Widom\n\nStephanie Seneff\n\nComputer scientists helped to create the smartphones in our hands, the software programs we use to power our workplaces, the medical devices needed to perform surgery, and the games we play on our computers. Computer scientists work in a diverse range of fields including AI, robotics, automation, information technology, FinTech, and much more. Computer scientists find employment in healthcare, startups, think tanks, government, finances, and more. There is demand for qualified computer science professions in every sector of the economy. This is why the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a job growth rate of 22% between now and 2030, which far exceeds the average rate of job growth for all occupations.\n\nStudents who study computer science will gain foundational knowledge in algorithms, programming languages, and operating systems. They can take courses on subjects like cybersecurity, data mining, analytics, and website construction. Postgraduate degree programs offer specialized and advanced courses, providing in-depth knowledge of theory and design of computing systems, among other subjects. Though many graduates with a bachelorâs degree go on to find successful employment, many choose to continue their education, earning a masterâs or doctorate.\n\nWhile the American Association of University Women (AAUW) reports that women in computer science are paid higher salaries than women in many other fields, they still face representation and pay gaps relative to their male counterparts. In 2019, only 19% of the bachelorâs in computer science were awarded to women, and only 28% and 20%, respectively, of masterâs and doctorates in the field went to women.\n\nAAUW is among many organizations seeking to change that. The Association for Women in Computing, AnitaB.org, and Girls Who Code all encourage women to enter the technology field. AnitaB.org is named after Dr. Anita Borg, who in 1987, started a digital community for women in computing. Part of the organizationâs mission is to connect, inspire, and guide women in computing, and organizations that view technology innovation as a strategic imperative.\n\nWhile there is a need for more female representation in computer science, our list of influential women in the field serves to inspire others to join their ranks. Our top influencer, Fei-Fei Li, is co-creator of ImageNet and the Sequoia Capital Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University. Barbara Liskov was one of the first women in the US to earn a PhD in computer science and is now a computer scientist at MIT.
