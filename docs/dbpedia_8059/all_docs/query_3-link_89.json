        "text": "Jack Dongarra, Distinguished Professor of Computer Science in the University of Tennessee, Knoxville’s Tickle College of Engineering and Distinguished Research Staff Member at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, will receive the 2021 A. M. Turing Award from the Association of Computing Machinery. Dongarra, an innovator in computational software, is being honored for his pioneering contributions which have helped pave the way for high-performance computing’s evolution over the past 40 years.\n\nThe award, often referred to as the Nobel Prize of computing, is named for Alan M. Turing, the British mathematician who described the mathematical foundation and limits of computing. Along with the recognition, the award carries a $1 million prize, with financial support provided by Google Inc."
