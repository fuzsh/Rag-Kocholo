Nick, Joe and Kevin Jonas reprised their characters -- wigs and all -- from their 2008 Disney Channel movie "Camp Rock."

They reenacted a scene from the film in which the brothers attempt to convince Joe Jonas' character, Shane Grey, to return to camp.

"30 Rock" actor Jack McBrayer even makes an appearance in the TikTok.

Fans of the teen movie naturally loved the throwback. Since its posting on Tuesday on the band's account, the video has already received almost 3 million views.

Nick Jonas also recently shared a funny TikTok with Shay Mooney from country duo Dan + Shay.

It's a good time to be a JoBros fan.
