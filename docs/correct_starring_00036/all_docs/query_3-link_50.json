        "text": "The daughter of two doctors, Priyanka Chopra spent much of her youth living in various cities, both in India and abroad. Starting out as a model, she won numerous Indian beauty pageants and was soon courted by filmmakers in her homeland. In 2003, Chopra appeared in the popular action movie \"The Hero: Love Story of a Spy\" and the blockbuster romance \"Andaaz,\" with the two hits propelling her to screen stardom. After winning praise for her villainous turn in the drama \"Aitraaz\" (2004), she went on to have a notably successful 2006, with the release of two major productions, the superhero movie \"Krrish\" and the action film \"Don,\" both of which led to eventual sequels. Other subsequent hits included the female-driven drama \"Fashion\" (2008) and the dark comedy \"7 Khoon Maaf\" (2011). Following a notably unglamorous featured performance in the lauded comedy \"Barfi!\" (2012), Chopra had her first role in a Hollywood production, voicing a character in the Disney animated movie \"Planes\" (2013), which positioned her to take off into new career heights on the international level. Born in Jamshedpur but raised in various locations, Chopra had a globetrotting childhood, thanks to her parents' positions as physicians in the Indian military. Her family's itinerant life led her to become outgoing and interested in many cultures, and, while living abroad in Massachusetts as a teen, she began acting on stage and singing. Upon returning to India in her late teens, the strikingly attractive Chopra started entering national beauty competitions, and, by the turn of the 21st century, she had numerous major pageant titles under her belt. By 2002, Bollywood came calling, leading to her first film role in the Tamil romance \"Thamizhan,\" starring Vijay. Though not a huge hit, the movie revealed Chopra's screen-star potential, and she began gaining momentum in Bollywood with her next two projects, the action film \"The Hero: Love Story of a Spy\" and the romantic drama \"Andaaz,\" which both met with considerable success. Rather than simply coast on predictable love-interest parts, Chopra opted for a sinister turn in the thriller \"Aitraaz,\" co-starring Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor, which led to numerous accolades and awards for her performance. While some of her movies missed the mark, both commercially and critically, Chopra continued to have a diverse film career. She had a banner year in 2006 with the box-office hits \"Krrish,\" a fantastical adventure movie, and the crime tale \"Don.\" After a number of bombs, she bounced back in 2008 with the lavish drama \"Fashion,\" co-starring Kangna Ranaut, In 2009, Chopra was featured in the hit thriller \"Kaminey,\" and she subsequently starred in the comedy \"What's Your Raashee?,\" playing a remarkable 12 different characters. Soon thereafter, Chopra was reputedly lined up to make up her Hollywood debut as Phaedra in the mythological action film \"Immortals\" (2011), but the role eventually went to Freida Pinto. After appearing in the hit sequel \"Don 2\" (2011) and playing the more down-to-earth part in the acclaimed romance \"Barfi!\" (2012), Chopra made her debut as an international pop singer with the 2012 single \"In My City,\" a collaboration with will.i.am. Apparently just getting warmed up, she was finally featured in an American movie with the role of Ishani in the Disney animated film \"Planes\" (2013), which found her in an ensemble of primarily American actors, including Dane Cook and Teri Hatcher. Around the same time she unveiled her song \"Exotic\" with Pitbull and prepared for the premiere of the highly anticipated superhero sequel \"Krrish 3\" (2013). Following starring roles in \"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\" (2013), \"Gunday\" (2014), \"Mary Kom\" (2014), \"Dil Dhadakne Do\" (2015) and \"Bajirao Mastani\" (2015), Chopra made her true international breakthrough as the star of he American crime procedural drama \"Quantico\" (ABC 2015-18). After starring in the sequel to her previous crime hit, \"Jai Gangaajal\" (2016), Chopra co-starred in the comedy reboot \"Baywatch\" (2017) and family drama \"A Kid Like Jake\" (2018). She also became an international tabloid fixtue after her engagement to pop star Nick Jonas was announced in July 2018."
