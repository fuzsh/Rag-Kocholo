        "text": "Nick Jonas makes a hilarious cameo appearance in a new romantic comedy starring his wife Priyanka Chopra, sending Jonas Brothers fans into a spin.\n\nIn Love Again, Chopra stars as Mira, a woman struggling with grief who sends a series of romantic texts to the old mobile phone number of her dead fiancé, not realising the number has been transferred to another person.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: See Nick Jonas in the trailer for Love Again\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nThat person is Rob, a journalist (Outlander star Sam Heughan) in the middle of writing a profile piece on singer Celine Dion - who plays herself in her first-ever film role.\n\nDion is the queen of the romantic ballad, so Rob enlists her help in trying to track Mira down in person as he falls in love with her via text.\n\nMeanwhile, Mira is trying to date again after her tragic loss, without much success.\n\nIn one scene shown in the film’s trailer, Mira is in the back of a car with a potential boyfriend - who just happens to be Chopra’s real-life hubby, Nick Jonas.\n\nAs things start to get hot and heavy, Mira tells her eager paramour that he needs to slow down - which he does, quite literally.\n\nThe surprise cameo had fans delighted.\n\n“Priyanka asking Nick to go slow, that’s the best part of the trailer. Loved it,” one fan wrote.\n\n“That was hilarious!” agreed another.\n\n“Nick and Priyanka acting together,” wrote another, adding a loveheart emoji.\n\n“(Priyanka) as an actress is one of the best, loved Sam and Celine as well, but the most surprising thing was Nick’s cameo!” added a third.\n\nChopra and Jonas married in December 2018, welcoming their first child early last year via surrogate.\n\nWhile many were excited to see Jonas’s cameo, others were ecstatic that the film saw Celine Dion in her first acting role, with the soundtrack featuring some of her new music.\n\n“Everything here looks on-point, from the casting to the music to the inclusion of Queen Celine, who is LONG overdue for a movie role,” one fan wrote.\n\n“I’m so excited to watch Priyanka Chopra and Sam on screen together, and it looks like a funny and heartwarming movie, and new music from Celine and that cameo from Nick?!? SOLD,” wrote another.\n\n“So beautiful to see Celine featured in this new film! She’s an icon and deserves so much love, especially with all she’s faced over the past few years with the loss of her beloved husband and her own health issues,” another fan enthused.\n\n“We get new Celine music too!”\n\nDion recently revealed that she was suffering from Stiff Person Syndrome, a neurological disorder which caused muscle spasms and also made it difficult for her to sing.\n\n“Unfortunately, these spasms affect every aspect of my daily life, sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I’m used to,” she said in a video posted to Instagram.\n\n“I’m working hard with my sports medicine therapist every day to build back my strength and my ability to perform again, but I have to admit it’s been a struggle.”\n\nThe Canadian singer lost her husband René Angélil in 2016.\n\nOther viewers of the Love Again trailer were excited by the prospect of a good old-fashioned 90s-style rom com.\n\n“The trailer is so good that it brings back the vibes of early romance movies of the 1990’s,” one person wrote.\n\n“Yesss! I miss romantic comedies and they’re bringing them back,” said another.\n\n“Can’t wait.”\n\nFor more engaging entertainment content, visit 7Life on Facebook.\n\nYour cookie settings are preventing this third party content from displaying.\n\nIf you’d like to view this content, please adjust your .\n\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide."
