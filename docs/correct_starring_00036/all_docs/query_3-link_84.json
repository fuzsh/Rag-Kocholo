        "text": "The squealing should continue at Broadway’s Al Hirschfeld Theatre for the foreseeable future. Next year, Nick Jonas will take over the lead role in the hit musical revival How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. He’ll be filling the dancing shoes of Daniel Radcliffe, who’s playing ambitious corporate-ladder climber J. Pierrepont Finch through the end of the year after winning mostly rave reviews (and the attention of legions of teenage fans) when the show opened last March. Glee star Darren Criss, a teen heartthrob in his own right, will portray Finch from Jan. 3-22, 2012, and then the youngest of the Jonas Brothers trio is expected to step in."
