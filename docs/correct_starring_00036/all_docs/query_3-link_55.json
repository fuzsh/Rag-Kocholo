        "text": "Get ready, people, because Nick Jonas is retuning to the big screen. That’s right, the Jonas Brothers member is set to star in the brand new, action-packed film The Blacksmith, and we can’t wait!\n\nAccording to Deadline, the singer will play the role of Wes Loomis, who is “a ‘Blacksmith’ — the intelligence community’s go-to weapons expert. When his clandestine lab is destroyed and his colleagues murdered, he must go on the run with only his unique set of technological skills and the help of a brilliant, young CIA analyst Noelle Hazlitt to keep him alive. They seek out Mather, a retired blacksmith and Wes’ mentor, to help guide them.”\n\nAlong with Nick, film industry legend Laurence Fishburne will also star in the film, and production is set to start later this year. The female lead, who will play Noelle, has yet to be announced, but executive producer Stuart Ford has plans to share the casting news soon.\n\n“The Blacksmith provides a fresh, highly contemporary new take on the espionage genre and it’s exciting to pair an exhilarating young talent like Nick with seasoned heavyweights,” Stuart also told he publication. “We’ll soon be announcing an equally outstanding young female actor to play across from Nick and then we will have all the ingredients for a major new film franchise built around a very modern breed of action hero.”\n\nYep, not only will The Blacksmith be one movie, but is set to spawn an entire franchise starring the Disney Channel alum.\n\nAs fans know, this isn’t Nick’s first major movie role. Previously, the 27-year-old starred in both Jumanji reboot films along with some TV appearances as well. For those who forgot, for three years he played the role of Nate in the series Kingdom and also acted in the fan-favorite show Scream Queens. With some pretty epic acting credits already under his belt, there’s no doubt that Nick will totally slay this film."
