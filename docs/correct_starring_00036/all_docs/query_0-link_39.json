        "text": "It's been a little over 10 years since the Disney Channel Original Movie, Camp Rock, premiered starring superstars The Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato. The huge success of the first one allowed the crew to do Camp Rock 2: Final Jam, but never a third one.\n\nThat is until Joe Jonas teased the idea of wanting to do a new film! Only this time it would be R-Rated!\n\n\"If it made sense, sure. For all of us, (including) Demi and Nick, it would be funny to do a spin on it. Do the graduating days, make it kind dark. An adult film. Well, not an adult film. An R-Rated film. We've joked around about the idea a couple times.\" -Joe Jonas\n\nThe timing would be perfect to do a new film as the group of band brothers recently announced their getting back together. However, good luck convincing Disney Channel to release the rights to the film or back a more provocative film.We can still dream though!\n\nJoe Jonas was 18 when Camp Rock premiered and although he definitely had the ladies swooning then, he was not nearly as fit as he is now. Let's just say if an R-Rated Camp Rock was in the works, he would definitely be ready for it!"
