        "text": "Nick Jonas, the freshly Golden Globes-nominated actor/singer recently sat down with BUILD Series to promote his role in the highly-anticipated new movie \"Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle.\"\n\nThis newer iteration of \"Jumanji,\" isn't considered a remake or a reboot of the 1995 classic. Instead it will be a re-imagination where viewers will see nods to the original plus some brand new elements as well. The classic film took place within a board game and this time around, it will be inside a video game! Nonetheless, the danger level still remains high. Jonas plays Alex, alongside cast mates Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Kevin Hart, all of which are playing the video game versions of their real world teen counterparts.\n\nJonas discussed about how he got the role plus shared some of his favorite moments during production.\n\nHe was first pitched the idea to be in the new \"Jumanji\" movie when he received a phone call from his agent last year while he was still in the midst of his Future Now Tour with Demi Lovato.\n\n\"I was such a massive fan of the original. I was just really curious to see what the angle was going to be for this film. I read the script and fell in love with the story [and] with the characters. The use of the body swap is so brilliant and it is also a thing where you watch four actors you've seen in really incredible roles, but you've never seen them play teenagers like this,\" Jonas explained.\n\nAfter he completed his audition tape, Jonas eagerly and nervously waited until eventually he got another phone call from his agent congratulating him. This call couldn't have come at a more appropriate time for the actor.\n\n\"On TV [in the background] that day was \"Jumanji,\" the original and literally as I'm like talking to my agent [and] my manager...they said 'You've got the role!' and I'm like watching the movie, it was a crazy moment but that's kind of how I think the universe works. It's sort of meant to be,\" Jonas revealed.\n\nWhen you go and see the film in theaters soon, you'll notice Jonas as the adventurous Alex being the \"emotional anchor for the film.\" He's \"most connected to Robin Williams' character Alan Parrish and the journey he went on.\"\n\nJonas felt a connection to his character and he hoped that viewers will feel the same. He told the audience that \"the reaction to this film around the world has been incredible. People seem to really love it!\"\n\n\"I'm really proud to be a part of something like this.\"\n\nNow when it comes to the actual production, Nick and his co-stars had a blast filming their respective scenes on set in Hawaii.\n\n\"I would say my favorite part of shooting the movie was with Jack Black. He's just incredible. We had a lot of really great scenes together.\"\n\nJonas and Black carried that camaraderie off-camera as well. \"We were in Oahu and we would take food adventures on the weekends.\"\n\nTheir friendship led them to create an unofficial theme song for the movie called \"Jumanji, Jumanji.\"\n\n\"Jack sings all the time. He's kind of exactly as you'd hope he would be in that way. We were on set and we would start singing that song. We would start writing it basically and then I made a track with a friend of mine and we will be releasing it. It's a joke, it's terrible! But it's also amazing at the same time. It's sort of like me and Jack doing the \"Jumanji\" version of like \"Phantom of the Opera,\" Jonas teased.\n\nSo be on the lookout for that as the two will be releasing this catchy track plus a music video too!"
