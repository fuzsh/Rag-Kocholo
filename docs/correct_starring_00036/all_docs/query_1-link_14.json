        "text": "Camp Rock 3 is seeming more and more likely. Nick Jonas is the latest star of the 2008 Disney Channel Original Movie that launched Demi Lovato's career and brought our beloved Jonas Brothers to the small screen to float the idea of a third installment of the summertime musical.\n\n\"If the right thing comes together, I think that’d be fun,\" Nick told People in a recent interview. \"It’s a really delicate thing because [they’re two films] really beloved by fans. So I think for it to work, it’d have to be some creative new version where we get a writing team and do something special. But I absolutely love working with Demi and my brothers.\"\n\nBack in March, Nick's big bro Joe Jonas, now the front man of the band DNCE, also revealed that he'd be interested in going back to camp —but with a twist. The singer suggested a less happy-go-lucky, more dark-and-brooding take on the Disney classic, a stark contrast to the first film and its sequel, 2010's Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam.\n\n\"If it made sense, sure. For all of us — Demi, Nick— it would be funny to do a spin on it,\" Joe told Marie Claire. \"Do the graduating days, make it kind of dark. An adult film. Well, not an adult film. An R-rated film. We've joked around about the idea a couple times.\"\n\nAnd Demi echoed Joe's revelation on The Ellen Degeneres Show a month later.\n\n\"We want to come out with an R-Rated Camp Rock 3,\" the singer said. \"I mean all of our fans have now grown up, and so anybody that watched Camp Rock is now older and can appreciate it.\"\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time this musical trifecta has reunited. Over the years, the stars have kept in touch, with Demi and Nick touring (and appearing on Carpool Karaoke) together and exes Demi and Joe reuniting for a sweet, yet rare, performance.\n\nBut, of course, a Camp Rock 3 is the ultimate dream. So that's three stars down, one to go. Kevin Jonas, come through.\n\nRelated: Like Me, Nick Jonas Still Listens to Miley Cyrus's Music"
