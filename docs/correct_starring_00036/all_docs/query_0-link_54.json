        "text": "Getty\n\nOnly “Extra” was with Nick Jonas this weekend as he dished about the Met Gala and the possibility of a “Camp Rock” sequel.\n\nWhen asked about the gala, Nick made no mention of his rumored date Priyanka Chopra, instead saying he attended with friends. “I went with Ralph Lauren, one of my favorite brands. I got the chance to hang with some great friends.”\n\nTalking about “Camp Rock,” Nick joked, “Obviously, I hate working with Demi and Joe and Kevin, so it's going to be really tough.” He added, “There's a lot of talk about this. The first two were beloved by the fans, who are now kind of millennial adults. If there's a version of this movie that's a little raunchier, it still has to be a great story. Just doing it for the gag is not worth it. It's got to be a good film and something we can all be proud of.”\n\nThe actor and singer is proud of the new music he's been working on, revealing, “I'm in the process of writing new music. It's the most true to who I am… I had a real aha moment when it came to the creative process. It feels like it's my strongest stuff yet.”\n\nJonas is collaborating with audio brand Altec Lansing, and stopped by Bloomingdale's in NYC to sign headphones and speakers for fans. \"They gave me a lot of freedom to design this thing, to really feel like me, and it sounds amazing as well, which is obviously the most important part.\""
