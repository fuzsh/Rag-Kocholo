        "text": "BURBANK, Calif., Aug. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- STXfilms, a division of Robert Simonds' global, next-generation media company STX Entertainment, announced today that GRAMMY and Golden Globe nominated singer and actor Nick Jonas has signed on to voice act and perform an original song in its upcoming animated film UglyDolls alongside previously announced co-stars Kelly Clarkson and Pitbull. Jonas most recently appeared in the blockbuster smash-hit Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle with Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, and in 2016 he co-starred alongside James Franco in the Sundance Film Festival drama Goat.\n\n\"Nick Jonas is not only a talented musician, he's also an accomplished actor beloved by millions of passionate fans around the world,\" said Adam Fogelson, Chairman of STXfilms. \"Over the last several years, Nick has proven there's not much he can't do, and we're ecstatic to have him join Kelly and Pitbull in this charming and funny film.\"\n\nUnconventionality rules in UGLYDOLLS, the new animated family adventure based on the beloved toy brand. In the adorably different town of Uglyville, the free-spirited Moxy and her UglyDolls friends confront what it means to be different, struggle with their desire to be loved, and ultimately discover that you don't have to be perfect to be amazing because who you truly are is what matters most.\n\n\"The UglyDolls remind audiences the importance of acceptance and loving yourself, and as someone who started in this business very young, I understand the significance of using my platform to tell stories that lift others up,\" said Jonas. \"I love that I get to work with Kelly Clarkson and Pitbull, and I can't wait to get started.\"\n\nCreated as a plush toy line by David Horvath and Sun-Min Kim, the UglyDoll brand quickly gained a cult following around the world and was named Toy of the Year by the Toy Industry Association in 2006. Beloved by children, teenagers and adults alike, UglyDoll characters are distinct for their endearing \"ugliness,\" in a wonderful \"uglyverse\" where differences are celebrated and embraced.\n\nSTXfilms will release UGLYDOLLS in theaters in 2019 as launch vehicle for STX Entertainment's UglyDolls franchise. An animated kids series is also underway with a full series order from premium streaming service Hulu, and Hasbro joined early on as global master toy licensee. The original motion picture soundtrack will be released by Atlantic Records.\n\nJonas is represented by WME and Phil McIntyre.\n\nAbout STXfilms\n\nSTXfilms is a division of STX Entertainment, a global, next-generation media company whose mission is to unlock the value of the direct connection stars have with their fans through the development, financing, production, marketing and distribution of film, television, VR, digital video, music and live entertainment content.
