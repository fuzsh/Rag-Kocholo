        "text": "Nick Jonas and Paul Rudd are set to star in “Power Ballad” a musical comedy from John Carney, who directed “Once” and “Sing Street.” They are currently filming in Dublin.\n\n“Power Ballad” was written by Carney and Peter McDonald. The official logline for the film reads, “An uplifting music-driven story about a wedding singer, a rock star and the song that comes between them.”\n\nJonas and Rudd are both known for their work on-screen with Jonas’ credits including “Camp Rock,” Scream Queens” and “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” and a TV performance of “Jersey Boys Live!” Rudd is known for “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,” “Only Murders In The Building,” “Knocked Up” and Marvel’s Ant-Man films.\n\nHowever, both of them have stacked Broadway credits, too. Jonas started acting on Broadway at seven years old. He’s been in “Les Misérables,” “Beauty and the Beast,” “Hairspray,” “Annie Get Your Gun” and “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” where Jonas replaced Daniel Radcliffe after his run in 2011. He also co-produced the play “Chicken and Biscuits.” Rudd made his Broadway debut in the Tony Award-winning “The Last Night of Ballyhoo” in 1997. Since then, he’s been in “Twelfth Night,” “Three Days of Rain,” “Grace,” and off-Broadway productions “The Shape of Things” and “Reasons to be Pretty Happy.”\n\n“I’m delighted to be working with so many great people,” said Carney. “I’ve been working on this script with my buddy Peter for years, and now Paul Rudd and Nick Jonas are in my kitchen.”\n\n30WEST, WME Independent, and UTA Independent Film Group are preparing for sale at the Cannes Film Festival later this month.\n\n“We are so excited to bring John Carney’s next film to Cannes. John has a magic ability to weave great music into wonderfully engaging and universally relatable stories that make audience emotions run high,” said Alex Walton of WME. “‘Power Ballad’ is fun and heartwarming—themes that audiences crave today. His unique vision, coupled with the global appeal of Paul Rudd and Nick Jonas, will give buyers exactly what they’re looking for.”\n\n30WEST will finance and produce the film, along with Screen Ireland."
