        "text": "The Jonas Brothers snap a pic together on the set of Camp Rock 2 The Final Jam as they celebrate Nick’s 17th birthday on Wednesday, September 16.\n\nNick dished to People mag about what his family got him for his special day. He shared, “”It’s actually the piano I wrote ‘A Little Bit Longer’ on. It’s definitely got a special meaning for me. I originally wanted to get a plaque just to put on the piano when I got there saying that I wrote the song on, but the family just decided to get it for me.”"
