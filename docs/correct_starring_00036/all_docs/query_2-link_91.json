        "text": "Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam is the sequel to the 2008 Disney Channel original movie Camp Rock. Directed by Paul Hoen, this 2010 film follows Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) as she returns to the music-oriented summer camp “Camp Rock” in order to immerse herself in the joy of music making and to rekindle her romantic relations with Shane Gray (Joe Jonas) from the summer before. These plans, however, are interrupted when Camp Rock discovers that a new camp, Camp Star, has opened across the lake and plans to steal away Camp Rock’s campers and staff. As a result, the two camps face off to determine which one has more talent and deserves to remain open.\n\nCamp Rock 2 struggles narratively as it completely disregards the character development made in its predecessor, specifically with the character Tess. At the end Camp Rock, Tess learns to respect her fellow campers and to share the spotlight with other talented people; however, in the sequel, Tess joins Camp Star, becoming the villain once more, and strives to be the star of the show again. The narrative also falls short in its attempt at a Romeo and Juliet-esque side plot between Nate Gray (Nick Jonas) and Dana Turner (Chloe Bridges). The two spend most of the movie pining over each other, but there is almost no payoff and progress in their relationship by the end of the film. And even though the writers try to frame this as forbidden love, Dana’s father does little to prevent the two from seeing each other. Although he does discourage Dana from associating with Nate due to his enrollment in the rival camp, he barely shows any disapproval when he actually sees the two together. This bad writing, coupled with the mediocre acting of most of the cast, leaves something to be desired. In addition, lazy editing allowed for minor, but still noticeable, continuity errors.\n\nIn the grand scheme of Disney Channel original movies, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam is subpar at best. Not only is the narrative flawed, but the plot is void of any substantial take-away morals that most Disney movies have. Throughout the film, Mitchie overworks her fellow campers in preparation for the competition, making them rehearse nonstop and suppressing any joy that the campers used to have in making music. Mitchie’s only goal is to win, which causes her to push away her close friends and Shane and to break promises that she had previously made. Although this sort of behavior should be looked down upon, the campers submit to and even commend Mitchie’s overbearing attitude. As a result, Mitchie essentially gets away with her nagging and disrespect. This is not a good message to send to an audience, especially the young children that Camp Rock 2 is aimed towards.\n\nCamp Rock 2 fails to be a satisfying sequel to its predecessor not only due to its lackluster storyline, but also because of the music. The musical numbers in the sequel fall short of the hit songs of the original movie. The music in Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam is perhaps the biggest contributor to the movie’s downfall. For a musical about a music-based summer camp, Camp Rock 2 fails to present any memorable songs. Most of the songs follow the general pop formula, making them predictable and boring.\n\nThe songs are also tarnished by the terrible job that the post-production crew did in balancing the volumes of the music, vocals, and background foley sounds. Given their success after their careers in Disney, it is clear that Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas are talented vocalists. However, their singing in Camp Rock 2 is sadly drowned out by the music, making it hard to hear. This error in sound-mixing is made even worse by the strangely loud background noises. In one number, the jarring roar of the pyrotechnics that the campers use in their performance far overpowers the music and the singing. This ear-rupturing explosion of sound repeats several times throughout the duration of the song, but the sheer shrillness of it is enough to make the audience jump in surprise every time. The same sound balancing issue appears in a later music number, where the sound of the campers banging on tables vastly overpowers the music and singing. The lack of good sound mixing sullies the entire musical experience, making it less immersive and almost painful to listen to."
