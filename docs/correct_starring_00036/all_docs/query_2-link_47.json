        "text": "In this week’s blog: Digit and I ate at some delis, lost some sleep, said farewell to New York, and pushed on to beautiful Connecticut!\n\nDay 109: Graymoor Spiritual Center to Canopus Lake\n\nI felt so happy to be hiking with a friend again, and in (relatively) cool temperatures! Digit and I had decided to hike only to Canopus Lake today. If it was a nice afternoon, maybe we’d jump in for a swim.\n\nWell, we got to the lake and it was windy, sprinkling on and off. We walked up to the cafe area where we could take cover if the sprinkling turned to heavy rain, charge our portable batteries, take cold showers, and cook dinner.\n\nThe afternoon’s wind and rain gave way to a beautiful evening, and cowboy camping on the beach started sounding like a really good idea. I’m not sure how, but the mosquitoes and sand fleas didn’t bother me. Digit threw on his bug net for good measure.\n\nOld Man and Cal came down to the beach to join us, and we watched the stars together before drifting off to sleep. Around midnight, I woke up to the Big Dipper shining brightly right over our heads and felt peace.\n\nDay 110: Canopus Lake to Morgan Stewart Shelter\n\nThis morning felt flowy and fast — the slightly more rock “scrambly” sections were fun too. I think of them as practice for the Whites in New Hampshire.\n\nOn the way to a road crossing, I passed a local couple carrying protein bars for thru-hikers. Kindness such as this always means so much to me, and it was lovely to talk with them about the AT in New York.\n\nWe decided to make a stop at Corrados Deli for some pizza and gelato. Digit stayed on the AT then road-walked to the deli, but I got off one road crossing before him so I could walk the roads by open farmland and say hello to some donkeys and cows before eating my pizza. Deli blazing, baby!\n\nAs a former resident of NYC who once ate a bunch of pizza as research for a short documentary I produced, I can say that Corrados pizza was delicious. If you’re hiking the AT and haven’t made it to the area yet, put this stop on your list.\n\nIn the afternoon, Digit and I hiked up a gentle incline to the shelter. These 14–16 mile days of late have been really sweet. I feel like I have the energy to hike farther, but in a way, it’s been empowering to decide to stop earlier. Plus, I’m more relaxed and feel present for all the little treasures that the trail shares with me along the way.\n\nThere’s a good chance that Digit and I will have a place to stay and shower tomorrow in Pawling — fingers crossed!\n\nDay 111: Morgan Stewart Shelter to Pawling, NY\n\nI hiked about 8.5 miles today into Pawling for a half day/nero.\n\nDigit’s friend’s brother drove us to their house to shower, then dropped us back to town so we could resupply and go to a coffeeshop. There was a bad storm coming, so we were a little bummed that it didn’t work out for us to stay there, but it’s okay! We’re flexible and have camped through many a thunderstorm by this point.\n\nWe’d learned that there was a park in town that’s open for thru-hikers to camp in at night, so once we were finished in town, we headed that way.\n\nI passed a mailbox and remembered I needed to get a postcard from New York! I’ve been getting one in every state I hike through to mail home. I went to the local gift shop and they dug out some postcards from the 90s for me — they only cost 11¢ each. Postcards in hand, I sat on a bench by the mailbox and wrote my letters out, affixing my hummingbird stamps on each one before dropping them in the mail. A happy chore. A happy routine.\n\nIn the park, Digit and I ordered some KFC and I drank a little merlot that his friend’s dad had given me before settling in for the night.\n\nThe storm arrived with a vengeance. It started with intense wind gusts that pushed my tent pole to the limit. Then thunder and lightning came. The lightning was incessant for a few minutes and the thunder cracked right overhead before the torrential rain began. Though we were camped on the edge of a grassy field near some trees, I still felt exposed.\n\nEventually, the storm passed and we started to hear music. It went from literal Tibetan Buddhist monk music to an action movie soundtrack to hits from The Sound of Music. And then a woman started yelling.\n\nYep.\n\nIt seemed like she was having a mental health crisis of some kind. Though we couldn’t see her, it sounded like she was playing music and yelling from the street just on the other side of a grove of trees by the park. At first, it was mildly concerning. But then she started referring to “the hikers in the tents,” and that’s when we were on high alert.\n\nNeedless to say, it was a sleepless night. I found myself feeling irritated, thinking of the friends who offered us a place to stay then changed their minds for unknown reasons.\n\nBut then that annoyance at others melted into annoyance at myself. Those kind people let me shower in their home then sent me to camp with bottles of wine, olive oil, and vinegar. They probably don’t know the sheer desperation I sometimes feel when it’s been a long time between showers or a good night’s sleep on a mattress — they couldn’t have foreseen what their change in plans meant for us. Neither could we! And most importantly, I get to decide how I react to a situation. So, I decided, “Oh well.”\n\nI took a deep breath, listened as the woman’s yelling became one with crickets and barred owls and wind in the trees, and mentally sent her love and peace. Sunrise was in three hours. Maybe I could get some sleep.\n\nDay 112: Edward R. Murrow Park in Pawling, NY to Ten Mile River campsite\n\nWe split a shuttle back to trail with Marathon and two other section hikers. After passing the old oak tree at the trailhead, we only had about 2.5 miles to hike to Tony’s Deli for breakfast.\n\nBack on trail, I was hiking along — nothing too special today — when I looked up from my feet and saw I was following a bear!\n\nHe turned around and looked behind at me as I stood still. There was this moment of stillness, of utter awe at the truly massive being before me, then my heart started racing.\n\nThe bear slowly turned his head back forward and sauntered off the trail to the left. In slow motion, I took a few steps backward and clicked my poles a few times. I said a couple (probably) unnecessary “hey bears” when Marathon came up behind me. I told him about the bear, and we walked through the area together. No sign of him.\n\nAbout thirty minutes later, Marathon, Digit, and I sat down for lunch outside a nearby shelter and were joined by Beatbox, Beatnik, and Lizard of Oz. I haven’t enjoyed a communal lunch with a group of hikers like this since Georgia. I think it’s because more and more flip floppers are starting their hikes this time of year. It was pleasant as heck sharing a picnic table in the middle of the New York woods with everyone though!\n\nFinally, we made it to Connecticut. I was overwhelmed with happiness. See ya, New York. I’m ready for New England.\n\nWe set up camp at the gorgeous sites of the Ten Mile Shelter area, enjoying the babbles of the Housatonic River nearby.\n\nI kept my rain fly off tonight and watched the fireflies dance around my tent into the night, mimicking the stars above (to take inspiration from a memory my Uncle Ron shared with me about his time on the AT — if you’re reading this, hi!!).\n\nDay 113: Ten Mile River Shelter to Stony Brook Campsite\n\nWe were stoked to hike into Kent, CT today. Kent’s welcome center has a pay shower in the back and we planned to chow down on some town nosh before hitting the trail again.\n\nSadly, the welcome center’s shower was out of order, so we’d just have to continue taking river baths for now. Bummer. On the upside, though, The Villager served a great lunch and I got a milkshake!\n\nAfter lunch, Digit charged some of his devices at a nearby coffeeshop while I did a small resupply at the local IGA (mostly snacks) and hunted down my Connecticut postcards.\n\nEventually, we convinced ourselves to leave town for about seven more miles of hiking. The steep hill out of Kent was extra challenging with a full belly, but we did it and made our way to the streamside Stony Brook Campsite."
