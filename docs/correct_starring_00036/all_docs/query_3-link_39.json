        "text": "Posted: 3rd May 2024\n\nFilming is underway in Dublin on new musical comedy Power Ballad from director John Carney, proudly supported by Fís Éireann/Screen Ireland.\n\nWritten by John Carney and Peter McDonald, the film will chart the story of a wedding singer (Paul Rudd), a rock star (Nick Jonas), and the song that comes between them. Anthony Bregman and Peter Cron will produce for Likely Story, with Robert Walpole and Rebecca O’Flanagan for Treasure Entertainment, and Carney, all of whom produced Carney’s most recent film, Flora and Son. 30WEST and Fís Éireann/Screen Ireland will finance and produce the film.\n\nThe film will be selling on the market at the Cannes Film Festival later this month. 30WEST, WME Independent, and UTA Independent Film Group will represent the domestic sales on the film, with WME Independent handling international rights.\n\nJohn Carney said:\n\nI’m delighted to be working with so many great people. I’ve been working on this script with my buddy Peter for years, and now Paul Rudd and Nick Jonas are in my kitchen.”\n\nAlex Walton of WME said:\n\nWe are so excited to bring John Carney’s next film to Cannes. John has a magic ability to weave great music into wonderfully engaging and universally relatable stories that make audience emotions run high. Power Ballad is fun and heartwarming – themes that audiences crave today. His unique vision, coupled with the global appeal of Paul Rudd and Nick Jonas, will give buyers exactly what they’re looking for.”\n\nIrish filmmaker Johh Carney specializes in musical drama and comedy films such as Oscar winner Once, Oscar nominee Begin Again with Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo, and most recently Flora And Son with Eve Hewson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt."
