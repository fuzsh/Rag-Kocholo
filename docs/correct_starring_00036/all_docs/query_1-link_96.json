        "text": "I can not imagine what it would be like for an actor to audition for a movie called “Coin Flip” only to find out, after getting the part, that the dime tossing title was intentionally misleading and they’d just snagged a role in “Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam.”\n\nOh, and that said role was involved playing Nick Jonas’ love interest.\n\nWhich is exactly what happened to Chloe Bridges, who saw all her hours practicing quarter catches go out the window when she snagged the part of Dana in the Disney sequel. But secret titles were just the tip of the iceberg when it came to on-set secrecy, according to Chloe. The actress also reveals that The Jonas Brothers personal security rivals president Obama’s, what it was like being the newbie on set and how she almost wasn’t.\n\nPopWrap: How familiar were you with the “Camp Rock” phenomenon coming in?\n\nChloe Bridges: Not very. I had seen the movie, but it was a couple of years ago. The funny thing is I actually auditioned for “Camp Rock,” I tested against Demi [Lovato] for the role of Mitchie – it came down to her and me. But I was unaware of the phenomenon it’s become. And so I was kind of unprepared for that with this one.\n\nPW: Since you were a finalist the first time around, did they just come to you with the role of Dana?\n\nChloe: I just auditioned like regular – whether they remembered me from the first time or if it had anything to do with my getting the part, I don’t know. Actually I should ask, I’m curious. What’s weird is that I didn’t know I was auditioning for “Camp Rock 2” – it had a code name because Disney keeps it under lock and key. So I had no idea what I was actually auditioning for.\n\nPW: What was it called?\n\nChloe: It was called Coin Flip – and they wouldn’t send us the scripts, so I thought, “ok, I’m auditioning for some movie about flipping coins?!? Can’t wait to see how good this one is [laughs].\n\nPW: So when you found out it was actually “Camp Rock 2,” what was your reaction?\n\nChloe: “Whaaat?” [laughs] You mean we won’t be flipping coins the whole movie?” I was really excited but genuinely shocked. I had no idea.\n\nPW: As the newbie, was it awkward coming in?\n\nChloe: It was very welcoming. If anyone was awkward, it was me. I was intimidated, but they were so great — there was a cast dinner and as soon as I got off the plane, we all started hanging out. The brothers were particularly good about making an effort to get us all together, outside of working. Go-karting, mini-golfing, movies, bowling – all kinds of things.\n\nPW: Which brother is the best mini-golfer?\n\nChloe: I don’t know, we never really took any of it seriously .. except for Nick, I think he was secretly keeping score. He was definitely the most into it, the most competitive. I don’t know who was the best, but he went for the gold.\n\nPW: So what can you tell us about your character Dana? Her father runs the rival camp, so is she a spy?\n\nChloe: I wouldn’t say she’s a spy – we refer to my character as Switzerland. She’s the one who is not really pledging allegiance to either camp because she has issues with her dad. She’s kind of rebelling because she doesn’t like that he’s trying to destroy Camp Rock. She kind of stays out of the plot, which is why I don’t sing in the movie or take part in any of the big musical numbers.\n\nPW: So very Romeo & Juliet with yours and Nick’s characters.\n\nChloe: Absolutely. Her father is not ok that she likes Camp Rock or a boy from Camp Rock. So when they see each other, it’s a very Romeo & Juliet forbidden love kind of thing.\n\nPW: You say Dana doesn’t sing — but I’m assuming you can because it came down to you and Demi for the very singing heavy role of Mitchie.\n\nChloe: Yes, even when I was auditioning for “Coin Flip” I had to go through the whole thing. I sang in every audition so I definitely was expecting to sing – especially when I found out it was “Camp Rock 2.” But because I’d been walking around saying, “I’m so excited to perform,” the director came to me a few days before shooting and said, “we heard you’re really excited, but we’re so sorry, you’re not in any of the numbers.” It was like, “noooooooo!”\n\nPW: Did you try to pitch a song for Dana?\n\nChloe: [laughs] I didn’t, no. It meant I got a lot more sleep than the rest of the cast, so I wasn’t really complaining once the shooting schedule kicked in. They’d all go in early, stay late and I’d just be like, “later guys!”\n\nPW: These movies are filmed relatively in the middle of nowhere — did you guys go unnoticed during production?\n\nChloe: Well, that actually, that completely blew my mind, I had never been on a set like this. Fans would come wait outside our locations — at like five in the morning just to see us drive onto set. The Jonas’ fans and Demi’s fans and the fans of the franchise are just incredibly devoted. It blew my mind, I felt like I was working with the president. Super tight security. Am I missing something? Is Obama here? I was not prepared for that.\n\nPW: So what you’re saying is Sasha Obama has a “Camp Rock 2” cameo.\n\nChloe: Oh god, please don’t tell them you heard it from me [laughs]! Unfortunately no one from The White House is actually in the movie. I was getting stoked, like looking around thinking, “who’s here?” Oh wait, it’s The Jonas Brothers.\n\n“Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam” premieres September 3 at 8pm on Disney Channel.\n\nPhoto: Disney"
