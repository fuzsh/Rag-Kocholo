He's off to go,\n\nI'm gonna make him watch this movie for sure.\n\nDo you miss that at all,\n\nyou know, the Jonas brothers?\n\nWell, you know it's interesting,\n\nJoe's band was on the Jingle Ball tour\n\nthis last winter, and I was on the tour as well.\n\nAnd it was the first time since the split up\n\nthat we've kind of traveled together,\n\nin a way, working wise.\n\nSo, I've actually spent a lot of time with him\n\nover the last couple months,\n\nwhich has been nice.\n\nFor you the essence of performing obviously,\n\nin film, and you're a great live performer.\n\nIs there one that you prefer more than the other?\n\nI really have admiration for people,\n\nlike Gaga for instance this year\n\nand what she's been able to do with music and acting,\n\nand really progressing in both.\n\nYou know, and the music is always there.\n\nIt's within me, so it's not really\n\na conscious choice to do both,\n\nit's just there."
