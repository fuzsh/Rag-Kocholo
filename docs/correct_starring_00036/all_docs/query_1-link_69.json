        "text": "Are the Jonas Brothers reprising their Camp Rock roles?! According to Kevin Jonas, the eldest of the clan, “never say never.”\n\nIn honor of the 2008 Disney Channel Original Movie celebrating its 10th anniversary, E! Online asked Kevin at the Marshalls' Father's Day event in New York City recently if they’d ever do a third film.\n\n\"Never say never,\" Kevin said. \"We talked about it for a minute,\" the 30-year-old dad of two added, \"doing something ridiculous like an R-rated version now in our life, like a going back to camp kind of thing.\"\n\nKevin, who starred in the Disney fan favorite alongside Joe and Nick Jonas and Demi Lovato, said they’d \"definitely consider\" another Camp Rock sequel.\n\n\"It just has to be the right thing,” he concluded. “I can't believe 10 years has actually passed. It makes me feel like I'm getting old.\"\n\nKevin’s brother Joe is also on board.\n\nDuring a 2017 interview with Marie Claire, he mentioned the possibility of making an R-rated Camp Rock.\n\n\"If it made sense, sure,” he said at the time. “For all of us — Demi, Nick, it would be funny to do a spin on it. Do the graduating days, make it kinda dark. An adult film.\""
