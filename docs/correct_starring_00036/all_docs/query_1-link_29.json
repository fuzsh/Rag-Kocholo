Jonas also starred in Disney Channel original movies, \"Camp Rock\" and \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam.\"\n\nAfterward, Jonas and his bros forged a pop rock band, which the boys named the Jonas Brothers. The group saw major mainstream success -- similar to the One Direction frenzy -- but was cut short after three years. The Jonas Brothers have sold over 8 million albums worldwide and produced the smash hits, \"When You Look Me In The Eyes,\" \"Play My Music,\" and \"Burnin' Up.\"\n\nAfter the Jonas Brothers disbanded, Nick Jonas began a solo career -- previously known as Nick Jonas & The Administration -- before dropping that band and signing a deal with Island Records.\n\nNick Jonas is currently promoting his next, yet-to-be-titled album and its lead single \"Levels\" which premiered on this year's MTV Video Music Awards pre-show.\n\nHis latest album \"Nick Jonas\" has sold over 300,000 copies in the U.S. and spawned the hit singles \"Jealous\" and \"Chains.\""
