        "text": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B7mOgksnTOw/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=embed_video_watch_again\n\nThe Jonas Brothers are doing a pretty good job of establishing themselves as the kings of Tik Tok with this Camp Rock-inspired video.\n\nNick, Kevin and Joe Jonas threw it way back to 2008 in this hilarious clip, acting out a scene from the Disney movie they starred in.\n\nIt starred Joe as teen pop star Shane Gray who meets shy Camp Rock kitchen worker Mitchie (Demi Lovato) after hearing her sing.\n\nIn the Tik Tok clip, each band member wore wigs to mimic the hairstyle they sported back then (admit it, you thought it was cool at the time too), with Kevin even bringing back his iconic scarf accessory.\n\nSat in the back of a car they lip-synced perfectly to the moment Nick and Kevin’s characters Jason and Nate tried to convince Shane to go back to Camp Rock where their band Connect 3 got started.\n\n‘I don’t wanna waste my summer at some camp. I’m Shane Gray, for crying out loud!’ Joe says as Shane.\n\nNick replies: ‘Hey man we used to love this place, three years ago we were campers.’\n\n‘Yeah man this is where Connect 3, connected,’ Kevin says.\n\nNick adds: ‘And you get to see our Uncle Brown.’\n\n‘Not a selling point,’ Joe scoffs.\n\nThe video was captioned: ‘Presented without comment.’\n\nSince the Jo Bros reunited last year they have gone from strength to strength, with their comeback single Sucker making them the first boyband in 16 years to get to No.1 on the Billboard charts.\n\nThey’re all also disgustingly happily married, and brought their wives in on the fun for their new single What A Man Gotta Do.\n\nSophie Turner, Priyanka Chopra and Danielle Jonas joined respective hubbies Joe, Nick and Kevin in the video, which spoofed classic movies such as Risky Business and Grease.\n\nMORE : Red Velvet world tour confirmed by SM Entertainment as Wendy recovers from fall"
