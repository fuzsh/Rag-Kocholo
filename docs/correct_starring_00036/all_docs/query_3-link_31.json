        "text": "Nick Jonas and Paul Rudd are set to star in the latest movie from Jon Carney, the director behind Once and Sing Street.\n\nThe project, which was written by Carney and Peter McDonald, will follow Rudd as a wedding singer and Jonas as a flagging pop star who come together to write a song to comedic consequences. Filming is underway in Dublin.\n\nAnthony Bregman’s Likely Story is producing along with 30WEST, which is also set to finance with Screen Ireland. Along with Carney and Bregman, Likely Story’s Peter Cron will produce with Robert Walpole and Rebecca O’Flanagan for Treasure Entertainment, who worked with Carney on his last film Flora and Son, which landed at Apple after a Sundance debut.\n\n30WEST, WME Independent and UTA Independent Film Group are handling sales out of the Cannes market.\n\n“I’m delighted to be working with so many great people,” said Carney. “I’ve been working on this script with my buddy Peter for years, and now Paul Rudd and Nick Jonas are in my kitchen.”\n\n“We are so excited to bring John Carney’s next film to Cannes. John has a magic ability to weave great music into wonderfully engaging and universally relatable stories that make audience emotions run high,” said Alex Walton of WME. “Power Ballad is fun and heartwarming – themes that audiences crave today. His unique vision, coupled with the global appeal of Paul Rudd and Nick Jonas, will give buyers exactly what they’re looking for.”\n\nJonas, himself a pop star with the Jonas Brothers, has a onscreen credits that include the Jumanji films and WWII drama Midway. He is repped by UTA and Schreck Rose.\n\nRudd is currently in theaters with Ghostbusters movie Frozen Empire and has upcoming credits that include indie movie Friendship, starring Tim Robinson and Kate Mara, and A24’s Death of a Unicorn with Jenna Ortega. Rudd is repped by Lighthouse Management & Media, UTA and Jackoway Austen."
