        "text": "Yes, the sailor portrayed by heartthrob Nick Jonas in the new Hollywood film \"Midway\" really existed.\n\nAnd yes, Bruno Gaido was a hero, almost single-handedly saving his ship by shooting down a Japanese bomber before it could crash into the USS Enterprise.\n\nBut Jonas' New York accent is all wrong. Gaido grew up in Milwaukee.\n\n\"It wasn't right, but whatever,\" said Gaido's nephew Mike Bortolotti, who served in Vietnam in the Marines. \"I'm still in awe of what he did.\"\n\nAside from the accent and a fake story Jonas as Gaido tells fellow sailors worried about going into battle, the action scenes involving Gaido are spot on, said Bortolotti, who lives in Mequon.\n\nIn February 1942, during an American raid on the Japanese-held Marshall Islands, several Japanese bombers unsuccessfully attacked the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. The lead plane was badly damaged by anti-aircraft fire and as it turned toward the ship to crash into the Enterprise, Gaido ran from his duty station and leaped into the rear seat of an SBD Dauntless dive bomber parked on the flight deck of the Enterprise.\n\nThe 25-year-old Milwaukee man swiveled the plane's twin .30-caliber machine guns, took aim and shot down the bomber as it streaked toward the aircraft carrier. As the Japanese plane spiraled out of control, it narrowly missed the Enterprise and crashed into the ocean, its wingtip severing the tail of the Dauntless just feet from where Gaido was standing behind the guns, firing away.\n\nEven as the Dauntless swung around and nearly tipped over the side of the ship, Gaido kept shooting until the bomber was no longer a threat.\n\nThen Guido got out of the plane, used a fire extinguisher to put out a pool of flaming fuel from the Japanese bomber and returned to his duty station.\n\nA slack-jawed Admiral William \"Bull\" Halsey saw Gaido's heroic act, ordered him to come to the bridge and on the spot promoted him two ranks to Aviation Machinist Mate First Class.\n\n\"Running across an aircraft carrier deck and taking on a bomber coming in, it's just incredible,\" said Bortolotti, whose mother, Flora, was Gaido's sister.\n\nWhen news of Gaido's heroism reached Milwaukee, a Journal reporter and photographer were sent to the family home to interview his mother, Clementa, and tell her about her son's actions.\n\nShe told the reporter that her son wanted to join the Navy after high school graduation, but her husband said he was too young and should stay home and work. Six years later Gaido tried again to enlist and this time got an OK.\n\n\"He said to my husband, Mr. Gaido: 'I'm going, Pa.' And Mr. Gaido said, 'You're a man and I can't stop you. If you want to go, it's all right because now you're a man,'\" according to the May 13, 1942, Milwaukee Journal article.\n\nClementa Gaido read the journalists an April letter in which her son wrote: \"I won't be getting any leave until this business is over, so I won't be home so soon as I had figured I would.\" He does not mention shooting down the Japanese bomber.\n\nBefore the Journal reporters left, an ecstatic Clementa Gaido said she planned to celebrate her son's heroism.\n\n\"Tonight we will have the best wine for dinner. No beer and red wine tonight. Only the best. I will tell my husband all about Bruno and we will have a party,\" she said.\n\nGaido's parents were Italian immigrants who had eight children including Bruno, who was born in Illinois. After moving his family to Milwaukee, John Gaido held several jobs and owned a tavern that's now the Harp Irish Pub.\n\nBorn in 1916, Gaido graduated from Lincoln High School in 1934 and worked for a time at a Milwaukee County-run farm where he occasionally smuggled home a live chicken in his coat for his family's dinner table.\n\nHe enlisted in the Navy in October 1940, perhaps to seek adventure, his nephew said. In January 1941 he was assigned to the Enterprise as part of a carrier dive-bombing unit.\n\n\"My dad was a good friend of Uncle Bruno. He said he was a real happy guy, the kind of kid you could never get mad at,\" Bortolotti recalled. \"My dad said he was the best craps shooter, dice shooter, he had ever seen. Uncle Bruno never walked away from a dice game without money in his pocket.\"\n\nDuring the Battle of Midway in early June 1942, Gaido was in the rear seat of a Dauntless dive bomber piloted by Ensign Frank O'Flaherty of Nevada that was part of a squadron attacking Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga. The American dive bombers crippled the carrier, forcing the Japanese navy to scuttle it.\n\nBut Gaido's plane was damaged in the attack, probably ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean. According to a postwar investigation, Gaido and O'Flaherty survived but were picked up by a Japanese destroyer. In the movie, a defiant Gaido refuses to give any information and in a dramatic scene is pushed overboard with an anchor tied to his feet, dragging him beneath the surface.\n\nGaido's murder \"jumps right off the page because of its sheer barbarity,\" said Tom Mueller, an Oak Creek historian who included Gaido in his 2013 book, \"Duty, Honor, Country and Wisconsin.\"\n\nO'Flaherty met the same fate.\n\n\"The execution was June 15, which was 11 days after the battle, so they endured days of abuse,\" Mueller said.\n\nA telegram from the War Department was delivered to the Gaido home near North 2nd Street and Burleigh Avenue. He was listed as missing in action.\n\nGaido's mother was inconsolable and died two months later of a broken heart, said Bortolotti.\n\nBortolotti saw \"Midway\" after it was released last week and felt goosebumps as he watched his uncle portrayed on the big screen. His emotions turned dark, though, in the scene where Jonas' character is killed.\n\n\"That hit a nerve. I realize it's war, but to execute him? The Navy considered it murder,\" said Bortolotti.\n\nAll of Bruno Gaido's siblings are dead now. Before Bortolotti's Aunt Mary died, she gave him his uncle's Purple Heart, Distinguished Flying Cross and National Defense Service Medal. Bortolotti's sister has the letters Gaido sent home from the war, which the family is considering donating to the Wisconsin Veterans Museum.\n\nThere is no memorial marker for Gaido in Milwaukee though his name is inscribed at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii."
