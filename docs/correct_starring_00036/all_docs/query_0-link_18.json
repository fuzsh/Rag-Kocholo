The film centered on an aspiring singer-songwriter named Mitchie Torres, played by Demi Lovato, who attended a summer music camp, hence the DCOM's title.\n\n\"Camp Rock\" was Lovato's breakout role, and she starred alongside Joe Jonas, who played her love interest named Shane Gray. The two stars dated in real life, too. Siblings Nick and Kevin Jonas also had roles as Joe's on-screen bandmates, Nate and Jason, respectively, from the fictional group Connect 3.\n\nThe film was a success for the network and had approximately 8.9 million viewers during its June 2008 premiere, becoming the second most-watched DCOM behind \"High School Musical 2.\" \"Camp Rock's\" accompanying soundtrack also debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 200.\n\nIn September 2010, a sequel titled \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam\" was released on Disney Channel and Nick's character had a more prominent role, due to a romance with a girl named Dana Turner (Chloe Bridges) from a rival camp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead the original article on INSIDER.
