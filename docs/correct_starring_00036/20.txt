Nick Jonas is giving fans a peek at his starring role in the upcoming streaming movie musical production of "Jersey Boys."

On Monday, Jonas shared a snapshot of himself in character as Frankie Valli of The Four Seasons.

He's shown posing along the actors who play the other members of the group -- CJ Pawlikowski as Bob Gaudio, Matt Bogart as Nick Massi, Andy Karl as Tommy DeVito -- plus director Des McAnuff.

"The past couple months Iâ€™ve been in Cleveland playing my dream role as Frankie Valli in Jersey Boys!" he captioned his Twitter post. "With our incredible cast and crew, we worked tirelessly to create an amazing musical movie event for you all."

"Stay tuned for more exciting news," he teased. It's not clear which service will stream the film.

In June, Frankie Valli, 87, confirmed that Jonas would play him in the upcoming musical movie.

"Jersey Boys," which started out as a Broadway musical and was later made into a 2014 feature film, follows the rise and demise of The Four Seasons, famous for its hits like "Sherry," "Walk Like a Man," "Big Girls Don't Cry," and "December, 1963 (Oh What a Night)."
