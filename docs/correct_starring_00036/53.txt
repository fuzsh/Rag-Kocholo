Nick Jonas first found fame on the Disney Channel in the original series "Jonas L.A." alongside his brothers, Joe and Kevin. Jonas also starred in Disney Channel original movies, "Camp Rock" and "Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam."

Afterward, Jonas and his bros forged a pop rock band, which the boys named the Jonas Brothers. The group saw major mainstream success -- similar to the One Direction frenzy -- but was cut short after three years. The Jonas Brothers have sold over 8 million albums worldwide and produced the smash hits, "When You Look Me In The Eyes," "Play My Music," and "Burnin' Up."

After the Jonas Brothers disbanded, Nick Jonas began a solo career -- previously known as Nick Jonas & The Administration -- before dropping that band and signing a deal with Island Records.

Nick Jonas is currently promoting his next, yet-to-be-titled album and its lead single "Levels" which premiered on this year's MTV Video Music Awards pre-show.

His latest album "Nick Jonas" has sold over 300,000 copies in the U.S. and spawned the hit singles "Jealous" and "Chains."
