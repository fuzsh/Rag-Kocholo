        "text": "July, 2013\n\nThe Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA) in late July congratulated Acuinova Chile S.A. for achieving Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) certification.\n\nAcuinova Chile joins Nova Austral and a number of other Pescanova Group seafood processing plants in receiving BAP certification. Nova Austral’s salmon processing plant in Porvenir, Chile, earned BAP certification late last month.\n\nAcuinova Chile is located in Puerto Chacabuco-Aysen, Chile, in Region XI. The processing plant earned BAP certification on July 15. Acuinova Chile produces more than 35,000 metric tons of Atlantic salmon annually.\n\nThe product is sold primarily to retail and foodservice customers in the European Union, North America, Japan, Russia, China, Southeast Asia and Latin America. The plant produces fresh and frozen salmon in a variety of product forms, including fillets, portions, blocks, H&G and whole fish.\n\nAcuinova Chile said BAP certification provides further recognition of the high standards already achieved by the company and reaffirms its commitment to responsible salmon farming.\n\nWith the addition of the Acuinova and Nova Austral facilities and other processing plants, the BAP program has reached a milestone, surpassing the 600-facility mark. More than 600 processing plants, farms, feed mills and hatcheries are now BAP certified. That’s a net increase of more than 100 facilities since Nov. 30, 2012, when 497 processing plants, farms, feed mills and hatcheries were BAP certified.\n\nAdditionally, the combined annual output from BAP-certified salmon processing plants now exceeds 400,000 metric tons. Currently, much of the growth within the BAP program is attributed to salmon."
