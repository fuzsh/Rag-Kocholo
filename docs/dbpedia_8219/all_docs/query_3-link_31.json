        "text": "Constitution of Sodiga Galicia, with a capital share of Ptas 600 million, by the Instituto Nacional de Industria -INI- (with held 51% of the capital share), the seven Galician Saving Banks and several Banks.\n\nIts corporate mission is to promote the industrial development of Galicia, to promote the incorporation of new companies and the modernization and restructuring of existing ones.\n\nD. Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo y Bustelo was appointed as the first president of the entity.\n\nSodiga starts its business activity in February 1973, with the technical assistance and financial backing of its founding partners.\n\nThe first sectorial studies were carried out: primary mitiliculture, dairy, textile, naval or automotive auxiliary.\n\nFirst investments were made in companies such as \"Lácteas de Atlántico\", \"Proullasa\", \"Refractarios de Sant-Yago\" and \"Acuicultura de Atlántico\".\n\nIdentification of the promotion of new industrial land as one of the main needs for the industrial promotion of Galicia, for which the constitution of SIGALSA is promoted.\n\nNew general studies on the Galician economy were developed, such as the \"Analysis and distribution of the active population of Galicia\".\n\nThe investment in \"MEISA\" (Manzaneda Mountain Station) and in two transforming industry projects in the primary sector (\"COMPLESA\" and \"UTEGA\") stand out.\n\nBeginning of the direct provision of guarantees to investee companies, as well as the provision of accounting, economic and financial advisory services.\n\nInvestments were made in five companies: four of them were in operation -including \"Caucho Atlántica\"-, and one of them was newly created (\"Plásticos de Atlántico\").\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the subsidiary SIGALSA (with the participation of the Galician Saving Banks and several Banks), for the preparation and development of industrial land in Galicia.\n\nApproval of 11 new participations, for a total amount of Ptas 337.4 million.\n\nIn 1981 Sodiga Galicia formalized investments in 23 new companies, with an investment in their capital stock of Ptas 292.55 million.\n\nMorevoer, Sodiga increased the capital in investees by Ptas 50 million, and loans were granted in the amount of Ptas 555 million.\n\nNew strategies were opened to support technological innovation, including the beginning of collaboration with the University and postgraduate programs.\n\nIn 1982, after several capital increases throughout the first decade of Sodiga's existence, its capital stock amounted to Ptas 2,500 million.\n\nIn that year, Sodiga's financial investment amounted to Ptas 621 million, helping to create more than 700 jobs.\n\nThe operations of \"Vehículos Especiales Uro\", \"Facet Iberica\", \"Energía de Galicia\", etc. stand out, and the first business internship program for postgraduates was launched.\n\nIn 1983, Xunta de Galicia participated for the first time in a capital increase of Sodiga Galicia, reaching 7.27% of its share capital, with INI holding 51%. This operation represented, for the first time, the incorporation of an Autonomous Region into an Industrial Development Company (\"SODI\").\n\nIt is important to highlight SODIGA's participation as founding protective partner in the Galician Mutual Guarantee Companies AFIGAL and SOGARPO, as well as the investments in \"Lugar de Barral\", \"Plastycasset\" or \"Iberica de Autocares\".\n\nIn 1985 Sodiga Galicia invested in 17 new participations in companies, which meant a financial investment commitment of Ptas 983 million, and the generation of 670 new jobs.\n\nInvestments in \"Irosa\" (Valdeorras), \"Matrigalsa\" (Vigo), \"Galihiorta\" (Ferrol) and \"Incipresa\" (Mos) were particularly noteworthy.\n\nDuring the year, divestments were made in \"Granitos Ibéricos - Grayco\", \"Coparex Minera\", Hypor Ibérica\" and \"Manzaneda Estación Invernal\".\n\nIn 1986 Sodiga Galicia invested in 10 new participations in companies, 8 of which were newly incorporated companies.\n\nInvestments in \"Polyhips\" (Vigo), \"Galiflor\" (O Rosal), \"Bodegas de Vilariño-Cambados\" (Cambados), \"Dinak\" (Vigo), \"Quegalsa\" (Ferrol), \"Anodizados de Sabón\" (A Coruña) and \"Química de Ferrol\" (Ferrol) were particularly noteworthy.\n\nDuring the year divestments were made in the following companies: \"Maderas CER\", \"Cedegalsa\", \"Caolines de Vimianzo\", \"Urovesa\", \"Conservas Carballo\" and \"Visones del Noroeste\".\n\nIn 1988, the investment activity in the region of Ferrol was outstanding, related to the benefits of the decrees of delimitation of the Declining Industrial Zone (ZID) and the Economic Protection Zone (ZPE), which facilitated the attraction of new investments.\n\nThus, three large companies were formed: \"Galitec\", \"Tile Stone\" and \"Polipropileno de Galicia\". On addition, investments were also made in companies in other regions, such as \"Norsistemas\", \"Moldugasa\" and \"Salnesur\".\n\nDuring the year, divestments were made in \"Alunorsa\", \"Armesa\", \"Landesa\", \"Crimagasa\", \"Gaelico\", \"Ciesa\", \"Sidegasa\" and \"Lácteos Rueda\", for a total volume of Ptas 433 million.\n\nIn 1989, the investment activity initiated along the previous year in the region of Ferrol continued to be outstanding, thanks to the ZID and ZPE delimitations areas, reaching a total investment of Ptas 652 million.\n\nWithin the Ferrol region, new investments such as \"Forestal Atlántico\" or \"Emilio Maffezini\" stood out, while in other regions \"Termojet\" or \"Graninter\" in Vigo, and \"Conservas y Ahumados\" in Santiago de Compostela could be highlighted.\n\nDuring the year, the divestments of \"Cía de Motores Deutz-MWM\", \"Unicar\", \"Irosa\", \"Dinak\" or \"Galiflor\" were carried out, totalling a volume of Ptas 544 million.\n\nIn 1990, Sodiga made 10 new investments totalling Ptas 544 million.\n\nThe most noteworthy investments were in \"Frinova\" (Pescanova Group), \"Servinor\" and \"Norconsult\" (subsidiaries of Unión Fenosa), as well as \"Galega de Granitos\", \"Termojet\" and \"Sodeimón\". Finally, it is also important to highlight the new investment done in \"Dinak\", in which Sodiga took a stake for the second time after its significant growth (first investment in 1986, sold 3 years later).\n\nIn 1991, the \"European Group of Atlantic Arc Development Companies\" was created, under the presidency of SODIGA. The grouping is made up of 18 European regional development or venture capital companies (1 from Scotland, 1 from England, 7 from France, 8 from Spain and 1 from Portugal), in order to promote relationships between these regions and to obtain European Community aid.\n\nIn terms of investments, SODIGA made 14 new investments this year, including \"Acuinova Galicia\", \"Nak Electronics\", \"Ferroplast\" and \"Lamcol Orense\".\n\nIn 1992, Sodiga's financial investment amounted to Ptas 539 million, through the formalization of 14 new operations, being \"Ormasa\" and \"Udesa\" the first round investments, and the remaining 12 investments in the previous portfolio, highlighting the operations in \"Cyasa\", \"Neoplástina de España\", \"Ferroplast\" and \"Frinova\".\n\nIn addition, the incorporation of the Instituto Galego de Promoción Económica (IGAPE), as well as the beginning of negotiations for the incorporation of Sodiga into IGAPE itself, are also noteworthy.\n\nIn 1993, Sodiga's financial investment amounted to Ptas 560 million, through the formalization of 9 new operations, being \"Kiwi Atlántico\", \"Mecamos\" and \"Aprohigasa\" the first round investments, and the remaining 6 operations investments in the previous portfolio, highlighting the operations in \"Rodman-Poliships\", \"Insuiña\", \"Tile Stone\" or \"Gamansa\".\n\nWith regard to exits, 8 operations were carried out, most notably the case of \"Polipropileno de Galicia\", where its founder shareholders exercised their right to the return of their shareholding.\n\nIn 1994, an agreement was reached for the transfer of the ownership of Sodiga Galicia from \"Teneo\" (a state-owned company of the Spanish government, active from 1992 to 1996, which received its shareholding in Sodiga from INI), in favor of Xunta de Galicia.\n\nIn addition, several agreements were signed to intensify the collaboration between Sodiga and the regional administration.\n\nIn terms of investment activity, the operations with \"Bajamar Séptima\", \"Engasa\", \"Mecamos\", \"Frinova\" or \"Parque Eólico de Malpica\" were particularly noteworthy.\n\nAt the end of 1995, Xunta de Galicia already controlled more than 60% of Sodiga's equity, and a financial cooperation agreement was signed for the creation and management of a \"Fondo de Financiamento ao Investimento\" (FFI), endowed with Ptas 500 million, to capitalize Sodiga Galicia.\n\nAlso noteworthy was the creation of a venture capital fund, Galicia-North Portugal, within the framework of the \"Interreg II\" European Community initiative, structured through two investment vehicles - one in each territory.\n\nIn addition, Sodiga Galicia began collaborating with INESGA.\n\nIn 1996, cooperation with the Xunta de Galicia was reinforced, through IGAPE, INESGA and all the economic departments, confirming a substantial increase in the company's financial activity, as a result of the consolidation of SODIGA into a basic instrument of the business promotion policy of Xunta de Galicia.\n\nThis promotion, and the financial support to newly created companies, as well as to those already participated in previous years (\"Hidrogiesta\", \"Playdesa\", \"Pemalsa\", \"Guimanher\", \"Univi\"), represented an aggregate investment of almost Ptas 1,050 million, mainly in the form of shareholdings.\n\n1997 was the 25th anniversary of the founding of Sodiga.\n\nAfter the Xunta de Galicia took control of the company in 1995, 1997 witnessed the consolidation of the trend of increased investment volume initiated in 1995.\n\nThus, 24 financing operations were formalized in a total of 21 companies, for a total amount of Ptas 1,110 million. Of particular note were the investments made in \"Arteixo Telecom\" (electronics), \"Grupo Lácteo Gallego\" (food), \"Privilege\" (materials), \"Pescanova Chapela\" (food), \"Pino Herramientas\" (mechanics) and \"Allarluz\" (energy).\n\nIn 1999 Xesgalicia was created, a VC management company dependent on the Xunta de Galicia, which was entrusted with the management of Sodiga's assets, Sodiga's staff was also transferred to the new entity.\n\nIn addition, the venture capital created \"Adiante 2000\" and \"Emprende\" funds, also under the management of Xesgalicia, thus forming a new venture capital structure in Galicia.\n\nIn terms of investment, during the year, investments of more than Ptas 1,448 million were made, of which Ptas 398 million corresponded to investments associated with the Galicia-North Portugal agreement.\n\nThe main investments were \"Cooperativa-Zeltia Veterinaria\", \"Bioetanol Galicia\", \"Vicente Romeo\", \"Comunitel Portugal\" or \"Fibroplac\"."
