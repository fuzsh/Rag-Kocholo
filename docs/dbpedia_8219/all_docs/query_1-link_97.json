The document summarizes key trends in the global seafood industry in 2013-2014 based on Undercurrent News' ranking of the world's 100 largest seafood companies by turnover. \n\nSalmon prices hit record highs in 2013, leading to significant revenue and ranking increases for major salmon farming companies. Shrimp prices also rose due to supply shortages caused by Early Mortality Syndrome, benefiting some firms but hampering processors. Several companies fell from the previous year's ranking due to bankruptcy or declining revenues. Japanese firms maintained their dominant position accounting for over a quarter of the total turnover of the ranked companies.",
