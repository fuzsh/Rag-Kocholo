        "text": "Manuel Fernández de Sousa-Faro thus anticipated, ten years ago, that the excessive ambition with which Pescanova had governed would land him in jail.\n\n“I realize –wrote to a confidant, in about messages revealed exclusively by FARO DE VIGO, from the Prensa Ibérica group, and incorporated into instruction– that there is no chance of avoiding the consequences of bankruptcy, that it will be fraudulent, and that it will surely drag me to jail and ruin.”.\n\nThe businessman (Mérida, 1951) was prescient. What perhaps he did not venture is that he would have to digest such a large ball by himself: of the twelve prison sentences handed down in the National Court ruling for the bankruptcy of the fishing company, only his, that of the once all-powerful son of the founder, it will be effective. Six years in prison handed down by the Supreme Court for a continued crime of falsifying annual accounts, falsifying economic-financial information and raising assets. His praetorian guard In the company, the team of managers who helped him create an unreal Pescanova to deceive banks and investors to maintain his unbridled expansion, will not go to jail as they receive sentences of less than two years and have no criminal record. The sentence goes straight to the heart of Fernández de Sousa: against his freedom, his assets and the company, Pescanova SA –as a legal entity– that he gave and took everything from him.\n\n“The truth is that I never imagined that I would be in this situation. At my age, without work, without prestige”.With the sentence of the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court, issued on February 10 and transferred yesterday to the parties, the procedure is “definitively terminated”. With a trail of sentences infinitely more benevolent than those handed down in the first instance. Especially with regard to the BDO auditor and its managing partner Santiago Sañé, who had become the first auditor sentenced to prison in Spain. The High Court spares no criticism of this company, but has acquitted it of the crime of falsifying annual accounts; Sañé has also been exonerated. The ruling bears the signature of Manuel Marchena (president), Julián Sánchez Melgar, Pablo Llarena, Vicente Magro and Leopoldo Puente (speaker) and extends over 395 exhausting pages. Sousa, who had been sentenced by the National Court to eight years in prison, has managed to be acquitted of the crimes of falsifying a commercial document and aggravated fraud, which has also made it possible to reduce the sentence of the hard wing of your management team. He will not recover the 4.65 million euros that he tried to take to Hong Kong via Portugal, in agreement with his wife (Rosario Andrade Detrell), under the false pretext of taking advantage of the best Asian financial offers.\n\nthe tricks\n\nThe document recalls the account of the facts of the first instance: Sousa, with the “explicit consent of people he trusts”, carried out a heterogeneous range of irregular practices to hide the bankruptcy of Pescanova, to which it had embarked on a growth strategy initially based on “cheap loans” and to which it dedicated, between 2007 and 2013 alone, close to 834 million euros with the aim of leading the world ranking of the sector. He was no longer able to pay those loans and became inventive: he created a network of instrumental companies to fake the sale of fish, he invented invoices with previous clients, he hid debt in subsidiaries or he issued massive purchase orders to simulate a business activity that would allow you to access lines of factoring or documentary credits. Always, as he has defended to exhaustion, thinking “of the benefit of society.” “The defendant presents and assumes the performance of these practices as a kind of inane behavior, which was imposed on him by the reality of the market,” states the opinion. Some tricks that “also enabled him to project in the annual accounts of the company that he chaired and in the corresponding information brochures, a false image of solvency, capable of deceiving potential investors.” It did not go well: Pescanova SA was the protagonist of the largest non-real estate tender in the history of Spain, with liabilities of more than 3,650 million euros. In a rally towards its survival, the multinational lost assets such as Pesca Chile, Nova Austral, Lafonia (Malvinas), Austral Fisheries (Australia), Nova Honduras, Acuinova Actividades Piscícolas (Portugal), Hasenosa or Belnova (Uruguay).\n\n“Bad with my lawyer […] bad because they are throwing the ships from A Lagoa and on top of that it seems that Pescanova sold the one from Australia”.\n\nWith the financial crisis, those “cheap credits” that Fernández de Sousa used –the then general director of Caixa Galicia, José Luis Méndez, was one of his great patrons– evaporated. That’s where the spinning wheel of the “tricks” began to work, the lies. “The truth is that Manuel Fernández de Sousa-Faro proceeded to fraudulently falsify the economic-financial information in the documents that the company had to publish and disseminate. […] deliberately obscuring the bank liability that he tried to simulate […] all with the purpose of attracting investors and thus obtain sufficient financing to continue with the development of the company; conduct that, without the slightest doubt, was carried out for its benefit”. This benefit in favor of Pescanova SA is what has just firmly condemned the company for falsifying economic-financial information; He must satisfy, together with Sousa, the more than 125 million losses claimed by investment funds and private savers who invested in the fishery confident that the accounts were real.\n\nThe acquittal of BDO squanders the options of those affected to receive more than 125 million in compensation\n\nHere comes the role of BDO, greatly disapproved in the first instance. The ruling of the Supreme Court, in this regard, is harsh against the ruling of the National Court, which it calls “confused”, “dispersed in the narrative” or “lacking assertiveness”. “No explanation is added in relation to the reasons why the now accused [en referencia a Sañé, el auditor responsable] he would have lent himself to such practices, without there being the slightest evidence that, in effect, he received some kind of premium for this, for his own benefit and/or for that of society.” Does this excuse the behavior of the auditor, who had to verify that, indeed, the accounts of the listed Pescanova SA corresponded to reality? Absolutely. The ruling itself written by Lepoldo Puente states “it could justify, with all evidence, the exercise before the auditor and / or before Santiago Sañé of the civil actions that those harmed by his actions could consider appropriate”. Because BDO’s work was exercised “carelessly, disregarding the supervisory powers to which it had committed, and failing to notice relevant deficiencies that, in an adequate professional praxis, could have and should have detected”.\n\nThe role of BDO in relation to compensation is essential, since in first instance had been sentenced to indemnify jointly and severally, with the other condemned, to entities such as Luxempart, Grupo Damm or Silicon Metals Holding. Only the auditor had an insurance policy, with Mapfre, which guaranteed the payment of 40 million euros. With BDO gone from this equation, only one company with no activity remains (Pescanova SA) and one businessman who, in his inventory of assets, provided a squalid list: two used cars, a bank account with just over 4,000 euros, worthless shares and undeveloped land in El Escorial. The options that those affected by bankruptcy now have go through take these civil actions against the audit, without prejudice to the fact that Pescanova SA tries to pass this sanction on Nueva Pescanova. It will try, in any case, to apply the same reduction suffered by those trapped in the bankruptcy of the group, of 85%.\n\nTen years\n\nRelated news\n\nNineteen appeals for cassation were filed against the judgment of the National Court, and in all of them a reduction in the penalties was claimed for the mitigation of undue delay. Not surprisingly, this February 28 will be the tenth anniversary of the night that Pescanova communicated to the CNMV –as this newspaper then reported for the first time– that it was insolvent. “Already the first of these periods, – mentions the Supreme Court ruling on the investigation phase -, approximately seven years, easily exceeds the parameters that, ordinarily, have been used by this Chamber to calibrate, in a flexible manner, the eventual existence of undue delays”.\n\n“I won’t be able to last long. At the most it will be six weeks and then I will never be president again, in addition to the fact that from here to there the lawsuits will multiply by thousands against me and they will make public that money was being lost these years ago “."
