        "text": "Nueva Pescanova’s owner, Abanca, is reconsidering a sale to Iberconsa after issues arose in Cooke's ongoing due diligence process as part of its own planned acquisition of the company.\n\nCooke’s offer for Nueva Pescanova, originally in the range of EUR 150 million (USD 165 million) plus the assumption of EUR 500 million (USD 552 million) in liabilities in exchange for 80 percent of Nueva Pescanova, valuing the company at EUR 800 million (USD 875 million), has been cut to EUR 50 million (USD 54.7 million) plus a capital injection of EUR 200 million (USD 218.8 million), El Confidencial reported, citing several sources with knowledge of the negotiations.\n\nEl Confidencial previously reported Redondela, Pontevedra, Spain-based Nueva Pescanova’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) fell to EUR 20 million (USD 21.7 million) in 2022, down from EUR 80 million (USD 86.8 million) in 2021, and its operating profit dropped from EUR 70 million (USD 75.9 million) in 2021 to EUR 40 million (USD 43.4 million) last year.
