        "text": "Nueva Pescanova to open new factory in Peru. The Nueva Pescanova Group will consolidate its presence in Peru with the construction of a new 8,000 square metre factory, which will begin operating by the end of 2021.\n\nWith an investment of 7 million euros, the new production plant will be mainly used for processing and commercialising cephalopods such as shortfin squid, fish such as mahi and processed fish such as surimi, with an estimated production of 12,700 tonnes per year. In addition, around 900 tonnes of other species such as octopus, squid and greater silver smelt will also be processed.\n\nThe Novaperú plant, a subsidiary of the Nueva Pescanova Group in the country, will be located in the fishing port of Pucusana, on the outskirts of Lima. This is a strategic location for the company due to its proximity to the sea. Around 170 people will be directly employed at its facilities, which means a 10% increase in the subsidiary’s workforce.\n\nAccording to Manuel Quintana del Hierro, general manager of Novaperú:\n\n“the new plant will allow the company to increase its production capacity for species such as shortfin squid and mahi, as well as the elaboration of new products to improve the Group’s vertical integration. In addition, the new facilities will have automated production lines that will allow to save energy, improve production efficiency and obtain ISO14000 certification”.\n\nPescanova started its activity in Peru in 1989 with trading operations. Its subsidiary Novaperú, with a plant in the district of San Juan de Miraflores in Lima, was founded in 1995. This plant, which will be operating until the new one starts up, processes a range of seafood products, including cephalopods (squid and jumbo squid) and other species, such as mahi-mahi, greater silver smelt or mackerel. Its annual production capacity is 8,000 tonnes."
