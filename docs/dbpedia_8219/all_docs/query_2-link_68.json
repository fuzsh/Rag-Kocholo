        "text": "Mergers & Acquisitions\n\nThe company hopes to boost sales of shrimps and prawns as strategic products of the Group.\n\nNueva Pescanova has extended its presence in Africa by acquiring Unick Fish, a South African importer and marketer of seafood products whose total sales in 2017 exceeded €10 million.\n\n\"With this investment, Nueva Pescanova aims to boost its sales of shrimp and prawns, which are strategic products for the Group. Further, the company accomplishes the integration of its operations in a market with high potential and strategic interest for the company, always seeking in its continuous quest to bring the best of the sea to the consumer tables around the world\", informs the company in a press release.\n\nNueva Pescanova is present in the African market for 54 years now and its operations are regarding both fishing and distribution of seafood products. Its subsidiaries are located in Angola (Marnova) engaged in fishing red shrimp, white shrimp, and crab; Namibia, (Novanam and Lalandii) with 2,200 employees, focused in fishing, processing and distribution hake, monk, angelfish, kingklip and other species; and Mozambique (Pescamar) where more than 30 of the company's fishing vessels catch different prawn species, mainly tiger, banana, brown, king and jumbo prawns.\n\nIn the last few years, the company struggled to emerge from a bankruptcy procedure and has diversified the range of products in order to respond to the latest trends in the market. At Seafood Expo Global in Brussels, Belgium in April 2018, the company announced it will be adding several new products to its chilled seafood category, including a range of chilled shrimps (whole, raw, and cooked) in Italy and France, and “Lonchas de Mar” and “Palitos de Mar” in Spain – both marketed by the company as “healthy options to be taken as a snack or for breakfast.”, reports Seafood Source magazine.\n\n\"The new Pescanova range of ready-to-eat products is an ideal option for lunches and dinners, as they can be eaten straight out of the tray or sautéed or grilled for an extra flavour boost,\" the company said.\n\nComments\n\nSimilar articles"
