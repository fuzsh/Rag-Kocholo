        "text": "There’s no better option for the uncompromising climber who values performance up and down the mountain than the new SES 2.3. At sub-1200 grams, they’re in a league of their own and deliver a real-world advantage in hilly terrain through their lightweight design and confidence-inspiring handling.\n\nModern-day alpinists take their ethos of ‘Fast and Light’ seriously by avoiding unnecessarily heavy gear to get up the mountains quickly while maintaining confidence on the way down. The SES 2.3 subscribes to that same idea in the pursuit of scaling mountains efficiently and providing even more fun and stability on the descent. Paring down from the SES 3.4, it maintains the proven Smart ENVE System design elements of dissimilar front and rear rim depths for handling the varying air flow elements from the front to the back of the bike.\n\nAt 28mm for the front depth and 32mm for the rear depth, the SES 2.3 provides crosswind stability and flatland aerodynamic efficiency to descend confidently and carry speed in the flat valleys between climbs. Utilizing hookless bead tubeless technology allowed our engineers to pull more weight out of this wheelset, tune the comfort, maintain strength, and ensure an exacting rim bead seat diameter to provide the most precise tubeless interface. This wheelset is tubeless and disc brake only. When it comes to the biggest climbs of the Grand Tours or the undulating terrain out your front door, there’s simply nothing faster."
