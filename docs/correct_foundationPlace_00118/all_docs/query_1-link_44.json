The club contributed not only labour, but $10,000 to the purchase and erection of the new playground. The Calgary Board of Education encouraged replacement of the equipment at which time the parents of the school formed a committee to raise funds for a new playground. Mountainview Lion Bill Chennells proposed funding of this initiative to the club. The replaced playground equipment is being shipped to Mexico through \"Angels for Mexico\" and a local Mexican Lions club.\n\nMountainview always ready to help Seniors in their community.\n\nAt the November 10th club meeting, members were reminded of the needs of many Seniors in their community, not only during the Christmas season but all year round.\n\nGuest speaker, Dianne Cooper-Ponte, from the Calgary Seniors Resource Society (CSRS) thanked the club for the years of support for three of the Society's programs and spoke of the continuing need not only for funding support but also for volunteers for their many programs. Once again this Christmas, the club is supporting the \"Adopt A Grandparent\" program through the \"Christmas Cheer Up\" campaign. Volunteers deliver stockings full of gifts to isolated seniors and spend an hour or so with them during the holidays as many seniors spend Christmas completely alone without the companionship of family or friends. The club provides funding to fill at least 100 of these stockings.\n\nFor more information on the Calgary Seniors Resource Society, please click on their logo.\n\n(Picture: Dianne Cooper-Ponte on the left, club President Lion Margaret Young on right)\n\nFor The Children . . . .\n\nIn May of this year, Mountainview Club presented a cheque in the amount of $18,000 to the Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation. In November of 2014, Patty Bambrick, Director of Annual & Planned Giving of the Foundation, spoke to the club about the priorities of the Foundation to provide excellence in child care. High on the priority list is the need for Cardio Respiratory Monitors. Children's Hospital is the first hospital in Alberta to provide CR monitors for children including infants and toddlers. Presently the hospital has approximately 80 CR monitors and is fundraising to obtain additional ones. Each monitor cost $17,000 - $18,000. The monitors measure heart rate, breathing rate and oxygen saturation as well as having an alarm system to indicate changes to the care giver. It was after this presentation by Ms. Bambrick that the club commited to providing funds for an additional Cardio Respiratory Monitor.\n\n(In picture from left to right: Lions John, Betty Ann, Sandra, Joey, Margaret, and Director Patty Bambrick.)\n\nClub Assists Students Heading for University.\n\nWith the assistance of matching funding from LOAF (Lions of Alberta Foundation), the club provided funding for two graduating students from Calgary's Robert Thursk High School who had enrolled in the University of Calgary to continue their education. On June 18th at the school's Graduation Ceremony, the two students received their $1,000 scholarships from Club President, Lion Betty Ann Adams (centre in picture). The students will be attending a club meeting in the fall to tell members a bit about their future plans.\n\nMany, many \"Thank you\"s received by Club\n\nAfter the Club provided two early morning breakfasts to the students and teachers of St. Rita School in Calgary, many beautifully decorated \"thank you\" cards and posters were received. This was the first year of the Club's School Breakfast Program which was initiated and organized by Lion Dodie.\n\nThe Mountainview Lions Club has gone Virtual!\n\nFor the past three years, the Mountainview Club has enabled its Members to participate in regular meetings via Skype when not able to attend in person. As this initiative has been very successful, it will be continued\n\nin the coming year. It has enabled the Club to retain Members who otherwise would not be eligible to continue as an active Member of the club.\n\nAbout Mountainview Lions\n\nMountainview Lions Club was formed in 2004 to serve communities in the Northwest of Calgary.
