        "text": "All Nature's wildness tells the same story: the shocks and outbursts of earthquakes, volcanoes, geysers, roaring , thundering waves and floods, the silent uprush of sap in plants, storms of every sort, each and all, are the orderly, beauty-making love-beats of Nature's heart.\n\n- \"Three adventures in the Yosemite\" (off-site link tounz.org) in \"The Century Magazine\", vol. LXXXIII, no. 5 (March, 1912) page 661 [also available on Google Books]; modified slightly in The Yosemite (1912) chapter 4.\n\nI only went out for a walk, and finally concluded to stay out till sundown, for going out, I found, was really going in.\n\n- John of the Mountains: The Unpublished Journals of John Muir, (1938), edited by Linnie Marsh Wolfe, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1938, republished 1979, page 439.\n\nOne touch of nature makes the whole world kin.\n\n(Muir used this statement in two different places, with quite different connotations. The one usually intended when the quote is used by itself is probably this one:\n\n\"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin; and it is truly wonderful how love-telling the small voices of these birds are, and how far they reach through the woods into one another's hearts and into ours. The tones are so perfectly human and so full of anxious affection, few mountaineers can fail to be touched by them.\" This version supports Muir's view that there is kinship among all species.\n\nJohn Muir, Our National Parks, Chapter 7, 1917.\n\nMuir also used a slight variation of the same statement, with a rather different context and meaning, in The Cruise of the Corwin:\n\n\"Joe's wife came aboard for a final farewell. After taking him aside and talking with him, the tears running down her cheeks, she left the vessel and went back with some others who had come to trade deerskins, while we sailed away. One touch of nature makes all the world kin, and here were many touches among the wild Chukchis.\" This version supports Muir's view that all people are brothers, regardless of culture or race.\n\n- The Cruise of the Corwin (1917) chapter 3\n\nBoth versions by John Muir echo William Shakespeare, which in turn seems to use the phrase in a different context, in Troilus and Cressida, iii, 3: \"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.\")\n\nTwo versions of the following can be found:\n\nVersion 1:\n\n\"As long as I live, I'll hear waterfalls and birds and winds sing. I'll interpret the rocks, learn the language of flood, storm, and the avalanche. I'll acquaint myself with the glaciers and wild gardens, and get as near the heart of the world as I can.\"\n\n- As quoted (paraphrased) by Linnie Marsh Wolfe, Son of the Wilderness: The Life of John Muir (1945) page 144, (referring to Muir Journals, c. March, 1871)\n\nVersion 2:\n\n\"As long as I live, I'll hear waterfalls and birds and winds sing... I'll interpret the rocks, the tones of flood storm and the avalanche, and acquaint myself with glaciers and wild gardens ... altogether as one harmony. I will follow my instincts ...be myself for good or for ill, not leaving the world, but going into it, as near its heart as I can get.\"\n\n- Extracted from - Autobiography...Introduction [No.1], c1876. (Handwritten manuscript followed by typewritten transcript by Linnie Marsh Wolfe), identified in , Register for the John Muir Papers (1849-1957 Finding Aid from the University of the Pacific, specifically \"SERIES IIIb, c, d: PUBLISHED & PRECURSOR WORKS; UNPUBL. WORKS; NOTES 3.7.37.05361.\n\nNotwithstanding the magnificent views opened by science into the universe, everything still ends in mystery and infinity.\n\n- \"Mysterious Things,\" quoted in Wurtz, M. J. (2006). John Muir Disrupts a Seance. John Muir Newsletter, 17(1), 3â€“4.\n\nHow many hearts with warm red blood in them are beating under cover of the woods, and how many teeth and eyes are shining! A multitude of animal people, intimately related to us, but of whose lives we know almost nothing, are as busy about their own affairs as we are about ours.\n\n- Our National Parks, (1901), chapter 1.\n\nThese temple-destroyers, devotees of ravaging commercialism, seem to have a perfect contempt for Nature, and instead of lifting their eyes to the God of the mountains, lift them to the Almighty Dollar. Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for water-tanks the people's cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man.\n\n- The Yosemite (1912) chapter 15.\n\nHow infinitely superior to our physical senses are those of the mind! The spiritual eye sees not only rivers of water but of air. It sees the crystals of the rock in rapid sympathetic motion, giving enthusiastic obedience to the sun's rays, then sinking back to rest in the night. The whole world is in motion to the center. So also sounds. We hear only woodpeckers and squirrels and the rush of turbulent streams. But imagination gives us the sweet music of tiniest insect wings, enables us to hear, all round the world, the vibration of every needle, the waving of every bole and branch, the sound of stars in circulation like particles in the blood. The Sierra canyons are full of avalanche debris -- we hear them boom again, for we read past sounds from present conditions. Again we hear the earthquake rock-falls. Imagination is usually regarded as a synonym for the unreal. Yet is true imagination healthful and real, no more likely to mislead than the coarser senses. Indeed, the power of imagination makes us infinite.\n\n- John of the Mountains: The Unpublished Journals of John Muir, (1938) page 226.\n\nHiking - \"I don't like either the word or the thing. People ought to saunter in the mountains - not hike! Do you know the origin of that word 'saunter?' It's a beautiful word. Away back in the Middle Ages people used to go on pilgrimages to the Holy Land, and when people in the villages through which they passed asked where they were going, they would reply, 'A la sainte terre, 'To the Holy Land.' And so they became known as sainte-terre-ers or saunterers. Now these mountains are our Holy Land, and we ought to saunter through them reverently, not 'hike' through them.\"\n\n- John Muir quoted by Albert W. Palmer in The Mountain Trail and its Message (1911) pages 27-28 - excerpted in A Parable of Sauntering.\n\nEditor's Note: Most likely, Muir got his reference to the phrase \"going a la Sainte Terre\" from this excerpt from Henry David Thoreau's 1862 essay on \"Walking.\" In any case, the accuracy of the quote about hiking vs. sauntering attributed to John Muir by Albert W. Palmer above is verified by a very similar account by another early Sierra Club member, C. Nelson Hackett, who reported meeting John Muir on the trail while on the 1908 Sierra Club Annual Outing to the Kern River Region. Hackett explains:\n\n\"He [Muir] said, 'Where are you going?' And we said, 'Why, we are just hiking in to camp.' And he said, 'Hiking' is a vile word. You are going right past one of the finest views in the Sierra. Now stop and look at it. Now as you are looking down, there is that beautiful lake, and the moraine is where the glacier stopped and dropped all those rocks that you see there, and the lake formed behind it.' And he said, 'You know, when the pilgrims were going from England to the Holy Land, the French would ask them 'Where are you going?' and they did not speak French very well, but they would say 'Sante Terre' (Holy Land). That is where we get our word 'saunter'. And you should saunter through the Sierra, because this is a holy land, if ever there was one.'\"\n\nSource: C. Nelson Hackett in \"Lasting Impressions of the Early Sierra Club\" in Sierra Club Reminiscences Volume II, 1900s-1960s. See also a summary of this 1908 encounter in Sauntering in the Sierra by Roger Eardley-Pryor, PhD, in Berkeley Library Update (University of California), July 2, 2018.\n\nYosemite Park is a place of rest, a refuge from the roar and dust and weary, nervous, wasting work of the lowlands, in which one gains the advantages of both solitude and society. Nowhere will you find more company of a soothing peace-be-still kind. Your animal fellow beings, so seldom regarded in civilization, and every rock-brow and mountain, stream, and lake, and every plant soon come to be regarded as brothers; even one learns to like the storms and clouds and tireless winds. This one noble park is big enough and rich enough for a whole life of study and aesthetic enjoyment. It is good for everybody, no matter how benumbed with care, encrusted with a mail of business habits like a tree with bark. None can escape its charms. Its natural beauty cleans and warms like a fire, and you will be willing to stay forever in one place like a tree.\n\n- John of the Mountains: The Unpublished Journals of John Muir, (1938) page 350.\n\nGovernment protection should be thrown around every wild grove and forest on the mountains, as it is around every private orchard, and the trees in public parks. To say nothing of their value as fountains of timber, they are worth infinitely more than all the gardens and parks of towns.\n\n- John of the Mountains: The Unpublished Journals of John Muir, (1938) page 350-351.\n\nWinds are advertisements of all they touch, however much or little we may be able to read them; telling their wanderings even by their scents alone.\n\n- The Mountains of California (1894) chapter 10.\n\nMy fire was in all its glory about midnight, and, having made a bark shed to shelter me from the rain and partially dry my clothing, I had nothing to do but look and listen and join the trees in their hymns and prayers.\n\n- Travels in Alaska (1915) chapter 2.\n\nOne day's exposure to mountains is better than cartloads of books. See how willingly Nature poses herself upon photographers' plates. No earthly chemicals are so sensitive as those of the human soul.\n\n- John of the Mountains: The Unpublished Journals of John Muir, (1938) page 95.\n\nThe mountains are fountains of men as well as of rivers, of glaciers, of fertile soil. The great poets, philosophers, prophets, able men whose thoughts and deeds have moved the world, have come down from the mountains - mountain dwellers who have grown strong there with the forest trees in Nature's workshops.\n\n- John of the Mountains: The Unpublished Journals of John Muir, (1938) pages 315-316.\n\nThere is at least a punky spark in my heart and it may blaze in this autumn gold, fanned by the King. Some of my grandfathers must have been born on a muirland for there is heather in me, and tinctures of bog juices, that send me to Cassiope, and oozing through all my veins impel me unhaltingly through endless glacier meadows, seemingly the deeper and danker the better.\n\n-- Letter to Mrs. Ezra S. Carr, location and date indicated as \"Squirrelville, Sequoia Co. Nut Time\" (c. 1870) as quoted in The Life and Letters of John Muir (1924) chapter 8.\n\nPlants, animals, and stars are all kept in place, bridled along appointed ways, with one another, and through the midst of one another -- killing and being killed, eating and being eaten, in harmonious proportions and quantities.\n\n- from \"Wild Wool\", from \"Overland Monthly\" (April 1875) reprinted in Steep Trails (1918) chapter 1.\n\nWander here a whole summer, if you can. Thousands of God's wild blessings will search you and soak you as if you were a sponge, and the big days will go by uncounted. If you are business-tangled, and so burdened by duty that only weeks can be got out of the heavy-laden year ... give a month at least to this precious reserve. The time will not be taken from the sum of your life. Instead of shortening, it will indefinitely lengthen it and make you truly immortal.\n\n- Our National Parks (1901) Chapter 1.\n\nLie down among the pines for a while, then get to plain pure white love-work ... to help humanity and other mortals and the Lord.\n\n- Letter from John Muir to Mrs. J.D. (Katharine) Hooker, 19 September 1911, from Para, Brazil, as quoted in The Life and Letters of John Muir (1924) chapter 17, II\n\nand in John Muir's Last Journey (2001) page 67.\n\nI love [the] ocean as I do the mountains--indeed the mountains are an ocean with harder waves...\n\n- John Muir,\n\n- Letter to J.B. McChesney, December 10, 1872, in Life and Letters of John Muir, Chapter 10.\n\nGod who is Light has led me tenderly from light to light to the shoreless ocean of rayless beamless Spirit Light that bathes these holy mountains.\n\n- John Muir - Letter to Mrs. Kate N. Daggett, December 30, 1872, in Life and Letters of John Muir, Chapter 10.\n\nFew are altogether deaf to the preaching of pine trees. Their sermons on the mountains go to our hearts; and if people in general could be got into the woods, even for once, to hear the trees speak for themselves, all difficulties in the way of forest preservation would vanish.\n\n- John Muir,\n\n- \"The National Parks and Forest Reservations\" in a speech by John Muir (Proceedings of the Meeting of the Sierra Club Held November 23, 1895.) Published in Sierra Club Bulletin, (1896), v. 1, no. 7, January 1896, pp 271-284, at 282-83.\n\nAll the wild world is beautiful, and it matters but little where we go, to highlands or lowlands, woods or plains, on the sea or land or down among the crystals of waves or high in a balloon in the sky; through all the climates, hot or cold, storms and calms, everywhere and always we are in God's eternal beauty and love. So universally true is this, the spot where we chance to be always seems the best.\n\n- John of the Mountains: The Unpublished Journals of John Muir, (1938) page 299.\n\nI have this one big, well-defined faith for humanity as a workman, that the time is coming when every \"article of manufacture\" will be as purely a work of God as are these mountains and pine trees and bonnie loving flowers.\n\n- Letter to Mrs. Kate N. Daggett, December 30,1872, in Life and Letters of John Muir, Chapter 10.\n\nWith inexpressible delight you wade out into the grassy sun-lake, feeling yourself contained on one of Nature's most sacred chambers, withdrawn from the sterner influences of the mountains, secure from all intrusion, secure from yourself, free in the universal beauty. And notwithstanding the scene is so impressively spiritual, and you seem dissolved in it yet everything about you is beating with warm, terrestrial human love, delightfully substantial and familiar.\n\n- John Muir, \" The Glacier Meadows\" Scribner's Monthly, February, 1879, from Nature Journal with John Muir edited by Bonnie Johanna Gisel (Poetic Matrix Press, 2006) and The Glacier Meadows, Chapter 7, of The Mountains of California (1894).\n\nGoing to the mountains is going home.\n\n- Our National Parks, (1901), chapter 1, page 1.\n\nThe mountains are calling and I must go, and I will work on while I can, studying incessantly.\n\n- Letter to sister Sarah Galloway, September 3,1873, in Life and Letters of John Muir, Chapter 10 (1923).\n\n[Note that this quote is often truncated, removing the last half, as if going on vacation to visit a mere playground. But reading the full quote, Muir actually insisted that going to the mountains was only a first step. As Michael Wurtz points out in \"What Muir Really Meant by 'the Mountains Are Calling' in Adventure Journal, August 13, 2018, \"the shortened quote doesn't fully capture John Muir or his desire to understand and protect California's Yosemite.\" The reason to go was to study nature, and just as important, work to protect our wilderness areas. Elsewhere in the letter, Muir revealed that he was spending \"the season in prosecuting my researches,\" and hoped to make a scientific contribution from his mountain studies, in winter to \"work with my pen.\" Wurtz points out, \"These words reveal a man who saw responsibility and purpose as well as pleasure in the mountains.\" As writer Michael Seeger writes, \"Perhaps we all would do well to work on studying nature while we can - and if we don't work to protect our lands, we may not have long to do so.\"] (If the Adventure Journal link no longer works, the article is available on the Internet Archive WayBack Machine. This essay by Michael Wurtz was first published as How John Muir's Incessant Study Saved Yosemite in The Conversation in 2016.\n\nQuotations from John Muir were selected by Harold Wood from various sources.\n\nMany thanks to Dan Styer for finding and identifying the sources for many of these quotes. See his story about how he helped improve this website, as well as the WikiQuotes page of John Muir quotes, on his web page about the Quotable John Muir. On that page he also provides further background on the source of the \"Between every two pine trees...\" quote.\n\nA note on sources:\n\nCAUTION: There are several misquotes of John Muir widely circulated on the Internet, printed on souvenirs like mugs and signs, and even in published books. See our John Muir Misquoted page to make sure you don't use quotes incorrectly attributed to John Muir.\n\nDifferent versions of Muir's best quotes can be found in several of his published articles, letters, and journal reprints, as well as his books. Generally speaking, books and articles published prior to 1923 are in the public domain; however, note that some of Muir's most-quoted passages come from the book John of the Mountains - The Unpublished Journals of John Muir, edited by Linnie Marsh Wolfe. Scholars are discovering that Wolfe not infrequently edited or paraphrased some of Muir's original writings, keeping the original idea but simplying language and removing redundancies and digressions. That book was first published in 1938, copyright renewed 1966 by John Muir Hanna and Ralph Eugene Wolfe. It will be at least 95 years after its original publication before this work becomes public domain, unless Congress extends the copyright period yet again.
