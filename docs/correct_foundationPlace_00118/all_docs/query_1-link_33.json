        "text": "We recently spoke with Allissa Impink, CICF Director of Family Philanthropy and Senior Advisor to Glick Philanthropies and Central Indiana Senior Fund, to learn more about the unique skillset she brings to CICF. In Allissa's formative years, before working with CICF, Allissa was a middle school teacher. She is passionate about the importance of education. This unique perspective allows her to advise fundholders and philanthropists in an extraordinary way. So, we couldnâ€™t resist highlighting her during teacher appreciation week. Allissa learned three lessons in the classroom that she believes are applicable for all community members, fundholders, and everyone in between. ðŸ“™ Build Trust â€“ She refined this perspective in the classroom but uses it every day at CICF. Trust is the foundation for great relationship. ðŸ“˜ Be Loud and Proud â€“ She applied this approach as a teacher and still today in her philanthropy work. Whenever you are feeling unsure or stepping into a new space, remember to be loud and proud! ðŸ“— Remember Policy â€“ Politics affect policies, and that trickles down to affect everyone. Allissa is so passionate about policy that she is running for her local school board. Thanks to Allissa for sharing your insights, and thank you to the current and former teachers in Central Indiana; we appreciate you! Stay tuned to learn more about the unique contributions of other CICF team members."
