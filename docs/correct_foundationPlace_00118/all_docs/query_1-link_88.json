        "meta_description": "President Anita welcomed members and guests at 12.30 pm to our second meeting back at the Old Adobe in Mountain View.\r\n \r\nRoger led the Pledge of Allegiance. \r\n\r\nThought for the Day: Sheila had thoughts about vacations and holidays here and abroad.\r\n \r\nWe had no visitors.\r\n \r\nJim Spangler was congratulated for more achievements by his son Nick.\r\n \r\nHal Taylor reported meeting past member Hugh Holden and abalone diving in Mendocino. Hugh is keeping fit as Fire Chief in Ashland, Oregon.  Hal also announced that we have 10 students going this year to RYLA.\r\n \r\nTom Myers called for volunteers to get together after this meeting to plan arrangements for the Kickout at Michael&rsquo;s on June 24.  The cost will be $55.00 each and this is a mandatory meeting \r\n\r\nJim Spangler introduced recipients  of our Community Awards and spoke of the useful work done in our local area. Representatives of organizations were guests at the meeting to receive checks:-\r\n \r\nFriends of Deer Hollow Farm:- $350.00   Joan Lewis spoke of the Educational Programs and Scholarships  which are supported by our donation. The Farm has been open now for 18 years. Joan shared letters from some of the 2500 students who have visited it in the last year.\r\n \r\nFriends of Stevens Creek Trail:- $250.00   Greg Unangst explained that the award helps to make people aware of the trail and its benefits. Already 20 years since plans were started, it extends now from the Bay through Mountain View to a Bridge over Hiway 85 which will be officially opened on Saturday. Another new bridge over 101 beside Permanente Creek will connect Shoreline to Middlefield Road and Crittenden School.\r\nMore studies and plans aim ultimately to make the trail go from the Bay to Skyline.\r\n \r\nHope Services:- $1862.00   Suanne Rinta described how this organization provides employment for clients. For 60 years they have had trucks picking up clothing and other items that can be usefully worked over. They now re-cycle E-waste and have tent screening outside for space to work on the mattresses.\r\n \r\nJust Read:- $2500 Alison Kibrick, President of the Board of Jost Read, told of the direct impact of their program on students needing help with elementary literacy and mathematics to bring them up to grade. Volunteers work in a structured program integrated into school schedules. She is grateful for our donation and for all volunteers.\r\n \r\nNext week Community Awards will be given to CHAC, CSA, Mountain View Educational Foundation and Partners for a New Generation.\r\n \r\nThe Three-fer person is scheduled to be Monique Kane.",
