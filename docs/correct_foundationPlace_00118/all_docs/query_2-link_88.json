        "text": "We are excited that you are looking at our new MAHEC Internal Medicine Residency Program as a potential site for your future training.\n\nMountain Area Health Education Center (MAHEC) has a long history of excellence in graduate medical education training and we are thrilled to join their family of residency programs. We will build on the longstanding successes by working with the MAHEC organization, our talented faculty, our engaged community and our residents to build one of the most unique internal medicine training programs in the nation. Our goal is to train the well-rounded internist in a supportive yet challenging environment in which one develops not only as a physician but as a leader and teacher in our community.\n\nInnovation\n\nOur very experienced leadership team consists of physician educators with track records in medical education innovation. Our forward-thinking curriculum balances optimal training in the largest Area Health Education Center in North Carolina with training in a busy, tertiary care, state-of-the-art hospital system. In these and other settings we are able to emphasize training in the delivery of rural care, the reduction of health disparities, the care of the older patient, community-based care and the care of special populations such as patients with substance use disorders. We also provide training experiences in all specialties of internal medicine through our fantastic partnership with Mission Hospital, where our residents will care for patients on medicine services, ICUs, cardiology services, specialty consultation services and in the emergency department. Unique rural-based rotations, public health opportunities, and scholarship experiences provide additional learner-centered, mission-focused training experiences. These skills are practiced and reinforced in our core seminars, which take place in our large, state-of-the-art simulation center in our weekly academic half day.\n\nCommunity\n\nOne of the core values of our program is service to community. We are committed to responding to the needs of our community and the region in which we live. Residents and faculty teach and learn together in a collaborative learning community, all with the aim of providing improved care of the population we serve. The curriculum includes experiences that put you in the heart of the communities of Western North Carolina as well as opportunities to play a role in the reduction of health care disparities in the region. We expect our trainees to lead and teach in our community.\n\nWell-Being\n\nWe created a program that will challenge you to become your best self as an internist over three years of training. We also focused on creating a supportive environment that fosters your development and allows flexibility so that you succeed in your personal and professional goals. The schedules and curricula are designed to provide you with the training that you need AND to ensure that you have time to focus on your wellbeing and your personal interests. We incorporated specific resilience training, reflection opportunities, and wellbeing experiences. You are a valued colleague; we will grow together as we learn how to balance professional commitment and personal growth.\n\nIt's an honor that you are considering training with us, and we're excited to meet you. Come and explore the education we offer, the values we share, and how we can help you develop into the physician leader of the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nStephanie Call, MD, MSPH\n\nInternal Medicine Residency Program Director\n\nIM@mahec.net\n\n828-407-2415\n\nContact\n\nBeth Roe\n\nInternal Medicine Residency Program Administrator\n\nIM@mahec.net\n\n828-771-3544\n\nStephanie Frady\n\nInternal Medicine Residency Program Coordinator\n\nIM@mahec.net\n\n828-771-3550\n\nJenna Joyner, BS\n\nInternal Medicine Residency Program Coordinator\n\nIM@mahec.net\n\n828-257-2985\n\nImportant\n\nThis contact information is not for patient use.

We actively recruit physicians, staff, and students from underrepresented minorities, and we strive to implement policies and procedures that value and support diverse backgrounds and experiences. MAHEC does not discriminate on the basis of socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, spiritual practice, geography, disability, or age.\n\nMission Statement\n\nOur Internal Medicine Residency Program aims to train and educate diverse, well-rounded, competent, caring, compassionate physician leaders who:\n\nDeliver the highest quality medical care to patients in a variety of settings including rural communities\n\nCreate a collaborative setting for innovation, intellectual and personal growth and interprofessional work\n\nContribute to the science and art of medicine and medical education through innovation, scholarship and dissemination\n\nProvide expertise in caring for underserved patients and populations\n\nLead and foster change in healthcare delivery and health systems, including improving quality, safety, diversity in the workforce, and access\n\nCelebrate lifelong learning in our rapidly changing healthcare environment\n\nValues Statement\n\nExcellence: We deliver quality activities and services that our customers and partners value.\n\nDiversity: We promote equity and inclusivity.\n\nIntegrity: We act with fairness, transparency, and the highest level of ethics.\n\nCollaboration: We value partnerships and support interprofessional approaches.\n\nImprovement: We continuously innovate and improve our work.\n\nFoundational Principles\n\nCivility: We treat all people with respect and kindness, all the time.\n\nInclusivity: We value the contribution of people different than ourselves and the merits of an organization that reflects differences in our teams and our community.\n\nEmpowerment: We value engagement, commitment, and ownership of MAHEC’s mission, work, and budget.\n\nGeneral Curriculum Structure\n\nOur program is designed in a competency-based advancement structure. Individuals are continuously observed, assessed and provided with feedback in all experiences. Goal-setting is based on Internal Medicine milestones. Once an individual achieves competency in a goal, they set new goals and are advanced in their level of responsibility. As such, we use a competency-based language to define stages of development rather than a time-based language. Our learners move through phases of development - from Learner (PGY1 year) to Manager (usually end of PGY1 year into PGY2 year) to Teacher/Leader (usually mid PGY2 year to end of training). The stages are defined below.\n\nLearner - In the learner phase of training, an individual works under close supervision and coaching to achieve basic milestones in Internal Medicine. We use a deliberate practice model in which learners set milestone based goals, work to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes with direct observation and feedback from faculty, seniors and team members, and then based on feedback, set new goals. Supervisors are trained in \"supervised autonomy\" as a principle so that learners are not \"directed\" but coached to grow.\n\nManager - Once a learner reaches competency in all learner-level milestones, they advance to the manager phase of training. In this phase, one works to establish independence in the management of common Internal Medicine ambulatory and inpatient patient presentations. Our managers do not supervise learners, nor are they supervised by upper level residents. They work collaboratively on manager-level rotations with attending physicians to establish competence. Residents consider this the most challenging and most rewarding phase of training as they truly grow into clinical independence in this phase.\n\nTeacher/Leader - Once a manager is considered independent in managing most common medical conditions, they advance to the teacher/leader phase of training. In this phase, they continue to gain the necessary experience over time in managing many medical conditions and they work on teaching and leadership skills. Their milestones during this phase are worded as phrases such as \"can teach others...\", \"leads a healthcare team\", \"coordinates care across...\", \"role models for others...\". It is in this level of training that our residents lead teams on the wards, in the ICUs, specialize in consultative care and serve in advanced roles in the ambulatory practice setting.\n\nSchedule Structure\n\nOur unique tandem block schedule was designed by residents and studied in an Internal Medicine residency. The schedule was created with the following goals in mind:\n\nSeparate inpatient/ambulatory responsibilities with dedicated curricula\n\nContinuity in continuity clinic\n\nExcellent coverage for continuity patient panel when on inpatient\n\nKeeping inpatient teams together for evaluation, teamwork purposes\n\nMaintaining four-week experiences for learning purposes\n\nThe tandem block schedule pairs four-week direct patient care inpatient experiences (wards/icu/specialty services - designated as \"I\" in schematic below) with other experiences (ambulatory, consults, research, electives - designated as A) in an alternating eight-week block schedule. The \"A\" designation indicates that the resident has continuity clinic three ½ days per week during that rotation. The residents are partnered together in practice partnerships so that one of the partners is always in clinic that week and manages outpatient responsibilities for the patient panels during that time. Residents do not have clinic during \"I\" blocks.\n\nThe schematic below represents two residents’ schedules for the first 16 weeks of a year. Each column is two weeks. John and Stacey are clinic partners. They are in clinic 3 ½ days per week on A blocks.\n\nBlock Number (each block is two weeks)\n\nResident 1A 1B 2A 2B 3A 3B 4A 4B John ICU (I) Pulm (A) ICU (I) Pulm (A) Wards (I) Amb (A) Wards (I) Amb (A) Stacey Geri (A) Wards (I) Geri (A) Wards (I) Amb (A) Cards (I) Amb (I) Cards (I)\n\nRotations: Learner Phase Weeks Location General Internal Medicine Wards 12 weeks Mission Hospital Medical ICU 4 weeks Mission Hospital Night Medicine 4 weeks Mission Hospital Emergency Medicine 4 weeks Mission (other) Ambulatory Block 4-6 weeks MAHEC Geriatrics - Ambulatory 4 weeks Multiple Sites Rural Health 2 weeks Multiple Sites Hematology/Oncology - Ambulatory 2 weeks Messino Cancer Neurology - Ambulatory 4 weeks Asheville Neuro Dermatology 2 weeks Multiple Sites Cardiology Consults 4 weeks Mission Hospital Infectious Disease Consults 2 weeks Mission Hospital Elective 4 weeks Multiple Sites\n\nRotations: Manager Phase Weeks Location General Internal Medicine Wards 8 weeks Mission Hospital Nephrology Inpatient Consults 4 weeks Mission Hospital VA General Inpatient 4 weeks VA Hospital Night Medicine - ICU 4 weeks Mission Hospital CCU 4 weeks Mission Hospital Rural Health - Immersion 4 weeks Cherokee Health Endocrinology - Ambulatory 4 weeks MAHEC Rheumatology - Ambulatory 4 weeks Asheville Rheumatology Social Medicine 4 weeks MAHEC and partners Procedure/Ultrasound 2 weeks Mission Hospital and MAHEC Individualized Rotations (electives/scholarship) 10 weeks MAHEC +\n\nRotations: Leader Phase Weeks Location General Internal Medicine Wards 8 weeks Mission Hospital Cardiology 4 weeks Mission Hospital Medical ICU 4 weeks Mission Hospital Night Medicine 4 weeks Mission Hospital General Medicine Co-management/Consult 2 weeks Mission Hospital Gastroenterology/Hepatology 4 weeks Mission Hospital QSW Rotation 2 weeks Mission Hospital and MAHEC Palliative Care - Individualized 2 weeks Four Seasons, VA, and Mission Hospital Infectious Diseases - Individualized 2 weeks Mission Hospital + Transition to Practice - Individualized 4 weeks Mission Hospital and MAHEC Electives - Individualized 14 weeks Mission Hospital and MAHEC\n\nElectives\n\nCardiology - ambulatory, consult, cardiac testing/imaging\n\nDermatology\n\nEmergency Medicine\n\nEndocrinology\n\nGastroenterology/Hepatology - ambulatory, consults\n\nGeriatrics – ambulatory, nursing home care, home visits\n\nHematology/Oncology\n\nHIV - ambulatory\n\nInfectious Disease - ambulatory\n\nInformation Technology\n\nInternational Health\n\nLifestyle Medicine\n\nNephrology - ambulatory, dialysis, consults\n\nNeurology - ambulatory, consults, inpatient\n\nOphthalmology\n\nOtolaryngology\n\nPalliative Care, Hospice Medicine\n\nPulmonary - ambulatory, consults, sleep\n\nPsychiatry\n\nQuality Improvement Project\n\nRadiology\n\nRehabilitation Medicine\n\nResearch/Scholarship\n\nRheumatology - ambulatory\n\nRural Health\n\nSports Medicine\n\nUNC Electives\n\nLongitudinal Curricula\n\nAdvocacy, Policy\n\nBusiness of Medicine\n\nCareer Planning and Advising\n\nClinical Reasoning\n\nCommunication Skills\n\nEBM and High-value Care\n\nLeadership\n\nPhysical Examination Skills\n\nPrimary Care\n\nProcedure and POCUS\n\nQuality and Safety\n\nResident as Teacher\n\nScholarship\n\nSocial Medicine\n\nWellbeing\n\nLeadership\n\nConferences\n\nTime Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday 7:30 am Ambulatory MR Ambulatory MR (Journal Club) Ambulatory MR Ambulatory MR (Lifestyle Medicine) 11:45 am Inpatient MR Inpatient MR Noon - Grand Rounds (UNC) Inpatient MR (M&M) Afternoon Academic Half Day (Active Learning)\n\nFaculty\n\nNathan “Nate” Spell, MD\n\nChair, Internal Medicine\n\nPronouns: he/him/his\n\nUndergraduate: Davidson College\n\nMedical School: Harvard\n\nResidency: Brigham and Women’s Hospital\n\nProfessor Emeritus: Emory University School of Medicine\n\nDr. Nathan Spell served 4 years in the U.S. Air Force Medical Corps immediately after residency and then joined the department of medicine at Emory University as a general internist. In his 25 years at Emory, he held several education leadership roles—resident clinic director in his ambulatory practice, then associate program director, and ultimately associate dean for education and professional development, including oversight of CME (Continuing Medical Education). He held administrative positions as medical director of his practice and 10 years as Chief Quality Officer for Emory University Hospital, including starting the Emory Quality Academy for professional development in quality improvement. He joined MAHEC in August 2023 as department chair.\n\nMy professional passions are in the growth and development of physicians, interprofessional education, quality and safety, and addressing professional and health disparities. I was attracted to MAHEC because of how well the role of chair fits my experience and because of the infectious passion for the mission among everyone I’ve met here. My outlets are mountain trail running and spending weekends planning, shopping, and cooking meals for family and friends.\n\nStephanie Call, MD, MSPH\n\nInternal Medicine Residency Program Director\n\nPronouns: she/her/hers\n\nUndergraduate: University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Medical School: University of Maryland at Baltimore Internship: Internal Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham Residency: Internal Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham Chief Resident: Internal Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham Fellowship: General Internal Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham Past faculty appointments: University of Alabama at Birmingham (Associate Program Director) University of Louisville (Associate Program Director) Virginia Commonwealth University (Program Director, Associate Chair)\n\nDr. Stephanie Call was recruited to start the Internal Medicine Training Program at MAHEC in the fall of 2019.

I am passionate about what I do. I love teaching, I love serving people, and I love working with others to develop innovative approaches to clinical care and clinical teaching. I also love the mountains and the region of Western North Carolina where I have had a home for over 10years. As I was working to determine my ‘next steps’ in my career, serendipity stepped in and presented a unique opportunity for me in joining MAHEC to build this program. At risk of sounding like a cliché, it was a bit ‘magical’. I feel so fortunate to have this opportunity.\n\nI could not be more excited to partner with the MAHEC organization, the community, the talented faculty members, and the trainees in creating a unique program designed to train well-rounded internists that are focused on serving their community as physicians, leaders and teachers.\n\nI have been hiking, kayaking and traveling in Western North Carolina for years. I am excited to make Asheville my true home base for travel and adventure. When I am not here, you can find me traveling with my husband and my three girls … we will usually be in a National Park or overseas!\n\nNancy Kubiak, MD, FACP\n\nInternal Medicine Residency Associate Program Director\n\nInternal Medicine Medical Director\n\nPronouns: she/her/hers\n\nUndergraduate: Texas A&M University Medical School: Baylor University, College of Medicine Internship: Internal Medicine, Primary Care, University of Colorado Residency: Internal Medicine, University of Mississippi Chief Resident: Internal Medicine, University of Mississippi Past faculty appointments: University of Louisville (Associate Program Director, Medical Director)\n\nDr. Nancy Kubiak has a long history of involvement in graduate medical education in Internal Medicine, having served as an Associate Program Director and as the director of an Internal Medicine Resident and Fellow Outpatient Practice. She has been repeatedly recognized for teaching excellence by her past institutions and trainees, and led curricular innovations in both primary care and in the foundations of quality improvement. She is joining MAHEC as an experienced educator, associate program director and medical clinical director.\n\nIt seems like my whole life has been preparing me for this opportunity to come to Asheville and work with our new internal medicine residency. I have always loved outpatient medicine and resident education. I am excited to use my experience to create a great outpatient practice for learning and patient care in a way that prepares residents to become excellent, well rounded internists.\n\nI love learning alongside residents and other professionals and working in teams to create opportunities to learn internal medicine, quality improvement, and patient care that improve outcomes in learners and in patients. One of the reasons I chose to come to MAHEC was the singular focus on their mission. Everyone focuses on preparing the next generation of excellent physicians to provide exceptional primary care to every individual, no matter what his or her circumstances may be. My career has been spent working to improve care of the underserved. I was thrilled to find a vibrant, thoughtful, and excellent organization that shared those goals, and honored that they chose to hire me for this position.\n\nMy husband, Alan and I are proud of our sons Mark and Scott and look forward to exploring Western North Carolina. We love traveling and our high energy dogs, Lola and Jake.

I was thrilled to be invited to be a part of the teaching faculty for the MAHEC family medicine residents about a year after arriving. Since then, my weeks with the residents are truly my happiest in the hospital.\n\nI love being a part of resident growth - watching physicians grow over the years from somewhat timid interns to confident third years ready to practice independently. Knowing that I might have played a small part in that journey brings me such joy.\n\nThere is so much more to the practice of medicine than the actual science. I believe that is the easy part. It is learning how to practice the art of medicine, taking care of the entire patient, their families and understanding all of the additional facets of patient care.\n\nI am so excited for this new adventure with MAHEC! I have been waiting for this opportunity to come to WNC since I arrived and cannot think of a better organization to partner with to help educate the next generation of internal medicine physicians.\n\nOn a personal note I have two children, Ellie and Brooks, that have loved growing up in WNC where my parents are also located. Although we love to travel at every opportunity we can, they especially love going to visit NYC to visit my grandmother. Our home is full of puppy love with our two Great Danes, Annie and Scooby. I can be found on the trails on my off days training for my next adventure.\n\nCaroline Mueller, MD, MEd, FACP, FAAP\n\nInternal Medicine Residency Associate Program Director\n\nPronouns: she/her/hers\n\nUndergraduate: University of Illinois Medical School: University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine Residency: Internal Medicine-Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center Master's Degree in Education: University of Cincinnati and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Past faculty appointments: Professor of Medicine, University of Cincinnati Program Director of the Combined Internal Medicine and Pediatrics Residency Program in Cincinnati Program Director of the Combined Internal Medicine and Pediatrics Residency Program in Cincinnati\n\nFor 30 years Dr. Caroline Mueller has been a primary care physician, and her goal was nurturing residents in their knowledge, skills, and relationships with patients over their years of training in both the ambulatory and inpatient settings. She was the first resident to train as a med-peds resident at the program in Cincinnati, so she knows what is involved to be a resident who is blazing trails. She was the Program Director for the Combined Internal Medicine-Pediatrics residency for many years, during which time the residency became one of the most successful in the country, but it was the opportunity to provide a challenging yet secure training environment that motivated her most. To be able to say \"I have your back\" to young physicians who are pushing themselves to be their best is a great honor. Other roles included ward team attending, student clinic attending, and humanism in medicine preceptor.\n\nThe Internal Medicine Residency at MAHEC is an amazing opportunity for all of us! It is rare to have the chance to build something that will last for generations to come, and impact thousands of lives for the better. MAHEC is an ideal place for this to happen as they have created quite a few training programs, and all of them have been very successful. Their approach is inclusive, caring, dedicated and open. These are people who deeply care for their community and the patients they serve. It is an honor to be able to join them in the endeavor.\n\nOutside of work, I love all things natural including wild spaces, gardens, plants, mountains, streams. I enjoy hiking, running, kayaking, biking and my dogs.\n\nMaroun Aboutayeh, MD\n\nInternal Medicine Community Faculty, Procedures\n\nPronouns: he/him/his\n\nUndergraduate: University of Florida Medical School: LECOM- Bradenton Residency: Northside Hospital/ USF Morsani College of Medicine\n\nI was born and raised in Florida. As an avid climber and hiker, I knew he could not stay in the pancake state forever. Throughout my training I gravitated towards critically ill patients requiring acute interventions. After graduating residency, I was given an opportunity to start my career somewhere with both a high acuity and opportunity to teach.\n\nI started my career at Mission with a certain mindset. Internists should be able to manage any situation thrown at them. I am excited to be creating the procedural curriculum here at MAHEC. I feel residents should be trained to provide a comprehensive set of services when treating patients, whether that be with medications, diagnostic ultrasound, or procedures.\n\nI have a variety of hobbies but primarily I’ve been focusing my energy on learning to climb. I’ve been slowly making my way out of the gym onto the crag and have found much growth facing my fears.\n\nRobert F.

I have been able to enjoy the region with trail running and backpacking and was fortunate to be the Scoutmaster of Troop 72 in Skyland for five years. I recently completed my master's degree in history at Western Carolina University and hope to begin my second career in undergraduate history education over the next few years. We enjoy having residents come to our office to help build their confidence in neurologic exam and diagnosis and hopefully build relationships for the long term as they settle into practice in the mountains.\n\nRebecca Bernstein, MD\n\nInternal Medicine\n\nInternal Medicine Core Faculty\n\nPronouns: she/her/hers\n\nUndergraduate: Indiana University Medical School: New York Medical College Residency: Montefiore Medical Center, Primary Care and Social Medicine\n\nSince 2008, I have worked in WNC as an internal medicine hospitalist. I have been involved in teaching MAHEC residents from all programs on the inpatient teaching service. Over the years, I served as medical director of the inpatient diabetes program creating a unique team of providers caring for patients with inpatient hyperglycemia and diabetes. I also served as the chairperson of the Mission Health Diversity Committee from 2011-2015, educating healthcare workers on implicit bias and identifying local healthcare disparities.\n\nWorking at MAHEC has given me the chance to teach in the clinical setting as well as speak at conferences and mentor the students in the MAHEC Medical Mentoring Program. MAHEC’s philosophy on education and community involvement is outstanding. Their commitment to health disparities is an important part of healthcare. I am currently serving as the co-chair of the MAHEC GME DEI committee where we are focused on holistic recruiting, supporting URiM residents, and educating on health disparities and vulnerable populations.\n\nI am immensely grateful for the opportunity to teach internal medicine residents in MAHEC’s new residency. Acting as teaching faculty not only contributes to the future of medicine but also makes me a better clinician. I am grateful for the challenge to build a successful internal medicine residency that will serve WNC for years to come.\n\nI am a big fan of hobbies when I have the time. I love to play guitar, bake, make kombucha, sew, and garden. I live with my son, dog, and two small tiger kitties. We enjoy hiking, camping, and just sitting around a fire pit with friends and family.\n\nRhoda Brosnan, MD\n\nSpecialty Core Faculty, Cardiology\n\nPronouns: she/her/hers\n\nUndergraduate: University of Virginia Medical School: Med University of South Carolina Internship: University of Texas Southwestern Residency: University of Texas Southwestern Chief Residency: University of Texas Southwestern Fellowship: Duke University, Cardiology Faculty Appointments: University of North Carolina School of Medicine\n\nCardiology exposure during Internal Medicine training is critically important. Asheville Cardiology Associates is a large subspecialty practice that provides the only tertiary Cardiology care for a large portion of Western North Carolina. We see an incredible array of pathology and are fortunate enough to have access to advanced imaging and procedural technology to care for them locally. We have always tried to maintain an academic feel to our practice. Case Presentations and Cardiology Grand Rounds occur every Tuesday and we have an active Research program in addition to our busy practice. My partners come from training programs all over the country to practice at ACA and in the Mountains of Western NC. IM training has been a missing piece. We are excited to add that to our model and look forward to having Interns and Residents on Rounds and in Conference.\n\nRick Bunio, MD\n\nExecutive Clinical Director, Cherokee Indian Hospital\n\nPronouns: he/him/his\n\nUndergraduate: University of Winnipeg\n\nMedical School: University of Manitoba\n\nResidency: Foothills Hospital, Calgary, Alberta\n\nDr. Bunio began his medical career at the University of Manitoba where he was one of two medical students selected to complete 1st year pathology residency between his 2nd and 3rd years of medical school. After graduation, he completed his family medicine residency at Foothills Hospital in Calgary, Alberta, during the 1988 Winter Olympics. He ran a successful private practice for many years before exploring family medicine in such diverse locations as Canada’s arctic circle, Saudi Arabia, and St. Lucia before settling in Western North Carolina where he has worked for the Cherokee Indian Health Authority for the past 25 years. He was appointed the Clinical Director for the hospital in 2017 and subsequently assumed the additional roles of Medical Director for Tribal Public Health and Human Services and the Medical Director for the Tribal Option Medicaid program, the first Native American Managed Care entity in the country. He is passionate about Quality and Performance Improvement and leads a number of Quality Improvement initiatives in Cherokee every year.\n\nI feel blessed to work with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and am eternally grateful that MAHEC Internal Medicine Residents get to spend time here. Not only do we learn a great deal from these bright minds but we have the chance to share the nuances of Cherokee and AI/AN culture benefits with all of our patients no matter where the residents choose to continue their careers. The Tribal Health System is particularly nourishing for my soul coming from another Universal Health System in Canada. Also, the value we place on continuous quality improvement is perfectly aligned with MAHEC and I look forward to our collaboration for many years to come. When not brainstorming over quality initiatives, I enjoy cooking, reading, brewing, and curling.\n\nBrian England, MD\n\nSpecialty Core Faculty, Nephrology\n\nPronouns: he/him/his\n\nUndergraduate: University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Medical School: University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Residency: Internal Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA Chief Resident: Internal Medicine, Emory Hospital, Atlanta, GA Nephrology Fellowship: Emory University, Atlanta, GA Past Faculty Appointments: Associate Professor of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA\n\nI joined Mountain Kidney and Hypertension in 1996. The physicians and advanced practitioners of MKHA provide comprehensive nephrology care in offices, dialysis clinics and/or hospitals in 11 Western North Carolina counties.\n\nI am grateful for the opportunity to work with the MAHEC Internal Medicine Residents and hope to share my enthusiasm for the privilege to serve patients with challenging and complicated illnesses.\n\nMy wife and I have spent more than 35 years raising 3 young men, hiking, camping and now tending the vegetables, fruit trees and flowers on our farm.\n\nTaylor Fie, MD, MPH\n\nInternal Medicine Core Faculty\n\nPronouns: she/her/hers\n\nUndergraduate: Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, NC\n\nMedical School: UNC Chapel Hill\n\nMPH: UNC Chapel Hill\n\nInternships: University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA\n\nResidency: University of Virginia\n\nI was born and raised just one county over in Clyde, so moving back to Western North Carolina was in a literal sense “coming home.” In my time at MAHEC, I’ve immensely enjoyed meeting new patients, working with our fantastic group of residents, and soaking up some of the clinical wisdom and mentorship coming from my colleagues who have years of practice and experience. Primary care is my passion—being the first person that patients come to, having the opportunity to advocate for them, and helping them navigate our complex medical system is challenging but so incredibly rewarding.\n\nI enjoy working with our students as the UNC School of Medicine site director for Internal Medicine. I also run our procedure clinic where we perform a host of dermatologic and musculoskeletal procedures. Within the realm of doctoring, my interests lie in improving health disparities in rural communities and training future doctors to thrive in caring for underserved populations. Outside of medicine, I love to travel—hopefully, one day, I will make it to all seven continents—and, of course, hiking as many trails as I can find in Western North Carolina.\n\nMichael Gower, MD, PhD\n\nInternal Medicine Core Faculty\n\nPronouns: he/him/his\n\nUndergraduate: University of Georgia, BS in Psychology Graduate School: University of Alabama at Birmingham, MA/PhD in Developmental Psychology Medical School: Mercer University, Macon Campus Internship: Internal Medicine/Pediatrics, Virginia Commonwealth University Residency: Internal Medicine/Pediatrics, Virginia Commonwealth University Chief Residency: Internal Medicine/Pediatrics, Virginia Commonwealth University\n\nI have been involved in academics my entire life in one form or another. After college, I spent 6 years in Birmingham as a developmental psychologist, teaching statistics, and doing research on cognitive development in children on the autism spectrum. I switched things up in 2013 and moved to Macon for medical school, after which I had the great privilege of completing my Med-Peds training at VCU from 2017-2021.\n\nShortly after residency I moved to Asheville and took a job as a hospitalist at Mission, primarily to have the opportunity to work with the IM residents and be part of the exciting early years of this residency program. I am looking forward to watching the residents grow and develop their skills over the years here.\n\nIn my free time, I love doing anything outdoors, including camping, hiking, and swimming with my incredible wife and our two dogs. I love to travel when I can (and public health considerations allow), and I am actively trying to visit as many of the great restaurants and breweries in Asheville as possible!\n\nDaniel Gutman, MD\n\nSpecialty Core Faculty, Pulmonary and Critical Care\n\nPronouns: he/him/his\n\nMedical School: Drexel University College of Medicine\n\nResidency: University of Illinois – Chicago\n\nFellowship: Brown University\n\nI joined Asheville Pulmonary Associates in 2018 after moving to the area post training. As part of the practice, I take care of outpatient pulmonary and sleep medicine patients as well as round in our medical ICUs at Mission Hospital. I am excited to coordinate the ICU rotation for the internal medicine residency program. The ICU experience is an essential aspect of inpatient medicine training with a great breadth of pathology. It allows trainees to really focus on each patient’s medical pathology in detail and build relationships with patients and families to develop appropriate treatment strategies.\n\nLike many other people attracted to this area, I like to get outdoors in my free time exploring the nearby mountains while running or biking.\n\nBen Hulkower, MD\n\nInternal Medicine Core Faculty\n\nPronouns: he/him/his\n\nUndergraduate: BS in Biology at UNC-Chapel Hill\n\nMedical School: Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University\n\nResidency: Indiana University School of Medicine, Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics\n\nChief Residency: Indiana University School of Medicine, Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics\n\nDr. Hulkower serves as Core Faculty for the MAHEC Internal Medicine Residency Program, as Course Director for the Internal Medicine Acting Internship for the Asheville Campus of the UNC School of Medicine, and as Medical Director for the Mission Hospital Diabetes Management Team.\n\nIn 2017, I had the privilege of moving back to Asheville with our growing family to work at Mission Hospital as a Hospitalist, where I have thoroughly enjoyed working as an attending on the inpatient medicine teaching service with MAHEC residents. My clinical philosophy is focused on providing high-quality clinical care while also coordinating resources to help address the social determinants of health to improve long-term health outcomes for our patients and the community. Evidence-based patient care and teaching are at the center of everything we do at MAHEC. Internal Medicine residents training here have a unique opportunity to learn from world-class educators at an academic center with state-of-the-art facilities yet still maintain the comfort and support typically associated with smaller community-based residency programs. I enjoy working with residents because of their eagerness to learn and willingness to put themselves out there and ask great questions. This allows me to teach core concepts of medicine that I hope will last a lifetime. Quite frequently, I am challenged to refresh my own medical knowledge and to stay up-to-date with the most recent medical literature. Working with residents makes me a better and more well-rounded physician. Asheville has an amazing combination of access to outdoor activities as well as world-class restaurants, art studios, and music venues, not to mention the opportunity to work in a nationally recognized health system. My hobbies include soccer, hiking, playing with my kids, and a great deal of dad jokes.\n\nBrian Johnson, MD\n\nInternal Medicine Core Faculty\n\nPronouns: he/him/his\n\nUndergraduate: Rhodes College, Memphis TN Graduate: University of Tennessee, Memphis Internship: Internal Medicine, University of Utah, SLC Residency: Internal Medicine, University of Utah, SLC Chief Resident: Internal Medicine, University of Utah, SLC\n\nI knew I wanted to be a career Hospitalist while on my very first inpatient teaching rotation while in medical school. I have always enjoyed learning together the practice of Internal Medicine, whether it be on teaching rounds or in an interactive classroom setting. I reluctantly left that warm teaching atmosphere and came to Asheville NC in order to be closer my family, because of the strong reputation of Mission Hospital and its staff, and for the many recreational and life opportunities that WNC has to offer.\n\nMy perfect day outside of the hospital starts with a cool morning trail run to a trout-filled mountain stream and ends sharing a craft beer, food truck meal and bluegrass band with family or friends. Now I am very excited that my perfect day in the hospital will again include the wonderful opportunity to share my 10+ years of experience in Hospital Medicine with eager Internal Medicine interns and residents.\n\nCarissa Lau-Julien, MD\n\nMedical Director, Givens Estates\n\nSpecialty Core Faculty, Geriatrics\n\nPronouns: she/her/hers\n\nUndergraduate: Walla Walla University Medical School: Loma Linda University Residency: Internal Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham Fellowship: Geriatrics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nAfter residency, Dr. Lau-Julien subspecialized in geriatrics. Her interests include whole-person care, complex medical-psychosocial situations, care transitions, and collaborative interprofessional care. She is excited to be living her dream of being an educator and enjoys the mutual learning that comes with working with resident physicians. Having learners on the team pushes every person to be intentional in their choices and interactions, and patient care is better for it. When not at work, you can find her making new (vegetarian) recipes in the kitchen or hiking to favorite picnic spots on the Blue Ridge with her husband.\n\nSchuyler Livingston, MD\n\nInternal Medicine Faculty Physician\n\nPronouns: he/him/his\n\nUndergraduate: Amherst College Medical School: Emory University School of Medicine Residency: University of Colorado Internal Medicine Residency, Primary Care Track Past Faculty Appointments: Assistant Professor, Emory University School of Medicine at Grady Memorial Hospital and the Grady Infectious Disease Program (IDP)\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Livingston has sought to be an empowered generalist connecting underserved patients to the highest quality care.

In addition, he served as Regional Director of Informatics, facilitating changes to the EHR to improve patient safety and provider efficiency. Dr. Livingston’s experience in urban settings parallels the challenging environment that physicians often face in rural settings. He looks forward to training the next generation of physicians, and facilitating their growth to become excellent clinicians and true advocates for their patients.\n\nI was traveling with my family for fall break in Asheville, when we drove past the MAHEC clinic facilities. After working in full time clinical practice for several years, I had been looking for an opportunity to get back to clinical teaching. As an avid hiker and trail runner, I was thrilled to find a new program in such a beautiful location. My wife and I cannot wait to explore the many trails and peaks in western North Carolina.

His work has focused on advocating for the rights of LGBT individuals, particularly those of trans youth within schools and within the healthcare system. He was drawn to MAHEC because of their mission to serve underserved populations. Having grown up in a rural community himself, Jorgen believes that everyone should have access to quality care regardless of where they live. He believes that LGBT people should feel safe to exist in all spaces and communities, urban and rural. Being from Utah, he is passionate about hiking and spending time outdoors. He was drawn to Asheville for the natural beauty and the welcoming inclusivity that is felt throughout.

I spend most of my free time with my wife and five kids, exploring the natural beauty and great restaurants and breweries that Asheville has to offer.\n\nStephen Weinrib, MD\n\nSubspecialty Education Coordinator, Endocrinology\n\nUndergraduate: Northwestern University, Evanston, IL\n\nMedical School: University of Alabama School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL\n\nResidency: George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC\n\nPast Faculty Appointments: Mountain Diabetes & Endocrine Center\n\nSpecialty: Endocrinology\n\nDr. Weinrib has practiced general adult endocrinology in Asheville since 2002, after first practicing in his hometown of Montgomery, AL, for five years. He has long taught healthcare professionals-in-training, given professional lectures and community talks, conducted clinical research, and provided endocrine care for the uninsured in Buncombe (ABCCM), Henderson, and Polk (The Free Clinics) counties over the last two decades.

He looks forward to expanding MAHEC’s endocrine services across WNC through partnerships, technology, and innovation.\n\nTrue to my background as a history major in college, I enjoy reading about seminal people and events that have shaped our world, as well as about current events, art, and nature. In my spare time, I grow cacti and create new ice cream/sorbet flavors, often with a hint of pepper. Along with my wife, daughter, and dog, I’m happy to go hiking through the woods in WNC, explore the atmospheric streets of Asheville, or check out a local favorite restaurant while traveling.\n\nCasey Wells, PharmD\n\nClinical Pharmacist\n\nCasey Wells' passion for helping to manage chronic conditions for vulnerable patient populations began with foundational experiences at a small-town community pharmacy and an Internal Medicine Clinic. She completed two years of pharmacy residency at MAHEC focused on serving rural and underserved patients in Western North Carolina. Currently, Casey works in the MAHEC Internal Medicine and Endocrinology clinic with a primary focus on diabetes and technology.

Whitehouse, MD, MHS\n\nSpecialty Core Faculty, Infectious Diseases\n\nPronouns: he/him/his\n\nUndergraduate: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chemistry and Math Medical School: Emory University School of Medicine Internships/Residency: Internal Medicine, Duke University Medical Center Fellowship: Infectious Disease and International Health, Duke University Medical Center\n\nMasters of Health Sciences: Duke University, 2002\n\nAlthough he was born in Madrid, Spain, and raised in the South Pacific (Kwajalein, Marshall Island), Dr. Whitehouse is a long-term resident of North Carolina who has been fortunate to call Asheville home since 1999. Mission ID has provided him with the perfect practice opportunity with a wide variety of inpatient and outpatient infectious diseases as well as the continuity of HIV care and the excitement of Travel and Tropical medicine. MAHEC, Mission, Asheville, and WNC provide an ideal medical environment and community for training as well as the perfect city and mountains to live in.\n\nInfectious diseases and Infection Prevention are two of my great passions. However, I love to make ample time for golfing, landscaping, hiking, driving down back scenic country roads, and listening to books and podcasts. Asheville has been the ideal place to raise two boys who equally cherish the sunrises over Looking Glass Rock, the Peregrine falcons at Devils Courthouse, and the sunsets at Craggy Gardens.\n\nResidents PGY3\n\nNicole “Nikki” Abello, DO\n\nEdward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Carolinas Campus\n\nHello everyone! My name is Nikki Abello and I am so excited to join the MAHEC Internal Medicine team. I grew up in Sarasota, FL and then went to Tulane University for undergraduate and majored in Neuroscience with a minor in Spanish. After graduating I went to work as a Medical Scribe in Miami, FL and became passionate about pursuing a career in medicine and helping underserved populations. I attended VCOM in Spartanburg, SC for medical school and was lucky enough to call Asheville my home for my last two years of medical school since my clinical rotations were here. I am very thrilled to get to serve the Asheville community and learn from such passionate and caring faculty. My interests include pulmonology/critical care and palliative care. In my free time, I enjoy running, tennis, cooking and painting.\n\nRebecca “Becca” Anketell, DO\n\nCampbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHi! My name is Becca Anketell, and I am excited to be a PGY-1 at MAHEC this year! I am originally from Methuen, Massachusetts which is a city just a little north of Boston. I stayed in New England for my undergraduate career, attending the University of Connecticut, studying physiology and neurobiology. I was lucky enough to witness both the men’s and women's basketball national championship while I was there in 2014. I then moved down to North Carolina in 2018 to attend medical school at Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\nWhile at CUSOM I was lucky enough to meet my significant other, Bobby Greer, and we were able to couples match here at MAHEC in internal medicine and general surgery. We’re excited to be moving to Asheville together after multiple vacations to the Blue Ridge Mountains during med school. I can’t wait to continue to build on my passion for IM here at MAHEC. I love the variety of inpatient and outpatient medicine, the pathology, and of course the patients. After interviewing I knew MAHEC was the perfect place from their passion for continuing medical education to resident wellness, and most importantly, their warm and welcoming vibes from the entire faculty and the inaugural class.\n\nIn addition to medicine, I love being outdoors hiking, biking, and traveling to the beach or the lake. I like my fair share of reality tv and of course watching basketball. We are excited to keep exploring all the different breweries and trails of Asheville!\n\nMarie Belmonte, DO\n\nEdward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Virginia Campus\n\nHello everyone! So just a little bit about me: I grew up in Williamsburg, VA and attended VCU in the nearby city of Richmond. After a couple of jobs in the medical field after completing a B.S. in Biology, I journeyed to southwest Virginia and attended VCOM in Blacksburg for medical school. I am so excited to start the next chapter in my life and career in Asheville at MAHEC because I get to be part of the inaugural class of the internal medicine program and I get the best of both worlds of living and working in a diverse city and in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains. My interests in medicine include women’s health and underserved medicine. In my free time, I am an avid brewery explorer and hiking outdoors.\n\nCyril “Justin” Dizon, DO\n\nEdward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Carolinas Campus\n\nHi everyone! My name is Justin Dizon and while I am originally from the Philippines, I grew up about an hour away from Asheville in Hickory, NC. I did my undergrad at UNC-Chapel Hill (Go Heels!) and then did my gap years in Chapel Hill, NC and Blacksburg, VA. I earned my medical degree at VCOM-Carolinas in South Carolina and then completed a Transitional Year at Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center in Athens, Georgia (Go Dawgs!). After 5 long years I am so happy and excited to return to NC and join MAHEC-Internal Medicine.\n\nMAHEC was always on my radar during the interview season but it was not until the interview day when I realized how perfect of a fit it was. Despite the interview day remaining virtual, I left the day extremely impressed by what Dr. Call and the rest of the faculty have already achieved with the nascent Internal Medicine program as well as their future vision moving forward. I wanted to be a part of what they were building here and I have no doubts that the program will help me achieve my career goals. As a bonus, the program is in an incredible city near my family and friends. I could not ask for a better opportunity!\n\nWhen I am not in the hospital or clinic, I can be found out hiking, on the tennis court, at a local restaurant/brewery, at home playing video games on the PC I built myself, in the kitchen baking and decorating a cake, or most importantly, catching up on sleep.\n\nElizabeth Hagenmaier, DO\n\nCampbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHello friends! My name is Elizabeth Hagenmaier. I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio – home to Lebron James (quick fun fact). I decided to move South for college and obtained my B.S. in Biology from the University of Kentucky – GO WILDCATS! I was later accepted to Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) to obtain my DO degree. I got involved in a variety of volunteer work, including working at our free clinic and starting a community project in Harnett County, NC.\n\nI am beyond excited to start residency here at MAHEC. I completed an internship in Western North Carolina between my 1st and 2nd year of medical school and fell in love with the mountains. MAHEC provides the perfect opportunity to help an underserved community. The program’s tandem block schedule, multiple outpatient opportunities, and the all-female leadership were just of few of the reasons I decided MAHEC was where I wanted to train.\n\nWhen I am not working, I love reading mystery novels, cooking, and exploring fun and unique breweries and restaurants with my husband and our pup, Kylo.\n\nAngela Heysel, MD\n\nSidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University\n\nHello! My name is Angela, and I am so excited to join the MAHEC family! I grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia with my parents, two sisters, and our family Shih Tzus. When I wasn’t in school, you could find me at the local dance studio taking ballet, tap, and jazz classes. I have been able to continue my dance training even during medical school. After high school, I attended the College of William and Mary and graduated with a BS in Biology. I moved up to Philadelphia to attend medical school at Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. After four years in the bustling city, I am looking forward to the peace and quiet of the mountains in Asheville.\n\nI decided to pursue internal medicine because I truly love every aspect of patient care. I believe strongly in taking care of the patient as a whole. My specific interests in medicine are primary care, women’s health, and infectious disease.\n\nI am looking forward to working at MAHEC because of all the people I met during my interview day, as well as, the beautiful location in Asheville. Although everything was virtual, you could truly see their dedication to patient care and the bond they shared with each other. It is truly an environment where I know I will grow into a dedicated and compassionate physician.\n\nKatherine Keck, MD\n\nMorehouse School of Medicine\n\nHello everyone! My name is Katherine Keck, and I am beyond excited to be joining the Internal Medicine team at MAHEC. As a former resident of Jasper, GA, at the southern end of the Blue Ridge Mountains, I am delighted to be living in the mountains again!\n\nI was born in Atlanta, Georgia, but I am an American British dual citizen and spent five of my early childhood years in England. Most of the rest of my life I lived in the metro Atlanta area, with a brief two years living in Illinois. I graduated from the University of Georgia with a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Biology. After college, I worked as a medical scribe at an urgent care in New York City. Three years later, I returned to Georgia to complete a master’s degree in Biomedical Sciences at Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine Georgia Campus, and then I obtained my medical degree from Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, GA.\n\nOutside of medicine, I enjoy being creative, either through crafting or working on DIY projects. I also love going for walks and exploring new areas of the city or outdoor trails with friends. My 14-year-old Cockapoo is especially going to love going for walks in the wonderful Asheville weather!\n\nAs a new member of the MAHEC family, I am looking forward to serving and learning from the Western North Carolina community!\n\nAaron Kollross, MD\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health\n\nHello! My name is Aaron. I am thrilled to continue my medical education at MAHEC! I grew up in a small town named Auburndale in central Wisconsin. While I have never lived outside of the state of Wisconsin, I am excited to experience life in the mountains of North Carolina.\n\nI initially became interested in medicine due to my own personal journey with type 1 diabetes. This obstacle in my life became my inspiration to explore medicine. Through my experiences, I was able to give back to the younger members of my community who also struggle with this condition. I attended the University of Wisconsin – Eau Claire for undergraduate studies and earned a degree in biology. After graduation, I worked as a histology technician for the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics. I then attended the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, specifically focusing on rural medicine with the Wisconsin Academy of Rural Medicine program. Rural medicine is one of my passions and I am excited to bring my background in this setting to Asheville.\n\nOutside of medicine, I am an avid outdoor enthusiast. I enjoy hiking, biking, running, kayaking, fishing, and watching professional sports (NFL/NBA/NHL/MLB). Winter is my favorite season and I take full advantage of the snow by skiing, playing hockey, and snowmobiling. Some unique skills of mine are maintaining a wide range of houseplants, making maple syrup, and mixology. I also enjoy spending time with family and friends, all of whom are excited to visit Asheville.\n\nMichael “Mike” Lawrence, MD\n\nUniversity of Vermont Larner College of Medicine\n\nHi, friends! Mike here. I’m a Yankee transplant originally from Vermont, but Asheville has been my home away from home for about ten years, so I’m thrilled to be living here while I complete my residency training. I studied philosophy at Davidson College before returning to Vermont to attend medical school at UVM’s Larner College of Medicine. Prior to starting residency, I completed a one year post-doc in diabetes clinical research right here in Asheville.\n\nIn my spare time, you can find me shredding some sick riffs on my axe, mountaineering on the most dangerous peaks in the world, or wearing a cardigan and doing a crossword puzzle…awesomely. I also love sports, especially football and baseball, and I’m working towards my black belt in homemade pizza making.\n\nMy clinical interests include men’s health and fitness, diabetes and metabolism, and military medicine.\n\nKayleigh Lewis, MD\n\nFIU Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine\n\nHello! My name is Kayleigh Lewis, and I couldn’t be more excited to be joining the MAHEC community as an internal medicine resident. Here’s a bit about myself I’d like to briefly share with you all. I was born and raised in South Florida and moved to the other end of the state to attend Florida State University (Go Noles!) where I pursued my undergraduate degree in biology. After graduating from college in 2017 I began medical school at Florida International University in Miami, FL. Uniquely, I fell in love with internal medicine in the middle of a pandemic at the beginning of my intern year as a Transitional Year resident. Outside of medicine I enjoy traveling, watching a good documentary, discovering new restaurants and coffee shops, and I am always up for a fun outdoor adventure!\n\nSharidan Maxwell Hill, MD\n\nBrody School of Medicine at East Carolina University\n\nMy name is Sharidan Maxwell Hill. I was born in Florida, but have lived in North Carolina since I was 8 years old. I grew up in the Garner area and completed my bachelor's degree at Campbell University, majoring in Pre-Professional Biology and minoring in chemistry. After completing my degree, I moved to the Charlotte area where I worked as a CNA for 2 years before starting medical school. I attended medical school at Brody School of Medicine at ECU in Greenville, NC, where I had the privilege of having several mentors that influenced me to pursue the field of internal medicine.\n\nI am so excited to now move to Asheville and get to experience western North Carolina with the rest of my fellow residents at MAHEC! I look forward to exploring the city and mountains with my dog, Jojo, and spending time with my family and friends.\n\nKaydie Murphy, DO\n\nLiberty University College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHello! My name is Kaydie and I am very excited to get to know the community of Asheville! I am originally from a small rural town outside of Grand Junction, Colorado. After obtaining by B.S. with a chemistry minor from my local University, I moved out east where I completed my Doctorate of Osteopathic Medicine via LUCOM in Lynchburg, Virginia. After completing residency with MAHEC, I am eager to get back to my “roots” by building a career as a general internist in a rural, agricultural community.\n\nAs a Coloradan native, I love being outdoors and in the sunshine! I also have a passion for travel. So far, I have been to Portugal, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Honduras. I look forward to adding to the list!\n\nKrystie Murphy, DO\n\nLiberty University College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHello! My name is Krystie and I grew up on a quaint “family farm” ~25 miles outside of Grand Junction, Colorado. I obtained my undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences at Colorado Mesa University. Following graduation from my rural high school, I pursued a career in Musical Theater at my local university until, one day, my sister convinced me to give medicine a “shot”. This led to an amazing journey through medical school at Liberty University where I traded vocal, acting, and dance classes for anatomy, pathophysiology, and pharmacology. Once I started clinical rotations, I found immense joy working in various subspecialities with the adult population and found myself eager to pursue a career in Internal Medicine – with a particular passion for geriatric care. Ultimately, I hope to practice as a geriatrician in underserved, rural areas much like where I grew up!\n\nOutside of medicine, I love traveling (both domestically and abroad), photography, reading, musical theater, and what I lovingly call “dirt church” – in other words, spending time in the good ol’ outdoors! Something unique about me is that I am an identical twin – and we are both current Internal Medicine residents at MAHEC! From medical school to early entrepreneurship, and even traveling across Europe, my sister and I have conquered countless challenges together. And we are both exceptionally excited to get to know our co-residents and the people of Asheville during this next adventure!\n\nJeffrey “Tyler” Ramsey, DO\n\nCampbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHey there! I’m a North Carolina native from the suburbs of Charlotte. I graduated from Appalachian State University with a degree in chemistry before attending medical school at Campbell University.\n\nI have medical interests of hematology/oncology, LGBTQ+ health care, women’s health, and lifestyle medicine. I’m also a huge nerd for academic research and spent some time at the NIH before medical school. A fun fact is that I was featured on BBC, Time Magazine, Forbes, Healthline, and Medscape for my research on essential oils and how they may contribute to breast growth in adolescents!\n\nOutside of medicine, I’m a proud dog dad of a golden retriever named Boone. I often go to the gym and enjoy hiking during my free time, as staying fit and healthy is something I value greatly. I also enjoy skiing in the winter and was a competitive member of the Appalachian State Ski Team.\n\nI am very excited to be joining MAHEC to return to the western North Carolina Appalachian mountains!\n\nKacey Scott, MD\n\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, School of Medicine\n\nHello, y’all! I’m Kacey and I am so glad to be at MAHEC for residency. As a lifelong North Carolinian living almost exclusively in WNC since 2007, I could not be more excited to be living and working in our beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains. I completed my undergrad degree in Spanish at UNC-Asheville and a Master’s in Library Science from UNC-Greensboro. After that, I worked as a medical librarian for 5 years before pursuing medical school at UNC School of Medicine. I returned home to Asheville for my 3rd and 4th year rotations and knew right away that I wanted to stay at MAHEC for my residency training--the faculty and curriculum are spectacular, and the residents are so welcoming and friendly.\n\nOutside of medicine, I enjoy spending time with my husband, Josh, our two dogs (Dobby and Ruth), and cat (Lily). We frequently take advantage of the gorgeous outdoors by canoeing, gardening, hiking, and grilling out. Whether you’re an avid hiker, lover of live music, or beer connoisseur, WNC has something for you to explore, making it a wonderful place to live and play!\n\nTaylor South, MD\n\nUniversity of Colorado School of Medicine\n\nHi everyone! My name is Taylor and I am excited to be joining the MAHEC Internal Medicine team and the Asheville community!\n\nI grew up in Helena, Montana, and attended Carroll College for my undergraduate degree. At Carroll, I studied Biology, played on the football team, partook in several experiences in global health, and worked at the local hospital as a certified nurse aide (CNA). I had about 18 months off between undergraduate and medical school in which I worked part-time with the Indian Health Services and the National Ski Patrol in addition to my work as a CNA.\n\nI ventured out of Montana for medical school at the University of Colorado. At CU, I explored my interests in rural medicine, wilderness medicine, care for the underserved, and American Indian and Alaskan Native Health. Through the guidance of several mentors, I found a love for internal medicine. My interests include rural hospital medicine, critical care, wilderness medicine, and public health. I chose the program at MAHEC because of its strong focus on rural and underserved care as well as for its partnership with the Cherokee Indian Hospital. I look forward to learning and growing with all those who partake in MAHEC’s mission.\n\nOutside of rounds, you might find me mountain biking, fly fishing, bouldering, skiing, cheering for the Denver Broncos, or spending quality time with my partner.\n\nResidents PGY2\n\nBrianna “Bri” Beer, DO\n\nMarian University College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHi! I’m Bri and I am so excited to be joining MAHEC’s Internal Medicine Residency team! I was born in Indiana but lived in Utah from the ages of 11-17 before coming back to Indiana. I attended undergrad at Anderson University in Anderson, Indiana, where I met my husband, Blake. After graduation, I spent a year working as a medical scribe and as a server at my favorite small-town brewery. For medical school, I went to Marian University College of Osteopathic Medicine, where I discovered a love for internal medicine and providing compassionate care to all patients. My interests in medicine include preventative care, community outreach, and preserving humanism in medicine.\n\nOutside of the hospital, I enjoy traveling to new places, hiking, reading, painting, and DIYing. I love to discover new hobbies and recently took up sewing. I am a huge animal lover and Blake and I have what feels like a small zoo at home, with two dogs (Wrigley and Finn) and two cats (Elton and Oliver). Growing up in Utah gave me a love for the mountains, and while the Blue Ridge Mountains are quite different from the Rockies, I can’t wait to explore them and call Asheville home!\n\nJeffrey “Jeff” Borders, MD\n\nQuillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University\n\nWhat’s up everyone! I’m Jeff and super excited to be joining MAHEC! I grew up in Southeast Tennessee where I attended UT-Chattanooga for a B.S. in Molecular Biology and continued my studies for graduate school at Georgetown University studying Physiology. After being wheelchair bound for a few months due to a climbing accident in California, I decided to pursue medicine and completed my medical education at ETSU Quillen College of Medicine right down the road from Asheville in Johnson City, Tennessee. After finishing medical school, I completed a Transitional Year program up in Roanoke, Virginia. I chose Internal Medicine because it has the perfect combination of treating a diverse array of chronic conditions while diagnosing complex pathology. I also love it for the many options you have available after completing the three years of residency. My interests include rural medicine, wilderness medicine, and international health. Having grown up around the mountains of East Tennessee, I feel like Asheville is already home and looking forward to practicing here for the next three years!\n\nOutside of work, I love many outdoor hobbies including mountain biking, hiking, soccer, golf, and camping. I’m also a big fan of concerts/music festivals and playing music. I’ve played guitar on and off for many years and recently bought a drum set (slowly learning). I also love playing chess so you might find me at the outdoor tables downtown.\n\nJacob “Jake” Carlson, MD\n\nLoma Linda University School of Medicine\n\nHi everybody! My name is Jake. I moved around quite a bit growing up, so I can say I have lived in Colorado, Alabama, California, Montana, Washington, and now I am happy to add North Carolina to that list. Even though I haven’t lived in North Carolina personally, my mother was born in Asheville, so I’m happy to be returning to some family roots! I was raised on stories of beautiful mountains and trees as far as you can see, so I’m excited to be able to explore that more when coming to MAHEC.\n\nAs I said previously, I’ve gotten to explore a lot of the US. From living in massive cities on the west coast to small towns in Montana, I’ve come to appreciate the great variety of individuals out there. In medical school, I found that I enjoyed the communication and teamwork aspect when working with patients and healthcare professionals which lead me to ultimately choose Internal Medicine. When I interviewed with MAHEC, I was excited to find very like-minded individuals which is why I am looking forward to the new experiences I will encounter as I broaden my geographic palette on the east coast.\n\nOutside of medicine, I enjoy many other active hobbies including tennis, basketball, and hiking. However, that doesn’t stop me from also spending my fair share of time binge-watching a tv show, rewatching a favorite movie, or reading a good book.\n\nDana Cornwell, DO\n\nLincoln Memorial University DeBusk College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHi, I’m Dana! I’m originally from Clarksville, TN. I completed undergrad at Belmont University in Nashville, TN. I went to medical school at LMU-DCOM and completed my clinical training in mostly Livingston and Cookeville, TN. I’m interested in rural and underserved medicine in the Appalachian region, which prompted my search for a program that took special interest in these populations. I decided MAHEC was the place for me after only a few short minutes speaking with faculty because they were enthusiastic about their patients and residents. I hope to use the knowledge from this program to participate in medical mission trips in the future.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy exploring local food spots and always order appetizers. I bake a mean cinnamon roll and love cooking new dishes. I play tennis, hike, and have a new hobby of roller skating to stay active. I spent most of my life in a dance classroom, so I like to teach and take a class when I can. My husband, two cats, and I are so excited to call Asheville home for a while.\n\nElizabeth “Beth” Corpuz, MD\n\nWestern Michigan University School of Medicine\n\nHello, everyone! My name is Beth, and I am thrilled to join the Internal Medicine program at MAHEC. I am originally from Minnesota, but my family’s adventurous spirit led my sister and I to seek new places to explore during college. I ended up in the Pacific Northwest for undergrad, studying biochemistry at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon. As the next step on my journey, I went to Kalamazoo, Michigan to complete medical school at Western Michigan University School of Medicine, and I am glad to finally end up in Asheville for residency. I chose MAHEC due to the warmth of its community, the passion of the leadership, and the innovation and responsiveness of the program. I truly believe that this program prioritizes quality patient care and robust medical education while also caring for its residents and the community.\n\nWhen I’m not seeking out more medical knowledge or spoiling my cat, I enjoy cooking, baking, gardening, hiking, and game nights with friends. I am fortunate to make Asheville my home and experience everything MAHEC has to offer!\n\nMichael Dasso, MD\n\nUniversity of Arkansas for Medical Sciences College of Medicine\n\nHi, I’m Michael Dasso! I am an Arkansas native. My undergraduate degrees are in Biochemistry and Spanish, and I studied abroad in Mexico, Peru, and Spain. After college, I got a job as a backpacking guide and outdoor educator for the YMCA at Camp Chingachgook in the Adirondack mountains of New York. I then moved back to Arkansas to attend medical school at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Throughout my life, I have loved meeting new people and experiencing new things, so I am incredibly excited to move to a beautiful place like Asheville and become a part of the MAHEC community!\n\nLike being a leader of a backpacking expedition, my passion for medicine has always been rooted in being part of a person’s health journey and guiding them through the obstacles that arise. I am interested in hospital medicine because I like to work with a multidisciplinary team and strive to optimize the hospital system to provide the best care for our patients.\n\nI have several hobbies! I’ve really enjoyed woodworking, and recently made a clock as a wedding gift! I’ve played tennis most of my life, so I’m always happy for the chance to pick up a match. On my days off, you can find me antiquing at estate sales and storage unit auctions, playing video games with friends, or simply getting outside and enjoying nature any way I can.\n\nKareem Goldson, MD\n\nFlorida State University College of Medicine\n\nMy name is Kareem Goldson, and I am ecstatic to join MAHEC’s program as I pursue training in the beautiful city of Asheville! I grew up in Miami “Magic City”, FL - home of South Beach. I earned a bachelor’s degree in biology and minor in chemistry at Florida A&M University before attending Florida State University to pursue medicine.\n\nI love the outdoors, so I’m looking forward to rafting, hiking, fishing, and exploring neighboring areas. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, traveling, sleeping, watching Discovery channel, and playing with my dog.\n\nEmily “Emma” Gosser, MD\n\nUniversity of Kentucky College of Medicine\n\nHello! I’m Emma Gosser! I am from Paris, Kentucky and have been living in Kentucky for my whole life. I completed my bachelor’s degree in biomedical science at Eastern Kentucky University and completed my medical school training at University of Kentucky. I had the wonderful opportunity to be apart of the Rural Physicians Leadership Program in Morehead, KY for my clinical years which allowed me to work with rural population of Eastern Kentucky and begin understanding the difficulties and challenges that occur within this population.\n\nAs someone who wants to work in rural Appalachia it was important to be in a program that serves this population and continue to have opportunities to learn how to best support the disparities that occur here. Internal medicine provides a way to explore all aspects of medicine and maintain a broad range knowledge with patient care and interaction at the center. I have particular interest in primary care, preventive medicine, and lifestyle medicine.\n\nOutside of medicine, I enjoy cooking and baking and love to share meals with others. I also enjoy videogames, dungeons and dragons, puzzles, and creating art!\n\nBinil Jacob, MD\n\nBen-Gurion University of the Negev Faculty of Health Sciences\n\nBorn in a small town in South India, I’ve had the privilege of moving with my family from a young age which led to my growing up in Saudi Arabia, Romania, Dubai, Indonesia, Morocco, Nigeria, India, the United States, France, Azerbaijan, and Israel. This unique upbringing exposed me to significant inequalities in access and delivery of healthcare across a range of sociocultural contexts. I graduated in 2018 from Washington University in St Louis having double majored in Biochemistry (of course through the Chemistry department!) and French. I worked as a Resident Advisor for two years and was involved actively with Barnes Jewish Hospital and SSM St Mary’s Hospital. Then I stayed on for another year in StL to work at my beloved Organic Chem Lab and of course bear witness to our Blues finally winning the long-awaited Stanley Cup.\n\nCaptivated by the integrated Global Health curriculum with medical school, I left the Midwest for Ben Gurion University of the Negev. Highlights from my time at BGU include working with engineering students to develop low-cost ventilators, which led to my joining a team of neonatologists on a 14-year collaboration between Kumasi, Ghana and Beersheva, Israel dedicated to reducing neonatal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa, primarily through improved respiratory health. Experiences in my fourth year in Bangalore, India at St John’s Medical College Hospital solidified my interest in nephrology, particularly in the transition of pediatric patients to adult care.\n\nMy free time is usually spent agonizing over Arsenal’s results (Come on You Gooners!), writing poetry, learning new languages, bouldering, and exploring the great outdoors.\n\nI’m excited for this next chapter at MAHEC Internal Medicine, nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, learning from national leaders, and serving marginalized communities of Western North Carolina.\n\nKristen Kopystynsky, DO\n\nRocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine (RVUCOM)\n\nHello all! My name is Kristen and I’m a Michigan native who has had several slices of life from all over the country, but I could not be more excited to experience Asheville, NC as resident at MAHEC! Originally, I grew up in southeast Michigan and after high school I headed to Denison University in Ohio for my undergraduate studies in Classical Antiquity (I assure you I am very fun at parties). From there, I moved to the Pacific Northwest to experience a bit of the city life in Seattle, but this is where I really fell in love with the mountains. Medical school then brought me to Rocky Vista University in St. George, Utah for 4 years where I discovered that I like everything in medicine far too much to give any of it up (besides Peds and OB/Gyn-those I can give up). Now I am absolutely jazzed to be an internal medicine resident at MAHEC and to start building a career as a general internist.\n\nWhen I am not nerding out over medicine, I am either outside playing ultimate frisbee, hiking, or mountain biking, or I am inside nerding out over my lifelong fandom of the Legend of Zelda series. The remainder of my time is spent consuming the hand-cooked delicacies made by my partner or questing for the world’s most perfect crème brulee.\n\nCarson Merenbloom, MD, MPH\n\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, School of Medicine\n\nHello! My name is Carson and I am a lifelong North Carolinian, with the exception of four years spent in Washington, DC while going to college at American University. After college, I moved back to North Carolina and worked for three years in the Infectious Diseases division at UNC Chapel Hill, and then attended the UNC School of Medicine for my medical degree. I loved UNC so much that I chose to stay for an extra year to obtain my Master’s in Public Health degree. My master’s research focused on the intersections of social determinants of health and utilization of the emergency department for non-emergent care. I was also a member of the health sciences a cappella group.\n\nMy number one goal when working with patients is to gain a deep understanding of their needs, and I strive to make shared decisions that align with patients’ healthcare goals and values. I have clinical interests in LGBTQ health (I’m a proud part of the LGBT community myself!), underserved populations, substance use treatment, mental health, patient education, and quality improvement.\n\nWhen not working, I enjoy gardening, engaging with the local Jewish community, spending time with family, and enjoying the outdoors.\n\nDavid Notman, MD\n\nFlorida State University College of Medicine\n\nHey everyone! My name is David Notman and I’m very happy to be joining MAHEC’s Internal Medicine Program! I grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and have lived in Florida my whole life so I’m enthusiastic to explore the beautiful mountains of Western North Carolina. I completed my undergrad at the University of Florida (go gators), where I majored in biology, then went on to do medical school at Florida State University. In my free time, you can find me hiking, kayaking, visiting national parks, traveling, working out, checking out new restaurants, or watching a good movie!\n\nI entered internal medicine due to the wide breadth of pathophysiology, the ability to coordinate care and work with subspecialists, and to be able to practice preventative medicine. I am very excited to train at MAHEC due to its extremely supportive environment, devoted faculty, and emphasis on patient-centered care!\n\nMary Ann Reeves, MD\n\nUniversity of Queensland School of Medicine\n\nHi there! I’m Mary Ann, and am very excited to be part of the close-knit community here at MAHEC Internal Medicine. As a native North Carolinian, I have always cherished our mountainous region, but my love of travel took me to many different environments while completing my studies. After college in Portland, Oregon, I moved to New York City to receive my M.S. in Nutrition at Columbia University. From there, medical school brought me to Australia and New Orleans. At this stage of the journey, it is an honor to return home to serve the lovely people of North Carolina! My career interests include cardiology and pulmonology/critical care.\n\nWhen not working, I enjoy hikes with my dog, spending time with family, dancing ballet, and painting.\n\nEthan Shroll, MD\n\nUniversity of Oklahoma College of Medicine\n\nHello! I'm Ethan, a resident physician in internal medicine at MAHEC. Originally from Oklahoma, I have BAs in Psychology and Religious Studies from the University of Oklahoma. I studied medicine at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center after working in inpatient psychiatry for ten years while raising my youngest brother. This experience taught me so much about the need for holistic care and motivated me to pursue preventive health and ways to address healthcare disparities in vulnerable populations. During medical school I found great fit with internal medicine, where I feel there is always more to learn, and with how varied a field it is, there seem to be a million ways to help people. At MAHEC, I knew from the start that I’d found a home. Kind people, incredible leadership, and solid values make it a program anyone would be overjoyed to work at, and couldn’t be more excited for the opportunity.\n\nI’m also excited to be moving to a place with such a vibrant culture! When I'm not wearing a white coat, you may find me exploring Asheville's arts scenes, going to trivia nights, or hitting the trails with my husband and our dog to enjoy the natural beauty of the area. Of course, you may also find me watering my extensive collection of houseplants, watching Netflix on the couch with my cats, or playing board games or working on puzzles at the dining room table.\n\nJoslin Stanton, DO\n\nAlabama College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHello everyone! My name is Joslin Stanton, and I am beyond thrilled to be joining the MAHEC family. I’m originally from Florida, and I went to FSU (Go Noles!!) to obtain my undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences. Once it became clear to me that I wanted to pursue a career in medicine, I ventured to Tampa to get my Master’s degree in Medical Sciences. My journey to medical school eventually landed me in Alabama where I earned my DO degree from the Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine. I am excited to finally be moving further north to experience the beautiful area of Asheville, NC that I have heard so many amazing things about (and finally experience all 4 seasons!).\n\nI was invested in the MAHEC IM program pretty much from the moment I got the invite to interview. From the interactions with the faculty and residents to hearing just how much MAHEC values the support and well-being of its residents were just a few of the things that hooked me from the beginning. MAHEC simply just had that extra something that spoke to me, and I knew without a doubt that this program was the perfect fit for me. In addition to internal medicine being a wonderful specialty as a whole, I am excited to learn more about hematology/oncology and lifestyle medicine.\n\nMy interests outside of medicine include journaling, cooking, hiking, spending time with family, friends, my two little fur babies Flex and Fuchsia, and continuing to nurture the part of me that likes to try anything at least once.\n\nResidents PGY1\n\nEmily Ashe, DO\n\nLincoln Memorial University Debusk College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nEmily is a native to western North Carolina, growing up in the town of Sylva. She received her B.S. in 2016 and her M.S. in 2019 from Western Carolina University (WCU). Emily’s M.S. thesis addressed how the human oral microbiome changes during decomposition in the Southern Appalachian biome. She has served as an adjunct professor at WCU and is passionate about education and serving her community. In 2020, Emily began attending medical school at Lincoln Memorial University in Tennessee. Her love for microbiology sparked her interest in pursuing a career in Infectious Diseases, which is the specialty she plans to enter following her training in Internal Medicine. Emily loves the collaborative atmosphere and diagnostic challenges of Internal Medicine and is most at home in the inpatient hospital setting where she applies her inquisitive nature and strives to help her patients understand their care.\n\nFrom the beginning of my journey in medicine, my goal was to apply what I learned to serving the habitually underserved communities back home in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. This meant I always knew I wanted to become a member of the amazing group of residents here at MAHEC, and I am so grateful to have that opportunity. In my free time I enjoy a wide variety of hobbies, including board games, dungeons and dragons, painting and drawing, reading, baking, and hunting for salamanders, all accompanied by my husband and best friend, Dr. Matthew Hooks. As luck would have it, Matt will also be joining the MAHEC family as a first-year resident in the Psychiatry program. We grew up in the same hometown and have been fortunate to have one another (and our two wonderful cats!) to look to for support throughout our medical training. I can’t wait to start my journey as a resident at MAHEC and continue serving those that call the mountains home!\n\nIbtisam “Sara” Atamna, DO\n\nEdward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Carolinas Campus\n\nSara has been interested in medicine since she donned her first pair of glasses and marveled at the way her optometrist was able to correct her medical concern with a tool that relied on simple applications of science. She began shadowing other doctors and quickly realized a career in healthcare where she, too, could help others by using the principles of science was her calling. She scribed and shadowed throughout her grade school and college years and decided to apply to medical school. It was not until her second to last rotation where she worked with MAHEC residents in her internal medicine rotation where she felt she could best apply the knowledge she had gained in medical school. Internal medicine has the breadth and variety to keep her always engaged, and it allows her to maintain much of the medical knowledge she fell in love with.\n\nI enjoy cooking and baking, and love trying new foods. During my time spent in Asheville, I got to enjoy many of the different cuisines offered at the restaurants in the city. I also love interior decorating and organizing, and frequently spent my time in Asheville perusing the home décor stores in the area. My husband and I have two cats that help us decompress and keep us company when we are home. Lastly, I love biking, hiking, and going on hikes, and the hikes I went "
