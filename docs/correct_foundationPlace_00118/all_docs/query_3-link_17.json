        "text": "Berd spokes also resist damage from blunt force impacts made directly to the spokes. In the slow motion video above, a metal rod is shot into a wheel spinning at high speed to simulate a stick or other object that could be encountered on the trail. In the metal spoked wheel test, one spoke completely fails by pulling through the rim, which would require full rim replacement, while another spoke is badly bent. In the wheel built with Berd spokes, no damage occurs as the spokes absorb the impact. Just another way Berd spokes keep you on the trail.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nGeneral Information\n\nWhat are Berd Spokes made of?\n\nBerd spokes are made from Dyneema®. Dyneema® has 15 times the strength-to-weight ratio of steel and floats on water. It also has a significantly improved fatigue life and will not degrade from UV exposure.\n\nHow much do the spokes cost?\n\nThe MSRP for individual Berd spokes is $8.\n\nWhy are Berd spokes white?\n\nWhite is the natural color of the material. Like carbon fiber is black, Dyneema® is white.\n\nDo you offer spokes in any color other than white or black?\n\nBerd offers only white and black spokes. However, the spokes can be easily colored by using one of our Spoke Coloring Kits and coloring your white spokes that are installed in Berd wheels.\n\nHow white will my white spokes stay over time?\n\nYour spokes will stay pretty white. Over time you may see some staining from dirt, mud, etc. but Dyneema® is not like white bar tape! You can clean your spokes using Dawn Dish Soap and water, along with some elbow grease. Do not use harsh solvents or cleaning supplies on your spokes. If this is a big concern, we suggest ordering black spokes or using one of our Spoke Coloring Kits to color your spokes.\n\nI ordered black spokes but when I measure them, they measure about 1mm shorter than the length ordered. What gives?\n\nWhen white Berd spokes are colored black they “shrink” by approximately 1 mm. When they are put under tension, they “grow” to their actual length. It is always helpful to lace the high tension of the wheel first and then the low-tension side to accommodate for this slight “shrinkage.”\n\nCan I send my wheels to Berd to rebuild with PolyLight Spokes?\n\nAbsolutely! Use our Berd Wheel Rebuilding service for instructions and cost.\n\nIs there anywhere that Berd won’t ship?\n\nWe ship wheels and spokes almost everywhere in the world except for areas covered by exclusive dealers or current trade embargos.\n\nCan I get custom colored stickers for my wheels?\n\nYes! We partner with Stikrd to produce our decals. Please submit a decal request form on the Stikrd website and you can purchase genuine Berd decals in any color of your choice!\n\nQuestions Relating to Spoke Tension\n\nWhere can I go for routine maintenance of my Berd wheels?\n\nA Berd dealer near you can be found using our Dealer Locator. Trueing and tensioning may be performed by a trained bicycle mechanic who has read and understands the Berd Installation Guide. If a shop is not a Berd dealer, tools and spare spokes are available from major bicycle parts distributors, including BTI.\n\nBecause Berd spokes are made from a flexible fiber, do they shrink or expand?\n\nBerd spokes do experience viscoelastic stretching during the build process where they will initially lose tension after being brought into tension for the first time. Once the wheels have been properly built and tensioned they will stabilize.\n\nDo Berd spokes lose tension over time, and what maintenance is required?\n\nAll wheels with Berd spokes are built with a multi-day tensioning process to reduce the amount of tension loss that will happen after the wheels are installed on a bike. Despite this, the tension in Berd spoke wheels will decrease by approximately 30% over the first 6 months of use due to the natural \"bedding in\" process of the fibers. This loss in tension does not affect the durability or longevity of Berd spoke wheels, and there is no requirement to increase the tension. If desired, the tension can be increased after 3-6 months by turning each nipple by 2 full turns from the tire side of the nipple while using the Berd spoke holding tool to prevent the spokes from twisting, followed by minor adjustments to ensure the wheel is true and dished properly.\n\nWhat are the tension and trueness specifications for new Berd wheels?\n\nAt Berd we strive to deliver the highest quality products and wheel builds. We true our wheels to within .25 mm radially, .25 mm laterally, and within .50 mm for the dish. The tension specification for finished Berd wheels is 100 kgf. Berd spokes will lose approximately 30% of their initial tension over the first six months but unlike metal spokes they maintain all of their strength regardless of tension and increasing the tension is not required. This is a normal process and a trained bicycle mechanic can bring the tension back up to 100 kgf if desired.\n\nI'm tensioning my spokes and the spoke is going past the nipple, is my spoke too long?\n\nIt is OK for Berd spokes to protrude up to 4 mm past the end of the nipple. This is especially common using internal nipples. Unless the top of the spoke is interfering with your rim tape, this is not a problem at all. Spokes are considered too long if they protrude more than 4 mm past the end of the nipple, or if the spoke holding tool bottoms out on the bottom of the nipple when tightening the spoke (i.e., the flat on the spoke can go about halfway into the nipple).\n\nCompatibility\n\nWhat types of hubs do Berd spokes work with?\n\nBerd spokes are compatible with all J-bend hubs and all tangential straight pull hubs. Berd spokes are not compatible with radial straight pull hubs. Berd spokes are not recommended for use with hubs with carbon hub shells. The Berd Spoke Calculator cannot calculate unique lacing patterns (2:1 lacing, paired spokes, etc.).\n\nWhat types of rims do Berd spokes work with?\n\nBerd spokes work with all standard bicycle rims, including rims designed for both external and internal nipples.\n\nDo you make BMX spokes?\n\nYou betcha! We now offer spokes from 178 mm to 315 mm! Please note, all wheels using spoke lengths from 178 mm to 249 mm require an additional step in your hub preparation as described in the Berd Spokes Installation Guide.\n\nAre Berd spokes the same length as metal spokes for any given wheel?\n\nNo. Berd spoke lengths are slightly different than metal spoke lengths to account for the hub connection and the initial stretch of the spokes when building. Our spoke calculator must be used to calculate the proper length.\n\nDoes my hub need to be modified to work with Berd spokes?\n\nTangential straight pull hubs do not require hub prep; instead, the Tangential Straight Pull Inserts are used. J-bend spokes require the hub preparation process described in the Installation Guide to remove sharp corners prior to lacing the spokes.\n\nHow do Berd spokes connect to the hub?\n\nThe eye of the spoke is pulled through the hub hole and secured with a small rod.\n\nHow do Berd spokes connect to the rim?\n\nBerd spokes connect to the rim using standard 2 mm, 14-gauge threaded nipples.\n\nWhat type of nipple should I use with Berd spokes?\n\nWe highly recommend using 16 mm double square locking nipples because they can be trued from the back of the rim, have additional thread engagement, and prevent loosening of the nipples over time. If using a rim that requires internal nipples, we recommend locking internal nipples.\n\nCan I use a Single Wall Rim with Berd Spokes?\n\nBerd does not recommend using single wall rims (with the exception of Hed Carbon Fat Bike Rims). Berd spokes must be built with double square nipples due to the elongation that takes place during the build process. As a result, the heads of the nipples cannot easily be taped and sealed for tubeless setup. All single wall wheels built by Berd will be assembled using neoprene washers and brass nipples, which has been tested to be tubeless compatible for Hed Carbon Fat Bike Rims. However, Berd makes no guarantee as to tubeless compatibility on any other rims, which is why Berd does not recommend using single wall rims with Berd spokes.\n\nDo you build with Industry Nine traditional straight pull hubs, or with their threaded straight pull hub?\n\nYes, we do build with Industry Nine standard straight pull hubs. We are not able to build on Industry Nine system hubs.\n\nBerd Dealers\n\nCan I purchase Berd spokes from my local bicycle shop?\n\nYes! You can find a listing of Authorized Berd Dealers by using our Dealer Locator. If your favorite shop is not already a dealer, please ask them to submit a dealer application.\n\nI’m a shop or wheel builder and I want to use Berd spokes. How can I become a dealer?\n\nPlease fill out our New Dealer Inquiry Form to apply to become a dealer/installer for Berd spokes and wheels!\n\nTech/Durability\n\nCan I race with Berd Spokes?\n\nYes! Berd spokes are legal for racing. In fact, Henrique Avancini won the Mountain Bike Marathon World Championship in Glasgow, Scotland on Berd spokes!\n\nHow much weight will I save over metal spokes?\n\nDepending on the wheelset, weight savings with Berd spokes typically range from 100 to 200 g.\n\nHow aero are Berd spokes?\n\nThe aerodynamics of Berd spokes are similar to 14-gauge spokes but they are not as aero as a bladed spoke. The weight savings and vibration damping will outweigh this small decrease in aerodynamics for most riders.\n\nCan you replace a spoke without removing the nipple?\n\nSimilar to metal spokes, a good condition, in-tact, nipple may be used when replacing a spoke in an emergency. However, it is recommended that new nipples be used when replacing spokes.\n\nIs there a weight limit for Berd spokes?\n\nThere is no weight limit for Berd spokes but, like with any spoke, heavier riders should use more spokes. There may be weight limits for our stock wheelsets, but that is due to rim limitations, not the spokes. Please see the individual product for these listings.\n\nWhat is the fatigue life at the spoke/nipple interface compared to standard spokes?\n\nBerd spokes typically outperform high-end steel spokes in accelerated drum fatigue tests.\n\nHow do your spokes hold up to lateral impact/force?\n\nBerd spokes handle lateral impacts very well! Check out this review from our friends at Worldwide Cyclery for a video example of a lateral impact on the spokes.\n\nHow do Berd spokes handle chain drops and derailleurs into spokes?\n\nChain drops due to over shifting where the chain falls between the cassette and the hub can cause damage to Berd spokes, which may require replacement of the damaged spokes, similar to metal spokes. In other scenarios, such as a derailleur going into the spokes or other blunt force impacts, Berd spokes are often more resilient than metal spokes.\n\nBerd Spokes are flexible, so how can you make a wheel out of them?\n\nTo answer that question, we need to discuss how wheels are built. Each spoke in a wheel is pulled in tension during the wheel building process – in fact, each spoke is under 50 - 100 kgf, depending on the particular wheel build. When riding the bike, spokes at the bottom of the wheel de-tension to support the weight of the rider, but because they are pretensioned, they never leave tensile loading. Because of this, flexible spokes function equivalently to metal spokes.\n\nAre wheels built with Berd spokes as stiff as wheels built with traditional metal spokes?\n\nWheels built with Berd spokes are slightly less stiff than metal spokes when measured statically. As wheel speed increases, the viscoelastic properties of the Dyneema® cause the wheel stiffness to increase the faster you go.\n\nThe molecular properties of Dyneema® are unique when it comes to handling individual spokes. If you were to take a spoke out of the packaging and manipulate it, or if you were to lace the spokes into a wheel and then remove the spoke, that spoke would measure slightly shorter than its true length. After tensioning, the spoke will again measure its actual length.\n\nHow do I keep Berd spokes from twisting as I build or true my wheel?\n\nBoth the Berd Wheel Builder’s Kit and Berd Spoke Replacement Kit include a Berd Spoke Holding Tool that allows you to grasp the flat that has been manufactured into each Berd spoke, allowing you to hold the spoke while tightening the nipple, much like standard bladed spokes. See this video on How to True a Berd Wheel for more info.\n\nCan I go back to metal spokes after preparing a set of hubs for Berd spokes?\n\nThe Berd spoke hub preparation process removes sharp corners from the hub holes and does not affect the integrity of the hubs. Metal spokes can be used in a set of hubs that has been previously prepared for use with Berd spokes.\n\nI used the Berd Spoke Calculator and the Berd spoke length is longer than metal spoke length. Why are Berd spokes longer than metal spokes despite stretching more than metal spokes during the build process?\n\nThe connection at the hub adds 9 mm for J-bend hubs and 5 mm for straight pull hubs. Therefore, Berd spokes will typically be longer than metal spokes for the same build even after the calculator takes into account the extra stretch of Berd spokes.\n\nCan Berd Spokes be used on E-Bikes?\n\nBerd spokes can be used as a replacement for 14 gauge (2.0 mm) metal spokes, including on bike wheels rated for e-bike use. As long as the hubs and rims are rated for e-bike use and designed to interface with 14 gauge spokes, Berd spokes can be used.\n\nWarranty\n\nWhat is the warranty on Berd complete wheels?\n\nPlease check out our warranty information at our\n\nwarranty page.\n\nIf I use Cushcore inserts on my Berd wheels will I void the warranty?\n\nAbsolutely not! There are no issues using Cushcore inserts with Berd wheels.\n\nBerd Spokes are protected by US Patents 10,150,332 B2 and 10,661,598 B2.\n\nIn partnership with the United States National Science Foundation"
