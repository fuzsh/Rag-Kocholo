        "text": "Both Republicans and Democrats have stressed the paramount importance of Nevada’s role in the upcoming presidential election, but several election watchers are predicting the Silver State’s voter turnout will drop below 70% for November’s general election.\n\nExecutive Director of both Lincy Institute and Brookings Mountain West David Damore first discusses the results of Nevada’s Primary Election and the biggest takeaways from former President Trump’s Sunset Park rally. Then we discuss the opening of the Silver Copper Crossing Bridge and where other major infrastructure projects in Nevada are at.\n\nMuch of the attention each presidential election cycle centers on swing states where the outcome can have an outsize impact on who wins the White House. But candidate campaigns and political analysts also zero in on smaller areas where factors like demographics and turnout can play critical roles in the race's ultimate outcome.\n\nDuring an international reporting tour titled ‘Democracy is More Than Election Day’, arranged by the Global Public Affairs Bureau of the U.S. Department of State, through its Foreign Press Centers and in cooperation with the Meridian International Center, a lecture was organized at the University of Nevada with Dr. David Damore, Professor of Political Science and Executive Director of the Lincy Institute and Brookings Mountain West. In his lecture, Dr. Damore spoke about the political landscape in Nevada, including election cycles and electoral candidates as the state is preparing for upcoming presidential elections in the U.S. in November 2024."
