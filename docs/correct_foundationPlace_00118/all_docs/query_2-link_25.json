Ideal candidates represent the diversity of health philanthropy across a variety of dimensions, including gender, geographic location, life experience, organization size and assets, type of health funder, professional skills, and race and ethnicity.\n\nThis year the board is prioritizing candidates with expertise in finance, fundraising, and communications/marketing. The board is also seeking candidates from the South, Midwest, and Mountain regions.\n\nNominations Due: Friday, August 30, 2024\n\nGIH Advocacy for the 2024 Reauthorization of the Older Americans Act (OAA)\n\nThe OAA provides critical services that address the social drivers of health for older adults. If the OAA is not reauthorized, it is set to expire on September 30, 2024. Grantmakers In Health (GIH) and Grantmakers In Aging (GIA) announced a partnership last year to engage funders in advancing the reauthorization of this critical piece of legislation.\n\nSupport GIH and GIA's OAA Partnership\n\nGIH and GIA are raising funds to support our advocacy work on the OAA, and we still need additional investments to reach our goal. Please reach out to Cecilia Kramer at ckramer@gih.org for more information. We are appreciative of the funders who have already supported this partnership.\n\nRecent OAA Events\n\nExclusive\n\nAnnouncing GIH's 2024 Policy Priorities\n\nGIH seeks to take a more active role in defining the key issues that will advance better health for all and support health philanthropy with thought leadership and programming to make a lasting impact by influencing advocacy, policy, and funding in targeted areas\n\nThis policy agenda identifies our public policy priorities for the coming year. We selected priorities that effect policy and systems change towards health and health equity; align with GIH’s strategic plan; are actionable, timely, relevant, evidence-based, and realistic for GIH’s involvement; galvanize staff, Board, Funding Partners, and health philanthropy; leverage GIH’s organizational resources and unique positioning to lead; and allow GIH to remain nonpartisan. We hope these priorities will also inspire the field of health philanthropy and encourage greater collaboration and commitment to common policy goals among funders. We look forward to working with funders and others to advance this agenda.\n\nGIH Health Policy Update Newsletter\n\nThe Latest\n\nAn Exclusive Resource for Funding Partners\n\nThe Health Policy Update is a new monthly newsletter produced in collaboration with Trust for America’s Health. Drawing on GIH’s policy priorities outlined in our policy agenda and our strategic objective of increasing our policy and advocacy presence, the Health Policy Update provides GIH Funding Partners with a range of federal health policy news.\n\nFeatured Resources\n\nThe People Say: A New Older Adult and Caregiver Policy and Research Tool\n\nAn online research hub features first-hand insights from older adults and caregivers on the issues most important to them, as well as feedback from experts on policies affecting older adults. The project particularly focuses on the experiences of communities often under-consulted in policymaking, including older adults of color, those who are low income, and/or those who live in rural areas where healthcare isn’t easily accessible.\n\nKFF Introduces Health Policy 101—A Primer on U.S. Health Policy\n\nKFF launched a new resource —the Health Policy 101 — an online resource or mini “textbook” about health policy for faculty and students. Drew Altman felt the need for a resource like this ages ago, when he was at MIT writing a book on health care regulation and needed a reference with real detail on public programs and health costs. It took a while to produce it but now it’s ready!\n\nThe Joyce Foundation\n\n“Gun Violence is a significant public health issue in our communities. We believe that philanthropy has an important role to play in tackling it. Despite the enormity of that challenge, public and private funding to address gun violence has lagged—perhaps because of the perceived risk in engaging on this issue, or the apparent challenges in driving impact on an issue that seems intractable. For those very reasons philanthropy must rise to the challenge and take risks where government cannot, and lead when others will not.”\n\nGIH Bulletin + News\n\nHelp Shape Next Year’s Grantmakers In Health Annual Conference\n\nGrantmakers In Health (GIH) is seeking volunteers to serve on our 2025 Annual Conference Proposal Review Committee. Committee member feedback is a critical way for GIH to ensure that the annual conference agenda includes high quality, engaging sessions that reflect the interests of the health philanthropy field.\n\n2024 Call for GIH Board Nominations\n\nGrantmakers In Health, an educational organization serving staff, executives, and trustees of foundations and corporate giving programs working in the health field, is seeking nominations for its board of directors for terms beginning in March 2025.\n\nRecent Reports\n\nAdvancing Health and Creating Lasting Impact: MacKenzie Scott’s Grants to Health Foundations\n\nIn 2019, MacKenzie Scott announced that she was stepping into the world of philanthropy to give away her multi-billion-dollar fortune “until the safe is empty”. She has kept her word—to date, she has given away $16.5 billion. Her initial process for choosing which organizations would receive grants was shrouded in mystery. From 2019 to 2023, Scott used a process she termed “quiet research” to identify possible grantee organizations. The lucky organizations received a call from Scott’s consultants, who let them know they were receiving a grant for immediate use however they would like to spend it. In the Fall of 2022, Grantmakers In Health (GIH) became one of those grantee organizations, along with more than 20 health foundations. Two additional GIH Funding Partner organizations received gifts in 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n\n2024 Survey Summary: Health Workforce Strategies\n\nConcerns about the supply, diversity, cultural responsiveness, geographic distribution, and safety of the health workforce have reached a critical level across the country. Philanthropy has a role to play in maximizing the health workforce to achieve patient safety, provider well-being, equitable access, care quality, and improved health outcomes. Therefore, GIH recently conducted a survey to learn about funders’ strategies related to their health workforce investments.\n\nThe Story of Care: A Snapshot of the Care Narrative Change Landscape\n\nAt some point, every one of us will need care or need to provide care. The COVID-19 pandemic put a spotlight on the extraordinary contributions of caregivers and exposed the failings caused by our nation’s lack of care policies, especially for communities of color. Deploying narrative-change strategies across care-related issues will help create the conditions for cultural and policy progress. The goal of this report is to share with funders the promising narrative-change strategies and tactics that have been identified, a directory of funders and grantees who are supporting this work, and how philanthropy can best support this effort.\n\nPerspectives From Health Philanthropy\n\nBuilding Stronger Early Childhood Systems: Reflections from Western Montana\n\nWhat happened when a regional health foundation team embarked on a road trip and drank 600 cups of coffee with their neighbors? They discovered that Western Montanans were tired of band-aid solutions and frustrated with interventions that always seemed to arrive too late. People wanted to focus on prevention to address problems at their roots. They hoped to see more collaboration between organizations and across sectors and emphasized that solutions should be locally born and cultivated, focusing especially on kids in their earliest years.\n\nThe Crucial Role of Philanthropy in Nurturing Equitable Local Journalism\n\nIn an era marked by profound societal divisions, the role of local media in fostering democratic health stands as a cornerstone of informed civic engagement. From critical issues like health care and housing to economic opportunity and climate impacts, local journalism is the bedrock upon which communities build their understanding and response. Yet, the field faces challenges beyond the well-documented financial crisis facing local newsrooms, encompassing deep-rooted inequities in newsroom composition and the narratives they convey.\n\nExploring the Packard Foundation’s U.S. Reproductive Health Initiative\n\nThe Packard Foundation has a long history of funding efforts that protect, regain, and expand access to abortion and contraception and funding innovations to expand access to these services as part of its U.S. Reproductive Health initiative. To explore the foundation’s current work, specifically at the state level, Grantmakers In Health’s Miranda Wesley spoke with the Packard Foundation’s U.S. Reproductive Health Director, Elizabeth Arndorfer.\n\nUpcoming Webinars\n\nFunder Meetup: Older Americans Act Reauthorization Updates\n\nGrantmakers In Health (GIH) and Grantmakers In Aging (GIA) have been hard at work since launching our collaboration last fall to mobilize funder support for the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act (OAA). Join this virtual briefing for an update on our activities, the latest intel on the OAA reauthorization, and a preview of upcoming opportunities to learn about and influence aging funding and policy.\n\nExclusive\n\nRoundtable Discussion for Health Funders’ Policy Staff\n\nJoin this informal roundtable discussion to connect with your peers, explore pressing issues, and share your experiences to advance policy change.\n\nExclusive\n\nFirearm Violence Prevention Learning Community: The Role of Health Care Providers and Systems\n\nThis virtual convening of the Learning Community focuses on the role of health care providers and systems in firearm violence prevention efforts and ways health philanthropy can support this work.\n\nProgram Officer, Health Access Grants\n\nThe successful applicant will collaborate with colleagues in supporting valuable community-based initiatives; exploring effective new opportunities; and elevating medical, dental, and basic behavioral health services throughout the Commonwealth.
