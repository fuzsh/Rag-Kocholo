        "text": "At the Annual Meeting on May 30, guest speaker Mayor Pat Showalter showed slides as she explained how the City works, stressing that the key is the long tradition of civility, within the City Council and with the staff. The councilmembers take turns filling the positions of mayor and vice mayor, a year at a time. The “top-notch” staff carries out the policies the Council decides, and the advisory boards make recommendations to the Council. Each councilmember also represents the City on a range of other local and state boards and commissions. Pat mentioned the council’s seven Strategic Priorities, and then addressed the three topics that the MLNA Board had requested.\n\n– The Rengstorff Avenue Grade Separation Project. After 20 years in the planning, work will begin in 2026 to lower Rengstorff Avenue to pass under the Caltrain tracks. The project will be very disruptive for two years, but will improve traffic flow and safety. The City has made plans to minimize the disruption, and residents will know who to call to report immediate problems.\n\n– The future park at 538 Thompson Ave. The City is well aware of the shortage of park space in Monta Loma. Residents will be invited to participate in the design, scheduled for 2025-26. The City would like to purchase adjacent properties to enlarge it. (In June, the purchase of one adjoining property, 2231 W. Middlefield Rd., was approved.)\n\n– The San Antonio Corridor Plan. Mountain View residents are welcome to participate in Palo Alto’s planning process.\n\nMayor Showalter ended with reminders to make use of the city’s website; to use the Ask MV button to ask questions or report problems; and to stay connected with the City via its various publications, listed at https://www.mountainview.gov/whats-happening.\n\nCity Manager Kimbra McCarthy accompanied Pat and also spoke, mentioning again that civility is a hallmark of Mountain View. More park space for Monta Loma is a priority with the City. The City mailed a questionnaire earlier this year asking residents to rank priorities for a potential revenue measure. The Rengstorff Park Aquatics Center will be finished this summer.\n\nDuring the question period, Pat answered many questions about traffic and traffic mitigation. Incoming MLNA President Olga Bright asked her to explain the sea-level rise mitigation at Shoreline Park, which Pat did by describing how the former salt ponds are being turned into marshes and other climate-resilience plans and maps.\n\nAnother audience member recommended the city’s Parks and Recreation Strategic Plan.\n\nThe meeting on May 30 was the best one in recent memory, with at least 45 attendees. Tricia DelGaudio used newsletter file photos for a slide show that ran on a continuous loop before the meeting. Outgoing MLNA Board President Nirvana Nwokidu had prepared slides illustrating what the neighborhood association does, and the many ways that residents contribute to the neighborhood. She began by introducing Andrea Thomas of the Welcome Team, who in turn asked the new residents to stand and introduce themselves. The three couples had been greeted at the welcome table in the lobby by putting gold stars on their nametags so they could be welcomed by all.\n\nNirvana named the ways in which residents are kept informed (the quarterly newsletter; the email list; and the website, and encouraged to meet (the neighborhood garage sale in May, numerous block parties, and the ice cream social), plus Neighborhood Watch and CERT.\n\nBecause the election was not contested, Nirvana asked for a voice vote to confirm the election of the board candidates. The 2024/25 board took office on July 1, with only the positions of president and changing when Nirvana Nwokidu and First Vice President Olga Bright exchanged roles.\n\nThe business portion of the meeting was followed by illustrated talks by the guest speakers Mayor Pat Showalter and City Manager Kimbra McCarthy, who addressed topics of concern to our neighborhood, including the Rengstorff Grade Separation Project.\n\nAs the electrification of Caltrain nears completion, bringing more frequent trains, the lowering of Rengstorff Avenue to pass under the tracks became more urgent.\n\nThe long-planned project is expected to begin work in 2026, and be completed in about two years. The project is headed by Caltrain, but other government and transportation agencies are involved. The City of Mountain View drafted its “shovel ready” plan in 2014. The environmental study has been completed. Illustrations of the project are on pages 5 through 13 here with a May 2023 update here.\n\nOther relevant websites are the Caltrain site, and two Mountain View Voice articles, January 24, 2024, and February 14, 2014.\n\nIn March 2024, one of the companies bidding to oversee the project contacted our neighborhood, seeking input from the neighborhoods most affected. Three neighbors, including an MLNA board member, volunteered to represent Monta Loma. They raised these questions during an online discussion with representatives of the company:\n\nTraffic: How will vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians be impacted during deconstruction and new construction? How will traffic be restricted from driving through Monta Loma to escape the construction?\n\nNeighborhood entry and exit: How will residents get into and out of the neighborhood? Will there be additional traffic lights?\n\nSafety: How will the fire station on Rengstorff at Montecito be able to function? The MVPD? What about access to schools?\n\nBusinesses and business access: Which businesses will remain at the corner of Rengstorff and Central after the Shell gas station has left? Can customers reach them?\n\nArtesian well: Might this city well in the alley behind the shopping center, which was plugged in 2022-23, cause a problem?\n\nNeighbors enjoyed meeting their neighbors and finding bargains on a lovely Saturday, May 11, making our fifth annual neighborhood garage sale another huge success.\n\nThe almost-fifty households that had registered to participate had their addresses, sale hours, and items listed on a printable document, and their locations marked on a map. When other neighbors noticed all the foot (and bicycle) traffic, they also put their no-longer-needed items out in their driveways, boosting participation.\n\nFeedback included these comments: “We had so much fun!!!” “Loved the grid with location, times, and types of goods!” “What a wonderful neighborhood. We are a multicultural group with people from all over the world. We met, we talked …” “It was great to see the neighbors, find new homes for useful things, and make room in the house on a pleasant day. I feel that I had a better turnout than when the whole city is doing it.” “It was a great way to socialize with our neighbors and feel a deep sense of community. I look forward to doing this every year.”\n\nThe MLNA Ice Cream Social is our biggest social event of the year. Photos of the ICS on Sunday, August 27, 2023, are here. The event drew over 400 people and enabled them to:\n\nVisit the ice cream table for a free individually wrapped ice cream treat.\n\nAsk Gizmo Gary for a balloon creation.\n\nMake a name tag so their neighbors could meet them, and pick up a copy of the ice-breaker game.\n\nVisit the Newcomer Welcome Team’s table for information for new residents (and their neighbors).\n\nMeet Mountain View Whisman School District Superintendent Ayindé Rudolph and Chief Business Officer Rebecca Westover, and examine the exhibit about the school-fence options.\n\nPick up copies of City information on the Parks Strategic Plan, Safe Routes to School, and Sustainability Initiatives and Programs.\n\nLearn about the city’s new Multicultural Engagement Program that offers information in Spanish, Chinese, and Russian.\n\nLearn more about the city’s Recycling and Zero Waste program brought recycling information.\n\nExamine equipment and discuss information to help us stay safe during a disaster with our neighborhood’s CERT members.\n\nSee Pipevine Swallowtail butterfly chrysalises, and learn about their and Monarch butterflies‘ host plants at Alan Whitaker’s table.\n\nVisit Tom Purcell’s display of Monta Loma history items, and Robert Cox’s offerings of books and stationery from the Mountain View Historical Association.\n\nLearn about and volunteer to help at our school. The Monta Loma PTA offered information and membership signups, as did the Crittenden Middle School’s PTA.\n\nVisit the Mountain View Educational Foundation (MVEF), which helps our schools, and the Living Classroom displays.\n\nBring their tree questions and sign up for a free tree at the Canopy table.\n\nLearn about CHAC, the Community Health Awareness Council.\n\nDiscuss whether the 9-month Leadership Mountain View program that begins each September might be right for them.\n\nVisit with a Fire Department crew, who brought an engine and created a rainbow with the hose, and the Police Department, which sent an officer and also a K-9 team with a “very friendly” dog.\n\nLearn about Girl Scouts at Marilyn Nourse’s table.\n\nTaste MLN homegrown organic apples and vote for your favorite variety at Elaine Lou’s table.\n\nRide in the robot-horse-drawn buggy that Wouter Suverkropp brought again this year.\n\nPick up free COVID test kits brought by the Community Action Team (CAT).\n\nTaste cotton-candy from Gloria Jackson’s machine.\n\nAs in past years, plants remaining at the plant-exchange table during the latter part of the afternoon were given away with no exchange required.\n\nThe city manager, members of the City Council, and the members of the boards of trustees of the Mountain View Whisman School District and the Mountain View Los Altos High School District were invited. Five city council members attended, as well as the city manager and the assistant city manager.\n\nPhotos of past years’ ice cream socials and other neighborhood events are here.\n\nOur annual Ice Cream Social was held at Monta Loma Park on Sunday, August 28, and was a huge success. Photos are here.\n\nWith the exhibits and the crowd spread out along the trees on the south side of the park all the way to Thompson Avenue, we didn’t realize until later how many came to meet their neighbors, visit the exhibits, and enjoy a selection of packaged ice cream treats. The welcome-table volunteers signed in over 300 attendees, but many more did not sign in, so we estimate that attendance was at least 350.\n\nNeighborhood participants included our CERT members (safety information), Gary Heyman (balloons), Bill Lambert (Friends of Mountain View Parks), Tom Purcell (Monta Loma history), Alan Whitaker (Monarch and Pipevine Swallowtail butterfly info plus the plants they require), Joan MacDonald (CHAC), and Jill Rakestraw, Ann McMillan, and Grant Grundler (plant exchange).\n\nWouter Suverkropp gave rides to kids in a buggy drawn by robot horses, Gloria Jackson and John Ari Stepp offered cotton candy, and neighborhood band On the Edge provided music. Marty Pulvers staffed the tee-shirt and logo-items sales table, Jim Cochran took photos, and Bill Cranston provided the A-frame signs that reminded us to attend.\n\nOther participants were representatives of the Monta Loma Elementary School PTA, Mountain View Educational Foundation, Living Classroom, Canopy, Recology Zero Waste, the city’s Recreation Division, and Mountain View Historical Association. A crew from the Fire Department brought an engine.\n\nInvited attendees who came included Mayor Lucas Ramirez and City Council members Alison Hicks, Ellen Kamei, Lisa Matichak, and Pat Showalter, plus MVWSD Board of Trustees members Laura Ramirez Berman and Ellen Wheeler. They all appreciated the opportunity to meet Monta Loma residents, and their appreciation was echoed by the neighbors.\n\nThanks to everyone who helped make this year’s event a success."
