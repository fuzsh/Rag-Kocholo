She studied with her Feng Shui Master in Malaysia, and spent time on every continent except Africa and Antarctica. Microlending has offers opportunity and dignity to the recipients, which is why she is drawn to organizations like Whole Planet Planet Foundation, Heifer International, Kiva, and other nonprofits.\n\nErica Boyle\n\nErica Boyle is currently the Natural Channel Director of Sales at nutpods.

Having always had a passion for psychology and what makes everyone tick, Erica received her Bachelor of Science in Psychology at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, WA along with a minor in Hispanic Studies. She had the opportunity to study away in Granada, Spain and that is where her passions began around learning about different cultures. Since then, she has had the opportunity to travel all around the world to meet and learn about the different perspectives of others. She is born and raised in Colorado and absolutely loves the mountains and outdoors! In Erica’s free time, she enjoys guiding sunrise hikes at Red Rocks Park & Amphitheatre where she can meet folks from all over and share a little piece of beauty with them!\n\nCommittee Member\n\nClaire Sommers Buck\n\nClaire is the lead jewelry designer, metalsmith and owner of Claire Sommers Buck Jewelry, a handmade jewelry line based out of Austin, TX.

CSB Jewelry is a small team dedicated to the belief that soulfully produced items can truly enrich our lives.\n\nA native Texan, Claire’s affection for handmade goods began at an early age on the wood floors of her parents’ dusty ceramics studio. In 2009, Claire attended Penland School of Crafts where she immediately fell in love with the tools, techniques and functionality of the craft of metalsmithing. A curiosity of ancient world cultures and an enthusiasm for travel continue to impact her work and practice. Yet, as far across the globe Claire wanders, she is always drawn back home to the quiet and calm of the southwest.\n\nYou can find Claire in her tiny East Austin studio on a daily basis and see her work online at www.clairesommersbuck.com\n\nShannon Callahan\n\nLiving and traveling abroad after college fueled Shannon’s interest in learning from other cultures.

Upon returning stateside, she began volunteering as a literacy tutor assisting recent immigrants with learning English. Her volunteering eventually led to a Masters in Adult Education and Developmental Studies and a career in building literacy and workforce training programs at a variety of community organizations.

Sharing the story, creating interest, and driving revenue will in turn bring more women out of poverty.\n\nRene’s favorite part of the WPF story is the teaching of basic business practices, plus the tools and encouragement given which prepares woman to become their own advocates. The skills taught by WPF team members and their boots on the ground teams, along with micro-loans, gives some of the poorest among us, the self respect and perseverance required to become a self-sufficient productive people living happy sustainable lives.
