The SES 3.4 has been a staple in the SES wheel family, and the newest iteration takes the best features of the previous generation SES 3.4 and 3.4 AR to make the ultimate modern road wheelset.

        "text": "Wow! Did a lot of research on wheelsets for the next upgrade on my recently purchased Specialized Aethos. Settled on three top-end models with excellent independent reviews supported by extensive road testing. Tough choice but in the end one stood above the rest, in my mind, and that was the ENVE 3.4s.\n\nI am late in life to endurance riding, a passion I have only come to realize, so my reasons for choosing a particular wheelset was based on comfort, weight, durability and responsiveness; in that order.\n\nSo when I had the wheels installed at a local bike shop in Portsmouth, NH, Papa Wheelies, I was on mile 75 of my century for that day. They had the wheels and if they could install them right then and there, I would purchase them on the spot. They did, so I did.\n\nEven for the remainder of the century with a steep climb at the end, I immediately noticed the difference with tired legs. The climb was easier to ride and the feel of the road was so much smoother, especially when you feel every bump and pothole at the end of a century.\n\nI've had the wheels for a couple of weeks now, and I can state that I am breaking a few PRs with a little more ease, that my backside does not fear badly conditioned tarmac as it once had before, and that I actually enjoy riding gravel with the 3.4s matched to the 29mm ENVE tubeless tires set at 60psi! Yes! That's right! 60psi and what a difference that makes on very long rides! I also did a 40x repeat of that same steep climb recently that totaled 12.5K ft of climbing that I would not have been able to do on my previous alloy wheels.\n\nOverall, the 3.4s are everything they claim to be. It offers a very smooth ride over tough terrain, yet is quite laterally stiff when jumping on the pedals for a guy my weight at over 190 lbs. And because of my weight combined with these wheels, my descents are frighteningly faster and pleasantly unexpected. And don't get me going on the flats. Just check out my recent PRs!\n\nI do not regret the purchase at all. A purchase of this magnitude takes a lot of consideration and research before pulling the trigger. But in the end for me, the ENVE 3.4s are a beautiful design and well engineered construction that offers everything this cyclist likes to do from breaking PRs on local segments to endurance riding on weekends that I would want from a high-end carbon wheelset."
