        "text": "WILL BE UPDATED FOR 2025 AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE!\n\nâ\n\nParking:\n\nAll but the first story of the four-story City Hall parking structure is available for Stinky Spoke parking. The address is 8711 160th Ave NE, Redmond, WA Â 98052. Â The first floor is earmarked for City vehicles. Â Overflow parking may be available at the King County Courthouse. Â There's a short-cut between the buildings from the parking garage to Redmond City Hall. It will be marked.\n\nâ\n\nPacket Pickup:\n\nPacket pickup will be held from 3 to 6 p.m. on Friday, January 26, at Postdoc Brewing Company, 17625 NE 65th St #100, Redmond, WA 98052. Â In terms of the ride, itâs always more convenient to pick up your packet the day before, if possible. Then, in the morning, youâll park your car, ride your bike to City Hall, and be all ready to go! If itâs not convenient to pick up your packet the day before, be at City Hall starting at 7:30 a.m. on ride day to pick up your packet with your rider number. Itâs possible to pick up your swag bag after the rideâall youâll really need from the packet is your ride number.\n\nÂ\n\nBike Parking:\n\nThis year again, we have bike racks available for the bikes that will be entered in the ride. After parking in the four-story parking garage, ride your bike to the surface lot at Redmond City Hall. There will be some volunteers available to keep an eye on the bikes parked there, however riders should bring their own locks. Ride organizers will not be responsible for bikes before or after the ride.\n\nâ\n\nWhatâs Available on the Ride Course:\n\nWater is available at Redmond Ridge, Farrel-McWhirter Park, and Sammamish River SAG stops along the route. At the Little Bit stop in Farrel-McWhirter Park, traditional hot potatoes and hot chocolate are also available. If youâre going to need more fuel, better carry your own snacks.\n\nâ\n\nVolunteering on the Day of the Event:\n\nThis event takes a lot of volunteer support. Even if you're not riding, volunteering to help before and after the ride is important. Go to: https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/opp3634670.jsp\n\nÂ\n\nTiming of the Ride:\n\nThe ride starts promptly at 9 a.m. from Redmond City Hall. The starting line will be marked and announcements will be made. You may start the ride before 9 a.m., but there will be no guarantee that the SAG stops will be ready for you, particularly Heart Attack Hill and the stop at Redmond Ridge. If you take longer than five hours on the course, you may find that SAG stops have wrapped up for the day and most everyone will have left Redmond City Hall. Lunch with participating food trucks will be ready at 11:30 and will stop serving at 1:30 p.m. Prizes will be awarded between 1:00 and 1:30 p.m. At 2:00 p.m., volunteers will be cleaning up and heading home.\n\nâ\n\nThe After Party:\n\nAfter youâre finished riding, your registration fee entitles you to one free beer or soft drink (more beer is available for purchase) and hot food.Â This year we have a food truck serving our riders: Cascadia Pizza! We are very excited to have Cascadia Pizza. Stick around for the results of the best poker hands and, even if you didnât have a good hand, youâll be eligible for drawings of wonderful gifts and prizes. There is a silent auction available, too, with some great items. Bring your favorite form of payment.\n\nâ\n\nFood and Beverages Before and After the Ride:\n\nThere will be some sort of carbs before the ride and we're working on a coffee vendor. Cascadia Pizza is joining us this year and we'll provide vouchers for registered riders to have lunch as part of their registration fee. Thanks to Postdoc Brewing, all riders who are older than 21 will receive a ticket for a beer. (Soft drinks are also available.) Additional beers are available for purchase.\n\nâ"
