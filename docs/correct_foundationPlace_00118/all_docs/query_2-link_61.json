Specifically, he supported African nations hosted during the Regional Capacity Development sessions, which were held for participants to build capacity and capability, identify needs, and make connections to global organizations that can meet those needs. This effort will result in improved geodetic and geospatial capabilities in African nations in support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This will improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in the broader global geodetic community and enhance the global framework.\n\nFor more information, contact: Dan Roman\n\nMay 24, 2024\n\nNGS released four new online tools to the public on the geodesy.noaa.gov website after the tools were extensively tested on the NGS Beta site. The release enhances access to NGS products, including DSWorld Web, which enables users to submit updated information on survey marks available on NGS datasheets; the Leveling Projects Page that simplifies searches for mark and observation information for an entire leveling project; the Calibration Base Line, or CBL, Web Map that provides quick and easy access to the latest CBL information; and the Passive Mark Page that offers user-friendly datasheet access — including photos, graphics, maps, and project information.\n\nFor more information, contact: Timothy Salisbury\n\nNGS Engages at FedGeoDay 2024\n\nMay 17, 2024\n\nNGS staff participated in FedGeoDay 2024, an event devoted to open geospatial ecosystems like open-source software, open and collaborative mapping, open science challenges, and open engagements, which are used to initiate and grow geospatial capabilities across the U.S. federal government. The NGS senior advisor on geodesy gave a five-minute lightning talk on the first day and was joined by other NGS staff on the second day to present a four-hour workshop on preparing for the modernization of the National Spatial Reference System. The workshop was attended by federal and state government staff and private sector representatives and was recorded by Project Geospatial — a media organization focused on the geospatial industry.\n\nFor more information, contact: Galen Scott\n\nNGS Supports Student Surveying Competition\n\nMay 10, 2024\n\nNGS staff and NOS Deputy Assistant Administrator for Navigation, Observations, and Positioning Rachael Dempsey engaged students at the annual National Society of Professional Surveyors, or NSPS, Student Competition on the National Mall. Twenty-four teams from 20 colleges and a high school competed in two days of activities. Teams completed a scavenger hunt for survey monuments and field exercises, including a triangulation exercise using geodetic control in the NGS database. NGS staff performed a decennial survey, using geodetic digital leveling techniques, to measure through nine passive control marks around the Washington Monument. Representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the National Park Service, and private survey companies were also present to promote surveying as a career. The 14-foot-tall Washington Mini-Monument — a model of the Washington Monument normally hidden from view — was on display. NSPS presented Juliana Blackwell with a plaque to commemorate her successful career as NGS director.\n\nFor more information, contact: Jacob Heck\n\nBeta Versions of Reference Station Web Pages Released\n\nMay 3, 2024\n\nNew webpages for the NOAA Continuously Operating Reference Station, or CORS, Network, or NCN, are being designed as part of the National Spatial Reference System modernization. These pages offer new functionality and have a similar look and feel to the International Global Navigation Satellite System Service CORS station webpages. NGS incorporated feedback from the webinar “New CORS Station Webpages: Public Feedback Forum.” Each CORS will have its own page with station data, metadata, maps, and photos displayed in a modular layout. Some of the new features of the NCN station pages include interactive maps and plots for daily positions, residual time-series, and quality metrics; quick data download options; additional, centralized metadata and supporting links; and a completely new look and feel with collapsible content sections. NGS is deploying these pages on the NGS beta site for testing and public feedback.\n\nFor more information, contact: Kimber Degrandpre\n\nNGS Reevaluates the Heights of Colorado Mountains\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\nNGS researchers estimated new elevations for many Colorado peaks above 14,000 feet in a new study published in the Journal of Geodesy. Colorado has more than 50 “14ers,” or peaks above 14,000 feet, and they will get shorter when a new national vertical datum is implemented in 2025. The current mountain elevations were found to be too high by roughly 1 meter. Researchers developed a novel technique to redetermine the heights by drawing from the historical triangulation data measured in the 1950s, new airborne lidar data, and several current geoid models. Uncertainty estimates of the summit elevations are available for the first time, and the paper highlights differences in the geoid models available globally. The study emphasizes the importance of the upcoming modernization of the National Spatial Reference System, which is the foundation for all surveying and mapping in the U.S. Its modernization will significantly improve height accuracy.\n\nFor more information, contact: Kevin Ahlgren\n\nNGS Performs Space Geodesy Survey at NASA Observatory\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nNGS staff provided their surveying expertise to measure local tie vectors of four high-precision space geodetic technique, or SGT, instruments at NASA’s Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory in Greenbelt, Maryland. Tie vectors connect coordinate frames of different space geodetic techniques, and the Goddard Observatory is one of four sites in the world to host all four SGTs — Global Navigation Satellite System, Very Long Baseline Interferometry, Satellite Laser Ranging, and Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite — at a single location. The collocation of these SGTs is an essential part of the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service for current and future International Terrestrial Reference Frame, or ITRF, computations. The National Spatial Reference System and the NOAA Continuously Operating Reference Stations Network are aligned to the ITRF.\n\nFor more information, contact: Kevin Jordan\n\nNGS Collects Imagery after Bridge Collapse\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\nNGS conducted flights for imagery collection of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and surrounding channel to support NOAA nautical chart development, hazardous material removal, marine debris collection, and other coastal management needs. The flights produced expedited, updated shoreline information about the region around the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The collected data enabled the charting of the remaining bridge piers for a potential auxiliary channel and the updating of NOAA Electronic Navigational Charts. This data was shared with the appropriate local, state, and federal agencies responding to the event and conducting recovery efforts. The high-resolution imagery will be the event’s baseline dataset and will help inform anticipated engineering and debris removal.\n\nFor more information, contact: Mike Aslaksen\n\nU.S. and Canada Agree on Common Reference Frame Grid Format\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nNGS and the Canadian Geodetic Survey, or CGS, finalized a landmark agreement to use a common grid format, the Gridded Geodetic data eXchange Format. This common data format is expected to allow our two countries to more easily exchange and share data on positioning and navigation as the U.S. modernizes our nation’s coordinate system, the National Spatial Reference System, in 2025. The common data format will be the official format for all products and services released with the Modernized National Spatial Reference System. In addition, NGS has started to back-translate older grids into this format. NGS and CGS took this first collaborative step on common standards for the joint adoption of the North American Terrestrial Reference Frame of 2022 and the North American-Pacific Geopotential Datum of 2022 in 2025.\n\nFor more information, contact: Dru Smith\n\nNOAA and U.S. Geological Survey Launch Datums Working Group\n\nApril 2, 2024\n\nNGS, CO-OPS, and OCS staff joined National Weather Service and U.S. Geological Survey personnel, or USGS, to launch a new Datums Working Group as part of the NOAA-USGS Quarterly Meeting on Hydrology. A geodetic datum is a reference frame for precisely representing the position of locations on Earth. USGS, which maintains a national network of streamgages and water level stations, is preparing for the modernized National Spatial Reference System, the nation’s coordinate system, in 2025. USGS is also adapting its workflows for the releases of the North American-Pacific Geopotential Datum of 2022 and the National Tidal Datum Epoch in the next few years. The current epoch, established by CO-OPS, spans from 1981‒2001. The new epoch will span 2002‒2022. The working group is developing a charter and identifying initial topics for exploration.\n\nFor more information, contact: Philippe Hensel\n\nNGS Presents at Hydrographic Services Review Panel\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\nNGS delivered updates on their progress toward modernizing the National Spatial Reference System, or NSRS; on the Coastal Mapping Program; and on Emergency Response Imagery operations during the Spring 2024 Hydrographic Services Review Panel, or HSRP, virtual public meeting. NGS also led a session on the NGS Geospatial Modeling Grants and featured the principal investigators from the two West Coast grantees: Scripps Institute of Oceanography and Oregon State University. The HSRP approved an issue paper titled “Digital Twin: A Cornerstone for NOAA’s Coastal and Ocean Mapping Programs and Coastal Resilience” that includes a recommended series of actions for NOAA to support Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable data principles and the Modernized NSRS as an underlying foundation to support digital twin development.\n\nFor more information, contact: Galen Scott\n\nNGS Collects Lidar Data in the Caribbean\n\nMarch 15, 2024\n\nNGS crews are using a newly upgraded lidar sensor, with increased collection depth and better fidelity, to expeditiously fill in some data gaps from previous years’ collections while the weather is suitable in the Caribbean. These data collections continue to help us update the national shoreline and near-shore bathymetry data sets to bolster the nation's safety-of-navigation efforts. Using airborne lidar to gather topographic data fills the gap from where deep-water mapping efforts are unable to operate due to hazards. This continues our support of critical coastal activities ranging from marine planning to emergency response. The national shoreline is a key feature of nautical charts and must be updated periodically to reflect changes due to storms, flooding, sea level change, erosion, and subsidence.\n\nFor more information, contact: Mike Aslaksen\n\nPrototype GEOID2022 under Development\n\nMarch 8, 2024\n\nNGS released a prototype geoid model of the U.S. and its territories, known as the GEOID2022, to select key academic and international partners for evaluation. The model is a foundational component of the modernized National Spatial Reference System — or NSRS, the nation's coordinate system — which is expected to be released in 2025. The prototype will increase the accuracy and coverage of precise surface elevation measurements over land and water and will be used to initialize marine circulation models. The prototype will also communicate water-level forecasts and warnings for tsunamis, surges, flooding, and inundation. GEOID2022 develops a vertical reference of the earth’s surface and includes gravity data from the recently completed 16-year Gravity for the Redefinition of the American Vertical Datum, or GRAV-D project, which collected height data using aerial surveys. More geoid products and services will be released later in 2024.\n\nFor more information, contact: Shachak Peeri\n\nNGS Visits Alaska and Presents at Surveyors Conference\n\nMarch 1, 2024\n\nThe NGS Regional Advisor Branch chief, state plane coordinate system manager, and the Alaska regional geodetic advisor presented NGS updates at the Alaska Society of Professional Land Surveyors Conference. NGS plays a leading role in the state, updating critical geospatial infrastructure. Alaska is tectonically active, with the longest coastline in the nation and challenging weather and ocean conditions. The Regional Advisor Branch chief and the Alaska regional geodetic advisor visited the Alaska offices of OCM, OCS, NWS, and private sector partners. The NGS representatives also met with partners at EarthScope Consortium, the University of Alaska Anchorage, and the U.S. Geological Survey. .\n\nFor more information, contact: Christine Gallagher\n\nNGS Kicks Off Relative Gravity 2024 Project\n\nFebruary 23, 20214\n\nNGS staff began relative gravity surveys in North Carolina and Houston, Texas. These surveys have officially launched the NGS project, Relative Gravity 2024, or RelGrav2024, which was paid for with Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding related to geopotential modeling. This data will not be collected in time for inclusion in the first version of the North American-Pacific Geopotential Datum of 2022, but will help with future versions. NGS has been able to estimate gravity field uncertainties throughout the continental U.S. as they’ve been analyzing the gravity field information for the new vertical datum. These uncertainties, plus some other categories, will drive which areas are prioritized for relative gravity data collection. Other categories include areas with significant change in the gravity field or geoid slope, areas with greater population density, and areas with important infrastructure. The team plans to continue collecting data associated with RelGrav2024 in different locations throughout fiscal year 2024.\n\nFor more information, contact: Jeffery Johnson\n\nNGS Is a Founding Member of World Lidar Day\n\nFebruary 16, 2024\n\nNGS, along with many public and private partners, is a founding member of World Lidar Day, which will celebrate lidar and its expanding applications each year on February 12. The holiday will coincide with Geo Week, one of the world’s largest geospatial conferences. The NGS Remote Sensing Division and the Coastal Mapping Program have pushed the limits of lidar technology for the past two decades. Using lidar data collected from NOAA aircraft and the VDatum software tool to transform between tidal and geodetic datums, NGS developed the procedures for extracting the national shoreline for official U.S. nautical charts. NGS has driven advances in topobathy lidar to map the nearshore zone, dramatically increasing the efficiency of accurate data collection for nautical charts in shallow water. This lidar use also decreased the risks faced by NOAA’s hydrographic survey vessel crews, who historically mapped the nation’s shallow waters from small survey launches.\n\nFor more information, contact: Galen Scott\n\nWork Initiated on New Multiyear Reference Station Solution\n\nFebruary 12, 2024\n\nNGS is reprocessing all the data collected in the NOAA Continuously Operating Reference Stations Network since 1994 to align the National Spatial Reference System, or NSRS, to the latest realization of the International Terrestrial Reference System, known as ITRF2020. This work will help determine the transformation between the NSRS and ITRF2020, and this effort’s completion will mark a major milestone in the NSRS modernization. NGS completed the first iteration of running software known as Combination and Analysis of Terrestrial Reference Frames, or CATREF, to fit coordinate functions through each station’s data time-series.\n\nFor more information, contact: Phillip Mcfarland\n\nNGS Engages in Reference System Modernization Working Group\n\nFebruary 2, 2024\n\nNGS engaged in a working group with the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing to discuss technical and practical issues related to transitioning the geospatial community to the Modernized National Spatial Reference System. The group discussed geospatial data file formats that may need to be changed or updated to account for new or different types of values or metadata and considerations for fitting NGS tools into existing geospatial workflows. There was also a general discussion about how to get information out to a broader swath of users about the transition.\n\nFor more information, contact: Dru Smith\n\nNGS Performs Launch Surveys on NOAA Ships\n\nJanuary 26, 2024\n\nNGS Field Operations Branch personnel completed sensor surveys for multiple launches aboard NOAA Ships Ferdinand R. Hassler and Thomas Jefferson. These surveys, using terrestrial survey equipment, are performed by positioning the sensors aboard the small craft to precisely locate hydrographic survey data. In most cases, the team surveys the Inertial Measuring Unit, a device that measures gravitational forces; the transducer/receiver; and any GPS antennas onboard and then references to each vessel’s unique coordinate reference frame, marked by physical benchmarks on the craft. The crew surveyed in unique conditions with the launch from the Hassler still in the cradle while the ship was in floating dry dock. Then, the team surveyed two launches currently staged at the Marine Operations Center-Atlantic. These updated surveys provide onboard crews the ability to relate many types of geospatial data collected during their missions.\n\nFor more information, contact: Ryan Hippenstiel\n\nNGS Engages at American Geophysical Union Meeting\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\nSeven NGS scientists, including the senior advisor for geodesy, attended and presented at the hybrid American Geophysical Union, or AGU, Fall 2023 Meeting in San Francisco, California. The event attracted a large international community of Earth and space scientists who shared, disseminated, and discussed new Earth science research and ideas. Senior NGS scientists and geodesists from around the world considered the practical challenges of defining a terrestrial reference frame on a planet for which site motion is not constant anywhere. NGS geodesists discussed sharing a common path for vertical motion modeling with Natural Resources Canada scientists.\n\nFor more information, contact: Dan Roman\n\nOPUS-S Now Supports Data from Multiple Satellite Constellations\n\nJanuary 12, 2024\n\nNGS released the static version of its Online Positioning User Service, or OPUS-S version 5.0 software, to a beta server for external testing. OPUS-S 5.0 is the first major update to OPUS-S in years. The key improvement is support for multiple global navigation satellite systems, or GNSS. OPUS-S 5.0 is capable of processing static baselines with data from multiple satellite constellations. Other improvements are the inclusion of a new, daily Continuously Operating Reference Stations-quality metric in the algorithm used to select base stations, direct support for Receiver Independent Exchange Format (RINEX) version 3, and a small change to the solution report format. This release is expected to provide improved solution quality in various scenarios and keep OPUS relevant to the broader GNSS community.\n\nFor more information, contact: Nick.Forfinski-Sarkozi\n\nNGS Earns Award for Resolving Southeast Texas Heights Issue\n\nDecember 15, 2023\n\nNGS staff received an award from the Texas Department of Transportation surveyors for contributing to the repopulation of the region’s vertical control system. Accurate survey benchmarks and vertical control systems are essential infrastructure that allow engineers and surveyors to assess a region’s flood and earthquake risk and enable construction crews to build safe and stable housing and roads. In January 2021, NGS suppressed all but 28 of the publicly published vertical control heights for Southeast Texas because of regional land subsidence. Many from NGS were involved with the initial Southeast Texas heights issue and consulted with the Harris-Galveston Subsidence District. The team identified the problem, communicated with stakeholders, suppressed heights, and published new, accurate heights. As of August 2023, the valid vertical control marks in the region have grown from 28 to 312 total vertical marks, an 11-fold improvement. .\n\nFor more information, contact: Daniel Prouty\n\nNGS Engages at UN-Asia Pacific Geodetic Meeting\n\nDecember 8, 2023\n\nNOAA’s Senior Advisor for Geodesy participated in the Twelfth Plenary Meeting of the UN Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management Regional Committee for the Asia-Pacific in Bali, Indonesia. He presented on capacity and capability development during the Working Group on the Geodetic Reference Frame. He also discussed the National Spatial Reference System modernization with delegates from the Pacific Region, including Small Island Developing States represented by Fiji and Tonga. This demonstrated U.S. leadership and involvement in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on geospatial and positioning needs to address impacts from sea level and climate change.\n\nFor more information, contact: Dan Roman\n\nRecon Completed for New Reference Stations\n\nDecember 1, 2023\n\nNGS personnel accompanied and advised new installation and maintenance contractor staff during the contractor’s reconnaissance missions for upcoming NOAA Foundation Continuously Operating Reference Station, or FCORS, installations. The new FCORS contractor has successfully conducted reconnaissance for upcoming FCORS installations in Cold Bay, Alaska; Fairbanks, Alaska; Kitt Peak, Arizona; Pie Town, New Mexico; Fort Davis, Texas; and Apache Point, New Mexico. NOAA FCORS provide Global Navigation Satellite System data, supporting three-dimensional positioning, meteorology, space weather, and geophysical applications throughout the United States. The FCORS contractor will proceed with the development of reconnaissance reports and station designs over the next month, with the potential station installations starting in the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2024.\n\nFor more information, contact: Will Freeman\n\nNGS Participates at United Nations Geodetic Meeting\n\nNovember 17, 2023\n\nThe U.S. representative to the Geodetic Reference Frame for the Americas Working Group and the NGS Senior Advisor for Geodesy participated in the Tenth Plenary Meeting of the United Nations Regional Committee of Experts for Global Geospatial Information Management for the Americas in Santiago, Chile. They represented the U.S. in both the Academic Network of the Americas and during the Caribbean Geospatial, or CARIGEO, subregional meeting, providing updates on capacity and capability development for other nations in the Americas. This supported the implementation of a broader Americas Capacity Development Network that will result in improved coordination, modeling, and data collection in NOAA spheres of influence and concern. They also provided support to the lead U.S. Delegate and Federal Geographic Data Committee representative.\n\nFor more information, contact: Dan Roman\n\nNGS Releases 2024 Research Plan\n\nNovember 13, 2023\n\nNGS released their 2024 Research Plan. The plan explains the NGS vision to address the nation’s positioning and geodetic control needs for the next 10 to 15 years. The plan aligns with NOAA’s FY22-26 Strategic Plan — which is designed to help build a climate-ready nation — and recognizes the intrinsic connection between weather, water, and climate systems. NGS will hold a webinar Thursday, November 9, at 2 p.m. (Eastern) to further discuss their multidisciplinary research approach that is centered around geodesy using satellite observations. The approach is rooted in open science and open-source methods and is driven by stakeholder needs.\n\nFor more information, contact: Shachack Pe'eri\n\nNGS Presents at Hydrographic Services Review Panel\n\nNovember 6, 2023\n\nNGS Director Juliana Blackwell delivered progress updates on the National Spatial Reference System, or NSRS, modernization, the Coastal Mapping Program, and Emergency Response Imagery operations at the Fall 2023 Hydrographic Services Review Panel, or HSRP, public meeting in Silver Spring, Maryland. The HSRP advises NOAA about its navigation, physical oceanographic, geospatial, positioning, and coastal and shoreline programs, products, and services. Blackwell participated in a coastal resilience session and discussed the NGS’s history of supporting the use of accurate heights for coastal habitat monitoring and community resilience, and NGS Deputy Director Brad Kearse led a session titled “Geodesy Community of Practice: Addressing the Geodesy Crisis”. The geodesy crisis is the current shortage of American expertise and professionals trained in geodesy. The HSRP submitted an issue paper on the geodesy crisis and recommended a series of actions for NOAA to support NGS and the transition to the modernized NSRS and to help address shortages in the U.S. geodesy workforce.\n\nFor more information, contact: Galen Scott\n\nNGS Collects Images for Mississippi River Navigation\n\nOctober 27, 2023\n\nNGS provided input for the U.S. Coast Guard on determining water depths and safer navigation routes for the Mississippi River, which is experiencing all-time low water levels that are affecting barge traffic. In some cases, these low water levels require changes to one-way barge operations to avoid groundings. NGS has previous experience using a government-owned software package called RiverEye that uses highly overlapped satellite or aircraft imagery to determine current speeds and can infer water depth. NGS is collecting imagery to support this effort and working with the vendor to process the imagery as a demonstration of this capability.\n\nFor more information, contact: Mike Aslaksen\n\nNGS Attends Geodesy Community-of-Practice Meeting\n\nOctober 20, 2023\n\nNGS staff attended the in-person meeting of the Geodesy Community of Practice in St. Louis, Missouri. NGS, along with other Geodesy Community-of-Practice members, including the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, NASA, and the U.S. Geological Survey, combine efforts to coordinate resources and programs and advance the science of geodesy in the U.S. This meeting brought together the owners of separate terrestrial reference systems that define positions and navigation internationally, nationally, militarily, and in space. NGS, along with other meeting attendees, focused on developing a common framework for defining and maintaining the necessary infrastructure, models, and tools to support the national legal requirements for U.S. geospatial data. The results of this and subsequent meetings will inform the next draft of the Federal Geographic Data Committee's National Spatial Data Infrastructure Strategic Plan that will guide U.S. geospatial policy for the next five years.\n\nFor more information, contact: Dan Roman\n\nNGS Engages in Regional Land Motion Project’s Final Year\n\nOctober 13, 2023\n\nNGS hosted an equipment calibration exercise at the NGS Testing and Training Center for the fifth year of the Chesapeake Bay Regional Vertical Land Motion Project. The Chesapeake Bay area has the highest rate of relative sea level rise on the U.S. Atlantic Coast, and data indicate that vertical land motion is responsible for more than half of the relative sea level rise. Regional scientists from federal and state governments and academic institutions are working together to understand and measure land subsidence, sea level rise, and shoreline retreat. Since 2019, researchers have been collecting precise GPS measurements at 55 regional benchmark sites every October. Study results will inform area resilience and coastal management plans.

A CORS is a global-navigation satellite-system reference station that provides a region’s continuous real-time, high-accuracy positioning information. CORS data has many applications, including for surveying, construction, engineering, and mapping. Users enter a list of station names and a date range and receive time-series graphs showing deviations from the published coordinates. Users then receive a table showing the mean, standard deviation, and root mean square error of the residuals. Currently, NGS only offers time series plots for the entire data record of a station or the past 90 days. For processing projects older than 90 days, this tool will provide users with the critical data needed to choose the best stations for controlling their GPS projects.\n\nFor more information, contact: Jay Howard\n\nNGS Hosts International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters\n\nSeptember 5, 2023\n\nNOAA's Table Mountain Gravity Observatory near Boulder, Colorado, will host the International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters in August and September 2023. For six weeks, over 50 participants from 25 countries will meet in Boulder to verify the consistency of 38 instruments. Gravity meters measure the acceleration of a falling object near the Earth's surface. However, since there is no place on Earth where the value of gravity is exactly known, and no single, perfect instrument against which one can compare, scientists meet periodically to compare their instruments directly. These comparisons, which take place every four years, are certified by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sevres, France. This is the first international comparison held in North America, and it will be co-organized with researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Previous comparisons took place in Beijing, Luxembourg, and Paris.\n\nFor more information, contact: Derek vanWestrum\n\nNGS Provides Before-and-After Maui Images on NOAA Site\n\nAugust 28, 2023\n\nNGS uploaded high-resolution images of Maui’s wildfire-impacted areas collected from August 9 to 14.

The atomic clocks under development at NIST and the University of Colorado laboratories are so accurate that the slightest change in elevation — measured in millimeters — can impact their performance; consequently, they are routinely compared. The NOAA team determined precise height differences between the campuses and accurately measured the heights of specific reference points within the facilities. These measurements will help calculate the clocks’ elevations, which affects the highly stable frequencies that these clocks rely on to keep accurate time. These measurements will help the laboratories conduct research and further study.\n\nFor more information, contact: Ryan Hippenstiel or Chris Metzger\n\nNGS Performs Survey in Hawaii to Support Space Geodesy\n\nJune 16, 2023\n\nNGS staff conducted a local tie vector survey at the Kokee Park Geophysical Observatory in Kauai, Hawaii.

The crew flew more than 2,961 square kilometers over 17.9 hours and collected 6,866 images from specific areas identified by NOAA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, impacted states, and other federal agencies. Aerial imagery is a crucial tool that aids safe navigation, helps determine the extent of flooding and related damages, and enables comparisons of impacted regions to baseline coastal areas to assess damage to major ports and waterways, coastlines, critical infrastructure, and coastal communities. This imagery, which NGS provides through their website, supports the needs of the general public, as well as advanced applications, and provides a cost-effective way to evaluate the damage sustained to both property and the environment.\n\nFor more information, contact: Mike Aslaksen\n\nNew Global Reference Frames Released\n\nNovember 18, 2022\n\nIn October, the international Earth Rotation and Reference System Service — the body responsible for maintaining reference frame standards — released a new global reference system, the International Terrestrial Reference Frame 2020. The International Global Navigation Satellite System Service also recently released a new reference frame. These transitions will change some of the fundamental products used in GPS and global navigation satellite system data processing. This and other reference system updates should have no impact on users of NGS’s Online Positioning User Service (OPUS), however. The GPS data processing methods used by OPUS will mitigate changes in data processing and file name conventions without affecting user experience.\n\nFor more information, contact: Phillip Mcfarland\n\nNGS Releases New DSWorld Online Tool\n\nNovember 14, 2022\n\nNGS released a new DSWorld Upload Web Form for geospatial professionals and the public. DSWorld software is a free NGS application that provides users with up-to-date geodetic control information at the click of a button. The DSWorld Upload Web Form offers many of the same features as the application, but it also allows survey mark users to upload new photos, description files, and locations for existing datasheets.

The Chesapeake Bay region has the highest rate of relative sea level rise on the Atlantic coast, and data suggests that subsidence is responsible for more than half of the measured relative sea level rise. Scientists from federal agencies, state governments, and academic institutions have spent the last few years working together to measure land subsidence, sea level rise, and shoreline retreat to better understand whether impacts are due to global sea level rise or local, human activities. Each October, scientists collect precise measurements at 55 benchmark points throughout the region. Results of the study will inform resiliency plans and coastal management throughout the area. The project is a cooperative effort among NGS, the United States Geological Survey, and other partners.\n\nFor more information, contact: Phillippe Hensel\n\nNGS Web Map Released for Public Use\n\nOctober 28, 2022\n\nThe NGS Web Map, a free web map application, is now available to the public.

Two NGS staff members were panelists on a discussion of the recently published American Society of Civil Engineers manual of practice, “Surveying and Geomatics Engineering: Principles, Technologies, and Applications,” to which they both contributed as editors and authors. An NGS geodesist also received the American Society of Civil Engineers Surveying & Mapping Award for his work on the State Plane Coordinate System of 2022 and eliminating the U.S. survey foot.\n\nFor more information, contact: Michael Dennis\n\nNGS Collects Emergency Response Imagery for Hurricane Ian\n\nOctober 14, 2022\n\nFrom September 29 to October 3, NGS collected aerial images in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. The crew flew more than 16,322 square kilometers during 54.6 hours and collected 13,172 images. Imagery was collected in specific areas identified by NOAA and assigned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in coordination with impacted states and other federal agencies. NOAA’s aerial imagery aids safe navigation and captures damage to coastal areas caused by a storm. Aerial imagery is a crucial tool to determine the extent of damage inflicted by flooding, and to compare baseline coastal areas to assess damage to major ports and waterways, coastlines, critical infrastructure, and coastal communities. NGS delivers the imagery through this website that supports the general public needs as well as advanced applications. This imagery provides a cost-effective way to better understand the damage sustained to both property and the environment.\n\nFor more information, contact: Mike Aslaksen\n\nNGS Participates in International Surveyors Conference\n\nOctober 7, 2022\n\nThree NGS staff members participated in multiple events surrounding the International Federation of Surveyors (FIG) Congress on September 10–15 in Warsaw, Poland. NGS staff directly supported the Reference Frames in Practice (RFIP) group and the Young Surveyors Network (YSN) pre-event meetings as well as five other conference sessions during the week. The events also brought awareness of U.S. activities to modernize the National Spatial Reference System to the forefront of discussions—stimulating other nations to explore implementing the Global Geodetic Reference Frame.\n\nFor more information, contact: Dan Roman\n\nNGS and Partners Update Heights in Southern Louisiana\n\nSeptember 30, 2022\n\nNGS along with state and local partners completed a Global Navigation Satellite System project monitoring subsidence on bench marks and updating heights in southern Louisiana to better understand ongoing vertical crustal movement. This survey covered the 27 southern parishes of Louisiana, and updated the heights on 196 passive control marks. Final results from the project will contribute to the Modernized National Spatial Reference System and improve understanding of subsidence rates in the area. NGS has worked with constituents in Louisiana since the 1970s to monitor subsidence on bench marks and improve height measurements in the region.\n\nFor more information, contact: Denis Riordan\n\nNOAA and the Census Bureau Mark 2020 Center of Population\n\nSeptember 23, 2022\n\nNGS and the Census Bureau dedicated a commemorative survey mark designating Hartville, Missouri, as the 2020 center of population. The center of population is where an imaginary, flat, weightless, and rigid map of the United States would balance perfectly if all residents were of equal weight. This place represents the average location of where people in the United States live. Based on the 2020 census data, Hartville, Missouri, is the town closest to that point. “The 2020 center of population commemorative mark is a tribute to Hartville, the surveying community, and the science of geodesy,” said NGS Director Juliana Blackwell. “The commemorative mark represents the latest stop on the center of population trail, and its exact location and coordinates will be added into the National Spatial Reference System for use by surveyors, geocachers, and geospatial enthusiasts for decades to come.”\n\nFor more information, contact: Brian Ward\n\nNGS, Michigan Install New Reference Station at National Park\n\nSeptember 16, 2022\n\nNGS’s staff, along with partners from the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), traveled to Isle Royale National Park to install a new continuously operating reference station (CORS) at the request of the National Park Service. The NOAA CORS Network provides Global Navigation Satellite System data that supports 3D positioning, meteorology, space weather, and geophysical applications throughout the United States. This new station fills one of the network’s largest coverage gaps for the eastern United States. The station will benefit MDOT’s positioning coverage for its statewide network, as well as park activities and regional solutions for NGS’s Online Positioning User Service. The team also recovered and observed old bench marks from the 1955 International Great Lakes Datum that had not been visited in decades. This recovery work aids the ongoing survey campaign to update the International Great Lakes Datum.\n\nFor more information, contact: John Galetzka\n\nNGS Hosts Geospatial Industry Meeting\n\nSeptember 09, 2022\n\nNGS hosted representatives from leading global survey equipment manufacturers and geospatial software developers to discuss recent changes and future development plans for NGS’s Online Positioning User Service (OPUS). OPUS provides GPS users with free access to high-accuracy National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) coordinates by allowing them to submit their GPS data files to NGS for translation into NSRS positions. This meeting was part of an ongoing strategy to engage the geospatial community on OPUS and ensure that developers build tools that help NGS constituents reap the full benefits of the modernized NSRS. During the meeting, NGS proposed a more comprehensive standard file format, known as the Geodetic Data Exchange format, which would continue to support the exchange of Global Navigation Satellite System measurements, as well as leveling, angle, distance, azimuth, and relative gravity measurements. NGS also provided updates on ongoing and future OPUS developments.\n\nFor more information, contact: Daniel Gillins or Galen Scott\n\nNGS Begins Gravity Survey from Kansas to New York\n\nAugust 26, 2022\n\nNGS has deployed a terrestrial gravity specialist to undertake an absolute gravity survey from Kansas to New York, including numerous stations throughout the Great Lakes region. The survey supports NGS’s Geoid Monitoring Service which captures and monitors time-dependent changes to the geoid — a model of global mean sea level used to measure precise surface elevations — and gravity field to provide more accurate positioning in space and time. The gravity field in this region is undergoing significant changes due to mass movements within the Earth caused by the glacial masses that covered this region 10,000 years ago. A few of these stations were observed in the late 1980s. However, NGS periodically re-observes these stations to maintain the highest levels of accuracy. This survey benefits federal, state, and academic partners that require accurate and precise gravity information to better support their missions.\n\nFor more information, contact: Kevin Ahlgren or Jeff Kanney\n\nNGS Participates in United Nations Geospatial Session\n\nAugust 19, 2022\n\nNGS’s Chief Geodesist and the U.S. representative to the Sistema de Referencia Geocentrico para las Americas attended the 12th session of the United Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management. Their participation strengthened relationships with other nations, which will help address areas of mutual interest. Participants agreed that there is a need for enhanced technical relationships between the marine and terrestrial domains — to better measure and understand physical height interactions between land and water. Participating in the meeting also bolstered NGS's relationships with federal partners and within NOAA, particularly to the Office of Coast Survey.\n\nFor more information, contact: Dan Roman or Dana Caccamise\n\nAugust 12, 2022\n\nSurveyors from the Canadian and American governments are in the Great Lakes region for a six-week project collecting Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) data at over 350 locations as part of an update to the International Great Lakes Datum (IGLD). The IGLD is the common reference system used to measure water level heights throughout the Great Lakes‐St. Lawrence River System, providing support for marine navigation, water level regulation, water management, surveying, mapping, and shoreline-use planning. Updates to the IGLD occur every 25 to 30 years to account for the movement of the Earth’s crust. This is the first update to use GNSS data. Updating the IGLD will benefit its many applications, including lake level forecasting and hydroelectric power regulation, as well as water level measurements.\n\nFor more information, contact: Vicki Childers\n\nNGS Aligns National System to Global Reference Frame\n\nAugust 5, 2022\n\nThe International Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Service, which provides GNSS data products globally, recently released a new GNSS-only version of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame. This provides GNSS users access to the reference frame through coordinate functions for a global set of reference stations. In response, NGS will soon compute the multiyear Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) Solution 3, which will modernize the National Spatial Reference System. Aligning the National Spatial Reference System with the updated global reference frame will allow greater access for the global community of scientists, educators, and commercial users of location science.\n\nFor more information, contact: Phillip McFarland\n\nNGS Edits Surveying and Geomatics Manual\n\nJuly 29, 2022\n\nNGS sponsored Surveying and Geomatics Engineering: Principles, Technologies, and Applications, recently published by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

On May 17, Alaska joined Washington and Kentucky by passing HB 148, “An Act relating to the Alaska Coordinate System of 2022.” Once signed into law, this legislation will create the Alaska Coordinate System of 2022, define the Alaska Coordinate System via connection to the federally defined State Plane Coordinate System maintained by NGS, and clarify use of the U.S. Survey Foot in the Alaska Coordinate System. NGS provided technical assistance to organizations developing template legislation to aid states in modernizing their coordinate system legislation.\n\nFor more information, contact: Nicole Kinsman\n\nNGS, OCS Find New Uses for Shipborne Data\n\nJune 3, 2022\n\nNGS and OCS collaborated to improve the geoid model in the Great Lakes region. NGS uses gravity data to develop and improve its geoid models of the Earth. Unique gravity signatures over the Great Lakes require higher-density gravity data to better determine the shape of the geoid in that area. In 2022, NOAA Ship Thomas Jefferson collected a variety of data throughout Lake Erie, using the ship’s hydrographic survey suite and tools that measure acceleration. NGS scientists used this data to determine the acceleration due to gravity during the transit through the St. Lawrence Seaway and throughout the survey area.\n\nFor more information, contact: Xiaopeng Li ops thomas jefferson\n\nMay 27, 2022\n\nLast summer, NGS introduced new web-based tools for submitting geodetic survey data through its Online Positioning User Service (OPUS) Projects 4.0, allowing users nationwide to increase the number and volume of submitted survey data. The web-based tools offer an easy, intuitive way to manage and process geodetic survey projects involving multiple sites and multiple occupations. A quote in a recent California Department of Transportation newsletter called the tool “a great way to process, manage and share high-quality geodetic control with the geospatial community. It can reduce time spent researching by having data in a nationally maintained, recognized, and accessible online location.” NGS relies on federal, state, and local partners to supply geodetic-quality data to maintain the National Spatial Reference System.\n\nFor more information, contact: Boris Kanazir\n\nNGS Provides Geodetic Braced Monument Installation Training\n\nMay 24, 2022\n\nThe NGS Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) and Field Operations branches began a series of workshops to train local, state, and federal agencies around the country to build geodetic braced monuments. Following a workshop in Arizona in early April, staff from NGS, the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services, North Carolina Geodetic Survey, and North Carolina Department of Transportation held a workshop in Knotts Island, North Carolina, where they completed a driven braced monument. This monument design will result in improved stability, longevity, and electromagnetic behavior. NGS is planning more workshops, as well as an installation manual and instructional videos.\n\nFor more information, contact: John Galetzka\n\nNOS Meets with Cuban Counterparts\n\nMay 13, 202\n\nSenior leaders from NGS, the Office of Coast Survey, and Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services met with leadership from Cuba's National Office of Hydrography and Geodesy in April to provide navigation, observation, and positioning updates under a Memorandum of Understanding. The group discussed data from continuous Global Navigation Satellite System receivers in Cuba and the potential expansion of the Gravity for the Redefinition of the Vertical Datum program over Cuba. Both of these efforts would enhance the accuracy and reliability of the Caribbean Terrestrial Reference Frame of 2022 and North American-Pacific Geopotential Datum of 2022 for the Caribbean region and the southern United States.\n\nFor more information, contact: Dan Roman\n\nNGS Measurements Improve Time Accuracy\n\nMay 6, 2022\n\nNGS height measurements helped scientists working to improve the accuracy of the second as a measurement of time and helped validate the theory of general relativity. A recent New York Times article, reprinted in the Seattle Times, explained the worldwide effort by scientists to improve the accuracy of the second by developing optical atomic clocks. In 2015, scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did not understand why three optical atomic clocks at different labs in Boulder, Colorado, measured slightly different times. The theory of general relativity predicts that elevation differences among clocks will affect the passage of time. Surveyors identified height differences among the three clocks, and NGS geodesist Derek van Westrum verified that their different time measurements could be explained by height-related changes in the gravity field. Van Westrum and NIST researchers continue to collaborate, aiming to measure gravity changes with atomic clocks.\n\nFor more information, contact: Derek VanWestrum\n\nTrain the Trainer Geodetic Leveling Session\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\nIn April, staff at the NGS Testing and Training Center near Fredericksburg, Virginia, provided training on geodetic leveling data collection and blue-booking procedures to the director of the Texas Spatial Reference Center and the field crew operations chief of the Conrad Blucher Institute. The director and operations chief can now train others interested in these geodetic procedures back in their home state of Texas. Since March 2001, NGS has worked with regional stakeholders to help them obtain updated height information for dynamic areas like southeast Texas.\n\nFor more information, contact: Kendall Fancher\n\nNGS Supports Student Surveying Competition\n\nApril 22, 2022\n\nThe National Society of Professional Surveyors held their annual student competition on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Students from surveying programs at 12 universities across the country participated in the two-day event. The first day was a scavenger hunt where the student teams explored geodetic and boundary marks all around the D.C. metro area. The second day consisted of a traverse and a leveling loop at Benjamin Banneker Park, and a triangulation exercise near the Washington Monument. Two NGS staff members attended the in-person event and demonstrated how to access the geodetic control built into the Washington Monument and discussed NGS activities on the mall over the years. NGS staff take part in this and other student events throughout the year to support and mentor the next generation of surveyors and geodesists.\n\nFor more information, contact: Jacob Heck\n\nNGS Improves Geodetic Infrastructure in Arizona\n\nApril 15, 2022\n\nNGS staff spent time in Arizona recently, inspecting and repairing geodetic infrastructure. The Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) branch chief and the southwest regional advisor collaborated during a weeklong tour in the area. They completed a reconnaissance survey of a proposed site for a Foundation CORS Global Navigation Satellite System at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson. They also completed spot checks at several Arizona CORS sites, bringing non-operational CORS back online with help from local, state, and federal partners. NGS hosted a two-day workshop with the city of Phoenix, discussing how and why to build a braced geodetic monument at a proposed CORS site. NGS also partnered with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Flagstaff Science Center and staff from the Arizona Department of Transportation to increase the sampling rate and data quality of a station on the Grand Canyon’s south rim, in preparation for an upcoming survey of the Colorado River.\n\nFor more information, contact: John Galetzka\n\nNGS, Partners Survey Indian River Lagoon\n\nApril 4, 2022\n\nNGS and partners are collecting topo-bathymetric lidar and imagery data (an underwater map) of the Indian River Lagoon. An NGS contractor is collecting data using a plane equipped with a bathymetric lidar sensor that can penetrate more than 240 feet of water. The sensor will record elevation and depth data within a 616-square-mile area. The current bathymetry data for the lagoon was created in the late 1990s. Since then, seagrass has decreased significantly in the lagoon and sediments may have shifted. Having updated bathymetry information will help create better models to predict storm surge and flooding and will assist in planning for increased resilience in coastal communities experiencing sea level rise. NGS is partnering with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the St. John’s River Water Management District on this project.\n\nFor more information, contact: Mike Aslaksen\n\nNew Version of NGS Coordinate Conversion Tool\n\nMarch 25, 2022\n\nNGS released an updated version of its free online NGS Coordinate Conversion and Transformation Tool, which allows users to convert between different coordinate systems and transform between different reference frames and datums in a single step. Version 2.1 adds options to specify height units and to customize export data, more FAQs, and a link to the source code. Video tutorials and in-depth FAQ lists are available online for surveyors and geodesists new to the software.\n\nFor more information, contact: Krishna Tadepalli\n\nNGS Presents at Hydrographic Services Review Panel\n\nMarch 18, 2022\n\nAt the Hydrographic Services Review Panel's virtual public meeting, NGS Director Juliana Blackwell delivered a progress update on the modernization of the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS), provided an overview of Coastal Mapping Program operations, and gave a high-level summary of potential supplemental funding opportunities.
