        "text": "I've just bought a Shimano Sora Front Hub (HB 3300) and I want to try and get all the bits I would need to try & build a wheel up myself.\n\nNot having tried this before can anyone help in respect of what type / length of spokes I would need for a 700c wheel build (probably for a 700c x 28 / 32).\n\n0\n\ndepends on what lacing you want, rim depth, hub flange size.\n\nthere are a few web sites that have calculators on them.\n\nDT swiss used to have a calculator, I tried several sites but due to my setup, they gave me 3 different sizes, each within 2mm of each other.\n\nAfter talking to my lbs, he said the difference between spoke sizes were negligible and to use one size.\n\nThis made sense to me as i this was for our touring bikes and didn't want to take 3 different spoke sizes with me.\n\n--\n\nBurls Ti Tourer for Tarmac, Saracen aluminium full suss for trails\n\n0\n\nI find the wheelsmith spoke calculator to be the most accurate. Although you have to input the hub/rim measurements manually.\n\nFor spokes use dt-comps and brass nipples. Soak the nipples in light oil before using them and use a decent spoke key, I like the park ones but the spokey style ones are the best IMO. Particularly the m-part workshop grade one which has two inserts to support almost all the square section of the nipple.\n\n0\n\nI've used Wheelpro to find the spokes I needed for the builds I've done. You do need to get some measurements off the hub aswell but a bit of time here can save a lot of problems later.\n\nI've added a signature to prove it is still possible.\n\n0"
