        "text": "Enacted in 1986, the federal low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) was created to advance the production and preservation of affordable housing. Each state allocates LIHTC to qualified affordable housing developers who then sell them to an investor, or to a tax-credit syndication fund made up of equity from one or from many investors. In return, the investors receive a credit against their federal income tax based on the size of their investments.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nNEF has been a pioneer in permanent supportive housing since the very first days of LIHTC. Our supportive housing leaders are advocates for the most vulnerable individuals and families, experts in the planning and operation that goes into these developments and knowledgeable about government programs and policies that can help families and individuals to thrive.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nNEF's Emerging Minority Developer Fund (EMDF) was designed to create access to equity capital resources to facilitate accelerated development capacity and wealth creation for Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) developers who have not had proportionate and consistent access to LIHTC. With our investor partners, we have committed capital for the Fund well exceeding our original $100 million target.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nRenovations Begin at Encino Gardens' 165 Affordable Units for Seniors in Albuquerque\n\nIn late June, a groundbreaking ceremony was held to celebrate the beginning of the rehabilitation of Encino Gardens, a senior housing community in Albuquerque.
