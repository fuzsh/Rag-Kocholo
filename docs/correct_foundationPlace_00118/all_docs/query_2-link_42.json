While we want to pop bottles and celebrate we all need to remain cautiously optimistic BUT they did improve so we are taking this win. She is now down to 3 liters of oxygen per minute and doing very well. Still no side effects from the new antibiotics and she is eating like crazy. They will monitor her overnight and if all goes well we will lower her down to 2 liters tomorrow. One thing the doctor said is while there is lung improvement there is still one area on her right lung that presents very white. When lungs are x-rayed they should appear black so this white area is something they will be watching closely. She is doing a lot of sneezing and does cough a bit but they see this as a positive because it may be breaking up all that has been laying dormant. Movement is good. We are taking this day by day and have paid up until Friday. We will not be letting her leave the hospital until she has had TWO full days off of oxygen without issue. Slow and steady, staying smart and measures and so far so good. Her skin has also made really good improvement. She is obsessed with her stuffy and will not put it down for anything. We love her so fucking much. Please please please keep sending her every bit of love you have. \n\nThank you @hoa_o_huluhulu_ for your unwavering dedication to Viola. Bringing her food, giving her massages and making her feel seen and loved. You are incredible and beyond appreciated. \n\nThank you to all who have donated. Today we crossed over the 50k mark. It's an insane amount of money but she is a critical patient getting round the clock care. This is what happens when a dog is failed repeatedly by our species. It's a long road and Viola is worth it. If you're able to contribute, you can at the links in our BIO. \n\nLets go VIOLA!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️\n\n#standupforpits #viola #endabuse #betheirvoice #inherentlygood\".",
