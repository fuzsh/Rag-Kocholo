        "text": "Sarah Messenger—WINNER!\n\nI wanted to nominate a nurse with the biggest heart in the world! Sarah Messenger RN at the Mountain View Infusion Center was working the other day when we had a young man who only spoke Spanish came in who was very ill and needed to be admitted to the hospital to save his life. The patient refused to be admitted due to having a 1 year old child at home that he needed to care for. Sarah immediately called her husband and explained the situation and they decided they would take the little child into their home and care for the child so the patient could be admitted to the hospital.\n\nSarah herself has suffered with her own health problems and didn’t hesitate to help a stranger in need. It’s so great to work with people who show so much compassion to our patients, it shows how much tenderness can reach far beyond words, even language barriers. Such a privilege to work with Sarah!\n\nLaurie Soliday—RUNNER UP!\n\nI would like to nominate Laurie Soliday for the Commitment to Excellence award. Please see the email from Mr. Bautista regarding her. She is a great asset to our Insurance Follow Up/Denials team and she is the Team Lead for the Contract Manager Team. She knows her insurance contracts inside and out and that helps tremendously in the appeals process.\n\nMs. Weisert,\n\nI am writing you to sing the praises of Laurie Soliday. I had some surgery back in March of this year, and had some insurance hiccups, but Laurie has been helping me over the last few months, and I have never had a better interaction with any sort of billing / insurance than I have had with Laurie.\n\nShe has been extremely helpful, her knowledge of her system and the insurance companies system has shown to be extensive. She has always been cheerful, and demonstrated a genuine willingness to help me navigate the minefield that dealing with insurance can sometimes be.\n\nYou have an exceptional employee, and a genuinely good person working on your staff. She brings great credit to your organization. Thank you, and please feel free to again give my thanks to her, and let her know she is doing a wonderful job.\n\nV/R, Michael Bautista\n\nKimm Kapp\n\nKim is always going above and beyond at everything she does. Kim puts her job first and foremost. She is a hard worker and is very knowledgeable. She has fantastic communication skills, and is always on her \"A Game\". Kim is always lending a hand to help anyone with anything she can. She will go the extra mile for anyone. She cares so much for our patients and always assures that their visit is warm and welcoming. Kim is passionate about her job and has a fun sense of humor. ​\n\nBrandi Watt\n\nI would like to nominate Brandi Watt. She took a huge risk coming to us to help us build our NICU. She has created policies, helped order the needed equipment, and educated all our staff to the special care needed for our littlest babies. We would not be able to be doing what we are doing without all her efforts. However the biggest reason I want to nominate her is her constant willingness to come in and help when help is needed. She is part time and usually works full time hours. She is available all hours for staff to call if they have questions. She comes in with preterm or sick infants to help get them settled, and usually stays until the nurses feel confident with the care. She is constantly working on improving our education, and coming up with clever ways to not only make it educational, but also fun for the nurses. She has been able to instill confidence in our nurses, and teaches in a way that never makes anyone feel stupid or incompetent. She is a tremendous asset to our unit, and deserve the recognition for what she has brought to us.\n\nWhat does commitment mean? The standard definition reads “the state of being dedicated to a cause, activity, etc.” The quarterly Commitment to Excellence award is for those employees who exemplify this definition. Look around-do you work with someone who fits this definition? Chances are you do. Maybe it’s the nurse that worked past the end of her shift to make sure the new mom was comfortable. Maybe it is the admissions clerk who spent extra time with the patient to help them understand how their insurance works, or maybe it’s the cashier in the cafeteria who always greets you with a smile and makes sure you get the cookie you like.\n\nPlease take a minute and submit a nomination for these outstanding employees. You can send directly to klefler@mvhospital.net."
