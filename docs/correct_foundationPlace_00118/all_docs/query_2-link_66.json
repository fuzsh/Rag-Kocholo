After migrating to Hawai‘i, she founded the Paul and Vi Loo Theater at Hawaii Loa College.\n\nWhen Dwayne Steele was a little boy growing up in Kansas, he could not have imagined he would become “Nakila” Steele in his adopted Hawai‘i, the quiet benefactor of a community school dedicated to perpetuating the traditional Hawaiian dialect of remote Ni’ihau."
