        "text": "Listening in on Earth‚Äôs largest animal üêã üé∂ With the blue whale‚Äôs massive size comes a massive appetite. But isn‚Äôt always easy finding their primary food source‚Äîkrill‚Äîin the vast and dynamic waters of the ocean. How do these gentle giants find food and survive? The Blue Whale Observatory is a network of acoustic instruments in Monterey Bay that aims to answer this question. The observatory records whale calls, krill swarm activity, and ocean conditions for four months straight every summer and fall when blue whales are most acoustically active in the area. These detailed recordings reveal more about the predator, prey, and environmental dynamics that drive blue whales‚Äô behavior. Findings from the Blue Whale Observatory can inform efforts to protect these endangered mammals. They also open up possibilities for studying other marine species in a similar way. Learning more about the dynamics of ocean life‚Äîfrom the tiniest krill to the largest whale‚Äîcan help us become better stewards of our blue planet. üåé üê≥ Learn more about the Blue Whale Observatory at: https://lnkd.in/ggmRH_TB\n\nIn 2014, we teamed up with The David and Lucile Packard Foundation to launch the Youth Champions Initiative. A decade later, we‚Äôre celebrating the impact of 100 Youth Champions advancing the sexual and reproductive health and rights movement around the world. üåç‚ú® We are deeply grateful for the Packard Foundation‚Äôs partnership. Read our impact report here: bit.ly/RiseUp15YearReport to learn more about the incredible progress we‚Äôve made together. #RiseUp15 #SRHR"
