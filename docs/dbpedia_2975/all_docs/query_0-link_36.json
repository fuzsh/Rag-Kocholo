[...]\n\nBecause of its acute effects to human health and the environment, EPA is proposing to prohibit treatment by OB/OD of mixed wastes containing more than trace amounts of DU.\n\nComments must be received on or before May 20, 2024.\n\n> Federal Register Volume 89, Number 55 (Wednesday, March 20, 2024)] p. 19952-20030 (download full text )\n\nDepleted uranium projectile found in landfill at York, Pennsylvania\n\n[...] the US Army is (telephone) reporting the recovery of a 120 mm depleted uranium (DU) projectile from a landfill in York, PA.\n\nAn M829 120 mm DU projectile has 4000 grams of DU, which equates to approximately 1,520 microcuries [56.24 MBq] of U-238. The M829 DU projectile was manufactured in the 1970's - 1980's.\n\nDose rate on contact is 1-2 mrem/hr [10-20 µSv/h], so exposure exceeding limits to public is unlikely.\n\n(NRC Event Notification Report for January 04, 2024, Event Number: 56909 )\n\nArmy Installation Command requests relaxation of environmental monitoring requirements for depleted uranium munitions test areas\n\nBy letter dated Sep. 30, 2019, the Army Installation Command requests NRC to approve the elimination of the requirement for surface water sampling for uranium and change the requirement for sediment sampling from quarterly to semiannual.\n\n> Download: Revised Final Environmental Radiation Monitoring Plan for Materials License SUC-1593, Docket No. 040-09083 , Sep. 2019 (96MB PDF)\n\nMonitoring finds no depleted uranium spreading into environment from U.S. Army installations possessing M101 spotting rounds and fragments\n\nEnvironmental radiation monitoring (ERM) activities were conducted at 14 U.S. Army garrisons named in the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) source material license (SML) number SUC-1593 for the possession of M101 depleted uranium (DU) spotting rounds and fragments. During quarterly sampling events, collocated surface water and sediment samples were collected from points downstream from the radiation control areas (RCAs) to determine if any DU is leaving the RCAs.\n\nThe radiological analysis results for uranium are used to distinguish natural uranium from DU. The U-238 to U-234 activity ratio and the weight percent U-235 are used to determine whether a given sample is indicative of natural, depleted, or enriched uranium. U-238/U-234 activity ratios of 3.0 or less are representative of natural uranium, whereas higher ratios are potentially indicative of DU. Activity ratios for U-238/U-234 that exceed 3.0 (including total propagated uncertainty [TPU]) determined through alpha spectrometry are investigated further to validate whether a sample result is representative of DU or natural uranium.\n\nNone of the U-238/U-234 activity ratios for any samples collected during ERM activities at any of the 14 garrisons exceeded the threshold of 3.0; therefore, the ICP-MS confirmatory analysis was not completed for any samples.\n\n> Download: Final Radiation Monitoring Report Summary of Results for 2018 Sampling Events for Materials License SUC-1593, Docket No. 040-09083 , April 2019 (24 MB PDF)\n\n> See also: NRC licencing of US Army Installation Command's possession of M101 spotting rounds\n\n> See also: DU munitions use at Pohakuloa Training Area, Big Island, Hawaii\n\n> See also: DU munitions use at Schofield Barracks Firing Range, Oahu, Hawaii\n\nIdentification of Depleted Uranium on U.S. Military Ranges and its Licensing Status\n\nNo further unlicensed depleted uranium discovered on U.S. military ranges: \"Based on the NRC staff's extensive review of its own historical records and the reviews performed by the military as documented in their responses, the staff has concluded that current military possession of DU is appropriately authorized by an NRC license or being addressed through the MOU between the NRC and DoD for Coordination on CERCLA Response Actions at DoD Sites with Radioactive Materials. Therefore, no further action is warranted on this issue at this time.\"\n\n> Download: Results of Implementation Plan to Identify Depleted Uranium on Military Ranges and Determine Its Licensing Status , U.S. NRC, Sep. 3, 2020\n\nNRC releases Implementation Plan for Identification of Depleted Uranium on U.S. Military Ranges and its Licensing Status: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff developed this implementation plan to identify depleted uranium (DU) spent munitions, armor, and other items, used on U.S. military ranges (for training and other purposes) and determine its licensing status. The plan's primary objective is to provide the strategy that will enable the NRC to confirm that all DU on active or inactive military ranges is either authorized by an NRC license or addressed through the NRC/U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for Coordination on Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Response Actions at DoD Sites with Radioactive Materials.\n\n> Download: Implementation Plan For Identification Of Depleted Uranium On U.S. Military Ranges And Its Licensing Status , Feb. 22, 2019 (451kB PDF)\n\n> Download: Memorandum Of Understanding between the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the United States Department Of Defense for Coordination on CERCLA Response Actions at DOD Sites with Radioactive Materials , Apr. 28, 2016 (580kB PDF)\n\nNRC will hold a public meeting to confirm oversight of DU on firing ranges on May 31, 2019.\n\n> Download: Public Meeting Announcement · Meeting Slides\n\n> View meeting details\n\nNRC licencing of US Army Installation Command's possession of M101 spotting rounds\n\nM101 depleted uranium spotting rounds found outside Radiation Control Area at Joint Base Lewis-McChord (Washington): On 12 May 2022, the JBLM garrison Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) reported to the License RSO that an explosive ordnance disposal contractor doing range maintenance found remnants of a M101 depleted uranium (DU) spotting round outside an Radiation Control Area (RCA) at Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM).

Depleted uranium, as much as 600 pounds, is thought to be in the ground at several sites from training shells fired in a 1960s classified program to give soldiers a nuclear-tipped bazooka called the Davy Crockett, according to Army documents. The training rounds were smaller spotting shells to train crews on the use of the atomic weapon without the big boom and a mushroom cloud. The Davy Crockett was never fired in combat.\n\nSince discovering the uranium munitions in Hawaii in 2005, the service has done 10 years of detective work to figure out which bases participated in the testing program. The Army says 12,405 acres may have been contaminated during the Davy Crockett days. Fort Carson is joined on the roster by installations in Hawaii, Washington state, Georgia, Kentucky, Kansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, South Carolina and California.\n\nFort Carson says no depleted uranium was found during post inspections, which included use of radiation detectors. But poor record-keeping in the 1960s leaves the issue in doubt. It is known that troops trained with the weapon at Fort Carson. And training, the Army's Installation Management Command in Texas surmised, likely left depleted uranium residue - a low-radiation byproduct of uranium enrichment for reactors and weapons. \"The Army's position is that the Army fired the M101 spotting round from the Davy Crockett weapons system at Fort Carson,\" said Army Installation Management Command spokeswoman Cathy Kropp.\n\nThe Army says the waste at Fort Carson and other installations is too expensive to clean up - the cost is estimated at more than $300 million nationwide and $25 million in Colorado. So it is asking the federal nuclear watchdog agency for permission to leave the waste where it may have been for 50 years - in the soil of Colorado and 11 other states.

Additional installations where the M101 spotting round has been found include: Fort Benning, GA; Fort Campbell, KY; Fort Carson, CO; Fort Hood, TX; Fort Knox, KY; Fort Lewis, WA; Fort Riley, KS; Schofield Barracks, HI; and Pohakuloa Training Area, HI. Installations currently subject to further investigation include: Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; Fort Dix, NJ; and Makua Military Reservation, HI. A common characteristic of the sites where the M1 01 spotting round fragments are located is that they are well within the installation boundary and are located in an impact area where access is strictly controlled.\n\nA total of 75,318 M101 spotting rounds were originally produced. Each depleted uranium projectile body weighed about 206 g. Given a composition of 92 percent depleted uranium and 8 percent molybdenum, 190 g of depleted uranium was contained within each round.\n\nThis U.S. NRC license application is for authorization to possess and manage depleted uranium present at US Army installations as a result of previous use of depleted uranium. Specific functions to be performed under the license will be limited to radiological surveys as necessary to fully characterize the nature and extent of contamination and, when appropriate, to obtain information necessary to support development of decommissioning plans.

All closed, transferred, and transferring military ranges will be identified. A range assessment will be conducted in which a site-specific accelerated response (various options for protective measures, including monitoring) will be implemented. If these measures are not sufficient, a more detailed site- specific range evaluation will be conducted.

Depleted Uranium\n\nDepleted uranium (DU) is a byproduct of the uranium enrichment processes. DU is used in the commercial sector by the aircraft industry as counterweights, by the power industry as radiation shielding, and by the military as an armor-piercing projectile due to its hardness, strength, and density. DU's potential radiation exposure is small. As an alpha particle emitter, its radiation does not penetrate human skin or even ordinary paper.

Soil samples from these military facilities were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction to determine U concentrations and transport across an arid ecosystem. Under arid conditions, both vertical transport driven by evaporation (upward) and leaching (downward) and horizontal transport of U driven by surface runoff in the summer were observed. Upward vertical transport was simulated and confirmed under laboratory-controlled conditions, to be leading to the surface due to capillary action via evaporation during alternating wetting and drying conditions. In the field, the 92.8% of U from DU penetrators and fragments remained in the top 5 cm of soil and decreased to background concentrations in less than 20 cm. In locations prone to high amounts of water runoff, U concentrations were reduced significantly after 20 m from the source due to high surface runoff.

The Army used weapons containing depleted uranium in Hawaii in the 1960s. Last fall, the Army took more than 1,400 soil, water and air samples at Schofield. The level for acceptable risk set by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is 1 in 10,000. The maximum found at Schofield was 3 in 100,000, Army officials said. \"It's well below the EPA and NRC levels. So, we are saying that it is safe,\" said Howard Takata of the state Department of Health. The panel of experts that weighed in on the independent study concurred. The small amount of DU was found in large fragments, which made it unlikely that the contaminant could be airborne in dust, according to panel members. The Army said records show some 714 rounds containing the radioactive waste were sent to Hawaii. Only about 30 were found at Schofield Barracks firing range.

The former firing range near Madison, Ind., is where the Army conducted ammunition tests from 1941 to 1995, leaving behind more than 160,000 pounds of depleted-uranium shell fragments plus millions of unexploded conventional shells, live detonators, primers or fuses.\n\nKen Westlake, a regional coordinator for the Environmental Protection Agency, wrote in a letter that the agency understands that it may not be feasible to clean up remaining unexploded ordnance due to safety and cost issues. Still, the Army's required environmental-impact statement should examine alternatives including \"benefit-costs analysis for each alternative, with special emphasis on modeled future health and environmental costs to society that may occur as a direct result of water and/or air pollution,\" Westlake wrote.\n\nWestlake's letter states that each alternative also should explain who will be responsible for humans and wildlife at the site, which, according to a state inventory has been home to several species listed as either federally or state endangered, such as the Indiana bat, Henslow's sparrow and Sedge wren. And if the Army continues proposing to stop environmental monitoring, Westlake said its plan should \"provide rationale for the decision not to monitor, preferably using data from other, similar sites, and explain what plans are in place to ensure any future contaminant movement is remediated before migrating off-site.\" (Courier Journal Mar. 13, 2015)\n\nCritics attack plan to leave mess at DU munitions test area at Jefferson Proving Ground\n\nCritics say it would be a bad precedent to let the U.S. Army retreat from the task of cleaning up or even monitoring the site in Southern Indiana where live-fire tests left behind more than 160,000 pounds of depleted uranium shell fragments plus millions of unexploded conventional shells. \"It's a travesty that the Army might walk away without doing a detailed analysis of how they could clean it up,\" said Lenny Siegel, executive director of the California-based Center for Public Environmental Oversight .

Although the Army stopped testing depleted uranium in 1994 at the former proving ground, there still is not a decommissioning plan in place, the panel pointed out.\n\nThe Army left about 77 tons of DU projectiles and fragments where they landed in a 2,080-acre area that now is fenced and posted with signs warning of radioactivity.\n\nThe administrative law judges, in a memorandum issued June 3, 2008, said the Army is largely to blame for there not being a plan in place and the likelihood that one won't be submitted until 2011. But the blame has to be shared by the NRC staff, which they wrote has \"a more than casual attitude ... with regard to the decommissioning of sites on which radioactive materials remain as a potential threat to public health and safety and to the environment.\" \"The inescapable fact remains, however, that, at the very least, the staff has countenanced in that matter a situation that will leave the citizens in the area surrounding the activity site in doubt for close to two decades regarding what measures will ultimately be taken for their protection,\" the panel wrote.\n\nThe panel wrote its criticism in a memorandum to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about the slowness of progress to decommission Shieldalloy Metallurgical Corp.'s Newfield, N.J., facility. There are similarities in how decommissioning there and at JPG has been handled, the judges said, most especially in how long it is taking. Activity carried on under an NRC license at Shieldalloy ended in 1998. The judges said that at both sites, the long delay \"hardly seems consistent\" with the intent of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's own regulations.

From 1984 to 1994, the licensee conducted accuracy testing of depleted uranium (DU) tank penetrator rounds at the site. An NRC license was issued to authorize the U.S. Army to use, store, and perform testing of DU munitions at JPG. The DU penetrator rounds vary in size but can be generally described as rods comprised of a DU titanium alloy with a diameter of approximately 2.5 centimeters (cm) (1 inch) and a length as much as 61 cm (2 feet). The DU munitions testing contaminated approximately 5.1 x 106 square meters (m2) (1260 acres) of the site with an estimated 7 x 104 kilograms (1.5 x 105 pounds) of DU.

About a dozen local, state and federal government officials met at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant at Missouri 7 and 78 and listened to a proposed plan for the plant's Area 10 sand pile cleanup. Overall, the cleanup efforts are complete, though about 765 tons of sand material still needs sorted for potential safety hazards. Throughout five years, the cost for the cleanup totaled $14.7 million.\n\nThe removal actions have resulted in residual lead concentrations acceptable for industrial land use and residual depleted uranium concentrations acceptable for unrestricted land use, project manager Dave Wacker said. \"The sand pile material has been removed and no longer poses a potential source of contamination to groundwater,\" Wacker said. The removal, which addressed total lead and depleted uranium in sand and underlying soil, took place between April 2008 and February 2009. (The Examiner, July 8, 2009)\n\nArmy wants to dispose of contaminated sand from DU firing range on site rather than ship it offsite\n\nThe U.S. Army and environmental and remediation company officials focused on cleanup efforts for a nearly three-acre sand pit, referred to as Area 10, in the eastland uplands portion of the Lake City plant, at Missouri 78 and Missouri 7. Cleanup for Area 10 is slated to begin in April 2008 and conclude in December 2008. Bullets - both test and ammunition to be destroyed - were fired into the sand during the 1960s and 1970s, and later moved from the firing range to the pit.\n\nPrevious investigations found the sand contained both lead and depleted uranium from the spent bullets and posed a health hazard, said Barb Duletsky, senior project manager with Cabrera Services , the radiological environmental restoration firm in charge of cleanup. A painstaking cleanup plan was proposed that would include packaging and shipping the stabilized, lead-contaminated sand off site.\n\nHowever, the Army now has another suggestion: It wants to dispose of the processed sand on site and cover it with 6 inches of clean fill material and vegetation. Duletsky said after the sand is processed, it will no longer present a health risk. Further, the sand would meet Missouri standards that prohibit the disposal of radioactive material in state landfills. Burying the processed sand onsite, Duletsky said, would save taxpayers more than $2 million.\n\nThe public may view the document titled Area 10 Sand Piles Removal Action Explanation of Significant Differences at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant, Building 6, or at the Mid-Continent Public Library (North Independence Branch).
