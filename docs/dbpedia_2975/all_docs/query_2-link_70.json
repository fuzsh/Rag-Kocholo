        "text": "DOVER GLOBAL strife seems remote from this wooded and mountainous Morris County area 40 miles west of New York City. But since the American Revolution, ammunition and weapons have been produced hereabout, a region rich in iron and water resources.\n\nCannonballs for the Continental Army were forged here. And, for a century, the Picatinny Arsenal manufactured and stored ammunition for the Army.\n\nFive years ago, the Army Armament Research and Development Command took over Picatinny for its headquarters and established laboratories to modify and develop weapon prototypes. The command is known by the acronym ARRADCOM.\n\nThe Picatinny installation has became a hub of activity recently with a $50 million plan of expansion, renovation, energy conservation and modernization of its communications systems.\n\nNearly 1,000 administrative and engineering personnel have moved into a new $11 million administration building, which was dedicated last Tuesday.\n\nSporadic rumblings and gunfire are regular occupational sounds as technicians experiment with and test-fire weapons. Civilian scientists and engineers have developed prototypes of many sophisticated defense weapons, such as laser-guided and nuclear projectiles and radar-directed automatic guns.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
