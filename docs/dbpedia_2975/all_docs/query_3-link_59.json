        "text": "The CIA Trailblazer award was established in 1997 when CIA celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n\nNominations were open to officers of any grade, in any field, at any point in CIAâs history, who distinguished themselves as leaders, made a real difference in pursuit of our mission, and who served as a standard of excellence for others to follow.\n\nA special steering committee selected 50 individuals from over 300 nominations. These trailblazers received medallions from then-Director of Central Intelligence George J. Tenet.\n\nOver the years, several additional CIA officers have been identified as CIA Trailblazers: Currently, 83 officers or teams have received the coveted award. Weâve publicly released the names of 73 Trailblazers.\n\nWe invite you to read about our Trailblazersâ achievements below.\n\nThe following individuals are a sampling of the many talented CIA officers who have received this prestigious award.\n\nA founding member and longtime chair of the Agency Network of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Officers and Allies (ANGLE)âone of the largest and most active Agency resource groupsâTracey has been a driving force in helping the CIA become a more diverse, inclusive, and welcoming place to work. Her leadership and advocacy of the LGBT community have broken down barriers and opened up opportunities for her colleagues and future generations of CIA officers. Because of her courage, tenacity, and passion, the CIA is better able to attract, retain, and support a workforce that reflects the richness and variety of the great nation we serve.\n\nVirginia S. (Sue) Bromley\n\nA former Executive Director of CIAâthe number three job at the Agency at the timeâSue personified the concepts of collaboration and integration that are the hallmarks of the CIA today. She championed the multi-INT approach to intelligence problems that we now take for granted, cultivated the targeting discipline, implemented initiatives to optimize the use of Agency resources, and developed corporate approaches that enhanced Agency operations at every level. Sueâs career embodies the idea of âOne Agency, One Communityâ and paved the way for the type of whole-of-mission approaches that are critical in meeting todayâs challenges.\n\nRichard (Dick) Calder\n\nA former Deputy Director for Administrationâthe equivalent of todayâs Deputy Director of CIA for SupportâDick transformed how the Agency conducts its missions by establishing the Working Capital Fund (WCF). The WCF brought a business-based model to CIAâs support services, significantly increasing the speed, flexibility, and effectiveness of CIA operations. Dickâs vision and perseverance led to the creation of a global transportation supply chain capable of quickly pivoting and responding to crises across the globe. Because of him, the CIA is better equipped to meet both the known and unknown challenges of the future.\n\nJames (Jim) Garrison\n\nThe first Director of Logistics, Jim played a leading role in building many of the facilities that have served the CIA for decades. He oversaw construction of the Original Headquarters Buildingâwhich brought together CIA employees scattered across 40 buildings in the WMA. Jim brought this same passion and vision to developing future generations of logistics officers, inaugurating the first logistics training course and creating a career board to facilitate the recruitment, development, and advancement of CIA logisticians.Â\n\nVirginia Hall\n\nThe CIAâs first female paramilitary officer, Virginia drew from her extraordinary experiences running clandestine operations behind enemy lines for the OSS to help shape and lead CIA activities in the perilous early years of the Cold War. She used her deep expertise, exceptional tradecraft, and cultural awareness of Europe to lead some of the Agencyâs most sensitive operations during a time of extreme uncertainty.Â A quiet professional who preferred to stay in the shadows, Virginia turned down opportunities to be publicly recognized for her work, even by the President and the King of England, and passed on jobs that might have led to promotions to stay focused on covert action and paramilitary operations. She put country and mission first, and helped a relatively young CIA cement its role as our countryâs first line of defense."
