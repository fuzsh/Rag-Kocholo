        "text": "The Midnight aircraft is a sight to behold. Soon, it will be a common sight in the sky, linking cities and communities in ways we can only imagine today. The outstanding partnership between Archer Aviation and the United States Department of Defense (DOD) is vital so that the United States leads the world in the future of Advanced Aerial Mobility (AAM). As one of the most important transportation revolutions in history, our nation's combination of innovation and smart public policy will ensure that America writes the rules of the road for the future of flight...even though where we're going, we don't need roads. This adds to the recent Space Act Agreement, signed in January between Archer and NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration; they will work together to accelerate the development of battery cells and safety of AAM, as well as further space applications. My colleagues who serve with me on the DOD's Defense Business Board know that this fast-emerging global market for AAM, as well as the future of global supply chains and sustainability, depends upon this collaborative partnership between the public sector and our leading aerospace companies. #Archer #DepartmentOfDefense #MidnightAircraft\n\nSunday Lesson: #Leadership and Org Charts For those of us who have served in the #military (or in a corporate organization that has an established \"chain of command\")... You know that certain #decisions are owned at various levels in the leadership pecking order. The larger, high impact, or risk assuming decisions are held at the top of the chain and can be disseminated down through things like: 1. Command by Negation 2. Standing Orders 3. Instructions and other administrative policy documents. These decisions are held where they are in the military largely because of lessons learned over the course of history (many of refer to these written documents as being written in \"blood\"). If you read or look at a given military organization chart today and throughout history, you'll notice two key positions... 1. Decision Makers 2. Advisors Decision makers can be junior and rather inexperienced, but traditionally have years of development to make these hard decisions (Service Academies/ROTC for example) or more importantly, determine if the decision is \"above their pay grade\". These leaders usually also bring best practices from elsewhere learned through case studies, leadership development opportunities, etc. Advisors have the experience, \"tribal knowledge\", traditional subject matter expertise and guide a decision maker towards making the appropriate decision at the right time. Both are equally important and must be balanced. If one is out of whack, then so is the other. An advisor making a decision at the inappropriate level because they not be equipped to do so, or a decision maker making a blind decision lacking information and input from the advisor can be FATAL, DEADLY, DANGEROUS, etc. ----------------------- Let's get some #feedback and #thoughts on this from LinkedIn! As two of my favorite HBO series #bandofbrothers and #thepacific rolled out on Netflix this weekend, I was #reminded that the two stories have almost infinite leadership lessons to be learned, and each time I watch them I walk away with more thoughts and examples.

We explored how his military leadership experience has been translated and applied in his corporate role at Oracle. It's a great read and I encourage #militaryleaders who are separating soon to check it out and begin your transition now. Do that through: 1. Contacting colleagues who have completed their transition into corporate. Ask questions. 2. Attend networking and hiring events that interest you. 3. Utilize resources and platforms like #LinkedIn to make connections. 4. üóù Find a balance between hunger and humility. You may be serving in a leadership role now and your first Civilian role may not equate. That's okay. Take your time, be intentional, and believe that you're exactly what corporate needs. We at @Oracle value military employees‚Äîincluding our reservists on active deployment. Check out Colonel and Oracle leader Josh Barrow‚Äôs story https://lnkd.in/gkQWnzMQ #TAP United States Army Transition Assistance Program\n\nRespecting the Chair and the Leadership it Represents Recently, I held a couple of meetings in a conference room that wasn't mine. In my first meeting, some attendees asked why I wasn‚Äôt sitting at the head of the table since it was my meeting. My response was simple: it wasn‚Äôt my chair. It was the commander‚Äôs chair. To me, certain chairs hold significant meaning. The commander‚Äôs chair, the Chief‚Äôs chair, the First Sergeant‚Äôs chair, and the Senior Civilian‚Äôs chair each represent leadership, responsibility, and the dedication of the individuals who occupy them. I believe in respecting these symbols of authority and the chain of command they represent. I am here to support the men and women who sit in those chairs, as well as the Airmen and Guardians who follow their lead. By honoring these positions, we acknowledge the hard work, commitment, and sacrifice of our leaders and reinforce the values that make our military strong. Remember, it‚Äôs not just about where we sit, but how we respect and support those who lead us. Space Loggie out! #Leadership #Followership #LeadBoldly #Space #logistics"
