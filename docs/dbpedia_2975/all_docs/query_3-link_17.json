Members, appointed by the President, to consist of three Corps of Engineers officers, one of whom would serve as MRC president; one official of the Coast and Geodetic Survey; and two private citizens, one of whom would be a civil engineer. Headquarters office located, 1879-1906, wherever MRC president was stationed (usually in St. Louis, MO); in St. Louis, 1906-29; and in Vicksburg, MS, 1929- . MRC functioned independently of the divisions and districts of the Engineer Department, 1879-1929, establishing its own administrative districts, 1882. Pursuant to a reorganization of the Engineer Department effected by General Order 15, OCE, October 7, 1929, MRC districts were abolished, with MRC-planned projects thenceforth executed by organizations within the regular division and district structure.\n\nTop of Page\n\n77.7.1 General records\n\nTextual Records (in Kansas City, except as noted): Letters sent, 1871-82, 1885-93, with indexes.

By same order, the Memphis, Second New Orleans, and Vicksburg Districts were assigned to Lower Mississippi Valley Division. By Special Order 68, OCE, October 7, 1929, Brig. Gen. Thomas H. Jackson, MRC president since June 12, 1928, was named division engineer of Lower Mississippi Valley Division, and was ordered, by a letter of the Chief of Engineers of the same date, to move MRC headquarters to Vicksburg. Lower Mississippi Valley Division thenceforth acted as supervising office for MRC-planned projects, with the division's districts carrying out the actual works.\n\nTextual Records (in Kansas City): General correspondence, 1918- 42, consisting of records created by the MRC, 1918-29, to which have been added records created by the combined jurisdiction of the MRC and the Lower Mississippi Valley Division, 1929-42; with record cards.\n\nRelated Records: Additional records of the Lower Mississippi Valley Division Under 77.9.15.\n\nTop of Page\n\n77.7.3 Records of the Third Mississippi River District\n\nHistory: Pursuant to an act of August 2, 1882 (22 Stat. 191), appropriating funds for improvements on the Mississippi River from its junction with the Ohio River at Cairo, IL, to its mouth, Chief of Engineers established four districts to perform the work under general supervision of MRC: First, with headquarters in Cairo (later, Memphis, TN); Second, with headquarters in Memphis; Third, with headquarters in Vicksburg; and Fourth, with headquarters in New Orleans. Third Mississippi River District headquarters moved to Memphis, 1885; and back to Vicksburg, 1906.
