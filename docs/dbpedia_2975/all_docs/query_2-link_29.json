        "text": "Who May Apply: Only applicants who meet one of the employment authority categories below are eligible to apply for this job. You will be asked to identify which category or categories you meet, and to provide documents which prove you meet the category or categories you selected. See Proof of Eligibility for an extensive list of document requirements for all employment authorities.\n\nCurrent Department of Army Civilian Employees\n\nDomestic Defense Industrial Base/Major Range and Test Facilities Base Civilian Personnel Workforce\n\nInteragency Career Transition Assistance Plan\n\nLand Management Workforce Flexibility Act\n\nMilitary Spouses, under Executive Order (E.O.) 13473\n\nPriority Placement Program, DoD Military Reserve (MR) and National Guard (NG) Technician Eligible\n\nPriority Placement Program, DoD Military Spouse Preference (MSP) Eligible\n\nPriority Placement Program, DoD MR and NG Preference Eligible Tech Receiving Disability Retirement\n\nPriority Placement Program, DoD Retained Grade Preference Eligible\n\nVeterans Employment Opportunity Act (VEOA) of 1998\n\nIn order to qualify, you must meet the education and/or experience requirements described below. Experience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including volunteer work done through National Service programs (e.g., Peace Corps, AmeriCorps) and other organizations (e.g., professional; philanthropic; religious; spiritual; community; student; social). You will receive credit for all qualifying experience, including volunteer experience. Your resume must clearly describe your relevant experience; if qualifying based on education, your transcripts will be required as part of your application. Additional information about transcripts is in this document.\n\nBasic Education Requirement:\n\nA. Degree: Bachelor's degree (or higher degree) in engineering. To be acceptable, the program must: (1) lead to a bachelor's degree (or higher degree) in a school of engineering with at least one program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET); OR (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics. NOTE: You MUST submit a copy of your transcripts.\n\nOR\n\nB. Combination of Education and Experience: College-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying engineering, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the engineering sciences and techniques and their applications to one of the branches of engineering. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following:\n\n1. Professional registration or licensure- Current registration as an Engineer Intern (EI), Engineer in Training (EIT), or licensure as a Professional Engineer (PE) by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions.\n\n2. Written Test - Evidence of having successfully passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination, or any other written test required for professional registration, by an engineering licensure board in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico.\n\n3. Specified academic courses- Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and that included the courses specified in A above. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of an engineering program.\n\n4. Related curriculum- Successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in an appropriate scientific field, e.g., engineering technology, physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. (You MUST submit a copy of your transcripts along with a letter of reference stating that you have at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. The letter must be signed by the engineer who provided the professional engineer supervision. It must also include their name, phone number, and list their engineer credentials such as engineer education or professional certificates).\n\nNOTE: An applicant who meets the basic requirements as specified in A or B above, except as noted under B.1., may qualify for positions in any branch of engineering unless selective factors indicate otherwise.\n\nIn addition to meeting the basic requirement above, to qualify for this position you must also meet the qualification requirements listed below:\n\nTo qualify at the DB-04/GS-14 equivalent grade level: Your resume must clearly describe at least one year of specialized experience equivalent to the DB-03 pay band or equivalent grade level (GS-12/13) level in the Federal service. Specialized experience is defined as meeting all of the following experience:\n\n1) Administratively and technically supervises and interdisciplinary professional staff engaged in acquisition life cycle engineering of indirect fire design, development, & evaluation competency areas. 2) Expertise in project planning, resourcing, and execution, leading groups or teams, assigning work assignments, establishing objectives, roadmaps and strategic plans, and resolving administrative, technical and personnel problems. 3) Implementing acquisition engineering policy and briefing on engineering project status, accomplishments, and challenges.\n\nYou will be evaluated on the basis of your level of competency in the following areas:\n\nDecision Making\n\nGeneral Engineering\n\nOral Communication\n\nProblem Solving"
