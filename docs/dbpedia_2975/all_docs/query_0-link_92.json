        "text": "ROCKAWAY TOWNSHIP -- The Navy is sailing into a long-time Army research post in Morris County and will bring more than 200 science and engineering jobs with it by next year.\n\nA groundbreaking took place last week for two naval facilities at Picatinny Arsenal in Rockaway Township, heralding the merging of research efforts by both branches of the military at a facility with a lineage that dates to the Continental Army.\n\nA \"naval guns and weapons tech data facility’’ and \"naval guns and weapons turret facility’’ will be constructed on the grounds of the 6,500-acre military installation, with completion expected in 2011, according to Picatinny officials. Total cost of the projects is estimated to be $14.8 million, said an arsenal spokesman.\n\nAlso, a new naval packaging, handling, storage and transportation center already is being built to relocate an operation to Picatinny from Earle Naval Weapons Station in Colts Neck. It is expected to be completed by May of 2011.\n\nThe merging of Army and Navy weapons research and operations is a direct result of recommendations of the 2005 federal Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission, which considered ways to reshape the Defense Department’s infrastructure and force deployment.\n\nIt’s recommendations included closing Fort Monmouth by 2011. But Picatinny was spared and its mission expanded.\n\n\"This is exciting,’’ said Picatinny spokesman Peter Rowland. \"There were moments in the past when we wondered if Picatinny would last the decade. But now we are actually growing.’’\n\nPicatinny Arsenal, with more than a million square feet of research space, serves as a proving range and research and development site for munitions and weapons for the military.\n\nIts website states, \"There is no other comprehensive armaments facility like it in the country; it is a one-of-a-kind facility that provides virtually all of the lethal mechanisms used in Army weapon systems and those of the other military services.’’\n\nThe independent commission voted in 2005 to recommend the transfer of munitions research from naval warfare centers around the country to Picatinny, part of a broader Pentagon plan to foster joint operations and cooperation among the military services at bases nationwide.\n\nAs part of this effort, the Naval Surface Warfare Center is bringing to Picatinny divisions from the seven locations around the country that research and develop the guns and ship-defense systems used by the Navy, as well as the systems used to transport ammunition.\n\nCreating an Army-Navy center for armament development at Picatinny could eventually create 600 jobs at a base that has a $5 billion operating budget and 4,500 mostly civilian employees.\n\n\"This day is big. It marks a significant turning point in the history of Picatinny Arsenal,\" said Army Lt. Col. John P. Stack, the installation’s garrison commander, who was joined at the recent groundbreaking ceremony by Navy Capt. Andrew Buduo, commander of the Indian Head Division Naval Surface Warfare Center.\n\nRep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-11th Dist.), whose district includes Picatinny, has fought to keep Picatinny open and make it viable to the military — especially since it is one of Morris County’s largest employers. He lauded the joint Army-Navy venture.\n\n\"To keep providing our soldiers, sailors and Marines with 21st century firepower, Picatinny needs 21st century laboratories and research and development facilities,\" said Frelinghuysen. \"(This) moves Picatinny closer to fulfilling the Pentagon’s vision for it as the ‘Joint Center of Excellence’ for guns and ammunition.\"\n\nThe guns and weapons complex will include a warehouse, minor caliber weapons systems laboratory and turret facility. A contract to build the $10.4 million facility was awarded to APS Contracting of Paterson.\n\nThe new tech data building will provide the primary office space for engineers and technicians performing guns and ammunition research, development and acquisition. It will be located in a renovated structure that currently houses Army weapons systems divisions.\n\nThe $4.4 million center will be built by Intercontinental Contract Corp. of Passaic."
