        "text": "Pembroke Dock County School was established in 1895, and its first pupils were taught in the Victoria Hotel. From 1899 the school moved to new premises at Argyle Street, and in 1947, the school became Pembroke Grammar School. Within the school is a finely carved wooden panel, which commemorates the 185 members of the School who served during the Great War. Amongst the names, the names of the nineteen men who died on active service are highlighted. There is a separate memorial for those who fell during WW2. These men are commemorated on this page.\n\nThe Great War, 1914-1918\n\nGeorge Price Davies, Second Lieutenant, South Wales Borderers. George was the son of James and Louisa A. Davies, of 95, Gwyther Street, Pembroke Dock, and served with the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers. The battalion had fought in Tientsin, China at the outbreak of war, then at Gallipoli, attached to 87 Brigade, 29th Division. The division then moved to France, and fought during the Battle of the Somme, and at Arras and Passchendaele the following year. They fought at the Battle of Cambrai in November and December, 1917 before moving back to Flanders early in 1918. The German Spring Offensive hit the British on the Somme on 21 March, 1918, and hit in Flanders just weeks later. The 29th Division fought at the desperate defensive battles of Estaires, Messines, Bailleul and Kemmel, before the war turned in favour of the Allies after a series of successes on the Somme in August. The Division then took part in the Offensive in Flanders, where they took part in the Action of Outtersteene Ridge, and then at the Battle of Ypres, and it was here that George was killed on 29 September 1918, aged 37. He is buried in Zantvoorde British Cemetery, Belgium.\n\nThomas John Carlyle Davies, Second Lieutenant, Welsh Regiment. Thomas was the son of John Benjamin and Agnes Esther Davies, formerly of the London and Provincial Bank, of Main Street, Pembroke. Educated at Llandovery from 1911 to 1914, Thomas was the College Captain of rugby and a school cricketer. On leaving Llandovery, Thomas entered Clare College, Cambridge, but left prematurely on the declaration of War, to enlist, attending Officer Cadet Training at R.M.A. Sandhurst. Thomas was then commissioned into the Welsh Regiment, and in 1915 he was posted to the 1st Battalion, Welsh Regiment, which was in France attached to 84 Brigade, 28th Division. During September 1915, the battalion took part in preparatory attacks along the Hohenzollern Redoubt, prior to a General Offensive to be launched between Hulloch and Hill 70 on 1 October 1915, during the Battle of Loos. An attack by 1st Welsh was thwarted when it ran out of bombs and became cut off. Thomas was severely wounded in this action and died from his wounds on 2 October 1915, aged just 20. He has no known grave, and is commemorated on the Loos Memorial, France. The photograph of John is courtesy of Dr Frances Hurd.\n\nWilliam Alexander Duggan, Sergeant, 7412, Wiltshire Regiment. William was the son of S.Q.M.S. J. Duggan (R.A.S.C.) and Agnes Duggan, of 99, Warley Road, Brentwood, Essex. He enlisted at Pembroke Dock into the 2nd Battalion, Wiltshire Regiment, which was attached to 21 Brigade, 7th Division, and moved to Zeebrugge on 7 August 1914. By then the City was falling to the Germans, and 7th Division moved to Ypres, where it took part in the first desperate Battle of Ypres, where the German advance on the Channel posts was halted. William was killed in the following Battle of Neuve Chapelle, on 14 March 1915, aged 28. He is buried in Estaires Communal Cemetery and Extension, France.\n\nErnest Victor Edwards, 2nd Lieutenant (Pilot), Royal Flying Corps. Ernest was born on 2 July 1889, the son of Ann and David Humphreys Edwards of Towyn House, Main Street, Pembroke.

Ernest joined the 3rd County of London Yeomanry (T.F.) on 24 April 1908. He served five years with the Colours, and joined the Reserve. He was called up on mobilization in August 1914, and served with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force in Gallipoli, taking part in the landing at Suvla Bay in August 1915, and in much of the subsequent fighting. Ernest was wounded at Gallipoli, and invalided to Egypt. On recovery he rejoined his regiment, of which he was Sergeant, and proceeded with them to Salonika, and subsequently to Palestine, where he saw severe fighting. Ernest then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, and was recommended for a commission, and gazetted 2nd Lieutenant on 10 February 1918. Sadly he was accidentally killed while flying Avro 504a, Serial A8541 at Ismailia on the 16 February 1918, and was buried there at Ismailia War Cemetery, Egypt. His Commanding Officer and Adjutant wrote: “I never saw anyone with more backbone; a true Britisher and much loved,” and a Cadet wrote: “To live with him was to come under the influence of an exceptional strength of character and a capacity for cheerfulness as amazing as ever present, combined with a wonderful personality.’\n\nFrederick James Flutter, Sergeant, 5834, Cavalry. Frederick was born at St. Mary’s, Pembroke and enlisted at Pembroke into the Cavalry, joining the 3rd (Prince Of Wales Own) Dragoon Guards, attached to 6 Cavalry Brigade, 3rd Cavalry Division. The division was formed in September 1914 and moved to Antwerp. They fought at First and Second Ypres, and the Battle of Loos. In April 1917 the division fought during the Battle of the Scarpe, which is where Frederick was killed on 11 April 1917. He has no known grave, and is commemorated on the Arras Memorial, France.\n\nElmore Wright George, Second Lieutenant, Welsh Regiment. Elmore was the son of Lieutenant William W. George, R.A.S.C. and Mary M. George, of Laburnum Villa, Pembroke. He had served in the Pembroke Yeomanry, but in 197 was commissioned into the 15th Battalion, Welsh Regiment, the ‘Carmarthen Pals’. The battalion had been formed in 1914 from a nucleus of Carmarthenshire men, and in December 1915 had moved to France as part of 114 Brigade, 38th (Welsh) Division. They had fought at Fleurbaix, and the famous battle of Mametz Wood, before moving to Ypres, where they successfully captured the Pilckem Ridge, and the village of Langemarck. In April 1918 the division was moved to the Somme area to help steady the line after the German Spring Offensive, and took up positions near Mesnil and Aveluy Wood. On 10 May 1918 the 15th Welsh launched a large scale raid on the German lines within Aveluy Wood. Disastrously the supporting artillery fire had been incorrectly ranged, and fell short, causing many casualties amongst the battalion. Elmore was killed by the artillery fire that day. He was 23 years old and is buried in Martinsart British Cemetery, France.\n\nOsborne William Griffiths, Private, 13425, Coldstream Guards. Osborne was the son of George Llewhellin Griffiths and Edith A. Griffiths of Pembroke. He resided at Carew prior to the war, and enlisted at Hayward’s Heath into the Coldstream Guards.

The Division moved to France at the outbreak of war, and fought from the opening Battle of Mons, through the retreat south to the Aisne. The Guards were at the forefront of the fighting in France. On 20 August 1915 the 3rd Battalion transferred to 1st (Guards) Brigade, Guards Division, and took part in the Battle of Loos, which was launched on 25 September 1915. It was probably at Loos that Osbourne was wounded and returned home for treatment.

The division had been in France since attempting to stem the German advance on Antwerp, and had fought at the Battles of Ypres, Loos and Arras. It took part in the opening of the Battle of Amiens, south of the River Somme, on 8 August 1918, which was the battle which turned the course of the war. William was killed that day, on 8 August 1918. He is buried in Manitoba Cemetery, Caix, France.\n\nReginald Archibald Sharp, Second Lieutenant, Royal Garrison Artillery. Reginald was the son of Captain Richard Sharp and Hannah Sharp, of Goodwick. He married Lilian Mary Jackson on 28 December 1912, and the couple lived at 7, Lynsted Lane, Teynham, Sittingbourne, Kent.

Arthur enlisted on 22 February 1915 at Liverpool, NSW into the 18th Battalion, Australian Infantry, which were part of the 5th Brigade, 2nd Australian Division. The Battalion left Australia in May 1915 bound for Egypt, and after several months spent training there landed on ANZAC Cove, Gallipoli on 22 August 1915 to reinforce the badly depleted First Division who had been there since landing on 25 April. Just days later, the Battalion took part in the Battle for Hill 60, and Arthur was wounded there. He sadly Died of Wounds on 27 August 1915, aged 26. He was buried at sea, and so is remembered on the Lone Pine Memorial, Gallipoli.\n\nBenjamin Stewart Buckingham Thomas, MC, Lieutenant (Pilot), Royal Air Force. Benjamin was the son of Benjamin and Jessie Thomas, of 71, Gwyther Street, Pembroke Dock. He had originally served in France with the 9th Welsh, gaining the award of the Military Cross for gallantry on the Somme, before volunteering to serve with the Royal Flying Corps, where he trained as a Pilot. Benjamin was then posted to Number 11 Squadron, which flew the Bristol F2b. Benjamin was killed when his F2b, Serial D7978, with Lieutenant C. E. Spinks as Observer, was shot down over the Somme on 4 October 1918. He was 24 years old, and is buried in Grevillers British Cemetery, France.\n\nFrederick James Thomas, Private, G/40011, Middlesex Regiment.

He enlisted at Highbeech, Essex into the Royal Fusiliers, but was later transferred into the 18th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which was attached to the 33rd Division, as Pioneers. The Division moved to France during November 1915, and saw its first major action during the Battles of the Somme, from July 1916 onwards. They then fought at the Battle of the Scarpe and at Bullecourt, before heading to Ypres, and fighting at the Menin Road and at Polygon Wood. They were still in Flanders when the German Spring Offensive hit, and fought at the Battle of Messines, and it was here that Frederick was killed on 13 April 1918. He was 25 years old, and is buried in Meteren Military Cemetery, France.\n\nRichard Edward Lewis Treweeks, Lieutenant Commander, Royal Navy. Richard was born at St. Mary’s, Pembroke on 25 April 1893, the son of Major Richard and Mrs Gertrude Treweeks. He had served with the Mercantile Marine for several years prior to the war and had married Dorothy Martha Caistor in Manchester in December 1914, after having transferred to the Royal Navy on 1 April 1913. He was posted aboard the Warrior class armoured cruiser HMS Natal with the rank of Lieutenant. On 30 December 1915 Natal was lying in the Cromarty Firth with her squadron, under the command of Captain Eric Back RN. Shortly after 3.20pm, and without warning, a series of violent explosions tore through the ship. She capsized five minutes later. The most probable explanation was that a fire had broken out, possibly due to faulty cordite that ignited a magazine. Around 400 men were killed, some in the immediate explosions, others drowned as the ship capsized, or succumbed to the freezing water of the Cromarty Firth. Some bodies were recovered and given a proper burial, but Richard went down with the ship, and so he is commemorated on the Chatham Naval Memorial, Kent.\n\nFrederick George Truscott, Private, 25713, Lancashire Fusiliers. Frederick was the son of Horatio George and Anne Prosser Truscott, of 70, Gwyther Street, Pembroke Dock. Frederick enlisted at Pembroke into the Royal Field Artillery, and was given the service number 137692. He was later transferred, probably due to earlier wounding or sickness, to the 12th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, his number changing to 25713. The Battalion formed part of 65 Brigade, 22nd Division. The Division crossed to France in early September 1915, with all units being concentrated near Flesselles by 9 September. However it’s stay in France was to be very short, as on 27 October 1915 the Division, having been moved by train to Marseilles, began to embark for Salonika. It completed concentration there in November, although the final artillery units were still coming in as late as 13 December 1915. It remained in the theatre for the rest of the war, taking part in the Retreat from Serbia during December, 1915. From 10-18 August 1916 the Division fought at the battle of Horseshoe Hill, then from 13-14 September 1916 at the battle of Machukovo. From 24-25 April and 8-9 May 1917 the Division fought at the battle of Doiran. Frederick was killed in action near Doiran on 22 April 1918, aged 23. He is commemorated on the Doiran Memorial, Salonika.\n\nJoseph Gilbert Webb, MC, Lieutenant, Royal Welsh Fusiliers. Joseph was the Husband of Elizabeth Webb, of Bulmer House, Haverfordwest. He had been commissioned into the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, and served with the 14th Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers, which was attached to 113 Brigade, 38th (Welsh) Division. The Division landed in France during December 1915 and had spent their first winter in the trenches near Armentieres. In June they marched south to the Somme, where they were tasked with the capture of Mametz Wood. The attack on the wood began on 7 July, but met with fierce resistance, and it took until 14 July to totally clear the wood. The Division suffered terrible casualties at Mametz, and were taken out of the line, and moved to Ypres to rebuild. Here they fought at the Battle of Pilckem Ridge, and the Battle of Langemarck. They then moved to Armentieres, where they remained from September 1917 until March, 1918 when the German Spring Offensive was launched. The British had been over-run on the Somme, and so in April the Division was moved South, taking up positions North of Albert, from where they weathered the storm of the coming months. Joseph was wounded at some stage in early 1918, and evacuated to a Hospital in Britain for treatment, but sadly died of wounds on 9 May 1918. He is buried in St. Thomas A Beckett Churchyard, Haverfordwest. Joseph was awarded the Military Cross for the action in which he was wounded. The award was published in the London Gazette of 2 July 1918, and read; ‘For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty when in command of a fighting patrol of 8 men. Being attacked by an enemy patrol of 28 men, he at once opened fire and charged the enemy. He drove them back in confusion, inflicted heavy casualties on them, and captured two prisoners. All his patrol, including 3 wounded men, were brought back safely.’\n\nGeorge Wildig, DCM, Lieutenant, Kings Shropshire Light Infantry. George was born at Cork, Ireland, the son of Major George Wildig, of the KSLI. He came to Pembroke Dock with his father in 1904, and was educated at the County School. After leaving school, George followed in his father’s footsteps, and enlisted into the 1st Battalion, King’s Shropshire Light Infantry, which was attached to 16 Brigade, 6th Division. On 10 September 1914 the Division landed at St Nazaire and proceeded to the Western Front, and arrived in time to reinforce the hard-pressed BEF on the Aisne, before the whole army was moved north into Flanders. Here they took part in the Action of Hooge during June, 1915, and in 1916 moved to the Somme, where the Division fought at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, the Battle of Morval and the Battle of Le Transloy. George was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal while serving with them in France, his award being listed in the London Gazette of 11 January 1916. He was then commissioned, and married Elsie Mary Vaughan whilst on leave in the summer of 1916. George served for the rest of the war as a Lieutenant with the 161st Training Battalion. He died in hospital at Birmingham on 6 November 1918, aged 26. George was buried in Pembroke Dock (Llanion) Cemetery on Armistice Day.\n\nDavid Aubrey Williams, Second Lieutenant, South Wales Borderers.

The Battalion had been in France since landing at St. Nazaire on 11 September, 1914. They had rushed to reinforce the BEF on the Aisne, and had then been transferred to Hooge. In 1916 the Division moved south, to take part in the Somme Offensive, and fought at Flers-Courcelette, Morval and Le Transloy. Samuel had only gone into action for the first time on 13 October, but was killed in Action just three days later, on 16 October 1916 during the Battle of Le Transloy.

The RND was at Arras by then, before moving to positions at Ypres, where they took part in the Battle of Passchendaele. Thomas was killed at Passchendaele on 30 October 1917, aged 34, and is commemorated on the Tyne Cot Memorial, Belgium. His brother, David Aubrey Williams, also fell.\n\nWorld War Two, 1939-1945\n\nJohn Henry Bevans, Sergeant (Pilot), Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. John was born on 13 December 1917, the son of Shipwright Inspector John Bevans, and of Emilie Jane Bevans (nee Williams), of 7, Waterloo Terrace, Pembroke Dock. He was educated at Pembroke Dock Grammar School. John enlisted into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve soon after the outbreak of war and after training as a Navigator, was posted to 106 Squadron, Royal Air Force. At the outbreak of the Second World War the squadron was flying Hampdens with No. 5 Group, and until early 1941 had a training role.
