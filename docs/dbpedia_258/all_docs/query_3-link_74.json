        "text": "An Italian defeat in North Africa probably will cause Mussolini to be ousted and scrap plans for the invasion of Greece, this might lead to an unofficial armistice with Great Britain and France which while they will still technically be at war might keep Germany from occupying the areas of France that Italy has.\n\nUnofficial armistice is out of question, the German couldn't afford it and they will put \"pressure\" on Italy to stay in the war. With all North Africa in the hands of Allies, Sicily and South Italy are at risk long before 42 should the German doesn't help Italian, at least with airplanes. And Corsica and Sardinia have to be seized-retaken to suppress the thraeat on Northern Italy, meaning German involvement.\n\nSardinia, weakly defended by two infantry divisions and few obsolete aircrafts, would have been invaded by Allies immediatly after the fall of Lybia to secure Corsica supply lines.\n\nFTL proposed time line is:\n\n- Lybian invasion by French from Jul. 14th\n\n- Lybian invasion by English from Aug. 16th\n\n- Invasion of Sardinia Sep. 2nd\n\nEDIT: And Dodecanese will be invaded from Sep. 6th to Oct. 15th\n\nSo the German effort in Italy will be comparable to OTL in air force, probably less in ground forces if nothing happend in Greece.\n\nAs the BoF would have required much more and longer effort for Heer and LW, the recovery time would be more or less equivalent to the DAK and Balkans Campaigns.\n\nAn Italian defeat in North Africa probably will cause Mussolini to be ousted and scrap plans for the invasion of Greece, this might lead to an unofficial armistice with Great Britain and France which while they will still technically be at war might keep Germany from occupying the areas of France that Italy has.\n\nBut a coup in Italy is possible (too early in my opinion, but possible). With new government declaring neutrality.\n\nIn this case, there will be a race in Italy between German in the North and Allies in the South to seize as much territory as possible.\n\nSuppose the coup occures after the fall of Sardinia, mid September. It will be a totale surprise for both ennemies (and probably for the Italian army too as OTL).\n\nGerman forces will run from France and Austria and will take the whole Po plain before any serious Italian reaction. Crossing the Appennine Mountains will be more difficult.\n\nAllied forces will land in Sicilly, Napoli, maybe Roma and Genova.\n\nThe outcome will depend on the Italian army reaction. As of OTL, it likely will switch to Allied side allowing British and French to secure the Appennine line, best Allied case. The best case for German will be the seize of Roma and a fighting line on OTL Gustav Line position.\n\nWith better communication lines, German will probably progressively repeal the Allies out of the penninsula but won't be able to retake Sicily. They won't be able to attack Corsica and Sardinia before the end of the battle in the mainland.\n\nFNA and Sicilian Canal are secured, RN and MN could sail away to North Atlantic and Far East, and Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica are a big threat on German Southern flank.\n\nI sort of doubt that the deal would have been the same with France still in the war.\n\nWhich forgets both why Germany would show any interest to accommodate Greece at the cost of its Italian and Bulgarian allies, who by any reasonable account are more important to it than Greece and why Greece would show an interest in switching sides in the first place. Lets note that the chief pro-German in Greece was Metaxas himself. Who believed that Britain would win the war AFTER France had surrendered in OTL and also believed that any siding with the axis would result in immediate civil war as the republicans would rise up with British support (personally I don't think this was likely... for the simple reason the king could be relied upon to sack any minister that tried to side with the axis ). And acted accordingly. That's even before taking into account such minor issues like the dependence of Greece on food imports by sea, which Germany cannot replace and German attacks on Greek shipping since day one of the war.\n\nRoad logistics to Lybian border\n\nOn top of the railways logistics, the road will be used to reinforce it and to deliver the supplies to the front line from Mareth end of line.\n\nLet's make an estimation.\n\nOut of the 2,500 Army trucks in FNA, let's dedicate 1,500 to the rear front logistics. 750 will be used to deliver military supply to Mareth and 750 more from Mareth to the front depots.\n\nTunis - Mareth: 450 km\n\nAt 45 km/hour, it will take 10 hours one way to each truck to deliver an average of one ton. Meaning 375 tons per day.\n\nMareth - Front line depots (25 km from Lybian border): 125 km\n\nAt 45 km/h, it will take 3 hours. Meaning 750 to 1,000 tons per day.\n\nFor four weeks, it's more than 20,000 tons.\n\nOne hundred trucks more will be used to deliver supplies and ammunitions to the units in the front line from the depots, two travels a day each means 200 tons per day, out of which 75 tons of shells fired each day and 25 tons to build the initial stock for the Day one and immediate afternath (see below).\n\nShelling before offensive:\n\nJust before the offensive, 200 guns will fire 72,000 rounds on Italian positions during one hour (200 x 6 rounds/min x 60 minutes), 540 tons. This is 20 tons per day during four weeks to build the stock; with 25 tons per days, there will be a reserve of 18,000 rounds.\n\nFrom the day one of invasion, 1,000 trucks will be shifted to the offensive (500 for troop transportation: 1,000 to 2,000 men at once; and 500 for the re-supply). 500 will continue to be used for rear front logistics.\n\nOut of the 2,500 Army trucks in FNA, let's dedicate 1,500 to the rear front logistics. 750 will be used to deliver military supply to Mareth and 750 more from Mareth to the front depots.\n\nIn 1940 a DIM had about 1500 vehicles (http://enpointe.perso.infonie.fr/dim.html). That division was not fully motorized since the vehicles were enough for only 1 regiment to advance at a time. Basically the division had to leapfrog in order to move. This kind of move was only possible in Metropolitan France and Belgium, with one of the world's best road networks.\n\nTo use a pool of 2500 trucks for an offensive in SUMMER 1940 is beyond ASB. Please check the logistics of the Western Desert Campaign. Wavell in September 1939 to support an enlarged brigade in Mersa Matruh used about 300 trucks and water tankers. That veicle pool was enough just to support the garrison, not to get involved in a major offensive. The British due their logistics constraints were able to attempt only raids. Successful raids, but raids.\n\nTo launch an offensive to Libya the French need:\n\na) Expand the railway 37km to Mareth. This is rather easy even with the fall of France, since they can rip out tracks from another part of their network and use them to reach Mareth. But even this, it is time consuming job. It cannot be done in weeks after the greatest military disaster France had in her long history.\n\nb) Buiild water pipelines to the border.\n\nc) Amass a great number of trucks and water tankers. Bear in mind that you cannot strip Morocco and western Algeria of their vehicles since there is the Spanish threat in the rear.\n\nd) Prepare stocks of munitions.\n\nA Libya Offensive can only start on late autumn. A landing in Sardinia, without ANY doctrine for amphibious operations, without ANY plans ( and a general policy notion like \"in case Italy enters the war, we will snatch Sardinia\" are not proper plans) and lastly without ANY preparation during the previous months, is even more ASB than a Libya Offensive.\n\nIf for political reasons France needs to be seen as getting something done, then the Marine Nationale can engage the enemy with vigor. Raids by the large and speedy contre torpilleurs and cruisers. At most to have regiment size raids from Tunisia towards the Libyan border. Anything else is simply not possible. Weirdly though, the most easy offensive for the French, would be a move towards Tangiers and Teuta. Small distance, existing railroad, close to established bases. But this is a senario only in the case of a Spanish entry.\n\nPlease read my post as a global overview of what was possible, I am not a specialist. But to answer your objections:\n\nIn 1940 a DIM had about 1500 vehicles (http://enpointe.perso.infonie.fr/dim.html). That division was not fully motorized since the vehicles were enough for only 1 regiment to advance at a time. Basically the division had to leapfrog in order to move. This kind of move was only possible in Metropolitan France and Belgium, with one of the world's best road networks.\n\nRoad network inTunisia not as dense as in France but sufficient for the logistic. See above post and maps already mentionned.\n\nhttps://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/ams/north_africa/\n\nSee in particular:\n\n- NI 32-11 Gabes\n\n- NI 32-12 Zarzis.\n\nAlso the desert in this country is not sand but rocks and, as OTL, roads was not necessary to progress.\n\nTo use a pool of 2500 trucks for an offensive in SUMMER 1940 is beyond ASB. Please check the logistics of the Western Desert Campaign. Wavell in September 1939 to support an enlarged brigade in Mersa Matruh used about 300 trucks and water tankers. That veicle pool was enough just to support the garrison, not to get involved in a major offensive. The British due their logistics constraints were able to attempt only raids. Successful raids, but raids.\n\nAlexandria - Mersa Matruh is 300 km/185 miles to be compared to the 120 km from Mareth line to Ben Gardane (30 km from the border). Also, not sure about the Egyptian roads but I think there were not paved in the desert at that time.\n\nEDIT: I checked, paved road in Egypt to Mersa Mathru plus railroad at this time. So good point.\n\nAssuming you need 10 liters a day per man, you need 30 m3 for a brigade. That will be probably the size of the unit based in Ben Gardane until one week from the start of the offensive. And Ben Gardane is a big oasis with several wells, probably enought to support several thousands of men during one or two weeks.\n\nAnyway, as shown in my post, you may deliver to Ben Gardane 750 to 1,000 tons per day. Enought to support one division and to buidl stocks for the offensive.\n\na) Expand the railway 37km to Mareth.\n\nAlready done, see map NI 32-11.\n\nBuiild water pipelines to the border.\n\nZarzis is also a big palm plantation with wells and could supply front line troops.\n\nAmass a great number of trucks and water tankers. Bear in mind that you cannot strip Morocco and western Algeria of their vehicles since there is the Spanish threat in the rear.\n\nI took only 1,600 trucks out of 2,500 available in FNA. Not taking into account those requisitioned from civil transport and the US deliveries.\n\nA Libya Offensive can only start on late autumn.\n\nWhy?\n\nA landing in Sardinia, without ANY doctrine for amphibious operations, without ANY plans ( and a general policy notion like \"in case Italy enters the war, we will snatch Sardinia\" are not proper plans) and lastly without ANY preparation during the previous months, is even more ASB than a Libya Offensive.\n\nAmhibious operations in Sardinia will be much easier than in Narvik. Allies already did it, of course not in on a similatr way as OTL 1942 and later on but remember British already have landing crafts able to support light tank (up to H39); if most of them was lost or abandonned in Norway, there were another batch under construction OTL. Without any serious air opposition and no consistent naval opposition possible on the western coast (and at very high risk for Italian on the Southern coast), I don't see how Italian could repeal such a landing.\n\nDetails of operation can be read on FTL site and seem to me realistic.\n\nJuly-August 1940 - ITTL - Lybia - Order of battle\n\nhttps://www.axishistory.com/various...923-20-june-1940-italian-army-order-of-battle\n\nhttps://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/CGSC/CARL/nafziger/940IXAD.PDF\n\nThe forces on Tunisian-Lybian boundary are balanced considering the number of men, even if French troups are further from it (Marteh line is 150 km from the border and some of the Tunisian infantry divisions are in the North). But Italian army laked modern fighters, have some light tanks, no anti-tank artillery, very few AA and much less artillery than French (12 x 105 mm and 24 x 75 mm for each infantry division). The only strong point was the bombers with lots of modern SM.79.\n\nFrench have a lot (compared to Italian) of modern fighters. Italian has to split their air force between Sicily and Lybia and fighters based in Sicily will be of no help for Lybian fight. They could reinforce both after the end of the Battle of France and, except if they want to attack Corsica, they will be less outnumbered by mi-August. French are receiving modern US aircraft in Morocco and have piloting schools in FNA (Meknes...)\n\nArtillery is the strongest point of French army and on top of the already existing division allocation, one thousand of 75 mm gun are to be delivered with ammunition, even outdated these are deadly weapon with more than 10 km fire range and very efficient anti-tank guns.\n\nFacing six infantry divisions (25 ID, 55 ID, 60 ID, 17 ID, 27 ID, 61 ID, 13,000 men each), two \"black shirt\" (6,000 men), twa artillery regiments, one armored batallion (Fiat M11/39 tank, 11 t, 37 mm gun, 30 mm front armor, 72 examples in Lybia) and two Lybian infantry divisions (6,000 men each, in Tripoli), the French have 2 infantry divisions (81e DIA, and 180e DIA), one cavalry division (6e DLC including one motorized brigade 16 BLM), one armored group (GBC 521 with 2 BCC D1 and one BCC FT17), one artillery regiment (288e RALD), one motorized regiment (3e RCA) and some other small units in the South (Gabès and Mareth line); plus three infantry divisions in the North (83e DIA, 84e DIA and 88e DIA). Four other infantry divisions are in Algeria (85e DIA, 181e DIA, 182e DIA and 183e DIA), two must remain in the West, facing Spanish, two could be used as reinforcement if needed.\n\nhttp://www.atf40.fr/ATF40/mai40/france.html\n\nhttp://france1940.free.fr/oob/fr_oob.html\n\nFrench have 120 D1 tanks (14 t, 47 mm gun, 40 mm front armor) allocated to two BCC (~45 each) and a reserve (40). Let's assume that one third is available, this is one BCC. It could be reinforced by another BCC of 28 + 4 H35/39 (11/12 t, 37 mm gun, 30 mm front armor) from Morocco, keeping only 30 R35 (11 t, 37 mm gun, 43 mm front armor) (and the 60 FT-17...) to face the Spanish. H39 with 37 mm SA38 gun was able to pierce 30 mm at 1,000 m.\n\nUSA have sent to French on June 11th on the ship \"Pasteur\" 1,000 x 75 mm guns with 1 M rounds of ammunitions.\n\nhttp://canonde75.free.fr/faitsarmes.htm\n\nAirforce\n\nFrance\n\nhttps://www.passionair1940.fr/\n\nFighters\n\nhttps://www.escadrillesdechasse.com...nstitution-des-groupes-de-chasse-de-1939-1940\n\nOTL:

These tanks arrived with a convoy by early July 1940. With Allied fleets on both sides of Lybia, and the possibility of basing fairly-sized forces on Malta far sooner ITTL, a convoy including ships able to carry even light tanks like the M11 is just not going through the Mediterranean Sea. So tankettes only it is. Aka, nothing to stop even French light tanks in big enough numbers to crew any defense line. I also note a lack of the 3e DM for the French, based in Marocco. And there is the fact that Allied can negotiate with Franco too to buy his neutrality with things like some supplies like phosphates and the likes... They paid to keep him neutral OTL, they would have a pretty big incentive to do so ITTL.\n\nThat being said, I object about the idea of an early fall of Mussolini ITTL. The risk will be so blatant for Germany's southern flank when Barbarossa isn't still triggerred than even Hitler will see the need to prop him up... With the resources available and as long as Barbarossa isn't (too much) jeopardized by such efforts. Mussolini's fall depends not just on Italy's defeats, but also the lack of means and will from Germans to keep supporting the Italians, while the situation makes it clear that Germany is on the track for total defeat (like the fall of Sicily to Allied forces including Americans in Fall 1942, while Barbarossa is running after snag after snag).\n\nThey actually don't even have that. These tanks arrived with a convoy by early July 1940.

They paid to keep him neutral OTL, they would have a pretty big incentive to do so ITTL.\n\nTrue, but I didn't want to make a best case for Allies.\n\nAs MN is committed to the protection of the evacuation until end of July and it's too early to have a very efficient Lybia blocade, one can assume the M11/39 will be delivered. OTOH, they won't be on front line at the beginning of the French attack. They will be used for Tripoli defense or they will be excellent targets for AdA once out of the city, orchards out of Tripoli are not as dense as in Normandy 1944.\n\nI already mentionned the 3e DM in a previous post but, as it was dedicated to Morocco defense, I don't take it into account. At that time, Franco will won't be 100 % clear for the Allies.\n\nBTW, I ommitted the Goumiers in Tunisia, 3,000 men of high value."
