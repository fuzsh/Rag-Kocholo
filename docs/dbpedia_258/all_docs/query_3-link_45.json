        "meta_description": "James Vincent Forrestal was born on 15 February 1892, in Matteawan (now Beacon), New York . His father, an Irish immigrant who arrived in the United States in 1857, managed a construction company. After graduating from high school in 1908, Forrestal worked for three years on local newspapers in New York State and then entered Dartmouth College as a freshman in 1911. The following year he transferred to Princeton University in New Jersey , but left in 1915 a few credits short of his degree, apparently due to academic and financial difficulties. During his time at both schools he also participated in boxing, tennis and wrestling. He then worked briefly as a financial reporter, a clerk for a zinc company and as a tobacco salesman. The next year Forrestal joined an investment banking house, William A. Read & Company of New York (which became Dillon, Read & Company in 1923), as a bond salesman. World War I interrupted his career in finance, however, and he enlisted in the U.S. Navy as a seaman second class on 2 June 1917. The young sailor became enthused by naval aviation and he took flight training with British instructors from the Royal Flying Corps at Camp Borden, considered to be the birthplace of the Royal Canadian Air Force, and at Deseronto, both in Ontario, Canada . He commissioned as an ensign, Naval Reserve Flying Corps (NRFC) at Boston, Massachusetts, on 17 November of that year, and he gained his wings of gold as Naval Aviator No. 154 [HTA, heavier-than-air] on 6 December 1917. Soon thereafter, Forrestal served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations. Following the Armistice, Forrestal, discharged from the Navy with the rank of lieutenant, NRFC, on 30 December 1919, returned to banking through 1940. He rose rapidly in the company, becoming a partner in 1923, vice president in 1926, and president in 1938. Meanwhile, he met and courted Josephine Ogden, a beautiful 26-year-old chorus girl for the Ziegfeld Follies, and after a tempestuous romance the couple married on 13 October 1926, a union that would produce two sons, Michael V., and Peter. Although Jim Forrestal was the man I wanted the bride afterward confided to an interviewer, and their matrimonial voyage began happily, their marriage eventually grounded on the husband's extra-marital affairs and his wife's descent into alcoholism and mental illness. In June 1940, Forrestal accepted a post as a special assistant to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, serving as a liaison for the chief executive in handling the National Defense Program, part of the countrys belated rearmament efforts as it prepared for World War II. In August 1940, the President nominated Forrestal to fill the new position of under secretary of the Navy. Secretary of the Navy William F. Knox [Frank Knox] assigned his under secretary to handle contracts, taxes and legal affairs, and as a liaison with several other government agencies. A highly capable administrator and manager, Forrestal built his office into an efficient organization, and he ran very effectively the Navy's machinery for industrial mobilization and procurement, a vast system that ultimately produced the largest fleet ever to put to sea. The seemingly tireless under secretary made numerous trips across the country and to the far-flung battlefields, coming under fire by the Japanese more than once during inspection and morale-building tours on Kwajalein and Iwo Jima. When a heart attack took Secretary Knox, Forrestal succeeded him on 19 May 1944. He guided the Navy through the last year of the war and into the two difficult years of demobilization after the Japanese surrendered. Forrestal visited Joint Task Force 1 at Bikini Lagoon in the Marshall Islands for Test Able of Operation Crossroads to witness the detonation of an atomic bomb and its effects upon over 90 ships, together with weapons and equipment, during late June and early July 1946. The explosion stunned the secretary, who made a number of references during interviews over succeeding days to the tremendous power unleashed by the blast and its effect upon viewers. Complex global problems made more urgent by the Cold War confronted the nation, however, and planners developed a new national security system to begin functioning without delay. Forrestal participated prominently in the development of the National Security Act of 1947, even though he initially opposed unification services. Nonetheless, under pressure from President Harry S. Truman and others, Forrestal made use of the 1945 Eberstadt report and negotiations with Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson to play a primary role in shaping the initial form of the plans. Although the President preferred Patterson as his first choice for secretary of defense, the latter intended to return to private life. The President's subsequent selection of Forrestal, however ironic it might appear given the Secretary's resistance to unification, was deserved and logical considering his long experience in the Defense establishment and dedication to effective administration. Tensions between the Western Allies and the East Bloc continued to build and intelligence analysts feared that Yugoslav Marshal Josip Broz [Tito] might attempt to seize the Adriatic city of Trieste, still occupied by U.S. and British troops to ensure the orderly transition of power following the Axis collapse. Therefore, when President Harry S Truman selected Forrestal as the first secretary of defense, he also directed that be sworn-in several days earlier than originally scheduled, on 17 September 1947. Forrestal brought to his new office a deep distrust of the Soviets and a determination to make the new national security structure workable. He recognized the magnitude of the job; he wrote to a friend shortly after announcement of his appointment confiding his serious apprehensions about the future of the new organization. He soon discovered that perhaps the chief obstacle to accomplishing his objectives would be the inherent weakness in the secretary of defenses powers as defined in the National Security Act. Another problem became the existence of virtually autonomous heads for the military departments. These organizational difficulties, combined with a steady escalation of Cold War tensions, ensured 18 months of frustration. By February 1948, the Soviets had largely completed their network of satellite nations across eastern Europe, as communists supported by Moscow seized control in Czechoslovakia. That June, the Soviets blockaded land routes from the western zones of Germany to Berlin, forcing the Americans and their allies to initiate an airlift which supplied Berlin until Moscow relaxed the blockade more than 10 months later. In the meantime, war broke out in Palestine between the Arabs and Israelis. As these events occurred, Congress approved the Marshall Plan, providing economic aid for 16 European nations, and in June 1948 the Senate adopted the Vandenberg Resolution, encouraging the administration to enter into collective defense arrangements. The Americans and British led in developing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), formally established in April 1949. On the other side of the world, the Chinese communists defeated the Nationalists and drove them from the mainland, leading in 1949 to their emergence as a growing threat to freedom within Asia. The national security apparatus played an important role in the development of U.S. policies and programs to meet these Cold War challenges. Forrestal believed strongly in the need for close coordination of defense and foreign policy and saw the National Security Council as a major instrument for accomplishing this coordination. Although President Truman deemed the council a subordinate advisory body he met infrequently with it before the Korean War erupted in June 1950. Forrestal thought it should originate policy proposals and provide firm guidance for strategic planning. He labored hard, for the most part unsuccessfully, to increase its influence. In addition, during these years many Western leaders feared that the Soviets would use their enormous armed forces to conquer Western Europeans, who World War II largely weakened and made destitute. These men sought desperately for aid to brunt the (perceived) Russian steamroller and embraced many former Axis leaders due to the latter-s expertise in and dedication to containing communism. Forrestal became one of these leaders who established a chain of contacts and infrastructure with émigré anti-communists, including the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists [OUN, better known by their code name of Nactigall, or Nightingale], a group of zealously xenophobic Ukrainians who fought both the Poles and the Russians from World War I onward. Some of these men gained a notorious reputation for supporting Nazi efforts to exterminate Jews, Gypsies and other victims of the Holocaust. While the public did not become aware of these classified operations for sometime, the highly publicized War Crimes trials drew attention to the atrocities of the Holocaust, and to those even remotely affiliated with them in whatever manner. Although it is unknown to what extent his association with these men affected Forrestal's mental state, on his final day the Secretary began to copy a Greek poem entitled The Chorus of Ajax by Sophocles; he stopped after writing the first syllable of the final word of one of the lines: Nightingale. National security issues plagued the Secretary and the defense budget became a source of tension between Forrestal and Truman. Due to public pressures to limit defense expenditures and his predilection for a balanced budget, Truman would not agree to budget levels proposed by Forrestal or the larger amounts desired by the services. Disagreements between the services over roles and missions complicated the matter. Because the budget limits Truman imposed intensified the competition for scarce funds, the services developed elaborate rationales justifying their views of roles and missions and the funds to support them. The Air Force argued that strategic air power as exemplified by long-range bombers carrying nuclear weapons could be key factor in future wars, and that service wanted funds to support 70 combat groups as well as exclusive use of atomic weapons. On the other hand, the Navy wanted to build large flush-deck carriers from which it could launch naval aircraft carrying atomic weapons. These and other differences among the services surfaced especially during annual consideration of the budget. For all the problems, Forrestal could list 15 solid accomplishments in the process of unification in his first report as secretary of defense in December 1948. These included the formulation of long-range and short-range strategic plans, the development of an integrated defense budget for FY 1950, the definition of service roles and missions, the coordination of service procurement efforts, and the establishment of additional overseas unified commands. Forrestal observed that the mere passage of the National Security Act did not mean the accomplishment of its objectives overnight. The most difficult part of the task of unification is to bring conflicting ideas into harmonyHow fast we complete the process of resolution will depend on the speed with which we achieve the harmony of thought which is inherent in true unification. I am confident that we shall reach that accord. The 1949 amendments to the National Security Act stand as testimony to Forrestals determination to improve the Defense structure. The 1949 amendments began the legislative process of clarifying and expanding the powers of the secretary of defense. Centralization of authority in the Office of the Secretary of Defense became a constant objective under Forrestal and many of his successors. Unfortunately, Forrestal no longer served in the Pentagon when Congress approved these amendments. Forrestal struggled with recurring bouts of despair, hopelessness and widely erratic mood swings, that the strain of the war exacerbated and that caused the Secretary to resign on 28 March 1949. Psychiatrist Dr. William Menninger of the Menninger Clinic of Topeka, Kansas, diagnosed his patients disorder as reactive depression, a malady then commonly identified among veterans returning from the fronts with combat fatigue. Although Menninger recommended that Forrestal enter his clinic for treatment, Navy officials dispatched Captain George N. Raines, the chief psychiatrist at the U.S. Naval Hospital at Bethesda, Md., a suburb of the nations capital, who counseled that Forrestal should enter that facility instead. While at Bethesda, however, he continued to experience further attacks of depression and resolved to take his own life by tying off one end of his dressing gown sash to a radiator and falling from the window of his room on the thirteenth floor to the roof of a third story passageway below, on 22 May 1949. The country acknowledged his services to American security and freedom through two world wars by interning Forrestal with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery three days later. The Finnish artist Kalervo Kallio sculpted a bronze bust of Forrestal which officials unveiled at the Mall entrance to the Pentagon on 22 September 1950. Some months after he left office, the House Armed Services Committee, with which he worked closely, described his administration as secretary of defense as",

Johnson in command.\n\nShip Insignia:\n\nCaption: Ship's Insignia\n\nChronology and Significant Events:\n\n1 Oct 1955: Secretary of the Navy Charles S. Thomas, RADM Ingolf N. Kiland, Commandant of the Fifth Naval District, and W.E. Blewett, Jr., President of the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, attended the ceremony when the ship hoisted aloft her commissioning pennant at 1430 at Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia; Captain Roy L. Johnson was the first commanding officer. The huge aircraft carriers of the Forrestal class were so large when compared to previous carriers that veterans referred to them as supercarriers. Forrestal commissioned with four steam catapults, two forward and two on her angled flight deck, enabling her to launch aircraft more rapidly. During the post-World War II period several developments prepared naval aviation to provide a credible nuclear deterrent against East Bloc expansion: building Forrestal, reducing the weight and dimensions of nuclear weapons, and developing aircraft capable of dropping them, including Douglas A-3 Skywarriors. From her home port in Norfolk, Va., Forrestal spent the first year of her commissioned service in intensive training operations off the Virginia capes and in the Caribbean. An important assignment became training aviators in the use of her advanced facilities, a duty on which she often operated out of Mayport, Fla.\n\nDec 1955-Jan 1956: Helicopter Utility Squadron (HU)-2 Detachment 42 operated a pair of Piasecki (Vertol) UH-25B Retrievers on board for search and rescue purposes to winch survivors of downed aircraft out of the water. Meanwhile, a pair of McDonnell Douglas A-4 Skyhawks, one a night attack variant and the other an electronic warfare conversion, together with a couple of Beech TC-45J Kansans, also flew from the ship to qualify their pilots to operate from carriers. Just after the New Year Fighter Squadron (VF)-41 flew 11 McDonnell F-2C Banshees on board for carrier qualifications, joined by 14 Douglas A-1H Skyraiders and one Kansan from Attack Squadron (VA)-42 and 13 Vought F7U-3M Cutlass, from VA-86. These became the first aircraft to operate from the carrier.\n\n3 Jan 1956: CDR Ralph L. Werner, commanding Air Task Group-1, made the first fixed wing aircraft landing on board Forrestal when he made three touch-and-go landings after which he made the first full-stop landing, in his North American FJ-3 Fury during the afternoon watch at about 1440. A few hours later he piloted the same aircraft to make the first catapult launch from the huge carrier. Meanwhile, CDR William M. Harnish, commanding officer of VF-21, made the second landing, also in a Fury, at approximately 1445. LT Vincent Darcey of the air group was the landing signal officer for both traps. Sailors painted both aircraft in the Navy's new white and gray 'atomic' paint scheme. The ship sailed to the east of Norfolk.\n\n24 Jan-28 Mar 1956: Forrestal completed her shakedown cruise in Caribbean waters, operating principally off Guantánamo Bay, Cuba .\n\n23-27 Apr 1956: The ship accomplished her final acceptance trials off the coast of Virginia.\n\n4 May 1956: The carrier entered the yard for repairs which included replacing her original propeller shafts. Forrestal's Command History Report noted that completing this work \"greatly improved her performance.\"\n\n29 Oct-12 Dec 1956: Worsening tensions in the Middle East erupted into Operation Kadesh, Israeli attacks against the Egyptians in the Sinai Peninsula and along the Suez Canal. The next day the British and French issued an ultimatum to the Israelis and Egyptians to pull their forces back 10 miles from either side of the vital waterway  to bring about the early cessation of hostilities and to safeguard the free passage of the canal. The Israelis accepted the terms of the ultimatum but the Egyptians angrily refused to comply. ADM Arleigh A. Burke, the Chief of Naval Operations, alerted the Sixth Fleet to standby to evacuate Americans stranded by the crisis in Haifa and Tel Aviv, Israel, Beirut, Lebanon, and Alexandria, Egypt. By 4 November, ships evacuated 1,702 people, naval helos took out 165 more and Air Force crews pulled 310 refugees from harm's way, often during extremely perilous situations from gunfire, errant bombs or navigational hazards. Just as destroyer Strong (DD-758) arrived at Gaza and anchored 3,000 yards off the port to disembark 21 members of a UN truce inspection team, an Egyptian ammunition dump exploded, showering the area with molten fragments and debris. From their vantage point crewmembers also observed mortar and small arms fire as the Israelis and Egyptians fought over the strategic city, culminating in strafing and bombing runs by Israeli aircraft against Egyptian troops who refused to surrender. The Sailors also witnessed the pitiable spectacle as the fighting forced hundreds of people to leave on foot, carrying their few belongings as they drove sheep and goats before them. Meanwhile, the Anglo-French ultimatum expired at 0430 on Halloween, and the two allies dispatched a huge expeditionary force that bombarded Egyptian forces across Egypt. At dawn on 5 November they began Operation Musketeer, landing commandoes, Marines and specialized troops at key points along the strategic canal to prevent the Egyptians from closing it by sinking ships or laying mines. The fighting raged into the next day, when British Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden announced a cease-fire notice to take effect at midnight of the 6th. Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester B. Pearson proposed the creation of a UN peacekeeping force to separate the combatants, and a majority of that body's members agreed to support his resolution. Orders directed a vast number of American ships to rendezvous and concentrate in Atlantic waters off east coast ports, including Forrestal, which put to sea from Mayport. Due to concerns over possible Soviet submarine attacks should the crisis escalate, CINCLANTFLT authorized ships proceeding independently to do so at high speed, consistent with weather and sea conditions. Ships set sail from various U.S. ports, arriving at holding areas and mustering ports as type commanders desired by 10 December. By 17 November, RADM Murr E. Arnold, Commander, Carrier Division 4 and Task Force 26, broke his flag from Forrestal in command of a powerful concentration of ships that rendezvoused near 36-30-N, 27-18-17-W, in the eastern Atlantic around the Azores Islands, also including; attack aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt (CVA-42), heavy cruiser Des Moines (CA-134), radar picket destroyers Charles P. Cecil (DDR-835), Corry (DDR-817), O-Hare (DDR-889) and Stickell (DDR-888), destroyers Douglas H. Fox (DD-779), Healy (DD-672), John Hood (DD-655), Laffey (DD-724), Lowry (DD-770), Robinson (DD-562), Sigourney (DD-643) and Stormes (DD-780), store ship Rigel (AF-58) and oiler Severn (AO-61). Additional ships relieved some of these vessels during the following days to enable the original ships to take on fuel or achieve repairs. The carriers conducted air operations \"as practicable\" to enhance their readiness, and utilized their aircraft to evaluate experiments determining the maximum air group loading for \"executing war missions\" as they maintained readiness to enter the Mediterranean should their presence be necessary. CINCLANTFLT tentatively scheduled attack aircraft carrier Lake Champlain (CVA-39) to relieve Franklin D. Roosevelt. Forrestal returned to Norfolk to prepare for her first deployment with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean.\n\nCaption: The ship awaited her turn to refuel while steaming in the Mediterranean Sea during the Jordanian crisis, on 29 April 1957. Oiler Caloosahatchee (AO-98) is ahead, with attack aircraft carrier Lake Champlain (CVA-39) and heavy cruiser Salem (CA-139) alongside. National Archives and Records Administration No. 80-G-K-22688.\n\n15 Jan-22 Jul 1957: The ship made her first deployment to the Mediterranean. On this, as on her succeeding tours of duty in the Mediterranean, Forrestal visited many ports to allow dignitaries and the general public to come on board and view the tremendous power for peace she represented. For military observers, she staged underway demonstrations to illustrate her capacity to bring air power to and from the sea in military operations on any scale.\n\n2-3 Feb 1957: The ship passed through the Strait of Gibraltar for the first time and entered Mediterranean waters. During this deployment she also conducted underway demonstration cruises for Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace of Monaco, and for Mohammad R. Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran.\n\n29 Mar-3 Apr 1957: Forrestal steamed off the Greek isle of Rhodes.\n\n5-7 Apr 1957: The ship appeared briefly off Beirut, Lebanon.\n\n17 Apr 1957: VADM Charles R. Brown, Commander, Sixth Fleet, escorted Sir Robert Laycock, the British Governor of Malta, and 26 other high ranking British government and military officials including VADM Durnford Slater, RN, RADM Geoffrey Brittian, RN, and RADM Lee Barber, RN, onto the ship to witness flight operations and aircraft demonstrations. The British officials visited as guests of RADM Arnold and CAPT William E. Ellis, the commanding officer of Forrestal, and VADM Brown arrived on board from his flagship, heavy cruiser Salem (CA-139).\n\n24 Apr-5 May 1957: A crisis occurred in the Middle East concerning rising pan-Arab nationalism, the withdrawal of European colonial powers and intrigues between Western and East Bloc factions, which threatened the throne of Jordanian King Hussein bin Talal (also known as King Hussein I). On the evening of the 25th, Admiral Burke directed VADM Brown to deploy his forces to the eastern Mediterranean to ensure that the Jordanians maintained their independence and not be subverted from within or attacked from without. \"Once again,\" VADM Brown explained in a message to all hands of the Sixth Fleet, \"we find ourselves dropping everything and rushing to the scene of the fire.\" By the next day Forrestal, Lake Champlain, heavy cruisers Des Moines and Salem and their destroyers rendezvoused and proceeded eastward at best possible speed into the crisis. Crew members worked at a feverish pace to prepare for action and at 0705 on the 27th, VADM Brown reported that he could launch attack aircraft and fighters at \"first light tomorrow\" should the emergency escalate. Concerns that they would have to evacuate Americans within the country prompted planning to deploy Marines into the Jordanian capital of Amman as armed escorts while helicopters flying from Forrestal covered the evacuations. Meanwhile, amphibious forces made for Beirut, Lebanon, and upon arriving they stood ready to deploy additional troops and equipment ashore or to evacuate United States civilians. These two groups of ships continued to maintain station in the eastern Mediterranean until diplomats diffused the tension. \"In ten short days,\" VADM Brown told his men as they returned on the 5th, \"from the time of our sudden departure for the eastern Mediterranean the striking fleet is back in Italian waters, for a NATO exercise which begins tonight. While everyone must be pleased to be back, I hope no one loses sight of the larger significance of what has happened. In the brief period of time we have successfully carried out an important national mission in the eastern Mediterranean and we have met an important NATO commitment in the central Mediterranean. The distance between the two assignments is about 1,500 miles as the crow flies. This performance has been a dramatic demonstration of the mobility and flexibility of the fleet and one in which all can be proud to have had a part.\"\n\n13-14 Jul 1957: The ship passed through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Atlantic . Attack aircraft carrier Randolph (CVA-15) relieved Forrestal at the British dockyard and naval station at \"The Rock\" on 14 July.\n\n22 Jul 1957: Forrestal returned to Norfolk for exercises off the North Carolina coast in preparation for her first NATO exercise in the North Sea , Operation Strikeback.\n\n24 Jul-11 Aug 1957: The carrier completed work at Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n3 Sep-22 Oct 1957: During Strikeback, Forrestal drilled in the highly important task of coordinating United States naval power with that of other NATO nations. Forrestal steamed off the Clyde River Estuary in Scotland (14-16 September) and visited Southampton in England (30 September-11 October). Observers estimated that as many as 65,000 people visited or viewed the ship at the latter port, including U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James John H. Whitney.\n\n20 Dec 1957-20 Feb 1958: Forrestal's crew and shipyard workers accomplished repairs and upkeep at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n28 Mar-24 May 1958: The ship participated in a series of major fleet exercises off the North Carolina , Georgia and Florida coasts, as well as taking part in experimental flight operations. She also made a brief visit to Miami , Fla. (19-21 May). During LantRaEx 1-58 in May, LTJGs Strang and Woods of VA-85 flew two A-1H Skyraiders from Forrestal as she steamed off the coast of Jacksonville nonstop to NAS North Island in California. They completed their flight normally flying at altitudes below 1,000 feet to demonstrate the low level and long range capabilities of their squadron, and then returned nonstop to the carrier two days later.\n\n11-17 Jul 1958: Rival Lebanese political and religious factions clashed resulting in rioting that threatened that Levantine country. Tensions produced a crisis when Muslims rebelled against the Lebanese government at the same time that Iraqi army officers overthrew the pro-Western Hashemite monarchy in a coup détat in Baghdad on 14 July. Lebanese President Camille Chamoun requested assistance from President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the latter initiated Operation Blue Bat on the following day, which included the Sixth Fleet and supporting Air Force and Army commands landing over 14,000 Marines and soldiers at Beirut to restore order and protect Americans trapped in the fighting. During the crisis Forrestal operated in the eastern Atlantic to back-up naval operations in the Mediterranean, and to be ready to intervene if the crisis escalated. She sailed from Norfolk to embark CVG-10 at Mayport two days later, and then she patrolled the Atlantic until returning to Virginian waters when the crisis subsided and the Americans ultimately withdrew most troops from Lebanon.\n\n2 Sep 1958-12 Mar 1959: Setting sail from Norfolk at 0800 Forrestal began her second tour of duty in the Mediterranean as she combined a program of training, patrol, and participation in major exercises with ceremonial hospitality and public visiting. The A-4Bs of VA-12 became the first Skyhawks to deploy on board the ship.\n\n12 Sep 1958: The ship passed through the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\n16-17 Sep 1958: Forrestal relieved attack aircraft carrier Saratoga (CVA-60) at Augusta Bay, Sicily.\n\n14-27 Oct 1958: The carrier encountered \"a major failure\" of her No. 1 Catapult, however, and her crew and civilian technicians accomplished the extensive repairs while visiting Naples, Italy, the first time that they attempted such work outside of a shipyard. Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy led her guest list during this cruise.\n\n2 Dec 1958: RADM Roy L. Johnson relieved RADM Charles D. Griffin as Commander, Carrier Division 4, during a ceremony on board Forrestal at Barcelona, Spain.\n\n18 Dec 1958-3 Jan 1959: The crew and civilian workers again accomplished extensive repairs to a catapult while visiting Naples, Italy, this time to No. 2. The ship then led Task Force 60 in Operation Big Deal, a joint Second and Sixth Fleet exercise.\n\nCaption: Forrestal (CVA-59) entered Naples, Italy, circa early 1959 (the Department of Defense released the photograph on 19 May 1959), as Mount Vesuvius towers over her in the distance. Aircraft visible on the crowded flight deck include Douglas A-3B Skywarriors of Heavy Attack Squadron (VAH)-5, Douglas F-6 Skyrays of Fighter Squadron (VF)-102 and McDonnell Douglas A-4B Skyhawks of Attack Squadron (VA)-12. Naval Historical Center Photo No. 97658.\n\n1-2 Mar 1959: Franklin D. Roosevelt relieved Forrestal at Pollensa Bay at Palma de Mallorca in the Balearic Islands.\n\n3-4 Mar 1959: Forrestal passed through the Strait of Gibraltar westbound.\n\n12 Mar 1959: Returning to Norfolk, Forrestal continued to train new aircrew, constantly maintaining her readiness for instant reaction to any demand for her services brought on by international events.\n\n28 Mar 1959: King Hussein I of Jordan visited the ship for a luncheon while she moored to Pier 12 at Norfolk.\n\n1 Apr 1959: Forrestal entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for her first regular overhaul.\n\n30 Sep-1 Oct 1959: Forrestal sortied to evade Hurricane Hannah as the storm swept toward the Virginia area with winds that peaked at 130 mph on 1 October, however, the hurricane turned to eastward and dropped to an extra tropical storm south of Iceland.\n\nNov 1959: The ship completed a weapons evaluation exercise with USAF pilots.\n\n14 Feb 1960: Forrestal relieved Saratoga at Pollensa Bay. Among the ports she subsequently visited usual to a Mediterranean deployment the ship put into Split, Yugoslavia, a port-of-call that generated heated controversy in the media due to the tensions still existing between the communists and the West.\n\nCaption: A pair of Douglas EA-1E Skyraiders (BuNos 135163 and 135183) from Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW)-12 flew over Forrestal (CVA-59) as she sailed with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, on 25 April 1960. Naval Historical Center Photo No. NH 97655.\n\n7 Mar 1960: The Bureau of Ships issued a report concerning the endurance of Forrestal and her sister ships, which stated in part that \"Conventionally powered Aircraft Carriers should have sufficient range and endurance to allow approach to the target, high-speed run-in, attack, retirement, and a sufficient amount of reserve fuel to replenish Escorts.\"\n\n9 Sep-22 Oct 1960: The carrier completed repairs and maintenance in drydock at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n26 Oct 1960: RADM Forsyth Massey relieved RADM Robert E. Dixon as Commander, Carrier Division 4, during a ceremony on board at Norfolk .\n\n21 Mar 1961: Archbishop Makarios III, President of Cyprus and ethnarch [national leader] of Greek Cypriots, visited the ship as the guest of VADM George W. Anderson, Jr., Commander, Sixth Fleet, and RADM Massey.\n\n9 Aug 1961: Secretary of the Navy John B. Connally visited the ship and spoke to the crew over her closed circuit television system, congratulating the men for achieving their second coveted Battle Efficiency \"E\" award.\n\n25 Aug 1961: By the time Forrestal returned from her fourth deployment to the Mediterranean, CVG-8 amassed 26,000 flight hours, the equivalent of almost three years flying during less accelerated operations. In addition, the ship herself celebrated her 60,000th arrested landing. USMC LTV F-8 Crusaders from Marine Fighter Squadron (VMF)-333 also qualified for carrier operations on board Forrestal.\n\nSep 1961-13 Jan 1962: Forrestal completed work at Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n18 Jan-late Feb 1962: The ship accomplished a six-week refresher training cruise off the east coast that extended down into Caribbean waters, focusing upon the Guant-namo Bay area. She also visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti. In addition, Mercury-Atlas 6 [MA-6] launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 0947 on 20 February 1962. LCOL John H. Glenn, Jr., USMC, the 40-year-old astronaut, completed three orbits about the earth in 4 hours 55 minutes to become the first American to orbit the planet. Glenn flew spacecraft Friendship 7 in her 75,679 mile voyage at a maximum speed of 17,544.1 miles per hour. Describing his re-entry as a \"real fireball,\" Glenn splashed down in the Atlantic some 166 miles east of Grand Turk Island in the Bahamas, about 800 miles southeast of Bermuda. Destroyer Noa (DD-841) recovered the astronaut after he spent 21 minutes in the water, and a helo flew him on to antisubmarine warfare support aircraft carrier Randolph (CVS-15) at 1745. Although Glenn did not land nearby, Forrestal stood ready as one of the potential tracking and measuring stations for the epochal flight.\n\n9-14 Apr 1962: Forrestal combined operations with aircraft carrier Enterprise (CVAN-65) for a presidential cruise. President John F. Kennedy and his entourage arrived on board Enterprise on 14 April. The busy day included sea and air power demonstrations for the President and many distinguished guests, including most of his cabinet, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, many congressmen and about 30 foreign ambassadors, all hosted by VADM John M. Taylor, Commander, Second Fleet. About 20 ships participated in the exercise off the Virginia and North Carolina coasts. A \"spectacular display\" culminating in a mass flyby and recovery by naval aircraft entertained guests. CDR Joseph P. Moorer, commanding officer of VF-62, LCDR Joseph S. Elmer, LT Richard C. Oliver and LT William F. Heiss of that squadron shook hands with President Kennedy on board Enterprise at the conclusion of the demonstration. Forrestal also hosted Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and several senators and congressmen during the cruise.\n\nMid to late Apr 1962: Following the Presidential Cruise, Forrestal returned to the Caribbean for the Atlantic Fleet exercise LantPhibEx 1-62, and took advantage of the opportunity to visit Port of Spain, Trinidad, where the Carrier Division 4 band entertained crowds.\n\nJul 1962: The ship visited New York City for Independence Day festivities. During one of the days of her week-long stay, almost 22,000 curious visitors swarmed on board.\n\n6-12 Jul 1962: Leaving New York waters, Forrestal participated with Enterprise in LantFlex 2-62, a nuclear strike exercise under the command of RADM Reynold D. Hogle, Commander, Carrier Division 4 and Commander, TF 24. Enterprise launched eight -pre-planned- strikes and six call strikes while operating in the Virginia capes area against targets ranging from the Tidewater area to central Florida.\n\n3 Aug 1962: Forrestal weighed anchor and set sail for another Med deployment. This sail included 12,900 officers and men from commands along the east coast assigned initially to the Second Fleet, manning Enterprise and Forrestal, guided missile heavy cruiser Boston (CAG-1), from which RADM Robert H. Weeks, Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 10, broke his flag, heavy cruiser Newport News (CA-148), from which VADM John M. Taylor, Commander, Second Fleet, broke his flag, 13 destroyers from Destroyer Squadrons 8 and 14, ammunition ships Shasta (AE-6) and Suribachi (AE-21) and oiler Chukawan (AO-100). This became the last time that A-1 Skyraiders of VA-85 deployed on board Forrestal, and her first deployment with Mach 2.2 capable McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs of VF-74. Soviet Tupolev Tu-95 [Tu-20] Bears would fly the huge journey-hundreds of miles-from their fields near Murmansk in the Kola Peninsula to find the ship as she crossed the Atlantic. Russian electronic specialists operated their sophisticated sensors probing for the carrier-s radar, and when they discovered her they would drop down for a closer look, but Phantom IIs from the ship would intercept the intruders and escort them out of the area. Even during the tensions of the Cold War most of these encounters were professional and the rivals often waved to each other.\n\n13-17 Aug 1962: Forrestal participated in RipTide III, an exercise with allied aircraft carriers in the eastern Atlantic that demonstrated interchangeability, compatibility and reliance with NATO allies including the British, French, and Portuguese.\n\n7 Sep 1962: Forrestal participated in Lafayette II, an exercise that involved 14 scheduled conventional strikes coordinated with aircraft from Enterprise against multiple targets to the French Low Level Route in southern France. French air force and naval aircraft opposed them.\n\n6 Oct 1962: NATO chiefs of staff embarked Forrestal for a one-day cruise.\n\n16-17 Feb 1963: Enterprise relieved Forrestal at Pollensa Bay.\n\n2 Mar 1963: Forrestal returned to Norfolk. Soviet reconnaissance bombers overflew the carrier en route her return home. Her aircraft flew over 10,300 missions and logged over 23,000 hours in the air during this deployment.\n\nEarly-May-Mid-Jun 1963: The ship completed repairs and upkeep at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n9-19 Sep 1963: Forrestal and ships of Task Force 23 visited Boston , Mass., for the annual convention of the East Coast Navy League. The ship moored at the South Boston Naval Annex on the 12th. The next day RADM John J. Hyland, Commander, Carrier Division 4, welcomed more than 400 delegates to the League and their families as they boarded his flagship for a day's cruise. The carrier stood out of the port on the 16th to return home.\n\n12 Oct 1963: RADM Samuel R. Brown, Jr., one of the ships former skippers, relieved RADM Hyland in hanger deck ceremonies.\n\n30 Oct, 21-22 Nov 1963: LT James H. Flatley, III, and LCDR Walter W. Stovall from the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, and ADJ1 Ed Brennan, a flight engineer from Fleet Tactical Support Squadron (VR)-1, completed 29 touch-and-go landings and 21 full-stop landings and takeoffs in a Lockheed C-130F Hercules (BuNo 149798) on board Forrestal. Flatley and his crew, who also included at times Ted H. Limmer Jr., a civilian safety test pilot from Lockheed-Marietta, made some minor modifications to the Hercules, which Marines loaned to them, by replacing its standard C-130 antiskid braking system with the Hytrol Antiskid Braking System Mk II used in Boeing B-727s and by removing refueling pods from the wings. Crewmembers painted a white center line along the ship's axial deck from bow to ramp to aid Flatley in guiding the huge aircraft. As they made their first landing on the 30th, surface winds of 25 to 30 knots and the resulting choppy sea caused moderate deck motion with a \"noticeable\" yaw, which forced Forrestal to increase speed an additional 10 knots to reduce the yaw motion and to stabilize wind direction. \"I was up on the captain's bridge,\" Lockheed-Georgia Engineering Vice President Arthur E. Flock recalled. \"I watched a man on the ship's bow and that bow must have gone up and down 30 feet.\" Although the Hercules crew encountered 40 to 50 knot winds over the deck, their problems \"considerably lessoned\" as they landed. The plane's right wing tip cleared the ship's island control tower by just under 15 feet as it roared down the flight deck. As Flatley brought the aircraft to a halt crewmembers gathered topside cheered their arrival, and many commented upon the message specially painted on the starboard nose of the fuselage for the occasion: \"Look ma, no hook.\" Lieutenant Flatley received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his efforts. From these tests the Navy concluded that Hercules, could carry 25,000 pounds of cargo and people approximately 2,500 miles and land on board a Forrestal-class or larger carrier, accomplishing their missions with gross weights of up to 121,000 pounds. Analysts also decided, however, that using the huge aircraft for Carrier On-board Delivery (COD) flights would be too risky.\n\nCaption: LT James H. Flatley, III, and his crew brought their Lockheed C-130F Hercules (BuNo 149798) on board, on 30 October 1963. The intrepid pilot completed his mission despite heavy seas and surface winds, for which he received the Distinguished Flying Cross. Naval Historical Center [Aviation] Photo No. NAH-0002005.\n\n6-16 Nov 1963: In between the Hercules trials the ship engaged in various task force operations off the east coast.\n\n4-6 Dec 1963: Forrestal operated with Enterprise in StrikEx I, a combined strike, antisubmarine and air defense exercise conducted in the southeastern United States under Commander, Carrier Division 2.\n\n29 Jul 1964: The ship relieved Enterprise at Pollensa Bay, enabling the latter to rendezvous with guided missile cruiser Long Beach (CGN-9) and guided missile frigate Bainbridge (DLGN-25) for Operation Sea Orbit, the first global circumnavigation by nuclear-powered ships.\n\n29 Nov 1964: LT John F. Barr of VA-83 made the 100,00th landing on board, in his A-4E Skyhawk as the ship steamed in the Mediterranean.\n\n1 Mar 1965: Attack aircraft carrier Shangri-La (CVA-38) relieved Forrestal at Pollensa Bay .\n\n11 May 1965: Miss America 1965 Vonda Kay Van Dyke, Miss Virginia 1965 Mary Montgomery, Miss Portsmouth 1965 and 13 contestants for the Miss Portsmouth crown visited the ship.\n\n21 Nov 1965: RADM Allan K. Fleming, Commander, Carrier Division 4, shifted his flag to Franklin D. Roosevelt at Golfo di Palmas, Sardinia.\n\n14-15 Jan 1966: An Air Force Douglas C-47 Dakota crashed up at 7,680 feet atop Mount Helmos in the Peloponnesian Peninsula in Greece. Later that evening the Sixth Fleet alerted two Kaman UH-2 Seasprite crews (BuNos 149741, an A model, and 150142, a B) from Helicopter Combat Support Squadron (HC)-2 Detachment 59 embarked in Forrestal, to stand by to assist in the search and rescue. Helo crewmembers assigned included CDR Russell, a doctor, LCDRs Raymond K. McCullough and William S. Munro, LTs Mullen, also a doctor, and L.R. Grant, II, LT(JG) Michael E. Howe, ADJ1 Ests P. Morrow, ADJ3 John E. Keto, AE3 Richard T. Ream and AMS3 George T. -D and S- Vaughn, III. Lieutenant Commander McCullough flew the \"A\" Seasprite and LCDR Munro piloted the \"B.\" The men flew to the Royal Hellenic Air Force Base at Araxos overnight, lifting off from Forrestal at around 2000. After an Air Force captain briefed them on the weather and terrain conditions peculiar to the area, the rescuers set off at 0840 the next morning. Although they enjoyed clear weather, bitter cold, high winds up to 35 knots and dangerous turbulence at the mountain crest hampered the helo crews, who also needed to exercise caution while landing due to their concerns regarding the strength of the ice-crusted snow and whether it would bear their weight. LCDR McCullough persevered through six approaches and had to dump his fuel and auxiliary tanks to lighten the aircraft. He finally found a barely adequate landing spot on a saddle-back ridge a few hundred feet above the crash site where the snow leveled off just enough to allow him to touch down. They rescued two Air Force crewmembers from the wreckage, LCOL Dick N. Crowell, USAF, and CAPT Thomas D. Smith, USAF, and LCDR Munro and LT Grant flew in right behind them and pulled SSGT J.L. Ferguson out in a litter. All of the survivors suffered from frostbite and fatigue. The two crews refueled and returned to the scene and retrieved their crewmembers on the groundwho disembarked to assist the victims to board the helosand the bodies of the victims, returning with them to the base camp at 4,000 feet. The weather remained clear until later in the afternoon, when clouds and visibility closed in and caused problems. Because the atmospheric conditions caused their UHF radios to fail, the helo crews relied on a Grumman E-1B Tracer from Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW)-12, and AF 783, an Air Force plane, to relay communications between the rescuers and Forrestal. The Tracer also guided the helos to Araxos during the darkness as the operation began. In addition, an Air Force Kaman H-43 Huskie and Greek mountain climbers assisted the rescuers, and the Huskie evacuated LCOL Frank Bailey, USAF, the last survivor, as well as transporting the bodies down the mountain from the base camp. An Air Force Hercules waited for them at Araxos and when they returned the C-130 flew the casualties out for intensive medical care. Six other crewmembers perished during the crash, and the searchers could not locate two of the bodies due to the extreme circumstances of the crash site.\n\n24 Jan 1966: Forrestal sailed from Taranto, Italy, and in company with guided missile destroyer Conyngham (DDG-17) and destroyers Forrest Royal (DD-872), McCaffery (DD-860), Charles R. Ware (DD-865) and Yarnall (DD-541) comprised Task Group 60.2.\n\n2 Feb 1966: Early in the evening Backwash 100, an F-4B Phantom II, (BuNo 152285), LT William H. Brinks and LT Edward E. Weller of VF-74, launched for a routine night intercept training mission while Forrestal steamed in the Tyrrhenian Sea, at 1802. As 100 climbed through 1,500 feet with both engines at full thrust, a \"loud explosion\" shook the aircraft. The Phantom II immediately began to decelerate, though it finished its climb to 2,200 feet before descending inexorably back to earth. Both men checked their instruments, however, they could not regain control of the F-4B and they ejected, approximately three miles from the ship. A UH-2A crew from HC-2 Detachment 59, LT(JG) Howe, LT Louis R. Grant, AME3 Gary Steele and ATN3 Bill Toth, spotted the survivors within four minutes, thanks largely to the flares and strobe lights which the aircrew deployed fortuitously, and rescued the pilot and radar intercept officer and returned the shaken men to the ship.\n\n5-12 Feb 1966: While Forrestal visited Naples a group of men from the ship attended an audience with Pope Paul VI at Vatican City in Rome.\n\n26-27 Feb 1966: Spanish LGEN Avales, that country's air defense force commander, visited Forrestal for an underway orientation.\n\n28 Feb-3 Mar 1966: The ship participated in Fairgame IV, a joint exercise with the French, including their aircraft carrier Arromanches (R-95), in the Mediterranean. RADM Leslie J. OBrien, Jr., Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 10, transferred over to guided missile frigate MacDonough (DLG-8) on the last day of Fairgame IV, from which he broke his flag until returning to the carrier.\n\n22 Mar 1966: Forrestal put into Taranto for a fleet commander's conference with the Sixth Fleet. Officers and men from numerous commands arrived on board attack aircraft carrier America (CVA-66).\n\n30-31 Mar 1966: Saratoga relieved Forrestal at Pollensa Bay. The next day the latter passed through the Strait of Gibraltar beginning at 2100 on 31 March into the Atlantic en route her home port. The ship completed a deployment that the Navy extended by an additional two weeks. During this deployment, pilots logged 19,000 flight hours and flew over 11,000 sorties.\n\n11-14 Apr 1966: Forrestal offloaded her ammunition prior to entering Norfolk Naval Shipyard for an overhaul.\n\n15 Apr 1966-27 Jan 1967: Forrestal sailed up the Elizabeth River as tugboats then eased her into her berth to prepare for what the ships Command History Report referred to as a massive facelifting at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Vice Admiral Charles T. Booth, II, Commander, Naval Air Force Atlantic Fleet, inspected the ship on 10 June 1966. The admiral took the opportunity to award CDR Joe D. Adkins, the ships air operations officer, the Distinguished Flying Cross for his bravery while flying missions over North Vietnam as the commanding officer of VA-72, embarked in attack aircraft carrier Independence (CVA-62). Forrestal completed about one-third of the overhaul when she floated from drydock on 10 July. Beginning on 1 August sailors and civilian technicians commenced installing the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) into the ship-s systems. The NTDS, an automatic combat direction system designed to eliminate human error by doing away with \"grease-pencil plotting,\" became the principal system of her Combat Information Center. The speed of modern warfare demanded an increase in plotting and disseminating information and the Navy intended NTDS to provide a comprehensive picture of ships, aircraft and subs. Meanwhile, RADM Harvey P. Lanham, Commander, Carrier Division 2, shifted his flag to Forrestal, which relieved Carrier Division 4 (19 October). The admiral awarded LCDR Richard T. Theriault, Forrestal's First Lieutenant, with the Bronze Star for his distinguished service in Vietnam, on 28 October. The crew celebrated their gradual return to operational status when they lit-off one of their eight boilers on Halloween, which provided the men their own steam and electrical power after receiving pierside services after seven months. Tragedy struck the men at the shipyard at 1333 on 1 November, however, when a UH-2B (BuNo 152193) from amphibious assault ship Guadalcanal (LPH-7), moored across from Forrestal at Berth 35 at Pier 5, crashed onto the pier between the two ships. The Seasprite entered what investigators determined to be an \"uncontrolled\" flight immediately upon lifting-off from the flight deck of Guadalcanal for a brief test hop to NAS Oceana; after barely reaching four to five feet into the air the helo's rotor blades struck the flight deck and then the aircraft careened over the starboard side of Guadalcanal onto the pier. The Seasprite's impact threw debris and shards-including lethal metal fragments from the helo's disintegrating rotor blades-at people working in the vicinity, killing four men: three Navy; LCDR John C. Thoma, AN Joseph A. Anzalone, AN Garry A. Whipp; and one civilian, Mannie McCutcheon of the yards riggers and laborers shop, and injured 19 more men. Debris also flew into a railroad car on the pier and at both ships, damaging a pair of boats on the flight deck of Forrestal, and hurtled into nearby buildings with such force that they tore holes into cement block walls. Forrestal's crew joined other men from across the yard to help their shipmates to provide damage control and to aid victims, and over 100 crewmembers volunteered to donate blood to injured men. Following the catastrophe, the crew held a fast cruise, which simulates at sea operations while still moored to a pier (10-11 December). Just after the New Year the ship stood down the channel for the first time since her overhaul began for post repair trials off the Virginia capes (0800 on 9-15 January 1967). The ship actually completed her trials, which included limited air operations, at 1300 on Saturday 14 January, however, dense fog rolled in and the shipyard refused the carrier permission to moor due to navigational hazards, so the carrier anchored off Pier 12 at the naval station until the next day, when the shipyard allowed her to return. Forrestal sailed from the yard on the 23rd and returned to Norfolk.\n\n6-10 Feb 1967: The carrier reached the ammunition anchorage to load a full complement of ammunition for the first time since her repairs.\n\n14 Feb-16 Mar 1967: The ship completed refresher training in Cuban waters. Forrestal anchored out at NS Guantánamo Bay (17-18 February). She attained her 120,000th arrested landing on the third day of actual refresher training (22 February).\n\n11 Apr-6 May 1967: Forrestal completed a series of exercises in the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Range designed to simulate the grueling conditions her men could expect during the Vietnam War, including alpha strikes against major targets. In addition, she took part in Operation Clovehitch III, providing support for ground forces in the all-service exercise.\n\n13 May 1967: While testing her automatic carrier landing system off the Virginia Capes the ship recorded her 124,000th landing using that system, when LT Howard L. Reedy of VA-65 trapped on board.\n\n6 Jun 1967: Embarking CVW-17 the ship sailed at 1630 from Pier 12 at Norfolk for her only western Pacific deployment. Forrestal held drills on most days while sailing into harm's way and pilots and aircrew studied charts and held briefings during the voyage. Grumman A-6As of VA-65 and Grumman E-2As from VAW-123 embarked as the first Intruders and Hawkeyes, respectively, to deploy on board Forrestal.\n\n13-16 Jun 1967: RADM Lanham and observers from Independence led the ship's Operational Readiness Inspection.\n\n19-20 Jun 1967: Forrestal's Command History Report observed that 4,330 pollywogs \"fearing for their lives\" revolted and held 500 Loyal Shellbacks captive. Just after midnight the pollywogs stole many of the shellback's cards and held a mock initiation during an \"illegal ceremony.\" The next day as the ship crossed the equator, however, the shellbacks gained their justice against the \"disloyal and scurvy Pollywogs,\" many of the latter sans hair and sporting red tails.\n\n23-25 Jun 1967: While rounding South America en route to Pacific waters Forrestal anchored at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The air wing presented an air show for distinguished visitors including United States Ambassador John W. Tuthill and Brazilian ADM Rademaker, Minister of that Navy, during the morning watch on 23 June, following which the ship anchored in Guanabara Bay, at 1300.\n\n16 Jul 1967: Detachment Charles, a briefing team which flew out from the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon, boarded to brief the men on the war they entered.\n\n18-21 Jul 1967: At 0530 the ship moored to Leyte Pier at NAS Cubi Point, at Subic Bay, Philippines. The wing examined survival gear and conducted survival training, installed additional electronic countermeasures equipment and made final aircraft modifications before entering battle.\n\n22 Jul 1967: Forrestal sailed from Subic Bay into war. RADM Lanham broke his flag from the carrier in command of Task Group 77.6, which also included destroyers Henry W. Tucker (DD-875) and Rupertus (DD-851). Aircraft practiced night operations, coordinated attacks and honed bombing accuracy while en route to Vietnamese waters.\n\n25 Jul 1967: Forrestal arrived at Yankee Station and at 0600 she launched her first strikes in the Vietnam War against an enemy often just a few miles over the horizon from the ship. The Americans created two carrier operating areas to prosecute the war in Southeast Asia. Initially designating the northernmost one in the Gulf of Tonkin as Point Yankee, they redesignated it Yankee Station as the primary operations area from which carriers operated against North Vietnam. Evolving as the war continued, Yankee Station actually consisted of several stations. In April 1966, the Navy moved it northward to 125 miles east of Dong Hoi at 17º30N, 108º30E, which reduced the distance aircraft had to fly to reach their targets in North Vietnam, but subsequently reassigned it to its original position in 1968. When the Americans resumed intensive bombing against the north in 1972 they again moved the station northward, and designated it as North, Mid and South, at 19º, 17º and 16º N, respectively. The carrier rearmed from ammunition ship Diamond Head (AE-19) later that evening.\n\n25-29 Jul 1967: The North Vietnamese supplied communist forces fighting in South Vietnam through a variety of well-defended and highly secretive routes collectively known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail. To cut these routes pilots flew alpha strikes, reconnaissance, armed reconnaissance and barrier combat air patrol missions against key transportation nodes and supply points supporting the trail, as well as flying radar patrols, from Forrestal as she steamed in the Gulf of Tonkin. Although many of their targets lay within heavily defended areas bristling with North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gunners and surface-to-air missiles, CVW-17 flew more than 150 missions over North Vietnam without losing a single aircraft. Their most significant strike became a massive raid against the Thanh Hoa Bridge Railroad Bypass and Ferry Terminals.\n\n29-30 Jul 1967: Forrestal spent barely five days on the line when tragedy struck on Saturday. SN K. Dyke of 1st Division fell overboard over the starboard side at 0316. The ship immediately stopped and backed-up 1/3, then maneuvered slowly in the area searching for Dyke. At the same time she launched a helo to scour the area, which spotted the man and directed Rupertus to him, which lowered a motor whaleboat to recover the shaken man, the carrier securing from her man overboard orders by 0513. The ship then launched her first strike of the day.\n\nShortly thereafter during the morning watch Forrestal swung her bow into the wind and the crew prepared to launch their second strike as the ship steamed 050° at 27 knots about 150 miles off the North Vietnamese coast, at approximately 19°95N, 107°235E, at 1050; she began an early launch of two Douglas KA-3B Skywarrior tankers from Heavy Attack Squadron (VAH)-10 Detachment 59, a Grumman E-2A Hawkeye from VAW-123 and a Grumman EA-1 Tracer. Two of the four aircraft launched when suddenly, Aircraft No. 110, a McDonnell Douglas F-4B Phantom II (BuNo 153061), LCDR James E. Bangert and LT(JG) Lawrence E. McKay from VF-11, accidently fired a Zuni 5-inch rocket that slammed into Aircraft No. 405, an A-4E Skyhawk, further aft on the port side waiting to launch, less than two minutes later. Within five seconds, the fire, fed by a ruptured 400-gallon fuel tank, rapidly enveloped the Skyhawks on either side of the wounded aircraft.\n\nBarely two minutes into the unfolding holocaust the first of many high and low level detonations erupted as the heat started to cook-off bombs, rockets, and 20 millimeter rounds. An explosion shattered the windows of Primary Flight Control, almost bowling CDR David B. Lember over. Rockets and shells shot across the deck, and ejection seats fired into the air. Seven major explosions shook the ship during the first four minutes of the horrific crisis, and some 40,000-gallons of JP-5 jet fuel from aircraft on deck spread the inferno. Huge clouds of black smoke billowed upward, blinding crewmen racing to battle the flames, which engulfed the fantail and spread to below deck on the 01, 02, and 03 levels, touching off ordnance, trapping some men and wreaking havoc with the crew and ship. Survivors attested to bombs that appeared to be growing red from the heat dropping to the flight deck and blasting holes into the ship. More ruptured fuel tanks spewed volatile jet fuel from beneath aircraft onto the deck, feeding the flames. Some of the liquid sloshed down into the hanger deck where it posed a deadly hazard for men stationed there. Huge gusts of fire shot into the air along the flight deck, trapping pilots in their aircraft with no recourse but to escape through the flames or be incinerated in their cockpits.\n\nLCDR Fred D. White, waiting to launch in Aircraft No. 405, leapt out of his Skyhawk. Other men came to his aid but as the first bomb exploded it killed the pilot. LCDR Herbert A. Hope of VA-46 (and operations officer of CVW-17) jumped out of the cockpit of his Skyhawk between explosions, rolled off the flight deck and into a safety net. Making his way down below to the hanger deck, he gallantly took command of a firefighting team. The port quarter of the flight deck where I was he recalled, is no longer there. LCDR John S. McCain III, sitting in Aircraft No. 416 preparing to launch, afterward described the horror:\n\n\"I thought my aircraft exploded he recounted as the first blast ripped through the aircraft assembled on the flight deck. Flames were everywhere.\"\n\nThe young pilot climbed out of his Skyhawk, poised perilously on the A-4C and then leapt through the flames and ran for his life. As he did so the naval aviator saw another pilot jump and roll clear of his aircraft but the flames caught his uniform ablaze. LCDR McCain turned back to help the man when a bomb exploded and knocked him off his feet and backward about 10 feet. He never saw his shipmate again. The son of the famed pioneering admiral in naval aviation, LCDR McCain would survive being shot down and held as a prisoner of war by the North Vietnamese (1967 through 1973); he eventually received the Distinguished Flying Cross, Silver Star and Purple Heart, and went on to a prominent political career.\n\nNearby LT(JG) Lee V. Twyford also ran in to help a couple of men play a hose onto the conflagration as the detonation bowled him over. Climbing to his feet he saw the hose torn and spilling water over the deck, both men struck down saving their ship. Another man stumbled by LT(JG) Twyford. He had no clothes, he had no skin explained the lieutenant. Wounded in his ankle and unable to walk, he crawled below to lend a hand among Sailors and Marines gathering there. A burst of flames which AE3 Bruce Mulligan of VA-106 described as \"a fireball\" hurtled toward the crewman, who hit the deck and barely survived as it roared over him. Looking around he spotted two men rolling over on fire, and several near him began to tear at their uniforms in fear and pain as their fabric ignited. As he prepared to help his friends a second explosion knocked him down, and the sailor found himself literally by himself. Undaunted, the young (22-year-old) petty officer headed for a fire hose when fragments flew into him. Nonetheless, AE3 Mulligan helped a friend wounded in the leg down to Sick Bay , and returned to help battle the blaze. Twice more he made his way below to rest, at one point noting that he felt kinda groggy, but returned to help his fellows. AE3 Mulligan passed out the second time but a friend brought him topside, where he finally collapsed from exhaustion later that evening, trying to sleep on a life preserver he used as a pillow up on the flight deck, though only resting fitfully.\n\nWhen a chief ran from burning Hanger Bay No. 3 to call for five volunteers, 30 men joined him to attack the raging fires. LT James J. Campbell recoiled for a few moments in stunned dismay as burning torches tumbled toward him, until their screams awoke him to the peril of his shipmates enveloped in flames and he leapt into action to help them. Repeated explosions blew some men overboard, and others made the deadly leap from the flight deck high above the cooling waters below to escape the inferno. Within the first minute the crew had two hoses on deck, and with the crash and salvage officer and chief directing their efforts, already began to ply one of the lines to battle down the flames; mute testimony to their determination to save their ship.\n\nNonetheless, the first bomb explosions hurtled fire and molten fragments into the hose teams, shredding skin and cutting down the men, which temporarily drove back the firefighters moving toward the scene on the flight deck and cost the crew precious minutes as their shipmates bravely advanced into the fray to take their places. Sailors resolutely manned firefighting equipment and played water upon live ordnance to chill it while others braved the flames to disarm bombs and missiles or roll them overboard, and others moved aircraft forward and out of danger. Men frantically jettisoned ordnance from the bomb farm located on the ramp outboard of the island, as well as from the hanger bay and on loaded aircraft, as the fire began to move up the starboard side aft through the row of parked North American RA-5C Vigilantes from Reconnaissance Attack Squadron (RVAH)-11.\n\nLT John E. Carpenter of VA-106 escaped from his aircraft only to discover a man lying on the flight deck with severe arterial bleeding. The pilot remained alongside his shipmate applying a tourniquet to staunch the flow of the precious fluid while bombs and rockets exploded around him, until a corpsman arrived and took over his life-saving efforts. Throughout the day the ships medical staff appeared in the midst of fire and smoke to sacrificially assist their comrades. HM2 Paul Streetman, one of 38 corpsmen assigned to the carrier, spent over 11 grueling hours on the mangled flight deck tending to his shipmates. Investigators noted that survivors recalled that ADJ3 James G. Smith seemed to be everywhere: throwing bombs over the side, manning hoses in the hanger bay, carrying the wounded out of the 03 level, and at one point hauling a man so badly burned that no one wanted to touch him to first aid, an action that probably saved the wounded man's life. ABH3 Larry W. Cope of V-1 Division jumped up onto a forklift and completely disregarding his own safety persisted in pushing a Vigilante over the side while flames surrounded him. His shipmates watered him down with a constant stream from a hose while ABH3 Cope persevered through his ordeal. I am most proud CAPT John K. Beling observed of the way the crew reacted.\n\nAt 1117 the ship passed over her 1MC that all men trapped aft by the flames should try to make their way forward via the hanger deck and second deck levels. Beginning at noon the radar systems failed for four crucial minutes, though operators assiduously restored them. SN Milton Parker of S-6 Division fought the fires topside for nine hours, and discovered that the heat of the charred deck literally burned the soles off of his shoes, but commented that \"my feet are okay because I put on some flight deck shoes and went back in.\" Down in Hanger Bay No. 2, SFC Daniel H. Ringer of R Division joined a team that could not open the hanger bay doors and had to first cool them down, finally going through the side. At one point they applied salt water to a bulkhead only to watch in dismay as the water turned to steam from the intense heat. The chief made his way up to the flight deck and gathered some men to cut their way through with torches. He finally grabbed some sleep by 1100 on Sunday, but awoke five hours later to note that fire still re-flashed. The majority of the men were \"all right\" remembered SFC Ringer. \"There was no trouble in getting them to fight the fire. Most of them were eager to help in any way they could.\"\n\nThe heat, however, became unbearable for many men, and without proper protection some suffered frightful burns as fire ignited their uniforms or literally melted material onto their skin. RADM Lanham reached the bridge and gazed down in horror at the carnage below, noting that the firestorm engulfed the aft end of the flight deck and that men fought to halt the inferno from moving forward. A bosun grabbed his arm and pulled him down, mentioning that the Plexiglas would not be safe. \"As I dropped down,\" reflected the admiral, \"another explosion shook the ship. A large piece of shrapnel crashed through the plexiglass where my face was.\"\n\nCDR John R. Dewenter, Commander, CVW-17, proudly noted that most of his men chipped right in and fought alongside Forrestal's crew. LTJG Francis R. Guinan observed: \"No one had better say to me that American youth are lazy. I saw men working today who were not only injured, but thoroughly exhausted and they had to be carried away. They were trying so hard to help, but were actually becoming a burden.\" Different men reacted to the stress in different ways and the fires trapped 13 sailors in compartment 1-217-4-Q port side aft. As they tried to escape via an alternative door blasts and flying objects forced them back within, and some men bravely attempted to rally their shipmates and seek a way out, while others prayed and still others wept or struggled with their fears. The men finally stumbled over aircraft and yellow equipment and escaped from the hatch near the shop on the hanger deck. The smoke became so thick that even with a few flashlights they could not see more then a couple of feet in front of them and some sailors became separated in the confusion.\n\nThe large number of casualties quickly overwhelmed the ship's Sick Bay staff, who worked diligently to treat the ghastly wounds which the disaster inflicted. Meanwhile, the stricken ship signaled her attendant destroyers, Henry W. Tucker and Rupertus, the latter acting as her plane guard, to \"Close to assist at best speed.\" Rupertus raced in and her men valiantly played hoses onto the fire, staunchly keeping close aboard to Forrestal's starboard side, although flames lapped out at them and smoke rapidly enveloped the destroyer.\n\nOther ships and aircraft came to the rescue. Destroyer George K. MacKenzie (DD-836) steamed eight miles away as one of attack aircraft carrier Oriskany's (CVA-34) plane guards when a lookout spotted the smoke, which her historian described as rising up hundreds of feet into the air, from the wounded ship, at about 1100. Oriskany and George K. MacKenzie gathered destroyer Samuel N. Moore (DD-747) and all three ships sped to the scene. George K. MacKenzie recovered three men from the water and took another trio on board from Rupertus' motor whaleboat, before the destroyer took station on Forrestal's starboard quarter. The destroyer's busy crew also directed Samuel N. Moore to pick up a further 11 survivors they spotted in the water.\n\nFor almost an hour and a half George K. MacKenzie's firefighting parties sprayed the carrier with as many hoses as they could bring to bear. Henry W. Tucker retraced Forrestal's route searching for survivors floundering in the water. A Kaman UH-2A Seasprite, ENS Leonard M. Eiland Jr., ADJ3 James O. James Jr., and AN Albert E. Barrows of HC-1 Detachment Golf embarked in Oriskany, but flying as an additional plane guard for Forrestal, picked up five men from the water in the first hour alone, and later flew other men to sick bays of nearby ships. Helos from attack aircraft carriers Bon Homme Richard (CVA-31) and Oriskany and from the Da Nang area of South Vietnam also raced in to help. Firefighters discovered to their horror that they used their available oxygen breathing apparatuses quickly, but helos from the carriers dropped-off additional apparatuses and canisters to enable men to continue the fight.\n\nAntisubmarine warfare support aircraft carrier Intrepid (CVS-11), embarking CVW-10, learned of the fire while en route to Yankee Station from Japanese waters, and she arrived alongside of Forrestal later in the day. Men from Intrepid transferred fog-foam to the smoldering carrier by helos, and sent a medical team over to Oriskany to assist her crew with treating casualties. Explosive ordnance disposal sailors carefully defused unexploded bombs. When LT(JG) Robert P. Cates, the ship's explosive ordnance demolition officer, noted two bombs (a 500 and a 750 pounder) still smoking in the midst of the flight deck, he disregarded the danger, resolutely walked over to them, defused the bombs and worked with other men to jettison them overboard.\n\nThe Sailors and Marines who survived brought the flames under control on the flight deck by 1215, although they continued to clear smoke and to cool hot steel on the 02 and 03 levels until they reported all fires under control by 1342, and finally declared the fire defeated at 0400 the next morning, due to additional flare-ups. Crewmembers searched through smoky or flooded compartments below deck for their fallen friends.\n\nSome 132 officers and men died in the catastrophe, two disappeared (missing, presumed dead), and another 161 suffered injuries. Sixteen ANM-65 1,000, four M-117 750 and eight Mk-82 500 pound bombs ripped seven frightful holes through the armored flight deck, and scorches from the intense heat marked the flight deck, while melted and twisted debris and wreckage choked the area.\n\nTwenty-one aircraft also sustained enough damage from fire, explosions and salt water to be stricken from naval inventory, including: seven Phantom IIs (BuNos 153046, 153054, 153060, 153061, 153066, 153069 and 153912); eleven A-4E Skyhawks (149996, 150064, 150068, 150084, 150115, 150118, 150129, 152018, 152024, 152036 and 152040); and three Vigilantes (148932, 149282 and 149305).\n\nThe crew fought back heroically, however, the men compounded errors due to their lack of intensive firefighting training, and on at least one instance a team beat the fire by laying down a protective covering of foam, only to have a second (well intentioned) team follow them up and wash it away with water, with the flames leaping up almost immediately again and cutting the Sailors off. The Navy circulated the lessons which the men of Forrestal re-learned at such cost throughout the Fleet, and the flight deck film of the flight operations, subsequently entitled Learn Or Burn, became mandatory viewing for fire fighting trainees for years.\n\nAlthough investigators could not identify the exact chain of events behind the carnage, they revealed potential maintenance issues including concerns in circuitry (stray voltage) associated with LAU-10 rocket launchers and Zunis, as well as the age of the 1,000 pound fat bombs loaded for the strike, shards from one of which dated it originally to the Korean War in 1953. The fire also revealed that Forrestal required a heavy duty, armored forklift to jettison aircraft more efficiently, particularly heavier types such as Vigilantes. Investigators did, however, absolve LCDR Bangert and LT(JG) McKay of any errors and noted their exemplary service prior to the catastrophe. Henry W. Tucker escorted Forrestal to rendezvous with hospital ship Repose (AH-16) at 2054, allowing the crew to begin transferring their dead and wounded shipmates at 2253. Shortly thereafter destroyer Bausell (DD-845) also reached the carrier to help.\n\nCaption: Crew members played hoses onto the fires on the flight deck as explosions erupted around them, in the Gulf of Tonkin, on 29 July 1967. The conflagration began as sailors prepared heavily-armed and fueled aircraft to launch for their second major strike of the day against the North Vietnamese. Navy Photograph No. 1124794.\n\n30 Jul 1967: “I don’t apologize for my inability to talk to you quite clearly” explained LCDR Geoffrey E. Gaugham, a Benedictine chaplain who held mass on board Forrestal in a cluttered hanger at noon. “I was self-contained about this tragedy until I heard confessions this morning. Your emotions became my emotions. We must pray for the dead amongst us, and pray also that we deserve to have lived.” Crewmembers finished transferring their stricken comrades over to Repose at 0220, which allowed the hospital ship to detach at 1410, however, the carrier continued to suffer several brief flash fires, though without casualties. Meanwhile, Intrepid served as host ship for media representatives and VIPs flown out to the scene during the day.\n\n31 Jul–11 Aug 1967: During murky skies laden with monsoon rains Forrestal somberly moored at Subic Bay on the evening of the 31st to make emergency repairs, however, a minor blaze erupted briefly during her navigation and sea and anchor details. As the crew manned the rails and edged the carrier closer in toward Leyte Pier, a fire broke out among a pile of still smoldering mattresses. Some men stepped away from their stations to respond and quickly extinguished the fire without casualties, though with little of the urgency they displayed during the previous disaster. “They’re probably immune to it by now” mused an officer standing on the pier concerning the reactions of the weary crew, as the fire alarm announcement over the 1MC became clearly audible to people waiting ashore. The damage from the main fire proved to be beyond the means of the facilities there to repair, and the ship continued on to the United States to heal from her wounds. Meanwhile, Henry W. Tucker faithfully shepherded Forrestal to the area and then detached to escort attack aircraft carrier Constellation (CVA-64) toward Vietnamese waters, and Intrepid relieved Forrestal’s place on the line at Yankee Station. Skywarriors from VAH-10 Detachment 59 flew back to NAS Whidbey Island in Washington for immediate redeployment, and Grumman A-6A Intruders from VA-65 transferred to VA-196 embarking Constellation. About 450 relatives and friends of men on board Forrestal attended an inter-faith memorial service at the Chapel of the Good Shepherd at NAS Oceana, on 3 August. As the people left the chapel 16 jets from CVW-17 flew overhead to honor their fallen shipmates. The Navy later dedicated its Farrier Fire Fighting School Learning Site at Norfolk for ABC Gerald W. Farrier, who made the ultimate sacrifice for his fellow crewmembers that terrible day. As the fire erupted the chief grabbed a CO2 bottle and courageously rushed past stunned crewmembers toward the burning aircraft, but the initial explosions killed him instantly.\n\nCaption: The cost: sailors carefully lowered the first of their shipmates killed in the fire of 29 July 1967, when they moored at Leyte Pier at NAS Cubi Point in the Philippines. Navy Photo by PHC William M. Powers.\n\n12-13 Sep 1967: Forrestal returned to the United States when she sailed up the St. John's River and arrived at NS Mayport at 1830. The ship unloaded aircraft and the crews of squadrons based in Florida, before continuing on at 1300 the next day for Virginian waters. CAPT Beling ordered speed increased to an average of 27 knots to enable the carrier to reach home and loved ones as planned.\n\n14 Sep 1967: As the ship hove into sight during the afternoon watch over 3,000 family members and friends gathered on Pier 12 and on board Randolph, Forrestal's host ship, burst into frenzied cheering to welcome home their loved ones to Norfolk following the tragic deployment.\n\n19 Sep 1967-8 Apr 1968: Forrestal completed extensive repairs at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. She entered Drydock No. 8 (21 September 1967-10 February 1968). While in the yard the crew manned their battle stations for general quarters drills every other Friday morning, and over 1,000 men attended the five-day dual firefighting and damage control course at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard , Pennsylvania . The ship floated from drydock and shifted to Berths 42 and 43 in front of the drydock to complete repairs.\n\n8-15 Apr 1968: CAPT Robert B. Baldwin sailed the carrier down the Elizabeth River and out into the waters off the Virginia capes for her post repair trials, the ships first time at sea in 207 days. RADM John D. Bulkeley, President of the Board of Inspection and Survey, and his staff inspected the ship for any discrepancies or concerns requiring additional repairs. While accomplishing trials the ship also recorded her first arrested landing since the fire when CDR Robert E. Ferguson, Commander, CVW-17, trapped on board.\n\n23 Apr-22 May 1968: Forrestal completed refresher training in Caribbean waters. The ship loaded and unloaded her wing at Mayport en route on both voyages, and the crew also went ashore for liberty at Montego Bay in Jamaica.\n\n11-27 Jun 1968: The carrier completed a variety of training exercises and pre-deployment work-ups off Jacksonville, Fla. Although the Navy originally scheduled her training through 5 July, the ship suffered problems with a steam turbine, which forced her to terminate her training before scheduled.\n\n1-20 Jul 1968: Forrestal repaired the turbine at Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n27 Jul 1968: Forrestal relieved Shangri-La and commenced operations in the Med, her first return to that sea in three years since the summer of 1965.\n\n17 Aug 1968: LT Robert P. Eicher of VA-34 completed the ships 130,000th trap in an A-4C Skyhawk one day out from Marseilles, France, where the ship made a brief stop (9-15 August).\n\n1-3 Oct 1968: Forrestal anchored in Argostoli Bay in Greece for a fleet commander's conference held on board Independence.\n\n20 Nov 1968: VADM David C. Richardson, Commander, Sixth Fleet, and Senator John C. Stennis of Miss., Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, visited the ship.\n\n3 Jan-13 Jan 1969: Following a visit to Cannes, France (23 December 1968-3 January 1969) Forrestal operated in the Ionian Sea, before anchoring at the Grand Harbor of Valletta on Malta. Poor weather and high winds caused a cancellation of boating and only allowed a single day of general visiting for curious Maltese.\n\n17-22 Feb 1969: The ship operated in the Aegean Sea after visiting Istanbul in Turkey (10-17 February).\n\n1-17 Mar 1969: Operations in the Adriatic Sea through the 11th afforded the crew the unique opportunity of visiting Trieste in northeastern Italy (11-17 March).\n\n15-19 Apr 1969: Although the ship experienced several uneventful visits to harbors during this deployment, she encountered her second burst of poor weather while making port at Marseilles, when the boating conditions so much that Forrestal cancelled general public visitation.\n\n22 Apr 1969: Attack aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy (CVA-67) relieved Forrestal during the morning at NS Rota, Spain. At 1900 Forrestal weighed anchor and set sail for home.\n\n29 Apr 1969: Forrestal moored to Pier 12 at Norfolk after an uneventful seven day voyage from the Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar and across the Atlantic, completing a nine-month deployment-her longest to the Mediterranean to date.\n\n5-9 May 1969: Following her return the ship spent several days offloading ammunition.\n\n9 May-1 Aug 1969: Forrestal completed a restricted availability at Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n11 Aug-27 Sep 1969: The ship accomplished a combination of exercises and training evolutions designed to ready her for battle, including refresher training, which took her to Caribbean and western Atlantic waters. Forrestal anchored at Guantanamo Bay on 20 August, and again on 13 September. She also stopped by both times on her way southward and again returning to Pier 12, Norfolk, to load and offload aircraft and their crews from the wing and ammunition at Mayport.\n\n13-17 Oct 1969: The carrier conducted a firepower demonstration for 400 guests of various service colleges. She spent the first two days rehearsing and performed the demonstration on the 16th and 17th.\n\n11-12 Dec 1969: The ship passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and entered the Mediterranean overnight, relieving John F. Kennedy at Pollensa Bay the next morning. Forrestal then proceeded to operate in the western Mediterranean, Tyrrhenian, and Ionian Seas.\n\n10-20 Jan 1970: The carrier visited Marsaxlokk at Malta. Occasional foul winter weather plagued this visit and the crew could only complete two of their four planned days of general visiting for the public, and limiting a third day, due to the dangerous boating conditions.\n\n16 Feb-2 Mar 1970: Forrestal operated in the Ionian Sea (16-23 February) and then again visited Trieste (23 February-2 March). CDR Douglas C. Coleman of RVAH-13 made the 150,000th arresting landing on board Forrestal as she steamed in the Ionian Sea, in a Vigilante on 20 February.\n\n10-19 Mar 1970: Heavy weather again restricted boating conditions for visitors and for liberty parties going ashore, when the ship put into Barcelona, Spain, reducing boating visitation from three days to two.\n\n9-15 Apr 1970: After sailing in the Tyrrhenian and Ionian Seas (2-9 April), Forrestal anchored at Argostoli Bay in Greece. RADM George C. Talley Jr., relieved RADM William H. House as Commander, Carrier Division 4, during a ceremony on board, on 10 April.\n\n20 Apr-1 May 1970: The ship anchored off Valletta and St. Paul's Bay, Malta. Crewmen contributed to a variety of charitable projects to help people whenever they made port, but this particular visit included a hitherto distinctive event. Some men from the carrier displayed their love of romance when they provided the funds and help to hold a wedding celebration, cake, band, and a dowry of $380.00 collected from their shipmates, for the marriage of two Maltese at an orphanage at Gozo.\n\n1-23 May 1970: Following her Maltese call the carrier steamed in the Ionian Sea, broken by a call at the Greek capital of Athens (7-18 May). Chief of Naval Operations (Designate) VADM Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., visited the ship to observe flight operations overnight on 22 and 23 May. During his stay the affable admiral also answered questions from the crew and sailors from WFOR-TV, the ships television station, interviewed the prospective and outspoken CNO.\n\n23-27 May 1970: Forrestal anchored at Argostoli Bay. Unfortunately, the ship did not hold liberty call for her disappointed crew.\n\n28 May-4 Jun 1970: The ship put into Corfu.\n\n4-21 Jun 1970: After steaming in the Ionian Sea for Operation Dawn Patrol, a joint NATO readiness exercise to prepare for possible East Bloc attacks in the event of a European war, Forrestal anchored in Souda Bay at Crete (4-9 June). The Sixth Fleet intended Forrestal to visit Naples on 16 June, however, civil strife erupted in Jordan, forcing the ship to curtail her visit and rush to the eastern Mediterranean. The carrier patrolled that area and prepared to provide air support to cover evacuations of Americans from Jordan, but the situation calmed and she came about and made for her abbreviated visit to Naples, on the 21st.\n\n28-29 Jun 1970: Forrestal departed the Mediterranean and conducted an underway turnover with Saratoga the next day.\n\n13 Jul-25 Sep 1970: The ship offloaded her ammunition at Norfolk ammunition anchorage through 17 July; she then moored to Pier 5, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, to complete a restricted availability.\n\n30 Sep 1970: Forrestal hosted the change of command ceremony for Commander in Chief Atlantic Command and Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, when ADM Charles K. Duncan relieved ADM Ephraim P. Holmes, at Pier 12 at NS Norfolk. Secretary of the Navy John H. Chaffee Jr., led the entourage of dignitaries present.\n\n1-9 Oct 1970: The carrier stood out of Norfolk for post repair trials, returning to onload ammunition (5-9 October).\n\n16-30 Oct 1970: Whenever carriers assigned to the Atlantic Fleet completed restricted availabilities at this time, they normally conducted their refresher training and carrier qualifications in Caribbean waters. As an experiment and economy measure, however, Forrestal accomplished her scheduled training and qualifications off the Virginia Capes, broken only be a brief return to Norfolk on 22 October.\n\n30 Nov-7 Dec 1970: While training and working-up, Forrestal witnessed a unique operation when two Air Force pilots, MAJ George Weeks, USAF, an exchange officer assigned to VF-11, and LCOL Clifford Allison, USAF (the radar intercept officer serving from the staff of Commander, Second Fleet) flying with that squadron, landed their F-4B Phantom IIs for what the ship's Command History Report referred to as an \"all-Air Force carrier landing,\" on 5 December.\n\n5-24 Jan 1971: While en route to the Mediterranean, Forrestal onloaded VA-81, VA-83, and RVAH-7, the remaining squadrons of CVW-17, at Mayport on the 7th; she then conducted an operational readiness inspection (13-15 January), and anchored off St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands on the 15th. The carrier then continued onward steaming easterly courses, arriving at NS Rota to relieve Independence on 24 January. Grumman EA-6B Prowlers of Marine Tactical Electronics Warfare Squadron (VMAQ)-2 embarked for this initial phase of the deployment. Forrestal steamed through the Strait of Gibraltar in the Mediterranean that night.\n\n29 Jan-3 Feb 1971: The ship made her first visit to a Mediterranean port during this deployment to the Sixth Fleet when she anchored off Valletta's sea wall. Choppy seas interfered with liberty ashore and visitation by the normally friendly Maltese, however, compelling Forrestal to restrict visitation.\n\n3-8 Feb 1971: While steaming in the Ionian Sea Forrestal received word that Panamanian-flagged ore ship Flamingo lost power and drifted at the mercy of the wind and tide off southern Italy , on 7 February. Sixth Fleet destroyers attempted to take her in tow, however, rough seas prevented them from aiding the stricken ship. Forrestal sent four Sikorsky SH-3D Sea Kings from HS-3 through winds gusting up to 60 knots and over what the ship's Command History Report described as \"extremely heavy seas\" to rescue all 20 crewmembers and passengers from Flamingo. The carrier's crew fed and provided medical attention to the survivors, who they flew on to Naval Air Facility (NAF) Sigonella in Sicily the next day to be transported to reunions with their loved ones.\n\n8-10 Feb 1971: As Forrestal anchored in St. Paul's Bay at Malta, Secretary of the Navy Chaffee and VADM Isaac C. Kidd Jr., Commander, Sixth Fleet, paid the ship a visit. The secretary appeared on Forrestal's WFOR-TV for a question and answer session with the crew and presented medals to the 16 men who participated in the rescue of the people from Flamingo. Secretary Chaffee also gave the crew the exciting news that they could wear civilian clothing while on liberty and to store them on board as a feasibility study for wider circulation. The concept proved so popular amongst sailors that the Sixth Fleet later adopted the policy throughout the Mediterranean. Previously, only officers, chiefs and first class petty officers enjoyed that privilege.\n\n10-22 Feb 1971: The carrier operated in the Ionian Sea, during which she hosted a visit on the 18th by the American ambassador to the Netherlands and the Dutch Foreign Minister Joseph Luns, who later became Secretary General of NATO.\n\n22 Feb-2 Mar 1971: As Forrestal put into Valletta poor weather restricted visiting.\n\n12-17 Mar 1971: The ship steamed in the Aegean Sea. Former West German Air Force Chief of Staff GEN Johannes Steinhoff, newly-elected as the Chairman of NATO Military Committee, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), visited for a carrier orientation (12-13 March).\n\n1-3 Apr 1971: Following a brief visit to Athens, Forrestal transited the Strait of Messina and anchored off Naples to off-load a damaged aircraft, however, rough seas precluded the transfer from the carrier to a barge, so Forrestal stood out of the bay into the Tyrrhenian Sea before she could return the next day as the weather calmed to complete the transfer.\n\n28 Apr-17 May 1971: Forrestal participated in Operation Dawn Patrol, a NATO air and sea exercise involving more than 60 ships and submarines and over 300 aircraft from the American, British, Greek, Italian and Turkish forces. Dawn Patrol took the carrier from the western Mediterranean to the Tyrrhenian Seas and back again as the struggle for supremacy between the \"rival powers\" sea-sawed across the region during the simulated war. A VF-11 Phantom II, LT William G. Pfeiffer and LT(JG) Jake T. Walters, Jr., lost its right main landing gear after bolstering, on 2 May. The crew erected the emergency barricade and LT Pfeiffer landed the Phantom II safely. Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard visited during his tour of American military installations ashore in Europe and ships operating in European waters.\n\n16-22 May 1971: The ship visited Naples. Before Forrestal entered port aircraft performed a flyover as the height of the 20th anniversary celebration of the establishment of Allied Forces South Europe (AFSOUTH).\n\n25-26 May 1971: Following a transit of the Strait of Messina the carrier anchored at Argostoli. ADM Horacio Rivero Jr., Commander-in-Chief South, RADM Pierre N. Charbonnet Jr., Commander, Fleet Air Forces Mediterranean, and RADM George L. Cassell, Deputy Commander, Naval Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe, stayed on board overnight.\n\n11-13 Jun 1971: Following a visit to Corfu (3-11 June) the ship steamed in the Ionian Sea to hold flight operations, during which Belgian MGEN Avi I. Du Monceau, commanding their Tactical Air Force, visited the carrier, on the 12th and 13th.\n\n14 Jun 1971: Forrestal entered the western Mediterranean. Cartoonist Henry K. Ketchum, a chief photographic specialist during World War II who created the cartoon character Half Hitch, a naval counterpart to the Army's Sad Sack, and who went on after the war to develop his more popularly known comic protagonist Dennis the Menace, visited the ship at the behest of ADM Zumwalt to interview sailors concerning changes in their service and lifestyles since 1945.\n\n27-30 Jun 1971: Saratoga relieved Forrestal at Rota, and VMAQ-2 crossdecked over to Saratoga. The ship then immediately sailed for home on the same day. While en route to the United States three days later, RADM Donald D. Engen relieved RADM Talley as Commander, Carrier Division 4. Meanwhile on the same day, Forrestal attempted an evolution she hitherto never before completed when she offloaded most of her ordnance to ammunition ships while still returning from deployment, alleviating the need to spend time at the ammunition anchorage and the back-breaking hours that her men would spend after doing so after completing an exhausting deployment and while needing rest and time with their families.\n\n2 Jul 1971: At about 1300 Forrestal rounded Sewell's Point in Hampton Roads and moored to Pier 12 at Norfolk.\n\n16 Jul 1971-10 Apr 1972: Shortly after noon the ship stood down the channel to offload her remaining ammunition, and then she entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for an overhaul. Forrestal completed work in drydock (28 August-2 December 1971). Among the many projects which the crew and shipyard workers completed while she remained in drydock, they removed the posts for both rudders to check them for wear, the first time that such work was accomplished since the ship commissioned. She then moored to Pier 5 at the yard, where she remained until 10 April, when ongoing international tensions generated by NATO and Warsaw Pact rivalry over the European balance of power forced her to curtail her work two months earlier than originally scheduled to relieve America, herself ordered to relieve John F. Kennedy, which became overdue to return home.\n\n10 Apr-28 Jun 1972: At various times during this period the ship completed her type training and carrier qualification exercises off the Virginia Capes instead of in Cuban waters, because her accelerated deployment precluded the usual refresher training conducted off Guantánamo Bay. RADM Frederick C. Turner relieved RADM William D. Hauser as Commander, Carrier Division 2, during a ceremony on board, on 18 May. During these trials (16-28 June), the ship also celebrated her first operations with Grumman F-14As when two Tomcats (BuNos 158613 and 158614) completed a number of trials on board Forrestal.\n\n10 Jul-18 Aug 1971: A fire broke out on the 03 Level in Flag Country during the early morning hours. The blaze gutted the flag mess and galley, as well as flag living quarters. Peripheral heat and smoke damage extended considerably after and slightly forward of the main fire area. Firemen from Naval Station Norfolk valiantly backed-up crewmembers who rushed to contain and extinguish the blaze, which they finally controlled by about 1500 during the afternoon watch, however, investigators could not penetrate the heat and smoke adequately for almost two days, so heavily did the blaze engulf the area. Although the ship did not report any casualties, investigators later apprehended and charged YNSN Jeffrey Allison, a yeoman assigned to the staff of Commander, Carrier Division 2, for setting the fire, which gutted spaces, destroyed sophisticated CIC electronics equipment and wiring, and inflicted total damages estimated at $7.5 million. Forrestal steamed under her own power to Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs, returning to Pier 12, Norfolk.\n\n29 Sep 1972: Forrestal arrived at Rota during her 10th Mediterranean deployment. Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA)-531, flying F-4B Phantom IIs, relieved VF-74, which transitioned to F-4Js on board Forrestal. The latter squadron deployed with CVW-8 embarking America.\n\n6 Oct 1972: The ship rendezvoused with attack aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt (CVA-42) at Pollensa Bay. Both carriers conducted cross-decking to transfer flag officers and their staffs as Commander, Carrier Division 6 and his staff left Forrestal to embark in Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Commander, Carrier Division 2/Commander, Task Force 60 embarked in Forrestal.\n\n20 Feb 1972: When Forrestal sailed from Istanbul, Turkey, her first visit to that crossroads of the Orient since 1969, she departed without a pair of Marines from VMFA-531, who the Turks detained in Istanbul on charges of possession of drugs. The Turks later returned one of the men to U.S. custody, however, the other man remained in the notorious Turkish prison system.\n\n22 Oct 1972: An Olympic Airways NAMC YS-11 airliner crashed after taking off from Athens International Airport during reduced visibility conditions, off the coast of Voula near Athens. Four SH-3D Sea Kings from HS-3 embarking Forrestal, the only helicopter crews in the immediate area qualified for night rescues, flew to the scene and assisted in the rescue of three crewmembers and 16 passengers, however, 37 people (one crewmember and 36 passengers) died during the crash or by drowning, although the Sea King crews did not locate survivors they recovered one of the bodies. Ironically, throughout this period controversy concerning the homeporting of a Sixth Fleet carrier in Athens manifested itself through adverse publicity by the media, and servicemembers on liberty ashore experienced a number of altercations with Greek taxicab drivers during several visits to Athens, though not during a stop at Thessaloniki. One of the reasons that the situation gradually diffused became the practice by Forrestal crewmembers of renting a civilian nightclub (a closed discothèque) near the fleet landing, which offered Sailors and Marines a reasonable alternative to civilian establishments, of arranging a direct-dial overseas telephone and of improving shore patrol communications system.\n\n8 Nov 1972: ASea King crew from HS-3 conducted an anti-submarine exercise with Italian guided missile escort cruiser Andrea Doria (C-553).\n\n12-19 Nov 1972: Forrestal participated in National Week 14, a multi-national NATO exercise involving the Sixth Fleet and a number of countries bordering the Mediterranean designed to improved tactics in modern naval warfare, assist NATO commands in training for operations, and to find weaknesses in concepts and communications. A post exercise brief and general board meeting on board the carrier at Souda Bay at Crete concluded the exercise, on the 18th and 19th. In addition, two Sea King crews from HS-3 detached from the carrier to fast combat support ship Seattle (AOE-3) to fly experimental anti-submarine missions from a \"non-aviation ship\" during the exercise.\n\n20 Nov 1972: As Forrestal prepared to leave Souda Bay a ground accident interrupted her departure.
