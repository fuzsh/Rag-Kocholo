        "text": "Ok here’s a major stretch BUT lets say there is an Italian Man stein / Guderian etc operating as chief of staff in Italy. They use there influence to outsource key weapons\n\nBuild a smaller but motorized Military. Focused on a Med Tank for like the Pz 4 with a long 75 mm by having less infantry they build 15 Pz divisions – Impressed by German occ of Austria and follow there doctrines\n\nBuy the He airplane as a fighter that was turned down by the Germans for the ME109\n\nBuy the P51 – which was offered for sale to many countries\n\nUpgrade their sub force (it was 75 when the war started but very poorly built) with Dutch snorkel and Japanese torp ( best )\n\nFocus on building 4 carriers vs the battleship fleet\n\nSo:\n\n1940 - Send 7 pz divisions into Egypt – defeat the Brits there as well as a quick win in Sudan\n\nInvade up through Pal and SA as well as Iraq in 40 – 41. AS victories mount the It people support the war more\n\nSubs and Air Power (land based and AC based force Brits from Med)\n\nGerman lack of stress on there forces make them more efficient in Rus invasion\n\nForces needed in Greece and Youg as well as Africa are give to Army Gp North with an extra two corps they cut off Russian army gp north and seize Leningrad ( actually came very close to happening except for undue caution from Manstein (of all people) which allowed for a controlled Russian withdrawal\n\nThen::::::::::::::::::::\n\nI think Italy could have done better, but it was very much dependant on the Fascist system. Mussolini like Hitler wanted lots of light armour to show off. The FIAT factory didn't like foreign competion so improvement was slowed down. Look up www.tankhistory.com. So no more armour or perhaps just a little more, but it would need good networking in the Fascist system.\n\nAircraft - as MarkA. They actually made very good aircraft, they weren't just not up to date at the outbreak of war, but later managed rather well regarding fighter production.\n\nNaval. In the '30ties Italy was regarded as the builder of warships. They actually had a number of CVs laid down, but didn't finish them. Have a look at www.hazegray.org/navhist/carriers/.\n\nIMHO it was more a matter of will and resolve that was needed. The hardware was there or could be produced. Actually the Italians on the eve of invasion of Egypt had a new armour doctrine, but didn't use it. Their deployment and use of forces spell it out.\n\nGremlin said:\n\nThe best Strategy for Italy would have been to stay out of the war, Mussolini does a Franco and stays neutral with a strong Hitler bias\n\nFrance falls, Italy acts to maintain peace in the Med by occuping Corsica and maybe Lebanon/Syria and a strip of Southern France (similar to Stalin and Poland).\n\nThe British have to maintain a presence in the Med (not fully trusting Musso) but the forces in the region are stripped to replace losses in other theatres, Britian is unable to blockade the Reich as supplies still flow through Spain and Italy.\n\nHitler tries to diplomatically secure his Balkan Flank pre-barbarossa and as in OTL ends up invading Yugoslavia - Mussolini gets Trieste (Stalin/Poland again)\n\nItalian volunteers similar to the Azul division (spain) assist in barbarossa, if the allies still win out from this point then Italy may be getting a load of scientists and blueprints from Germany as the third Reich collapses and notable germans attempt to avoid allied incarcaration, factor in an italian industry and society reletivly unsratched by war and the discovery of oil in Libya and things look good for the Italians.\n\nI don't think the British would allow the Italians to act in this fashion. It would be letting Hitler get a neutral springboard into the Middle East to support other Rashid Ali's. As the US reacted when the Japanese occupied French Indochina, the Brits will if Musso enters Vichy areas. On the other hand the job will be a lot easier fighting Itais in Syria rather than French.\n\nThe biggest problem of Italy was their comparably small industrial base. They simple wouldn't have been able to compete with Britain, Germany, France, or Russia, not to mention the US, in terms of military hardware production.\n\nExpanding into the few blank (non-colonized) spots on the map was a possible way out of this - but cost the Italians apparently more than it gave them, at least in the few years up to wwii.\n\nThe Balcans could have given Italy quite a boost - but that effort was a failure too, so the Germans got most of that area.\n\nI suppose the only possibility for Italy to solve her problems would be to have *really* big advances in terms of using ceramics and other modern materials to build amor, composite materials, and the likes. That would be pretty unlikely, but not the first time such \"sudden advances\" happen.\n\nAlso, they'd need a person like Speer rationalising their economy and increasing capacity at astonishing rates.\n\nWith both coming together, I could see the mass production of a tank comparable to the t-34 but technologically slightly superior, the mass production of subs, a line of small carriers allowing Italy to project her power into the Atlantic and Indian Ocean, and so on.\n\nNow comes the lack of a Manstein-, Zhukov-, or Guderian-like General..."
