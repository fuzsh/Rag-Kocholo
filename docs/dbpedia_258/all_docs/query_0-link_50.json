        "text": "Fighters of land, sea and air, Blackshirts of the revolution and of the legions, men and women of Italy, of the empire and of the Kingdom of Albania, listen!\n\nThe hour destined by fate is sounding for us. The hour of irrevocable decision has come. A declaration of war already has been handed to the Ambassadors of Great Britain and France.\n\nWe take the field against the plutocratic and reactionary democracies who always have blocked the march and frequently plotted against the existence of the Italian people.\n\nSeveral decades of recent history may be summarized in these words: Phrases, promises, threats of blackmail, and finally, crowning that ignoble edifice, the League of Nations of fifty-two nations.\n\nOur conscience is absolutely clear.\n\nWith you, the entire world is witness that the Italy of fascism has done everything humanly possible to avoid the tempest that envelops Europe, but all in vain. It would have sufficed to revise treaties to adapt them to changing requirements vital to nations and not consider them untouchable for eternity.\n\nIt would have sufficed not to begin the stupid policy of guarantees, which proved particularly deadly for those who accepted them. It would have sufficed not to reject the proposal of the Fuehrer [Hitler] made last October 6 after the campaign in Poland ended.\n\nNow all that belongs to the past.\n\nIf today we have decided to take the risks and sacrifices of war, it is because the honor, interests, and future firmly impose it since a great people is truly such if it considers its obligations sacred and does not avoid the supreme trails that determine the course of history.\n\nWe are taking up arms, after having solved the problem of our continental frontiers. We want to break the territorial and military chains that confine us in our sea because a country of 45,000,000 souls is not truly free if it has not free access to the ocean.\n\nThis gigantic conflict is only a phase of the logical development of our revolution. It is the conflict of poor, numerous peoples who labor against starvers who ferociously cling to a monopoly of all riches and all gold on earth.\n\nIt is a conflict of fruitful, useful peoples against peoples who are in a decline. It is a conflict between two ages, two ideas.\n\nNow the die is cast and our will has burned our ships behind us.\n\nI solemnly declare that Italy does not intend to drag other peoples bordering on her by sea or land into the conflict.\n\nSwitzerland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, and Egypt, take note of these words of mine. It depends on them and only on them if these words are rigorously confirmed or not.\n\nItalians, in a memorable mass meeting in Berlin, I said that according to the rules of Fascist morals, when one has a friend, one marches with him to the end. This we have done and will continue to do with Germany, her people and her victorious armed forces.\n\nOn this eve of an event of import for centuries, we turn our thoughts to His Majesty, the King and Emperor, who always has understood the thought of the country.\n\nLastly, we salute the new Fuehrer, the chief of great allied Germany.\n\nProletariat, Fascist Italy has arisen for the third time, strong, proud, compact as never before.\n\nThere is only one order. It is categorical and obligatory for every one. It already wings over and enflames hearts from the Alps to the Indian Ocean: Conquer!\n\nAnd we will conquer in order, finally, to give a new world of peace with justice to Italy, to Europe and to the universe.\n\nItalian people, rush to arms and show your tenacity, your courage, your valor."
