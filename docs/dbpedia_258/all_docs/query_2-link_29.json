        "text": "Gaijin Entertainment announces that the Italian Navy will arrive to the military online action game War Thunder very soon. The game will get more than 20 signature Italian warships that served Italy in the 20th century. The testing of the Regia Marina tech tree will begin in a few weeks, with the release of the next major Content Update.\n\nWar Thunder players will get a chance to try a diverse range of warships, starting from small torpedo boats and gunships right up to the Trento heavy cruiser. Though the WW2 era Italian navy had some highly autonomous and seaworthy huge ships capable of projecting force in deep ocean waters, a significant part of the forces were meant to fight quite close to their bases. It’s no surprise that in the end, all the Italian naval victories happened in the Mediterranean sea and were either convoy attack or convoy defence missions. For example, MS class torpedo boats sank the British HMS Manchester cruiser and five other ships during Operation Pedestal near Malta. On another occasion, the Turbine-class Espero destroyer achieved fame when it's crew sacrificed themselves to ensure that the other convoy ships delivered military supplies to Tobruk.\n\nWith the Content Update release, players will get access to the closed beta testing of the Italian Navy (or Regia Marina as it was named during the war) and unlock content by completing daily tasks within the game. Purchasing one of the two available pre order packs will give access to the entire Italian navy research in the tech tree right after the Update is available. One of the packs contains the P 420 Sparviero hydrofoil attack with a 76mm autocannon built at the beginning of 1970’s. The other pack is all about the 1942 version of Geniere destroyer with five 120 mm cannon and two triple torpedo launchers.\n\nThe Content Update will also feature ground, sea and air military vehicles for other countries that will be announced later. Follow the news at the official War Thunder website to get the latest information on this."
