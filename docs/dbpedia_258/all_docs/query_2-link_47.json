        "text": "Post by mnnorthstars on\n\nCurrent Battle 1\n\nBasque Auxiliary Navy Campaign\n\nAfter the rest of the Republican Navy was bottled up east of Gibraltar, the remaining Loyalist forces in northern Spain fell to the command of the autonomous government of the Basques (Vascos in Spanish, Euskadi in their own tongue). The Nationalists launched a concerted effort to bottle up the small navy of armed trawlers and destroyers by mining their home base at Portugalete.\n\nThe Campaign\n\nThe Axis fleet must mine the entire center row of Map 8. They always deploy first, on the right side of the map (the one with islands). Allies deploy second and may deploy in either the first or second row. In this scenario each Destroyer has an extra hull point and if a Ship is damaged it must move at full speed to exit the map from its ship deployment zone. Allied Ships cannot move past the center row but may enter it. Each game ends when one of these occurs:\n\n1. All Ships are damaged.\n\n2. No Ships are able to attack each other because of required movement.\n\n3. All 8 sectors of the center row are mined.\n\nEach game, reset the damage on all Ships that were not sunk. Sunken Ships are removed from Grand Campaign.\n\nAxis Units\n\nOne of these Destroyers: Velasco, Lepanto\n\n(Use Lepanto card)\n\nMines - Drop a mine instead of attacking, once per game\n\nAllied Units\n\nTwo of these trawlers: Gipuzkoa, Bizcaia, Goizeko Izarra, Donostia, Nabarra\n\nGipuzkoa, Bizcaia, or Nabarra\n\nAuxiliary - Cod Fishing Boat\n\nSpeed 1\n\nGunnery 3/2/2\n\nAA 3\n\nArmor 1/4/2\n\nSweep Mines - 3+ die roll to remove a mine instead of attacking\n\nGoizeko Izarra or Donostia\n\nAuxiliary - Cod Fishing Boat\n\nSpeed 1\n\nGunnery 2/1\n\nAA 2\n\nArmor 1/3/1\n\nSweep Mines - 3+ die roll to remove a mine instead of attacking\n\nCheckpoints\n\n1. If the Allies have swept all the mines off the map, the next game, use as many Axis destroyers as you have.\n\n2. If you start a game with 4 or more mines on the map, also bring Axis minelayer Genoveva Fierro and Allied minesweeper Mari-Toya.\n\nGenoveva Fierro\n\nAuxiliary\n\nSpeed 1\n\nGunnery 1/1\n\nAA 2\n\nArmor 2/6/2\n\nMines\n\nLead the Attack 2\n\nMari-Toya\n\nUse M1 card\n\n3. If you start a game with 6 or more mines on the map, also bring Axis heavy cruiser Canarias and an Allied shore battery. The Allies can use any trawlers that have not yet been sunk.\n\nAllied shore battery\n\nUse Atlantikwall - 15 cm card\n\nVictory Conditions\n\nAxis total victory - Lay mines across the entire center row and destroy all Allied ships\n\nAxis victory - Lay mines across the entire center row.\n\nAllied victory - The Axis have not achieved victory conditions after 9 games.\n\nAllied total victory - Sink any combination of two Destroyers or Cruisers.\n\nEffects\n\nThe Nationalists are expected to succeed at neutralizing the Basque Auxiliary Navy in short order.\n\nAxis total victory - All surviving Axis ships from this campaign are available next Civil War game.\n\nAxis victory - All surviving Axis ships from this campaign are available next Civil War game with damage carried over from the last game of this campaign.\n\nAllied victory - Axis ships from this campaign are unavailable next Civil War game.\n\nAllied total victory - All surviving Allied ships from this campaign are available next Civil War game.\n\nPost by mnnorthstars on\n\nCurrent Battle 2\n\nSubmarine Scramble\n\nItalian submarines on loan to the Nationalists are crewed and on their way to Mallorca to rendezvous with the other naval forces there. Can the Republicans pick them off before they can get help?\n\nAxis Forces\n\nPier Capponi\n\nGiovanni da Procida\n\nGoffredo Mameli\n\nTito Speri\n\nSubmarine\n\nSpeed 1\n\nTorpedoes 3/2/1\n\nArmor 3/5/1\n\nAllied Forces\n\nAlsedo\n\nLazarra\n\nShip - Destroyer\n\nSpeed 2\n\nASW 3\n\nArmor 1/5/2\n\nSub Hunter\n\nGame Conditions\n\nRoll for map. Twilight, meaning start in daylight and play night rules starting with turn 4.\n\nSpecial Rules\n\n1. Before starting the game, the Axis player will send a private message to mnnorthstars with the names of the four subs located in markers A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or H.\n\n2. Axis player places first, placing 4 markers in row 11 and 4 in row 9. Allied player places both destroyers out of play to be deployed later.\n\n3. When a destroyer ends the sea movement step in the same sector as a marker, the Axis player reveals the name of the submarine that marker represents or declares that there is no submarine assigned to that marker.\n\n4. If a submarine attacks a destroyer, reveal its name and location when it does.\n\n5. At the end of each turn, the Allied player rolls a die. On a 3 or higher, place one destroyer in row A(dice roll + 5). For example, a roll of 6 on the first turn would put Alsedo in A11 as the last action of turn 1. On a 2 or less, the Allied player may place a destroyer in A2 or do nothing. Do not check for legal placement until the end of the sea movement phase of the next turn.\n\n6. On the first turn of darkness the Axis player automatically wins initiative.\n\n7. In darkness Alsedo and Lazarra cannot use the Sub Hunter ability.\n\nVictory Conditions\n\nAll of these warships are at a premium, so it is possible to have both an Axis victory and an Allied victory. Check for victory at the end of each turn. The game ends when 1 or more of the following occurs.\n\nAxis total victory - Destroy both destroyers without losing any submarines.\n\nAxis victory - Exit 3 submarines off the map past column 1 or destroy a destroyer.\n\nAllied victory - Destroy 2 submarines.\n\nAllied total victory - Destroy 3 submarines.\n\nEffects\n\nAll sunk units are removed from the Grand Campaign.\n\nAxis total victory - Each submarine that destroyed a destroyer gains Destroyer Hunter (from the Ambra card)\n\nAxis victory - Each submarine that successfully avoided a depth charge attack gains Crash Dive (from USS Gudgeon card)\n\nAllied victory - Return all surviving submarines to Italian control.\n\nAllied total victory - Return all surviving submarines to Italian control. Surviving destroyers gain ASW 4.\n\nPost by mnnorthstars on\n\nCurrent Battle 3\n\nRed Sea Pirates 2\n\nAt dawn diligent escorts encounter a group of pirates pouncing on an Ethiopian convoy.\n\nAxis forces\n\nLuigi Cadorna\n\nEspero\n\nFolgore (destroyer)\n\n6 convoy ships (use Jeremiah O’Brien card)\n\nPrize Swag From Red Sea Pirates 1\n\nFrancesco Crispi\n\nQuintino Sella (use Crispi card)\n\nAllied forces\n\nPirate Ship x 5\n\nShip - Auxiliary\n\nSpeed 1\n\nGunnery 2/2/1\n\nAA 3\n\nHull 1/4/2\n\nInactivity - This unit gets -1 on each attack die when making its first Main Gunnery attack of the game.\n\nGame Conditions\n\nRoll 1d6 for map\n\nDaylight\n\nSpecial Rules\n\n1.

Allies set up in ANY sectors that are on a map edge, including the top or bottom of the map.\n\n4. Any Axis ships can exit the map by using a movement point while already on an edge of the map.\n\nVictory Conditions\n\nThe pirates must be dealt with. A premium is placed on preserving Italian lives and goods.\n\nAllied total victory: sink 2 or more Italian ships.\n\nAllied victory: Sink an Italian ship.\n\nAxis victory: Sink all Pirate Ships without suffering any ships sunk.\n\nAxis total victory: Sink all Pirate Ships without suffering any damage.\n\nEffects\n\nAllied total victory: +1 Pirate Ship next game they appear, any destroyer unavailable until 1939 if crippled, or removed from campaign if destroyed\n\nAllied victory: Any destroyer unavailable until 1939 if crippled, or removed from campaign if destroyed\n\nAllied victory: +1 initiative once per game next game where Pirate Ship appears - you may declare you are using this ability after the dice are rolled\n\nAllied total victory: Sella and Crispi added to next Pirate Ship game\n\nPost by mnnorthstars on\n\nCurrent Battle 4\n\nJavan Pirates 2\n\nDutch gunboat Flores encounters a group of pirates chasing a convoy over the horizon.\n\nAxis forces\n\nPirate Ship x 4\n\nShip - Auxiliary\n\nSpeed 1\n\nGunnery 2/2/1\n\nAA 3\n\nHull 1/4/2\n\nInactivity - This unit gets -1 on each attack die when making its first Main Gunnery attack of the game.\n\nAllied forces\n\nHr.

Allies set up last in row 11.\n\nVictory Conditions\n\nThe pirates must be dealt with. A premium is placed on preserving Flores for further patrols.\n\nAxis total victory: Cripple or sink Flores and have 2 or more ships exit the map by moving off of row 1.\n\nAxis victory: Cripple or sink Flores or exit all 3 ships\n\nAllied victory: Cripple or sink all Pirate Ships currently on the map without suffering any damage.\n\nAllied total victory: Sink all Pirate Ships without suffering any damage.\n\nEffects\n\nAxis total victory: +1 Pirate Ship next game they appear, Flores unavailable until 1939 if crippled, or removed from campaign if destroyed\n\nAxis victory: Flores unavailable until 1939 if crippled, or removed from campaign if destroyed\n\nAllied victory: +1 initiative once per game next game where Pirate Ship appears - you may declare you are using this ability after the dice are rolled\n\nAllied total victory: End of Dutch Pirates campaign\n\nPost by mnnorthstars on\n\nIndian Ocean Pirates 1\n\nAt dusk diligent escorts encounter a group of pirates pouncing on a homeward bound Indian convoy.\n\nAxis forces\n\nPirate Ship x 3\n\nShip - Auxiliary\n\nSpeed 1\n\nGunnery 2/2/1\n\nAA 3\n\nHull 1/4/2\n\nInactivity - This unit gets -1 on each attack die when making its first Main Gunnery attack of the game.\n\nAllied forces\n\nHMS Boadicea\n\n6 convoy ships (use Jeremiah O’Brien card)\n\nGame Conditions\n\nRoll 1d6 for map\n\nDusk - the first 3 turns are daylight and after that it is night.

Any Allied ships can exit the map by using a movement point while already on an edge of the map.\n\nVictory Conditions\n\nThe pirates are a nuisance, but it’s better to limp away licking our wounds than to leave the convoy unguarded against future threats.\n\nIf Boadicea sinks, the convoy probably can’t get home.\n\nAllied total victory: Sink all the Pirate Ships without losing any of your ships.\n\nAllied victory: Exit all of your ships off the map.\n\nAxis victory: Cripple HMS Boadicea and sink 2 transports.\n\nAxis total victory: Sink HMS Boadicea.\n\nEffects\n\nAllied total victory: HMS Boadicea added to next Pirate Ship game\n\nAllied victory: +1 initiative once per game next game where Pirate Ship appears - you may declare you are using this ability after the dice are rolled\n\nAxis victory: HMS Boadicea unavailable until 1939\n\nAxis total victory: +1 Pirate Ship next game they appear, HMS Boadicea unavailable until 1939 if crippled, or removed from campaign if destroyed"
