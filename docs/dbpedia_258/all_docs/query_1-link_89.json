This document provides an overview of the Italian navy and its doctrine between World Wars I and II. It discusses the debates around naval strategy after WWI and how Italy emphasized smaller, faster ships like destroyers and submarines to operate in the Mediterranean against larger fleets. It also outlines the Italian order of battle and ship classes as it built up its fleet in response to France and later prepared for war against Britain in 1940. Several early naval engagements between Italy and the Allies in the Mediterranean are briefly described.",
