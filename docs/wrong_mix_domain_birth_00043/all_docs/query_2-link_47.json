In his twenty years as Cable News Network’s (CNN) principal Washington anchor, he has taken a serious approach to journalism and has been widely regarded for his belief that the messenger should not get in the way of the message. Before joining CNN, Shaw worked for two of the three national television networks, CBS and ABC. In a career spanning three decades, he has covered some of modern history’s most dramatic events: Watergate, the 1978 Jonestown mass suicide, the Nicaraguan Revolution, China’s Tiananmen Square student massacre, and American involvement in the Persian Gulf War. Widely regarded as the nation’s most powerful black television journalist, Shaw, retired from CNN in 2001 in order to pursue his interest in writing.\n\nShaw grew up during the years of World War II, the emergence of television, and the days that begat the baby boom. His father was a house painter, his mother cleaned other people’s homes, and they lived on the South Side of Chicago. But far from being isolated in the “wrong” part of town and at the wrong end of the economic spectrum, the family brought the world into their home. “In those days,” Shaw told Parade Magazine, “Chicago had four papers and we got all four every day.” Even in his teens, Shaw had an obsessive interest in the news. “My ritual on Sunday morning was to walk to a place called the Green Door bookstore near the University of Chicago, which was the closest place I could find the Sunday New York Times,” Shaw told New York magazine. Fourteen years old, paper cradled in his arms, the boy would plant himself in a coffee shop and read the paper all the way through.\n\nBut Shaw was not merely a spectator. He made announcements on:he school public address system, participated in radio amateur hours, and, while some teenagers of the 1950s may have been totally absorbed in the birth of rock ’n roll, Shaw found time to dial up newspaper and broctdcast reporters and pepper them with questions about story preparation and deadline pressures. Even in his youth, Shaw’s tastes in television programming ran toward the news and information genre: he used to watch the television news program Meet the Press religiously, and his hero was legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow. At 16, he personally witnessed his second Democratic convention—he had\n\nAt a Glance…\n\nBorn May 22, 1940, in Chicago, IL; son of Edgar (a railroad man and house painter) and Camilia (a housekeeper) Shaw; married Linda Allston, 1973; children: Amar Edgar, Anil Louise. Education: University of Illinois, 1963-66. Military Service: U.S. Marine Corps, 1959-63.\n\nCareer: Reporter, correspondent, and news anchor.

Shaw told Time: “When I looked up at the anchor booths, I knew I was looking at the altar.”\n\nMet Journalistic Idol\n\nOn the road to the “altar,” Shaw wangled another opportunity to speak to a journalist about his craft. It was 1961, the beginning of an era of political tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Union. Shaw was a 21-year-old corporal in the Marines stationed in Hawaii at the time, and Walter Cronkite, his other hero, was passing through. With the tenacity of youth—or perhaps that of a budding reporter—the corporal rang Cronkite’s room a total of 34 times. “He was the most persistent guy I’ve ever met in my life,” Cronkite said in the Washington Post, “I was going to give him five begrudging minutes and ended up talking to him for a half hour. He was just determined to be a journalist.” The two have been friends ever since.\n\nIn 1963, with four years of the marines behind him, and a new sense of maturity, Shaw entered the University of Illinois, choosing history as his major. His career in journalism officially began just a year later when he joined Chicago’s WNUS, one of the nation’s first all-news radio stations. He worked there as a reporter and anchor until 1966 when Westinghouse Broadcasting Company’s Group W offered him a job. He quit school, relocated to Washington, D.C, and, at 28, became a White House correspondent. In the five years with Westinghouse Shaw’s assignments included local and national urban affairs, and the struggles of Hispanics and Native Americans.\n\nIn 1971, Walter Cronkite helped Shaw land a job with CBS. Shaw started as a reporter for the CBS News Washington bureau and in three years became a correspondent. It was during this period that his career got a boost: he conducted an exclusive interview with then-attorney general John Mitchell. It was the height of the Watergate crisis and Mitchell, who was to be convicted for his role in the affair, was a major figure in the scandal. White House correspondent Shaw had pulled off a journalistic coup.\n\nHungry for International Experience\n\nAfter nearly ten years of reporting from Capitol Hill, Shaw was restless. He was hungry for international experience. When ABC offered him the job of Miami bureau chief and Latin American correspondent, an impressive but less visible position, he grabbed it. “I pushed myself out the door,” Shaw told the New York Times.The three years he spent with ABC proved especially eventful.\n\nBack at the bureau Shaw told a colleague that he felt very lucky to have gotten the Jonestown story, adding, as quoted in the Washington Post, “You always have luck when you hustle.” And, as if to confirm this philosophy, ABC chose Shaw to file special reports during the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis at the American embassy in Teheran. That led to Shaw’s return to Washington as ABC’s senior Capitol Hill correspondent.\n\n1979 was a tumultuous year for personnel at ABC News. As a result, Shaw’s colleague, Washington bureau chief George Watson, left to help start CNN, a 24-hour, all-news cable network. Watson urged Shaw to follow him as the new network’s principal anchor. “I had been negotiating a new contract with ABC, but I was dissatisfied with the terms, so I started talking to [maverick broadcasting entrepreneur and CNN founder] Ted Turner,” Shaw told New York magazine. “The time period in which I was trying to decide, it seemed like agony to me. I’d only been married three years and our children were very small, and I couldn’t selfishly take that gamble by myself.” His worries were compounded by an economy in recession with double digit inflation. “It’s no exaggeration,” Shaw added, “I walked around the dining room for two weeks, talking to myself. My wife, Linda, would wake up around one in the morning and come downstairs. So, finally we just sat down at the dining room table and she said, ‘Okay, you should take the job, because if you don’t and CNN takes off, I won’t be able to live with you.’” Network bosses told Shaw it would ruin his career, but he disagreed. “I saw it as perhaps the last frontier on television,” he told the New York Times. “The first all-news TV network seemed like revolutionary stuff to me.”\n\n“Chicken Noodle Network”\n\nFor three decades the rule of the Big Three had never been seriously challenged and, while they smugly claimed that no one else could pull together the resources to compete, Turner was telling Business Week, “The Turner broadcasting group is going to be the greatest business success story of all time.”\n\nThe so-called “Chicken Noodle Network” began broadcasting from its Atlanta headquarters on June 1, 1980. Using new satellite technology for live transmission, CNN’s staff of three hundred fresh faces drew on ceaseless energy to get the news out as it was happening, at any hour of the day or night. The cable network’s viewership rose and its presence began to be felt. But it wasn’t until 1987 that it achieved a contender’s rank. That status seemed to become official when Shaw’s became the fourth chair—joining those of CBS, NBC, and ABC—in a nationally televised interview with then U.S. president Ronald Reagan, held in the Oval Office on the eve of the summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. That event served to introduce CNN and Shaw to millions of non-cable viewers. Another nationally televised event only a few months later ingrained Shaw’s face and style into viewers’ minds. But not all liked what they saw.\n\nIn April of 1988 Shaw moderated the second presidential debate from Los Angeles. In his role, he seemed rough with the debate audience, warning them that he would tell them to keep quiet “only once.” And, in general, he was his usual serious self. But it was his opening questions to the two candidates that caused a stir. George Bush was asked if he would be worried about the country under President Dan Quayle’s leadership in the event Bush died before inauguration. Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis was asked if he would still be against the death penalty if someone “raped and murdered” his wife Kitty Dukakis. “I’ve heard the questions called ghoulish and tasteless,” Shaw told the Washington Post, “I spent more than a day and a half working on those two questions. They were not asked with trivia in mind.” It’s difficult to accuse Shaw of being trivial. “I hope I didn’t seem severe,” he added, “1 took the job seriously.”\n\nThe next couple of years drew Shaw into international news. He covered the 1988 Reagan-Gorbachev Moscow Summit; Presicent Bush’s first visit to Eastern Europe, and his participation in the 1989 Economic Summit in Paris; Japanese Emperor Hirohito’s funeral; and the 40th-anniversary North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Summit in Brussels. In May of 1989, Shaw received his biggest story yet: he provided 30 hours of continuous live coverage, worldwide, on the historic student demonstrations in Beijing, China. He was one of only two American anchors in Tiananmen Square when the Chinese government’s tanks rolled in and crushed the pro-democracy movement.\n\nFrom “The Center of Hell”\n\nAlthough Shaw initially expressed doubts about the probability of war between the United States and Iraq, four months later he admitted in Gentlemen’s Quarterly that this had been a “prediction grounded in hope.” In January of 1991, he was in Baghdad to interview Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein when history took a turn. On the 16th, just one day after the aborted interview, Shaw found himself stranded—along with CNN colleagues, Peter Arnett and John Holliman—in the enemy capital as the allied bombing attack launched the Gulf War. Shaw was one of the first reporters to announce to the world that the United States and its allies had gone to war, and CNN went on to provide continuous coverage for the conflict’s duration. Even after even; major newspaper had pulled out, after the Big Three’s phone lines were cut, and after CNN lost its picture transmission, the network was able to make live reports rrorn Baghdad via its secure phone line.\n\nWhile the night sky was screaming with gunfire and air-raid warnings, the CNN trio crawled around the floor of their hotel room and delivered some of the most spellbinding audio reporting since Edward R. Murrow’s harrowing World War II accounts of the Nazi bombing of London. “By the time we stopped broadcasting to get some sleep,” Shaw toldParade Magazine, “I was so tired I was making no sense whatsoever. I was no sooner in bed and asleep when the bombing started again, and 1 stumbled down the hall in my pajamas to the suite where we broadcast and went back to work.” The experience unnerved the characteristi cally composed anchor. He announced: “Clearly I’ve never been there, but it feels like we are in the center of hell.”\n\nCNN’s coverage was being cited by top Pentagon officials at press conferences while being eagerly viewed by Iraqi officials. CBS and NBC humbled themselves by asking the cable network’s reporters for interviews. Television coverage of the war belonged to CNN because it provided an uninterrupted flow of raw information. This process empowered the public: the viewer became the news editor. “We’ve been training for this story 24 hours a day for ten years,” CNN’s executive vice-president Ed Turner (no relation to Ted Turner) told the Chicago Tribune.Live wartime coverage from the center of enemy camp is unprecedented.\n\nA Star Is Born\n\n“Bernie” Shaw came back to the U.S. a star. But the kudos and popular attention seemed unprofessional and embarrassing to him. He was happy to be reunited with his family and had more private thoughts on his mind. “I came back from Baghdad a changed man,” he told theLos Angeles Times. “I looked death in the eyes. No human gets many chances to do that twice.”\n\nThe journey from the South Side of Chicago to Baghdad was a long one, but Shaw never wavered, and that could have been easy in the beginning. The 1950s had no “black Murrows” as role models for a poor, young black boy with dreams of broadcast journalism. “But I didn’t see Ed Murrow as white,” Shaw told the New York Times, “I saw him as a journalist.” Shaw knew that it was certainly possible that he’d encounter racism along the way, but he has said that he has never been a knowing victim of it in his career.\n\nAlthough he has never experienced racism in his career, Shaw raised the issue of racial profiling at the vice-presidential debate. As moderator of the second presidential debate in 1988, Shaw had asked the candidates to imagine a situation and then explain how they would respond. Using this same tactic, Shaw asked vice-presidential hopefuls Joseph Lieberman and Dick Cheney to imagine themselves as victims of racial profiling. Whereas in 1988, Shaw was criticized for asking Michael Dukakis if he would reverse his position on the death penalty if his own wife was a victim of a brutal crime, in 2000 Shaw managed to bring an issue that, only a few years before very few had even heard of, into the national consciousness.\n\nAs CNN’s top anchor, Shaw stood at the helm of television’s news phenomenon: a 24-hour, all-news cable network. In his twenty years at CNN, he saw the network evolve from a long-shot endeavor known as the “Chicken Noodle Network” to become the top-ranked televison news network. But, in November of 2000, Shaw announced to viewers that he was resigning from CNN, saying that, while he hoped to return for the occasional special assignment, he wanted to spend more time with his family. He also planned to focus much of his time on writing fiction, essays, and a primer on journalism. He decided his first writing project, however, would be his autobiography, for, as he told Broadcasting & Cable, “If I don’t do it now, I’ll never get it done.”\n\nIn many ways, Shaw’s departure heralded the end of an era at CNN. A rogue network no longer, talks for an AOL-Time Warner merger began. With a new management team on board, the network also launched plans to experiment with new types of programming. With his final newscast on February 28, 2001, Shaw left the anchor seat he had worked so hard to earn. He told Jet, “Harder than entering this business is leaving it.”\n\nSources\n\nPeriodicals\n\nBusiness Week, June 1980.\n\nBusiness Wire, February 12, 2001.\n\nChicago Tribune, January 20, 1991.\n\nEssence, November 1990.\n\nGentlemen’s Quarterly, May 1991.\n\nJet, November 27, 2000.\n\nLos Angeles Times, April 11, 1991.\n\nNational Review, February 19, 2001.\n\nNew York, February 1991.\n\nNew York Times, February 2, 1988; March 20, 1988.\n\nParade Magazine, June 23, 1991.\n\nSi.Louis Dispatch, March 2, 2001.\n\nTime, February 22, 1988.\n\nVariety, November 13, 2000.\n\nWashington Post, June 22, 1991.\n\n—Iva Sipal and Jennifer M.

As Cable News Network’s (CNN) principal Washington anchor, he takes a serious approach to journalism and is widely regarded for his belief that the messenger should not get in the way of the message. Shaw has worked for two of the three national television networks, CBS and ABC, and holds the number one anchor position at a number one ranked TV news network—the “fourth” network—CNN. In a career spanning three decades, he has covered some of modern history’s most dramatic events: Watergate (a political scandal that centered on the infiltration of Democratic party headquarters by Republicans during the 1972 presidential campaign), the 1978 Jonestown mass suicide, the Nicaraguan Revolution, China’s Tiananmen Square student massacre, and American involvement in the Persian Gulf War. As CNN’s top anchor, Shaw is at the helm of television’s news phenomenon: a 24-hour, all-news cable network that has arisen as a challenge to the three leading networks.\n\nShaw is one of the rare few who has realized his childhood dreams. He grew up during the years of World War II, the emergence of television, and the days that begat the baby boom. His father was a house painter, his mother cleaned other people’s homes, and they lived on the South Side of Chicago.

It was 1961, the beginning of an era of political tensions that resulted in such historic moves as the construction of the Berlin Wall by the East German government and the infamous Cuban Missile Crisis (a period of threatened military confrontation between the U.S. and Soviet governments following the American discovery of Soviet missile sites in Cuba). Shaw was a 21-year-old corporal in the Marines stationed in Hawaii at the time, and Walter Cronkite, his other hero, was passing through.

The three years he spent with ABC proved especially eventful.\n\nAs Latin American correspondent from 1977 to 1979, Shaw covered the 1979 resignation and exile of Nicaragua’s enigmatic president, General Anastasio Somoza, and the months of simmering civil war that enveloped it. The year before, Shaw flew to South America when assigned to investigate rumors of a bizarre massacre in the remote jungles of Guyana. The scene was Jonestown, a religious commune named after its leader, Reverend Jim Jones, and populated by transplanted American families. Shaw was one of the first reporters to file from location, and he scooped the other networks by providing the only aerial photos of the tragedy. The picture that confronted them was sickening: the decomposing bodies of 911 men, women, and children who had died by drinking poisoned punch. The reverend had led the cultists to this mass suicide-execution as a reaction to a U.S. representative’s investigation of alleged mistreatment of the American citizens. Shaw commented in Parade Magazine, “You know how cameramen will shoot 15 minutes of tape just to be sure they get one shot right? Well, at Jonestown, a cameraman could [only] shoot for about six seconds before turning around and retching. That’s how bad it was.”\n\nBack at the bureau Shaw told a colleague that he felt very lucky to have gotten the Jonestown story, adding, as quoted in the Washington Post, “You always have luck when you hustle.” And, as if to confirm this philosophy, ABC chose Shaw to file special reports during the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis at the American embassy in Teheran. That led to Shaw’s return to Washington as ABC’s senior Capitol Hill correspondent.\n\nTaking a Career Gamble\n\n1979 was a tumultuous year for personnel at ABC News.

He covered the 1988 Reagan-Gorbachev Moscow Summit; President Bush’s first visit to Eastern Europe, and his participation in the 1989 Economic Summit in Paris; Japanese Emperor Hirohito’s funeral; and the 40th-anniversary North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Summit in Brussels. In May of 1989, Shaw received his biggest story yet: he provided 30 hours of continuous live coverage, worldwide, on the historic student demonstrations in Beijing, China. He was one of only two American anchors in Tiananmen Square when the Chinese government’s tanks rolled in and crushed the pro-democracy movement.\n\nFrom “The Center of Hell”\n\nAlthough Shaw initially expressed doubts about the probability of war between the United States and Iraq, four months later he admitted in Gentlemen’s Quarterly that this had been a “prediction grounded in hope.” In January of 1991, he was in Baghdad to interview Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein when history took a turn. On the 16th, just one day after the aborted interview, Shaw found himself stranded—along with CNN colleagues, Peter Arnett and John Holliman—in the enemy capital as the allied bombing attack launched the Gulf War. Shaw was one of the first reporters to announce to the world that the United States and its allies had gone to war, and CNN went on to provide continuous coverage for the conflict’s duration. Even after every major newspaper had pulled out, after the Big Three’s phonelines were cut, and after CNN lost its picture transmission, the network was able to make live reports from Baghdad via its secure phoneline. While the night sky was screaming with gunfire and air-raid warnings, the CNN trio crawled around the floor of their hotel room and delivered some of the most spellbinding audio reporting since Edward R. Murrow’s harrowing World War II accounts of the Nazi bombing of London. “By the time we stopped broadcasting to get some sleep,” Shaw told Parade Magazine, “I was so tired I was making no sense whatsoever. I was no sooner in bed and asleep when the bombing started again, and I stumbled down the hall in my pajamas to the suite where we broadcast and went back to work.” The experience unnerved the characteristically composed anchor. He announced: “Clearly I’ve never been there, but it feels like we are in the center of hell.”\n\nCNN’s coverage was being cited by top Pentagon officials at press conferences while being eagerly viewed by Iraqi officials. CBS and NBC humbled themselves by asking the cable network’s reporters for interviews. Television coverage of the war belonged to CNN because it provided an uninterrupted flow of raw information. This process empowered the public: the viewer became the news editor. “We’ve been training for this story 24 hours a day for ten years,” CNN’s executive vice-president Ed Turner (no relation to Ted Turner) told the Chicago Tribune. Live wartime coverage from the center of enemy camp is unprecedented.\n\nA Star Is Born\n\n“Bernie” Shaw came back to the U.S. a star. But the kudos and popular attention seemed unprofessional and embarrassing to him. He was happy to be reunited with his family and had more private thoughts on his mind. “I came back from Baghdad a changed man,” he told the Los Angeles Times. “I looked death in the eyes. No human gets many chances to do that twice.”\n\nThe journey from the South Side of Chicago to Baghdad was a long one, but Shaw never wavered, and that could have been easy in the beginning. The 1950s had no “black Murrows” as role models for a poor, young black boy with dreams of broadcast journalism. “But I didn’t see Ed Murrow as white,” Shaw told the New York Times, “I saw him as a journalist.” Shaw knew that it was certainly possible that he’d encounter racism along the way, but he says he has never been a knowing victim of it in his career.\n\nWidely regarded as the nation’s most powerful black television journalist, Shaw has maintained his professional philosophy: a reporter must never get in the way of a story. As he told Essence magazine, “I never wanted to sit in this chair until I felt in my mind and heart that I had the necessary experience to anchor.”\n\nSources\n\nBusiness Week, June 1980.\n\nChicago Tribune, January 20, 1991.\n\nEssence, November 1990.\n\nGentlemen’s Quarterly, May 1991.\n\nLos Angeles Times, April 11, 1991.\n\nNew York, February 1991.\n\nNew York Times, February 2, 1988; March 20, 1988.\n\nParade Magazine, June 23, 1991.\n\nTime, February 22, 1988.\n\nWashington Post, June 22, 1991.\n\n—Iva Sipal\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw\n\nPersonal\n\nBorn July 26, 1856, in Dublin, Ireland; died November 2, 1950, in Ayot Saint Lawrence, Hertfordshire, England; son of George Carr (an agricultural merchant) and Lucinda Elizabeth (a singer, musician, and music teacher; maiden name, Gurly) Shaw; married Charlotte Francis Payne-Townshend, 1898 (died, September, 1943).

Theatre Works.\n\nSidelights\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw has earned almost universal recognition as the chief English-speaking dramatist of the modern age, second only to William Shakespeare in his contribution to the British theatrical tradition. \"One after another,\" H. W. Nevinson wrote in the New Leader, \"his plays and the prefaces to his plays have laid bare the falsities and hypocrisies and boastful pretensions of our . . . time. I can think of no modern prophet who has swept away so much accepted rubbish and cleared the air of so much cant.\" A great innovator, Shaw invented the theater of ideas, turned the stage into a forum for moral instruction, altered outmoded and unrealistic theatrical conventions, and paved the way for later symbolist drama and the theater of the absurd. As such, he is credited with returning intellect to the theater. As Joseph Knight wrote in Athenaeum in 1907, before Shaw had even written his masterpieces, he \"put new brains into the theatre, and ruthlessly taxed the brains of his audiences. He it is who has shown that it is possible to have an intellectual drama even in England, and an intellectual drama that shall be amusing.\" According to Archibald Henderson in European Dramatists, \"Back of all surface manifestations lies the supreme conviction of Shaw that the theatre of today, properly utilized, is an instrumentality for the molding of character and the shaping of conduct no whit inferior to the Church and the School.\"\n\nBorn on July 26, 1856, in Dublin, Ireland, Shaw was the third and youngest child as well as the only son of George Carr and Lucinda Elizabeth (née Gurly) Shaw. Shaw's childhood was a difficult one: his father was an unsuccessful grain merchant who drank heavily, and his pretentious mother showed him little affection. Shaw attended a succession of schools, but his formal education left much to be desired. At age fifteen he began working as a rent collector for a land agent.\n\nA Zealous Autodidact\n\nLargely self-educated, Shaw read widely, devouring the works of William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, John Bunyan, William Blake, Lord Byron, and Percy Bysshe Shelley. He attended the theater to see French melodramas, Shakespearean comedies and dramas, and the works of the Irish-born playwright Dion Boucicault. Shaw also frequented the National Gallery of Ireland, where he encountered the works of Michelangelo. According to Dictionary of Literary Biography essayist John Greenfield, \"The strongest and most immediate and pervasive influence on him at this time, however, was neither literature nor art but music. His mother made sure that the Shaw household never lacked for music; she and Shaw's two older sisters, Agnes and Lucy, all aspired to be professional singers, and Shaw himself sang and played the piano.\" Shaw's mother eventually moved to London, England, to pursue a career in music. In 1876 Shaw joined his mother in London, determined to pursue his own career in literature.\n\nThe next ten years were lean ones financially for Shaw. He wrote book reviews, drama reviews, and music and art criticism for various magazines, and he produced several unsuccessful novels. He often spent time at the British Museum Reading Room in pursuit of additional self-education, and he plunged himself into the London intellectual scene. Beginning in 1880 Shaw joined various philosophical, literary, and political organizations, including the Zetetical Society, the Dialectical Society, the Shelley Society, and the New Shakespeare Society. In 1882, after hearing a lecture by American economist and reformer Henry George, Shaw converted to socialism. He became a driving force in the Fabian Society, a middle-class socialist group, developing into an effective pamphleteer and public speaker. \"Despite his failure in fiction, the 1880s were the decade in which Shaw found himself,\" wrote Stanley Weintraub in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. \"He became a vegetarian, a socialist, a spellbinding orator, a polemicist, even, tentatively, a playwright.\"\n\nDuring this time Shaw became acquainted with William Archer, a journalist who persuaded his editor to hire Shaw as an art critic. According to Weintraub, \"Shaw had been experimenting in the drama since his early twenties, but not until William Archer in 1884 suggested a collaboration (Archer to\n\nsupply the plot, Shaw the dialogue) did serious work result. Even then the project was abandoned after Shaw used up all the projected plot; but eight years later, in 1892, Shaw completed the play on his own for J. T. Grein's fledgling Independent Theatre Society.\" Widowers' Houses, informed by his experiences as a rent collector, was Shaw's first play to reach the stage.\n\nRecognition as a major force in the theater came slowly for Shaw, partly because he was already a celebrity when Widowers' Houses appeared in 1892. By that time Shaw had developed a public personality as the impudent, iconoclastic, paradoxical, and witty \"G. B. S.\" who combined elements of the clown and the crank in his strident platform utterances and devastating published criticism of art, literature, music, and drama. J. I. M. Stewart wrote in Eight Modern Writers that Shaw \"consistently employed arts of showmanship that are not commonly held becoming in a writer unquestionably eminent.\"\n\nTheatrical Peaks and Valleys\n\nShaw's own career in the theater developed in four phases. In the initial period—from 1892 to 1902—his plays appeared in suburban and matinee performances in England and won wider audiences only through publication. During the second period, running from 1903 to the eve of World War I, Shaw secured a place in the London theater, scoring successes at the Royal Court Theatre and in the commercial West End. The third phase began in 1914 with intense public disapproval of his \"Common Sense about the War\" but took a turn in 1923 with public adulation for Saint Joan and peaked in 1925 with Shaw receiving the Nobel Prize for literature. In the final stage, which extended from 1929 to his death, Shaw became preoccupied with political issues, and he alienated many people with his often controversial views on European dictators.\n\nIn retrospect, the first period of Shaw's dramatic career suggests a surprising reluctance on the part of critics to recognize his genius. His plays had short runs in small cities; only a few were staged in London. Widowers' Houses was performed only twice in London, in 1892. Shaw's next several plays were staged only after difficulties. The Philanderer, a satire, found no producer until 1905, and Mrs. Warren's Profession, addressing the social issues implicit in prostitution, was banned by the Lord Chamberlain, thus limiting it to club performances until the ban was removed late in 1924. In 1897 Shaw's first study in greatness, his playlet on Napoleon called The Man of Destiny, had one performance in the London suburb\n\nof Croydon. Candida, which presents a memorable woman choosing her conventional husband over an admiring young poet for unconventional reasons, also had one 1897 performance in Aberdeen, Scotland, and The Devil's Disciple, an inverted melodrama set in America during the war for independence, had one 1897 performance in Albany, New York.\n\nAlthough Shaw's plays also had a few London performances at the turn of the twentieth century—You Never Can Tell in 1899 and Captain Brassbound's Conversion in 1900—his impact on the stage was almost nonexistent. His importance came when his works appeared in print. When he published Plays: Pleasant and Unpleasant he provided elaborate prefaces raising the significant issues of his plays. He also wrote his stage directions in a narrative form more congenial than the terse notations common to dramatic scripts. As T. F. Evans commented in Shaw: The Critical Heritage, Shaw took great pains with every detail of publication: He \"had much to say to [publisher] Grant Richards on the physical appearance of the books, the type, the binding, the advertisements, the sales policy and the author's royalties.\"\n\nShaw's plays were criticized on several counts. One common charge was that his plays are not really plays at all. Arnold Bennett, writing for Academy, felt that Shaw's works are \"decidedly not drama\" even if they include \"amusing and edifying dialogue.\" Another charge that contemporary critics frequently leveled at Shaw concerns the supposed heartlessness of his approach to life and the ostensibly inhuman nature of his characters. Responding to Arms and the Man, William Archer commented in World: \"To look at nothing but the seamy side may be to see life steadily, but is not to see it whole. As an artist, Mr. Shaw suffers from this limitation; and to this negative fault, if I may call it so, he super-adds a positive vice of style.\" Further, Archer criticized Shaw for his \"peculiar habit of straining all the red corpuscles out of the blood of his personages. They have nothing of human nature except its pettinesses; they are devoid alike of its spiritual and its sensual instincts.\"\n\nDuring the playwright's second phase, some critics expressed greater understanding of Shaw's methods. In 1900, reviewing Captain Brassbound's Conversion for World, Archer ridiculed theater managers' failures to realize that Shaw's plays could be commercially successful in West End theaters. Archer contended that audiences were enjoying Shaw's plays thoroughly despite the disapproval of drama critics. Max Beerbohm, reviewing the published volume Man and Superman for the Saturday Review in 1903, also blamed theater managers for the commercial failure of Shaw's plays. \"It is only the theatrical managers,\" he wrote, \"who stand between him and the off-chance of a real popular success.\"\n\nFinds Commercial Success in London\n\nMan and Superman was an important turning point in Shavian drama, presenting for the first time a coherent statement—in the Don Juan in Hell interlude—of Shaw's ideal of the \"Life Force.\" To the consternation of the author's socialist friends, the play treats Fabianism comically, satirizing socialist movements among the brigands and commenting—specifically in the Revolutionist's Handbook appended to the public version of the play—that Fabianism is one of socialism's failed experiments. In The Bishop of Everywhere, Warren Sylvester Smith declared that the play's \"subject is simple: The Life Force, acting through the will of woman, subdues man to its purpose, and thereby moves the race to its next higher level. That is the subject that gives unity to the play, even though it proves somewhat limiting to its philosophical development.\" Smith agreed with Alfred Turco, Jr., who in Shaw's Moral Vision noted that Man and Superman is the culmination of Shaw's career, \"the first play in which Shaw's belief in the possibility of an effective idealism is presented with real conviction.\"\n\nMore important to Shaw's popular success were the 1904 through 1907 seasons of the Royal Court Theatre, which began its association with the Irish-born playwright with six matinee performances of Candida in April and May of 1904. Responding to the popularity of the matinees, the Royal Court performed John Bull's Other Island in November of 1904, launching Shaw's stage career in England. The play drew large audiences and favorable responses, and it was given a command performance for King Edward VII. Major Barbara, performed in 1905, \"is one of Shaw's most intellectually complex plays,\" noted Weintraub. The work reflects Shaw's concerns about capitalism and poverty, and revolves around the relationship between Barbara Undershaft, a major in the Salvation Army, and her estranged father, Andrew Undershaft, a wealthy munitions manufacturer. In Major Barbara, Weintraub wrote, \"Shaw continued, through the medium of high comedy, to explore the religious consciousness and to point out society's complicity in its own evils.\"\n\nSubsequent performances of Shaw's plays at the Royal Court included Man and Superman, The Doctor's Dilemma, Captain Brassbound's Conversion, The Philanderer, The Man of Destiny, and Don Juan in Hell. Of 988 performances during the years 1904 to 1907 at the Royal Court, 701 were of plays by Shaw. These productions clearly established the viability of Shaw's work in performance and attracted a larger theater-going audience to his plays.\n\nAfter staging several plays of limited appeal, Shaw produced three works that sealed his reputation as a playwright. Fanny's First Play, which began a record run of 622 performances at London's Little Theatre on April 19, 1911; Androcles and the Lion, which premiered in 1913; and Pygmalion, which premiered the next year, completed Shaw's theatrical triumph in the West End. Weintraub called Pygmalion \"a high and humane comedy about love and class, the story of a cockney flower girl trained to pass as a lady, and the repercussions of the experiment's success.\" Pygmalion was filmed in 1938, with Shaw garnering an Academy Award for his screenplay. \"Possibly Shaw's comedic masterpiece, and certainly his funniest and most popular play, it is never absent from the stage somewhere in the world,\" Weintraub added.\n\nBy this time, Shaw had gained recognition as both a new force in drama and as a commercially successful playwright. He also began to find defenders of\n\nhis drama, and many agreed with the assessment of Dixon Scott in Bookman that when \"the limitations of the plays are realized they cease to possess any; once you see that Shaw has done the best he could for us under the circumstances, then his effort is seen in relation to those circumstances and its errors instinctively allowed for. Recognize that a passion for purity, gentleness, truth, justice, and beauty is the force at the base of all his teaching, and you will find his message one of the most tonic of our time.\"\n\nTakes Controversial Political Stance\n\nThe third phase of Shaw's dramatic career—the years 1914 to 1925—saw him fall to the lowest point of his popularity, only to rise again to the height of international fame. When World War I broke out in August of 1914, Shaw turned down several remunerative offers and withdrew to write the pamphlet \"Common Sense about the War,\" later published in 1931's What I Really Wrote about the War. When \"Common Sense about the War\" first appeared in November 1914, it sold more than 75,000 copies and managed to alienate practically everyone with its contention that England must bear its share of responsibility for a war that would be ruinous for all parties. Shaw's stance was so disturbing to super-patriots that he found himself unwanted even at the Dramatists' Club, where he was the most eminent member. The essay proved extremely damaging to Shaw's reputation, destroying a popularity his best efforts had taken more than two decades to establish.\n\nEventually the British government realized the accuracy of Shaw's farsightedness, and by 1917 he was invited to Flanders to report from the front for the Daily Sketch. As T. S. Eliot commented in Dial, \"It might have been predicted that what he said then would not seem so subversive or blasphemous now. The public has accepted Mr. Shaw not by recognizing the intelligence of what he said then, but by forgetting it.\" By the close of World War I in 1918, Shaw had emerged as virtually the only public figure who had seen the folly of the war from its inception, and from his wartime experiences grew his greatest plays. During the war Shaw wrote only a few light pieces, and it became fashionable to represent him as on the wane; John Leslie Palmer actually titled a 1915 Fortnightly Review article \"Mr. Bernard Shaw: An Epitaph.\" Shaw's plays from this period, infrequently staged, lampoon aspects of World War I. The Inca of Perusalem, produced in 1916, spoofs Kaiser Wilhelm; Augustus Does His Bit, staged one year later, satirizes well-meaning but self-important, befuddled bureaucrats whose incompetence undermine the war effort; and O'Flaherty, V. C., which was not performed in London until after the armistice, satirizes the ambiguous role of the Irish in the war by showing that O'Flaherty, winner of the Victoria Cross, dreaded meeting his mother because she thought he was fighting against the English.\n\nStill, Shaw drew what some critics consider his three greatest plays—Heartbreak House, Back to Methuselah, and Saint Joan—from the crucible of his 1914 to 1918 experiences. In Shakes versus Shav, Shaw explicitly identifies Heartbreak House as his \"King Lear.\" Begun during the war and performed in 1920, Heartbreak House examines the prewar spiritual impoverishment that made World War I inevitable. Shaw's most ambitious work, Back to Methuselah, is a five-part cycle that dramatizes the workings of Creative Evolution as a solution to man's propensity for self-slaughter.\n\nA Masterwork and the Nobel Prize\n\nNeither Heartbreak House nor Back to Methuselah received enthusiastic responses. But Saint Joan, which concerns the religious martyr Joan of Arc, restored Shaw to the highest place in public esteem. As Alexander Woolcott commented in the New York Herald, \"for most of those who see Saint Joan this will be their image of her.\" For Stewart, the character of Joan of Arc \"at last\" reveals Shaw's capability to create a real human being. Instead of ending the play with Joan's execution, which would impress upon an audience the inevitability of tragedy, Shaw provides an epilogue that presents Joan ultimately triumphant over the religious and secular forces that combined to oppose her. Despite her canonization, however, Joan is once again vilified, revealing the paradox that humanity fears and even kills its saints and heroes for the very qualities that ennoble them. Such rejection, Shaw suggests, will continue until saintly and heroic qualities become universal among humankind.\n\nWhen Shaw won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1925, he reportedly joked that it was in recognition of his not having written a play for that year. He then refused the prize money, suggesting that it fund an Anglo-Swedish literary foundation, which it ultimately did. After Saint Joan, Shaw wrote no plays for six years. From 1923 to 1928 he worked on The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Capitalism and Socialism, and when he returned to writing plays, he gave most of them a political bent. His 1929 work The Apple Cart, drawing its ideas from The Intelligent Woman's Guide, contrasts the ineptitude of popular leaders with the superiority of a competent aristocrat, thus alienating those who regarded Shaw's elevation of King Magnus as a direct attack on parliamentary government.\n\nIn Too True to Be Good, written in 1932, Shaw takes an absurdist stance in regard to several aspects of the British military presence in other lands, while On the Rocks predicts the collapse of parliamentary democracy in the face of overwhelming economic problems. In Geneva, Shaw presents a ridiculously futile League of Nations trying to control thinly disguised caricatures of Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, and Francisco Franco, suggesting that his sympathy for \"benevolent\" despots lingered until the eve of World War II.\n\nThese apparent rejections of democracy alienated many theatergoers almost as thoroughly as Shaw's misunderstood stance in \"Common Sense\" had alienated the English during World War I. Coupled with the unpopularity of Shaw's political position during this period was the recognition of his waning dramatic powers, although a waning Shaw remained more vital in the theater than many of the younger generations that owed so much to his pioneering efforts. Still, critics who had come to accept and to respect Shaw over the years were disappointed with The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles, written in 1934 and first performed the following year, which applies a \"day of judgment\" solution to the ills of the world by having angels eliminate all those who are worthless. Critics speculate that Shaw was running short of inspiration at this point, as he had after completing Saint Joan. Written in 1938 and 1939, his \"In Good King Charles's Golden Days\"—a fanciful discussion among Charles II, Sir Isaac Newton, George Fox, Nell Gwynn, and others—echoes the aristocratic motifs of The Apple Cart.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and his death in 1950, Shaw seemed to write in the spirit of the comment he included in the preface to the published edition of Buoyant Billions: \"as long as I live I must write.\" He returned to earlier concerns in his grappling for something to convey. Buoyant Billions reworks the themes of the 1936 play The Millionairess, Farfetched Fables takes a post-atomic view of the future, Shakes versus Shav provides a discussion between Shakespearean and Shavian puppets on their relative merits, and Why She Would Not employs the \"born boss\" and duel-of-sex themes that Shaw had used earlier. While these last plays failed to match the success of those great earlier works, at his death Shaw was still considered a premier dramatist.\n\nIf you enjoy the works of George Bernard Shaw\n\nIf you enjoy the works of George Bernard Shaw, you may also want to check out the plays:\n\nHenrik Ibsen, An Enemy of the People, first performed in 1882.\n\nAugust Strindberg, Miss Julie, first performed in 1888.\n\nAnton Chekhov, The Cherry Orchard, first performed in 1904.\n\nAlthough some critics contend that Shaw's acceptance as a major playwright was much more gradual than it should have been, his many contributions to the theater are undeniable. By insisting that the theater provide moral instruction, for instance, he invented the theater of ideas, which ranks as one of his greatest achievements. He also created his own genre—serious farce—by inverting melodramatic conventions and using the techniques of comedy to advance serious views on human conduct, social institutions, and political systems.

Shaw is generally\n\nconsidered the greatest dramatist to write in the English language since William Shakespeare. Following the example of Henrik Ibsen, he succeeded in revolutionizing the English stage, disposing of the romantic conventions and devices of the “well-made” play, and instituting a theater of ideas grounded in realism. During his lifetime, he was equally famous as an iconoclastic and outspoken public figure. Essentially a shy man, Shaw created the public persona of G. B. S.: showman, satirist, pundit, and intellectual jester, who challenged established political and social beliefs.\n\nWorks in Biographical and Historical Context\n\nA Young Socialist Born in Dublin, Ireland, on July 16, 1856, George Bernard Shaw was largely an academic failure in school. Part of his nonacademic training was handled by his mother, a music teacher, and Shaw grew up with an excellent ear and good musical taste. After school, he sought to make something of himself in business, but, in March 1876, gave up on this career and joined his mother and two sisters in London, where they conducted a music school. Shaw spent the next nine years supported by his parents, reading constantly and widely, writing music and drama reviews for newspapers, and occasionally singing for hire at London society parties.\n\nDuring this time Shaw also wrote five novels, some of them reflecting the socialist politics that he had become committed to in London. Immaturity, the first, remained unpublished, and the other four, after a series of rejections from London publishers, appeared in radical periodicals. At the age of twenty-eight, Shaw joined the socialist Fabian Society, and he served on the executive committee for the next twenty-seven years. The Fabian Society was a socialist movement comprised largely of British intellectuals and had the aim of bringing about a socialist state by degrees rather than by revolution, as was advocated by contemporaries such as Russians Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin (the architects of the Russian Revolution of 1917). Fabian Essays (1887), edited by Shaw, emphasized the importance of economics and class structure; for him, economics was “the basis of society.” Shaw's politics also inform Common Sense About the War (1914), a criticism of the British government and its policies during the early part of World War I. The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Capitalism and Socialism (1928), which came much later, supplied a complete summary of his political position and remains a major volume of socialist commentary to this day.\n\nTrue-to-Life Drama and Prodigious Productivity Shaw wrote drama between 1892 and 1947, when he completed Buoyant Billions at the age of ninety-one. In 1893, preoccupied by the current issues of women's rights centered on the suffrage movement (granting women the right to vote), Shaw wrote The Philanderers. He also wrote in 1893 his most famous play, Mrs Warren's Profession, which was not produced until 1902 because of British censorship. It remains a powerful play in the history of literature about the rights of women. Shaw's dramas are opposed to the mechanical comic plots of conventional dramas and also against the nineteenth-century tendency to idealize Shakespeare and drama in general. Like the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, whom he helped to promote in England, Shaw preferred a more true-to-life drama that substituted realism and political engagement for sentimentality and nostalgia.\n\nStarting in 1901, Shaw's political and literary theories propelled him into a remarkable period of productivity. Man and Superman (1901–1903) and Major Barbara (1905) are both “dramas of ideas,” posing challenging questions about poverty and capitalism. Androcles and the Lion (1911) takes on religion, John Bull's Other Island (1904) deals with the political relations between England and Ireland, and Heartbreak House (1913–1916) analyzes the domestic effects of World War I. Sometimes Shaw's plays carry long prefaces that are not directly related to the drama itself, exploring such topics as marriage, parenthood, education, and poverty; these essays form an important part of his ouevre. It was for his drama in particular, though, that Shaw was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1925.\n\nWritten during a timespan that included both World Wars (1914–1918 and 1939–1945) and began the separation of the world into a communist East and a capitalist West, Shaw's plays express a complex range of impulses, ambitions, and beliefs. Reflecting on his life and his work, he explained at seventy:\n\nWhether it be that I was born mad or a little too sane, my kingdom was not of this world: I was at home only in the realm of my imagination, and at ease only with the mighty dead. Therefore I had to become an actor, and create for myself a fantastic personality fit and apt for dealing with men, and adaptable to the various parts I had to play as an author, journalist, orator, politician, committee man, man of the world, and so forth. In all this I succeeded later on only too well.\n\nShaw's death in 1950 in England was a loss not only for literature, but also for the working class for which he had done battle over so many years.\n\nWorks in Literary Context\n\nShaw was in many ways the product of Victorian England, although in other ways he helped to make the transition away from its literature into that of Modernism. The Victorian period, named for the long-reigning Queen Victoria (1837–1901), was a time of great literary creativity that resists easy categorization. Nevertheless, the parts of it that influenced Shaw were its tendencies toward realism, its confident championing of self-reliance and inner strength, its moral earnestness, its advocacy of charity and social reform, and its patriotic British nationalism. The authors who perhaps best embody all of these things would be the novelist Charles Dickens, the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and the critic Matthew Arnold.\n\nNaturalist Ideals Shaw took from Victorianism its moral earnestness and commitment to social reform, but he left behind its nationalism and its confidence that core British values would steer a sure path to a brighter future at home and around the world. Shaw felt that the Victorian version of “realism” was too idealized—it turned a blind eye to controversial issues, it glorified heroes for the wrong things, and it packaged life too neatly into “well-made” stories with predictable structures and sentimental conclusions. Shaw is more in line with the “naturalism” movement which began in late nineteenth-century France, culminating in the novels of Guy de Maupassant (1850–1893) and Émile Zola (1840–1902) and aiming to represent a “slice of life” marked by a detached, objective description of society with careful accuracy of detail and historical background. People who had been neglected in earlier literature, such as housewives, the poor, or criminals, were given priority. Whereas naturalist writers often showed individual freewill to be ineffective against the powerful forces of history, society, or biology, however, Shaw strongly believed that creative adaptability, powered by the strength of human willpower, is the “life force” that ensures our evolution as a species.\n\nEvolution The idea of “evolution” was highly charged in Shaw's day. Charles Darwin had published The Origin of Species in 1859, detailing the evidence for his conclusion that species (including man) evolved from lower-order animals through a process of natural selection and random mutations. The idea that God might not be the sole guiding hand in creation, especially the creation of mankind, scandalized the nineteenth century and still reverberates today. Shaw was an early supporter of Darwinian evolution, applying the ideas to socialism, women's rights, and other reformist political ideas. Literature and other arts, he strongly felt, could play a part in mankind's evolution to a higher state.\n\nSocialist Ideals The other figure that scandalized the late nineteenth century, and whose influence also reverberates today, was Karl Marx (1818–1883). Marx was German, but he developed his socialist theory after observing the lives of factory workers in the north of England. Marx wrote that economics is the engine of history, and the unfairness of a capitalist society—where business owners are motivated to pay workers as little as possible, and workers do not own the products of their own labor—can only be changed by revolution. Marx's ideas were quickly assimilated into literature and literary criticism, and Shaw"
