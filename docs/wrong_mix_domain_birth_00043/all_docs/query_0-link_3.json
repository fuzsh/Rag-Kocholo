        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by the city\n\nWhat are some pros and cons from Camarillo to Thousand Oaks. Camarillo's theater has an Imax where as the Thousand Oaks theater is overall nice. Both downtowns seem to be small with not alot of historic touch. Camarillo has an outlet mall where as Thousand Oaks has a high-end enclosed mall. Camarillo is closer to the beach, but TO is closer to LA. Camarillo wins it for affordability.\n\nI am wondering who wins it for more access to hiking? Which has better dining or what are some differences in dining?\n\nThe Outlet mall in Camarillo is continually growing and the Oaks mall in T.O. is rapidly dying. IMHO the weather is better in Camarillo because it has a little more marine effect in the summers, and seems to get less wind when the Santa Anas are blowing. T.O. is much better for hiking, but it is a short drive from Camarillo to get there. T.O. is more frequently visited by the Calabasas/Malibu set than Camarillo, so you are much more likely to run across celebrities and such...and it also has considerably more Maseratis, Botox and silicone. There really isn't much of a \"downtown\" area in T.O. They are trying to create that effect along T.O. Blvd, but not sure it is working the way they thought it would. The extra taxation for that has upset many in T.O. especially those in the greater Newbury Park area where many don't really think they are getting much benefit from that. There seems to be a much more down-to-earth feeling from the people the more you go West from the \"Westlake Village\" part of T.O. (it is not really Westlake Village, but don't say that to anyone who lives there), to Newbury Park and Dos Vientos. We have always referred to the Conejo Grade as the Great Wall of Ventura County. It really does seem like some kind of divide. OTOH, I know a lot of really great people in East Ventura County and I am not putting it down, there just seems to be that feel. There are more dining options in T.O. and probably higher end shopping options, and it is a bit easier commute to L.A. Camarillo has better Mexican food and is a better commute to the beach or parts North. Different strokes for different folks, but if I had to choose I would prefer Camarillo.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by DKM\n\nSome inaccuracies in this post to clear up. The Oaks Mall isn't \"rapidly\" dying. In fact its filing for a new expansion project. There is no extra taxation for a downtown TO project. Westlake Village was split into two pieces, the bigger 2/3rds was annexed by TO and the other 1/3 incorporated into its own city, but its all the same place to us who live here. I notice no difference in the people from east to west, they are all mostly down to earth and great.\n\nOK, I asked my friend in Newbury Park about the taxation for the Thousand Oaks Boulevard Specific Plan, and he advised it was not considered a tax, but called an impact fee that he had to pay as a homeowner. I know that the Oaks Mall has made many promises about great things in the future, but when I closed my store there in August of 2018, I was the 27th closure there that year. It is under new ownership now, and my understanding is that they are investing to modify it like some if the surviving malls have in other parts of the country (more food, activities, entertainment, less retail). I hope they are successful, T.O. could really use that. It will look very different though, all of the anchor stores there are teetering. That's just life in this age. Now they want me to return because we are boutique. Someone younger with fewer scars can take my place.\n\nI didn't mean to imply anything negative about the people who are farther East in the area, just that there is a very different feel from one area to another, Just look at what is parked in the parking lots, the shoes, purses, etc. I have friends that will go from L.A. to Camarillo, Oxnard or Ventura, but don't like to stop in T.O. because of it. Other people love it because of that. I don't really care, but I was just letting the OP know that it is an issue for some.\n\nAs for Westlake Village, I just found it confusing and a little humorous. I wanted to open a store there. I found a location and was in the process of getting everything lined up with the County, when the owners decided they were going to use the space for something different. I found another location two blocks away, but I had to start the process all over again. The reason was \"This location is in Westlake Village\". The permits, fees, restrictions etc. with L.A. County convinced me quickly to abandon that idea. The Ventura County area of Westlake Village is a community in T.O. just like Newbury Park is. In my book, that certainly gives it a leg up, it just would be less confusing if it had a different name.\n\nI'm never on here for contention, I like to share and I LOVE to hear what others think.\n\n\"The moment we want to believe something, we suddenly see all the arguments for it, and become blind to the arguments against it.\"\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw"
