Biography

George Bernard Shaw was born in Ireland.

George Bernard Shaw is Notable.

George Bernard Shaw (26 July 1856 – 2 November 1950) was an Irish playwright and a co-founder of the London School of Economics. He was the only person to have been awarded both a Nobel Prize in Literature (1925)[1] and an Oscar (1938), for his contributions to literature and for his work on the film Pygmalion, until Bob Dylan received both[2].

Shaw was born in Synge Street, Dublin, on 26 July 1856, the only son and youngest of three children of George Carr Shaw (1814–85), a civil servant, and Lucinda Elizabeth Shaw, (née Gurly; 1830–1913), an aspiring singer and music teacher. He had two sisters, Lucinda Frances (1853–1920), a singer of musical comedy and light opera, and Elinor Agnes (1855–76), who died young of tuberculosis.

In 1898, Shaw married Charlotte Payne-Townshend[3], a fellow Fabian, whom he survived. They settled in Ayot St Lawrence in a house now called Shaw's Corner. The 1939 register shows George and his wife Charlotte living in this house, where George describes himself as an author, journalist and playwright. [4]. Shaw died there, aged 94,[5] from chronic problems exacerbated by injuries he incurred by falling from a ladder.
