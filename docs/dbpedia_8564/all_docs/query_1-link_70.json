        "text": "New Delhi: There are several advantages of featuring in reality show 'Bigg Boss'. Not only does it guarantee you instant celebrity status, it also paves way for lot of work- both on television as well as big screen.\n\nTV actor Santosh Shukla came on 'Bigg Boss 6' as a wild card entry and was voted out within few weeks but the actor has now gained a meaty role in Salman Khan's next film. Singh will play an antagonist in the film which will be directed by Salman's brother, Sohail Khan.\n\nThough Sohail is mum about the casting, sources have stated that the actor has been signed on to play a villain in the film which stars Salman Khan and Tabu. News also has it that Salman Khan had promised him a role right after Santosh was evicted from the show and the superstar kept his promise. Singh is currently undergoing rigorous training in martial arts and has also been asked to lose weight.\n\nSantosh will soon be flying to Dubai where the unit is about to start shooting for the film."
