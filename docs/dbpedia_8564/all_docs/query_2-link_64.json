        "text": "Kanpur: With more than 60 criminal cases registered against him, Vikas Dubey is a history-sheeter, a resident of Bikru village. Wanted in several high profile murder, robbery and kidnapping cases, the gangster Vikas Dubey has an alleged role in the killing of BJP leader Santosh Shukla in Shivli police station in 2001. However, he was acquitted by a session court due to lack of evidence.\n\nAt least eight police personnel, including a Deputy Superintendent, were killed and six cops were injured on the intervening night of June 2 and 3 after they went to arrest Vikas Dubey, one of the state's most notorious and wanted criminals. Sources revealed that Dubey got an inkling of the impending raid. He and his henchmen put up massive roadblocks to prevent the police personnel from proceeding towards their hideout. As the police team was caught unawares, the criminals fired at them from a building rooftop leading to the deaths.\n\nREAD: Family claims gangster Dubey was not home during firing\n\nDubey's criminal record began in 1993 after he formed a gang with scores of youngsters and accumulated charges of attempted murder, abduction, extortion. Having a strong political link, the criminal also kept a private army and he was the most sort out person in rigging the elections. He was even elected as the 'President' of Nagar Panchayat polls when he was lodged in jail.\n\nA founder member of District Panchayat, Dubey was also accused of killing a business tycoon Dinesh Dubey and murder of an assistant manager of Tarachand Intercollege. Vikas Dubey was said to be a close associate of HariKishan Srivastava, who was an MLA from Janata Dal and later Dubey allegedly killed Srivastava's rival Santosh Shukla."
