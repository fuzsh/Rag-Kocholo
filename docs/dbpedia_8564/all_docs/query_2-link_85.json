        "text": "Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya has been in the spotlight recently due to the consecration ceremony of the Ram Mandir. Amidst the festivities, Ayodhya resident Nidhi Shukla has garnered significant attention by securing the eighth rank in the state in the PCS examination.\n\nNotably, Nidhi’s journey to success has been marked by determination and resilience. Although she had previously made it to the written examination, her initial attempt fell short during the interview round. Undeterred by the setback, Nidhi chose to undertake the examination once again, ultimately achieving success.\n\nNidhi Shukla’s story serves as an inspiration, especially for those who find themselves facing challenges and setbacks but choose to persevere and give their dreams a second chance. Her dedication and triumph underscore the importance of resilience in the face of adversity.\n\nNidhi’s educational journey began in Chhattisgarh, where she completed her early education until the 10th grade. Tragically, at the tender age of 15, Nidhi lost her father, Santosh Kumar Shukla, to a heart attack. Following this loss, her mother, Manorama Shukla, became her pillar of support, and the family returned to their hometown, Ayodhya.\n\nAfter completing her 10th standard in Chhattisgarh, Nidhi pursued her education at Anil Saraswati Vidya Mandir in Faizabad, Ayodhya, until the 12th grade. Subsequently, she enrolled in Dr. Ram Manoram Lohia College to obtain a bachelor’s degree in History, Sociology, and English. Nidhi further pursued a postgraduate degree in Sociology from Avadh University.\n\nUpon completing her postgraduate studies, Nidhi embarked on her journey to prepare for the civil services examination. She dedicated her time to preparation in Prayagraj and also spent some time in Delhi, the national capital.\n\nNidhi Shukla comes from a family of achievers, with two elder sisters. One of her sisters Neha Shukla works as a teacher in a government school, while another, Nishi Shukla serves as an office superintendent in Chhattisgarh, following in the professional footsteps of their late father.\n\nNidhi’s success in the UPPSC PCS examination stands as an example of her tenacity, academic prowess, and the support of her family."
