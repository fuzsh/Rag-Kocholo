        "text": "More people are working on vaccines than ever before. When making vaccines normally a lot of time is spent waiting for people to become infected to test the vaccine, waiting for independent agencies to check results, deciding whether to continue an expensive development process or for regulators to approve things.\n\nBasically, waiting for things to happen one after the other, in sequence.\n\nIt's like crossing town during rush hour. You have to wait for the lights, the traffic, and the lorries stuck up a one-way street.\n\nIn developing Covid-19 vaccines, everyone is acting urgently. So it's like crossing the same town when all the traffic lights have been turned green and you've got a police escort. By cutting out all that waiting, you get there much faster but no less safely.\n\nTo make Covid-19 vaccine development faster, people signed up for trials before the vaccines were even ready. Global collaboration has led to simultaneous international testing. Regulators have been checking results on a rolling basis week by week. And money has been made available to start manufacturing before tests are finished, risking money but saving time.\n\nAll steps that can be have been carried out simultaneously.\n\nThe result has been the fastest vaccine development we've ever seen. All without cutting back on testing and safety.\n\nCovid-19 has shown what we can achieve if we all work together, without cutting corners."
