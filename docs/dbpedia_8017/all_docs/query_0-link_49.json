        "text": "Performance breakdown\n\nGovernance of Access\n\nPlaces 1st, scores 4.57\n\nHas an access-to-medicine strategy with measurable objectives, integrated within its overall corporate strategy. Pfizer performs strongly. Its access strategy is integrated within its Purpose Blueprint, which outlines Pfizer's strategic direction, and covers all therapeutic areas in which the company is involved, including rare diseases. The highest responsibility for access lies directly with Pfizer's executive management team with board oversight, namely with the Corporate Governance & Sustainability Committee.\n\nProvides evidence of financial and non-financial access-related incentives at the executive level. Pfizer performs strongly. It incentivises its senior executives and in-country managers to perform on access to medicine with financial and non-financial rewards. The CEO also has access-related incentives linked to the Purpose Blueprint goals, including improving access through partnerships.\n\nPublicly discloses outcomes of its access-to-medicine activities. Pfizer performs strongly in transparency of access activities. It publicly discloses its commitment to global public health, including new commitments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, measurable goals, objectives and targets for improving access to medicine in countries in scope of the Index. It facilitates accountability and transparency by consistently sharing the outcomes of its access-to-medicine activities, including its progress on SDG3-related targets, in a centralised manner within its ESG Report.\n\nPerforms well in responsible promotional practices. Pfizer’s sales agents are not solely incentivised on sales volume targets. The company does not set incentives at the individual level. It has a global policy on interactions with healthcare professionals, but does not publicly disclose information related to transfers of values to healthcare professionals in countries in scope of the Index (e.g. payments for attending events or promotional activities), unless required by law or by local regulations.\n\nHas a robust set of compliance controls to ensure that governance efforts are not undermined by non-compliant or corrupt activities. Pfizer performs strongly, demonstrating evidence of all components looked for by the Index: fraud-specific risk assessment, country risk-based assessment, audits (both internal and external, covering third parties and in all countries where it operates), formal processes to ensure third-party compliance with company standards and a continuous system to monitor activities. No breaches in countries in scope of the Index were publicly found in the period of analysis.\n\nPublicly supports the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health. Pfizer publicly shares support of the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, but expresses reservations on its provisions, namely on the use of compulsory licensing. There is evidence of industry association lobbying on intellectual property (IP) and the usage of TRIPS flexibilities, namely of compulsory licensing, by national governments in some countries in scope of the Index. As a member of the industry association, Pfizer, like all other member companies in scope of the Index, is by default connected to this activity.\n\nProduct Delivery\n\nPlaces 6th, scores 3.61\n\nPublic commitment not to enforce patents in countries in scope. Pfizer publicly pledges not to enforce patents in Least Developed Countries.\n\nPublicly discloses information on patent status. Like most of its peers, Pfizer publicly discloses the patent statuses for small molecules in scope via the Pat-INFORMED database. It discloses the patent status of its entire small molecule portfolio. The information includes filing date, grant number, grant date and jurisdiction.\n\nPerforms above average in terms of sharing intellectual property (IP) assets with third-party researchers. Pfizer engaged in two new IP-sharing agreements with third-party research institutions or drug discovery initiatives established during the current analysis period that meet all inclusion criteria for evaluation. The company does have existing agreements of this nature in place that were established before the current Index cycle and meet all inclusion criteria for evaluation.\n\nUses licensing to enable generic supply. Pfizer has one non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreement in place for one compound (for diseases in scope). Its licence for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®), agreed with 38 sublicensees, encompasses 95 countries, with 93 countries relevant to the Index, including 66 middle income countries.\n\nFiled to register new products in 14 countries in scope on average. Pfizer did not disclose evidence of filing for registration any of its new products in more than half of the top ten high burden countries (for products that could be assessed with available global burden of disease data, which excludes COVID-19). Among new products, its most widely registered is the COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty®), rapidly authorized in 37 countries in scope of the Index. Bevacizumab-bvzr (Zirabev), indicated for colorectal cancer among other cancer types, has been filed in four of the top ten high burden disease countries such as Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Thailand and Ukraine.\n\nHas access strategies for all supranationally procured products in scope for this analysis. Pfizer performs above average in securing access for its products procured supranationally. For the five products assessed in this category, the company demonstrates strategies both in countries eligible for supply from such procurers and in at least one non-eligible country. For example, the company supplied COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty®) in Rwanda via multiple supply pathways, including via the COVAX Facility. This supply supported the local government in achieving their target vaccination rate aligned with local policy recommendations. The price offered is a not-for-profit price and consistent across all supply pathways. In 2021, around 7.4 million doses were supplied in support of the government's vaccination program.\n\nHas access strategies for the majority of healthcare practitioner-administered products in scope of this analysis. Pfizer has average performance in this area. The company provides examples of access strategies which consider affordability in both UMICs and LMICs for the five products assessed, yet falls short at providing examples for LICs. It makes efforts to reach additional patients using pricing strategies considering relevant payers' ability to pay. For example, while Pfizer is negotiating with the national authority in Ghana for the inclusion of the ceftaroline fosamil (Zinforo®) in the National Insurance Scheme, the company has initiated a patient affordability programme in 2021, which offers the product at 50% of the total cost and patients are allowed to complete payment over 60 days. Pfizer provides evidence of how patient reach has been increased through this approach.\n\nHas access strategies for most of its self-administered products in the scope of this analysis. Pfizer performs above average in this area. For four of the five products assessed, the company provides examples of access strategies in countries of all assessed income levels (UMIC, LMIC, LIC), including efforts to reach additional patients using pricing strategies considering relevant payers' ability to pay for the treatments. For example, Pfizer Mexico implemented a pricing strategy for lorlantinib (Lorbrena®) as second line of NSCLC treatment that considers public sector affordability. While in the private market, Pfizer Mexico offers tiered discounts for lorlantinib based on the remaining insurance policy coverage from insurance providers and the ability of patients to pay, receiving first line and subsequent lines of NSCLC treatment. The company provided evidence of patient reach increase for three products in UMIC and LMIC country examples.\n\nAll five manufacturing capacity building initiatives included for analysis meet all Good Practice Standards. Pfizer is a leader. The number of initiatives meeting all inclusion criteria is higher than average and more initiatives meet all Good Practice Standards (GPS) than what is average for this indicator. For example, the company is working with both The Biovac Institute in South Africa as well as Eurofarma in Brazil to transfer technology to manufacture the COVID-19 vaccine for distribution in the African Union and Latin America respectively.\n\nTwo of the five supply chain capacity building initiatives included meet all Good Practice Standards. Pfizer's performance is above average in this area. The number of initiatives meeting all inclusion criteria is higher than average but an average number of initiatives meet all GPS for this indicator. Pfizer has partnered with Zipline, to test and develop an end-to-end distribution solution for COVID-19 vaccines in Ghana in order to safely distribute these to the last mile and reduce waste to expiry. This initiative meets all GPS.\n\nAll five health systems strengthening initiatives included for analysis meet all Good Practice Standards. Pfizer is one of the leaders in this area. The number of initiatives meeting all inclusion criteria is higher than average and more initiatives meet all GPS than what is average for this indicator. For example, the Ghana Sickle Cell Disease Newborn Screening and Comprehensive Care Program seeks to advance the study and treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) across Ghana and, ultimately, other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, by piloting and testing a newborn screening program for SCD including introducing treatment protocols and understanding the willingness and ability of families to enroll in follow-up care.\n\nHas engaged in scaling up four inclusive business models but has not shown evidence of its involvement in piloting any new inclusive business models that meet all inclusion criteria. Pfizer performs average in the use of inclusive business models aimed at meeting the access needs of populations at the base of the income pyramid (including other underserved populations) in LMICs. The Pfizer Foundation supported the development and implementation of a dengue reduction programme through Reach52. Reach52 aims to bring high-quality healthcare to remote and rural areas through data-driven programs that leverage a network of community health workers empowered by Reach52’s digital health platform.\n\nPerforms above average in terms of ensuring continuous supply of medicines in LMICs. Pfizer is involved in technology transfers with third-party manufacturers in LMICs, and has a system in place to work with relevant stakeholders to communicate issues that may affect the supply chain, produces the majority of its active pharmaceutical ingredients in-house, manages a buffer stock of relevant products and is involved in supply chain capacity building initiatives.\n\nHas a policy for reporting substandard and falsified (SF) medicines in countries in scope of the Index. Pfizer has a policy for reporting SF medicines to the relevant national health authorities but does not specify time frames. Instead, Pfizer reports that it follows locally mandated time frames. It does not provide evidence of shortened reporting time frames for cases which only require visual inspection to be confirmed.\n\nDonates in response to expressed need and monitors delivery. Pfizer has public policies and supply processes in place to ensure ad hoc donations are carried out rapidly in response to expressed need, and it monitors the delivery of donations.\n\nPublicly commits to the achievement of elimination, eradication or control goals in one structured donation programme for neglected tropical diseases or malaria. Pfizer publicly commits to contributing to the elimination of trachoma by donating azithromycin (Zithromax®) from 1998 to 2030 in 29 countries in scope of the Index."
