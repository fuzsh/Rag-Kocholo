        "text": "US drugs giant Pfizer has said it will no longer make a profit from selling its patented medicines to 45 of the world's low-income countries.\n\nPfizer said the plan includes 23 patented medicines and vaccines which treat infectious and rare inflammatory diseases and certain cancers.\n\nIt said new medicines and vaccines will also be sold at cost.\n\nThe firm has previously been criticised for making profits from its coronavirus-related vaccines.\n\nMeanwhile, other companies, such as British firm AstraZeneca, US owned Johnson & Johnson chose to price their coronavirus vaccines at cost during the pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic has been lucrative for the company and its revenues last year doubled to $81.3bn (Â£65.1bn). It made almost $26bn (Â£21bn) in revenues in the first three months of this year partly from the coronavirus vaccine it developed with Germany's BioNTech pharmaceutical company and its pill to treat the virus.\n\nIt has faced calls from campaigners to share its drug-making technologies to help countries in the global south to manufacture their own vaccines and treatments.\n\nPfizer said its vaccine and anti-viral treatment for coronavirus would be included in the plan.\n\nThe firm said the move would benefit more than a billion people.\n\n\"We know there are a number of hurdles that countries have to overcome to gain access to our medicines. That is why we have initially selected five pilot countries to identify and come up with operational solutions and then share those learnings with the remaining countries,\" Angela Hwang, group president of the Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group, said.\n\nBill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said he hoped other firms would follow in their steps.\n\n\"We're pleased to be working with Pfizer and we're talking to the entire pharmaceutical industry about these kinds of initiatives,\" Mr Gates said."
