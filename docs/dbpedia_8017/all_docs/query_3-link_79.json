        "text": "2023 was a tough year for the biopharma industry, with several companies downsizing and restructuring their workforces to stay afloat. There are signs of recovery, as mergers and acquisitions picked up across the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry in the latter part of 2023 and have continued their upswing into 2024. Will the job market follow suit?\n\nBioSpace will continue to be your source of news on job cuts and restructuring initiatives throughout 2024. Follow along as we keep you up to date on which companies are tightening their belts and cutting staff.\n\nAugust 15\n\nGalera Therapeutics will reduce its workforce to three employees on Aug. 31 as it moves toward a planned closure, the company announced Wednesday. According to an SEC filing that same day, Galera’s board approved a liquidation and dissolution plan on Aug. 8 and laid off 22 employees—70% of its workforce—on Aug. 9.\n\nIn its announcement, Galera, which focuses on drugs for use in radiotherapy, stated it had stopped all clinical trial activity and development of product candidates as it explored potential strategic alternatives for the business. Now, it will prepare for a stockholder vote on its dissolution plan, expected on or around Oct. 17.\n\nAccording to Galera’s announcement, as of June 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $10.7 million, which it expects will fund operating expenses, including dissolution-related costs, for at least the next 12 months.\n\nAugust 15\n\nLess than two months after Illumina spun off Grail, the company is laying off about 350 employees, it announced on Tuesday. The reduction represents about 25% of its workforce as of June 30, according to an SEC filing.\n\nGrail, which focuses on cancer diagnostics, is also pulling back on planned 2024 hires, according to the filing. A Grail spokesperson told STAT via email that about 150 open roles were eliminated.\n\nThe force reduction is part of a restructuring plan designed to reprioritize resources to focus on the company’s core multicancer early detection business and reduce overall spend as Grail works toward completing registrational studies and its premarket approval application submission for galleri, according to the SEC filing. As a result of its overall cost reductions, Grail expects to extend its existing cash runway from the second half of 2026 into 2028, according to the announcement.\n\nAugust 14\n\nViracta Therapeutics is laying off 23% of its employees, the company announced Wednesday in a press release. The clinical-stage precision oncology company previously noted the layoff in a July 29 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, stating the forced reduction would be complete this month. Viracta did not specify how many employees it was laying off, but a May 9 SEC filing noted the company had 40 full-time employees as of March 31, including 30 in R&D.\n\nAccording to the press release, Viracta has aligned its resources to prioritize its Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) lymphoma program. The company noted it received positive feedback from a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, giving clarity on a potential regulatory path to initial registration of nana-val in patients with relapsed or refractory EBV+ peripheral T cell lymphoma.\n\nAugust 14\n\nOvid Therapeutics has laid off 17 employees, representing 43% of its workforce, according to an Aug. 13 Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The biopharma company noted that it initiated the forced reduction as part of an organizational restructuring that will help it extend its cash runway.\n\nIn an Aug. 13 press release, Ovid, which focuses on rare epilepsies and brain conditions, stated it expects that cash runway to support operations and clinical development well into the first half of 2026.\n\nAccording to the SEC filing, the layoff followed Takeda’s report of Phase 3 topline study results for soticlestat, which Takeda licenses from Ovid.
