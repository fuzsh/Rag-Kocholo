        "text": "In May 2005, Ono entered into a collaborative research agreement with Medarex Inc. (acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS)) a human anti-human PD-1 (programmed cell death-1) monoclonal antibody. The companies have created and developed nivolumab (ONO-4538/BMS-936558/MDX-1106) through the research collaboration. In September 2011, in order to accelerate the global development of Opdivo® (nivolumab), Ono and BMS entered into the agreement to grant BMS and expand its territorial rights to develop and commercialize Opdivo® globally, except Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. In July 2014, the companies further expanded their strategic collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize multiple immunotherapies – as single agent and combination regimens – for patients with cancer in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. In September 2014, Ono launched Opdivo® Intravenous Infusion for the treatment of melanoma in Japan, and received additional approvals for several types of cancers,\n\nSimultaneously, with execution of the agreement on nivolumub, Ono entered into the agreement with BMS to jointly develop and commercialize Orencia® (abatacept) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Japan with Bristol-Myers Squibb KK, a Japanese subsidiary of BMS and launched it under the product name of Orencia® for S.C. Injection in August 2013.\n\nIn October 2006, Ono originally entered into a license agreement with Sapphire Therapeutics, Inc. (which was acquired by Helsinn Healthcare, S.A. of Switzerland) to exclusively develop and commercialize anamorelin hydrochloride (ONO-7643) in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Anamorelin is an orally active ghrelin receptor agonist. It has shown effects in increasing body weight and muscle mass, as well as appetite in patients with cancer cachexia. In January 2021, Ono received an approval of anamorelin in Japan for the treatment of cancer cachexia in malignant tumors of non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer or colorectal cancer, and launched it under the product name of Adlumiz® tablets in April 2021.\n\nIn September 2010, Ono entered into a license agreement with Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (currently a subsidiary of Amgen) to exclusively develop and commercialize two proteasome inhibitors, carfilzomib (ONO-7057) and oprozomib (ONO-7058) for the treatment of any types of cancers in Japan. Carfilzomib has been launched in the US under the product name of Kyprolis® for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma since July 2012. In Japan, it was approved for the above same indication in July 2016, and launched under the product name of Kyprolis® in August 2016. In addition to the approved twice-weekly therapy in combination with dexamethasone, the additional approval of Kyprolis® once-weekly therapy in combination with dexamethasone was approved in November 2019, leading to a convenience in medication to patients.\n\nIn September 2011, Ono entered into a license agreement with KAI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (acquired by Amgen later), to exclusively develop and commercialize etelcalcetide hydrochloride (ONO-5163), a calcium sensing receptor agonist in Japan, which was under development for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis in the US. The product decreases serum calcium and phosphorus level and reduces risk of cardiovascular disorders including arteriosclerosis, by activating calcium sensing receptor which leads to suppressing excessive PTH secretion from the parathyroid. Amgen received an approval of etelcalcetide for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult hemodialysis patients with chronic kidney disease in EU in November 2016 and in the US in February 2017. In Japan, Ono received an approval of etelcalcetide for the indication of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on hemodialysis in December 2016 and launched it under the product name of Parsabiv® Intravenous Injection for Dialysis in February 2017.\n\nIn September 2011, Ono entered into a license agreement with Les Laboratoires Servier to exclusively develop and commercialize ivabradine hydrochloride (ONO-1162) in Japan. Ivabradine selectively inhibits an HCN channel, one of the ion channels which play the function of pacemaker of heart and to reduce heart rate without affecting systolic function of the heart or blood pressure. It was launched by Servier in the overseas for the treatment of stable angina in January 2006, and was approved for the additional indication of chronic heart failure (CHF) in EU in February 2012, and in the US in April 2015. In September 2019, Ono received an approval of ivabradine in Japan for the treatment of patients with CHF with sinus rhythm and baseline resting heart rate ≥75 beats per minute (limited to patients receiving standard treatment of CHF, including β-blocker), and launched it under the product name of Coralan® Tablets in November 2019.\n\nIn April 2013, Ono entered into a license agreement with BIAL to exclusively develop and commercialize opicapone (ONO-2370), a long acting COMT (Cathechol-O-Methyl Transferase) inhibitor in Japan, which has been discovered and developed by BIAL for the improvement of the end-of-dose motor fluctuations (wearing-off phenomenon) of Parkinson’s disease. Opicapone has shown a long-lasting effect on COMT inhibition in a once daily dosing in clinical studies, and is expected to improve a dosing convenience to patients. In June 2016, BIAL received an approval of opicapone in Europe as adjunct therapy to preparations of levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (DDCis) in patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations who cannot be stabilized on those combinations, and has been marketing it under the product name of Ongentys®. In June 2020, Ono received an approval of opicapone in Japan for the improvement of the end-of-dose motor fluctuations (wearing-off phenomenon) of Parkinson's disease as an adjunctive therapy to levodopa preparations, and launched it under the product name of Ongentys® tablet in August 2020.\n\nIn December 2013, Ono entered into co-promotion agreement with AstraZeneca regarding dapagliflozin, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor. Based on this agreement, Ono is responsible for distribution and marketing of Forxiga® (dapagliflozin) Tablets and has been co-promoting it with AstraZeneca in Japan. Forxiga® is a selective and reversible SGLT-2 inhibitor which inhibits glucose reabsorption from renal uriniferous tubule, and reduces blood glucose by releasing excess glucose in blood to urine. Forxiga® is the first SGLT-2 inhibitor approved in the world for the treatment of type 2 diabetes by working independently of insulin to improve fasting blood glucose and postprandial hyperglycemia. In May 2014, both companies launched it under the product name of Forxiga® Tablets as a once-daily oral treatment of type 2 diabetes. It was also approved for the additional indications of type-1 diabetes in March 2019, chronic heart failure being treated with standard care in November 2020, and chronic kidney disease excluding patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis in August 2021.\n\nIn July 2019, Ono entered into an exclusive license agreement with Forty Seven, Inc. (became a wholly owned subsidiary of Gilead in April 2020) for the development, manufacture and commercialization of magrolimab (ONO-7913), their monoclonal antibody against CD47, in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and ASEAN countries. Magrolimab is a monoclonal antibody against CD47 that is designed to interfere with recognition of CD47 by the SIRPα receptor on macrophages, thus blocking the \"don't eat me\" signal used by cancer cells to avoid being ingested by macrophages. Ono has been conducting Phase 3 study for the treatment of TP53-mutant acute myeloid leukemia, Phase 1 study for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer in Japan. Gilead has been conducting clinical studies for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, etc. overseas.\n\nIn May 2017, Ono entered into a license agreement with Array BioPharma Inc. (became a subsidiary of Pfizer in July 2019) to exclusively develop and commercialize encorafenib (ONO-7702), a BRAF inhibitor and binimetinib (ONO-7703), a MEK inhibitor in Japan and South Korea. Braftovi® (encorafenib) and Mektovi® (binimetinib) suppress the proliferation of tumors by targeting and selectively inhibiting the key enzymes of BRAF and MEK1/MEK2, respectively, which are different kinases of a family of serine/threonine kinases in the MAPK signaling pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) associated with melanoma and various cancers. In Japan, Ono received an approval of both products for the indication of unresectable melanoma with a BRAF mutation in January 2019, and launched Braftovi® and Mektovi® in February 2019. In November 2020, the products were approved for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy, in the triplet combination therapy with cetuximab, an anti-human EGFR monoclonal antibody, and Braftovi® was also approved in the doublet combination therapy with cetuximab for the colorectal cancer indication. In May 2023, Ono submitted supplemental applications for approval of BRAFTOVI® and MEKTOVI® in Japan for the treatment of radically unresectable BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer, in doublet combination therapy with BRAFTOVI® and MEKTOVI®, for a partial change in approved items of the manufacturing and marketing approval.\n\nIn August 2017, Ono entered into a license agreement with Seikagaku Corporation (Seikagaku) to co-develop and exclusively market SI-613 in Japan under the development by Seikagaku for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Seikagaku is an R&D-based pharmaceutical company specializing in glycoscience as an area of specialization. Since its foundation in 1947, Seikagaku has continuously focused on the possibilities of glycoscience and developed original, beneficial pharmaceutical products and medical devices in the fields of orthopedic disorders and ophthalmic diseases. ONO-5704/SI-613 (diclofenac etalhyaluronate sodium) is a formulation in which hyaluronic acid and diclofenac (anti-inflammatory drug) are chemically bound using the Seikagaku’s own proprietary technology. In March 2021, Seikagaku received an approval of the product in Japan for the treatment of Osteoarthritis (knee joint and hip joint), and Ono launched it under the product name of Joyclu ® 30mg intra-articular injection in May 2021.\n\nIn June 2019, Ono entered into a license agreement with Rafael Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the company name was changed to Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in May 2022) to exclusively develop and commercialize devimistat (ONO-7912), a cancer metabolism inhibitor, and other related compounds in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and ASEAN countries. Cornerstone is a company, leading in the growing field of cancer metabolism and engaged in the development of a novel therapeutic drug for patients suffering from hard-to-treat cancers. Devimistat targets enzymes that are involved in cancer cell energy metabolism and are located in the mitochondria of cancer cells.
