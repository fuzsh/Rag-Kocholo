        "text": "Stay up to date! See our latest report based on 2023 sales: Top 20 Pharma and Biopharma Companies 2023.\n\nHeadquarters: New York, NY\n\ntwitter.com/Pfizer\n\nwww.pfizer.com\n\nHeadcount: 83,000\n\nYear Established: 1849\n\nRevenues: $100,330 (+23%)\n\nNet Income: $31,372 (+43)\n\nR&D: $11,428 (+10%)\n\nPfizer revenues soared to a record-breaking $100 billion in 2022 driven by sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Combined these COVID therapeutics raked in $56.7 billion for the year, an increase of $19 billion, or 23%, from the year before. Comirnaty sales were $11.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 9%, and $37.8 billion for the year, up 3%. Paxlovid sales were $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter and $18.9 billion for the year. Sales of these COVID products are expected to decline as much as 60% in 2023.\n\nExcluding the impact of Paxlovid and Comirnaty, revenues increased 2%, reflecting growth in the Prevnar family, Eliquis and the Vyndaqel family, as well as revenue from recently acquired products, Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta. Growth was partially offset by declines in Xeljanz, Chantix/Champix, Sutent, certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech, and Ibrance.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, Pfizer began managing its commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and PC1, the global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients.\n\nLooking beyond COVID, at the beginning of 2022 Pfizer entered a research, development, and commercialization agreement with its COVID vaccine partner BioNTech to develop a potential first mRNA-based vaccine for the prevention of shingles based on BioNTech’s mRNA technology and Pfizer’s antigen technology. Pfizer agreed to pay BioNTech $225 million, including $75 million upfront and an equity investment of $150 million. BioNTech is eligible to receive future regulatory and sales milestone payments of up to $200 million.\n\nOn March 24, 2022, Pfizer announced the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Abrysvo for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age and older. This decision was followed by the FDA’s acceptance of Abrysvo’s Biologics License Application (BLA) under priority review for older adults in November 2022.\n\nAggressive acquisition strategy\n\nAs we moved into 2022, Pfizer kicked off an aggressive acquisition spree when it scooped up Arena Pharmaceuticals for $6.7 billion in December 2021. Arena is a clinical stage biotech developing potential therapies for the treatment of several immuno-inflammatory diseases. Arena’s portfolio includes diverse and promising development-stage therapeutic candidates in gastroenterology, dermatology, and cardiology, including etrasimod, an oral, selective sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator currently in development for a range of immuno-inflammatory diseases including gastrointestinal and dermatological diseases.\n\nIn April 2022, Pfizer inked a deal with Novo Holdings to buy another clinical stage biotech, ReViral, for as much as $525 million. ReViral, based in London, UK, and Research Triangle Park, NC, is focused on antiviral therapeutics that target respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). ReViral’s lead drug, sisunatovir, is an orally administered inhibitor designed to block the fusion of RSV to the host cell, which has been granted Fast-Track designation by the FDA.\n\nIn May 2022 Pfizer unveiled plans to purchase Biohaven Pharmaceuticals for $11.6 billion. Biohaven is the maker of Nurtec ODT (rimegepant), a dual-acting migraine therapy approved for both acute treatment and episodic prevention of migraine in adults. The deal also included rights to zavegepant, which won FDA approval in the U.S. in March 2023 as an intranasal spray for the acute treatment of migraine and is sold under the trade name Zavzpret. The medication is also in development as an oral soft gel for chronic migraine prevention. In addition to these medicines, Pfizer acquired a portfolio of five pre-clinical calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) assets.\n\nIn August 2022, Pfizer gained access to rare hematology expertise and a leading portfolio and pipeline when it acquired Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) for $5.4 billion. GBT is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing treatments for underserved patient communities, starting with sickle cell disease (SCD). GBT’s portfolio and pipeline could add potential combined peak sales of more than $3 billion to Pfizer’s bottom line while allowing it to address a full spectrum of critical needs in this underserved community.\n\nMost recently, in March 2023, Pfizer acquired Seagen, a pioneer in antibody drug conjugate (ADC) technology developing and commercializing cancer medicines, for $43 billion.\n\nSeagen’s portfolio includes four approved medicines that are first- or best-in-class across solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, including three ADCs: Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin), Padcev (enfortumab vedotin), and Tivdak (tisotumab vedotin). The company also commercializes Tukysa (tucatinib).\n\nSeagen expects to generate approximately $2.2 billion of revenue in 2023, representing 12% year-over-year growth, from its four in-line medicines, royalties and collaboration and license agreements. Pfizer anticipates Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in revenues by 2030, depending on clinical trial and regulatory success.\n\nExpanding manufacturing capabilities"
