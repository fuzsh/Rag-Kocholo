Please see COVID-19 vaccines\n\nCOVAX was a historic multilateral effort co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF from 2020 through 2023. During the COVID-19 pandemic, COVAX aimed to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world. COVAX came to a close on 31 December 2023.\n\nRead more\n\nNo one is safe, until everyone is safe\n\nCOVAX was the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator. The ACT Accelerator is a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.\n\nCOVAX was co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi and the World Health Organization (WHO), alongside key delivery partner UNICEF. In the Americas, the PAHO Revolving Fund was the recognized procurement agent for COVAX. It aimed to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world.\n\nWHO had multiple roles within COVAX: It provided normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery.\n\nWHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization developed evidence-based immunization policy recommendations. Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL) / prequalification programmes ensured harmonized review and authorization across member states.\n\nWHO provided global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provided R&D technical coordination.\n\nOn behalf of the COVAX Partners, WHO developed a No-Fault Compensation Program to reduce the financial and liability exposure of the AMC92 and humanitarian agencies operating in the AMC92 and to facilitate access to compensation for eligible injured individuals.\n\nWHO also led, together with UNICEF, the Country Readiness and Delivery workstream, which provided support to countries as they prepared to receive and administer vaccines."
