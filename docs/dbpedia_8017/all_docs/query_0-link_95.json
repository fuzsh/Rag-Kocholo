Unlike healthcare professionals, patient organisations cannot decline the publication of data on their payments.19 As in the US,1 the disclosure reports are dispersed on company websites, so establishing the scope of industry involvement for any patient organisation, let alone the overall pattern, is difficult.\n\nDuring June 2017 to July 2018 we searched online for disclosures of payments to “patient organis(z)ations” or “patient groups” made by companies participating in the ABPI’s Disclosure UK database in 201520(see web supplements 1 and 4)—the database covers payments to healthcare professionals and organisations.21 Overall, we identified 220 disclosure reports covering payments from 2012 to 2016, excluding 27 duplicates (see web supplement 5).\n\nThe number of disclosing companies rose from 30 in 2012 to 54 in 2015, then dropped to 46 in 2016 (web supplement 2). The proportion of ABPI companies (as of January 2018) that disclosed rose from 45% (24/53) in 2012 to 66% (35/53) in 2016. Overall, 66 companies published at least one disclosure report over the five years, but only 21 did it every year; these figures were 43 and 19, respectively, for members of ABPI. A missing report may indicate no payments or a failure to disclose.\n\nWe extracted data to a single database, converting all 5232 identified payments to 2016 pounds (see web supplement 6). After reading the payment descriptions and carrying out additional web searches using recipient names, we excluded four payments that were not made in 2012-16 (worth £10 040 out of a total £61 874 269 (0.02%)) and 656 (worth £4 558 976), that were not made to UK organisations meeting EFPIA’s definition of a patient organisation (box 1; see web supplements 3 and 4). These payments might signify problems in defining patient organisations,2 possibly combined with precautionary over-reporting of payments.\n\nBox 1\n\nPatient organisations are defined as not-for-profit organisations (including the umbrella organisations to which they belong), mainly composed of patients or caregivers that represent and/or support the needs of patients or caregivers\n\nThe challenges we encountered in building our database are similar to earlier concerns about the low transparency of reporting of industry payments by patient organisations.4 5 15 22 23 They also coincide with deficiencies in the transparency of payments to healthcare professionals24 and organisations from Disclosure UK.20 24 25\n\nWe coded the condition areas of 444 out of 508 identified patient organisations (87%) using ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision); the remaining 64 organisations focused on diseases or issues not included in ICD-10. We also coded payment goals based on iterative reading and aggregating of semantically similar payment descriptions. We coded the characteristics of patient organisations using their website data and records held by the Charity Commission for England and Wales, the Scottish Charity Regulator, or the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland. Two researchers conducted the coding, resolving differences through discussion.\n\nLittle and large: trends in industry payments\n\nOverall, industry disclosed 4572 payments worth £57 305 253 during 2012-16. This represented only a sixth of its funding for healthcare professionals and organisations (£340.3m) in 2015 alone.26 Patient organisations, however, seemed increasingly important for drug companies. From 2012 to 2016, the yearly number and value of payments rose ( ). For the 21 companies that disclosed consistently over the five years, the number of payments increased slightly (738 versus 772), but their value was 1.4 times higher (£10 838 391 versus £7 634 493).\n\nTable 1\n\nYear20122013201420152016All yearsValue of payments (£)8 179 4266 974 2589 076 72312 110 65020 964 19657 305 253No of payments80875187399211484572Median (interquartile range) payment34 212 (526 to 10 521)4114 (553 to 10 285)5070 (913 to 12 676)5050 (607 to 13 067)3500 (500 to £10 091)4500 (604 to 1 546)No of drug companies†304047524564¶No of patient organisations‡229231260283277508¶\n\nThe top five payments represented 20% of the total value ( ). The value of the largest payments rose over time, with the share of the top 5% almost doubling from 33% (2014) to 65% (2016). But small payments were most common, with 50% being no larger than roughly £5000 annually. Small payments are potentially important, as findings from the US show that even smaller amounts might affect physicians’ prescribing.27\n\nTable 2\n\nDrug companyPatient organisationValue of payments in 2016 £ (year)Payment descriptionCoding of payment goalTakedaMyeloma UK5 924 160 (2016)“Financial support and provision of investigational product for the conduct of an investigator initiated clinical trial in the Myeloma UK Clinical Trial Network.”ResearchPfizerBreast Cancer Now3 505 563 (2016)“Pfizer began a three year research collaboration with the organisation's Catalyst programme.

Most of the top 10 showed a shared understanding of what constitutes acceptable payment values, with similar interquartile ranges (except for Pfizer and Astellas, representing the low and high extremes) and maximum payments (except for Pfizer, Takeda, and Astellas, which had considerably larger highest payments). As with payments to healthcare professionals, the largest donors were “big pharma” companies.20\n\nTable 3\n\nCompanyValue of payments (£)No of paymentsMedian (interquartile range) payment (£)Largest single payment (£)Pfizer9 580 1929091029 (263 to 6072)3 505 563Takeda6 614 468553000 (1014 to 14 200)5 924 160Novartis5 409 19904477605 (758 to 15 255)157 350AbbVie3 619 53502894040 (655 to 13 466)244 907Lilly3 284 2062582749 (447 to 16 178)269 819Astellas2 928 9788812 741 (2035 to 30 225)1 025 150Sanofi2 593 2142325025 (1034 to 14 324)136 080Bristol-Myers Squibb1 929 6152484943 (849 to 10 521)82 078Celgene1 867 8771335260 (1250 to 15 211111 546MSD1 813 1442533857 (514 to 9311)95 100\n\nWho received funding?\n\nOut of all 508 identified patient organisations, 434 (85%), receiving £53 467 424 (93%), had a clear organisational form. Associations formed the largest proportion of these (173, 40%), followed by foundations or funds (61, 14%), trusts (58, 13%), and forums, groups, and networks (51, 10%). The corresponding funding shares were 35%, 29%, 8%, and 4%.\n\nFurthermore, 444 of the patient organisations (87%), receiving £54 071 418 (94.4%), were registered charities, so they had to follow minimum transparency requirements, including publishing their financial accounts.28 Consistent with the EFPIA’s definition of patient organisations as “mainly composed of patients and/or caregivers,”16 482 organisations (95%), receiving £56 666 334.8 (98.9%), had members (including support groups or online forums) or supporters (including volunteers or friends).\n\nMost funding (£47 466 806, 82.8%) went to 314 multipurpose organisations combining patient support with advocacy, policy involvement, awareness raising, or research. Conversely, the organisations focusing on just one of the two activities highlighted in EFPIA’s definition16—“support” (87 organisations) and “representation,” here understood as “advocacy,” (69)—received just £2 732 019.0 (4.8%) and £5 467 917.0 (9.5%), respectively.\n\nWhat activities got funded?\n\nThe top funding priority was supporting patient organisations’ engagement with outside audiences. Notably, public involvement, including “advocacy, campaigning, and disease awareness,” “communication,” and “policy engagement” attracted £17 860 574 (31.2%) ( ). Similarly, engagement in research totalled £14 085 520 (24.6%), mainly because of two large grants received by Myeloma UK and Breast Cancer Now (see ). By contrast, support for patients attracted £3 381 030 (5.9%) and organisational maintenance and development, £1 613 061 (2.8%).\n\nTable 4\n\nGoal of funding*Value (% of total) of payments (£)No (%) of paymentsMedian (interquartile range) value (£)Research14 085 520 (24.6)142 (3.1)11 689 (5038 to 24 171)Advocacy, campaigning, and disease awareness8 272 590 (14.4)496 (10.8)7724 (2022 to 16 911)Communication—media, meetings, online, publications6 943 396 (12.1)832 (18.2)3042 (658 to 10 100)Education and training5 708 003 (10.0)553 (12.1)5260 (2000 to 12 850)Patient support3 381 030 (5.9)214 (4.7)10 120 (5000 to 17 386)Project or programme funding (no specific goals stated)3 002 251 (5.2)153 (3.3)12 500 (7084 to 24 240)More than one distinct purpose mentioned2 961 151 (5.2)148 (3.2)10 391 (5143 to 24 072)Policy engagement2 644 588 (4.6)211 (4.6)9 469 (4840 to 16 424)Inputting to organisation’s work through corporate membership, partnership, sponsorship, or support2 082 891 (3.6)175 (3.8)10 000 (5260 to 13 677)Organisational maintenance and development, including patient and volunteer engagement1 613 0610 (2.8)169 (3.7)5070 (757 to 15 150)\n\nThis hierarchy of funding goals might indicate that patient organisations have matured organisationally, so outside engagement is the key area of their empowerment.7 An alternative interpretation would focus on the risks associated with the underinvestment of core organisational functions and using patients as “third parties” leveraging industry influence in areas like drug development and approvals,29 health technology assessment,12 and commissioning.11\n\nCommercial drivers?\n\nIn drug discovery, the industry prioritises investing in some conditions over others based on their commercial viability.30 Cancer in particular has a privileged place.31 Our data show a similar pattern: of the 30 condition areas (or their combinations), the top five accumulated £39 423 529 (68.8%), with neoplasms alone attracting 36.4% ( ). The second category—endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases—received 11.3%, and infectious and parasitic diseases 8.0%.\n\nTable 5\n\nCondition areas based on ICD-10 categories *Amount received (£) (% of total) Distribution of payments within condition areasNo of organisationsAmount received (£) by top recipient (%)Top recipientNeoplasms20 857 389 (36.4)1017 430 107 (35.6)Myeloma UKEndocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases6 497 767 (11.3)353 021 311 (46.5)Diabetes UKCertain infectious and parasitic diseases4 585 142 (8.0)601 022 603 (22.3)Hepatitis C TrustDiseases or issues not appearing in ICD-104 322 440 (7.5)64909 014 (21.0)Heart UKDiseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue3 160 790 (5.5)24902 728 (28.6)National Ankylosing Spondylitis SocietyDiseases of the nervous system3 041 549 (5.3)44533 370 (17.5)Multiple Sclerosis Trust Diseases of the circulatory system2 665 043 (4.7)20621 144 (23.3)Atrial Fibrillation Association Diseases of the digestive system; Diseases of the genitourinary system2 307 771 (4.0)32 271 217 (98.4)Bladder and Bowel † Mental and behavioural disorders1 788 939 (3.1)23443 860 (24.8)Alzheimer’s Research UK Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism1 569 617 (2.7)21577 522 (36.8)Haemophilia Society\n\nThe hierarchy of funding within each condition area also reflected the industry’s commercial priorities. In neoplasms, multiple myeloma attracted £7 495 729 (35.9%), followed by breast cancer (19.6%); 26 other types of cancer attracted less than 10% of funding. Diabetes received £3 741 181 (57.6%), the most of any endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic disease. The bulk of funding for certain infectious and parasitic diseases went to HIV (37.4%) and viral hepatitis (23.6%). Importantly, the biggest donors in these condition areas have recently launched several high priced drugs. Key examples include Pfizer (palbociclib for breast cancer32), Takeda (ixazomib for myeloma33), Lilly (dulaglutide for diabetes34), Gilead (emtricitabine/tenofovir for HIV35 and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for hepatitis C36).\n\nAs in the US,4 funding was concentrated on a few patient organisations within each condition area. Crucially, across all 30 condition areas the top recipient accumulated an average share of 65.6% of funding.\n\nClearing the fog\n\nThe emerging picture of industry funding shows that companies might seek to use some patient organisations as “third parties” in reaching other audiences. Without necessarily determining the content of the funded activities, firms could shape the profiles of patient organisations through heavy investment in their external activities. This could then influence the public’s and policy makers’ perceptions, consistent with other industry marketing practices.29 Importantly, both tiers of the industry’s payment strategy have demonstrable effect on clinical “key opinion leaders” (large payments)37 and prescribers (small payments).38\n\nThe concentration of funding on certain types of organisations, activities, and conditions might reinforce inequalities between organisations with different budget sizes,2 advocacy potential,39 or representing conditions ascribed varying levels of “social value.”40 Furthermore, given the weakness of public funding,41 limited industry investment in patient organisations’ internal work, could affect their long term sustainability.\n\nNevertheless, following patterns identified elsewhere, financial relationships between many companies (especially non-big pharma) and patient organisations are sparse.4 15 In any case, answering questions about the extent of industry influence requires examining how open different patient organisations are to accepting funding15 or how much their priorities match those promoted by industry funding.10\n\nBut the picture is not fully clear, given the transparency shortcomings, which are similar to those found in other areas with industry self regulation.42 Tackling them would require an integrated, regularly updated payment database with robust quality assurance policies. The ABPI is not currently considering such a database,43 but it should at least introduce a standardised disclosure template, perhaps modelled on the one used for Disclosure UK.44 A space to report that no payments were made would enable identification of those breaching their disclosure obligations.16 Furthermore, a precise definition of patient organisations would help distinguish them from healthcare organisations, which should be reported separately in Disclosure UK.43\n\nResponding to risks posed by the concentration of industry funding requires structural solutions,45 such as a shared corporate funding pool detached from current commercial objectives or treatment areas or a programme of public grants including, for example, the expansion of the Health and Wellbeing Programme run by the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England, and Public Health England. This would make for a more level playing field for patient organisations that cover currently underfunded condition areas or have weak industry links. Achieving this objective, however, might face barriers related to a long term decline in public funding available to patient groups, which, depending on specific Brexit arrangements, might be further exacerbated by loss of access to EU funding; the increasingly complex institutional environment in which patient organisations operate; and a widening scope of patient organisations’ activity.41\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Anne Sauviat (University of Cambridge) for her help in conducting web searches.
