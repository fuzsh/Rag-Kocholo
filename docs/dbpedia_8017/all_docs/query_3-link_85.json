        "text": "Fleming published his findings and presented his discovery to the Medical Research Club. To his surprise, his peers showed little interest in his work.\n\nUndeterred, he enlisted the help of several chemists, all leading experts in their fields, to help purify penicillin from the mould. None were successful. Professor Harold Raistrick, a Biochemist and expert in fungal substances enlisted by Fleming, declared \"the production of penicillin for therapeutic purposes...almost impossible.”\n\nPenicillin was labelled a laboratory curiosity and Fleming gave up attempts to purify it.\n\nIn June 1941 Florey decided to take penicillin to the US in hope of finding a way to scale up production.\n\nIn Peoria, Illinois, a new team was set up in the Department of Agriculture’s research laboratory. They utilised their expertise in fermentation and designed new techniques using deep fermentation tanks to make the purification of penicillin as efficient as possible.\n\nThe lab in Peoria had an abundance of corn-steep liquor, a by-product of corn starch. They discovered that when added to the mould broth, the yield of penicillin increased exponentially. The high concentration of sugars, amino acids and nitrogen provided an excellent environment for mould fermentation.\n\nThey started a global search for strains of mould with higher percentages of penicillin. Soil samples were sent in from around the world. But the solution was found closer to home. Mary Hunt, an Assistant at the Peoria lab, found a rotting cantaloupe melon at a local market. The mould produced six times more penicillin than Fleming’s original strain."
