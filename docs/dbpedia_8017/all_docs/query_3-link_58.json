        "text": "The UK’s presence in the rapidly expanding life sciences industry is not something that can be understated. Although life sciences companies have been declining in recent years—we can see from our data, there’s 17 fewer life sciences companies now than at the end of 2022—they still managed to secure £402m in funding, in Q3 2023 alone which speaks volumes about their economic impact.\n\nAs it stands, the UK boasts the position as Europe’s top biotech hub, particularly when it comes to startup funding in the biotech and pharmaceuticals sectors. These industries also take the lead in academic spinouts, with their rigorous research and testing processes aligning seamlessly with the university commercialisation model.\n\nThe role of biotech and pharmaceutical companies became even more pronounced during the battle against COVID-19. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, developed within the UK, was a key example of this. In line with its Life Sciences Vision, the UK Government has plans to further develop this sector, tackling some of the major causes of death and disease.\n\nIn this article, we’re delving into the UK’s pharmaceutical and biotech industries, ranking the top 15 based on the amount of equity funding they have secured to date.\n\nBiotechnology companies are at the forefront of innovation, harnessing the power of living organisms, including DNA, to craft a diverse array of products. While their primary sphere of activity lies within the healthcare industry, where they play a pivotal role in the development of life-saving medicines and therapeutic solutions, including gene therapies and vaccines, the scope of their impact extends far beyond this. Biotech firms also venture into the realm of agriculture and environmental sustainability, contributing to the creation of eco-friendly products like biofuels and genetically engineered crops, which address pressing global challenges.\n\nMany biotechnology giants have earned recognition for their groundbreaking work. This includes:\n\nPharmaceutical enterprises are renowned for their dedication to the development of medical solutions, primarily through the utilisation of chemicals and synthetic compounds. These companies often distinguish themselves through their substantial size and comprehensive scope, setting them apart from their biotechnology counterparts. Within the pharmaceutical landscape, mammoth corporations such as Novartis and Johnson & Johnson dominate the field, exemplifying the significant scale that big pharma companies operate on.\n\nThe core pursuit of pharmaceutical firms revolves around the research, development, and production of pharmaceutical drugs designed to treat an extensive range of medical conditions. This includes everything from over-the-counter remedies to complex prescription medications, catering to the diverse healthcare needs of a global population.\n\nThese companies are instrumental in facilitating access to a wide array of therapeutic options, contributing significantly to the improvement of public health. Their vast research and development budgets, coupled with extensive clinical trials, have paved the way for numerous life-changing drugs that have revolutionised the treatment of various diseases. These organisations wield the resources and expertise necessary to navigate the complex regulatory landscape, ensuring that their innovative products reach the market and make a substantial impact on patient care.\n\nEllipses Pharma is a London-based drug development company, focused on cancer treatments. It looks to acquire innovative cancer assets, with the aim of accelerating their progression through the clinical development process, using new trial designs and regulatory expertise.\n\nThe life sciences firm has raised £109m in equity investment so far, across five funding rounds. The majority of these deals were unannounced fundraisings, or stealth rounds, meaning they weren’t disclosed to the press, except for the most recent round in July 2023, where West Coast Capital was a noted investor towards the total £9.75m.\n\nFounded in 2016 and based in Oxford, Osler Diagnostics creates a handheld diagnostic device called the Osler Origin. The medical device (completed this year) can be used to rapidly test several different biomarkers of diseases and illnesses. Once approved, this will enable extensive diagnostic testing at speed.\n\nOsler Diagnostics is yet another University of Oxford spinout in this ranking. The medical diagnostics company has secured six innovation grants already, worth a combined £2.12m, from both Innovate UK and the Defence and Security Accelerate. It has also secured £144m in equity investment, across five funding rounds, from Braavos Investment Advisers, Lansdowne Partners, M&G Investors, Oxford Science Enterprises, and Bio-Rad Laboratories, amongst other investors.\n\nTouchlight is a DNA manufacturing company, based in London. It has created a new DNA replication technique, which is applicable to the production of vaccines, as well as other therapies. Touchlight’s rapid growth last year saw it place on the Deloitte Fast 50 ranking for 2021.\n\nSince its founding in 2008, the life sciences company has secured £147m of equity investment, across 11 fundraisings. Backers include Downing, Novator Partners, and Bridford Investments. It also received £14.1m in grants, the most recent of which was awarded in March 2023 through Life Sciences Innovative Manufacturing Fund (LSIMF). They attended the Mayor’s International Business Programme for ambitious businesses looking to expand overseas.\n\nQuell Therapeutics is a venture-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops Treg cell therapies for a range of conditions, including solid organ transplant rejection, and different autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The company was one of the UK’s top-funded spinouts in 2021, and aims to become a world leader in the cell therapy space.\n\nIt was spun-out from University College London and King’s College London in 2019, and has since secured £198m in equity funding, across four rounds. Among its investors are Syncona Partners, UCL Technology Fund, Future Fund: Breakthrough, and SV Health Investors, to name a few. They have also received one grant in July 2023, from AstraZeneca to support the development of its T-regulatory (Treg) cell therapies pipeline.\n\nThe UK’s biotech and pharmaceutical sector is a testament to the nation’s commitment to scientific innovation and healthcare advancement. In addition to hundreds more across the nation, the companies featured in this article have showcased remarkable dedication to research, development, and the improvement of medical solutions, both locally and on the global stage.\n\nTheir contributions are not only vital to the health and well-being of the population but also to the growth of the UK’s economy. As we look to the future, it’s evident that these companies will continue to be the driving force behind groundbreaking discoveries, new treatments, and a brighter, healthier tomorrow.\n\nIf you’re interested in finding out more about angel networks and the businesses that they invest in, the BeauhurstInvest platform is just what you need.
