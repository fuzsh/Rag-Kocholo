        "text": "There are four presentations of the original COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer/BioNTech authorised for use in Great Britain, three of which are currently available and all require dilution:\n\nThe 30 microgram/dose presentation (purple cap)\n\nThe 10 microgram/dose paediatric presentation currently for 5-11 year-olds (orange cap)\n\nThe 3 microgram/dose paediatric presentation currently for infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years (maroon cap)\n\nThe product information for the above three presentations can be found on this page.\n\nThere is currently no GB supply of the fourth presentation and the product information for this will only be published once this supply becomes available.\n\nAll four presentations use the same drug substance but have specific administration requirements and are differentiated by use of different coloured caps on the vials.\n\nInitially, the COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer/BioNTech was supplied in the UK on a temporary basis under Regulation 174 of the Human Medicine Regulations 2012, but this was always intended to be a temporary arrangement. Supply of the vaccine is now in accordance with the Marketing Authorisation with all remaining Regulation 174 stocks expiring at the end of February 2022.\n\nThe archived product information for the COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer/BioNTech authorised under Regulation 174 can also be found on this page.\n\nThe original conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) was issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 21 December 2020 and was automatically converted to a GB CMA on 1 January 2021. The CMA issued by the EMA has continued to have effect in Northern Ireland since 21 December 2020 and was converted to a full Marketing Authorisation (MA) on 10 October 2022. The GB CMA was converted to a full MA on 9 November 2022.\n\nThe information for healthcare professionals and UK recipients on using the vaccine safely has been updated as new data have become available and this will continue under the MA. Please regularly check this information as it is often updated."
