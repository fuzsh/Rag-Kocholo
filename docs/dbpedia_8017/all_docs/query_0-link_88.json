        "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the best-selling pharmaceuticals, leading to shifts in the list with Pfizer and BioNTech’s Comirnaty surpassing AbbVie’s Humira for the No. 1 spot in 2021. That momentum continued in 2022, with Pfizer and BioNTech jointly raking in $59.1 billion in revenue from the sales of the COVID-19 vaccine. Although Comirnaty maintained its position as the 50 best-selling pharmaceutical of 2022, it experienced a roughly 5% drop in sales compared to the previous year.\n\n[For the last roundup of bestsellers, check out the article “Best-selling pharmaceuticals of 2023 reveal a shift in pharma landscape,” most recently updated on March 21, 2023]\n\nAs the 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals of 2022 demonstrate, signs are emerging that the reign of COVID-19 vaccines and other therapies appears to be slipping. The two companies — and Moderna — plan on hiking prices to address the weakening demand.\n\nHumira: The second best-selling pharmaceutical of 2022 looking strong\n\nMeanwhile, the heavyweight tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker Humira, which had been the best-selling prescription medicine for most of the past decade, raked in $21.2 billion in 2022, securing the second spot among the 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals.\n\nNext in line was Merck & Co.’s cancer immunotherapy drug Keytruda, which generated $20.9 billion in revenue. The company is now working on a new subcutaneous formulation to protect its blockbuster drug from potential competition starting in 2028. Keytruda’s compound patent is protected from expiration in major markets until at least that year and into the following decade in the E.U. and Japan. Keytruda appears to be poised to reclaim the crown as the best-selling drug in 2023.\n\nOther COVID-19 therapies in the fourth and fifth positions\n\nIn the fourth slot in 2022 was Pfizer’s COVID-19 antiviral Paxlovid, which, despite not meeting expectations, still managed to generate $18.9 billion in revenue, making it one of the 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals.\n\nOther top-selling drugs included Moderna’s Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine, which secured the fifth position with $18.4 billion in revenue, and the anticoagulant Eliquis by Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, which occupied the sixth spot with $18.2 billion in sales.\n\nWhile COVID-19 took center stage again in 2022, drugs for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular diseases continued to be strong growth drivers, as this list of 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals of 2022 demonstrates. As the demand for COVID-19 vaccines continues to ebb, it is likely that the industry will continue to shift its focus back toward these core therapeutic areas.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article had included an incorrect total for Dupixent that added sales totals from Sanofi and Regeneron, which co-market the drug. But Sanofi reports the total global net product sales for Dupixent and Kevzara while Regeneron reports its share of the profits or losses from those sales. We’ve updated the sales figure for the drug to reflect this correct financial arrangement.\n\nDrug name\n\nManufacturer(s)\n\n2022 Sales\n\nIndication(s)\n\n1.
