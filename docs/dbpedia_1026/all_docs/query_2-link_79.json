        "text": "Seville International will handle international sales on Denys Arcand’s (The Barbarian Invasions) upcoming comedy The Fall Of The American Empire, a follow of sorts to his 1986 Oscar-nominee The Decline Of The American Empire.\n\nThe French-language film, which is currently in post-production, was written and directed by Arcand and produced by regular collaborator Denise Robert. In 2004, the duo teamed on The Barbarian Invasions which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and was nommed for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nAccording to the production, the movie “takes a witty and touching look at the predominance of money in a society where all other values seem to have crumbled.” The protagonist, Pierre-Paul Daoust, 36, an intellectual with a PhD in philosophy is forced to work as a deliveryman to afford a decent living. One day, while delivering a parcel, he gets caught in a hold up gone terribly wrong: two dead and millions in money bags laying on the ground. Pierre-Paul is confronted with a dilemma: leave empty handed, or take the money and run?”\n\nAlexandre Landry (Gabrielle) stars as Pierre-Paul Daoust with newcomer Maripier Morin, Louis Morissette (The Mirage), Maxim Roy (Look Again), Pierre Curzi (The Barbarian Invasions), Vincent Leclerc (The Revenant), Patrick Émmanuel Abellard, Florence Longpré (Threesome) and Eddy King rounding out the cast. Rémy Girard, a well-known actor who has previously collaborated with the director, completes the ensemble. This film marks his reunion with Arcand; the two worked together on The Decline Of The American Empire (1986) in which Girard had a leading role as well as on The Barbarian Invasions.\n\nThe deal was negotiated by Poirier for Seville International and Denise Robert on behalf of Cinémaginaire. Les Films Seville will release the film in Quebec on June 28, 2018.\n\n“It is an honour and a privilege to work closely with such a revered filmmaker as Denys Arcand. He is a visionary. I am a fierce admirer of his work and thrilled to be working with him and Denise again,” said Anick Poirier, SVP of Sales, Seville International. “The Fall Of The American Empire offers a compelling and humorous look at how our society has evolved for better or worse.”"
