        "text": "WARNING: SPOILERS\n\nCouldnt this have been called anything? It only really makes sense if American Empire is a metaphor for greed, or shady international finance, or something, and even then it doesnt quite work, because that stuff doesnt fall. It thrives, but for the other side. I'm reminded a bit of Vonnegut's “Cat's Cradle.” See the cat? See the cradle? Here it‘s: See the fall? See the empire? See the American?\n\nOh, wait. So this is a set piece to Denys Arcands The Decline of the American Empire (1986)? Which also didnt have much to do with the American empires decline.\n\nOh, wait. Apparently this could have been called something else, since the IMDb bio page for one of its stars, Maripier Morin, the hottie prostitute, says the following:\n\nShe stars in Le Triomphe de l’Argent, her first big role on the silver screen. The highly anticipated movie is directed by Oscar-winning director Denys Arcand.\n\nThats actually a better title.\n\nOh, wait. Its certainly a more accurate title. But better? Would I have seen it at the 2019 Seattle International Film Festival if it were called The Triumph of Money? Maybe not.\n\nCarry on.\n\nOldest profession, oldest cliché\n\nSo: A hapless Montrealer, Pierre-Paul Daoust (Alexandre Landry), too book-smart for his own good, who works a short-pants delivery job despite the wealth of western civilization in his head, is parked in a parking lot when a heist goes awrygangsters stealing from gangstersand, amid the blood and carnage, two gym bags full of money are just sitting there, exposed, on the pavement, for the taking. Our man stares at them, mouth agape, for a beat, two, four, and then shoves them in his delivery van behind some boxes. Police arrive, question him, let him go. At home, hes smart enough to take the gym bags through the front doors, since the company is notified whenever he opens his back doors. Then hes dumb enough to use a small fraction of the money to hire a high-class prostitute, Aspasie (Morin).\n\nInitially, hes intrigued because her hooker name is the same as an ancient Greek philosopher. Then hes intrigued because she looks like she looks and does what she does. Then he falls in love with her. With a prostitute. Worlds oldest profession? How about worlds oldest cliché.\n\nAt least shes not scamming himshes interested in what hes doing. Hes got a good heart, and wants to help people, and this opens up her heart. Its another gender reversalthe man making the woman a better person, cf., 《北京遇上西雅图》but is it believable? I didnt believe it.\n\nMeanwhile, forces are gathering against him/them. The cops (Maxim Roy and Louis Morissette) show up at Pierre-Pauls house as Aspasie is leaving, and they know her, and they know how much she costs, so theyre wondering how a deliveryman can afford a prostitute who charges more than his monthly wage? Now hes their No. 1 suspect. They also warn him that this is gang money, and theyre going to want it back, but Pierre-Paul stays the course. He aligns with Sylvain The Brain Bigras (longtime Arcand collaborator Rémy Girard), a convict who knows money, but not enough of it, so they contact an old customer of Aspasies at a high-end investment firm, Maître Wilbrod Taschereau (Pierre Curzi), who knows how to launder money internationally. Initially hes reluctant; then he takes it on.\n\nMeanwhile, the gang is going after suspects in the brutal fashion of gangs. The surviving robber is beaten, handcuffed behind his back, and then hoisted into the air until his shoulders tear and give way. Brutal. I had to turn away. Then the man who planned the robbery, and who owned the store that was robbed, and acts oddly untouchable, is touched: Going to his car, hes shot in the head. Also brutal. We fear for Pierre-Paul and the rest.\n\nNice to be nice to the nice\n\nHow does one legally get rid of millions? It cant physically cross the border; so they find people with money internationally, who generally cant touch it, and trade that for the cash. Then Wilbrod routes the international money to this country and that. It goes to South Africa, then Britain before winding up in, of course, Switzerland. The exchanges for the paper money occur even as the cops close in.\n\nThe best scenes are in the beginning (Pierre-Pauls speech about being too smart to be successfullook for it soon on YouTube), but I like how it ends. In that, it just ends. We think both cops and gangsters are after our hero, and the cops nearly nab him, so we wait for the other shoe to drop. It never does. Theres no confrontation with the bad guys. How often does that happen in the movies? When we give up that possibility? Imagine Tarantino turning that down, for example. Our heroes turn the financial tables to benefit the downtrodden and get away with it. Thats fun.\n\nBut theres a liberal squishiness to the movie I found a bit much: about the homeless; about Pierre-Paul giving coin to panhandlers; about good things happening to good people. Its a nice thought. As nice as a beautiful prostitute falling in love with your sorry ass."
