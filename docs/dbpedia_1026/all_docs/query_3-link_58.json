        "text": "Oscar Award winner Denys Arcand’s films such as The Barbarian Invasions and The Decline of the American Empire have garnered both praise and criticism over the years. In this critically acclaimed biography, which appeared first in French, Réal La Rochelle traces the portrait of an artist-intellectual, revealing the passion of a creator for his craft, as well as the setbacks Arcand has encountered. In the background is the history of Quebec, the birthplace of Arcand’s filmic oeuvre, and of course Montreal—the city where all his films have been shot."
