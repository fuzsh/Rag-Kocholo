        "text": "As today is Good Friday and we approach Easter on Sunday, we thought it fitting to highlight some of the best movies for Easter. Some choices are conventional narratives of the life of Christ, while others are less conventional, but still appropriate for the season. If you need help picking a movie to watch on Easter Sunday, let our choices help you make your decision.\n\nBen-Hur (1959) directed by William Wyler\n\nThe greatest of all biblical epics, Ben-Hur is not a traditional narrative of the life of Jesus, but its subtitle, A Tale of the Christ, should make its Easter theme clear. The action sequences — the naval battle, the chariot race — alone make all 212 minutes of the film worthwhile, but there's so much more than the spectacle. At its heart, it's the complex exploration of an individual bent on revenge redeemed by the selfless act of Christ that makes the film fascinating. For sword-and-sandal films, it doesn't get any better than Ben-Hur with Charlton Heston. - Aren\n\nJesus of Montreal (Jésus de Montréal ) (1989) directed by Denys Arcand\n\nArcand's film is a far from orthodox but offers a fascinating take on the Jesus story. A troop of actors in Montréal put on a passion play that angers the priest that commissioned it by suggesting \"historical Jesus\" revisions that challenge church teachings such as the virginity of Mary. But as it unfolds the film also suggests that the story of Jesus might have something to say to even late-twentieth century Canadians, not just as the story of a nice man whose life we might emulate, but as a matter of life and death. - Anders\n\nThe Passion of the Christ (2004) directed by Mel Gibson\n\nBeautifully composed and lighted, like a Baroque painting, yet relentlessly violent and difficult to watch, Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ provokes an extreme and deep reaction to the suffering and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Gibson eschews the nice, complacent pieties and clean, bright visuals of many 1950s and 60s religious epics, yet retains the essential melodrama of the events. Ultimately, this is a very personal vision of Christ's Passion, but a deeply moving one accessible to those not prepared to resist it. - Anton\n\nDo you agree with our picks? Are there any great Easter movies that we've forgotten? Let us know in the comments."
