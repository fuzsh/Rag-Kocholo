        "text": "NEW YORK — With the arrival Friday of Denys Arcand’s latest French language crime caper, “The Fall of the American Empire,” the Oscar-winning, hit-making Montreal auteur can proudly say, “This is the only job I’ve ever had — making movies. This is the only thing I know how to do.”\n\nIt’s won him three Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award nominations — winning one for 2003’s “The Barbarian Invasions,” which also gave him a fourth Best Original Screenplay Oscar nomination.\n\n“Fall” revolves around a brilliant, unemployed PhD who steals millions in drug money after a heist turns murderous and then needs the help of a high-end hooker, savvy ex-con and suave banker to make the cash untraceable.\n\n“Fall” began with a newspaper headline that led to four years of research and writing.\n\n“On my desk, there is an open file called Project X in which I jot down all sorts of stuff.\n\n“For instance,” Arcand, 77, continued, “there was a very violent killing in Montreal at this fake ‘fashion boutique.’ Two young black guys came in — as you see at the beginning of the film — and just shot two people.”\n\nIn the head.\n\n“Yeah, it was related to a mafia killing and it was at noon on a small street in a business district! These two guys were so unbelievably violent and brazen. I said, This would be a great opening for a film — I didn’t know which film.”\n\nArcand knew the detective in charge. “I had worked with him when I did ‘Barbarian Invasions.’ He was involved because there was a drug aspect and he started explaining to me the unbelievable amount of money that’s made with the drug trade.\n\n“So I gathered a lot of information about that and discovered the big problem is: What do you do with the cash? How do you launder that money?”\n\nArcand laughed. “Very often” — as we see in his movie — “they actually dig holes into the ground and put it there. Because it’s almost impossible to get rid of it.”\n\nThat led to “researching the problem of money laundering and very sophisticated lawyers and tax specialists.\n\n“Eventually,” he concluded with a big smile, “I came up with this story.”\n\n(“The Fall of the American Empire” opens Friday.)"
