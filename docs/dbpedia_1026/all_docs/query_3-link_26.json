His ex-wife, Louise, asks their estranged son, Sebastian, a successful businessman living in London, to come home. Sebastian makes the impossible happen, using his contacts and disrupting the Canadian healthcare system in every way possible to help his father fight his terminal illness to the bitter end, while reuniting some of Remy's old friends, including Pierre, Alain, Dominique, Diane, and Claude, who return to see their friend before he passes on.",

        "text": "With The Decline of the American Empire, Denys Arcand became the first Canadian director to have a film nominated for the Oscar for Best International Feature. It only seems fitting, then, that the film’s sequel, The Barbarian Invasions, would go on to be the first (and so far, only) Canadian film to win the award. Whatever nostalgia is held for Arcand’s seminal sex comedy—of which there appears to be very little in this, the year of our lord 2023—probably contributed somewhat to its follow-up’s lofty praise upon release 20 years ago; the film not only won the International Feature Oscar, but was also nominated for Arcand’s screenplay, as well as winning the corresponding award in Cannes alongside Marie-Josée Croze’s surprise…\n\nA college professor whose at the cliff of dying try to make amends with everyone on his life.\n\nSo to refresh everyone's mind, a few months back I get to review \"The Decline Of The American Empire,\" a sex \"comedy\" about a group of old people just talking about sex for almost two hours. My rating for that movie, as you may expect, was bad. I still kinda hate it, and find it completely boring.\n\nHowever, this belated sequel was surprisingly better. I believe the best is the fact that we no longer have a bunch of people just talking about sex, but there's actually something resembling a plot. The whole thing with the son was rather good, and the…\n\nLes invasions barbares (2003)\n\n5/10\n\nThis is like a \"smart 16-year old\" idea of what an \"adult art movie\" is. Filled with references to sex, jerking off and blowjobs (but without the actual presence of a bare breast, a penis or anything remotely close to a sexual act, God Forbid we sink into that immaturity), as well as name-dropping various people from history of around the world, as well as writers and philosophers (they even make time to mention Solzhenytsin twice, maybe the worst Nobel prize winner of Literature in the 20th century), thought schools and all that. They even make a subplot about heroin! How brave! How amazing! And the whole thing is soured up by the fact that…\n\nThe film centers on Remy, who's dying of cancer, and his relationship with his son, Sebastien, a very successful businessman. Like many father-son relationships, this one is complicated largely because Remy is a bad, absentee father.\n\nRemy's womanizing broke up his family, he's very selfish and his years as a history professor have been met with failure except for his ability to bed many female students. Now that's he's dying, Sebastien's mother guilts him into flying from London to Montreal to spend time with his father, who he doesn't even like.\n\nThe film starts off strong, but really lags at times. It's also hard to believe the effort Sebastien goes through for his awful father. I certainly wouldn't do it…"
