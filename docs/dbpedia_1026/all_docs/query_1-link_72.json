        "text": "You'd have to describe this startling Canadian film as a religious parable, but don't be put off: believers and atheists will equally find this 1989 movie belatedly getting its British DVD premiere thought-provoking and wickedly funny.\n\nThe central conceit is that the actor playing Jesus in the local passion play starts finding his life paralleling that of his part. Writer-director Denys Arcand uses this as a peg to attack the church and showbiz with equal vigour, and his lead actor, Lothaire Bluteau, makes a charismatic focus whose performance makes sense of the whole thing.\n\nIf this makes it all sound a bit po-faced, nothing could be further from the truth: Arcand throws in a hilarious scene with the actors doing a porn-movie voiceover and stages the play-within-a-film brilliantly.\n\nComplete with walking on water, levitation and a painful-looking crucifixion, and set on a hill above Montreal's twinkling lights, this is a passion play you'd like to attend: in the film it's too passionate for a conformist church and this leads to a chain of events leading to an appropriately miraculous ending."
