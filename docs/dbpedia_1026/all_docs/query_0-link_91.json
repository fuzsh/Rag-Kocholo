It`s time for an overhaul. So the priest in charge hires a new director and lead role (Lothaire Bluteau) with a younger, more inventive cast to stage a revised and updated version. Gradually and inevitably, they find that the story of the life of Christ has an extraordinary impact on their real-life existence. Denys Arcand`s Jesus Of Montreal was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 1990."
