        "text": "The latest films of transnational auteur Denis Villeneuve realize the aesthetic and cultural potential of Hollywood to embrace foreign talent. Originally a Québécois arthouse director, Villeneuve has emerged from a minority national cinema to recently stake a claim as a major Hollywood director. On this journey, he has traversed the geographical borders of both Québec and then Canada to transcend national cinematic borders in creating transnational arthouse blockbusters. Villeneuve may have been a household name in Québec for many years, but until his recent successes in Hollywood he was virtually unheard of outside the French-speaking Canadian province. Coming from the small national cinema of Québec to work in Hollywood, Villeneuve is a new breed of transnational filmmaker, one who has intentionally made films in Hollywood but only on a temporary basis, relocating his skill but not his national affiliation.

The long list of participants included filmmakers, producers and film collectives from France; Latin American political filmmakers and representatives of burgeoning African cinema; film critics, historians, producers, and distributors from all over Europe and North America, including, of course, the Canadian organizers of the conference, André Pâquet and the Comité d'Action Cinématographique (CAC). Given the number and diverse backgrounds of the participants, the Montreal conference could be considered the most important event in world political cinema of the period. However, despite its obvious importance to reconstructing the history of the international(ist) film movements of the 1960s and 70s, the meeting has been completely overlooked in scholarship. This special issue seeks to rectify this omission by bringing together essays analyzing different aspects and geopolitical agendas which shaped this conference, basing its findings on the are audiovisual recordings of the talks, workshops and debates of the conference, which are currently archived at the Cinémathèque québécoise."
