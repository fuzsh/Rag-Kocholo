        "text": "(Disclaimer: For this list, there is at first glance, omissions. The films, DaysofDarkness (2007) and The Fall of the American Empire (2018) seem to be swept from the annals of the places like Amazon and as of this writing, the latter may not be available for purchase or rental yet. So only two of filmmaker Denys Arcand’s works in the series will be evaluated here.)\n\nThe films The Decline of the American Empire (1986) and its sequel The Barbarian Invasions (2003) stand as cinematic gems to be mulled over and considered for their wit, warmth, intensity, and the connection between the intellect and all things corporeal. In each of the films, Arcand presents images of sex in an unapologetic and adult way. There are plenty of laughs and intriguing plot lines included in both works. As the stories play out, the actors in both films deliver sometimes crisp and other times meandering monologues. The mind is prized throughout each of the pieces of cinema. Laughs and tears find their way from the page to the screen. The movies are elegant French-Canadian dishes that are delicious, intriguing, and moving, ultimately. Viewers may enjoy the crackling cleverness and the sincere pathos. For not being American movies in terms of where the filmmakers shot them, the cast and crew, and the overall sensibility of traditional American cinema, the two movies illustrate a very human image that anyone of any nationality, race, or other background trait can relate to on a real level. The mere fact that the American movie posters just show the word “Sex!” instead of a set of breasts and a penis show the gulf between the French-Canadian views of sex. So, take a portion of that coulibiac and be careful with those doses of heroin for, \"Why Are You Ranking: Best of the Denys Arcand film series from slightly stimulated to aroused.\"\n\nAn Interview\n\n2. 'The Decline of the American Empire' (1986)\n\nThe title itself seems to be an affront to the good old US of A. But upon further inspection, the title is just a subtle critique of how America views sex and sexuality and culture. Replete with comic dialogue, this picture brings together friends for a dinner. It may seem typical, almost pedestrian. But the words that these actors say drip with sex and intellectualism. The jokes are at times immature and advanced almost in the same breath. There’s some suspect talk concerning pederasty but it is smoothed over with the understanding that the character has no intentions of sexually assaulting little boys. The contrast of women exercising and men preparing meals is a clash of the gender roles that most American cinema has not shown. In between the laughs, there exist serious concerns like HIV-AIDS. With the simple premise, Arcand is able to hang complex talk and a strong first entry into this collection.\n\nRank: Slightly Stimulated\n\nA Well-deserved Statuette\n\n1. 'The Barbarian Invasions' (2003)\n\nWinner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, this picture deserves it. At once humorous and melancholic, this picture explores the time not long after the events of September 11, 2001. At its crux is the relationship between a father and his son. Sébastian is a successful businessman living in London. That should give this movie a boost for showing a positive light on businessmen on celluloid. His father, Rémy, is ailing from cancer. Sébastian could care less. He holds that Rémy ruined his family and he at first wants nothing to do with him. Through all of this, there is talk of sex (of course) and the use of drugs. But what makes this movie stand out among its many strengths is its portrayal of the abysmal healthcare system in Canada that is so revered by Americans who are clueless regarding Canada’s Medicare system. What earned this film the Oscar is the fact that the relationship between father and son is further explored and the ending is a powerful, poignant display to wrap up the best of the series of films."
