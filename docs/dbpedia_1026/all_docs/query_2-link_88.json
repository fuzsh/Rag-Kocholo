        "text": "At 73 years of age, Academy Award-winning director Denys Arcand says he just wants to have fun.\n\n\"You know I'm set for life. I just want to have fun. So this here at the musée is fun. Doing the opera is fun. Doing my last film [An Eye for Beauty] was also great fun,\" he says.\n\nArcand says he doesn't know what the future holds, but at the moment he's enjoying setting up a fine art video installation at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nIt's called Les Bourgeois de Vancouver and it's inspired by the famous Rodin sculpture, Les Bourgeois de Calais. Arcand's piece is part of a major Rodin exhibition opening in Montreal on May 30.\n\nLes Bourgeois de Calais [Burgers of Calais] is a series of six larger-than-life sculptures of the men from the French city of Calais who gave themselves up to the King of England during the Hundred Years' War to save their fellow citizens.\n\nArcand and Hannah decided to pay tribute to Rodin's original work by doing a modern version of the sculpture in Vancouver using living people.\n\nWhere Rodin explored the emotions of men who thought they were marching to their death, Arcand and Hannah track the stories of six down and out Vancouverites so desperate for cash that they're willing to stand on the steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery for days on end and pretend to be a sculpture.\n\nAs Arcand says they're people \"who will stand all day long in Vancouver on a street corner mimicking a statue by a dead Frenchman.\"\n\nArcand and Hannah took video of the models during their performance and in their day-to-day lives. The six videos are installed on monitors set up vertically like full-length mirrors in a room which will also hold the six statues from the original Rodin sculpture.\n\nArcand describes the piece as a sociological portrait of Vancouver, or a portrait that focuses on the struggles of some Vancouverites to make a living.\n\nHis cast of characters includes an older Korean lady who speaks only Korean, a convicted swindler, a French-Canadian ski bum with a beautiful body, a sawmill worker who's lost his job, a former junkie and a poet.\n\nArcand's first opera\n\nLes Bourgeois de Vancouver is only one of Arcand's side projects this month.\n\nHe's also directing his first opera with chamber orchestra Les violons du roy.\n\nArcand says he's dreamt of directing an opera for years on the condition that he be able to cast the singers just as he casts his actors in his movies.\n\n\"Choosing the right person is 60 per cent of my work for a movie. It should be the same thing in opera. I don't want to work with someone an artistic director has chosen five years ago. What if they've gained 40 pounds and they're supposed to be the love interest and I'm stuck to work with her?\"\n\nThe performance of the French baroque opera Zémire et Azor by A. Grétry, based on the story of Beauty and the Beast, takes place May 23 at the Maison symphonique de Montréal and May 27 at the Palais Montcalm in Quebec City.\n\nMetamorphoses In Rodin's Studio opens at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts May 30 and runs until Oct. 18, 2015.\n\nLes Bourgeois de Vancouver will also be shown during TIFF in September."
