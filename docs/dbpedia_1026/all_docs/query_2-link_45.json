He won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2004 for The Barbarian Invasions. He has also been nominated three further times, including two nominations in the same category for The Decline of the American Empire in 1986 and Jesus of Montreal in 1989, becoming the only French-Canadian director in history to receive this number of nominations and, subsequently, to win the award.
