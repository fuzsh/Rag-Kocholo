        "text": "The Burghers of Vancouver\n\nFebruary 11–May 16, 2015\n\nCanadian Cultural Centre\n\n5 rue de Constantine\n\n75007 Paris\n\nFrance\n\nHours: Monday–Friday 10am–6pm\n\nFree admission\n\nT+ 33 1 44 43 21 90\n\nwww.canada-culture.org\n\nTwitter\n\nExhibition curator: Catherine Bédard\n\nIn partnership with the Musée Rodin, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and the Toronto International Film Festival\n\nA stone’s throw from the Musée Rodin, the Canadian Cultural Centre presents an exhibition of works by Denys Arcand and Adad Hannah consisting of video and photographic works related the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, and his monument Les Bourgeois de Calais (1885).\n\nAt the heart of the exhibition is a new video installation that revisits the idea of the urban monument by hiring six citizens to perform a tableau vivant of Rodin’s seminal sculpture on a civic plaza.\n\nThe exhibition also features three other projects by Adad Hannah related to Rodin’s sculpture: Unwrapping Rodin (2010), a series of photographs which transpose the photographic decompositions produced by Muybridge and Marey in the late 19th century, shows the unwrapping of a life-size Pierre de Wissant, one of the six burghers of Calais; Les Bourgeois de Calais: Crated and Displaced (2010), a composition made up of six screens, considers our relationship to the image of a monument known through reproductions; and Age of Bronze (2004), a series of three video-recorded tableaux vivants produced at the National Gallery of Canada, a reflection on gender/genre (sexual and artistic), hierarchy (roles within an institution) and more generally on the relationship between the gaze and power, all of this focussing on Rodin’s anti-academic male nude Age of Bronze (1877).\n\nDenys Arcand (b. 1941) is an Academy Award-winning director, whose films have won over 100 prestigious awards around the world. He has directed 23 feature films including The Decline of the American Empire (The Director’s Fortnight, Cannes Film Festival 1986, nominated for an Academy Award), Jesus of Montréal (Jury’s Grand Prize and the Ecumenical Prize, Cannes Film Festival 1989), The Barbarian Invasions (Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, César Awards for Best Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay, and several Canadian Jutra [Quebec] and Genie Awards in 2004), Days of Darkness (Out of Competition Official Selection, Cannes Film Festival 2007) and An Eye for Beauty (Toronto International Film Festival 2014).\n\nAdad Hannah (b. 1971) earned his BFA from Emily Carr University in Vancouver and his MA and PhD from Concordia University in Montreal. He has exhibited in and produced works on-site for museums around the world. He has been awarded several prizes, including the Victor Martyn Lynch-Staunton Award of the Canada Council for the Arts. His works feature in the permanent collections of the National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa); Museo Tamayo (Mexico City); Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art (Seoul); San Antonio Museum of Art; Musée d’Art Contemporain de Montréal and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts among others. Adad Hannah is represented by Pierre-François Ouellette Art Contemporain (Montreal) and Equinox Gallery (Vancouver)."
