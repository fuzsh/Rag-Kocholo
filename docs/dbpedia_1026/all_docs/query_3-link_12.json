But if you want to call me a pessimist, fine. Call me a pessimist.”\n\nI was telling Denys Arcand that Le déclin de l’empire américain, one of his most famous movies, doesn’t exactly deliver a super upbeat portrait of humanity and nor does his latest movie, Testament. This was prompted by Arcand saying that his wife and longtime producer Denise Robert hates Le Déclin, one of the most acclaimed movies in the history of Québécois cinema.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nThere with you then.

She thinks it destroys every value she holds sacred,” Arcand said.\n\nLe Déclin, a remarkable incisive dramatic comedy, revolves around a gang of francophone Montreal academics, and it’s fair to say they’re not necessarily the most likable characters. Its sequel, Les invasions barbares, which is the only Canadian film to win the Oscar as best foreign-language film, is if anything even more pessimistic, with Arcand portraying the same group of baby boomers a couple of decades later who — like so many in that generation — have ditched the ideals they held so dear back in the 1960s and ’70s.\n\nThose same ideals are but a distant memory in Testament. Rémy Girard — who starred in Le Déclin and Les invasions barbares — plays Jean-Michel, the main character, a 70-something archivist who appears to be just running down the string on his life. He’s living at an old-folks home, and his idea of a good time is taking a stroll through the cemetery while thinking of his death.\n\nIt’s another bleak satire from Arcand, this time focusing on the woke culture that clearly perplexes both Jean-Michel and Arcand himself. Both are trying to come to grips with a world where you have to worry about which pronouns you use and which cultural community you might be offending with your words or actions. The woke movement comes crashing into Jean-Michel’s life when a group of protesters gathers daily outside his seniors residence to denounce what they see as a racist painting in the building. It’s a portrait of Jacques Cartier meeting a group of semi-nude Indigenous people.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPretty well no one comes out unscathed in Testament, with Arcand skewering the politically correct protesters, aging Québécois nationalists, cynical politicians, TV reporters and pretentious cultural bureaucrats. He’s an equal-opportunity satirist.\n\nMany see it as an attack on woke culture, but Arcand doesn’t look at it that way.\n\n“It’s not at all an attack,” Arcand said. “It’s my bewilderment at woke culture. But not just woke culture. There’s also tons of other stuff happening right now that are of concern to you and to other people. I read the other day that some computer experts are thinking that in 20 years artificial intelligence will have destroyed most of mankind. Others are saying climate is such a threat. The whole situation we are in right now, for me at least, it’s like the end of western civilization.”\n\nI mention to Arcand that he was talking about the decline of the American empire in 1986. At the time, that seemed like a radical thought, but here we are nearly 40 years later and many more people are talking about a declining American empire.\n\n“It’s my reason for being — that’s what an artist does,” Arcand said. “If you read carefully the Russian authors of the 19th century, you will see the (Russian) revolution coming. That’s what artists do: They foresee the future. It’s not a precise vision, but it’s a feeling that something will break soon.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHe mentions that Aldous Huxley’s 1932 novel Brave New World, with scenes of people popping happiness pills, predicted today’s world much more prophetically than George Orwell’s 1984.\n\nAsked why PC woke-ism irritates him so much, Arcand says that’s not the word he would use.\n\n“It’s more of a perplexity,” Arcand said. “The actual world is so different from what I’ve known. When I was a history student at the Université de Montréal, we had great teachers, major historians. If I had gone to the university and said this professor used a word that I found offensive and it’s hurting me, I would have been (kicked out of the university. They would have said) ‘Who are you to speak? Go away!’ And now it’s the professor that’s blamed, and that to me poses a real question. Because then what? There are words you can’t say anymore because they might hurt people. Fine. People get hurt all the time. So you’re going to build a world where no one’s ever going to get hurt?”\n\nSome might say that makes Arcand a reactionary, but like any great satirist — from Jonathan Swift to Mordecai Richler — he’s just looking at the world around him and calling it like he sees it. And when you do that, you can’t be thinking about political correctness.\n\nOn Tout le monde en parle recently, he delivered a scathing critique of Québécois boomer nationalists, saying they thought if they just kept singing Gens du pays, separation would magically happen. In Testament, he makes fun of the people protesting the painting, but he also includes a scene in which a Mohawk woman examines the controversial tableau and says it’s an image of the beginning of a genocide.\n\n“The plight of the authentic Indigenous people is horrible and the history in Canada is abominable,” Arcand said. “And we should do everything we can to help them. They have huge problems, and I’m not sure a painting in an old-folks home would be their main concern.”\n\nbkelly@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/brendanshowbiz\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nDenys Arcand's new film was inspired by infamous Old Montreal shooting\n\nNew Denys Arcand film a crime thriller about our obsession with money\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
