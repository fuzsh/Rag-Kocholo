        "text": "Canada Post has issued a new stamp honouring acclaimed Canadian filmmaker Denys Arcand, whose career has spanned more than 60 years. Known for his intellectual curiosity, the Quebec-born artist has written and directed over two dozen films, television series and documentaries. Among Arcand’s box office successes is 1986 comedy Le déclin de l’empire américain, which won eight Genie Awards and became the first Canadian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Arcand built on that success with Jésus de Montréal (1989) and Les invasions barbares (2003), which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film – a first for Quebec and Canada. The stamp features a black and white photograph by Bertand Carrière of Arcand behind the camera in 1985.\n\nNetflix Canada is phasing out its $9.99 “basic” option, its cheapest subscription without ads.
