        "text": "At Arizona Christian University, our academic degree programs are aimed at helping young Christians become productive, conscientious adults who serve the Lord and contribute to the world in meaningful ways. Earning a baccalaureate degree in any of these programs prepares graduates to enter the professional world in a broad variety of occupations. What’s more, in keeping with our mission, all students earn a bible minor by taking a minimum of 18 credit hours of biblical studies in conjunction with their major course of study, ensuring that Christ is never absent from their curriculum in college or their careers after they graduate. The Business Administration degree opens career paths in administration, accounting, management, marketing, merchandising, and more. Those who graduate with a degree in Christian Ministries, Biblical Studies, Music Ministry, or Youth Ministry frequently go directly into ministry or missionary work. Education students graduate with their degree AND with Arizona State Certification and ACSI (Association of Christian Schools International) Certification. They are prepared, qualified, and certified to begin their teaching careers in public, private, Christian, or charter schools on the day they leave here. Graduates in Family Studies are prepared for careers in social services, human services, and family services; some have taken what they’ve learned into law enforcement. Depending on emphasis, Music students prepare for careers in the performing arts, teaching and ministry. Most students opting for Pre-Law or Pre-Med are planning on continuing their education past the bachelor’s degree, and because ACU has coveted regional accreditation, graduates of all bachelor’s degree programs are prepared and qualified to further their education in graduate schools, seminaries, and universities that offer post-graduate degrees. Arizona Christian is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges (HLCNCA)*, and it is an Affiliate Campus of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU)."
