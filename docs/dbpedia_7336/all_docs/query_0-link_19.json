        "text": "Arizona Christian University Degree Programs\n\nCheck out our ranking of the Top 50 Online Christian Colleges for Future Missionaries.\n\nArizona Christian University (ACU) is a private educational institution located in Glendale, AZ. The school features a Christian-based curriculum that features ethical approaches to over. ACU opened its doors in 1960 as a Bible School. Today, the college has expanded its role to include over 50 pathways toward baccalaureate degrees with an accumulation of over 20 minors as well. In 2017 ACU gained permission to begin offering degrees online and has begun an effort to reach students heretofore unable to spend time in classes.\n\nArizona Christian limits its student body to 820. With this small size, the school has seen no need to divide its programs into multiple schools or divisions. The school may do so in the future since it is contemplating developing a graduate program and because of necessity if online programs increase.\n\nThe school presents one associate degree—Associate of Arts in General Studies—and one certification—Certificate in Bible Studies—for beginning students. These programs are designed to immerse students in the educational process for the first time, teaching them how to study and perform at a high academic level.\n\nThe school offers several baccalaureate degrees in a variety of fields. Students have an opportunity to explore areas of study in such diverse subjects as business, theology, music, journalism, English, history, family studies, sports, communication, criminal justice, education, film, health care, mathematics, political science, and psychology. All these subjects are studied with the development of human spirituality in mind as a foundational force for a civilized world.\n\nACU keeps with its original intent as a Bible School by not only fostering a spiritual approach to the problems and diversity of the modern world, it still maintains a presence in the theological community with degrees such as:\n\nBachelor of Arts in Biblical Studies – Biblical Languages\n\nBachelor of Arts in Biblical and Theological Studies\n\nBachelor of Science in Christian Ministries – Interdisciplinary Studies\n\nBachelor of Science in Christian Ministries\n\nBachelor of Science in Music – Modern Worship\n\nBachelor of Science in Music – Music Ministry\n\nArizona Christian is opening its campaign into the online presence. Even though the school has just entered the online space over the last three years, its programs are growing. Today, the school offers six of its baccalaureate degrees online, including:\n\nBachelor of Science in Business Administration\n\nBachelor of Arts in Biblical and Theological Studies\n\nBachelor of Science in Elementary Education\n\nBachelor of Arts in Family Studies – Marriage and Family\n\nBachelor of Science in Secondary Education (Certified)\n\nBachelor of Science in Behavioral Health\n\nArizona Christian offers students the opportunity to expand their major degrees with a minor. Currently, ACU does not offer any of its minor degrees online, but the future looks positive as many of its minor degrees correspond with those majors offered online. The school offers 12 minor degrees in the traditional classroom setting, including:\n\nMinor in Behavioral Health\n\nMinor in Biblical Studies\n\nMinor in Communication\n\nMinor in Accounting\n\nMinor in Business Administration\n\nMinor in Management\n\nMinor in Marketing\n\nMinor in Sport Management\n\nMinor in Political Science\n\nMinor in Family Studies\n\nMinor in Music\n\nMinor in Secondary Education\n\nEven though ACU is not yet offering graduate-level degrees, the school has applied for and received permission to pursue building graduate-level programs. These programs take years to develop as they need to be presented for accreditation before being offered as a degree, whether in a traditional classroom or online.\n\nAbout Arizona Christian University\n\nSince its creation in 1960, Arizona Christian has generated graduates who enter the fragile world of business, healthcare, or education with a strength that few other graduates from other schools can boast. The school centers its curriculum on building the internal strength of students to engage the complexities and damages an independent foray into the world encounters. Holding that the Christian faith has infinite value in character building, ACU proudly presents its students to the world as examples of the meaning of the term “civilized” means.\n\nUS News & World Report ranks Arizona Christian as 22nd among Regional Colleges West and 21st in Top Performers in Social Mobility.
