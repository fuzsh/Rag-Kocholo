If you seek a university that is courageously Christian, then Arizona Christian University is the place for you.\n\nBest Regional Colleges\n\nIn The West\n\nSeven Years In A Row\n\nUS News & World Report, 2017-2023\n\n#1 University\n\nIn Arizona\n\nCollege Consensus, 2018 and 2019\n\nTop 50\n\nBible Schools\n\nChristian Universities Online, 2017\n\nNEWS\n\nCRC: Evangelical Influence Declining\n\nUS Undergoing ‘Generational’ Shift\n\nGet George Barna’s Book: Raising Spiritual Champions\n\nACU Spotlight\n\n“I chose ACU because I loved how the students and faculty felt like a family. The relationships that everyone had with each other and the faculty and staff were an awesome community that I wanted to be a part of.”\n\nEmily Hobrock\n\nSophomore\n\nAt ACU I studied and became friends with students from throughout the United States and from around the world. I will take the spiritual knowledge, education and relationships with faculty and students into everything I do for God’s Kingdom.\n\nDarius Gasatura\n\nalumnus, seminary student\n\nThe ACU Music Department has allowed me the freedom to express, grow, and challenge myself in worship. I chose this program over others because of its intimate environment that is entirely fixed on Jesus, and the people involved in it. Our program is the perfect size for you to gain experience in your craft and build deep relationships with faculty. With leaders who are seeking to train musicians who are passionate about the Gospel, and sensitive to the Spirit, one cannot help but to grow.\n\nBailey Goalstone\n\nmusic student\n\nsmall is\n\ngood\n\nYou won’t be lost in a crowd at Arizona Christian University. Students develop long-lasting relationships through community building experiences such as small group Bible studies, academic study groups, on-campus worship, athletic events and more."
