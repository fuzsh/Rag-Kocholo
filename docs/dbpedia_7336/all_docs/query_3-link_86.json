This opportunity gives ACU room to grow on a campus that is much larger and has dozens of state of the art academic and student life buildings. The move follows the completion of a land exchange agreement through which ACU is exchanging land of equal value – for its campus on Cactus Road in Phoenix. We hope you will share in celebrating God’s faithfulness as ACU’s pursues it’s vital mission!\n\nA UNIVERSITY UNLIKE\n\nANY OTHER\n\nACU is an accredited, private, non-profit, Christian university in Phoenix, Arizona with a wide variety of majors and areas of study preparing students for successful careers, while remaining committed to its vision of transforming culture with biblical truth. Students actively engage in biblically-integrated degrees, with critical thinking skills that last a lifetime. Spiritual development is also integrated within the University experience where all four-year campus students receive a minor in Biblical Studies, attend chapel twice a week, and complete spiritual formation and service hours each semester."
