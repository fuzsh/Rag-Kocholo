        "text": "My experience at Arizona Christian University has been an amazing experience. I have been able to express myself a lot through the activities that they have for new students to go to and just be able to get comfortable in big group settings that all worship the same God that I do. I love it here! There athletic programs are AMAZING! I am on the woman’s golf team and from the workouts to practice everything is very well organized and coordinated. I am so excited to continue my education here!\n\nI had a great time at Arizona Christian University. It is a great opportunity to grow as a person while excelling academically. They did their best to provide a fun student life, but with it being such a small campus, some events did not get a lot of love.\n\nI work at Arizona Christian and can affirm that the faculty and staff are committed to the school’s mission to teach with a biblical worldview in every subject and to train students to transform culture with truth. In a time when so many “Christian” colleges have drifted, ACU is holding fast to biblical doctrines.\n\nThe professors at ACU are incredibly caring and individually shepherd students. Students that engage with faculty, student life, and spiritual formation opportunities such as chapel and Bible study have an amazing experience in a tight-knit Christian community. The schools is growing and launching new academic programs, as well as making updates to campus facilities. If you are looking for a Christian university in Arizona, ACU is the place for students to flourish academically, spiritually, and socially.\n\nOverall, the experience has been great! There are a few professors that didn’t teach well, it was almost like a self taught class (math and science). Bible is integrated into every class which is amazingly nice! I love the community here because everyone is so nice and friendly.\n\nArizona Christian is a University that truly wants to see you succeed. Every professor, coach, and leader at ACU, has one goal in mind, and that is to see their students succeed beyond the classroom. Almost every day you would have someone who works at ACU ask you how your experience is, and how they can help you. On top of that, they truly care about you as a person. ACU has two chapel services a week, so not only are they concerned with you success in life, they are also concerned with you spiritual life. They are constantly praying for you, and continually sharing the good news of Jesus with us.\n\nIf I did have to change one thing, it would be the way athletic staff handles their coaches, and information. Too many times were we promised things as athletes, that just never came true.\n\nThe faculty has been incredible. If I have any questions everyone is so happy to assist and guide me in the right direction. Classes and scheduling is straight forward. I am so glad I made the decision to go back to school and I couldn’t be happier with the school I’ve selected to help with that journey.\n\nArizona Christian University is a great place for any students looking for an authentic christian environment. This campus will without a doubt, bring you closer to God. Additionally, its smaller student population allows you to form deeper connections with your peers and your professors. The quality of the curriculum and the professors is definitely this schools best feature. However, ACU is lacking in its presentation. The campus often looks like a construction zone. Likewise the property and facility has not been updated in decades. Similarly, there is very little upkeep in the dorms and the maintenance crew does not do a good job of assessing issues.\n\nI was very excited to transfer to ACU but was extremely disappointed. I have never experienced such an unwelcoming environment. The classes were fine- easy even. The food was absolutely disgusting. The dorms were awful. The social life sucked. I did not enjoy my time at all and left after my first year. The campus is so small and it feels like a small highschool.\n\nFor my first time away from home, I found the college experience in general to be very beneficial. The professors genuinely care about you and are very understanding. However, there are some glaring problems. The academics are not remotely rigorous. When I attended I was able to take 21 credit hours per semester and work 30 hours every week on overnight shift. I barely studied and still graduated magna cum laude. If you’re looking for an intellectual challenge, ACU will not provide that, which is a pity considering the next problem: the cost of tuition is exorbitant. It’s simply not worth 30k per year to not be challenged in the classroom. Another growing problem is how political the school has become. It’s less about Jesus than conforming to GOP ideals. There are professors who will inspire you to be like Jesus and that’s highly valuable. But you’d likely get more out of that in a formal seminary.\n\nArizona Christian University is courageously Christian. All of the instructors are open to teaching you so much and helping you understand. They ask how they can pray for you after a lot of the classes. The campus is relatively small and there are lots of lounges where you can just hang out. The food is pretty good and they serve Chick-fil-a sometimes. They put on a lot of activities so you can get involved and get to know people. They have chapel 2 times a week and put on a lot of bible studies. ACU is an amazing school and I highly recommend it!"
