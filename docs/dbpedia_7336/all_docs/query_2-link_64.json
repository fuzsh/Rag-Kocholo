        "text": "Central Glendale's old Thunderbird School of Global Management campus next year will get a new tenant with some 800 students, Arizona Christian University.\n\nThe private university made the announcement Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Thunderbird school, which became a part of Arizona State University in 2014, moved to downtown Phoenix this year, leaving behind the 140-acre campus in the middle of Glendale that it had called home for 71 years.\n\nArizona Christian cut a land deal with ASU — it gave ASU its current campus on Cactus Road near 24th Street in exchange for a portion of the Thunderbird campus on 59th Avenue and Greenway Road.\n\nArizona Christian, which has twice the number of students as Thunderbird had, will get 68 acres of the Glendale campus. ASU will retain the vacant lot on site.\n\nASU President Michael Crow called it the “best possible outcome” for the campus, while Arizona Christian President Len Munsil called it a \"win-win-win transaction.\"\n\nASU officials say it has not yet decided how the old ACU will be used. A spokesman said the university is looking into its options, including selling the land to re-invest in the downtown Thunderbird building.\n\nMove allows Arizona Christian to expand\n\nArizona Christian had been evaluating options for a new campus that would offer improved academic and sports facilities and more space for classrooms and on-campus housing, Arizona Christian said in a written statement.\n\nArizona Christian was founded in 1960 as Southwestern Conservative Bible College, but changed its name in 2011 to reflect its evolution from a small Bible college to a Christian liberal arts university. Munsil, the private university’s president, was also the Republican nominee for governor in 2006.\n\nThe school will be able to house about 500 students on the new campus.\n\nMunsil said the university will determine in a master plan whether any buildings need renovations.\n\nGlendale: 'Answer to my prayers'\n\nGlendale Mayor Jerry Weiers called the announcement an \"answer to my prayers.\"\n\nThe Thunderbird campus opened in Glendale in 1946 after initially serving as a training field for WWII pilots.\n\nThe campus is surrounded by neighborhoods and some residents were concerned by what would take the place of Thunderbird.\n\nGary Livingston lives near the campus and said he is happy a university is moving in, although he still has some concerns.\n\nASU hasn't announced what it will do with the vacant lot on site, and Livingston is concerned that more students will congest traffic.\n\n\"I love the idea that Arizona Christian University is going to move in there,\" he said. \"The next big worry will be the traffic.\"\n\nReach reporter Joshua Bowling at jbowling@azcentral.com or 602-444-8138.
