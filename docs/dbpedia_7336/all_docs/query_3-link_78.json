        "text": "Christian university in Phoenix, Arizona, US\n\nGrand Canyon University (GCU) is a private for-profit Christian university in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThe university offers degrees in over 200 areas of study and is administratively divided into 9 colleges.[7] As of September 2023, more than 100,000 students were enrolled online and in person, making it one of the largest Christian universities by enrollment.[4][8]\n\nThe Arizona Southern Baptist Convention established the institution in 1949 as Grand Canyon College.[9] In 1999â€“2000, the university ended its affiliation with the Southern Baptist Convention.[10]\n\nThe university competes as the Grand Canyon Antelopes in NCAA Division I athletics as a member of the Western Athletic Conference.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFounding\n\n[edit]\n\nGrand Canyon College was founded as a nonprofit institution in 1949 in Prescott, Arizona. Southern Baptists felt the need to establish a faith-based institution that would allow local Baptists to obtain a bachelor's or master's degree without going east to a Baptist college in Texas or Oklahoma.\n\nOn October 8, 1951, Grand Canyon College relocated to its current location in Phoenix.[11]\n\nIn 1984, the college's trustees voted to transition the college to a university for the school's 40th anniversary in 1989, becoming Grand Canyon University. At this time, it also changed governance from the Southern Baptist Convention to the GCU Board of Trustees.[11]\n\nFor-profit restructuring\n\n[edit]\n\nSuffering financial and other difficulties in the early 21st century, the school's trustees authorized its sale in 2004 to California-based Significant Education, LLC,[12] making it the first for-profit Christian college in the United States.[13] Significant Education was a subsidiary of education entrepreneur Michael K. Clifford's company.[12] Clifford became managing director of the privatized institution, with the former board of trustees serving in an advisory role.[12] Significant Education became a corporation in 2005, publicly traded under the name Grand Canyon Education, Inc in 2008.[14] GCE trades on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol \"LOPE\".[14][15]\n\nAfter the infusion of capital, Grand Canyon University's size increased. After having fewer than 1,000 students enrolled in 2008, the university had 17,500 students in the spring of 2017.[16] A 2015 economic impact study revealed that the university was adding about $1 billion into the state's economy each year during its expansion.[17] In February 2017, then Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said that the neighborhoods surrounding the university had experienced a 30% increase in housing values and a 30% decrease in crime rates.[18]\n\nBy 2014, GCU students' accumulated student loan debt was estimated at more than $5.9 billion.[19]\n\nDue to GCU's for-profit status (and various other reasons), Arizona State University had refused to play against GCU in any sport, even though both are NCAA Division I schools and only 16 miles (26 km) apart.[20][21][additional citation(s) needed] ASU eventually reversed its position, and sporting events between the two universities recommenced in 2020.[22]\n\nAttempts to return to nonprofit status\n\n[edit]\n\nIn fall 2014, the college announced the exploration of a return to nonprofit status.[23] GCU's regional accreditation body, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), rejected the university's petition for conversion to nonprofit status in 2016, saying that the school's proposed strategy, particularly its plan to outsource some of its activities (such as curriculum development and student support services) to outside vendors, did not meet the criteria for such a conversion.[23][24][25] In 2018, GCU submitted another application to HLC to change to nonprofit status.[26] This application was accepted on July 1, 2018.[27][28] Although some organizations have approved this transition, the U.S. Department of Education still classifies the university as a for-profit university. The government specifically says that GCU is a captive client to Grand Canyon Education and operating for the benefit of a for-profit company's shareholders.[29] Grand Canyon Education has also been accused of engaging in securities-law fraud with its relation to GCU.[30][31]\n\nGrand Canyon University was alleged to have switched from for-profit to nonprofit status due to its yearly $9.2 million property tax bill. Numerous school officials said this was unsustainable and a key reason the switch was made.[20] Some critics of for-profit education criticized the relationship between GCU and GCE as too intertwined.[32][33]\n\nIn 2021, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by GCU that claimed the university didn't receive all the coronavirus relief funds to which it was entitled because it was a nonprofit entity.[34] The same year, GCU sued the U.S. Department of Education after being denied nonprofit status twice.[35] The suit was dismissed in 2022 after a federal judge rejected the university's claims.[36]\n\nIn October 2023, a GCU press release alleged that there was a concerted effort by the U.S. Department of Education, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Veterans Affairs to punish the school for attempting to gain nonprofit status.[37][38]\n\nRegulatory sanctions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, the federal government sued GCU for paying enrollment counselors according to how many students they had enrolled while at the same time accepting federal financial aid, a violation of the Department of Education's incentive compensation ban. GCU reached a settlement in the case, and was forced to pay a $5.2 million fine to a former employee and the government.[39]\n\nIn 2023 the Department of Education fined the company $37.7 million for deceiving students about the cost of doctoral degrees. The department alleged that 78% of students graduating in those programs paid about 25% more than the cost that GCU represented, with much of the extra charges accumulating from additional \"continuation classes\" for completing the dissertation requirement. Only 2% paid the represented cost. The school disputed the allegation, claiming in addition that it provides more information than is legally required. GCU is the largest recipient of federal student aid. In addition to the fine, the department imposed conditions on the school to continue participating in the federal student aid programs.[40][41]\n\nAlso in 2023, the Federal Trade Commission filed a federal lawsuit alleging that GCU deceived prospective doctoral students about the cost of its program and its for-profit status. The suit asserted that GCU paid 60% of its revenues to the for-profit Grand Canyon Education company and was the company's most significant source of revenue. The university and company had the same CEO.[42]\n\nCampuses\n\n[edit]\n\nMain campus in Phoenix\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2006, the college spent $150 million to renovate the campus, adding a brick promenade, an aquatics center, and a cafÃ©.[43]\n\nIn 2009, GCU began work on a $60 million campus expansion project, including a 500-bed dormitory, a 55,000-square-foot (5,100 m2) fitness and recreation center, 125-classroom facility, food court and bowling alley,[44] and a 5,000-seat arena. The GCU Arena, which opened on September 2, 2011,[45] is used for concerts, speakers, and other events. The arena is also home to the college's men's and women's basketball teams and women's volleyball games.[46] The arena was expanded to 7,000 seats in 2014.[47][48] GCU offers several fast food restaurants, coffee shops, student union, cafeteria, video game room, and six-lane bowling alley for student recreation.[49] In August 2016, the university announced the establishment of the GCU Police Department [50]\n\nIn August 2016, GCU announced its 10 in 2 initiative, the building of 10 on-campus athletic facilities in a two-year span. Highlights of the project included new facilities for the university's soccer, baseball, softball, tennis and beach volleyball programs. It also included a sports medicine expansion, an equipment room expansion, practice facilities for the basketball and golf programs, and a student-athlete academic center.[51]\n\nAccelerated Nursing (ABSN) learning sites\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2020, the university opened its first two ABSN locations, in Sun City and Tucson.[52]\n\nOn May 9, 2022, GCU opened an ABSN location in Sandy, Utah.[53]\n\nOn September 7, 2023, GCU announced the opening of its 5th ABSN location in Chandler, Arizona.[52][54]\n\nGCU's 4th ABSN location is in Henderson, Nevada.[52]\n\nGCU opened its 6th ABSN location, in Phoenix's West Valley, with a grand opening ceremony on September 18, 2023.[52]\n\nAnother ABSN satellite campus is in Meridian, Idaho.[55]\n\nThe 8th most recently opened ABSN location is in St. Louis, Missouri.[55]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nGrand Canyon University offers over 200 bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs through its 10 colleges.[7]\n\nColangelo College of Business\n\nCollege of Doctoral Studies\n\nCollege of Education\n\nCollege of Engineering, and Technology\n\nCollege of Arts and Media\n\nCollege of Humanities and Social Sciences\n\nCollege of Nursing and Health Care Professions\n\nCollege of Natural Sciences\n\nCollege of Theology\n\nHonors College\n\nIn August 2016, the university announced that it was opening a seminary.[56]\n\nIn April 2017, Arizona nursing board officials censured GCU after the school's nursing programs fell below 80% graduation rate for two consecutive years. GCU said it would implement a plan to increase graduation rates.[57] Three months later, the nursing board announced it was pleased with the \"tremendous improvements\" the university had shown to addressing all concerns.[58] In 2018, the Arizona State Board of Nursing censured GCU's nursing program due to the number of first-time students failing to pass the registered nursing exam and after numerous complaints by students and faculty.[59] In the second quarter of 2018, GCU nursing students posted a 95.65% first-time pass rate on the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX). This leads to a year-to-date rate of 92.86%, higher than the Arizona Board of Nursing's year-to-date statewide average of 91.89%.[60]\n\nGrand Canyon University's undergraduate entrance requirements are either a 3.0 high school GPA, or a high school GPA of 2.5 with either an SAT score of 1,000 or ACT score of 19.[61] In 2021, the university acceptance rate was 76.9%; of those admitted, 23% enrolled. The university does not report scores of matriculating students, while high school class rank, high school college preparatory classes, and letters of recommendation are neither required nor recommended.[citation needed]\n\nAthletics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Grand Canyon Antelopes\n\nGCU Roller Hockey\n\nGCU Roller Hockey's inaugural season took place during 2022-2023. The team and program were established by Aydin Schwetz in the summer of 2022.[62]\n\nGCU Roller Hockey is a member of the NCRHA Division 1, with the majority of their games played in the Western Collegiate Roller Hockey League.[63] The on-campus roller hockey rink at Grand Canyon University was fully funded by the NHL Arizona Coyotes.[64]\n\nChampionship Victory\n\nIn only its second season (2023-2024), the GCU Lopes emerged as the NCRHA Division 1 Champions. They triumphed over the undefeated Lindenwood Lions with a 2-1 victory in triple-overtime.[65] The championship game was held on April 20, 2024, at the Norway Savings Bank Arena in Auburn, Maine.\n\nOther Sports\n\nMen's volleyball competes in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and beach volleyball competes independently.[citation needed]\n\nRankings, recognition, statistics, and accreditation\n\n[edit]\n\nAcademic rankingsNationalU.S. News & World Report[66]299â€“391Washington Monthly[67]309\n\nGrand Canyon University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). According to the HLC, Grand Canyon College entered candidacy for accreditation in 1961. By 1968 the school was regionally accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, HLC's predecessor, and remains accredited, successfully renewing its 10-year comprehensive evaluation in 2017.[68] GCU colleges and programs also holds additional accreditations from the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP), the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), the Arizona State Board of Educations, and the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). The university teachers and administrator preparation programs are approved by the Arizona Department of Education.[69]\n\nIn 2021, the university acceptance rate was 76.9%, and, of those admitted, 23% enrolled.[70] The freshman retention rate was 61%.[71] U.S. News & World Report classifies the university among \"National Universities\", wherein it was classified in the 2022 Best Colleges as a Tier 2 institution (meaning it is placed in the bottom 25 percent of institutions in its ranking category).[71]\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nAnthony Birchak, wrestler and mixed martial artist\n\nHenry Cejudo, mixed martial artist\n\nBill Engvall, comedian\n\nEfrain Escudero, wrestler and mixed martial artist\n\nBayard Forrest, professional basketball player\n\nGrandy Glaze, professional basketball player\n\nSteve Green, musician\n\nNiki Jackson, Major League Soccer player\n\nKillian Larson, professional basketball player\n\nHoracio Llamas, professional basketball player\n\nRandy McCament, professional baseball player\n\nJosh McDermitt, actor and comedian\n\nMoriah Peters, musician\n\nCody Ransom, professional baseball player\n\nTim Salmon, professional baseball player\n\nRandy Soderman, professional soccer player\n\nRachel Mitchell, attorney\n\nQuentin Stanerson, member of the Iowa House of Representatives\n\nDavid Stapleton, professional baseball player\n\nKevin Warren, professional football executive and college athletics commissioner[72][73]\n\nChristine Weidinger, operatic soprano\n\nJames White, theologian and minister\n\nJacob Wilson, professional baseball player"
