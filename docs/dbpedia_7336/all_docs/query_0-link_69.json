Other sources of grant aid are excluded. Aid awarded anytime during the full aid year is included.\n\nAverage net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance. Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees (lower of in-district or in-state), books and supplies and the weighted average room and board and other expenses.\n\n$21,374\n\nCalculate your net cost\n\nAverage Net Price By Family Income\n\nIncome\n\nAverage Amount\n\n< $30k\n\n$23,151\n\n$30k - $48k\n\n$24,514\n\n$48k - $75k\n\n$22,595\n\n$75k - $110k\n\n$24,145\n\n$110k+\n\n$24,291\n\nTuition\n\nIn-State Tuition In-state tuition is the tuition charged by institutions to those students who meet the state's or institution's residency requirements.

The housing on campus is well-organized and fit for the comfort of the students. The quality of education is also worth the cost of attending the school. The food in the cafeteria is of decent quality and is always prepared clean and tidy. Included in the fees are activity fees, which allow the student to attend any of the sporting events, banquets, and other events planned out by Student Leadership. Overall, the price is worth paying for if you are looking to establish longtime relationships and grow deeper in your walk with God as a college student.\n\nMatthew from Peoria, AZ\n\nSouthwestern College is inexpensive for a private school. There are also many scholarship opportunities. So even though it is definitely worth the full price, many people end up getting scholarships. You definitely get what you pay for here. The campus is awesome, the professors are amazing, and the students are some of the nicest people you will ever meet.\n\nBrianne from Prescott, AZ\n\nMy first day of an education class at Arizona Christian University, the enthusiastic professor began explaining how a P90X move can be applied to teaching children. He went on to describe that psychology is the â??power behind the educationâ??. He continued to show this â??power behind the educationâ?? so much that I still remember it today. I share this story with you as just one example of how the education professors as ACU inspire their students to develop a passion for teaching that will last for decades.\n\nMariah from Phoenix, AZ\n\nNot only are you getting a great education, but you're also receiving a great student life experience. The small size means a closer learning experience with instructors. ACU is fun, educating, and caring.\n\nKati from Surprise, AZ\n\nthis is the most genuine and worthwhile christian colleges i have ever even looked into let alone attended. the staff really practices what they preach, and so do the staff and everybody involved strive for academic as well as christian-living excellence. anybody working there will bend over backwards to help you out and always goes above and beyond. they are working on building themselves up to be a prestigious university and are already well into the process of doing so.\n\nNicholas from Peroia, AZ\n\nSimilar Colleges\n\nStanford, CA\n\nTempe, AZ\n\nTucson, AZ\n\nGlendale, AZ\n\nFlagstaff, AZ\n\nAzusa, CA\n\nLa Mirada, CA\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nMalibu, CA\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\nLakewood, CO\n\nNew York, NY\n\nSee All"
