        "text": "Â\n\nÂ Â\n\nArizona Christian University begins first school year in Glendale - With President Len Munsil -- By CAROLYN DRYER -Â Contributing Writer- Glendale Daily Planet\n\nÂ\n\nArizona Christian University (ACU) begins its first year of classes on a new 70-acre campus in Glendale.Â Founded in 1960, ACU is an accredited non-denominational Christian liberal arts university ranked #1 University in Arizona by College Consensus and one of the Best Regional Colleges in the West for the second year in a row by U.S. News and World Report. Â An agreement last year with Arizona State University (ASU) enabled ACU to move from its smaller campus on East Cactus Road to the Glendale site at Â Â 59th Avenue and Greenway Road.\n\nÂ\n\nLen Munsil, who has served as President of ACU for the past eight years, brought Glendale Rotary Club members up to date Aug. 1 on the universityâs status, expected enrollment for the coming academic year and its plans for the future. All athletes and student leaders arrived on campus July 31. The football team will play at Cactus High School â less than a mile from campus - this year.\n\nThe school competes in athletics at the NAIA level, and its degree programs include behavioral health, family studies, psychology, business administration, communication, criminal justice, health care policy, nonprofit management, coaching and early childhood education. Each student who graduates with a four-year degree will also hold a minor in biblical studies.\n\n\"Many of our universities started with Christian basics,â Munsil said. \"We recognize thereâs a battle of ideas now.â\n\nHe said ACU is committed to defending the principles of Christianity and the country.\n\nThose principles guided Munsil throughout his college, business and political career. As a college student, he was the editor of ASUâs State Press newspaper.Â He earned his law degree at ASU, became an award-winning journalist, educator and a public policy expert. Munsil was founding President and General Counsel for The Center for Arizona Policy, a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy organization.Â\n\nMunsil was an adjunct professor and taught a course in Christian ethics at ACU, and was voted to the ACU Board of Trustees.\n\nIn 2015, Munsil authored the book, \"Transforming Culture with Truth,â which is the ACU motto.\n\nSince 2010, under Munsilâs leadership, ACU has increased its course offerings, fundraising and enrollment. This yearâs enrollment is expected to be 900 to 1,000; the ultimate goal is 1,200 traditional students, Munsil said.\n\n\"We donât ever want 20,000 to 30,000 students,â he said. \"The small college experience is an opportunity to invest in students deeply.â\n\nThe investment is worth it, according to Munsil. He said ACU student athletes are in the top 5 percent of grade point averages nationwide.\n\nThere are other points of pride in Munsilâs inner circle. His wife, Tracy, is Associate Professor of Political Science and chair of the General Education Department at ACU; the Munsils are parents of eight children and four grandchildren. All of their children have earned college degrees with high academic success.\n\nTo learn more about ACU, visit arizonachristian.edu.\n\nÂ"
