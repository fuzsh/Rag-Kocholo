        "text": "The French Valois: Henri III (1574-89)\n\nFigure 1.-- This is another Clouet royal portrait. It is the future Henry III as a young man of about 18 or 19 years of age. It was probably painted about 1570. Henry III, the youngest of the three brothers who became king. He was Catherine de Medici's favorite son.\n\nHenry III was the youngest of the three brothers, sons of King Henri II and Queen Catherine de Medici. He was Catherine's favorite son. Henri was born in Fontainebleau during 1551. As a child he was awarded the title Duc d'Anjou. He participated in the military campaign against the Huguenots and played a role in the victories at Jarnac and Moncontour (1569). He conspired with his mother to stage the St. Bartholomew Day Massacre (1572). He was subsequently elected King of Poland (1573), but returned to France on the death if his brother Charles to become king of France (1574). The War of Religion persisted during his reign. After the St. Bartholomew Day Massacre little compromise was possible or could credence be given to any assurances from the Crown. The kings brother the Duc d'Alençon joined the Huguenots and after much fighting, Henri was compeled to reach a peace with the Huguenots--the Peace of Beaulieu (1576). This conferred privilges to the Huguenots and was confirmed by edict of Bergerac (1577). Henri was the last of the Valois. He attempted for sveral years to prevent the succession of Henry of Navarre because he was a Protestant. On his death he was succeeded by Henry and the new Bourbon dynasty-- another branch of the Capetians.\n\nParents\n\nPrince Henry was the son of King Henri II and Queen Catherine de Medici. He was Catherine's favorite son.\n\nSiblings\n\nHenry III was the youngest of the three brothers who became king. Older brothers François II and Charles IX also were French kings.\n\nChildhood\n\nHenri was born in Fontainebleau during 1551. As a child he was awarded the title Duc d'Anjou.\n\nFrench Protestant Reformation\n\nThe French monarchy had a special relationship with the Church. French kings had generally avoided the kind of open split with the papacy like the Investiture Controversy that so divided Germany. The Pope gave the kings of France the title of \"Most Christian King.\" Each French King took an oath to \"extirpate\" heresy in his realm. The French Church despite the close relationship between th moinarch an papacy had evolved considerable independence from the papacy. The French monarchy had perhaps more authority over the Church in his country than any other prince in Western Christendom. This was further recognized on the eve of the Reformation by the Concordat of Bologna which confirmed Francis I's authority to make appointments to benefices. As a result, many of the conditions which led to the Reformation in Germany were less apparent than in Germany. The Concordot provided for the rights of both pope and king, but made the king clearly dominant over the French Church. While religious issues are most commonly discussed in connection with the Feformation, financial matters were a major concern at the time. The monarchy in France had enormous control over the disposition of the wealth and income of the French Church and routinely used the authority to appoint bishops, abbots, and other church officers to reward faithful followers because there was considerable income associated with many of these offices. As a result, the princes of the French Church included many worldly people, often uninterestred in spiritual or doctrinal matters, but often quite nationalistic. The Pope had a veto on such appointments, but out of defference to the monarch, rarely exercized it. Thus there was a considerable fusion of church and state in France very different than the situation in Germany. The University of Paris (the Sorbonne) during the late Medieval era served as a kind of scholastic think-tank for both Church and state.\n\nMilitary Campaigns\n\nThe last Valois monarchs were primarily involved in the French Wars of Religion. Henry was intent on supressing the Huguenots (French Protestants). He participated in the military campaign against the Huguenots and played a role in the victories at Jarnac and Moncontour (1569).\n\nSt. Bartholomew Day Massacre (1572)\n\nHe conspired with his mother to stage the St. Bartholomew Day Massacre (1572). The most nortable attrocity of the civil wars was the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. Catherine and her son Charles IX signed a peace traety with the Huguenots granting freedom of worship (1570). They made a point of maintining friendly relations with Huguenot leaders, often calling de Coligny to court to seek his advise. Lulled into a sence of security, they were totally unprepared for what transpired. Catherine and Charles ordered a masacre of Huguenots in Paris and other French cities. The Duc de Guise personally killed Coligny.\n\nPoland\n\nHenri was subsequently elected King of Poland (1573).\n\nFrench Throne\n\nHenri returned to France on the death if his brother Charles to become king of France (1574).\n\nWars of Religion\n\nThe War of Religion persisted during his reign. After the St. Bartholomew Day Massacre little compromise was possible or could credence be given to any assurances from the Crown. The kings brother the Duc d'Alençon joined the Huguenots and after much fighting, Henri was compeled to reach a peace with the Huguenots--the Peace of Beaulieu (1576). This conferred privilges to the Huguenots and was confirmed by edict of Bergerac (1577). The Catholic party was unhappy with the privliges granted to the Huguenots by the Peace of Beaulieu. Henri I de Lorraine, Duc de Guise, formed the Holy League and renewed the War (1579-80). After a lull in the fighting, the death of the Duc d'Anjou led to renwed conflict. The Duke was the last surviving son of Henry II. This meant the next in sucession was Henry of Navarre--a Huguenot. The Catholic party was determined to prevent the sucession of a Protestant. Henry III proceeded to bar Henry of Navarre from the sucession and gradually revoke the privliges granted the Huguenots under the the Peace of Beaulieu. In reaction, Henry of Navarre began the War of the Three Henries against the Holy League. By the end of the War (1587), King Henry's power was rivaled by the military power of the Duc de Guise. The Duke instigated a rising in Paris known as the Day of Barricades (1588). The Paris mobs revolted aginst King Henry and demanded his replacement with the Duc de Guise. Catholic leaders allowed King Henry to escape Paris. Afterwards King Henry had the Duc de Guise and his brother the Cardinal de Lorraine executed. This turned the Catholic party in France aginst King Henry. As a result, King Henry put himself under the protection of Henry of Navarre whom he then declared to be his legal successor. King Henry and Henry of Nvarre became the joint coimmanders of Huguenot army.\n\nFamily\n\nHenri married Louise of Lorraine de Vaudémont (1553-1601) in 1575. Her father was Count Nicola de Lorraine. There were no children leaving Henry without an heir.\n\nSuccession\n\nHenri was the last of the Valois. He attempted to prevent the succession of Henry of Navarre because he was a Protestant, but later joined with Henry and approved of his succession after alienating the Catholic party. While wuthbthe army moving toward Paris, King Henry was attacked by a fanatical monk and died the next day (1589). On his death he was succeeded by Henry and the new Bourbon dynasty-- another branch of the Capetians.\n\nHBRC\n\nNavigate the Boys' Historical Clothing Web Site royal pages:\n\n[Return to the Main French Valois royal pages]\n\n[Return to the Main royal pages]\n\n[Austria] [Belgium] [Denmark] [France] [Germany] [German states] [Italy] [Luxembourg]\n\n[Monaco] [Netherlands] [Norway] [Romania] [Russia] [Spain] [United Kingdom]\n\nCreated: May 20, 2004\n\nLast updated: May 20, 2004"
