        "text": "Description\n\nLouise of Lorraine (French: Louise de Lorraine) (30 April 1553 – 29 January 1601) was a member of the House of Lorraine who was Queen consort of France from 1575 until 1589. Born in Nomeny in the Duchy of Bar, she was the daughter of Nicholas of Lorraine, Duke of Mercœur, and Countess Marguerite d'Egmont.\n\nShe first caught the eye of her future husband, Henri of France, Duke of Anjou, in 1574. Recently elected King of Poland, he caught sight of Louise whilst he visiting relatives. Henry was attracted to Louise, who was not only attractive, and sweet-natured, but who also resembled the Princess of Condé, Marie de Clèves, with whom Henry III was infatuated.\n\nHenry had intended to marry Marie of Cleves, but she died and after a period of mourning, he married Louise 15 February 1575. There were no children.\n\nLouise of Lorraine in Wikipedia\n\nThis is a general description. It is not a review."
