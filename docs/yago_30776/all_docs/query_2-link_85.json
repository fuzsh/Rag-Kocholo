        "text": "Philippe I d’Orleans is not a widely remembered Prince, having lived and died outshined by his brother Louis XIV, the Sun King. For the most part, this is how French society wanted it; the previous brother of the king was a participant in a revolt that destabilized the position of the monarchy and jeopardized the life of the Dauphin. But Philippe lived a fascinating life, trying to balance the status and exemptions of being a member of the royal family with the shackles of subservience and latent fear of another Fronde. He was loyal throughout his life to his great love, who was neither of his two wives but in fact a man, during a time where French morality was controlled by the Catholic Church. He was labeled effeminate and silly at Louis’s court, and yet embraced and thrived in the hyper-masculine role of military commander. He had very little political power and was twice used as a pawn in marriage alliances, but his son became the king regent. While Philippe had much more freedom than those of lower rank in terms of his social behaviors, such as his relationship with the Chevalier de Lorraine and his other homosexual affairs, he was not given any political, financial, or social choice. This is because after the Fronde, the role of the king’s brother was feared as a source of political instability and rivalry to the king. Philippe was groomed from a young age to be deferential to the point of effeminacy, but it was that aspect of his personality through which he exploited his privilege as a fils-de-france.\n\nEvil Gastons: Not Just Disney\n\nThe circumstances that led to the contradictory nature of Philippe’s life occurred when he was a young child of eight. These wars occurred between about 1648 and 1653, five years after the death of Louis XIII. This rebellion represented the final threat against the monarchy, but importantly, was a frightening, difficult time in Louis XIV’s formative years. Not only were the rebellions defeated, but they shaped and built a king who would not accept anything less than complete power. The Fronde was a combination of a multitude of different conspiracies, revolts, and conflicts, all of which took advantage of a weak monarchy. King Louis XIII had passed away in 1643, but Louis XIV was still a child of ten at the start of the conflicts, in no way ready to rule. The kingdom was therefore in the hands of the regent Anne of Austria, the wife of Louis XIII and the two boys’ mother, and her advisor and Chief Minister, Cardinal Mazarin.\n\nThere were, in reality, two Frondes: the Fronde of the parlement and the Fronde of the princes (Treasure 2001). The French parlement was a judicial body, and they became enraged when the crown attempted to levy more taxes against them in order to pay wartime expenses. This rebellion was a constitutional one, as the parlement, which was a collection of nobles, attempted to limit the king’s power. This rebellion, although not free of bloodshed, was suppressed with the help of the prince of Condé and the parlementaires were brought back under French rule. However, it was the second Fronde, the Fronde of the Princes, that rattled the monarchy politically. While there were many higher ranking nobles who joined on the side of the rebellion, the frondeur who most impacted Philippe’s life was Gaston, the brother of Louis XIII. Gaston was not an especially important player in the rebellion, but it showed the dangers of a strong, charismatic fils-de-France who did not support the royal line. His rebellion produced an anxiety and fear in Anne, Mazarin, and Louis that guided how they treated Philippe throughout his life. This led to a life of humiliation, subjugation, and feminization for Philippe that contrasted with the social freedoms he enjoyed as a fils de France.\n\nThe Less Favored Child\n\nThe person with the most influence on both Louis’s and Philippe’s upbringing was their mother. Anne and Louis XIII had a very difficult marriage; he was rumored to prefer men, she had scandal and conspiracy follow her. In these ways, their marriage was almost a foreshadow for the marriage of Henriette Anne and Philippe. Louis XIV, who was not born until 18 years after the marriage of the two royals, saved Anne and solidified her reputation. The birth of Philippe two years later made her position stronger, and motherhood gave her a purpose beyond her piety and frivolous pursuits, which was how she spent her time in her earlier years as the queen of France (Treasure 2001). According to the memoirs of Madame de Motteville, a close confidante of Anne, the king was even more excited when Philippe was born than when Louis was, because he had never anticipated being the father of two children (1902). Even during the final years of Louis XIII’s reign, she had a far more direct role in the children’s life than most royal mothers, especially Louis XIII’s own mother. She was thoroughly devoted to her children, and her ideas about their roles and relationship followed them throughout their lives.\n\nDuring the regency, Anne’s preference for Louis became even more evident. She and her advisor, Cardinal Mazarin, the children’s godfather, made some deliberate choices that deeply affected the relationship of the boys. Some of it was simply a result of duty, as she was simultaneously trying to raise two children and stabilize a fragile monarchy. But it is to be expected that Louis, who saved her from the shame of queens who do not have sons, would hold a special place in her heart. That being said, Philippe’s upbringing and education forever cemented his place of submission to his brother. There is historical debate about whether Anne purposely dressed Philippe in girl’s clothing as a child or whether this was normal for a young child, but she occasionally referred to Philippe as her daughter (Barker 1989). When Philippe was sick as a child, she was mildly alarmed but went about her life. “Monsieur fell ill with a continued fever and great pain in the loins… the queen was not uneasy (de Motteville, 1902, p. 340).” When Louis was sick, she was devastated and held celebrations when he returned to health. “The queen… told us… that had she lost the king, she could not have survived him (de Motteville, 1902, p. 214).” There was simply no place in Anne’s parenting for Philippe to grow up to be a rival to Louis, as the Fronde and Louis XIII’s own brother, Gaston’s, rebellion was happening before her very eyes. She did everything she could to prevent that discord, always at Philippe’s expense.\n\nPhilippe’s informal education reflected much of the same neglect and sense of afterthought that his upbringing did. Motteville described Philippe as having “intelligence from the time he could talk,” saying that “the clearness of his thoughts was accompanied by two fine inclinations… namely, liberality and humanity (1902, p. 199).” However, his educators were not appointed until he was nine, and his education began even later, owing to the instability of the Fronde. In addition, both of Philippe’s primary educators, selected by Mazarin, were rejected when Mazarin was selecting the king’s tutors (Barker 1989). Mazarin allowed Philippe’s education to be neglected where he pushed Louis forward, and as an adolescent he was allowed to indulge in “the idle amusements allowed him in his youth… to be with women and girls, to dress them and arrange their hair (de Motteville 1902, p. 199)” instead of focusing on his studies as the king was doing. The fear of the power of the king’s brother was so strong in the face of the Fronde that Philippe was allowed and even encouraged to develop into someone who court historian Saint-Simon described as “soft of mind and body (de Rouvroy 2006)” and “a round bellied little man… always decked out like a woman (de Rouvroy 2006).”\n\nFinancial Stranglehold\n\nWhen Mazarin, who had never been as close with Philippe as he was with Louis, died in 1661, it seemed as though Philippe might gain the freedom and dignity he had never had as a child, but this was not to be. Louis married Maria Theresa of Spain in 1660, starting his own household and officially took over his governance of the country upon Mazarin’s death. Louis did his best to make sure Philippe was wholly and completely dependent on the crown for his finances. Philippe, between 1661 and 1693, received 1,215,000 livres from the French crown (Barker 1983).\n\nIt was the passing, though, of Gaston d’Orleans, Louis and Philippe’s uncle, that truly showed how tight of a grip Louis wanted to keep on his brother. Gaston died with only a female heir, who could not receive his title, appanage, or governorship. As his closest male relative who was not the king, Philippe expected to receive much of the inheritance from the disgrace prince’s estate (Barker 1983). Philippe immediately assumed the title of the duke of Orleans without much question or debate. But the appanage and the governorship were entirely a different story. Philippe was not awarded this governorship, nor any other one throughout Louis’s reign. While these positions no longer held the clout they once did, the fear of the second son reared its head again. For this position could be used to extort money from the province, and even in extreme cases gather men willing to serve in personal armies. Philippe was luckier with the appanage, but only slightly. Although the appanage would still be a small fraction of what Philippe was receiving from the crown, it would be a small representation of financial freedom for Philippe, money he did not have to rely on his brother’s generosity for. While Louis eventually granted Philippe the appanage, he did reduce its value slightly. In addition, he did not allow Philippe to inherit the appanage until he was married.\n\nThe Madames\n\nPhilippe’s two marriages best represent the ways that he was used as a pawn for the benefit of the crown. In many ways, his political role reflected the effeminacy that was both pushed on him by his mother and Mazarin and a large part of his personality. Philippe had no political power given to him by the king; no governorships, no cabinet position, just a social role at court. He was a member of the royal family with no real political power who was married off in the hopes of political alliance to someone he did not really want to marry in the hopes of assuring the future of the line should something happen to the king. This description sounds far more like the role of a princess than that of someone who is second in line to the throne, and in fact he was once described by Madame de Lafayette as “beau, bien fait, mais d’une beauté et d’une taille plus convenable à une princesse qu’à une prince (1882, p. 16).” And while it was true that the king’s first marriage was also purely diplomatic, Louis’s second marriage was the opposite. Madame de Maintenon was his illegitimate children’s governess, far below Louis in rank, chosen only by the king’s feelings and with no advantage of connections. By the time Philippe married his first wife, his homosexual tendencies, especially his relationship with the Comte de Guiche, were common knowledge at court (Barker 1989). But with the withholding of Gaston’s appanage, and at the insistence of Louis, Anne, and Mazarin, Philippe married Henriette Anne, sister of King Charles II of England and his own cousin. The disastrous nature of their marriage reflected how little choice Philippe had and how willing Louis was to use his already unhappy marriage to humiliate his brother.\n\nAt first glance, everything seemed to be going quite well for the young couple. Philippe at least pretended to have feelings for his bride-to-be, and the match was favorable for Henriette, who, as a princess, was very fortunate to be able to stay in the court she grew up in, with the same people she had known her whole life. Most princesses, like the unlucky Maria Theresa of Spain, were shipped off to countries to marry royal husbands they had never met in countries whose customs they did not understand, fashions they did not ascribe to, and languages they often did not speak. Henriette, although English by family and birth country, was a truly French princess. With the queen, Maria Theresa, being so reserved and unused to the French styles, Henriette was the true female icon of style, luxury, and court life in her time.\n\nBut the gilded façade of their marriage quickly chipped away as things started to go awry. This was visible even before the marriage; Philippe had grown up with Henriette and never showed any particular affection toward her, in fact sometimes even displayed hostility toward her, as did Louis (Barker 1989). They both viewed her and her mother as poor and powerless during the time of the Cromwell protectorate, but when Charles II regained the throne, they quickly changed their tune (Cartwright 1894). But even so, Philippe’s love was probably manufactured to speed up the marriage, so that he would finally inherit his appanage, his only source of financial independence from his restrictive brother. When they were married, Philippe took multiple lovers, usually male. He continued his relationship with the Comte de Guiche and started a relationship with the Chevalier de Lorraine after meeting him during the War of Devolution in 1668 (Barker 1989). Henriette was by no means the image of a perfect, docile wife that was idealized during this period. She was high strung and had delicate health, but was charming and lively in society. While the marriage was, for Philippe, just an extension of his subjugation to his brother, it was Henriette Anne’s first taste of freedom. Her mother was a strong, domineering parent, and kept Henriette closely guarded for much of her youth. She seduced multiple men just to show that she could, enraging Philippe’s jealous nature.\n\nWhen the new Monsieur and Madame were invited to attend the king at his court in Fontainbleau, the marriage broke irrevocably. Madame had turned her attentions to the ultimate prize, the one whose affections would incense and humiliate her husband the most: the king. The physical nature of their relationship is fiercely debated by historians, and court gossip did not serve to make them seem innocent. They at the very least had an emotional affair, spending far much more time together than was seen as appropriate; a pamphlet by noble at court Roger de Rabutin circulated at the time detailing Madam’s affairs said “I daily observered the King’s courtship to Madame, and with heavy regret, perceived she received it with joy (1660, p. 14).” Madame de Lafayette, who did not believe the affair had a physical component, admitted in her biography of Henriette, “il paroissoit que le roi n’y avoit de plaisir que par celui qu’elle en recevoit (1880, p. 43).” The relationship was only tempered when Henrietta Maria and Anne intervened to stop the actions of their children. Louis attempted to stem the gossip by pretending to take a different mistress, one of Henriette Anne’s ladies, Louise de la Valliere. Ironically, Louise ended up becoming his real mistress, supplanting his sister-in-law.\n\nIn the aftermath of the scandal with Louis, Henriette decided to take another lover, one that debased her husband even more than the first one did, if possible: the Comte de Guiche. The Comte de Guiche was notoriously one of Philippe’s first public homosexual affair, so Henriette’s seduction of him was the ultimate betrayal on both of their parts. In the same pamphlet by Rabutin-Bussy, a letter supposedly from the comte de Guiche to Henriette was published, saying, “It is you, Madame, that I love, and the description that I gave you yesterday is of yourself, which you could not know. If you think this confession too bold, you must blame your own curiosity (1660, p. 36-37).”\n\nDespite their multiple children and continuous parties, celebrations, and entertainments at their various residences throughout their marriage, Philippe and Henriette’s marriage never really improved. He leveraged the traditional power a husband had over his wife and household during this period, she leveraged her favor with the king and her brother Charles, which was essential at a time which France was trying desperately to negotiate an alliance with England in order to go to war with the Dutch. In their war of the wills, they both lost, being unhappy for the entirety of their marriage. And then suddenly, Henriette died.\n\nAlthough the prevailing theory at the time was that she had been poisoned, mostly because she claimed that she was poisoned as she was dying, this theory has been largely debunked. Henriette was sickly and frail her entire life, and even more so at the end. Dying of natural causes very young was not uncommon in that time period, as medicine was ill-informed and unhelpfully administered. In the days and weeks following her death, Philippe appeared the picture of a perfect mourning husband, and perhaps he was genuinely sad at the loss of his first wife. But their marriage was a prison for him, difficult, unhappy and often humiliating. Despite his grief, it seemed that he was free.\n\nBut Philippe was a young man, and Louis’s children were prone to dying prematurely. With only two daughters, it seemed to be a necessity that he would marry again in order to ensure the health of the French line of succession. The question of who was not so obvious as it was with Henriette, but Elizabeth Charlotte, princess of the Palatine, had an advocate at the French court in her aunt, and was ideally suited to the role because of her young age. She was a protestant, but this was remedied by her conversion upon arrival to France. Philippe married her only a year after the death of his first wife by proxy.\n\nThe union had a rocky start for both parties. Liselotte, as she was affectionately called, was devastated to leave her home country and come to France. Throughout her life she maintained her affection for all things German, never really adapting to French dress, mannerisms, or even food. Philippe had a very different objection. He was used to Henriette Anne, the definition of style, fashion, and liveliness at court, and his lovers, who were universally beautiful. Liselotte, on the other hand, was both self-described and antointed by others to be quite unattractive. In addition, she had no sense of French style and never attained it. Her marriage to Philippe was never one of love, but of duty.\n\nThat being said, their marriage was far more successful than that of Henriette and Philippe, largely owing to the second Madame. She said in a letter to her aunt, the Duchess of Hanover, in December of 1672, “Monsieur est le meilleur homme du monde (Wittelsbach-Bourbon 1981, p. 40).” The qualities she did not share with Henriette prevented the clash of tempers that had over and over again plagued Philippe’s first marriage. Philippe’s jealous nature was never tested by Elizabeth, and her youth and robustness of health were both assets to Philippe, as the couple had three children. And despite her youth, she had maturity that Henriette had always lacked, and showed maternal devotion not just to her own children but the two daughters Philippe had with Henriette as well, which drew Philippe in as a father (Barker 1989). However, this did not last long, and eventually they started sleeping apart and their marriage collapsed.\n\nLe Vice Italien\n\nPhilippe was forced into submission, effeminacy, and subjugation, and was rarely provided any choice or power in his life. He had no political offices, no occupations besides his hobbies, and both of his spouses were decided for him. His own family viewed him with suspicion and disdain, and his brother, as a symptom of his desire for absolute power, was wont to purposely humiliate his brother and prove his ultimate authority. And yet, Philippe was able to subversively fight this oppression by in return humiliating his family and exploiting his position as a member of the royal family and fils de France. He reveled in his own scandalous activities in front of the court because it reflected poorly on the crown, and this was the only way that he could fight the power his brother exerted over him. So how did Philippe achieve all this? Simply by being an open homosexual in the 17th century.\n\nSexuality, and especially homosexuality, was obviously defined very differently back then then it is today. As late as the 1940s, homosexuality was recognized but punishable by prison time or chemical castration. But progressivism in the 20th century has lead to much more nuanced, accepting view of sexual orientation. Our modern perceptions of sexuality are defined by sexual attraction. In addition, most progressives today recognize the existence of various gender identities which can color sexual identities. We have expanded the possibilities of sexual orientation greatly and now same sex marriage is legal in many countries. This is a far cry from the way sexual orientation was dealt with in the 17th century. Western countries back then were identifiable for their religious affiliation. Liselotte could not even marry Philippe before converting to Catholicism, which she had to do in secret or risk her family risked losing the support of protestants in their country. Catholicism and the Church’s influence was fairly obvious in many of the kingdom’s laws, and the king’s piety was essential to the support of the people. Needless to say, if religious fanatics today are against homosexuality, it was nothing compared to the mainstream ideology back then. Homosexuality was scarcely even discussed, let alone recognized as an identity, it was simply “errant behavior” and an “abomination,” on the same level as both masturbation and sleeping with animals. Any sexual act that was not directly for marriage was considered immoral, and in fact, homosexuality was punishable by death. Among lesser nobles, it was considered disgrace; it was not unheard of, but it was mostly kept very quiet and discussed only in private correspondence. For commoners, things were even worse: they could be burned at the stake for their actions (Hammond 2011). Philippe, on the other hand, made no secret of his tendencies and relationships. He frequently dressed as a woman and appeared in public with his male lovers and kept them as a part of his household. For Louis, it was probably an embarrassment, but he could no more banish Philippe from court than he could have him burned at the stake.\n\nPhilippe’s attraction to men became first apparent as he became a young man. His first notable affair with a man was with the Comte de Guiche, a noble at court. Anne tried to prevent them spending time together when she realized the nature of their relationship, but they continued to see each other behind her back. Eventually, Philippe brought the connection out into the open, and the relationship became very public. The court was scandalized by how the Comte de Guiche treated Philippe, as he often acted very dominant towards Philippe despite his much lower rank (Barker 1989). This embarrassed Anne and the royal family and deteriorated Philippe’s personal image. But this particular relationship would come back to haunt him during his marriage with Henriette Anne. Henriette, who preyed on Philippe’s jealous tendencies by having multiple affairs, used the comte de Guiche against Philippe by starting a flirtation and possible affair with him. This denigrated Philippe even further, as now he was not in competition for the affection of his wife, as he was for most of her affairs, but was now competing with his wife for the attention of his own former lover.\n\nThe true love of Philippe’s life, however, was not the Comte de Guiche, Henriette Anne, or even Elizabeth Charlotte, despite the contentment of the early years of their marriage. During the War of Devolution with the Spanish, Philippe went to the front lines in his first exposure to military service. Although he did not serve in any official capacity, he distinguished himself with the soldiers, a precursor to his later military exploits in the Franco-Dutch War, where he proved himself an able and courageous military commander (Barker 1989). But it was in this setting that Philippe met the Chevalier de Lorraine, who would continue to be in Philippe’s life for decades. The Chevalier was beautiful, haughty, and excelled as a military commander, much like Philippe himself, and was sexually attracted to both men and women, but Philippe was the ultimate prize on his quest for power and self-enrichment. Saint-Simon described him as “the favorite, by disgraceful means, of Monsieur” and said that he “completely ruled over Monsieur (de Rouvroy 2006).” He held apartments at both of Philippe’s main residencies, Saint Cloud and the Palais Royale. On several occasions during their relationship, Philippe dressed as a woman at balls and parties which he attended with the Chevalier. Their relationship caused such a stir that Henriette conspired with her brother to have him exiled to Italy.\n\nThe Chevalier’s exile was a great source of stress for Philippe, but for a time Philippe was content in his second marriage, even after the Chevalier returned to France from his exile. However, after Philippe achieved a great victory in the Battle of Cassel in the Franco-Dutch War, his military command was revoked as Louis felt upstaged. With Elizabeth Charlotte experiencing severe depression after the death of their first child, Philippe immediately reverted to his old ways. The Chevalier resumed his prestigious place in the prince’s household, and Philippe and Liselotte began sleeping apart. Liselotte described their presence in their household with great chagrin in her letters, saying “le roi et Monsieur leur permettent tous les méchantes imaginables (Wittlesbach-Bourbon 1981, p. 71).” in a letter to her aunt. Philippe spent much of his time during this period of his life devoted to the Chevalier and other male lovers, and gave them great sums of money.\n\nPhilippe’s life marked a turning point in the history of homosexuality as he was the only royal in the 17th century to be as flamboyant as he was without backlash. While obviously his wives and the court disapproved of his actions, other than the exile of the Chevalier de Lorraine, Philippe never really experienced significant consequences for his homosexuality. His father, Louis XIII, was widely suspected to be homosexual, but if he did have any affairs with men, it was kept very quiet, and he did not exhibit the femininity that Philippe did; instead, he was known for being taciturn and stoic. Philippe was possibly given the opportunity to express himself this way as a result of salon culture, which changed gender roles and stereotypes enough that femininity became an indicator of preference for men (Hosford 2013).\n\nPhilippe was a man born with many gifts: charisma, attractiveness, intelligence, a brilliant military mind. But the political climate of the time period trapped him in a life in which he had very little freedom. He had very little money independent of the crown, was subject to his brother’s whims, and was allowed no political offices whatsoever. He was humiliated as a child by his mother and the Cardinal Mazarin in order to protect Louis’s place as the supreme and absolute ruler of France, leaving Philippe neglected and humiliated. Despite this, Philippe was able to find a way to subvert his family and exert the freedoms he was afforded as a prince of France. He was one of the only people in Europe at that time who was free to exercise his homosexuality without fear of banishment, legal troubles, or even execution, as was the expressed laws at the time.\n\nWorks Cited/Annotated\n\nBarker, Nancy Nichols.

Saint Simon was a notable court historian, who wrote much of what he observed in his time during the later parts of Louis XIV’s court and the early regency. His very colorful descriptions of Philippe helped give me a sense of what the court thought of him. Hammond, N. (2011). Medieval and Early Modern French Studies : Gossip, Sexuality and Scandal in France (1610-1715). Oxford, GB: Peter Lang AG, Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften. Retrieved from http://www.ebrary.com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu This book detailed how scandal and gossip traveled in court, and it focused quite a bit on Philippe. It helped me understand how the court in general received his actions, which were definitely scandalous. Despite this being a secondary source it was very helpful in discerning attitudes in court during that time period. Hosford, D. (2013). Le vice italien: Philippe d’Orleans and constructing the sodomite in seventeenth century France (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). City University of New York, New York, NY. This dissertation was important to the second half of my paper because it put Philippe’s homosexuality in the context of history. It discusses how salons and court culture changed perceptions of masculinity and how that changed expressions of homosexuality. It put Philippe’s personality, attitudes, and sexual behavior in terms of those that came before and after him.\n\nTreasure, Geoffrey. Louis XIV. New York, Pearson Education, 2001.\n\nI mostly used this resource for information on the Fronde. The Fronde had a very deep impact on Philippe’s life and how he was treated by his family. In addition, it was very helpful when dealing with Madame de Monteville’s memoirs, because she discusses Anne’s regency and the Fronde quite a bit. Wittelsbach-Bourbon, E. C. (1981). Lettres de la princesse Palatine (O. Amiel, Comp.). Paris, France: Mercure de France. This book is a compilation of the letters of Philippe’s second wife. It shows how the nature of their relationship changed and how she felt about Philippe’s actions. I decided to quote the original French in my paper instead of translating to English to give the sense of what she was saying without a translator’s interpretation. Argument and Research Process When I was first assigned Philippe as my character to study for this class, I was unenthused. Who cares about the brother of one of the most famous French kings of all time? But as I did my research and learned more about my subject, I realized what a truly interesting life he had. The suffering he went through at the hands of his family just for being born two years later than someone else was fascinating enough, but having the freedom to be openly homosexual in a time where people were burned at the stake for that was just fascinating to me. I decided on this angle and this argument because I wanted to really focus on the intersection of the two forces in Philippe’s life: the fact that he was born a royal, and the fact that he was born a second son. The way those two roles interplayed at this specific time in history created the enigma that was Philippe’s life. With the ingredient of homosexuality those two factors combine to create a distinctly unique figure."
