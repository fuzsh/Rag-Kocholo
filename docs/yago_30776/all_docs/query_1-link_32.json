        "text": "Clicking on the names above will (or should) take you to the monument. I have listen the names in alphabetical order with kings first, as their names are followed by a number, then the other names in order. Where there are several people with the same name (there are two Louis and two Philips of France, for example) I have listed them in order of the date of death. I have been somewhat haphazard with the French names: for example Jean I have altered to John, so there is no confusion to the English but Jeanne remains the same and is not translated to Joan. ClÃ©mance d'Hongarie is half translated. This may not be strictly logical but I trust it helps to clarity. There are inconsistencies for which I take the blame! Philip VI 'Of Valois'\n\n(1293 - 1350)\n\nFollowing the death of the sons of Philip IV ('The Fair) - all of who died childless - the crown passed to the Valois branch of the Capetians; Edward III of England believed he had a better claim to the throne of France. John II 'The Good'\n\n( 1319 - 1364)\n\nSon of Philip VI. He was captured at the Battle of Poiters in 1356 by the English . He was allowed to return to France, leaving his son behind as a hostage; he however escaped and John returned to England where he died. Philip V 'The Long'\n\n(1293 - 1322)\n\nSon of Philip IV Jeanne d'Evreux\n\n(1371)\n\nThird wife of Charles IV. Charles IV 'The Fair'\n\n(1295 - 1328)\n\nSon of Philip IV Blanche of France\n\n(1328 - 1393)\n\nDaughter of Charles IV\n\nWife of Philip of OrlÃ©ans.\n\nFrom the workshop of Jean de LiÃ¨ge and Robert Loisel These two monuments were sculptured by a team of sculptors led by AndrÃ© Beauneuveu (1366) Dated 1327 The Queen became a patron of the arts following her husband's death and commisioned her effigy during her life time. Dated c. 1329\n\nWith the accession of the Valois kings there is a change of style: the cloak is attached at the shoulder, the crown has four points and one hands holds the scepter and the other the hand of justice. These latter are unfortunately lost from these effigies but can be seen on the later examples. Note the open cloaks and the position of the hands, which is also featured on the effigies of Philip III, father of Philip IV, and Charles X, another brother of the above two brother kings...\n\nA similar design was used for this monument as had been used for the previous two monarchs: the King and Queen lie on their tomb chests are cadavers while on top the kneel in prayer. These latter figures are in bronze as are the Four Virtues - Faith, Hope, Charity, and Good Deeds at the corners.\n\nThe monument was originally situaed in the 'Mausoleum of the Valois', discussed earlier. Louis XII (1462 - 1515) & Anne of Brittany (1477 - 1514)\n\nIn 1516 Francis I commissioned a marble monument for his predecessor and this was installed in Saint-Denis in 1531. The designer was either Guido Mazzoni or Perreal and executed by Jean Juste and his family. The base is carved with narrative bas reliefs of the King's Italian wars, and the Four Cardinal Virtues - Prudence, Temperance, Fortitude, and Strength sit at the corners. Figures of the Apostles sit under the arches.\n\nThe King and Queen lie on their tomb chest inside the monument, shown as cadavers, rather grimly shown at the moment of death, the Queen throwing back her head in a final spasm. The post mortem sutures are gruesomely shown. On the upper stage the King and Queen kneel in prayer. Top: Carloman (751 - 771) Son of PÃ©pin, brother of Charlemagne. Originally buried in Reims but reburied in St Denis in the 13th century.\n\nBottom: Ermentrude (825 - 869) Wife of Charles II 'the Bald'.

The marble column was sculpted by Jacques de Valleroy and originally held a kneeling copper effigy of the Cardinal. The Wikipedia entry states that he was buried in the cathedral of Laon, so this is part of a cenotaph..\n\nNear left: Henry III (1574 - 1589) & Louise of Lorraine ( - 1650) Henry III, heart burial, was assassinated at Saint-Cloud where his heart was buried, his body being taken to the Abbey of Saint-Corneille, Saint-Denis then being in the hands of the 'Leaguers'; he was finally buried at Saint-Denis in 1610 in the vault of his father, Henry II.
