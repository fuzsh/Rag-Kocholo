        "text": "by Scott Mehl © Unofficial Royalty 2020\n\nOn August 1, 1589, King Henri III of France was stabbed by Jacques Clément, a Dominican friar. He died the following morning from his injuries. Henri was the last French king from the House of Valois, and as he had no children, was succeeded by King Henri III of Navarre who became King Henri IV of France, establishing the House of Bourbon on the French throne.\n\nHenri III, King of France\n\nHenri was born September 19, 1551, at the Château de Fontainebleau, the fourth son of King Henri II of France and Catherine de’ Medici. Two of his elder brothers reigned as French kings – François II and Charles IX. Henri was created Duke of Angoulême and Duke of Orléans in 1560, and Duke of Anjou in 1566.\n\nHenri was elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in May 1573. However, after becoming King of France in 1574, Henri never returned to Poland, and the Polish parliament declared the throne vacant in May 1575. Following his coronation, Henri married Louise of Lorraine, but the couple had no children. This led to the French throne passing to his distant cousin, Henri of Navarre, who took the throne as King Henri IV, the first French king from the House of Bourbon.\n\nFor more information, see Unofficial Royalty: King Henri III of France\n\nThe Assassination\n\nWhile staying with his forces in Saint-Cloud, intending to attack Paris the following day, the King received a visit from a Dominican friar, Jacques Clément. During the French Wars of Religion, Clément had become a supporter of the Catholic League and fanatically religious. He developed a plan to kill the King and was encouraged by some of the leaders of the Catholic League, including Catherine de Guise, the Duchess of Montpensier. With forged papers alleged to be for the King, Clément made his way to Saint-Cloud. Arriving on August 1, 1589, Clément was permitted to meet with the King. After handing the papers to the King, Clément told him he also had a private message to deliver. The King ordered his guards to step away and Clément approached him and began to whisper in his ear. At the same time, he drew a dagger from beneath his cloak and stabbed the King in the abdomen. The attendants quickly stepped in and Clément was immediately killed.\n\nWhat happened to King Henri III?\n\nAt first, it appeared that the King was not fatally injured. However, sensing his impending death, the King insisted that his officers pledge their loyalty to Henri of Navarre as their new king, should he not survive. The following morning, King Henri III of France died from his injuries. He was interred in the Basilica of Saint-Denis in Paris, the traditional burial site of the French kings and royal family.\n\nWhat happened to Jacques Clément?\n\nThe King’s guards immediately killed Clément. Later his body was quartered and burned. For his act, he was seen by many as a martyr, particularly by those who supported the Catholic League. He was praised by Pope Sixtus V, and it was even discussed that he should be canonized as a saint."
