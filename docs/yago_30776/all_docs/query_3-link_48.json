        "text": "Lorraine Louise Silberman (nee Stoltz), age 93, of Wichita, Kansas, passed away on Wednesday, July 31, 2024. She was born May 9, 1931, in Keyesville, Wisconsin to John and Elizabeth (nee Doyle) Stoltz and was raised on a dairy farm. Lorraine was the youngest of eight children, Ed, Leo, Mary, Marcella, Rose, Joe, and Veronica. She attended St. Mary's grade school in Keyesville and graduated from Ithaca High School in 1949.\n\nShe married Richard Meister in September 1949, and they lived in Beloit, Wisconsin for most of their marriage. Tragically, on July 2, 1960, a car accident took the life of Richard (age 31) and all six of their children, Kathleen (age 8), Karen (age 7), Robert (age 6), Brian (age 4), Colleen (age 3), and Daniel (age 1).\n\nLorraine later married Robert (Bob) Silberman in March of 1965, and they established a home in Rockford, Illinois. They had 2 children. Bob passed away in 1997. Lorraine became a grandmother for the first time at the age of 73 and was thrilled. She enjoyed her time with the little ones, who were all close in age, and created special memories with each of them. In 2004, Lorraine moved to the Chicago suburb of Lombard to be near family. She moved to Wichita with family in 2019.\n\nOver the years, Lorraine remained faithful and was involved with the Catholic church, whether it was Brother Dutton in Beloit, St. Rita's in Rockford, Christ the King in Lombard, or Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton in Wichita. She worked in and out of the home, caring for her family and also enjoyed helping with school and scouting events, banking, helping Bob, and retail sales. She loved to buy Marshall Field's Frango Mints for her loved ones at Christmas. Lorraine enjoyed card games such as Euchre and croquet. In the later years, she enjoyed traveling throughout the United States and also to Ireland.\n\nLorraine will be remembered as resilient and strong, and a faithful servant of God. In her final days, she was especially joyful and loving, lighting up the room with her smiles.\n\nSurvivors include two children, Bruce (Susan) Silberman of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Sue (Dave) Blasi of Wichita, Kansas; four grandchildren, Cage and Ryder Silberman of Charlotte, and Graham and Annia Blasi of Wichita.\n\nLorraine was predeceased in death by her parents; her spouses, Richard S. Meister and Robert C. Silberman; six children by Richard Meister; brothers Ed, Leo, and Joe; sisters Mary, Marcella, and Veronica.\n\nA visitation will take place on Friday, August 16, 2024, from 10:00 a.m. until the time of Funeral Mass, 11:00 a.m. at St. Rita Catholic Church, 6254 Valley Knoll Dr., Rockford, IL 61109. Burial to follow at Arlington Memorial Park. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to St. Rita Catholic Church. To send online condolences or share memories, please visit www.fitzgeraldfh.com"
