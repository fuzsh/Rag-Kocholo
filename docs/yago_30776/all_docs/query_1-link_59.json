Her mother died in Mar 1554 while Louise was still a baby.\n\nTo the astonishment of most people she was chosen as wife by Henry III of France and was married to him on 15 February 1575 in the Cathedral of Reims. The couple had no children.\n\nThe King was assassinated on 2 August 1589 and Louise spent the rest of her life in mourning, seeking to have her husband's reputation rehabilitated.\n\nShe died at Moulins on 29 January 1601.\n\nSources\n\nWikipedia: Louise of Lorraine"
