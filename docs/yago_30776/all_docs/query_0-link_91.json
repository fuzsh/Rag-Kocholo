        "text": "Margaret de Valois, Queen of Navarre (b.1576: d.1632)\n\nBorn in 1576, the Princess Margaret de Valois was the first French royal born in 20 years. She was the darling to both her parents and her grandparents, as well as the favoured niece of her only living uncle, Francis, Duke of Anjou.\n\nMargaret, like her namesake and aunt the Queen of Navarre, would grow to be the most beautiful of her father's daughters, though not the most accomplished in a scholarly fashion (that would be Charlotte de Valois (b.1587), who wrote seven books in her lifetime about various subjects, from religion to agriculture). She was short but well-formed, with large, dark Italian eyes and thick blonde hair. In the words of her own mother:\n\n\"...My daughter is a wondrous, pale creature. Fair of hair and dark of eyes, like a creature of moonlight...\"\n\nThe early life of Margaret de Valois was filled with ceremonies and warmth. She herself would reference the familial atmosphere of her youth to complain about her own unhappy family in later years. In particular, she would always stay close to her younger brother, Henri de Valois the Duke of Orleans.\n\nShe and her siblings would live in the country from 1583 onwards, after a particularly nasty threat from Henri, Duke of Guise. Her younger brother Louis would die shortly after, being the only sibling of hers to die very young.\n\nHer marriage options were constantly changed, having her flit between countries constantly. Her longest betrothal would be to Prince James Stewart of Scotland, who would revoke her in 1582 (at least, her council would). He would be followed by Philip, Prince of Asturias and then Charles of Savoy. However, both of these options came to an end when, in 1587, Henri III of Navarre announced he and Margaret de Valois the Elder were seeking an annulment.\n\nHenri IV of France was furious that his sister, a French Princess, would be replaced. He knew that the marriage would come to an end due to their childless state, but the King of France did not want another country to get their claws into the King of Navarre.\n\nIn 1589, Henri III of France was assassinated. Stabbed by Jacques Clemet, a Dominican friar, in a ruse in which he pretended to be a messenger. This, which was a second blow to the royal family after the death of Catherine de Medici early in the year, left the royal family with a whole.\n\nLouise of Lorraine took control for the time being, marching herself and her eldest three children to Paris to have Francis coroneted as Francis IV of France. She agreed to a joint regency with the Duke of Guise and Francis would, until his majority in 1575, act mostly as a humble student to both. However, Louise would focus on her other children, finding them matches at the highest levels she could.\n\nIn 1591, the annulment of Henry III of Navarre and Margaret de Valois was finalised. Immediately, two women were considered by the King to become the next Queen of Navarre. Louise of Lorraine put her eldest daughter forward, who competed with the very rich Marie de Medici and, for a very brief time the Queen of England. but ultimately, the more closely available and thus easier to get Margaret was chosen.\n\nMargaret and Henri would be married in March of 1593, at the age of 17. The couple would spend the majority of their early marriage in Paris, leaving in 1598 for the Court of Navarre to begin as a more solitary couple.\n\nMargaret would have two sons, one of whom died young, and four daughters, two of which would die young. Her children would be: Antoine of Navarre (b.1596: d.1600), Marie Christine of Navarre (b.1599), Elisabeth of Navarre (b.1601: d.1603), Jeanne of Navarre (b.1602: d.1604), Henri of Navarre (b.1605) and Anne Charlotte of Navarre (b.1610). After the birth of Anne Charlotte, Margaret would never conceive again. However, she would adopt three peasant children in 1611, naming the babies Diane, Claude and Hercules. These three would find themselves as accomplices to their royal counterparts, particularly the beautiful Claude, who would become the lover to Prince Henri after his own marriage to the plain and violent Benedetta Gonzaga, many years in the future.\n\nIn 1611, a war broke out between Spain and Navarre which was to do over some small land quarrel, which left Margaret feeling threatened for her children's lives. Electing the support of her French relatives, she managed to successfully support her husband, who repulsed the invading Spaniards and felt entirely victorious. However, this was shot lived as he was killed in 1612 by a former monk, who felt he was betraying the Church with his reformist leanings.\n\nUpon her husband's passing, Margaret would rush her family to Paris, fearing that Henri III of Navarre had been killed by the Spanish and her children were in danger. She would eventually return in 1615, when she felt the country free of the threat of assassination (well, more free than before, as he wore steel a her chest and back for the rest of her life to protect herself from possible threats).\n\nShe ruled as regent until 1618, when she was disgraced in the court by being discovered as the lover of the travelling Prince of Conde and had his bastard daughter, the short lived Renee de Bourbon (b.1619: d.1622). However, Margaret would remain at the Court of Navarre and made a match for her eldest daughter of the Prince of Wales in 1624, in lieu of the English Prince's failed Spanish match. Her younger daughter would marry the heir to Modena in 1625 and Margaret would leave Navarre forever in 1633, upon her son's marriage and first bastard child by his adopted sister.\n\nHer last years were uncomfortable, after she gained almost double her weight in 3 years and she would die of heart failure in late 1637.\n\nMargaret de Valois (b.1576: d.1632) m.

His mother and father greeted his birth with extreme enthusiasm, calling him the most perfect child in Christendom and the most beautiful child, after his elder sister. All in all, a child could not have been more loved.\n\nHis early life mirrored his sister's, moving from the city to the country and eventually taking Paris back from the Catholic radicals. He entered the city at the age of 12, acting as a benevolent, outwardly forgiving the Duke of Guise and actually pushing his mother to accept the joint regency. However, Francis would always have a hatred of the Guise family and, at his coronation, he deliberately snubbed the Duke of Guise. He would also, when asked for the hand of his daughter Louise for Francis, Prince of Joinville, laughed directly in the Duke's face and told him he would ask his father's corpse.\n\nIn 1593, Francis III of France attended his sister's wedding to Henri IV of Navarre and personally granted her the Dukedom of Berry for her lifetime. He would retain a good relationship with his sister but, upon her death and his nephew's pleas that her income's be retained for himself and his court, he took back the title and estates.\n\nHis marriage to Italian Princess Marie de Medici in 1597 would never be categorised as 'strong', but the two would have 7 children: Louis, Dauphin of France (b.1599: d.1670), Philippe, Duke of Angouleme (b.1600: d.1606), Nicholas, Duke of Aquitaine (b.1603: d.1687), Louise of France (b.1607: d.1630), Gaston, Duke of Angouleme (b.1609: d.1609), Anne Christina of France (b.1612: d.1670) and Henrietta of France (b.1614: d.1615), as well as a stillborn son in 1611.\n\nHis eldest son Louis married Henriette de Lorraine (b.1605: d.1660) in 1626, which resulted in one child to survive, who would die 3 years after Francis and thus leave Louis XIII heirless. However, he would not remarry until his wife's death in 1660, when he married Catherine Beatrice of Savoy (b.1636: d.1698) and had 3 living children (5 were born).\n\nHis third son, Nicholas, would have an interesting and varied love life. He began an affair with Henri III of Navarre's bastard daughter Catherine Henriette de Bourbon (b.1596: d.1664) in 1618, ending in 1622 with the birth of their short lived daughter Marie de Aquitaine. He then was quickly married to Marie de Bourbon (b.1605: d.1625) and had two children. He then remarried to his cousin Claudia de Medici (b.1604: d.1648), who supplied him with 5 children, only 2 of which survived. He lived with many mistresses after his second wife's death, including the notable Catherine de Lorraine (b.1626: d.1645) and later Marie Gabrielle de Orleans (b.1646: d.1679). However, in 1676 he married Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria (b.1660: d.1690), who gave birth to 2 of his children (one of which survived) before his death. He would be known as a charming and sweet man who, despite his many mistresses and wives, was always gentle and generous to any girl in need. However, due to the many women he 'knew', there were rumours the mother of his bastard son Louis of Aquitaine (b.1676: 1700) was with a misremembered product of a previous night of passion.\n\nThe eldest daughter of Francis III, Louise of France, would become the first wife of Philip IV and the two would have 2 children, Carlos (b.1627) and Maria Catalina of Spain (b.1630). Both her children would have issue, though only the children of Charles would survive more than one generation, as Maria Catalina's three daughter's would all either choose a life in the church or, in the case of her youngest daughter Marianna, fail to have children with their spouses.\n\nAnd finally, his youngest daughter to survive childhood was Anne Christina, who would marry Leopold Wilhelm of Austria (b.1614:d.1662) and would have 4 children: Maria Anna of Austria (b.1650: d.1650), Francis of Austria (b.1652: d.1652), Barbara of Austria (b.1653: d.1657) and Christina of Austria (b.1656). Her daughter Christina would marry Henri VI of Navarre and only have a single child: Jeanne IV of Navarre (b.1672), who would marry Henri IV of France and bring Navarre to France.\n\nFrancis III of France would have continual war with Spain over both the issue of Naples and Milan, punctuated by peace brought on his eldest daughter's marriage in 1626 and his youngest daughter's marriage in 1647. However, this war came to an end in 1652, when his grandson Louis, future Dauphin of France was betrothed to Maria Catalina of Spain, who would never marry or meet her betrothed as he died young. His son would instead offer his niece Marie Henriette de Aquitaine for Charles II of Spain, who eventually married her and had two sons.\n\nFrancis III of France (b.1577: d.1653) m.
