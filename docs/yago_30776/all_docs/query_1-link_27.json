        "text": "Full Name: Henry III, born Alexandre Édouard, Duke of Angoulême\n\nProfession: King of France and Poland\n\nBiography: Henry III was King of France from 1574 until his death in 1589. While he was French, he also briefly served as King of Poland from 1573 to 1575.\n\nHenry III was born in 1551 as the fourth son of King Henry II and Catherine de' Medici. He was not expected to become king in France and so, in 1573, at the age of 22, he was elected King of Poland. He left Poland in 1575, however, when his brother King Charles IX of France died and he inherited the French throne.\n\nAs King of France, Henry III faced many challenges. There was fighting between Catholics and a group of Protestants who were called Huguenots. Henry's own family, led by the Duke of Anjou, were also troublesome. In 1576, Henry III allowed some freedoms for Huguenots in the Edict of Beaulieu, but then took them away under pressure from the Catholic Duke of Guise.\n\nHenry III had no children with his wife Louise of Lorraine. After his brother died, the next in line for the throne was Henry of Navarre, a Protestant. In 1588, Henry III had the Duke of Guise killed, which angered the Catholics in France. He was often criticized, with it being said that he was more interested in parties and his close male friends than his role as king.\n\nIn 1589, Henry III joined forces with Henry of Navarre against the Catholics. This ended in tragedy, however, when later that same year he was killed by a Catholic priest.\n\nHenry III was the last king from the Valois family. Subsequently Henry of Navarre was crowned King of France as Henry IV, starting the Bourbon family of kings.\n\nBorn: September 19, 1551\n\nBirthplace: Château de Fontainebleau, France\n\nStar Sign: Virgo\n\nDied: August 2, 1589 (aged 37)\n\nCause of Death: Assassinated by Dominican friar Jacques Clément who plunged a knife into his abdomen.\n\nHistorical Events\n\nKing Henry III follows brother Charles IX as King of France\n\nHenry III of France is crowned at Rheims\n\nDuel of the Mignons claims the lives of two favorites of Henry III of France and two favorites of Henry I, Duke of Guise.\n\n\"The Day of the Dagger\" Henry, Duke of Guise, leader of the Catholic League is assassinated by the bodyguards of King Henry III at the Château de Blois\n\nAssassination of French King Henry III by friar Jacques Clément\n\nPersonal Life\n\nHenry III of France marries Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont.\n\nReferences\n\nHenri III, King of France - British Museum\n\nFamous Kings"
