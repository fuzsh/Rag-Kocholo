Owned by the Bibliothèque nationale de France.\n\t\n\tDe Court (1530-1589) was born in Limoges and rose to fame as a painter of enamel. He was appointed painter to Prince de la Roche-sur-Yon in 1553, and then in 1562 painter to Mary, Queen of Scots -- the wife of King Francis II of France. In 1572, de Court succeeded François Clouet as painter to Charles IX of France. In 1572, he succeeded François Clouet as painter to the king at the court of her brother-in-law Charles IX of France, He died in either 1585 or 1589.\n\t\n\tHenry III was the fourth son of King Henry II of France. His second-oldest brother, Louis of Valois, Duke of Orleans, died at the age of 1 year and 8 months in October 1559. His oldest brother, King Francis II, was married at age 14 to the same-aged Mary Queen of Scots. He died childless at age 16 in December 1560 from either mastoiditis, meningitis, or an otitis abcess. His third-oldest brother, King Charles IX, died in May 1874 from tuberculosis and complications from insanity.\n\t\n\tAs Henry was not expected to inherit the French throne, he was instead electioned King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania at the age of 20 in 1573. After Charles IX's death, Henry abdicated the throne of Poland-Lithuania.\n\t\n\tFrance was plagued by the Wars of Religion, and Henry advocated religious tolerance to save the nation from collapse.\n\t\n\tHenry was fond of the arts and reading, and had intense homosexual relationships with favourties, known as <i>les mignons</i> (&quot;the dainty ones). He married Louise of Lorraine on Valentine's Day in 1575, but over the next decade it became apparent Henry would not produce an heir -- and a succession crisis began.\n\t\n\tHenry's younger brother, the Duke of Anjou, defected to the Protestants and forced Henry to grant Protestants major freedoms in 1576. The Catholics retaliated by forming the Catholic League under the leadership of the Duke of Guise. Guise invaded Paris in May 1588, forcing Henry to flee to Chartres. Guise refused the crown, and instead forced Henry to pledge never to sign a peace with the Protestants, never to turn the throne over to a Protestant, give amnesty to all Catholic rebels, and deny Protestants all public offices.\n\t\n\tHenry invited Guise to the Château de Blois on December 23, 1588. Henry had him murdered and imprisoned his son. The duke was so popular, however, that the public rioted and Parliament accused the king of murder. Henry's armed forces were so weak that he was forced to sign an alliance with his Protestant cousin, Henry of Navarre. His followers in Parliament fled, and set up a rump Parliament in Tours.\n\t\n\tBy summer 1589, Henry was ready to dislodge the Catholic League from Paris. He was with his army at Saint-Cloud when a fanatical Dominican friar, Jacques Clément, gained access to his presence through falsified papers. As Clément leaned over to whisper to Henry, he stabbed him in the abdomen. Clément was killed on the spot. The following morning, on Henry died. Chaos swept his army, and it melted away. Henry was interred at the Saint Denis Basilica. He was the last of the Valois kings; Henry of Navarre succeeded him as Henry IV, the first of the Bourbon kings.",
