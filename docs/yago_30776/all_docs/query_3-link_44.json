        "text": "Made in Chelsea’s Louise Thompson has just released her book Lucky, writing about her traumatic birth two years ago - and went onto Lorraine to talk about the experience.\n\nLouise sat down with presenter Lorraine Kelly on Tuesday 21 May and shockingly revealed she had \"no relationship\" with her fiance Ryan Libbey after their son’s birth.\n\nLouise sadly explained: “In the early days, we had no relationship. We were both so traumatised dealing with our own versions of PTSD and he [Ryan] is still not in a place where he feels ready to start proper therapy yet.\n\n“When I finally did come home after spending near enough a month in hospital, he would lie awake all night checking on me all night, worried that I was going to die.”\n\nLouise and Ryan first met at a gym in 2016 when he was working as a PT. The pair got engaged in 2018 and welcomed their son two and a half years ago. However Leo’s birth put the pair in a tough situation.\n\nDuring an interview with MailOnline, Louise revealed that Ryan had considered leaving her: “I’ve asked him if he thought about leaving me and he said yes. Ouch. That stung. But he also knew he never would go through with it.”\n\nRyan himself revealed: “I was struggling and thought a lot about a different life. But in the same way I never really believed you would take your own life, I never believed I would walk away.”\n\nLorraine then asked Louise whether she could have, or wanted more children following her harrowing first birth where she lost three-and-a-half litres of blood’.\n\nLouise said: “It’s still fairly inconclusive. I will never be mentally strong enough to carry a child. I've got something called Asherman syndrome where my uterus is glued together with scar tissue. I suppose in one sense it’s a mirable I didn’t have a hysterectomy.\n\n“I'm so grateful to have one beautiful, healthy child who has lots of friends and cousins and I do have ovaries, so there's a chance that I could freeze some eggs and further down the line.”\n\nLouise recently revealed online that she’s had a stoma fitted - who she calls Winnie.\n\nOn her social media Louise wrote: “HOW DO I DISCLOSE THIS SORT OF NEWS? It’s not exactly exciting like a big pregnancy or gender reveal announcement! Hey look i’m having a boy… Hey look i’ve got a stoma!”.\n\nAnd told Lorraine she’s getting back to her healthy self. Louise said: “I feel the best I have felt in two years. I feel really well to the point where my friends and family are now saying, ‘maybe I need my colon removed’, which is a bit dramatic."
