David Lloyd George was born in a dismal terrace house in Chorlton-upon-Medlock, Manchester, on 17 January 1863. The North Wales in which Lloyd George grew up had a distinctive political culture. An overwhelmingly agricultural society, it was deeply polarised. Lloyd George was brought up as a strict Baptist, though he lost his religious faith at the age of 12. Lloyd George’s election for Caernarvon Boroughs began an unbroken term of nearly 54 years in the House of Commons. Re-elected in both the 1892 and 1895 elections, his parliamentary activities prior to 1899 were almost exclusively confined to Welsh issues. It was the Boer War, starting in 1899, which turned Lloyd George from a purely Welsh politician into a national figure. Lloyd George was the outstanding parliamentary orator of his time – perhaps of all time – but by common consent his delivery of the speech presenting his ‘People’s Budget’ on 29 April 1909 was the worst of his long career.
