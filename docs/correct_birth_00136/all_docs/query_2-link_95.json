        "text": "The first time we see Lloyd George Parry (Jnr.) is on the 1921 census, when he is living with his parents at 22, Salisbury Street, Shotton, Flintshire, they were Boarders with the Humphreys family. His father also names Loyd George Parry was head of the household and 28 years and 6 months old, he had been born in Buckley, Flintshire. He was a Blacksmith in J. Summers & Sons Ironworks, Shotton, but was ’Out of Work.’ His wife, Nora Parry was 26 years and 4 months old, and their son Loyd George Parry was 2 years and 3 months old; both he and Nora had been born in Shotton, Flintshire.\n\nLloyd George Parry was born in the June quarter of 1919 in the Hawarden Registration District (Hawarden Vol. 11b Page 319), the son of Lloyd George & Leonora Parry (nee Manifold), who I believe married in a Civil Marriage at Holywell in 1918. (Flintshire (Mold) HOL/40/84)\n\nThe 1911 census shows Lloyd George Parry the elder living with his family at 389, Carnarvon Road, Bangor (5 rooms). The head of the household was his father Edward Parry, 48 and a Blacksmith, born Mold, he tells us that he had been married 23 years to Sarah, his wife, she was 41 and she tells us that 8 children had been born and they were all still living, also that she had been born in Altami, Flintshire, as had Lloyd George, who was 18 , single and also a Blacksmith. Nora, 15 and single was assisting at Home, she had been born in Soughton, Flintshire. The rest of the children had all been born in Bangor, Carnarvonshire. They were Wilfred Edward, 11, Annie, 8, Hilda, 5 and Jessie, 2, all at school.\n\nThe 1901 census reveals that there were 2 other daughters, part of the 8 children on the 1911 census. They were at the same address, 389, Carnarvon Road, Bangor. Edward was 39, Sarah, 32, born on this census at Northop, as were their 2 eldest daughters, Lizzie, 12 and Alice, 10, and Lloyd George ,8 and Nora, 5. Wilfred Edward, 2 was the first child born in Bangor.\n\nPossible Baptism of Lloyd George’s father: –\n\nMold Parish Register – Baptisms.\n\nPage 49 No. 386 10th May 1894 Lloyd George s/o Edward & Sarah PARRY, New Brighton, Mold, Blacksmith.\n\nLloyd George Parry Junior ‘s father, Lloyd George Parry, had been in WW1 and in the British Army WWI Service Records, 1914-1920, his Attestation Paper and His Conduct Sheet tells us that he lived at 21 Caellepa, Bangor N Wales and he was age 22 years, Church of England, single and a Shoeing Smith. This also confirms his father as Edward Parry. He is described as 5 feet 7 inches with a chest measurement of 35 and ½ inches with an expansion of 2 and ½ inches.\n\nCuriously there is an added handwritten question to his Attestation – (7a) – Have you truly stated the whole, if any of your previous services and Lloyd George (Snr.) answered – “Yes.” This was in addition to the usual question on his Military service, (7.) where he answered “No.”\n\nThey also record that he enlisted at Woolwich on the 28th of April 1915 and on the 25th of May 1915 he was promoted to Corporal but unpaid. On the 23rd of June 1916 he was posted to the Royal Field Artillery 5th Res. Bde.\n\nHowever, on the 1st of September 1916 he was discharged as Physically Unfit. Character – Very Good. On another paper his disability was stated to have been caused by Military Service (Active), this was at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, and dated the 29th of August 1916.\n\nHis military History Sheet tells us that he spent 77 days at “Home” from the 27th of April 1915 to the 12th of July 1915, then he went to France from the 13th of July 1915 to the 22nd of June 1916 (346 days), then “Home” again from the 23rd of June 1916 to the 1st of September 1916 (71 days – total 494 days.) I have downloaded the Service Papers, so if anyone wants them, please get in touch with the website.\n\nLloyd George Junior was a pianist and in the Cheshire Observer of the 26th of November 1932, it was reported that he had been successful in passing his Music & Elocution Exams held by the Trinity College of Music, at the Chester Centre.\n\nHe also attended Hawarden Grammar School Admissions Register E/GS/1/10 gives us this information: –\n\n1567/2161 PARRY, Lloyd George date of birth – 29?/ March 1919, Rose Leigh, Highfields, Hawarden, Father – Blacksmith, Date of Entry – 15th September 1931, Hawarden N.P. Schl. £6 , Bks 10/-, Date of leaving – 18th October 1935 – Clerk.\n\nLloyd George (Junr.) was to enlist 3 years later, according to the Royal Artillery Enlistment Register in 1938, which explains why I couldn’t find him on the 1939 National Register.\n\n1939 National Register, which was taken on the29th of September 1939 shows his father Lloyd George Parry living at “Roseleigh,” Hawarden, Flintshire, Wales. This source also gives his date of birth as being the 10th of January 1893 and he was a Blacksmith (Heavy Worker). His wife Leonora (Lena) is shown as most married women with no job as doing “Unpaid Domestic Duties,” and her date of birth was given as the 26th of March 1895. There is one closed record, who I believe may have been Lloyd George’s sister, Sheila.\n\nHis mother Leonora’s siblings, were born in Connah’s Quay and the 1911 census shows Leonora, age 16 years, living at 57 King Edward Street, Shotton, Hawarden, Flintshire, with her sister Madeline, who had married Harry Hollis in the September quarter of 1904 (Hawarden Vol. 11b Page 378). By the 1939 National Register they were still living there, except Leonora had moved on.\n\nOn this same Register, Leonora’s mother Mary J. Manifold is seen living at 61 Brook Road, Hawarden*, Flintshire, a widow, and her birth date is shown as the 14th of March 1861, and she is doing “Unpaid Domestic Duties.”\n\n*I think this would have been 61, Brook Road, Shotton, Hawarden.\n\nGoing back with the Manifold family, the 1901 census shows Leonora’s family living in the Nine Houses in Shotton, The head of the household was John Jones Manifold, 46 a Master Mariner born in Bagillt, his wife Margaret* J. Manifold was 40 years old and she and the rest of the family had been born in Connah’s Quay. Their children were Charles, 20 single and a Machinist in an Engine Shop, Madeline, 16 was a Music Teacher (Piano) (own Account) (At home), Margaret A. 14, Gertrude, 11 and Leonora, 6, made up the family.\n\n*I believe that this is an Enumerator’s error as on the 1911 census and her marriage Registration she is Mary J.\n\n1911 sees the Manifold Family still living in the Nine Houses, Shotton. Leonora’s father, John J. Manifold, 56 and a Master Mariner tells us that he had been married for 32 years, his wife Mary J Manifold, was 50 and she tells us that 6 children had been born, but sadly one had died. Gertrude, 22 and single was the only remaining sibling left at home,\n\nI have no record of Lloyd George Junior’s young life or teenage years really except that he was a pianist, nor his Service Records, so if anyone can add to his story, please get in touch.\n\nAccording to Scottish People, Lloyd George Parry met and married Margaret L.T. McBurney in 1941in the Arbroath and St Vigeans Registration District (272/ 54) https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/\n\nI have no information of Lloyd George’s time with 630 Bty., 188 H.A.A. Regt. Royal Artillery, but he must have been stationed in Londonderry or thereabouts and on the wonderful website https://www.ww2ni.com/countylondonderrypt2.htm there is mention of Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiments, as well as American Camps and R.A.F. graves, mostly photographs, which are very interesting, and there are lots of them, giving an insight of WW2 in Londonderry and beyond. Many thanks to the website owner Andy Glenfield.\n\nWas Lloyd George PARRY stationed in Londonderry with the 630 Bty., 188 H.A.A. Regt. Royal Artillery\n\nHis Casualty Card gives his place of birth as Connah’s Quay and his domicile as Hawarden. There is no other clue to his death.\n\nLloyd George was to die in the City and County Hospital in Londonderry, Northen Ireland but sadly I cannot find out what of, either a natural death or otherwise. The family can apply for his Service Records to https://www.ctp.org.uk/military-disclosures-addresses\n\nAccording to Lloyd George’s death notices in the Arbroath area, he was an accomplished pianist and had performed in many Charity concerts in Arbroath and was a member of a Dance Band in Shotton.\n\nHis father was one of the bearers at his funeral and his coffin was covered by the Union Jack and a firing party fired a Volley over the grave by representatives of the Royal Artillery.\n\nhttps://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/\n\nMargaret L. Parry remarried in 1948 to James Lavender – LAVENDER, JAMES WM- PARRY, MARGARET LUNDIE – 1948 – 272/ 113 – Arbroath and St Vigeans\n\nHis father Lloyd George Parry was to survive his son by many years as he died on the 4th of July 1966 according to his Probate: –\n\nPARRY, Lloyd George of 15, Highfied, Hawarden, Flintshire died 4th July 1966. Administration Bangor 21 July to Leonora PARRY, widow.\n\nHis mother, Leonora was to survive him too, as she died in the September quarter of 1976 (Alyn/D. Side Vol. 24 Page 26)\n\nHe was well loved, and his parents and family wanted him to be remembered so they made sure his name was added to the Hawarden WW2 War Memorial."
